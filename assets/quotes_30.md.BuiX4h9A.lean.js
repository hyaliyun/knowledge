Ararat is the only ship of the Bathurst class to carry a pennant number with the flag superior 'K': to honour Flower-class corvette lead ship , which was sunk in October 1941. Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including Ararat) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Ararat was laid down by Evans Deakin & Co in Brisbane on 6 July 1942. She was launched on 20 February 1943 by the wife of Arthur Fadden, then leader of the Australian Country Party and the Federal Opposition, and commissioned on 16 June 1943. Operational history Ararat entered active service in August 1943 escorting convoys firstly along the east coast of Australia, and later between Queensland and New Guinea. She continued in this role until March 1944, when she was transferred to Langemak, New Guinea for two months, performing escort and patrol duties in the waters of New Guinea and New Britain. During this time, she was the first ship of her class to visit several recently recaptured areas in New Britain. The corvette was under refit in Melbourne from May until July 1944, and on completion returned to New Guinea. She was transferred to United States Naval command on 11 August 1944, and was used to patrol the forward areas of the Allied offensive. During this time, Ararat was involved in the transportation of survivors from sister ship following her collision with United States tanker York on 19 October. Ararat left US command at the end of 1944, and spent the early part of 1945 operating in the Morotai area. She briefly visited Townsville in March 1945, and in June, the corvette was deployed to Borneo to support Australian troops. Ararat returned to Australia on 22 July for refits, and was in dock when the war ended. The corvette's wartime service was recognised by the battle honours \\"Pacific 1943‚Äì45\\" and \\"New Guinea 1943‚Äì44\\". Ararat was assigned to the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla on 22 October 1945, and was involved in clearing mines laid during the war; first in Australian waters, then around New Britain, New Ireland, and the Solomon Islands. This assignment was completed in November 1946, and on 11 April 1947 was decommissioned into reserve. Ararat remained in reserve until 6 January 1961, when she was sold to Burns Philip & Co Ltd of Darwin. She was later sold on to the Fujita Salvage Company of Japan, who used her to perform salvage operations in Darwin Harbour. Ararat left Darwin for Japan on 20 July 1961, towing a crane. After arriving in Japan, she was broken up for scrap.

Four Corners is an Australian investigative journalism/current affairs documentary television program, the longest of its kind nationally. Broadcast on ABC in HDTV, it premiered on 19 August 1961 and celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2011. Founding producer Robert Raymond (1961‚Äì62) and his successor Allan Ashbolt (1963) did much to set the ongoing tone of the program. The program is one of only five in Australia inducted into the Logie Hall of Fame. History Four Corners is based on the concept of British current affairs program Panorama. The program addresses a single issue in depth each week, showing either a locally produced program or a relevant documentary from overseas. The program has won many awards for investigative journalism. It has also broken high-profile stories. A notable early example of this was the show's 1962 expos√© on the appalling living conditions endured by many Aboriginal Australians living in rural New South Wales. Notable episodes  In sharp contrast to print media, television was the medium for critical accounts of Australia's role in the War in Vietnam. Four Corners, regardless of modest ratings, favoured the viewpoint of the antiwar and anti- conscription movements. 1980s In 1983, Four Corners aired allegations that then New South Wales Premier Neville Wran had tried to influence the magistracy over the dropping of fraud charges against Kevin Humphreys, charged with misappropriation of funds from the Balmain Leagues Club. Wran stood down and the Street Royal Commission, headed by the Chief Justice of NSW, Sir Laurence Street, was set up to inquire into this matter. Street found that the chief magistrate, Murray Farquhar, had used the Premier's name to get the Humphreys case dismissed, but exonerated Wran of any involvement. Farquhar was subsequently sent to prison. Together with articles in The Courier-Mail, a 1987 Four Corners story entitled \\"The Moonlight State\\" reported on police corruption in Queensland. The subsequent Royal Commission, known as the Fitzgerald Inquiry, found systematic corruption in various levels of government and led to the gaoling of police commissioner Terry Lewis, and the resignation and subsequent criminal trial of Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen. The program has investigated other cases of corruption in the New South Wales and Victorian police forces. Another report from 1985 helped to reveal that the French secret service had been responsible for the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior. 2000s A 2006 episode titled \\"Greenhouse Mafia\\", exposed the influence of the fossil fuel lobby on Australian climate change policy. In March 2009, an episode titled \\"The Dishonouring of Marcus Einfeld\\" aired; it detailed the events leading up to the conviction and sentencing of an Australian former federal court judge, Marcus Einfeld. Einfeld was convicted on charges of perjury and perverting the course of justice over a speeding ticket. \\"The Code of Silence\\", which aired 11 May 2009, was an investigative report on the attitudes towards and the treatment of women by National Rugby League players. The report focused primarily on two incidents involving NRL players and women who felt they had been exploited sexually. The mainstream media reported heavily on the subject for a number of weeks following the airing of \\"The Code of Silence\\". The Four Corners website has also won multiple awards, including two Walkley Awards and three AIMIA Awards for its Broadband Editions of the programs, which include exclusive interviews, analysis and background information on selected programs. 2010s On 8 March 2010, a program was aired shedding light on ex-members of the controversial Church of Scientology, many speaking of abuse and other forms of inhumane treatment, for example coerced abortions and disconnection.Quentin McDermott (8 March 2010). Scientology in the spotlight amid fresh allegations. ABC News. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved on 30 March 2012.Quentin McDermott (8 March 2010). Scientology: The Ex-Files. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved on 30 March 2012. The program was of note due to Church spokesperson Tommy Davis \\"categorically [denying]\\" all allegations put forward by ex-members. All interviews were conducted by Four Corners journalist Quentin McDermott, and aired the same week that a Parliamentary vote was held for an inquiry into the Church after South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon brought Church abuse to light in November 2009.(18 November 2009).

Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Retrieved on 30 March 2012. On 30 May 2011, the program aired an expos√© on cruelty inflicted on Australian cattle exported to Indonesian abattoirs. As a result, there was a major public outcry at the practices and a petition launched by activist group GetUp! received more than 10,000 signatures overnight. This petition has received over 200,000 signatures.Ban Live Export. GetUp!. Retrieved on 30 March 2012. The next day, independent MP Andrew Wilkie and independent Senator Nick Xenophon lobbied for an immediate ban on live export to Indonesia, which was backed by the Federal Minister for Agriculture, Joe Ludwig. There was an immediate ban on the abattoirs featured in the graphic Four Corners program, which was followed by a six-month ban on all live trade to Indonesia. In February 2015, Four Corners uncovered widespread live baiting in the greyhound racing industry. The investigation revealed the use of live piglets, possums and rabbits to train racing greyhounds in three states. The revelation led to suspensions, resignations, inquiries and condemnation of the practice. The NSW Greyhound racing board was dismissed, and the Queensland Government dissolved all the Racing Queensland boards. On 26 July 2016, Four Corners aired graphic footage of systematic physical and verbal abuse of young Indigenous children and teenagers in the Northern Territory at Don Dale Youth Detention Centre. The episode caused outrage from the Australian public, prompting Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to announce a Royal Commission into the abuse occurring in the Northern Territory. This episode also resulted in the head of the detention centre, John Elfernik, being stood down from his position. On 4 February 2019, Four Corners aired a report documenting the status of women's rights in Saudi Arabia. The episode also chronicled Rahaf Mohammed who eventually found asylum in Canada, Dina Ali Lasloom who was unsuccessful in her attempt to secure asylum in Australia, and featured prominent activist Mona Eltahawy and Manal al-Sharif.

The music is characterized by the use of bagpipes. History thumb It has long been thought that Galician and Asturian music might owe their roots to the ancient Celtic history of the region, in which it was presumed that some of this ancient influence had survived despite the long evolution of the local musical traditions since then, including centuries of Roman and Germanic influences. Whether or not this is the case, much modern commercial Galician and Asturian traditional and folk-rock of recent years has become strongly influenced by modern Irish, Scottish and Welsh \\"folk\\" styles. Galicia is nowadays a strong player on the international Celtic folk scene. As a result, elements of the pre-industrial Galician tradition have become integrated into the modern Celtic folk repertoire and style. Many, however, claim that the \\"Celtic\\" appellation is merely a marketing tag; the well known Galician bagpipe player Susana Seivane, said \\"I think [the 'Celtic' moniker is] a label, in order to sell more. What we make is Galician music\\". In any case, due to the Celtic brand, Galician music is the only non- Castilian-speaking music of Spain that has a significant audience beyond the country's borders. Some Galicians and Asturians have complained that the \\"Celtic boom\\" was the final death blow to once highly distinctive musical traditions. Celtic culture is known to have extended over a large part of the Iberian Peninsula as early as 600BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, the Roman Empire slowly conquered Iberia, which they called Hispania. The Celtic regions put up a long and fierce struggle to maintain their independence but were eventually subdued. In the centuries that followed, the language of the Romans, Latin, came to gradually supplant nearly all the earlier languages of the peninsula, including all Celtic languages, and is the ancestor of all the current languages of Spain and Portugal, including Galician and Astur-Leonese-Mirandese but not Basque. The departure of the Romans in the 5th century led to the invasions of Germanic tribes. The Suebi people conquered the northwest but the poor documentation from the period has left their cultural impact on the region unclear. In the 6th century, a final small Celtic influx arrived from Britain; the Britons were granted their own diocese, Britonia, in northern Galicia. Galicia was then taken over by the Visigothic Kingdom when the Suebian kingdom fell apart. Galicia came under the control of the Moors after they defeated the Visigoths in 717 but Moorish rule was little more than a short lived military occupation, although an indirect Moorish musical influence arrived later, through Christian troubadours. Moorish rule ended after two decades when their garrison was driven out by a rebellion in 739. The region was incorporated into the Kingdom of Asturias and, after surviving the assaults of the Moors and Vikings, became the springboard for the Reconquista. In 810, it was claimed that the remains of Saint James, one of the apostles, had been found at a site which soon became known as Santiago de Compostela. It became Europe's premier pilgrimage destination in the Middle Ages. This is assumed to have had a significant effect on the folk culture of the area, as the pilgrims brought with them musical instruments and styles from as far afield as Scandinavia and Hungary. Like the earlier periods, little is known about musical traditions from this era. Just a few manuscripts from the time are known, such as those by the 13th-century poet and musician Mart√≠n Codax, which indicate that some of the distinctive elements of today's music, such as the bagpipes and flutes, were common at the time. The Cantigas de Santa Maria, a collection of manuscripts written in old Galician, also show illustrations of people playing bagpipes. Revival The Galician folk revival drew on early 20th century performers like Perfecto Feijoo, a bagpipe and hurdy-gurdy player. The first commercial recording of Galician music had come in 1904, by a corale called Aires d'a Terra from Pontevedra. The middle of the century saw the rise of Ricardo Portela, who inspired many of the revivalist performers, and played in influential bands like Milladoiro. Asturian folk dancers During the regime of Francisco Franco, honest displays of folk life were appropriated for politicised spectacles of patriotism, causing a sharp decline in the popularity of the traditional styles in favour of modern music. When Franco's regime ended in 1975, Galician and Asturian music experienced a strong revival and recordings flourished. The establishment of the Festival Internacional do Mundo Celta (1977), which helped establish some Galician bands. Aspiring performers began working with bands like Os Areeiras, Os Rosales, Os Campaneiros and Os Irm√°ns Garceiras, learning the folk styles; others went to the renowned workshop of Ant√≥n Corral at the Universidade Popular de Vigo. Some of these musicians then formed their own bands, like Milladoiro. In the 1980s and 1990s, some Galician and Asturian performers began to win fame within Spain and the international Celtic folk scene. Galician musicians of this period included Ux√≠a, a singer originally with the band Na L√∫a, whose 1995 album Estou vivindo no ceo and a subsequent collaboration with Sudanese singer Rasha, gained her an international following. The appearance of F√≠a na Roca, (that means \\"Spin in the spinning wheel\\") was undoubtedly one of the key events of the Galician musical scene in the 90's. F√≠a na Roca was also the name of their debut album released in 1993. Its mixture of tradition and modernity led BBC to choose the music of this album as the soundtrack of the TV program that broadcast the Galician image to Europe in the 1993 Xacobeo Celebration (Santiago de Compostela's Holy Year). It was Carlos N√∫√±ez, however, who has done the most to popularize Galician traditions. His 1996 A irmandade das estrelas sold more than 100,000 copies and saw major media buzz, partially due to the collaboration with well-known foreign musicians like La Vieja Trova Santiaguera, The Chieftains and Ry Cooder. His follow-up, Os amores libres, included more fusions with flamenco, Celtic music (especially Breton) and Berber music. The album received a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album. Other modern Galician bagpipe players include Xos√© Manuel Budi√±o and Susana Seivane. Seivane is especially notable as the first major female player, paving the way for many more women in a previously male- dominated field. Galicia's most popular singers are also mostly female, including Ux√≠a, Sonia Lebedynski and Mercedes Pe√≥n. A revival of traditional Asturian music also occurred during this period. Artists such as the popular bagpiper Hevia and music groups such as Llan de cubel and Tejedor helped to bring attention to Asturian folk music both within Asturias itself, and in the wider realm of the \\"Celtic\\" and world music scenes. Musicians from Asturias have become increasingly prominent at events such as the Festival Interceltique de Lorient in France. Present In current times, the most traditional forms of traditional music have their audience, as well as the variations that emerged in the 80s and 90s. In recent years, new trends have also emerged that mix traditional Galician music with electronics. The first hit song that mixes Galician traditional music with electronics dates back to 1978, when the group Son Lal√≠n launched their version of Mui√±eira de Chantada, created by the producer Gustavo Ramudo.http://www.galiciaunica.es/porque-se- llamaron-son-lalin/ Nowadays Mercedes Pe√≥n and Baiuca stand out. Traditional instruments Traditional instruments in Galicia, Asturias and Cantabria include the well-known Gaita, a kind of bagpipe, as well as an array of percussion and wind instruments. Wind instruments Folk wind instruments of the area include the Cantabrian pitu monta√±√©s, a kind of conical-bored shawm with seven holes in the front and one in the back, which is played in a similar manner to the bagpipe chanter. While it was traditionally made in E-flat, the instrument has been revitalized by Ant√≥n Corral, who makes them in D. A transverse flute with six holes is called a requinta; it is similar to the fife. It is usually in G, or sometimes a high C. Traditional Galician wind instruments include the pito pastoril (galego), literally (Galician) shepherd's whistle. Despite the similarity in name, this instrument belongs to a different family than the Cantabrian pitu monta√±√©s, namely that of the fipple flutes, which also includes the tin whistle and the recorder. The instrument has seen a revival in the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, finding a place in traditional music ensembles. Other wind instruments include chifre, ocarina and the imported clarinet and accordion. Cantabria has a rich dance repertoire for soprano clarinet, also known as pitu or requinto (not to be confused with the requinta fife). String instruments Plucked stringed instruments are common throughout Spain and Portugal, but they were proscribed in Galician or Asturian commercial folk music until recent years. Modern guitarists like Xes√∫s Pimentel often use strong flamenco influences in their sound. The violin has a long tradition in the area, common since the early 20th century, when blind fiddlers traveled to fairs to play traditional and self-composed songs, as well as pieces by composers like Sarasate. The hurdy gurdy (zanfona) has been played in the area for many centuries, but had mostly died out by the middle of the 20th century before being revived by Faustino Santalices, Xos√© Lois Rivas and the like. Though the instrument is now more closely associated with French music, the first recordings of the hurdy gurdy were by Galician Perfecto Feijoo in 1904. Harps had been used in the Middle Ages, but were not revived until the 1970s, when Emilio Cao used the instrument to accompany his compositions. Modern harpists have been encouraged by the use of the Celtic harp in Scotland, Ireland and Brittany, and include Quico Comesa√±a and Rodrigo Roman√≠. Percussion Percussion instruments include the tamboril, a snare drum that hangs from the player's belt and is played with two sticks. It is small, natural-skinned and features snares made usually of gut. Along with the bombo, a bass drum played with one stick, the tamboril is typically found as accompaniment to bagpipes. The pandeiro (Asturian: panderu) is a double-faced, square frame drum, similar to the Portuguese and Castilian adufe. It usually contains some beans that rattle inside. It is often played alongside the pandeireta, a large tambourine, in small groups or by a single female singer. A pair of vieira shells (cunchas) are rubbed together, and accompany dancing. Tarra√±olas (Asturian and Spanish: tejoletas) are strips of wood held between the fingers. Charrasco consists of a pole with a frame on the top adorned with tambourine rattles; it is played by rubbing a string along the pole with a stick. Other percussion instruments are canaveira and carraca. Gaita The term gaita may refer to a variety of different pipes, shawms, recorders, flutes and clarinets in different areas of Spain and Portugal, but in Galacia it refers to bagpipes, with the bag inflated with bellows or by a blowpipe. Outside of Galicia and Asturias, bagpipes are also traditionally played in other parts of Spain, including Aragon, Catalonia, Le√≥n, Majorca, Zamora and in Portugal in Minho, Tr√°s-os-Montes and Estremadura. Records show that the gaita was already common in the 13th century but suffered a decline in popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries until the 19th century renaissance of the instrument. The early 20th century saw another decline. Then, beginning in about the 1970s, a roots revival heralded another rebirth. The folk revival may have peaked in the late 1990s, with the release of acclaimed albums by Galician Carlos N√∫√±ez (A Irmandade Das Estrelas) and Asturian Hevia (Tierra De Nadie). Both releases broke records, and Tierra De Nadie sold more than a million copies. In the 18th century, an important teaching school was opened in Asturias, created by Jos√© Remis Vega. Musicians of that era included the legendary Ram√≥n Garc√≠a Tuero, while the 20th century produced performers like Vega's son, Jos√© Remis Ovalle and Jos√© Antonio Garc√≠a Su√°rez. The best-known modern Asturian player is Hevia, whose 1998 Tierra De Nadie was a landmark recording that smashes record sales and became the darling of the Spanish music media. Other modern performers and bands include Tejedor and Xuacu Amieva. Traditional use include both solo performances or with a snare-drum known as tamboril (a wooden natural-skinned drum with gut snares), and the bombo, a bass drum. The Council of Ourense sponsors a bagpipe band, the Real Banda de Gaitas da Excma. Deputaci√≥n de Ourense (Royal Pipe Band of the Council of Ourense). The Royal Pipe Band, founded by Jos√© Lois Foxo, uses blowpipe bagpipes in B flat, bagpipes with bellows tuned in F sharp, and a percussion section of snare drums, tenor drums, bass drums, tambourines and tarra√±olas. Its repertoire covers both traditional Galician music as well as music from other Celtic countries. It is the source of some controversy in Galacian music, as the blowpipe bagpipes employed by the band are felt by critics to be too similar to Highland bagpipes rather than traditional Galacian giatas. The drums are modern and not in a Galacian tradition, and the band marches military-style in parades which is also not a tradition in Galacian gaita music. Galician bagpipes come in three main varieties, though there are exceptions and unique instruments. These include the tumbal (B-flat), grileira (D) and redonda (C). Asturian bagpipes are usually played along with a tambor (snare drum). Asturian bagpipes usually have only one drone and follow a different fingering pattern. =Description= The player inflates the bag using his mouth through a tube fitted with a non-return valve. Air is driven into the chanter (; Asturian: punteru) with the left arm controlling the pressure inside the bag. The chanter has a double reed similar to a shawm or oboe, and a conical bore with seven finger-holes on the front. The bass drone (ronco or ronc√≥n) is situated on the player's left shoulder and is pitched two octaves below the key note of the chanter; it has a single reed. Some bagpipes have up to two more drones, including the ronquillo or ronquilla, which sticks out from the bag and plays an octave above the ronco, or the smaller chill√≥n. This two extra drones are placed by the right arm of the player. The finger-holes include three for the left hand and four for the right, as well as one at the back for the left thumb. The chanter's tonic is played with the top six holes and the thumb hole covered by fingers. Starting at the bottom and (in the Galician fingering pattern) progressively opening holes creates the diatonic scale. Using techniques like cross-fingering and half-holding, the chromatic scale can be created. With extra pressure on the bag, the reed can be played in a second octave, thus giving range of an octave and a half from tonic to top note. It is also possible to close the tone hole with the little finger of the right hand, thus creating a semitone below the tonic. =Songs= Tunes using the gaita are usually songs, with the voice either accompanying the instrumentation or taking turns with it. The most common type is the mui√±eira, found in both Asturias and Galicia, a sprightly 6/8 rhythm. Other 6/8 Galician tunes use different steps; they include the carballesa, ribeirana, redonda, chouteira and contrapaso. The asturian alborada usually-instrumental tune, most often in 2/4, though sometimes 3/4, and is characterized by a series of descending turning phrases. It is used to begin a day's celebrations, and is played at sunrise. Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov included three asturian movements (two Alboradas and one Fandango Asturiano) in his famous orchestral work Capriccio espagnol, Op. 34, written in 1887. The foliada is a joyful 3/4 jota-type song, often played at romer√≠as (community gatherings at a local shrine). Songs The oldest and best-known form of Galician music is the alal√°, a form of chanting that has been associated with Galician nationalism. They share characteristics with those of Castile as well as the Celtic nations. Their origin is shrouded in mystery, with some scholars asserting Gregorian chants as a major source, while others fancily point to Greek or Phoenician rowing songs called alelohu√≠as. Alal√°s are arhythmic, and based on a single, short theme that repeats the melody, separated by instrumental bagpipes or a cappella interludes. Melodies are based on a continuous drone and are almost always diatonic. Over time, alalas have adapted to include choral polyphony which has added harmony and rhythms (most typically in 2/4 or 3/4 time) to the tradition. A distinct feature of alalas is that the first cadence is also the last. They end in an enlarged coda that fades into a sustained and undefined sound. In contrast to the typically slow alal√° there are also swift songs called pandeirada. Marching tunes (Galician: ruadas, Asturian: pasuc√°is, Spanish: pasacalles) are also known, as well as the local variation of jota. Other Asturian dances include salt√≥n, diana, respingu, pericote, fandango, pasodoble, marcha procesional, rebudixu, corri-corri, baile de los pollos, giraldilla and xiring√ºelu. Dances Baile is the term for social dances, though there are also weapon dances like danzas de palillos (stick dances), danzas de espadas (sword dances) and danzas de arcillos (dances with decorated arches) a hallmark of Cantabrian folk tradition. Other popular dance songs in the area include the jota, pasacorredoiras (pasacalles, Asturian: pasuc√°is), and the imported fandango, mazurka, polka, rumba and pasodoble.

Steam frigates, also known as screw frigates and the smaller steam corvettes and steam sloops, were steam-powered warships that were not meant to stand in the line of battle. The first such ships were paddle steamers. Later on the invention of screw propulsion enabled construction of steam-powered versions of the traditional frigates, corvettes, and sloops. Evolution=The first steam warships The first small vessel that can be considered a steam warship was the Demologos, which was launched in 1815 for the United States Navy. From the early 1820s, the British Navy began building a number of small steam warships including the armed tugs and , and by the 1830s the navies of America, Russia and France were experimenting with steam-powered warships. Frigate classification The frigate and corvette were 'ships'. For a vessel to be called a 'ship' it had to have full rigging, i.e. square rigs on three masts. If it had only fore-and-aft rig on the mizzen mast, it was not a ship. Ships were classified as: ships of the line, frigates and corvettes. The upper limit for a ship to be still considered a frigate was that it had only one covered gun deck. If a ship had two covered gun decks, it was no longer a frigate, but a ship of the line. A confusing circumstance arose when in the early nineteenth century the forecastle and quarterdecks of most big ships were joined to become a complete flush deck above. These ships continued to be frigates, e.g HMS Constance (1846). The lower limit for a ship to still be considered a frigate was that its gun deck was covered. If a ship had only a single open gun deck it was considered to be 'corvette build'. If a ship had a single covered gun deck, it was at least a frigate. In general a frigate was commanded by a captain and a corvette by a lieutenant. Paddle frigates This first generation of steam warships were \\"paddle warships\\" (in the categories of frigate, sloop, gunvessel or other). They used paddlewheels mounted on either side or in the center. Paddle steamers were severely limited in the armaments they could mount. Paddle wheel propulsion also had very serious effects on sailing quality. The placement of the machinery and wheels in the middle of the ship conflicted with having the main mast there, and so the sail plan of paddle frigates was less than ideal. Another characteristic that slowed down these vessels was that the paddle wheels would rotate in the water freely when the ship was sailing. The armament of paddle frigates compared badly with their sail-only counterparts. Paddle frigates could not have a traditional full broadside because of the space taken by the machinery and the paddle wheels. The weight of the machinery and coal these ships carried was a perhaps even more serious problem. It meant that the designers had to limit the weight of all other 'cargo', including artillery. Therefore the armament of steam vessels had to follow a different concept: Because of their ability to move against the wind they could be assumed to be able to choose their distance to sail-only ships. Under these circumstances the very heavy guns that were deemed to fire too slowly for close-quarters combat did become useful because they had a high effective range. Meanwhile the development of heavy shell guns like the ML 8-inch shell gun provided a long range weapon that could sink a ship with a single hit. The only means to counter it was to develop heavier solid shot cannon that had an even higher effective range. All this generally led to equipping early steamers with only a few very heavy guns, both shell guns and solid shot guns. These were often mounted on pivots and slides. Paddle frigates were used extensively during the Opium Wars, Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Crimean War and American Civil War. An unintended quality was that the lack of broadside batteries gave them very spacious decks. Combined with being immune to contrary winds, this made them ideal for large scale troop transport. By 1870 most had been scrapped or sold into civilian service. Royal Navy By 1840 the Royal Navy had commissioned two ships that had been designed as steam paddle frigates. The Gorgon and the slightly larger Cyclops had both been constructed to have a full battery on their gun deck, next to carrying guns on their upper decks. However, Gorgon was so deep in the water that her gun ports had to be shut permanently. Cyclops had been designed to carry 16 32 pdrs on the main deck, but these could not be fitted. Both ships therefore failed to become true frigates, but were nevertheless very successful. The Cyclops would be taken as a model to build six more of these steam frigates (Vulture, Firebrand, Gladiator, Sampson, Dragon and Centaur) . On 31 May 1844 the Admiralty then officially adopted the term 'Steam frigate'. All these ships became steam (paddle) frigates of the second class, except for the Gorgon, which became a sloop. The rating of Cyclops as a 'steam frigate' was surprising: she was rigged as a brig (with only two masts), and carried all her guns on the upper deck Other aspects did explain this classification. The Cyclops was commanded by a captain and had at least been planned to have a 'complete' covered gun deck. The crew of 175 men was a reduced crew. By counting 13 men for every two 32 pdrs, the designed complement would be 175 + (8*13) = 284 men, almost matching that of a fifth rate frigate. Another reason to rate the Cyclops as a frigate was that with her size of 1,190 bm tons, she was of the same size as the fifth rate frigates like those of the Seringapatam-class frigate of 1,150 bm tons. As the RN lacked a corvette category, the alternative would have been to rate her as a sloop, but even ship-rigged sloops did not get near her size. When the RN started to use the designation corvette, the Cyclops and her six near sisters were re-classified as corvettes in the 1850s. In 1844 the Admiralty also discerned steam frigates of the first class, these steam frigates had guns on two decks. The steam frigates of the 'first class' were comparable to regular fourth rate sailing frigates in terms of size, and got near them in armament. The first of these was the paddle steamer HMS Penelope (1829) commissioned in 1843. She had been the sailing fifth rate frigate Penelope of 1829. In 1842 she was lengthened by 63 feet, and was fitted with the largest naval steam engines yet seen, generating nearly 700 horsepower. She had a 330 men crew, and was armed with 10 68 pdrs on the main deck, and on the forecastle and quarterdeck: 2 85cwt pivot guns, 10 42 pdr carronades and 4 howitzers. Penelope was followed by even bigger ships like the Retribution and HMS Terrible (1845). Other steam frigates first class, like the Avenger were a bit smaller. Only five first class steam paddle frigates would be built by the Royal Navy. The RN also built some more steam frigates of the second class, surprisingly with guns on two decks. U.S. Navy The U.S. Navy likewise started with a general 'steamer' class. In 1842 it consisted of: The Fulton II of 4 guns, commissioned in 1837. The Union (with a horizontal submerged paddle). She was not yet armed, but would later also have 4 guns. The Poinsett (1840) was a smaller craft that would later be armed with 2 guns. By then the US navy already had the screw corvette Princeton under construction. The first steam frigates of the United States were the USS Mississippi and Missouri. These were two very big steam paddle frigates commissioned in 1841 and 1842. They each displaced 3,220t and had 10 big Paixhans guns. By 1850 the U.S. paddle steamers were divided in classes. The Mississippi was designated a steam frigate, and so where the Susquehanna and Powhatan, each with 9 heavy guns, and the San Jacinto and Saranac each with 6 heavy guns. The next class were the 'steamers first class', containing the Fulton, Michigan and Alleghany. Seven other steamers were 'less than first class' Russian Navy The Russian Tsarist Navy also had a sizable fleet of paddle steam frigates. The first of these were imported from America, but by the time of the Crimean War the Russians were producing their own steamships. The 1841 steam frigate Kamchatka had 16 guns on two decks, and was therefore comparable to the big frigates of the English and American navies. See also List of Russian steam frigates. French Navy The first useful steam vessel of the French Navy was the Sphinx of 160 hp and 913t displacement. She was used in the invasion of Algiers in 1830. She was not very useful as a warship, but she was very useful for maintaining communications with Algeria. The subsequent campaign caused a huge demand for frequent and reliable communication with Algeria, and so about two dozen ships were built to the model of the Sphinx. The deplorable side effect was a stagnation in French steam vessel engineering. Continuing the Sphinx type meant that France was not developing something that resembled a steam frigate. Later on, the French state wanted to establish packet boat lines to New York, the West Indies and Brasil. The French navy wanted to have big steam frigates with heavy artillery. In 1840 these ideas were combined in a law that granted a credit of 28,400,000 francs for the construction of 14 ships of 450 hp, and 4 of 220 hp. The frigates built for this service soon proved to be no match for the ships of the Cunard Line. A project that loaned four of them to a commercial company soon failed. The Gomer was the first of these large frigates, and created quite a sensation. She was 70.5 m long between perpendiculars, had a beam of 12.7 m and displaced about 2,800t. On the trial run she was armed with 20 30 pdr on the main deck, and on the upper 2 * 22 cm and 2 * 16 cm and had a complement of 300 men. However, in actual use this artillery proved to be way more than what the Gomer could handle. It had to be reduced to 2 * 80 and 6 * 30. It meant that the Gomer had failed as a steam frigate. The same could be said of her (near) sisters of 450 hp, the Asmod√©ee and l'Infernal. Screw frigates Screw warships were built with steam engines and screw propellers for propulsion. The first functional propeller, a shortened version of the Archimedes Screw, was invented independently by Francis Pettit Smith and John Ericsson in 1835. The technology of propeller or 'screw' propulsion was proven by 1845 after the Royal Navy evaluated the performance of Smith's seagoing steamship SS Archimedes in comparison with their own fleet of paddle steamers. The basic fighting capabilities of the screw warship were almost as good as those of the traditional sailing ship. Apart from spending weight on machinery and coal, the screw ship retained the full broadside battery lay-out. It therefore had a nearly as powerful armament as a sail-only ship. Unlike the paddle ship it had no vulnerable paddle-boxes. The ability to pick a fight or to evade a fight was what made the screw frigate superior to any sail-only ship. The screw frigate retained a full sail-plan, and this was not only due to conservatism. The primary reason was a lack of coal supplies around the globe. This was an especially important consideration for frigates, which often operated independently on the far side of the world. The insufficient reliability of early steam engines was also a reason to maintain at least some sails. An often overlooked reason to have sails was the cost of coal. In 1848 the sail frigate Thetis was estimated to cost 64 GBP daily to operate. The Terrible of the same weight of armament was estimated to cost 88 GBP daily. But, the latter was without the cost of coal, estimated at 4 pounds 5 shillings per hour of steaming. The 'screw frigates', built first of wood and later of iron, continued to perform the traditional role of the frigate until late in the 19th century. By the late 1840s many navies were building screw- driven warships or converting sailing ships to include screw propulsion. In 1852 the French navy commissioned the Napoleon, the first screw driven battleship. With that all sailing warships had gotten a screw driven equivalent. Royal Navy By the time that the Royal Navy launched its first screw frigate, the Amphion it already had two screw sloops in commission. The 9 gun sloop HMS Rattler, launched in 1843, was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and featured an advanced two-bladed propeller that influenced the design of his later passenger steamer SS Great Britain.Being BrunelHMS Rattler The Amphion had 28 32 pdrs and 8 heavier guns. The size and armament of English wooden screw frigates then rapidly increased. The Euryalus of 1853 was 65 m long, displaced 3,125t, had 28 8 inch 65 cwt shell guns and 22 32 pdrs. The RN's first battleship designed for steam propulsion was the Agamemnon. She was 70m long, displaced 4,614t, and had 34 8 inch 65 cwt and 56 32 pdrs. In 1852-1853 the distinction between battleship and frigate was still a matter of size and number of gun decks. The improved screw propeller invented by Brunel also enabled the Victorian Royal Navy to extend the service life of obsolete sail-powered ships of the line. HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, first commissioned during the War of 1812, were fitted with steam locomotive boilers in 1845 for the Franklin expedition. The paddle sloop Phoenix was later rebuilt with a propeller for service in the Crimean War.HMS Terror wreck found in the Arctic In the late 1850s the screw frigate began to take a different form than traditional ships of the line. The RN's last battleship, the 91 gun Defiance laid down in 1858, was 75 m long and displaced 5,700t. The screw frigate Shannon was much smaller at 3,915t, but nevertheless much longer at 87 m. This development of much longer frigates culminated in the Mersey of 1858. The Mersey had 40 heavy shell guns, reached an overall length of over 100 m and displaced 5,463t. A wooden construction proved to be too weak for a ship of this length. The next steps were frigates with an iron or composite hull: the Armored frigate and the Unarmored frigate. French Navy The Pomone of 1842 was the first French screw frigate. She was 52 m long, 13.5 m wide, and had a slightly changed sail plan of a 46 gun frigate. She had 18 30 pdrs on the gun deck, and 8 80 pdrs and 8 other guns on the upper decks. The engine of the Pomone was 220 hp, giving her a speed of 7.5 knots. Using both sail and engine she could make 10.5 kn. Sailing before the wind, however she reached 12 kn without engines. The French navy next built the L'Isly, converted a number of sailing frigates, and built a range of successful corvettes. In 1852 a program for a number of first rate frigates was started. The Imp√©ratrice Eug√©nie class of 5 ships was built according to a design by Dupuy de L√¥me. Mr Allix designed the Souveraine. On average these ships displaced 3,800 t and reached 12 kn on trials. In 1857 the French government decided to have 6 big and 14 smaller frigates. Armored frigates From 1859, armor was added to ships based on existing frigate and ship of the line designs. The additional weight of the armour on these first ironclad warships meant that they could have only one gun deck, and they were technically frigates, even though they were more powerful than existing ships-of-the-line and occupied the same strategic role. The phrase 'armoured frigate' remained in use for some time to denote a sail-equipped, broadside-firing type of ironclad. For a time, they were the most powerful type of vessel afloat. Towards the end of the 19th century, the term 'frigate' fell out of use. Armoured vessels were designated as either 'battleships' or 'armoured cruisers', while unarmoured vessels including frigates and sloops were classified as 'unprotected cruisers'. Survivors The only surviving screw frigate is the Danish Jylland. The steam sloop HMS Gannet spent many years as a training ship and is now preserved at Chatham. The Dutch steam frigate HNLMS Bonaire is currently undergoing restoration as a museum ship. ARA Uruguay of the Argentinian navy is the last surviving steam and sail corvette. Japanese frigate Kaiy≈ç Maru was rebuilt as a museum ship in 1990.

Bluff, Utah and Comb Ridge from the air. The Four Corners is a region of the United States consisting of the southwestern corner of Colorado, southeastern corner of Utah, northeastern corner of Arizona, and northwestern corner of New Mexico. The Four Corners area is named after the quadripoint at the intersection of approximately 37¬∞ north latitude with 109¬∞ 03' west longitude, where the boundaries of the four states meet, and are marked by the Four Corners Monument. It is the only location in the United States where four states meet. Most of the Four Corners region belongs to semi-autonomous Native American nations, the largest of which is the Navajo Nation, followed by Hopi, Ute, and Zuni tribal reserves and nations. The Four Corners region is part of a larger region known as the Colorado Plateau and is mostly rural, rugged, and arid. In addition to the monument, commonly visited areas within Four Corners include Monument Valley, Mesa Verde National Park, Chaco Canyon, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument and Canyon de Chelly National Monument. The most populous city in the Four Corners region is Farmington, New Mexico, followed by Durango, Colorado. History The United States acquired the four corners region from Mexico after the end of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1848. In 1863 Congress created the Arizona Territory from the western part of New Mexico Territory. The boundary was defined as a line running due south from the southwest corner of Colorado Territory, which had been created in 1861. This was an unusual act of Congress, which almost always defined the boundaries of new territories as lines of latitude or longitude, or following rivers. By defining one boundary as starting at the corner of another, Congress ensured the eventual creation of four states meeting at a point, regardless of the inevitable errors of boundary surveying. The area was first surveyed by the U.S. Government in 1868 as part of an effort to make Colorado Territory into a state, the first of the Four Corners states formed. The first marker was placed at the spot in 1912. The first Navajo tribal government was established in 1923 to regulate an increasing number of oil exploration activities on Navajo land. Geography The Four Corners Monument is located at . The Four Corners is part of the high Colorado Plateau. This makes it a center for weather systems, which stabilize on the plateau then proceed eastward through Colorado and into the central states. This weather system creates snow and rain fall over the central United States. Federally protected areas in the Four Corners area include Canyon de Chelly National Monument, Hovenweep National Monument, Mesa Verde National Park, and Canyons of the Ancients National Monument. Mountain Ranges in the Four Corners include Sleeping Ute Mountains, Abajo Mountains, and the Chuska Mountains. Politics Six governments have jurisdictional boundaries at the Four Corners Monument: the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah, as well as the tribal governments of the Navajo Nation and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe. The Four Corners Monument itself is administered by the Navajo Nation Department of Parks and Recreation. Other tribal nations within the Four Corners region include the Hopi and other Ute. The Four Corners is home to the capital of the Navajo tribal government at Window Rock, Arizona. The Ute Mountain Ute Tribal headquarters are located at Towaoc, Colorado. The US federal government also has a large presence in the area, particularly the Department of the Interior with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of Agriculture with the Forest Service. Cities The Four Corners region is mostly rural. The economic hub, largest city, and only metropolitan area in the region is Farmington, New Mexico. The populated settlement closest to the center of Four Corners is Teec Nos Pos, Arizona. Other cities in the region include Cortez and Durango in Colorado; Monticello and Blanding in Utah; Kayenta and Chinle in Arizona; and Shiprock, Aztec, and Bloomfield in New Mexico. Transportation Air service is available via the Durango-La Plata County Airport in Durango, Colorado, Four Corners Regional Airport in Farmington, New Mexico, and Cortez Municipal Airport in Cortez, Colorado. Interstate 40 passes along the southern edge of the Four Corners region. The primary U.S. Highways that directly serve the Four Corners include U.S. Route 64, U.S. Route 160 (which serves the Four Corners Monument itself), U.S. Route 163, U.S. Route 191, U.S. Route 491 (previously U.S. Route 666), and U.S. Route 550. The main line of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, now operated by the BNSF Railway, passes along the southern edge of Four Corners. The area is home to remnants of through railroads that are now heritage railways. These include the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and the Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railroad. The Black Mesa and Lake Powell Railroad, which connects a power plant with a coal mine near Kayenta, comes near the Four Corners.

Considered an early feminist and called \\"a forgotten American literary treasure\\" by The New Yorker magazine, she was the author of 54 books and more than 200 articles and short stories. Her novels in the 20th century played a significant role in opening up Asia and Africa to the west. Her extensive travels throughout her life and her love of animals influenced much of her writing. After living in Florence and London in the mid-1920s, she traveled to the Belgian Congo and hiked across Central Africa in the 1930s. In 1935 she traveled to Shanghai, where she taught English for three years and became involved with prominent figures, such as The Soong Sisters and the Chinese poet, Shao Xunmei (Sinmay Zau).  Early life  Emily Hahn was born in St. Louis, Missouri on January 14, 1905 as one of the six children of Isaac Newton Hahn, a dry goods salesman, and Hannah (Schoen) Hahn, a free-spirited suffragette. Her family is of German-Jewish origin. Affectionately nicknamed \\"Mickey\\" by her mother after a cartoon comic strip character of the day named Mickey Dooley, she was known by this nickname to close friends and family. In her second year of high school, she moved with her family to Chicago, Illinois. With a love for reading and writing, she initially enrolled in a general arts program at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, but decided to change her course of study to mining engineering after being prevented from enrolling in a chemistry class predominately taken by engineering students. In her memoir, No Hurry to Get Home, she describes how the mining engineering program had never had a female enroll. After being told by a Professor in her mining engineering program that \\"The female mind is incapable of grasping mechanics or higher mathematics or any of the fundamentals of mining taught\\" in engineering, she was determined to become a mining engineer. Despite the coolness of the administration and her male classmates, in 1926 she was the first woman to receive a degree in Mining Engineering at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Her academic accomplishments were a testament to her intelligence and persistence so that her lab partner grudgingly admitted, \\"You ain't so dumb!\\" In 1924, prior to graduating from mining engineering school, she traveled across the United States in a Model T-Ford dressed as a man with her friend, Dorothy Raper. During her drive across New Mexico, she wrote about her travel experiences to her brother-in-law, who, unbeknownst to her, forwarded the letters she wrote to The New Yorker. This jump-started her early career as a writer. Hahn wrote for The New Yorker from 1929 to 1996. In 1930 she traveled to the Belgian Congo, where she worked for the Red Cross, and lived with a pygmy tribe for two years, before crossing Central Africa alone on foot. Her first book, Seductio ad Absurdum: The Principles and Practices of Seduction -- A Beginner's Handbook was published in 1930. It was a tongue-in- cheek exploration of how men court women. Maxim Lieber was her literary agent, 1930-1931.  China and Hong Kong  Her years in Shanghai, China (from 1935 to the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong in 1941) were the most tumultuous of her life. There she became involved with prominent Shanghai figures, such as the wealthy Sir Victor Sassoon, and was in the habit of taking her pet gibbon, Mr. Mills, with her to dinner parties, dressed in a diaper and a small dinner jacket. Supporting herself as a writer for The New Yorker, she lived in an apartment in Shanghai's red light district, and became romantically involved with the Chinese poet and publisher Shao Xunmei (Sinmay Zau). He gave her the entr√©e that enabled her to write a biography of the famous Soong sisters, one of whom was married to Sun Yat-sen and another to Chiang Kai-shek. Hahn frequently visited Zau's house, which was highly unconventional for a Western woman in the 1930s. The Treaty of the Bogue was in full effect, and Shanghai was a city divided by Chinese and Westerners at the time. Zau introduced her to the practice of smoking opium, to which she became addicted. She later wrote, \\"Though I had always wanted to be an opium addict, I can't claim that as the reason I went to China.\\" After moving to Hong Kong, she began an affair with Charles Boxer, the local head of British army intelligence. According to a December 1944 Time article, Hahn \\"decided that she needed the steadying influence of a baby, but doubted if she could have one. 'Nonsense!' said the unhappily-married Major Charles Boxer, 'I'll let you have one!' Carola Militia Boxer was born in Hong Kong on October 17, 1941\\". When the Japanese marched into Hong Kong a few weeks later Boxer was imprisoned in a POW camp, and Hahn was brought in for questioning. \\"Why?\\" screamed the Japanese Chief of Gendarmes, \\"why ... you have baby with Major Boxer?\\" \\"Because I'm a bad girl,\\" she quipped. Fortunately for her, the Japanese respected Boxer's record of wily diplomacy. She was not interned since she had stated she was legally married to Shao Xunmei on a document, and therefore the Japanese treated her as, in the words of Taras Grescoe of The New Yorker, \\"an honorary Asian\\". Hahn stated that Shao's wife approved of the document since it was a possible method of saving his press and that Shao had not been married \\"according to foreign law\\".Bien, Gloria. Baudelaire in China: A Study in Literary Reception. University of Delaware, December 14, 2012. , 9781611493900. p. 125. As Hahn recounted in her book China to Me (1944), she was forced to give Japanese officials English lessons in return for food, and once slapped the Japanese Chief of Intelligence in the face. He came back to see her the day before she was repatriated in 1943 and slapped her back. China to Me was an instant hit with the public. According to Roger Angell of The New Yorker, Hahn \\"was, in truth, something rare: a woman deeply, almost domestically, at home in the world. Driven by curiosity and energy, she went there and did that, and then wrote about it without fuss.\\" England, and return to the US In 1945 she married Boxer who, during the time he was interned by the Japanese, had been reported by American news media to have been beheaded; their reunion (their love story had been reported faithfully in Hahn's published letters) made headlines throughout the United States. They settled in Dorset, England at \\"Conygar\\",Jerry Dowlen, \\"'When I'm Sixty-Four': Enjoying Emily Hahn‚Äôs Memoir of Post-War England\\" , Books Monthly, Volume 15 No. 1 (January 2012) the estate Boxer had inherited, and in 1948 had a second daughter, Amanda Boxer (now a stage and television actress in London). Finding family life too constraining, however, in 1950 Hahn took an apartment in New York City, and from then on visited her husband and children in England only occasionally. She continued to write articles for The New Yorker, as well as biographies of Leonardo da Vinci, Aphra Behn, James Brooke, Fanny Burney, Chiang Kai-shek, D. H. Lawrence, and Mabel Dodge Luhan. According to biographer Ken Cuthbertson, while her books were favorably reviewed, \\"her versatility, which enabled her to write authoritatively on almost any subject, befuddled her publishers, who seemed at a loss as to how to promote or market an Emily Hahn book. She did not fit into any of the usual categories\\" because she \\"moved effortlessly...from genre to genre.\\" In 1978 she published Look Who's Talking, which dealt with the controversial subject of animal-human communication; this was her personal favorite among her non-fiction books. She wrote her last book, Eve and the Apes, in 1988 when she was in her eighties. Hahn reportedly went into her office at The New Yorker daily until just a few months before she died. She died on February 18, 1997 at Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 92, and died from complication from her surgery for a shattered femur. Legacy \\"Chances are, your grandmother didn't smoke cigars and let you hold wild role-playing parties in her apartment\\", said her granddaughter Alfia Vecchio Wallace in her affectionate eulogy of Hahn. \\"Chances are that she didn't teach you Swahili obscenities. Chances are that when she took you to the zoo, she didn't start whooping passionately at the top of her lungs as you passed the gibbon cage. Sadly for you ... your grandmother was not Emily Hahn.\\" In 1998, Canadian author Ken Cuthbertson published the biography Nobody Said Not to Go: The Life, Loves, and Adventures of Emily Hahn. \\"Nobody said not to go\\" was one of her characteristic phrases.

Operational history Ardent suffered a major fire in August 1969, raising questions about the design of the Attack class. The fire damage was repaired at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. She underwent refits at Cockatoo Island in 1970, 1974 and 1976. In November 1977, Ardent intercepted a boat carrying 180 Vietnamese asylum seekers. On 23 July 1980, Ardent apprehended two Indonesian fishing boats poaching in Australian waters off Derby. Ardent was transferred to the Hobart Port Division of the Royal Australian Navy Reserve on 18 June 1982. Decommissioning The patrol boat was decommissioned on 6 January 1994 and redesignated as a General Purpose Vessel with the pennant number A243. It was assigned as a navigation training ship for junior warfare officers based in Sydney. Ardent was replaced by the Defence Maritime Services vessel Seahorse Mercator. Disposal Ardent was withdrawn from service in December 1998 and offered to the government of the Northern Territory, which considered placing it in the Darwin Military Museum, but remained moored at until the NT government declined the offer in August 2000.

According to the , it has a population of inhabitants, making it the second most-populous city in the province after the provincial capital of Tacloban. Ormoc is the economic, cultural, commercial and transportation hub of western Leyte. Ormoc is an independent component city, not subject to regulation from the Provincial Government of Leyte. However, the city is part of the 4th Congressional District of Leyte together with Albuera, Kananga, Merida, Palompon and Isabel, and statistically grouped under the province by the Philippine Statistics Authority. On November 8, 2013, the city was extensively damaged by Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), having previously suffered severe destruction and loss of life in 1991 from torrential flooding during Tropical Storm Thelma (Uring). The city's name is derived from ogmok, an archaic Visayan term for \\"lowland\\" or \\"depressed plain\\". The city also celebrates an annual thanksgiving festival called the Pi√±a Festival in honor of the saints Peter and Paul in thanks for the bountiful pineapple harvest. Geography Ormoc City is a port city and is the largest city in Leyte by land area and the second-largest in Eastern Visayas after Calbayog City in Samar. At the head of Ormoc Bay, the city's terrain is mostly of gently rolling plains. It is bounded on the northwest by the towns of Matag-ob and Merida, in the north by Kananga, in the northeast by the towns of Jaro, Pastrana and Dagami, and in the south by the town of Albuera. High mountain ranges separate Ormoc from the eastern portion of Leyte. Numerous rivers and streams traverse Ormoc. Among them are the Bao River in the north, Pagsangahan River in the west, the Bagong-bong River in the south, the Panilahan River also in the south and the Anilao and Malbasag Rivers which border the eastern and western flanks of Ormoc City Proper. Barangays Ormoc is politically subdivided into 110 barangays. * Airport * Alegria * Alta Vista * Bagongbong * Bagong Buhay * Bantigue * Barangay District 1 (Pob.) * Barangay District 2 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 3 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 4 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 5 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 6 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 7 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 8 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 9 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 10 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 11 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 12 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 13 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 14 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 15 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 16 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 17 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 18 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 19 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 20 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 21 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 22 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 23 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 24 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 25 (Malbasag) (Poblacion) * Barangay District 26 (Isla Verde)(Poblacion) * Barangay District 27 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 28 (Poblacion) * Barangay District 29 (Nadongholan) (Poblacion) * Batuan * Bayog * Biliboy * Cabaon-an * Cabintan * Cabulihan * Cagbuhangin * Camp Downes * Can-adieng * Can-untog * Catmon * Cogon Combado * Concepcion * Curva * Danhug (Lili-on) * Dayhagan * Dolores * Domonar * Don Carlos B.

Kananga was created in 1950 from the barrios of Lonoy, Kananga, Rizal, Tugbong, Montebello, Aguiting, Tagaytay, Montealegre, Libungao, Naghalin, and Masarayao which all used to be part of Ormoc City. 1991 Flash Flood On the morning of 5 November 1991, the Ormoc region was inundated by Tropical Storm Uring. The city government recorded 4,922 deaths, 3,000 missing persons, 14,000 destroyed houses and more than P600 million worth of damaged property. None of the 3,000 missing persons were ever found and are now presumed dead. Illegal logging and kaingin (slash-and-burn farming) were blamed as the reasons of the flood. Heavy rainfall caused water to collect upstream the Anilao and Malbasag rivers until it poured to the lowlands in Ormoc, particularly District 26, also known as Isla Verde. According to Roderick Caballero Deiparine, on 5 November 2011, a monument by national artist Francis Cinco commemorating the 20th anniversary of the event was inaugurated. It sits on top of the mass grave at the Ormoc City Public Cemetery where an estimated 4,900 victims are buried. The sculpture, entitled \\"Gift of Life\\", is an abstract depicting a life taken to heaven. 2006 Store Fire A fire at the Unitop store killed 25 people on Christmas day. The fire started from firecrackers and pyrotechnics that were ignited near the entrance door. The store did not have a permit to sell firecrackers and emergency exits were locked. The charred remains of the victims were found inside a bathroom, where they tried to escape from the blaze.  2013 Super Typhoon Haiyan  On November 7, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, made a landfall in the Philippines. While it killed far fewer people as Tropical Storm Uring, it left widespread devastation to the city with destruction and damages in 90% of its structures. Demographics The natives of this city are called Ormocanons, with most being Cebuano speakers, as with the whole western and southern parts of the island of Leyte. A definite number of Waray speakers is also present within the city. Like most Filipinos, Ormocanons are predominantly Roman Catholic, and the city celebrates its annual fiesta in honour of the patron saints Saint Peter and Saint Paul on June 28 and 29. Other main Catholic holy days, including the local fiestas of barangays, are observed throughout the year. There is also a visible Muslim minority within the city and all over the island, evidenced by the mosques within the cityscape and most of them are Maranaos from the twin provinces of Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur in Mindanao. Economy Ormoc's economic base is a mix of agriculture, aquaculture, industry, tourism, and commercial services. Sugar cane, rice and pineapple are the major agricultural production. The city enjoys economic growth because it supplies a large part of the country's power needs with its abundant geothermal power resources from the Tongonan Geothermal Power Plant in Barangay Tongonan and the neighbouring Kananga town. Ormoc is also the gateway to the Leyte Industrial Development Estate in the nearby town of Isabel, home of the Philippine Phosphate Fertilizer Plant, the largest fertilizer factory in Asia, and the Philippine Associated Smelter and Refining Company, the country's biggest copper processing plant, among other industries. Education Eastern Visayas State University - Ormoc Campus Ormoc is the educational center for western Leyte. It has a range of primary and secondary schools, both public and private. Tertiary education was originally offered by St. Peter's College of Ormoc, a Benedictine-run Catholic college and the oldest, followed by Western Leyte College of Ormoc City, Inc.,WLC-Website a private non-sectarian college. In the 1990s, the city saw the establishment of Santo Ni√±o College of Ormoc, St. Paul's School of Ormoc Foundation, Inc. and the STI College - Ormoc. In the 2000s, tertiary institutions founded were ACLC College of Ormoc, San Lorenzo Ruiz College of Ormoc, Ormoc City Institute of Technology (OCIT) and the Ormoc campus of the Eastern Visayas State University.

This stands in contrast to the present corporate food regime, in which corporations and market institutions dominate the global food system. The phrase \\"culturally appropriate\\" signifies that the food that is available and accessible for the population should fit with the cultural background of the people consuming it.  History  The history of food sovereignty as a movement is relatively young. However, there are a number of key movements and countries that have made significant steps towards making an alternative food system a reality.  Global gatherings  At the Forum for Food Sovereignty in S√©lingu√©, Mali, 27 February 2007, about 500 delegates from more than 80 countries adopted the \\"Declaration of Ny√©l√©ni\\",Declaration of Ny√©l√©ni (text), Ny√©l√©ni 2007 - Forum for Food Sovereignty. Accessed online 19 February 2010. which says in part: > Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally > appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable > methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. > It puts those who produce, distribute and consume food at the heart of food > systems and policies rather than the demands of markets and corporations. It > defends the interests and inclusion of the next generation. It offers a > strategy to resist and dismantle the current corporate trade and food > regime, and directions for food, farming, pastoral and fisheries systems > determined by local producers. Food sovereignty prioritises local and > national economies and markets and empowers peasant and family farmer-driven > agriculture, artisanal fishing, pastoralist-led grazing, and food > production, distribution and consumption based on environmental, social and > economic sustainability. In April 2008 the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), an intergovernmental panel under the sponsorship of the United Nations and the World Bank, adopted the following definition: \\"Food sovereignty is defined as the right of peoples and sovereign states to democratically determine their own agricultural and food policies.\\"International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), Global Summary for Decision Makers Accessed online 23 September 2008  Becoming part of government policy  In September 2008, Ecuador became the first country to enshrine food sovereignty in its constitution. As of late 2008, a law is in the draft stages that is expected to expand upon this constitutional provision by banning genetically modified organisms, protecting many areas of the country from extraction of non-renewable resources, and to discourage monoculture. The law as drafted will also protect biodiversity as collective intellectual property and recognize the Rights of Nature.Karla Pe√±a, \\"Opening the Door to Food Sovereignty in Ecuador, Food First News & Views (Institute for Food and Development Policy), Winter 2008, Volume 30, Number 111, p. 1. Since then another five countries have integrated food sovereignty into their national constitutions or laws. These countries are Venezuela, Mali, Bolivia, Nepal and Senegal; and most recently Egypt (2014 Constitution).Hannah Wittman, Annette Desmarais & Nettie Wiebe \\"Food Sovereignty - Reconnecting Food, Nature and Community\\" (2010)  Food sovereignty in Europe  In 2011 more than 400 people from 34 European countries met from 16 to 21 August in Krems, Austria, to plan the development of a European movement for food sovereignty. The meeting included people from the Atlantic to the Urals and Caucasus, as well as from the Arctic to the Mediterranean. These people included international representatives from diverse social movements and civil society organisations. By coming together they aimed to build on the foundations of the Mali forum in 2007. The objectives were to strengthen local involvement; build a sense of common purpose and understanding; create a joint agenda for action; celebrate the struggle for food sovereignty in Europe; and inspire and motivate people and organisations to work together. The forum, which was organised on the principles of participation and consensus decision making, used methods to avoid institutionalised prejudices that are inherent in society (such as gender, age, language, occupation). It did this by making a concerted effort to allow for all sections of society to be included in the discussion. The forum allowed producers and activists from projects across Europe to share skills, coordinate actions and discuss perspectives. The forum culminated in the Ny√©l√©ni declaration.<\\"Nyeleni Europe declaration\\"> Since 2011 Europe-wide gatherings and actions have continued, including the Good Food March, where citizens, youth and farmers came together to call for a greener and fairer agricultural policy in Europe, as well as democratic reform of Europe's Common Agricultural Policy.  Indigenous food sovereignty = Global Issues  Climate = Climate change is impacting the food security of indigenous communities as well, including Pacific Islanders and those in the Circumpolar North, due to rising sea levels or erosion. = Cuisine = Activists claim that native food sovereignty is also appropriated as a cuisine for mainstream dining because indigenous foods are framed to be culturally authentic, desired by those outside of these communities. Ingredients that are cultural staples, which are harder for these populations to find, are displaced due to a greater demand for access outside of indigenous populations.  Indigenous food sovereignty in the United States  Indigenous people‚Äôs food sovereignty and food security are closely related to their geographical location. Traditional indigenous foodways in the United States are tied to the ancestral homelands of Native American populations, especially for those tied to subsistence traditions. For instance, it is taught among the Muckleshoot that ‚Äúthe land that provides the foods and medicines we need are a part of who we are,‚Äù land constituting an important part of American Indian identity because of its importance for food. The disruption of traditional foodways is described to be tied to the disruption of the connection between traditional Native land and their people, a change Rachel V. Vernon describes as being tied to ‚Äúracism, colonialism, and the loss of autonomy and power.‚Äù Pre-colonial lands were expansive, thriving with traditional foods. Because of disease and war, Native peoples in 1900 were directly impacted in their ability to acquire and prepare their food. In addition to this, relocation away from traditional lands further limited traditional foodways. Many now live in food deserts. Due to inadequate or inhibited access to food, indigenous peoples suffer disproportionately from food insecurity compared to the rest of the US population. At reservations, the ‚Äú‚Äòhighly processed, high sugar, high fat, and processed foods,‚Äô‚Äù further contributed to health issues in Native populations. In addition to this, a majority of Native peoples also live off-reservation, and so are even further removed from their traditional foodways. Because Native American nations are sovereign from the United States, they receive little help in rehabilitating traditional foodways. As defined by the National Congress of American Indians, tribal sovereignty ensures that any decisions about the tribes with regard to their property and citizens are made with their participation and consent. The United States federal government recognizes Native American tribes as separate governments, opposed to ‚Äúspecial interest groups, individuals, or some other type of non-governmental entity.‚Äù = Health and Disease = Indigenous populations are affected by the highest rates of diabetes and heart disease among the US population, being over three times more likely to have diabetes compared to all other demographics of the US population. Disproportionate health concerns are a direct result of oppression foods or foods supplied by the US government, mostly consisting of non-traditional, cheap processed and canned foods. Indigenous peoples have a long history of experiencing pandemics. When the Aztecs were invaded by the Spaniards in 1519, they were completely wiped out by smallpox, and when the Europeans arrived in the late 1590s and early 1600s, they brought a multitude of diseases and epidemics that greatly affected indigenous life of the past, and can still even be seen among various Indigenous populations today. During the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, Indigenous people all across the globe suffered exponentially, and in some cases were completely decimated, and the fatality rates of Native Americans were four times higher than the rest of the broader American population. The COVID-19 Virus is another pandemic that‚Äôs affecting Indigenous communities in the United States and internationally. Indigenous communities already have little to no access to things like healthcare and other preventive measures such as soap, purified water, and chemical disinfectants. During mandatory lockdowns, those who face the challenges of hunger and malnutrition due to the loss of their native lands now have to confront even larger challenges to access to food. As a result of all of this, indigenous populations have substantially suffered as governments globally do not offer assistance. Indigenous peoples in America are also facing discrimination when it comes to gaining resources for those who are sick with the virus, as a Native American health center located in Seattle requested medical supplies for their growing number of cases. Three weeks later, they were not sent any supplies, but rather a single box of body bags. = Activism = Native Americans today fight for food sovereignty as a means to address health, returning to culturally traditional foods for healing. Returning to traditional eating is challenging, considering an extensive history of relocation and cultural genocide. Many Native American histories of traditional culture foods have been lost or are now difficult to recreate. Indigenous food sovereignty activists in the United States assert that indigenous communities have been systematically displaced from their traditional foodways, which has led to mass food insecurity.Cot√©, Charlotte. (2016). ‚ÄúIndigenizing‚Äù Food Sovereignty. Revitalizing Indigenous Food Practices and Ecological Knowledges in Canada and the United States. Humanities 5, 57. They assert that the most effective way to achieve food security for indigenous groups is to increase their agency in food production.Murphy, Andi. (2019). Indigenous Food Security is Dependent on Food Sovereignty. Retrieved from https://civileats.com/2019/07/24/indigenous- food-security-is-dependent-on-food-sovereignty/ Some activists also argue for food sovereignty as a means of healing historical trauma and as a means of decolonizing their communities. A variety of activist groups work towards indigenous food sovereignty globally. Largely, they work towards revitalizing traditional cultural practices for acquiring and preparing food or establishing new ways to navigate their local economies alongside non-native farming. In the United States, these groups, including the Indigenous Food Systems Network and the Native American Food Sovereignty Alliance, work towards education and policy-making concerned with food and farming security. Another group focused on requiring food and energy sovereignty is the White Earth Anishnaabeg from Minnesota, who focus on a variety of foods, planting and harvesting them using traditional methods. Such groups meet to establish policies for food sovereignty and to develop their local food economies at summits such as the Din√© Bich‚Äôiiya‚Äô Summit in Tsaile, Arizona, which focused on Navajo traditional foods. Indigenous food sovereignty activists also often advocate for seed sovereignty, and more generally for plant breeders‚Äô rights. Seed saving is important to indigenous communities in the United States not only because it provides those communities with a stable food source, and therefore of public health value, but also because of its cultural importance.LaDuke, Winona. (2012). Seeds of Our Ancestors, Seeds of Life, TEDxTC. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHNlel72eQc In addition, seed sovereignty advocates often argue that seed saving is an important mechanism in creating agricultural systems that can adapt to climate change.White, Rowen. (2018). The Native Seed Pod, Episode 1. https://www.nativeseedpod.org/podcast/2018/episode-1-the-natural-law-of-seeds A few notable seed sovereignty advocates include Rowen White, who has worked largely with Sierra Seeds, and Winona LaDuke.  Seed Sovereignty  Seed sovereignty can be defined as the right ‚Äúto breed and exchange diverse open- sourced seeds.\\" It is closely connected to food sovereignty, as seed sovereignty activists argue for the practice of seed saving partly as a means of increasing food security. These activists argue that seed saving allows for a closed food system that can help communities gain independence from major agricultural companies. Seed sovereignty is distinct from food sovereignty in its emphasis on seed saving specifically, rather than food systems in their entirety. Seed sovereignty activists often argue for seed saving based on environmental reasoning, not just food justice ones. They argue that seed saving fills an important role of restoring biodiversity to agriculture, and producing plant varieties that are more resilient to change climatic conditions in light of climate change.  Food sovereignty versus food security  Food sovereignty was born in response to campaigners' disillusion with food security, the dominant global discourse on food provisioning and policy. The latter emphasises access to adequate nutrition for all, which may be provided by food from one's own country or from global imports. In the name of efficiency and enhanced productivity, it has therefore served to promote what has been termed the \\"corporate food regime\\": large-scale, industrialised corporate farming based on specialised production, land concentration and trade liberalisation. Food security's inattention to the political economy of the corporate food regime blinds it to the adverse effects of that regime, notably the widespread dispossession of small producers and global ecological degradation. Haiti can be seen as a case study. Migration from the countryside to cities has reflected a transition from subsistence agriculture to factory labor. Farmers were forced to make this move because of heavy imports of \\"Miami rice\\", with which their natively-grown rice could not compete in the local market. By 2008, Haiti was importing 80 percent of its rice, leaving them extremely vulnerable to price and supply fluctuations. When the price of rice did triple in 2008, many Haitians could not afford to buy it. Writing in Food First's Backgrounder, fall 2003, Peter Rosset argues that \\"food sovereignty goes beyond the concept of food security... [Food security] means that... [everyone] must have the certainty of having enough to eat each day[,] ... but says nothing about where that food comes from or how it is produced.\\" Food sovereignty includes support for smallholders and for collectively owned farms, fisheries, etc., rather than industrializing these sectors in a minimally regulated global economy. In another publication, Food First describes \\"food sovereignty\\" as \\"a platform for rural revitalization at a global level based on equitable distribution of farmland and water, farmer control over seeds, and productive small-scale farms supplying consumers with healthy, locally grown food.\\" Food justice is a similar concept, but its discourses focuses more on race and class inequities and their relation to food, whereas food sovereignty refers more so to agency over food production systems.  Criticisms of the Green Revolution  The Green Revolution is upheld by some proponents of food security as a success story in increasing crop yields and combating world hunger. However, many in the food sovereignty movement are critical of the green revolution and accuse those who advocate it as following too much of a Western culture technocratic program that is out of touch with the needs of majority of small producers and peasants. The ‚Äògreen revolution‚Äô refers to developments in plant breeding between the 1960s and 1980s that improved yields from major cereal crops, particularly wheat and rice, and other staple crops. The main focus was on the research, development and transfer of agricultural technology, such as hybrid seeds and fertilisers, through massive private and public investment that went into transforming agriculture in a number of countries, starting in Mexico and India. While the green revolution may have produced more food, world hunger continues because it did not address the problems of access.Friends of the Earth International (2005) Nature: poor people‚Äôs wealth - the importance of natural resources in poverty eradication. Amsterdam: FOEI Food sovereignty advocates argue that the green revolution failed to alter the highly concentrated distribution of economic power, and if anything, exacerbated it ‚Äì particularly access to land and purchasing power. Some critics argue that globally the green revolution caused vast environmental destruction though the increased use of herbicides which caused dramatic loss in biodiversity. There was also a loss of traditional knowledge as farmers relied more heavily of biotechnological inputs. The green revolution favored wealthy, large scale farmers and forced many smaller, poorer farmers into debt. Some of these views are supported by the World Bank- and UN-sponsored IAASTD report.Greenpeace (2008) The World Agriculture Report 2008: Results and Recommendations. Amsterdam: GreenpeacePractical Action (2010) Securing Future Food: a summary of the IAASTD findings and their implementation... or not ! Rugby: Practical Action. The focus on technology paid no regard to who controlled that technology and ignored the knowledge of the people who were expected to adopt it. Results included significant biodiversity loss due to the mass adoption of hybrid seeds and soil erosion. The adoption of genetically modified (GMOs) cropping by the government of Western Australia in 2010 and the subsequent failure of crop segregation has led to the contamination of at least one organic farm by Monsanto's GM canola.Paull, John (2015) The threat of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to organic agriculture: A case study update, Agriculture & Food, 3: 56-63. The organic certification of the certified organic farm of Steve and Sue Marsh was withdrawn in 2010 due to GM contamination. A court case in the Supreme Court of Western Australia for nuisance and negligence failed to achieve any relief or protection for the organic farm. However, the organic certification of the Marsh farm was reinstated in 2013.  Academic perspectives = Food Regime theory  It is in its capacity as a social movement that food regime analysts are interested in food sovereignty. With its Marxist influences, food regime theorists are interested in how moments of crisis within a particular food regime are expressive of the dialectical tension that animates movement between such configurations (i.e., periods of transition). According to leading theorist Philip McMichael, food regimes are always characterised by contradictory forces. Consolidation of a regime does not so much resolve as it does contain, or else strategically accommodate, these tensions. According to McMichael, a \\"world agriculture\\" under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture (\\"food from nowhere\\") represents one pole of the \\"central contradiction\\" of the present regime. He is interested in the food sovereignty movement's potential to escalate the tension between this and its opposing pole, the agroecology-based localism (\\"food from somewhere\\") advocated by various grassroots food movements. Offering slightly different conclusions, recent work by Harriet Friedmann suggests that \\"food from somewhere\\" is already being co-opted under an emergent \\"corporate- environmental\\" regime (cf. Campbell 2009).  Criticisms  Wrong baseline assumptions = Some scholars argue that the Food Sovereignty movement follows wrong baseline assumptions (small-scale farming is not necessarily a freely chosen life-style and farmers in least developed and highly developed countries do not face the same challenges). The Food Sovereignty movement may be right about the mistakes of neoliberal economic ideology, but it is silent about the fact that many famines actually occurred under socialist and communist regimes that pursued the goal of food self- sufficiency (cf. Aerni 2011).. = Political-jurisdictional model = There is a lack of consensus within the food sovereignty movement regarding the political or jurisdictional community at which its calls for democratisation and renewed \\"agrarian citizenship\\" (cf. Wittman 2009) are directed. In public statements, the food sovereignty movement urges for strong sovereign powers for both national governments and local communities (in the vein of the indigenous rights movement, Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) and the like) (elsewhere it has also appealed to global civil society to act as a check against abuses by national and supranational governing bodies). Those who take a radically critical view on state sovereignty would argue against the possibility that national sovereignty can be reconciled with that of local communities (see also the debate about multiculturalism and indigenous autonomy in Mexico ). On the other hand, Raj Patel is more favourable towards this prospect: for Patel, an adapted version of Seyla Benhabib‚Äôs Kantian-inspired federalism, involving multiple geographies of democratic jurisdiction, could offer a promising way to realize food sovereignty on a large scale. A proviso is that Patel requires a stronger version of Benhabib‚Äôs accompanying principle of moral universalism. By Patel‚Äôs assessment, the food sovereignty movement is showing promising signs of moving towards the egalitarianism and democratic process that such a model entails. = Crisis of the peasantry? = In its strong reassertion of rural and peasant identities, the food sovereignty movement has been read as a challenge to modernist narratives of inexorable urbanisation, industrialisation of agriculture, and de-peasantisation. However, as part of ongoing debates over the contemporary relevance of agrarianism in classical Marxism, Henry Bernstein is critical of these accounts. He claims that such analyses tend to present the agrarian population as a unified, singular and world-historical social category, failing to account for: * a population's vast internal social differentiation (North/South, gender and class positionalities); * the conservative, cultural survivalist tendencies of a movement that has emerged as part of a backlash against the perceived homogenising forces of globalisation (Boyer discusses whether food sovereignty is a counter or anti- development narrative ) Berstein claims that these accounts cannot escape a certain agrarian populism (or agrarianism).

Its patron saint is John of Sahagun and his feast day is celebrated every June 12.http://sjsparish.blogspot.com/2010/01/brief-history- of-parish.html Toledo is about away from Cebu City and is widely known for its huge mining industry owned by Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation, which is the umbrella of Carmen Copper Corporation and its Toledo Mine. History It is formerly known as Pueblo Hinulawan. Second World War In 1942 the Japanese Imperial forces captured and occupied the town of Toledo. In 1945 local Filipino forces of the Philippine Commonwealth Army from the 8th, 82nd, 83rd, 85th and 86th Infantry Division aided by Cebuano guerrilla resistance fighters, battled against the Japanese Imperial forces and liberated the town of Toledo. Cityhood On June 19, 1960, Toledo became a chartered city under Republic Act No. 2688. It was made into a city through the efforts of then Congressman Manuel A. Zosa, representative of the old Sixth District of Cebu, who authored Republic Act No. 2688. Although not as progressive as Cebu's other cities, it is unique in that it is the only city in the province on the western seaboard facing Negros Oriental ‚Äì and therefore strategically located. (Danao, Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu, Cebu City, Talisay, Naga, and Carcar are on the east. One more city, Bogo City, is in the north, on the eastern side.) Shrine of Saint Pedro Calungsod Following the canonization on 21 October 2012 of Visayan teen martyr Pedro Calungsod (1672), the hilltop parish of Cantabaco became the first shrine and church named after the second Filipino saint.

Design and construction The Attack class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the Ton class minesweepers on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation), and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea's Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels.

The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception (by the bully or by others) of an imbalance of physical or social power. This imbalance distinguishes bullying from conflict. Bullying is a subcategory of aggressive behavior characterized by the following three minimum criteria: (1) hostile intent, (2) imbalance of power, and (3) repetition over a period of time. Bullying is the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual, physically, mentally, or emotionally. Bullying ranges from one-on-one, individual bullying through to group bullying, called mobbing, in which the bully may have one or more \\"lieutenants\\" who are willing to assist the primary bully in their bullying activities. Bullying in school and the workplace is also referred to as \\"peer abuse\\". Robert W. Fuller has analyzed bullying in the context of rankism. The Swedish-Norwegian researcher Dan Olweus says bullying occurs when a person is \\"exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions on the part of one or more other persons\\", and that negative actions occur \\"when a person intentionally inflicts injury or discomfort upon another person, through physical contact, through words or in other ways\\". Individual bullying is usually characterized by a person behaving in a certain way to gain power over another person. A bullying culture can develop in any context in which humans interact with each other. This may include school, family, the workplace, the home, and neighborhoods. The main platform for bullying in contemporary culture is on social media websites. In a 2012 study of male adolescent American football players, \\"the strongest predictor [of bullying] was the perception of whether the most influential male in a player's life would approve of the bullying behavior.\\" Bullying may be defined in many different ways. In the United Kingdom, there is no legal definition of bullying, while some states in the United States have laws against it. Bullying is divided into four basic types of abuse - psychological (sometimes called emotional or relational), verbal, physical, and cyber. Behaviors used to assert such domination may include physical assault or coercion, verbal harassment, or threat, and such acts may be directed repeatedly toward particular targets. Rationalizations of such behavior sometimes include differences of social class, race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, behavior, body language, personality, reputation, lineage, strength, size, or ability. If bullying is done by a group, it is called mobbing.  Etymology  The word \\"bully\\" was first used in the 1530s meaning \\"sweetheart\\", applied to either sex, from the Dutch boel \\"lover, brother\\", probably diminutive of Middle High German buole \\"brother\\", of uncertain origin (compare with the German buhle \\"lover\\"). The meaning deteriorated through the 17th century through \\"fine fellow\\", \\"blusterer\\", to \\"harasser of the weak\\". This may have been as a connecting sense between \\"lover\\" and \\"ruffian\\" as in \\"protector of a prostitute\\", which was one sense of \\"bully\\" (though not specifically attested until 1706). The verb \\"to bully\\" is first attested in 1710. In the past, in American culture, the term has been used differently, as an exclamation/exhortation, in particular famously associated with Theodore RooseveltTR Correspondence 27 September 1907 \\"bully for you\\" in the positive sense and continuing to the present in the bully pulpit, Roosevelt's coining and also as faint/deprecating praise (\\"bully for him\\").  Types  Bullying has been classified by the body of literature into different types. These can be in the form of nonverbal, verbal, or physical behavior. Another classification is based on perpetrators or the participants involved, so that the types include individual and collective bullying. Other interpretation also cite emotional and relational bullying in addition to physical harm inflicted towards another person or even property. There is also the case of the more recent phenomenon called cyberbullying. Physical, verbal, and relational bullying are most prevalent in primary school and could also begin much earlier while continuing into later stages in individuals lives.  Individual  Individual bullying tactics are perpetrated by a single person against a target or targets. Individual bullying can be classified into four types outlined below: = Physical = Physical bullying is any bullying that hurts someone's body or damages their possessions. Stealing, shoving, hitting, fighting, and intentionally destroying someone's property are types of physical bullying. Physical bullying is rarely the first form of bullying that a target will experience. Often bullying will begin in a different form and later progress to physical violence. In physical bullying the main weapon the bully uses is his/her body, or some part thereof, when attacking his/her target. Sometimes groups of young adults will target and alienate a peer because of some adolescent prejudice. This can quickly lead to a situation where they are being taunted, tortured, and \\"beaten up\\" by their classmates. Physical bullying will often escalate over time, and can lead to a detrimental ending, and therefore many try to stop it quickly to prevent any further escalation. = Verbal = Verbal bullying is one of the most common types of bullying. This is any bullying that is conducted by speaking or other use of the voice and does not involve any physical contact. Verbal bullying includes any of the following: *Derogatory name-calling and nicknaming *Spreading rumors or lying about someone *Threatening someone *Yelling at or talking to someone in a rude or unkind tone of voice, especially without justifiable cause *Mocking someone's voice or style of speaking *Laughing at someone *Making insults or otherwise making fun of someone In verbal bullying, the main weapon the bully uses is voice. In many cases, verbal bullying is common in both genders, but girls are more likely to perform it. Girls, in general, are more subtle with insults than boys. Girls use verbal bullying, as well as social exclusion techniques, to dominate and control other individuals and show their superiority and power. However, there are also many boys with subtlety enough to use verbal techniques for domination, and who are practiced in using words when they want to avoid the trouble that can come with physically bullying someone else. = Relational = Relational bullying or sometimes referred to as social aggression is the type of bullying that uses relationships to hurt others. The term also denotes any bullying that is done with the intent to hurt somebody's reputation or social standing which can also link in with the techniques included in physical and verbal bullying. Relational bullying is a form of bullying common among youth, but particularly upon girls. Social exclusion (slighting or making someone feel \\"left out\\") is one of the most common types of relational bullying. Relational bullying can be used as a tool by bullies to both improve their social standing and control others. Unlike physical bullying which is obvious, relational bullying is not overt and can continue for a long time without being noticed. = Cyberbullying = Cyberbullying is the use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. When an adult is involved, it may meet the definition of cyber-harassment or cyberstalking, a crime that can have legal consequences and involve jail time. This includes bullying by use of email, instant messaging, social media websites (such as Facebook), text messages, and cell phones. It is stated that Cyberbullying is more common in secondary school than in primary school.  Collective  Collective bullying tactics are employed by more than one individual against a target or targets. Collective bullying is known as mobbing, and can include any of the individual types of bullying. Trolling behavior on social media, although generally assumed to be individual in nature by the casual reader, is sometime organized efforts by sponsored astroturfers. = Mobbing = Mobbing refers to the bullying of an individual by a group, in any context, such as a family, peer group, school, workplace, neighborhood, community, or online. When it occurs as emotional abuse in the workplace, such as \\"ganging up\\" by co- workers, subordinates or superiors, to force someone out of the workplace through rumor, innuendo, intimidation, humiliation, discrediting, and isolation, it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial/racial, general harassment.Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace by Noa Davenport, Ruth D. Schwartz and Gail Pursell Elliott.  Characteristics = Of bullies and accomplices  Studies have shown that envy and resentment may be motives for bullying. Research on the self-esteem of bullies has produced equivocal results. While some bullies are arrogant and narcissistic, they can also use bullying as a tool to conceal shame or anxiety or to boost self-esteem: by demeaning others, the abuser feels empowered. Bullies may bully out of jealousy or because they themselves are bullied. Psychologist Roy Baumeister asserts that people who are prone to abusive behavior tend to have inflated but fragile egos. Because they think too highly of themselves, they are frequently offended by the criticisms and lack of deference of other people, and react to this disrespect with violence and insults.Roy Baumeister. Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty Researchers have identified other risk factors such as depression and personality disorders, as well as quickness to anger and use of force, addiction to aggressive behaviors, mistaking others' actions as hostile, concern with preserving self-image, and engaging in obsessive or rigid actions. A combination of these factors may also be causes of this behavior. In one study of youth, a combination of antisocial traits and depression was found to be the best predictor of youth violence, whereas video game violence and television violence exposure were not predictive of these behaviors. Bullying may also result from a genetic predisposition or a brain abnormality in the bully. While parents can help a toddler develop emotional regulation and control to restrict aggressive behavior, some children fail to develop these skills due to insecure attachment with their families, ineffective discipline, and environmental factors such as a stressful home life and hostile siblings. Moreover, according to some researchers, bullies may be inclined toward negativity and perform poorly academically. Dr. Cook says, \\"A typical bully has trouble resolving problems with others and also has trouble academically. He or she usually has negative attitudes and beliefs about others, feels negatively toward himself/herself, comes from a family environment characterized by conflict and poor parenting, perceives school as negative and is negatively influenced by peers.\\" Contrarily, some researchers have suggested that some bullies are psychologically strongest and have high social standing among their peers, while their targets are emotionally distressed and socially marginalized.Juvonen (2003) Bullying Among Young Adolescents: The Strong, the Weak and the Troubled in Pediatrics, December 2003, Peer groups often promote the bully's actions, and members of these peer groups also engage in behaviors, such as mocking, excluding, punching, and insulting one another as a source of entertainment. Other researchers also argued that a minority of the bullies, those who are not in-turn bullied, enjoy going to school, and are least likely to take days off sick. Research indicates that adults who bully have authoritarian personalities, combined with a strong need to control or dominate. It has also been suggested that a prejudicial view of subordinates can be a particularly strong risk factor. Brain studies have shown that the section of the brain associated with reward becomes active when bullies are shown a video of someone inflecting pain on another.  Of typical bystanders  Often, bullying takes place in the presence of a large group of relatively uninvolved bystanders. In many cases, it is the bully's ability to create the illusion they have the support of the majority present that instills the fear of \\"speaking out\\" in protestation of the bullying activities being observed by the group. Unless the \\"bully mentality\\" is effectively challenged in any given group in its early stages, it often becomes an accepted, or supported, norm within the group. Unless action is taken, a \\"culture of bullying\\" is often perpetuated within a group for months, years, or longer. Bystanders who have been able to establish their own \\"friendship group\\" or \\"support group\\" have been found to be far more likely to opt to speak out against bullying behavior than those who have not. In addition to communication of clear expectations that bystanders should intervene and increasing individual self-efficacy, there is growing research to suggest interventions should build on the foundation that bullying is morally wrong. Among adults, being a bystander to workplace bullying was linked to depression.  Of victims  Dr. Cook says, \\"A typical victim is likely to be aggressive, lack social skills, think negative thoughts, experience difficulties in solving social problems, come from a negative family, school and community environments and be noticeably rejected and isolated by peers.\\" Victims often have characteristics such as being physically and mentally weak, as well as being easily distraught emotionally. They may also have physical characteristics that make them easier targets for bullies such as being overweight or having some type of physical deformity. Boys are more likely to be victims of physical bullying while girls are more likely to be bullied indirectly. The results of a meta-analysis conducted by Cook and published by the American Psychological Association in 2010 concluded the main risk factors for children and adolescents being bullied, and also for becoming bullies, are the lack of social problem-solving skills. Children who are bullied often show physical or emotional signs, such as: being afraid to attend school, complaining of headaches or a loss of appetite, a lack of interest in school activities and spending time with friends or family, and having an overall sense of sadness.  Effects  Mona O'Moore of the Anti-Bullying Centre at Trinity College in Dublin, has written, \\"There is a growing body of research which indicates that individuals, whether child or adult, who are persistently subjected to abusive behavior are at risk of stress related illness which can sometimes lead to suicide.\\" Those who have been the targets of bullying can suffer from long term emotional and behavioral problems. Bullying can cause loneliness, depression, anxiety, lead to low self-esteem and increased susceptibility to illness. Bullying has also been shown to cause maladjustment in young children, and targets of bullying who were also bullies themselves exhibit even greater social difficulties. A mental health report also found that bullying was linked to eating disorders, anxiety, body dysmorphia and other negative psychological effects.  Suicide  Even though there is evidence that bullying increases the risk of suicide, bullying alone does not cause suicide. Depression is one of the main reasons why kids who are bullied die by suicide. It is estimated that between 15 and 25 children die by suicide every year in the UK alone because they are being bullied.Statistics on bullying Certain groups seem to incur a higher risk for suicide, such as Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, Asian Americans, and LGBT people. When someone feels unsupported by family or friends, it can make the situation much worse for the victim.Effects of Bullying  StopBullying.gov In a self-report study completed in New York by 9th through 12th graders, victims of bullying reported more depressive symptoms and psychological distress than those who did not experience bullying. All types of involvement in bullying among both boys and girls is associated with depression even a couple years later. Another study that followed up with Finnish teens two years after the initial survey showed that depression and suicidal ideation is higher with teens who are bullied than those who did not report experiencing bullying. A Dutch longitudinal study on elementary students reported that boys who are bully-victims, who play both roles of a victim and a bully, were more likely to experience depression or serious suicidal ideation than the other roles, victims or bullies only, while girls who have any involvement in bullying have a higher level of risk for depression. In a study of high school students completed in Boston, students who self reported being victims of bullying were more likely to consider suicide when compared to youth who did not report being bullied. The same study also showed a higher risk of suicidal consideration in youth who report being a perpetrator, victim, or victim- perpetrator. Victims and victim-bullies are associated with a higher risk of suicide attempts. The place where youth live also appears to differentiate their bullying experiences such that those living in more urban areas who reported both being bullied and bullying others appear to show higher risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. A national survey given to American 6th through 10th grade students found that cyberbullying victims experience a higher level of depression than victims experiencing other forms of bullying. This can be related to the anonymity behind social media. If a teen is being bullied and is displaying symptoms of depression it should be questioned and interventions should be implemented. The Danish study showed that kids who are bullied talked to their parents and teachers about it and some reported a decrease in bullying or a stop in the bullying after a teacher or parent intervened. The study emphasizes the importance of implementing program- collaborations in schools to have programs and anti-bullying interventions in place to prevent and properly intervene when it occurs. The study also shows the importance of having parents and teachers talk to the bullies about their bullying behavior in order to provide the necessary support for those experiencing bullying. While some people find it very easy to ignore a bully, others may find it very difficult and reach a breaking point. There have been cases of apparent bullying suicides that have been reported closely by the media. These include the deaths of Ryan Halligan, Phoebe Prince, Dawn-Marie Wesley, Nicola Ann Raphael, Megan Meier, Audrie Pott, Tyler Clementi, Jamey Rodemeyer, Kenneth Weishuhn, Jadin Bell, Kelly Yeomans, Rehtaeh Parsons, Amanda Todd, Brodie Panlock, Jessica Haffer, Hamed Nastoh, Sladjana Vidovic, April Himes, Cherice Moralez and Rebecca Ann Sedwick. According to the suicide awareness voices for education, suicide is one of the leading causes of death for youth from 15 to 24 years old. Over 16 percent of students seriously consider suicide, 13 percent create a plan, and 8 percent have made a serious attempt.  Positive development  Some have argued that bullying can teach life lessons and instill strength. Helene Guldberg, a child development academic, sparked controversy when she argued that being a target of bullying can teach a child \\"how to manage disputes and boost their ability to interact with others\\", and that teachers should not intervene but leave children to respond to the bullying themselves. The teaching of such anti-bullying coping skills to \\"would-be-targets\\" and to others has been found to be an effective long term means of reducing bullying incidence rates and a valuable skill-set for individuals.Positive Anti-Bullying Strategies by Melissa Graham  Hormonal  Statistically controlling for age and pubertal status, results indicated that on average verbally bullied girls produced less testosterone, and verbally bullied boys produced more testosterone than their nonbullied counterparts.  Dark triad  Research on the dark triad (narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy) indicate a correlation with bullying as part of evidence of the aversive nature of those traits.  Projection  A bully may project his/her own feelings of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite the fact that a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability.Paul Gilbert, Overcoming Depression (1999) p.185‚Äì6 Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.Carl G. Jung ed., Man and his Symbols (London 1978) p.181‚Äì2  Emotional intelligence  Bullying is abusive social interaction between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of power over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence (EI). Mayer et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as \\"accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion\\". The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes. Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and victimization in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.  Context = Cyberbullying  Cyberbullying is any bullying done through the use of technology. This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of lack of parental/authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Cyberbullying includes, but is not limited to, abuse using email, instant messaging, text messaging, websites, social networking sites, etc. With the creation of social networks like Facebook, Myspace, Instagram, and Twitter, cyberbullying has increased. Particular watchdog organizations have been designed to contain the spread of cyberbullying.  Disability bullying  It has been noted that disabled people are disproportionately affected by bullying and abuse, and such activity has been cited as a hate crime. The bullying is not limited to those who are visibly disabled, such as wheelchair-users or physically deformed such as those with a cleft lip, but also those with learning disabilities, such as autism and developmental coordination disorder. There is an additional problem that those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people, so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.  Gay bullying  Gay bullying and gay bashing designate direct or indirect verbal or physical actions by a person or group against someone who is gay or lesbian, or perceived to be so due to rumors or because they are considered to fit gay stereotypes. Gay and lesbian youth are more likely than straight youth to report bullying, as well as be bullied.  Legal bullying  Legal bullying is the bringing of a vexatious legal action to control and punish a person. Legal bullying can often take the form of frivolous, repetitive, or burdensome lawsuits brought to intimidate the defendant into submitting to the litigant's request, not because of the legal merit of the litigant's position, but principally due to the defendant's inability to maintain the legal battle. This can also take the form of Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP). It was partially concern about the potential for this kind of abuse that helped to fuel the protests against SOPA and PIPA in the United States in 2011 and 2012.  Military bullying  In 2000, the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) defined bullying as \\"the use of physical strength or the abuse of authority to intimidate or victimize others, or to give unlawful punishments\\". Some argue that this behaviour should be allowed, due to ways in which \\"soldiering\\" is different from other occupations. Soldiers expected to risk their lives should, according to them, develop strength of body and spirit to accept bullying.  Parental bullying of children  Parents who may displace their anger, insecurity, or a persistent need to dominate and control upon their children in excessive ways have been proven to increase the likelihood that their own children will in turn become overly aggressive or controlling towards their peers. The American Psychological Association advises on its website that parents who may suspect their own children may be engaging in bullying activities among their peers should carefully consider the examples which they themselves may be setting for their own children regarding how they typically interact with their own peers, colleagues, and children.  Prison bullying  The prison environment is known for bullying. An additional complication is the staff and their relationships with the inmates. Thus, the following possible bullying scenarios are possible: * Inmate bullies inmate (echoing school bullying) * Staff bullies inmate * Staff bullies staff (a manifestation of workplace bullying) * Inmate bullies staff  School bullying (bullying of students in schools)  Bullying can occur in nearly any part in or around the school building, although it may occur more frequently during physical education classes and activities such as recess. Bullying also takes place in school hallways, bathrooms, on school buses and while waiting for buses, and in classes that require group work and/or after school activities. Bullying in school sometimes consists of a group of students taking advantage of or isolating one student in particular and gaining the loyalty of bystanders who want to avoid becoming the next target. In the 2011 documentary Bully, we see first hand the torture that kids go through both in school and while on the school bus. As the movie follows around a few kids we see how bullying affects them both at school as well as in their homes. While bullying has no age limit, these bullies may taunt and tease their target before finally physically bullying them. Bystanders typically choose to either participate or watch, sometimes out of fear of becoming the next target. Bullying can also be perpetrated by teachers and the school system itself; there is an inherent power differential in the system that can easily predispose to subtle or covert abuse (relational aggression or passive aggression), humiliation, or exclusion‚Äîeven while maintaining overt commitments to anti-bullying policies. In 2016, in Canada, a North American legal precedent was set by a mother and her son, after the son was bullied in his public school. The mother and son won a court case against the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, making this the first case in North America where a school board has been found negligent in a bullying case for failing to meet the standard of care (the \\"duty of care\\" that the school board owes to its students). Thus, it sets a precedent of a school board being found liable in negligence for harm caused to a child, because they failed to protect a child from the bullying actions of other students. There has been only one other similar bullying case and it was won in Australia in 2013 (Oyston v. St. Patricks College, 2013).  Sexual bullying  Sexual bullying is \\"any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls ‚Äì although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology.\\"  Trans bullying  Trans bashing is the act of victimizing a person physically, sexually, or verbally because they are transgender or transsexual.Guilty plea over transsexual bashing By Mariza O'Keefe in Herald Sun Unlike gay bashing, it is committed because of the target's actual or perceived gender identity, not sexual orientation.  Workplace bullying  Workplace bullying occurs when an employee experiences a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes harm.Rayner, C. & Keashley, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox & P. E. Spector (eds.) Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets (pp. 271-296). Washington DC: American Psychological Association. Workplace bullying can include such tactics as verbal, nonverbal, psychological, physical abuse and humiliation. This type of workplace aggression is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical forms of school bullying, workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. Bullying in the workplace is in the majority of cases reported as having been perpetrated by someone in authority over the target. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally can be subordinates.Rayner, C., & Cooper, C. L. (2006). Workplace Bullying. In Kelloway, E., Barling, J. & Hurrell Jr., J. (eds.), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 47-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. The first known documented use of \\"workplace bullying\\" is in 1992 in a book by Andrea Adams called Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It. Google ngramsAdams, Andrea with contributions from Crawford, Neil Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It (1992) Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group- level processes that impact on the incidence, and maintenance of bullying behavior.Ramsay, S., Troth, A & Branch, S . (2010). Work-place bullying: A group processes framework Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84(4), 799-816. Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors or known by many throughout the organization. Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in employee morale and a change in organizational culture. A Cochrane Collaboration systematic review has found very low quality evidence to suggest that organizational and individual interventions may prevent bullying behaviors in the workplace. = In academia = Bullying in academia is workplace bullying of scholars and staff in academia, especially places of higher education such as colleges and universities. It is believed to be common, although has not received as much attention from researchers as bullying in some other contexts. = In blue collar jobs = Bullying has been identified as prominent in blue collar jobs, including on oil rigs and in mechanic shops and machine shops. It is thought that intimidation and fear of retribution cause decreased incident reports. In industry sectors dominated by males, typically of little education, where disclosure of incidents are seen as effeminate, reporting in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries would likely lead to a vicious circle. This is often used in combination with manipulation and coercion of facts to gain favour among higher-ranking administrators. = In information technology = A culture of bullying is common in information technology (IT), leading to high sickness rates, low morale, poor productivity, and high staff-turnover. Deadline-driven project work and stressed-out managers take their toll on IT workers. = In the legal profession = Bullying in the legal profession is believed to be more common than in some other professions. It is believed that its adversarial, hierarchical tradition contributes towards this.Le Mire, Suzanne; Owens, Rosemary A propitious moment?: Workplace bullying and regulation of the legal profession University of New South Wales Law Journal, The Volume 37 Issue 3 (Dec 2014) Women, trainees and solicitors who have been qualified for five years or less are more impacted, as are ethnic minority lawyers and lesbian, gay and bisexual lawyers.Society publishes guidance on tackling bullying in solicitor profession The Journal of the Law Society of Scotland 27 June 2011 = In medicine = Bullying in the medical profession is common, particularly of student or trainee doctors and of nurses. It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional hierarchical structures and teaching methods in the medical profession, which may result in a bullying cycle. = In nursing = Even though The American Nurses Association believes that all nursing personnel have the right to work in safe, non-abusive environments, bullying has been identified as being particularly prevalent in the nursing profession although the reasons are not clear. It is thought that relational aggression (psychological aspects of bullying such as gossiping and intimidation) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied among girls but not so much among adult women.http://www.nursingworld.org/Bullying-Workplace-Violence Workplace Violence Statistics = In teaching = School teachers are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.  In other areas  As the verb to bully is defined as simply \\"forcing one's way aggressively or by intimidation\\", the term may generally apply to any life experience where one is motivated primarily by intimidation instead of by more positive goals, such as mutually shared interests and benefits. As such, any figure of authority or power who may use intimidation as a primary means of motivating others, such as a neighborhood \\"protection racket don\\", a national dictator, a childhood ring- leader, a terrorist, a terrorist organization, or even a ruthless business CEO, could rightfully be referred to as a bully. According to psychologist Pauline Rennie-Peyton, we each face the possibility of being bullied in any phase of our lives.  Machines  Children have been observed bullying anthropomorphic robots designed to assist the elderly. Their attacks start with blocking the robots' paths of movement and then escalate to verbal abuse, hitting and destroying the object. Seventy-five percent of the kids interviewed perceived the robot as \\"human-like\\" yet decided to abuse it anyway, while 35% of the kids who beat up the robot did so \\"for enjoyment\\".  Prevention  Bullying prevention is the collective effort to prevent, reduce and stop bullying. Many campaigns and events are designated to bullying prevention throughout the world. Bullying prevention campaigns and events include: Anti-Bullying Day, Anti-Bullying Week, International Day of Pink, International STAND UP to Bullying Day and National Bullying Prevention Month. Anti-Bullying laws in the U.S. have also been enacted in 23 of its 50 states, making bullying in schools illegal.  Responding to bullying  Bullying is typically ongoing and not isolated behaviour. Common ways that people try to respond, are to try to ignore it, to confront the bullies or to turn to an authority figure to try to address it. Ignoring it often does nothing to stop the bullying continuing, and it can become worse over time.W. Craig et al., \\"Responding to bullying, what works\\" It can be important to address bullying behaviour early on, as it can be easier to control the earlier it is detected.W. Ci, \\"What can be done to stop bullying among children? Evidence from Canada\\" Bystanders play an important role in responding to bullying, as doing nothing can encourage it to continue, while small steps that oppose the behaviour can reduce it.Bully-zero Australia Foundation, \\"Respond to bullying\\" Authority figures can play an important role, such as parents in child or adolescent situations, or supervisors, human-resources staff or parent-bodies in workplace and volunteer settings. Authority figures can be influential in recognising and stopping bullying behaviour, and creating an environment where it doesn't continue.\\"Stop bullying on the spot\\"Safe work Australia, \\"Guide for preventing and responding to workplace bullying\\" In many situations however people acting as authority figures are untrained and unqualified, do not know how to respond, and can make the situation worse.Veronica Birkett, \\"Bullied? Don't tell the teacher\\" In some cases the authority figures even support the people doing the bullying, facilitating it continuing and increasing the isolation and marginalising of the target.\\"Responding to bullying in Arc UNSW sports\\" Some of the most effective ways to respond, are to recognise that harmful behaviour is taking place, and creating an environment where it won't continue.E. Field, \\"The prevalence of workplace bullying in Australia\\" People who are being targeted have little control over which authority figures they can turn to and how such matters would be addressed, however one means of support is to find a counsellor or psychologist who is trained in handling bullying.

Life Very little is known about the actual life of Yagy≈´ Mitsuyoshi as the official records of his life are very sparse. Yagy≈´ J≈´bei Mitsuyoshi (born \\"Shichir≈ç\\") grew up in his family's ancestral lands, Yagy≈´ no Sato, now in Nara. He was the son of Yagy≈´ Tajima no Kami Munenori, master swordsman of the Tokugawa sh≈çguns, especially Ieyasu and Tokugawa Iemitsu, who prized Munenori as one of his top Counselors . Munenori fought for the first Tokugawa sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, at the Battle of Sekigahara, expanding the sh≈çgun's territory. For his efforts, Munenori was made the sh≈çgun's sword instructor and a minor daimy≈ç (provincial ruler), by extending his family hereditary domain up to 10,000 koku. Despite not being the heir of his father as the headmaster of the Yagy≈´ style (and thus far from being an unrivaled swordsman under the Heaven), he received the post for its importance in Japanese politics and Court intrigues, at which Munenori was better than the other members of his clan. Munenori would go on to train three successive Shoguns: Ieyasu, Hidetada, and Iemitsu. In 1616, Mitsuyoshi became an attendant in the court of the second Tokugawa Sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Hidetada and became a sword instructor for the third Tokugawa Sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Iemitsu, occasionally filling his father's role. Records of Yagy≈´ J≈´bei Mitsuyoshi, however, do not appear again until 1631, when J≈´bei, by now regarded as the best swordsman from the Yagy≈´ clan, is summarily and inexplicably dismissed by the Sh≈çgun either due to J≈´bei's boldness and brashness or his decision to embark on a Warrior's Pilgrimage (, Musha Shugy≈ç). His whereabouts are then unknown over the next twelve years‚Äîeven the Yagy≈´ clan's secret chronicles, which contained lengthy passages on numerous members, has little solid information on J≈´bei‚Äîuntil Yagy≈´ J≈´bei reappears at the age of 36 at a demonstration of swordsmanship in front of the Sh≈çgun. Following this exhibition, J≈´bei was reinstated and serves for a short time as a government-inspector (, Gosho Inban), taking control over his father's lands until Yagy≈´ Tajima no Kami Munenori's death in 1646. J≈´bei also authored a treatise known as Tsuki no Sh≈ç () or The Art of Looking at the Moon outlining his school of swordsmanship as well as teachings influenced by the monk Takuan S≈çh≈ç who was a friend of his father's. In this work he briefly provides hints on his whereabouts during his absence from Edo Castle from 1631 to 1643 ‚Äì traveling the countryside in perfecting his skills. Death After residing in Edo for several years after his father's death, J≈´bei left his government duties and returned to his home village where he died in early 1650 under uncertain circumstances. Some accounts say he died of a heart attack; others say he died while falcon hunting; some during fishing, while still others presume he was assassinated by his half-brother Yagy≈´ Tomonori's attendants. J≈´bei was laid to rest in his home village of Yagyu behind the family temple of Hotojukuji alongside his father and brother. In keeping with tradition, Yagy≈´ J≈´bei was buried alongside his grandfather, Yagy≈´ Munetoshi, and was survived by two daughters and his brother and successor Yagy≈´ Munefuyu. J≈´bei was given the Buddhist posthumous name of Sohgo. Eyepatch legend Legend has it that Yagy≈´ J≈´bei had the use of only one eye; most legends state that he lost it in a sword sparring session where his father, Yagy≈´ Munenori, struck him accidentally. However, portraits from Jubei's time portray him as having both eyes. Several authors of late have chosen to portray J≈´bei as having both eyes, though the classical \\"eyepatch\\" look remains standard. Others have chosen to have J≈´bei lose an eye as an adult in order to incorporate the eyepatch legend. Fictional Appearances Due to Yagy≈´ J≈´bei's frequent disappearances and the fact of little existing records of his whereabouts, his life has bred speculation and interest and has been romanticized in popular fiction. *J≈´shir≈ç Konoe played the role of Yagy≈´ J≈´bei in 11 films and 27 TV episodes: ** Yagyu Tabi Nikki (Êü≥ÁîüÊóÖÊó•Ë®ò) Shochiku film series *** Yagyu Travel Journal 1: Heaven and Earth Dream Sword (Êü≥ÁîüÊóÖÊó•Ë®ò Â§©Âú∞Â§¢ÊÉ≥Ââ£) (1959) *** Yagyu Travel Journal 2: Dragon Tiger Killing Sword (Êü≥ÁîüÊóÖÊó•Ë®ò Á´úËôéÊ¥ªÊÆ∫Ââ£) (1960) ** Yagyu Bugeicho (Êü≥ÁîüÊ≠¶Ëä∏Â∏≥) Toei film series *** Yagyu Chronicles 1: The Secret Scrolls (Êü≥ÁîüÊ≠¶Ëä∏Â∏≥) (1961) *** Yagyu Chronicles 2: The Secret Sword (Êü≥ÁîüÊ≠¶Ëä∏Â∏≥ Â§ú„Åñ„Åè„ÇâÁßòÂâ£) (1961) *** Yagyu Chronicles 3: The Valley of Outlaws (Êü≥Áîü‰∏ÄÁï™ÂãùË≤† ÁÑ°È†º„ÅÆË∞∑) (1961) *** Yagyu Chronicles 4: One-Eyed Swordsman (Êü≥ÁîüÊ≠¶Ëä∏Â∏≥ Áã¨Áúº‰∏ÄÂàÄÊµÅ) (1962) *** Yagyu Chronicles 5: Jubei's Redemption (Êü≥ÁîüÊ≠¶Ëä∏Â∏≥ ÁâáÁõÆ„ÅÆÂçÅÂÖµË°õ) (1963) *** Yagyu Chronicles 6: The Yagyu Scroll (Êü≥ÁîüÊ≠¶Ëä∏Â∏≥ ÁâáÁõÆÊ∞¥Êúà„ÅÆÂâ£) (1963) *** Yagyu Chronicles 7: The Cloud of Disorder (Êü≥ÁîüÊ≠¶Ëä∏Â∏≥ Ââ£Ë±™‰π±„ÇåÈõ≤) (1963) *** Yagyu Chronicles 8: The One-Eyed Ninja (Êü≥ÁîüÊ≠¶Ëä∏Â∏≥ ÁâáÁõÆ„ÅÆÂøçËÄÖ) (1963) *** Yagyu Chronicles 9: Assassin's Sword (ÂçÅÂÖµË°õÊöóÊÆ∫Ââ£) (1964) ** Yagyu Bugeicho (Êü≥ÁîüÊ≠¶Ëä∏Â∏≥) (1965) NET TV series - 26 episodes ** Shadow Assassins (ÂøçÊ≥ï„Åã„Åí„Çç„ÅÜÊñ¨„Çä) (1972) Kansai TV TV series - 1 episode (#22) *G≈ç Wakabayashi played the role of Yagy≈´ J≈´bei in 23 TV episodes and 1 TV movie: ** Edo is Cut: Azusa Ukon's Secret Spy Chronicles (Ê±üÊà∏„ÇíÊñ¨„Çã Ê¢ìÂè≥ËøëÈö†ÂØÜÂ∏≥) (1973-1974) TBS TV series - 7 episodes ** Hikozaemon Okubo (Â§ß‰πÖ‰øùÂΩ¶Â∑¶Ë°õÈñÄ) (1974) Kansai TV TV series - 1 episode (#31) ** Tokugawa Sangokushi (Âæ≥Â∑ù‰∏âÂõΩÂøó) (1975) NET TV series - 15 episodes ** Kanei Chronicles: Clash!

Released on March 27, 1998, in Japan (November 2, 1998, in North America), it was intended as an exercise toy and mentioned by Guinness World Records as the most popular exercise toy of its time. Gameplay The first release, a yellow unit resembling a Game Boy, features a black and white LCD screen used to display animations of Pikachu's activities. Gameplay differs slightly from other portable virtual pets in that Pikachu does not need to be fed, watered, or cleaned up after. Instead, the Pok√©mon Pikachu unit can be strapped to a belt and used as a pedometer. With every twenty steps it counts, the Pok√©mon Pikachu credits its user with one watt, a virtual currency used to buy Pikachu presents. Additional activities become available as the player spends more time with their virtual Pikachu. If neglected, Pikachu will express anger and eventually refuse to recognize the player. The second release, Pok√©mon Pikachu 2 GS, is available in clear and silver casing with a color display featuring more animations. It features an infrared port for interacting with Pok√©mon Gold, Silver, and Crystal via the Mystery Gift option, which utilizes the Game Boy Color's built-in infrared communication port. This allows players to trade watts for items in the Game Boy games. Although there is a limitation on how much the Mystery Gift mode can be used between Game Boy cartridges, Pok√©mon Pikachu's only limit is that of available watts. Watts can also be sent to other Pok√©mon Pikachu 2 units. Other models Pok√©mon and its character Pikachu are not the only media franchises that are used by this Nintendo-made device. Sakura Taisen, a media franchise of SEGA and licensed by RED Entertainment released a virtual-pet with pedometer in the same style as the Pok√©mon Pikachu 2 called Pocket Sakura („Éù„Ç±„ÉÉ„Éà„Çµ„ÇØ„É©). It was released alongside Sakura Taisen GB; they were developed by Jupiter. Sega could not publish either of them because they were rivals at the time with Nintendo, so publishing was handled by Media Factory. Similarly, Sanrio, responsible for the Hello Kitty franchise, licensed to Nintendo the development of the Pocket Hello Kitty. This featured a similar design to the first Pok√©mon Pikachu, with a game based on Hello Kitty and her friends, available in a pink-colored case. Pok√©walker A device similar to the Pok√©mon Pikachu, called the Pok√©walker, comes packaged with Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver and communicates directly with the game cards via infrared. It allows the player to transfer one Pok√©mon at a time from their HeartGold or SoulSilver. The user is able to catch Pok√©mon and find items by spending watts.

Strengthened by a series of 20th century revivals, traditional folk music has a popular following. It is accompanied by traditions of brass and silver bands, male voice choirs, classical, electronic and popular music. History In medieval Cornwall there are records of performances of ‚ÄòMiracle Plays‚Äô in the Cornish language, with considerable musical involvement. Also (as frequently mentioned in the Launceston borough accounts) minstrels were hired to play for saints day celebrations. The richest families (including Arundell, Bodrugan, Bottreaux, Grenville, and Edgcumbe) retained their own minstrels, and many others employed minstrels on a casual basis. There were vigorous traditions of Morris dancing, mumming, guise dancing, and social dance.Hays, R. & McGee, C.; Joyce, S. & Newlyn, E. eds. (1999) Records of Early English Drama; Dorset & Cornwall Toronto: U.P. During the Twelve Days of Christmas between 1466-67, the household accounts of the Arundells of Lanherne, Mawgan-in-Pydar, record expenditures to buy white bonnets for minstrels, cloth and bells for Morris dancers, as well as materials for costumes for the \\"disgysing\\" (mummers or guise dancers), an activity which involved music and dancing. Then followed a long period of contention which included the Cornish Rebellion of 1497, the 1549 Prayer Book Rebellion, the Persecution of Recusants, the Poor Laws, and the English Civil War and Commonwealth (1642‚Äì1660). The consequences of these events disadvantaged many gentry who had previously employed their own minstrels or patronised itinerant performers. Over the same period in art music the use of modes was largely supplanted by use of major and minor keys. Altogether it was an extended cultural revolution, and it is unlikely that there were not musical casualties.O'Connor, M. J. (2005) Ilow Kernow; 3 St Ervan: Lyngham House 18th and 19th centuries A number of manuscripts of dance music from the period 1750 to 1850 have been found which tell of renewed patronage, employment of dancing masters, and a repertoire that spanned class barriers. Seasonal and community festivals, mumming and guise dancing all flourished.O'Connor, M. J. (2007) \\"An Overview of Recent Discoveries in Cornish Music\\", in: \\"Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall\\". Truro: R. I. C. In the 19th century, the nonconformist and temperance movements were strong: these frowned on dancing and music, encouraged the demise of many customs, but fostered the choral and brass band traditions. Some traditional tunes were used for hymns and carols. Church Feast Days and Sunday School treats were widespread‚Äîa whole village processing behind a band of musicians leading them to a picnic site, where \\"Tea Treat Buns\\" (made with smuggled saffron) were distributed. This left a legacy of marches and polkas. Records exist of dancing in farmhouse kitchens, and in fish cellars Cornish ceilidhs called troyls were common, they are analogous to the fest-noz of the Bretons. Some community events survived, such as at Padstow and at Helston, where to this day, on 8 May, the townspeople dance the Furry Dance through the streets, in and out of shops, even through private houses. Thousands converge on Helston to witness the spectacle. The \\"Sans Day Carol\\" or \\"St Day Carol\\" is one of the many Cornish Christmas carols written in the 19th century. This carol and its melody were first transcribed from the singing of a villager in St Day in the parish of Gwennap: the lyrics are similar to those of \\"The Holly and the Ivy\\". In Anglican churches the church bands (a few local musicians providing accompaniment in services) were replaced by keyboard instruments (harmonium, piano or organ) and singing in unison became more usual. Vocal music Folk songs include \\"Sweet Nightingale\\", \\"Little Eyes\\", and \\"Lamorna\\". Few traditional Cornish lyrics survived the decline of the language. In some cases lyrics of common English songs became attached to older Cornish tunes. Some folk tunes have Cornish lyrics written since the language revival of the 1920s. Sport has also been an outlet for many Cornish folk songs, and Trelawny, the unofficial Cornish national anthem, is often sung by Cornish rugby fans, along with other favourites such as \\"Camborne Hill\\" and \\"The White Rose\\". The Cornish anthem that has been used by Gorseth Kernow for the last 75 plus years is \\"Bro Goth Agan Tasow\\" (\\"The Land of My Fathers\\", or, literally, \\"Old Country of our Fathers\\") with a similar tune to the Welsh national anthem (\\"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau\\") and the Breton national anthem (\\"Bro Gozh ma Zado√π\\"). \\"Bro Goth Agan Tasow\\" is not heard so often, as it is sung in Cornish. Another popular Cornish anthem is \\"Hail to the Homeland\\". Sabine Baring-Gould compiled Songs of the West, which contains folk songs from Devon and Cornwall, in collaboration with Henry Fleetwood Sheppard and F. W. Bussell. Songs of the West was published by Methuen in conjunction with Watey and Willis; the first edition appeared both as a four-part set, undated, and as one volume dated 1895. In a new edition songs omitted from the first edition were listed, and the music was edited by Cecil Sharp. The second edition mentions the third collaborator, the Rev. Dr. F. W. Bussell, a scholarly eccentric who later became Vice-President of Brasenose College, Oxford. Sheppard was Rector of Thurnscoe, Yorkshire, and his parochial duties limited the amount of time he could spend on the work. In Plymouth City Library are two manuscript volumes containing the material as collected, in all 202 songs with music. In the published work it was necessary to bowdlerise some songs so that the book would be acceptable to respectable Victorians.Purcell, William (1957) Onward Christian Soldier. London: Longmans, Green; pp. 145-48 In Cornwall, the carol \\"While shepherds watched their flocks\\" is popularly sung to \\"Lyngham\\", a tune usually associated with \\"O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing\\". Another tune traditionally used for it in Cornwall is \\"Northrop\\".The English Hymnal, 1907; p. 903 Dances Cornish dancers Cornish dances include community dances such a 'furry dances', social (set) dances, linear and circle dances originating in carols and farandoles, and step dances ‚Äì often competitive. Among the social dances is 'Joan Sanderson', the cushion dance from the 19th century, but with 17th-century origins. The English composer Sir Malcolm Arnold composed \\"Four Cornish Dances\\" in 1966 which is influenced by characteristically Cornish types of music.Four Cornish Dances; Faber Music Breton connection Cornish music is often noted for its similarity to that of Brittany; some older songs and carols share the same root as Breton tunes. From Cornwall, Brittany was more easily accessible than London. Breton and Cornish were (and are) mutually intelligible. There was much cultural and marital exchange between the two countries and this influenced both music and dance.Mathieson, K., ed. (2001) Celtic Music. San Francisco: Backbeat Books; pp 88-95  Instrumentation  Cornish musicians have used a variety of traditional instruments. Documentary sources and Cornish iconography (as at Altarnun church on Bodmin Moor and St. Mary's, Launceston) suggest a late- medieval line-up might include a crwth (or crowd, similar to a violin), bombarde (horn-pipe), bagpipes and harp. The crowdy crawn (a drum) with a crwth or fiddle were popular by the 19th century. In the 1920s there was a serious school of banjo playing in Cornwall. After 1945 accordions became progressively more popular, before being joined by the instruments of the 1980s folk revival. In recent years Cornish bagpipes have enjoyed a progressive revival. Modern Brenda Wootton, \\"The Voice of Cornwall\\", during a performance Modern Cornish musicians include the late Brenda Wootton (folksinger in Cornish and English), Dalla who specialised in Cornish Celtic dance music and also traditional songs in Cornish and in English, the Cornish- Breton family band Anao Atao, the late 1960s band The Onyx and the 1980s band Bucca. Recently bands Sacred Turf, Skwardya and Krena, have begun performing British folk rock in the Cornish language.Harvey, D. (2002) Celtic Geographies: old culture, new times. Routledge, pp. 223-24 Kyt Le Nen Davey, a multi-instrumental Cornish musician, established a not-for-profit collaborative organisation, Kesson, to distribute Cornish music to a world audience. Today, the site has moved with the times, and now provides individual track downloads, alongside traditional CD format. Pioneering Techno artist Richard D. James (aka Aphex Twin) is a contemporary Cornish musician, frequently naming tracks in the Cornish language. Along with friend and collaborator Luke Vibert and business partner Grant Wilson-Claridge, James has crafted a niche of 'Cornish Acid' affectionately identified with his home region. Bands such as Dalla and Sowena are associated with the nos lowen style of Cornish dance and music, which follows the Breton style of uncalled line dances. Troyls, usually called in a ceilidh style, occur across Cornwall with bands including the North Cornwall Ceilidh Band, The Brim, the Bolingey Troyl band, Hevva, Ros Keltek and Tros an Treys.Skwardya and Krena play rock, punk and garage music in the Cornish language. The Cornwall Songwriters organisation has since 2001 produced two folk operas 'The Cry of Tin' and 'Unsung Heroes'. Also Cornwall has a selection of up and coming young bands such as \\"Heart in One Hand\\" and \\"The small print\\". 3 Daft Monkeys (Tim Ashton, Athene Roberts, and Jamie Waters) combine vocals, fiddle, 12-string guitar, bass guitar and foot drum to play a fusion of Celtic, Balkan, Gypsy, Latino, dance, dub, punk, reggae and traditional folk music. The band have played at venues and festivals all over the UK and Europe, including Eden Project, the 2008 BBC Proms, Guilfest, Glastonbury Festival and the Beautiful Days festival, as well as supporting The Levellers. Crowns are a 'fish-punk' band originating from Launceston, playing a mix of traditional Cornish songs and their own compositions. They have played Reading and Leeds festivals, the Eden Sessions and gained support slots with The Pogues, Blink 182 and Brandon Flowers. Their music has featured on Radio 1 and XFm. The underground scene includes rappers Hedluv + Passman, multi-instrumentalist Julian Gaskell and alternative folk/skiffle duo Zapoppin‚Äô. Sic, the singer of the Dutch pagan folk band Omnia hails from Cornwall and wrote a song named Cornwall about his homeland. During gigs by Omnia the Cornish flag is displayed on stage when this song is performed. In 2012 the folksinger and writer Anna Clifford-Tait released 'Sorrow', a song written in Cornish and English. Fisherman's Friends is a male vocal group from Port Isaac specialising in the sea shanty repertoirehttps://thefishermansfriends.com/. The Cornwall Folk Festival has been held annually for more than three decades and in 2008 was staged at Wadebridge. Other festivals are the pan-Celtic Lowender Peran and midsummer festival Golowan.

It was also the largest single-day attack ever mounted by the Allies at Gallipoli, involving three divisions. The purpose of the attack was to remove the immediate Ottoman threat from the exposed Suvla landing and to link with the ANZAC sectors to the south. Launched on August 21, 1915, to coincide with the simultaneous attack on Hill 60, it was a costly failure, in which the Turks were forced to use all their reserves in \\"severe and bloody fighting\\" far into the night, with some Turkish trenches lost and retaken twice.

In August a new offensive, known as the Battle of Sari Bair, was opened at Suvla in an attempt to regain the initiative from the Ottomans. Two divisions of Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stopford's IX Corps were landed at Suvla on the night of 6 August while a simultaneous breakout was made from the long-stagnant Anzac sector to the south of Suvla. Scimitar Hill, so named because of its curved summit, and the neighbouring W Hills to the south were part of the Anafarta Spur that marked the southern edge of the Suvla sector. Their capture had originally been first-day (7 August) objectives but General Stopford was exceedingly hesitant about making any major advances without artillery support. Consequently, the troops of the British 11th (Northern) Division (which had made the initial landing on the night of 6 August) and the 10th (Irish) Division (which had landed the following morning) did not advance from the immediate environs of the beach until 8 August, by which time they were already exhausted from lack of water and being under constant shrapnel and sniper fire. On the morning of 9 August, the British made their first effort to advance towards the high ground to the east, a ridge called Tekke Tepe. Scimitar Hill, which guarded the approach to this ridge from the southwest along the Anafarta Spur, had been captured unopposed by the 6th Battalion, The East Yorkshire Regiment, on 8 August but was then abandoned. The British attempted to recapture the hill on 9 August and in the intense fighting it changed hands a number of times before the British were forced off around midday. Despite the arrival of reinforcements in the form of the 53rd (Welsh) Division on 9 August and the 54th (East Anglian) Division on 10 August, any hopes the British had of a swift victory at Suvla were now gone as the Ottomans consolidated their hold on the surrounding ridges. On 10 August the 53rd Division made another attack at Scimitar Hill, which was another massive failure for the British and effectively ruined the division as a fighting unit within two days of its landing. Battle On 15 August Stopford was sacked and Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle, commander of the 29th Division, was made temporary commander of IX Corps until Lieutenant-General Julian Byng could be sent from France. De Lisle abandoned any immediate thoughts of a major offensive ‚Äî preparations for a major push by the 54th Division had been made at great cost but little effect on 12 August. Instead, he intended to secure the ground he held and make a strong link to Anzac to the south, where, as at Suvla, the original August objectives had proven unreachable. This required the capture of Scimitar Hill, the W Hills and Hill 60. To make the attack from Suvla, De Lisle had the dismounted yeomanry of the 2nd Mounted Division and the 29th Division, which had moved from Helles where it had borne the brunt of the fighting since the landings of 25 April. The plan for 21 August was to attack Scimitar Hill with the 29th Division and the W Hills with the 11th Division, keeping the yeomanry in reserve near the beach. As was so often the case at Gallipoli, the preliminary artillery barrage looked impressive but achieved little. The British had no sight of their targets, which were obscured by mist and smoke, whereas the Ottoman artillery had a clear view of the entire Suvla battlefield and ample opportunity to register their targets. The 11th Division attempt to capture the W Hills, collapsed in confusion when confronted by an Ottoman strong-point and artillery fire. As a consequence when the 1st Battalion of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers managed to capture the summit of Scimitar Hill, they found themselves under fire from the defenders higher up the Anafarta Spur to the east and from the W Hills to the south. The Irish retreated from the summit while the undergrowth around them was set ablaze by the shellfire, incinerating the wounded as they lay helpless. Around the troops of the 2nd Mounted Division were ordered forward from their reserve position on Lala Baba, near the beach. They advanced, marching in formation, across the bed of a dry salt lake. By this time the air was clouded by mist and smoke so that they had little idea of where they were going. The of the five brigades formed in columns by regiment and, marching in extended order, were easy targets for the shrapnel. Most of them halted in the cover of Green Hill, west of Scimitar Hill but Brigadier-General Lord Longford, led his 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade in a charge over Green Hill and up to the summit of Scimitar Hill. Continuing on, Lord Longford was cut off and killed. The yeomanry too were driven from the summit. The attack at Scimitar Hill on 21 August was the last attempt by the British to advance at Suvla. The front line remained between Green Hill and Scimitar Hill for the remainder of the campaign until the evacuation on 20 December. Aftermath=Casualties In one day of fighting the British suffered 5,300 casualties out of the 14,300 soldiers who participated. Victoria Cross The only two Victoria Crosses awarded at Suvla were made for rescuing of wounded at Scimitar Hill, one on 9 August by Captain Percy Hansen and the other following the 21 August battle by Private Frederick Potts.

Holy Land Photographed by Daniel B. Shepp. 1894 Cana of Galilee (, ) is the location of the Marriage at Cana, at which the miracle of turning water into wine took place in the Gospel of John. The location is disputed, with the four primary locations being Kafr Kanna, Khirbet Qana and Reineh in Lower Galilee and Qana in Upper Galilee. The Arabic name \\"Qana al-Jalil\\" has been said to apply to a number of sites, but is of doubtful authenticity. The name possibly derives from the Hebrew or Aramaic word for reeds.  Written references to Cana =Biblical references Cana is very positively located in Shepherd's Historical Atlas, 1923: modern scholars are less sure. Among Christians and other students of the New Testament, Cana is best known as the place where, according to the Fourth Gospel, Jesus performed \\"the first of his signs\\", his first public miracle, the turning of a large quantity of water into wine at a wedding feast () when the wine provided by the bridegroom had run out. Although none of the synoptic gospels record the event, mainstream Christian tradition holds that this is the first public miracle of Jesus.Towner, W. S. (1996), Wedding, in P. J. Achtermeier (Ed.), Harper Collins Bible dictionary (pp. 1205‚Äì1206). San Francisco: Harper The other biblical references to Cana are also in John: , which mentions that Jesus is visiting Cana when he is asked to heal the son of a royal official at Capernaum; and , where it is mentioned that Nathanael (sometimes identified with the Bartholomew included in the synoptic gospels' lists of apostles) comes from Cana. The Book of Joshua mentions one city () and one brook (; ) named Kanah (Cana) ‚Äì neither is likely to be the Cana of Galilee. Other references In secular history, the annals of Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III, who conquered the Galilee in a 733 BC campaign, contain a badly preserved list of cities, also in , p. 61ff. that had been thought to mention a certain Kana.Benjamin Mazar identifies it with Cana \\"without doubt\\": In Digital Library for International Research Archive, Item #1599.The translations of the inscription by Smith, Rost and Oppenheim all sport the same name. * * Rost, Paul, chapter translator (orig. 1893). * A. Leo Oppenheim, chapter translator. It relates that six hundred fifty captives were taken there. However, a revised transliteration revealed the one well- preserved syllable to be Ku, not Ka. Flavius Josephus mentions more than one place named Cana. In the context of the Galilee, there are two mentions in his Life: one is a place on the road from Iulias, and the other is a place where he resided, about a day's walk from Tiberias. Locating Cana thumbright300pxMap of the Lower Galilee with possible locations of Cana: Kafr Kanna, blue; Khirbet Qana, red. There has been much speculation about where Cana might have been. In his Gospel, the author makes no claim to have been at the wedding. Many would regard the story of the wedding at Cana as of theological rather than historical or topographical significance; it is the first of the seven miraculous \\"signs\\" by which Jesus's divine status is attested, and around which the gospel is structured. The consensus of modern scholarship is that the Fourth Gospel was addressed to a group of Jewish Christians, and very possibly a group living in Judea province; so it is unlikely that the evangelist would have mentioned a place that did not exist. There is a minority view that the gospel was written for a gentile audience, and those who take this view assert that the description in the passage about the marriage at Cana of \\"six stone water jars there for the Jewish rites of purification\\", which does not reflect good knowledge of the actual ritual washing habits among Jews at the time, is specifically for a gentile audience, who would not know the topography of the Holy Land. On this hypothesis, the name \\"Cana\\" might have some purely symbolic significance. There are four primary locations which have been under consideration as the New Testament Cana: *Upper Galilee ** Qana, Lebanon *Lower Galilee ** Kafr Kanna, Israel (also spelled Kefar Kenna) *** Karm er-Ras, the western part of Kafr KannaAlexandre, Y. (2017). Karm er-Ras (Areas AB, AC): Final Report. Hadashot Arkheologiyot: Excavations and Surveys in Israel / ◊ó◊ì◊©◊ï◊™ ◊ê◊®◊õ◊ô◊ê◊ï◊ú◊ï◊í◊ô◊ï◊™: ◊ó◊§◊ô◊®◊ï◊™ ◊ï◊°◊ß◊®◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú, 129. Retrieved July 22, 2020, from www.jstor.org/stable/26693775 ** Khirbet Qana, Israel ** Ain Qana, Israel Qana, Lebanon The village of Qana, about from Tyre, Lebanon, is traditionally held to be the correct site by many Christians, and is Eusebius's pick in his 4th century Onomasticon. In times of peace, it is a popular tourist site commemorating the miracle. Kafr Kanna and Karm er- Ras The first time this site is associated with New Testament Cana is in a mid-17th century report to the Pope by Francesco Quaresimo, the papal emissary to Palestine, where he noted there were two possible candidates: Khirbet Qana and Kafr Kanna. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, a tradition dating back to the 8th century identifies Cana with the modern Arab town of Kafr Kanna, at the foot of the Nazareth range, about northeast of Nazareth. Some scholars believe, according to archaeological evidence, that the identification of Kafr Kanna was the result of the decline of Khirbet Qana beginning in the Mamluk period. They note that it was a common practice for new and more affluent and easily accessible sites to be established in place of old ones to accommodate increases in pilgrim traffic, particularly in the late Medieval and Ottoman periods. Karm er-Ras, the western part of Kafr Kanna, was recently excavated by Israeli archaeologist Yardenna Alexandre. The excavation revealed evidence of a substantial Roman village with a Jewish population which declined considerably in the Late Roman period, and which was finally abandoned in the Byzantine Period, explaining why the pilgrim route was shifted to Kafr Kanna. Alexandre believes the site is precisely identified by Josephus, but other scholars disagree. Khirbet Kana, Israel Another possible candidate is the ruined village of Khirbet Qana, meaning \\"the ruins of Cana.\\" Overlooking the Beit Netofa Valley from the north, it is located about north of Kafr Kanna and has been noticed by pilgrims since the 12th century or earlier. pp. 204-208. However, this could either be an ancient retention, as Edward Robinson maintained, or may have been attached to the place in conversation with querying pilgrims. This site is located on a limestone outcropping that rises above the floor of the Bet Netofa Valley, from Nazareth and northeast of Sepphoris in lower Galilee. It also has long been identified as the true location of New Testament Cana. Excavations by archaeologist Douglas Edwards of the University of Puget Sound and archaeologist Tom McCollough reveal architectural and numismatic remains demonstrating that the site contained a modest-sized village from the Hellenistic period onward (c. 200 BCE‚Äì650 CE), including a structure that bears similarities to Roman-period synagogues, and several mikveh pools for Jewish ceremonial bathing. Most importantly, they uncovered a cave complex on the south slope of the site that showed indications of use as a center for worship, including a sarcophagus lid or altar and a shelf that held two stone vessels in situ, and space for another four vessels, suggesting that Khirbet Kana was regarded as New Testament Cana from a very early time. Remains of an Arab village and a church or monastery were also uncovered immediately south of the cave complex. Other historical evidence from the Byzantine and Medieval periods show that Khirbet Kana was regarded as the true site of New Testament Cana from a very early period. A guidebook written by Theodosius between 517 and 527 CE titled The Layout of the Holy Land identifies Khirbet Kana and indicates that two of the vessels were still at the location. A pilgrim account written by Saewulf in 1101 to 1103 CE also identifies the site, as do Belard of Ascoli (c. 1155 CE) and Dominican friar Burchard of Mount Sion (1283 CE), and a map by noted cartographer Petrus Vesconte in 1321 CE. Burchard of Mount Sion describes a cave complex located there that was used as a veneration site: \\"the place is shown at this day where the six water pots stood, and the dining-room where the tables were placed.\\" Reineh, Israel Reineh in the 1870 PEF Survey of Palestine, showing Ain Kana, identified by Claude Reignier Conder as the location of biblical Cana. Just south of the town of Reineh, about a mile from Nazareth, a small spring named \\"Ain Kana\\" was identified in 1878 by Claude Reignier Conder as the location of Cana. Some early Christian pilgrim reports mention a spring in association with the Cana of Galilee, but no excavations have been conducted there yet. Ain Qana is considered by some to be a better candidate based on etymological grounds.

The investors withdrew support shortly after, and the former crew member took over ownership of the vessel. Aware fell into disrepair, and in 2010, the Bundaberg Magistrates Court fined the owner for failing to have the ship insured. According to the owner, the lack of facilities capable of handing the former patrol boat has made insurance inspections almost impossible.

After the death of his firstborn son Alfonso, a will was written in 1262 and created the kingdom to cede it to his son James. The disposition was maintained during successive versions of his will and so when James I died in 1276, the Crown of Aragon passed to his eldest son Peter, known as Peter III of Aragon or Peter the Great. The Kingdom of Majorca passed to James, who reigned under the name of James II of Majorca. After 1279, Peter III of Aragon established that the king of Majorca was a vassal to the king of Aragon. The title continued to be employed by the Aragonese and Spanish monarchs until its dissolution by the 1715 Nueva Planta decrees. Geography The kingdom included the Balearic Islands: Majorca, Menorca (which was still under the rule of Muslims until 1231 when its sovereignty was surrendered to James I), Ibiza and Formentera. The king was also lord of the mainland counties of Roussillon and Cerdanya, and the territories James I kept in Occitania: the signory of Montpellier, the viscountcy of Carlat in Auvergne, and the barony of Aumelas, contiguous with Montpellier. History Conquest of Majorca by James I of Aragon (1229) The legacy of James I included the creation of a strategic Mediterranean enclave, including territories between two large kingdoms, the Capetians of France and the Crown of Aragon, which were in constant conflict at the time. Conscious of the fragility of the Kingdom of Majorca, James I undertook the conquest of Cerdanya to unify the new kingdom. He also entered into negotiations to arrange the marriage of his son James to Beatrice of Savoy, daughter to Count Amadeus of Savoy. Neither plan was successful. On the death of James I, the new king of Majorca, James II, decided not to pay tribute to Peter III of Aragon. Preoccupied with diverse problems within the realm, it was not until 1279 when the Majorcan monarch reconciled to have his states recognized as subordinate to the king of Aragon. As a consequence the Kingdom of Majorca could not hold court, and the king of Majorca was forced to go to Catalonia to present tribute to the king of Aragon. By means of the Treaty of Perpignan in 1279, an imbalance of power between the Kingdom of Aragon and the Kingdom of Majorca was created. The Aragonese king maintained the political and economic control of Aragon over the Kingdom of Majorca, reestablishing the unified jurisdiction of the Crown of Aragon, which was broken by the will of James I. This treaty would condition relations between the Kingdom of Majorca and the Crown of Aragon throughout the former's existence. The lack of courts later aggravated the destabilization of a kingdom already on the brink of fracture, which, besides this, lacked any common institution beyond the monarchy. During the Aragonese Crusade, James II of Majorca allied himself with the Pope and the French against Peter of Aragon. As a result, Peter's successor Alfonso conquered the kingdom in 1286. However, by the Treaty of Anagni in 1295, James II of Aragon was required to restore the Balearics to James of Majorca. On the death of James II of Majorca's son Sancho in 1324, James III took the throne at the age of nine, necessitating a regency council headed by his uncle Philip to govern the realm. The situation was difficult since James II of Aragon did not renounce his claim to the Majorcan throne. In 1325, Philip secured the renunciation by the Aragonian king of any claim on the rights of succession of the Majorcan throne after the repayment of a great debt incurred by Sancho during an invasion by Sardinia. While the act solved the problem of succession, it also plunged the kingdom into a serious financial crisis. James was forced to develop policies similar to that of Aragon's. To that end, he was forced to participate in the war against Genoa (1329-1336), which resulted in the loss of various economic markets for the kingdom. Again, it was necessary to impose new taxes and fines, which were levied on the Jewish community, though this was insufficient to resolve the financial crisis. The problems of the kingdom did not appear to have an end since in 1341, Peter IV of Aragon closed relations with the Kingdom of Majorca as a prelude to invasion. In May 1343, Peter IV invaded the Balearic Islands and followed that in 1344 with the invasions of the counties of Roussillon and Cerdanya. James III was able to keep only his French possessions. After the sale of these possessions to the king of France in 1349, James III left for Majorca. He was defeated and killed at the Battle of Llucmajor on 25 October 1349. Then, the Kingdom of Majorca was definitively incorporated into the Crown of Aragon. Fall of Majorca The extinction of the Kingdom of Majorca was inevitable given the conflicts by which it was affected: the Hundred Years War between France and England; the war of the benimerines, which involved Castile and the Crown of Aragon as well as attempts by the Genoese to make the Balearics a satellite state. The kingdom of Majorca, which had bonds of vassalage with the crowns of France (through Montpellier) and Aragon, could not remain neutral during the conflicts. In addition, increased taxes to fund the kingdom's economy during its neutrality managed to unsettle the people of the kingdom.

He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and worked in Chicago for 20 years before he began buying nickelodeons, eventually expanding into a film distribution service, the Laemmle Film Service, then into production as Independent Moving Pictures Company (IMP), later renamed Universal Film Manufacturing Company, and later still renamed Universal Pictures Company. Life and career Laemmle was born in 1867 to a Jewish family in Laupheim, in the German Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. As a youth, he was an apprentice in Ichenhausen.Stanca Mustea, Cristina. \\"Carl Laemmle.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified June 19, 2012. He followed his older brother and immigrated to the United States in 1884, settling in Chicago, where he married Recha Stern, with whom he would have a son, Carl Laemmle, Jr. and a daughter, Rosabelle Laemmle Bergerman (later married to Stanley Bergerman). Laemmle became a naturalized American citizen in 1889. He worked a variety of jobs, but by 1894 he was the bookkeeper of the Continental Clothing Company in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, where he introduced a bolder advertising style. In 1906, Laemmle quit his job and started one of the first motion picture theaters in Chicago, and quickly branched out into film exchange services. He challenged Thomas Edison's monopoly on moving pictures (the Motion Picture Patents Company) under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. As part of his offensive against Edison's company, Laemmle began advertising individual \\"stars,\\" such as Mary Pickford and Florence Lawrence, thus increasing their individual earning power, and thus their willingness to side with the \\"Independents.\\" After moving to New York, Carl Laemmle got involved in producing movies, forming Independent Moving Pictures (IMP); the city was the site of many new movie- related businesses. On April 30, 1912, in New York, Laemmle brought together Pat Powers of Powers Motion Picture Company, Mark Dintenfass of Champion Film Company, William Swanson of Rex Motion Picture Company, David Horsley of Nestor Film Company, and Charles Baumann and Adam Kessel of the New York Motion Picture Company, to merge their companies with IMP as the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, with Laemmle assuming the role of president. They founded the Company with studios in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where many early film studios in America's first motion picture industry were based at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1915, the studio moved to of land in the San Fernando Valley, California.\\"Making moving pictures\\" The National Magazine, 42:409-417. Boston: Chapple Publishing, 1915 Universal maintained two East Coast offices: The first was located at 1600 Broadway, New York City. This building, initially known as The Studebaker building, was razed around 2004-5. The second location to house Universal's executive offices was at 730 Fifth Avenue, New York City. Many years later, 445 Park Avenue was the location of Universal's executive offices. In 1916, Laemmle sponsored the $3,000 three- foot-tall solid silver Universal Trophy for the winner of the annual Universal race at the Uniontown Speedway board track in southwestern Pennsylvania. Universal filmed each race from 1916 to 1922. After moving to California, Laemmle purchased as a residence for his family the former home of film pioneer Thomas Ince on Benedict Canyon Drive, Beverly Hills. The house was razed in the early 1940s. Laemmle also maintained a large apartment for himself and his two children at 465 West End Avenue, New York City, one block off Riverside Drive near the Hudson River. Carl Laemmle, although having made hundreds of movies in his active years as a producer (1909-1934), is probably best remembered for The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923), The Phantom of The Opera (1925), both with Lon Chaney Sr. in the title role, and The Man Who Laughs (1928) and most of the early sound horror films, such as Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein (1931), with his son Carl Jr. before they were removed from the company he founded by a hostile takeover. He briefly resumed distribution with a partner, Michael Mindlin, specializing in foreign films as CL Imports, in the mid-1930s, but for the most part remained in secluded retirement until his death. Laemmle died from cardiovascular disease on September 24, 1939 in Beverly Hills, California, at the age of 72. Laemmle was entombed in the Chapel Mausoleum at Home of Peace Cemetery. Legacy and honors Laemmle remained connected to his home town of Laupheim throughout his life, providing financial support to it and also by sponsoring hundreds of Jews from Laupheim and W√ºrttemberg to emigrate from Nazi Germany to the United States in the 1930s, paying both emigration and immigration fees, thus saving them from the Holocaust. To ensure and facilitate their immigration, Laemmle contacted American authorities, members of the House of Representatives and Secretary of State Cordell Hull. He also intervened to try to secure entry for the refugees on board the , who were ultimately sent back from Havana to Europe in 1939, where many died in the Holocaust.

His niece, Rebekah Isabelle Laemmle, known professionally as Carla Laemmle, appeared in several films until her retirement from acting at the end of the 1930s. His great- grandniece, Antonia Carlotta, talks about him at length in her web series Universally Me, about the history of Universal Studios. The poet Ogden Nash observed the following about Laemmle's habit of giving his son and nephews top executive positions in his studios: \\"Uncle Carl Laemmle Has a very large faemmle.\\" Representation in other media *Harold Robbins, a former Universal Studios employee, based a main character in the novel The Dream Merchants (1949) on Carl Laemmle. *Laemmle was featured as an historic character in the movie The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones. *David Menefee's novel, Sweet Memories (2012), features Carl Laemmle as a character.

With 108 accepted genera and about 2400 known species, it is the largest family in the Magnoliales. Several genera produce edible fruit, most notably Annona, Anonidium, Asimina, Rollinia, and Uvaria. Its type genus is Annona. The family is concentrated in the tropics, with few species found in temperate regions. About 900 species are Neotropical, 450 are Afrotropical, and the remaining are Indomalayan. Description Annona muricata The species are mostly tropical, some are mid-latitude, deciduous or evergreen trees and shrubs, with some lianas, with aromatic bark, leaves, and flowers. ; Stems, stalks and leaves: Bark is fibrous and aromatic. Pith septate (fine tangential bands divided by partitions) to diaphragmed (divided by thin partitions with openings in them). Branching distichous (arranged in two rows/on one plane) or spiral. Leaves are alternate, two-ranked, simple, pinnately veined, and have leaf stalks. Stipules absent. ; Flowers: Flower stalks are axillary to (on the opposite side of shoot from) leaf scars on old wood and sometimes from leaves on new shoots. The flowers are usually trimerous; borne singly or in compound inflorescences; bisexual and rarely unisexual. The receptacle might become enlarged, elevated or flat. The outer whorls are inserted below the ovaries, and have valvate (overlapping) or imbricate (nonoverlapping) segments. Usually two to four persistent sepals that are distinct or connate (fused) at the base. Six petals in two unequal whorls of three with larger outer whorls and fleshier inner whorls that might share the same nectar glands, or six to fifteen petals, with impressed veins on their inner face. Ten to twenty (or many more) stamens inserted below the ovary, spirally arranged and forming a ball or flat-topped mass with short and stout filaments and linear to oblong anthers which face outward and open longitudinally. Each flower can have from one to many pistils, distinct to connate, with stigmas distinct. Marginal placentation, each pistil bearing one locule, with one to many ovules. Style short and thick, with terminal stigma. ; Fruits and seeds: Fruits are single berries or coalesce from several pistils (into aggregate fruit, syncarps). Seeds are one to many per pistil; have a fleshy and usually brightly colored cover, have ruminate endosperm (nutritive tissue surrounding the embryo) and are oily. Systematics Monophyly and inter-familial systematics have been well supported for Annonaceae by a combination of morphological and molecular evidence. The APG II system places Annonaceae as most closely related to the small Magnoliid family Eupomatiaceae. Uvaria ovata is part of the Family, Annonaceae. {style=\\"text-align:left\\"  } In a phylogeny-based reclassification of the family four subfamilies are recognised: Anaxagoreoideae (including just Anaxagorea), Ambavioideae, Annonoideae, and Malmeoideae. A number of the larger genera, including Guatteria, with its 177 species, Annona, and Xylopia belong to Annonoideae. Together, Annonoideae and Malmeoideae comprise the majority of the species and each are further subdivided into a number of tribes. The subfamilial and tribal classification is followed in World Annonaceae which presents an overview of all Annonaceae genera and taxonomic, distribution and photographic information for a large number of species. Keys for the identification of Annonaceae genera (separately for Neotropical, African/Madagascan, and Asian/Australian taxa) are presented in: For a concise bibliographic overview of the taxonomic literature (1900 to 2012) see: Both plastid DNA markers and morphological characters provide evidence that Anaxagorea is the sister clade to the rest of the family. This may confirm the hypothesis that morphological traits shared between Anaxagorea and other Magnoliales species (such as 2-ranked phyllotaxis, monosulcate pollen, and laminate stamens) represent ancestral characters, while derived characters observed in other genera have evolved independently multiple times. The oldest fossil evidence of Annonaceae is described as the genus Futabanthus, from the late Cretaceous of Japan, which represents a minimum age of c. 89 Mya for the most recent common ancestor (crown group) of the family. The ages of Annonaceae clades inferred using fossil evidence and molecular clock-based dating techniques suggests that the pantropical distribution of the family originated subsequent to the break-up of the Gondwanan supercontinent, as the result of a combination of geodispersal tracking the expansion of the boreotropical flora during the Eocene and more recent long-distance dispersal events.  Taxonomic revisions within the subfamily Malmeoideae  The reclassification and establishment of Hubera = The genus Hubera was resolved to be sister to Miliusa, with certain species previously under Polyalthia being additionally reclassified. This reclassification was highly supported by maximum parsimony, Bayesian analysis, and morphological characters. Hubera is characterized by reticulate tertiary venation, axillary inflorescences, 1 ovule per ovary, seeds with flat to slightly raised raphes, and other characters. Hubera's phylogenetic distance and morphological difference from Monoon and Polyalthia, distinguish Hubera on the generic level. Morphologically, Hubera has a finely and densely granular infratectum whereas Monoon and Polyalthia have columellate or densely granular infratectums. = The creation and establishment of Winitia = Winitia is sister to Stelechocarpus burahol, with Stelechocarpus cauliflorus being reclassified under the new genus. The Winitia is characterized by mixed flowers, multicolumellar stigmas, and columellate/coarsely granular infratectum. This genus was created after phylogenetic analysis that highly supported an unclassified species from Thailand being sister to Stelechocarpus cauliflorus as a monophyletic group. = Reclassification of Annickia as tribe Annickieae = The genus Annickia was previously included within the tribe Piptostigmateae. However, it is highly supported to being sister to the rest of the Malmeoideae tribes, and weakly supported to being sister to the rest of the Piptostigmateae genera. For these reasons, Annickia is now classified within its own tribe in the Malmeoideae, the Annickieae.

Food The large, edible, pulpy fruits of some members, typically called anona by Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking people of the family's Neotropical range, include species of Annona: custard apple (A. reticulata), cherimoya (A. cherimola), soursop/guan√°bana/graviola (A. muricata), sweetsop (A. squamosa), ilama (A. diversifolia), soncoya (A. purpurea), atemoya (a cross between A. cherimola and A. squamosa); and biriba (Rollinia deliciosa, which may require reclassification under Annona). The names of many of those fruits are sometimes used interchangeably. Recently, consumption of the neotropical annonaceous plant Annona muricata (soursop, graviola, guanabana) has been strongly associated as a causal agent in \\"atypical Parkinsonism\\". The causative agent, annonacin, is present in the seeds and leaves of many of the Annonaceae, though not in any significant quantity in the fruit flesh. It is thought to be responsible for up to 70% of Parkinsonian conditions in Guadeloupe. Exposure is typically through traditional food and natural medicines. The American pawpaw (Asimina triloba) has an Eastern U.S. distribution, and is currently under investigation as a commercial agricultural crop. Flower petals from sacred earflower (Cymbopetalum penduliflorum) and from related species C. costaricense were traditionally used to flavor chocolate before the arrival of cinnamon and the other Old World spices. The dried petals are still used to flavor atoles, pinoles, and coffee. Folk medicine The bark, leaves, and roots of some species are used in folk medicines. Toxicology The compound annonacin, which occurs in the seeds and leaves of many Annonaceae, including soursop (Annona muricata), is a neurotoxin and seems to be the cause of a neurodegenerative disease. The disorder is a so-called tauopathy associated with a pathologic accumulation of tau protein in the brain. Experimental results indicate that annonacin is responsible for this accumulation.Informationsdienst Wissenschaft: Tauopathie durch pflanzliches Nervengift , 4. Mai 2007 Other uses Lancewood (Oxandra lanceolata) is a tough, elastic, and heavy wood obtained from the West Indies and the Guianas. It was often used for carriage shafts. It is brought into commerce in the form of taper poles of about 6 m in length and from 15 to 20 cm in breadth at the butt. The black lancewood or carisiri of the Guianas is of remarkably slender form. The yellow lancewood tree Calycophyllum candididissimum, common names lemonwood or degame, is from a different family (Rubiaceae). It is used as an alternative to lancewood and is found in tolerable abundance throughout The Guianas, and used by the Amerinds for arrow-points, as well as for spars, beams, etc. Some bowyers use this wood for making longbows. Other Ylang- ylang (Cananga odorata) flowers. * Some species of the family, such as Cananga odorata (ylang-ylang) also have aromatic oil and are used for perfumes or spices. * The strong bark is used for carrying burdens in the Amazon Rainforest and for wooden implements, such as tool handles and pegs. The wood is valued as firewood. * Yellow and brown dyes * Some species are also grown as ornamental plants, especially the Indian species Polyalthia longifolia pendula. * The fruit and leaves of Uvariopsis tripetala (pepperfruit) are used as a spice for meats in some parts of Nigeria, due to its \\"hot\\" peppery flavor. Chemical constituents A large number of chemical compounds, including flavonoids, alkaloids, and acetogenins, have been extracted from the seeds and many other parts of these plants. Flavonoids and alkaloids contained in the leaves and bark of several species of the family have shown insecticidal properties.

Anderson (born October 27, 1947) is an American journalist. He reported for the Associated Press. In 1985, he was taken hostage by Shiite Hezbollah militants of the Islamic Jihad Organization in Lebanon and held until 1991. In 2004, he ran unsuccessfully for the Ohio State Senate. Early life Anderson was born in Lorain, Ohio and raised in Batavia, New York. He graduated from Batavia High School in 1965. A professional journalist, he was in the United States Marine Corps for six years, serving as a combat journalist. He also served two tours of duty in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. After his discharge he enrolled at Iowa State University, graduating in 1974 with dual degrees: one in journalism and mass communication, the other in political science. He then joined the Associated Press, serving in Asia and Africa before being assigned to Lebanon as chief Middle Eastern correspondent in 1983. Hostage in Lebanon On March 16, 1985, Anderson had just finished a tennis game when he was abducted from the street in Beirut, placed in the trunk of a car, and taken to a secret location where he was imprisoned. For the next six years and nine months, he was held captive, being moved periodically to new sites. His captors were a group of Hezbollah Shiite Muslims who were supported by Iran in supposed retaliation for Israel's use of U.S. weapons and aid in its 1982‚Äì83 strikes against Muslim and Druze targets in Lebanon. He was the longest-held of the American hostages captured in an effort to drive U.S. military forces from Lebanon during the Lebanese Civil War. Held at the same time were several other U.S. citizens, including Thomas Sutherland, an administrator at the American University of Beirut; Catholic priest, Father Lawrence Jenco; David P. Jacobsen, administrator at the American University Hospital of Beirut; Presbyterian minister Benjamin Weir; Jerry Levin, CNN's Beirut bureau chief; Frank Reed, head of the Lebanese International School; Joseph Cicippio, deputy controller of the American University of Beirut; Edward Tracy, a bookseller and writer in Beirut; and Professors Alann Steen, Jesse Turner and Robert Polhill. Anderson was released on December 4, 1991, and says he has forgiven his captors. Post-captivity life Since his release, Anderson has taught courses at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism and at the E.W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University. He has also been a talk show guest, a columnist, and a radio talk- show host. He has written a best selling memoir of his experience as a hostage, titled Den of Lions. He filed suit against the Iranian government for his captivity, and in 2002 was awarded a multimillion-dollar settlement from frozen Iranian assets. Estimates put the amount he actually received at $26 million. Anderson for some time lived in Nicholasville, Kentucky, teaching journalism and diversity at the University of Kentucky. In 2009, Anderson joined the faculty of the School of Journalism at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky. In November 2009, he filed for bankruptcy under chapter 7. In 2011, he became a visiting professional at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. In 2013, he acted as Honorary Chair of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a non-profit that supports press freedom around the globe. In 2014, he moved to Hidden Village in Gainesville, Florida, to teach a course in International Journalism at the University of Florida. Philanthropy With some of his settlement, Anderson and actress Kieu Chinh co-founded the Vietnam Children's Fund, which has built schools in Vietnam attended by more than 12,000 students. He also created the Father Lawrence Jenco Foundation with a $100,000 endowment to honor and support people who do charitable and community service projects in Appalachia. Lawrence Jenco was a former Catholic Relief Services director in Beirut who also was kidnapped. The two men met in jail. Jenco, who died in 1996, wrote his memoirs, Bound to Forgive, to which Anderson wrote the preface. 2004 State Senate campaign In December 2003 Terry Anderson announced his candidacy on the Democratic ticket to represent the 20th District in the Ohio Senate. His opponent was Republican candidate Joy Padgett, who had been appointed to the seat earlier in the term. Padgett ran controversial ads suggesting that Anderson would be soft on terrorism: the ads showed Anderson shaking hands with one of his former kidnappers. He received 46% of the vote in a district that leans Republican; the seat has been held by Republicans since 1977. Personal life Anderson has been married twice. He met his first wife, Mihoko \\"Mickey\\" Anderson, while he was a Marine stationed with the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service in Japan. They had one daughter, Gabrielle Anderson (born 1976). They later divorced.Sun Sentinel: \\"Anderson\`s Fiancee Kept Quiet Watch\\" By MARJORIE WILLIAMS December 18, 1991 In 1982, he married a Lebanese native from a Maronite Christian family, Madeleine Bassil; they had one daughter, Sulome Anderson, born in 1985,Deseret News: \\"TERRY ANDERSON: DEN OF LIONS; HOSTAGE'S LIFE FULL OF PAIN AND MEMORIES\\" From Den of Lions: Memoirs of Seven Years By Terry Anderson Published September 30, 1993 by TMS Corp.New York magazine: \\"I‚Äôm Arab-American.

Bowfin was laid down by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine, on 23 July 1942, and launched on 7 December 1942 by Mrs. Jane Gawne, wife of Captain James Gawne, and commissioned on 1 May 1943, Commander Joseph H. Willingham in command.  First patrol  Following fitting out, the submarine proceeded via Newport, Rhode Island, to New London, Connecticut, her base for shakedown training. Early in July 1943, she got underway for the Pacific war zone and, after transiting the Panama Canal and crossing the Pacific, reached Australia. After-voyage repair at Brisbane preceded her getting underway on 19 August to move north and west along the Australian coast to Darwin. She topped off her fuel tanks at that port and sailed on the morning of 25 August for her first war patrol. The warship reached the Mindanao Sea on 2 September, but plied its waters for more than three weeks without encountering any worthwhile targets. On 24 September, she met with to conduct coordinated operations. The next day, the two submarines began tracking a six-ship convoy and continued the chase for some five hours before Bowfin finally attained a suitable attack position. She then launched her six bow torpedoes ‚Äî four at a freighter and two at a trailing transport. Three exploded against the side of the first ship and both of those fired at the second struck home. The submarine immediately turned her fantail toward the convoy and emptied her stern tubes, sending four torpedoes in the direction of a tanker. Gunfire at her periscope forced Bowfin to go deep, so prevented her crew from observing the progress of her last salvo, but they heard its torpedoes explode. When the submarine rose to periscope depth about an hour later, the 8,120-ton passenger-cargo ship Kirishima Maru was slowly sinking, the tanker was on fire, and the transport seemed to be settling by the stern. However, the two latter ships apparently were able to limp back to port, for the sinking of neither was confirmed by postwar study of Japanese records. Later in the day, members of Bowfin‚Äôs crew heard distant explosions and inferred that Billfish was going after the remnants of the convoy, a conclusion which proved to be correct, for their sister ship managed to damage two Japanese ships totaling about 12,000 tons. Although the submarines continued to pursue the remaining enemy vessels as they fled during the night, the battered group of Japanese ships finally managed to slip away in the darkness. The following morning, after Bowfins radar had picked up an enemy plane also equipped with radar, the submarine was forced to submerge to avoid detection. Two days later, she came across a 1,400-ton inter-island steamer and shadowed her until reaching a firing position about three hours later. She then launched three torpedoes. One stopped before reaching the target, and the other two missed. On 30 September, as she left the Mindanao Sea, Bowfin chanced upon a diesel-propelled barge carrying over 100 Japanese soldiers and opened fire on it with her four-inch gun. When the target responded with machine gun fire, the submarine's 20-mm guns entered the fray. The battle came to an abrupt end when a four-inch round struck the enemy's magazine and blew apart the already sinking barge. On 2 October, as the submarine continued through the Makassar Strait toward Australia, her crew sighted a schooner off Balikpapan. Willingham fired two shots across the stranger's bow, but failed to bring her to and sank her with gunfire. Bowfin arrived at Fremantle on 10 October, ending a successful patrol. Rear Admiral Ralph W. Christie, who commanded American submarines in the area, was lavish in his praise of the submarine's performance; he rewarded her commanding officer with the opportunity of heading a submarine division. To free him for the new role, Lieutenant Commander Walter Thomas Griffith relieved Willingham as commanding officer of Bowfin on 26 October.  Second patrol  Upon completion of refitting, Bowfin got underway on 1 November and headed for the South China Sea. From time to time during this patrol, she again cooperated with Billfish. On 8 November, Bowfin picked up the trail of a group of five schooners. When she pulled within range of them, she opened fire with her four-inch gun and sank three before bombs from a Japanese plane forced the submarine to dive, allowing the two surviving vessels to slip away. After staying down until dark, Bowfin surfaced and resumed patrolling. Before long, she discovered and opened fire upon a large sailing ship which went down after suffering hits by two four-inch shells. Two days later, she found her next victims, a pair of small steamers heading for Tawi-Tawi Bay, and set both ablaze with gunfire. Her luck was even better on the morning of 26 November, while she was approaching the coast of Indochina during a blinding rainstorm. Without prior knowledge that any other vessels were near, she unexpectedly found herself surrounded by Japanese shipping. After barely avoiding a collision with a tanker by backing all engines, she torpedoed and sank the 5,069-ton tanker Ogurasan Maru and then dispatched the 5,407-ton freighter Tainan Maru. A few hours later, her torpedoes ended the career of Van Vollenhoven, a 691-ton coastal cargo ship which the Japanese had taken from her French owners when they overran Indochina almost two years before. On 28 November, after having sent a small passenger-cargo ship to the bottom with a single torpedo, Bowfin joined Billfish in attacking a convoy and quickly sank Sydney Maru, a 5,425-ton freighter and Tonon Maru, a 9,866-ton tanker. Meanwhile, one of the Japanese ships fired on Bowfin and scored hits which opened leaks in her starboard induction line, which, while serious, did not prevent the submarine from getting off her last two torpedoes. Repair efforts at daylight slowed, but did not completely stop, the flooding, and Bowfin began her voyage back to Australia. En route to her base on 2 December, she came across a \\"two masted yacht...which...,\\" in Griffith's words, \\"...looked like it might have been some planter‚Äôs yacht taken over by the Japs.\\" The submarine's deck gun promptly destroyed this stranger; and, thereafter, Bowfin enjoyed an uneventful passage which brought her to Fremantle a week later. There, Rear Admiral Christie praised her performance as the \\"classic of all submarine patrols\\".  Third and fourth patrols  The submarine got underway on 8 January 1944 for her third war patrol. She proceeded through the Java, Banda, and Flores Seas to Makassar Strait where ‚Äî on 16 January ‚Äî she encountered a small schooner, surfaced, and sank the sailing vessel with her deck gun. The following day, she came across a cargo ship and two escorts, but her attacks on these targets were frustrated by malfunctioning torpedoes. One from her first spread of four bow torpedoes hit and stopped the freighter, but the other three missed and two shots from her bow tubes detonated before reaching the target. After reloading her tubes, she returned to the convoy the following day and finished off the crippled cargo ship with four torpedoes which sent the 4,408-ton Shoyu Maru to the bottom. She also managed to hit one of the escorts with two \\"fish\\", but did not sink her. Out of torpedoes, Bowfin returned to Darwin for more and, while in port, picked up Rear Admiral Christie, who remained on board the submarine for the rest of the patrol to check on torpedo performance, first hand, and to learn the secret of Bowfins remarkable success. The day after she returned to sea, the submarine put three torpedoes into a small cargo ship. Lt. Comdr. Griffith claimed the target sank and his distinguished passenger confirmed the kill, but the sinking was not borne out by postwar examination of Japanese records ‚Äî possibly because Bowfins alleged victim was too small to be listed. About daybreak on 28 January, Bowfin began trailing a large tanker, and she continued the chase until reaching striking range that evening. She then fired all six bow torpedoes, but, since the target simultaneously changed course, none struck home. After a rapid reload, she sent six more toward the tanker, and this time, two exploded against the side of the Japanese ship, sending towers of fire and smoke skyward. Nevertheless, the tanker remained afloat. As Bowfin closed to administer the coup de grace, the enemy ship began fighting back with her main battery and machine gun fire. Undaunted, the submarine kept up the attack and during the ensuing 20 minutes fired six more torpedoes: two misses, followed by a pair of hits, then a miss, and finally another hit. At this point, the tanker's fire was becoming more accurate and forced the submarine to dive. When she came up, the Japanese vessel was retiring from the scene, and by dawn had disappeared over the horizon. The next day, Bowfin laid a minefield in Makassar Strait before beginning the voyage back to Australia. On 30 January, she came across a pair of small schooners which she destroyed with her four-inch gun. The submarine moored at Fremantle on 5 February and began preparations for her next mission.  Fifth patrol  Underway on 28 February 1944, the submarine headed for the Celebes Sea. On 10 March, her crew sighted a convoy of four ships screened by a couple of escorts. Bowfin fired six bow tubes, but four of the torpedoes exploded prematurely. Japanese planes forced Griffith to dive and thus prevented anyone on board from observing the fate of the two other torpedoes. During the ensuing action, in which the escorts searched for the submarine, and she in turn strove to hide at some 350 feet below the surface, a chain dragged by one of the Japanese hunters scraped across Bowfins hull. Meanwhile, depth charge explosions ‚Äî more than 20 ‚Äî shook the submarine severely, but did no debilitating damage. When Griffith dared to rise to the surface, he saw a freighter down by the stern being taken under tow. Despite the efforts of the enemy escorts and of five circling Japanese aircraft, Bowfin attacked the convoy, but could not follow the progress of her torpedoes because one of them had boomeranged and threatened her by running in a circular pattern. She dived to escape the danger and did not come up again until the next day. She attacked the freighter again, but the Japanese escorts drove her down once more. Later that day, she rose to periscope depth, found the damaged ship alone, and finished the 4,470-ton Tsukikawa Maru off with four well-aimed torpedoes. The submarine then began looking for the rest of the convoy, caught up with it well after dark, and fired her remaining torpedoes, but none scored. She then headed back to Darwin for more, and stood out to sea again on 15 March with a fresh supply. Three days later, she emptied her bow tubes while attacking a small convoy, but all six either ran under their targets or missed wide of their marks. The inevitable depth charge barrage followed, but proved to be equally ineffective. When Bowfin attacked again later that day, she launched four torpedoes ‚Äî all of which were wasted. She did better on the night of 24 March, when, at the end of a long chase, she attacked a five-ship convoy in the Celebes Sea, sinking two freighters ‚Äî 5,139-ton Shinkyo Maru and 5,395-ton Bengal Maru. She also damaged a third ship, but could not finish her off for want of torpedoes. As a result, she headed back to Darwin, where she arrived on 1 April.  Sixth and seventh patrols  A 40 mm anti-aircraft gun There, Commander John H. Corbus relieved Lt. Commander Griffith in command of the submarine, which got underway again on 24 April and headed for the Palaus. Although this sixth patrol proved to be her longest in both time and distance, she only managed to put two torpedoes into a freighter on 14 May, and it refused to sink. She performed lifeguard duty before heading, via Midway, for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 21 June. On 16 July, Bowfin left Hawaii and headed for the Ryukyu Islands. She encountered no worthwhile targets until 9 August, when her crew sighted four ships heading for the harbor at Minami Daito. She trailed them into port and, after they had moored, fired her bow torpedoes, blowing up two and damaging a third. A stray torpedo hit a dock, sending a bus careering into the water, an incident the Cary Grant comedy film Operation Petticoat incorporated into its story line in 1959 (Grant yelling \\"We sunk a truck!\\" in the film after an unintentional misfire caused by a nurse on board). However, no sinkings were confirmed by Japanese records ‚Äî again possibly because of the small size of the alleged victims. An authenticated kill came off the Tokara Islands on 22 August, when she attacked a convoy, hit several ships, and claimed several kills including two destroyers, but apparently only sank the 6,754-ton transport . According to Tsushima-maru Commemoration Association data, the ship was carrying 1,661 civilian evacuees, including 834 schoolchildren (of whom 775 were killed). Shortly after the sinking a \\"Gag Order\\" was enforced and families and survivors rarely spoke about the incident. The number of victims that have been identified by name, based on notifications from bereaved families (as of 22 August 2012), include 780 schoolchildren. On 28 August, Bowfin set a little trawler afire with her four-inch gun. However, since she had futilely fired her last four torpedoes at this target before surfacing, the submarine headed via Midway and Pearl Harbor for the west coast of the United States. She reached San Francisco, California, on 21 September and entered the Mare Island Navy Yard for overhaul. USS Bowfin At the end of the yard work, Commander Alexander K. Tyree relieved Commander Corbus on 16 December 1944; and, later that day, the submarine got underway westward back across the Pacific. Following training in Hawaiian waters, she headed for a station near the Japanese home islands south of Honsh≈´ where she performed lifeguard services for American planes ‚Äî both naval and Army ‚Äî raiding strategic enemy targets in Japan. On 17 February, Bowfin attacked two Japanese subchasers and sank the 750-ton Coast Defense Vessel No. 56 with torpedoes and then survived a 26-depth-charge attack by her victim's consort which had herself barely escaped destruction when some of Bowfin‚Äôs torpedoes exploded prematurely. The submarine later sank a Japanese sea truck with one torpedo. On 19 March about 15 miles south of Shikoku at 09:30, the submarine was on watch when a lone Navy torpedo bomber with white stars on its wings and its tail shot up headed in low toward the submarine. The plane had been hit moments earlier by enemy flak during its bombing run over the Kure Naval Yard. The plane landed in the water dead ahead, about 500 yards off the bow. It floated for two minutes and then nosed down and sank. Both men in the plane jumped out and hung onto an inflated raft. Eleven minutes later, the crew of Bowfin had them aboard. She rescued the pilot, Lieutenant R. U. Plant, and gunner, J. Papazoglakis (Pakis) of the downed Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber of Torpedo Squadron 83 (VT-83) from the aircraft carrier . The two men were cold and wet from just a few minutes in that water, but otherwise safe and sound. The captain ordered the life raft sunk and the dye marker destroyed with small arms fire and then resumed patrol on the lifeguard station. The submarine soon set a course for the Marianas and ended the patrol upon her arrival at Guam on 25 March.  Eighth and ninth patrols  Torpedo tubes Underway on 23 April for her eighth war patrol, the submarine plied the waters north of Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç. Her first kill came on 1 May when two of her torpedoes sank the 2,719-ton transport Chowa Maru. A week later, she overtook, torpedoed, and destroyed an 880-ton freighter Daito Maru No. 3, but that proved to be the last score of the patrol. After a fortnight of futile searching for targets, she arrived at Apra Harbor, Guam, for refit. While training for her ninth and final patrol of the war, Bowfin rescued a Marine Corps pilot whose fighter had crashed. She got underway on 29 May and pointed her bow back toward the enemy homeland. One of 9 submarines protected by newly developed mine-detecting sonar and sent into the Sea of Japan, she carefully threaded her way through the dangerous minefields of Tsushima Strait which guarded this previously sacrosanct maritime heart of the Japanese Empire, but found little enemy shipping. Nevertheless, she wasted neither of her two possible contacts: the first, the 1,898-ton cargo ship took four torpedoes before sinking on 11 June; and the second, the 887-ton freighter Akiura Maru met a similar fate on 13 June. The submarine left the Sea of Japan by La P√©rouse Strait (Soya Misaki) and headed for Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor on Independence Day and began preparations to return to action. Early in August, Bowfin sailed for the Marianas, her staging point for her 10th war patrol. However, while en route, she received word of Japan's capitulation. As a result, she reversed course and returned to Hawaii and, then, headed for the Panama Canal on her way to the east coast of the United States. Bowfin arrived at Tompkinsville, Staten Island, New York, on 21 September 1945. She served in the Atlantic Fleet until decommissioned at New London on 12 February 1947 and placed in reserve.  Post-war  Bowfin in drydock undergoing restoration, 2004 Reactivated because of the Navy's need to expand the fleet to support United Nations-led forces during the Korean War, the submarine was recommissioned on 27 July 1951 and, following shakedown training, sailed for the Pacific. After arriving at San Diego, California, on 6 October, she worked from that port for the next two years, devoting her time to training operations and local exercises. The nominal ending of hostilities in Korea in the summer of 1953 reduced the Navy's need for active submarines and prompted Bowfins second inactivation. She arrived at San Francisco on 8 October 1953, and was placed out of commission, in reserve, at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 22 April 1954. The warship remained there until moving to Seattle, Washington, on 1 May 1960 to replace as the Naval Reserve training submarine there and to begin a little over a decade's service. Her name was finally struck from the Navy list on 1 December 1971, and she was taken back to Pearl Harbor, where she now serves as a memorial. Audio tours are available to the general public at Pearl Harbor. Some areas of the ship are off limits. Bowfin was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. and In 1987, she was dry- docked and refitted to be used as a floating location to portray three different submarines in the epic miniseries War and Remembrance.https://www.bowfin.org/museum-history Sunken enemy vessels *USS Bowfin - Instrument Panel #3 Main Generator EngineThe passenger-cargo ship Kirishima Maru on 25 September 1943 * The tanker Ogurasan Maru and cargo ship Tainan Maru on 26 November 1943 * The Vichy France cargo ship Van Vollenhoven on 26 November or 27 November 1943 * The passenger-cargo ship Sydney Maru and the 9,866-ton tanker Tonan Maru on 28 November 1943 * A pair of schooners she destroyed with her four-inch gun on 30 November (1943) * The cargo ship Shoyu Maru on 17 January 1944 * The cargo ship Tsukikawa Maru on 10 March 1944 * The cargo ships Shinkyo Maru and Bengal Maru on 24 March 1944 * The passenger-cargo ship Tsushima Maru on 22 August 1944 * Assisted in the sinking of the 4,500-ton cargo ship Bisan Maru on 14 May 1944 * The frigate Coastal Defense Vessel No. 56 on 17 February 1945 * The auxiliary patrol boat on 2 March 1945 * The passenger-cargo ship Chowa Maru on 1 May 1945 * The cargo ship Daito Maru No. 3 on 8 May 1945 * The cargo ship Shiny≈ç Maru No. 3 on 11 June 1945 * The cargo ship Akiura Maru on 13 June 1945 The sinking of Tsushima Maru Tsushima Maru was an unmarked Japanese cargo ship sunk by Bowfin between 22:00 and 22:30 local time on 22 August 1944 as the ship was carrying hundreds of schoolchildren from Okinawa to Kagoshima.

On her sixth patrol, Bowfin destroyed a pier at Minami Daito that contained a crane and a bus. Thirteen small vessels were sunk by Bowfins deck guns. USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park The submarine is owned and operated by the Pacific Fleet Submarine Memorial Association, and is now part of the USS Bowfin Submarine Museum & Park in Pearl Harbor, on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Visitors can tour the submarine with an audio narration of life in the vessel during World War II. The park's museum features exhibits and artifacts about submarines and the history of the United States Submarine Service, including detailed models, weapon systems, photographs, paintings, battleflags, recruiting posters, and a memorial honoring the 52 American submarines and the more than 3,500 submariners lost during World War II. The museum's other exhibits include a Kaiten torpedo and a 40-mm quad gun, along with Poseidon C-3 and Regulus I missiles. The park is located within walking distance of the visitor center for the USS Arizona Memorial and it is across the Harbor from the Battleship Missouri Memorial.

The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 8 January 1971 and her keel was laid down on 8 January 1972. She was launched on 6 April 1974 sponsored by Anne Armstrong, and commissioned on 13 November 1976 with Commander John E. Christensen in command. She hosted President Jimmy Carter and the First Lady on 27 May 1977 for an at-sea demonstration of her capabilities. In 2007 she was the oldest submarine in active service with the United States Navy. The Navy decommissioned USS Los Angeles on 23 January 2010, in the Port of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, her namesake city.

In 1978, she transferred to the Pacific Fleet and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 7, homeported in Pearl Harbor. She conducted 17 Pacific deployments over the next 32 years and earned eight Meritorious Unit Citations and a Navy Unit Citation. Los Angeles participated in four multinational \\"Rim of the Pacific\\" (RIMPAC) exercises, and visited numerous foreign ports in Italy, Republic of the Philippines, Diego Garcia, Hong Kong, Mauritius, Australia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Canada and Singapore. In 1999, while under the command of Mark D. Jenkins, Los Angeles was modified to carry a Dry Deck Shelter (DDS). Her capabilities included undersea warfare, surface warfare, strike warfare, mining operations, special forces delivery, reconnaissance, carrier battle group support and escort, and intelligence collection.

It is closely associated with social contract philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Popular sovereignty expresses a concept, and does not necessarily reflect or describe a political reality.Leonard Levy notes the \\"doctrine\\" of popular sovereignty that it \\"relates primarily not to the Constitution's [actual] operation but to its source of authority and supremacy, ratification, amendment, and possible abolition\\" (Tarcov 1986, v. 3, p. 1426, 1426). Benjamin Franklin expressed the concept when he wrote, \\"In free governments, the rulers are the servants and the people their superiors and sovereigns\\". Origins Popular sovereignty in its modern sense is an idea that dates to the social contracts school (mid-17th to mid-18th centuries), represented by Thomas Hobbes (1588‚Äì1679), John Locke (1632‚Äì1704), and Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712‚Äì1778), author of The Social Contract, a prominent political work that clearly highlighted the ideals of \\"general will\\" and further matured the idea of popular sovereignty. The central tenet is that the legitimacy of rule or of law is based on the consent of the governed. Popular sovereignty is thus a basic tenet of most republics, and in some monarchies. Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau were the most influential thinkers of this school, all postulating that individuals choose to enter into a social contract with one another, thus voluntarily giving up some of their natural freedom in return for protection from dangers derived from the freedom of others. Whether men were seen as naturally more prone to violence and rapine (Hobbes) or cooperation and kindness (Rousseau), the idea that a legitimate social order emerges only when the liberties and duties are equal among citizens binds the social contract thinkers to the concept of popular sovereignty. A parallel development of a theory of popular sovereignty can be found among the School of Salamanca (see e.g. Francisco de Vitoria (1483‚Äì1546) or Francisco Suarez (1548‚Äì1617)), who (like the theorists of the divine right of kings and Locke) saw sovereignty as emanating originally from God, but (unlike divine right theorists, and in agreement with Locke) passing from God to all people equally, not only to monarchs. Republics and popular monarchies are theoretically based on popular sovereignty. However, a legalistic notion of popular sovereignty does not necessarily imply an effective, functioning democracy: a party or even an individual dictator may claim to represent the will of the people, and rule in its name, pretending to detain auctoritas. That would be congruent with Hobbes's view on the subject, but not with most modern definitions that see democracy as a necessary condition of popular sovereignty. United States The application of the doctrine of popular sovereignty receives particular emphasis in American history, notes historian Christian G. Fritz's American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War, a study of the early history of American constitutionalism.Christian G. Fritz, American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War (Cambridge University Press, 2008) at p. 290, 400. In describing how Americans attempted to apply this doctrine prior to the territorial struggle over slavery that led to the Civil War, political scientist Donald S. Lutz noted the variety of American applications: The American Revolution marked a departure in the concept of popular sovereignty as it had been discussed and employed in the European historical context. With their Revolution, Americans substituted the sovereignty in the person of King George III, with a collective sovereign‚Äîcomposed of the people. Thenceforth, American revolutionaries generally agreed with and were committed to the principle that governments were legitimate only if they rested on popular sovereignty ‚Äì that is, the sovereignty of the people. This idea‚Äîoften linked with the notion of the consent of the governed‚Äîwas not invented by the American revolutionaries. Rather, the consent of the governed and the idea of the people as a sovereign had clear 17th- and 18th-century intellectual roots in English history.On the English origins of the sovereignty of the people and consent as the basis of government, see: Reid 1986‚Äì1993, v. III, pp. 97‚Äì101, 107‚Äì110; Morgan 1988, passim 1850s In the 1850s, in the run-up to the Civil War, Northern Democrats led by Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan and Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois promoted popular sovereignty as a middle position on the slavery issue. It said that actual residents of territories should be able to decide by voting whether or not slavery would be allowed in the territory. The federal government did not have to make the decision, and by appealing to democracy, Cass and Douglas hoped they could finesse the question of support for or opposition to slavery. Douglas applied popular sovereignty to Kansas in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which passed Congress in 1854. The Act had two unexpected results. By dropping the Missouri Compromise of 1820 (which said slavery would never be allowed in Kansas), it was a major boost for the expansion of slavery. Overnight, outrage united anti-slavery forces across the North into an \\"anti-Nebraska\\" movement that soon was institutionalized as the Republican Party, with its firm commitment to stop the expansion of slavery. Secondly, pro- and anti-slavery elements moved into Kansas with the intention of voting slavery up or down, leading to a raging civil war, known as \\"Bleeding Kansas\\". Abraham Lincoln targeted popular sovereignty in the Lincoln‚ÄìDouglas debates of 1858, leaving Douglas in a position that alienated Southern pro-slavery Democrats who thought he was too weak in his support of slavery. The Southern Democrats broke off and ran their own candidate against Lincoln and Douglas in 1860.Childers 2011, pp. 48‚Äì70 See also * Claim of Right 1989 * Consent of the governed * Self-determination * Self-governance * Declaration of Arbroath * Legitimacy (political) * Man-made law * Parliamentary sovereignty * Philosophical anarchism * Retroversion of the sovereignty to the people * Scottish Constitutional Commission * Sovereign Citizen Movement NotesReferences * Adams, Willi Paul (1980), The First American Constitutions: Republican Ideology and the Making of the State Constitutions in the Revolutionary Era, University of North Carolina Press, * Childers, Christopher (March 2011), \\"Interpreting Popular Sovereignty: A Historiographical Essay\\", Civil War History 57 (1): 48‚Äì70 * Conkin, Paul K.

Earlier, he was the Berlin correspondent for the Chicago Tribune and the drama critic for The New York Times and The New Yorker. Alexander Woollcott said that Herman Mankiewicz was the \\"funniest man in New York\\". Both Mankiewicz and Welles received Academy Awards for their screenplay. He was often asked to fix the screenplays of other writers, with much of his work uncredited. Occasional flashes of what came to be called the \\"Mankiewicz humor\\" and satire distinguished his films, and became valued in the films of the 1930s. The style of writing included a slick, satirical, and witty humor, which depended almost totally on dialogue to carry the film. It was a style that would become associated with the \\"typical American film\\" of that period. Among the screenplays he wrote or worked on, besides Citizen Kane, were The Wizard of Oz, Man of the World, Dinner at Eight, Pride of the Yankees, and The Pride of St. Louis. Mankiewicz's younger brother was Joseph L. Mankiewicz (1909‚Äì1993), also an Oscar-winning Hollywood director, screenwriter, and producer. Film critic Pauline Kael credits Mankiewicz with having written, alone or with others, \\"about forty of the films I remember best from the twenties and thirties. ... he was a key linking figure in just the kind of movies my friends and I loved best.\\" Personal life Herman Mankiewicz was born in New York City in 1897. His parents were German Jewish immigrants: his father, Franz Mankiewicz, was born in Berlin and emigrated to the U.S. from Hamburg in 1892. Franz arrived in the U.S. with his wife, a seamstress named Johanna Blumenau, who was from the German-speaking Kurland region.\\" The family lived first in New York and then moved to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where Herman's father accepted a teaching position. In 1909, Herman's brother, Joseph L. Mankiewicz (who himself would have a career as a successful writer, producer, and director), was born, and both boys and a sister spent their childhood there. Census records indicate the family lived on Academy Street. The family moved to New York City in 1913, and Herman graduated from Columbia University in 1917. After a period as managing editor of the American Jewish Chronicle, he became a flying cadet with the United States Army in 1917, and, in 1918, a private first class with the Marines, A.E.F. In 1919 and 1920, he became director of the American Red Cross News Service in Paris, and after returning to the U.S. married Sara Aaronson, of Baltimore. He took his bride overseas with him on his next job as a foreign correspondent in Berlin from 1920 to 1922, doing political reporting for George Seldes on the Chicago Tribune. He was a \\"bookish, introspective child who, despite his intelligence, was never able to win approval from his demanding father\\" who was known to belittle his achievements. He became an alcoholic, which hurt his career by the late 1930s. His children were screenwriter Don Mankiewicz (1922-2015), politician Frank Mankiewicz (1924-2014), and novelist Johanna Mankiewicz Davis (1937-1974). Early career While a reporter in Berlin for the Chicago Tribune, he also sent pieces on drama and books to The New York Times. At one point, he was hired in Berlin by dancer Isadora Duncan, to be her publicist in preparation for her return tour in America. At home again in the U.S., he took a job as a reporter for the New York World. He was known as a \\"gifted, prodigious writer,\\" and contributed to Vanity Fair, The Saturday Evening Post and numerous other magazines. While still in his twenties, he collaborated with Heywood Broun, Dorothy Parker, Robert E. Sherwood, and others on a revue, and collaborated with George S. Kaufman on a play, The Good Fellow, and with Marc Connelly on The Wild Man of Borneo. From 1923 to 1926, he was at The New York Times backing up George S. Kaufman in the drama department and soon after became the first regular theatre critic for The New Yorker, writing a weekly column during 1925 and 1926. He was a member of the Algonquin Round Table. His writing attracted the notice of film producer Walter Wanger who offered him a motion-picture contract and he soon moved to Hollywood. Success in Hollywood After a month in the movie business, Mankiewicz signed a year's contract at $400 a week plus bonuses. By the end of 1927, he was head of Paramount's scenario department, and film critic Pauline Kael, who wrote about him and the creation of Citizen Kane in \\"Raising Kane\\", her famous 1971 New Yorker article, wrote that \\"in January, 1928, there was a newspaper item reporting that he was in New York 'lining up a new set of newspaper feature writers and playwrights to bring to Hollywood,' and that 'most of the newer writers on Paramount's staff who contributed the most successful stories of the past year' were selected by 'Mank.'\\" Film historian Scott Eyman notes that Mankiewicz was put in charge of writer recruitment by Paramount. However, as \\"a hard-drinking gambler, he hired men in his own image: Ben Hecht, Bartlett Cormack, Edwin Justus Mayer, writers comfortable with the iconoclasm of big- city newsrooms who would introduce their sardonic worldliness to movie audiences.Eyman, Scott. The Speed of Sound: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution, 1926‚Äì1930, Simon and Schuster (1997) Kael notes that \\"beginning in 1926, Mankiewicz worked on an astounding number of films.\\" In 1927 and 1928, he did the titles (the printed dialogue and explanations) for at least twenty- five films that starred Clara Bow, Bebe Daniels, Nancy Carroll, Wallace Beery, and other public favorites. By then, sound had come in, and in 1929 he did the script as well as the dialogue for The Dummy, and did the scripts for many directors, including William Wellman and Josef von Sternberg. Other screenwriters made large contributions, too, but \\"probably none larger than Mankiewicz's,\\" according to Kael. At the beginning of the sound era he was one of the highest-paid writers in the world, because, Kael writes, \\"he wrote the kind of movies that were disapproved of as \\"fast\\" and immoral. His heroes weren't soft-eyed and bucolic; he brought good-humored toughness to the movies, and energy and astringency. And the public responded, because it was eager for modern American subjects.\\" He was described as \\"a Promethean wit bound in a Promethean body, one of the most entertaining men in existence ... [and] called the 'Central Park West Voltaire' by Ben Hecht.Louvish, Simon. Man on the Flying Trapeze: The Life and Times of W.C. Fields, W.W. Norton & Co. (1999) According to Kael, Mankiewicz did not work on every kind of picture. He didn't do Westerns, for example, and once, when a studio attempted to punish him for his customary misbehavior by assigning him to a Rin Tin Tin picture, he rebelled by turning in a script that began with the craven dog frightened by a mouse and reached its climax with a house on fire and the dog taking a baby into the flames. Style Shortly after his arrival on the West Coast, he sent a telegram to journalist-friend Ben Hecht in New York: \\"Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots. Don't let this get around.\\" He attracted other New York writers to Hollywood who contributed to a burst of creative, tough, and sardonic styles of writing for the fast-growing movie industry. What distinguished his screenplays were \\"occasional flashes of the Mankiewicz humor and satire that proved to be a foreshadowing of a new type of slick, satirical, typically American film that depended almost totally on dialogue for its success.\\" Between 1929 and 1935, he was credited with working on at least twenty films, many of which he received no credit for. Between 1930 and 1932 he was either producer or associate producer on four comedies and helped write their screenplays without credit: Laughter, Monkey Business, Horse Feathers, and Million Dollar Legs, which many critics considered one of the funniest comedies of the early 1930s. In 1933, he co- wrote Dinner at Eight, which was based on the George S. Kaufman/Edna Ferber play, and became one of the most popular comedies at that time and remains a \\"classic\\" comedy. The Wizard of Oz In February 1938, he was assigned as the first of ten screenwriters to work on The Wizard of Oz. Three days after he started writing he handed in a seventeen-page treatment of what was later known as \\"the Kansas sequence\\". While Baum devoted less than a thousand words in his book to Kansas, Mankiewicz almost balanced the attention on Kansas to the section about Oz. He felt it was necessary to have the audience relate to Dorothy in a real world before transporting her to a magic one. By the end of the week he had finished writing fifty-six pages of the script and included instructions to film the scenes in Kansas in black and white. His goal, according to film historian Aljean Harmetz, was to \\"capture in pictures what Baum had captured in words‚Äîthe grey lifelessness of Kansas contrasted with the visual richness of Oz.\\"Harmetz, Aljean. The Making of the Wizard of Oz, Hyperion (1998) He was not credited for his work on the film, however. Banned by the Nazis According to The New York Times, in 1935, while he was a staff writer for MGM, the studio was notified by Joseph Goebbels, then Minister of Education and Propaganda under Adolf Hitler, that films written by Mankiewicz could not be shown in Nazi Germany unless his name was removed from the screen credits. Citizen Kane Mankiewicz is best known for his collaboration with Orson Welles on the screenplay of Citizen Kane, for which they both won an Academy Award and later became a source of controversy over who wrote what. Pauline Kael attributed Kanes screenplay to Mankiewicz in a 1971 essay that was and continues to be strongly disputed. Much debate has centered on this issue, largely because of the importance of the film itself, which most agree is a fictionalized biography of newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst. According to film biographer David Thomson, however, \\"No one can now deny Herman Mankiewicz credit for the germ, shape, and pointed language of the screenplay ...\\"Thomson, David, A Biographical Dictionary of Film, 3rd ed. (1995) Alfred A. Knopf Mankiewicz biographer Richard Meryman notes that the dispute had various causes, including the way the movie was promoted. When RKO opened the movie on Broadway on May 1, 1941, followed by showings at theaters in other large cities, the publicity programs that were printed included photographs of Welles as \\"the one-man band, directing, acting, and writing.\\" In a letter to his father afterwards, Mankiewicz wrote, \\"I'm particularly furious at the incredibly insolent description of how Orson wrote his masterpiece. The fact is that there isn't one single line in the picture that wasn't in writingwriting from and by mebefore ever a camera turned.\\" According to film historian Otto Friedrich, it made Mankiewicz \\"unhappy to hear Welles quoted in Louella Parsons's column, before the question of screen credits was officially settled, as saying, 'So I wrote Citizen Kane.' Mankiewicz went to the Screen Writers Guild and declared that he was the original author. Welles later claimed that he planned on a joint credit all along, but Mankiewicz claimed that Welles offered him a bonus of ten thousand dollars if he would let Welles take full credit. ... The Screen Writers Guild eventually decreed a joint credit, with Mankiewicz's name first.\\"Friedrich, Otto, City of Nets ‚Äì a portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s, (1986) Harper & Row Some time later, Welles commented on this allegation: > God, if I hadn't loved him I would have hated him after all those ridiculous > stories, persuading people I was offering him money to have his name taken > off ... that he would be carrying on like this, denouncing me as a coauthor, > screaming around. Hearst's inner circle Mankiewicz became good friends with Hollywood screenwriter Charles Lederer, who was Marion Davies's nephew. Lederer grew up as a Hollywood habitu√©, spending much time at San Simeon, where Davies reigned as William Randolph Hearst's mistress. As one of his admirers in the early 1930s, Hearst often invited Mankiewicz to spend the weekend at San Simeon. \\"Herman told Joe [his brother] to come to the office of their mutual friend Charlie Lederer ...\\"Meryman, Richard. Mank (New York, William Morrow, 1978) \\"Mankiewicz found himself on story-swapping terms with the power behind it all, Hearst himself. When he had been in Hollywood only a short time, he met Marion Davies and Hearst through his friendship with Charles Lederer, a writer, then in his early twenties, whom Ben Hecht had met and greatly admired in New York when Lederer was still in his teens. Lederer, a child prodigy who had entered college at thirteen, got to know Mankiewicz ...\\"Kael, Pauline. For Keeps (New York, Penguin Books, 1994) Herman eventually \\"saw Hearst as 'a finagling, calculating, machiavellian figure.' But also, with Charlie Lederer, ... wrote and had printed parodies of Hearst newspapers ...\\" In 1939, Mankiewicz suffered a broken leg in a driving accident and had to be hospitalized. During his hospital stay, one of his visitors was Orson Welles, who met him earlier and had become a great admirer of his wit. During the months after his release from the hospital, he and Welles began working on story ideas which led to the creation of Citizen Kane. Despite Welles' denial that the film was about Hearst, few people were convinced‚Äîincluding Hearst. After the release of Citizen Kane, Hearst pursued a longtime vendetta against Mankiewicz and Welles for writing the story. \\"Certain elements in the film were taken from Mankiewicz's own experience: the sled Rosebud was based‚Äîaccording to some sources‚Äîon a very important bicycle that was stolen from him. ... [and] some of Kane's speeches are almost verbatim copies of Hearst's.\\" Most personally, the word \\"rosebud\\" was reportedly Hearst's private nickname for Davies' clitoris. Hearst's thoughts about the film are unknown; what is certain is that his extensive chain of newspapers and radio stations blocked all mentions of the film, and refused to accept advertising for it, while some Hearst employees worked behind the scenes to block or restrict its distribution. Academy Award celebration Citizen Kane was nominated for an Academy Award in every possible category, including Best Original Screenplay. Meryman writes, \\"Herman insisted he had no chance to win, though The Hollywood Reporter had given the film first place in ten of its twelve divisions. The fear of Hearst, he felt, was still alive. And Hollywood's resentment and distrust of Welles, the nonconformist upstart, were even greater since he had lived up to his wonderboy ballyhoo.\\" Neither Welles nor Mankiewicz attended the dinner, which was broadcast on radio. Welles was in South America filming It's All True, and Herman refused to attend. \\"He did not want to be humiliated,\\" said his wife, Sara. Richard Meryman describes the evening: > On the night of the awards, Herman turned on his radio and sat in his > bedroom chair. Sara lay on the bed. As the screenplay category approached, > he pretended to be hardly listening. Suddenly from the radio, half screamed, > came \\"Herman J. Mankiewicz.\\" Welles's name as coauthor was drowned out by > voices all through the audience calling out, \\"Mank! Mank! Where is he?\\" And > audible above all others was Irene Selznick: \\"Where is he?\\" George Schaefer accepted Herman's Oscar. \\"Except for this coauthor award, the Motion Picture Academy excommunicated Orson Welles,\\" wrote Meryman, \\"[and] as Pauline Kael put it, 'The members of the Academy ... probably felt good because their hearts had gone out to crazy, reckless Mank, their own resident loser-genius.\\" The film as a whole Richard Meryman concludes that \\"taken as a whole ... Citizen Kane was overwhelmingly Welles's film, a triumph of intense personal magic. Herman was one of the talents, the crucial one, that were mined by Welles. But one marvels at the debt those two self-destroyers owe to each other. Without Welles there would have been no supreme moment for Herman. Without Mankiewicz there would have been no perfect idea at the perfect time for Welles ... to confirm his genius ... The Citizen Kane script was true creative symbiosis, a partnership greater than the sum of its parts.\\" Other films Mankiewicz wrote and co-wrote many other major screenplays (including the original version of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and The Pride of the Yankees), Dinner at Eight, and The Pride of St. Louis. Alcoholism and death Mankiewicz was an alcoholic. Ten years before his death, he wrote: ‚ÄúI seem to become more and more of a rat in a trap of my own construction, a trap that I regularly repair whenever there seems to be danger of some opening that will enable me to escape. I haven‚Äôt decided yet about making it bomb proof. It would seem to involve a lot of unnecessary labor and expense.‚Äùhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/the-brothers-mankiewicz-review-a- steamroller-and-a-mensch-11571430954 A future Hollywood biographer went so far as to suggest that Mankiewicz‚Äôs behavior ‚Äúmade him seem erratic even by the standards of Hollywood drunks.‚Äù Herman Mankiewicz died March 5, 1953, of uremic poisoning, at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles. Following Mankiewicz‚Äôs death, Orson Welles was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúHe saw everything with clarity. No matter how odd or how right or how marvelous his point of view was, it was always diamond white. Nothing muzzy.‚Äù Critical legacy In looking back on his early films, Pauline Kael writes that Mankiewicz had, in fact, written (alone or with others) \\"about forty of the films I remember best from the twenties and thirties. I hadn't realized how extensive his career was. ... and now that I have looked into Herman Mankiewicz's career it's apparent that he was a key linking figure in just the kind of movies my friends and I loved best. These were the hardest-headed periods of American movies ... [and] the most highly acclaimed directors of that period, suggests that the writers ... in little more than a decade, gave American talkies their character.\\" Director and screenwriter Nunnally Johnson claimed that the \\"two most brilliant men he has ever known were George S. Kaufman and Herman Mankiewicz, and that Mankiewicz was the more brilliant of the two. ... [and] spearheaded the movement of that whole Broadway style of wisecracking, fast- talking, cynical-sentimental entertainment onto the national scene.\\" Depictions Mankiewicz is played by John Malkovich in RKO 281, about the battle over Citizen Kane. In July 2019, David Fincher announced he would be filming Mank, a black and white Mankiewicz biopic with Gary Oldman cast in the title role. It will begin streaming on Netflix on December 4, 2020.

With her keel laid down on 18 November 1972, Baton Rouge was launched on 26 April 1975. She became the second Los Angeles-class submarine to be commissioned, on 25 June 1977. In 1995, she was the first of her class to be decommissioned, after a collision with a Russian . Baton Rouge was the first and currently only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Design Baton Rouge was a nuclear attack submarine and, as such, was optimized for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and strike operations. To this end, she carried a complement of 26 weapons, including the Mark 48 ADCAP torpedoes ‚Äì the main weapon of U.S. Navy submarines, Harpoon anti-ship missiles and subsonic Tomahawk cruise missiles. The latter has a range of either 280 or 1,600 miles (450 or 2,500 km), depending on whether it is anti-ship or strike variant, and is nuclear- compatible, although this capability is deployed on Los Angeles-class submarines. Since the boat did not incorporate the vertical launching system found on later Los Angeles-class submarines, the Harpoons and Tomahawks were torpedo tube-launched. Baton Rouge can also lay Mobile Mark 67 and Mark 60 CAPTOR mines. The boat's propulsion system comprised a S6G pressurized-water reactor based on the D2G reactor of the and es of cruiser. Heat produced from the S6G reactor converted water into steam, powering two turbines, and thus the propeller shaft (see Nuclear marine propulsion). Although the U.S. Navy discloses the boat's submerged speed to be \\"25+ knots (28+ miles per hour; 46.3+ km/h),\\" non-military sources have claimed that Los Angeles-class submarines' top speed to be in excess of . The nuclear reactor had a lifespan of ten years. A crucial component in Baton Rouges ability to perform its mission were its comprehensive defensive, navigational and sonar systems. Among her several sonar sets were the TB-23/29 thin line passive towed array sonar, the Ametek BQS 15 close range high frequency active sonar and the Raytheon SADS-TG active detection sonar. These systems collaborated to give Baton Rouge good situational awareness. The boat's electronic support measures included a direction finding system, interceptor and a radar warner. Construction and commissioning The contract to build Baton Rouge was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding of Newport News, Virginia, on 8 January 1971, and her keel was laid down on 18 November 1972. Launched on 26 April 1975 in the presence of sponsor Mrs. Felix Edward Hebert, wife of the United States Representative from the First District and the former Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Baton Rouge was commissioned on 25 June 1977, with Commander Thomas C. Maloney as her first captain. Based at Norfolk and assigned to Submarine Squadron 8, Baton Rouges immediate history following the commissioning was characterized by shakedown training in New London, Connecticut, among other tests. During 5‚Äì29 July, she performed drills off the New England coast, returning to Norfolk for a month-long post-shakedown upkeep. From September 1977 to August 1978, she participated in numerous other tests, such as acoustic trials in Exuma Sound, The Bahamas, and weapons tests off Port Everglades, Florida. During this time, she returned periodically to Norfolk, and docked alongside , for upkeep, the longest of which spanned from February to August. Operational history In preparations for her first overseas assignment, Baton Rouge was deployed to New London in September for training before returning to Norfolk for last-minute checks prior to the deployment. She left port on 19 October 1978, and raised her first port of call in La Maddalena, Sardinia, on 1 November. Baton Rouge also visited La Spezia and took part in a variety of ASW exercises through the winter of 1978 and 1979. 200px The submarine returned to Norfolk from her first overseas assignment in March 1979. After post-deployment stand-down, Baton Rouge resumed normal operations later that year. These included participation in two major ASW exercises and visits to such widely-separated places as Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Halifax, Nova Scotia. In July, she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 8 but continued to use Norfolk as her base of operations. During September‚ÄìOctober, Baton Rouge participated in a major NATO exercise ‚Äì Operation Ocean Safari ‚Äì which took her across the Atlantic once more and included a call at Rotterdam, the Netherlands. She returned to Norfolk from that mission during the latter part of October and spent the remainder of 1979 in a restricted availability. In 1980, she was deployed to the Indian Ocean and circumnavigated the earth, passing through the International Date Line and the Panama Canal. For the deployment, she was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation when she arrived in Norfolk. As was the case in the Indian Pacific in 1980, in 1981 Baton Rouge again came under the command of Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT), after which she received the Meritorious Unit Commendation. For the third time, Baton Rouge came under the command of CINCPACFLT when she made her second deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. In the mid-1980s, the boat underwent an eighteen-month overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. The overhaul, which ended in spring 1986, saw the addition to Baton Rouge the AN/BQQ-5C sonar system, the CCS Mk-1 digital fire- control system, and the ESGN navigation system. She made her third deployment to the Mediterranean in November 1986, and her fourth in January 1990. Between these two assignment, Baton Rouge conducted a deployment to the North Atlantic, and was awarded her second Meritorious Unit Commendation. Collision with the Kostroma 200px At 20:16 local time on 11 February 1992, while on patrol off Kildin Island near Severomorsk, Baton Rouge under command of Cdr. Gordon Cremer collided with the Russian attack submarine K-276 Kostroma. The United States Navy stated that the collision occurred more than 12 miles (22 km) from the shore, in international waters. Initially the U.S. Navy denied any damage suffered by Baton Rouge, but it was later disclosed that the boat suffered two cuts, as well as dents and scrapes. K-276 Kostroma was fully repaired by 29 June 1992 and continues in service to this day while Baton Rouge was removed from service soon afterward. \\"Baton Rouge\\" was repaired to be 100% operational after the accident. The Navy was looking to make cuts in all classes of vessels at the time. \\"Baton Rouge\\" was just unlucky enough to be decommissioned for this reason. This is recorded in Russian navy lore as a victory and the crew of K-276 painted the number \\"1\\" bordered by a star on the sail, as did Soviet submarines during World War II to indicate the number of their victories. Decommissioning Less than two years later, on 1 November 1993, Baton Rouge was placed in commission in reserve. On 13 January 1995, she became the first Los Angeles-class submarine to be decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, after only 17¬Ω years in commission. After having been refueled (Baton Rouge was not), some of her sister ships have served 25 years or more. Ex-Baton Rouge entered the Nuclear Powered Ship-Submarine Recycling Program and ceased to exist on 30 September 1997. 200px 200px 200px ReferencesExternal links *Baton Rouge (SSN-689) *USS Baton Rouge (SSN-689) / Barracuda Category:Los Angeles- class submarines Category:Cold War submarines of the United States Category:Nuclear submarines of the United States Navy Category:United States Navy Louisiana-related ships Category:1975 ships Category:Ships built in Newport News, Virginia Category:Maritime incidents in 1992 ","title":"USS Baton Rouge"},{"id":"432516","text":"Jian Ghomeshi () is a Canadian musician, writer, and former CBC Radio broadcaster. From 1990 to 2000, he was a vocalist and drummer in the Thornhill-based folk-pop band Moxy Fr√ºvous. In the 2000s, he became a television and radio broadcaster. He has hosted, among others, the CBC Newsworld TV show >play (2002‚Äì2005), the CBC Radio One radio show The National Playlist (2005‚Äì2006), and the CBC Radio One show Q, which he co-created and hosted from 2007 to 2014, until fired by the CBC. Q, which features interviews with prominent cultural and entertainment figures, became the highest rated show in its timeslot in CBC history. In 2014 and 2015, Ghomeshi was the subject of allegations of sexual harassment or assault and was later arrested. In late 2015, Ghomeshi pleaded not guilty to the charges and his trial began in early 2016. He was acquitted of five of the charges on March 24, 2016. On May 11, 2016, the Crown withdrew the last remaining charge after Ghomeshi signed a peace bond and apologized to his accuser. In April 2017, Ghomeshi launched a new online venture, \\"The Ideation Project\\". On October 11, 2018, Ghomeshi's essay entitled \\"Reflections from a Hashtag\\" was published in The New York Review of Books, which led to widespread criticism for the magazine. Early life Ghomeshi was born in London, England, to Iranian parents Farhang (Frank), a civil engineer, and Azar (Sara) Ghomeshi. When he was a child, he was teased by classmates, who called him \\"Blackie\\". According to Ghomeshi, he grew up in a Muslim household, but elsewhere noted that his family was secular and celebrated Christmas and Easter. When Ghomeshi was seven, his father moved to Canada and got a job and Ghomeshi's family followed, first living in an apartment on Don Mills Road before settling in Thornhill, Ontario. Since there was not an Iranian expatriate community at that time in Canada, \\"Ghomeshi was extremely self-conscious of his appearance and his East London accent ... [and] he felt different.\\" He attended Thornlea Secondary School, where he was student council president. Ghomeshi described Thornhill as a \\"safe and quiet suburb where conformity was coveted ... The dwellings all looked relatively similar on our street, and most of the houses had big lawns and nice trees\\". His older sister, Jila Ghomeshi, is a professor of linguistics. Ghomeshi acknowledges that his parents had reservations at first that he did not pursue a more traditional career path, but that they still supported his career choices. Ghomeshi has written that, during his teenage years, he ensured that his clothes smelled of cigarette smoke to give him \\"social credibility\\" even though he was a non-smoker, dressed \\"new wave\\" and listened to music from David Bowie, Talking Heads, and Rush. Ghomeshi had an interest in music as a student and in Grade 9 started a short-lived band with a few of his school friends called Urban Transit. Ghomeshi attended York University beginning in 1985 in the theatre program (in his memoir 1982, he describes himself as a \\"theatre geek\\") and subsequently graduated with a BA in political science and a double minor in history and women's studies. According to a former York University student, in 1988 residence advisers at York warned a group of students that Ghomeshi had allegedly hit a couple of students. In 1989, Ghomeshi unsuccessfully attempted to overthrow the student government at York. In 1990, he was elected president of the Council of the York Federation of Students with a record-breaking number of votes and subsequently renamed the federation the York Federation of Students. As president, Ghomeshi promised increased funding for the Women's Centre, supported increased safety measures for women on campus and co-founded a pro-choice network. Jim Hounslow alleged that in the 1990‚Äì91 school year, when Ghomeshi was president and Hounslow was communications coordinator for the York Federation of Students, Ghomeshi grabbed Hounslow's genitals through his jeans while the two were in an elevator. Career=Music Moxy Fr√ºvous in 1993 (left to right: Dave Matheson, a long-haired Jian Ghomeshi, Murray Foster, Mike Ford) In 1983, Ghomeshi and friends Murray Foster, Tracy Jones, Reno Manfredi, and John Ruttle formed a band called Tall New Buildings. Tall New Buildings released two 12\\" EPs and played various gigs in and outside of Toronto before breaking up around 1988. Ghomeshi, Murray Foster and another bandmate, Mike Ford, then formed a band called The Chia Pets. In 1989, they were joined by Dave Matheson to form the politically satirical folk-pop band Moxy Fr√ºvous and together they recorded eight albums before going on permanent hiatus in 2001. Moxy Fr√ºvous was originally inspired by street-performing or busking bands and Ghomeshi and bandmates started out by playing on streets in Toronto. Ghomeshi sang and played drums. He was credited as \\"Jean\\" rather than Jian on the band's first album but reverted to the original spelling of his name for subsequent albums. A year after forming, Moxy Fr√ºvous was opening for headline performers like Bob Dylan. Moxy Fr√ºvous sold over 50,000 copies of their debut independent EP in 1992 (gold in Canada). Their debut album Bargainville went platinum in Canada in 1994 after selling over 100,000 copies. The band was also nominated for a Juno award as Band of the Year in 1994. Over the course of eight albums, they sold over 500,000 copies of their albums in Canada and the United States and made an appearance on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Ghomeshi released his first solo EP, The First 6 Songs, in July 2001. A 1996 video tape, revealed in 2014, suggested that Ghomeshi disdained his audiences, stating on camera that people paying to see the band's shows were \\"losers\\" and \\"fucking idiots\\". David Yuhnke, who was present at the recording, suspected that Ghomeshi was joking, recalling that the room's atmosphere was \\"sarcasm-laded\\", but added that he found it \\"hard to gauge entirely if he [Ghomeshi] was being serious or not\\". In 1999, Ghomeshi began a correspondence with a 16-year-old girl, Sally Block, who was a fan of Moxy Fr√ºvous. This continued for three years and included in-person meetings where Ghomeshi is alleged to have been \\"handsy\\" with her. In 2002, they had a falling out and Block broke into Ghomeshi's email account. Ghomeshi sought to have her banned from \\"FruCon\\" ‚Äì a Moxy Fr√ºvous convention ‚Äì and wanted criminal charges to be pressed against her. She was allowed to attend FruCon and Ghomeshi dropped the issue after her father confronted him for \\"carrying on this type of relationship with an underage girl\\". Ghomeshi's production company, Jian Ghomeshi Productions Inc., managed musician Martina Sorbara (now of the band Dragonette) and produced music for Dar Williams. He managed electropop artist Lights from 2007 until 2014, during which time she won the Juno Award for Best New Artist and was nominated for several more. Lights initially supported Ghomeshi after he was accused of sexual abuse in 2014, but later dropped him as her manager, saying: \\"I rushed to defend my manager of 12 years. I am now aware that my comments appear insensitive to those impacted and for that I am deeply sorry\\". Radio and television Ghomeshi interviewing right In 2002, Ghomeshi became host of CBC Newsworld's >play, a show about the arts in Canada and abroad. >play ran for three seasons and won a Gemini Award. He also did the weekly entertainment report on the Toronto edition of Canada Now , as well as wrote columns for The Toronto Star and The Globe and Mail. In 2006, he finished a documentary series entitled The End, which described technology's effects on television, radio, and print as well as the future of the media. He hosted the radio series 50 Tracks and 50 Tracks: The Canadian Version on CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2. From fall 2005 until spring 2006, he hosted a program on Radio One called The National Playlist. From April 16, 2007, to October 26, 2014, Ghomeshi was the host of Q, a program airing twice daily on CBC Radio One, and on over 170 stations in the United States over Public Radio International. Ghomeshi became \\"famous as the coolly insightful host of Q, a marquee interviewer with a mellifluous voice that he would tune to the cadence of his guest, fostering a sense of intimacy\\". As the host of Q, Ghomeshi interviewed a range of musicians, artists, actors, and other notable figures, a list that included filmmaker Woody Allen, former Beatle Paul McCartney, novelist Salman Rushdie, journalist Barbara Walters, former Star Trek star William Shatner, rapper Jay-Z, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, and Canadian musical icon Leonard Cohen. In 2012, Ghomeshi received the Gold Award for best talk show host at the New York Festivals' International Radio Awards. By 2013, with Ghomeshi as the show‚Äôs host, Q had a weekly audience of more than 2.5 million listeners weekly in Canada and 550,000 listeners in the United States. During his time as host of Q, Ghomeshi many times booked guests who shared his agent and lawyer without disclosing this connection. Ghomeshi hosted the 2009 Dora Mavor Moore Awards ceremony. He was set to host the November 2014 Scotiabank Giller Prize awards gala but was replaced in October by comedian Rick Mercer. In November 2014, he was replaced as the host of the CBC competition Canada Reads by Wab Kinew, the previous year's winner. In December 2014 the CBC announced that it would not be rebroadcasting Ghomeshi's interviews and it would be removing them from the CBC's online archive. Reactions to this decision were swift and varied and, after further deliberations by CBC management, the decision was reversed. =Billy Bob Thornton interview= On April 8, 2009, actor and musician Billy Bob Thornton appeared with his band, The Boxmasters, on Q, with Ghomeshi hosting. In introducing Thornton, Ghomeshi mentioned Thornton's acting career and added, \\"he's always intended to make music, he just got sidetracked.\\" In responding to Ghomeshi's subsequent interview questions, Thornton acted confused and gave vague, evasive answers. When asked about his musical tastes and influences as a child, Thornton answered with a rambling commentary about his favourite childhood magazine, Famous Monsters of Filmland. Later in the interview, Thornton said that the reason for his uncooperative answers was that Ghomeshi had been \\"instructed not to discuss\\" his film career but had done so. Thornton said that Canadians did not get up and move or throw things at concerts, and referred to them as \\"mashed potatoes without the gravy\\".Billy Bob Thornton 'Blow Up' on Q TV (video), YouTube, April 8, 2009 Ghomeshi replied, \\"Oh, we've got some gravy up here as well.\\" Ghomeshi described the interview as one of the most difficult he has conducted. He compared the international media exposure that followed the interview to being \\"in the middle of a tsunami\\". After the show, Canadians responded to Ghomeshi's \\"professionalism and the manner in which he handled the situation ... [and] the show received more than 100,000 e-mails with almost unanimous praise for the host\\". =Dismissal from the CBC= In the spring of 2014, Ghomeshi advised his employers at the CBC that the Toronto Star was looking into allegations by an ex-girlfriend that he had engaged in non-consensual rough sex and that he denied this accusation. The crisis management firm Navigator was hired to work for both Ghomeshi and the CBC. In early summer of 2014, reporter Jesse Brown contacted the CBC and warned that Ghomeshi's behaviour may have crossed into his work environment. The CBC investigated and concluded that there were no workplace complaints against Ghomeshi. According to an investigation by the CBC's The Fifth Estate, \\"almost all known staffers on ... Q said they were not contacted by CBC management as part of any investigation\\". Ghomeshi denied the accusations again and the Toronto Star declined to go forward with the story at that time. In October 2014, Brown tweeted that he was working on a story that would be \\"worse than embarrassing for certain parties\\". Brown later said that he was referring to another story but Ghomeshi requested a meeting with CBC on October 23. During that meeting, the CBC viewed what it later described as \\"graphic evidence that Jian had caused physical injury to a woman\\". According to Vice, Ghomeshi showed his bosses lewd text messages on a CBC-owned phone and graphic personal sex videos. On October 24, Ghomeshi announced he was taking an indefinite leave of absence from the network to deal with personal matters. Two days later, the CBC terminated Ghomeshi's employment, with a CBC spokesperson saying \\"information came to our attention recently that in CBC's judgment precludes us from continuing our relationship with Jian\\". Ghomeshi subsequently released a \\"lengthy Facebook post\\" saying his dismissal was motivated by fear of an alleged smear campaign by an ex-girlfriend that according to Ghomeshi could release private details about his sexual life. Ghomeshi also said he refused an offer by the CBC to \\"walk away quietly\\". Chris Boyce, the head of CBC Radio, denied that such an offer was made. Ghomeshi filed a $55 million lawsuit against the CBC, alleging that the broadcaster misused \\"personal and confidential information provided to it in confidence\\". He also filed \\"a union grievance alleging wrongful dismissal and defamation\\", and stated through his lawyer that he \\"does not engage in non- consensual role play or sex and any suggestion of the contrary is defamatory\\". Ghomeshi withdrew his lawsuit on November 25, 2014. The terms of settlement stipulated that Ghomeshi will pay the CBC $18,000 in legal costs. Literature Ghomeshi hosting a Canadian Film Centre event on May 8, 2014. Ghomeshi's literary debut, 1982, is a creative non-fiction title, about that year of his youth. It was released on September 18, 2012. It is a memoir of Ghomeshi's life at the age of 14 (during 1982) growing up as an Iranian- Canadian in Thornhill, Ontario (a suburb of Toronto), his attempt to fit in as one of the few non-white kids in his neighbourhood, and his goal of mimicking his idol David Bowie. 1982 received a mixed reception from critics. Canadian poet, novelist and TV writer Zoe Whittall called it a \\"funny, nostalgic and compelling read, especially for music nerds of a certain age,\\" while Stephen Carlick criticized the book, saying that Ghomeshi's attempt to appeal to the varied audience that listens to his CBC Radio program Q made it \\"uneven and often tedious\\" to read, making the reader question who the book was for after the prologue, which Carlick referred to as \\"1982 for Dummies\\". Carlick also noted that \\"Ghomeshi is a nice guy ... inoffensive and genial\\", but the book, by \\"trying to appeal to everyone\\", is spread \\"too thin\\". On November 2, 2012, Ghomeshi's review of the film Argo was published in The Globe and Mail. While Ghomeshi calls the film about the 1979-1980 hostage crisis \\"enthralling\\" and \\"entertaining\\", he says it has a \\"problematic\\" and \\"deeply troubling portrayal of the Iranian people\\", who are depicted as villainous \\"hordes of hysterical, screaming, untrustworthy, irrational, bearded and lethal antagonists\\". In October 2014 his publisher, Penguin Random House Canada, announced that it would not publish his second book \\"in light of recent events\\" following allegations of sexual abuse. On October 11, 2018, Ghomeshi's article entitled \\"Reflections from a Hashtag\\", a 3,000 word essay, was published in The New York Review of Books. On October 25, 2018, the magazine's editors acknowledged that Ghomeshi's essay generated \\"considerable criticism from readers\\", and they admitted to \\"failures in the presentation and editing of his story\\", stating that readers should have been informed about the \\"serious nature and number of allegations against Mr. Ghomeshi\\"; as well, the editors amended the online version of the essay, adding a summary of these allegations. The Guardian article entitled \\"How one article capsized a New York literary institution\\" states that publishing Ghomeshi's essay led to a \\"storm of criticism\\" from major figures in the literary world, an apology from the publisher, and the firing of editor Ian Buruma. In response to this essay in The New York Review of Books, Jesse Brown of \\"Canadaland\\" podcast wrote the following analysis: \\"The piece is filled with inaccuracies, omissions, evasions, and mischaracterizations about what he [Ghomeshi] did, what he is alleged to have done, and what happened to him as a result ‚Äî much of which are matters of public record.\\" Also, Brown stated that while \\"The New York Review of Books presented Ghomeshi‚Äôs essay under the grave cover headline ‚ÄúTHE FALL OF MEN‚Äù, the \\"fall of Jian Ghomeshi is not indicative of the fall of men, mankind, masculinity, or anything so dire. It was the fall of one man who, by his own admission, was hurting people and abusing his power...\\". The Ideation Project Ghomeshi at the Harvest Celebration in September 2017. In April 2017, Ghomeshi launched a new creative endeavor called The Ideation Project. The Ideation Project is a music and podcast series featuring all original words, music, recordings and production by Ghomeshi, which has Ghomeshi commenting on a range of cultural and newsworthy topics. Ghomeshi launched The Ideation Project with a monologue called \\"Exiles\\" on the topic of what it means to not have a homeland. Season 1 includes 13 \\"tracks\\" on various subjects. The web series, distributed by Ron Hartenbaum's WYD Media Management was described by The Globe and Mail as a \\"less than triumphant return\\" despite what they refer to as his slick voice and delivery. Additional backlash to Ghomeshi's return to media resulted in Art19 backing out of hosting the media files, which were subsequently relocated to SoundCloud. Adam Ragusea's review of the first four episodes of The Ideation Project for Slate calls it \\"a podcast version of Ghomeshi‚Äôs signature opening essay segment\\" on the CBC show Q. However, Ragusea says that without that CBC show's \\"crack team of producers behind him, the top-tier guests they booked, [and] the cultural ‚Äúmoment‚Äù the show inhabited\\", he thinks there is not anything \\"particularly special about Jian Ghomeshi\\" when he is podcasting alone. Ragusea criticizes Ghomeshi's \\"hackneyed\\" platitudes about culture and society, the tone of \\"self-righteous self-pity\\", and the way the monologues are delivered, in a rhyming rap style over Ghomeshi's own electronica loops. Roqe In mid-April 2020, Ghomeshi started Roqe, a new podcast series, which is aimed at an audience of Iranian- Canadians and the global Iranian diaspora. Roqe focuses on Iranian culture- related topics and has interviews with guests of interest to its target audience. Examples of guests include Dr. Hamed Esmaeilion (episode 1.1), kickboxer Farinaz Kari (episode 1.2), and Bollywood actress/model Mandana Karimi (episode 8). The name \\"Roqe\\" is a Farsi word that means \\"candid, or straightforward in conversation.\\" With the support of \\"unnamed investors\\" and a well-known member of the Iranian-Canadian community, Mehrdad Ariannejad, Roqe can afford higher production values than The Ideation Project. Ariannejad is the founding member of the Iranian Canadian Congress (ICC) who has been awarded a Queen‚Äôs Diamond Jubilee Medal. He is also known for organizing a cultural festival for the Iranian-Canadian community. In an interview with Jesse Brown, Ariannejad said Ghomeshi is his friend and he says he (Ariannejad) \\"never believed\\" many of the women who came forward during Ghomeshi's trial. Ariannejad stated that \\"[w]e know that most of the successful people, many successful people, have their enemies and friends...\\". Ariannejad says he informs guests about Ghomeshi's trial before they appear on the show. On May 9, 2020, the current president of the Iranian Canadian Congress, Soudeh Ghasemi, said that her group is \\"extremely disturbed by comments made by Mehrdad Ariannejad speaking about the accusations of sexual violence against Mr. Ghomeshi\\", in which Ariannejad said he did not believe the women. Ghasemi said, \\"These comments in our opinion are unacceptable and extremely disturbing,\\" and she clarified that \\"...Mr. Ariannejad currently has no executive role at the ICC and he does not represent the point of view of the ICC on this issue.\\" Criminal charges and trial On November 26, 2014, following termination by the CBC, Ghomeshi turned himself in to Toronto Police and was charged with four counts of sexual assault and one count of overcoming resistance by choking, after an investigation that began on October 31, 2014. The charges concern three separate women.Section 246, Criminal Code of Canada, overcoming resistance (choking) on Wikibooks He appeared in court on the same day and was released on $100,000 bail on the conditions that he surrender his passport, stay within Ontario and live with his mother. Ghomeshi appeared in court again on January 8, 2015, and was charged with three additional counts of sexual assault related to three more women. In a court appearance on February 26, 2015, a judicial pretrial was set for March 27, 2015, and was later put over to April 28, 2015. His lawyer, Marie Henein, stated that he would plead not guilty to all charges. On October 1, 2015, Ghomeshi pleaded not guilty to one count of choking and four counts of sexual assault. Ghomeshi's trial began on February 1, 2016, and lasted eight days. On March 24, 2016, the judge acquitted Ghomeshi of all charges on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The inconsistency and \\"outright deception\\" of the witnesses' testimony had irreparably weakened the prosecution's case. Judge William Horkins accused the complainants of \\"lying or trying to conceal evidence from the court\\". Lawyer Marie Heinen was able to access thousands of messages between Ghomeshi's accusers and presented them during the trial. A second trial for one additional charge was scheduled for June 2016. On May 11, 2016, however, the Crown withdrew the last remaining charge, re: the alleged sexual assault against the producer of Q, Kathryn Borel, after Ghomeshi signed a peace bond which does not include an admission of guilt. (The publication ban as to the name of the victim, Borel, was lifted on May 11, 2016.) According to Borel, Henein approached Borel's representation to ask for an alternative to a trial, and after several exchanges Ghomeshi agreed to apologize to Borel and did so formally. Afterwards, Borel issued a formal statement to the media, maintaining that Ghomeshi was guilty of sexual assault, but that \\"a trial would have maintained his lie, the lie that he was not guilty, and would have further subjected me to the very same pattern of abuse that I am currently trying to stop\\". Personal life Ghomeshi was diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder in about 2009Date based on 2014 Toronto Life article which says it occurred \\"roughly five years ago\\". after suffering a panic attack. He began seeing a psychologist on a weekly basis. Ghomeshi told journalist Courtney Shea that the psychological issues arose because of \\"[f]eeling like an outsider because of my Iranian background, trust issues. A lot of not feeling good enough\\". At the urging of his therapist, Ghomeshi purchased a teddy bear to replace his childhood toy and help him deal with his anxiety. Ghomeshi has a tattoo of his father's signature in Persian on his right arm. ReferencesNotesFurther reading * Donovan, Kevin. Secret Life: The Jian Ghomeshi Investigation. 2016.

Its boundaries are the Cross-Bronx Expressway to the north, Crotona-Prospect Avenue to the east, East 161st Street to the south, and Webster Avenue to the west. Third Avenue is the primary thoroughfare through Morrisania. The name derives from the Manor of Morrisania, the vast 2,000 acre estate of the powerful and aristocratic Morris family, who at one time owned most of the Bronx as well as much of New Jersey. The family includes Lewis Morris, 4th Lord of the Manor, and a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and Gouverneur Morris, penman of the United States Constitution. Both are buried in the crypt at St. Ann's Church of Morrisania. Today the name is most commonly associated with the neighborhood of Morrisania, which is only a small corner of the original Morrisania. Morrisania is part of Bronx Community Board 3, and its ZIP Codes include 10456 and 10459. The area is patrolled by the NYPD's 42nd Precinct. NYCHA property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 7 at 737 Melrose Avenue in the Melrose section of the Bronx. History Early view of Morrisania from Harlem From 1644 to the early 20th century, the land of the neighborhood was the estate of the Morris family in Westchester County. In 1790, Lewis Morris, owner of the estate and signer of the Declaration of Independence, proposed the land as the site of the federal capital. The area was sparsely populated until 1840, when Gouverneur Morris Jr., son of the famous congressional delegate and nephew of Lewis, allowed a railroad to be built across the property. In 1848, he sold the land next to the line for the development of a new town called Morrisania Village. In 1855, additional settlements along the rail line became the town of Morrisania, with its political center in the original 1840 village (which eventually incorporated in 1864http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/arch_reports/90.pdf). At first the village was an early forerunner of today's bedroom communities, populated by people who worked in Manhattan, but it quickly developed its own local industries and craftsmen as it developed into a full-fledged town. In 1874, the area was annexed to New York City (then consisting only of Manhattan) as part of the Twenty-Third Ward. In 1887, the Third Avenue Elevated was extended to the area to provide easy and quick access to and from Manhattan. By the time the New York City Subway was extended to the area in 1904, a large influx of European immigrants had given the neighborhood an urban character, with tenements replacing houses as the dominant form of dwelling. Old Morrisania Morrisania Town Hall In the 1950s along with changing demographics, Robert Moses destroyed various tenements in favor of a colony of public housing. After the construction of the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the poverty that East Tremont suffered spread into Morrisania. As a result, and also due to the aggressive 1968 Program for Action, the Third Avenue El closed in 1973. During this time period a wave of arson destroyed or damaged many of the residential, commercial, and industrial structures in the area. Many social problems associated with poverty, from crime to drug addiction, have plagued the area for some time. Despite crime declines versus their peaks during the crack and heroin epidemics, violent crime continues to be a serious problem in the community. Morrisania has significantly higher drop-out rates and incidents of violence in its schools.NYC Dropout Rates Other problems in local schools include low test scores and high truancy rates. Drug addiction is also a serious problem in the community. Due to the lucrative drug trade in the area, many addicts reside in the community. Peer pressure among children who come from broken homes contributes to the high rate of usage. Many households in the area are headed by a single mother, which contributes to the high poverty rate. Single parent homes often have a harder time providing at the same level as two-parent homes. Many of the families living in Morrisania have been in poverty for generations. The incarceration rate in the area is also very high.NYC Prison Expenditure Morrisania is home to a significant number of inmates currently held in New York state prison and jail facilities. After a wave of arson ravaged the low income communities of New York City throughout the 1970s, most of the residential structures in Morrisania were left seriously damaged or destroyed. The city began to rehabilitate many formally abandoned tenement style apartment buildings and designate them low income housing beginning in the late 1970s. Also many subsidized attached multi-unit townhouses and newly constructed apartment buildings have been or are being built on vacant lots across the neighborhood. Demographics Today's Morrisania is a low-income neighborhood that predominantly consists of Latin Americans and African Americans. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Morrisania was 37,865, a change of 8,068 (21.3%) from the 29,797 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012. Accessed June 16, 2016. The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 1.4% (523) White, 38.4% (14,531) African American, 0.2% (94) Native American, 0.5% (205) Asian, 0% (11) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (127) from other races, and 0.9% (339) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 58.2% (22,035) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016.

Adams (DDG-2), named for Charles Francis Adams III (Secretary of the Navy from 1929 to 1933), was the lead ship of her class of guided missile destroyers of the United States Navy. History The ship was laid down by the Bath Iron Works at Bath, Maine, on 16 June 1958, launched on 8 September 1959 by Mrs. R. Homans, sister of Mr. Adams, commissioned on 10 September 1960, and stationed in its homeport of Charleston, South Carolina. Intended as a follow-on to the s, the ship was originally designated as DD-952. Outwardly similar to the Forrest Sherman class, Charles F. Adams was the first U.S. Navy ship designed from the keel up to launch anti-aircraft missiles. To reflect the increased capabilities of the ship and to distinguish her from previous destroyer designs, Charles F. Adams was re-designated DDG-2 prior to the ship's launching. USS Charles F. Adams at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard Following commissioning, Charles F. Adams took part in recovery operations for Walter M. Schirra's Mercury 8 mission. While engaged in this operation the Cuban Missile Crisis developed and Charles F. Adams moved to the Caribbean Sea as part of the quarantine forces around the island of Cuba. In July 1969, Charles F. Adams left her homeport of Charleston and relocated to Mayport, Florida. On 19 November 1980 Charles F. Adams under the command of Commander Joseph F. McCarton, sailed with and her battle group to the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, during which the ship made a port call to the town of Bunbury, Western Australia from 3-7 February 1981. Charles F. Adams returned home to Mayport on 9 June 1981. Decommission Charles F. Adams was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 August 1990 and is being held for donation at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Pennsylvania. The Saginaw Valley Naval Ship Museum attempted to acquire the ship as a museum and memorial to be located in Bay City, Michigan; however, the cost of preparing the ship for movement through the Saint Lawrence Seaway proved too expensive and the project was abandoned. Present use As of September 2008, Charles F. Adams remains at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on Donation Hold status. She was considered for preservation by the Adams Class Veteran's Association and the Jacksonville Historic Naval Ship Association (JHNSA) in Jacksonville, Florida. An application was delivered 31 March 2008. In October 2010, the Jacksonville City Council supported efforts to bring the ship to that city as a museum. The preservation effort will require approximately $300,000 to tow the ship to Jacksonville, $3 million for repairs and restoration of the vessel, and $5 million to construct a pier to moor it. As of late 2013, the preservation groups had raised about $1.4 million. On 27 August 2014 the Jacksonville City Council approved a lease of city-owned riverfront property to the JHNSA and authorized the Downtown Investment Authority to manage the project. The groups expected to have the ship moored downtown on the St. Johns River by the end of 2015. Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shad Khan's proposal to develop the riverfront includes a location for the ship.\\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" no more: Jags owner unveils proposal to redevelop Jacksonville Shipyards. Retrieved 18 February 2015. In December 2018 plans to bring Charles F.

Adams left Philadelphia Navy Yard under tow, bound for Brownsville, Texas, where she will be scrapped.

John King was laid down by the Bath Iron Works at Bath in Maine on 25 August 1958, launched on 30 January 1960 by Mrs. Paul J. Kilday, wife of Representative Kilday of Texas and commissioned on 4 February 1961; Comdr. Albert M. Sackett in command. John King was ordered as DD-953, reclassified as DDG-953 on 16 August 1956 and reclassified as DDG-3 on 26 June 1957. John King participated in blockade duties during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.  1960s  Following shakedown training out of Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, John King carried out weapons tests on the East Coast before arriving Norfolk 7 September 1961 for regular duty. One of a new class of guided missile destroyers, she featured latest hull design with all-aluminum superstructure and mounted the very latest in modern armament and electronic equipment. Departing 27 November 1961, the ship cruised to England and Northern Europe until 1 January 1962, when she sailed from Dublin for the Mediterranean. There, John King joined the 6th Fleet in its constant role of peacekeeping in this troubled region. After her return to Norfolk, Virginia in April, the ship conducted missile firing exercises and training in the Caribbean. She arrived Washington 10 July 1962 for a 4-day stay, entertaining a group of Senators and Congressmen as well as Secretary of the Navy Fred Korth. Following additional exercises, John King entered Norfolk Navy Yard 11 October 1962. Soon afterward, the introduction of offensive missiles into Cuba precipitated a crisis; and, as Navy ships placed a quarantine around the island, the ship quickly finished her repairs and joined the blockade 6 November. After the crisis eased, the ship remained in the Caribbean operating with the Navy's newest and biggest carrier, the nuclear-powered USS Enterprise (CVN-65). She returned to Norfolk 8 December 1962. John King departed for her second Mediterranean cruise 6 February 1963. After visiting various ports on 6th Fleet maneuvers, she steamed to Kiel, Germany, 23 June 1963, then returned to Norfolk 17 July 1963. The next twelve months were spent on training and readiness exercises off the Virginia Capes and in the Caribbean, including a week at the Anti-submarine Warfare School, Key West, Florida, in April 1964. The destroyer sailed for the Mediterranean Sea once more 3 August 1964 and joined the 6th Fleet 16 August near the strife-torn island of Cyprus. She remained in the Mediterranean until the end of 1964. John King returned to Norfolk 29 January and operated along the East Coast until sailing for the \\"Med\\" 14 October. Following 4 months of operations with the 6th Fleet, she returned to Norfolk 7 March 1966. In the summer she visited the Mediterranean and recrossed the Atlantic on NATO Exercise \\"Straight Laced.\\" Back at homeport in the fall she operated out of Norfolk until sailing for another 6th Fleet deployment 10 January 1967. Her movements were concentrated in the Western Mediterranean until she sailed for home 11 May. Arriving Norfolk on the 19th, John King entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard 27 June 1967 for an overhaul to prepare for future service.  Final years of service  Throughout the 70's and 80's, John King participated various NATO exercises and supported Atlantic Fleet operations during the Cold War. In 1982, John King was off the coast of Beirut, Lebanon, providing gunfire support to the U.S. Marines. John King was decommissioned on 30 March 1990, was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 12 January 1993 and sold for scrap on 10 February 1999.

Part of Lake Washington, it is bounded by the Laurelhurst neighborhood to the north and the Montlake and Madison Park neighborhoods to the south. The Evergreen Point Floating Bridge, which carries State Route 520, crosses over a portion of the bay. Marsh Island and Foster Island are located in Union Bay, and are connected to the mainland (and each other) by the Arboretum Waterfront Trail and the Foster Island Trail. Union Bay ends at the eastern opening of the Montlake Cut, which connects Union Bay with Portage Bay (an arm of Lake Union) to the west‚Äîthis marks the beginning of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, which runs through Seattle and connects Lake Washington to Puget Sound. Broken Island is adjacent to Husky Stadium and was formed in 1916 when Lake Washington was lowered several feet by the opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal. The island, and the wetlands in which it sits on the lake's shore, were \\"the result of conversion of shallow water lake habitats following lake level lowering.\\" The island's soil is mostly peat laid down from earlier times.

Ancestors of the Native American Duwamish tribe today, until the 1850s the D _kh_ w‚ÄôDuw‚ÄôAbsh, \\"the People of the Inside\\", of the (Skagit-Nisqually) Lushootseed Coast Salish nations had villages around Union Bay. The village of hehs-KWEE-kweel (\\"skate\\") was of the hloo-weelh-AHBSH (from s'hloo-WEELH, \\"a tiny hole drilled to measure the thickness of a canoe\\"), for the narrow passage through then-large and resource-rich Union Bay marsh. Traces of the marsh survive as the Union Bay Natural Area and the Foster Island area of north Washington Park Arboretum. The trees and the island of Stitici (Stee-tee-tchee) were their ceremonial burial ground. Stitici, Little Island, is now called Foster Island.Thomas Speer quoted in Switzer The village was at the northeast tip of what is now Madison Park. One of the longhouses (forerunners of cohousing for tens of people) may have been used as a potlatch house.

Villages were diffuse. Cheshiahud or Lake John and his family were among the memorable residents around Union Bay in the early decades of Seattle.

Adams class guided-missile destroyer in the United States Navy. It was the fifth ship named after Captain James Lawrence USN (1781‚Äì1813). The USS Lawrence served on blockade duty during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 and, in 1972, was part of \\"Operation Linebacker\\" in the west Pacific.  Construction  USS Lawrence was laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey on October 27, 1958. The ship was launched on February 27, 1960, by Mrs. Fernie C. Hubbard, the great-great-granddaughter of Captain James Lawrence. The ship was commissioned on January 6, 1962, and commanded by Thomas W. Walsh. After a shakedown cruise on the Great Lakes, USS Lawrence proceeded to Naval Station Norfolk for duty in the Atlantic Fleet.  Service history = Cuba  Following the rapid development of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, the warship deployed with Task Group 136.1, a surface quarantine group of cruisers composed of USS Canberra (CAG-2), USS Newport News (CA-148), three guided-missile destroyers including USS Lawrence, and twelve escorts. The group took up a blocking position north of Cuba on October 24, 1962, two days into the crisis. On Friday, October 26, 1962, USS Lawrence and MacDonough (DLG-8) began shadowing MT Grozny, a tanker proceeding towards Cuba. The next day, the Soviet Union agreed to defuse the crisis and military forces on both sides began standing down.  Mediterranean  After returning to Norfolk on December 6, 1962, USS Lawrence began the first of many Mediterranean cruises on 6 February 1963, steaming across the Atlantic to join the Sixth Fleet for operations in European waters, where she remained until July 1, 1963. Following a second Mediterranean deployment between April and August 1964, the warship received an extensive overhaul in Norfolk over the ensuing winter. Before the end of the decade, she conducted four more cruises; a Sixth Fleet deployment (August 24, 1965 to December 17, 1965), a NATO exercise in the North Atlantic (August 3, 1966 to September 5, 1966), another Mediterranean tour (September 27, 1966 to February 1, 1967) and a third Sixth Fleet cruise (January 10, 1968 to May 4, 1968). During her fourth Mediterranean deployment, USS Lawrence helped rescue crewmen from the sinking merchant vessel New Meadow, in distress off the coast of Crete.  West Pacific  Following two additional Mediterranean deployments, one in 1969 and another in 1971, the much-traveled destroyer made one Vietnam War tour in the Western Pacific from 1972 to 1973, providing naval gunfire support, rescuing downed aviators and serving as plane guard during aircraft carrier operations. Among her guests on Yankee Station were the Chief of Naval Operations and Secretary of the Navy. As the U.S.S. Lawrence came through the locks in the Panama canal, her sister ship was sabotaged by a crewman that dropped a large wrench into the main reduction gear shaft, causing her to be towed to San Diego for repairs while the USS Lawrence sailed on to Vietnam and engaged in \\"Operation Linebacker\\". At the time, she was affectionately known as the \\"Leapin Larry\\" by her crew. For her service, she was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation.  Sixth Fleet  Two more Sixth Fleet cruises followed in 1977-78 and 1979, and during the latter she briefly visited the Black Sea. USS Lawrence circumnavigated Africa en route to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, deployment that took place in 1974. USS Lawrence passed through the Mediterranean en route to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, deployments that took place in 1980 and 1983 to 1984.  Caribbean  USS Lawrence also saw frequent service closer to home, in the western Atlantic and Caribbean, and occasionally visited other waters. In 1986, she circumnavigated around South America as part of Operation Unitas XVII, exercising with Latin American navies and visiting ports in Puerto Rico, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil. During that deployment, she served as the flagship for Destroyer Squadron 26.  Decommissioning  The USS Lawrence was decommissioned on March 30, 1990 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on May 16, 1990. The ship was sold for scrap on April 15, 1994. The Navy repossessed the ship in October 1996 after the ship breaking company failed, and it was finally resold for scrap on February 10, 1999.

She has been called one of America's 100 most popular writers for children and some of her work has become mandatory reading in many schools throughout the nation. Indeed, because her books have sold so well she is also cited as one of the Educational Paperback Association's top 100 authors. Speare is one of six writers with two Newbery Medals recognizing the year's \\"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\\". In 1989 she received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal for her contributions to American children's literature. Life Speare was born in Melrose, Massachusetts to Harry Allan and Demetria Simmons George. Her childhood, as she later recalled, was \\"exceptionally happy\\" and Melrose was \\"an ideal place in which to have grown up, close to fields and woods where we hiked and picnicked, and near to Boston where we frequently had family treats of theaters and concerts.\\" She had an extended family with one brother and many aunts, uncles, and cousins, and most importantly, very loving and supportive parents. Speare lived much of her life in New England, the setting for many of her books. Speare discovered her gift for writing at the age of eight and began composing stories while still in high school. After completing her Bachelor of Arts degree at Smith College in 1930, she earned her Master's degree in English from Boston University and taught English at several private Massachusetts high schools from 1932 to 1936. In 1936 she met her future husband, Alden Speare, and together the two moved to Connecticut where they married and raised two children; Alden, Jr., who was born in 1939, and Mary in 1942. Although Speare always intended to write, the challenges and responsibilities of being a mother and wife drained her of any free time. Speare began to focus seriously on literature when her children were in junior high school. Literary career Speare's first published work was a magazine article about skiing with her children. She also wrote many other magazine articles based on her experiences as a mother, and even experimented with one- act plays. Eventually her work saw circulation in Better Homes and Gardens, Woman's Day, Parents, and American Heritage. Speare's first book, Calico Captive, was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1957. It features a colonial New Hampshire family kidnapped by Native Americans in 1754. The next year she completed her second historical novel, The Witch of Blackbird Pond, which won numerous awards including the Newbery Medal. Ideas and inspiration for both books came to Speare while she was researching the history of New England and Connecticut, respectively. She earned her second Newbery Medal for her third book, The Bronze Bow, published in 1961. The Sign of the Beaver (1984) was a Newbery Honor winner and won the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction and the Christopher Award. Biographer Marilyn Fain Apseloff wrote, ‚Äú‚Ä¶she is not merely a writer of escapist literature, bringing only the past to her readers; in exploring universal problems and offering timeless values, she offers them hope for the present and the future as well.‚Äù[5] In 1989 the professional children's librarians awarded Speare the Wilder Medal, which recognizes a living author or illustrator whose books, published in the United States, have made \\"a substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children\\". At the time it was awarded every three years. Death Speare died of an aortic aneurysm on November 15, 1994, in Northwest General Hospital, in Tucson, Arizona.

The related and extant families, Anhimidae (screamers) and Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans), contain all the other taxa.Myers, P.; Espinosa, R.; Parr, C.S.; Jones, T.; Hammond, G.S. & Dewey, T.A.

A cladistic study of the morphology of waterfowl found that the magpie goose was an early and distinctive offshoot, diverging after screamers and before all other ducks, geese and swans. This family is quite old, a living fossil, having apparently diverged before the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event ‚Äì the relative Vegavis iaai lived some 68‚Äì67 million years ago. The fossil record is limited, nonetheless. The enigmatic genus Anatalavis (Hornerstown Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene of New Jersey, USA ‚Äì London Clay Early Eocene of Walton-on-the-Naze, England) is sometimes considered to be the earliest known anseranatid. Another Paleogene bird genus sometimes considered an anseranatid is Anserpica, from the Late Oligocene of Billy-Cr√©chy (France). The earliest known member of the group in Australia is Eoanseranas handae represented by fossils found in the late Oligocene Carl Creek Limestone of Queensland.

Ricketts (DDG-5), previously Biddle and DD-955, was a Charles F. Adams-class guided missile destroyer of the United States Navy. She was the third US Naval ship named after Nicholas Biddle, one of the first five captains of the Continental Navy. Originally to be designated as DD-955, the ship was laid down as DDG-5 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden, New Jersey on 18 May 1959, launched on 4 June 1960 and commissioned as USS Biddle on 5 May 1962, at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard CDR Paul Roth in command. Biddle was renamed to Claude V. Ricketts on 28 July 1964 in honor of Admiral Claude V. Ricketts, who had died on 6 July 1964.  As USS Biddle  Biddle during sea trials, 1962. Biddle operated in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea as part of the Second Fleet until the end of 1963. Biddle participated in naval activity near Cuba in weeks before the Cuban Missile Crisis. A Navy Expeditionary Medal was awarded for service from 19 August 1962 to 28 September 1962. Biddle made her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea at the close of 1963 returning to Norfolk in March 1964.  Mixed manning experiment and the decade that followed  From June 1964 to end of 1965 Claude V. Ricketts was part of a mixed-manning experiment for a proposed Multilateral Force (MLF). Its crew consisted of 10 officers and 164 crew from the US Navy with the remainder filled by sailors from West Germany, Italy, Greece, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Turkey. Though the MLF never was created, Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze stated that the project on Claude V. Ricketts was successful. The ship's crest includes the NATO insignia. A Navy Unit Commendation was awarded for the 18-month period. According to Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze, Admiral Claude V. Ricketts had made great contributions to the concept of mixed manning and a Multilateral Force. Because of this, he thought it appropriate to rename USS Biddle in Ricketts' honor while the ship was conducting a mixed-manning experiment on 28 July 1964. Her visit to Washington, D.C. in October 1964, was memorialized by painter, Gerard Richardson. After the manning experiment, Claude V. Ricketts made deployments to the Mediterranean Sea from 1966 to 1973. She also made a northern European cruise in July 1972. Claude V. Ricketts deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in August 1973 and returned to Norfolk in January 1974. Shortly after her return, the ship entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a ten-month overhaul returning to service in January 1975. She completed refresher training and ship trials in the Caribbean Sea from March to May 1975.  Belknap collision and the years that followed  Damage received while fighting fires on Belknap. In July 1975, Claude V. Ricketts deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. Claude V. Ricketts served as the rescue unit and tied up alongside USS Belknap (CG-26) after her collision with USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) on the night of 22 November 1975. Belknap was ablaze with exploding ammunition from the storage lockers for her two 3-inch guns, but the crew of the Claude V. Ricketts battled the conflagration for 7 hours and limited the damage, evacuating the injured while fragments from exploding ammunition showered down upon her decks. In the end, CG-26 was knocked and melted nearly to her main deck. Seven crew members aboard Belknap and one aboard John F. Kennedy were killed. A Navy Unit Commendation was awarded for service during the time period. Claude V. Ricketts returned to Norfolk in January 1976. Claude V. Ricketts and visit Kenya, 1976. On October 4, 1976, Claude V. Ricketts deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. There was also a trip to Kenya to commemorate the 13th anniversary of their independence. Just six weeks after returning to Norfolk, the ship deployed for a six-week operation with the Brazilian Navy. A Navy Expeditionary Medal was awarded for service from 1 October 1976 to 30 September 1977. From September 1977 to October 1978, Claude V. Ricketts was in the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for an overhaul. She returned to Norfolk in April 1979 after refresher training and trials.  Iran Hostage Crisis  Claude V. Ricketts deployed for seven months to the US Middle East Force and Sixth fleet at the start of September 1979. During the first part of the cruise, the ship made ports of call to Djibouti, Kenya, and Karachi, Pakistan On 4 November 1979, Claude V. Ricketts was making a port visit to Karachi, Pakistan when radical students invaded and occupied the US Embassy in Tehran, Iran and took the embassy staff hostage initiating the Iran hostage crisis. Claude V. Ricketts was immediately tasked to proceed to the Persian Gulf area of operations to join with and remained continuously at sea for more than 10 weeks over the Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years Holidays.Finally after 72 days of being at sea, ended with a two day visit in Sitra, Bahrain Claude V. Ricketts was back in the Mediterranean Sea in February 1980 and returned to Norfolk in April 1980.

His father, John Fitzalan, 3rd Baron Maltravers, fought a long battle to lay claim to the Arundel earldom, a battle that was not finally resolved until after the father's death, when John Fitzalan the son was finally confirmed in the title in 1433. Already before this, in 1430, Fitzalan had departed for France, where he held a series of important command positions. He served under John, Duke of Bedford, the uncle of the eight-year- old King Henry VI. Fitzalan was involved in recovering fortresses in the √éle- de-France region, and in suppressing local rebellions. His military career ended, however, at the Battle of Gerbevoy in 1435. Refusing to retreat in the face of superior forces, Arundel was shot in the foot and captured. His leg was later amputated, and he died shortly afterwards from the injury. His final resting place was a matter of dispute until the mid-nineteenth century, when his tomb at Arundel Castle was revealed to contain a skeleton missing one leg. Arundel was considered a great soldier by his contemporaries. He had been a successful commander in France, in a period of decline for the English, and his death was a great loss to his country. He was succeeded by his son Humphrey, who did not live to adulthood. The title of Earl of Arundel then went to John's younger brother William. Family background John Fitzalan was born at Lytchett Matravers in Dorset on 14 February 1408. He was the son of John Fitzalan, 3rd Baron Maltravers (1385-1421) and Eleanor (d. 1455), daughter of Sir John Berkeley of Beverstone, Gloucestershire.Curry (2004) John Fitzalan the elder, through his great-great-grandfather Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel, made a claim on the earldom of Arundel after the death of Thomas Fitzalan, 5th Earl of Arundel, in 1415. The claim was disputed, however, by Thomas's three sisters and their families, foremost among these Elizabeth FitzAlan, who had married Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk. It is debatable whether Maltravers ever held the title of Earl of Arundel; he was summoned to parliament under this title once, in 1416, but never again.Fryde (1961), p. 415. When he died in 1421, the dispute continued under his son, and it was not until in 1433 that the younger John FitzAlan finally had his title confirmed in parliament, despite the Mowbrays disputing his claim. Four years earlier, in July 1429, he had received his late father's estates and title. As a child, John Fitzalan was contracted to marry Constance, who was the daughter of John Cornwall, Baron Fanhope, and through her mother Elizabeth granddaughter of John of Gaunt. The two may or may not have married, but Constance was dead by 1429, when John married Maud, daughter of Robert Lovell. FitzAlan was knighted in 1426 along with the four-year-old King Henry VI, where he was referred to as \\"Dominus de Maultravers\\" (\\"Lord Maltravers\\"). In the summer of 1429 he was summoned to parliament, this time styled \\"Johanni Arundell' Chivaler\\", meaning he was now Lord Arundel. In 1430, however, in an indenture for service with the king in France, he was styled Earl of Arundel, a title he also used himself. When he was finally officially recognised in his title of Earl of Arundel in 1433, this was based on the recognition that the title went with the possession of Arundel Castle. In reality though, the grant was just as much a reward for the military services he had by that point rendered in France. Service in France Arundel Castle was the main residence of the FitzAlan family, but John FitzAlan spent most of the years from 1430 until his death in France. John Fitzalan the father had been a prominent soldier in the Hundred Years' War under King Henry V, and the son followed in his father's footsteps.Collins (2000), p. 128. On 23 April 1430, the younger Fitzalan departed for France in the company of the Earl of Huntingdon. There he soon made a name for himself as a soldier, under the command of the king's uncle, John, Duke of Bedford. In June he took part in the Siege of Compi√®gne, where Joan of Arc had recently been captured. Later, he raised the siege of Anglure with the help of the Burgundians. On 17 December 1431, he was present when Henry VI was crowned King of France in Paris, where he distinguished himself at the accompanying tournament. FitzAlan's military success led to several important appointments of command; in November 1431, he was made lieutenant of the Rouen garrison, and shortly after also captain of Vernon. In January 1432 he was appointed captain of Verneuil. On the night of 3 February he was taken by surprise while in bed at the Great Tower of Rouen Castle, when a band of French soldiers from nearby Ricarville managed to take the castle. Arundel was hoisted down the walls in a basket; and made his escape. The assailants could not hold the castle, because Marshall Boussac refused to garrison the town; Guillaume de Ricarville was forced to surrender twelve days later. In April 1432, FitzAlan was rewarded for his actions so far by initiation into the Order of the Garter. In a separate action from Rouen Arundel was sent to rescue Saint Lo. from an attack by the duke of Alen√ßon's army, after the town's captain Raoul Tesson had been appointed to replace Suffolk, who was captured at the Battle of Jargeau. The French retreated to the fastness of Mont St Michel, from where they continued to raid Anglo-Norman towns, like Granville in 1433. From early 1432 onwards, Fitzalan held several regional commands in northern France. One of his tasks was recovering fortresses in the √éle-de-France region, at which he was mostly successful. At Lagny-sur-Marne he blew up the bridge to prevent the citizens from reaching the castle, but still failed to take the fortification. In December he was appointed to a regional command in Upper Normandy, but had to defend the town of S√©es from a siege. On 10 March 1433, he issued a pardon to the inhabitants when the town was retaken from the Armangnacs. In July Arundel was instead made lieutenant-general of Lower Normandy. The earl continued his work of recovering lost fortresses that belonged to Ambroise de Lor√©, Bonsmoulins was taken easily, but Lor√©'s family had occupied Saint-C√©neri. After three months of culverin bombardment the walls were breached and most of the garrison killed. The remainder were allowed to march out unharmed. In the County of Alen√ßon, a young, tall and courageous earl led the campaign that probably took place in 1433,J H Ramsay, pp. 462‚Äì3; Barker, p. 201 taking back Saint-C√©lerin, Sill√©-le-Guillaume, where there was a short skirmish. The Armagnacs arrived, and demanded the return of the hostages in the castle; Arundel feigned to agree and departed. As soon as the Armangnacs rode off Arundel returned and took the castle by assault.J Chartier, Vallet de Viriville (ed.), Chronique de Charles VII, Roi de France, Pain 1858, pp. 165‚Äì8; Barker, p. 200 and by 1434 Beaumont-le-Vicomte. In December 1433, Bedford again appointed him commander in Upper Normandy, as well as captain of Pont-de-l'Arche. By now the Earl of Arundel might have returned briefly to England in May 1434, when he was in the process of gathering troops for an English expedition to France. But John, Duke of Bedford was forced to raise loans for the soldiers' pay in the Maine campaign.Beaurepaire, Les Etats (1859) That Spring he was joined in Paris by Talbot with nearly 1000 reinforcements from England. Later in May he was replaced as lieutenant of Upper Normandy by John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury, and instead received a command between the Seine and Loire rivers. This effectively meant that the two shared the command of Normandy, with Talbot east of the Seine and Arundel to the west.Pollard (1983), p. 19. But they combined operations capturing Beaumont-sur-Oise, and then Creil, which was finally taken on 20 June 1434.Barker, p.206 In the summer Arundel captured the Mantes-Chartres regional fortresses; it appeared for a time at least the Armagnacs no longer posed a threat to Paris. On 8 September, Arundel was also made Duke of Touraine - an area held by the French. The grant was made as a reward for his good service, but also in the hope that he would campaign in the area.Pollard (1983), p. 52n. In October he was made captain of Saint-L√¥, where he had to deal with a rebellion in the Bessin area. The Duke of Alen√ßon was trying to exploit the revolt to take control of Avranches, but Arundel managed to prevent the French advance and ended the rebellion. But in early 1435 the area of western Normandy erupted in popular revolt. Arundel wads summoned to call muster from Rouen in order to protect Caen. Arundel was joined by another lieutenant- general Lord Scales from his base at Domfront, commanded to relieve Avranches. Alen√ßon intended to build a fortress at Savigny, but when the English found out, the bailli of Cotentin was required to demolish it. With 800 men, Arundel was sent to recover Rue was he learnt that La Hire was fortifying Gerberoy, only 37 miles east of Rouen. Talbot had previously cleared out the Picardy, but when Arundel arrived he discovered to his surprise La Hire and Poton de Xantrailles had already occupied the fortress. He was forced to give battle or besiege.Barker, pp. 216‚Äì17 Death and aftermath John FitzAlan's free- standing cadaver tomb was opened in 1857, to reveal a skeleton missing one leg. On the night of 31 May/1 June 1435, Arundel was at Mantes-la-Jolie in the √éle-de-France, when he was ordered to relocate north to Gournay-sur-Epte (now Gournay-en-Bray). When he was informed that the French had taken over the nearby fortress at Gerberoy, he moved quickly to attack it. The English met with a large French force at Gerberoy. Many withdrew to Gournay in panic, but Arundel remained to fight. In the ensuing battle, Arundel lost many of his men and was himself hit in the foot by a shot from a culverin, a primitive musket.Aberth (2000), p. 237. Heavily wounded, he was taken to Beauvais as a captive of the French. According to the French historian Thomas Basin, Arundel was humiliated by his defeat and refused to receive medical treatment for the damage to his foot. The leg was eventually amputated, but Arundel's life could not be saved; he died of his injuries on 12 June 1435,Douet-D'Arcy, vol.5, pp. 79‚Äì86; Barker, pp. 217‚Äì8 depriving the English of one of their youngest, most able and dedicated military leaders.Barker, p.218 Arundel was replaced in his command by Lord Scales.Pollard (1983), p. 36. There was long uncertainty about what had happened to the earl's body. The French chronicler Jehan de Waurin claimed that Arundel had simply been buried in Beauvais. In the mid-nineteenth century, however, the chaplain of the Duke of Norfolk came upon the will of Arundel's squire, Fulk Eyton, when he died later in 1454. Eyton maintained therein that he had secured the earl's body and brought it back to England, for which he had been rewarded with a payment of 1400 Marks. The body was disinterred brought back to England, then entombed in the Fitzalan Chapel of Arundel Castle, as Arundel had expressly wished for in his own will. On 16 November 1857, the tomb in the Arundel chapel carrying the earl's effigy was opened. In it was found a skeleton measuring over six feet, with a missing leg.Tierney, Discovery of the Remains, pp. 237‚Äì9 Arundel's military career coincided with a period of general decline for the English in France.Curry (2003), p. 3. He had been an unusually successful campaigner. His death was lamented in England and celebrated in France. He was referred to as the \\"English Achilles\\"; the historian Polydore Vergil called him \\"a man of singular valour, constancy, and gravity.\\" With his wife, Maud, he had a son, Humphrey, who was born on 30 January 1429. Humphrey succeeded to his father's title, but died on 24 April 1438, while still a minor. John FitzAlan's younger brother, William, was next in line of succession. William was born in 1417 and was created Earl of Arundel in 1438 when he came of age.

It is largely a sub-region of the Midwest. Although the exact boundaries are not uniformly agreed-upon, the region is officially defined as referring to the states of Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Definitions The National Weather Service defines its Upper Midwest as the states of Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. The United States Geological Survey uses two different Upper Midwest regions: *The USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center considers it to be the six states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, which comprise the watersheds of the Upper Mississippi River and upper Great Lakes. *The USGS Mineral Resources Program considers the area to contain Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. The Association for Institutional Research in the Upper Midwest includes the states of Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and the upper peninsula of Michigan in the region. According to the Library of Congress, the Upper Midwest includes the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.LOC (2019).

Agriculture The USDA reported that corn, soybean, sunflower, and sugar beet crops saw harvest gains in 2018, but were still below the five-year averages. In North Dakota, for example, 49% of corn was harvested by November 4 compared with the five-year average of 97%. This was in part due to weather conditions in October that affected the harvest.Upper Midwest K√∂ppen climate classification (excluding Iowa) Climate The region has dramatic variations between summer and winter temperatures; summers are very hot; and winters are very cold. For example, Sioux Falls averages 25 days each year with temperatures above and 45 days each year with temperatures below . Mitchell, South Dakota has a record high of and a record low of . The growing season is shorter, cooler, and drier than areas farther south and east. The region's western boundary is sometimes considered to be determined by where the climate becomes too dry to support growing non-irrigated crops other than small grains or hay grass. Language The Inland North dialect, most prominently characterized by the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, is centered in the eastern part of the Upper Midwest, including Wisconsin, Michigan, and the northern parts of Illinois and Ohio; it extends beyond the Midwest into Upstate New York. North Central American English (also known as \\"Upper Midwestern\\"), a residual accent of American English, is spoken in Minnesota, parts of Wisconsin and Iowa, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, portions of Montana, and the Dakotas. Politics The Upper Midwest was the heartland of early 20th- century Progressive Party politics, and the region continues to be favorable to the Democratic Party and moderate Republicans, with Minnesota favoring each Democratic presidential candidate since 1972 and Wisconsin from 1988 to 2012. Minnesota narrowly supported native Walter Mondale in 1984 in an election where Ronald Reagan won every other state. Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin also often favor Democratic candidates. However, beginning with the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans experienced substantial gains in state legislative and executive offices in Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. This trend has continued through 2016. Currently there are three Democratic governors in the region (Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin) and three Republican governors (North Dakota, Iowa and South Dakota). Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign made significant in-roads in the Upper Midwest. Trump won the electoral votes of Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, and South Dakota, leaving Illinois and Minnesota the sole Blue States in the Upper Midwest in 2016. Hillary Clinton barely won Minnesota, finishing less than 2 percentage points ahead of Donald Trump. Industry and tourism The economy of the region was largely based upon the mining of iron and copper, as well as a very large timber industry. Mechanization has sharply reduced employment in those areas, and the economy is increasingly based on tourism. Popular interest in the environment and environmentalism, added to traditional interests in hunting and fishing, has attracted a large urban audience who live within driving range.

Forfeited and recovered many times it was finally sold by the daughters and co-heiresses of Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (d.1556), of the 1553 creation. It never was besieged during the Courtenay tenure, but was afterwards captured during the Civil War by a stroke of luck. It was then largely demolished as a preventative measure Powderham Castle, Devon, the ancient seat of the family of Courtenay of Powderham, which successfully claimed the dormant Earldom of Devon in the 19th century. Here seen from the south west, flying the heraldic standard of Courtenay The title of Earl of Devon was created several times in the English peerage, and was possessed first (after the Norman Conquest of 1066) by the de Redvers (alias de Reviers, Revieres, etc.) family, and later by the Courtenays. It is not to be confused with the title of Earl of Devonshire, held, together with the title Duke of Devonshire, by the Cavendish family of Chatsworth House, Derbyshire, although the letters patent for the creation of the latter peerages used the same Latin words, Comes Devon(iae).\\"Comes\\", Latin \\"companion\\"; the original Norman earl was different from an Anglo-Saxon ealdorman or Norse jarl, being a companion of the Duke of Normandy who was the war leader or dux and in 1066 led his army across the Channel. It was a re-invention, if not an actual continuation, of the pre- Conquest office of Ealdorman of Devon.Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.) Domesday Book, (Morris, John, gen.ed.) Vol. 9, Devon, Parts 1 & 2, Phillimore Press, Chichester, 1985, part 2 (notes), chapter 5. Thorn refers to Ordgar, Ealdorman of Devon as \\"Earl of Devon\\" Close kinsmen and powerful allies of the Plantagenet kings, especially Edward III, Richard II, Henry IV and Henry V, the Earls of Devon were treated with suspicion by the Tudors, perhaps unfairly, partly because William Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon (1475‚Äì1511), had married Princess Catherine of York, a younger daughter of King Edward IV, bringing the Earls of Devon very close to the line of succession to the English throne. During the Tudor period all but the last Earl were attainted, and there were several recreations and restorations. The last recreation was to the heirs male of the grantee, not (as would be usual) to the heirs male of his body. When he died unmarried, it was assumed the title was extinct, but a much later very distant Courtenay cousin, of the family seated at Powderham, whose common ancestor was Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon (d.1377), seven generations before this Earl, successfully claimed the title in 1831. During this period of dormancy the de jure Earls of Devon, the Courtenays of Powderham, were created baronets and later viscounts. During this time, an unrelated earldom of similar name, now called for distinction the Earldom of Devonshire, was created twice, once for Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, who had no legitimate children, and a second time for the Cavendish family, now Dukes of Devonshire. Unlike the Dukes of Devonshire, seated in Derbyshire, the Earls of Devon were strongly connected to the county of Devon. Their seat is Powderham Castle, near Starcross on the River Exe. The Earl of Devon has not inherited the ancient and original Barony of Courtenay or the Viscountcy of Courtenay of Powderham (1762‚Äì1835); nevertheless, his heir is styled Lord Courtenay by courtesy. Ealdormen of Devon Before the Norman Conquest of 1066 the highest sub-regal authority in Devon was the Ealdorman, of which office the later Earldom of Devon was a re-invention, if not an actual continuation.Thorn, Caroline & Frank, (eds.)

Thorn refers to Ordgar, Ealdorman of Devon as \\"Earl of Devon\\" The post- Norman earldom The first Earl of Devon was Baldwin de Redvers (c. 1095‚Äì1155) ,. son of Richard de Redvers (d.1107),. feudal baron of Plympton, Devon,Sanders, I.J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.137, Plympton one of the principal supporters of King Henry I (1100‚Äì1135). It was believed by some that Richard de Redvers had in fact been created the first Earl of Devon, and although in the past this caused confusion concerning the numerical ordering of the Earls of Devon, the point is now more clearly settled in favour of Baldwin as the first.For details see Richard de Redvers ‚Äì Was Richard the first Earl of Devon? Baldwin de Redvers was a great noble in Devon and the Isle of Wight, where his seat was Carisbrooke Castle, and was one of the first to rebel against King Stephen (1135‚Äì1154). He seized Exeter Castle, and mounted naval raids from Carisbrooke, but was driven out of England to Anjou, France, where he joined the Empress Matilda. She created him Earl of Devon after she established herself in England, probably in early 1141. Baldwin de Redvers, 1st Earl of Devon, was succeeded by his son, Richard de Redvers, 2nd Earl of Devon,. and grandson, Baldwin de Redvers, 3rd Earl of Devon,. and the latter was succeeded by his brother, Richard de Redvers, 4th Earl of Devon, who died childless.. William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon (d.1217). was the third son of Baldwin, the 1st Earl. He had only two children who left children. His son Baldwin died 1 September 1216 at the age of sixteen, leaving his wife Margaret pregnant with Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon. King John (1199‚Äì1216) forced her to marry Falkes de Breaut√©, but she was rescued at the fall of Bedford Castle in 1224 and divorced from him, as having been in no true marriage. She is thus called Countess of Devon in several records. The fifth Earl's youngest daughter, Mary de Redvers, known as 'de Vernon', was eventually sole heiress of the 1141 Earldom. She married firstly, Pierre de Preaux, and secondly, Robert de Courtenay (d.1242), feudal baron of Okehampton, Devon.Sanders, I.J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.70, Okehampton The 6th Earl. was succeeded by his son, Baldwin de Redvers, 7th Earl of Devon (d.1262),. who died without children. His sister, Isabella de Forz, widow of William de Forz, 4th Earl of Albemarle, became Countess of Devon suo jure.. Her children predeceased her and she had no grandchildren. Her lands were inherited by her second cousin once removed, Hugh de Courtenay (1276‚Äì1340), feudal baron of Okehampton, the great-grandson of Mary de Redvers and Robert de Courtenay (d.1242) of Okehampton. He descended from Renaud de Courtenay, anglicised to Reginald I de Courtenay, of Sutton, a French nobleman of the House of Courtenay who took up residence in England after the conquest and founded the English branch of the Courtenay family, who became Earls of Devon in 1335. The title is still held today, by his direct male descendant. Hugh de Courtenay was summoned by writ to Parliament in 1299 as Hugo de Curtenay,Hugo nominative Latin form, Hugoni dative, i.e. writ to Hugoni... whereby he is held to have become Baron Courtenay.; . However, forty-one years after the death of Isabel de Forz, letters patent were issued on 22 February 1335 declaring him Earl of Devon, and stating that he \\"should assume such title and style as his ancestors, Earls of Devon, had wont to do\\", by which he was confirmed as Earl of Devon.. Although some sources consider this a new grant the wording of the grant arguably indicates a confirmation and that he became thereby 9th Earl. Historic sources thus variously refer to him as either 1st Earl or 9th Earl, and the position cannot be decided either way due to the uncertainty of the surviving evidence. For the last years of his life he thus held two titles, 1st/9th Earl of Devon, by reason of the 1335 letters patent, and 1st Baron Courtenay, the title by which he had been summoned to Parliament in the years prior to the 1335 letters patent.. The 1st/9th Earl was succeeded by his son, Hugh de Courtenay, 2nd/10th Earl of Devon.. Three of the eight sons of the 2nd/10th Earl had descendants a fourth, William Courtenay, was Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor. Sir Hugh Courtenay (1326‚Äì1349), KG, eldest son and heir of the 2nd/10th Earl, was one of the founding members of the Order of the Garter, but both he and his only son, Sir Hugh Courtenay (died 1374), predeceased the 2nd/10th Earl.; . Sir Edward de Courtenay (died 1368/71), the third son, also predeceased his father, but left an eldest son, Edward de Courtenay, 3rd Earl of Devon (1357‚Äì1419), \\"The Blind\\", who inherited as the 3rd/11th Earl.; . The 3rd/11th Earl's eldest son, Sir Edward Courtenay (died 1418), married Eleanor Mortimer, daughter of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, but predeceased his father, leaving no children,; . and the 3rd/11th Earl's second son, Hugh de Courtenay, 4th Earl of Devon (d.1422) succeeded him as became 4th/12th Earl of Devon.. The 4th/12th Earl was succeeded by his son, Thomas Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon (d.1458).; . The Wars of the Roses were disastrous for the Courtenay earls. The 5th/13th Earl's son, Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon (d.1461), fought on the losing Lancastrian side at the Battle of Towton (1461), was captured and beheaded, and all his honours forfeited by attainder. Tiverton Castle and all the other vast Courtenay lands were forfeited to the crown, later to be partially restored. Second creation, 1469 Edward IV had made Humphrey Stafford, grandson and heir of Humphrey Stafford of Hooke, Dorset, his agent in the West Country.. On 17 May 1469, Stafford was created Earl of Devon, but was killed only three months later, having led royal forces against the rebel army of Robin of Redesdale, a deputy of the Earl of Warwick. Captured in the Battle of Edgecote, he was beheaded at Bridgwater on 17 August 1469. He left no children, and with his death the second creation of the earldom became extinct. He is known as the \\"Three Months' Earl\\". Restored first creation, 1470 The Wars of the Roses continued and in 1470 the Lancastrian forces under Warwick prevailed, and Henry VI was restored to the throne. The 1461 attainders were reversed, and the earldom of Devon was restored to John Courtenay, 7th/15th Earl of Devon (d.1471), youngest brother of Thomas, the 6th/14th Earl.. There had been a middle brother also, Henry Courtenay (d.1469), who also perished in the Wars. When the Yorkists again prevailed in the following year, Edward IV had the legislation of Henry VI's second reign cancelled, and all of John Courtenay's honours were forfeited. A few weeks later, on 4 May 1471, he died fighting on the losing side at the Battle of Tewkesbury (1471), leaving no children. According to Cokayne, \\"on his death the representation of the ancient Earls of Devon (of the family of Reviers from whom the Courtenays had inherited it) and of the Barony of Courtenay (created by the writ of 1299) fell into abeyance between his sisters or their descendants, subject to the attainder of Edward IV (1461), which revived on that King's re-accession 14 April 1471\\".. Third creation, 1485 Hugh I Courtenay (d.1425) of Boconnoc was the link between the senior line made extinct following the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471 and the post-War creation of a new Earldom in 1485 by King Henry VII Sir Edward Courtenay (d.1509), great-nephew of the 3rd/11th Earl, fought on the winning side at Bosworth on 22 August 1485, ending the Wars of the Roses and two months later the new King, Henry VII (1485‚Äì1509), by letters patent dated 16 October 1485, created Edward Courtenay Earl of Devon (or Devonshire), with the usual remainder to the heirs male of his body.. As the son and heir of Sir Hugh Courtenay (died 1471/2) of Bocconoc, Sir Edward Courtenay was the heir male of his family, his father being the son and heir of Sir Hugh Courtenay of Haccombe, younger brother of Edward de Courtenay, 3rd/11th Earl of Devon (d.1419), \\"The Blind\\". He united the Tiverton and Powderham lines of the family, having married Elizabeth Courtenay, a daughter of a younger son of the Powderham line. He died 28 May 1509, when the earldom was forfeited by the attainder in 1504 of his son and heir, William Courtenay (d.1511). Fourth creation, 1511 William Courtenay (d.1511) had married Princess Catherine of York, a younger daughter of King Edward IV, thereby exciting suspicions of disloyalty in Henry VII, who had him imprisoned and attainted for his supposed but unproven complicity in the conspiracy of Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk. However, during the reign of his son and successor King Henry VIII (1509‚Äì1547) William Courtenay was gradually forgiven. His lands were restored as far as was possible, and by letters patent of 10 May 1511 he was created Earl of Devon with remainder to the heirs of his body. He died suddenly of pleurisy a month later on 11 June 1511, leaving his only surviving son, Henry Courtenay (d.1539), to inherit the earldom.. In December 1512 Henry Courtenay (d.1539) obtained by Act of Parliament the reversal of the 1504 attainder of his father, William Courtenay. In 1512 he thus inherited the earldom of Devon as held by his grandfather, having at his father's death the previous year already inherited the earldom conferred by patent on his father in 1511.. In 1525 he was created Marquess of Exeter by Henry VIII. However, in 1538 he was tried, convicted, attainted and beheaded by the same king for conspiring with the Poles and Nevilles against the government of Thomas Cromwell in the aftermath of the Pilgrimage of Grace. All his titles were forfeited by his attainder.. Fifth creation, 1553 Edward Courtenay (d.1556), Henry Courtenay's second but only surviving son, was a prisoner in the Tower of London for fifteen years, from the time of his father's arrest to the beginning of the reign of Queen Mary (1553‚Äì1558), when he was released and created by her Earl of Devon. The patent differed from earlier patents in that it granted the earldom to his heirs male forever, rather than to the heirs male of his body. (This meant, as was decided in 1831, that the earldom could pass to his cousins, the Courtenays of Powderham, more specifically to William IV Courtenay (1527‚Äì1557), known retrospectively as the de jure 2nd Earl, which family had existed since the 14th century at that seat as prominent country gentry.) He was proposed as a prospective husband for his cousin Queen Mary, herself keen on the match, but is said to have refused her advances,Prince, Worthies of Devon after which Queen Mary married Philip II of Spain. He was considered as a possible husband for her sister, the future Queen Elizabeth I. This made him a threat to Mary's reign. Moreover, he was implicated in Wyatt's rebellion, and was again locked up in the Tower. In 1555 he was permitted to travel to Italy, where he died at Padua in 1556, possibly due to poisoning. With his death, his male line was extinguished, and the earldom with it, or so it was considered until 1831. Interregnum Since there was no Earl of Devon, James I granted the title in 1603 to Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy, whose aunt had been the last Earl's mother. He died without legitimate children three years later, and the King gave (or rather sold) the Earldom to William Cavendish, 1st Baron Cavendish. Meanwhile, the descendants of Sir Philip Courtenay (1340‚Äì1406), of Powderham, a younger son of the 2nd/10th Earl, having fought against the Courtenay Earls during the Wars of the Roses,See Battle of Clyst Heath lived under the Tudors as prominent country gentlemen. The baronetcy was created in the Baronetage of England during the English Civil War in February 1644 for William VI Courtenay (1628‚Äì1702) de jure 5th Earl of Devon, of Powderham, Devon. The third baronet gained the title Viscount Courtenay of Powderham in 1762. In 1831, the senior living Courtenay of this line was William Courtenay, 3rd Viscount Courtenay (died 1835), an aged rake and bachelor, then living in exile in Paris, having fled a bill of indictment. Were he to die unmarried, the viscountcy would become extinct, while the baronetcy would be inherited by his third cousin, another William Courtenay (1777‚Äì1859), who was Clerk Assistant to Parliament and High Steward of Oxford University. William Courtenay (d.1859) persuaded the House of Lords that \\"heir male\\" in the last 1553 creation of the title had meant \\"heir male collateral\\", and that his cousin the 3rd Viscount was therefore also 9th Earl of Devon, and his ancestors the Courtenays of Powderham had been de jure Earls of Devon from 1556. William Courtenay (died 1859) duly succeeded his cousin as 10th Earl in 1835, and from him the present Earls are descended. (A madman, John Nichols Thom, claimed to be \\"Sir William Courtenay\\" in 1832, and stood for Parliament twice, as representative of the extreme Philosophical Radicals, and proclaimed his right to the Earldom. He organized an agricultural rising outside Canterbury in 1838, and was shot dead in the Battle of Bossenden Wood during its suppression.) The inconvenience, since 1831, of having two Earls for the same county has been dealt with thus: The Cavendish Earls, who were elevated to a Dukedom in 1694, had been spelling their title Duke of Devonshire; the ancient Earls had usually been Earls of Devon. This is due in part to the differences between English and \\"law Latin\\", the language in which royal decrees were traditionally written. This has now become the difference between the two peerages, and it is convenient to call the Blount Earl (1603‚Äì06) Earl of Devonshire also. Residences The principal seat of the Earls of Devon until the expiry of the senior line in 1556 was Tiverton Castle in Devon, and as a subsidiary seat Colcombe Castle, Devon, both of which are now largely demolished. The Earls of Devon created after 1556, or in existence de jure, had occupied the manor of Powderham in Devon since the late 14th century, and Powderham Castle continues to be the principal seat of the present Earl of Devon.

Early life He was born in St. Louis, Missouri, where his mother, Charlotte Peters, was a local television personality with one of the earliest TV talk shows, interviewing film stars and politicians as early as 1949. Accompanying his mother to the studio, he would meet such celebrities as Bob Hope and Martin and Lewis. The show influenced Peters's own life: :My mom did more than a talk show. If you go to YouTube and put in Charlotte Peters, you can see an hour of her show. She sang, she danced, she entertained 250 audience members every day. It was a variety show, but also a talk show... My sister and I were like celebrities in town because of our mom. And during freshman year of high school, I would have girls who I didn‚Äôt even know call me and ask me to come with them to their junior or senior prom. If you‚Äôre a freshman or a sophomore, you never go to the prom, but these girls who were juniors and seniors would invite me to their prom. And of course, I would say yes. And I would go and rent a tuxedo, and I would go to their house and meet the mother and father of these girls. Then they would take me in their car, and while they were driving us to the prom, the mother would say, ‚ÄúMike, did you know that Gloria plays the violin?‚Äù And I would say, ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù and she would say, ‚ÄúYes, would you like to hear her play some time?‚Äù And I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù and she would pull a violin out from under the seat of the car and hand it to Gloria and Gloria would then proceed to play the violin for me all the way to the prom. And it happened again with a girl who played oboe. The mother pulled out the oboe and that girl, too, would play music for me all the way to the prom. And I was getting used to it. I would just sit there and enjoy the music... Not until I was 30-years-old did I realize that they were auditioning for my mom‚Äôs show. And I thought any girl, while being driven to the prom, would play music for you. And so when I invited the first girl to come to the prom with me, and she didn‚Äôt play a musical instrument, I thought I was being dissed. I thought, \\"What is this? Aren‚Äôt you supposed to be playing music for me?\\"DailyINK: \\"A Conversation with Mike Peters\\", June 4, 2012. Growing up in St. Louis, Peters attended Christian Brothers College High School and Washington University, where he studied fine art, became a Sigma Chi member and graduated in 1965. He drew cartoons for the college paper, Student Life, from 1962 to 1965. Peters recalled, \\"I knew when I was five years old that I wanted to be a cartoonist. As I grew older, I thought it was the only thing I could do.\\" He met his wife, Marian, while attending Washington University, and they moved to Chicago, where he worked for a year on the art staff of the Chicago Daily News. Drafted into the army, he spent two years of service as an artist for the Seventh Psychological Operations Group in Okinawa.Mile Zero: \\"Mike Peters Exhibit\\" Career=Editorial cartoons On his return from his army service, his mentor Bill Mauldin helped him get a job as editorial cartoonist for the Dayton Daily News in Dayton, Ohio.Lambiek As a joke, he once stood on the building ledge outside the Daily News building for 30 minutes wearing a Superman costume so that he could make an entrance to a meeting through the window in the manner of actor George Reeves entering Perry White's office on The Adventures of Superman. When his animated editorial cartoons Peters Postscripts began on NBC Nightly News in 1981, it was the first time animated editorial cartoons appeared regularly on a prime-time network news program. Peters also hosted the 14-part interview series The World of Cartooning with Mike Peters for PBS. In regard to politics, Peters's editorial stances are generally left of center. Comic strip In 1984, he launched Mother Goose and Grimm, distributed by King Features Syndicate. The strip is published in 500 newspapers, and according to King Features, it has a daily readership of 100 million. Peters' editorial cartoons and his comic strip are both distributed through King Features' DailyINK email service. Personal life Mike and Marian Peters have three daughters and six grandchildren.

It was created in 1701 for Robert Kerr, 4th Earl of Lothian. The Marquess of Lothian holds the subsidiary titles of Earl of Lothian (created 1606), Earl of Lothian (created again 1631), Earl of Ancram (1633), Earl of Ancram (created again 1701), Viscount of Briene (1701), Lord Newbattle (1591), Lord Jedburgh (1622), Lord Kerr of Newbattle (1631), Lord Kerr of Nisbet, Langnewtoun, and Dolphinstoun (1633), Lord Kerr of Newbattle, Oxnam, Jedburgh, Dolphinstoun and Nisbet (1701), and Baron Ker, of Kersheugh in the County of Roxburgh (1821), all but the last in the Peerage of Scotland. As The Lord Ker in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, previous Marquesses sat in the House of Lords before 1963, when Scottish peers first sat in the House of Lords in their own right. The holder of the title is also the Chief of Clan Kerr. The current Marquess of Lothian, the 13th, is better known as the Conservative politician Michael Ancram. He received a life peerage in November 2010 as Baron Kerr of Monteviot and so became entitled to sit in the House of Lords. He lives at Monteviot House. The family also owned a larger Scottish seat, Newbattle Abbey, which is now a college, and also Blickling Hall in Norfolk, which belongs to the National Trust. The heir presumptive to the marquessate is the 13th Marquess' younger brother Lord Ralph Kerr, who owns Ferniehirst Castle, Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, which is the family seat that was restored by the 12th Marquess, and Melbourne Hall in Derbyshire. History of the titles Clan Kerr has several branches. The name \\"Kerr,\\" from the Old Norse \\"kjrr\\" meaning \\"marsh-dweller,\\" arrived in Scotland from Normandy. In Scotland it was rendered Kerr, Ker, Carr and Carre, with a Scottish variant on the west coast taken from the Gaelic \\"ciar,\\" meaning dusky. According to the lore of the family of Mark Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian, the name comes from the Norman chiefs, Ralph and Robert, both brothers who came to Roxburgh from Lancashire in the 1300s. The Kerrs of Ferniehurst claim descent from Ralph, and the Kerrs of Cessford claimed they are descended from Robert. These two man branches of Clan Kerr were often at odds with one another, fighting until they came together in the early 1500s. The Kerrs subsequently also warred with the Scott Clan, until the feud ended when Sir Thomas Kerr of Ferniehurst married Janet Scott. In a 1591 charter, Mark Kerr had his lands at Newbattle and Prestongrange erected into the barony of Newbattle. 1st title Mark Kerr was created Lord Newbattle in 1591 and Earl of Lothian in 1606, both with remainder to his heirs male. The title went to the eldest of his four sons, Robert Kerr, 2nd Earl of Lothian. In 1621 both titles were surrendered by the 2nd Earl and regranted with a special remainder to his daughters, the eldest of whom, Lady Anne Kerr, succeeded to both titles on his death in 1624. Her husband, Sir William Kerr (eldest son of Sir Robert Kerr, later 1st Earl of Ancram) was created Lord Kerr of Newbattle and Earl of Lothian in 1631. On her death in 1667 their eldest son became 4th Earl of Lothian (though he was not recognised as such) and on her husband's death in 1675 also 2nd Earl of Lothian. 2nd title as Marquess By this point Sir Robert Kerr, father of the 1st Earl of the 2nd creation, had been created Lord Kerr of Nisbet, Langnewtoun and Dolphinstoun and Earl of Ancram, and the titles had been inherited by the 4th and 2nd Earl of Lothian's uncle, Charles Kerr, on whose death in 1690 he became 3rd Earl of Ancram. He was then created Lord Ker of Newbattle, Oxnam, Jedburgh, Dolphinstoun and Nisbet, Viscount of Briene, Earl of Ancram and Marquess of Lothian in 1701. The 2nd Marquess succeeded his cousin as Lord Jedburgh before succeeding to the Marquessate, and the 6th Marquess was created Baron Ker, of Kersheugh in the County of Roxburgh, in 1821, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

These stations are: * CICI - Greater Sudbury (flagship station) * CKNY - North Bay * CHBX - Sault Ste. Marie * CITO - Timmins Since 2005, all four stations refer to themselves on air as simply CTV instead of their call letters; however, they remain legally licensed as separate stations, and continue to have common local programming. Station information and history is discussed on each station's own page. History BBS logo, used from 1994-1997. Under the ownership of Baton Broadcasting, the MCTV branding still remained. The previous MCTV logo was dropped in 1994 when all of the other Baton-owned stations adopted a similar logo, the only difference being the call letters. Unlike other Baton-owned stations, the MCTV stations didn't use their call signs on their logos. The logo featured multicoloured rings around the word BBS.BBS logo on Canadian Trademarks Database Background Each of the four cities served by the CTV Northern Ontario system saw the launch of a locally owned television station in the 1950s: Sudbury's CKSO-TV was launched by the owners of the Sudbury Star in 1953, Sault Ste. Marie's CJIC-TV was launched by Hyland Broadcasting in 1955, North Bay's CKGN-TV was launched by Gerry Alger and Gerry Stanton in 1955, and Timmins's CFCL-TV was launched by J. Conrad Lavigne in 1956. All four stations were CBC Television affiliates at the time, as CTV did not exist until 1961. Each station continued to operate separately until 1970, when applications were filed with Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to launch a second television station in Sudbury;\\"CRTC proposes CBC-CTV partnership for alternative Northern Ontario service\\". The Globe and Mail, March 6, 1970. the application process ultimately resulted in a major realignment in Sudbury, North Bay and Timmins. Cambrian Broadcasting, the Sudbury station's owners at this time, acquired the North Bay station and launched a repeater of CKSO in Timmins, serving as the new CTV affiliate in all three cities, while Lavigne launched new stations CKNC-TV in Sudbury and CHNB-TV in North Bay, and retained the CBC affiliation.\\"Rebroadcast programs: CRTC grants Sudbury licences\\". The Globe and Mail, August 6, 1970. Although Hyland Broadcasting was one of the original applicants for a new Sudbury station, CJIC remained unaffected by the final outcome at the time. Through the 1970s, however, the North Bay and Timmins markets proved too small to support competition between multiple stations; although the Sudbury stations were nominally profitable on their own, the losses in North Bay and Timmins left both companies nearly bankrupt by 1980.\\"CRTC approves amalgamation of Northern Ontario TV firms\\". The Globe and Mail, February 29, 1980. MCTV As a result of the stations' precarious financial situation, the CRTC permitted Northern Cable, the region's primary cable television provider, to purchase both companies.\\"Northern Cable seeks control of TV systems\\". The Globe and Mail, September 20, 1979. Northern Cable formed Mid-Canada Communications as a holding company for the six stations, operating them under a twinstick model. The CRTC explicitly stated that it intended this to be only a temporary arrangement, to end as soon as the CBC could afford to directly acquire MCTV's CBC affiliates. At this time, CKSO-TV adopted the new callsign CICI, and its repeater in Timmins became a new standalone station, CITO-TV. All six stations were referred to on air as Mid-Canada Television, or MCTV for short; the station pairs were distinguished from each other by use of their network affiliation (i.e., \\"MCTV-CTV\\" and \\"MCTV-CBC\\"). As well, MCTV owned CHRO in Pembroke, a market with no other television stations. CHRO used the same logo and programming schedule as MCTV's other stations, but it always used its own callsign, rather than MCTV, as its on-air identification. Due to CTV's status at the time as a cooperative of its affiliated stations, MCTV itself held a 2.1 per cent share in the network.\\"CTV enriches owners by making no profit\\". The Globe and Mail, November 14, 1986. Hyland/Huron Broadcasting Through the 1970s and 1980s, the Sault Ste. Marie stations remained a separate operation and were not part of Mid-Canada Communications. In 1976, Hyland Broadcasting merged with another local company to form Huron Broadcasting, and in 1978 the company launched CKCY-TV as the city's CTV affiliate under the same twinstick model. Huron Broadcasting did, however, sell most of its radio stations in Sault Ste. Marie and other Northern Ontario communities to Mid-Canada Communications in 1988. Baton Broadcasting MCTV logo under CTV ownership from late 1990s to 2005. Baton Broadcasting acquired both Mid-Canada and Huron in 1990, and the Huron stations were converted to the MCTV branding at this time.\\"CRTC okays acquisitions, but at a price\\". Financial Post, October 23, 1990. As well, Baton reaffiliated CHRO with CTV. Baton eventually became the sole corporate proprietor of CTV, making the MCTV stations fully owned and operated stations of the network, and sold CHRO to CHUM Limited in 1998; at the time CHUM acquired CHRO, it disaffiliated from CTV and became an independent station for a short time before joining the NewNet system (now CTV 2). Baton retained the CBC twinsticks until 2002, when it sold them to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\\"CBC takes over MCTV transmitter\\". Sudbury Star, July 12, 2002. Politicians in the area, most notably Sault Ste. Marie MP Carmen Provenzano, expressed the hope that the sale would result in the CBC launching new local newscasts,\\"CBC to buy CTV assets in Sault, North\\". Sault Star, July 12, 2002. but when the deal was finalized in early 2003, the CBC simply converted them to full retransmitters of CBLT, Toronto's CBC owned-and-operated station,\\"CBC should handle local news, councillor says\\". Sudbury Star, January 6, 2004. with all four stations surrendering their old call letters. Later in 2003, MCTV's master control operations were transferred to the CTV facilities in Toronto. News operations In November 2001, CTV merged the news production facilities of the MCTV stations into a single regional newscast, with only short inserts for each city's local coverage.\\"CRTC will not halt MCTV cuts\\". Sault Star, November 8, 2001. The regional newscast is produced at CICI. This created extensive controversy, with many public interest groups across Canada raising concerns about the disappearance of local news coverage in small markets.\\"Local news a right, advocacy group says: Opponents point to profits; MCTV says revenue down\\". Sault Star, November 15, 2001. Some groups lobbied for the CBC to produce new local newscasts in the cities on MCTV's CBC stations in cooperation with CTV, but this model was not pursued.\\"CBC still waiting to hear MCTV proposal\\". North Bay Nugget, December 19, 2001. Organizations in Sault Ste.

Sault Star, February 12, 2005. before being acquired by Village Media.\\"SooToday will now be home to all the great programming from LOCAL2\\". Soo Today, April 8, 2016. In late 2003 and early 2004, following some resident complaints that MCTV's coverage of the city's municipal election had been inadequate, Sault Ste. Marie City Council debated a motion requesting that the CRTC direct MCTV to sell a station in the city to a local buyer who would relaunch a fully local newscast, although the motion was criticized in part because it rested on the mistaken belief that MCTV still had ownership and control of the CBC stations. In October 2005, MCTV News was renamed as CTV News, in line all other CTV owned-and-operated stations. CTV News uses WSI's TrueView Max Weather Technology to broadcast weather reports during its newscasts.

He is remembered primarily for his role in three milestones of the old American West: the founding of the University of Washington, the Mercer Girls, and the Johnson County War. Mercer Island in Lake Washington and Mercer Street in Seattle are named not for Asa, but rather his brother Thomas. Seattle Public Schools operates Asa Mercer International Middle School in Seattle's Beacon Hill neighborhood. The University of Washington In 1861, as a member of one of the founding families of Seattle, Washington, a young Asa Mercer assisted his brothers in clearing stumps to make way for the new territorial university. Besides helping with the foundations of the university, Mercer, being the only college graduate in town, was hired by Daniel Bagley as the university's sole instructor and president. However, Mercer did not receive a salary. The Mercer Girls The young town of Seattle was attracting hordes of men to work in the timber and fishing industries, but few marriageable women were willing to make the trip to the remote Northwest corner of the United States. In March 1864, with public support and private funding, Mercer traveled to the Eastern United States in search of single women to work in Seattle as teachers and in other respectable occupations. This and a subsequent trip introduced dozens of women to the Pacific Northwest, most of whom eventually married local men. Mercer himself married one. The descendants of the Mercer Girls still represent a significant portion of Seattle's citizenry. The Mercer Girls story formed the basis of the television show Here Come the Brides. The Johnson County War Mercer became well known throughout the West as a publisher and eventually found his way to Cheyenne, Wyoming, where he published the Northwestern Livestock Journal, a public relations vehicle for the moneyed cattle interests. As Mercer came to see the clearly underhanded treatment of individual ranchers by the cartels, he began to write more scathing accounts of the events that were unfolding on the open range. His account is told in his book The Banditti of the Plains (1894), which was suppressed in its day and is still difficult to find in public libraries in some parts of the Western U.S. Following the events of the Johnson County War, which included destruction of his newspaper office by arson, Mercer settled into the quiet life of a successful rancher in Hyattville, Wyoming, where he died in 1917.

In the National Parks System Plan, this park provides representation of the Strait of Georgia Lowlands natural region, the only place in Canada with a Mediterranean climate of dry, sunny summers and mild, wet winters, the result of a rain shadow effect from surrounding mountains between the region and the ocean. It has similar dominant vegetation as the Pacific Northwest, such as coastal Douglas-fir, western red cedar, shore pine, Pacific dogwood, bigleaf maple, and red alder, but also contains the northern extent of some of the more drought tolerant trees such as Garry oak and Arbutus. The park was created in 2003 as the fortieth national park. It covers of area on 16 islands and more than 30 islets, reefs and surrounding waters, making it the sixth smallest national park in Canada. History A high proportion of land on the Gulf Islands, over 75%, has been converted to private properties. As settlement and development was impacting character, ecosystems and recreational values, several means of conservation had been initiated. While the province was promoting tourism to the Gulf Islands and establishing provincial parks, such as, among others, D'Arcy Island Marine Park and Princess Margaret Marine Park on D'Arcy Island and Portland Island, respectively, they also established the Islands Trust whose mandate for the gulf islands is \\"to preserve and protect the trust area and its unique amenities and environment\\". On the federal level, the local member of parliament David Anderson advocated for an organized conservation effort and Minister of Fisheries Jack Davis commissioned, in 1971, a feasibility study of establishing a marine park. A year before, Parks Canada had released its National Parks System Plan which identified 39 natural regions which should be represented in the park system. The unrepresented Strait of Georgia Lowlands natural region, the smallest and most urbanized natural region in the country, includes the Fraser Lowland and the valleys and islands along the Strait of Georgia, like the Gulf Islands. In 1973 Parks Canada and the US Parks Service jointly published a feasibility study of creating a transboundary protected area here, along with the San Juan Islands and Point Roberts. However, with the provincial government satisfied with the provincial park system in the Gulf Islands and reluctant to forgo resource extraction and development rights, progress towards establishing a national park was delayed until the 1995 announcement of the Canada-British Columbia Pacific Marine Heritage Legacy program. Both the federal and provincial governments pledged $30 million each to acquiring land for conservation purposes generally in the Strait of Georgia area but with the intent of establishing a national park. On July 26, 2002, 7.8 hectares of ecologically sensitive land on Saturna Island was donated to the Gulf Island National Park Reserve by Ulla Ressner and John Fry Parks Canada Pares Canada \\"JUL 26, 2002 Dear Ms. Ressner and Mr. Fry: On behalf of Parks Canada, I would like to express our great appreciation for your recent donation of7.8 hectares ofland to Gulf lslands National Park Reserve through the Ecological Gifts Program. We are faced with many challenges in piecing together and managing a national park in the Gulf Islands. As we acquire additional lands, our task is eased somewhat: with more lands protected, our ability to achieve a sustainable and healthy ecosystem as a whole is enhanced. It is through such forward-thinking individuals as yourself-those whose vision of a legacy for future generations inspires them to donate land for protection within a national park-that we can move closer towards our goal. You have set a wonderful example for other Gulf Islanders, and to Canadians. Yours is the first donation of privately held land to the Government of Canada under the Ecological Gifts program-a significant milestone for that program, and something of which you can justifiably be proud. Ron Hamilton Superintendent Gulf Islands National Park Reserve The park was formally announced on May 9, 2003, with the signing of a memorandum of understanding to take the steps necessary to transfer the agreed upon of lands to the federal government for use as national park. The province followed through in April 2004 with Orders- in-Council 402-404 releasing the properties and all their rights to the Parks Canada 402-2004 Order in Council 403-2004 404-2004 including nine provincial parks (Beaumont Marine Park, Cabbage Island Marine Park, D'Arcy Island Marine Park, Isle-de-Lis Marine Park, Princess Margaret Marine Park, Sidney Spit Marine Park, Winter Cove Marine Park, Prior Centennial Park and McDonald Park), as well as the Saturna Island Ecological Reserve and the Brackman Island Ecological Reserve. The former-provincial parks would include almost all of the new National Park's recreational facilities (e.g. camping sites, anchorages, etc.). In addition, more land on Saturna and Pender Islands were added, as well as Reay Island, Greig Island, Hawkins Island, Imrie Island, the Belle Chain Islets, the Channel Islets, and the Red Islets, among other islets. Climate The park, along with the Strait of Georgia Lowlands natural region, is situated in a low-lying coastal area surrounded by mountains. While the area experiences the warm air from the Pacific Ocean jet stream, the surrounding mountains of Vancouver Island and the Olympic Mountains strips that air of moisture creating a rain shadow effect. The summers are consequently dry with only a few cloudy days which is classified as a Mediterranean climate. The winters, however, are influenced by Arctic air mixing with Pacific air flows resulting in heavy precipitation and cool temperatures. The park includes a climate monitoring station, in operation since 1989, on Saturna Island; the area experiences an average of of precipitation each year, with over half of that falling in the four-month period between October and February. Ecology Arbutus (on the left) The terrestrial portion of the park lies within what the province terms the Coastal Douglas-Fir Biogeoclimatic Zone based on the climax vegetation. Coastal Douglas-fir is the most common tree species and is accompanied by western red cedar and grand fir in wetter soils and Arbutus and Garry oak in drier soils. Also present are red alder, shore pine, Pacific dogwood, bigleaf maple, and bitter cherry. In the shrub layer are salal, dull Oregon-grape, oceanspray, baldhip rose, bracken fern, sword fern, lady fern and spiny wood fern. In wetter areas salmonberry, false lily of the valley, vanilla-leaf, and skunk cabbage may be present. In the sea waters swim orcas, porpoises, seals, salmon, lingcod, shiner perch, saddleback gunnel and three-spined stickleback, among others. The largest land animal in the park would be the black-tailed deer. Fallow deer are also present but are an introduced species from some of the island's history as private hunting grounds. Other terrestrial animals include mink, river otters, raccoons and deer mice. Birds that be seen in the park include cormorant, bald eagle, red-tailed hawk, falcon, turkey vulture, rhinoceros auklet, Brant geese, great blue heron, Hermann's Gulls, and oystercatcher. Geography The park consists of of land and of water scattered over and around 16 islands and more than 30 islets and reefs at the southern end of the Gulf Islands archipelago in the Strait of Georgia, Haro Strait and Boundary Pass on the Canadian side of the international border with the United States. The islands have a northwesterly-southeasterly alignment which is partly the result of sedimentary folding within the Nanaimo Basin. Also partly responsible for the shape of the land is the effects of the last ice age when 1.5 km of ice was top off the land and the erosive force carved out softer deposits as the melting water drained into the Pacific Ocean via the Strait of Georgia. Also, the land continues to experience post-glacial rebound which has lifted certain lands higher. McDonald Campground The park's most accessible feature is the McDonald Campground in North Saanich on Vancouver Island, just north of the Town of Sidney. While it covers a area consisting of second-growth forest, the site is divided by the Highway 17 and the Swarz Bay Road overpass and surrounded by urban and agricultural development. The campground had been operated as a provincial park since 1948 before being transferred to Parks Canada in 2004. The campground includes 49 drive-in, frontcountry campsites with potable water, pit toilets, and picnic tables. Sidney Island Dinghy dock (or pier) at the Sidney Island campground, with Hook Spit and Vancouver Island in the background The Sidney Island portion of the national park comprises the northern of the island along with another of foreshore area. Its most prominent features are two spits which create long, sandy beaches. Sidney Spit extends for more than to light beacon at its point. Hook Spit is situated partly down the island and creates a sheltered lagoon with beds of eelgrass. Located off the coast of Town of Sidney, in the Haro Strait, it is accessible only by private boat, passenger ferry or small plane via an airstrip further down the island. Like McDonald Campground, recreational park facilities, like a campground, dock, and moorings were developed during the years when it was operated as a provincial park. Historically, this area had been used by First Nation people for clam harvesting, before being subjected to a failed residential subdivision by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1860, clay extraction for a brickworks between 1906 and 1915, logging of old growth trees, and the introduction of non-native animals like deer and peacocks from farming operations and its use as a private hunting ground before the province used the area in the late-1950s to test the concept of a marine park. Being well-received, the province formalized it as a provincial park in 1961 and developed mooring buoys and an anchoring area, with an on-shore dock for passenger ferries, a campground, pit toilets, and water taps. D'Arcy Island The southernmost area in the park, along with the Unit Rocks and the Sallas Rocks, is D'Arcy Island in the Haro Strait. It is an island, with a 25-meter buffer of national park waters surrounding it, primarily accessible by sea kayak from Island View Regional Park in Central Saanich, or otherwise by motorboat though there are no docking or mooring facilities. Like Sidney Island, it was developed as a marine park with backcountry campsites, with pit toilets but no potable water, and cross- island hiking trails by the province beginning in 1961 before being transferred to Parks Canada in 2004. Some ruins of old buildings, along with a memorial plaque, remain from its time as a leper colony, between 1891 and 1924. Isle-de-Lis East of Sidney Island, and east of the privately owned Gooch Island, is the Isle-de-Lis, formerly known as Rum Island as it was used by rum-runners during prohibition in the United States, being less than one mile from the international border. Isle-de-Lis was a private island until 1978 when it was bequeathed to the province for park purposes and renamed to Isle-de-Lis. Like D'Arcy Island, the province made it into a marine park primarily accessible by sea kayakers on a multi-day trip, with no docking or mooring facilities for motorboats, and added backcountry campsites with pit toilets but no potable water. Portland Island Portland Island with the Salt Spring Island at the background On the northern end of the Haro Strait is a area of the national park centered on Portland Island and extending out to include Brackman Island and numerous islets (but excluding several private islands). Brackman Island was an ecological reserve prior to its inclusion into the national park as a Special Preservation Area. Archaeological sites in the form of midden deposits remain on Portland Island from a long-abandoned First Nation village. Similarly, evidence remains of its use as a private island, including agricultural development and logging, though it reverted to the provincial government after the owner's bankruptcy in the Great Depression. The island was given to Princess Margaret to commemorate her 1958 visit to British Columbia and she donated it back to the province for park purposes. The province subsequently operated it as the Princess Margaret Marine Park with anchorages, an artificial reef suitable for scuba diving, hiking trails around the island and three campgrounds with pit toilets but no potable water, until it was transferred to Parks Canada. Russell Island Located in the Satellite Channel off the southern coast of Salt Spring Island, Russell Island includes an anchorage area and a small dock with a loop trail for recreational use. As a cultural heritage sites, there is a foreshore clam garden developed by First Nations people and the Mahoi House developed when Russell Island was a private island owned by a Native Hawaiian family between 1886 and 1959 (and also inhabited by subsequent owner). It remained a private island until 1997 when it was purchased in the Pacific Marine Heritage Legacy program for park purposes. Pender Island Pender Island is serviced by BC Ferries which allows for the use of drive-in campsites at the Prior Centennial Campground. A second campground is located along Bedwell Harbour in the former Beaumont Marine Provincial Park. In addition to the backcountry campsites, there are also mooring buoys and an anchoring area for boaters and a sandy beach access for kayakers, as well as a hiking trail along the beach and up Mount Norman. The Roesland park area on North Pender, acquired through a series of private land purchases, has a third campground. This campground is located near the shore of Shingle Bay and is accessible by kayakers or boaters as there is an anchoring area and a sandy beach access with a dinghy dock, but is also accessible via a short but steep hike from the Shingle Bay Road parking lot. This Roesland park area also includes a loop-trail around Roe Lake and a shorter hike from a historical/interpretative centre to Roe Islet (accessible during low tide). There are two other national park areas on the island. On South Pender, there is a hiking trail from Gowlland Point Road to Greenburn Lake. On North Pender, from a trailhead in an Islands Trust conservation area, there is a hiking trail up Mount Menzies through Loretta's Wood and another trail through Tyndall Wood to cliffs which overlook Plumper Sound and Saturna Island. Saturna Island Fog Alarm Building at East Point along the sandstone shoreline of Saturna Island The national park covers approximately 43% of Saturna Island's land base. The 7.8 hectare Ressner-Fry July 26, 2002 Dear Ms. Ressner and Mr. Fry: On behalf of Parks Canada, I would like to express our great appreciation for your recent donation of 7.8 hectares ofland to Gulflslands National Park Reserve through the Ecological Gifts Program.

Yours is the first donation of privately held land to the Government of Canada under the Ecological Gifts program-a significant milestone for that program, and something of which you can justifiably be proud. Ron Hamilton Superintendent Gulf Islands National Park Reserve property on Mount Fisher, though it is not accessible. The Winter Cove day use area is the most visited park area on Saturna Island. It surrounds a cove with a sheltered moorage area and a dinghy dock. On land the day use area includes a picnic area and a trail through a variety of landscapes such as forested uplands, open meadows, salt marshes, shell midden, and sandstone beaches, to a viewpoint at Boat Pass. The Narvaez Bay park area includes several connected hiking trails, along the coastline and through the forest to the Monarch Head viewpoint which overlooks Boundary Pass and the American San Juan Islands. The Narvaez Bay campground is only campground within the island's park boundaries and is accessible by kayak, or from an off-shore anchoring area or by walking in from a parking lot. At the end of the northern peninsula is a small park area with a sandstone beach that surrounds the East Point Light Station and Fog Alarm Building with the Boiling Reef just off-shore. The middle of the island is a large park area that covers land from the valley bottom of Lyall Creek to the plateau of Mt. David and Mt. Elsford to the north and to the plateau of Mount Warburton Pike and Brown Ridge to the south. The Lyall Creek trail follows a salmon-bearing creek to a waterfall, while the Mount Warburton Pike trail (at the end of Staples Road) follows the grassy ridgeline at a height of 400 metres overlooking the Taylor Point trail along the southern coast of the island and Plumper Sound, Pender Island and the San Juan Islands. Similarly, the height of Mount Fischer west of Mount Warburton Pike is also included within the park, though it is not accessible. The Taylor Point trail is a trail along coastal bluffs, from the end of Trueworthy Road, past an abandoned sandstone quarry to Taylor Point where there remains the ruins of a settler's house, constructed of sandstone in 1892. Tumbo Island - Cabbage Island Tumbo and Cabbage Islands off the coast of Saturna Island (foreground) Located off Saturna Island's northeastern shore, Tumbo Island and Cabbage Island are connected to each other by a reef, exposed at low tide. Cabbage Island, purchased by the Nature Conservancy from private owners in 1976, was developed as a provincial marine park between 1978 and 2004 with anchorage and moorage areas in Reef Harbour and a campground and on the island. Tumbo, in area and named in reference to a tombolo, was acquired by the province in the Pacific Marine Heritage Legacy program from a Californian for $3.7 million with the provision that he was able to keep his cottage and care-taker suite. Prior to its use as private property (since 1877) for timber harvesting, coal mining, mink farming, and recreational living, it was used by the Coast Salish people when crossing or working in the strait. Tumbo is also only accessible by boats via Reef Harbour and it beach accesses but while it does not have a campground does have a 3.5 km trail, with views of the San Juan Islands. Mayne Island Active Pass Lighthouse on Mayne Island There are two national park sites on Mayne Island: Campbell Point (Bennett Bay) on the eastern end and Georgina Point on the island's northwestern end. The Georgina Point Heritage Park is a site that looks upon the Strait of Georgia and the entrance of Active Pass. It has been the site of the Active Pass Lighthouse since 1885, though that original light was replaced in 1940 with a lightkeeper's residence that included a lantern room above, and then in 1969 by an octagonal metal lantern mounted on a cylindrical concrete tower. The light function was also replaced, in 1997, by an automated navigational aid. As the historical structures remain, as well as the active radio building and aeronautical beacon maintained by the Coast Guard, it is listed as a historic place and heritage lighthouse. With the site transferred from Fisheries and Oceans Canada to Parks Canada it was further developed with picnic and washroom facilities. On the other end of the island, the Campbell Point portion was acquired as a private land purchase. There is a hiking trail from a sandy beach, suitable for swimming and launching kayaks, to Campbell Point where there are views of Georgeson Island's old-growth forest on a sandstone ridge. Georgeson Island, along with the seal and sea lion haulouts of the Belle Chain Islets and Anniversary Island, and the small unnamed islands off Samuel Island's coast, make for a kayak route between Mayne and Saturna islands, within the national park boundaries. Prevost Island There are two park areas on Prevost Island. The north park site, acquired by private land purchases, extends from Peile Point around James Bay to Selby Cove, though the land on Selby Point remains privately owned. There is a campground, with a pit toilet but no potable water, on the shores of James Bay with a hiking trail to and Selby Cove. While the camping is suitable for kayakers, there are anchorage areas in James Bay and Selby Cove for boaters. On the east end of the island, the park site extends from Portlock Point around Richardson Bay to the Bright and Red Islets. This site includes the Portlock Point Lighthouse and a beach access but no campground.

She originated the role of Martha in the 1962 Broadway premiere of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? by Edward Albee, who called her \\"a profoundly truthful actress\\". Because Hagen was on the Hollywood blacklist, in part because of her association with Paul Robeson, her film opportunities dwindled and she focused her career on New York theatre. She later became a highly influential acting teacher at New York's Herbert Berghof Studio and authored best-selling acting texts, Respect for Acting, with Haskel Frankel, and A Challenge for the Actor. Her most substantial contributions to theatre pedagogy were a series of \\"object exercises\\" that built on the work of Konstantin Stanislavski and Yevgeny Vakhtangov. She was elected to the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1981. She twice won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play and received a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1999. Life and career=Early life Born in G√∂ttingen, Germany, daughter of Thyra A. (n√©e Leisner), a trained opera singer, and Oskar Hagen, an art historian and musician, Hagen and her family emigrated to the United States in 1924. Though shipping records indicate that he took a position at Cornell University,Port of New York, passenger list of the S.S. Luetzow, 4 September 1924, sheet 41. his new position was in fact at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Uta was raised in Madison, Wisconsin. She appeared in productions of the University of Wisconsin High School and in summer stock productions of the Wisconsin Players. She studied acting briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1936.Port of New York, passenger list of the S.S. Westernland, 24 December 1936, sheet 165. After spending one semester at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where her father was the head of the department of art history, she left for New York City in 1937. Her first professional role was as Ophelia opposite Eva Le Gallienne in the title role of Hamlet in Dennis, Massachusetts, in 1936. Career Hagen was cast, early on, as Ophelia by the actress-manager Eva Le Gallienne. From there, Hagen went on to play the leading ingenue role of Nina in a Broadway production of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull which featured Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. It was 1938; Hagen was just 18. This experience left an indelible mark on the young actress, as she later reflected, \\"My next job was Nina in The Seagull, [her Broadway bow] with the Lunts, on Broadway. That sounds incredible, too. They were an enormous influence on my life.\\" She admired \\"their passion for the theatre, and their discipline. It was a 24-hour-a-day affair, and I never forgot it‚Äînever!\\" The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson hailed her Nina as \\"grace and aspiration incarnate\\". She played George Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan (1951) on Broadway, and Desdemona in a production which toured and played Broadway, featuring Paul Robeson as Shakespeare's Othello and her then-husband Jose Ferrer as Iago. She took over the role of Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire for the national tour, which was directed not by Elia Kazan who had directed the Broadway production but by Harold Clurman. Hagen had had a revelatory experience when she first worked with Clurman in 1947. In Respect for Acting, she credited her discoveries with Clurman as the springboard for what she would later explore with her husband Herbert Berghof: \\"how to find a true technique of acting, how to make a character flow through me\\". She played Blanche (on the road and on Broadway) opposite at least four different Stanley Kowalskis, including Anthony Quinn and Marlon Brando. Through interviews with her and contemporary criticism, the report is that Hagen's Blanche refocused the audience's sympathies with Blanche rather than with Stanley (where the Brando/Kazan production had leaned). Primarily noted for stage roles, Hagen won her first Tony Award in 1951 for her performance as the self-sacrificing wife Georgie in Clifford Odets' The Country Girl. She won again in 1963 for originating the role of the \\"I-wear-the-pants-in-this-family-because-somebody's-got-to\\" Martha in Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. (An original cast recording was made of this show.) In 1981 she was elected to the American Theatre Hall of Fame and in 1999 received a \\"Special Lifetime Achievement Tony Award\\". Hagen considered the period between 1938 and 1947 as \\"the transitional years of my career, during which I lost my way and a love of acting until I finally regained it to begin a true life in the theater.\\" Although she appeared in some movies, because of the Hollywood blacklist she had more limited output in film and on television, not making her cinematic debut until 1972. She would later comment about being blacklisted, \\"that fact kept me pure.\\" She was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award as \\"Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series\\" for her performance on the television soap opera One Life to Live. She taught at HB Studio, a well-known New York City acting school on a cobblestone, tree-shaded street in the West Village. She began there in 1947, and married its co-founder, Herbert Berghof, on 25 January 1957. Later in her life, Hagen undertook a return to the stage, earning accolades for leading roles in Mrs. Warren's Profession (1985), Collected Stories, and Mrs. Klein. After Berghof's death in 1990, she became the school's chairperson. Hagen was an influential acting teacher who taught, among others, Matthew Broderick, Christine Lahti, Amanda Peet, Jason Robards, Sigourney Weaver, Katie Finneran, Liza Minnelli, Whoopi Goldberg, Jack Lemmon, Charles Nelson Reilly, Manu Tupou, Debbie Allen, Herschel Savage, George Segal, Jon Stewart, and Al Pacino. She was a voice coach to Judy Garland, teaching a German accent, for the picture Judgment at Nuremberg. Garland's performance earned her an Academy Award nomination. She also wrote Respect for Acting (1973) and A Challenge for the Actor (1991), which advocate realistic acting (as opposed to pre- determined \\"formalistic\\" acting). In her mode of realism, the actor puts his own psyche to use in finding identification with the role,\\" trusting that a form will result.Hagen, Uta 1991. A Challenge for the Actor. New York: Scribner's. In Respect for Acting, Hagen credited director Harold Clurman with a turn-around in her perspective on acting: > In 1947, I worked in a play under the direction of Harold Clurman. He opened > a new world in the professional theatre for me. He took away my 'tricks'. He > imposed no line readings, no gestures, no positions on the actors. At first > I floundered badly because for many years I had become accustomed to using > specific outer directions as the material from which to construct the mask > for my character, the mask behind which I would hide throughout the > performance. Mr Clurman refused to accept a mask. He demanded ME in the > role. My love of acting was slowly reawakened as I began to deal with a > strange new technique of evolving in the character. I was not allowed to > begin with, or concern myself at any time with, a preconceived form. I was > assured that a form would result from the work we were doing. Hagen later \\"disassociated\\" herself from her first book, Respect for Acting. In Challenge for the Actor, she redefined a term which she had initially called \\"substitution\\", an esoteric technique for alchemizing elements of an actor's life with his/her character work, calling it \\"transference\\" instead. Though Hagen wrote that the actor should identify the character he plays with feelings and circumstances from his own life, she also makes clear that: > Thoughts and feelings are suspended in a vacuum unless they instigate and > feed the selected actions, and it is the characters' actions which reveal > the character in the play. Respect for Acting is used as a textbook for many college acting classes. She also wrote a 1976 cookbook, Love for Cooking. In 2002, she was awarded the National Medal of the Arts by President George W. Bush at a ceremony held at the White House. In 2001, Hagen agreed to be filmed giving master classes in NYC, LA, Toronto and Chicago by Karen Ludwig and Pennie du Pont, who released the video entitled Uta Hagen's Acting Class, a two-part set that captures her master classes. The video has been thoroughly studied and is now taught in many acting classes. Harvey Korman talks about studying under her during his Archive of American Television interview in 2004. David Hyde Pierce worked with Hagen in the Richard Alfieri play Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks, at the Geffen Playhouse in 2001. Hyde Pierce spoke at her 2004 memorial at Manhattan's Majestic Theater.

Personal life Uta Hagen was married to Jos√© Ferrer from 1938 until 1948. They had one child together, their daughter Leticia (born 15 October 1940). They divorced partly because of Hagen's long-concealed affair with Paul Robeson, her co-star in Othello. Hagen married Herbert Berghof on 25 January 1957, a union that lasted until his death in 1990. Hagen died in Greenwich Village in 2004 after suffering a stroke in 2001.

Tokyo Tech is the largest institution for higher education in Japan dedicated to science and technology, and is generally considered to be one of the most prestigious universities in Japan. Tokyo Tech's main campus is located at ≈åokayama on the boundary of Meguro and Ota, with its main entrance facing the ≈åokayama Station. Other campuses are located in Suzukakedai and Tamachi. Tokyo Tech is organised into 6 schools, within which there are over 40 departments and research centres.the number of undergraduates and departments of Tokyo Tech facts and stats Tokyo Tech enrolled 4,734 undergraduates and 1,464 graduate students for 2015‚Äì2016.Data Book 2015-2016, by the TIT It employs around 1,100 faculty members. Tokyo Institute of Technology produced a Nobel Prize laureate in Chemistry Hideki Shirakawa Ph.D. History=Foundation and early years (1881‚Äì1922) Tokyo Institute of Technology was founded by the government of Japan as the Tokyo Vocational School on May 26, 1881,\\"The history of the Tokyo Institute of Technology\\" http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/about/overview/history.html 14 years after the Meiji Restoration. To accomplish the quick catch-up to the West, the government expected this school to cultivate new modernized craftsmen and engineers. In 1890, it was renamed Tokyo Technical School. In 1901, it changed name to Tokyo Higher Technical School. Great Kant≈ç earthquake and World War II (1923‚Äì1945) In early days, the school was located in Kuramae, the eastern area of the Greater Tokyo Area, where many craftsmens' workshops had been since the old Sh≈çgun's era. The buildings in Kuramae campus were destroyed by the Great Kant≈ç earthquake in 1923. In the following year, the Tokyo Higher Technical School moved from Kuramae to the present site in Ookayama, a south suburb of the Greater Tokyo Area. In 1929 the school became Tokyo Institute of Technology, gaining a status of national university, which allowed the university to award degrees. The university had the Research Laboratory of Building Materials in 1934, and its five years later the Research Laboratory of Resources Utilisation and the Research Laboratory of Precision Machinery were constructed. The Research Laboratory of Ceramic Industry was made in 1943, and one year before the World War Two finished the Research Laboratory of Fuel Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics were made. Post-War Era (1946‚Äìpresent) After World War II, the new education system was promulgated in 1949 with the National School Establishment Law, and Tokyo Institute of Technology was reorganized. Many three-year courses were turned into four-year courses with the start of the School of Engineering this year. The university started graduate programmes in engineering in 1953. In the following year, the five research laboratories were integrated and reorganised into four new labs: the Research Laboratory of Building Materials, the Research Laboratory of Resources Utilization, the Precision and Intelligence Laboratory and the Research Laboratory of Ceramic Industry, and the School of Engineering was renamed the School of Science and Engineering. Throughout the post-war reconstruction of the 1950s, the high economic growth era of the 1960s, and the aggressive economic era marching to the Bubble Economy of the 1980s, TIT kept providing Japan its leading engineers, researchers, and business persons. Since April 2004, it has been semi-privatized into the National University Incorporation of Tokyo Institute of Technology under a new law which applied to all national universities. Operating the world-class supercomputer Tsubame 2.0,Japan reclaims no.1 spot on TOP500 list of world's fastest supercomputers International Business Times and making a breakthrough in high-temperature superconductivity, Tokyo Tech is a major centre for supercomputing technology and condensed matter research in the world.

It is the home of Japan's largest science and technology library. The library was founded in 1882, About us, Tokyo Institute of Technology Library and it lost nearly 28,000 books during the Great Kant≈ç earthquake in 1923. Moved to Ookayama in 1936, it has been the national science and technology library of Japan. 1,200 students and staff visit the library each day. It has 674,000 books and 2,500 journals, including 1,600 foreign academic journals; the number of international research collections is the largest in Japan. It provides around 7,000 registered electronic journals each year. The library is therefore recognised for the outstanding national and international importance and awarded 'Centre of foreign journals' by the government of Japan. Renewal construction of the library was completed on July 2011. International graduate programmes Tokyo Tech runs intensive programmes for obtaining master degree or PhD. Called the Tokyo Tech's International Graduate Program, the programmes are targeted at international students of high academic potential who are not Japanese speakers. Lectures and seminars are given in English mainly by Tokyo Tech's faculty members. Programme starting dates are October or April. Public fundings for these courses are also available; those students who have academic excellence may apply for scholarships from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan. Rankings Tokyo Tech is one of the most prestigious universities in Japan. It can be seen in the several rankings such as shown below.

The war, which began primarily over the control of Northeastern India, ended in a decisive British victory, giving the British total control of Assam, Manipur, Cachar and Jaintia as well as Arakan Province and Tenasserim. The Burmese submitted to a British demand to pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling, and sign a commercial treaty. This war was the longest and most expensive war in British Indian history. Fifteen thousand European and Indian soldiers died, together with an unknown number of Burmese military and civilian casualties. The high cost of the campaign to the British, 5‚Äì13 million pounds sterling (¬£ ‚Äì ¬£ as of ), contributed to a severe economic crisis in British India which cost the East India Company its remaining privileges. Though once strong enough to threaten the interests of British India (especially with respect to the eastern border regions of Assam, Manipur, and Arakan), the Burmese Empire now suffered \\"the beginning of the end\\" of its independence. They would be crushed for years to come by repaying the heavy indemnity of one million pounds (then US$5 million), a large sum at that time. The British, eventually waging two more wars against a much-weakened Burma, would swallow up the entire country by 1885. Causes Michael Symes to King Bodawpaya at Amarapura in 1795 Bajidaw, King of Burma orders his generals to wrest Bengal from British, 1823 By 1822, Burmese expansion into Manipur and Assam had created a long border between British India and the Burmese Empire. The British, based in Calcutta, supported rebels from Manipur, Assam and Arakan fleeing into British territory. Calcutta unilaterally declared Cachar and Jaintia British protectorates and sent in troops.Thant Myint-U, The Making of Modern Burma, pp. 18‚Äì19 Cross border raids into these newly acquired territories from British territories and spheres of influence vexed the Burmese. Convinced that war was inevitable, Burmese commander-in-chief, Maha Bandula, became the main proponent of offensive policy against the British. Bandula was part of the war party at Bagyidaw's court, which also included Queen Me Nu and her brother, the Lord of Salin. Bandula believed that a decisive victory could allow Ava to consolidate its gains in its new western empire in Arakan, Manipur, Assam, Cachar, and Jaintia, as well as take over eastern Bengal. In September 1823, the casus belli was Burma occupying Shalpuri Island near Chittagong, which was claimed by the East India Company.The Somerset Light Infantry: A History In January 1824, Burma sent one of their top generals, Thado Thiri Maha Uzana, into Cachar and Jaintia to disperse the rebels. The British sent in their own force to meet the Burmese in Cachar, resulting in the first clashes between the two. The war formally broke out on 5 March 1824, following border clashes in Arakan. The British reason for the war was, in addition to expanding British Bengal's sphere of influence, the desire for new markets for British manufacturing. The British were also anxious to deny the French the use of Burmese harbours and concerned about French influence at the Court of Ava, as the kingdom was still known to them. British Ambassador Michael Symes's mission was equipped to gain as much knowledge as possible of the country for future British plans whereas previous envoys were concerned principally with trade concessions. Anglo-French rivalry had already played a role during Alaungpaya's endeavours of unifying the kingdom. The Burmese in these wars were advancing into smaller states not ruled by the British or the subject of expansionary goals by the British before the war began, and the British were not so much preoccupied by the refugee problem initially as by the threat posed by the French until further incidents forced their hand. War British Army passing through forests Western theatre The commander in chief of the Burmese army, Maha Bandula, was supported by twelve of the country's best divisions, including one under his personal command, all totaling 10,000 men and 500 horses. His general staff included some of the country's most decorated soldiers, men like the Lord of Salay and the governors of Danyawaddy, Wuntho, and Taungoo. Bandula's plan was to attack the British on two fronts: Chittagong from Arakan in the southeast, and Sylhet from Cachar and Jaintia in the north. Bandula personally commanded the Arakan theatre while Uzana commanded Cachar and Jaintia theater. Early in the war, battle- hardened Burmese forces were able to push back the British forces because the Burmese, who had been fighting in the jungles of Manipur and Assam for nearly a decade, were more familiar with the terrain which represented \\"a formidable obstacle to the march of a European force\\". Uzana had already defeated the British units in Cachar and Jaintia in January 1824. In May, Burmese forces led by U Sa, Lord Myawaddy (about 4,000) fought their way into Bengal, defeating British troops at the Battle of Ramu, east of Cox's Bazar, on 17 May 1824. Sa's column then joined Bandula's column on the march to defeat British forces at Gadawpalin, and went on to capture Cox's Bazar. The Burmese success caused extreme panic in Chittagong and in Calcutta. Across the eastern Bengal, the European inhabitants formed themselves into militia forces. And a large portion of the crews of the East India Company's ships was landed to assist in the defense of Calcutta. But Bandula, not wanting to overstretch, stopped U Sa from proceeding to Chittagong. Had Bandula marched on to Chittagong, which unbeknown to him was lightly held, he could have taken it and the way to Calcutta would have been open. Had they been able to threaten Calcutta, the Burmese could have obtained more favourable terms in the peace negotiations later on. Inside Burma British naval force entered the harbour of Yangon (Rangoon) in May 1824 The Storming of the Lesser Stockade at Kemmendine near Yangon (Rangoon) on 10 June 1824 The Attack of the Stockades at Pagoda Point, on the Rangoon River, 8 July 1824 =Battle of Yangon (May‚ÄìDecember 1824)= Instead of fighting in hard terrain, the British took the fight to the Burmese mainland. On 11 May 1824, a British naval force of over 10,000 men (5,000 British soldiers and over 5,000 Indian sepoys) entered the harbour of Yangon (Rangoon), taking the Burmese by surprise.Htin Aung, pp. 212‚Äì214Phayre, pp. 236‚Äì237 The Burmese, pursuing a scorched earth policy, left an empty city behind and chose to fortify positions along an east‚Äìwest arc outside the city. The British forces led by General Archibald Campbell took position inside the Shwedagon Pagoda compound, which was fortified. The British launched attacks on Burmese lines, and by July 1824, had successfully pushed the Burmese towards Kamayut, from Shwedagon. Burmese efforts to retake Shwedagon in September failed.Myint-U, River of Lost Footsteps, pp. 114-117 King Bagyidaw ordered a near-complete withdrawal from the western front‚ÄîBandula from Arakan and Bengal, and Uzana from Assam, Cachar, and Jaintia‚Äîand meet the enemy in Yangon. In August, in the midst of monsoon season, Bandula and his army crossed the Arakan Yoma.Perrett, pp. 176‚Äì177 Moving tens of thousands of men over the 3,000-foot-high Arakan hills, or 10,000-foot-high Assamese ranges, heavily forested with only narrow footpaths and open to attack by tigers and leopards, would be difficult even in mild weather conditions. To do this at the height of the drenching monsoon season was a particularly difficult task. Yet Bandula (from Arakan) and Uzana (from Assam) in a testament to their generalship and logistical skills, managed to do just that. The King granted both Bandula and Uzana the title Agga Maha Thenapati (), the highest possible military rank. Bandula was also made the governor of Sittaung. By November, Bandula commanded a force of 30,000 massed outside Yangon. Bandula believed that he could take on a well-armed British force of 10,000 head-on. Although the Burmese were numerically superior, only 15,000 of the 30,000 had muskets. The Burmese cannons fired only balls whereas the British cannons fired exploding shells. Unbeknown to him, the British had just received the first shipment of the newest weapon in the war that the Burmese had never seen‚ÄîCongreve rockets. More ominous for the Burmese, the speedy march through the hilly regions of Rakhine Yoma and Assamese ranges had left their troops exhausted. On 30 November, in what turned out be the biggest mistake of his career, Bandula ordered a frontal attack on British positions. The British, with far superior weaponry, withstood several Burmese charges at the Shwedagon fort, cutting down men by the thousands. By 7 December, the British troops, supported by rocket fire, had begun to gain the upper hand. On 15 December, the Burmese were driven out of their last remaining stronghold at Kokine.Myint-U, River of Lost Footsteps, pp. 118-122 In the end, only 7,000 of the 30,000 Burmese soldiers returned. =Battle of Danubyu (March‚ÄìApril 1825)= Bandula's lookout tree at Danybyu, mounted with four guns Bandula fell back to his rear base at Danubyu, a small town not far from Yangon, in the Irrawaddy delta. Having lost experienced men in Yangon, the Burmese forces now numbered about 10,000, of mixed quality, including some of the king's best soldiers but also many untrained and barely armed conscripts. The stockade itself stretched along the riverbank, and was made up of solid teak beams no less than high. In March 1825, a four thousand strong British force supported by a flotilla of gunboats attacked Danubyu. The first British attack failed, and Bandula attempted a counter-charge, with foot soldiers, cavalry and 17 fighting elephants. But the elephants were stopped by rocket fire and the cavalry found it impossible to move against the sustained British artillery fire. On 1 April, the British launched a major attack, pounding down on the town with their heavy guns and raining their rockets on every part of the Burmese line. Bandula was killed by a mortar shell. Bandula had walked around the fort to boost the morale of his men, in his full insignia under a glittering golden umbrella, discarding the warnings of his generals that he would prove an easy target for the enemy's guns. After Bandula's death, the Burmese evacuated Danubyu. =Arakan campaign (February‚ÄìApril 1825)= U Sa was left to command the remaining Burmese troops in Arakan after Bandula and the main battalions were ordered to withdraw from Arakan by Bagyidaw to meet the British invasion in Yangon in August 1824. Sa held on to Arakan throughout 1824 while the main focal point of the war played out in Yangon. After Gen. Archibald Campbell finally defeated Gen. Bandula in the Battle of Yangon in December 1824, the British turned their sights to Arakan. On 1 February 1825, an invasion force of 11,000 soldiers supported by gunboats and armed cruisers along the coast, and a squadron of cavalry under the command of Gen. Morrison, attacked Burmese positions in Arakan. Despite their superior numbers and firearms, the British had to fight depleted Burmese forces for nearly two months before they reached the main Burmese garrison at Mrauk-U, Arakan's capital. On 29 March 1825, the British launched their attack on Mrauk-U. (At the same time, Campbell also launched an attack on Bandula's positions in the Battle of Danubyu.) After a few days of fighting, the Burmese at Mrauk-U was defeated on 1 April, coincidentally the same day Maha Bandula fell at Danubyu. Sa and the remaining Burmese forces evacuated and left Arakan. The British proceeded to occupy the rest of Arakan. =Armistice= On 17 September 1825, an armistice was concluded for one month. In the course of the summer, General Joseph Wanton Morrison had conquered the province of Arakan; in the north, the Burmese were expelled from Assam; and the British had made some progress in Cachar, though their advance was finally impeded by the thick forests and jungle. Peace negotiations that began in September broke down by early October after the Burmese would not agree to British terms. The British had demanded no less than the complete dismemberment of the Burmese western territories in Arakan, Assam, Manipur, and the Tenasserim coast as well as two million pounds sterling of indemnity. The Burmese would not agree to give up Arakan and the large sum of indemnity. =Battle of Prome (November‚ÄìDecember 1825)= In November 1825, the Burmese decided to throw everything they had into a last-ditch effort. Starting in mid-November, the Burmese forces, consisting mainly of Shan regiments led by their sawbwas, threatened Prome in a daring circular movement that almost surrounded the town and cut off communications lines to Yangon. In the end, the superior firepower of the British guns and missiles won out. On 1 December, Gen. Campbell, with 2500 European and 1500 Indian sepoys, supported by a flotilla of gunboats, attacked the main Burmese position outside Prome. On 2 December, Maha Ne Myo was killed by a shell launched from the flotilla. After Maha Ne Myo's death, the British dislodged the Burmese by 5 December. The defeat in Prome effectively left the Burmese army in disarray. The Burmese army was in constant retreat from then on. On 26 December, they sent a flag of truce to the British camp. Negotiations having commenced, the Burmese capitulated to the British terms to end the war, signing the Treaty of Yandabo in February 1826. Treaty of Yandabo The British demanded and the Burmese agreed to: : Cede to the British Assam, Manipur, Rakhine (Arakan), and Taninthayi (Tenasserim) coast south of the Salween River : Cease all interference in Cachar and Jaintia : Pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling in four installments : Allow for an exchange of diplomatic representatives between Ava and Calcutta : Sign a commercial treaty in due course The first installment of indemnity was to be paid immediately, the second installment within the first 100 days from signing of the treaty, and the rest within two years. Until the second installment was paid, the British would not leave Yangon. The Treaty of Yandabo was signed by General Campbell from the British side and Governor of Legaing Maha Min Hla Kyaw Htin from the Burmese side on 24 February 1826. The Burmese paid 250,000 pounds sterling in gold and silver bullion as the first installment of the indemnity, and also released British prisoners of war. The war was thus brought to an end, and the British army moved south. The British army remained in the territories surrendered to it under the treaty and in the territories such as the Rangoon area which were occupied for several years in the guarantee of the financial terms of the treaty. Aftermath St. George's Cathedral, Madras While both two nations suffered heavy military and financial loss, the treaty imposed an even severe financial burden to the Burmese Kingdom and effectively left it crippled. The British terms in the negotiations were strongly influenced by the heavy cost in lives and money which the war had entailed. Some 40,000 British and Indians troops had been involved of whom 15,000 died. British casualties were blamed on poor planning and logistics as only a quarter of the casualties were from the fighting while almost 70% were from tropical diseases. In the Arakan Campaign alone, 659 Europeans out of 1,500 and some 3,500 Indians out of a total of 8,000 died in hospital. The cost to British India's finances had been almost ruinous, amounting to approximately 13 million pounds sterling. The cost of war contributed to a severe economic crisis in India, which by 1833 had bankrupted the Bengal agency houses and cost the British East India Company its remaining privileges, including the monopoly of trade to China. For the Burmese, the treaty was a total humiliation and a long-lasting financial burden. A whole generation of men had been wiped out in battle. The world the Burmese knew, of conquest and martial pride, built on the back of the impressive military success of the previous 75 years, had come crashing down. The Court of Ava could not come to terms with the loss of the territories and made unsuccessful attempts to get them back. An uninvited British resident in Ava was a daily reminder of the humiliating defeat. In addition, the burden of indemnity left the Burmese royal treasury bankrupt for years. The indemnity of one million pounds sterling was considered a large sum in Europe at that time. It appeared more daunting when converted to the Burmese kyat equivalent of 10 million. The cost of living of the average villager in Upper Burma in 1826 was one kyat per month. The British would wage two less expensive wars against the weaker Burmese in 1852 and 1885, and annex Burma by 1885.

It is a generalization of the idea of using the sum of squares of residuals in ordinary least squares to cases where model-fitting is achieved by maximum likelihood. It plays an important role in exponential dispersion models and generalized linear models. Definition The unit deviance d(y,\\\\mu) is a bivariate function that satisfies the following conditions: * d(y,y) = 0 * d(y,\\\\mu) >0 \\\\quad\\\\forall y eq \\\\mu The total deviance D(\\\\mathbf{y},\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}) of a model with predictions \\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}} of the observation \\\\mathbf{y} is the sum of its unit deviances: D(\\\\mathbf{y},\\\\hat{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}}) = \\\\sum_i d(y_i,\\\\hat{\\\\mu}_i). The (total) deviance for a model M0 with estimates \\\\hat{\\\\mu}=E[Y\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_0], based on a dataset y, may be constructed by its likelihood as:McCullagh and Nelder (1989): page 17 :D(y,\\\\hat{\\\\mu}) = 2 \\\\Big(\\\\log \\\\big(p(y\\\\mid\\\\hat \\\\theta_s)\\\\big)-\\\\log \\\\big( p(y\\\\mid\\\\hat \\\\theta_0)\\\\big)\\\\Big).\\\\, Here \\\\hat \\\\theta_0 denotes the fitted values of the parameters in the model M0, while \\\\hat \\\\theta_s denotes the fitted parameters for the saturated model: both sets of fitted values are implicitly functions of the observations y. Here, the saturated model is a model with a parameter for every observation so that the data are fitted exactly. This expression is simply 2 times the log-likelihood ratio of the full model compared to the reduced model. The deviance is used to compare two models - in particular in the case of generalized linear models (GLM) where it has a similar role to residual variance from ANOVA in linear models (RSS). Suppose in the framework of the GLM, we have two nested models, M1 and M2. In particular, suppose that M1 contains the parameters in M2, and k additional parameters. Then, under the null hypothesis that M2 is the true model, the difference between the deviances for the two models follows, based on Wilks' theorem, an approximate chi-squared distribution with k-degrees of freedom. This can be used for hypothesis testing on the deviance. Some usage of the term \\"deviance\\" can be confusing. According to Collett:Collett (2003): page 76 : \\"the quantity -2 \\\\log \\\\big( p(y\\\\mid\\\\hat \\\\theta_0)\\\\big) is sometimes referred to as a deviance. This is [...] inappropriate, since unlike the deviance used in the context of generalized linear modelling, -2 \\\\log \\\\big( p(y\\\\mid\\\\hat \\\\theta_0)\\\\big) does not measure deviation from a model that is a perfect fit to the data.\\" However, since the principal use is in the form of the difference of the deviances of two models, this confusion in definition is unimportant. Examples The unit deviance for the Poisson distribution is d(y,\\\\mu) = 2\\\\left(y\\\\log\\\\frac{y}{\\\\mu}-y+\\\\mu\\\\right), the unit deviance for the Normal distribution is given by d(y,\\\\mu) = \\\\left(y-\\\\mu\\\\right)^2.

It has the largest circulation of any newspaper in the state of Washington and in the Pacific Northwest region. The newspaper was founded in 1891 and has been controlled by the Blethen family since 1896. The Seattle Times Company also owns local newspapers in Walla Walla and Yakima. It had a longstanding rivalry with the Post-Intelligencer until the latter ceased publication in 2009. History The Seattle Times originated as the Seattle Press-Times, a four-page newspaper founded in 1891 with a daily circulation of 3,500, which Maine teacher and attorney Alden J. Blethen bought in 1896. Renamed the Seattle Daily Times, it doubled its circulation within half a year. By 1915, circulation stood at 70,000. The newspaper moved to the Times Square Building at 5th Avenue and Olive Way in 1915. It built a new headquarters, the Seattle Times Building, north of Denny Way in 1930. The paper moved to its current headquarters at 1000 Denny Way in 2011. The Seattle Times switched from afternoon delivery to mornings on March 6, 2000, citing that the move would help them avoid the fate of other defunct afternoon newspapers.American Journalism Review: 40 Years Of Death In The Afternoon This placed the Times in direct competition with its Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) partner, the morning Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Nine years later, the Post-Intelligencer became an online-only publication. The Times is one of the few remaining major city dailies in the United States independently operated and owned by a local family (the Blethens). The Seattle Times Company, while owning and operating the Times, also owns three other papers in Washington, and formerly owned several newspapers in Maine that were sold to MaineToday Media. The McClatchy Company owns 49.5 percent of voting common stock in the Seattle Times Company, formerly held by Knight Ridder until 2006. Awards The Times reporting has received 11 Pulitzer Prizes, most recently for its breaking news coverage of the Boeing 737 MAX groundings. It has an international reputation for its investigative journalism, in particular. In April 2012, investigative reporters Michael Berens and Ken Armstrong won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for a series documenting more than 2,000 deaths caused by the state of Washington's use of methadone as a recommended painkiller in state-supported care. In April 2010, the Times staff won the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for its coverage, in print and online, of the shooting deaths of four police officers in a Lakewood coffee house and the 40-hour manhunt for the suspect. A tenth Pulitzer Prize was awarded in 2015 for breaking news coverage of the Oso mudslide. In 1982 reporter Paul Henderson won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting for his coverage of the case of Steve Titus. Titus had been wrongfully convicted of rape, and in a series of articles Henderson challenged the circumstantial evidence in the case, convincing the judge to reverse Titus' conviction.Paul Henderson, Pulitzer Prize-winning Seattle Times reporter who championed the underdog, dies at 79  The Seattle Times Controversies=Racial headline controversy In February 2002, The Seattle Times ran a subheadline \\"American outshines Kwan, Slutskaya in skating surprise\\" after Sarah Hughes won the gold medal at the 2002 Olympics. Many Asian Americans felt insulted by the Times' actions, because Michelle Kwan is also American. Asian American community leaders criticized the subheadline as perpetuating a stereotype that people of color can never be truly American. The incident echoed a similar incident that happened with an MSNBC article during the Winter games in 1998, which was reported on by Times. The newspaper's Executive Editor at the time of the controversy, Mike Fancher, issued an apology in the aftermath of the controversial headline. Election controversy On October 17, 2012, the publishers of The Seattle Times launched advertising campaigns in support of Republican gubernatorial candidate Rob McKenna and a state referendum to legalize same-sex marriage. The newspaper's management said the ads were aimed at \\"demonstrating how effective advertising with The Times can be.\\" The advertisements in favor of McKenna represent an $80,000 independent expenditure, making the newspaper the third largest contributor to his campaign. More than 100 staffers signed a letter of protest sent to Seattle Times Publisher Frank Blethen, calling it an \\"unprecedented act\\". The Joint Operating Agreement \\"Quarters of the news editor\\", one in a group of four photos in the brochure Seattle and the Orient (1900), collectively captioned \\"The Seattle Daily Times‚ÄîEditorial Department\\" From 1983 to 2009, the Times and Seattle's other major paper, the Hearst-owned Seattle Post-Intelligencer, were run under a \\"Joint Operating Agreement\\" (JOA) whereby advertising, production, marketing, and circulation were controlled by the Times for both papers. The two papers maintained their own identities with separate news and editorial departments. The Times announced its intention to cancel the JOA in 2003, citing a clause in the JOA contract that three consecutive years of losses allowed it to pull out of the agreement. Hearst sued, arguing that a force majeure clause prevented the Times from claiming losses as reason to end the JOA when they result from extraordinary events (in this case, a seven-week strike by members of the Newspaper Guild). While a district judge ruled in Hearst's favor, the Times won on appeal, including a unanimous decision from the Washington State Supreme Court on June 30, 2005.\\"The Seattle Post- Intelligencer, Court sides with Seattle Times in JOA dispute\\" Hearst continued to argue that the Times fabricated its loss in 2002. The two papers announced an end to their dispute on April 16, 2007. The JOA was terminated when the Post-Intelligencer ceased publication; its final printed edition was March 17, 2009.

The newspaper was founded in 1863 as the weekly Seattle Gazette, and was later published daily in broadsheet format. It was long one of the city's two daily newspapers, along with The Seattle Times, until it became an online-only publication on March 18, 2009. History The front page of the last printed edition of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, published on March 17, 2009. J.R. Watson founded the Seattle Gazette', Seattle's first newspaper, on December 10, 1863. The paper failed after a few years and was renamed the Weekly Intelligencer in 1867 by new owner Sam Maxwell. In 1878, after publishing the Intelligencer as a morning daily, printer Thaddeus Hanford bought the Daily Intelligencer for $8,000. Hanford also acquired the daily Puget Sound Dispatch and the weekly Pacific Tribune and folded both papers into the Intelligencer. In 1881, the Intelligencer merged with the Seattle Post. The names were combined to form the present-day name. In 1886, Indiana businessman Leigh S. J. Hunt came to Seattle and purchased the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, which he owned and published until he was forced to sell in the Panic of 1893. At this point the newspaper was acquired by attorney and real estate developer James D. Hoge under whom it was representative of an establishment viewpoint. It was the state's predominant newspaper. Circulation was greatly increased by coverage of the Klondike Gold Rush in 1897. Hoge who was involved in other business sought to find a buyer and sold in 1899. The newspaper was acquired with assistance from James J. Hill by John L. Wilson who had first started the Seattle Klondike Information Bureau. The newspaper was acquired by Hearst in 1921. Circulation stood at 31,000 in 1911. In 1912, editor Eric W. Allen left the paper to found the University of Oregon School of Journalism, which he ran until his death in 1944. William Randolph Hearst took over the paper in 1921, and the Hearst Corporation owns the P-I to this day. In 1936, 35 P-I writers and members of The Newspaper Guild went on three-month strike against \\"arbitrary dismissals and assignment changes and other 'efficiency' moves by the newspaper.\\" The International Brotherhood of Teamsters joined the strike in solidarity. Roger Simpson and William Ames co-wrote their book Unionism or Hearst: the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Strike of 1936 on the topic.Roger A. Simpson Papers. 1933-1994. 2.42 cubic feet (3 boxes), 15 sound tape reels. Anna Roosevelt Halsted, the daughter of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, began working as the editor of the women's page at the P-I after her husband Clarence John Boettiger took over as publisher in 1936. Boettiger left Seattle to enter the U.S. Army in April 1943, while Anna stayed at the paper to help keep a liberal voice in the running of the paper. After Boettiger's absence, the paper increasingly turned conservative with Hearst's new acting publisher. Anna left Seattle in December 1943 to live in the White House with her youngest child, Johnny. This effectively ended the Roosevelt-Boettiger ties with the P-I. On December 15, 2006, no copies were printed as a result of a power outage caused by the December 2006 Pacific Northwest storms. It was the first time in 70 years that publication had been suspended. On January 9, 2009, the Hearst Corporation announced that after losing money on it every year since 2000, Hearst was putting the P-I up for sale. The paper would be put on the market for 60 days, and if a buyer could not be found within that time, the paper would either be turned into an Internet-only publication with a drastically reduced staff, or closed outright. The news of the paper's impending sale was initially broken by local station KING-TV the night prior to the official announcement, and came as a surprise to the P-Is staff and the owners of rival newspaper The Seattle Times. Analysts did not expect a buyer to be found, in view of declining circulation in the U.S. newspaper industry and other newspapers on the market going unsold. Five days before the 60-day deadline, the P-I reported that the Hearst Corporation had given several P-I reporters provisional job offers for an online edition of the P-I. On March 16, 2009, the newspaper posted a headline on its front page, followed shortly after by a short news story, that explained that the following day's edition would be its final one in print. The newspaper's publisher, Roger Oglesby, was quoted saying that the P-I would continue as an online-only operation. Print subscribers had their subscriptions automatically transferred to The Seattle Times on March 18. , the P-I continues as an online-only newspaper. In September 2010, the site had an estimated 2.8 million unique visitors and 208,000 visitors per day.seattlepi.com \\"Quantcast Audience Profile\\", quantcast, September 2010 Joint operating agreement From 1983 to 2009, the P-I and The Seattle Times had a joint operating agreement (JOA) whereby advertising, production, marketing, and circulation were run for both papers by the Seattle Times Company. They maintained separate news and editorial departments. The papers published a combined Sunday edition, although the Times handled the majority of the editorial content while the P-I only provided a small editorial/opinions section. In 2003 the Times tried to cancel the JOA, citing a clause in it that three consecutive years of losses were cause for cancelling the agreement. Hearst disagreed, and immediately filed suit to prevent the Times from cancelling the agreement. Hearst argued that a force majeure clause prevented the Times from claiming losses in 2000 and 2001 as reason to end the JOA, because they resulted from extraordinary events (in this case, a seven-week newspaper strike). Each side publicly accused the other of attempting to put its rival out of business. The trial judge granted a summary judgment in Hearst's favor on the force majeure issue. But after two appeals, the Washington State Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Times on June 30, 2005, on the force majeure clause, reversing the trial-court judge. The two papers settled the issue on April 16, 2007. The JOA ended in 2009 with the cessation of the P-I print edition. Awards The P-I was notable for its two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist, David Horsey. Report on Judge Gary Little Investigative reporting on King County Superior Court Judge Gary Little's out-of-court contact with juvenile defendants revealed accusations that Little molested young boys while he was a teacher at Seattle's exclusive Lakeside School between 1968 and 1971. It also revealed inappropriate contact between Little and juveniles appearing before him after he became a judge. On August 19, 1988, after reporter Duff Wilson called the judge to advise him the newspaper was publishing the story, Little shot himself in the King County Courthouse. The ethical debates surrounding the publication of the storyand the network of connections that protected Littleare taught in journalism classes, and led to reforms in the way judges are disciplined in Washington state. Conduct Unbecoming series In 2006 the P-I became the subject of a complaint to the Washington News Council for its reporting on the King County Sheriff's Office. The media watch-dog group ruled against the P-I, agreeing with Sheriff Sue Rahr's complaint that the newspaper had unfairly disparaged the Sheriff's Office. The P-I declined to participate in the proceedings, and opted instead to give a detailed reply on its website. The P-I Globe The P-I Globe is an official Seattle Landmark. The P-I is known for the 13.5-ton, neon globe atop its headquarters on the Elliott Bay waterfront, which features the words \\"It's in the P-I\\" rotating around the globe and an eagle perched atop with wings stretched upwards. The globe originated from a 1947 readers' contest to determine a new symbol for the paper. Out of 350 entrants, the winner was by Jack (known as Jakk) C. Corsaw, a University of Washington art student. The globe was manufactured in 1948 and was placed atop the paper's then-new headquarters building at 6th Avenue and Wall Street (now City University of Seattle). When the newspaper moved its headquarters again in 1986, to its current location on the waterfront, the globe was relocated to the new building. Over the decades since its first installation, the globe has become a city landmark that, to locals, is as iconic as the Space Needle. A stylized rendering of the globe appeared on the masthead of the newspaper in its latter years and continues to feature on its website. In April 2012, it was designated a Seattle Landmark by the city's Landmarks Preservation Board. Mayor Ed Murray signed a city ordinance that had been passed by the Seattle City Council on December 17, 2015 that designated the globe as an official city landmark. In March 2012, the globe was donated to the Museum of History and Industry, which planned to refurbish and relocate it, but as of fall 2018 this had not occurred. Notable employees Notable employees of the P-I have included the novelists E. B. White, Frank Herbert, Tom Robbins, and Emmett Watson, as well as Andrew Schneider, who won two Pulitzer Prizes for specialized reporting and public service while working at The Pittsburgh Press.

In the simplest example of this relationship, one of the theories describes strings propagating in an imaginary spacetime shaped like a circle of some radius R, while the other theory describes strings propagating on a spacetime shaped like a circle of radius proportional to 1/R. The idea of T-duality was first noted by Bala Sathiapalan in an obscure paper in 1987.Sathiapalan 1987 The two T-dual theories are equivalent in the sense that all observable quantities in one description are identified with quantities in the dual description. For example, momentum in one description takes discrete values and is equal to the number of times the string winds around the circle in the dual description. The idea of T-duality can be extended to more complicated theories, including superstring theories. The existence of these dualities implies that seemingly different superstring theories are actually physically equivalent. This led to the realization, in the mid-1990s, that all of the five consistent superstring theories are just different limiting cases of a single eleven-dimensional theory called M-theory. In general, T-duality relates two theories with different spacetime geometries. In this way, T-duality suggests a possible scenario in which the classical notions of geometry break down in a theory of Planck scale physics.Seiberg 2006 The geometric relationships suggested by T-duality are also important in pure mathematics. Indeed, according to the SYZ conjecture of Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow, T-duality is closely related to another duality called mirror symmetry, which has important applications in a branch of mathematics called enumerative algebraic geometry. Overview=Strings and duality T-duality is a particular example of a general notion of duality in physics. The term duality refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical systems turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena. Like many of the dualities studied in theoretical physics, T-duality was discovered in the context of string theory.Sathiapalan 1987. Other dualities that arise in string theory are S-duality, U-duality, mirror symmetry, and the AdS/CFT correspondence. In string theory, particles are modeled not as zero-dimensional points but as one-dimensional extended objects called strings. The physics of strings can be studied in various numbers of dimensions. In addition to three familiar dimensions from everyday experience (up/down, left/right, forward/backward), string theories may include one or more compact dimensions which are curled up into circles. A standard analogy for this is to consider multidimensional object such as a garden hose.This analogy is used for example in Greene 2000, p.186 If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, it appears to have only one dimension, its length. However, as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions. Such extra dimensions are important in T-duality, which relates a theory in which strings propagate on a circle of some radius R to a theory in which strings propagate on a circle of radius 1/R. Winding numbers In mathematics, the winding number of a curve in the plane around a given point is an integer representing the total number of times that curve travels counterclockwise around the point. The notion of winding number is important in the mathematical description of T-duality where it is used to measure the winding of strings around compact extra dimensions. For example, the image below shows several examples of curves in the plane, illustrated in red. Each curve is assumed to be closed, meaning it has no endpoints, and is allowed to intersect itself. Each curve has an orientation given by the arrows in the picture. In each situation, there is a distinguished point in the plane, illustrated in black. The winding number of the curve around this distinguished point is equal to the total number of counterclockwise turns that the curve makes around this point. { align=\\"center\\" border=0 cellpadding=0 -valign=\\"center\\" \\\\cdots align=\\"center\\" 80px align=\\"center\\" 80px align=\\"center\\" 80px  -valign=\\"top\\" style=\\"height:3em\\"  align=\\"center\\"‚àí2 align=\\"center\\"‚àí1 align=\\"center\\"0  -valign=\\"center\\"  align=\\"center\\" 80px align=\\"center\\" 80px align=\\"center\\" 80px \\\\cdots -valign=\\"top\\"  align=\\"center\\"1 align=\\"center\\"2 align=\\"center\\"3  } When counting the total number of turns, counterclockwise turns count as positive, while clockwise turns counts as negative. For example, if the curve first circles the origin four times counterclockwise, and then circles the origin once clockwise, then the total winding number of the curve is three. According to this scheme, a curve that does not travel around the distinguished point at all has winding number zero, while a curve that travels clockwise around the point has negative winding number. Therefore, the winding number of a curve may be any integer. The pictures above show curves with winding numbers between ‚àí2 and 3: Quantized momenta The simplest theories in which T-duality arises are two-dimensional sigma models with circular target spaces. These are simple quantum field theories that describe propagation of strings in an imaginary spacetime shaped like a circle. The strings can thus be modeled as curves in the plane that are confined to lie in a circle, say of radius R, about the origin. In what follows, the strings are assumed to be closed (that is, without endpoints). Denote this circle by S_R^1. One can think of this circle as a copy of the real line with two points identified if they differ by a multiple of the circle's circumference 2\\\\pi R. It follows that the state of a string at any given time can be represented as a function \\\\varphi(\\\\theta) of a single real parameter \\\\theta. Such a function can be expanded in a Fourier series as :\\\\varphi(\\\\theta)=mR\\\\theta+x+\\\\sum_{n eq0}c_ne^{in\\\\theta}. Here m denotes the winding number of the string around the circle, and the constant mode x=c_0 of the Fourier series has been singled out. Since this expression represents the configuration of a string at a fixed time, all coefficients (x and the c_n) are also functions of time. Let \\\\dot{x} denote the time derivative of the constant mode x. This represents a type of momentum in the theory. One can show, using the fact that the strings considered here are closed, that this momentum can only take on discrete values of the form \\\\dot{x}=n/R for some integer n. In more physical language, one says that the momentum spectrum is quantized. An equivalence of theories In the situation described above, the total energy, or Hamiltonian, of the string is given by the expression :H=(mR)^2+\\\\dot{x}^2+\\\\sum_n\\\\dot{c}_n^2+n^2c_n^2. Since the momenta of the theory are quantized, the first two terms in this formula are (mR)^2+(n/R)^2, and this expression is unchanged when one simultaneously replaces the radius R by 1/R and exchanges the winding number m and the integer n. The summation in the expression for H is similarly unaffected by these changes, so the total energy is unchanged. In fact, this equivalence of Hamiltonians descends to an equivalence of two quantum mechanical theories: One of these theories describes strings propagating on a circle of radius R, while the other describes string propagating in a circle of radius 1/R with momentum and winding numbers interchanged. This equivalence of theories is the simplest manifestation of T-duality. Superstrings A diagram of string theory dualities. Blue edges indicate S-duality. Red edges indicate T-duality. Up until the mid 1990s, physicists working on string theory believed there were five distinct versions of the theory: type I, type IIA, type IIB, and the two flavors of heterotic string theory (SO(32) and E8√óE8). The different theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different symmetries. In the mid 1990s, physicists noticed that these five string theories are actually related by highly nontrivial dualities. One of these dualities is T-duality. For example, it was shown that type IIA string theory is equivalent to type IIB string theory via T-duality and also that the two versions of heterotic string theory are related by T-duality. The existence of these dualities showed that the five string theories were in fact not all distinct theories. In 1995, at the string theory conference at University of Southern California, Edward Witten made the surprising suggestion that all five of these theories were just different limits of a single theory now known as M-theory.Witten 1995 Witten's proposal was based on the observation that different superstring theories are linked by dualities and the fact that type IIA and E8√óE8 heterotic string theories are closely related to a gravitational theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity. His announcement led to a flurry of work now known as the second superstring revolution. Mirror symmetry A hypersurface of a six-dimensional Calabi‚ÄìYau manifold. In string theory and algebraic geometry, the term \\"mirror symmetry\\" refers to a phenomenon involving complicated shapes called Calabi-Yau manifolds. These manifolds provide an interesting geometry on which strings can propagate, and the resulting theories may have applications in particle physics.Candelas et al. 1985 In the late 1980s, it was noticed that such a Calabi-Yau manifold does not uniquely determine the physics of the theory. Instead, one finds that there are two Calabi-Yau manifolds that give rise to the same physics.Dixon 1988; Lerche, Vafa, and Warner 1989 These manifolds are said to be \\"mirror\\" to one another. This mirror duality is an important computational tool in string theory, and it has allowed mathematicians to solve difficult problems in enumerative geometry.Zaslow 2008 A torus is the cartesian product of two circles. One approach to understanding mirror symmetry is the SYZ conjecture, which was suggested by Andrew Strominger, Shing-Tung Yau, and Eric Zaslow in 1996.Strominger, Yau, and Zaslow 1996 According to the SYZ conjecture, mirror symmetry can be understood by dividing a complicated Calabi-Yau manifold into simpler pieces and considering the effects of T-duality on these pieces.Yau and Nadis 2010, p.174 The simplest example of a Calabi-Yau manifold is a torus (a surface shaped like a donut). Such a surface can be viewed as the product of two circles. This means that the torus can be viewed as the union of a collection of longitudinal circles (such as the red circle in the image). There is an auxiliary space which says how these circles are organized, and this space is itself a circle (the pink circle). This space is said to parametrize the longitudinal circles on the torus. In this case, mirror symmetry is equivalent to T-duality acting on the longitudinal circles, changing their radii from R to \\\\alpha'/R, with \\\\alpha ' the inverse of the string tension. The SYZ conjecture generalizes this idea to the more complicated case of six-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds like the one illustrated above. As in the case of a torus, one can divide a six-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold into simpler pieces, which in this case are 3-tori (three- dimensional objects which generalize the notion of a torus) parametrized by a 3-sphere (a three-dimensional generalization of a sphere).More precisely, there is a 3-torus associated to every point on the three-sphere except at certain bad points, which correspond to singular tori. See Yau and Nadis 2010, pp.176‚Äì7. T-duality can be extended from circles to the three-dimensional tori appearing in this decomposition, and the SYZ conjecture states that mirror symmetry is equivalent to the simultaneous application of T-duality to these three-dimensional tori.Yau and Nadis 2010, p.178 In this way, the SYZ conjecture provides a geometric picture of how mirror symmetry acts on a Calabi-Yau manifold.

He is noted for having called the first representative legislature in New York, and for granting the province's Charter of Liberties. Biography=Early life He was born in 1634 into an old Gaelic Norman (Irish Catholic) family in Castletown Kildrought (now Celbridge), County Kildare, in the Kingdom of Ireland, the seventh and youngest son of Sir John Dongan, Baronet, Member of the Irish Parliament, and his wife Mary Talbot, daughter of Sir William Talbot, 1st Baronet and Alison Netterville. As Stuart supporters, after the overthrow of King Charles I, the family went to King Louis XIV's France, although they managed to hold on to at least part of their Irish estates. His family gave their name to the Dongan Dragoons, a premier military regiment. Career While in France, he served in an Irish regiment with Turenne. He stayed in France after the Restoration and achieved the rank of colonel in 1674.Driscoll, John T. \\"Thomas Dongan.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 Jun. 2014 After the Treaty of Nijmegen ended the French-Dutch War in 1678, Dongan returned to England in obedience to the order that recalled all English subjects fighting in service to France. Fellow officer James, Duke of York, arranged to have him granted a high- ranking commission in the army designated for service in Flanders and a pension.Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot 2nd Edition 2000 Phoenix Press p. 117 That same year, he was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Tangiers, which had been granted to England as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza. He served as part of the Tangier Garrison which defended the settlement. Governor of New York In September 1682, James, Lord Proprietor of the Province of New York, appointed Dongan as Vice-admiral in the Navy and provincial governor (1683‚Äì1688) to replace Edmund AndrosThe Memorial History of the City of New York, page 400 (appointment)and 453 (supersession) \\"Dongan's long service in the French army had made him conversant with the French character and diplomacy and his campaigns in the Low Countries had given him a knowledge of the Dutch language.\\"Phelan, Thomas P. \\"Thomas Dongan, Catholic Colonial Governor of New York\\".

The estate eventually became the town of Castleton; later, another section of the island was named Dongan Hills in honour of Dongan. Dongan landed in Boston on August 10, 1683, crossed Long Island Sound, and passed through the small settlements in the eastern part of the island and he made his way to Fort James, arriving on August 25. In October, Rev. Henry Selyns, reported to the Amsterdam Classis, \\"...our new governor has at last arrived. his excellency is a person of knowledge refinement and modesty. I have had the pleasure of receiving a call from him and I have the privilege of calling on him whenever I desire.\\" At the time of his appointment, the province was bankrupt and in a state of rebellion. Dongan was able to restore order and stability. On 14 October 1683, he convened the first-ever representative assembly in New York history at Fort James. The New York General Assembly, under the wise supervision of Dongan, passed an act entitled \\"A Charter of Liberties\\". It decreed that the supreme legislative power under the Duke of York shall reside in a governor, council, and the people convened in general assembly; conferred upon the members of the assembly rights and privileges making them a body coequal to and independent of the British Parliament; established town, county, and general courts of justice; solemnly proclaimed the right of religious liberty; and passed acts enunciating certain constitutional liberties, e.g. taxes could be levied only by the people met in general assembly; right of suffrage; and no martial law or quartering of the soldiers without the consent of the inhabitants. Dongan soon incurred the ill will of William Penn who was negotiating with the Iroquois for the purchase of the upper Susquehanna Valley. Dongan went to Albany, and declared that the sale would be \\"prejudicial to His Highness's interests\\". The Cayugas sold the property to New York with the consent of the Mohawk. Years later, when back in England and in favor at the Court of James, Penn would use his influence to prejudice the king against Dongan. Statue of Thomas Dongan in Dongan Park adjacent to Dongan Place, Poughkeepsie, NY, dedicated June, 1930 by NY Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. On 22 July 1686 Governor Dongan granted Albany a municipal charter. Almost identical in form to the charter awarded to New York City just three months earlier, the Albany charter was the result of negotiations conducted between royal officials and Robert Livingston and Pieter Schuyler. The charter incorporated the city of Albany, establishing a separate municipal entity in the midst of the Van Rensselaer Manor.\\"The Dongan Charter\\", New York State Museum Dongan established the boundary lines of the province by settling disputes with Connecticut on the East, with the French Governor of Canada on the North, with Pennsylvania on the South, thus marking out the present limits of New York State. Regarding Canada, it was necessary to secure the friendship of the Iroquois. This became the subject of a deal of correspondence between Dongan and his counterpart to the north. \\"...[C]ertainly our rum doth as little hurt as your brandy and in the opinion of Christians is much more wholesome.\\" Dongan journeyed to the Iroquois nation, and convened assembly with them, garnering support, and approval. He was called \\"corlur\\" by the Iroquois Chief, a term from the Irish language \\"Co·πÅairleoir,\\" used in Parliamentary deference to the Speaker, and meaning \\"advisor.\\" James later consolidated the colonial governments of New York, New Jersey and the United Colonies of New England into the Dominion of New England and appointed Edmund Andros, the former Governor-General of New York, as Governor-General. Dongan transferred his governorship back to Andros on 11 August 1688. Dongan was to execute land grants establishing several towns throughout New York State including the eastern Long Island communities of East Hampton and Southampton. These grants, called the Dongan Patents, set up Town Trustees as the governing bodies with a mission of managing common land for common good. The Dongan Patents still hold force of law and have been upheld by the US Supreme Court with the Trustees‚Äîrather than town boards, city councils or even the State Legislature‚Äîstill managing much of the common land in the state. In 1698, his brother William, Earl of Limerick, died without issue. Because of his service to the Crown as a military officer and as provincial governor, he was granted his brother's title in the Peerage of Ireland and a portion of his brother's forfeited estates by a special Act of Parliament for his relief. In 1709, Lord Limerick sold his 2,300-acre property at Celbridge to William Conolly. Death He lived in London for the last years of his life and died on 14 December 1715.

S-duality is useful for doing calculations in theoretical physics because it relates a theory in which calculations are difficult to a theory in which they are easier.Frenkel 2009, p.2 In quantum field theory, S-duality generalizes a well established fact from classical electrodynamics, namely the invariance of Maxwell's equations under the interchange of electric and magnetic fields. One of the earliest known examples of S-duality in quantum field theory is Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality which relates two versions of a quantum field theory called N = 4 supersymmetric Yang‚ÄìMills theory. Recent work of Anton Kapustin and Edward Witten suggests that Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality is closely related to a research program in mathematics called the geometric Langlands program. Another realization of S-duality in quantum field theory is Seiberg duality, which relates two versions of a theory called N=1 supersymmetric Yang‚ÄìMills theory. There are also many examples of S-duality in string theory. The existence of these string dualities implies that seemingly different formulations of string theory are actually physically equivalent. This led to the realization, in the mid-1990s, that all of the five consistent superstring theories are just different limiting cases of a single eleven-dimensional theory called M-theory.Zwiebach 2009, p.325 Overview In quantum field theory and string theory, a coupling constant is a number that controls the strength of interactions in the theory. For example, the strength of gravity is described by a number called Newton's constant, which appears in Newton's law of gravity and also in the equations of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. Similarly, the strength of the electromagnetic force is described by a coupling constant, which is related to the charge carried by a single proton. To compute observable quantities in quantum field theory or string theory, physicists typically apply the methods of perturbation theory. In perturbation theory, quantities called probability amplitudes, which determine the probability for various physical processes to occur, are expressed as sums of infinitely many terms, where each term is proportional to a power of the coupling constant g: : A=A_0+A_1g+A_2g^2+A_3g^3+\\\\dots. In order for such an expression to make sense, the coupling constant must be less than 1 so that the higher powers of g become negligibly small and the sum is finite. If the coupling constant is not less than 1, then the terms of this sum will grow larger and larger, and the expression gives a meaningless infinite answer. In this case the theory is said to be strongly coupled, and one cannot use perturbation theory to make predictions. For certain theories, S-duality provides a way of doing computations at strong coupling by translating these computations into different computations in a weakly coupled theory. S-duality is a particular example of a general notion of duality in physics. The term duality refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical systems turn out to be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena. S-duality is useful because it relates a theory with coupling constant g to an equivalent theory with coupling constant 1/g. Thus it relates a strongly coupled theory (where the coupling constant g is much greater than 1) to a weakly coupled theory (where the coupling constant 1/g is much less than 1 and computations are possible). For this reason, S-duality is called a strong-weak duality. S-duality in quantum field theory=A symmetry of Maxwell's equations In classical physics, the behavior of the electric and magnetic field is described by a system of equations known as Maxwell's equations. Working in the language of vector calculus and assuming that no electric charges or currents are present, these equations can be writtenGriffiths 1999, p.326 :\\\\begin{align} abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{E} &= 0, \\\\ abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{B} &= 0, \\\\ abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{E} &= -\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathbf B}{\\\\partial t}, \\\\ abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} &= \\\\frac{1}{c^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf E}{\\\\partial t}. \\\\end{align} Here \\\\mathbf{E} is a vector (or more precisely a vector field whose magnitude and direction may vary from point to point in space) representing the electric field, \\\\mathbf{B} is a vector representing the magnetic field, t is time, and c is the speed of light. The other symbols in these equations refer to the divergence and curl, which are concepts from vector calculus. An important property of these equationsGriffiths 1999, p.327 is their invariance under the transformation that simultaneously replaces the electric field \\\\mathbf{E} by the magnetic field \\\\mathbf{B} and replaces \\\\mathbf{B} by -1/c^2\\\\mathbf{E}: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{E} &\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbf{B} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{B} &\\\\rightarrow -\\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\mathbf{E}. \\\\end{align} In other words, given a pair of electric and magnetic fields that solve Maxwell's equations, it is possible to describe a new physical setup in which these electric and magnetic fields are essentially interchanged, and the new fields will again give a solution of Maxwell's equations. This situation is the most basic manifestation of S-duality in quantum field theory. Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality In quantum field theory, the electric and magnetic fields are unified into a single entity called the electromagnetic field, and this field is described by a special type of quantum field theory called a gauge theory or Yang‚ÄìMills theory. In a gauge theory, the physical fields have a high degree of symmetry which can be understood mathematically using the notion of a Lie group. This Lie group is known as the gauge group. The electromagnetic field is described by a very simple gauge theory corresponding to the abelian gauge group U(1), but there are other gauge theories with more complicated non-abelian gauge groups.For an introduction to quantum field theory in general including the basics of gauge theory, see Zee 2010. It is natural to ask whether there is an analog in gauge theory of the symmetry interchanging the electric and magnetic fields in Maxwell's equations. The answer was given in the late 1970s by Claus Montonen and David Olive,Montonen and Olive 1977 building on earlier work of Peter Goddard, Jean Nuyts, and Olive.Goddard, Nuyts, and Olive 1977 Their work provides an example of S-duality now known as Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality. Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality applies to a very special type of gauge theory called N = 4 supersymmetric Yang‚ÄìMills theory, and it says that two such theories may be equivalent in a certain precise sense. If one of the theories has a gauge group G, then the dual theory has gauge group {^L}G where {^L}G denotes the Langlands dual group which is in general different from G.Frenkel 2009, p.5 An important quantity in quantum field theory is complexified coupling constant. This is a complex number defined by the formulaFrenkel 2009, p.12 :\\\\tau=\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2\\\\pi}+\\\\frac{4\\\\pi i}{g^2} where \\\\theta is the theta angle, a quantity appearing in the Lagrangian that defines the theory, and g is the coupling constant. For example, in the Yang‚ÄìMills theory that describes the electromagnetic field, this number g is simply the elementary charge e carried by a single proton. In addition to exchanging the gauge groups of the two theories, Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality transforms a theory with complexified coupling constant \\\\tau to a theory with complexified constant -1/\\\\tau. Relation to the Langlands program The geometric Langlands correspondence is a relationship between abstract geometric objects associated to an algebraic curve such as the elliptic curves illustrated above. In mathematics, the classical Langlands correspondence is a collection of results and conjectures relating number theory to the branch of mathematics known as representation theory.Frenkel 2007 Formulated by Robert Langlands in the late 1960s, the Langlands correspondence is related to important conjectures in number theory such as the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture, which includes Fermat's last theorem as a special case. In spite of its importance in number theory, establishing the Langlands correspondence in the number theoretic context has proved extremely difficult. As a result, some mathematicians have worked on a related conjecture known as the geometric Langlands correspondence. This is a geometric reformulation of the classical Langlands correspondence which is obtained by replacing the number fields appearing in the original version by function fields and applying techniques from algebraic geometry. In a paper from 2007, Anton Kapustin and Edward Witten suggested that the geometric Langlands correspondence can be viewed as a mathematical statement of Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality.Kapustin and Witten 2007 Starting with two Yang‚ÄìMills theories related by S-duality, Kapustin and Witten showed that one can construct a pair of quantum field theories in two-dimensional spacetime. By analyzing what this dimensional reduction does to certain physical objects called D-branes, they showed that one can recover the mathematical ingredients of the geometric Langlands correspondence.Aspinwall et al. 2009, p.415 Their work shows that the Langlands correspondence is closely related to S-duality in quantum field theory, with possible applications in both subjects. Seiberg duality Another realization of S-duality in quantum field theory is Seiberg duality, first introduced by Nathan Seiberg around 1995.Seiberg 1995 Unlike Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality, which relates two versions of the maximally supersymmetric gauge theory in four-dimensional spacetime, Seiberg duality relates less symmetric theories called N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. The two N=1 theories appearing in Seiberg duality are not identical, but they give rise to the same physics at large distances. Like Montonen‚ÄìOlive duality, Seiberg duality generalizes the symmetry of Maxwell's equations that interchanges electric and magnetic fields. S-duality in string theory A diagram of string theory dualities. Blue edges indicate S-duality. Red edges indicate T-duality. Up until the mid 1990s, physicists working on string theory believed there were five distinct versions of the theory: type I, type IIA, type IIB, and the two flavors of heterotic string theory (SO(32) and E8√óE8). The different theories allow different types of strings, and the particles that arise at low energies exhibit different symmetries. In the mid 1990s, physicists noticed that these five string theories are actually related by highly nontrivial dualities. One of these dualities is S-duality. The existence of S-duality in string theory was first proposed by Ashoke Sen in 1994.Sen 1994 It was shown that type IIB string theory with the coupling constant g is equivalent via S-duality to the same string theory with the coupling constant 1/g. Similarly, type I string theory with the coupling g is equivalent to the SO(32) heterotic string theory with the coupling constant 1/g. The existence of these dualities showed that the five string theories were in fact not all distinct theories. In 1995, at the string theory conference at University of Southern California, Edward Witten made the surprising suggestion that all five of these theories were just different limits of a single theory now known as M-theory.Witten 1995 Witten's proposal was based on the observation that type IIA and E8√óE8 heterotic string theories are closely related to a gravitational theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity. His announcement led to a flurry of work now known as the second superstring revolution.

Terror is usually described as the feeling of dread and anticipation that precedes the horrifying experience. By contrast, horror is the feeling of revulsion that usually follows a frightening sight, sound, or otherwise experience. Horror has also been defined by Noel Carroll as a combination of terror and revulsion.M Hills, The Pleasures of Horror' (2005) p. 17 Literary Gothic The distinction between terror and horror was first characterized by the Gothic writer Ann Radcliffe (1764-1823), horror being more related to being shocked or scared (being horrified) at an awful realization or a deeply unpleasant occurrence, while terror is more related to being anxious or fearful.Varma 1966. Radcliffe considered that terror is characterized by \\"obscurity\\" or indeterminacy in its treatment of potentially horrible events, something which leads to the sublime. She says in the essay that it \\"expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life\\". Horror, in contrast, \\"freezes and nearly annihilates them\\" with its unambiguous displays of atrocity. She goes on: \\"I apprehend that neither Shakespeare nor Milton by their fictions, nor Mr Burke by his reasoning, anywhere looked to positive horror as a source of the sublime, though they all agree that terror is a very high one; and where lies the great difference between horror and terror, but in uncertainty and obscurity, that accompany the first, respecting the dreader evil.\\"Radcliffe: 1826. According to Devendra Varma in The Gothic Flame (1966): > The difference between Terror and Horror is the difference between awful > apprehension and sickening realization: between the smell of death and > stumbling against a corpse. Horror fiction Horror is also a genre of film and fiction that relies on horrifying images or situations to tell stories and prompt reactions or jump scares to put their audiences on edge. In these films the moment of horrifying revelation is usually preceded by a terrifying build up, often using the medium of scary music.Wisker 2005. In his non-fiction book Danse Macabre, Stephen King stressed how horror tales normally chart the outbreak of madness/the terrible within an everyday setting.S King, Danse Macabre (London 1994) p. 443 and p. 308 He also elaborated on the twin themes of terror and horror, adding a third element which he referred to as \\"revulsion\\". He describes terror as \\"the finest element\\" of the three, and the one he strives hardest to maintain in his own writing. Citing many examples, he defines \\"terror\\" as the suspenseful moment in horror before the actual monster is revealed. \\"Horror,\\" King writes, is that moment at which one sees the creature/aberration that causes the terror or suspense, a \\"shock value\\". King finally compares \\"revulsion\\" with the gag-reflex, a bottom-level, cheap gimmick which he admits he often resorts to in his own fiction if necessary, confessing: > I recognize terror as the finest emotion and so I will try to terrorize the > reader. But if I find that I cannot terrify, I will try to horrify, and if I > find that I cannot horrify, I'll go for the gross-out. I'm not proud. Psychoanalytic views Freud likened the experience of horror to that of the uncanny.S Freud, The ‚ÄúUncanny‚Äù Imago V 1919 p. 27 In his wake, Georges Bataille saw horror as akin to ecstasy in its transcendence of the everyday;E Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan' (Cambridge 1999) p. 122 and p. 131 as opening a way to go beyond rational social consciousness.W Paulett, G S Bataille (2015) p. 67 and p. 101 Julia Kristeva in turn considered horror as evoking experience of the primitive, the infantile, and the demoniacal aspects of unmediated femininity.J Kristeva, Powers of Horror (New York 1981) p. 63-5 Horror, helplessness and trauma The paradox of pleasure experienced through horror films/books can be explained partly as stemming from relief from real-life horror in the experience of horror in play, partly as a safe way to return in adult life to the paralysing feelings of infantile helplessness.R Solomon, In Defence of Sentimentality (200) p. 108-113 Helplessness is also a factor in the overwhelming experience of real horror in psychological trauma.D Goleman, Emotional Intelligence (London 1996) p. 203-4 Playing at re-experiencing the trauma may be a helpful way of overcoming it.O Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 542-3  See also References Bibliography  *Steven Bruhm (1994) Gothic Bodies: The Politics of Pain in Romantic Fiction.

In such a formulation, along with ordinary space dimensions x, y, z, ..., there are also \\"anticommuting\\" dimensions whose coordinates are labeled in Grassmann numbers rather than real numbers. The ordinary space dimensions correspond to bosonic degrees of freedom, the anticommuting dimensions to fermionic degrees of freedom. The word \\"superspace\\" was first used by John Wheeler in an unrelated sense to describe the configuration space of general relativity; for example, this usage may be seen in his 1973 textbook Gravitation. Informal discussion There are several similar, but not equivalent, definitions of superspace that have been used, and continue to be used in the mathematical and physics literature. One such usage is as a synonym for super Minkowski space.S. J. Gates, Jr., M. T. Grisaru, M. Roƒçek, W. Siegel, Superspace or One Thousand and One Lessons in Supersymmetry, Benjamins Cumming Publishing (1983) . In this case, one takes ordinary Minkowski space, and extends it with anti- commuting fermionic degrees of freedom, taken to be anti-commuting Weyl spinors from the Clifford algebra associated to the Lorentz group. Equivalently, the super Minkowski space can be understood as the quotient of the super Poincar√© algebra modulo the algebra of the Lorentz group. A typical notation for the coordinates on such a space is (x,\\\\theta,\\\\bar{\\\\theta}) with the overline being the give-away that super Minkowski space is the intended space. Superspace is also commonly used as a synonym for the super vector space. This is taken to be an ordinary vector space, together with additional coordinates taken from the Grassmann algebra, i.e. coordinate directions that are Grassmann numbers. There are several conventions for constructing a super vector space in use; two of these are described by RogersAlice Rogers, Supermanifolds: Theory and Applications, World Scientific (2007) . and DeWitt.Bryce DeWitt, Supermanifolds, Cambridge University Press (1984) . A third usage of the term \\"superspace\\" is as a synonym for a supermanifold: a supersymmetric generalization of a manifold. Note that both super Minkowski spaces and super vector spaces can be taken as special cases of supermanifolds. A fourth, and completely unrelated meaning saw a brief usage in general relativity; this is discussed in greater detail at the bottom. Examples Several examples are given below. The first few assume a definition of superspace as a super vector space. This is denoted as Rmn, the Z2-graded vector space with Rm as the even subspace and Rn as the odd subspace. The same definition applies to Cmn. The four-dimensional examples take superspace to be super Minkowski space. Although similar to a vector space, this has many important differences: First of all, it is an affine space, having no special point denoting the origin. Next, the fermionic coordinates are taken to be anti-commuting Weyl spinors from the Clifford algebra, rather than being Grassmann numbers. The difference here is that the Clifford algebra has a considerably richer and more subtle structure than the Grassmann numbers. So, the Grassmann numbers are elements of the exterior algebra, and the Clifford algebra has an isomorphism to the exterior algebra, but its relation to the orthogonal group and the spin group, used to construct the spin representations, give it a deep geometric significance. (For example, the spin groups form a normal part of the study of Riemannian geometry,J√ºrgen Jost, Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis, Springer-Verlag (2002) . quite outside the ordinary bounds and concerns of physics.) Trivial examples The smallest superspace is a point which contains neither bosonic nor fermionic directions. Other trivial examples include the n-dimensional real plane Rn, which is a vector space extending in n real, bosonic directions and no fermionic directions. The vector space R0n, which is the n-dimensional real Grassmann algebra. The space R11 of one even and one odd direction is known as the space of dual numbers, introduced by William Clifford in 1873. The superspace of supersymmetric quantum mechanics Supersymmetric quantum mechanics with N supercharges is often formulated in the superspace R12N, which contains one real direction t identified with time and N complex Grassmann directions which are spanned by Œòi and Œò*i, where i runs from 1 to N. Consider the special case N = 1\\\\. The superspace R12 is a 3-dimensional vector space. A given coordinate therefore may be written as a triple (t, Œò, Œò*). The coordinates form a Lie superalgebra, in which the gradation degree of t is even and that of Œò and Œò* is odd. This means that a bracket may be defined between any two elements of this vector space, and that this bracket reduces to the commutator on two even coordinates and on one even and one odd coordinate while it is an anticommutator on two odd coordinates. This superspace is an abelian Lie superalgebra, which means that all of the aforementioned brackets vanish :::\\\\left[ t,t\\\\right]=\\\\left[ t, \\\\theta\\\\right]=\\\\left[ t, \\\\theta^*\\\\right]=\\\\left{\\\\theta, \\\\theta\\\\right}=\\\\left{ \\\\theta, \\\\theta^*\\\\right} =\\\\left{ \\\\theta^*, \\\\theta^*\\\\right}=0 where [a,b] is the commutator of a and b and {a,b} is the anticommutator of a and b. One may define functions from this vector space to itself, which are called superfields. The above algebraic relations imply that, if we expand our superfield as a power series in Œò and Œò*, then we will only find terms at the zeroeth and first orders, because Œò2 = Œò*2 = 0\\\\. Therefore, superfields may be written as arbitrary functions of t multiplied by the zeroeth and first order terms in the two Grassmann coordinates :::\\\\Phi \\\\left(t,\\\\Theta,\\\\Theta^* \\\\right)=\\\\phi(t)+\\\\Theta\\\\Psi(t)-\\\\Theta^*\\\\Phi^*(t)+\\\\Theta\\\\Theta^* F(t) Superfields, which are representations of the supersymmetry of superspace, generalize the notion of tensors, which are representations of the rotation group of a bosonic space. One may then define derivatives in the Grassmann directions, which take the first order term in the expansion of a superfield to the zeroeth order term and annihilate the zeroeth order term. One can choose sign conventions such that the derivatives satisfy the anticommutation relations :::\\\\left{\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\,,\\\\Theta\\\\right}=\\\\left{\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^*}\\\\,,\\\\Theta^*\\\\right}=1 These derivatives may be assembled into supercharges :::Q=\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}-i\\\\Theta^*\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad Q^\\\\dagger=\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^*}+i\\\\Theta\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} whose anticommutators identify them as the fermionic generators of a supersymmetry algebra :::\\\\left{ Q,Q^\\\\dagger\\\\,\\\\right}=2i\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} where i times the time derivative is the Hamiltonian operator in quantum mechanics. Both Q and its adjoint anticommute with themselves. The supersymmetry variation with supersymmetry parameter Œµ of a superfield Œ¶ is defined to be :::\\\\delta_\\\\epsilon\\\\Phi=(\\\\epsilon^* Q+\\\\epsilon Q^\\\\dagger)\\\\Phi. We can evaluate this variation using the action of Q on the superfields :::\\\\left[Q,\\\\Phi \\\\right]=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}\\\\,-i\\\\theta^*\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right)\\\\Phi=\\\\psi+\\\\theta^*\\\\left(F-i\\\\dot{\\\\phi}\\\\right)+i\\\\theta\\\\theta^*\\\\dot{\\\\psi}. Similarly one may define covariant derivatives on superspace :::D=\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta}-i\\\\theta^*\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad D^\\\\dagger=\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^*}-i\\\\theta\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} which anticommute with the supercharges and satisfy a wrong sign supersymmetry algebra :::\\\\left{D,D^\\\\dagger\\\\right}=-2i\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}. The fact that the covariant derivatives anticommute with the supercharges means the supersymmetry transformation of a covariant derivative of a superfield is equal to the covariant derivative of the same supersymmetry transformation of the same superfield. Thus, generalizing the covariant derivative in bosonic geometry which constructs tensors from tensors, the superspace covariant derivative constructs superfields from superfields. Four-dimensional N = 1 superspace Perhaps the most popular superspace in physics is d=4 N=1 super Minkowski space R44, which is the direct sum of four real bosonic dimensions and four real Grassmann dimensions (also known as fermionic dimensions).Yuval Ne'eman, Elena Eizenberg, Membranes and Other Extendons (p-branes), World Scientific, 1995, p. 5. In supersymmetric quantum field theories one is interested in superspaces which furnish representations of a Lie superalgebra called a supersymmetry algebra. The bosonic part of the supersymmetry algebra is the Poincar√© algebra, while the fermionic part is constructed using spinors of Grassmann numbers. For this reason, in physical applications one considers an action of the supersymmetry algebra on the four fermionic directions of R44 such that they transform as a spinor under the Poincar√© subalgebra. In four dimensions there are three distinct irreducible 4-component spinors. There is the Majorana spinor, the left-handed Weyl spinor and the right-handed Weyl spinor. The CPT theorem implies that in a unitary, Poincar√© invariant theory, which is a theory in which the S-matrix is a unitary matrix and the same Poincar√© generators act on the asymptotic in-states as on the asymptotic out-states, the supersymmetry algebra must contain an equal number of left- handed and right-handed Weyl spinors. However, since each Weyl spinor has four components, this means that if one includes any Weyl spinors one must have 8 fermionic directions. Such a theory is said to have extended supersymmetry, and such models have received a lot of attention. For example, supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges and fundamental matter have been solved by Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten, see Seiberg‚ÄìWitten gauge theory. However, in this subsection we are considering the superspace with four fermionic components and so no Weyl spinors are consistent with the CPT theorem. Note: There are many sign conventions in use and this is only one of them. This leaves us with one possibility, the four fermionic directions transform as a Majorana spinor Œ∏Œ±. We can also form a conjugate spinor :::\\\\overline{\\\\theta}\\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\\\ i\\\\theta^\\\\dagger\\\\gamma^0=-\\\\theta^\\\\perp C where C is the charge conjugation matrix, which is defined by the property that when it conjugates a gamma matrix, the gamma matrix is negated and transposed. The first equality is the definition of while the second is a consequence of the Majorana spinor condition Œ∏* = iŒ≥0CŒ∏. The conjugate spinor plays a role similar to that of Œ∏* in the superspace R12, except that the Majorana condition, as manifested in the above equation, imposes that Œ∏ and Œ∏* are not independent. In particular we may construct the supercharges :::Q=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\overline{\\\\theta}}+\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\theta\\\\partial_\\\\mu which satisfy the supersymmetry algebra :::\\\\left{Q,Q\\\\right}=\\\\left{\\\\overline{Q},Q\\\\right}C=2\\\\gamma^\\\\mu\\\\partial_\\\\mu C=-2i\\\\gamma^\\\\mu P_\\\\mu C where P=i\\\\partial_\\\\mu is the 4-momentum operator. Again the covariant derivative is defined like the supercharge but with the second term negated and it anticommutes with the supercharges. Thus the covariant derivative of a supermultiplet is another supermultiplet. In general relativity The word \\"superspace\\" is also used in a completely different and unrelated sense, in the book Gravitation by Misner, Thorne and Wheeler. There, it refers to the configuration space of general relativity, and, in particular, the view of gravitation as geometrodynamics, an interpretation of general relativity as a form of dynamical geometry. In modern terms, this particular idea of \\"superspace\\" is captured in one of several different formalisms used in solving the Einstein equations in a variety of settings, both theoretical and practical, such as in numerical simulations. This includes primarily the ADM formalism, as well as ideas surrounding the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìEinstein equation and the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation.

Supergravity is the gauge theory of local supersymmetry. Since the supersymmetry (SUSY) generators form together with the Poincar√© algebra a superalgebra, called the super-Poincar√© algebra, supersymmetry as a gauge theory makes gravity arise in a natural way.P. van Nieuwenhuizen, Phys. Rep. 68, 189 (1981) In simple terms, scientists have identified four basic forces behind everything happening around us. They are electromagnetic force (the source of electricity and magnetism), weak force (which relates to radioactivity), strong force (the force that binds up protons and neutrons within the atom) and gravitational force (the reason why apples fall to the ground and the moon revolves around the Earth). Quantum theory can explain the first three types of forces pertinent to the atomic level, however, for big objects, quantum theory is not applicable. Therefore, the gravitational force is only applied in astronomical science and studies. These two theories simultaneously may explain all, however, scientists were finding a theory that may explain both quantum theory and theory of gravitation together - a theory of everything. The theory of supergravity revolves around this intention, to establish a theory that is applicable everywhere. Gravitons Like any field theory of gravity, a supergravity theory contains a spin-2 field whose quantum is the graviton. Supersymmetry requires the graviton field to have a superpartner. This field has spin 3/2 and its quantum is the gravitino. The number of gravitino fields is equal to the number of supersymmetries. History=Gauge supersymmetry The first theory of local supersymmetry was proposed by Dick Arnowitt and Pran Nath in 1975 and was called gauge supersymmetry. Supergravity The first model of 4-dimensional supergravity (without this denotation) was formulated by Dmitri Vasilievich Volkov und Vyacheslav A. Soroka in 1973, emphasizing the importance of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking for the possibility of a realistic model. The minimal version of 4-dimensional supergravity (with unbroken local supersymmetry) was constructed in detail in 1976 by Dan Freedman, Sergio Ferrara and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen. In 2019 the three were awarded a special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for the discovery. The key issue of whether or not the spin 3/2 field is consistently coupled was resolved in the nearly simultaneous paper, by Deser and Zumino, which independently proposed the minimal 4-dimensional model. It was quickly generalized to many different theories in various numbers of dimensions and involving additional (N) supersymmetries. Supergravity theories with N>1 are usually referred to as extended supergravity (SUEGRA). Some supergravity theories were shown to be related to certain higher-dimensional supergravity theories via dimensional reduction (e.g. N=1, 11-dimensional supergravity is dimensionally reduced on T7 to 4-dimensional, ungauged, N=8 Supergravity). The resulting theories were sometimes referred to as Kaluza‚ÄìKlein theories as Kaluza and Klein constructed in 1919 a 5-dimensional gravitational theory, that when dimensionally reduced on a circle, its 4-dimensional non-massive modes describe electromagnetism coupled to gravity. mSUGRA mSUGRA means minimal SUper GRAvity. The construction of a realistic model of particle interactions within the N = 1 supergravity framework where supersymmetry (SUSY) breaks by a super Higgs mechanism carried out by Ali Chamseddine, Richard Arnowitt and Pran Nath in 1982. Collectively now known as minimal supergravity Grand Unification Theories (mSUGRA GUT), gravity mediates the breaking of SUSY through the existence of a hidden sector. mSUGRA naturally generates the Soft SUSY breaking terms which are a consequence of the Super Higgs effect. Radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry through Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) follows as an immediate consequence. Due to its predictive power, requiring only four input parameters and a sign to determine the low energy phenomenology from the scale of Grand Unification, its interest is a widely investigated model of particle physics 11D: the maximal SUGRA One of these supergravities, the 11-dimensional theory, generated considerable excitement as the first potential candidate for the theory of everything. This excitement was built on four pillars, two of which have now been largely discredited: * Werner Nahm showed 11 dimensions as the largest number of dimensions consistent with a single graviton, and more dimensions will show particles with spins greater than 2. However, if two of these dimensions are time-like, these problems are avoided in 12 dimensions. Itzhak Bars gives this emphasis. * In 1981 Ed Witten showed 11 as the smallest number of dimensions big enough to contain the gauge groups of the Standard Model, namely SU(3) for the strong interactions and SU(2) times U(1) for the electroweak interactions. Many techniques exist to embed the standard model gauge group in supergravity in any number of dimensions like the obligatory gauge symmetry in type I and heterotic string theories, and obtained in type II string theory by compactification on certain Calabi‚ÄìYau manifolds. The D-branes engineer gauge symmetries too. * In 1978 Eug√®ne Cremmer, Bernard Julia and Jo√´l Scherk (CJS) foundE. Cremmer, B. Julia and J. Scherk, \\"Supergravity theory in eleven dimensions\\", Physics Letters B76 (1978) pp 409-412, the classical action for an 11-dimensional supergravity theory. This remains today the only known classical 11-dimensional theory with local supersymmetry and no fields of spin higher than two. Other 11-dimensional theories known and quantum-mechanically inequivalent reduce to the CJS theory when one imposes the classical equations of motion. However, in the mid 1980s Bernard de Wit and Hermann Nicolai found an alternate theory in D=11 Supergravity with Local SU(8) Invariance. While not manifestly Lorentz-invariant, it is in many ways superior, because it dimensionally-reduces to the 4-dimensional theory without recourse to the classical equations of motion. * In 1980 Peter Freund and M. A. Rubin showed that compactification from 11 dimensions preserving all the SUSY generators could occur in two ways, leaving only 4 or 7 macroscopic dimensions, the others compact. The noncompact dimensions have to form an anti-de Sitter space. There are many possible compactifications, but the Freund-Rubin compactification's invariance under all of the supersymmetry transformations preserves the action. Finally, the first two results each appeared to establish 11 dimensions, the third result appeared to specify the theory, and the last result explained why the observed universe appears to be four- dimensional. Many of the details of the theory were fleshed out by Peter van Nieuwenhuizen, Sergio Ferrara and Daniel Z. Freedman. The end of the SUGRA era The initial excitement over 11-dimensional supergravity soon waned, as various failings were discovered, and attempts to repair the model failed as well. Problems included: * The compact manifolds which were known at the time and which contained the standard model were not compatible with supersymmetry, and could not hold quarks or leptons. One suggestion was to replace the compact dimensions with the 7-sphere, with the symmetry group SO(8), or the squashed 7-sphere, with symmetry group SO(5) times SU(2). * Until recently, the physical neutrinos seen in experiments were believed to be massless, and appeared to be left-handed, a phenomenon referred to as the chirality of the Standard Model. It was very difficult to construct a chiral fermion from a compactification ‚Äî the compactified manifold needed to have singularities, but physics near singularities did not begin to be understood until the advent of orbifold conformal field theories in the late 1980s. * Supergravity models generically result in an unrealistically large cosmological constant in four dimensions, and that constant is difficult to remove, and so require fine- tuning. This is still a problem today. * Quantization of the theory led to quantum field theory gauge anomalies rendering the theory inconsistent. In the intervening years physicists have learned how to cancel these anomalies. Some of these difficulties could be avoided by moving to a 10-dimensional theory involving superstrings. However, by moving to 10 dimensions one loses the sense of uniqueness of the 11-dimensional theory. The core breakthrough for the 10-dimensional theory, known as the first superstring revolution, was a demonstration by Michael B. Green, John H. Schwarz and David Gross that there are only three supergravity models in 10 dimensions which have gauge symmetries and in which all of the gauge and gravitational anomalies cancel. These were theories built on the groups SO(32) and E_8 \\\\times E_8, the direct product of two copies of E8. Today we know that, using D-branes for example, gauge symmetries can be introduced in other 10-dimensional theories as well. The second superstring revolution Initial excitement about the 10-dimensional theories, and the string theories that provide their quantum completion, died by the end of the 1980s. There were too many Calabi‚ÄìYaus to compactify on, many more than Yau had estimated, as he admitted in December 2005 at the 23rd International Solvay Conference in Physics. None quite gave the standard model, but it seemed as though one could get close with enough effort in many distinct ways. Plus no one understood the theory beyond the regime of applicability of string perturbation theory. There was a comparatively quiet period at the beginning of the 1990s; however, several important tools were developed. For example, it became apparent that the various superstring theories were related by \\"string dualities\\", some of which relate weak string-coupling - perturbative - physics in one model with strong string-coupling - non-perturbative - in another. Then the second superstring revolution occurred. Joseph Polchinski realized that obscure string theory objects, called D-branes, which he discovered six years earlier, equate to stringy versions of the p-branes known in supergravity theories. String theory perturbation didn't restrict these p-branes. Thanks to supersymmetry, p-branes in supergravity gained understanding well beyond the limits of string theory. Armed with this new nonperturbative tool, Edward Witten and many others could show all of the perturbative string theories as descriptions of different states in a single theory that Witten named M-theory. Furthermore, he argued that M-theory's long wavelength limit, i.e. when the quantum wavelength associated to objects in the theory appear much larger than the size of the 11th dimension, need 11-dimensional supergravity descriptors that fell out of favor with the first superstring revolution 10 years earlier, accompanied by the 2- and 5-branes. Therefore, supergravity comes full circle and uses a common framework in understanding features of string theories, M-theory, and their compactifications to lower spacetime dimensions. Relation to superstrings The term \\"low energy limits\\" labels some 10-dimensional supergravity theories. These arise as the massless, tree-level approximation of string theories. True effective field theories of string theories, rather than truncations, are rarely available. Due to string dualities, the conjectured 11-dimensional M-theory is required to have 11-dimensional supergravity as a \\"low energy limit\\". However, this doesn't necessarily mean that string theory/M-theory is the only possible UV completion of supergravity; supergravity research is useful independent of those relations.  4D N = 1 SUGRA  Before we move on to SUGRA proper, let's recapitulate some important details about general relativity. We have a 4D differentiable manifold M with a Spin(3,1) principal bundle over it. This principal bundle represents the local Lorentz symmetry. In addition, we have a vector bundle T over the manifold with the fiber having four real dimensions and transforming as a vector under Spin(3,1). We have an invertible linear map from the tangent bundle TM to T. This map is the vierbein. The local Lorentz symmetry has a gauge connection associated with it, the spin connection. The following discussion will be in superspace notation, as opposed to the component notation, which isn't manifestly covariant under SUSY. There are actually many different versions of SUGRA out there which are inequivalent in the sense that their actions and constraints upon the torsion tensor are different, but ultimately equivalent in that we can always perform a field redefinition of the supervierbeins and spin connection to get from one version to another. In 4D N=1 SUGRA, we have a 44 real differentiable supermanifold M, i.e. we have 4 real bosonic dimensions and 4 real fermionic dimensions. As in the nonsupersymmetric case, we have a Spin(3,1) principal bundle over M. We have an R44 vector bundle T over M. The fiber of T transforms under the local Lorentz group as follows; the four real bosonic dimensions transform as a vector and the four real fermionic dimensions transform as a Majorana spinor. This Majorana spinor can be reexpressed as a complex left-handed Weyl spinor and its complex conjugate right-handed Weyl spinor (they're not independent of each other). We also have a spin connection as before. We will use the following conventions; the spatial (both bosonic and fermionic) indices will be indicated by M, N, ... . The bosonic spatial indices will be indicated by Œº, ŒΩ, ..., the left-handed Weyl spatial indices by Œ±, Œ≤,..., and the right- handed Weyl spatial indices by \\\\dot{\\\\alpha}, \\\\dot{\\\\beta}, ... . The indices for the fiber of T will follow a similar notation, except that they will be hatted like this: \\\\hat{M},\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}. See van der Waerden notation for more details. M = (\\\\mu,\\\\alpha,\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}). The supervierbein is denoted by e^{\\\\hat{M}}_N, and the spin connection by \\\\omega_{\\\\hat{M}\\\\hat{N}P}. The inverse supervierbein is denoted by E^N_{\\\\hat{M}}. The supervierbein and spin connection are real in the sense that they satisfy the reality conditions :e^{\\\\hat{M}}_N (x,\\\\overline{\\\\theta},\\\\theta)^* = e^{\\\\hat{M}^*}_{N^*}(x,\\\\theta,\\\\overline{\\\\theta}) where \\\\mu^*=\\\\mu, \\\\alpha^*=\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}, and \\\\dot{\\\\alpha}^*=\\\\alpha and \\\\omega(x,\\\\overline{\\\\theta},\\\\theta)^*=\\\\omega(x,\\\\theta,\\\\overline{\\\\theta}). The covariant derivative is defined as :D_\\\\hat{M}f=E^N_{\\\\hat{M}}\\\\left( \\\\partial_N f + \\\\omega_N[f] \\\\right). The covariant exterior derivative as defined over supermanifolds needs to be super graded. This means that every time we interchange two fermionic indices, we pick up a +1 sign factor, instead of -1. The presence or absence of R symmetries is optional, but if R-symmetry exists, the integrand over the full superspace has to have an R-charge of 0 and the integrand over chiral superspace has to have an R-charge of 2. A chiral superfield X is a superfield which satisfies \\\\overline{D}_{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}}X=0. In order for this constraint to be consistent, we require the integrability conditions that \\\\left{ \\\\overline{D}_{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}}, \\\\overline{D}_{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\beta}}} \\\\right} = c_{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\beta}}}^{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}}} \\\\overline{D}_{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\gamma}}} for some coefficients c. Unlike nonSUSY GR, the torsion has to be nonzero, at least with respect to the fermionic directions. Already, even in flat superspace, D_{\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}}e_{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}}+\\\\overline{D}_{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}}e_{\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}} eq 0. In one version of SUGRA (but certainly not the only one), we have the following constraints upon the torsion tensor: :T^{\\\\hat{\\\\underline{\\\\gamma}}}_{\\\\hat{\\\\underline{\\\\alpha}}\\\\hat{\\\\underline{\\\\beta}}} = 0 :T^{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}}_{\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}\\\\hat{\\\\beta}} = 0 :T^{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}}_{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\beta}}} = 0 :T^{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}}_{\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\beta}}} = 2i\\\\sigma^{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}}_{\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\beta}}} :T^{\\\\hat{ u}}_{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}\\\\hat{\\\\underline{\\\\alpha}}} = 0 :T^{\\\\hat{\\\\rho}}_{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}\\\\hat{ u}} = 0 Here, \\\\underline{\\\\alpha} is a shorthand notation to mean the index runs over either the left or right Weyl spinors. The superdeterminant of the supervierbein, \\\\left e \\\\right, gives us the volume factor for M. Equivalently, we have the volume 44-superforme^{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}=0}\\\\wedge \\\\cdots \\\\wedge e^{\\\\hat{\\\\mu}=3} \\\\wedge e^{\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}=1} \\\\wedge e^{\\\\hat{\\\\alpha}=2} \\\\wedge e^{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}=1} \\\\wedge e^{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}=2}. If we complexify the superdiffeomorphisms, there is a gauge where E^{\\\\mu}_{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}}=0, E^{\\\\beta}_{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}}=0 and E^{\\\\dot{\\\\beta}}_{\\\\hat{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}}=\\\\delta^{\\\\dot{\\\\beta}}_{\\\\dot{\\\\alpha}}. The resulting chiral superspace has the coordinates x and Œò. R is a scalar valued chiral superfield derivable from the supervielbeins and spin connection. If f is any superfield, \\\\left( \\\\bar{D}^2 - 8R \\\\right) f is always a chiral superfield. The action for a SUGRA theory with chiral superfields X, is given by :S = \\\\int d^4x d^2\\\\Theta 2\\\\mathcal{E}\\\\left[ \\\\frac{3}{8} \\\\left( \\\\bar{D}^2 - 8R \\\\right) e^{-K(\\\\bar{X},X)/3} + W(X) \\\\right] + c.c. where K is the K√§hler potential and W is the superpotential, and \\\\mathcal{E} is the chiral volume factor. Unlike the case for flat superspace, adding a constant to either the K√§hler or superpotential is now physical. A constant shift to the K√§hler potential changes the effective Planck constant, while a constant shift to the superpotential changes the effective cosmological constant. As the effective Planck constant now depends upon the value of the chiral superfield X, we need to rescale the supervierbeins (a field redefinition) to get a constant Planck constant. This is called the Einstein frame.  N = 8 supergravity in 4 dimensions  N=8 Supergravity is the most symmetric quantum field theory which involves gravity and a finite number of fields. It can be found from a dimensional reduction of 11D supergravity by making the size of 7 of the dimensions go to zero. It has 8 supersymmetries which is the most any gravitational theory can have since there are 8 half-steps between spin 2 and spin -2. (A graviton has the highest spin in this theory which is a spin 2 particle). More supersymmetries would mean the particles would have superpartners with spins higher than 2. The only theories with spins higher than 2 which are consistent involve an infinite number of particles (such as string theory and higher-spin theories). Stephen Hawking in his A Brief History of Time speculated that this theory could be the Theory of Everything. However, in later years this was abandoned in favour of string theory. There has been renewed interest in the 21st century with the possibility that this theory may be finite.  Higher-dimensional SUGRA  Higher-dimensional SUGRA is the higher-dimensional, supersymmetric generalization of general relativity. Supergravity can be formulated in any number of dimensions up to eleven. Higher-dimensional SUGRA focuses upon supergravity in greater than four dimensions. The number of supercharges in a spinor depends on the dimension and the signature of spacetime. The supercharges occur in spinors. Thus the limit on the number of supercharges cannot be satisfied in a spacetime of arbitrary dimension. Some theoretical examples in which this is satisfied are: * 12-dimensional two-time theory * 11-dimensional maximal SUGRA * 10-dimensional SUGRA theories ** Type IIA SUGRA: N = (1, 1) ** IIA SUGRA from 11d SUGRA ** Type IIB SUGRA: N = (2, 0) ** Type I gauged SUGRA: N = (1, 0) * 9d SUGRA theories ** Maximal 9d SUGRA from 10d ** T-duality ** N = 1 Gauged SUGRA The supergravity theories that have attracted the most interest contain no spins higher than two. This means, in particular, that they do not contain any fields that transform as symmetric tensors of rank higher than two under Lorentz transformations. The consistency of interacting higher spin field theories is, however, presently a field of very active interest.

He served as Governor- General of India from 1848 to 1856. He is credited with introducing passenger trains in railways, electric telegraph and uniform postage in India which he described as the \\"three great engines of social improvement\\". He also founded the Public Works Department in India. To his supporters he stands out as the far-sighted Governor-General who consolidated East India Company rule in India, laid the foundations of its later administration, and by his sound policy enabled his successors to stem the tide of rebellion. His period of rule in India directly preceded the transformation into the Victorian Raj period of Indian administration. He was denounced by many in Britain on the eve of his death as having failed to notice the signs of the brewing Indian Rebellion of 1857, having aggravated the crisis by his overbearing self- confidence, centralizing activity and expansive annexations. Early life James Andrew Broun-Ramsay was the third and youngest son of George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie (1770‚Äì1838), one of Wellington's generals, who, after being Governor General of Canada, became Commander-in-Chief in India, and of his wife, Christian (n√©e Broun) of Coalstoun, Haddingtonshire (East Lothian). The 9th Earl was in 1815 created Baron Dalhousie of Dalhousie Castle in the Peerage of the United Kingdom,Lee-Warner, Sir William, The Life of the Marquess of Dalhousie, London, 1904, vol.1: 3 and had three sons, of whom the two elder died young. James Andrew Broun-Ramsay, his youngest son, was described as small in stature, with a firm chiseled mouth and high forehead. Several years of his early boyhood were spent with his father and mother in Canada. Returning to Scotland he was prepared for Harrow School, where he entered in 1825. Two years later he and another student, Robert Adair, were expelled after bullying George Rushout, nephew of John Rushout, 2nd Baron Northwick. The two boys repeatedly dunked Rushout in water for 30 minutes, leaving him seriously ill. He nearly died, thanks to lackluster medical response from the school, whose headmaster initially claimed his illness was blamed on constipation. His uncle intervened, and the two boys were forced to leave school. George Rushout also did not return, until 33 years later when, having succeeded his uncle as the 3rd Baron Northwick, he became a governor. Until he entered university, Dalhousie's entire education being entrusted to the Rev. Mr Temple, incumbent of a quiet parish in Staffordshire. In October 1829, he passed on to Christ Church, Oxford, where he worked fairly hard, won some distinction, and made many lifelong friends. His studies, however, were so greatly interrupted by the protracted illness and death in 1832 of his only surviving brother, that Lord Ramsay, as he then became, had to content himself with entering for a pass degree, though he was placed in fourth class of honours for Michaelmas 1833. He then travelled in Italy and Switzerland, enriching with copious entries the diary which he religiously kept up through life, and storing his mind with valuable observations. Early political career Susan, Marchioness of Dalhousie An unsuccessful but courageous contest at the general election in 1835 for one of the seats in parliament for Edinburgh, fought against such veterans as the future speaker, James Abercrombie, afterwards Lord Dunfermline, and John Campbell, future lord chancellor, was followed in 1837 by Ramsay's return to the House of Commons as member for Haddingtonshire. In the previous year he had married Lady Susan Hay, daughter of the Marquess of Tweeddale, whose companionship was his chief support in India, and whose death in 1853 left him a heartbroken man. In 1838 his father had died after a long illness, while less than a year later he lost his mother. Succeeding to the peerage, the new earl soon made his mark in a speech delivered on 16 June 1840 in support of Lord Aberdeen's Church of Scotland Benefices Bill, a controversy arising out of the Auchterarder case, in which he had already taken part in the General Assembly in opposition to Dr Chalmers. In May 1843 he became Vice-President of the Board of Trade, Gladstone being President, and was sworn in as a privy counsellor. He was also given the honorary post of Captain of Deal Castle the same year. Succeeding Gladstone as President of the Board of Trade in 1845, he threw himself into the work during the crisis of the Railway Mania with such energy that his health partially broke down under the strain. In the struggle over the Corn Laws he ranged himself on the side of Sir Robert Peel, and, after the failure of Lord John Russell to form a ministry he resumed his post at the board of trade, entering the cabinet on the retirement of Lord Stanley. When Peel resigned office in June 1846, Lord John offered Dalhousie a seat in the cabinet, an offer which he declined from a fear that acceptance might involve the loss of public character. Another attempt to secure his politics. India As Governor-General of India and Governor of Bengal on 12 January 1848, and shortly afterwards he was honoured with the green ribbon of the Order of the Thistle. During this period, he was said to be an extremely hard worker, often working sixteen to eighteen hours a day. The shortest workday Dalhousie would take began at half-past eight and would continue until half- past five, remaining at his desk even during lunch.Christopher Hibbert, The Great Mutiny: India 1857 (New York, NY: The Viking Press, 1978), p. 25 During this period, he sought to expand the reach of the empire and ride long distances on horseback, in spite of having a bad back.D. R. SarDesai, India: The Definitive History (Los Angeles: Westview Press, 2008), p. 238. In contrast to many of the past leaders of the British Empire in India, he saw himself as an Orientalist monarch and believed his rule was that of a modernizer, attempting to bring the British intellectual revolution to India. A staunch utilitarian, he sought to improve Indian society under the prevalent Benthamite ideals of the period. However, in his attempt to do so he ruled with authoritarianism, believing these means were the most likely to increase the material development and progress of India. His policies, especially the doctrine of lapse, contributed to a growing sense of discontent among sectors of Indian society and therefore greatly contributed to the Great Indian Uprising of 1857, which directly followed his departure from India.Ghosh, Suresh Chandra. \\"The Utilitarianism of Dalhousie and the Material Improvement of India.\\" Modern Asian Studies; Vol. 12 no. 1 (1978), 97-110. https://www.jstor.org/stable/311824 In 1849, under Dalhousie's command, the British captured the princely state of Punjab. He also commanded the Second Burmese War in 1852, resulting in the capture of parts of Burma. Under his reign, the British implemented the policy of 'lapse and annexation' which ensured that if a king did not have any sons for a natural heir, the kingdom would be annexed to the British Empire. Using this policy, the British annexed some of the princely states. The annexation of Awadh made Dalhousie very unpopular in the region. This and other callous actions of the governor- general created bitter feelings among the Indian soldiers in the British Army, which finally led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Dalhousie and the British called this uprising the 'Sepoy mutiny' - Sepoy being the common term for native Indian soldiers in British service. Dalhousie was an able administrator, though forceful and tough. His contribution in the development of communication ‚Äî railways, roads, postal and telegraph services ‚Äî contributed to the modernization and unity of India. His notable achievement was the creation of modern, centralized states Shortly after assuming his duties, in writing to the president of the Board of Control, Sir John Hobhouse, he was able to assure him that everything was quiet. This statement, however, was to be falsified by events almost before it could reach Britain. Second Anglo-Sikh War On 19 April 1848 Vans Agnew of the civil service and Lieutenant Anderson of the Bombay European regiment, having been sent to take charge of Multan from Diwan Mulraj, were murdered there, and within a short time the troops and sardars joined in open rebellion. Dalhousie agreed with Sir Hugh Gough, the commander-in-chief, that the British East India Company's military forces were neither adequately equipped with transport and supplies, nor otherwise prepared to take the field immediately. He afterward decided that the proper response was not merely for the capture of Multan, but also the entire subjugation of the Punjab. He therefore resolutely delayed to strike, organized a strong army for operations in November, and himself proceeded to the Punjab. With evidence that the revolt was spreading outwards, Dalhousie declared, \\"Unwarned by precedent, uninfluenced by example, the Sikh nation has called for war; and on my words, sirs, war they shall have and with a vengeance.\\"James, Lawrence. Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India (New York, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), 115 Despite the successes gained by Herbert Edwardes in the Second Anglo-Sikh War with Mulraj, and Gough's indecisive victories at Ramnagar in November, at Sadulpur in December, and at Chillianwala in the following month, the stubborn resistance at Multan showed that the task required the utmost resources of the government. At length, on 22 January 1849, the Multan fortress was taken by General Whish, who was thus set at liberty to join Gough at Gujarat. Here a complete victory was won on 21 February at the Battle of Gujrat, the Sikh army surrendered at Rawalpindi, and their Afghan allies were chased out of India. In spite of substantial attempts by Sikh and Muslim forces to polarize opposition through religious and anti- British sentiment, Dalhousie's military commanders were able to maintain the loyalty of troops, with the exception of a small number of Gurkah deserters.James, Lawrence. Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India (New York, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), 116 For his services the Earl of Dalhousie received the thanks of the Parliament and a step in the peerage, as Marquess. The war being now over, Dalhousie, without specific instructions from his superiors, annexed the Punjab. Believing in inherent superiority of British rule over the \\"archaic\\" Indian system of rule, Dalhousie attempted to dismantle local rule, fulfilling the imperial goals of the Anglicizer Lord Bentinck. However, the province quickly became ruled by a group of \\"audacious, eccentric, and often Evangelical pioneers\\".Gilmour, David. The Ruling Caste: Imperial Lives in the Victorian Raj New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005, 161 In an attempt to minimize further conflict, he removed a number of these officials, establishing what he believed to be a more logical and rational system in which the Punjab was systematically divided into districts and divisions, governed by District officers and Commissioners respectively. This lasting system of rule established governance through a young maharaja under a triumvirate of the Governor General. Governance under the established \\"Punjab School\\" of Henry and John Lawrence was initially successful, partially due to the system of local cultural respect, while still maintaining British values against acts of widow burning, female infanticide, and burning of lepers alive by small segments of the Indian populace.Gilmour, 163. However, Punjabi rule eventually came to be seen as despotic, largely because of the expansion of judicial system. Although often unpredictable or despotic, many Indians in \\"rationalized\\" provinces preferred their previous native rule. Second Burmese War One further addition to the empire was made by conquest. The Burmese court at Ava was bound by the Treaty of Yandaboo, 1826, to protect British ships in Burmese waters. But there arose a dispute between the Governor of Rangoon and certain British shipping interests (the Monarch and the Champion). The facts of the event were obscured by conflicts between colonial administrators reporting to the admirals of the navy, rather than the company or civil authorities. The nature of the dispute was mis-represented to Parliament, and Parliament played a role in further \\"suppressing\\" the facts released to the public, but most of the facts were established by comparative reading of these conflicting accounts in what was originally an anonymous pamphlet, How Wars are Got Up in India; this account by Richard Cobden remains almost the sole contemporaneous account of who actually made the decision to invade and annex Burma.This text went through several \\"editions\\" rapidly, with the third edition already in print in 1853 (this was subsequently reprinted in The Political Writings of Richard Cobden, vol. 2). The full text is now available as a book digitized by Google: In defending the pretext for invasion after the fact, Dalhousie quoted the maxim of Lord Wellesley that any insult offered to the British flag at the mouth of the Ganges should be resented as promptly and fully as an insult offered at the mouth of the Thames. Attempts were made to solve the dispute by diplomacy. The Burmese eventually removed the Governor of Rangoon but this not considered sufficient. Commodore Lambert, despatched personally by Dalhousie, deliberately provoked an incident and then announced a war. The Burmese Kingdom offered little in the way of resistance. Martaban was taken on 5 April 1852, and Rangoon and Bassein shortly afterwards. Since, however, the court of Ava was unwilling to surrender half the country in the name of \\"peace\\", the second campaign opened in October, and after the capture of Prome and Pegu the annexation of the province of Pegu was declared by a proclamation dated 20 December 1853. To any further invasion of the Burmese empire Dalhousie was firmly opposed, being content to cut off Burma's commercial and political access to the outside world by the annexation. Some strangely spoke of the war as \\"uniting\\" territory, but in practice Arakan, Tenasserim and the new territories were still only linked in practical terms by sea. By what his supporters considered wise policy he attempted to pacify the new province, placing Colonel Arthur Phayre in sole charge of it, personally visiting it, and establishing a system of telegraphs and communications. In practice, the new province was in language and culture very different from India. It could never successfully integrate into the Indian system. The end result of the war was to add an expensive new military and political dependency which did not generate sufficient taxes to pay for itself. British Indian rule of Arakan and Tenasserim had been a financial disaster for the Indian Administration. Multiple times in the 1830s questions were raised about getting rid of these territories altogether. Why Dalhousie was so obsessed with increasing the size of a territory that did not generate sufficient revenue to pay for its own administration has never been explained. One consequential factor of this war was Dalhousie's continuation of the requirement that Sepoys be forced to serve abroad. This created great discontent among Indian sepoys, because it violated the Hindu religious prohibition against travel. In fact, this resulted in the mutiny of several regiments in the Punjab.Vohra, Ranbir. The Making of India: A Historical Survey. Armonk: M.E. Sharpe, 1997, 79. When this belief that the British were intentionally forcing caste breaking was combined with the widespread belief that the British were intentionally violating Hindu and Muslim purity laws with their new greased cartridges, the consequences (culminating in 1857), would prove to be extremely destructive.Hibbert, 61. Policies of reformsDoctrine of Lapse= Portrait of Lord Dalhousie by John Watson-Gordon, 1847. The most controversial and tainted 'reform' developed and implemented under Dalhousie was the policy of taking all legal (often illegal too) means possible to assume control over \\"lapsed\\" states. Dalhousie, driven by the conviction that all India needed to be brought under British administration, began to apply what was called the doctrine of lapse. Under the doctrine, the British annexed any non-British state where there was a lack of a proper male lineal heir. Under the policy he recommended the annexation of Satara in January 1849, of Jaitpur and Sambalpur in the same year, and of Jhansi and Nagpur in 1853. In these cases his action was approved by the home authorities, but his proposal to annex Karauli in 1849 was disallowed, while Baghat and the petty estate of Udaipur, which he had annexed in 1851 and 1852 respectively, were afterwards restored to native rule. These annexations are considered by critics to generally represent an uneconomic drain on the financial resources of the company in India. =Social reforms= Dalhousie declared that no single change was likely to produce more important and beneficial consequences than female education. The Educational dispatch of 1854 favored Women's education. There was shift in government policy under him from higher education for elite towards mass education for both . He along with Bethune are credited with changing policy in favour of Women's education. Dalhousie even personally supported the Bethune Women school from his own money set up by Bethune after his death. Before he left for England he took personal interest and introduced the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856, permitting widow remarriage which became an act after being approved by his successor, Lord Canning . =Development of infrastructure= Other measures with the same object were carried out in the Company's own territories. Bengal, long ruled by the Governor-General or his delegate, was placed under its own Lieutenant-Governor in May 1854. The military boards were swept away; selection took the place of seniority in the higher commands; an army clothing and a stud department were created, and the medical service underwent complete reorganization. A department of public works was established in each presidency, and engineering colleges were provided. An imperial system of telegraphs followed. The first link of railway communication was completed in 1855, and well-considered plans mapped out the course of other lines and their method of administration. Dalhousie encouraged private enterprise to develop railways in India for the good of the people and also to reduce absolute dependence on the government. However, as an authoritarian, utilitarian ruler, Dalhousie brought the railways under state control-attempting to bring the greatest benefit to India from the expanding network. In addition, the Ganges Canal was completed; and despite the cost of wars in the Punjab and Burma, liberal provision was made for metalled roads and bridges.Digital South Asia Library. Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 2. University of Chicago. http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/text.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V02_539.gif (accessed 14 April 2009). The construction of massive irrigation works such as the 350-mile Ganges Canal, which contains thousands of miles of distributaries was a substantial project that was particularly beneficial for the largely agricultural India. In spite of damaging certain areas of farmland by increasing soil salinity, overall the individuals living along the canal were noticeably better fed and clothed than those who were not.Gilmour, 9. Increasing irrigated area resulted in increase in population. Reforms to improve the condition of the increased population such as immunization and establishment of educational institutions were never implemented. This kept the population poor and bonded to agricultural activities promoting bonded labour. Europeanization and consolidation of authority were the keynote of his policy. In nine minutes he suggested means for strengthening the Company's European forces, calling attention to the dangers that threatened the British community, a handful of scattered strangers; but beyond the additional powers of recruitment which at his entreaty were granted in the last charter act of 1853, his proposals were shelved by the home authorities as they represented yet more expense added to the cost of India. In his administration Dalhousie vigorously asserted his control over even minor military affairs, and when Sir Charles Napier ordered certain allowances, given as compensation for the dearness of provisions, to be granted to the sepoys on a system which had not been sanctioned from headquarters, and threatened to repeat the offence, the Governor-General rebuked him to such a degree that Napier resigned his command. Dalhousie's reforms were not confined to the departments of public works and military affairs. He created an imperial system of post-offices, reducing the rates of carrying letters and introducing postage stamps. He created the department of public instruction; he improved the system of inspection of goals, abolishing the practice of branding convicts; freed converts to other religions from the loss of their civil rights; inaugurated the system of administrative reports; and enlarged the Legislative Council of India. His wide interest in everything that concerned the welfare of British economic interests in the country was shown in the encouragement he gave to the culture of tea, in his protection of forests, in the preservation of ancient and historic monuments. With the object of making the civil administration more European, he closed what he considered to be the useless college in Calcutta for the education of young civilians, establishing in its place a European system of training them in mufasal stations, and subjecting them to departmental examinations. He was equally careful of the well-being of the European soldier, providing him with healthy recreations and public gardens. =Civil Service reform= To the civil service he gave improved leave and pension rules, while he purified its moral by forbidding all share in trading concerns, by vigorously punishing insolvents, and by his personal example of careful selection in the matter of patronage. No Governor-General ever penned a larger number of weighty papers dealing with public affairs in India. Even after laying down office and while on his way home, he forced himself, ill as he was, to review his own administration in a document of such importance that the House of Commons gave orders for its being printed (Blue Book 245 of 1856). Another consequential set of reforms, were those aimed at modernizing the land tenure and revenue system. Throughout his time in office, Dalhousie disposed large landowners from portions of their estates. He also implemented policies attempting to end the rule of the zamindar tax farmers, as he viewed them as destructive \\"drones of the soil\\".Brendon, Piers. The Decline and Fall of the British Empire: 1781‚Äì1997. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008. However, thousands of smaller landlords had their holdings completely removed as did the relatively poor who leased small parcels of their land while farming the rest. This was particularly significant as the sepoys were often recruited from these economic groups.Hibbert, 49. He introduced a system of open competition as the basis of recruitment for civil servants of the company and thus deprived the Directors of their patronage system under Government of India Act 1853.M. Lakshmikanth, Public Administration, TMH, Tenth Reprint, 2013 Foreign policy His foreign policy was guided by a desire to reduce the nominal independence of the larger native states, and to avoid extending the political relations of his government with foreign powers outside India. Pressed to intervene in Hyderabad, he refused to do so, claiming on this occasion that interference was only justified if the administration of native princes tends unquestionably to the injury of the subjects or of the allies of the British government. He negotiated in 1853 a treaty with the nizam, which provided funds for the maintenance of the contingent kept up by the British in support of that princes' authority, by the assignment of the Berars in lieu of annual payments of the cost and large outstanding arrears. The Berar treaty, he told Sir Charles Wood, is more likely to keep the nizam on his throne than anything that has happened for 50 years to him, while at the same time the control thus acquired over a strip of territory intervening between Bombay and Nagpur promoted his policy of consolidation and his schemes of railway extension. The same spirit induced him to tolerate a war of succession in Bahawalpur, so long as the contending candidates did not violate British territory. He refrained from punishing Dost Mohammad for the part he had taken in the Sikh War, and resolutely to refuse to enter upon any negotiations until the amir himself came forward. Then he steered a middle course between the proposals of his own agent, Herbert Edwardes, who advocated an offensive alliance, and those of John Lawrence, who would have avoided any sort of engagement. He himself drafted the short treaty of peace and friendship which Lawrence signed in 1855, that officer receiving in 1856 the Order of the Bath as a Knight Commander in acknowledgement of his services in the matter. While, however, Dalhousie was content with a mutual engagement with the Afghan chief, binding each party to respect the territories of the other, he saw that a larger measure of interference was needed in Baluchistan, and with the Khan of Kalat he authorized Major Jacob to negotiate a treaty of subordinate co-operation on 14 May 1854. The khan was guaranteed an annual subsidy of Rs. 50,000, in return for the treaty which bound him to the British wholly and exclusively. To this the home authorities demurred, but the engagement was duly ratified, and the subsidy was largely increased by Dalhousies successors. On the other hand, he insisted on leaving all matters concerning Persia and Central Asia to the decision of the queen's advisers. After the conquest of the Punjab, he began the expensive process of attempting to police and control the Northwest Frontier region. The hillmen, he wrote, regard the plains as their food and prey, and the Afridis, Mohmands, Black Mountain tribes, Waziris and others had to be taught that their new neighbours would not tolerate outrages. But he proclaimed to one and all his desire for peace, and urged upon them the duty of tribal responsibility. Nevertheless, the military engagement on the northwest frontier of India he began grew yearly in cost and continued without pause until the British left Pakistan. The annexation of Oudh was reserved to the last. The home authorities had asked Dalhousie to prolong his tenure of office during the Crimean War, but the difficulties of the problem no less than complications elsewhere had induced him to delay operations. In 1854 he appointed Outram as resident at the court of Lucknow, directing him to submit a report on the condition of the province. This was furnished in March 1855. The report provided the British an excuse for action based on \\"disorder and misrule\\". Dalhousie, looking at the treaty of 1801, decided that he could do as he wished with Oudh as long as he had the king's consent. He then demanded a transfer to the Company of the entire administration of Oudh, the king merely retaining his royal rank, certain privileges in the courts, and a liberal allowance. If he should refuse this arrangement, a general rising would be arranged, and then the British government would intervene on its own terms. On 21 November 1855, the court of directors instructed Dalhousie to assume the control of Oudh, and to give the king no option unless he was sure that his majesty would surrender the administration rather than risk a revolution. Dalhousie was in bad health and on the eve of retirement when the belated orders reached him; but he at once laid down instructions for Outram in every detail, moved up troops, and elaborated a scheme of government with particular orders as to conciliating local opinion. The king refused to sign the ultimatum (in the form of a \\"treaty\\") put before him, and a proclamation annexing the province was therefore issued on 13 February 1856. In his mind, only one important matter now remained to him before quitting office. The insurrection of the Kolarian Santals of Bengal against the extortions of landlords and moneylenders had been severely repressed, but the causes of the insurrection had still to be reviewed and a remedy provided. By removing the tract of country from local rule, enforcing the residence of British officers there, and employing the Santal headmen in a local police, he created a system of administration which proved successful in maintaining order. Return to Britain A length, after seven years of strenuous labour, Dalhousie, on the 6th of March 1856, set sail for England on board the Company's \\" Firoze,\\" an object of general sympathy and not less general respect. At Alexandria he was carried by H.M.S. \\" Caradoc \\" to Malta, and thence by the \\" Tribune \\" to Spithead, which he reached on the 13th of May. His return had been eagerly looked for by statesmen who hoped that he would resume his public career, by the Company which voted him an annual pension of ¬£5,000 (¬£1.5 million in 2009), and by the queen who earnestly prayed for the blessing of restored health and strength; conversely, the outbreak of the \\"Sepoy Mutiny\\" led to bitter attacks on the record of his policy, and to widespread criticisms (both fair and unfair) of his political interests and career. His health deteriorated in Malta and at Malvern, Edinburgh, where he sought medical treatment. In his correspondence and public statements, he was careful not to assign blame or cause embarrassment to colleagues in government. During this period, John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence invoked his counsel and influence. By his last wish, his private journal and papers of personal interest were sealed against publication or inquiry for fully 50 years after his death. Established in 1854 by the British Empire in India as a summer retreat for its troops and bureaucrats, the hill station of Dalhousie was named after Lord Dalhousie who was Governor-General of India at that time.

The list contains an ordered list of reel and timecode data representing where each video clip can be obtained in order to conform the final cut. EDLs are created by offline editing systems, or can be paper documents constructed by hand such as shot logging. These days, linear video editing systems have been superseded by non-linear editing (NLE) systems which can output EDLs electronically to allow autoconform on an online editing system ‚Äì the recreation of an edited programme from the original sources (usually video tapes) and the editing decisions in the EDL. They are also often used in the digital video editing world, so rather than referring to reels they can refer to sequences of images stored on disk. Some formats, such as CMX3600, can represent simple editing decisions only. Final Cut Pro XML, the Advanced Authoring Format (AAF), and AviSynth scripts are relatively advanced file formats that can contain sophisticated EDLs.  B-Roll  Linear editing systems cannot dissolve between clips on the same video tape. Hence, one of these clips will need to be dubbed onto a new video tape. EDLs designate these occurrences by marking such dissolves' source reels as B-roll of \\"b-reels\\". For example, the EDL will change the 8th character of the reel name to the letter B. However, sometimes editors will (confusingly) use the letter B to designate time code breaks on a video tape. If there is broken time code on a video tape, there will be two (or more) instances of a particular time code on the video tape. When re-capturing, it can be ambiguous as to which timecode is the right one. The letter B may indicate that the right time code is from the second set of timecode on the video tape. Incompatibilities and potential problems EDL formats such as CMX, GVG, Sony, Final Cut Pro, and Avid are similar but can differ in small (but important) ways. Particular attention should be paid to reel naming convention. On the Avid, reel names can be up to 32 characters, but user should be aware that these EDLs don't adhere to online editing machine control specifications. These are used by systems that have modified the import/export code to handle file-based workflows as tape acquisition formats wane. On FCP, in CMX3600 format, only eight characters are allowed. Particular attention should be paid towards b-reels. If the EDL handles dissolves to the same reel, reel names should be limited to 7 characters since the 8th character may be replaced. EDLs can use either drop-frame (DF) or non drop-frame timecode (NDF), running at 24fps (non drop-frame only), 25fps (non drop-frame only), and 30fps (drop-frame and non drop-frame).

The scorzonera sweet is a crystallized dessert made from scorzonera in √âvora, Alentejo, Portugal. It is listed on the Ark of Taste.Scorzonera sweet Slow Food Foundation Description The black salsify plant has heads of yellow ray flowers. The thin black taproot grows up to one meter long and up to in diameter. It has a black skin with white internal flesh. History Black salsify is native to Southern Europe and the Near East. As is indicated by its binomial name, it is generally thought to have spread to the rest of Europe from Spain, but the first mention of the vegetable by a Western writer came from Leonhard Rudolf, who reported seeing scorzonera at the market of Aleppo in Syria, in 1575. It is often claimed that the name of the genus Scorzonera derives from the Old French word scorzon meaning snake (or \\"adder\\" to be exact), which seems likely given a widespread belief that the plant makes a good antidote against bites of venomous snakes. Alternatively, the name could be derived from the Italian \\"scorza negra\\" meaning \\"black bark\\"/\\"black peel\\" and indicating the dark brown to black skin of the root. The Celtic and Germanic peoples are believed to have eaten the black salsify, which was considered efficacious against the bubonic plague and snake bites until the 16th century. The plant was being cultivated as a vegetable in Italy and France by 1660 and, soon after, vast fields were grown of it in what is now Belgium. Food value The black salsify is considered nutritious: it contains proteins, fats, asparagine, choline, laevulin, as well as minerals such as potassium, calcium, phosphorus, iron, sodium, and vitamins A, B1, E and C. It also contains the polysaccharide inulin, conferring a mild sweetness that is suitable for diabetics . Black salsify roots Preparation The thick black skin of the salsify root is usually considered inedible and can be removed either prior to or after boiling. If the skin is removed prior to boiling, the peeled root should be immediately immersed in water mixed with vinegar or lemon juice, in order to prevent discolouring. Since the root contains an extremely sticky latex, it is often more convenient to peel it after boiling the root for 20 to 25 minutes (or less). Residue of the latex can be removed by rubbing with a drop of oil and then washing with soap. Black salsify is often eaten together with other vegetables, such as peas and carrots. But it is also popular served like asparagus in a white sauce, such as bechamel sauce, mustard sauce or hollandaise sauce. Boiled salsify roots may also be coated with batter and deep fried. Cultivation Commercial production in Germany Black salsify is hitherto mainly a European crop. Belgium, France and the Netherlands are the world's largest producers of black salsify; significant amounts are also produced in Germany. In the latter country, 'Hoffmanns Schwarzer Pfahl' is a cultivar widely used by commercial growers, while 'Duplex' is popular among small-scale gardeners. Some other cultivars are widely available, but because it was rather a localized crop before being produced for a wider market there are comparatively few landraces. Harvesting is somewhat complicated, as the roots are quite fragile, and broken material loses freshness. Entire roots will keep fresh all winter if stored in a cool dark place, due to their robust black corky skin. In root cellars they may keep fresh well into springtime. It is, however, very hardy and will grow well in most cool-temperate climates and usually yield 15‚Äì20 tonnes of roots per hectare. In British gardens it is common to profit from its perennial character by leaving it in the ground until its roots have grown to sufficient size for harvesting; this can take two years. Commercially, it can be grown best as the year's second crop.

In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for a correct formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting. The BFSS matrix model is also considered the worldvolume theory of a large number of D0-branes in Type IIA string theory.BFSS matrix model in nLab Noncommutative geometry In geometry, it is often useful to introduce coordinates. For example, in order to study the geometry of the Euclidean plane, one defines the coordinates and as the distances between any point in the plane and a pair of axes. In ordinary geometry, the coordinates of a point are numbers, so they can be multiplied, and the product of two coordinates does not depend on the order of multiplication. That is, . This property of multiplication is known as the commutative law, and this relationship between geometry and the commutative algebra of coordinates is the starting point for much of modern geometry.Connes 1994, p. 1 Noncommutative geometry is a branch of mathematics that attempts to generalize this situation. Rather than working with ordinary numbers, one considers some similar objects, such as matrices, whose multiplication does not satisfy the commutative law (that is, objects for which is not necessarily equal to ). One imagines that these noncommuting objects are coordinates on some more general notion of \\"space\\" and proves theorems about these generalized spaces by exploiting the analogy with ordinary geometry.Connes 1994 In a paper from 1998, Alain Connes, Michael R. Douglas, and Albert Schwarz showed that some aspects of matrix models and M-theory are described by a noncommutative quantum field theory, a special kind of physical theory in which the coordinates on spacetime do not satisfy the commutativity property.Connes, Douglas, and Schwarz 1998 This established a link between matrix models and M-theory on the one hand, and noncommutative geometry on the other hand. It quickly led to the discovery of other important links between noncommutative geometry and various physical theories.Nekrasov and Schwarz 1998Seiberg and Witten 1999 Related models Another notable matrix model capturing aspects of Type IIB string theory, the IKKT matrix model, was constructed in 1996‚Äì97 by N.

He is the owner of Housecore Records. Anselmo is regarded as one of the greatest frontmen in metal history, known for being particularly animated and donning a machismo attitude that become emblematic of the general theme of Pantera. Earlier in his career with the band, Anselmo took considerable inspiration of heavy metal vocalists such as Rob Halford, singing in full head voice. However, he later became recognized for introducing a more guttural approach to the vocals. Early life Anselmo was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and is of Danish, Additional January 6, 2017. Article title and subtitle Danish, interview English. Italian and French heritage. He attended many schools across Louisiana and Texas, the last of which was Grace King High School located in the suburb of Metairie. Anselmo's father, Phil, owned and operated a restaurant in Metairie called Anselmo's, which closed following Hurricane Katrina due to financial troubles. Anselmo has said in various interviews that he was the class clown as a child. He spent some time working on shrimping boats as a young man. At age 14, Anselmo accidentally started a fire in his parents' house while attempting to prank his sister. The incident resulted in smoke damage to most of the furniture and part of the house needing renovation. Phil worked on a Shrimp Boat with his stepfather in his teenage years, and claims to have witnessed a man be poisoned by a Scorpion Fish. Music career While a teenager, Anselmo joined the band Samhain (not to be confused with Glenn Danzig's band Samhain). From the early to mid-1980s, Anselmo was a member of the band Razor White. While they did have some original material, they played mainly Judas Priest covers. Pantera Pantera released four albums via Metal Magic Records, but did not garner much attention, because the band wasn't signed with a major label record at the time, especially with Terry Glaze at vocals. Seeking a new frontman to continue down a heavier path, Glaze, who was primarily a glam metal vocalist, left the band. In 1987, after several meetings, the 19-year old Anselmo was officially added to the Pantera lineup. The band was so impressed with Anselmo, that they re-recorded some of Glaze's vocals for their latest release. Anselmo relocated to Texas to record Pantera's fourth album, Power Metal, which was released in 1988. Following the release of Power Metal, the band dropped its glam image and adopted a more casual look. In 1990, Pantera released their fifth album, Cowboys from Hell, which paved the way towards the band's stardom. As a tour unfolded to promote the band's latest album, there was documented portions of this tour on their first home video, Cowboys from Hell: The Videos, released in 1991. In 1992, Pantera released their sixth studio album, Vulgar Display of Power. That same year, the band released a promo titled Hostile Mixes that contained four songs, three of which were remixes. The first two remixes were done by Justin K. Broadrick of Godflesh and the last by J. G. Thirlwell of Foetus. In 1994, Pantera released their seventh studio album, Far Beyond Driven, which debuted at No. 1 in the United States. In late June, Anselmo was charged with assault following an altercation with a security guard when fans were prevented from getting on stage. Anselmo was released on $5,000 bail the next day. The trial was delayed three times. In May 1995, he apologized in court, pleaded guilty to attempted assault, and was ordered to undergo 100 hours of community service. In 1996, Pantera released their eighth studio album, The Great Southern Trendkill. Anselmo recorded the vocal tracks for this album in New Orleans, while the other members recorded in Texas, primarily due to growing tensions between Anselmo and the rest of the band. In 1997, Pantera released their first and only official live album titled Official Live: 101 Proof. This album contained the two new tracks, \\"I Can't Hide\\" and \\"Where You Come From\\". In 2000, Pantera released their ninth and final studio album, Reinventing the Steel. After touring to promote the album, Pantera went on hiatus in 2001. In 2003, Pantera released their first compilation album, The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits! (alternatively titled Reinventing Hell: The Best of Pantera in Europe). The album featured songs from five studio albums with Anselmo, and also included three cover tracks, \\"Planet Caravan\\" and \\"Hole in the Sky\\", written by Black Sabbath; and \\"Cat Scratch Fever\\", written by Ted Nugent. A bonus DVD was also made, containing all of the band's music videos. Later that year, Pantera disbanded over communication problems and accusations that Anselmo had neglected the band. Following the disbandment, Anselmo devoted much of his time to a longtime side project, Superjoint Ritual. Having heard of this, the Abbott brothers of Pantera (guitarist Dimebag Darrell and drummer Vinnie Paul) went on to form Damageplan with former Halford guitarist Pat Lachman on vocals and Bob Zilla on bass. Some fans blamed Anselmo for Pantera's disbanding, because of statements in the heavy metal press. Anselmo had accused journalists of twisting the facts, publishing what they think sold best. Pantera bassist Rex Brown, widely known as being the one neutral voice in the matter, blamed both sides for the band's disbandment. After Vinnie Paul slammed Superjoint Ritual, saying Anselmo could not even keep his eyes open, Anselmo responded and replied, \\"I just hear a big and sad yellowbelly crybaby fuckin' knowing that his meal ticket is in a different fuckin' band ... You would have to know those guys to really understand where I was coming from. They're scared of their own fuckin' shadows. And, all that said, I wish them the best of fuckin' luck. I still love 'em.\\" Anselmo had engaged in a war of words with Dimebag since the disbandment of Pantera, culminating in the statement \\"Dimebag deserves to be beaten severely\\" in the December 2004 edition of the UK's Metal Hammer magazine. Initially, he denied making the statement, but later changed his story in a VH1 Behind the Music special on Pantera, claiming that the comment had been lighthearted and made off the record. However, Vinnie Paul told the press that he had heard the audio files of the interview and that Anselmo had not been misquoted. In December 2004, Dimebag Darrell was shot and killed while performing with Damageplan at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio. At the request of Dimebag's family, Anselmo did not attend his funeral. In a lengthy and emotional video posted on Down's official website, Anselmo described his regret over his previous behavior, and has written and recorded music dealing with the loss of Dimebag on the new Down record, Down III: Over the Under. The band dedicated their song \\"Lifer\\" to Dimebag. Anselmo stated that he wished to restart his friendship with Vinnie Paul, but a reconciliation effort would no longer occur due to Paul's untimely death on June 22, 2018. In a July 2015 interview with Rolling Stone, Anselmo spoke out against Pantera and his other band's usage of the Confederate flag, claiming that it was a mistake to use it on their merchandise, albums, and other promotional material. Anselmo said \\"These days, I wouldn't want anything to fucking do with it because truthfully ... I wouldn't. The way I feel and the group of people I've had to work with my whole life, you see a Confederate flag out there that says 'Heritage, not hate.' I'm not so sure I'm buying into that.\\" Anselmo said originally, that Pantera used the image because they were huge fans of Lynyrd Skynyrd, but it was never about promoting hate. Down Anselmo with Down at Gods of Metal in 2009 Down has been Anselmo's main recording and touring band since 2006. Down is an American heavy metal band formed in 1991 in New Orleans, Louisiana. The band consists of members and former members of Pantera, Corrosion of Conformity, Crowbar, and Eyehategod. Since its inception, Down has released three studio albums, two E.P.'s, one live album, and has gone on hiatus twice to focus on the members' respective bands. Superjoint/Superjoint Ritual Anselmo performing with Superjoint Ritual at Ozzfest in 2004 Superjoint Ritual is a New Orleans metal band formed by Anselmo, Joe Fazzio, and Jimmy Bower in the early 1990s, later to be joined by Hank Williams III, and Kevin Bond. Their style can be considered a mix of groove metal and hardcore punk. Bands like Venom, Slayer, Celtic Frost, Voivod, and Darkthrone have also been noted as influences. The name Superjoint Ritual comes from a lyric in the Darkthrone song, \\"The Pagan Winter\\". According to Bower, Anselmo wrote 70-80% of the group's music. During their time together they have released three full-length albums on Sanctuary Records, Use Once and Destroy in 2002, A Lethal Dose of American Hatred in 2003, and Caught Up in the Gears of Application in 2016. Side projectsArson Anthem= Arson Anthem is a Southern hardcore punk project that originated when Eyehategod singer Mike Williams moved into Anselmo's spare apartment after losing all his possessions in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. The two spent countless hours listening to Anselmo's collection of early hardcore bands. They began jamming with Hank III and Collin Yeo, who were united by their desire to have a hardcore/crust punk band of their own. The Arson Anthem lineup features Mike Williams on vocals, Anselmo on guitar, Hank III on drums, and Collin Yeo on bass. =Christ Inversion= Christ Inversion was formed in 1994. The group was a short-lived black metal project formed by Anselmo, where he played guitar under the aliases \\"Anton Crowley\\". Most of their lyrics were based on horror films and Satanism. The band recorded two demos in 1994 and 1995 respectively, and then disbanded without ever recording a full-length album. Many years later, songs from the first demo were put on an 8-track compilation, and released through Anselmo's own Housecore Records on October 28, 2008. =Southern Isolation= The band released one EP called Southern Isolation. It originally contained four songs, but was later re-released with a fifth bonus track. The band consisted of Stephanie Opal Weinstein on vocals and guitars, Anselmo on vocals, backing vocals and guitars, \\"Big\\" Ross Karpelman (of Clearlight) on keyboards, and Sid Montz (of Crowbar) on drums. One rare track called \\"Faded\\" has been credited to Southern Isolation on the Manson Family Soundtrack, which is due to be released on Anselmo's Housecore label. =Viking Crown= In the mid-90s, Anselmo began to record for several side projects under the aliases Anton Crowley, most notably with Viking Crown. The name Anton Crowley is taken from Aleister Crowley (British occultist) and Anton LaVey (Founder and High Priest of the Church of Satan). Viking Crown was a short-lived and essentially solo side project started by Anselmo in the mid-90s. The members of the band are Anselmo (under the aliases Anton Crowley) on guitars, bass and drums; Killjoy on vocals; and Opal Enthroned (Stephanie Opal Weinstein) on keyboards. On their first album Unorthodox Steps of Ritual, Anselmo played every instrument and laid down his own vocals. The band never performed live. =Eibon= Eibon was a very short-lived supergroup, which Anselmo participated in from 1998 to 2000. The group featured Killjoy, Fenriz, Satyr, and Maniac. The project has been put on indefinite hiatus, and to date, it has only released only a single track, Mirror Soul Jesus, which appeared on the Moonfog 2000: A Different Perspective compilation in 2000. The band is on Satyr's record label 'Moonfog Productions'. =Philip H. Anselmo & The Illegals= During 2011‚Äì2012, Anselmo wrote and recorded a solo album, titled Walk Through Exits Only with his backing band The Illegals. The album was released on July 16, 2013. In October 2017, the second album Choosing Mental Illness as a Virtue was announced, originally due in December but have officially set it for January 26, 2018. The first song, \\"Choosing Mental Illness\\", was made available for streaming. The next song, \\"The Ignorant Point\\", was released on December 13. Exclaim! scored the album an 8 out of 10. =Scour= It was announced on May 12, 2016, that Anselmo would be fronting a new band, Scour, with members from Pig Destroyer (John Jarvis), Cattle Decapitation (Derek Engemann), Animosity (Chase Fraser), and Strong Intention (Jesse Schobel). The band's debut EP was released July 15, 2016 on Anselmo's label Housecore Records, featuring six songs all under 3 minutes in length. The band is stylistically black metal, with the exception of Anselmo's use of lower growling instead of the higher, raspier vocals commonly associated with the genre. In August 2017, the next EP titled Red was announced for a November 3 release. The title track and the song \\"Piles\\" were made available for streaming ahead of the release of the EP. =En Minor= In a September 27, 2017 interview with Jimmy Cabbs' 5150 interview series, Anselmo announced a new project called En Minor, which he said is influenced by the artists of the classic 1980's gothic rock period. The band released a self-titled EP on August 2, 2019, containing the tracks \\"On the Floor\\" and \\"There's a Long Way to Go\\". Guest appearances Anselmo playing guitar for Eyehategod during Hellfest 2009 In 1993, Anselmo produced Crowbar's self titled album and recorded backing vocals on some of the tracks. In 1996, Anselmo recorded guitars on two songs (\\"Van Full of Retards\\" and a cover of Manowar's \\"Gloves of Metal\\") and contributed vocals/backing vocals on 18 songs for Anal Cunt's 40 More Reasons to Hate Us album. In 1996, Anselmo recorded backing vocals for tracks on Crowbar's Broken Glass album. In 1998, Anselmo provided vocals on Soilent Green's album Sewn Mouth Secrets. Although not credited, he is given thanks in the liner notes. In 1997, Necrophagia frontman Killjoy reformed his band with Anselmo on guitars. Using the Anton Crowley aliases, Anselmo appeared on the 1998 Holocausto de la Morte album, the 1999 Black Blood Vomitorium EP, and finally the 2001 Cannibal Holocaust EP, which featured Opal Enthroned (then Anselmo's wife) on keyboards. Anselmo left the band in 2001. In 1998, Anthrax released the album Volume 8: The Threat Is Real. Anselmo provided backing vocals on track 8 (\\"Killing Box\\"). Also, his Pantera bandmate Dimebag Darrell played guitar solos on tracks 3 (\\"Inside Out\\") and 7 (\\"Born Again Idiot\\"). In 1998, Anselmo sang a duet (\\"By the River\\") on Vision of Disorder's Imprint album. In 2000, Tony Iommi released a collaborative album with various well known vocalists. Initially, Anselmo was going to co-create an entire album with Iommi, but due to tour schedules it never happened. Anselmo managed, however, to lay down some tracks for Iommi's album. Iommi and Anselmo wrote and recorded three tracks together, \\"Time Is Mine\\", \\"Inversion of the Saviours\\", and a third unknown track. Iommi picked \\"Time Is Mine\\" for the album. \\"Inversion of the Saviours\\" was never officially released, but can be found online. The third unknown track is now highly sought after by fans of both artists. In 2001, Anselmo provided vocals for \\"HFFK\\" on Biohazard's Uncivilization album. On March 6, 2006, Anselmo made an appearance along with Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver bassist Duff McKagan and the surviving members of Alice in Chains at a VH1's Decades Rock Live concert, in honor of the band Heart. In 2008, Anselmo recorded vocals for the Mahakali album by Jarboe. The track is sparse musically, features a raw vocal delivery by Anselmo, and a short spoken-word segment. Voivod in 2013 In 2015, Anselmo contributed backing vocals to \\"The Prophets of Loss\\", a song from the Cattle Decapitation album \\"The Anthropocene Extinction\\", released in August 2015. In January 2016, Anselmo sang lead vocals in a band which included Foo Fighters lead singer Dave Grohl, Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, and former Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. They performed the song \\"Ace of Spades\\" by recently deceased metal legend, Lemmy Kilmister, who played for Hawkwind and Mot√∂rhead. Housecore Records Anselmo started his own record label called Housecore Records sometime in 2001. The name derived from Anselmo's home being described as more of a \\"hang out\\" where many local friends and musicians would stay and record music together. Housecore also features in tattoo form on Anselmo's arm (Anselmo's told fans via live webcam that it was his first and favourite tattoo). Anselmo's primary objective is to release much older unreleased material and material from his many side projects. After gaining permission from Pantera's label, Elektra, he merged Housecore with his longtime friend and Necrophagia bandmate Killjoy's label, Baphomet Records. The newly named \\"Baphomet/Housecore Records\\" secured distribution deals with Relapse Records in August 2001. Anselmo stated \\"What you're going to get here with Baphomet/Housecore, it's going to be different. It's going to be a fresh approach. It's going to be a lot of home made shit, not all major label- produced monstrosities. I just got permission from Elektra to independently put out all the bands that I've ever fucking done. Each band that I'm involved in outside of Pantera is a way for me to express and develop different outlets that are very much a part of me. With Pantera it's only one side of me. I love to write and create music, and the side bands are very different from Pantera. They also show the flexibility in me as a musician; Pantera's very important in my life, but there's many other things that keep this boy here content\\". After only three releases, Anselmo and Killjoy severed business ties, thus returning Anselmo's label to its original name, Housecore Records. Housecore is now actively releasing material by Anselmo and by bands he is producing and supporting. Influences Anselmo has a wide range of musical influences from classic rock to black metal. He was mainly influenced by Black Sabbath, Black Flag, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Slayer, Hellhammer, and Venom. He pays tribute to two of his favorite bands in the lyrics of the Pantera song \\"Goddamn Electric\\", singing \\"your trust is in whiskey and weed and Black Sabbath\\"; in the second verse, the lyric is tweaked to \\"whiskey and weed and Slayer\\". Anselmo states that his main vocal influence had been Judas Priest singer, Rob Halford, before he decided to focus on the exploration of his own technique. Anselmo mentioned that he is a massive fan of hardcore punk. In 2016, Anselmo said the favorite of recent concerts he had attended included Morrissey, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, and Stevie Wonder.Fred Pessaro (2016). Phil Anselmo on Superjoint, Trump and Making Things Right, CLRVYNT.com, accessed 21 December 2017 Wonder performed the entirety of his classic 1976 album Songs in the Key of Life, which Anselmo described as \\"like watching a living, breathing miracle right before your eyes.\\" Voiceover work Anselmo can be heard in the Jim Van Bebber movie The Manson Family as the voice of Satan. The soundtrack for this movie also contains music from several of Anselmo's bands. Anselmo appears in the YouTube comedy series Metal Grasshopper with comedian Dave Hill, in which he instructs Hill on how to \\"be\\" metal. Personal life Anselmo in October 2012 On October 31, 2001, Anselmo married his longtime girlfriend, Stephanie Opal Weinstein. That same year, the couple created an all-acoustic duo called Southern Isolation. Anselmo and Weinstein divorced in 2004. As of 2011, Anselmo is in a relationship with Kate Richardson, who also helps with the running of his record label, Housecore Records. As of 2011, Anselmo now resides in rural Louisiana. He is an atheist. Anselmo was friends with fellow musician Seth Putnam up until his death. Interests Anselmo owns an extensive collection of several thousand horror films, and possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of horror films and horror culture. Together with Steve Joseph, Ross Karpelman, and Jay Gracianette, Anselmo started a Halloween-themed attraction called House of Shock. Initially it began in Jay Gracianette's backyard, but was later moved to a large warehouse outside New Orleans that has been converted into an interactive haunted house with over three hundred volunteer workers. The attraction has raised money for the Children's Hospital of New Orleans, the Parish Police Bullet Proof Vest Fund, and the Greater New Orleans Riding Rehabilitation Center. Anselmo played the role of a part-time actor when his schedule permitted, however Anselmo is no longer involved with House of Shock. In 2013, Anselmo founded Housecore Horror Film Festival which groups horror films and metal bands throughout the event. Anselmo has an interest in the sport of boxing. He owns hundreds of fight DVDs and used to take a boxing trainer on tour with him. He has written articles as a columnist for the Boxing Insider website. Also a fan of the NFL team New Orleans Saints, Anselmo has interviewed Saints player Jeremy Shockey and has helped to coach a youth team at the request of Saints team ambassador Michael Lewis during a visit to the team's practice facility. Back injury and subsequent drug abuse According to Anselmo, he suffered constant pain due to a back injury he sustained in the mid-1990s. To alleviate the pain, he drank heavily, abused pills such as painkillers and muscle relaxants, and eventually became addicted to heroin. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s his drug abuse severely affected his onstage performance. On July 13, 1996, Anselmo went into cardiac arrest due to a heroin overdose after a show at the Coca-Cola Starplex in Dallas, Texas. Paramedics revived him, and four days later, he issued a press release stating, \\"I, Philip H. Anselmo [...] injected a lethal dose of heroin into my arm, and died for four to five minutes\\". In 2005, Anselmo stopped using hard drugs, so that he could be cleared for surgery to repair back damage caused by degenerative disc disease, and has remained clean ever since. The surgery was successful, and after several months of recuperation and rehabilitation, he returned to recording and touring. In November 2016, Anselmo reported that he had stopped drinking alcohol. Though he is \\"pretty much an atheist\\", he nonetheless gave up alcohol during Lent earlier that year and \\"kind of lost the taste for it.\\" Racial controversies On January 22, 2016, Anselmo ended the \\"Dimebash\\" Dimebag Darrell tribute show by giving a Nazi salute and screaming the words \\"white power\\" to the crowd. The incident was captured by an audience member's cell phone camera and the video was posted on YouTube. Anselmo later claimed he was joking about drinking \\"white wine\\". Anselmo commented on the YouTube video, writing: A week later, however, while continuing to receive severe online backlash from the metal community, Anselmo released a more formal and official apology, in which he said, \\"It was ugly, it was uncalled for and anybody who knows me and my true nature knows that I don't believe in any of that. I'm a thousand percent apologetic to anyone who took offense to what I said, cause you should've taken offense to what I said.\\" In an interview with Eddie Trunk on Sirius XM on December 15, 2016, Anselmo claimed he was being taunted throughout the show by \\"two or three little hecklers\\" who were standing near the stage. He stated that the hecklers called him all sorts of names throughout the show, and by the end he said he'd lost his patience. Of the show Anselmo said, \\"When people start screaming 'racist' over and over and over and over again at me, what I did was show them exactly what [...] the ugliest possible thing I could think of at the time was.\\" Discography ;Studio albums * Walk Through Exits Only (2013) * Choosing Mental Illness as a Virtue (2018) ReferencesExternal links * Category:Grace King High School alumni Category:American baritones Category:American heavy metal singers Category:Thrash metal musicians Category:Punk rock singers Category:20th-century American singers Category:21st-century American singers Category:American collectors Category:American atheists Category:Living people Category:Musicians from New Orleans Category:American people of Danish descent Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American people of French descent Category:Pantera members Category:American multi-instrumentalists Category:Down (band) members Category:1968 births Category:American punk rock singers Category:Superjoint members Category:Singers from Louisiana ","title":"Phil Anselmo"},{"id":"432657","text":"The marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris) is a small North American songbird of the wren family. It is sometimes called the long-billed marsh wren to distinguish it from the sedge wren, also known as the short-billed marsh wren. Taxonomy The marsh wren was described by the Scottish-American ornithologist Alexander Wilson in 1810 and given the binomial name Certhia palustris. The current genus Cistothorus was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1850. There are 15 recognised subspecies. Etymology: from Greek 'Œ∫ŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ' (cistos, \\"a shrub\\") and 'Œ∏ŒøœÖœÅŒøœÇ' (thouros, \\"leaping, or running through\\") and Latin 'palustris' (\\"marshy\\"). Description Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area, Quebec, Canada Adults have brown upperparts with a light brown belly and flanks and a white throat and breast. The back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill. The male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire. This little bird is native to Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Their breeding habitat is marshes with tall vegetation such as cattails across North America. In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds migrate to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and Mexico. their non-breeding range is in the southern United States going into Mexico and their breeding range is in the northeastern United States going into Canada.Cornell All About Birds. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory Measurements: * Length: 3.9-5.5 in (10-14 cm) * Weight: 0.3-0.5 oz (9-14 g) * Wingspan: 5.9 in (15 cm)  Foraging and diet  These birds forage actively in vegetation close to the water, occasionally flying up to catch insects in flight. They mainly eat insects, also spiders and snails. In California, 53 Western Marsh Wren stomachs were examined which showed that the birds consume bugs (29%), caterpillars and chrysalids (17%), beetles (16%), ants and wasps (8%), spiders (5%), carabids and coccinellids (2%), with various other flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies and unidentifiable insect remains making up over 11 percent. Ants and wasps were observed to be mostly eaten in the fall.  Nesting  The nest is an oval structure attached to marsh vegetation, entered from the side. The male builds many unused nests in his territory. A hypothesis of the possible reason to why males build multiple \\"dummy\\" nests in their territory is that they are courting areas and that the females construct the \\"breeding nest\\", where she lays the eggs in.Metz, Karen J. ‚ÄúThe Enigma of Multiple Nest Building by Male Marsh Wrens.‚Äù Jan. 1991, pp. 170‚Äì173. He may puncture the eggs and fatally peck the nestlings of other birds nesting nearby, including his own species (even his own offspring) and red-winged blackbirds, yellow- headed blackbirds, and least bitterns. The clutch is normally four to six eggs, though the number can range from three to 10. The eggs are usually 0.6-0.7 inches in length and 0.4-0.6 inches in width. Incubation is performed only by females, and only females develop a brood patch. Marsh wren young can get infected by pathogenic larvae.Warren, Yvonne. \\"Protocalliphora Braueri (Diptera: Calliphoridae) Induced Pathogenesis in a Brood of Marsh Wren (Cistothorus Palustris) Young\\". Journal of Wildlife Diseases, 17 Mar. 1993, . The Blowfly larvae infect the young by subdermal myiasis-induced lesions and subsequent sepsis. The larvae form a wound in the young by rasping and expanding a hole in their skin to create blood flow and feed on the blood of the hosts' body.  Conservation  This bird is still common with an estimated global breeding population of 9.4 million. That being said, its numbers have declined with the loss of suitable wetland habitat and wholesale draining of marshes will lead to local extinction. Still, this species is widespread enough not to qualify as threatened according to the IUCN.

His poetry shows an openness to both European and American modernist influences, while remaining grounded in the experience of living in the English Midlands. Fisher has experimented with a wide range of styles throughout his career, largely working outside of the mainstream of post-war British poetry. He has been admired by poets and critics as diverse as Donald Davie, Eric Mottram, Marjorie Perloff, and Sean O‚ÄôBrien. Life Roy Fisher was born in June 1930 at 74 Kentish Road, Handsworth, Birmingham, the home into which his parents had moved in 1919 and where they lived until their deaths. His mother Emma was 39 at the time of Fisher's birth. A sister and a brother preceded him. His father Walter Fisher was a craftsman in the jewellery trade, the family ‚Äòpoor and prudent‚Äô.‚ÄòAntebiography‚Äô in An Easily Bewildered Childhood: Occasional Prose 1963‚Äì2013, Shearsman, 2013 His parents had no political or religious affiliations, but his father was a chorister at a local church. Fisher describes the landscape of his childhood as ‚Äòugly‚Äô, the industrial sprawl of Smethwick to the south of Handsworth a place of danger.‚ÄòBrum Born‚Äô in An Easily Bewildered Childhood: Occasional Prose 1963‚Äì2013, Shearsman, 2013. The grimy cityscape, the bomb damage of the war, and the industrial decline of the post-war years were important influences on Fisher. But ‚Äòsomething called Nature‚Äô was also present early in his life, with excursions into the nearby countryside a regular aspect of family life. Fisher went to Handsworth Grammar School. As a teenager he became interested in jazz and taught himself to play the piano. He was particularly influenced by a group of Chicago musicians including Bud Freeman, Pee Wee Russell, and the pianist Joe Sullivan. By his late teens he was playing in public with local bands. In 1948 he went to Birmingham University to read English. After graduating and qualifying as a teacher, he taught from 1953 at the grammar school in Newton Abbott, Devon, as part of a team engaged in a radical revision of English teaching methods. In the same year Fisher married artist Barbara Venables; they were to have two children. His son Ben was Head of French at University of Bangor, and creator of one of the world's most popular narrow-gauge railway websites; his daughter Sukey is an award-winning screenwriter. Returning to Birmingham in 1957, where he again worked as a jazz musician and began encountering, often late at night, the material that would prompt new poetry and prose, Fisher worked as a specialist Drama teacher in a primary school, moving to Dudley College of Education in 1958. In 1963 he was appointed to Bordesley College of Education in Birmingham as Principal Lecturer and Head of Department of English and Drama. In 1971 Fisher moved to Keele University where he taught in the Department of American Studies until 1982. After leaving Keele he continued to work as a writer and jazz musician, a second career he had sustained since the late 1950s playing with a number of his childhood heroes including Bud Freeman and Wild Bill Davison when they were touring Britain.Interview with Eric Mottram 1973, excerpted in Interviews Through Time. Shearsman, revised edition, 2013. Fisher moved to Upper Hulme, Staffordshire Moorlands in 1982, and to Earl Sterndale in Derbyshire in 1986. In 1985 he was divorced from Barbara Venables Fisher, who died in 2007. In 1987 he married the playwright Joyce Holliday and outlived her by fifteen years. He died at home on 21 March 2017, aged 86. Work= Early work  In 1954 Fisher had two short poems broadcast on the BBC by Charles Causley, and another published in a small press magazine The Window. The latter caught the eye of the poet Gael Turnbull who was putting together a British issue of the American magazine Origin, edited by Cid Corman, and he asked Fisher to contribute.Interview with John Tranter published by Jacket magazine 1989, excerpted in Interviews Through Time. Fisher and Turnbull became friends, and remained close until Turnbull's death in 2004. Turnbull introduced Fisher to the work of American modernist poets including William Carlos Williams, Robert Creeley, Charles Olson, and Louis Zukovsky, as well as to Basil Bunting, whom he met through Turnbull. Cid Corman also provided poetry tutorials by post. In these writers Fisher encountered an aesthetic that was serious and demanding. It was this rather than any stylistic mannerism he took from them. Publication of Fisher's work during his first ten years as a poet owed a great deal to Turnbull. Fisher's first pamphlet City (1961) was published by Turnbull's Migrant Press. The assemblage of verse and prose which makes up the text, was compiled from Fisher's notebooks by Michael Shayer, Turnbull's partner at Migrant. Fisher was dissatisfied with the pamphlet but it ‚Äòcaught people‚Äôs attention.‚Äô A second pamphlet, Ten Interiors with Various Figures, was published by Tarasque Press in 1966, a surreal sequence of narrative poems some with quite short lines but many using a very long line close to prose. That same year Fisher also published The Ships Orchestra with Fulcrum Press, a long prose sequence again showing the influence of surrealism. The initial idea for the work came from Picasso's ‚ÄòThree Musicians‚Äô. Fisher wrote this work sequentially, each new section generated out of the preceding material.Interview with Jed Rasula and Mike Erwin, 1973, excerpted in Interviews Through Time. The work grows organically, following no plot, and avoiding any sense of dramatic development. The writing is often very funny and can be viewed as a verbal equivalent of the cubist technique Picasso employs in the painting. After these publications Fisher reached an impasse and, apart from fulfilling a commission to make performance-translations of three Schubert song-cycles, wrote nothing for 5 years.Interview with Robert Sheppard, 1982, excerpted in Interviews Through Time. In 1968 when Fulcrum published Collected Poems, bringing together all of the work Fisher wished to preserve, the poet thought he would not write again.  The 1970s  Fisher emerged from this period of blocked creativity in 1971, composing a number of prose pieces and sequences of poems. ‚ÄòThe Cut Pages‚Äô is the most radical of these 1970s works and remains Fisher's most challenging. The late sixties had been personally difficult years and Fisher kept a journal in which he recorded the ‚Äògrisly‚Äô details of his life. ‚ÄòThe Cut Pages‚Äô Fisher describes as an ‚Äòexercise in self- permission‚Äô. He cut the blank pages from his notebook with a razor and started to write on them the ‚Äòconverse‚Äô of what was in the journal ‚Äì things ‚Äòthere was no constraint upon‚Äô. He continued writing until he had used up all the pages. The American critic Marjorie Perloff describes the poem as having affinities with Samuel Beckett and as an ‚Äòunwitting precursor‚Äô of the experiments of Ron Silliman and other Language poets a decade later. ‚ÄòThe Cut Pages‚Äô became the title sequence for a 1971 publication from Fulcrum that also contained a four further prose pieces. Matrix was also published in 1971 by Fulcrum. The title sequence, ‚ÄòMatrix‚Äô, like a number of Fisher's poems, draws upon painting, in this case B√∂cklin's series of pictures called ‚ÄòThe Isle of the Dead‚Äô and Monet's late paintings of waterlilies. This volume also includes ‚ÄòGlenthorne Poems‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Six Deliberate Acts,‚Äô and a number of collaborations with visual artists. Two of his works, ‚ÄòCorrespondence‚Äô and ‚ÄòMetamorphoses‚Äô, were illustrated by Tom Phillips and published in 1970 by Tetrad, a small London press run by artist Ian Tyson. ‚ÄòAlso‚Äô a collaboration with artist Derrick Greaves was published by Tetrad in 1972, and the same year the artist Ronald King published Bluebeard‚Äôs Castle with text by Fisher. Other collaborations with King followed over a period of twenty-five years, mostly appearing as Artist's Books and all issued by his Circle Press. Fisher produced work steadily during the 1970s and published a further volume in 1978, The Thing About Joe Sullivan, this time with Carcanet. It was a Poetry Book Society Choice. The volume includes ‚ÄòHandsworth Liberties‚Äô, a sequence of sixteen poems written between 1974 and 1977. These poems recall images of the neighbourhood where he grew up. Fisher described the writing of these pieces as an attempt to ‚Äòrepel the invasion of landscape‚Äô associated with childhood memories.Interview with Peter Robinson, 1977, excerpted in Interviews Through Time. ‚ÄòWonders of Obligation‚Äô, composed in 1979, marks a new development in Fisher's work, which combines a greater freedom of movement through the compositional elements, and a further fluency and directness in both evocation and comment.  A Furnace  In 1980 Oxford University Press published Poems 1955‚Äì1980, affording Fisher's work a level of recognition it had not previously enjoyed. Six years later OUP published A Furnace, an ambitious book-length poem structured around the idea of a double spiral with a central section, ‚ÄòCore‚Äô, flanked by sections where passages move ‚Äòin‚Äô or ‚Äòout‚Äô from the core. An ‚ÄòIntroit‚Äô provides the background and context to the work.'They are all gone into the world,' a conversation with Peter Robinson published in Interviews Through Time. As with Fisher's other work, it is a collage of images, but here drawn from a wide range of places and historical periods. In 1980 Fisher travelled outside of Britain for the first time and A Furnace includes references to a prehistoric burial site in Brittany, to Paris, Trier, Chicago and to Ampurias in Spain. Bunting's Briggflatts is in some senses a model, though Fisher allows himself more space and the language is less compacted than in Bunting. A further collection, Poems 1955‚Äì1987, was published by OUP in 1988, mainly collecting previous published work.  Later poems  In 1992 the poet and film maker Tom Pickard produced a documentary about Fisher with funding from the Arts Council called Birmingham‚Äôs What I Think With. Fisher wrote a sequence of poems for the film describing the city of his birth. These were published by OUP in 1994 along with other new work in a collection titled Birmingham River. The collaboration with Ronald King continued with Top Down Bottom Up published in 1989, and Anansi Company appearing in 1991. A pamphlet, It Follows That, issued by Pig Press, also appeared in 1994. In 1996 Bloodaxe published Dow Low Drop: New and Selected Poems. Dow Low is a quarried-out hillside near Fisher's home in Derbyshire. ‚ÄòDow Low Drop‚Äô, and the poem ‚ÄòIt Follows That‚Äô republished here, both include sections of prose, a form Fisher had not used since the 1960s. In an interview with Peter Robinson given in 1998 Fisher questions the idea that his work has gone through distinct periods of development, and the collected poems The Long and the Short of It, published by Bloodaxe in 2005, does not present the poems in a chronological sequence. In a note at the end of the book Fisher says: ‚Äòmy habits of working on projects from time to time over long periods and my heterodox approach to the methods I use would make an arrangement that seemed chronological false: so nothing of the kind is here attempted.‚ÄôThe Long and the Short of It, Bloodaxe, 2005. A later collection, Standard Midland, was published in 2010 by Bloodaxe, and shortlisted that year for the Costa Poetry Award. The poems were incorporated into a revised edition of The Long and the Short of It (2012). Standard Midland includes poems in various styles from lighter pieces, to more characteristic work, including two enigmatic prose poems, and another of his collaborative pieces with Ronald King. A further volume, Slakki: New & Neglected Poems, was published by Bloodaxe in October 2016.  Critical reception  As early as 1962, Denise Levertov‚Äìin an article published in Kultur‚Äìsingled Fisher out as one of the most promising young poets in Britain.Denise Levertov, Kultur, Summer, 1962. His early poems appeared in several influential anthologies: Michael Horovitz‚Äôs Children of Albion (1969), Edward Lucie-Smith‚Äôs British Poetry Since 1945 (1971) and Jon Silkin‚Äôs Poetry of the Committed Individual (1973) ‚Äì all published by Penguin. Fisher attracted the attention of a diverse range of critics and reviewers over the years. Eric Mottram, writing in Stand (1969‚Äì70) praised Fisher as an experimental modernist,Eric Mottram, Stand, 1969‚Äì70. while Donald Davie, in a chapter devoted to Fisher in Thomas Hardy and British Poetry (1973), claimed affinities with what he considered a native tradition.Donald Davie, Thomas Hardy and British Poetry, Routledge & Keegan Paul, 1973. Peter Robinson has suggested that this kind of ‚Äòdualism of approach‚Äô, with modernists and traditionalists both claiming Fisher as one of their own, has continued to the present.Peter Robinson, ‚ÄòIntroduction‚Äô in The Thing About Roy Fisher, ed. John Kerrigan and Peter Robinson, Liverpool University Press, 2000. Fisher himself never sought to associate with any particular camp or school, and his writing during all periods of his career embraces a range of styles. Critics as diverse as Andrew Crozier, Sean O‚ÄôBrien, and Marjorie Perloff have written in praise of Fisher, though from very different perspectives. Despite the quality of his work, Fisher never enjoyed the level of celebrity accorded to some of his contemporaries. Davie says that Fisher was a victim of \\"the blindness and condescension of the metropolis to writing which is provincial in its origins or its subject matter\\". In interviews, Fisher described himself as being highly conscious of his provincial and class background. At the same time, Fisher never sought celebrity, being largely indifferent to the world of poetry prizes and media hype. While admired by many poets and dedicated poetry readers he remains largely unknown to a wider reading public. News for the Ear: A Homage to Roy Fisher edited by Peter Robinson and Robert Sheppard appeared in 2000, as a tribute to the poet on his seventieth birthday. A volume of critical essays, The Thing About Roy Fisher, edited by John Kerrigan and Peter Robinson, was published the same year. A compendium of interviews with Fisher, Interviews Through Time, edited by Tony Fraser, also appeared in 2000, with an updated version issued in 2013. In 2010, An Unofficial Roy Fisher edited by Peter Robinson was published in celebration of the poet's eightieth birthday. This book includes work by Fisher not collected elsewhere, as well as tributes from other poets and commentary on his work. The work also includes an update to the invaluable bibliography published in The Thing About Roy Fisher, compiled by Derek Slade. In 2003, Fisher was made lifetime Honorary Poet of the City of Birmingham. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2005.

He was Governor of Nova Scotia from 1816 to 1820, Governor General of British North America from 1820 to 1828 and later Commander-in-Chief in India. In turn, his son, James Andrew Broun- Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie, would later serve as Governor-General of India. Background and education Dalhousie was born at Dalhousie Castle, Midlothian, the son of George Ramsay, 8th Earl of Dalhousie, and Elizabeth, daughter of Andrew Glen. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and the University of Edinburgh. Military career After his father's death in 1787, Dalhousie joined the British Army in July 1788 by purchasing a cornetcy in the 3rd Dragoons, and was later appointed to the captaincy of an independent company he himself had raised. He joined the 2nd battalion of the 1st Foot in January 1791, and purchased the rank of major in the 2nd Foot in June 1792. He travelled with the regiment to Martinique, as its commander, and succeeded to the lieutenant-colonelcy in August 1794. He was severely wounded in 1795 and returned to Britain. In 1798 he served in the Irish Rebellion, and in 1799 throughout the Flanders campaign. He received the brevet rank of colonel in January 1800, and fought in the later stages of the Egyptian campaign under Ralph Abercromby, capturing Rosetta without a fight and successfully investing the nearby Fort Julien in April 1801. In 1803 he served as a brigadier-general on the staff in Scotland, and was appointed Major- General in April 1805. During the later stages of the Peninsular War Dalhousie commanded the 7th Division under the Duke of Wellington. Wellington was sometimes critical of his performance, as during the retreat from Burgos, because of his tardy arrival at Vitoria, and for his misinformation about French intentions shortly before the Battle of Roncesvalles.Chandler, David. Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars. New York: Macmillan, 1979. p.113 With Henry Clinton (or Oswald) and William Stewart he displayed insubordination during the retreat from Burgos. Wellington ordered them down a certain road, but they decided it \\"was too long and too wet and chose another. This brought them to a bridge which was blocked so that they could not cross. Here, eventually, Wellington found them, waiting. What, Wellington was asked, did he say to them? ‚ÄòOh by God, it was too serious to say anything.‚Äô ‚ÄòWhat a situation is mine!‚Äô he complained to London later. ‚ÄòIt is impossible to prevent incapable men from being sent to the army.‚Äô\\".Chandler p.203 At Vitoria he was delayed because he \\"had found difficulty in marching through the broken country\\", though Thomas Picton arrived early enough and attacked in his stead when the 7th Division failed to appear Parkinson The Peninsular War p.179 He was nevertheless voted the thanks of Parliament for his services at Vitoria where he commanded the Left Center Column, consisting of the 3rd and 7th Divisions. He was appointed lieutenant-general, and colonel of the 13th Foot in 1813. He led his division in the Battle of the Pyrenees where it was lightly engaged, then went home to England in October. After the previous commander was wounded at the Battle of Orthez in February 1814, Dalhousie briefly led the 7th Division again. He occupied the city of Bordeaux and thus missed the final Battle of Toulouse. William Kemley was said to have saved the life of Ramsay in battle, by holding a flag over his body. In doing so he suffered a wound from a musket ball that left him with a permanent hole in the palm of his hand. His grandson, Peter Gordon Kemley, used to tell how he could put his finger through the palm of his grandfather's hand. For his actions, William Kemley was given a house on the Dalhousie Estate at Brechin Castle, rent-free for life. His daughter, Caroline Kemley, was born under a gun carriage the evening before the Battle of Quatre Bras. Her mother was one of six wives per regiment permitted to accompany their husbands. Later career In 1815 he was created Baron Dalhousie, of Dalhousie Castle in the County of Edinburgh, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, to allow him to sit in the House of Lords by right (until that point he had sat as a Scottish representative peer). Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia According to the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Ramsay sought a position in colonial administration to pay debts he incurred expanding his estate. He replaced Sir John Coape Sherbrooke as Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia in 1816. He is known to have employed an official draughtsman, John Elliott Woolford, known for many surviving drawings and paintings. Ramsay created Dalhousie College, Nova Scotia's first college, which grew into Dalhousie University. In 2018 professors at Dalhousie convinced its President to form a panel to report on statements and action Ramsay made that gave the strong appearance of racism. Thousands of black refugees, who had been held in slavery in the USA, had been guaranteed freedom, by the British, if they ran away from their masters, during the American Revolution. Most of these former slaves settled in Nova Scotia. Ramsay had tried to induce them to (1) return to their US masters; (2) return to Africa; (3) Leave Nova Scotia for the British colony of Trinidad. Governor-General of Canada When Ramsay was made Governor-General of Canada he toured both Upper and Lower Canada, including what was then distant wilderness. This painting shows his expedition portaging at what is now North Bay, Ontario. He was appointed, Governor General of British North America in 1820 and held that position until 1828. Commander in Chief of India Ramsay was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army in 1828. Ramsay was stationed in Calcutta and Simla. India taxed his health, and he resigned in 1832. Retirement Ramsay suffered a \\"fainting fit\\" in February 1833. His health continued to deteriorate, and he returned to his estate, in 1834, where his health continued to deteriorate until his death 4 years later. He went both blind and senile in his final years. Family Lord Dalhousie married Christian, daughter of Charles Broun, of Colstoun in East Lothian, Scotland, a lady of gentle extraction and distinguished gifts, in 1805. She was recognised as a \\"zealous botanist\\" by leading scientists of her day. Ramsay and Christian had three sons, the two elder of whom died early. He died at Dalhousie Castle in March 1838, aged 67, and was succeeded by his youngest son, James, who was later created Marquess of Dalhousie. Lady Dalhousie died in January 1839. Legacy While serving as Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia he founded Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The town of Dalhousie, New Brunswick was named after him when he visited there in 1826, although his diary entry for the day stated that he disapproved of changing the original French and Mi'kmaq location names. The villages of East and West Dalhousie in Nova Scotia are named after him, as are Earltown and Port Dalhousie, a community near St. Catharines, Ontario, a community in Calgary Alberta, Dalhousie Station and an adjacent square, Dalhousie Square in Montreal.

It is widely distributed in North America. It is often found in wet grasslands and meadows where it nests in the tall grasses and sedges and feeds on insects. The sedge wren was formerly considered as conspecific with the non-migratory grass wren of central and South America.  Taxonomy  The sedge wren was described by the German ornithologist Johann Friedrich Naumann in 1823 under the binomial name Troglodytes stellaris. The type locality is Carolina. The current genus Cistothorus was introduced by the German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1850. The sedge wren and the grass wren were formerly treated as conspecific. They were split based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014. The sedge wren is monotypic. The sedge wren was formerly known as the short-billed marsh wren but was renamed to better distinguish it from the marsh wren.  Description  The sedge wren is a relatively small wren that measures , weighs and has a wing- chord of . Wingspan ranges from 4.7-5.5 in (12-14 cm). Females and males have the same plumage but males are slightly larger. Their head and back are tawny brown streaked with black and white. They have a pale buff supercilium and brown irises. Their rump is orange and tail is tawny brown bared with black. Wings are tawny brown bared with black, white and pale buff. They have a white throat and belly with pale buff on the side. Their beak is long and slender. and measures on average 6.77 to 6.95 mm The upper mandible of the beak is brown while the lower mandible is yellow. They have pink legs and feet. Juveniles are overall similar to adults but have less streaking on the head and nape and their chest is paler than adults. The sedge wren can be differentiated from the similar marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris) by its smaller size, streaked crown and different song.  Distribution and habitat = Distribution  During the breeding season they are found in the southern half of Alberta and Saskatchewan and in southern Ontario and Quebec in Canada and in the United States, west of the Appalachians, from the Canadian border to Missouri and northern Arkansas. During migration and winter they are found from the southern half of Arkansas down to Texas and Florida. Sedge wren in tall vegetation  Habitat  During the breeding season, sedge wrens generally occupy meadows and wet grasslands. They can however live in wetter areas such as marshes and dryer habitat such as dry prairies. They prefer areas with dense and tall grasses and sedges to build their nests. During winter, migratory sedge wrens can be found in a variety of habitat as long as there are sufficient insects to eat. For example, they can be found in pine savannas, dry prairies, meadows, marshes, and bogs.  Behavior = Vocalizations  Songs usually last 1.5 to 2 seconds and start with 3 to 4 high notes or staccato chips followed by a series of thrills. While both male and females can produce calls, only the males sing. Males sing from late winter to early spring on non-breeding grounds and throughout the breeding season to attract mates. They sing both during the day and the night. While males usually sing to attract females, they can also engage in countersinging, where a male will respond to another male's song. A male will usually answer the other male with a different song type and frequently change song types during the interaction. Both males also usually sing faster during countersinging. It is hypothesized that they do so to send the maximum amount of stimuli to the listener whether it be a male or a potential mate. = Improvisation = Sedge wrens improvise their songs rather than learning them from other birds. Lab and field observations demonstrated that males had large ranges of individually unique songs and that their songs were poor imitations of the same template songs. There was also very little song sharing among males. This large variation results from the tendency of North American sedge wrens to move often. North American sedge wrens are nomadic breeders compared to their sedentary central and South American relatives. They breed where moist meadows and grasslands are available and they may not return to the same locations the next year if conditions are not right. Furthermore, adult birds may switch locations after raising their first brood to go to wetter areas. There is thus a lot of movement and mixing of populations and birds rarely have the same neighbor twice. Therefore, there is no selection for a precise imitation of the neighboring birds and variations arise in the males' songs. Moreover, because their songs vary so much naturally, it decreases the overall variation over large geographic scales and wrens from all over North America can communicate with each other regardless of which population they came from.  Diet  Sedge wren forage on the ground for insects and spiders. They eat many types of insects such as moths, flies and grasshoppers.  Migration  Sedge wrens are short-distance and nocturnal migrants. They leave their wintering grounds between early April and mid-May and usually arrive at their breeding grounds between mid-April and mid-May. They will typically leave their breeding grounds when frost reduces significantly the abundance of insects. They depart anywhere from August in the northern part of their range to the end of October in the central states to arrive in their wintering grounds starting in early September. = Dual breeding migration = There is some evidence that some sedge wrens may go through a second migration during the breeding season to breed at a second location. Sedge wrens were observed arriving and breeding from mid to late summer in the Central Plains of the United States and in Iowa where they were previously absent in early summer. It is however not actually known if these birds bred somewhere else before. There are several hypotheses to explain this potential second migration. One hypothesis is that these birds are coming from the northern part of their range where shorter summers prevents them from having a second brood in the same location. Another similar hypothesis is that these birds come from various locations where the environmental conditions changed and were no longer suitable for raising a second brood. A final hypothesis is that males that were not able to breed at their previous location relocate to the central plains. They will then wait for the arrival of females that are relocating and try to breed with them.  Reproduction  Some males are polygynous while others are monogamous. Polygynous males are usually more successful than monogamous males because breeding with multiple females increases their number of offspring. Males arrive earlier than females at breeding sites to establish territories and the ones defending territories with more nesting sites and food usually attract more females. Males are also the ones building the nests. They build multiple nests which serve for nesting, as dormitories and as decoys for predators. The females will then add a lining of grass, sedge and feathers to the nest she chooses. Nests are round globes of dried grass with a round opening on the side. They are usually built in grasses and sedges about one or two feet above ground or shallow water. Females usually lay seven eggs but it can vary from one to ten eggs which she incubates for 12‚Äì16 days. The eggs are oval shaped with no markings and measure on average . The young hatchlings are altricial. The females do most of the parental care and feeding whilst the males continue to build nests and display for other females. However, males will also occasionally feed the young. The young leave the nest after 11‚Äì16 days. Some early breeding females can also have a second brood later in the season.

She is believed to have been born in 1630 or a little later at Roch Castle near Haverfordwest, Wales, into a family of middling gentry. The question of whether King Charles had secretly married Lucy Walter was raised during the Exclusion Crisis, when a Protestant faction wished to make her son the heir to the throne, while the king denied any marriage, and supported the claim of his brother, the Duke of York. Biography Lucy Walter was born into a family of middling Welsh gentry. She was the daughter of William Walter (died 1650) of Roch Castle, near Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, and his wife Elizabeth (died 1652), daughter of John Prothero and niece of John Vaughan, 1st Earl of Carbery. She is said to have been born at Roch Castle in 1630. In 1644, the castle having been taken and destroyed by the parliamentary forces, she sought refuge in London, whence she took shipping for The Hague. Algernon Sidney told James, Duke of York, that he had given fifty gold pieces for her, but, having to join his regiment hastily, had missed his bargain. His brother, Colonel Robert Sidney secured the prize, but did not retain it long. During the summer of 1648 this \\"private Welshwoman\\", as Clarendon calls her, \\"of no good fame, but handsome\\", captivated the then Prince of Wales (later Charles II), who was at The Hague for a short while about this time. He was only eighteen, and she is often spoken of as his first mistress, but there seems good reason to suppose that he had a tryst as early as 1646, cites Gardiner, Hist. of Civil War, iii. 238; Boero, Istoria...di Carlo II, Rome, 1863. James II admits Lucy's good looks, adding that, though she had not much wit, she had a great deal of that sort of cunning which those of her profession usually have. On 9 April 1649, Lucy's son, James, the future Duke of Monmouth, was born in Rotterdam and recognised by Charles as his natural son. In August 1649 the respectable John Evelyn travelled with Lucy in Lord Wilmot's coach from Paris to Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and speaks of her as \\"a brown, beautiful, bold but insipid creature\\". cites Evelyn, 2.561‚Äì2. During July and August 1649 she was with Charles at Paris and Saint-Germain, and she may have accompanied him to Jersey in September. In June 1650 Charles left her at The Hague upon embarkation for Scotland. During his absence Lucy had an affair with Theobald, 2nd Viscount Taaffe, with whom she had a daughter, Mary (born 1651). After his defeat at the Battle of Worcester in late 1651, Charles escaped from England and returned to the Continent. He made it clear to Lucy that their relationship was ended. At first she attempted to persuade Dr John Cosin that she was a convert, cites Macpherson, i. 76. but that did not work. For about four years, she was involved in one scandal after another, causing so much embarrassment to the royal court in exile, that early in 1656 when she was in Cologne, the king's friends, by a promise of a pension of five thousand livres (¬£400 a year), persuaded her to return with her children to England. She sailed from Flushing and obtained lodgings in London over a barber's shop near Somerset House. cites Thurloe, State Papers, v. 160, 169. The Lord Protector's intelligence department promptly reported her as a suspected spy, and at the close of June 1656 she and her maid, Ann Hill, were arrested and sent to the Tower of London. On 16 July, after examination, she was discharged and ordered to be deported back to the Low Countries. cites Mercure historique et politique. No. 318. Once back on the Continent, she travelled to Brussels and resumed her extravagant lifestyle. Her attempt to use her son as a means of influencing Charles failed. However, after the court party botched an attempt to kidnap the boy, she was persuaded in March 1658 to hand him over to a royal tutor. In September of the same year‚Äîafter making a general confession to John Cosin‚Äîshe died in Paris probably of venereal disease and was buried there. Children She is known to have had two children: # James, born at Rotterdam on 9 April 1649, who was on 14 February 1663 created Duke of Monmouth. # Mary, (by Taaffe ?), born at The Hague on 6 May 1651, who married William Sarsfield, elder brother of Patrick, Earl of Lucan, and, secondly, William Fanshawe (died 1708), master of requests, with whom she had children. Exclusion Bill and allegations of marriage to Charles II Between 1673 and 1680 (while the Exclusion Bill agitation was maturing) a legend was prepared and industriously circulated by the country party to the effect that Charles had legally married Lucy Walter. It was asseverated in course of time that the contract of marriage was preserved in a black box in the possession of Sir Gilbert Gerard, son-in-law of John Cosin (the bishop himself had died in 1672). In a novel which had a wide circulation it was the designing Prince of Purdino (James) who advised his brother, King Conradus of Otenia, to marry the beautiful \\"Lucilious\\", but, to avoid disgusting the Otenians, to do so with the greatest privacy imaginable, and in the presence of but two witnesses, himself and the priest (Cosin). cites The Perplex'd Prince, London, 1681? 12mo, dedicated to William, lord Russell, by T. S. Sir Gilbert Gerard, summoned before an extraordinary meeting of the Privy Council convened by King Charles II, stated that he knew nothing whatever of such a marriage contract; and the King issued three declarations in denial of the marriage (January, March, and June 1678). One of these declarations, signed by sixteen Privy Councillors, was entered in the council book and registered in chancery.

He assassinated Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) representatives Pavle Radiƒá and ƒêuro Basariƒçek and mortally wounded HSS leader Stjepan Radiƒá in a shooting which took place on the floor of the Yugoslav parliament on 20 June 1928. He was tried and handed a sixty- year sentence, which was immediately reduced to twenty years. He served most of his sentence under house arrest and was killed by the Yugoslav Partisans in October 1944. Early life and political career Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá was born on 12 July 1886 in the village of Slatina, near Andrijevica, Principality of Montenegro. He entered the employ of politician Nikola Pa≈°iƒá as a sixteen- year-old in 1902. Pa≈°iƒá regarded Raƒçiƒá as a son and encouraged his political ambitions. Raƒçiƒá became active in Serbian nationalist circles and claimed to have organized assassination attempts against King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, King Constantine I of Greece and Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany. Following World War I, he earned a reputation for suppressing pro-Bulgarian movements in Macedonia. He was one of many Chetnik leaders who formed Serbian cultural societies in the region. On 27 September 1927, he was elected to the parliament of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as a representative of the People's Radical Party (NRS). Raƒçiƒá is reported to have had connections with the ruling Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty. He was the leader of the Association of Serbian Chetniks \\"Petar Mrkonjiƒá\\" ‚Äì For King and Fatherland until 1928. The movement was established following a split in the Chetniks in 1924 and built up a vast network across Bosnia and Herzegovina in the ensuing years. It maintained a close relationship with the Serbian National Youth (, SRNAO). Parliament shooting Puni≈°a Raƒçiƒá, 1926 Raƒçiƒá shooting a member of parliament, 20 June 1928. On 19 June 1928, Raƒçiƒá and twenty-three of his colleagues requested that Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) leader Stjepan Radiƒá be examined by doctors to determine if he was mentally ill and, if it was discovered that he was not, that he be punished to the maximum extent for describing several Serbian ministers as \\"plunderers\\", \\"bandits\\" and \\"outlaws\\" and thus violating the parliament's rules of procedure. At that day's session of parliament, Raƒçiƒá and fellow Serbian radical Toma Popoviƒá shouted: \\"Heads are going to roll here and until someone kills Stjepan Radiƒá there can be no peace.\\" The atmosphere that day prompted Radiƒá to remark that \\"a psychological mood for murder\\" was being created. Several individuals in Serbia had made death threats against Radiƒá in the preceding days. The Croatian People's Party (, HPS), which stood opposed to Radiƒá's anti-Clericalism and pan-Slavic ideas, also called for his removal from public life. Serbian newspapers such as Politika (Politics), Samouprava (Self-administration) and Jedinstvo (Unity) demonized Croat politicians, including Radiƒá, and called for their murder. Out of caution, Radiƒá was quieter than usual at the following evening's session of parliament. A verbal confrontation erupted that night when HSS deputy Ivan Pernar shouted insults at several Serbian politicians, questioning their wartime record and suggesting they were responsible for committing atrocities. Croatian politician Lubomir Ma≈°toviƒá then made a speech protesting how the death threats against Radiƒá made by Popoviƒá and Raƒçiƒá the previous day had gone unpunished by the president of the Assembly, Ninko Periƒá. Popoviƒá responded by saying \\"...if Stjepan Radiƒá, who shames the Croatian people, further continues with his insults, I guarantee that his head will fall.\\" The opposition benches reacted by shouting insults and death threats at the NRS party deputies, who responded in similar fashion. Periƒá ordered a five-minute recess and retreated to his private chamber, where he spoke with Raƒçiƒá. Raƒçiƒá was given the floor when the session was resumed. In his speech, he asserted that Serbian interests had never been in greater danger and stated that he would not refrain from using \\"other weapons, as need be, to defend the interests of Serbdom\\". Opposing politicians, especially Pernar, responded by taunting Raƒçiƒá and shouting as he spoke. Raƒçiƒá demanded that Periƒá penalize those jeering at his speech. Pernar then shouted \\"you plundered beys!\\", accusing Raƒçiƒá of looting Muslim homes in Macedonia. Seeing that Periƒá was not going to reprimand Pernar, Raƒçiƒá reached into his pocket and produced a handgun. The Minister of Justice, Milorad Vujiƒçiƒá, who was sitting behind the podium, grabbed Raƒçiƒá by the back while the former Minister of Religion, Obradoviƒá, seized his right shoulder. Raƒçiƒá pushed both men away and shot Pernar first. He then turned his attention to Ivan Granƒëa and shot him. He attempted to shoot Svetozar Pribiƒáeviƒá just as HSS deputy ƒêuro Basariƒçek jumped to the podium. Raƒçiƒá aimed at Pribiƒáeviƒá but shot Basariƒçek instead. He then shot Radiƒá in the hand and stomach. Radiƒá's nephew, Pavle, rushed to help his uncle. Upon seeing him, Raƒçiƒá yelled \\"I was waiting for you!\\" and shot him at point-blank range. He then fled the chamber. Basariƒçek and Radiƒá's nephew died immediately. Pernar and Granƒëa were wounded but survived. Radiƒá was seriously wounded and was taken to hospital immediately, where he was visited by King Alexander I. Aftermath Demonstrations erupted in Zagreb at the news of the shooting. Five people were killed and many more were wounded in clashes with police in the ten days following the attack. Deputies from the HSS‚ÄìDemocratic Party coalition withdrew from the parliament in protest. The shooting was the most significant political murder of Croat politicians during the inter-war period. It destroyed popular support for the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in Croatia. On 4 August, the editor of Jedinstvo‚Äîone of the newspapers which had called for the murder of Radiƒá and Pribiƒáeviƒá‚Äîwas assassinated by Josip Suniƒá, a member of the youth wing of the Croatian Party of Rights (, HSP). Radiƒá was operated on shortly after he was shot and his surgeon predicted that he would recover. Within two months of the shooting, his condition deteriorated unexpectedly and he died on 8 August 1928. Vladko Maƒçek, Radiƒá's successor as head of the HSS, suggested that diabetes had led to an infection which caused his heart to fail and suggested this as his cause of death. A week before his death, Radiƒá had alleged that Raƒçiƒá was only the executor of \\"a plot conceived of and agreed to in one part of the Radical [parliamentary] club\\" and stated that his shooting had likely occurred with the knowledge and approval of Periƒá and Prime Minister Velimir Vukiƒáeviƒá. Raƒçiƒá was celebrated as a hero through much of Serbia. He turned himself into the authorities shortly after the shooting and was tried and sentenced to 60 years in prison. This was immediately reduced to 20 years. His shooting of HSS deputies led to King Alexander suspending the Vidovdan Constitution on 6 January 1929, renaming the country to Yugoslavia and proclaiming a royal dictatorship. Later life and death Raƒçiƒá spent most of his sentence under house arrest in a comfortable villa, where he was attended by three servants and was free to enter and leave at will. The leniency of his sentence likely came as a result of his connection with the Chetniks. He was released from house arrest on 27 March 1941. The Usta≈°e used Raƒçiƒá's shooting of Croatian deputies as one of their excuses for persecuting and massacring Serbs during World War II. Raƒçiƒá was killed by the Yugoslav Partisans on 16 October 1944 during the liberation of Belgrade from the Axis powers.

In Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, philia is usually translated as \\"friendship\\" or affection.Liddell and Scott: œÜŒπŒªŒØŒ± The complete opposite is called a phobia.  Aristotle's view  As Gerard Hughes points out, in Books VIII and IX Aristotle gives examples of philia including: :\\"young lovers (1156b2), lifelong friends (1156b12), cities with one another (1157a26), political or business contacts (1158a28), parents and children (1158b20), fellow-voyagers and fellow-soldiers (1159b28), members of the same religious society (1160a19), or of the same tribe (1161b14), a cobbler and the person who buys from him (1163b35).\\"Hughes, p. 168. All of these different relationships involve getting on well with someone, though Aristotle at times implies that something more like actual liking is required. When he is talking about the character or disposition that falls between obsequiousness or flattery on the one hand and surliness or quarrelsomeness on the other, he says that this state: :\\"has no name, but it would seem to be most like [philia]; for the character of the person in the intermediate state is just what we mean in speaking of a decent friend, except that the friend is also fond of us.\\" (1126b21) This passage indicates also that, though broad, the notion of philia must be mutual, and thus excludes relationships with inanimate objects, though philia with animals, such as pets, is allowed for (see 1155b27-31). In his Rhetoric, Aristotle defines the activity involved in philia (œÑ·Ω∏ œÜŒπŒªŒµ·øñŒΩ) as: :\\"wanting for someone what one thinks good, for his sake and not for one's own, and being inclined, so far as one can, to do such things for him\\" (1380b36-1381a2) John M. Cooper argues that this indicates: :\\"that the central idea of œÜŒπŒª√≠Œ± is that of doing well by someone for his own sake, out of concern for him (and not, or not merely, out of concern for oneself). [... Thus] the different forms of œÜŒπŒª√≠Œ± [as listed above] could be viewed just as different contexts and circumstances in which this kind of mutual well-doing can arise\\"Cooper, p. 302 Aristotle takes philia to be both necessary as a means to happiness (\\"no one would choose to live without friends even if he had all the other goods\\" [1155a5-6]) and noble or fine (Œ∫Œ±ŒªœåŒΩ) in itself. Types Aristotle divides friendships into three types, based on the motive for forming them: friendships of utility, friendships of pleasure and friendships of the good. Friendships of utility are relationships formed without regard to the other person at all. Buying merchandise, for example, may require meeting another person but usually needs only a very shallow relationship between the buyer and seller. In modern English, people in such a relationship would not even be called friends, but acquaintances (if they even remembered each other afterwards). The only reason these people are communicating is in order to buy or sell things, which is not a bad thing, but as soon as that motivation is gone, so goes the relationship between the two people unless another motivation is found. Complaints and quarrels generally only arise in this type of friendship. At the next level, friendships of pleasure are based on pure delight in the company of other people. People who drink together or share a hobby may have such friendships. However, these friends may also part‚Äîin this case if they no longer enjoy the shared activity, or can no longer participate in it together. Friendships of the good are ones where both friends enjoy each other's characters. As long as both friends keep similar characters, the relationship will endure since the motive behind it is care for the friend. This is the highest level of philia, and in modern English might be called true friendship. :\\"Now it is possible for bad people as well [as good] to be friends to each other for pleasure or utility, for decent people to be friends to base people, and for someone with neither character to be a friend to someone with any character. Clearly, however, only good people can be friends to each other because of the other person himself; for bad people find no enjoyment in one another if they get no benefit.\\" (1157a18-21) Not all bonds of philia involves reciprocity Aristotle notes. Some examples of these might include love of father to son, elder to younger or ruler to subject. Generally though, the bonds of philia are symmetrical.Happiness: Personhood, Community, Purpose By Pedro Alexis Tabensky, Published by Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2003, , , page 205 If philia is a type of love, Thomas Jay Oord has argued that it must be defined so as not to contradict love. Oord defines philia as an intentional response to promote well-being when cooperating with or befriending others. And his philia is not only that meaning. The philia also gives humans authentic friendship.\\"Introduction - Perspectives on Love and Agap√©: Contemporary Views on Love\\" by Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., p.9 Self-sufficiency Aristotle recognizes that there is an apparent conflict between what he says about philia and what he says elsewhere (and what is widely held at the time) about the self-sufficient nature of the fulfilled life: :\\"it is said that the blessedly happy and self-sufficient people have no need of friends. For they already have [all] the goods, and hence, being self-sufficient, need nothing added.\\" (1169b4-6) He offers various answers. The first is based on the inherent goodness of acting for and being concerned for others (\\"the excellent person labours for his friends and for his native country, and will die for them if he must\\" [1169a19-20]); thus, being a wholly virtuous and fulfilled person necessarily involves having others for whom one is concerned--without them, one's life is incomplete: :\\"the solitary person's life is hard, since it is not easy for him to be continuously active all by himself; but in relation to others and in their company it is easier.\\" (1170a6-8) Aristotle's second answer is: \\"good people's life together allows the cultivation of virtue\\" (1170a12). Finally, he argues that one's friend is \\"another oneself,\\" and so the pleasure that the virtuous person gets from his own life is also found in the life of another virtuous person. \\"Anyone who is to be happy, then, must have excellent friends\\" (1170b19). Altruism and egoism For Aristotle, in order to feel the highest form of philia for another, one must feel it for oneself; the object of philia is, after all, \\"another oneself.\\" This alone does not commit Aristotle to egoism, of course. Not only is self-love not incompatible with love of others, but Aristotle is careful to distinguish the sort of self-love that is condemned (ascribed to \\"those who award the biggest share in money, honours, and bodily pleasures to themselves. For these are the goods desired and eagerly pursued by the many on the assumption that they are best\\" [1168b17-19]) from that which should be admired (ascribed to one who \\"is always eager above all to perform just or temperate actions or any other actions in accord with the virtues, and in general always gains for himself what is fine [noble, good]\\" [1168b25-27]). In fact: :\\"the good person must be a self-lover, since he will both help himself and benefit others by performing fine actions. But the vicious person must not love himself, since he will harm both himself and his neighbours by following his base feelings.\\" (1169a12-15) Aristotle also holds, though, that, as Hughes puts it: \\"[t]he only ultimately justifiable reason for doing anything is that acting in that way will contribute to a fulfilled life.\\"Hughes, pp 173-174. Thus acts of philia might seem to be essentially egoistic, performed apparently to help others, but in fact intended to increase the agent's happiness. This, however, confuses the nature of the action with its motivation; the good person doesn't perform an action to help a friend because it will give her fulfillment; she performs it in order to help the friend, and in performing it makes both her friend and herself happy. The action is thus good both in itself and for the effect it has on the agent's happiness.See Hughes, pp 175-176\\\\. For an alternative view, see Kraut, chapter 2.

In the late 1970s, in the 2 tone ska there was a revival of rude boy and rude girl terms in England, among other variations, being used to describe fans of that genre. This use of the word moved into the more contemporary ska punk movement as well. In the UK, the terms rude boy and rude girl are used in a similar way to gangsta or badman.Neville Staple (2009) Original Rude Boy, Aurum Press. Jamaica Prince Buster performing at the Cardiff Festival, Cardiff, UK The rude boy subculture arose from the poorer sections of Kingston, Jamaica, and was associated with violent discontented youths. Along with ska and rocksteady music, many rude boys favored sharp suits, thin ties, and pork pie or Trilby hats, showing an influence of the fashions of American jazz musicians and soul music artists. American cowboy and gangster/outlaw films from that period were also influential factors in shaping the rude boy image, as scholars like Rob Wilson, Christopher Leigh Connory, and Deborah A. Thomas have shown.Thomas, Deborah A. Modern blackness: nationalism, globalization, and the politics of culture in Jamaica In that time period, unemployed Jamaican youths sometimes found temporary employment from sound system operators to disrupt competitors' dances (leading to the term dancehall crasher). The violence that sometimes occurred at dances and its association with the rude boy lifestyle gave rise to a slew of releases by artists who addressed the rude boys directly with lyrics that either promoted or rejected rude boy violence. Starting in the 1970s, Jamaican reggae music replaced the ska and rocksteady music associated with the rude boys. In the 1980s, dancehall became the main Jamaican popular music genre, drawing some parallels with the earlier rude boys in its culture and lyrical content. United Kingdom In the 1960s, the Jamaican diaspora introduced rude boy music and fashion to the United Kingdom, which influenced the mod and skinhead subcultures. In the late 1970s, the term rude boy and rude boy fashions came back into use after the 2 tone band the Specials and their record label 2 Tone Records instigated a brief but influential ska revival.Panter, Horace.

They speak the Macedonian language, a South Slavic language. About two thirds of all ethnic Macedonians live in North Macedonia and there are also communities in a number of other countries.

Following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the decisive point in the ethnogenesis of the South Slavic ethnic group was the creation of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia after World War II, a state in the framework of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. This was followed by the development of a separate Macedonian language and national literature, and the foundation of a distinct Macedonian Orthodox Church and national historiography. Ancient and Roman period In antiquity, much of central-northern Macedonia (the Vardar basin) was inhabited by Paionians who expanded from the lower Strymon basin. The Pelagonian plain was inhabited by the Pelagones, an ancient Greek tribe of Upper Macedonia; whilst the western region (Ohrid-Prespa) was said to have been inhabited by Illyrian tribes.A J Toynbee.

Roman conquest brought with it a significant Romanization of the region. During the Dominate period, 'barbarian' federates were settled on Macedonian soil at times; such as the Sarmatians settled by Constantine (330s AD)Peter Heather, Goths and Romans 332‚Äì489. p. 129 or the (10 year) settlement of Alaric's Goths.Macedonia in Late Antiquity p. 551. In A Companion to Ancient Macedonia. Wiley -Blackwell, 2011 In contrast to 'frontier provinces', Macedonia (north and south) continued to be a flourishing Christian, Roman province in Late Antiquity and into the early Middle Ages. Medieval period Linguistically, the South Slavic languages from which Macedonian developed are thought to have expanded in the region during the post-Roman period, although the exact mechanisms of this linguistic expansion remains a matter of scholarly discussion. Traditional historiography has equated these changes with the commencement of raids and 'invasions' of Sclaveni and Antes from Wallachia and western Ukraine during the 6th and 7th centuries. However, recent anthropological and archaeological perspectives have viewed the appearance of Slavs in Macedonia, and throughout the Balkans in general, as part of a broad and complex process of transformation of the cultural, political and ethno-linguistic Balkan landscape after the collapse of Roman authority. The exact details and chronology of population shifts remain to be determined.T E Gregory, A History of Byzantium. Wiley- Blackwell, 2010. p. 169 What is beyond dispute is that, in contrast to \\"barbarian\\" Bulgaria, northern Macedonia remained Roman in its cultural outlook into the 7th century. Yet at the same time, sources attest numerous Slavic tribes in the environs of Thessaloniki and further afield, including the Berziti in Pelagonia.Florin Curta.

After the final Ottoman conquest of the Balkans by the Ottomans in the 14/15th century, all Eastern Orthodox Christians were included in a specific ethno- religious community under Graeco-Byzantine jurisdiction called Rum Millet. The belonging to this religious commonwealth was so important that most of the common people began to identify themselves as Christians. However ethnonyms never disappeared and some form of primary ethnic identity was available.Balkan cultural commonality and ethnic diversity. Raymond Detrez (Ghent University, Belgium). This is confirmed from a Sultan's Firman from 1680 which describes the ethnic groups in the Balkan territories of the Empire as follows: Greeks, Albanians, Serbs, Vlachs and Bulgarians.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—Ç–µ. –ö—ä—Å–Ω–æ —Å—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–æ–≤–µ–∫–æ–≤–∏–µ –∏ –í—ä–∑—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω–µ, —Ç–æ–º 2, –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏ –ë–∞–∫–∞–ª–æ–≤, TRUD Publishers, 2004, , —Å—Ç—Ä. 23. (Bg.) The rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century brought opposition to this continued situation. At that time the classical Rum Millet began to degrade. The coordinated actions, carried out by Bulgarian national leaders supported by the majority of the Slavic-speaking population in today Republic of North Macedonia in order to be recognized as a separate ethnic entity, constituted the so-called \\"Bulgarian Millet\\", recognized in 1870.The A to Z of the Ottoman Empire, Selcuk Aksin Somel, Scarecrow Press, 2010, , p. 168. At the time of its creation, people living in Vardar Macedonia, were not in the Exarchate. However, as a result of plebiscites held between 1872 and 1875, the Slavic districts in the area voted overwhelmingly (over 2/3) to go over to the new national Church.The Politics of Terror: The MacEdonian Liberation Movements, 1893‚Äì1903, Duncan M. Perry, Duke University Press, 1988, , p. 15. Referring to the results of the plebiscites, and on the basis of statistical and ethnological indications, the 1876 Conference of Constantinople included most of Macedonia into the Bulgarian ethnic territory.The A to Z of Bulgaria, Raymond Detrez, Scarecrow Press, 2010, , p. 271. The borders of new Bulgarian state, drawn by the 1878 Treaty of San Stefano, also included Macedonia, but the treaty was never put into effect and the Treaty of Berlin (1878) \\"returned\\" Macedonia to the Ottoman Empire.  Genetics  Anthropologically, Macedonians possess genetic lineages postulated to represent Balkan prehistoric and historic demographic processes. Such lineages are also typically found in other South Slavs, especially Bulgarians, Serbs, Bosniaks and Montenegrins, but also in Greeks and Romanians. Y-DNA studies suggest that Macedonians along with neighboring South Slavs are distinct from other Slavic- speaking populations in Europe and a majority of their Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups are likely to be inherited from inhabitants of the Balkans that predated sixth-century Slavic migrations. A diverse set of Y-DNA haplogroups are found in Macedonians at significant levels, including I2a1b, E-V13, J2a, R1a1, R1b, G2a, encoding a complex pattern of demographic processes.Renata Jankova et al., Y-chromosome diversity of the three major ethno-linguistic groups in the Republic of North Macedonia; Forensic Science International: Genetics; Volume 42, September 2019, Pages 165‚Äì170. Similar distributions of the same haplogroups are found in neighboring populations.Trombetta B. \\"Phylogeographic Refinement and Large Scale Genotyping of Human Y Chromosome Haplogroup E Provide New Insights into the Dispersal of Early Pastoralists in the African Continent\\" http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/7/1940.long R1a1 and I2a1b are typically found in Slavic-speaking populations across EuropeAnatole Klyosov, DNA Genealogy; Scientific Research Publishing, Inc. USA, 2018; , p. 211. (Supplementary Table 4) while haplogroups such as E-V13 and J2 occur at high frequencies in neighboring non-Slavic populations. On the other hand R1b is the most frequently occurring haplogroup in Western Europe and G2a is most frequently found in Caucasus and the adjacent areas. Genetic similarity, irrespective of language and ethnicity, has a strong correspondence to geographic proximity in European populations. In regard to population genetics, not all regions of Southeastern Europe had the same ratio of native Byzantine and invading Slavic population, with the territory of the Eastern Balkans (Macedonia, Thrace and Moesia) having a higher percentages of locals compared to Slavs. Considering the majority of the Balkan Slavs came via the Eastern Carpathian route, lower percentage on east does not imply that the number of the Slavs there was lesser than among the Western South Slavs. Most probably on the territory of Western South Slavs was a state of desolation which produced there a founder effect.Florin Curta's An ironic smile: the Carpathian Mountains and the migration of the Slavs, Studia mediaevalia Europaea et orientalia.

Identities The large majority of Macedonians identify as Eastern Orthodox Christians, who speak a South Slavic language, and share a cultural and historical \\"Orthodox Byzantine‚ÄìSlavic heritage\\" with their neighbours. The concept of a \\"Macedonian\\" ethnicity, distinct from their Orthodox Balkan neighbours, is seen to be a comparatively newly emergent one. The earliest manifestations of incipient Macedonian identity emerged during the second half of the 19th century among limited circles of Slavic-speaking intellectuals, predominantly outside the region of Macedonia. They arose after the First World War and especially during 1930s, and thus were consolidated by Communist Yugoslavia's governmental policy after the Second World War.

However, in pre- nationalist times, terms such as \\"Bulgarian\\" did not possess a strict ethno- nationalistic meaning, rather, they were loose, often interchangeable terms which could simultaneously denote regional habitation, allegiance to a particular empire, religious orientation, membership in certain social groups. Similarly, a \\"Byzantine\\" was a Roman subject of Constantinople, and the term bore no strict ethnic connotations, Greek or otherwise.The Edinburgh History of the Greeks; 500‚Äì1250: The Middle Ages. Florin Curta. 2013. p. 294 (echoing Anthony D Smith and Anthony Kaldellis) \\"no clear notion exists that the Greek nation survived into Byzantine times...the ethnic identity of those who lived in Greece during the Middle Ages is best described as Roman.\\" Overall, in the Middle Ages, \\"a person's origin was distinctly regional\\",Mats Roslund. Guests in the House: Cultural Transmission Between Slavs and Scandinavians; 2008. p. 79 and in Ottoman era, before the 19th-century rise of nationalism, it was based on the corresponding confessional community. After the rise of nationalism, most of the Slavic-speaking population in the area, joined the Bulgarian community, through voting in its favor on a plebiscites held during the 1870s, by a qualified majority (over two-thirds). 19th-century emergence With the creation of the Bulgarian Principality in 1878, the Macedonian upper stratum had to decide whether Macedonia was to emerge as an independent state or as part of a \\"Greater Bulgaria\\". During this period, the first expressions of Macedonism by certain Macedonian intellectuals occurred in Belgrade, Sofia, Istanbul, Thessaloniki and St. Petersburg. In the 1860s, according to Petko Slaveykov, some young intellectuals from Macedonia were claiming that they are not Bulgarians, but they are rather Macedonians, descendants of the Ancient Macedonians.The Macedonian Question an article from 1871 by Petko Slaveykov published in the newspaper Macedonia in Carigrad (now Istanbul). In this article Petko Slaveykov writes: \\"We have many times heard from the Macedonists that they are not Bulgarians, but they are rather Macedonians, descendants of the Ancient Macedonians.\\" In a letter written to the Bulgarian Exarch in February 1874 Petko Slaveykov reports that discontent with the current situation ‚Äúhas given birth among local patriots to the disastrous idea of working independently on the advancement of their own local dialect and what‚Äôs more, of their own, separate Macedonian church leadership.‚ÄùA letter from Slaveykov to the Bulgarian Exarch written in Solun in February 1874 The activities of these people were also registered by Stojan Novakoviƒá.–ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞ –ø–∏—Ç–∞—ö–∞ –∏ –º–∞—ö–µ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò—Å–∫–æ-–ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–∫–µ –±–µ–ª–µ—à–∫–µ –æ –ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ–º –ø–æ–ª—É–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–≤—É 1886‚Äì1905. –°—Ç–æ—ò–∞–Ω –ù–æ–≤–∞–∫–æ–≤–∏—õ, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥, 1906. The nascent Macedonian nationalism, illegal at home in the theocratic Ottoman Empire, and illegitimate internationally, waged a precarious struggle for survival against overwhelming odds: in appearance against the Ottoman Empire, but in fact against the three expansionist Balkan states and their respective patrons among the great powers. The first prominent author that propagated the concept of a Macedonian ethnicity was Georgi Pulevski, who in 1875 published Dictionary of Three languages: Macedonian, Albanian, Turkish, in which he wrote: On the other hand, Theodosius of Skopje, a priest who have hold a high- ranking positions within the Bulgarian Exarchate was chosen as a bishop of the episcopacy of Skopje in 1885. As a bishop of Skopje, Theodosius renounced de facto the Bulgarian Exarchate and attempted to restore the Archbishopric of Ohrid as a separate Macedonian Orthodox Church in all eparchies of Macedonia,Theodosius of Skopje Centralen D'rzhaven istoricheski archiv (Sofia) 176, op. 1. arh.ed. 595, l.5‚Äì42 ‚Äì Razgledi, X/8 (1968), pp. 996‚Äì1000. responsible for the spiritual, cultural and educational life of all Macedonian Orthodox Christians. During this time period Metropolitan Bishop Theodosius of Skopje made several pleas to the Bulgarian church to allow a separate Macedonian church, and ultimately on 4 December 1891 he sent a letter to the Pope Leo XIII to ask for a recognition and a protection from the Roman Catholic Church. In 1892 the local Bulgarian Exarchate parish school council in the city of Kastoria (then Kostur) adopted the proposal of a group of teachers \\"to eliminate both Bulgarian and Greek and introduce local dialectPeter Trudgill, Sociolinguistic Variation and Change; University Press, 2002; , p. 132. as the language of instruction in the town school,\\" but the idea failed the same year.A Companion to Ancient Macedonia, Joseph Roisman, Ian Worthington.

In 1903 Krste Petkov Misirkov published his book On Macedonian Matters in which he laid down the principles of the modern Macedonian nationhood and language. This book written in the standardized central dialect of Macedonia is considered by ethnic Macedonians as a milestone of the ethnic Macedonian identity and the apogee of the process of Macedonian awakening. In his article \\"Macedonian Nationalism\\" he wrote: Misirkov argued that the dialect of central Macedonia (Veles-Prilep-Bitola- Ohrid)On Macedonian Matters ‚Äì A few works on the Macedonian literary language should be taken as a standard Macedonian literary language, in which Macedonians should write, study, and worship; the autocephalous Archbishopric of Ohrid should be restored; and the Slavic people of Macedonia should be identified in their Ottoman identity cards (nofuz) as \\"Macedonians\\". The next great figure of the Macedonian awakening was Dimitrija ƒåupovski, one of the founders of the Macedonian Literary Society, established in Saint Petersburg in 1902. In the period 1913‚Äì1918, ƒåupovski published the newspaper –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫i –ì–æ–ª–æ—Å—ä (Macedonian Voice) in which he and fellow members of the Petersburg Macedonian Colony propagated the existence of a Macedonian people separate from the Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbs, and sought to popularize the idea for an independent Macedonian state. 20th-century development After the Balkan Wars, following division of the region of Macedonia amongst the Kingdom of Greece, the Kingdom of Bulgaria and the Kingdom of Serbia, and after World War I, the idea of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation was further spread among the Slavic-speaking population. The suffering during the wars, the endless struggle of the Balkan monarchies for dominance over the population increased the Macedonians' sentiment that the institutionalization of an independent Macedonian nation would put an end to their suffering. On the question of whether they were Serbs or Bulgarians, the people more often started answering: \\"Neither Bulgar, nor Serb... I am Macedonian only, and I'm sick of war.\\"–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò–∞ –Ω–∞ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏—ò–∞. –ë–ª–∞–∂–µ –†–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏, 1999, –°–∫–æ–ø—ò–µ.\\"On the Monastir Road\\".

Stratis Myrivilis, an important Greek writer, in his Life in the Tomb, from his experiences as a soldier in the Macedonian front (1916‚Äì18), described also the self-identitification of the local population: \\"...They don't want to be called Bulgar, neither Srrp, neither Grrts.

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%), mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called May Manifesto, in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.Victor Roudometof, Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History), Praeger, 2001, p.187 In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United) was created, composed of former left-wing Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) members. This organization promoted in the early 1930s the existence of a separate ethnic Macedonian nation.The Situation in Macedonia and the Tasks of IMRO (United) ‚Äì published in the official newspaper of IMRO (United), \\"–ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Å–∫–æ –¥–µ–ª–æ\\", N.185, April 1934.

This action was attacked by the IMRO, but was supported by the Balkan communists. The Balkan communist parties supported the national consolidation of the ethnic Macedonian people and created Macedonian sections within the parties, headed by prominent IMRO (United) members. The sense of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation gained credence during World War II when ethnic Macedonian communist partisan detachments were formed. In 1943 the Communist Party of Macedonia was established and the resistance movement grew up. After the World War II ethnic Macedonian institutions were created in the three parts of the region of Macedonia, then under communist control,History of the Balkans, Vol. 2: Twentieth Century. Barbara Jelavich, 1983. including the establishment of the People's Republic of Macedonia within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ). The available data indicates that despite the policy of assimilation, pro-Bulgarian sentiments among the Macedonian Slavs in Yugoslavia were still sizable during the interwar period. However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in post-World War II Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced Serbianisation was changed with a new one ‚Äî of Macedonization. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any Bulgarophilia among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt de-Bulgarization of the people in the PR Macedonia, such as it already had conducted in the Vardar Banovina during the Interwar period. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor, and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which during the times of Communist Yugoslavia, increased to the level of state policy. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out. 21st- century uncertainty Following the collapse of Yugoslavia, the issue of Macedonian identity has again emerged. Nationalists and governments alike from neighbouring countries (especially Greece and Bulgaria) espouse to the view that the creation of a Macedonian ethnicity is a modern, artificial creation. Such views have been seen by Macedonian historians to represent irredentist motives on Macedonian territory. Moreover, western historians are quick to point out that in fact all modern nations are recent, politically motivated constructs based on creation \\"myths\\".Smith A.D. The Antiquity of Nations. 2004, p. 47 The creation of Macedonian identity is \\"no more or less artificial than any other identity\\". Contrary to the claims of Romantic nationalists, modern, territorially bound and mutually exclusive nation states have little in common with the large territorial or dynastic medieval empires; and any connection between them is tenuous at best.Danforth, L. The Macedonian Conflict. Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World. p. 25 In any event, irrespective of shifting political affiliations, the Macedonian Slavs shared in the fortunes of the Byzantine commonwealth and the Rum millet and they can claim them as their heritage. Loring Danforth states similarly, the ancient heritage of modern Balkan countries is not \\"the mutually exclusive property of one specific nation\\" but \\"the shared inheritance of all Balkan peoples\\".Ancient Macedonia: National Symbols. L Danforth in A Companion to Ancient Macedonia. Wiley ‚ÄìBlackwell 2010. p. 597-8 A more radical and uncompromising strand of Macedonian nationalism has recently emerged called \\"ancient Macedonism\\", or \\"Antiquisation\\". Proponents of such views see modern Macedonians as direct descendants of the ancient Macedonians. This policy is facing criticism by academics as it demonstrates feebleness of archaeology and of other historical disciplines in public discourse, as well as a danger of marginalization of the Macedonian identity.The Handbook of Political Change in Eastern Europe, Sten Berglund, Edward Elgar Publishing, 2013, ,p. 622.Transforming National Holidays: Identity Discourse in the West and South Slavic Countries, 1985‚Äì2010, Ljiljana ≈†ariƒá, Karen Gammelgaard, Kjetil R√• Hauge, John Benjamins Publishing, 2012, , pp. 207‚Äì208. Surveys on the effects of the controversial nation-building project Skopje 2014 and on the perceptions of the population of Skopje revealed a high degree of uncertainty regarding the latter's national identity. A supplementary national poll showed that there was a great discrepancy between the population's sentiment and the narrative the state sought to promote. Additionally, during the last two decades, tens of thousands of citizens of North Macedonia have applied for Bulgarian citizenship.Sinisa Jakov Marusic, More Macedonians Apply for Bulgarian Citizenship.

Bulgaria has a special ethnic dual-citizenship regime, that makes a constitutional distinction between ethnic Bulgarians and Bulgarian citizens. In the case of the Macedonians, only declaring their national identity as Bulgarian is enough to gain a citizenship.Bulgaria which has an ethnic citizenship regime and has a liberal dual citizenship regime makes a constitutional distinction between Bulgarians and Bulgarian citizens, whereas the former category reflects an ethnic (blood) belonging and the later the civic (territorial) belonging. In line with this definition, naturalization in Bulgaria is facilitated for those individuals who can prove that they belong to the Bulgarian nation...The birth certificates of parents and grandparents, their mother tongue, membership in Bulgarian institutions as the Bulgarian Church, former Bulgarian citizenship of the parents and so on are relevant criteria for the establishment of the ethnic origin of the applicant. In the case of Macedonian citizens, declaring their national identity as Bulgarian suffices to obtain Bulgarian citizenship, without the requirement for permanent residence in Bulgaria, or the language examination etc. For more see: Jelena D≈æankiƒá, Citizenship in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia and Montenegro: Effects of Statehood and Identity Challenges, Southeast European Studies, Ashgate Publishing, 2015, , p. 126. By making the procedure simpler, Bulgaria stimulates more Macedonian citizens (of Slavic origin) to apply for a Bulgarian citizenship.Raymond Detrez, Historical Dictionary of Bulgaria, Historical Dictionaries of Europe, Rowman & Littlefield, 2014, , p. 318. Hereof the vast majority of the candidates has applied as Bulgarians by origin,Jo Shaw and Igor ≈†tiks as ed., Citizenship after Yugoslavia, Routledge, 2013, , p. 106. despite only a few of them have really close ties with Bulgaria.Rainer Baub√∂ck, Debating Transformations of National Citizenship, IMISCOE Research Series, Springer, 2018, , pp. 47‚Äì48. Bulgarian citizenship is usually attributed by the locals to gaining work access to member states of the European Union rather than illustrating Bulgarian identity.Michael Palairet, Macedonia: A Voyage through History (Vol. 2, From the Fifteenth Century to the Present), Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2016, , p. 347. This phenomenon is called placebo identity.Mina Hristova, In-between Spaces: Dual Citizenship and Placebo Identity at the Triple Border between Serbia, Macedonia and Bulgaria in New Diversities; Volume 21, No. 1, 2019, pp. 37-55. There are certain interpretations among the Macedonian public that this policy is part of a strategy maintained by Bulgaria for destabilizing Macedonian national identity.Risteski, L.

EUDO Citizenship Observatory, Robert Schuman Centre for Advanced Studies, p.20. Ethnonym The national name derives from the Greek term Makedon√≠a, related to the name of the region, named after the ancient Macedonians and their kingdom. It originates from the ancient Greek adjective makednos, meaning \\"tall\\",ŒºŒ±Œ∫ŒµŒ¥ŒΩœåœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus which shares its roots with the adjective makr√≥s, meaning the same.ŒºŒ±Œ∫œÅœåœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus The name is originally believed to have meant either \\"highlanders\\" or \\"the tall ones\\", possibly descriptive of these ancient people.Macedonia, Online Etymology DictionaryEugene N. Borza, Makedonika, Regina Books, , p.114: The \\"highlanders\\" or \\"Makedones\\" of the mountainous regions of western Macedonia are derived from northwest Greek stock; they were akin both to those who at an earlier time may have migrated south to become the historical \\"Dorians\\".Nigel Guy Wilson, Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece, Routledge, 2009, p.439: The latest archaeological findings have confirmed that Macedonia took its name from a tribe of tall, Greek-speaking people, the Makednoi. With the conquest of the Balkans by the Ottomans in the late 14th century, the name of Macedonia disappeared as a geographical designation for several centuries. The name was revived just during the early 19th century, after the foundation of the modern Greek state with its Western Europe-derived obsession with Ancient Greece.Jelavich Barbara, History of the Balkans, Vol. 2: Twentieth Century, 1983, Cambridge University Press, , page 91.John S. Koliopoulos, Thanos M. Veremis, Modern Greece: A History since 1821. A New History of Modern Europe, John Wiley & Sons, 2009, , p. 48. As result of the rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, massive Greek religious and school propaganda occurred, and a process of Hellenization was implemented among Slavic-speaking population of the area.Richard Clogg, Minorities in Greece: Aspects of a Plural Society. C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2002, , p. 160.Dimitar Bechev, Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Scarecrow Press, 2009, , Introduction, pp. VII- VIII. In this way, the name Macedonians was applied to the local Slavs, aiming to stimulate the development of close ties between them and the Greeks, linking both sides to the ancient Macedonians, as a counteract against the growing Bulgarian cultural influence into the region.J. Pettifer, The New Macedonian Question, St Antony's group, Springer, 1999, , pp. 49‚Äì51.Anastas Vangeli, Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia. Nationalities Papers, the Journal of Nationalism and Ethnicity, Volume 39, 2011 pp. 13‚Äì32. As a consequence since 1850s some Slavic intellectuals from the area, adopted the designation Macedonian as a regional identity, and it began to gain a popularity.Roumen Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov, Entangled Histories of the Balkans, Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies, BRILL, 2013, , pp. 283‚Äì285. Serbian politics then, also encouraged this kind of regionalism to neutralize the Bulgarian influx, thereby promoting Serbian interests there.Chris Kostov, Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900‚Äì1996, Peter Lang, 2010, , p. 65. In the early 20th century the local Bulgarians already called themselves Macedonians, and were called in this way by their neighbors.E. Damianopoulos, The Macedonians: Their Past and Present, Springer, 2012, , p. 185. During the interbellum Bulgaria also supported to some extent the Macedonian regional identity, especially in Yugoslavia. Its aim was to prevent the Serbianization of the local Slavic-speakers, because the very name Macedonia was prohibited in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.Donald Bloxham, The Final Solution: A Genocide, OUP Oxford, 2009, , p. 65.Chris Kostov, Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, Peter Lang, 2010, , p. 76. Ultimately the designation Macedonian, changed its status in 1944, and went from being predominantly a regional, ethnographic denomination, to a national one.Raymond Detrez, Pieter Plas, Developing cultural identity in the Balkans: convergence vs divergence, Volume 34 of Multiple Europesq Peter Lang, 2005, , p. 173. Population The vast majority of Macedonians live along the valley of the river Vardar, the central region of the Republic of North Macedonia. They form about 64.18% of the population of North Macedonia (1,297,981 people according to the 2002 census). Smaller numbers live in eastern Albania, northern Greece, and southern Serbia, mostly abutting the border areas of the Republic of North Macedonia. A large number of Macedonians have immigrated overseas to Australia, United States, Canada, New Zealand and in many European countries: Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Austria and Malta among others. BalkansGreece= The existence of an ethnic Macedonian minority in Greece is rejected by the Greek government. The number of people speaking Slavic dialects has been estimated at somewhere between 10,000 and 250,000. Most of these people however do not have an ethnic Macedonian national consciousness, with most choosing to identify as ethnic Greeks or rejecting both ethnic designations and preferring terms such as \\"natives\\" instead. In 1999 the Greek Helsinki Monitor estimated that the number of people identifying as ethnic Macedonians numbered somewhere between 10,000 and 30,000,Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (Greece) ‚Äì GREEK HELSINKI MONITOR (GHM) Macedonian sources generally claim the number of ethnic Macedonians living in Greece at somewhere between 200,000‚Äì350,000.L. M. Danforth, The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World 1995, Princeton University Press, p. 45 The ethnic Macedonians in Greece have faced difficulties from the Greek government in their ability to self-declare as members of a \\"Macedonian minority\\" and to refer to their native language as \\"Macedonian\\". Since the late 1980s there has been an ethnic Macedonian revival in Northern Greece, mostly centering on the region of Florina.Detrez, Raymond; Plas, Pieter (2005), Developing cultural identity in the Balkans: convergence vs divergence, Peter Lang, pp. 50 Since then ethnic Macedonian organisations including the Rainbow political party have been established.Second Macedonian newspaper in Greece ‚Äì \\"–í—Ç–æ—Ä –≤–µ—Å–Ω–∏–∫ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Ü–∏—Ç–µ –≤–æ –ì—Ä—Ü–∏—ò–∞...–í–µ—Å–Ω–∏–∫–æ—Ç —Å–µ –≤–∏–∫–∞ \\"–ó–∞–¥—Ä—É–≥–∞\\"...–ó–∞ –Ω–µ—Ü–µ–ª –º–µ—Å–µ—Ü –≤–æ –ì—Ä—Ü–∏—ò–∞ –∏–∑–ª–µ–∑–µ —É—à—Ç–µ –µ–¥–µ–Ω –≤–µ—Å–Ω–∏–∫ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Ü–∏—Ç–µ/A Second Macedonian Newspaper in greece...The Newspaper is Called \\"Zadruga/Koinothta\\"...Barely a month ago in Greece another newspaper for the Macedonians was released.\\" Rainbow first opened its offices in Florina on 6 September 1995.

Within Vojvodina, Macedonians are recognised under the Statute of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, along with other ethnic groups. Large Macedonian settlements within Vojvodina can be found in Plandi≈°te, Jabuka, Glogonj, Du≈æine and Kaƒçarevo. These people are mainly the descendants of economic migrants who left the Socialist Republic of Macedonia in the 1950s and 1960s. The Macedonians in Serbia are represented by a national council and in recent years the Macedonian language has begun to be taught. The most recent census recorded 22,755 Macedonians living in Serbia. =Albania= Macedonians represent the second largest ethnic minority population in Albania. Albania recognises the existence of a Macedonian minority within the Mala Prespa region, most of which is comprised by Pustec Municipality. Macedonians have full minority rights within this region, including the right to education and the provision of other services in the Macedonian language. There also exist unrecognised Macedonian populations living in the Golo Brdo region, the \\"Dolno Pole\\" area near the town of Peshkopi, around Lake Ohrid and Korce as well as in Gora. 4,697 people declared themselves Macedonians in the 1989 census.Artan Hoxha and Alma Gurraj, Local Self-Government and Decentralization: Case of Albania.

As regards self- identification, a total of 1,654 people officially declared themselves to be ethnic Macedonians in the last Bulgarian census in 2011 (0,02%) and 561 of them are in Blagoevgrad Province (0,2%). Official census data 1,091 of them are Macedonian citizens, who are permanent residents in Bulgaria.–ù–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Å —á—É–∂–¥–æ –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø–æ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏ Krassimir Kanev, chairman of the non-governmental organization Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, claimed 15,000‚Äì25,000 in 1998 (see here). In the same report Macedonian nationalists (Popov et al., 1989) claimed that 200,000 ethnic Macedonians live in Bulgaria. However, Bulgarian Helsinki Committee stated that the vast majority of the Slavic-speaking population in Pirin Macedonia has a Bulgarian national self-consciousness and a regional Macedonian identity similar to the Macedonian regional identity in Greek Macedonia. Finally, according to personal evaluation of a leading local ethnic Macedonian political activist, Stoyko Stoykov, the present number of Bulgarian citizens with ethnic Macedonian self-consciousness is between 5,000 and 10,000. In 2000, the Bulgarian Constitutional Court banned UMO Ilinden- Pirin, a small Macedonian political party, as a separatist organization. Subsequently, activists attempted to re-establish the party but could not gather the required number of signatures.

In 2002, they numbered 731. (See also Macedonians in Romania.) * Slovenia: Macedonians began relocating to Slovenia in the 1950s when the two regions formed a part of a single country, Yugoslavia. (See also Macedonians in Slovenia.) Other significant Macedonian communities can also be found in the other Western European countries such as Austria, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the whole European Union. Also in Uruguay, with a significant population in Montevideo. Culture The culture of the people is characterized with both traditionalist and modernist attributes. It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of Bulgarians and Serbs. Architecture Ottoman architecture in Ohrid. Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes. The typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by Ottoman Architecture .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen. The stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa√ßade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges. Cinema and theater The history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by Janaki and Milton Manaki in Bitola. In 1995 Before the Rain became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award. From 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in Prilep in honor of Vojdan ƒåernodrinski, the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in Koƒçani. Music and art Macedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring Balkan countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound. The founders of modern Macedonian painting included Lazar Licenovski, Nikola Martinoski, Dimitar Pandilov, and Vangel Kodzoman. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of Borka Lazeski, Dimitar Kondovski, Petar Mazev who are now deceased, and Rodoljub Anastasov and many others who are still active. Others include: Vasko Taskovski and Vangel Naumovski. In addition to Dimo Todorovski, who is considered to be the founder of modern Macedonian sculpture, the works of Petar Hadzi Boskov, Boro Mitrikeski, Novak Dimitrovski and Tome Serafimovski are also outstanding. Economy In the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started. Language The Macedonian language () is a member of the Eastern group of South Slavic languages. Standard Macedonian was implemented as the official language of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia after being codified in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving literary tradition. The closest relative of Macedonian is Bulgarian, followed by Serbo-Croatian. All the South Slavic languages, including Macedonian, form a dialect continuum, in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and Serbian. The Torlakian dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost dialects of Macedonian as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia. The Macedonian alphabet is an adaptation of the Cyrillic script, as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely Romanized. Religion St. Panteleimon in Ohrid. Most Macedonians are members of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church ‚Äì Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in exarchates in the Macedonian diaspora. The church gained autonomy from the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic Archbishopric of Ohrid. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared autocephaly from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the Eastern Orthodox Communion, and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381 A small number of Macedonians belong to the Roman Catholic and the Protestant churches. Between the 15th and the 20th centuries, during Ottoman rule, a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as Macedonian Muslims, who constitute the second largest religious community of the country. NamesCuisine Tavƒçe Gravƒçe, the national dish of Macedonians. Macedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the Balkans‚Äîreflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse. Shopska salad, a food from Bulgaria, is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its dairy products, wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as rakija. Tavƒçe Gravƒçe and mastika are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively. Symbols : See also: Flags of North Macedonia, Symbols of North Macedonia, Proposed coat of arms of North Macedonia * Sun: The official flag of the Republic of North Macedonia, adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field. * Coat of arms: After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the coat of arms adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the center of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun. All this is said to represent \\"the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom\\". Unofficial symbols * Lion: The lion first appears in the Fojnica Armorial from 17th century, where the coat of arms of Macedonia is included among those of other entities. On the coat of arms is a crown; inside a yellow crowned lion is depicted standing rampant, on a red background. On the bottom enclosed in a red and yellow border is written \\"Macedonia\\". The use of the lion to represent Macedonia was continued in foreign heraldic collections throughout the 16th to 18th centuries.Matkovski, Aleksandar, Grbovite na Makedonija, Skopje, 1970.–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä –ú–∞—Ç–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏ (1990) –ì—Ä–±–æ–≤–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞, –ú–∏—Å–ª–∞, Skopje, Macedonia ‚Äî Nevertheless, during the late 19th century the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization arose, which modeled itself after the earlier Bulgarian revolutionary traditions and adopted their symbols as the lion, etc.Duncan M.

Modern versions of the historical lion has also been added to the emblem of several political parties, organizations and sports clubs. However, this symbol is not totally accepted while the state coat of arms of Bulgaria is somewhat similar. * Vergina Sun: (official flag, 1992‚Äì1995) The Vergina Sun is used unofficially by various associations and cultural groups in the Macedonian diaspora. The Vergina Sun is believed to have been associated with ancient Greek kings such as Alexander the Great and Philip II, although it was used as an ornamental design long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day Greek region of Macedonia and Greeks regard it as a misappropriation of a Hellenic symbol, unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II. However, archaeological items depicting the symbol have also been excavated in the territory of North Macedonia. In 1995, Greece lodged a claim for trademark protection of the Vergina Sun as a state symbol under WIPO. In Greece the symbol against a blue field is used vastly in the area of Macedonia and it has official status.The Vergina sun on a red field was the first flag of the independent Republic of Macedonia, until it was removed from the state flag under an agreement reached between the Republic of Macedonia and Greece in September 1995.Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; The Vergina sun is still used unofficially as a national symbol by some groups in the country and Macedonian diaspora.

B. M. Hertzog (6 April 1866 ‚Äì 21 November 1942), was a South African politician and soldier. He was a Boer general during the second Anglo-Boer War who became Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa from 1924 to 1939. Throughout his life he encouraged the development of Afrikaner culture, determined to protect Afrikaners from British influence. He is the only South African Prime Minister to have served under three British monarchs: George V, Edward VIII, and George VI. General Hertzog Hertzog first studied law at Victoria College in Stellenbosch, Cape Colony. In 1889, he went to the Netherlands to read law at the University of Amsterdam, where he prepared a dissertation on the strength of which he received his doctorate in law on 12 November 1892. Hertzog had a law practice in Pretoria from 1892 until 1895, when he was appointed to the Orange Free State High Court. During the Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902, he rose to the rank of general, becoming the assistant chief commandant of the military forces of the Orange Free State. Despite some military reverses, he gained renown as a daring and resourceful leader of the guerilla forces continuing to fight the British. Eventually, convinced of the futility of further bloodshed, he signed the Treaty of Vereeniging in May 1902. Politician Botha government 1910 With South Africa then at peace, Hertzog entered politics as the chief organiser of the Orangia Unie Party. In 1907, the Orange River Colony gained self-government and Hertzog joined the cabinet as Attorney- General and Director of Education. His insistence that Dutch as well as English be taught in the schools aroused bitter opposition. He was appointed national Minister of Justice in the newly formed Union of South Africa, and continued in office until 1912. His antagonism to British imperialism, and Premier Botha, led to a ministerial crisis. In 1913, Hertzog led the secession of the Old Boer and anti-imperialist section from the South African Party. At the outbreak of the South African rebellion in 1914, Hertzog remained neutral. In the years following the war, he headed the opposition to the government of General Smuts. Prime Minister=First government In the general election of 1924, Hertzog's National Party defeated the South African Party of Jan Smuts and formed a coalition government with the South African Labour Party, which became known as the Pact Government. In 1934, the National Party and the South African Party merged to form the United Party, with Hertzog as Prime Minister and leader of the new party. As prime minister, Hertzog presided over the passage of a wide range of social and economic measures which did much to improve conditions for working-class whites. According to one historian, \\"the government of 1924, which combined Hertzog‚Äôs NP with the Labour Party, oversaw the foundations of an Afrikaner welfare state\\". A Department of Labour was established while the Wages Act (1925) laid down minimum wages for unskilled workers, although it excluded farm labourers, domestic servants, and public servants. It also established a Wage Board that regulated pay for certain kinds of work, regardless of racial background (although whites were the main beneficiaries of the legislation). The Old Age Pensions Act (1927) provided retirement benefits for white workers. Coloureds also received the pension, but the maximum for Coloureds was only 70% that of whites. Second government second Hertzog cabinet in 1929. The establishment of the South African Iron and Steel Industrial Corp in 1930 helped to stimulate economic progress, while the withdrawal of duties on imported raw materials for industrial use encouraged industrial development and created further employment opportunities, but at led to a higher cost of living. Various forms of assistance to agriculture were also introduced. Dairy farmers, for instance, were aided by a levy imposed on all butter sales, while an increase in import taxes protected farmers from international competition. Farmers also benefited from preferential railway tariffs and from the widening availability of loans from the Land Bank. The government also assisted farmers by guaranteeing prices for farm produce, while work colonies were established for those in need of social salvage. Secondary industries were established to improve employment opportunities, which did much to reduce white poverty and enabled many whites to join the ranks of both the semi-skilled and skilled labour force. An extension of worker's compensation was carried out, while improvements were made in the standards specified under a contemporary Factory Act, thus bringing the Act into line with international standards, in regard to the length of the working week and the employment of child labour. The law on miners' phthisis (pulmonary tuberculosis) was overhauled, and increased protection of white urban tenants against eviction was introduced at a time when housing was in short supply. The civil service was opened up to Afrikaners through the promotion of bilingualism, while a widening of the suffrage was effected, with the enfranchisement of white women. The pact also instituted \\"penny postage\\", automatic telephone exchanges, a cash-on-delivery postal service, and an experimental airmail service which was later made permanent. The Department of Social Welfare was established in 1937 as a separate government department to deal with social conditions. There was increased expenditure on education for both Whites and Coloureds. Spending on Coloured education rose by 60%, which led to the number of Coloured children in school growing by 30%. Grants for the blind and the disabled were introduced in 1936 and 1937 respectively, while unemployment benefits were introduced in 1937. That same year, the coverage of maintenance grants was extended. Although the social and economic policies pursued by Hertzog and his ministers did much to improve social and economic conditions for Whites, they did not benefit the majority of South Africans, who found themselves the targets of discriminatory labour laws that entrenched White supremacy in South Africa. A Civilised Labour Policy was pursued by the Pact Government, which involved replacing black workers with whites (typically impoverished Afrikaners), and which was enforced through three key pieces of legislation: the Industrial Conciliation Act No 11 of 1924, the Minimum Wages Act No. 27 of 1925, and the Mines and Works Amendment Act no. 25 of 1926. The Industrial Conciliation Act (No 11 of 1924) created job reservation for whites while excluding blacks from membership of registered trade unions, which therefore prohibited the registration of black trade unions. The Minimum Wages Act (No. 27 of 1925) bestowed upon the Minister for Labour the power to force employers to give preference to Whites when hiring workers, while the Mines and Works Amendment Act (No. 25 of 1926) reinforced a colour bar in the mining industry, while excluding Indian miners from skilled jobs. In a sense, therefore, the discriminatory social and economic policies pursued by the Pact Government helped pave the way for the eventual establishment of the Apartheid state. Constitutionally, Hertzog was a republican, who believed strongly in promoting the independence of the Union of South Africa from the British Empire. His government approved the Statute of Westminster in 1931, and replaced Dutch as the second official language with Afrikaans in 1925, as well as instating a new national flag in 1928. His government approved women's suffrage for white women in 1930, thus strengthening the dominance of the white minority. Property and education requirements for Whites were abandoned in the same year, with those for non-Whites being severely tightened and, in 1936, Blacks were completely taken off the common voters' roll. Separately elected Native Representatives were instead instated, a policy repeated in the attempts of the later Apartheid regime to disenfranchise all non-Whites during the 1950s. Through the system of gradual disenfranchisement spanning half a century, the South African electorate was not made up entirely of Whites until the 1970 general election. Third and fourth governments Smuts (furthest left) and Hertzog (furthest right) with their wives, circa 1934. In foreign policy, Hertzog favoured a policy of distance from the British Empire and, as an Germanophile, was sympathetic towards revising the international system set up by the Treaty of Versailles in favour of lessening the burdens imposed on Germany. Hertzog's cabinet in the 1930s was divided between a pro-British group led by the Anglophile Smuts, and a pro-German group led by Oswald Pirow, the openly pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic minister of defence, with Hertzog occupying a middle position. Hertzog had an autocratic style of leadership, expecting the cabinet to approve his decisions rather than to discuss them and, as a consequence, the cabinet only met intermittently. From 1934 onward, South Africa was dominated by an informal \\"inner cabinet\\" consisting of Hertzog, Smuts, Pirow, the Finance minister N.C. Havenga, and Native Affairs minister P.G.W. Grobler. Generally, the \\"inner cabinet\\" would meet in private and whatever decision they reached in their meetings would be presented to the cabinet to endorse with no discussion. Though Hertzog was not as pro-German as the faction led by Pirow, he tended to see Nazi Germany as a \\"normal state\\" and as a potential ally, unlike the Soviet Union which Hertzog saw as a threat to the West. Alongside that, Hertzog saw France as the main threat to peace in Europe, viewing the Treaty of Versailles as an unjust and vindictive peace treaty, and argued the French were the principal trouble-makers in Europe by seeking to uphold the Versailles Treaty. Hertzog argued that if Adolf Hitler had a belligerent foreign policy, it was only because of the Treaty of Versailles was intolerably harsh towards Germany, and if the international system was revised to take account of Germany's \\"legitimate\\" complaints against Versailles, then Hitler would become a moderate and reasonable statesman. When Germany remilitarized the Rhineland in March 1936, Hertzog informed the British government that there was no possibility of South Africa taking part if Britain decided to go to war over the issue and, in the ensuing crisis, South African diplomats took a very pro-German position, arguing that Germany was justified in violating the Treaty of Versailles by remilitarizing the Rhineland. Hertzog's principal adviser on foreign affairs was his external affairs state secretary, H.D.J. Bodenstein, an anti-British Afrikaner nationalist and a republican, who was seen as the eminence grise of South African politics. No other man had the same degree of influence on Hertzog as Bodenstein. Sir William Henry Clark, the British high commissioner to South Africa, had a long-standing feud with Bodenstein, whom he accused of being an Anglophobe, writing in his reports to London that Bodenstein always presented Britain in the worse possible light to Hertzog, and noting with anxiety that Bodenstein's best friend was Emile Wiehle, the German consul in Cape Town. The Germanophile South African minister in Berlin, Stefanus Gie, largely embraced Nazi values as his own and, in reports to Pretoria, portrayed Germany as the victim of Jewish plots, arguing that the Nazis discriminatory policies towards German Jews were only defensive measures. Though Hertzog did not share the anti-Semitism of Gie, the latter's dispatches portraying the Third Reich in a favourable light were used to support the prime minister's foreign policy preferences. In a statement of foreign policy principles for South Africa drawn up by Pirow for the cabinet in March 1938, the first principle was combating Communism, and the second was having Germany serve as the \\"bulwark against Bolshevism\\". In a message to Charles te Water, the South African high commissioner in London in early 1938, Hertzog told him to tell the British that South Africa expected \\"immediacy, impartiality and sincerity\\" in resolving the disputes of Europe. Just was meant by that was explained by Hertzog in a letter to the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in March 1938, which stated that South Africa would not fight in any \\"unjust\\" wars, and that if Britain choose to fight for Czechoslovakia, then South Africa would be neutral. On 22 March 1938, Hertzog sent te Water a telegram stating that South Africa would not under any circumstances go to war with Germany in defence of Czechoslovakia, and stating that he regarded Eastern Europe as being rightfully in Germany's sphere of influence. In another letter in the spring of 1938, Hertzog noted that he was \\"exhausted\\" by France, and that he wanted Chamberlain to tell the French that the Commonwealth, and South Africa in particular, would be neutral if France went to war with Germany because of a German attack on Czechoslovakia. When te Water reported to Hertzog on 25 May 1938 that the British foreign secretary, Lord Halifax, had promised him that Britain was applying maximum pressure on Czechoslovakia to resolve the dispute over the Sudetenland in Germany's favour, and was pressuring France to abandon its alliance with Czechoslovakia, Hertzog stated his approval. On 14 September 1938, te Water complained to Lord Halifax about the \\"astonishing episode\\" of Britain drifting to war with Germany over the Sudetenland issue, stating that as far was South Africa was concerned, Germany was in the right in demanding that mostly German-speaking Sudetenland be allowed to join Germany, and Czechoslovakia and France was in the wrong, the first by refusing the German demands, and the second by having an alliance with Czechoslovakia that encouraged Prague to resist Berlin. In the middle of September 1938, when Britain was on the verge of war with Germany over the Sudetenland issue, Hertzog clashed in the cabinet with Smuts over the course of action that South Africa would pursue. The former favoured neutrality and the latter was for intervention on Britain's side. On 15 September 1938, Hertzog presented the cabinet with a compromise plan that South Africa would declare neutrality in the event of war, but would be neutral in the most pro-British way possible. The cabinet was divided. Pirow favoured South Africa allying itself with Germany to fight against Britain. On the other hand, Smuts favoured South Africa allying with Britain and going to war with Germany, and threatened to use his influence with the MPs loyal to himself to bring down the government if Hertzog did declare neutrality. On 19 September 1938, as a part of a peace plan to resolve the crisis, Britain offered to \\"guarantee\\" Czechoslovakia if the latter agreed to allow the Sudetenland to join Germany, which led te Water to inform Lord Halifax that South Africa was utterly opposed to being part of the \\"guarantee\\", and advised Britain against promising one, through he later changed his position, saying that South Africa would \\"guarantee\\" Czechoslovakia if it was backed by the League of Nations, and if Germany signed a non-aggression pact with Czechoslovakia. On 23 September 1938, at the Bad Godesberg summit, Hitler rejected the Anglo-French plan for transferring the Sudetenland to Germany as insufficient, thus putting Europe on the brink of war. In a telegram to Chamberlain on 26 September 1938, Hertzog wrote that the differences between the Anglo-French and German positions were \\"mainly of method\\" and that, \\"as the issue was one of no material substance, but merely involves a matter of procedure for arriving at a result to which it is common cause between disputants Germany is entitled\\", there was no possibility of South Africa going to war over the issue. Even after Hitler's belligerent speech on Berlin on the same day, proclaiming that he would still attack Czechoslovakia unless Prague settled its disputes with Poland and Hungary by 1 October 1938, Hertzog, in a telegram to te Water, wrote that he felt \\"very deeply that if after this a European war was still to take place the responsibility for that will not be placed upon the shoulders of Germany\\". In his messages to te Water in the last days of September 1938, Hertzog consistently portrayed Czechoslovakia and France as the trouble-makers, and argued that Britain must do more to apply pressure on those two states for more concessions to Germany. Te Water and the Canadian high commissioner in London, Vincent Massey, in a joint note on behalf of South Africa and Canada to Lord Halifax, stated that Sir Basil Newton, the British minister in Prague, should tell the Czechoslovak president Edvard Bene≈°, that \\"the obstructive tactics of the Czech government were unwelcome to the British and Dominion governments\\". On 28 September 1938, Hertzog was able to get the cabinet to approve his policy of pro-British neutrality subject to parliamentary approval, adding that South Africa would only go to war if Germany attacked Britain first. Given his views, Hertzog very much approved of the Munich Agreement of 30 September 1938, which he regarded as a \\"just\\" and \\"fair\\" resolution of the German-Czechoslovak dispute. On 4 September 1939, the United Party caucus revolted against Hertzog's stance of neutrality in World War II, causing Hertzog's government to lose a vote on the issue in parliament by 80 to 67. Governor-General Sir Patrick Duncan refused Hertzog's request to dissolve parliament and call a general election on the question. Hertzog resigned and his coalition partner Smuts became prime minister. Smuts led the country into war and political re-alignments followed, with Hertzog and his faction joining with Daniel Malan's opposition Purified National Party to form the Herenigde Nasionale Party, with Hertzog becoming the new Leader of the Opposition. However, Hertzog soon lost the support of Malan and his supporters when they rejected Hertzog's platform of equal rights between British South Africans and Afrikaners, prompting Hertzog to resign and retire from politics. Death and legacy Statue of Hertzog in the gardens of the Union Buildings, Pretoria. Hertzog died on 21 November 1942, at the age of 76. A 4-metre-high statue of Hertzog was erected in 1977 at the front lawns of the Union Building. The statue was taken down on 22 November 2013 and moved to a new location in the gardens. It was still in good condition, save for the removal of the spectacles which were originally included on the statue. The statue was removed to make way for a 9-metre-high statue of Nelson Mandela. Supporters of Hertzog invented the Hertzoggie, a jam-filled tartlet with a coconut meringue topping, that is still a popular confection in South Africa.

Anticrepuscular rays are essentially parallel, but appear to converge toward the antisolar point, the vanishing point, due to a visual illusion from linear perspective. Anticrepuscular rays are most frequently visible around sunrise or sunset. This is because the atmospheric light scattering that makes them visible (backscattering) is larger for low angles to the horizon than most other angles. Anticrepuscular rays are dimmer than crepuscular rays because backscattering is less than forward scattering. Anticrepuscular rays can be continuous with crepuscular rays, curving across the whole sky in great circles.Lynch, D. K., & Livingston, W. (1995). Color and light in nature.

Sliven is famous for its heroic Haiduts who fought against the Ottoman Turks in the 19th century and is known as the \\"City of the 100 Voyvodi\\", a Voyvoda being a leader of Haiduts. The famous rocky massif Sinite Kamani (–°–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –∫–∞–º—ä–Ω–∏, \\"The Blue Rocks\\") and the associated national park, the fresh air and the mineral springs offer diverse opportunities for leisure and tourism. Investors are exploring the opportunity to use the famous local wind (Bora) for the production of electricity. Another point of interest and a major symbol of the city as featured on the coat of arms, is the more than thousand- year-old Stariyat Briast (–°—Ç–∞—Ä–∏—è—Ç –ë—Ä—è—Å—Ç, \\"The Old Elm\\"), a huge Smooth-leaved Elm in the center of the city. During Ottoman rule, Turkish officials used to hang Bulgarian revolutionaries on it. Today the city is helping the tree to live on by frequent evaluations and reinforcing its base. It was elected Bulgarian tree of the year in 2013. On 19 March 2014 the results of an online poll were revealed at a ceremony in the European Parliament. The Old Elm was voted European Tree of the Year 2014. The city also served as an important strategic centre for the Bulgarian Army, with the headquarters of the Bulgarian Third Army located in the centre of the city, being situated relatively near to the sensitive Turkish border. Sliven Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Sliven.  Name  The name comes from the Slavic word sliv (\\"pour, confluence\\") + the Slavic suffix or ending -en. In Turkish the name of the city is ƒ∞slimiye, while in Greek it is Œ£ŒªŒØŒ≤ŒµŒΩ.  Geography  lowlands of Thrace from southern Stara Planina Sliven is located 300 km east of Bulgaria's capital Sofia, 100 km from Burgas, the country's largest commercial port, 130 km from the border with Greece and 130 km from the border with Turkey. It is located in close proximity to the cities of Yambol and Nova Zagora. West of the city lies the so-called Peach Valley which contains large peach orchards. The city is also known for its mineral baths whose water is used to treat diseases of the liver and nervous system. The most visited geographical location and attraction in the city is the Karandila (–ö–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–¥–∏–ª–∞). It is a hilltop 1050m above sea level, with great sights overlooking the city. The rock formation Halkata (–•a–ª–∫–∞—Ç–∞, \\"The Ring\\") is located on the Karandila. It is a rock protrusion with a peculiar hole in the center. According to myth, one would have their most sincere wish granted upon passing through the ring. Karandila is the site of the annual Karakachani festival, organized by the Federation of the Cultural and Educational Associations of Karakachans (–§–ö–ü–î–ö) in Bulgaria each July.Annual Karakachan Festival, Karandila Karandila is located in the nature park Sinite Kamani (–°–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –∫–∞–º—ä–Ω–∏), whose peak Bulgarka (–ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∫–∞, 1181 m.) is the highest in the eastern Balkan mountain.Sinite Kamuni and Karandila  Climate  Sliven Municipality is situated on the sub-Balkan plain in the zone of transitional-continental climate. In the region of Sliven, winter is mild and summer is relatively warm. Autumn is longer than spring. The local wind Bora is typical for the region.  Demography  According to the Bulgarian National Statistical Institute, as of February 2011, the total population of the Sliven Municipality is 125,268 inhabitants while 91,620 inhabitants live in the city of Sliven.

History  Saint Demetrius church in Sliven, built 1831 The monument of Hadzhi Dimitar in Sliven The house museum of the Sliven lifestyle Sliven clock tower, built 1808 Remains of the oldest settlements on the territory of Sliven date back to around 6000 BCE of the Neolithic. Ruins of a Thracian settlement dating to around 5th‚Äì3rd century BCE as well as Thracian ceramics and Hellenistic coins have been discovered in the area of Hisarlaka ‚Äî a small hill in Sliven. In antiquity it was known as Selymnos (Œ£ŒÆŒªœÖŒºŒΩŒøœÇ in Greek). The area occupied by present-day Sliven has in the past been settled by the Thracian tribes Asti, Kabileti and Seleti. These tribes held their independence until time of Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great who conquered them. The 2nd century BCE marked the beginning of the Roman conquests of northeastern Thracia. Sliven was conquered by Rome around 72‚Äì71 BCE when the ThracianFol, Aleksandar.

Kabile and later GreekAn Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis: An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation by Mogens Herman Hansen,2005,Index cities of Kabile and Apolonia are conquered. With the emergence of the Roman Empire the region of the city became part of the Thracian province of the Roman Empire. A new stage in the city's history began around 2nd-4th century. The first written records of the settlement's name, Tuida/Suida/Tsuida date to this period. This name is most likely of Thracian origin. Its etymology is currently not understood. Known as \\"ƒ∞slimye\\" by the Turks, during Ottoman rule it was a sanjak centre in first Rumelia eyalet, then Silistre (√ñzi) eyalet, Edirne vilayet, finally being for a short period a centre of a department in the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia before its inclusion in the Principality of Bulgaria in 1885. During the First World War it was the site of the Sliven prisoner of war camp, the largest such camp in the country. It was the place of internment for Greek and Serbian civilians and soldiers, with peak numbers of 19,000. In more modern times, Sliven became one of the most significant cultural centres during the Bulgarian National Revival, with much of its old heritage still preserved and enriched and today offers to its citizens and visitors a lot of opportunities for cultural life. It served as the birthplace of many prominent Bulgarians who contributed to the enlightenment such as Hadzhi Dimitar, Dobri Chintulov, Evgeniy Chapkanov, Ivan Seliminski and many others. Another notable native is Anton Pann who composed the Romanian national anthem. Another notable resident is Yordan Letchkov, whose goal in the 1994 World Cup eliminated defending champion Germany. Letchkov was mayor of Sliven from 2003 to 2011.  Economy  The economy of Sliven has centered around industry since the early 19th century. In 1834, Dobri Zhelyazkov established the first factory in Bulgarian lands, thus starting industrial development in Bulgaria. Sliven was one of the largest industrial centers in Bulgaria, playing an important role during the Bulgarian National Revival. It has long-lived traditions in textiles, machine- building, glass-making, chemical production, and the technical and food industries. Following the beginning of communist rule in Bulgaria in 1944, most industries were nationalized and much industrial building and development was spurred. Industry continued to develop until the fall of communism, at which point much of the previously built industry stagnated; many plants and factories were shut down and there was little development. In contemporary times, Sliven has experienced a surge in economy with increased investment, banking establishments and new industries have begun to emerge. The dairy industry, which has long been present, continues to grow and thrive. The wine industry, with companies such as Vinprom and Vini Sliven and about a dozen others, continues to grow as grapes are easily grown due to the climate conditions. In terms of heavy industry, the city produces electric lights and electrical machines. The city has also become notorious as a source of young girls who are trafficked into the sex industry. Light industry in Sliven is mostly devoted to textiles with many companies making wool clothing, socks, and food.  Culture  Theater traditions in Sliven date back 140 years when the city opens its first theatrical stage. The first professional theatrical ensemble was created in 1918 at the Zora community center. The dramatic theater in Sliven, situated on the city's main square. This theatre serves as a venue for various performing arts. There are many buildings in the city built in the National Revival Architecture style, including the House museum \\"Hadzhi Dimitar\\". It is in the south western part of the town and shows visitors a complex of a native memorial home and an old traditional inn. The Museum collection \\"Dobri Chintulov\\" is on the North side of Sliven; it was the home of the Bulgarian revival teacher and poet Dobri Chintulov. The city's main theater is located at the main city square. It is named after the Sliven native Stefan Kirov (–°—Ç–µ—Ñ–∞–Ω –ö–∏—Ä–æ–≤) who was a prominent actor and director.

An understanding of jet force is intrinsic to the launching of drones, satellites, rockets, airplanes and other airborne machines. Jet force begins with some propulsion system; in the case of a rocket, this is usually some system that kicks out combustible gases from the bottom. This repulsion system pushes out these gas molecules in the direction opposite the intended motion so rapidly that the opposite force, acting 180¬∞ away from the direction the gas molecules are moving, (as such, in the intended direction of movement) pushes the rocket up. A common wrong assumption is that the rocket elevates by pushing off the ground. If this were the case, the rocket would be unable to continue moving upwards after the aircraft is no longer close to the ground. Rather, the opposite force by the expelled gases is the reason for movement. Here we see jet force in action, the force that propels this rocket into take off.  Thrust, Lift, Weight, and Drag  The jet force can be divided into components. The \\"forward\\" component of this force is generally referred to as thrust. The upward component of jet force is referred to as lift. There are also two other forces that impact motion of aircraft. Drag, which is also referred to as air resistance, is the force that opposes motion. As such, it acts against both components of the jet force (both the thrust and the lift). The fourth and final force is the weight itself, which acts directly downward.  Thrust  To analyze thrust, we take a mathematical perspective. # First, an aircraft takes off at some angle with respect to the ground. For a rocket traveling straight \\"up\\", this angle would be 90¬∞, or at least close to 90¬∞. For airplanes and most other aircraft, this angle will be much less, generally ranging from 0¬∞ to 60¬∞. We shall define this angle as Œ∏. # Œ∏ is constantly changing as the aircraft moves around. At any given moment, however, the cosine of this angle Œ∏ will give us the component of the force that is acting in the forward direction. Multiplying the total force by this cosine of Œ∏ would yield the thrust: Thrust = Jet Force * \\\\cos\\\\theta Because Œ∏ ranges from 0¬∞ to 90¬∞, and the cosine of any angle in this range is 0 ‚â§ cosŒ∏‚â§ 1, the thrust will always be either less than or equal to the jet force- as expected, as the thrust is a component of the jet force.  Lift  Similar to our analysis of thrust, we begin with a mathematical look: # We define angle Œ∏ the same way we did in step 1 for thrust. Again, this angle Œ∏ is different at any given time. # For lift, however, we are looking for the vertical component, rather than the forward component. The sine of angle Œ∏ will give us the component of the force acting in vertical component. Multiplying the jet force by the sine of Œ∏ will yield the lift: Lift= JetForce*\\\\sin\\\\theta Similar to cosine, the sine of an angle ranging from 0¬∞ to 90¬∞ will always between at least zero and at most one. As such, the lift will also be less than the jet force. Of jet force, lift, and thrust, we can find any one of these if the other two are given using the distance formula. In this case, that would be: \\\\surd(Jet Force)^2=\\\\surd(Thrust^2+Lift^2) As such, jet force, thrust, and lift are inherently linked.  Drag  Drag, or air resistance, is a force that opposes motion. Since the thrust is a force that provides \\"forward motion\\" and, lift one that produces \\"upward motion\\", the drag opposes both of these forces. Air resistance is friction between the air itself and the moving object (in this case the aircraft). The calculation of air resistance is far more complicated than that of thrust and lift- it has to do with the material of the aircraft, the speed of the aircraft, and other variable factors. However, rockets and airplanes are built with materials and in shapes that minimize drag force, maximizing the force that moves the aircraft upward/forward.  Weight  Weight is the downward force that the lift must overcome to produce upward movement. On earth, weight is fairly easy to calculate: Weight= m*g In this equation, m represents the mass of the object and g is the acceleration that is produced by gravity. On earth, this value is approximately 9.8 m/s squared. When the force for lift is greater than the force of weight, the aircraft accelerates upwards.  Analysis with momentum  To calculate the speed of the vessel due to the jet force itself, analysis of momentum is necessary. Conservation of momentum states the following: m1v1+m2v2=m1v1f+m2v2f In this situation, m1 represents the mass of the gas in the propulsion system, v1 represents the initial speed of this gas, m2 represents the mass of the rocket, and v2 represents the initial velocity of the rocket. On the other end of the equation, v1f represents the final velocity of the gas and v2f represents the final velocity of the rocket. Initially, both the gas in the propulsion system and the rocket are stationary, leading to v1 and v2 equaling 0. As such, the equation can be simplified to the following: 0=m1v1f+m2v2f After some more simple algebra, we can calculate that v2 (the velocity of the rocket) is the following: v2f=-(m1v1)/m2 This gives us the velocity of the aircraft right after it takes off. Because we know all forces acting on it from this point on, we can calculate net acceleration using Newton's second law. Given the velocity that the aircraft takes off with and the acceleration at any point, the velocity can also be calculated at any given point.

Dolby Stereo was developed by Dolby in 1976 for analog cinema sound systems. The format was adapted for home use in 1982 as Dolby Surround when HiFi capable consumer VCRs were introduced. It was further improved with the Pro Logic decoding system in 1987. The Dolby MP Matrix was the professional system that encoded 4 channels of film sound into 2. This track used by the Dolby Stereo theater system on a 35mm optical stereo print and decoded back to the original 4.0 Surround. The same 4 channel encoded stereo track was largely left unchanged and made available to consumers as \\"Dolby Surround\\" on Home Video. However, the original Dolby Surround decoders in 1982 were a simple passive matrix 3 channel decoder : L/R and Mono Surround. The surround was limited to 7kHz. It also had Dolby Noise Reduction and an adjustable delay for improved channel separation and to prevent dialog leaking and arriving to listeners ears first. The front center channel was equally split between left and right channels for phantom center reproduction. This differed from the Cinema Dolby Stereo system which used active steering and other processing to decode a center channel for dialog and center focused on screen action. Later on in 1987, the Pro Logic decoding system was released to consumers. It featured virtually the same type of 4 channel decoding as the Dolby Stereo theater processor with active steering logic and much better channel separation (up to 30dB) as well as including a dedicated center channel output for the first time. Many standalone Pro Logic decoders also included a phantom center option for compatibility with earlier non-Pro Logic Dolby Surround equipped home theaters to split the center channel signal to the L/R speakers for legacy phantom center reproduction. Dolby Surround Pro Logic is the full name which refers to the matrix surround format and decoding system in one. When a Dolby Surround soundtrack is created in post production [Dolby MP Matrix], four channels of sound are matrix-encoded into an ordinary stereo (two channel) sound track. The center channel is encoded by placing it equally in the left and right channels minus 3dB; and the surround channel is encoded using phase shift techniques for out of phase information (L-R). The surround channel was often used for ambient background sounds in the original recording, music scores and effects. A Dolby Pro Logic decoder/processor \\"unfolds\\" the soundtrack back into its original 4.0 surround--left and right, center, and a single limited frequency-range (7 kHz low-pass filtered) mono rear channel--while systems lacking the decoder play back the audio as standard stereo. Although Dolby Surround was introduced as an analog format, all Dolby Digital decoders incorporate a digitally implemented Dolby Surround Pro Logic decoder for digital stereo signals that carry matrix-encoded Dolby Surround. One of the first was the MSP400 surround sound receiver and amplifier by RCA for their high-end Dimensia brand. It was released in 1987 for the Digital Command Component System. Dolby Surround Dolby Surround logo Dolby Surround is the earliest consumer version of Dolby's surround sound decoding technology. It was introduced to the public in 1982 during the time home video recording formats (such as Betamax and VHS) were introducing Stereo and HiFi capability. The name Dolby Surround described the consumer passive matrix decoding technology; the professional, active matrix cinema technology bore the name Dolby Stereo. It was capable of decoding Dolby Stereo 4-channel soundtracks to 3 output channels (Left, Right, Surround). The Center channel was fed equally to the Left and Right speakers. The Surround channel was limited to a 100 Hz to 7 kHz frequency bandwidth, as dialog from the center channel could leak into the surround channel - there was as little as 3 dB of separation between LCR and Surround channels. Dolby Pro Logic Dolby Pro Logic logo In 1987 the decoding technology was updated and renamed Dolby Pro Logic. A Pro Logic decoder/processor \\"unfolds\\" the sound into the original 4.0 surround--left and right, center, and a single limited frequency-range (7 kHz low-pass filtered) mono rear channel. A Pro Logic decoder also uses 'Steering Logic', which drives amplifiers, to raise or lower the output volume of each channel based on the current dominant sound direction. For example, while a mono signal is played, the strong correlation to the center channel triggers the output volume of the left, right and surround channels to be lowered. This increases the channel separation achievable, to around 30 decibels between channels. By careful tuning of the response of the amplifiers, the total amount of signal energy remains constant and is unaffected by the operation of the channel steering. Additionally the response time of the system to changes in sound direction is important as too fast a response results in a twitchy feel, while too slow a response leaves sounds coming from an inappropriate direction. In addition to 5db of noise processing, the surround channel is slightly delayed, so that any front channel sounds that leak into the surround channel arrive at the listener after the front channels. This takes advantage of the Haas effect - audio that is present in the front speakers but delayed in the surround speakers will have the psychoacoustic effect of emanating from the front of the sound stage. Dolby Surround and Dolby Pro Logic decoders are similar in principle, as both use matrix technology to extract extra channels from Dolby Stereo stereo-encoded audio. The terms Dolby Stereo, Dolby Surround and Lt/Rt are all used to describe soundtracks that are matrix-encoded using this technique. '' Dolby Pro Logic II Dolby Pro Logic II logo Older logo, before Dolby updated their overall logo design. In 2000, Dolby introduced Dolby Pro Logic II (DPL II), an improved implementation of Dolby Pro Logic created by Jim Fosgate. DPL II processes any high quality stereo signal source into five separate full frequency channels (right front, center, left front, right rear and left rear). Dolby Pro Logic II also decodes 5 channels from stereo signals encoded in traditional four-channel Dolby Surround. DPL II implements greatly enhanced steering compared to DPL, and as a result, offers an exceptionally stable sound field that simulates 5 channel surround sound. Because of the limited nature of the original DPL, many consumer electronics manufacturers introduced their own processing circuitry, such as the \\"Jazz\\", \\"Hall\\", and \\"Stadium\\" modes found on most common home audio receivers. DPL II forgoes this type of processing and replaces it with simple servo (negative feedback) circuits used to derive five channels. The extra channel content is extracted using the difference between the spatial audio content between two individual channels of stereo tracks or Dolby Digital encoded 5.1 channel tracks and outputs it appropriately. In addition to five full range playback channels, Pro Logic II introduced a Music mode which includes optimized channel delays, and adds user controls to‚Äîfor example‚Äîadjust apparent front sound stage width. Pro Logic II system also features a mode designed specifically for video gaming, and was frequently used in game titles for Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube and Wii as an alternative to digital surround formats such as Dolby Digital, or DTS. Game mode is similar to Movie mode, except it redirects more bass to the LFE channel. Dolby Pro Logic IIx Dolby Pro Logic IIx logo A newer Dolby Pro Logic IIx system is also now available, which can take two-channel stereo, Dolby Surround (sometimes called Dolby Stereo Surround) and Dolby Digital 5.1 source material and up-convert it to 6.1 or 7.1 channel surround sound. Dolby Pro Logic IIz Dolby Pro Logic IIz logo. Dolby Pro Logic IIz expands on Pro Logic IIx with the addition of a height component, creating front height channels above the front left and right speakers, expanding a 5.1 or 7.1 system to 7.1 Height or 9.1. It identifies spatial cues in low-level, uncorrelated information, such as ambience and effects like rain or wind in the side and rear surround channels, and directs it to the front height speakers. The channels it adds are matrixed, not discrete.  Dolby Surround (2014)  Dolby reintroduced the Dolby Surround terminology in 2014 to refer to something entirely new. The term now refers to a new upmixer whose \\"... purpose is to enable Atmos receivers and speaker configurations to serve non-Atmos signals.\\" Dolby Surround is a complete replacement for Pro Logic that upmixes stereo and multi-channel inputs to play over Atmos configurations.

The Daily Sport, like the Sunday Sport, was known for ridiculous headlines to entirely fabricated stories. Later editorial practice meant an end to such stories and an increased focus on celebrity news and sexual revelations. Daily Sport often published fake nude pictures of celebrities and also paparazzi 'upskirt' and 'downblouse' or nipple slip pictures. The fake nude pictures were published with the appropriate disclaimers and captions, although the front cover image was often accompanied by a titillating caption, like \\"Tender tips make tastier tea\\". In September 2008, The Sport was criticised by the Press Complaints Commission for glamourising suicide by publishing a \\"Top yourself tourism list\\".PCC censures Daily Sport for glamorising suicide  Media  guardian.co.uk.

A feature of the paper was the classified advertisements, which in reality were a series of short advertisements for massage parlours and escort services across the country. In later years, the classified adverts had also become a place for swingers to advertise. The Daily Sport pioneered the football crossword in the United Kingdom. The soccer crossword positioned in the back pages alongside the football journalists reports was unique in the fact that the clues were solely devoted to questions which related to the country's national game. After two years of his work appearing in the Daily Sport the grid also became a regular feature in the Sunday Sport editions. The Sport claimed to have launched the careers of numerous models, among them Louise Hodges who modeled throughout the 1990s Linsey Dawn McKenzie, who began posing topless for the newspaper in 1994, and Cherry Dee who began posing topless for them in 2003 when they were both 16 (the legal age for such activity in the United Kingdom at the time). Among recent popular Sport models were Kelly Bell, Hannah Claydon and Lauren Pope; however, very few Sport models also appeared in the other tabloids which the paper regarded as its rivals. The Daily Sport and Sunday Sport were sold by David Sullivan to Sport Media Group in 2007. The papers were relaunched in April 2008 under the editorial leadership of Barry McIlheney and James Brown, the founder of Loaded.

This for the education of children between the ages of four and seven years. It is usually a small school serving a particular area. An infant school forms part of local education provision giving primary education. In England and Wales, children start at infant school between the ages of four and five in a Reception class. They sometimes attend part-time (mornings only or afternoons only) for the first term. Reception is not compulsory. The initial Infant school year represents Key Stage 1 in the English education system. At the end of their few years in Infant school, pupils will then move on to a linked Junior school. (There are also Academy schools in both primary and secondary education.) In some areas of England, provision of education at this age is made in Primary schools catering for pupils aged up to ten or eleven. (This is where Infants and Junior Schools are combined under a single Head Teacher or Principal. This unites both of the schools in the field of primary education). Under the Welsh Assembly, some parts of the Welsh valleys have seen children attending infants school from the day after their third birthday. History The first infant school in England was at Brewers Green, Westminster in 1818 which was placed under the charge of James Buchanan, a weaver. Buchanan had served at what is considered the first infant school in Great Britain, Robert Owen's at New Lanark. The second in England was opened in 1820 by Joseph Wilson in Spitalfields and placed in the charge of Samuel Wilderspin. In 1823, Wilderspin published On the Importance of Educating the Infant Children of the Poor. In June 1824, Henry Brougham, William Wilberforce, Samuel Wilderspin and William Allen formed the Infant School Society. The purpose of the society was to train teachers and to promote infant school formation. Unlike Owen's school, those opened under Wilderspin's influence placed great emphasis on religious training for the young children of the poor. Dame schools, which had existed long before, had shown the need for childcare of very young children for women who worked outside the home. The new infant schools were to provide a safe environment for these children as well as give them some educational advantages. Wilderspin's schools were based on the reform education theory of Swiss thinker Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. James Pierrepont Greaves, secretary of the Infant School Society, worked with Pestalozzi for several years, as did Charles Mayo, who along with his sister Elizabeth Mayo, worked with the Home and Colonial Institution (later the Home and Colonial Infant School Society) to set up infant schools and train teachers. When education became compulsory in England from 1877, infant schools were incorporated into the state school system. Infant and junior schools were often separate schools, but from the 1970s through the 1990s, many infant and junior departments were merged into single primary schools, as both an infants school and junior school gives primary education. The 1970s and 1980s saw hundreds of infant schools in Britain abolished in favour of first (primary) schools, but some were reverted into infant schools by the early-1990s. Since 2000, there have been several changes back and forth between infant and junior schools, and the combined primary school model. By the 2010s, there was no single way in which schools are structured, and the academy school education model had been introduced. In 2016, the UK Government expressed an intention for all primary schools (combined infants and juniors) to become academy schools, and this plan is facing some criticism in England and Wales. The introduction of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 meant that classes in infant schools in England and Wales are limited to no more than 30 children per school teacher.

The agency undertakes research in areas which will help to develop and enhance Italian competitiveness and employment, while protecting the environment. History Initially (1982), ENEA was an acronym that stood for Energia Nucleare ed Energie Alternative (\\"Atomic Energy and Alternative Energy\\"), according to its mission statement. After a referendum against the production of atomic energy in Italy (following the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster in 1986) passed in 1987, in 1991 ENEA's mission statement was changed and, consequently, its complete name, which became Ente per le nuove tecnologie, l'energia e l‚Äôambiente (\\"Agency for new technologies, energy and environment\\").Italian Senate archive (PDF) In January 1999 a new charter readdressed the goals for the agency as follows: * To undertake initiatives aimed at developing, enhancing and promoting research and innovation, in keeping with Italy's EU and international commitments in terms of energy efficiency, environmental protection and technological innovation. * To support the implementation of high-tech production processes, especially by promoting demand for research and technology oriented towards enhancing sustainable development. * To promote the transfer of technology and developments in the fields of energy efficiency and environmental protection to public administrations and businesses, in keeping with national and EU guidelines. * To provide, upon request, specialist technical and organisational support to administrations promoting public initiatives at the international, national, regional and local levels, in all the sectors falling within ENEA's purview. In July 2009 the Italian parliament passed a law readdressing ENEA's mission statement, including to back atomic energy, and contextually changing its complete name to the current one. After Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 a second referendum against atomic energy production was held, and passed again. As the role of ENEA became contradictory to the referendum outcome, it was restructured once again in July 2015 and its mission statement was readdressed in order to be more coherent with the Italian energy policy. In the nuclear sector ENEA participates in the development of the ITER fusion reactor to produce clean energy.http://www.fusione.enea.it/ Research centers Besides the headquarters in Rome, ENEA has the following research centers and laboratories in Italy: * Bologna Research Center * Brasimone Research Center (near Bologna) * Brindisi Research Center * Casaccia Research Center (Roma) * Faenza Research Laboratory * Frascati Research Center * Ispra Research Laboratory * Portici Research Center * Santa Teresa Research Center (Pozzuolo di Lerici, near La Spezia) * Saluggia Research Center * Trisaia Research Center (near Rotondella) References External links  * * Some specialistic ENEA's research sites: ** CRESCO - Supercomputing and ENEA- Grid Center (Centro computazionale di RicErca sui Sistemi COmplessi) ** Meta-Knowledge Engineering & Management (MKEM): High-Intelligent Socio-Cognitive Systems ** Thermal-Fluid Dynamics ** Biosensors & Bioelectronics - COSMIC: COupling Smart Molecules Into Chips Category:Government of Italy Category:Cold fusion ","title":"ENEA (Italy)"},{"id":"432749","text":"Enea AB is a global information technology company with its headquarters in Kista, Sweden that provides real-time operating systems and consulting services. Enea, which is an abbreviation of Engmans Elektronik Aktiebolag, also produces the OSE operating system. History Enea was founded 1968 by Rune Engman as Engmans Elektronik AB. Their first product was an operating system for a defence computer used by the Swedish Air Force. During the 1970s the firm developed compiler technology for the Simula programming language. During the early days of the European Internet-like connections, Enea employee Bj√∂rn Eriksen connected Sweden to EUnet using UUCP, and registered enea as the first Swedish domain in April 1983. The domain was later converted to the internet domain enea.se when the network was switched over to TCP and the Swedish top domain .se was created in 1986.

The race car bodyshells are 5/8-scale replicas of American automobiles from the 1930s and 1940s, powered by a Yamaha XJ1250, FJ1200 (both air-cooled), or starting in 2018, FZ09 (water-cooled) engine. The worldwide sanctioning body for legends car racing is INEX. Legends cars are a \\"spec\\" series, meaning all cars are mechanically identical, with the exception of three styles of car (standard coupe, 34 coupe, and sedan) available with 10 types of body styles. (New cars are currently offered with seven body styles, however many used cars exist with the \\"older\\" styles). History In 1992, Charlotte Motor Speedway officials noticed a need for lower cost racing cars with little maintenance time and cost. They found such a car existed, in the guise of the motorcycle- engined dwarf car, a 5/8-scale, steel-bodied and fenderless '35 Ford coup√©, which was being manufactured by the Dwarf Car Company in Phoenix, Arizona. As the coup√© concept was not exactly in line in what they were looking for, and deeming steel replacement bodywork too costly, they adapted the dwarf car concept to fit their needs, creating cars resembling those of the '30s and '40s which competed in the early NASCAR modified tour races. To this day, the primary difference between the two cars is the legends have fenders over the tires, whereas the dwarfs have no fenders. The first legends car was unveiled in April 1992 by track president and general manager Humpy Wheeler and road racer Elliott Forbes-Robinson. Legends cars are produced by US Legend Cars International (formerly 600 Racing, Inc.) in Harrisburg, North Carolina. They are the largest mass producer of race cars in the world. Legends car racing around the world Although the cars originated from the US, other countries including Canada, England and Scotland also host championships. Each November, the world finals are held in the US. US 2013 US Dirt Nationals Young Lions champion Troy Hoff Drivers can be classified into four different divisions. The Pro Division is for the experienced drivers. The Masters Division features drivers 40 years and older. The Semi-Pro Division is for drivers with less than two years of experience in a legends, featuring the drivers that are new to the INEX legends car or have been inactive in other forms of racing for a while. Finally, there is the Young Lions Division, which is designated for drivers between the ages of 12 and 16. There are separate nationals for dirt and asphalt cars. Legends car drivers who have raced in NASCAR include Brennan Poole, Ryan Blaney, Reed Sorenson, David Ragan, Joey Logano, Kyle Busch, and Kurt Busch.

For the 2015 season seven races are scheduled from April till November. Australia For a number of years legends raced on Australian oval tracks, surviving as a minor category, as the popularity of oval track racing \\"down under\\" is not what it is in the United States. Mainly Legends is a speedway category racing on dirt and clay ovals running on midget and sprint car meets, but also briefly became a tarmac category, racing as a support category with the Australian NASCAR series, mainly racing on the Calder Park Thunderdome superspeedway (something that the Legends Cars do not race, as they typically are on smaller ovals and road courses). Phil Ward, a former touring car racer, recognized the potential for this type of economical racer, and developed the Aussie racing car, with a focus on road racing. The Aussie racing cars retain the same Yamaha motorcycle engines. The classic legends style bodyshape of old Fords and early Holdens have been gradually supplanted by imitations of modern road cars for commercial purposes. The category has visited many of the major Supercars Championship races across Australia. While high grid numbers have long been a feature of the class, calendars have fluctuated wildly as category management has clashed with event promoters. Another very similar category Future Racers also emerged during the 2000s technically very similar although the bodywork was more sportscar in nature.

In most continuities, Krypto is Superman's pet dog, usually depicted as a white dog of a generic pedigree. Krypto is sometimes depicted as resembling a Labrador Retriever, but his specific breed is almost never specified. Krypto has appeared in numerous cartoon television shows and films. He appeared in his first official live adaptation (excluding Smallville) on the season finale of the Titans television series and is portrayed by a real dog in the second season. Publication history Krypto's first appearance was in a Superboy story in Adventure Comics #210 (March 1955), and was created by writer Otto Binder and artist Curt Swan. Originally intended as a one-off character, the dog attracted positive attention from the audience, and returned four issues later and became a regular member of Superboy's cast. Character biography=The original Krypto Krypto, with Superboy, in his first appearance, from Adventure Comics #210 (March 1955). Art by Curt Swan and Stan Kaye. On Krypton, parallel evolution led to the emergence of analogous species to Terran cats, simians, birds and dogs, which were domestic companion animals as they were on Earth. As explained in his first appearance, Krypto was originally the toddler Kal-El's dog while they were on Krypton. Jor-El, testing prototypes for the rocket that would eventually send Kal-El to Earth, decided to use Krypto as a test subject. However, Krypto's rocket was knocked off-course; the rocket drifted through space for years until it eventually landed on Earth, where Krypto was reunited with the now-teenaged superhero, Superboy. Due to the environment (Earth's yellow sun and lower gravity), Krypto possessed the same powers and abilities as his master, although his physical abilities were proportionate to his smaller size and species, similar to an ordinary dog vs. a human. Certain sensory abilities of Krypto's (senses of smell and hearing) would be more acute than those of Superman, just as an ordinary dog's senses would be more acute than those of an ordinary human. Krypto also had super-canine intelligence (approximately human level, though with his canine traits and interests still present); the comics expressed this via the use of thought balloons indicating what Krypto was thinking. Krypto was drawn as a white dog of generic pedigree. The early appearances of the character in the comics usually featured exaggerated anthropomorphic facial expressions; these were replaced in later appearances by a more generic canine face. When fighting crime, Krypto usually wore a gold collar, a miniature facsimile of the famed Superman-\\"S\\" symbol for a dog tag, and a dog-sized version of Superman's cape. Whenever he was on Earth and wanted to appear as an \\"ordinary\\" dog, Krypto would simply pull his collar and its attached cape off, pulling it back on when necessary. In one story, he was gifted with a collar which contained a retractable cape within the collar that could be unfurled or hidden by pressing a stud on the collar. When not accompanying Superboy/Superman, Krypto spent much of his time romping through space; while on Earth, however, he stayed with the Kent family, posing as their pet dog, \\"Skip\\". In that identity, his guardians applied a brown dye patch on his back for a disguise which Krypto could burn off with his heat vision when he went into costume; later, the Kents devised a pullcord-activated dye applicator and other methods which Krypto could use to switch to \\"Skip\\" and back without assistance. Krypto had the distinction of belonging to two organizations of super-animals: the 30th century Legion of Super-Pets, and the Space Canine Patrol Agents. After the 1971 revamp of Superman by editor Julius Schwartz, Krypto made no appearances for several years.Krypto at the Grand Comics Database The character returned suffering from amnesia in a 1974 two-part Green Arrow backup story in Action Comics #440 and 441. His memory was restored in 1975's Superman #287. Asked in a 2006 interview why he \\"liberated Krypto from the limbo kennel\\", writer Elliot S. Maggin said, \\"A man needs a dog. A superman needs a superdog.\\" Krypto had his own feature in The Superman Family #182 (March‚ÄìApril 1977) to #192 (November‚ÄìDecember 1978) and it was written by Bob Toomey. In the final (noncanonical) pre-Crisis Superman story, Alan Moore's Whatever Happened To The Man of Tomorrow?, Krypto sacrificed his life to save Superman by biting the throat out of the Kryptonite Man. The villain died but Krypto was irradiated by him and died as well. In Superboy #126 (Jan. 1966) \\"Krypto's Family Tree\\", Krypto's father's name was given as Zypto, his grandfather as Nypto, and his great-grandfather as Vypto. The modern KryptoPocket universe Krypto= Following the 1985-1986 Crisis on Infinite Earths limited series, Superman's history was extensively rewritten, initially eliminating all other survivors of Krypton in the revised version of his origin, including Krypto, so as to once again make the premise that Superman was truly the \\"Last Son of Krypton\\" a valid one. Eventually Krypto in several forms was reintroduced to the Superman mythos, the first being as essentially an exact copy of the pre-crisis Krypto existing in a pocket universe created by the Time Trapper. In this early Post-Crisis storyline, Superman found himself in this pocket universe in which, similar to the Pre- Crisis Earth Prime of Superboy-Prime, his teenage counterpart was the only superhuman on Earth. Combatting the genocidal forces of the three Phantom Zone criminals, this alternate Superboy had an intelligent Krypto counterpart as well, who heroically sacrificed his powers for his master to provide him with gold kryptonite to defeat his enemy. This was the same pocket reality from which the \\"Matrix\\" Supergirl originated. =Krypto and Bibbo= The second modern Krypto was a small white pet dog, rescued, and later named by Bibbo Bibbowski. Originally, Bibbo had wanted to name the dog \\"Krypton\\" after Superman's home planet. However, the engraver of the dog tag (knowing that Bibbo had recently won the lottery) intentionally dropped the letter \\"n\\" (\\"Six letters or less for 1 dollar\\"), so he was trying to extort more money from Bibbo; an angry Bibbo refused to comply and renamed the dog \\"Krypto.\\" Soon after, the dog found two young children who had been trapped in a bomb shelter for a month following Superman's fight with Doomsday. The children were badly malnourished and dehydrated, but it was learned that they would survive and recover. This gave Superman the idea to explain Clark Kent's long absence by staging a faked rescue from a similar predicament. Krypto was later acquired by the modern Superboy; however, this version of Krypto was an ordinary Earth dog with no superpowers, and the dog and Kon-El didn't get along. For a time, Krypto's friends were agent Rex Leech, Rex's daughter Roxy, the being from the genetically engineered race at Cadmus called \\"DNAliens\\" known as Dubbilex, and TV reporter Tana Moon. Krypto became involved in many of Superboy's adventures. The dog was eventually dropped from the series, remaining in Hawaii when Superboy returned to Project Cadmus. Superboy's friends believed him to be missing and Krypto was left in the care of a neighbor that he liked, a young woman named Hillary. After Superboy #69 of that series, the dog went to live at Cadmus. Krypto, a creature called Grokk the Living Gargoyle, and a DNAlien named Angry Charlie, started an uprising against the Agenda, an evil consortium which was influencing Cadmus at the time. After battling a DNAlien named the Gene-gnome, Krypto was never seen again, his last appearance in Superboy #74. The dog from Krypton Krypto aids Superboy against Superboy-Prime, on the cover for Infinite Crisis #4 (March 2006). Art by Jim Lee and Sandra Hope. The third and more familiar version of Krypto was introduced in the early 2000s Superman comics storyline Return to Krypton, as a dog from a false, idealized Krypton (that coincidentally resembled the pre- Crisis Krypton) that was created as a trap by Brainiac 13. Superman was able to defeat the trap, and when he returned to Earth, Krypto followed him. This new version of Krypto has all the physical abilities of his pre-Crisis predecessor, but with a normal canine intellect. This initially causes a great deal of trouble for his new master when, for instance, he would scratch at a door to indicate he wanted to go out and unintentionally gouged big chunks out of the door with his super strength, or inflicting grievous bodily harm when combating villains (since Krypto bites the way a regular canine would, only without being careful about his super strength). As a result, Krypto is for some time locked away in the Fortress of Solitude under the care of one of Superman's robots. This robot is programmed to emit the scent of the dog's real master. Superman has gone to great lengths to train the dog, and he now occasionally accompanies the Man of Steel on missions. Batman never misses an opportunity to poke fun at Krypto when Batman and Superman don't see eye-to- eye. Krypto operates on his own for a short period of time, helping out when disasters rocked the planet because of the plans of the invading Imperiex. He is shown rescuing endangered people. In the \\"Hush\\" story arc, Batman uses Krypto to sniff out the whereabouts of Poison Ivy after she uses kryptonite lipstick to gain control of Superman. It also appears that Krypto has taken a great liking to Catwoman, much to her immense displeasure. Krypto is part of the rescue force put together late in the Superman/Batman storyline \\"Public Enemies\\" (#1-6). Thinking Batman and Superman needed to be rescued from President Lex Luthor, a small team of superheroes, which includes such heroes as Superboy, Nightwing, and Robin, invade the White House. Krypto destroys part of the upper floors while subduing some Secret Service agents. Krypto has a surprisingly violent reaction to Kara Zor-El when he first encounters her. The dog happens upon the girl while she was exploring the Fortress of Solitude and attacks, going so far as to use his heat vision and other potentially lethal attacks. Batman, who distrusted Kara at that time, pointed this out as an argument that Kara might not be who she says she is when he remarks \\"Doesn't it bother you at all that the dog hates her?\\" Superman's response was \\"It's his job to protect the fortress while he's here. Besides...the dog hates everybody.\\" Some time later, Superman left Krypto in Superboy's care, saying that Smallville's open spaces were a better place for the dog, and that Superboy could use a friend (as shown in Teen Titans vol. 3, #7). Their relationship had a shaky start, not helped by Krypto getting Superboy in trouble with the superheroine Starfire for destroying her alien garden. However, they have slowly developed a close friendship, in which Krypto willingly does anything he can to protect Conner. One example of this loyalty was Krypto's quick defense of Conner from an enraged Superboy-Prime. He bit Superboy-Prime in the shoulder. Although Krypto was injured with a punch sending him bouncing down the main street of Smallville, this only strengthened his relationship with Conner. Unfortunately Superboy perishes in battle while destroying a multiverse influence tower that Superboy-Prime helped build. Krypto makes a brief appearance in JLA #87. The entity known as Fernus took over the mind and body of Martian Manhunter. Krypto is telepathically influenced and uses the Atom as a chew toy. Ray and the League are saved by John Stewart and his injuries are healed by the Flash. Later, he is mentally influenced by an alien armada being led by the space-faring villain Despero. This is seen in Superman/Batman #32 (March 2007). Along with other earth-based heroes influenced by alien origins, Krypto attacks Superman and Batman after a gathering in Metropolis. The two titular heroes neutralize the alien threat, freeing the minds of everyone affected. =One year later= Action Comics #850 presents the latest revision of Superman's origin, containing many subtle retcons to Superman: Birthright, the latest major revision of Superman's continuity. The current version indicates that Krypto was indeed the El family dog from the real Krypton (as in the Silver Age), showing an identical white dog present at Kal-El's birth. Although Action #850 does not deal with the specifics of how this dog was sent to Earth or when he arrived (Krypto is not clearly shown in any of the brief scenes of Clark's childhood), subsequent issues of the Superman title have contained references to Krypto being around when he was \\"young\\". Both inclusions retconned the origin of the current Krypto hailing from an ersatz Krypton and debuting during Superman's adulthood. Some time later, a back-up feature in Action Comics Annual #11, written by Geoff Johns, finally clarified the details of the \\"New Earth\\" origin of Krypto: \\"The Kryptonian canine of the House of El, Krypto was sent in a small prototype rocket created by Jor-El. Lost for years, Krypto was eventually found and rescued by Clark when he was a boy.\\" This retcon brings the modern Krypto almost identically in line with the original Silver Age version. Krypto goes missing for over a year following the death of his previous owner Conner Kent, but Superman is unable to devote much time to search for him, having himself been without powers for much of that time. Krypto responds to the call from Jimmy Olsen's makeshift signal watch and makes his return. Krypto is quick to defend Jimmy who along with Superman fall under attack, and is badly injured as a result. Jimmy takes Krypto back to his apartment, and nurses the injured dog back to health. Superman later decides to let Krypto stay with Jimmy when he realizes that Krypto has always preferred the company of younger people, such as himself as a child and Kon- El. Jimmy gives Krypto the secret identity of \\"Pal\\", a play on the old Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen title. =Calmer= During the Green Lantern storyline Sinestro Corps War, Robin enlists Krypto's aid in battling against Superboy-Prime, who has returned to Earth as part of the Sinestro Corps. Under Robin's command, Krypto attacks Prime with feral rage damaging Prime's armor, but is unfortunately beaten aside, although he buys the heroes enough time for Superman, Power Girl, and Supergirl to join the fight. During Superman's battle with the villain Atlas, and after Atlas incapacitates such heroes as Steel and Bibbo Bibbowski, Atlas laments that he has not faced a worthy opponent. Just then, Krypto emerges vowing to \\"hurt this one\\" because he \\"loves man\\" (Superman). Krypto proves to be more than a match for Atlas, revealing Atlas' magical nature to Superman. This is the first and only story to show exactly what Krypto 'thinks', and although it's translated for readers, Krypto 'speaks' in a simplistic manner with broken English, rarely using pronouns. This story also focuses on how Superman has taught Krypto to be much calmer and well-behaved; Superman reassures Lois that Krypto loves her as well. Following the death of Pa Kent and Brainiac's attack on the family farm, Krypto arrives on the front step of the Kent Farm, to protect Martha Kent and provide companionship. A clone of Krypto made by Cadmus made an appearance in Power Girl. Geoff Johns detailed Krypto's role in Adventure Comics. The character appears alongside the resurrected Conner Kent as his companion and sidekick, with a much more amicable relationship than before Connor's death. Krypto is instrumental in helping Connor Kent escape the effects of a Black Lantern power ring. He later participates in the final battle against the Black Lantern Corps. The canine is again seen living calmly on the Kent farm, sitting next to Martha. The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Krypto appears as a normal dog with no powers on Krypton. There is mention of a white dog ghost that is protecting Clark Kent. In Action Comics #5 (March 2012), during Krypton's final moments, Jor-El tries to save his family by opening a portal to the Phantom Zone, when suddenly the incarcerates try to escape. Krypto bravely defends the family but is sucked into the Zone, while baby Kal-El shows anguish at losing the dog. The now-grown Superman rediscovers Krypto in Action Comics #13 (December 2012) after being pulled into the Phantom Zone by the first inhabitant of the prison. At the story's conclusion, Superman is able to bring Krypto back to Earth. With Krypto in critical condition, Superman rushes to the observation deck, exposing Krypto to the sun's radiation. Krypto is then healed at an accelerated rate and is comforted by him. The rapid healing reveals that the dog has developed superpowers just as Kal-El, Kon-El and Kara Zor-El have. In Superboy #24, Krypto is shown battling polar bears in the Arctic before deciding to join Superboy and Doctor Psycho in battling H.I.V.E. Superboy is knocked out by the Psycho-Pirate, with Krypto by his side. Later, the threat of Warworld looms high above the Earth. Batman and Superman are blackmailed into recruiting members of their 'clan' and Krypto shows up. He is shown whining after the mention of Superboy, who is suspected of being dead. Krypto assists Superman and Supergirl in fighting various groups of Warworld challengers, as a delaying tactic to save Earth from destruction. Thanks to the secretive efforts of Steel and Batgirl, no innocents are hurt. Superman becomes sick and voluntarily imprisons himself. Batman recruits Krypto on a mission to the Phantom Zone in an attempt to find a cure; instead they find something extremely dangerous. DC Rebirth In DC Rebirth, Superman's previous history prior to The New 52 is restored. Krypto is seen in the DC Rebirth continuity, as the family dog of Superman, Lois and their son Jon.Superman #3 (2016) His collar is made out of the belt of an old Superman uniform from the Fortress of Solitude, as a present from Jon.Action Comics #1000 (June 2018) Krypto is later seen as a loyal companion to Supergirl.Supergirl #34 (2019) Powers, abilities, and equipment In his original Pre-Crisis incarnation, Krypto possessed the same powers and abilities as an adult Kryptonian, although his physical abilities were proportionate to his smaller size and species. Certain sensory abilities of Krypto's (senses of smell and hearing) were more acute than those of Superman, just as an ordinary dog's senses would be more acute than those of a normal human. He also had super-canine intelligence (approximately human level, though with his canine traits and interests still present); the comics expressed this via the use of thought balloons indicating what Krypto was thinking. In his current incarnation, Krypto's abilities are essentially identical; however, he possesses normal canine intelligence, though as shown in the storyline with Atlas, Krypto does seem to have a general understanding of speech, and can take initiatives of his own, such as vowing to protect Metropolis from Atlas because of his knowledge of the fact that Superman himself protects and cares for the city, as well as vowing to hurt Atlas for hurting Superman.

Though his earlier appearances in Tiny Titans have him designed as a puppy, he appears older, taller, and with blue eyes in later issues and in Superman Family Adventures. In other media=Television * Krypto's first appearance outside the world of comics was as a companion of Superboy in The Adventures of Superboy, an occasional segment on the 1966 television cartoon The New Adventures of Superman. *DC Animated Universe ** One scene of the Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Deep Freeze\\" had a group of robotic toys which all resembled classic comic book characters; these included Bat-Mite, Mister Mxyzptlk, Streaky the Supercat, and Krypto. ** Krypto appeared as a simple puppy on Krypton in the first episode of the 1990s Superman: The Animated Series, \\"The Last Son of Krypton: Part 1\\", although he is not named. In the episode \\"Bizarro's World\\", Bizarro enters the Fortress of Solitude and releases a number of alien animals kept there, including a violent reptilian creature which Bizarro considers to be his \\"Krypto\\" (Bizarro Krypto), and both became fond of each other. ** In the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\", Krypto appears in Superman's dream as a pet of imagined son Van-El.

Krypto as he appeared in Cartoon Network's 2005 series Krypto the Superdog. * In April 2005, Cartoon Network debuted Krypto in his own series Krypto the Superdog, with Krypto voiced by Samuel Vincent. The series sees him team with fellow animal superheroes Streaky the Supercat, the Dog Star Patrol, and Ace the Bat-Hound. In this series, Krypto lives with a young boy named Kevin in a Metropolis suburb, and fights crime against various foes, including a space cyborg feline named Mechanikat and his feline agents (including his sidekick, the evil genius alien kitten Snooky Wookums), the Joker's pet hyenas Bud and Lou, the Penguin's trained birds (Artie the Puffin, Griff the Vulture, Waddles the Penguin), Catwoman's cat Isis, and Lex Luthor's pet green iguana Ignatius. This version of Krypto shares the origin of the original comic book version of Krypto, having been launched by Jor-El from Krypton in a similar turn of events, but he did not arrive till after Superman was already grown. Otherwise, the show is an original interpretation created just for this series, and is not based on any of the previous comic book versions. A noticeable change from the original is that this Krypto can talk, as can all of his other animal friends and enemies, and can be understood by his boy caretaker, Kevin, through the use of an ear-implanted translator. In this continuity, Superman knows full well about Krypto's existence but he decided that it was best the dog stay with Kevin, especially after realizing the existing bond between the two. * The Smallville television series featured the character in the episode titled \\"Krypto\\" during its fourth season. Although in this version, Krypto's powers seem to be limited to strength, developed as a product of experiments with kryptonite at Luther Corp, and are temporary. The dog is found by a teenage Lois Lane and brought to the Kent farm. In the final scene when the Kent family and Lois are deciding on a name, Lois drapes a red towel around the dog after giving it a bath, which mimics a cape. Clark considers naming him \\"Krypto\\". When Lex asks the meaning behind the name, Clark says that it's because of his cryptic origins. Lois dislikes the name, telling him, \\"You can call your next dog Krypto.\\" He eventually names the dog Shelby after one of Martha's old dogs. Clark feels that it was a better name over Lois' choice: \\"Clarky.\\" * The animated series Legion of Super-Heroes has featured creatures with the same design as Bizarro's Krypto, though they are larger. A dog nearly identical in appearance to the standard version of Krypto appeared in the episode \\"Message in a Bottle,\\" in the shrunken city of Kandor. He licks Superman's head to wake him up after he's been knocked out by Imperiex. When Brainiac 5 turns Kandor's sun from red to yellow, energizing the city's Krypton-descended inhabitants, this dog also receives superpowers. * Krypto appears in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Battle of the Superheroes!\\". When Superman is turned evil by the Red Kryptonite necklace that was unknowingly given to Lois Lane by Lex Luthor, Krypto teams up with Batman to hold off Superman until the effects of the Red Kryptonite wore off. * In the animated series Young Justice episode \\"Alpha Male\\" Superboy adopts a genetically altered white wolf. Kid Flash suggests naming the animal \\"Krypto\\", to which Miss Martian replies the name is already taken. Superboy decides to name him Wolf instead. In later episodes, Wolf is shown to have many similarities to Krypto, such as super strength and his partnership with Superboy. * Krypto appears in the \\"DC Super-Pets\\" sketch of DC Nation Shorts, voiced by David Kaye. * Krypto first appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"Best Day Ever\\", voiced by Jason J. Lewis. He later appears in episode \\"Unleashed\\", thwarting Red Lantern's Dex-Starr with help from Streaky the Supercat. * Krypto appears in the DC Universe series Titans, portrayed by dog actors Wrigley, Digby, and Lacey.

It is located in the Western Sovereign Base Area, one of two areas which comprise Akrotiri and Dhekelia, a British Overseas Territory, administered as a Sovereign Base Area. The station commander has a dual role and is also the officer commanding the Akrotiri or Western Sovereign Base Area, reporting to the commander of British Forces Cyprus who is also the Administrator. History=The beginning RAF Akrotiri was first constructed in the mid-1950s to relieve pressure on the main RAF station on the island, RAF Nicosia. Suez Crisis Location of RAF Akrotiri within the Western Sovereign Base Area In late 1956, relations between the United Kingdom and Egypt had reached a crisis. The Suez Crisis saw a further increase in the strength of RAF forces in Cyprus. Akrotiri was mainly an airfield for fighter, photo reconnaissance and ground attack aircraft. Its regular squadrons of Gloster Meteor night fighters, English Electric Canberra photo reconnaissance aircraft and de Havilland Venom ground attack machines were reinforced by further Canberras which were ready for action if Egypt attacked Israel. 1960s After the Suez Crisis, the main emphasis of life on the airfield shifted to helping quell the EOKA revolt and training missions. After the withdrawal from both Egypt and Iraq, and Suez Crisis, it was clear that a command centred on Cyprus could not control units stationed in the Arabian Peninsula, of which there were still many. Consequently, the Middle East Command was split, with that east of Suez being controlled from Aden, Yemen, and the remainder being renamed the Near East Command, controlled from Cyprus. From 1957 to 1969, four squadrons operating the Canberra (No. 6 Squadron, No. 32 Squadron, No. 73 Squadron, and No. 249 Squadron) provided first a conventional and then from November 1961, a nuclear striking capability as part of the Baghdad Pact, later the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO).Lee, 1989, 172-176. Akrotiri, along with Nicosia, assumed a very important status, as virtually the sole means for projecting British airpower into the eastern Mediterranean, outside of aircraft carriers. In 1960, independence was granted to Cyprus, with the RAF maintaining both RAF Nicosia and RAF Akrotiri as airfields, controlled by the Near East Air Force. However, Akrotiri assumed more importance as Nicosia was used for greater civil aviation traffic. After 1966, it was no longer possible to maintain RAF units at Nicosia due to pressures of space, and Akrotiri became the only RAF flying station left on the island. 1970s In August 1970, detachment \\"G\\" of the Central Intelligence Agency arrived at the airfield with Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft to monitor the Egypt/Israel Suez Canal fighting and cease fire. Permanent monitoring of Middle East Ceasefire was undertaken by the 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, known as Operation \\"OLIVE HARVEST\\". Up until 1974 RAF Akrotiri had a balanced force of aircraft assigned to it, including No. 9 Squadron and No. 35 Squadron, both flying Avro Vulcan strategic bombers. The Vulcans provided a bomber force for CENTO, one of the three main anti-Communist mutual defence pacts signed in the early days of the Cold War.See David Lee, Wings in the Sun: A History of the Royal Air Force in the Mediterranean 1945-1986, HMSO Books 1989 However, during that year, Turkish forces invaded Cyprus in connection with a Greek- sponsored coup. The UK then evacuated most of the RAF from Akrotiri as the CENTO treaty had degenerated to the point of uselessness. The two Vulcan squadrons left for UK stations in 1975. What was left at the airfield was the flying unit that is permanently assigned to the station to this day; No. 84 Squadron, a helicopter search and rescue unit. In addition, the role of No. 34 Squadron RAF Regiment provided support. In September 1976 the US U-2 operations were turned over to the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (9th SRW) but the U-2 operation at RAF Akrotiri continued to be called Operating Location (OLIVE HARVEST) OH until September 1980. Thereafter it became Detachment 3 of the 9th SRW, although the name OLIVE HARVEST continues. Two U-2s are stationed at RAF Akrotiri and they are still monitoring the ceasefire agreement between the Egypt and Israel although the present operations in the US Central Command area requires further missions. U-2s also transit through RAF Akrotiri either on going into the Central Command theatre or returning to Beale AFB, California. 1980s Due to the station's relative proximity to the Middle East, it was used for casualty reception for Americans after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. Between April 1983 and September 1984, RAF Boeing Chinooks helicopters deployed to Akrotiri in support of British United Nations Forces in Lebanon. In the mid-1980s, the US launched retaliatory attacks against Libya after the country's leader, Muammar al-Gaddafi, was implicated in attacks against US military bases. Although the bombing operations were staged out of the UK, Akrotiri was employed in the role of an alternate in case of emergency, and was used as such by at least one aircraft. This led to retaliatory action against the British base. 2010s An 11 Squadron Eurofighter Typhoon parked at RAF Akrotiri In July 2006, RAF Akrotiri played a major role as a transit point for personnel evacuations out of Lebanon during the 2006 Lebanon War (see International reactions to the 2006 Lebanon War and Joint Task Force Lebanon). Akrotiri was the location of the main transmitter of the well known numbers station, the Lincolnshire Poacher, although transmissions ceased in 2008. In March 2011, the station was used as a staging base for support aircraft involved in Operation Ellamy, the UK's contribution to the NATO-led military intervention in Libya. Tanker support and logistical units were based here to support aerial operations over the country. In August 2013, six RAF Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft were deployed to Akrotiri to defend the base, \\"to ensure the protection of UK interests and the defence of our sovereign base areas at a time of heightened tension in the wider region\\". Earlier two Lockheed Tristar air-to-air refuelling aircraft and a Boeing Sentry AEW1 had been deployed to Akrotiri. The station hosted the main hospital for British Forces Cyprus, The Princess Mary's Hospital (TPMH), located on Cape Zevgari. This closed in October 2012 and cases too serious to be dealt with at the base health clinic are sent to the private Ygia Polyclinic in Limassol. In August 2014, six RAF Panavia Tornado fighter/bombers were deployed to Akrotiri to carry out reconnaissance missions over Iraq, following the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. On 26 September 2014, Members of Parliament voted in favour of the RAF carrying out air strikes on Islamic State in Iraq, and on 27 September the first two Tornado jets took off from Akrotiri loaded with laser guided bombs and missiles. On 30 September 2014, two RAF British Tornados successfully attacked and intercepted ISIS targets of a heavily armed truck, at the request of Iraqi Kurdish fighters. The station was used to support the 2018 missile strikes against Syria. In June 2019, the station launched the RAF's first F-35 Lightning II operational sortie. Six aircraft were deployed to take part in operations against Islamic State. U.S. Marines helicopter at RAF Akrotiri Red Arrows flying over HMS Illustrious next to Akrotiri View of Akrotiri from the cockpit of a Hawk TMK1  Controversy = Radar  In 2007 a large over-the-horizon radar antenna was erected within the base. Several demonstrations and protests took place, with the most memorable incident being the act of MP (MEP since 2004) Marios Matsakis chaining himself to the antenna. Matsakis stated \\"It is outrageous that in the 21st century there are Cypriot villages living under British military rule, neither under their own government's jurisdiction nor under the protection of the EU treaties\\".  US surveillance flights  In 2010 the U-2s of the 9th Reconnaissance Wing were used in Operation Cedar Sweep to fly surveillance over Lebanon, relaying information about Hezbollah militants to Lebanese authorities, and in Operation Highland Warrior to fly surveillance over Turkey and northern Iraq to relay information to Turkish authorities. These flights were the topic of acrimonious diplomatic cables between British officials and the American embassy, later leaked by WikiLeaks, with David Miliband saying that \\"policymakers needed to get control of the military\\". The British were concerned that the flights over Lebanon were authorised by the Lebanese Ministry of Defence rather than the entire cabinet, and that the intelligence so gained could lead to the UK being complicit in the unlawful torture of detainees. After warnings that these issues \\"could jeopardize future use of British territory\\", John Rood, a senior Bush administration official, and Mariot Leslie, the Foreign Office's director general for defence and intelligence, became involved.

This system of fish hatcheries is now administered by the Fisheries Program of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior.  History  When early pioneers began migrating to the western United States, there were no catch limits on fish and no laws preventing people from modifying fish habitats to meet human needs for water, food, and safety. As settlement progressed, abundant fish populations began to decline. By 1870, growing concern for such declines prompted fishery studies, which spurred the establishment of fish spawning stations for collecting and hatching fish eggs and stocking small fish back into waters with declining fisheries. Many of these early spawning stations later became fish hatcheries, marking the beginning of the Fisheries Program and the NFHS. President Ulysses S. Grant was chiefly responsible for the first official government action to conserve U.S. fishery resources for future generations. President Grant established the U.S. Fish Commission in 1871. The Commission was the forerunner of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Fisheries Program. In 1872, the first Federal fish hatchery, known as the Baird Hatchery, was established on the McCloud River in California. The NFHS has since grown into a large complex system devoted to conserving U.S. fishery resources. Originally Spencer Fullerton Baird was chosen by President Ulysses S. Grant to manage the fisheries in the country. He was named \\"Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries\\". In 1871 Baird took office but his work was still in effect. The people were now understanding the importance of the fisheries, for sport and food. With much pressure from organizations such as; American Fish Cultural Association and American Fisheries Society, Congress reserved $15,000 for the fisheries. The man that was chosen to essentially take Baird's position was Livingston Stone. With a group of scientists his job was to find salmon spawning areas and develop a salmon hatchery so that the eggs could be managed and shipped around the country to make the salmon available for all. Stone and his team located this area and started shipping eggs as soon as possible. A few miles from where they had originally found the salmon eggs, rainbow trout eggs were also found. Now rainbow trout eggs and salmon eggs were being shipped across the world. Essentially every rainbow trout's native water is northern California. The Baird Hatchery was formed from Stone and today the hatchery still manages fish as they did back in the 1800s.http://nctc.fws.gov/History/Articles/FisheriesHistory.html Fisheries History  The Fisheries Program  The Service's Fisheries Program and its fish hatchery system have played a vital role in conserving America's fishery resources for over 130 years. The program was established mainly to address the following: * The growing concern over the observed decline in the United States' fishery resources; * the lack of information concerning the status of the Nation's fisheries; and * the need to define and protect U.S. fishing rights. The Fisheries Program has worked with valued partners including States, Native American tribes, Federal Agencies, other Service programs, and private interests in a larger effort to conserve fish and other aquatic resources.  Responsibilities  The original purpose of the NFHS was to supplement declining native stocks of coastal and lake food fish through fish propagation. The NFHS has extensive experience culturing over 100 different aquatic species, and now propagates fish for reasons beyond supplementing declining food species. Hatchery-reared fish are now used to replace fish that were lost from natural events including drought, flood, habitat destruction, or human influences such as over-harvest, pollution, habitat loss due to development and dam construction. This is necessary in order to establish fish populations that meet specific management needs, and to provide for the creation of new and expanded recreational fisheries opportunities. The role of the NFHS has changed significantly over the past 30 years as a result of the increasing demands recently placed upon various aquatic systems. Major responsibilities of the NFHS, besides mentioned fish propagation, now include helping to recover species listed under the Endangered Species Act, restoring native aquatic populations, mitigating for fisheries lost as a result of federal water projects, and providing fish to benefit Indian tribes and National Wildlife Refuges. NFHS concentrates its efforts on several fish species including lake trout, rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, paddlefish, and sturgeon. Other interesting species that the NFHS helps to restore include freshwater mussels and amphibians.  Conservation  The NFHS is able to conserve U.S. fishery resources by: * preserving the genes of wild and hatchery-raised fish; * restoring fish populations that have declined; * protecting threatened and endangered fish and restoring them to their native waters; * providing fish health services; * providing Native American tribes with native and recreation fisheries; * making up for the loss of fish as a result of Federal water projects, such as canals and dams; and * serving as education, outreach, and research stations  Achievements  Recently, the Service has maximized the output of its work force by integrating the work of fish hatcheries and fisheries management. This integrated effort has been successful, and has resulted in cohesive, more efficient national restoration programs, such as those for Great Lakes lake trout, Atlantic Coast striped bass, Atlantic salmon, and Pacific salmon. The Fisheries Program continues to work with its stakeholders‚ÄîFederal agencies, State resource agencies, Tribal governments, and private organizations‚Äî to complement habitat restoration and other resource management strategies for maintaining healthy ecosystems that support healthy fisheries. Currently, the system comprises 70 national fish hatcheries, 9 fish health centers, 7 fish technology centers, and a historic national fish hatchery.\\"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Fisheries National fish hatcheries are located in 35 states and produce more than 60 different species of fish.

He was best known for his comedy schoolboy character 'Bottler', the 1995 film Moondance, and his 1996 appearance in the Irish TV sitcom Father Ted as Father Fintan Stack. His 1975 song \\"The Combine Harvester\\" was a number one hit in Ireland, and his 1982 release of \\"The Dutchman\\" is considered to be one of the most enduring versions of the song. Early life Born in the heart of Dublin in 1951, Grace was raised on Echlin Street, in the inner city Liberties neighbourhood. His father Seamus worked as a bartender, an ambulance man and other odd jobs to keep the family going. Like many young Dubliners of the time, Grace left school at the age of 13 to begin working. His first job was as a messenger boy, an occupation he often referred to in his live act. Music career At the age of 18, Grace formed a band known as the Gingermen. They toured Ireland in what has become known as the showband era of the 1960s, although the Gingermen were a folk group rather than a showband. During a gig one night, the band found themselves two members short; in an attempt to calm an anxious crowd, Grace was thrust upon the stage to humour them. His wit and observations of daily life in Ireland immediately won over the crowd, and he would go on to sell out venues around the globe. He shared stages with many well-known names, such as Frank Sinatra, who referred to Grace as his \\"man in Europe\\", and John Denver, among many others. Grace's hit songs included \\"Cushie Butterfield\\", \\"The Combine Harvester\\"‚Äîwhich topped the charts in Ireland in 1975, and in 1976 was a UK number one hit for The Wurzels‚Äîand \\"The Dutchman\\". Acting career In 1995, Grace starred in Moondance, and the following year he appeared in the Father Ted episode \\"New Jack City\\" as Father Fintan Stack. In 2007, he appeared as Big Sean in Killinaskully, and in 2015, he starred in The Gift. He also reprised his Bottler character in a TV movie also called Bottler in November 2013. It tells of Bottler's exploits in his early years. Personal life Grace married Eileen Doyle in 1973. They had four children, Melanie, Brendan, Amanda, and Bradley. The latter is best known as a member of the American metalcore band Poison the Well. In November 2009, Grace released his autobiography, Amuzing Grace (). In his later life, he divided his time between his home in Jupiter, Florida, and his pub in Killaloe, County Clare, which he named Brendan Grace's Bar. Grace was diagnosed with pneumonia in June 2019, and died from lung cancer at the Galway Clinic in Galway, Ireland, on 11 July 2019, aged 68. His funeral took place on 15 July at the Church of St. Nicholas of Myra in Dublin, followed by cremation. The funeral was attended by thousands of fans who lined the streets outside the church as well as along the procession route, which included stops outside the Guinness brewery and Grace's childhood home on Echlin Street.

Those performing the piercing may use a pennington clamp to better guide the needle through the skin. A curved barbell is the most common jewellery inserted post-piercing. A piercing of underneath the eye is known as an anti- eyebrow piercing. A horizontal piercing of the eyebrow is known as a horizontal eyebrow piercing. Jewelry Barbells, curved barbells and captive bead rings are the common jewelry types worn in eyebrow piercings. Each of these jewelry types put varying degrees of pressure on the piercing, which can cause irritation or piercing migration over time. The larger the gauge used in the piercing, the less likely the piercing is to be rejected or accidentally torn out. Sixteen gauge piercings and jewelry is common. Placement The placement of the eyebrow piercing varies according to the will of the one receiving the piercing. The area may be pierced anywhere along the eyebrow from directly above the eye, to the edge of the eyebrow by the temple. Care must be taken if the eyebrow is pierced further in than directly above the eye, because of the presence of supra-orbital nerves. Piercing the eyebrow is safe.¬© Cheyenne Morrison, The Piercing Temple, Australia 98 Healing After the piercing is completed, the healing process takes a minimum of six weeks to eight weeks for the wound to close properly around the piercing, and it may be six months to a year before the jewellery can be removed for any length of time without the hole closing. It is common for an eyebrow piercing to produce a sticky white discharge or a crust around the jewellery during the healing process. Complications, when reported, are usually fixed with a short-term round of antibiotics. A light bruise is common, due to the high amount of capillaries in the eyebrow and the proximity to the surface of the skin. Sudden pain in the area of the piercing could be a potential sign of infection, and should be checked by a professional immediately. History and culture Body piercing has been performed in many cultures for millennia, usually as part of a rite of passage or to identify a person as courageous, strong, or worthy. Eyebrow piercing, however, has a short history. It was introduced by the punk subculture in the 1970s as a fashion statement.

'Duncan Hallas: Death of a Trotskyist' Ed. McIlroy, J. Revolutionary History Vol. 8:4 pg.260 In 1940, he met a woman selling Socialist Appeal at an Engineering Apprentices College where he was on day release and he joined the Trotskyist Workers International League in 1940Harris, N. \\"Duncan Hallas: Death of a Trotskyist\\" Ed. McIlroy, J. Revolutionary History Vol. 8:4 pg.261 and then its successor organisation the Revolutionary Communist Party while still a young worker during the Second World War. Conscripted into the First Lancashire Regiment in 1943, he served in France, Belgium and Germany and he was also involved in the mutiny in Egypt after the end of the war, earning him three months in military prison. When factional disputes broke out in The Club (the name adopted by British Trotskyists after entering the Labour Party) Hallas became a supporter of Tony Cliff's positions. Hallas was a founder member of the tiny Socialist Review Group when it was organised in 1951 and wrote its only major founding document not authored by Cliff, \\"On the Stalinist Parties\\".On the Stalinist Parties He also wrote a number of articles for the early issues of Socialist Review. After his job took him to Scotland in 1954/55 he effectively dropped out of the group, although he remained politically active in the National Union of Teachers and elsewhere. With the upsurge in left-wing political activity in 1968 Hallas joined the International Socialists (IS) and rapidly became a member of the group's leadership and a full-time worker at its headquarters. However, Hallas, along with some other leading members, became concerned about Tony Cliff's increasing tendency to take decisions without consulting leadership bodies. Hallas initiated an oppositional group alongside John Palmer and Jim Higgins. However, when this oppositional group became a formal faction, the International Socialist Opposition (ISO), Hallas broke with it. He remained within the IS when the ISO's members were expelled, becoming a leading figure in its successor organisation, the Socialist Workers Party, until his retirement from active politics, owing to ill health, in 1995. Hallas was the author of many articles for the publications of the IS/SWP group and of a short guide to the politics of Leon Trotsky.

Subsequently, the region that is today Portugal has been colonized by many civilizations, which have left marks in the territory, constructing markers, defensive structures, homes and places of worship to suit their requirements and means. The formal organization of the Portuguese state resulted in a process to qualify and quantify those structures that have had an intrinsic value to the Portuguese culture. Starting with the Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGMEN), and later by the Instituto de Gest√£o do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico e Arqueol√≥gico (IGESPAR), the Portuguese government developed a registry of national monuments that includes a rich heritage of historical monuments throughout the country. This is a compilation of those structures that are designated as National Monuments only. History The headquarters of IGESPAR (Institute for the Management of Architectural and Archaeological Heritage), the institute that succeeded the DEGMEN, located in a portion of the Palace of Ajuda The Fort of Sacav√©m, the home to SIPA (Information System of Patrimonial Architecture), the database for nationally registered monuments The first documented peoples to occupy the western coast of Iberia were the \\"Ostrimni\\" recorded in Ancient Latin poetry, whose territory stretched from Galicia (in northwestern Spain) to the Algarve (southern area of Portugal). The Greeks called the area of Portugal Ophiussa, and its inhabitants the Ophi. The serpent-worshipping Ophis are believed to have been a Celtic culture. These areas were eventually conquered, settled and assimilated by Indo-European peoples, made up of two probable invasions, the first by Proto-Celts who became the celebrated Lusitanians and the second by more developed Celts. Phoenicians also settled in trading posts along the coast and may have had contact with the assumably proto-Celtic Lusitanians, who, along with the Celtic Gallaeci, Celtici, Conii and Turduli became the base of the modern Portuguese ethnicity and culture. The Lusitanians along with the Gallaeci developed the Castro culture at the time of their invasion by the legions of Rome. A formal organization of what would become Portugal began with the Roman occupation of the peninsula, which were responsible for re-purposing many of the castro settlements and moving the settlements from the hills to the valleys in the region. In the process, they constructed new buildings, established modern infrastructures (including internal water and baths) and a road network that connected Roman villas. Although there are many excavated ruins throughout the country, of particular importance are the Roman ruins of Con√≠mbriga (Condeixa-a-Nova), in addition to many vestiges that encountered in the cities of Lisbon or √âvora. The disorganization in the Roman empire, which led to its fall, allowed the conquest by the Visigoths and the Christian Suevi in later years, along with other Germanic tribes. Many of the structures that survived this period include ancient churches and inscriptions built over previous constructions, which were the centre of Lusitanian settlements. Early Christian influences persisted for several centuries, until the Moors and Arab Berber peoples (from North Africa) invaded the Peninsula, including all of the territory which would eventually become Portugal. The Moors were first to construct many of the medieval castles that dot the landscapes of Portugal. From the northern enclaves (Galicia and Asturias in Portugal's case), the Christian Reconquista began, expanding progressively south towards the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. This was not a permanent expansion, since the Moorish-Christian frontier continued to expand and retract for several years, with the victories and defeats of each battle. Meanwhile, Portugal became a county of the Kingdom of Le√≥n and briefly during the independence of the Kingdom of Galicia in the 1060s and 1070s. It became an autonomous dominion of the Kingdom of Le√≥n in 1128, emerging as a fully independent kingdom in 1139, officially recognized by the Treaty of Zamora in 1143. After this period, and with the rise of the Portuguese state after the beginning of the Age of Discovery, Portuguese architecture expanded under the patronage of the wealthy kings, nobility, powerful clergy and through the many battles with rivals such as Castile, the French and Dutch. During these periods, many of the prominent buildings were destroyed, rebuilt, re-purposed and closed on the whims of the monarchy, which progressively used architectural projects to support their power, remember past glories or expand their position in the Iberian peninsula. With the demise of the powerful clergy and religious orders, and eventually the fall of the monarchy in Portugal, many of the once important buildings in the country were either reused as seats of governmental power, abandoned into ruin or reused as museum, although some remained places of public use (such as the religious places of worship). The 20th century movement to restore and preserve the architectural history of Portugal was initiated under the Direc√ß√£o Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (DGMEN) during the Estado Novo regime in order to inventory national treasures and preserve existing monuments. National monuments Although there are numerous monuments from various ages some of them have a special value due to their historical, architectural, artistic and cultural importance. These monuments are classified and protected by the Instituto de Gest√£o do Patrim√≥nio Arquitect√≥nico e Arqueol√≥gico (IGESPAR) (Institute for the Management of Architectural and Archaeological Heritage), which classifies national treasures in terms of several general criteria: historic and cultural, aesthetic and social, technical and scientific, but also includes issues of integrity, authenticity and exemplary importance. Owing to its relative value and importance, the cultural property may be listed as or national, public or municipal interest. In addition, these definitions are also defined in terms of being monuments, groups of buildings or sites, based on existing international conventions. IGESPAR regularly proposes the listing of new assets based on its mission to safeguard national heritage. As time goes by, a wide variety of new buildings and groups of structures of varying typologies have been added to the national register of monuments, such modernist architecture, vernacular landscapes, archaeological sites, monastic buildings/structures, historical gardens, and more recently human-built business and industrial establishments. The listing process follows a strict procedure defined by Decree-Law no. 309/2009 (23 October 2009), which entered into force in January 2010. IGESPAR also monitors and participates in the UNESCO registry of World Heritage Sites as a member state: there are 13 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in territory of Portugal. Similarly, eleven assets in the UNESCO world heritage list of 878 sites were former Portuguese possessions at one time, spread across three continents (Africa, America and Asia) associated with period of Portuguese Discoveries.

It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Oberallg√§u, Unterallg√§u, Augsburg, Landsberg, Weilheim-Schongau and Garmisch-Partenkirchen, and by the Austrian state of Tyrol. The town of Kaufbeuren is enclosed by but does not belong to the district. History Before 1803 the region was split into several tiny states, most of them clerical states. When these states were dissolved in 1803, the Ostallg√§u region became part of Bavaria. The kings of Bavaria soon developed a special relationship with the region and built their famous castles of Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein there. The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of Kaufbeuren, Marktoberdorf and F√ºssen. Geography \\"Ostallg√§u\\" literally means \\"Eastern Allg√§u\\". The term Allg√§u is applied to the part of the Alps located in Swabia and their northern foothills. The district extends from the crest of the Alps to hilly countryside in the north. It is located on either side of the Wertach, an affluent of the Lech River. In the south there is a great number of alpine lakes, the largest of them being the Forggensee ().

Valeri was the Government House Leader in Paul Martin's government from 2004 until 2006. He was narrowly defeated by New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Wayne Marston in the 2006 general election held on January 23, 2006. Biography Valeri grew up in Hamilton's north-end in the working class Barton and Sherman neighbourhood, the son of Italian immigrants Enzo and Maria Valeri, who arrived in Hamilton in the early 1950s. He graduated from Bishop Ryan High School and then attended McMaster University, earning a BA in Economics. Prior to his political career, Valeri served as President of Canadian Financial Group Ltd. Valeri represented the ridings of Lincoln (1993‚Äì1997), then Stoney Creek (1997‚Äì2004) and Hamilton East‚ÄîStoney Creek (2004‚Äì2006). Valeri lives with his wife Terri and children, Anthony and Luca in Stoney Creek. Parliamentary career Valeri first ran for office in the 1993 election, winning the Liberal Party nomination over former cabinet minister John Munro, and easily won in the Liberal sweep of Ontario. Valeri served as a backbencher and was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance in 1997. He was appointed to the Cabinet on December 12, 2003, by incoming Prime Minister Paul Martin. Valeri is known for his close ties to industry and business, and his appointment to the transport portfolio was viewed positively by this group. He was also known as a supporter of the Red Hill Valley Parkway. 2004 nomination contest In 2004, the decennial redistribution process took place and Valeri's old riding of Stoney Creek, which straddled the border between Hamilton and Grimsby, was split in two. A part of Valeri's Stoney Creek riding was merged with a part of Hamilton - East. A slight majority of the constituents of the new riding of Hamilton East - Stoney Creek were from Valeri's former riding. Although the other Hamilton-area Members of Parliament shifted to the eastward half of their ridings, in Valeri's case this would have meant shifting from a suburban Hamilton riding to the rural Niagara West‚ÄîGlanbrook riding, where he would have faced a difficult battle with a candidate of the Conservative Party of Canada. He therefore decided to run in the western half of his former riding, resulting in a passionate nomination battle with former cabinet heavyweight and party leadership candidate Sheila Copps. Some accused Martin of orchestrating these events to try to expel the left-leaning Copps from the House of Commons. Copps pointed out that Valeri lived in the Niagara West-Glanbrook riding that also included around 43% of his old constituents and an airport, the latter which complemented his Transport Ministry. In response, Valeri pointed out that Copps no longer lived in Hamilton, no Member of Parliament enjoyed any entitlement to any constituency without a nomination meeting and the majority of the constituents of Hamilton East‚ÄîStoney Creek in fact originated from his Stoney Creek riding. On March 6, 2004, Valeri won the nomination by 311 votes. Stelco's economic troubles and the large pension deficit galvanized support for New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Tony DePaulo in Hamilton East‚ÄîStoney Creek. The conflict with Copps, public reaction to the first budget of the Ontario Liberals, as well as the government's sinking fortunes, almost cost him his seat, but he was narrowly (less than 1,000 votes) re-elected on June 28, 2004. Government House Leader On July 20, 2004, he was appointed to the sensitive position of Government House Leader in Paul Martin's minority government. Valeri's appointment to the position of House Leader was originally questioned by many, however Valeri was able to establish a working relationship with his counterparts. As noted by Libby Davies, NDP House Leader, \\"We had some crazy moments but we always got down to business in a real way. It was a pleasure to work with (Valeri).\\" Former Conservative House Leader John Reynolds noted that \\"Tony was a great House Leader. A man of integrity and good humour.\\" In his 2008 memoir, entitled Hell Or High Water: My Life In And Out of Politics (), former Prime Minister Paul Martin labeled Valeri as ‚Äúone of the most gifted House Leaders of recent times.‚Äù 2006 re- election bid On January 23, 2006, Valeri was narrowly defeated by a margin of less than 500 votes by the New Democratic Party candidate Wayne Marston. During the election, the Hamilton Spectator reported that Valeri had purchased a property for $225,000 only to later sell it to a Liberal supporter for $500,000 a few months later. While Valeri insisted that the Ethics Commissioner had cleared the transaction, lingering doubts about the sale remained. Post-political career After his election defeat, Valeri established a public affairs and strategic consulting business and held a residence position within the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University. Given the very narrow margin of his defeat in the 2006 election, some had speculated that Valeri would seek a return to politics in the Hamilton East‚ÄîStoney Creek riding. At the Gala Tribute held in his honour, Valeri indicated that he wants to continue to serve the people of Hamilton and Stoney Creek, leaving open the option of a return to federal politics.. However, on April 15, 2007, former Hamilton mayor Larry Di Ianni was nominated as the Liberal candidate for Hamilton East‚ÄîStoney Creek for the next federal election, precluding a rematch between Valeri and Marston at least for now. On December 5, 2007, the Hamilton Port Authority named Valeri its interim CEO effective on December 17, 2007. He left the post in 2008. As of June 2011, Valeri has held the position of Vice President Public Affairs at ArcelorMittal Dofasco in Hamilton. Since leaving public office Valeri remained actively involved in the community. Valeri is the past Chair of the St. Joseph‚Äôs Hamilton Healthcare Board of Trustees, a Director on the Board of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters and a member of the McMaster Board of Governors.

Astronomy Beer's fame derives from his hobby, astronomy. He built a private observatory with a 9.5 cm refractor in Tiergarten, Berlin. Together with Johann Heinrich M√§dler he produced the first exact map of the Moon (entitled Mappa Selenographica) in 1834-1836, and in 1837 published a description of the Moon (Der Mond nach seinen kosmischen und individuellen Verh√§ltnissen). Both remained the best descriptions of the Moon for many decades. In 1830, Beer and M√§dler created the first globe of the planet Mars. In 1840 they made a map of Mars and calculated its rotation period to be 24 h 37 min 22.7 s, only 0.1 seconds different from the actual period as it is known today. Other work In addition to his hobby of astronomy, he helped with the establishment of a railway system in Prussia, and promoted the Jewish community in Berlin. In his last decade of life, he worked as a writer and politician. In 1849 he was elected as an MP for the first chamber of the Prussian parliament. Named after Beer The crater Beer on Mars is named in Wilhelm Beer's honor and lies near M√§dler. There is also a crater called Beer on the Moon.

A performer of joik is called a joikaaja (in Finnish), a joiker (in Norwegian, and anglicised) or jojkare (in Swedish). Originally, joik referred to only one of several Sami singing styles, but in English the word is often used to refer to all types of traditional Sami singing. As an art form, each joik is meant to reflect or evoke a person, animal, or place.. The sound of joik is comparable to the traditional chanting of some Native American cultures.Wimme Saari Shamanistic chant meets modern electronics Joik shares some features with the shamanistic cultures of Siberia, which mimic the sounds of nature. History As the Sami culture had no written language in the past, the origins of joik are not documented. According to oral traditions, the fairies and elves of the arctic lands gave joiks to the S√°mi People. Just Qvigstad, who recorded the Sami oral tradition, has documented this legend in several works. Music researchers believe joik is one of the oldest continuous musical traditions in Europe. During the Christianization of the Sami, joiking was condemned as sinful. The assimilation policies (Norwegianization and similar) and the views of churches and ecclesiastical movements on joiking as sin have played important roles in its devaluation. One of the reasons that joiking was controversial may be its association with noaidi (S√°mi shamans) and pre-Christian mythology rituals, with joiking said to resemble magic spells.Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64 In the 1950s, it was forbidden to use joiking in Sami area schools. In 2014, a parish council discussed \\"if they should implement a total ban against music other than [church] hymns in the churches in Kautokeino and Maze. The proposal was shot down, but many still wonder why joiking in church is such a controversial issue\\". Despite this suppression, joiking was strongly rooted in the culture and its tradition was maintained. Joiking is still practiced and is used as a source of inspiration. Recently, joiks are sung in two different styles: a traditional style, known as the \\"mumbling\\" style; and a modern style sung mostly by young people, and used as an element in contemporary Sami music.  Personal and evocative nature  The joik is a unique form of cultural expression for the Sami people in S√°pmi.Yoik of the Wind Shamanistic chant meets modern electronics This type of song can be deeply personal or spiritual in nature, often dedicated to a human being, an animal, or a landscape as a personal signature.Tradisjonell klassisk joik - Traditional Classical Sami Yoik - Arbevirolas Luohti Improvisation is not unusual. Each joik is meant to reflect a person or place. The Sami verb for presenting a joik (e.g. Northern Sami juoigat) is a transitive verb, which is often interpreted as indicating that a joik is not a song about the person or place, but that the joiker is attempting to evoke or depict that person or place through song - one joiks one's friend, not about one's friend (similarly to how one doesn't paint or depict about a flower, but depicts the flower itself). Musical and lyrical forms Traditionally, joiks have short lyrics or no lyrics at all. However, there are other forms of joik (in the expanded sense of the word) that have a more epic type of lyrics. Joik is traditionally chanted a cappella, but in modern times may be accompanied by a drum (though not a Sami drum, which is used for ceremonial purposes only) or other musical instruments. The tonality of joik is mostly pentatonic, but joikers are at liberty to use any tones they please. In northern Sami areas, most joiks are personal, that is, tied to a specific person. A joik is often made for a person at the time he or she is born. British actress Joanna Lumley experienced several joiks during her travel program Joanna Lumley in the Land of the Northern Lights, joining a northern Sami elder. Lumley learned that there appeared not to be a joik of the Aurora, and that the Sami do not talk much about them. Joiking encompasses different styles: * Vuolle is a South Sami joiking with an old-world feel, since its development was halted in the face of Christianity. To avoid being seen as savage or heathen, the South Sami mostly stopped joiking. * Luohti is the North Sami variant and currently the most-developed joiking style. Leu πdd, known from the East S√°mi tradition is not a variant of joik, but a rather different kind of singing. Imitative sounds and shamanism Some of the Sami people's traditional Noaidi beliefs and practices shared important features with those of some Siberian cultures.Voigt 1966: 296 Some of their joiks were sung during shamanistic rites,Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76 and this memory is conserved also in a folklore text (a shaman story).Voigt 1966: 145 As in various cultures of Northern Asia, mimicking sounds from nature can also be present. Joiking in popular culture Even though joiking is a traditional form of singing, it has found its way into modern-day pop culture through adaptation and commercialization by various artists. One notable example is the 1980 Norwegian entry \\"S√°miid √¶dnan\\" for the Eurovision Song Contest, which features a song predominantly sung in Norwegian and interwoven with joiking in its chorus. Subsequently, this song has been occasionally used as a game chant by Norwegian football fans, as well as British fans from the Accrington Stanley F.C.. Furthermore, an uncredited sample of this song was featured in the 2011 science-fiction horror film The Thing. The Norwegian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, Spirit in the Sky, also has lines of joik in the chorus, and includes a joik solo. Through its inclusion in other popular films, the Sami culture and joiking in particular has managed to achieve national acclaim. Of particular note is Disney's Frozen, which is heavily inspired by Scandinavian and Sami culture. This is evident in its use of typical elements of the Sami people, including reindeer herding and outfit styles. Furthermore, South Sami musician and joiker Frode Fjellheim composed the opening track of Frozen, titled \\"Vuelie\\", which is an adaptation of his original track \\"Eatnemen Vuelie (Song of the Earth)\\". This growing adaptation of Sami elements, in particular joiking, points towards a gradual revitalization of the culture. Joiking is also an important element of the Sami Grand Prix, an annual music competition modeled after the Eurovision Song Contest. This competition draws contestants from Norway, Sweden and Finland, with strong representation from minorities belonging to the Sami community. The traditional art form is significant in both the joik and song competition of the Grand Prix. In the joik component, contestants, usually dressed in traditional Sami clothing, perform joiks that are specifically prepared for the competition, without any accompanying instruments. The succeeding song component features participants who often incorporate elements of joiking into their pop entries, which suggests a revival and growing appeal of infusing traditional Sami musical practices with modern-day music. In addition, the 1970s proved to be a fruitful period for the Sami people and joik music in particular, with what academics have coined the \\"joik renaissance\\". Specifically, the emergence of Sami-owned record company, J√•rgal√¶ddji, in Norway, that resulted from a collaboration between Sami musicians. As a result, it became easier for Sami artistes and producers to gain funding for their projects, with over 40 albums and cassettes of Sami and joik music released in that period. Sources of funding included not only private investors, but also the Norwegian and Swedish culture boards. This led to an unprecedented commercialization of Sami music, as well as the performance of joiking, which was a crucial focus of the J√•rgal√¶ddji. While the bankruptcy of this record company in the mid-1980s led to a slowdown in production of Sami and joik albums, such growth led to a resurgence of interest in traditional Sami culture and music. Other artists who are famous for their interpretations of joik include Mari Boine, Jon Henrik Fj√§llgren and the band Korpiklaani, who have combined joiks with various other styles such as jazz, metal and rock. In particular, Fjallgren won the Swedish Talang 2014 competition, a reality talent show, through his moving rendition of traditional joik songs. He subsequently released a debut studio album in 2014, Goeksegh, which features multiple joik tracks such as \\"Daniel‚Äôs Joik\\", \\"The Reindeer Herder‚Äôs Joik\\", and \\"Nejla‚Äôs Joik\\", and took part several times in Melodifestivalen, Sweden's Eurovision selection, with joik songs. Notable artists *Adj√°gas, a Norwegian band, has forwarded joiking around the world. *√Åillo≈°, a S√°mi actor, composer and folk musician from Norway. *Nils Mattias Andersson (1882‚Äì1975) was a joiker from Sweden. *Angelit is a Finnish Sami folk group which has similarly evolved their joik musical traditions. *Mari Boine from Norway is one of the most popular artists of her Sami culture. She blends elements of joik with other idioms, including jazz, rock, and world music. *Fred-Ren√© Buljo is a Norwegian joiker and rapper who, as one-third of the supergroup KEiiNO, represented Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 with the song, \\"Spirit in the Sky\\". *Jon Henrik Fj√§llgren is a Colombian-born Swedish singer and jojkare, an interpreter of Joik Sami songs, winner of the Swedish Talang Sverige 2014 competition, and three-time participant in Melodifestivalen (2015, 2017 and 2019) with the songs \\"Jag √§r fri (Manne leam frijje)\\", \\"En v√§rld full av strider (Eatneme gusnie jeenh d√•aroeh)\\" (featuring Aninia) and \\"Norrsken (Goeksegh)\\", coming 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, respectively. *Frode Fjellheim is a widely known joiker, front-man of Transjoik. Fjellheim contributed the joik \\"Eatnamen Vuelie\\" (\\"Song of the Earth\\") as the opening song to Frozen. *Antye Greie's record Source Voice contains one track titled \\"Digital Yoik\\", inspired by her time spent with Sami people in Northern Finland. *Mattis H√¶tta is a Norwegian joiker and singer who, together with Sverre Kjelsberg, represented Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980 with the song, \\"S√°miid √¶dnan\\". *Inga Juuso is a Norwegian joiker, actress and artist born in Jokkmokk, Sweden in 1945 and grew up in Alta, Norway. She passed in 2014. She was one of the major contributors to the S√°mi music and culture. *Sofia Jannok is a Swedish singer from G√§llivare, Sweden. She mainly sings in Sami and does joiking. *Jonne J√§rvel√§ of the Finnish band Korpiklaani (formerly known as Shaman) is proficient at joiking, though little-known outside the folk metal circuit. Both of Shaman's albums were labeled as \\"joik metal\\", drawing heavily from Sami music. After the name-change, the band switched to a more conventional folk-metal sound. He was also featured on the Jaktens Tid album of fellow Finnish folk metal band, Finntroll. *Ulla Pirttij√§rvi mixes traditional joik with more modern musical trends. *Wimme Saari is one of the world's most renowned Sami artists and traditional musicians, whose use of joik is a central factor in his music.

The size of the court, net height, rackets, are the same, but there are two major differences from pedestrian tennis: athletes use specially designed wheelchairs, and the ball may bounce up to two times, where the second bounce may also occur outside the court. Wheelchair tennis is played at Grand Slams, and is one of the sports contested at the Summer Paralympics. There are three categories; Men, Women, and Quads; each category has singles and doubles tournaments. The Quad, the newest division, is for players that have substantial loss of function in at least one upper limb, but may include various disabilities besides quadriplegia. The division is sometimes called Mixed, especially at the Paralympic Games. Quad players often tape the rackets to their hand, to compensate for loss of function, and some players are allowed to use electric-powered wheelchairs. History Wheelchair tennis increased in popularity in 1976 due to the efforts of Brad Parks, who is seen as the creator of competitive wheelchair tennis. In 1982, France became the first country in Europe to put a wheelchair tennis program in place. Since then, much effort has been made to promote the sport at the elite-level. The sport quickly became popular worldwide and was introduced to the Paralympic Games as a demonstration event at the Seoul 1988 Summer Paralympics. In 1990, wheelchair tennis was played alongside the able-bodied players' event in Miami. This continued for more than 15 years. It was at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona that wheelchair tennis acquired the status of a full- fledged competition. The 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney boosted public appreciation immensely and led to the introduction of the sport to the four annual Grand Slams of Tennis. In 2004, after the efforts of Rick Draney, the Quad category was added to the Paralympic Games. The Wheelchair Tennis Class 8s at the 2002 Australian Open saw competitive wheelchair tennis take place at the same time and the same venue at a Grand Slam for the first time. In 2005 the Masters series was created, comprising all the events at the Grand Slams and the end of year championships, as Wimbledon and the US Open joined Melbourne. In 2007 Roland Garros joined and the Classic 8s were replaced by the Australian Open which had been held at the same venue two weeks later. In 2009 all events played at the able-bodied players' Grand Slams were renamed Grand Slams. The Netherlands has dominated, with numerous victories at major tournaments including the Paralympic Games and the Grand Slams. Esther Vergeer holds the record for winning four Paralympic gold medals - one each at the 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 Games. She holds the record for most consecutive wheelchair singles matches won. For the 2013 season the ITF decided to adopt match tiebreakers in place of a third and deciding set in doubles matches. However the tiebreaker would only be used at events which were rated as ITF1 or lower and at the World Team Cup. The grand slams, however, were free to decide on the format of their tournaments.  Major tournaments  The ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour consists of international tournaments with different grades and prize money. The wheelchair tennis tournaments are graded by the ITF. Total prize money for the tour in 2016 was over $2million. The wheelchair tennis tour includes the following types of tournaments: * Grand Slams * Masters * ITF Super Series * ITF 1 Series * ITF 2 Series * ITF 3 Series * ITF Futures Series The four Grand Slams ‚Äì Australian Open, Wimbledon, Roland Garros, and US Open ‚Äì include a wheelchair tennis draw. Until 2018, only the US Open and Australian Open offered a quad draw, and only four Quad players are invited (as opposed to eight for men and women). In 2018, a Quad Wheelchair Doubles Exhibition match was played at Wimbledon. Later that year, it was announced that Wimbledon would offer a quad draw in both singles and doubles, starting in 2019.https://www.skysports.com/tennis/news/12110/11439862/the-history-boys- how-the-quads-paved-the-way-for-future- generationshttps://www.skysports.com/tennis/news/12110/11549179/gerry- armstrong-appointed-championships-referee-designate On early February 2019, Roland Garros announced that on the same year, its competition would start including wheelchair quads draws. The Super Series events include the Bendigo Open (Bendigo), Cajun Classic (Baton Rouge), British Open (Nottingham), Japan Open (Iizuka), US Open USTA Championships (St. Louis) and Open de France (Paris). The ITF publishes a year-long calendar with all tournaments and their respective grades. The ITF BNP Paribas World Team Cup is a wheelchair tennis tournament for national teams, held annually since 1985. The BNP Paribas World Team Cup World Group event is played once a year, for men, women, quads and juniors. There are four continental qualification events in Europe, Africa, Asia and Americas, in which men and women compete to qualify for the main event. The last two major tournaments of the year are the Wheelchair Tennis Masters (singles event) and Uniqlo Wheelchair Doubles Masters. The top eight men, top eight women and top six quads based on ranking are invited to compete there each year. Wheelchair tennis is played at the Paralympic Games and FESPIC games as well.

Monolith and a number of other video game developers have used LithTech as the basis for their first-person shooter games. Monolith initially developed the engine for Microsoft before purchasing the rights to it and licensing it to other developers via subsidiary LithTech Inc. The licensing company was renamed to Touchdown Entertainment in 2003 and later absorbed into Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment after its acquisition of Monolith. The last version of LithTech offered for licensing was Jupiter EX, initially released in 2005, however Monolith has continued to use LithTech technology in their games, including Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, released in 2014. After the release of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, the studio started working on a new engine (based on LithTech technology) for larger-scale battles called \\"Firebird\\". Versions=LithTech 1.0 Originally the LithTech engine was supposed to be called DirectEngine, as Monolith was developing it for Microsoft to be included as a 3D engine for use with Microsoft's DirectX technology. When Microsoft decided not to use the engine Monolith bought back the rights to it and continued development on their own. They changed the engine's name to Lithtech and licensed it to other companies. In the following years, the LithTech team was split off into a separate company, LithTech Inc., which was renamed Touchdown Entertainment in March 2003. LithTech 2.0 Starting with LithTech 2.0, LithTech Inc. began the process of creating many different versions of the engine. Monolith released their game No One Lives Forever (NOLF) featuring this version of the engine, however it was later revised to LithTech 2.2. The game received an upgrade to LithTech 2.2 in a patch release. The LithTech team then continued to improve version 2.2 for its licensees, resulting in the 2.3 and 2.4 iterations. LithTech cooperated with RealNetworks in developing a custom version of LithTech 2.2 called RealArcade LithTech (or LithTech ESD). Among its features it supported streaming media for in-game billboards/ads, and could be used with RealNetworks' gaming site. At one time, RealArcade LithTech could be licensed by developers if they signed an agreement with RealNetworks. This engine was used on an internally developed title, Tex Atomic's Big Bot Battles. LithTech Talon LithTech Inc. developed a different engine specifically for Monolith's title, Aliens versus Predator 2. LithTech Talon was based on LithTech 2.2, rather than LithTech 2.4. Because of this choice, LithTech 2.4, RealArcade LithTech, and LithTech Talon became largely incompatible with each other. However, reviewers still thought of it as inferior to Unreal or id Tech. LithTech Talon's biggest selling point lay in its capable multiplayer support, more efficient when compared to prior versions of LithTech multiplayer that featured poor networking code. Aliens versus Predator 2 features comprehensive multiplayer gameplay utilizing these improvements. By 2003, Talon was still being licensed. LithTech 3.0 LithTech 3.0 was being developed concurrently with Talon, but, along with its revisions, LithTech 3.x would largely be considered an internal version of the engine. While it was sent to licensees, no games were finished on it. The primary feature announced for LithTech 3.x was the Distributed Object System, a new system for MMORPGs and multiplayer. Unfortunately, LithTech 3.x was also plagued by a significant number of bugs and problems and all games developed with LithTech 3.x would eventually convert to the newer LithTech Jupiter or to Talon. The unreleased Monolith game Shogo II was being developed with this iteration of the LithTech engine. LithTech Discovery LithTech Discovery was created with the MMORPG genre and its unique requirements in mind. Discovery improved upon the working technology from LithTech 2.2, but also included the Distributed Object System which was the centerpiece of LithTech 3.x. The only game title to be powered by LithTech Discovery was The Matrix Online by Monolith. The engine was never licensed to any other company. LithTech Jupiter LithTech Jupiter was a thorough overhaul of the LithTech technology, developed as an alternative to 3.x. In some ways, the original version of Jupiter was even more technologically advanced than its competitors, since it supported Shader Model 1.x and included a visualization tool, whereas at the time Unreal and Quake only supported CPU-based shaders. A custom version of Jupiter was made especially for Monolith, for use with their Tron 2.0 game; this release was codenamed LithTech Triton. Eventually, LithTech Triton's new features were merged back into LithTech Jupiter for licensees. LithTech Jupiter EX As of 2005 the latest public iteration of the LithTech engine was Jupiter Extended (or Jupiter EX), which was featured in F.E.A.R. and Condemned: Criminal Origins, both developed by Monolith. Compared to its precursor Jupiter, the Extended version was driven by a new DirectX 9 renderer and other advancements, including the addition of Havok physics software for improved real-world physics simulation, dynamic per-pixel lighting, bump mapping, normal mapping, and specular highlighting. Along with Havok's character dynamics, Jupiter EX also includes the \\"Havok Vehicle Kit\\", which adds support for common vehicle behavior. LithTech Firebird Firebird was created with purpose of larger-scale battles and the expansion of the Nemesis system for Middle-earth: Shadow of War. Games using LithTech The following is a partial list of video games built with the LithTech engine, arranged by the version of LithTech used. 1.0 * Shogo: Mobile Armor Division by Monolith Productions (1998) * Blood II: The Chosen by Monolith Productions (1998) 1.5 * KISS: Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child by Third Law Interactive (2000) * Might and Magic IX by New World Computing (2002) This is also the version of the engine used in the development of the LithTech Film Producer machinima tool by Strange Company, most notably used in their short film \\"Ozymandius\\".

The ERP launched its guerrilla campaign against the Argentine military dictatorship headed by Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a in 1969, using targeted urban guerrilla warfare methods such as assassinations and kidnappings of government officials and foreign company executives. For example, in 1973 Enrique Gorriar√°n Merlo and Benito Urteaga led the ERP kidnapping of Esso executive Victor Samuelson and obtaining a ransom of $12 million. They also assaulted several companies' offices using heavily armed commandos of the ERP's elite \\"Special Squad\\". Although claim and counter-claim are invariably difficult to reconcile, figures released for an official publication, Cr√≥nica de la subversi√≥n en la Argentina (Buenos Aires: Ediciones Depalma) at least give an indication of the kind of guerrilla activity undertaken, with claims that the rural guerrillas occupied 52 towns, robbed 166 banks and took US $76 million in ransoms for the kidnappings of 185 people.Guerrillas and Generals: The \\"Dirty War\\" in Argentina, Paul H. Lewis, Page 52, Greenwood Publishing Group (2002) \\"Moyano classified her armed operations more carefully into arms thefts, attacks on property, takeovers (of towns buildings, broadcasting stations, or police and military posts), bombings, kidnappings, hijackings, and deaths (i.e., assassinations). She found that bombings ( 855 incidents), arms thefts (278) and takeovers (200) were the most frequent kinds of guerrilla action between 1969 and 1973.\\" The group continued the violent campaign even after democratic elections and the return to civilian rule in 1973, with Juan Peron's return. On June 20, 1973 the Peronist movement split after the Ezeiza massacre, that started when Lieutenant-Colonel Jorge Osinde's crowd monitoring right-wing Peronist militia reported the arrival of heavily armed Montoneros in two buses the day that Peron returned from exile.Guerrillas and Generals: The \\"Dirty War\\" in Argentina, Paul H. Lewis, Pages 88-89, Greenwood Publishing Group (2002) \\"Around midmorning they began to notice suspicious movements beyond the fields that flanked the airport highway. Men with different-colored armbands were positionining themselves behind the trees while others were climing up into them. Then, just before noon, a huge column of armed men, led by Governor Oscar Bidegain, appeared at the southern approach to the overpass, flanked by two Leyland buses and some ambulances. A few minutes later someone fired a shot, and the battle was on. It raged for the next three hours (...) One of the Leyland buses was blown up by a grenade. Later, it was found to be full of weapons, with supports in the windows for machine guns (...) Thrown back, the Montoneros began to scatter, pursued by Osinde's men. Some of those who were caught were shot or badly beaten. Most were hauled to the International Hotel at the Ezeiza Airport, where Osinde had set up an emergency interrogation center, and were beaten unmercifully until they revealed who had ordered the attack.\\" Victor E. Samuelson, an Exxon executive, was abducted on 6 December 1973 by the ERP. He was released after 144 days in captivity, after the Exxon Corporation paid a record ransom of $14.2 million.U.S. Executive Freed in Argentina; Guerrillas Got Record $14.2 Million. Los Angeles Times. (30/04/1974) The avowed aim of the ERP was a communist revolution against the Argentine government in pursuit of \\"proletarian rule.\\" The ERP publicly remained in the forefront. ERP guerrilla activity took the form of attacks on military outposts, police stations and convoys. In 1971, 57 policemen were killed fighting the left-wing guerrillas, and in 1972 another 38 policemen lost their lives in the guerrilla violence. On 28 December 1972, Marine Private Julio C√©sar Provenzano of the ERP, is killed when the bomb he planted in one of the lavatories of the Argentine Naval Headquarters went off prematurely. On 3 April 1973, ERP guerrillas kidnapped Rear-Admiral Francisco Agust√≠n Alem√°n. In January 1974 the ERP Compa√±√≠a H√©roes de Trelew, named in commemoration of the 1972 Massacre of Trelew, during which 16 left-wing guerrillas who had attempted to escape detention had been shot dead, attacked the barracks at Azul, killing the Commanding Officer (Colonel Camilo Arturo Gay) and his wife (Hilda Irma Casaux) and kidnapping and later executing Lieutenant-Colonel Jorge Ibarz√°bal, with Patricia Gay the daughter of Gay and Casaux later taking her own life. However, in August, an assault on the Argentine Army's Villa Maria explosives factory in Cordoba and the 17th Airborne Infantry Regiment at Catamarca by 70 ERP guerrillas dressed in army fatigues, met mixed fortune after killing and wounding eight policemen and soldiersAtaque a la Fabrica de Polvoras y Explosivos Villa Maria Cordoba but losing 16 guerrillas shot dead after they surrendered to 300 paratroopers of the 17th Airborne Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant-Colonel Eduardo Humberto Cubas. On 23 October 1974, ERP guerrillas shot and killed Lieutenant-Colonel Jos√© Francisco Gard√≥n as he was leaving the Buenos Aires hospital where he specialized in blood diseases. On 18 August 1975 Captain Miguel Alberto Keller, accompanied by an NCO and five conscripts were forced to stop their army lorry at what they believed to be a military checkpoint, and Keller was shot dead as he approached the ERP guerrillas waiting in ambush. In December 1975 a force of some 300 ERP guerrillas and supporting militants attacked the Monte Chingolo barracks outside Buenos Aires but lost 63 dead, many of whom were wounded in the attack and subsequently killed.Gustavo Plis-Sterenberg, Monte Chingolo. La mayor batalla de la guerrilla argentina In addition, seven army troops and three policemen were killed and 34 wounded (including 17 policemen). In all, 293 Argentine servicemen and police were killed fighting left-wing guerrillas between 1975 and 1976. In 1976 there had been plans to send a large part of the Uruguayan Tupamaros (MLN-T), the Chilean Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIR) and the Bolivian National Liberation Army (ELN) to fight alongside the ERP and Montoneros in Argentina, but the plans failed to materialize largely due to the military coup.  Operations in Tucum√°n and Buenos Aires  After the return of Juan Per√≥n to the presidency in 1973, the ERP shifted to a rural strategy designed to secure a large land area as a base of military operations against the Argentine state. The ERP leadership chose to send the Compania del Monte Ram√≥n Rosa Jimenez (Ram√≥n Rosa Jimenez Mountain Company) to the province of Tucum√°n at the edge of the long- impoverished Andean highlands in the northwest corner of Argentina. Many of the officers in the rural guerrilleros company were trained in Cuba.Enrique D√≠az-Araujo. La guerrilla en sus libros. p. 98. In July 2008, Cuban leader Fidel Castro admitted that he supported the guerrilla forces in South America: \\"The only place where we didn't attempt to promote a revolution was in Mexico. Everywhere else, without exception, we tried\\". Politician Gustavo Breide Obeid, who fought as an army captain against ERP guerrillas in Tucum√°n Province, claimed in 2007 that mercenaries from Jordan, Nicaragua and Angola served in the 'Ram√≥n Rosa Jimenez' Mountain Company. By December 1974, the guerrillas numbered about 100 fighters, with a 400-person support network from the Montoneros.Setentistas: De La Plata a la Casa Rosada, Fernando Amato, Christian Boyanovsky Baz√°n, Page 338, Editorial Sudamericana, (1 January 2008) \\"Luego fund√≥ la Unidad B√°sica de Combate Log√≠stica (UBCL) en la que el Hippte era el jefe. Con el tiempo logr√≥ contar con cerca de treinta combatientes, alrededor de doscientos militantes, y mayor n√∫mero de simpatizantes.\\" Led by Mario Roberto Santucho, they soon established control over a third of the province and organized a base of some 2,500 sympathizers. Santucho's armed guerrillas in the northwestern province of Tucuman never exceeded 300 in the first year of the campaign. The growth in ERP strength in the northwest, together with an increase in urban violence carried out by the left-Peronist Montoneros following Per√≥n's death in 1974, led the government of Isabel de Per√≥n to issue \\"annihilation decrees\\" and expand the military's powers to fight a counter-insurgency campaign in February 1975. In all, 83 servicemen and policemen were killed in fighting the left-wing guerrillas, between 1973 and 1974. Some 3,500 soldiers of the 5th Mountain Infantry Brigade, and two companies of elite commandos, placed under the command of Brigadier-General Acdel Vilas began immediately deploying in the Tucum√°n mountains in Operacion Independencia, joined later by 1,500 more troops from the 4th Airborne Infantry Brigade and 8th Mountain Infantry Brigade. The pattern of the war was largely dictated by the nature of the terrain, the mountains, rivers and extensive jungle denying both sides easy movement. The A-4B Skyhawk fighters and B.62 Canberra bombers of the Argentine Air Force were used for offensive air support while the North American T-34 and FMA IA 58 Pucar√° served as a light ground-attack and reconnaissance aircraft. While fighting the guerrilla in the jungle and mountains, Vilas concentrated on uprooting the ERP support network in the towns, using state terror tactics later adopted nationwide during the \\"Dirty War\\", as well as a civic action campaign. By July, the Argentine Army commandos were mounting search-and-destroy missions. The Army special forces discovered Santucho's base camp in August, then raided the ERP urban headquarters in September. Most of the Compania del Monte's headquarters staff was killed in October and the remainder dispersed by the end of the year. While most of the leaders of the movement were killed outright, many of the captured ERP subalterns and sympathizers were incarcerated during the government of Isabel Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n, but little mercy was shown to captured guerrillas and civilian collaborators during the military dictatorship. Monte Ram√≥n Rosa Jim√©nez Company Flag In May 1975, ERP representative Amilcar Santucho was captured trying to cross into Paraguay to promote the JCR unity effort. As a way to save himself, he provided information about the organization to Secretar√≠a de Inteligencia (SIDE) agents that enabled Argentine security agencies to destroy what was left of the ERP, although pockets of ERP guerrillas continued to operate in the heavily wooded Tucuman mountains for many months. The case, during which an FBI official transmitted information obtained from the prisoners (Amilcar was detained along with a MIR member) to the Chilean DINA, was one practical operation of Operation Condor, which had started in 1973Operation Condor , John Dinges (free access in French and in Portuguese ) Meanwhile, the guerrilla movement switched its main effort to the north and on 5 October 1975 guerrillas struck the 29th Mountain Infantry Regiment. The 5th Brigade suffered a major blow at the hands of Montoneros, when over one-hundred‚Äîperhaps several hundred‚ÄîMontoneros guerrillas and milicianos (militants) were involved in the planning and execution of the most elaborate Montoneros operation in the so-called \\"Dirty War\\", which involved the hijacking of a civilian airliner, taking over the provincial airport, attacking the 29th Infantry Regiment's barracks at Formosa province and capturing its cache of arms, and finally escaping by air. Once the operation was over, they made good their escape towards a remote area in Santa Fe province. The aircraft, a Boeing 737, eventually landed on a crop field not far from the city of Rafaela. In the aftermath, 12 soldiers and 2 policemen were killed and several wounded. The sophistication of the operation, and the getaway cars and safehouses they used to escape from the crash-landing site, suggest several hundred guerrillas and their civilian supporters were involved. In December 1975 most 5th Brigade units were committed to the border areas of Tucum√°n with over 5,000 troops deployed in the province. There was however, nothing to prevent infiltrating through this outer ring and the ERP were still strong inside Buenos Aires. Mario Santucho's Christmas offensive opened on 23 December 1975. The operation was dramatic in its impact, with ERP units, supported by Montoneros, mounting a large scale assault against the army supply base Domingo Viejobueno at the industrial suburb of Monte Chingolo, south of Buenos Aires. The attackers were defeated and driven off with 53 ERP guerrillas and 9 supporting militants killed.Monte Chingolo: Voces de Resistencia Seven army troops and three policemen were reported killed. In this particular battle the ERP and supporting Montoneros militants had about 1,000Review of the River Plate: A weekly journal dealing with commercial financial and economic affairs, 30 December 1975, p. 1021 deployed against 1,000 government forces. This large-scale operation was made possible not only by the planning of the guerrillas involved, but also by their supporters who provided houses to hide them, supplies and the means of escape. On 30 December a bomb exploded at the headquarters of the Argentine Army in Buenos Aires, injuring at least six soldiers. In the eyes of the military, the credibility of the government was now destroyed and the strategy of attrition was bankrupt. The guerrillas had even successfully utilized divers of the Grupo Especial de Combate of the Montoneros: the modern type 42 destroyer was severely damaged by explosives placed under her keel by frogmen of the Montoneros on 22 August 1975 while moored in the port of Ensenada. The damage was so great that the ship remained unseaworthy for several years. By the end of 1975, a total of 137 servicemen and police had been killed that year by left wing guerrillas. Elements within the armed forces, particularly among the junior officers, blamed the weakness of the government and began to seek a leader who they considered was strong enough to ensure a preservation of Argentinian sovereignty, settling on Lieutenant-General Jorge Videla. On 11 February 1976, colonel Ra√∫l Rafael Reyes, the commander of the 601st Air Defence Artillery Group, was killed and two army conscripts (Privates Tempone and G√≥mez) wounded in an ambush by six ERP guerrillas in the La Plata suburb of Buenos Aires. The Argentine armed forces moved ahead with the \\"Dirty War\\", dispensing with the civilian government through a coup d'√©tat in March 1976. In his editorial immediately after the military takeover, Santucho wrote that \\"a river of blood will separate the military from the Argentine people\\", and this would result in a popular uprising followed by a civil war.Political Violence and Trauma in Argentina, Antonius C. G. M. Robben, Page 201, University of Pennsylvania Press (January 25, 2005) On 29 March 1976, the ERP leadership lost twelve killed in a gun battle in downtown Buenos Aires with army elements (including the ERP Chief of Intelligence) but Santucho along with fifty guerrillas were able to fight their way out of the ambush. The Argentine Army and police scored more success in mid-April in C√≥rdoba, when in a series of raids it captured and later killed some 300 militants entrusted with supporting the ERP operations in that province. During the first few months of the military junta, more than 70 policemen were killed in leftist actions In mid-1976, the Argentine Army completely destroyed the ERP's elite \\"Special Squad\\" in two violent firefights. The ERP's commander, Mario Roberto Santucho, and Benito Urteaga were killed in July of that year by military forces led by captain Juan Carlos Leonetti of the 601st Intelligence Battalion. Several hundred guerrillas of the Guevarist Youth Group in training for operations to coincide with the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, were captured and killed in a series of raids in Z√°rate soon afterwards. Although the ERP continued for a while under the leadership of Enrique Gorriar√°n Merlo, by late 1977 the guerrilla threat had been eradicted or gone underground. In 2008, the PRT-ERP reported the loss of 5,000 of its members killed in action or having disappeared after being detained. By that time the military dictatorship had expanded its own campaign against \\"subversives\\" to include state terror against active civilian collaborators,Guerrillas and Generals: The \\"Dirty War\\" in Argentina, Paul H. Lewis, Page 47, Greenwood Publishing Group (2002) \\"Whether one accepts the higher or lower estimates, Argentina's guerrilla organizations, backed by multimillion dollar war chests, were formidable ‚Äî and lethal ( ...) Their collaborators reached into every level and every sector of society, and no one was safe from their vengeance.\\" non-violent students, intellectuals, and political activists who were presumed to form the social, non-combatant base of the insurgents. According to different sources, 12,261 to 30,000 people,The lower estimate is from the Asamblea por los Derechos Humanos (APDH). Estimates by human rights organizations estimate up to 30,000 are estimated to have disappeared and died during the military dictatorship that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. Admittedly there were 12,000 disappeared in the form of PEN detainees that survived the dictatorship,\\"Durante la vigencia del estado de sitio entre noviembre de 1974 y octubre de 1983, los organismos de derechos humanos denunciaron la existencia de 12 mil presos politicos legales en las distintas c√°rceles de 'maxima seguridad' a lo largo de todo el territorio de Argentina.\\"Entre resistentes e ‚Äúirrecuperables‚Äù: Memorias de ex presas y presos pol√≠ticos (1974-1983), p. 13. thanks to international pressure to release them from the clandestine detention camps. Some 11,000 Argentines have applied for and received up to US$200,000 each as monetary compensation for the loss of loved ones during the military dictatorship.State terrorism in Latin America: Chile, Argentina, and international human, Thomas C. Wright, Page 158, Rowman & Littlefield, 2007. The PRT continued political activities, although limited to few members, organizing conventions even after democracy returned to the country. In December 2015, Professor Gustavo Morello (SJ) in his new book The Catholic Church and Argentina's Dirty War (Oxford University Press, 2015) concluded that during the \\"Dirty War\\" in Argentina \\"15,000 people were killed, 8,000 were jailed and some 6,000 were exiled.\\"  Aftermath  After the destruction of the left-wing in Argentina, some revolutionary cadres made their way to Nicaragua, where the Sandinistas had taken power in 1979. An ERP commando team comprising veterans of the \\"Dirty War\\" under Gorriar√°n Merlo, for example, demonstrated their active involvement in the revolutionary struggle by killing ex-dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1980. Gorriar√°n returned to Argentina in 1987 to become a leader of the Movimiento Todos por la Patria (All For the Motherland Movement or MTP). Claiming another military coup by the Carapintadas was imminent against the new democratic government of Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n (which at the time was leading a series of trials against members of the Argentine Military accused of human rights violations), Enrique Gorriar√°n Merlo led the 1989 attack on La Tablada Regiment, during which the Argentine army used white phosphorus as an anti-personnel weapon,E/CN.4/2001/NGO/98, United Nations, January 12, 2001 - URL accessed on February 9, 2007 ANSA cable quoted by RaiNews24: Alcune testimonianze sull'uso militare del fosforo bianco .El Clar√≠n. El ataque a La Tablada, la √∫ltima aventura de la guerrilla argentina, January 23, 2004 and in which the guerrillas used captured army conscripts as 'shields' and ended in the capture of the surviving MTP members. Alfons√≠n countered the claim that the MTP were trying to forestall a military coup and declared that the attack had the ultimate goal of sparking a massive popular uprising, that could have led to civil war. In their newspapers and in the Argentine press, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo denounced the way Alfons√≠n had handled the La Tablada incident, making a connection between what had happened to their disappeared children and the treatment endured by the MTP guerrillas. Gorriar√°n was given a life sentence along with other MTP comrades, but was freed by interim president Eduardo Duhalde two days before N√©stor Kirchner's access to power in 2003. In protest to Duhalde's decision, former Lieutenant-Colonel Emilio Guillermo Nani who took part in the fighting to recover the La Tablada barracks and lost an eye as a consequence, formally announced that he would be returning the medal for wounded military personnel that he won during the administration of Argentine president Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n. The MTP still exist today as a political movement which has abandoned armed struggle. In January 2016 for the first time in decades, Mauricio Macri (the previous president of Argentina) through the new Human Rights Secretary Claudio Avruj, granted an audience to CELTYV (Centre for Legal Studies on Terrorism and its Victims) representing the victims of left-wing terrorism in Argentina in a move that drew strong condemnation from Estela Barnes de Carlotto, head of the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo.

It may darken, thicken, lengthen, and/or define the eyelashes. Normally in one of three forms‚Äîliquid, powder, or cream‚Äîthe modern mascara product has various formulas; however, most contain the same basic components of pigments, oils, waxes, and preservatives. The most common form of mascara is a liquid in a tube.  Definition  The Collins English Dictionary defines mascara as \\"a cosmetic substance for darkening, lengthening, curling, coloring, and thickening the eyelashes, applied with a brush or rod.\\" The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) adds that mascara is occasionally used on the eyebrows as well. The OED also references mascaro from works published in the late 15th century. In 1886, the Peck & Snyder Catalogue advertises, \\"Mascaro or Water Cosmetique... For darkening the eyebrow and moustaches without greasing them and making them prominent.\\" In 1890, the Century Dictionary defined mascara as \\"a kind of paint used for the eyebrows and eyelashes by actors.\\" And in 1894, N. Lynn advises in Lynn‚Äôs Practical Hints for Making-up, \\"to darken eyelashes, paint with mascara, or black paint, with a small brush.\\"  Etymology  The source of the word ‚Äúmascara‚Äù is unclear. The Spanish word m√°scara meaning ‚Äòmask‚Äô or ‚Äòstain‚Äô, and the Italian word maschera meaning ‚Äòmask‚Äô are possible origins. A related Catalan word describes soot or a black smear, and the Portuguese word m√°scara means ‚Äòmask‚Äô and mascarra means dark stain or smut). There is even strong support for a possible source from the Arabic word maskharah or ‚Äòbuffoon‚Äô. The Hebrew word ◊û◊©◊ß◊®◊ï◊™ (MaSQROTh) as relating to women's eyes is found in Isaiah 3:16.Adam Clarke, Commentary, 1831, volume III page 688 Latin treatises sometimes used the word mascara when referring to witches.  History  Mascara being applied. Aesthetic adornment is a cultural universal and mascara can be documented in ancient Egypt. Records from around 4000 BC refer to a substance called kohl that was used to darken eyelashes, eyelids, and eyebrows. Kohl was used to mask the eyes, believed to ward off evil spirits and protect the soul, by both men and women. Often composed of galena; malachite; and charcoal or soot, crocodile stool; honey; and water was added to keep the kohl from running. Through Egypt‚Äôs influence, kohl usage persisted in the subsequent Babylonian, Greek and Roman empires. Following the fall of the Roman Empire, kohl fell into disuse on the European continent, where it had been considered solely a cosmetic; conversely, it continued to be widely used in the Middle East for religious purposes. During the Victorian era, social opinion shifted radically towards the promotion of cosmetics, and women were known to spend a majority of their day occupied with beauty regimens. Great efforts were made to create the illusion of long, dark eyelashes. Attempting this, Victorian women made a type of mascara in their own homes. They would heat a mixture of ash or lampblack and elderberry juice on a plate and apply the heated mixture to their eyelashes. The product that people would recognize as mascara today did not develop until the 19th century. A chemist named Eug√®ne Rimmel developed a cosmetic using the newly invented petroleum jelly. The name Rimmel became synonymous with the substance and still translates to ‚Äúmascara‚Äù in the Portuguese, Spanish, Greek, Turkish, Romanian, and Persian languages today. Across the Atlantic Ocean and at roughly the same time, in 1915, Thomas Lyle Williams created a remarkably similar substance for his sister Mabel. In 1917 he started a mail-order business from the product that grew to become the company Maybelline. The mascara developed by these two men consisted of petroleum jelly and coal in a set ratio. It was undeniably messy, and a better alternative was soon developed. A dampened brush was rubbed against a cake containing soap and black dye in equal proportions and applied to the lashes. Still it was extremely messy. No significant improvement occurred until 1957 with an innovation by Helena Rubinstein. The events leading to Rubinstein‚Äôs improvement began in Paris in the early 20th century. There, at the fashion capital of the world, mascara was quickly gaining popularity and common usage. Elizabeth Arden and Helena Rubinstein, two giants in the American beauty industry, watched and kept abreast of its development. After the First World War, American consumers became eager for new products. Sensing an opportunity, both Rubinstein and Arden launched their own brands of cosmetics that included mascara. Through the efforts of these two rivals and public temperament, mascara finally gained respectability and favor in American society. The invention of the photograph and motion picture launched mascara‚Äôs popularity and usage further forward in America. Motion pictures especially advertised a new standard of beauty and sex appeal. Famous actresses of the classic cinema era, such as Theda Bara, Pola Negri, Clara Bow, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Bette Davis, and Jean Harlow, depended heavily upon mascara for their glamorized appearances, which the average woman sought to mimic. In 1933, a woman known on court records as Mrs. Brown consented to have her eyelashes permanently dyed. Unfortunately, the product, Lash Lure, used para-phenylenediamine, a chemical extremely toxic to the body, as the dyeing agent. At the time, cosmetics were unregulated by the Federal Drug Administration, and the dangers of paraphenylenediamine were unknown.National Research Council. \\"Safety Testing.\\" p. 21. Within hours of the treatment, Mrs. Brown began experiencing severe symptoms of stinging and burning eyes. By the next morning, Mrs. Brown‚Äôs eyes had developed ulcers which oozed and had swollen shut. Use of Lash Lure resulted in blindness in Mrs. Brown and fifteen other women and also caused the death of another through a bacterial infection. It was only after the Lash Lure incident and several others like it, documented in Ruth deForest Lamb‚Äôs book entitled American Chamber of Horrors, that Congress granted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the right to regulate cosmetics in 1938. Years later in 1957, Rubinstein created a formula that evolved mascara from a hard cake into a lotion-based cream. She packaged the new mascara in a tube to be sold with a brush. For use, the cream was squeezed onto the brush and applied to lashes. Although still messy, it was a step towards the modern mascara product. Soon, a grooved rod was patented. This device picked up the same amount of mascara for each use. Then the grooved rod was altered to the brush similar to the ones used today. The change in applicator led mascara to be even easier to use, and its popularity increased. Mascara is now trending towards multi- functional usage, with many mascaras including lash-boosting serums, botanicals, and pro-vitamin-enriched formulas. Korean technology is at the forefront of the development, and a number of brands use tubing formulas to coat the lash. Ingredients and manufacture All formulations contain pigments, oils, and waxes.  Cosmetic pigments  The pigmentation for black mascara is similar to that used by the Egyptians and Victorian women. Black and brown mascaras typically are colored by use of iron oxides.G√ºnther Schneider, Sven Gohla, J√∂rg Schreiber, Waltraud Kaden, Uwe Sch√∂nrock, Hartmut Schmidt-Lewerk√ºhne, Annegret Kuschel, Xenia Petsitis, Wolfgang Pape, water \\"Skin Cosmetics\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Some mascaras contain ultramarine blue. Mascara is composed of a base mixture of pigments, waxes, and oils with varying supporting components. Mascara pigments most commonly include iron oxides and titanium dioxide which provide mascara with its desired color. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) accounts for over 65% of inorganic pigments sales volume. TiO2 gives the pigment a white color while different iron oxides provide a variety of colors such as red, yellow, brown, and black. The particle size of opaque pigments ranges from 0.2-0.3 ¬µm. Oils, waxes, etc. Among the many oils used, linseed oil, castor oil, eucalyptus oil, lanolin, and oil of turpentine are found frequently. Sesame oil is also commonly used. Waxes usually found in mascara are paraffin wax, carnauba wax, and beeswax. The desired effects of the mascara account for most variations of ingredients. Water-resistant mascaras require hydrophobic ingredients, like dodecane. Non water-resistant mascaras have base ingredients that are water-soluble. Mascaras designed to lengthen or curl the eyelashes often contain nylon or rayon microfibers. Additionally, ceresin, gum tragacanth, and methyl cellulose are regular ingredients and serve as stiffeners.  Manufacture Mascara is often used on a daily basis around the world. In 2016 alone, U.S. consumers spent 335.6 million USD on the top 10 leading mascara brands. In one method of production, referred to as anhydrous, all waxes, oils, and pigments are mixed, heated, and agitated simultaneously. The alternative method, termed emulsion, starts by combining water and thickeners. Separately, waxes and emulsifiers are combined. Pigment is then added individually to both mixtures. Finally all is combined in a homogenizer, which acts as a high-speed agitator in order to thoroughly mix the oils, water, waxes, and emulsifiers‚Äîingredients that naturally repulse each other.

Mascara coated eyelashes. It is more common to develop a stye, or commoner still, swollen eyelids. Styes and swollen eyelids are better classified as allergic reactions. The allergic reactions can be stimulated by any of the components of mascara but is usually attributed to methylparaben, aluminum powder, ceteareth-20, butylparaben, or benzyl alcohol. If not cleaned properly, mascara can deposit itself under the conjunctiva in form of black lumps.

He is currently the Chairman of Mottola Media Group and previously the Chairman & CEO of Sony Music Entertainment, parent of the Columbia label, for nearly 15 years. He is married to the Mexican actress and singer Thal√≠a. They have an adopted half-Korean daughter named Cynthia Lee Hudson. Early life Mottola was born in The Bronx to a middle-class Italian-American family. He graduated from Iona Grammar School in 1962 and Iona Prep in 1966. He attended military school for a time, and then high school. After dropping out of Hofstra University on Long Island, he pursued a music career as a guitarist and singer with The Exotics, an R&B; cover band. Mottola is the cousin of Jazz guitarist Tony Mottola. Mottola entered in the music scene in the mid-1960s as a recording artist for CBS Records, under the name \\"T.D. Valentine\\". After his attempt to become a recording star himself failed, Mottola started working for publishing powerhouse Chappell Publishing and started his own management company, Champion Entertainment Organization. His role at Chappell put him in touch with many artists, and soon he signed his first successful management clients, Daryl Hall & John Oates. Mottola helped Hall and Oates land a record deal and several high-profile endorsements. He was also recognized for managing the black rock group Xavion successfully using new media for promotion, such as music videos and corporate sponsorship for music tours. Sony/Columbia In 1988, Mottola was hired by Sony Music (then known as CBS Records) by Walter Yetnikoff (who had been at the company from 1975 to 1990) to run its U.S. operations (it had recently been acquired by the Japan-based Sony corporation). In 1990, he replaced Yetnikoff as Chairman CEO of the newly named Sony Music. During his tenure, he transformed Sony into one of the most successful global music companies, expanding its businesses into over 60 countries, while creating one of the strongest management teams in the industry. He revitalized Sony Music's publishing division by making such acquisitions as the Beatles catalogue and enabled Sony to become the first major music company to make available commercial digital downloads. Additionally, Mottola was the architect for some of Sony's biggest global brands such as Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. During his 15-year tenure, Mottola built Sony up from a company with revenues of $800 million a year to one with over $6 billion of annual revenue by the year 2000. He is widely well-known for signing, developing and nurturing the careers of Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Gloria Estefan, R&B; group Destiny's Child, Jessica Simpson, Anastacia, Shakira, the Dixie Chicks, and for releasing digitally remastered compact discs of the older recordings made by Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Andy Williams, among others. He also is credited with creating the \\"Latin Explosion\\" in popular music by championing such Sony artists as Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony. He also worked with Michael Jackson from the time he began recording his Dangerous album. During the promotion of Jackson's album Invincible in 2001, Jackson would later state that his relationship with Mottola dissolved based on corruption in Mottola's working practices, and once charged him with being a \\"racist who exploited black talent\\". Jackson has stated later on that, \\"The recording companies really, really do conspire against the artists.\\" Al Sharpton told the New York Post shortly after that, ‚ÄúI have known Tommy for 15 or 20 years, and never once have I known him to say or do anything that would be considered racist\\". He admitted he was ‚Äútaken aback and surprised‚Äù by the verbal assault. ‚ÄúIn fact, he‚Äôs always been supportive of the black music industry,‚Äù Sharpton said. ‚ÄúHe was the first record executive to step up and offer to help us with respect to corporate accountability, when it comes to black music issues.‚Äù After Sony Mottola was the head of Sony Music Entertainment until January 2003. Since leaving his post as chief of Sony Music, Mottola has been building a new entertainment company, complete with recorded music, television production, theater, and fashion, alongside a branding and management company that had recently launched. He was instrumental in re-launching the various careers of such artists as Marc Anthony and Lindsay Lohan. Later signings included Cassie Ventura in 2006, and Mika who in 2007 had a number 1 single in the UK. Mottola bought out the rights to Casablanca Records (a then-diminished imprint of Polygram), and resurrected it, signing Lohan and Mika. Mottola published a book titled Hitmaker in January 2013, written with Cal Fussman. He details his successes and the drive that propelled him to the top of the business, but also talks at length about the down times. Mottola produced the recent musical adaptation of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale. Palminteri credits Mottola with the realization of the new project, developed over the past two years. Mottola brought the idea for A Bronx Tale musical to producer group Dodger Properties and \\"put the musical on his back\\". The show started previews at Paper Mill Playhouse on February 4, 2016, opened on February 14, 2016, and closed on March 6, 2016. The show officially opened on Broadway in December 2016 and after 29 previews and over 700 regular performances closed on August 5, 2018. A national tour will begin in October opening in Los Angeles at the Pantages Theatre. In 2018, Mottola's Mottola Media signed a multi year first look deal with eOne to develop scripted and unscripted TV. Personal life Mottola has been married three times. He converted to Judaism to marry his first wife, Lisa Clark, daughter of ABC Records head Sam Clark, in 1971. The couple divorced in 1990, after having two children, Michael and Sarah. On June 5, 1993, Mottola married his second wife, Mariah Carey. They announced their separation on May 30, 1997, and later divorced. He married his third wife, Thal√≠a, on December 2, 2000, at New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral. The article appears in English. NOTE: The U.S. edition of People gives the wedding date as October 11, 1997: The couple have two children, daughter Sabrina Saka√´ Mottola, born in October 2007, and son Matthew Alejandro Mottola, born in June 2011. In popular culture *Hall and Oates' song \\"Gino (The Manager)\\", from the duo's album Daryl Hall & John Oates (1975), was written about Mottola. The record jacket insert reads: \\"And introducing Tommy Mottola as 'Little Gino.' \\" *The character of Gene Balboa, in the Channel 101 Internet TV Series Yacht Rock, is loosely based on Mottola, in particular his time as Hall and Oates' manager. *Mariah Carey wrote a song called Petals on her album Rainbow (1999), which addresses her marriage with Mottola.

It has been used as a higher rank than strain, with several strains making up one race. Therefore, a strain (within the honey bee context) is a lower-level taxonomic rank used at the intraspecific level within a race of a subspecies. Strains are often seen as inherently artificial concepts, more usually within biology as characterized by a specific intent for genetic isolation, however, within beekeeping circles, strain is more likely to be used to describe very minor differences throughout the same subspecies, such as the color ranges of A. m. carnica from brown to grey. Within A. m. ligustica there are two races, the darker leather brown northern Italian bee from the Ligurian Alps region which was discovered to be resistant to acarine in the 1900s, while the other Italian bee race, from regions near Bologna and further south, was highly susceptible to acarine and within this race there are two color strains, the traditional Italian yellow and a rarer all-golden color.  Description  The races of the honey bee are classified into various named instances of an informal taxonomic rank of race‚Äîbelow that of subspecies‚Äîon the basis of shared genetic traits. The term \\"honey bee\\" means a bee of the species Apis mellifera which descend from bees that originated in Africa. Differences in the colors of bees may be more pronounced in queens and drones; workers are much less easily differentiated by color. Drones are produced from the unfertilized eggs of queens and therefore their genetic characteristics depend entirely on those of the queen, whereas worker bees are produced from fertilized eggs. To make things even more complicated, a queen will normally mate multiple times, the spermatozoa from which are retained within her body, meaning that workers may only be half-sisters to each other, and their colors and other characteristics may differ. In the Americas, there has been a great deal of interbreeding of subspecies, since all honey bees were imported at some point after 1492 and the subsequent Columbian Exchange. Among beekeepers, the term race has been used increasingly imprecisely, and is often used to refer to bee subspecies and hybrids, as well as subspecies divisions, more improperly. There are also variations within subspecies (like within A. m. mellifera), being little more than color variants that may not be correlated with distinct distributions; these are sometimes referred to as native races. These are often given their own names when described, but zoological nomenclature does not recognize these named \\"races\\" as valid, as only ranks of subspecies and above have formal scientific names in zoology.  Classifications  Based on morphological similarities and the separation of regions during and since the last Ice Age, there are five bee lineages:Gene flow within the M evolutionary lineage of Apis mellifera: role of the Pyrenees, isolation by distance and post-glacial re-colonization routes in western Europe.

The entire structure above the level of the pillar bases is a later reconstruction. Thermae Maiores, Aquincum, Budapest The mosaics of the thermal baths The thermal baths from inside In ancient Rome, thermae (from Greek Œ∏ŒµœÅŒºœåœÇ thermos, \\"hot\\") and balneae (from Greek Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒΩŒµ·øñŒøŒΩ balaneion) were facilities for bathing. Thermae usually refers to the large imperial bath complexes, while balneae were smaller-scale facilities, public or private, that existed in great numbers throughout Rome. Most Roman cities had at least one ‚Äì if not many ‚Äì such buildings, which were centres not only for bathing, but socializing and reading as well. Bath-houses were also provided for wealthy private villas, town houses, and for forts. They were supplied with water from an adjacent river or stream, or within cities by aqueduct. The water would be heated by fire then channelled into the caldarium (hot bathing room). The design of baths is discussed by Vitruvius in De architectura (V.10). Terminology Mosaic bath sign from Sabratha, Libya, showing bathing sandals, three strigils, and the slogan SALVOM LAVISSE, \\"A bath is good for you\\"More literally, \\"It is a healthful thing to have bathed.\\" Thermae, balneae, balineae, balneum and balineum may all be translated as \\"bath\\" or \\"baths\\", though Latin sources distinguish among these terms. Balneum or balineum, derived from the Greek .Varro, De Ling. Lat. ix. 68, ed. M√ºller (cited by Rich, 183) signifies, in its primary sense, a bath or bathing- vessel, such as most persons of any consequence among the Romans possessed in their own houses,Cicero, Ad Atticum ii. 3. and hence the chamber which contained the bath,Cicero, Ad Fam. xiv. 20 (cited by Rich, 183). which is also the proper translation of the word balnearium. The diminutive balneolum is adopted by SenecaEp. 86 (cited by Rich, 183) to designate the bathroom of Scipio in the villa at Liternum, and is expressly used to characterize the modesty of republican manners as compared with the luxury of his own times. But when the baths of private individuals became more sumptuous and comprised many rooms, instead of the one small chamber described by Seneca, the plural balnea or balinea was adopted, which still, in correct language, had reference only to the baths of private persons. Thus, Cicero terms the baths at the villa of his brother QuintusAd Q. Frat. iii. 1. ¬ß 1 (cited by Rich, 183) balnearia. Balneae and balineae, which according to VarroDe Ling. Lat. viii. 25, ix. 41, ed. M√ºller (cited by Rich, 183) have no singular number, were the public baths, but this accuracy of diction is neglected by many of the subsequent writers, and particularly by the poets, amongst whom balnea is not uncommonly used in the plural number to signify the public baths, since the word balneae could not be introduced in a hexameter verse. Pliny also, in the same sentence, makes use of the neuter plural balnea for public, and of balneum for a private bath.Ep. ii. 17. (cited by Rich, 184) Thermae (Greek: , Thermai, \\"hot springs, hot baths\\",. from the Greek adjective thermos, \\"hot\\") meant properly warm springs, or baths of warm water; but came to be applied to those magnificent edifices which grew up under the empire, in place of the simple balneae of the republic, and which comprised within their range of buildings all the appurtenances belonging to the Greek gymnasia, as well as a regular establishment appropriated for bathing.Juv. Sat. vii. 233 (cited by Rich, 184) Writers, however, use these terms without distinction. Thus the baths erected by Claudius Etruscus, the freedman of the Emperor Claudius, are styled by StatiusSylv. i. 5. 13 (cited by Rich, 184) balnea, and by Martialvi. 42 (cited by Rich, 184) Etrusci thermulae. In an epigram by Martialix. 76 (cited by Rich, 184)‚Äîsubice balneum thermis‚Äîthe terms are not applied to the whole building, but to two different chambers in the same edifice. Building layout Plan of the Old Baths at Pompeii A public bath was built around three principal rooms: the tepidarium (warm room), the caldarium (hot room), and the frigidarium (cold room). Some thermae also featured steam baths: the sudatorium, a moist steam bath, and the laconicum, a dry hot room much like a modern sauna. By way of illustration, this article will describe the layout of Pompeii's Old Baths adjoining the forum, which are among the best-preserved Roman baths. The references are to the floor plan pictured to the right.The following is adapted from the 1898 Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities entry edited by Harry Thurston Peck. The whole building comprises a double set of baths, one for men, one for women. It has six different entrances from the street, one of which (b) gives admission to the smaller women's set only. Five other entrances lead to the men's department, of which two (c and c2), communicate directly with the furnaces, and the other three (a3, a2, a) with the bathing apartments. Atrium Passing through the principal entrance, a (barely visible, right side, one third of the total length from above), which is removed from the street by a narrow footway surrounding the building and after descending three steps, the bather would find a small chamber on his left (x) with a toilet (latrina), and proceed into a covered portico (g, g), which ran round three sides of an open court (atrium, A). These together formed the vestibule of the baths (vestibulum balnearum),Pro Cael. 26 (cited by Peck) in which the servants waited. =Use of the atrium= This atrium was the exercise ground for the young men, or perhaps served as a promenade for visitors to the baths. Within this court the keeper of the baths (balneator), who exacted the quadrans paid by each visitor, was also stationed. The room f, which runs back from the portico, might have been appropriated to him; but most probably it was an oecus or exedra, for the convenience of the better classes while awaiting the return of their acquaintances from the interior. In this court, advertisements for the theatre, or other announcements of general interest, were posted up, one of which, announcing a gladiatorial show, still remains. At the sides of the entrance were seats (scholae). The 1898 edition of Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities provided illustrations envisioning the rooms of the Old Baths at Pompeii: File:Apodyterium of the Old Baths at Pompeii by Overbeck.pngApodyterium File:Tepidarium of the Old Baths at Pompeii by Overbeck.pngTepidarium File:Caldarium of the Old Baths at Pompeii by Overbeck.pngCaldarium File:Frigidarium of the Old Baths at Pompeii by Overbeck.pngFrigidarium Apodyterium and frigidarium A passage (c) leads into the apodyterium (B), a room for undressing in which all visitors must have met before entering the baths proper. Here, the bathers removed their clothing, which was taken in charge by slaves known as capsarii, notorious in ancient times for their dishonesty.Dig. xlvii. 17 (cited by Peck) The apodyterium was a spacious chamber, with stone seats along three sides of the wall (h). Holes are still visible on the walls, and probably mark the places where the pegs for the bathers' clothes were set. The chamber was lighted by a glass window, and had six doors. One of these led to the tepidarium (D) and another to the frigidarium (C), with its cold plunge-bath referred to as baptisterium (more commonly called natatorium or piscina), loutron, natatio, or puteus; the terms natatio and natatorium suggest that some of those baths were also swimming pools. The bath in this chamber is of white marble, surrounded by two marble steps. Tepidarium Pompeian interior, The Thermae by Forum by Joseph Theodor Hansen (1848‚Äì1912) From the apodyterium the bather who wished to go through the warm bath and sweating process entered the tepidarium (D). It did not contain water neither at Pompeii nor at the Baths of Hippias, but was merely heated with warm air of an agreeable temperature, in order to prepare the body for the great heat of the vapour and warm baths, and, upon returning, to prevent a too-sudden transition to the open air. In the baths at Pompeii this chamber also served as an apodyterium for those who took the warm bath. The walls feature a number of separate compartments or recesses for receiving the garments when taken off. The compartments are divided from each other by figures of the kind called atlantes or telamones, which project from the walls and support a rich cornice above them in a wide arch. Three bronze benches were also found in the room, which was heated as well by its contiguity to the hypocaust of the adjoining chamber, as by a brazier of bronze (foculus), in which the charcoal ashes were still remaining when the excavation was made. Sitting and perspiring beside such a brazier was called ad flammam sudare.Suet. Aug. 82 (cited by Peck) The tepidarium is generally the most highly ornamented room in baths. It was merely a room to sit and be anointed in. In the Forum Baths at Pompeii the floor is mosaic, the arched ceiling adorned with stucco and painting on a coloured ground, the walls red. Anointing was performed by slaves called unctores and aliptae. It sometimes took place before going to the hot bath, and sometimes after the cold bath, before putting on the clothes, in order to check the perspiration.Galen. x. 49 (cited by Peck) Some baths had a special room (destrictarium or unctorium) for this purpose. Caldarium From the tepidarium a door opened into the caldarium (E), whose mosaic floor was directly above the furnace or hypocaust. Its walls also were hollow, behind the decorated plaster one part of the wall was made from interconnected hollow bricks called tubuli lateraci, forming a great flue filled with heated air. At one end was a round basin (labrum), and at the other a quadrangular bathing place (puelos, alveus, solium, calida piscina), approached from the platform by steps. The labrum held cold water, for pouring upon the bather's head before he left the room. These basins are of marble in the Old Baths, but we hear of alvei of solid silver.Plin. H. N.xxxiii. 152 (cited by Peck) Because of the great heat of the room, the caldarium was but slightly ornamented. Laconicum The Old Baths have no laconicum, which was a chamber still hotter than the caldarium, and used simply as a sweating-room, having no bath. It was said to have been introduced at Rome by AgrippaDio Cass. liii. 27 (cited by Peck) and was also called sudatorium and assa. Service areas A three-tiered water boiler (miliarium) The apodyterium has a passage (q) communicating with the mouth of the furnace (i), called praefurnium or propigneum and, passing down that passage, we reach the chamber M, into which the praefurnium projects, and which is entered from the street at c. It was assigned to the fornacatores, or persons in charge of the fires. Of its two staircases, one leads to the roof of the baths, and one to the boilers containing the water. There were three boilers, one of which (caldarium) held the hot water; a second, the tepid (tepidarium); and the third, the cold (frigidarium). The warm water was filled into the warm bath by a pipe through the wall, marked on the plan. Underneath the hot chamber was set the circular furnace d, of more than 7 ft. in diameter, which heated the water and poured hot air into the hollow cells of the hypocaustum. It passed from the furnace under the first and last of the caldrons by two flues, which are marked on the plan. The boiler containing hot water was placed immediately over the furnace; as the water was drawn out from there, it was supplied from the next, the tepidarium, which was raised a little higher and stood a little way off from the furnace. It was already considerably heated from its contiguity to the furnace and the hypocaust below it, so that it supplied the deficiency of the former without materially diminishing its temperature; and the vacuum in this last was again filled up from the farthest removed, which contained the cold water received directly from the square reservoir seen behind them. The boilers themselves no longer remain, but the impressions which they have left in the mortar in which they were embedded are clearly visible, and enable us to determine their respective positions and dimensions. Such coppers or boilers appear to have been called miliaria, from their similarity of shape to a milestone.Pallad. i. 40; v. 8 (cited by Peck) Behind the boilers, another corridor leads into the court or atrium (K), appropriated to the servants of the bath. Women's bath The adjoining, smaller set of baths were assigned to the women. The entrance is by the door b, which conducts into a small vestibule (m) and from there into the apodyterium (H), which, like the one in the men's bath, has a seat (pulvinus, gradus) on either side built up against the wall. This opens upon a cold bath (J), answering to the natatio of the men's set, but of much smaller dimensions. There are four steps on the inside to descend into it. Opposite to the door of entrance into the apodyterium is another doorway which leads to the tepidarium (G), which also communicates with the thermal chamber (F), on one side of which is a warm bath in a square recess, and at the farther extremity the labrum. The floor of this chamber is suspended, and its walls perforated for flues, like the corresponding one in the men's baths. The tepidarium in the women's baths had no brazier, but it had a hanging or suspended floor. Purpose Ruins of the enormous Baths of Caracalla, completed in 216 on a 25 hectare (33 acre) site The baths often included, aside from the three main rooms listed above, a palaestra, or outdoor gymnasium where men would engage in various ball games and exercises. There, among other things, weights were lifted and the discus thrown. Men would oil themselves (as soap was still a luxury good and thus not widely available), shower, and remove the excess with a strigil (cf. the well known Apoxyomenus of Lysippus from the Vatican Museum). Often wealthy bathers would bring a capsarius, a slave that carried his master's towels, oils, and strigils to the baths and then watched over them once in the baths, as thieves and pickpockets were known to frequent the baths. The changing room was known as the apodyterium (from Greek apodyterion from apoduein \\"to take off\\"). Cultural significance In many ways, baths were the ancient Roman equivalent of community centres. Because the bathing process took so long, conversation was necessary. Many Romans would use the baths as a place to invite their friends to dinner parties, and many politicians would go to the baths to convince fellow Romans to join their causes. The thermae had many attributes in addition to the baths. There were libraries, rooms for poetry readings, and places to buy and eat food. The modern equivalent would be a combination of a library, art gallery, mall, restaurant, gym, and spa. One important function of the baths in Roman society was their role as what we would consider a ‚Äúbranch library‚Äù today. Many in the general public did not have access to the grand libraries in Rome and so as a cultural institution the baths served as an important resource where the more common citizen could enjoy the luxury of books. The Baths of Trajan, of Caracalla, and Diocletian all contained rooms determined to be libraries. They have been identified through the architecture of the baths themselves. The presence of niches in the walls are assumed to have been bookcases and have been shown to be sufficiently deep to have contained ancient scrolls. There is little documentation from the writers of the time that there did exist definitive public libraries maintained in the baths, but records have been found that indicated a slave from the imperial household was labelled vilicus thermarum bybliothecae Graecae (\\"maintenance man of the Greek library of the baths\\"). However, this may only indicate that the same slave held two positions in succession: \\"maintenance man of the baths\\" (vilicus thermarum) and \\"employee in the Greek library\\" (a bybliothecae Graecae). The reason for this debate is that, although Julius Caesar and Asinius Pollio advocated for public access to books and that libraries be open to all readers, there is little evidence that public libraries existed in the modern sense as we know it. It is more likely that these reserves were maintained for the wealthy elite. Roman thermal baths, Aeclanum, Mirabella Eclano Baths were a site for important sculpture; among the well-known pieces recovered from the Baths of Caracalla are the Farnese Bull and Farnese Hercules and over life-size early 3rd century patriotic figures somewhat reminiscent of Soviet Socialist realism works (now in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples). The Romans believed that good health came from bathing, eating, massages, and exercise. The baths, therefore, had all of these things in abundance. Since some citizens would be bathing multiple times a week, Roman society was surprisingly clean.Andrews, Cath. ‚ÄúAncient Roman Baths: Cleanliness and Godliness under one roof.‚Äù Explore Italian Culture. Web. 4/22/12. When asked by a foreigner why he bathed once a day, a Roman emperor is said to have replied \\"Because I do not have the time to bathe twice a day.\\" Emperors often built baths to gain favour for themselves and to create a lasting monument of their generosity. If a rich Roman wished to gain the favour of the people, he might arrange for a free admission day in his name. For example, a senator hoping to become a Tribune might pay all admission fees at a particular bath on his birthday to become well known to the people of the area. Location laser scan technology Baths sprang up all over the empire. Where natural hot springs existed (as in Bath, England; BƒÉile Herculane, Romania or Aquae Calidae near Burgas and Serdica, Bulgaria) thermae were built around them. Alternatively, a system of hypocausta (from hypo \\"below\\" and kaio \\"to burn\\") were utilised to heat the piped water from a furnace (praefurnium). Remains of Roman public baths A number of Roman public baths survive, either as ruins or in varying degrees of conservation. Among the more notable are the Roman baths of Bath and the Ravenglass Roman Bath House in England as well as the Baths of Caracalla, of Diocletian, of Titus, of Trajan in Rome and the baths of Sofia, Serdica and Varna.http://www.ancient-bulgaria.com/2008/05/09/the-roman-thermae-in-varna/ Probably the most complete are various public and private baths in Pompeii and nearby sites.

Port Eliot comprises a stately home with its own church, which serves as the parish church of St Germans. An earlier church building was Cornwall's principal cathedral. The house is within an estate of which extends into the neighbouring villages of Tideford, Trerulefoot and Polbathic. Both house and garden are Grade I listed. The main entrance to Port Eliot History The main Gate Lodge Originally built as a priory with adjoining St Germans Priory Church, parts of the house date back to the 12th century. It was substantially altered and remodelled in the 17th and 18th centuries by noted architects including Sir John Soane. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Eliot family invested substantially in the estate, building numerous farmhouses, fishermen's cottages and other dwellings across the land. Many of these remain part of the estate to this day and are rented out to local residents and friends of the family. Some properties, mainly lying remote from the estate, have been sold in recent years. In 2014, the 700-hectare estate was purchased by the Duchy of Cornwall. Festivals=Elephant Fayre In 1980 a small festival which had outgrown its site at Polgooth in mid-Cornwall approached the Port Eliot estate and asked if it could be held in the idyllic grounds. The estate office agreed a price, and there began the Elephant Fayre, one of the most eclectic festivals of the 1980s. The festival ran from 1981‚Äì1986, beginning with some 1,500 visitors over four days, and featured a mix of music, theatre and visual arts. Over the years the festival grew, attracting crowds of up to 30,000 and bands such as The Cure, The Fall and Siouxsie and the Banshees. The burning down of the oldest tree in the park, looting of the village surgery and the robbing of stall-holders in 1985 prompted Lord Eliot and fellow organisers to make the 1986 festival the last. Port Eliot Festival In 2003 Lord St Germans began the Port Eliot Lit Fest. Public access In March 2008 the house and grounds opened to the public for the first time, for 100 days, and attracted 12,000 visitors. Following extensive water damage to parts of the building, renovation work means the house and gardens will not be fully open during 2020. although some areas of the gardens will still be accessible during public ticketed events and there may be limited access to some areas of the house.

They were in operation until the 530s and then fell into disuse and ruin. However, they have served as an inspiration for many other notable buildings, including the Baths of Diocletian, Basilica of Maxentius, the original Pennsylvania Station (New York) and Chicago Union Station. Art works recovered from the ruins include famous sculptures such as the Farnese Bull and the Farnese Hercules. Today the Baths of Caracalla are a tourist attraction.  History = Construction ‚Äì 216‚Äì235  Construction of the baths was probably initiated by emperor Septimius Severus and completed during the reign of his son, Caracalla. They were inaugurated in AD 216. The baths were located in the southern area of the city, Regio XII, where members of the Severan family commissioned other construction works: the via nova leading to the baths and the Septizodium on nearby Palatine Hill. The site chosen for the baths formerly belonged to a vast garden estate known as the horti Asiniani, developed by Gaius Asinius Pollio during the reign of Augustus. The Farnese Bull sculptural group which was later moved into the Baths of Caracalla was already present at the site in the time of Pollio, who imported it to display in his gardens. The estate of Pollio was appropriated by Caracalla to build his baths and the existing structures were demolished down to their ground floors, filled in with earth and incorporated into the foundations of the new bath complex. The remains of one of these structures, a noble domus (house), were excavated by Francesco Ficoroni in the mid 18th century, and again in 1860-67 by G.B. Guidi. For work to have been mostly completed in the time of Caracalla, workers would have had to install over of material every day for six years in order to complete it between 211 (when Severus died) and 216. Work on additional decorations continued under Caracalla's successors Elagabalus and Severus Alexander. The baths were likely mostly finished by 235. Later renovations were conducted under Aurelian (after a fire) and by Diocletian. Under Constantine the Great the caldarium was modified. The building was heated by a hypocaust, a system of burning coal and wood underneath the ground to heat water provided by a dedicated aqueduct. The baths were free and open to the public. Late antiquity The baths were fully functional in the 5th century when they were referred to as one of the seven wonders of Rome. Olympiodorus of Thebes mentions a capacity of 1,600. This is interpreted to refer to the maximum number of simultaneous visitors, as the daily capacity is thought to have been 6,000 to 8,000 bathers. The baths remained in use until the 6th century. From the mid 4th century a Christian pilgrimage site came into being, known as the titulus Fasciolae, close to the baths near the Church of Santi Nereo e Achilleo. The baths thus became useful to pilgrims and the religious community for their water supply. In 537 during the Gothic War, Vitiges of the Ostrogoths laid siege to Rome and severed the city's water supply. Shortly thereafter the baths were abandoned. Located too far away from the still populated area of Rome, the baths were mostly disused but in the 6th and 7th centuries were apparently used for the burials of pilgrims who died after being cared for in the nearby Xenodochium of Santi Nereo ed Achilleo. Some simple tombs from this era have been found inside the bath area. Popes Adrian I, Sergius II and Nicholas I may have had some work done on the aqueduct through the 9th century. The earthquake of 847 destroyed much of the building, along with many other Roman structures.DeLaine, Janet (1997), The Baths of Caracalla: A study in the design, construction, and economics of large-scale building projects in Imperial Rome, (1st ed.), London: JRA, p. 169.  12th century ‚Äì 19th century ‚Äì other uses  At least since the 12th century the baths were used as a quarry for construction materials, and of decorative pieces to be reused in churches and palaces ( e.g. in Pisa Cathedral and Santa Maria in Trastevere). During the 14th century, the area was used as vineyards and gardens. In 1524, Pope Clement VII granted an excavation license to Cardinal Lorenzo Pucci to remove unlimited quantities of columns, marble, travertine and other ancient stone from the Baths of Caracalla for a new palace the Cardinal was building near St. Peter's Basilica. In the mid-16th century Clement's successor Pope Paul III had excavations conducted in the area during the construction of his new villa. Substantial architectural decoration remained standing at this time, as documented in the drawings of the Renaissance architects Andrea Palladio, Giovanni Antonio Dosio and Antonio da Sangallo the Elder. The excavations of Paul III between 1545-47 uncovered many large statues, made of marble and bronze, as well as innumerable architectural fragments, lamps, intaglios, and cameos. The quantity of materials was so great that a museum was created to house the collection, known as the Museo Farnese (relocated to the Museo Borbonico in the late 18th century). The pope granted the area to the Roman Seminary of the Jesuits. It was used as a playground for children. Philip Neri may have brought children from his oratory here ‚Äì he is believed to have commissioned the fresco Madonna supported by an angel still located in the natatio. Between the 16th and 18th century interest in the structure was rekindled and several famous architects made drawings of the ruins (Andrea Palladio, Giovanni Battista Falda, Giambattista Nolli and Giuliano da Sangallo). The aqueduct serving the baths was in use up to the 19th century. The Aqua Antoniniana aqueduct, a branch of the earlier Aqua Marcia also worked on under Diocletian, was specifically built to serve the baths.  Modern times ‚Äì excavation and restoration  In 1824, excavations at the baths were conducted by Count Egidio di Velo, whose findings included the mosaics showing athletes now at the Vatican Museums. Further work followed by Luigi Canina in the frigidarium (until the mid-19th century) and then by Battista Guidi (1860‚Äì7). From 1866 to 1869 restoration work in the central part of the complex revealed a torso of Hercules, porphyry columns and figure-adorned capitals. In 1870 the area became the property of the Italian government and Pietro Rosa conducted excavations in the eastern palaestra. In 1878/9, Giuseppe Fiorelli discovered mosaics in the caldarium and western palaestra. From the early 20th century, excavations expanded into the outer areas of the complex and downward, revealing the subterranean passages, including a mithraeum (see below). Systematic work on the galleries, started in the 18th and 19th centuries, resumed after 1901. On the eastern side more work was done in the late 1930s, when an opera stage was installed in the caldarium. Except for some sketches no documentation of these restorations survives. Further restoration work took place in the 1980s, when thick vegetation and illegally built houses in the area were cleared away. The southern wall with its cisterns, the southwestern library and the octagonal hall known as the Temple of Jupiter were restored at that point. In 1998-9, the opera stage was dismantled and modern visitor facilities were added to the baths. They reopened to the public in 2001. The baths were the only archaeological site in Rome to be damaged by an earthquake near L'Aquila in 2009. They were again damaged, though minor, in August 2016 by an earthquake in central Italy. Description= Overview  Part of the internal section The bath complex covered approximately . The complex is rectangular, measuring 337 by 328 meters. Its construction involved the moving of a substantial amount of earth, as parts of the nearby hills had to be removed or leveled into platforms. Several million bricks were used in the construction. The baths contained at least 252 columns, 16 of which had a height of over 12 meters. Water was carried to the baths by the then newly constructed acqua nova Antoniniana from the major acqua Marcia. The exact path of the aqueduct supplying the baths is not known as only a few segments have been discovered. The aqueduct connected to the southern side of the baths where it filled 18 cisterns. These in turn were connected by lead pipes with the baths proper. The baths followed the \\"great Imperial baths\\" blueprint for Roman baths. They were more a leisure centre than just a series of baths. Besides being used for bathing, the complex also offered facilities for taking walks, reading/studying, exercise and body care. The main building stood in the centre with no connections to the surrounding walls, which housed the cisterns, two symmetrical libraries (south), two large exedras (east and west) and tabernae (shops) to the north. The surviving library measures 38 by 22 meters. Between the outer wall and the central complex were gardens (xystus). The axis of the baths was laid out in a northeast to southwest fashion to make use of the sun's heat. The caldarium faced southwest, the frigidarium northeast. Overall, the bath area was arranged along a single linear axis. However, dressing rooms and palaestra were arranged symmetrically on both sides of the building, giving easier access and facilitating the flow of people in and out of the thermal area, thus increasing the number of potential users of the baths. The bath main building was 214 x 110 meters and the height to the top of the roof line was 44 meters (145 ft); it covered and could hold an estimated 1,600 bathers.  Interior  The Baths of Caracalla (reconstructive drawing from 1899) The \\"baths\\" were the second to have a public library within the complex. Like other public libraries in Rome, there were two separate and equal sized rooms or buildings; one for Greek language texts and one for Latin language texts.DeLaine,(1997), The baths of Caracalla,(1st ed.), London: JRA. p. 191. The surviving library had three walls covered by niches (a total of 32) that housed the books. A larger niche in the middle of the southern wall likely contained a statue. A masonry ledge in front of the three other walls probably served as a bench. The floor is made from marble. The baths consisted of a central frigidarium (cold room) measuring under three groin vaults high, a double pool tepidarium (medium), and a circular caldarium (hot room) in diameter, as well as two palaestras (gyms where wrestling and boxing were practiced). The northeastern end of the bath building contained a natatio or swimming pool. The caldarium had seven pools, the frigidarium four, the tepidarium two. Next to the caldarium were saunas (laconica). The central room was the frigidarium, whose high roof was supported by eight giant columns made from Egyptian granite. Walls and floor were made from marble. The hall served a dual purpose: It was a meeting place and transition area for visitors heading for other parts of the bath. It also housed the cold baths, in the form of four pools, two of which were connected to the tepidarium and two of which communicated with the natatio via some waterfalls. In the middle of the frigidarium was another circular pool (now at the Archaeological Museum at Naples) surrounding a fountain. It was flanked by two additional brick pools. The caldarium was a circular room with marble floors and topped by a dome of almost 36 meters diameter, close to the size of the Pantheon's dome. The weight of the dome was carried by just eight masonry pillars. Between them were glass windows that helped heat the large room (and reduced the weight of the walls). Its seven pools measured 9.5 m by 5 m (depth of 1 m). Only six of these remain. The seventh was replaced by a small apse during the restoration by Constantine. The Olympic-sized natatio pool measured 50 m by 22 m. The walls rose to more than 20 m and the northern fa√ßade was structured by three huge columns made from grey granite. Between those columns were niches on several levels which housed ornamental statues. The natatio was roofless with bronze mirrors mounted overhead to direct sunlight into the pool area. The entire bath building was on a raised platform high to allow for storage and furnaces under the building. Subterranean features Tunnel with skylight Discovered in 1912 by Ettore Ghislanzoni, the mithraeum at the baths is considered the largest documented gathering space for the worshippers of Mithra, the Persian god in vogue with the military and mostly lower class men, in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. The mithraeum was approximately long and wide with a cross-vaulted ceiling. It can be only roughly dated by the two main events associated with the baths: the mithraeum was created after the complex was completed circa AD 217 and it was probably no longer in use when the aqueduct supplying the complex was cut in the 530s. The floor of the main room was covered with a black and white mosaic. Benches lined the walls. A fresco portraying Mithra (or a torch bearer) is on the western wall. The only other ornamentation was a marble block, roughly carved into the shape of a snake. In the floor near the entrance a circular pit was found covered with a marble slab, with a terracotta bowl containing the remains of staves of wheat. A rectangular hole in the floor gives access to a small tunnel that runs under the center of the main hall into an adjoining room, where there is an entrance/exit with staircase. This, a unique feature in a mithraeum, has been controversial. Most scholars view this as a fossa sanguinis, a ritual pit over which the bull at the center of the Mithraic mythology was slaughtered, bathing one or more initiates in its blood. Others think it was used as a sort of stage trap door allowing a person to stage a surprising entry into the room. In a nearby room, a statue of Aphrodite Anadyomene was found in 1912. It is now located in the Museo Nazionale Romano at the Baths of Diocletian. Apart from housing the mithraeum, the tunnels served to heat the baths and as sewers for the outflow of water. They were also used to store the fuel for the furnaces ‚Äì which are estimated to have burned around 10 tons of wood per day. Storage capacity had been estimated at more than 2,000 tons of wood. Overall, these tunnels ran for hundreds of meters underneath the main structure. They were lit by skylight-type windows that allowed the air to circulate, thus keeping the stored wood from rotting. An underground water mill was excavated beginning in 1912. First thought to be medieval in origin it is now considered to date to Antiquity. It may have been a part of the original workings of the baths. Fire damage indicates it was burned in the 3rd century, but rebuilt with some alterations.

Works of art The baths were originally ornamented with high quality sculptures, estimated to have numbered more than 120. Despite their location in one of the city's working class areas, of all the antique baths in Rome the Baths of Caracalla were found to have contained the most lavish assortment of statues. Although many were destroyed in the Middle Ages to make lime, beginning in the 16th century under Pope Paul III Farnese, sculptures were excavated from the area to serve as decorations in newly built palazzi. Among the well-known pieces recovered from the Baths of Caracalla are the Farnese Bull (probably from the eastern palaestra) and Farnese Hercules (from the frigidarium), now in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples; others are in the Museo di Capodimonte there. One of the many statues is the colossal statue of Asclepius. Two granite tubs from the frigidarium were taken to Piazza Farnese where they still serve as fountains, made by Girolamo Rainaldi. A granite column from the natatio was taken to Florence by Cosimo I de' Medici in Piazza Santa Trinita. It is now known as the Column of Justice. In the Lateran Collection of the Vatican Museums are large mosaics of rectangular panels representing athletes, which were discovered in 1824 in two of the library exedrae to the east and west of the baths complex. They have been restored and are on display in the Gregoriano Profano Museum.

In 2001, use of the venue by the opera resumed but it now uses a temporary movable stage outside of the main structure, which reduces the stress on the antique ruins. It is also a concert venue, having achieved fame as the venue and backdrop for the first Three Tenors concert in 1990.  Sporting  The area was used for the Rome Grand Prix four times between 1947 and 1951. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, the venue hosted the gymnastics events.  Visiting  The extensive ruins of the baths have become a popular tourist attraction. The baths are open to the public for an admission fee. Access is limited to certain areas/walkways to avoid additional damage to the mosaic floors. Cultural impact The original Pennsylvania Station, New York City (1916) The Baths of Caracalla (and especially the central frigidarium) had a significant impact on the architecture of many later buildings. In Roman times, these included the Baths of Diocletian and the Basilica of Maxentius. In the 19th and early 20th century, the design of the baths was used as the inspiration for several modern structures, including St George's Hall in Liverpool and the original Pennsylvania Station (demolished in 1963) in New York City. The main halls of Penn Station and Chicago Union Station made use of direct copies of the frigidarium's architecture.

The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), known by sailors as the doldrums or the calms because of its monotonous, windless weather, is the area where the northeast and southeast trade winds converge. It encircles Earth near the thermal equator, though its specific position varies seasonally. When it lies near the geographic Equator, it is called the near-equatorial trough. Where the ITCZ is drawn into and merges with a monsoonal circulation, it is sometimes referred to as a monsoon trough, a usage more common in Australia and parts of Asia. Meteorology The ITCZ was originally identified from the 1920s to the 1940s as the Intertropical Front (ITF), but after the recognition in the 1940s and the 1950s of the significance of wind field convergence in tropical weather production, the term Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) was then applied. The ITCZ appears as a band of clouds, usually thunderstorms, that encircle the globe near the Equator. In the Northern Hemisphere, the trade winds move in a southwestward direction from the northeast, while in the Southern Hemisphere, they move northwestward from the southeast. When the ITCZ is positioned north or south of the Equator, these directions change according to the Coriolis effect imparted by Earth's rotation. For instance, when the ITCZ is situated north of the Equator, the southeast trade wind changes to a southwest wind as it crosses the Equator. The ITCZ is formed by vertical motion largely appearing as convective activity of thunderstorms driven by solar heating, which effectively draw air in; these are the trade winds. The ITCZ is effectively a tracer of the ascending branch of the Hadley cell and is wet. The dry descending branch is the horse latitudes. The location of the ITCZ gradually varies with the seasons, roughly corresponding with the location of the thermal equator. As the heat capacity of the oceans is greater than air over land, migration is more prominent over land. Over the oceans, where the convergence zone is better defined, the seasonal cycle is more subtle, as the convection is constrained by the distribution of ocean temperatures. Sometimes, a double ITCZ forms, with one located north and another south of the Equator, one of which is usually stronger than the other. When this occurs, a narrow ridge of high pressure forms between the two convergence zones.  ITCZ over oceans vs. land  Seasonal variability of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), Congo air boundary (CAB), tropical rainbelt, and surface winds over Africa (adapted from Dezfuli 2017 with modification). This schematic shows that the ITCZ and the region of maximum rainfall can be decoupled over the continents. The ITCZ is commonly defined as an equatorial zone where the trade winds converge. Rainfall seasonality is traditionally attributed to the north‚Äìsouth migration of the ITCZ, which follows the sun. Although this is largely valid over the equatorial oceans, the ITCZ and the region of maximum rainfall can be decoupled over the continents. The equatorial precipitation over land is not simply a response to just the surface convergence. Rather, it is modulated by a number of regional features such as local atmospheric jets and waves, proximity to the oceans, terrain-induced convective systems, moisture recycling, and spatiotemporal variability of land cover and albedo. South Pacific convergence zone Vertical air velocity at 500 hPa, July average. Ascent (negative values) is concentrated close to the solar equator; descent (positive values) is more diffuse The South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) is a reverse-oriented, or west-northwest to east-southeast aligned, trough extending from the west Pacific warm pool southeastwards towards French Polynesia. It lies just south of the equator during the Southern Hemisphere warm season, but can be more extratropical in nature, especially east of the International Date Line. It is considered the largest and most important piece of the ITCZ, and has the least dependence upon heating from a nearby land mass during the summer than any other portion of the monsoon trough.E. Linacre and B. Geerts. Movement of the South Pacific convergence zone Retrieved on 2006-11-26. The southern ITCZ in the southeast Pacific and southern Atlantic, known as the SITCZ, occurs during the Southern Hemisphere fall between 3¬∞ and 10¬∞ south of the equator east of the 140th meridian west longitude during cool or neutral El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) patterns. When ENSO reaches its warm phase, otherwise known as El Ni√±o, the tongue of lowered sea surface temperatures due to upwelling off the South American continent disappears, which causes this convergence zone to vanish as well. Effects on weather The ITCZ moves further away from the equator during the Northern summer than the Southern one due to the North-heavy arrangement of the continents. Variation in the location of the intertropical convergence zone drastically affects rainfall in many equatorial nations, resulting in the wet and dry seasons of the tropics rather than the cold and warm seasons of higher latitudes. Longer term changes in the intertropical convergence zone can result in severe droughts or flooding in nearby areas. In some cases, the ITCZ may become narrow, especially when it moves away from the equator; the ITCZ can then be interpreted as a front along the leading edge of the equatorial air.Djuriƒá, D: Weather Analysis. Prentice Hall, 1994. . There appears to be a 15 to 25-day cycle in thunderstorm activity along the ITCZ, which is roughly half the wavelength of the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation (MJO).Patrick A. Harr. Tropical Cyclone Formation/Structure/Motion Studies. Office of Naval Research Retrieved on 2006-11-26. Within the ITCZ the average winds are slight, unlike the zones north and south of the equator where the trade winds feed. As trans-equator sea voyages became more common, sailors in the eighteenth century named this belt of calm the doldrums because of the calm, stagnant, or inactive winds. Role in tropical cyclone formation Celia and Darby in the eastern Pacific and the precursor to Hurricane Alex in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. (2010) Tropical cyclogenesis depends upon low-level vorticity as one of its six requirements, and the ITCZ fills this role as it is a zone of wind change and speed, otherwise known as horizontal wind shear. As the ITCZ migrates to tropical - subtropical latitudes and even beyond (Shandong province of the People's Republic of China) during the respective hemisphere's summer season, increasing Coriolis force makes the formation of tropical cyclones within this zone more possible. Surges of higher pressure from high latitudes can enhance tropical disturbances along its axis.C.-P. Chang, J.E. Erickson, and K.M. Lau. Northeasterly Cold Surges and Near-Equatorial Disturbances over the Winter MONEX Area during December 1974. Part I: Synoptic Aspects. Retrieved on 2007-04-26. In the north Atlantic and the northeastern Pacific oceans, tropical waves move along the axis of the ITCZ causing an increase in thunderstorm activity, and clusters of thunderstorms can develop under weak vertical wind shear. Hazards Thunderstorms along the Intertropical Convergence Zone played a role in the loss of Air France Flight 447, which left Rio de Janeiro‚ÄìGale√£o International Airport on Sunday, 31 May 2009, at about 7:00 p.m. local time (6:00 p.m. EDT or 10:00 p.m. UTC) and had been expected to land at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris on Monday, 1 June 2009, at 11:15 a.m. (5:15 a.m. EDT or 9:15 a.m. UTC).\\"Q & A Turbulences\\" 1.June.2009 The Guardian The aircraft crashed with no survivors while flying through a series of large ITCZ thunderstorms, and ice forming rapidly on airspeed sensors was the precipitating cause for a cascade of human errors which ultimately doomed the flight. Most aircraft flying these routes are able to avoid the larger convective cells without incident. In the Age of Sail, to find oneself becalmed in this region in a hot and muggy climate could mean death when wind was the only effective way to propel ships across the ocean. Calm periods within the doldrums could strand ships for days or weeks. Even today, leisure and competitive sailors attempt to cross the zone as quickly as possible as the erratic weather and wind patterns may cause unexpected delays. In literature The doldrums are notably described in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798) and also provide a metaphor for the initial state of boredom and indifference of Milo, the child hero of Norton Juster's classic children's novel The Phantom Tollbooth.

It allows files and directories of separate file systems, known as branches, to be transparently overlaid, forming a single coherent file system. Contents of directories which have the same path within the merged branches will be seen together in a single merged directory, within the new, virtual filesystem. When mounting branches, the priority of one branch over the other is specified. So when both branches contain a file with the same name, one gets priority over the other. The different branches may be either read-only or read/write file systems, so that writes to the virtual, merged copy are directed to a specific real file system. This allows a file system to appear as writable, but without actually allowing writes to change the file system, also known as copy-on-write. This may be desirable when the media is physically read-only, such as in the case of Live CDs. Unionfs was originally developed by Professor Erez Zadok and his team at Stony Brook University. Uses In Knoppix, a union between the file system on the CD-ROM or DVD and a file system contained in an image file called knoppix.img (knoppix-data.img for Knoppix 7) on a writable drive (such as a USB memory stick) can be made, where the writable drive has priority over the read-only filesystem. This allows the user to change any of the files on the system, with the new file stored in the image and transparently used instead of the one on the CD. Unionfs can also be used to create a single common template for a number of file systems, or for security reasons. It is sometimes used as an ad hoc snapshotting system. Docker uses Unionfs to layer Docker images. As actions are done to a base image, layers are created and documented, such that each layer fully describes how to recreate an action. This strategy enables Docker's lightweight images, as only layer updates need to be propagated (compared to full VMs, for example). UbuntuLTSP, the Linux Terminal Server Project implementation for Ubuntu, uses Unionfs when PXE booting thin or thick clients. Other implementations Unionfs for Linux has two versions. Version 1.x is a standalone one that can be built as a module. Version 2.x is a newer, redesigned, and reimplemented one. aufs is an alternative version of unionfs. overlayfs written by Miklos Szeredi has been used in OpenWRT and considered by Ubuntu and has been merged into the mainline Linux kernel on 26 October 2014 after many years of development and discussion for version 3.18 of the kernel. unionfs-fuse is an independent project, implemented as a user space filesystem program, instead of a kernel module or patch. Like Unionfs, it supports copy-on-write and read-only or read‚Äìwrite branches. Plan 9 from Bell Labs operating system uses union mounts extensively to build custom namespaces per user or processes. Union mounts have also been available in BSD since at least 1995. The GNU Hurd has an implementation of Unionfs. As of January 2008, it works, but results in a read-only mount-point. mhddfs works like Unionfs but permits balancing files over drives with the most free space available. It is implemented as a user space filesystem. mergerfs is a FUSE based union filesystem which offers multiple policies for accessing and writing files as well as other advanced features (xattrs, managing mixed RO and RW drives, link CoW, etc.). Sun Microsystems introduced the first implementation of a stacked, layered file system with copy-on-write, whiteouts (hiding files in lower layers from higher layers), etc. as the Translucent File Service in SunOS 3, circa 1986. JailbreakMe 3.0, a tool for jailbreaking iOS devices released in July 2011, uses unionfs techniques to speed up the installation process of the operating system modification.

As a key factor in ensuring that European sailing vessels reached North American shores, understanding the trade winds was becoming a matter of great importance at the time. Hadley was intrigued by the fact that winds which should by all rights have blown straight north had a pronounced westerly flow, and it was this mystery he set out to solve. Life Hadley was born in London, England to George Hadley (High Sheriff of Hertfordshire) and Katherine FitzJames. He had an unremarkable childhood, and was eclipsed in his early years by his older brother John Hadley (1682‚Äì1744), the inventor of the octant (a precursor to the sextant). With John and his other brother Henry, George had constructed effective Newtonian telescopes. George Hadley entered Pembroke College, Oxford, on 30 May 1700, and on 13 August 1701 became a member of Lincoln's Inn, where his father purchased chambers for him. He was called to the bar on 1 July 1709, but remained more interested in mechanical and physical studies than in legal workAnita McConnell, 2004, \\"Hadley, George (1685‚Äì1768)\\", in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford, UK:Oxford University Press. See 2008 online edition, . Retrieved 8 February 2010. For 7 years, succeeding William Derham, he was in charge of interpreting the meteorological diaries sent to the Royal Society from observers around the world, mainly in Britain and Scandinavia. He tried to correlate the data in the different temperature and pressure scales then in use and attempted to deduce general patterns that emerged over time. He twice published an account of the results in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Hadley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 20 February 1735, and on 22 May that year published a short paper in the Philosophical Transactions (vol. 39, 1735, 58‚Äì62) giving an explanation of the trade winds. His theory remained relatively unknown and was independently created several times. Among the later creators was John Dalton, who later eventually became aware of Hadley's priority. During the second half of the 19th century the theory gradually became known as \\"Hadley's principle\\".Anders Persson, 2006, \\"Hadley's Principle: Understanding and Misunderstanding the Trade Winds\\", Hist. Meteorol. 3:17‚Äì42. See . Retrieved 22 May 2014. In 1686, Edmond Halley had proposed a theory in an attempt to explain the trade winds, a theory which remained the most widely known internationally almost to the beginning of the 19th century. George Hadley's version recognised that the Earth's rotation plays a role in the direction taken by an air mass moving relative to the Earth, an element that had been missing in Halley's proposal. Later, in the second half of the 19th century, Hadley's theory was itself shown to be deficient in that it was based on an assumption that when air mass travels from one latitude to another its linear momentum is conserved. However, since the air mass is at all times in a state of circumnavigating the Earth axis, it is in fact the angular momentum that is conserved, causing an effect known as the Coriolis effect. When using the correct angular momentum conservation in calculations the predicted effect is twice as large as when the erroneous conservation of linear momentum is used. The fact that Hadley's principle is deficient in this respect is not known to everyone who should know; it can still be found in popular books and popular websites. Hadley never married. In later life he left London and lived for a while at East Barnet with a nephew, most likely his brother John Hadley's son John. Most of his later years were spent at Flitton, Bedfordshire, where another nephew, Hadley Cox (d. 1782), son of his sister Elizabeth, was vicar. Hadley died at Flitton on 28 June 1768 aged 83 years, and was buried in the chancel of Flitton church. Another nephew, Henry's son John, also became a Fellow of the Royal Society.

The university is situated in Semenyih, Selangor, Malaysia. The university has been ranked as \\"excellent\\" or tier 5 in a scale of tier 1-6 and is classified as a private institution, by the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education. The campus is run as a company called The University of Nottingham Malaysia Sdn Bhd (473520-K) with the provost being dual hatted as the CEO. The majority shareholder is Boustead Holdings. The Malaysia campus was the first campus of a British university in Malaysia and one of the first to open outside Britain thus earning the distinction of the Queen's Awards for Enterprise 2001 and the Queen's Award for Industry (International Trade) 2006. The University of Nottingham's other overseas campus is located in Ningbo, China.  History  Following an invitation from the Ministry of education to establish an overseas campus, a partnership between Boustead Holdings Berhad, YTL Corporation Berhad and the University of Nottingham was formally announced in 1998. This development was the first ever branch campus of a British University established outside of the UK. The University of Nottingham welcomed its first 89 students in September 2000 in Kuala Lumpur. In 2005, the University relocated to 118 acre campus in Semenyih, in the valley of Broga Hill. In 2006, the campus reopened a Kuala Lumpur branch in Chulan Tower on Jalan Conlay to teach MBA students.https://www.nottingham.edu.my/AboutUs/History/MalaysiaHistory.aspx  Campus  Aerial view of Campus Main building and lake  Semenyih campus  The Malaysia campus is primarily based on a plot situated in Semenyih, Selangor.

The complex also has a multipurpose hall with two multipurpose courts for basketball, dodgeball, futsal, volleyball and even badminton.  KL Teaching Centre (KLTC)  Besides the main campus in Semenyih, a city teaching facility is maintained in Chulan Tower in Kuala Lumpur's central business district. Postgraduate programmes, such as applied psychology, business and management, are taught at the KL Teaching Centre. https://www.nottingham.edu.my/AboutUs/Datesandcampusinformation/Mapsanddirections/KLTC.aspx  Academic  Being a branch campus of the University of Nottingham, students are not necessarily taught with similar course materials and generally do not sit the same exam papers as those in the UK, but are still under the jurisdiction of the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA). Upon completing a degree at the Malaysia campus, students are awarded a University of Nottingham degree certificate at a convocation held locally which is indistinguishable from the certificates awarded at the Nottingham campus. The degrees that are awarded are accredited by international professional bodies such as the Association of MBAs and the UK Engineering Council. The Engineering Degree courses are accredited by the Board of Engineering Malaysia (BEM) and the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA).

As a composer, according to Manfred Bukofzer, \\"His individual, if not subjective, style has no precedent in baroque music and clearly heralds the end of the entire era\\" (Bukofzer 1947, 234), while Luigi Torchi maintained that \\"he rescued the imperiled music of the eighteenth century\\" (Torchi 1901, 180). His contemporary, Charles Burney, held that \\"he had certainly a great share of whim and caprice, but he built his freaks on a good foundation, being an excellent contrapuntist\\" (Burney 1789, 4:569). The asteroid 10875 Veracini was named after him. Life Plaque commemorating Veracini on via Palazzuolo 30, Florence Francesco Maria Veracini was born at about 8:00 a.m. on 1 February 1690 in the family house on the via Palazzuolo, parish of San Salvatore, Ognissanti, Florence (Hill 1979, 7). The second and only surviving son of Agostino Veracini, a pharmacist and undertaker (and ironically one of the few Veracinis who was not a violinist, even as an amateur) he was taught the violin by his uncle, Antonio Veracini, with whom he later often appeared in concert, as well as by Giovanni Maria Casini and his assistant Francesco Feroci. His grandfather, Francesco (di Niccol√≤) Veracini, had been one of the first violinists of Florence, and ran a music school in the house until ill health forced him to turn the business over to his eldest son, Antonio, in 1708. In addition, the family managed a painting studio and possessed a large collection of art works, including four Ghirlandaios, a Rubens, a Caracci and a dozen other paintings by the three members of the family from two generations, including Francesco's third son, Benedetto (Hill 1979, 3‚Äì4; Hill 1990, 550; Hill 2001). The painter Niccol√≤ Agostino Veracini was Francesco Maria's cousin (Hill 1979, 4). Veracini esteemed Carlo Ambrogio Lonati as a great violinist (Aficionado54 2010). Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari one of the main churches in Venice He is known to have been a soloist in Venice at the Christmas masses at San Marco, on 24 and 25 December 1711 (Hill 2001). On 1 February 1712 he performed a violin concerto of his own composition (the first recorded public performance by Veracini playing one of his own compositions), accompanied by trumpets, oboes, and strings as part of the celebrations in honour of the Austrian ambassador to Venice of the newly elected Holy Roman Emperor, Charles VI. The celebration, held in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari included a vocal Te Deum and Mass, as well as motets and concertos performed under the direction of padre Ferdinando Antonio Lazari. The manuscript scores of all the works performed that day, including Veracini's concerto, were bound together in a handsome presentation volume now found in the National Library of Austria (Hill 1979, 11; Sadie n.d., 48). According to another opinion, this concerto was Veracini's Violin Concerto in D Major, \\"a otto strumenti, di Francesco Maria Ueracini Suonato dallo stesso al post comunio\\", 1711), but was performed in Frankfurt rather than Venice, at Charles VI's coronation on 22 December 1711, just two days before Veracini's appearance as a soloist on Christmas Eve in Venice, some 800 kilometers to the south (Kolneder 1959‚Äì61; White 1972, 19). Young August in 1716 In 1714, Veracini went to London and played instrumental pieces (\\"symphonies\\" in contemporary parlance) between the acts of operas at the Queen's Theatre. At the court of Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici he performed his oratorio Mos√® al Mar Rosso. In 1716 he was appointed as the head of a Venetian music school, (Sminthe 2013). There is a legend that, when Giuseppe Tartini heard Veracini playing the violin, he was so impressed by his bowing technique, and so dissatisfied with his own skill, that he retreated the next day to Ancona \\"in order to study the use of the bow in more tranquility, and with more convenience than at Venice, as he had a place assigned him in the opera orchestra of that city\\" (Burney 1789, 3:564‚Äì65). Veracini wrote a set of violin/recorder sonatas dedicated to Prince Friedrich August, who came to celebrate carnival. The Prince recruited not only singers, as he was told to do by his father, but also musicians for the court in Dresden. He hired an entire opera company under the direction of the Italian composer Antonio Lotti, the librettist Antonio Maria Lucchini, the castrati Senesino and Matteo Berselli, the brothers Mauro architects, two painters, and two carpenters (Charlton 2000). In 1718 the Prince also secured the services of the eccentric Francesco Maria Veracini‚Äîat a very high salary‚Äî Johann David Heinichen and Giuseppe Maria Boschi (Greene 1985, 263). Dresden Opera house \\"am Zwinger\\" in Dresden, designed by Matth√§us Daniel P√∂ppelmann; interior decorations by Alessandro und Giramolo Mauro. For the wedding of the crown prince in September 1719 three operas composed by Lotti were performed within two weeks. Highlight was Teofane; all the guests had to appear \\"alla Turca\\" (Byram-Wigfield 2013). Drawing by Carl Heinrich Jacob Fehling (1719) View of Dresden, the opera house am Zwinger right in the middle and before it was destroyed in 1849 To justify his salary, Veracini had to compose chamber music for the court (Landmann 2013, 5), transferring him to the official payroll as Kapellmeister in August 1717 and not as a violinist (Walter 2000, 5). In 1719 Veracini was sent to recruit more Italian singers for the new Dresden opera, \\"am Zwinger\\". Whilst in Venice he secured the services of Margherita Durastanti and Vittorio Tesi and in Bologna added Maria Antonia Laurenti. Veracini also took the opportunity to visit his home town where he married Chiara Tesi. In 1721 Veracini wrote another set of violin sonatas dedicated to the Prince (published in Dresden as his Opus 1). Unfortunately, there was animosity among all these gifted musicians at the court in Dresden. In 1722, the arrogant Veracini was involved in a quarrel, staged according to one source (Cramer 1784) by the composer and violinist Pisendel, which resulted in Veracini leaping out of an upper-story window and breaking his foot in two places and (also) his hip. There are two conflicting accounts of this incident on August 13, one involving humiliation of Veracini at the hands of the last-desk violinist in the orchestra, who was asked to play the same concerto, replacing Veracini. Pisendel had been rehearsing his composition intensively with this violinist. The braggart Veracini fell into such a rage over this that he did not come out of his room for several days, and out of shame and despair finally publicly threw himself out of a window onto the street in Dresden. According to Veracini the jealous German musicians allegedly plotted to murder him (so he claimed in his writings). He fled Dresden by jumping out a window and apparently broke a leg in the fall (Shulman 2013, 89). After the incident Veracini walked with a limp for the rest of his life (Shulman 2013, 89). It is a myth Senesino was involved in the quarrel as he was either dismissed by Heinichen or by the court which ran out of money (Anon. n.d.). G.F. Handel offered the singer a contract for London two years before the alleged incident with Veracini. It seems the Dresden musicians, fearing for their position, felt relieved Veracini had left the city. Back in his native Florence in 1723, Veracini played music in a church. During this time he suffered from his bad reputation and was said by Charles Burney to have been \\"usually qualified with the title of Capo pazzo\\" [\\"head lunatic\\"] (Burney 1789, 3:568). He composed a Te Deum for the inauguration of Pope Clement XII in 1730. His uncle Antonio died in 1733, leaving the bulk of his estate to Francesco Maria. Amongst other things, this included no fewer than eight violins made by Jacob Stainer and three Amatis (Hill 1990, 550, 562n34&43). London Metastasio on the left, Farinelli in the middle. Next to him the painter Jacopo Amigoni Back in London in 1733, Veracini appeared in many concerts (Hill 1979, 22). In 1735 he composed an opera for the Opera of the Nobility, Adriano in Siria. Francesca Cuzzoni, Antonio Montagnana, Farinelli and Senesino had a role (Burden 2007, 31). George Frederic Handel was present at the premiere in Haymarket Theatre. Charles Jennens liked the opera and ordered a score; Lord Hervey, not known for his musical perception, and Henry Liddell, 1st Baron Ravensworth were bored (Dean 2006, 278‚Äì79; Van Til 2007, 121). However, the work enjoyed a run of twenty performances over six months (Helyard 2000). Many of the arias were published separately by John Walsh . Veracini composed the fifth version, based on Pietro Metastasio‚Äôs libretto, written for the Habsburg Emperor Charles VI. The score, which survived in the Newman Flower Collection (or the Henry Watson Music Library?) of the Manchester Central Library was developed by German musicologist Holger Schmitt-Hallenberg along with Fabio Biondi, who composed the recitatives that have not been preserved. It was performed in Krak√≥w December 2013 and in Vienna and Madrid in January 2014 (Skowro≈Ñska 2013; Anon. 2013a; Anon. 2013c; Anon. 2013d). Violin by J. Stainer In 1737, he wrote La Clemenza di Tito, on a libretto by Angelo Maria Cori based on Metastasio. In 1738 Veracini wrote his third opera, Partenio, and returned to Florence where he stayed till 1741. Back in London he composed his last opera, Roselinda, based on Shakespeare's play As You Like It, a most unusual choice of material at that time. In that opera Veracini included the well-known Scots ballad tune The Lass of Paties Mill. It was staged in London in 1744, the same year his oratorio (described as an opera in Burney 1789, 4:451) L'errore di Salomone was staged. Burney (1789, 4:451), scorned the music of Roselinda as \\"wild, awkward, and unpleasant; manifestly produced by a man unaccustomed to write for the voice, and one possessed of a capo pazzo\\", and ridiculed the inclusion of the ballad tune as an attempt \\"to flatter the English\\" that failed because \\"few of the North Britons, or admirers of this national and natural Music, frequent the opera, or mean to give half a guinea to hear a Scots tune, which perhaps their cook-maid Peggy can sing better than any foreigner\\", but confessed that \\"This opera, to my great astonishment when I examined the Music, ran twelve nights\\", whereas L'errore di Salomone was given only twice. Veracini left London a little more than a year later. In 1745 or shortly after, he survived a shipwreck in which he lost two of his Stainer violins (the ones he called St. Peter and St. Paul), \\"thought to have been the best in the world\\", and all of his effects (Burney 1789, 4:569). He returned to Florence, where he was appointed maestro di capella of the churches of San Pancrazio and San Gaetano, the latter one at which his uncle had worked, focusing on church music. Though he mostly conducted in his later years, he still sometimes appeared as a violinist. Veracini died in Florence. Compositions In addition to violin sonatas, edited by Ferdinand David, operas and oratorios, Veracini also wrote violin concertos, sonatas for recorder and basso continuo, and orchestral suites, called Overtures. The six Overtures were performed for Prince Friedrich August in Venice in 1716, as part of Veracini's ultimately successful attempt to secure a position at the Dresden court. They are all either in F major or B-flat major, except for one in G minor. The last one of these, in B-flat major, is remarkable for concluding with a unison minuet. Veracini also wrote a \\"lively, highly original theory treatise\\" (Newman 1972, 184), Il trionfo della pratica musicale, and edited other composers' works, adding \\"improvements\\" of his own, such as he did in his Dissertazioni with the Opus 5 Violin Sonatas of Arcangelo Corelli.

History The phrase was first used in sociology by Morton Grodzins when he adopted the phrase from physics where it referred to the adding a small amount of weight to a balanced object until the additional weight caused the object to suddenly and completely topple, or tip. Grodzins studied integrating American neighborhoods in the early 1960s. He discovered that most of the white families remained in the neighborhood as long as the comparative number of black families remained very small. But, at a certain point, when \\"one too many\\" black families arrived, the remaining white families would move out en masse in a process known as white flight. He called that moment the \\"tipping point\\". The idea was expanded and built upon by Nobel Prize-winner Thomas Schelling in 1971. SCHELLING, THOMAS C. \\"DYNAMIC MODELS OF SEGREGATION.\\" Statistics at UC Berkeley  Department of Statistics, 1971, . Accessed 11 Feb. 2020. A similar idea underlies Mark Granovetter's threshold model of collective behavior. 10% of a Population Scientists at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have found that when just 10 percent of the population holds an unshakable belief, their belief will always be adopted by the majority of people who simply change their beliefs if their last two social interactions agreed with a new one. Other uses The phrase has extended beyond its original meaning and been applied to any process in which, beyond a certain point, the rate of the process increases dramatically. It has been applied in many fields, from economics to human ecology to epidemiology. It can also be compared to phase transition in physics or the propagation of populations in an unbalanced ecosystem. Journalists and academics have applied the phrase to dramatic changes in governments, such as during the Arab Spring. The concept of a tipping point is described in an article in an academic journal, the Journal of Democracy, titled \\"China at the Tipping Point?: Foreseeing the unForeseeable\\": > Regime transitions belong to that paradoxical class of events which are > inevitable but not predictable. Other examples are bank runs, currency > inflations, strikes, migrations, riots, and revolutions. In retrospect, such > events are explainable, even overdetermined. In prospect, however, their > timing and character are impossible to anticipate. Such events seem to come > closer and closer but do not occur, even when all the conditions are > ripe‚Äîuntil suddenly they do. American journalists at NPR have used it to describe an influx of sexual assault allegations, saying that a tipping point has been passed regarding societal tolerance of sexual harassment and feminism. Mathematically, the angle of repose may be seen as a bifurcation. In control theory, the concept of positive feedback describes the same phenomenon, with the problem of balancing an inverted pendulum being the classic embodiment. The concept has also been applied to the popular acceptance of new technologies, for example being used to explain the success of VHS over Betamax. Furthermore, the concept has been applied to analyze global decarbonization pathways and the ability to activate contagious and fast-spreading processes of social and technological change that would accelerate carbon emission reductions needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement In popular culture The term was popularized in application to daily life by Malcolm Gladwell's 2000 bestselling book The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference.

Photo shows Rich Froning Jr. ‚Äì four-time winner of \\"Fittest Man on Earth\\" title. Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest. Before the industrial revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the day‚Äôs activities without undue fatigue. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, and to meet emergency situations.  Overview  Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy. Around 1950, perhaps consistent with the Industrial Revolution and the treatise of World War II, the term \\"fitness\\" increased in western vernacular by a factor of ten.\\"Google Ngram Viewer\\". Google. The modern definition of fitness describes either a person or machine's ability to perform a specific function or a holistic definition of human adaptability to cope with various situations. This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant aerobic or anaerobic ability, i.e. endurance or strength. A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practising only one, such as only cardio/respiratory endurance or only weight training. A comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses on one or more specific skills, and on age- or health-related needs such as bone health.\\"Exercise for Your Bone Health\\". nih.gov. Many sources also cite mental, social and emotional health as an important part of overall fitness. This is often presented in textbooks as a triangle made up of three points, which represent physical, emotional, and mental fitness. Physical fitness can also prevent or treat many chronic health conditions brought on by unhealthy lifestyle or aging. Working out can also help some people sleep better and possibly alleviate some mood disorders in certain individuals. Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as myokines, which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.  Activity guidelines  The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans were released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to provide science-based guidance for people ages 3 years and older to improve their health by participating in regular physical activity. These guidelines recommend that all adults should move more and sit less throughout the day to improve health-related quality of life including mental, emotional, and physical health. For substantial health benefits, adults should perform at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both spread throughout the week. The recommendation for physical activity to occur in bouts of at least 10 minutes has been eliminated as new research suggests that bouts of any length contribute to the health benefits linked to the accumulated volume of physical activity. New (July 2011) guidelines in the United Kingdom include the following points;:! The intensity at which we exercise is key, and light activity such as strolling and housework is unlikely to have much positive impact on the health of most people. For aerobic exercise to be beneficial, it must raise the heart rate and cause perspiration. Everyone should do a minimum of 150 minutes a week of moderate- intensity aerobic exercise, but that really is the minimum for health benefits. If you do so beyond 150 minutes, you will gain even more health benefits. Sedentary time (time spent not standing, such as when on the toilet or in bed) is bad for everyone's health, and no amount of exercise can negate the effects of sitting for too long. These guidelines are now much more in line with those used in the U.S., which also includes recommendations for muscle-building and bone-strengthening activities such as lifting weights and yoga. The U.S. guidelines continue: Additional health benefits may be achieved by engaging in more than 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are of moderate or greater intensity and involve all major muscle groups on two or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.  Exercise = Aerobic exercise  Cardiorespiratory fitness can be measured using VO2 max, a measure of the amount of oxygen the body can uptake and utilize. Aerobic exercise, which improves cardiorespiratory fitness, involves movement that increases the heart rate to improve the body's oxygen consumption. This form of exercise is an important part of all training regiments ranging from professional athletes to the everyday person. Also, it helps increase stamina. A woman jogging at a beach in the U.S. to maintain/improve her physical fitness Examples are: *Jogging ‚Äì Running at a steady and gentle pace. This form of exercise is great for maintaining weight and building a cardiovascular base to later perform more intense exercises. * Elliptical training ‚Äì This is a stationary exercise machine used to perform walking, or running without causing excessive stress on the joints. This form of exercise is perfect for people with achy hips, knees, and ankles. *Walking ‚Äì Moving at a fairly regular pace for a short, medium or long distance. *Treadmill training ‚Äì Many treadmills have programs set up that offer numerous different workout plans. One effective cardiovascular activity would be to switch between running and walking. Typically warm up first by walking and then switch off between walking for three minutes and running for three minutes. *Swimming ‚Äì Using the arms and legs to keep oneself afloat and moving either forwards or backward. This is a good full-body exercise for those who are looking to strengthen their core while improving cardiovascular endurance. *Cycling ‚Äì Riding a bicycle typically involves longer distances than walking or jogging. This is another low-impact exercise on the joints and is great for improving leg strength.  Anaerobic exercise  Anaerobic exercise features high-intensity movements performed in a short period of time. It is a fast, high-intensity exercise that doesn‚Äôt require the body to utilize oxygen to produce energy. It helps to promote strength, endurance, speed, and power; and is used by bodybuilders to build workout intensity. Thought to increase the metabolic rate which, allows you to burn additional calories as the body recovers from exercise due to an increase in body temperature and excess post- exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) after the exercise ended. Examples are: * Weight lifting - A common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles. *Isometric exercise - Helps to maintain strength. A muscle action in which no visible movement occurs and the resistance matches the muscular tension. *Sprinting - Running short distances as fast as possible * Interval training - alternating short bursts (lasting around 30 seconds) of intense activity with longer intervals (three to four minutes) of less intense activity.  Training  Specific or task-oriented fitness is a person's ability to perform in a specific activity with a reasonable efficiency: for example, sports or military service. Specific training prepares athletes to perform well in their sport. Examples are: * 100 m sprint: in a sprint, the athlete must be trained to work anaerobically throughout the race, an example of how to do this would be interval training. * Century Ride: cyclists must be prepared aerobically for a bike ride of 100 miles or more. * Middle distance running: athletes require both speed and endurance to gain benefit out of this training. The hard-working muscles are at their peak for a longer period of time as they are being used at that level for the longer period of time. * Marathon: in this case, the athlete must be trained to work aerobically and their endurance must be built-up to a maximum. * Many firefighters and police officers undergo regular fitness testing to determine if they are capable of the physically demanding tasks required of the job. * Members of armed forces are often required to pass a formal fitness test. For example, soldiers of the U.S. Army must be able to pass the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT). * Hill sprints: requires a high level of fitness to begin with; the exercise is particularly good for the leg muscles. The Army often trains to do mountain climbing and races. * Plyometric and isometric exercises: An excellent way to build strength and increase muscular endurance. * Sand running creates less strain on leg muscles than running on grass or concrete. This is because sand collapses beneath the foot, softening the landing. Sand training is an effective way to lose weight and become fit, as more effort is needed (one and a half times more) to run on the soft sand than on a hard surface. * Aquajogging is a form of exercise that decreases strain on joints and bones. The water supplies minimal impact to muscles and bones, which is good for those recovering from injury. Furthermore, the resistance of the water as one jogs through it provides an enhanced effect of exercise (the deeper you are the greater the force needed to pull your leg through). Swimmers perform squats prior to entering the pool in a U.S. military base, 2011. * Swimming: Squatting exercise helps in enhancing a swimmer's start. For physical fitness activity to benefit an individual, the exertion triggers a response called a stimulus. Exercise with the correct amount of intensity, duration, and frequency can produce a significant amount of improvement. The person may overall feel better, but the physical effects on the human body take weeks or months to notice and possibly years for full development. For training purposes, exercise must provide a stress or demand on either a function or tissue. To continue improvements, this demand must eventually increase little over an extended period of time. This sort of exercise training has three basic principles: overload, specificity, and progression. These principles are related to health but also enhancement of physical working capacity.  High intensity interval training  High-intensity interval training (HIIT) consists of repeated, short bursts of exercise, completed at a high level of intensity. These sets of intense activity are followed by a predetermined time of rest or low-intensity activity. Studies have shown that exercising at a higher intensity has increased cardiac benefits for humans, compared to when exercising at a low or moderate level. When your workout consists of a HIIT session, your body has to work harder to replace the oxygen it lost. Research into the benefits of HIIT have revealed that it can be very successful for reducing fat, especially around the abdominal region. Furthermore, when compared to continuous moderate exercise, HIIT proves to burn more calories and increase the amount of fat burned post- HIIT session. Lack of time is one of the main reasons stated for not exercising; HIIT is a great alternative for those people because the duration of a HIIT session can be as short as 10 minutes, making it much quicker than conventional workouts.  Effects = Controlling blood pressure  Physical fitness has proven to result in positive effects on the body's blood pressure because staying active and exercising regularly builds up a stronger heart. The heart is the main organ in charge of systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. Engaging in a physical activity raises blood pressure. Once the subject stops the activity, the blood pressure returns to normal. The more physical activity that one engages in, the easier this process becomes, resulting in a more ‚Äòfit‚Äô individual. Through regular physical fitness, the heart does not have to work as hard to create a rise in blood pressure, which lowers the force on the arteries, and lowers the overall blood pressure.  Cancer prevention  Centers for disease control and prevention provide lifestyle guidelines for maintaining a balanced diet and engaging in physical activity to reduce the risk of disease. The WCRF/ American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) published a list of recommendations that reflect the evidence they have found through consistency in fitness and dietary factors that directly relate to cancer prevention. The WCRF/AICR recommendations include the following: * Be as lean as possible without becoming underweight. * Each week, adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous- intensity physical activity. * Children should engage in at least one hour of moderate or vigorous physical activity each week. * Be physically active for at least thirty minutes every day. * Avoid sugar, and limit the consumption of energy-packed foods. * Balance one's diet with a variety of vegetables, grains, fruits, legumes, etc. * Limit sodium intake, the consumption of red meats, and the consumption of processed meats. * Limit alcoholic drinks to two for men and one for women a day.Alberts, David S. and Hess, Lisa M. (2005). Fundamentals of Cancer Prevention. Berlin: Springer, . These recommendations are also widely supported by the American Cancer Society. The guidelines have been evaluated and individuals that have higher guideline adherence scores substantially reduce cancer risk as well as help control a multitude of chronic health problems. Regular physical activity is a factor that helps reduce an individual‚Äôs blood pressure and improves cholesterol levels, two key components that correlate with heart disease and Type 2 Diabetes.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 1996. The American Cancer Society encourages the public to \\"adopt a physically active lifestyle\\" by meeting the criteria in a variety of physical activities such as hiking, swimming, circuit training, resistance training, lifting, etc. It is understood that cancer is not a disease that can be cured by physical fitness alone, however, because it is a multifactorial disease, physical fitness is a controllable prevention. The large associations tied with being physically fit and reduced cancer risk are enough to provide a strategy to reduce cancer risk. The American Cancer Society asserts different levels of activity ranging from moderate to vigorous to clarify the recommended time spent on a physical activity. These classifications of physical activity consider intentional exercise and basic activities performed on a daily basis and give the public a greater understanding of what fitness levels suffice as future disease prevention.  Inflammation  Studies have shown an association between increased physical activity and reduced inflammation. It produces both a short-term inflammatory response and a long-term anti-inflammatory effect. Physical activity reduces inflammation in conjunction with or independent of changes in body weight. However, the mechanisms linking physical activity to inflammation are unknown.  Immune system  Physical activity boosts the immune system. This is dependent on the concentration of endogenous factors (such as sex hormones, metabolic hormones and growth hormones), body temperature, blood flow, hydration status and body position. Physical activity has shown to increase the levels of natural killer (NK) cells, NK T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils, complements, cytokines, antibodies and T cytotoxic cells. However, the mechanism linking physical activity to immune system is not fully understood.  Weight control  Achieving resilience through physical fitness promotes a vast and complex range of health-related benefits. Individuals who keep up physical fitness levels generally regulate their distribution of body fat and prevent obesity. Abdominal fat, specifically visceral fat, is most directly affected by engaging in aerobic exercise. Strength training has been known to increase the amount of muscle in the body, however, it can also reduce body fat. Sex steroid hormones, insulin, and appropriate immune responses are factors that mediate metabolism in relation to abdominal fat. Therefore, physical fitness provides weight control through regulation of these bodily functions.  Menopause and physical fitness  Menopause is often said to have occurred when a woman has had no vaginal bleeding for over a year since her last menstrual cycle. There are a number of symptoms connected to menopause, most of which can affect the quality of life of a woman involved in this stage of her life. One way to reduce the severity of the symptoms is to exercise and keep a healthy level of fitness. Prior to and during menopause, as the female body changes, there can be physical, physiological or internal changes to the body. These changes can be reduced or even prevented with regular exercise. These changes include: * Preventing weight gain: around menopause women tend to experience a reduction in muscle mass and an increase in fat levels. Increasing the amount of physical exercise undertaken can help to prevent these changes. * Reducing the risk of breast cancer: weight loss from regular exercise may offer protection from breast cancer. * Strengthening bones: physical activity can slow the bone loss associated with menopause, reducing the chance of bone fractures and osteoporosis. * Reducing the risk of disease: excess weight can increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, and regular physical activity can counter these effects. * Boosting mood: being involved in regular activities can improve psychological health, an effect that can be seen at any age and not just during or after menopause. The Melbourne Women's Midlife Health Project followed 438 women over an eight-year period providing evidence showing that even though physical activity was not associated with VMS in this cohort at the beginning, Women who reported they were physically active every day at the beginning were 49% less likely to have reported bothersome hot flushes. This is in contrast to women whose level of activity decreased and were more likely to experience bothersome hot flushes.  Mental health  Studies have shown that physical activity can improve mental health and well-being. This improvement is due to an increase in blood flow to the brain and the release of hormones. Being physically fit and working out on a consistent basis can positively impact one's mental health and bring about several other benefits, such as the following. * Physical activity has been linked to the alleviation of depression and anxiety symptoms. * In patients suffering from schizophrenia, physical fitness has been shown to improve their quality of life and decrease the effects of schizophrenia. * Being fit can improve one's self-esteem. * Working out can improve one's mental alertness and it can reduce fatigue. * Studies have shown a reduction in stress levels. * Increased opportunity for social interaction, allowing for improved social skills To achieve some of these benefits, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests at least 30‚Äì60 minutes of exercise 3-5 times a week.  History  Ladies performing a common 19th- century fitness routine including climbing the underside of a ladder, balancing and gymnastics. Physical fitness has always been an important part of life. It is theorized that when people left a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and formed fixed communities based around agriculture that physical fitness levels declined. This is not to say that levels of physical labor decreased but that the type of work undertaken was not necessarily as conducive to a general level of fitness. As such, regimented fitness regimes were either invented or became more common. This was especially the case in classical civilizations such as Ancient Greece and Rome. In Greece, physical fitness was considered to be an essential component of a healthy life and it was the norm for men to frequent a gymnasium. Physical fitness regimes were also considered to be of paramount importance in a nation's ability to train soldiers for an effective military force. Partly for these reasons, organized fitness regimes have been in existence throughout known history and evidence of them can be found in many countries. Gymnasiums which would seem familiar today began to become increasingly common in the 19th century. The industrial revolution had led to a more sedentary lifestyle for many people and there was an increased awareness that this had the potential to be harmful to health. This was a key motivating factor for the forming of a physical culture movement, especially in Europe and the USA. This movement advocated increased levels of physical fitness for men, women, and children and sought to do so through various forms of indoor and outdoor activity, and education. In many ways, it laid the foundations for modern fitness culture.https://exercise.lovetoknow.com/Physical_Fitness_History  Education  * American Council on Exercise (ACE) * National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) * International Sports Science Association (ISSA)  See also  * 20th century women's fitness culture *Bodybuilding * Fitness fashion * Fitness professional * Healthy diet * Health * Health club * Outline of exercise * Personal trainer * Physical exercise * Power training * Strength training * Weight training  References  Further reading  * * Category:Physical exercise Category:Strength training ","title":"Physical fitness"},{"id":"432988","text":"Giuseppe Tartini Giuseppe Tartini (8 April 1692 ‚Äì 26 February 1770) was an Italian Baroque composer and violinist born in the Republic of Venice. Biography Monument in the Basilica of St Anthony in Padua Tartini was born in Piran (now part of Slovenia), a town on the peninsula of Istria, in the Republic of Venice to Gianantonio ‚Äì native of Florence ‚Äì and Caterina Zangrando, a descendant of one of the oldest aristocratic Piranese families.Tartini The official web site of Portoro≈æ and Piran It appears Tartini's parents intended him to become a Franciscan friar and, in this way, he received basic musical training. He studied law at the University of Padua, where he became skilled at fencing. After his father's death in 1710, he married Elisabetta Premazore, a woman his father would have disapproved of because of her lower social class and age difference. Unfortunately, Elisabetta was a favorite of the powerful Cardinal Giorgio Cornaro, who promptly charged Tartini with abduction. Tartini fled Padua to go to the monastery of St. Francis in Assisi, where he could escape prosecution. While there, Tartini took up playing the violin. Legend says when Tartini heard Francesco Maria Veracini's playing in 1716, he was impressed by it and dissatisfied with his own skill. He fled to Ancona and locked himself away in a room to practise, according to Charles Burney, \\"in order to study the use of the bow in more tranquility, and with more convenience than at Venice, as he had a place assigned him in the opera orchestra of that city\\". Tartini's skill improved tremendously and, in 1721, he was appointed Maestro di Cappella at the Basilica di Sant'Antonio in Padua, with a contract that allowed him to play for other institutions if he wished. In Padua he met and befriended fellow composer and theorist Francesco Antonio Vallotti. Tartini was the first known owner of a violin made by Antonio Stradivari in 1715, which Tartini bestowed upon his student Salvini, who in turn gave it to the Polish composer and virtuoso violinist Karol Lipi≈Ñski upon hearing him perform: the instrument is thus known as the Lipinski Stradivarius. Tartini also owned and played the Antonio Stradivarius violin ex-Vogelweith from 1711. In 1726, Tartini started a violin school which attracted students from all over Europe. Gradually, Tartini became more interested in the theory of harmony and acoustics, and from 1750 to the end of his life he published various treatises. He died in Padua. Tartini's home town, Piran (Slovenia), now has a statue of him in the square, which was the old harbour, originally Roman, named Tartini Square (, ). Silted up and obsolete, the port was cleared of debris, filled, and redeveloped. One of the old stone warehouses is now the Hotel Giuseppe Tartini. His birthday is celebrated by a concert in the main town cathedral.  Compositions  Statue of Tartini in Piran, Slovenia Today, Tartini's most famous work is the \\"Devil's Trill Sonata\\", a solo violin sonata that requires a number of technically demanding double stop trills and is difficult even by modern standards. According to a legend embroidered upon by Madame Blavatsky , Tartini was inspired to write the sonata by a dream in which the Devil appeared at the foot of his bed playing the violin. Almost all of Tartini's works are violin concerti (at least 135) and violin sonatas. Tartini's compositions include some sacred works such as a Miserere, composed between 1739 and 1741 at the request of Pope Clement XII,Biography at istrianet.org, under External links and a Stabat Mater, composed in 1769.Biography on Allmusic, under External links He also composed trio sonatas and a sinfonia in A. Tartini's music is problematic to scholars and editors because Tartini never dated his manuscripts, and he also revised works that had been published or even finished years before, making it difficult to determine when a work was written, when it was revised and what the extent of those revisions were. The scholars Minos Dounias and Paul Brainard have attempted to divide Tartini's works into periods based entirely on the stylistic characteristics of the music. Sixty-two manuscripts with compositions of Tartini are housed at the Biblioteca comunale Luciano Benincasa in Ancona.Biblioteca Communale Luciano Benincasa (AN) Luigi Dallapiccola wrote a piece called Tartiniana based on various themes by Tartini. Theoretical work In addition to his work as a composer, Tartini was a music theorist, of a very practical bent. He is credited with the discovery of sum and difference tones, an acoustical phenomenon of particular utility on string instruments (intonation of double- stops can be judged by careful listening to the difference tone, the \\"terzo suono\\"). He published his discoveries in a treatise \\"Trattato di musica secondo la vera scienza dell'armonia\\" (Padua, 1754). His treatise on ornamentation was eventually translated into French ‚Äî though when its influence was rapidly waning, in 1771 ‚Äî by a certain \\"P. Denis\\", whose introduction called it \\"unique\\"; indeed, it was the first published textTypically, Tartini never published the Italian original itself, but it circulated widely in manuscript, and Leopold Mozart appropriated sections of it for his own Violinschule, written in 1754, published at Augsburg, 1756. (Sol Babitz, ed. \\"Treatise on Ornamentation\\" Journal of Research in Music Education 4.2 [Autumn 1956:75‚Äì102]). devoted entirely to ornament and, though it was all but forgotten, as only the printed edition survived, has provided first-hand information on violin technique for modern historically informed performances, once it was published in English translation by Sol Babitz in 1956. Of greater assistance to such performance was Erwin Jacobi's published edition. In 1961, Jacobi published a tri-lingual edition consisting of the French (basis of the following two), English (translation by Cuthbert Girdlestone), plus Jacobi's own translation into German (Giuseppe Tartini. \\"Traite des agr√©ments de la musique\\", trans. and ed. Erwin Jacobi. Celle: Hermann Moeck Verlag, 1961). Of significant import, Jacobi's edition also includes a facsimile of the original Italian found in Venice in 1957, copied in the hand of Giovanni Nicolai (one of Tartini's best known students) and including an opening section on bowing and a closing section on how to compose cadenzas not previously known. Another copy (though less complete) of the Italian original was found among manuscripts purchased by the University of California, Berkeley in 1958, a collection that also included numerous ornamented versions of slow movements of concertos and sonatas, written in Tartini's hand. Minnie Elmer analyzed these ornamented versions in her master's thesis at UC, Berkeley in 1959 (Minnie Elmer. \\"The Improvised Ornamentation of Giuseppe Tartini\\". Unpublished M.A. thesis. Berkeley, 1959).  Fictional portrayal  Tartini is mentioned in Madame Blavatsky's \\"The Ensouled Violin\\", a short story included in the collection Nightmare Tales. The folklore of the \\"Devil's violin\\", classically exemplified by a similar story told of Niccol√≤ Paganini, is widespread; it is an instance of the deal with the devil. Modern variants are Roland Bowman's The Devil's Violin and the country song The Devil Went Down to Georgia; the PBS segment on violin in its series \\"Art\\" was titled \\"Art of violin: the devil's instrument\\". Tartini's The Devil's Trill is the signature work of a central character in Daniel Silva's The English Assassin. Anna Rolfe, the daughter of a Swiss banker, is a famous violinist and the sonata features prominently in the novel. The story of Tartini's inspirational dream is told. Tartini's \\"The Devil's Trill\\" is also featured in the Japanese anime Descendants of Darkness (Yami no Matsuei). The three part story is also named after the song.

These are: * The Needham‚ÄìSchroeder Symmetric Key Protocol, based on a symmetric encryption algorithm. It forms the basis for the Kerberos protocol. This protocol aims to establish a session key between two parties on a network, typically to protect further communication. * The Needham‚ÄìSchroeder Public-Key Protocol, based on public-key cryptography. This protocol is intended to provide mutual authentication between two parties communicating on a network, but in its proposed form is insecure. The symmetric protocol Here, Alice (A) initiates the communication to Bob (B). S is a server trusted by both parties. In the communication: * A and B are identities of Alice and Bob respectively * KAS is a symmetric key known only to A and S * KBS is a symmetric key known only to B and S * NA and NB are nonces generated by A and B respectively * KAB is a symmetric, generated key, which will be the session key of the session between A and B The protocol can be specified as follows in security protocol notation: A \\\\rightarrow S: \\\\left . A,B,N_A \\\\right . :Alice sends a message to the server identifying herself and Bob, telling the server she wants to communicate with Bob. S \\\\rightarrow A: {N_A, K_{AB}, B, {K_{AB}, A}_{K_{BS}}}_{K_{AS}} :The server generates {K_{AB}} and sends back to Alice a copy encrypted under {K_{BS}} for Alice to forward to Bob and also a copy for Alice. Since Alice may be requesting keys for several different people, the nonce assures Alice that the message is fresh and that the server is replying to that particular message and the inclusion of Bob's name tells Alice who she is to share this key with. A \\\\rightarrow B: {K_{AB}, A}_{K_{BS}} :Alice forwards the key to Bob who can decrypt it with the key he shares with the server, thus authenticating the data. B \\\\rightarrow A: {N_B}_{K_{AB}} :Bob sends Alice a nonce encrypted under {K_{AB}} to show that he has the key. A \\\\rightarrow B: {N_B-1}_{K_{AB}} :Alice performs a simple operation on the nonce, re-encrypts it and sends it back verifying that she is still alive and that she holds the key.  Attacks on the protocol  The protocol is vulnerable to a replay attack (as identified by Denning and Sacco). If an attacker uses an older, compromised value for KAB, he can then replay the message {K_{AB}, A}_{K_{BS}} to Bob, who will accept it, being unable to tell that the key is not fresh.  Fixing the attack  This flaw is fixed in the Kerberos protocol by the inclusion of a timestamp. It can also be fixed with the use of nonces as described below. At the beginning of the protocol: :: A \\\\rightarrow B: A :Alice sends to Bob a request. :: B \\\\rightarrow A: {A,\\\\mathbf{N_B'}}_{K_{BS}} :Bob responds with a nonce encrypted under his key with the Server. :: A \\\\rightarrow S: \\\\left . A,B,N_A,{A,\\\\mathbf{N_B'}}_{K_{BS}} \\\\right . :Alice sends a message to the server identifying herself and Bob, telling the server she wants to communicate with Bob. :: S \\\\rightarrow A: {N_A, K_{AB}, B, {K_{AB}, A,\\\\mathbf{N_B'}}_{K_{BS}}}_{K_{AS}} :Note the inclusion of the nonce. The protocol then continues as described through the final three steps as described in the original protocol above. Note that N_B' is a different nonce from N_B.The inclusion of this new nonce prevents the replaying of a compromised version of {K_{AB}, A}_{K_{BS}} since such a message would need to be of the form {K_{AB}, A,\\\\mathbf{N_B'}}_{K_{BS}} which the attacker can't forge since she does not have K_{BS}. The public-key protocol This assumes the use of a public-key encryption algorithm. Here, Alice (A) and Bob (B) use a trusted server (S) to distribute public keys on request. These keys are: * KPA and KSA, respectively public and private halves of an encryption key-pair belonging to A (S stands for \\"secret key\\" here) * KPB and KSB, similar belonging to B * KPS and KSS, similar belonging to S. (Note that this key-pair will be used for digital signatures, i.e., KSS used for signing a message and KPS used for verification. KPS must be known to A and B before the protocol starts.) The protocol runs as follows: A \\\\rightarrow S: \\\\left . A, B \\\\right . :A requests B's public keys from S S \\\\rightarrow A: {K_{PB}, B}_{K_{SS}} :S responds with public key KPB alongside B's identity, signed by the server for authentication purposes. A \\\\rightarrow B: {N_A, A}_{K_{PB}} : A chooses a random NA and sends it to B. B \\\\rightarrow S: \\\\left. B, A \\\\right . : B now knows A wants to communicate, so B requests A's public keys. S \\\\rightarrow B: {K_{PA}, A}_{K_{SS}} : Server responds. B \\\\rightarrow A: {N_A, N_B}_{K_{PA}} :B chooses a random NB, and sends it to A along with NA to prove ability to decrypt with KSB. A \\\\rightarrow B: {N_B}_{K_{PB}} :A confirms NB to B, to prove ability to decrypt with KSA At the end of the protocol, A and B know each other's identities, and know both NA and NB. These nonces are not known to eavesdroppers. An attack on the protocol Unfortunately, this protocol is vulnerable to a man-in-the- middle attack. If an impostor I can persuade A to initiate a session with them, they can relay the messages to B and convince B that he is communicating with A. Ignoring the traffic to and from S, which is unchanged, the attack runs as follows: A \\\\rightarrow I: {N_A, A}_{K_{PI}} :A sends NA to I, who decrypts the message with KSI I \\\\rightarrow B: {N_A, A}_{K_{PB}} :I relays the message to B, pretending that A is communicating B \\\\rightarrow I: {N_A, N_B}_{K_{PA}} :B sends NB I \\\\rightarrow A: {N_A, N_B}_{K_{PA}} :I relays it to A A \\\\rightarrow I: {N_B}_{K_{PI}} :A decrypts NB and confirms it to I, who learns it I \\\\rightarrow B: {N_B}_{K_{PB}} :I re-encrypts NB, and convinces B that she's decrypted it At the end of the attack, B falsely believes that A is communicating with him, and that NA and NB are known only to A and B. The following example illustrates the attack. Alice (A) would like to contact her bank (B). We assume that an impostor (I) successfully convinces A that they are the bank. As a consequence A uses the public key of I instead of using the public key of B to encrypt the messages she intends to send to her bank. Therefore, A sends I her nonce encrypted with the public key of I. I decrypts the message using their private key and contacts B sending it the nonce of A encrypted with the public key of B. B has no way to know that this message was actually sent by I. B responds with their own nonce and encrypts the message with the public key of A. Since I is not in possession of the private key of A they have to relay the message to A without knowing the content. A decrypts the message with her private key and respond with the nonce of B encrypted with the public key of I. I decrypts the message using their private key and is now in possession of nonce A and B. Therefore they can now impersonate the bank and the client respectively.  Fixing the man- in-the-middle attack  The attack was first described in a 1995 paper by Gavin Lowe. The paper also describes a fixed version of the scheme, referred to as the Needham‚ÄìSchroeder‚ÄìLowe protocol. The fix involves the modification of message six to include the responder's identity, that is we replace: B \\\\rightarrow A: {N_A, N_B}_{K_{PA}} with the fixed version: B \\\\rightarrow A: {N_A, N_B, B}_{K_{PA}} and the intruder cannot successfully replay the message because A is expecting a message containing the identity of I whereas the message will have identity of B.

His father, also named Thomas, worked for the Mundy family. His mother, Lucy Green, was a slave of Hugh Newell (1744‚Äì1816) of Freehold Township, New Jersey. She was manumitted at age 21 by Newell's will. He was a school janitor between 1870 and 1878 and a general handyman in Perth Amboy. Active in the Republican Party, and the Prohibition Party.

To honor Thomas Mundy Peterson as the first African- American voter after the passage of the 15th Amendment, the citizens of Perth Amboy raised $70 (about $1,800 in 2019 dollars) to award him with a gold medallion. The full medallion consists of a gold bar from which a two-inch diameter medallion was hung. The hanging medallion featured a profile bust of a clean-shaven Abraham Lincoln.

Penrose argues that human consciousness is non-algorithmic, and thus is not capable of being modeled by a conventional Turing machine, which includes a digital computer. Penrose hypothesizes that quantum mechanics plays an essential role in the understanding of human consciousness. The collapse of the quantum wavefunction is seen as playing an important role in brain function. Most of the book is spent reviewing, for the scientifically-minded layreader, a plethora of interrelated subjects such as Newtonian physics, special and general relativity, the philosophy and limitations of mathematics, quantum physics, cosmology, and the nature of time. Penrose intermittently describes how each of these bears on his developing theme: that consciousness is not \\"algorithmic\\". Only the later portions of the book address the thesis directly. Overview Penrose states that his ideas on the nature of consciousness are speculative, and his thesis is considered erroneous by experts in the fields of philosophy, computer science, and robotics.Various critical reactions to be found in Behavioral and Brain Sciences vol. 13 #4 (1990), 643‚Äì705, and vol. 16 #3 (1993), 611‚Äì622, e.g. M. Davis \\"How subtle is Godel‚Äôs theorem? More on Roger Penrose\\"M. Davis (1995), \\"Is mathematical insight algorithmic\\", Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 13 (4), 659‚Äì60. Following the publication of this book, Penrose began to collaborate with Stuart Hameroff on a biological analog to quantum computation involving microtubules, which became the foundation for his subsequent book, Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness. The Emperor's New Mind attacks the claims of artificial intelligence using the physics of computing: Penrose notes that the present home of computing lies more in the tangible world of classical mechanics than in the imponderable realm of quantum mechanics. The modern computer is a deterministic system that for the most part simply executes algorithms. Penrose shows that, by reconfiguring the boundaries of a billiard table, one might make a computer in which the billiard balls act as message carriers and their interactions act as logical decisions. The billiard-ball computer was first designed some years ago by Edward Fredkin and Tommaso Toffoli of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Only this one had shop windows. East German books, as on display here, were not sold in normal Intershop stores. Intershop was a chain of government-owned and operated retail stores in the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) in which only hard currencies (and later Forum checks) could be used to purchase high-quality goods. The East German mark was not accepted as payment. Intershop was originally oriented towards visitors from Western countries, and later became an outlet where East Germans could purchase goods they could not otherwise obtain. An unintended consequence was that ordinary East Germans had some insight into the selection of goods available in the West, which they could then compare with the rather limited offerings available in their own country. Product offerings Intershops sold imported products such as cigarettes, liquor, appliances and even car accessories. It even sold quality East Germany products that were exported and then re-imported. Those items were sometimes sold at a lower price than the same product, as sold in domestic shops.  History  Intershop was founded on 14 December 1962 as a publicly owned company (Volkseigener Betrieb - VEB). Its purpose was to increase the flow of hard currency into the GDR. There was such a lack of foreign currency that even small amounts were welcome and this was a big problem. The groups targeted were mainly tourists and other foreigners in transit from the West. The first mobile carts were in the Berlin Friedrichstra√üe station, where cigarettes were sold for much less than in West Berlin. Little by little, alcohol and other goods were gradually added. By 1962, annual sales totalled more than one million Deutsche Marks (DM). Originally, Intershop was organised as a division of Mitropa, the company that provided catering services to the Deutsche Reichsbahn. With the arrival of the first Interhotels, which were intended to house Western tourists, Intershops also began appearing in these Western-oriented hotels. One could also purchase items in one's room (via room service) with hard currency. Over time, these hotel-based Intershops grew as well. Later, Intershops were opened at border crossings, rest stops and transit stops on the GDR Autobahns, railway stations, bus stations, ferry terminals and airports. As an example of the GDR regime's desire for hard currency, in the 1980s, in the Berlin Friedrichstra√üe underground (U-Bahn) station, there was an Intershop kiosk on the platform of the U6 line created specifically for travellers from West Berlin who may not have wanted to pass through the GDR border controls. One could disembark from the underground train, make a purchase, and then get back on the next train, and go back to West Berlin, all without passing through the GDR border controls. Purchases could be paid for with any fully convertible currency, such as US dollars, Pounds Sterling, Swiss francs, and especially West German marks. Until 1974, GDR citizens were not allowed to hold foreign currency. By decree of the Council of Ministers of the GDR (Ministerrat der DDR), this ban was relaxed in that year, and East Germans were then allowed to shop in most Intershops. The Intershops at Autobahn rest stops (so-called \\"Transitshops\\"), which were sometimes self-service, were still only for travellers from non-socialist countries and required travel documents for entry. Additionally, certain duty- free items such as tobacco, spirits, coffee, perfume, brand name clothing, watches and jewellery required a foreign passport. The prices for these goods were significantly lower than in West Germany or West Berlin, while the other goods that would have interested East Germans were relatively expensive. East Germans could not legally exchange East German marks for hard currency. The only legal ways for East Germans to acquire hard currency were either as gifts from relatives living in the West or wages earned for work in Western countries. For East Germans without hard currency, there were 300 Exquisit shops (which sold higher priced clothing, shoes, and cosmetics) from 1962 onwards and 550 Delikat shops (which sold high end and gourmet food items) from 1976 onwards. Most of the goods sold in Exquisit and Delikat shops were of East German origin but were normally unavailable in the regular state-run stores. These shops were intended to give East Germans access to high-quality goods and to absorb surplus purchasing power. In 1977, Erich Honecker said, \\"These shops obviously aren't permanent companions of socialism. But we can't ignore the fact that the rising number of visitors is bringing more such currency among us than before.\\" Honecker made these remarks in response to criticism that Intershops were a key driver of inequality. In the same speech, Honecker defended trade with capitalist countries. He said, \\"Naturally, we haven't overlooked the fact that the citizens of the German Democratic Republic who have no such funds are at a disadvantage, in a certain sense, compared to those who have such currency at their disposal.\\" Honecker said the 9.5 million yearly visitors from capitalist countries \\"who eat with us, usually spend the night and obviously also have money in their pockets. Through the Intershops, we have created the possibility that these funds stay with us in the country.\\" Starting in April 1979, East Germans were required to convert hard currency at the East German state bank (Staatsbank der DDR) into so-called forum checks. A forum check mark had a value of one West German mark. The Forum Au√üenhandelsgesellschaft mbH was responsible for the management of Intershops and had 900 employees. By 1978, there were reportedly 100 Intershops in operation across East Germany. It was noted that Intershop gave an opportunity for West German companies, as well as companies based in the West, to sell consumer goods to a communist bloc country. The rise of Intershop was noted to have created a visibly separate social class in East Germany, where people who had access to an Intershop, as well as the means to shop there, were seen consuming items offered by the chain. Consumerism promoted by the existence of Intershop also caused labour disputes in some areas, with workers demanding part of their salary to be paid in hard currency so that they could shop at Intershop. The Ministry of State Security (Stasi) monitored the Intershops very closely, with relatives of Stasi employees or officials often working as cashiers. In some stores, security cameras were present, and in the beginning, passports were even checked. The transport of these goods was closely monitored as well. Even so, there were numerous thefts and even some armed robberies of Intershop stores. The investigations of these crimes always involved the Stasi as well as the regular police. In many cases, store managers and employees were involved in the crimes. Beginning in the 1980s, a portion of the salary of Intershop workers was paid in hard currency and additionally employees had to surrender their tips, according to regulations, in order to curb these problems. The Intershops were dissolved upon the reunification of Germany in 1990. Because photographing in Intershops was not allowed, there are few photographs of the inside of the stores. Most of those that do exist are from the Stasi archives. A West German photographer, G√ºnter Schneider, collected numerous photos of Intershops while working on a larger report about the transit corridors in East Germany.Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk; 2005; \\"Der Intershop\\"; Kantstr. 71 - 73; D-04275 Leipzig; Post: D-04360 Leipzig; Telefon: +49(0)341-3000; E-Mail: zuschauerservice@mdr.de  See also  * Pewex * Eastern Bloc economies  References Further reading *Jonathan R.

In 1978, Heider sold the studio and its name to Filmways, but remained as manager until 1980 when Filmways sold it to a partnership composed of Dan Alexander, Tom Sharples, and Michael Ward. The three partners renamed the business Hyde Street Studios, which is still an operating recording studio as of 2019, now owned solely by Michael Ward. History In early 1969, Heider opened Wally Heider's Studio at 245 Hyde Street, San Francisco, between Turk and Eddy Streets, across the street from Black Hawk jazz club, in a building that had previously been used by 20th Century Fox for film offices, screening rooms and storage Heider had reportedly apprenticed as an assistant and mixer at United Western Recorders in Hollywood, CA, with Bill Putnam, known as \\"The Father of Modern Recording\\" for his technical innovations, and he already owned and ran an independent recording studio and remote recording setup called Wally Heider Recording, in Hollywood, California, which was one of the most successful such operations in the world. Heider and his crew were very well known for making excellent studio and remote location recordings and for top notch engineering. Two years earlier, in 1967, Heider had been involved in live recording at the Monterey Pop Festival. Artists like Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Service and The Grateful Dead had been recording in Los Angeles and New York, and Heider saw the need for musicians involved in the nascent San Francisco Sound to have their own well equipped and staffed recording studio close to home. The studios were built by Dave Mancini, who later built his own studio in the San Fernando Valley. Heider planned four studios‚ÄîA and B on the ground floor and C and D upstairs. However, studio B was never finished and instead became a game room. Frank DeMedio built all the studios' custom gear and consoles, using Universal Audio (UA) console components, military grade switches and level controls, and a simple audio path that used one preamp for everything in a channel. He designed the console with 24 channels and an 8-channel monitor and cue‚Äîreplicated in both the Studio 3 setup in Los Angeles and the remote truck. Monitor speakers were Altec 604-Es with McIntosh 275 tube power amps. They completed Studio C first and it began operating in May 1969 with staff that included General Manager Mel Tanner, Booking Agent Ginger Mews, Technician Harry Sitam, and Staff Engineer Russ Gary. Its dimensions were similar to Heider's Studio 3 in Hollywood‚Äîthough its control room, instead of being at the end the room, was parallel to Studio C's long side. The walls were kept from being parallel with square gypsum devices that were used as mid-range sound diffusers and absorbers. At the Grateful Dead's request, its studio doors were covered with airbrushed paintings. Studios A and D became operational a few months later. According to researchers who later explored studio history for Hyde Street Studios, the first release out of studio C was the Jefferson Airplane‚Äôs Volunteers, which was also the first album they recorded in their hometown. Between 1969 and 1970, many other high-profile acts followed, including Harry Nilsson, Crosby Stills Nash and Young, the Steve Miller Band. Creedence Clearwater Revival recorded several albums in that room, and named their record, Cosmo's Factory after the \\"factory\\" at Studio C (Cosmo's Factory was CCR's rehearsal area.). Engineers and staff of that era also included Bill Halverson, Stephen Barncard, and Glyn Johns. While Crosby Stills Nash and Young were recording, studio D opened. It was an exact replica of Heider's Hollywood Studio 3. Among its first uses was to record Jerry Garcia‚Äôs steel guitar overdub for Teach Your Children, while the live recording setup was kept intact in studio C, where CSNY recorded. In that same period, Deane Jensen supervised installation of a new Quad Eight console in studio A. Santana and John Hall used studio D a few times. CBS Records had a priority lease on Studio D for a year, before eventually taking over Coast Recorders as their west coast recording facility. Many other artists followed.

It allows individuals communicating over such a network to prove their identity to each other while also preventing eavesdropping or replay attacks and allowing for the detection of modification. The protocol can be specified as follows in security protocol notation, where Alice is authenticating herself to Bob using a server S (M is a session-identifier, NA and NB are nonces): # A \\\\rightarrow B: M,A,B,{N_A,M,A,B}_{K_{AS}} # B \\\\rightarrow S: M,A,B,{N_A,M,A,B}_{K_{AS}},{N_B, M,A,B}_{K_{BS}} # S \\\\rightarrow B: M,{N_A,K_{AB}}_{K_{AS}},{N_B,K_{AB}}_{K_{BS}} # B \\\\rightarrow A: M,{N_A,K_{AB}}_{K_{AS}} Note: The above steps do not authenticate B to A. This is one of the protocols analysed by Burrows, Abadi and Needham in the paper that introduced an early version of Burrows‚ÄìAbadi‚ÄìNeedham logic.  Attacks on the protocol  There are a variety of attacks on this protocol currently published.  Interception attacks  These attacks leave the intruder with the session key and may exclude one of the parties from the conversation. Boyd and Mao observe that the original description does not require that S check the plaintext A and B to be the same as the A and B in the two ciphertexts. This allows an intruder masquerading as B to intercept the first message, then send the second message to S constructing the second ciphertext using its own key and naming itself in the plaintext. The protocol ends with A sharing a session key with the intruder rather than B. G√ºrgens and Peralta describe another attack which they name an arity attack. In this attack the intruder intercepts the second message and replies to B using the two ciphertexts from message 2 in message 3. In the absence of any check to prevent it, M (or perhaps M,A,B) becomes the session key between A and B and is known to the intruder. Cole describes both the G√ºrgens and Peralta arity attack and another attack in his book Hackers Beware. In this the intruder intercepts the first message, removes the plaintext A,B and uses that as message 4 omitting messages 2 and 3. This leaves A communicating with the intruder using M (or M,A,B) as the session key.  Disruptive attacks  This attack allows the intruder to disrupt the communication but does not allow the intruder to gain access to it. One problem with this protocol is that a malicious intruder can arrange for A and B to end up with different keys. Here is how: after A and B execute the first three messages, B has received the key K_{AB}. The intruder then intercepts the fourth message. He resends message 2, which results in S generating a new key K'_{AB}, subsequently sent to B. The intruder intercepts this message too, but sends to A the part of it that B would have sent to A. So now A has finally received the expected fourth message, but with K'_{AB} instead of K_{AB}.

Child labor laws in the United States address issues related to the employment and welfare of working minors and children in the United States. The most sweeping federal law that restricts the employment and abuse of child workers is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Child labor provisions under FLSA are designed to protect the educational opportunities of youth and prohibit their employment in jobs that are detrimental to their health and safety. FLSA restricts the hours that youth under 16 years of age can work and lists hazardous occupations too dangerous for young workers to perform. Federal law The main law regulating child labor in the United States is the Fair Labor Standards Act. For non-agricultural jobs, children under 14 may not be employed, children between 14 and 16 may be employed in allowed occupations during limited hours, and children between 16 and 17 may be employed for unlimited hours in non-hazardous occupations. A number of exceptions to these rules exist, such as for employment by parents, newspaper delivery, and child actors. The regulations for agricultural employment are generally less strict. State laws States have varying laws covering youth employment. Each state has minimum requirements such as, earliest age a child may begin working, number of hours a child is allowed to be working during the day, number of hours a child is allowed to be worked during the week. The United States Department of Labor lists the minimum requirements for agricultural work in each state. Where state law differs from federal law on child labor, the law with the more rigorous standard applies. Individual states have a wide range of restrictions on labor by minors, often requiring work permits for minors who are still enrolled in high school, limiting the times and hours that minors can work by age and imposing additional safety regulations. History of children's labor for wages \\"Addie Card, 12 years. Spinner in North Pormal [i.e., Pownal] Cotton Mill. Vt.\\" by Lewis Hine, 1912 - 1913 Children working with mules in a coal mine As the United States industrialized, factory owners hired young workers for a variety of tasks. Especially in textile mills, children were often hired together with their parents. Children had a special disposition to working in factories and mines as their small statures were useful to fixing machinery and navigating the small areas that fully grown adults could not. Many families in mill towns depended on the children's labor to make enough money for necessities. Activism against child labor The National Child Labor Committee, an organization dedicated to the abolition of all child labor, was formed in 1904. By publishing information on the lives and working conditions of young workers, it helped to mobilize popular support for state-level child labor laws. These laws were often paired with compulsory education laws which were designed to keep children in school and out of the paid labor market until a specified age (usually 12, 14, or 16 years.) In 1916, under pressure from the NCLC and the National Consumers League, the United States Congress passed the Keating‚ÄìOwen Act, regulating interstate commerce involving goods produced by employees under the ages of 14,15 or 16, depending on the type of work, which was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson. It was the first federal child labor law. However, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law two years later in Hammer v. Dagenhart (1918), declaring that the law violated the Commerce Clause by regulating intrastate commerce. Later that year, Congress attempted to levy a tax on businesses with employees under the ages of 14 or 16 (again depending on the type of work), which was struck down by the Supreme Court in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture (1923). In response to these setbacks, Congress, on June 2, 1924, approved an amendment to the United States Constitution that would authorize Congress to regulate \\"labor of persons under eighteen years of age\\", and submitted it to the state legislatures for ratification. Only five states ratified the amendment in the 1920s. However, President Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs administration supported it, and another 14 states signed on in 1933 (his first year in office); 28 states in all had given their approval by 1937. An additional 8 states were needed at the time to ratify the proposed amendment. The common legal opinion on federal child labor regulation reversed in the 1930s. Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 regulating the employment of those under 16 or 18 years of age, and the Supreme Court upheld the law. After this shift, the amendment has been described as \\"moot\\" and effectively part of the Constitution. However, while the 1938 labor law placed limits on many forms of child labor, agricultural labor was excluded. As a result, approximately 500,000 children pick almost a quarter of the food currently produced in the United States. In 1994 the Arkansas state Federation of Labor placed a child welfare initiative on the ballot prohibiting child labor, which the voters passed. Human rights organizations have documented child labor in USA. According to a 2009-2010 petition by Human Rights Watch: \\"Hundreds of thousands of children are employed as farm workers in the United States, often working 10 or more hours a day. They are often exposed to dangerous pesticides, experience high rates of injury, and suffer fatalities at five times the rate of other working youth. Their long hours contribute to alarming drop-out rates. Government statistics show that barely half ever finish high school. According to the National Safety Council, agriculture is the second most dangerous occupation in the United States. However, current US child labor laws allow child farm workers to work longer hours, at younger ages, and under more hazardous conditions than other working youths. While children in other sectors must be 12 to be employed and cannot work more than 3 hours on a school day, in agriculture, children can work at age 12 for unlimited hours before and after school.\\" Each state may have their own child labor laws but according to the US Dept of Labor's OSHA regulations, federal labor laws apply to any youth under 16. The only way a child of any age can work any job at any time in an agricultural field is if the farm is owned by the child's parent or legal guardian. Youths of 12 and 13 must have written consent for working only non-hazardous jobs around their school hours. Youths of the ages 14 and 15 have these same restrictions, except they don't need to have written consent of their parents, as long as they're working around school hours and non-hazardous jobs. As for 16 and up, they do not need written consent and can work any agricultural job at any given time, however, they must receive at least minimum wage for any work performed. They must also be trained to handle any sort of machinery, chemicals and pesticide they would be using on the job.https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/youth/agriculture/other.html See also * Marie Moentmann (1900-1974), child survivor of industrial accident *Carmela Teoli (1897 ‚Äì ca. 1970), child survivor of industrial accident * Timeline of children's rights in the United States *United States labor law References Category:United States labor law Category:Child labor in the United States Category:Child labour law ","title":"Child labor laws in the United States"},{"id":"433011","text":"Associative memory may refer to: * Associative memory (psychology), the ability to learn and remember the relationship between unrelated items * Associative storage, or content-addressable memory, a type of computer memory used in certain very high speed searching applications * Autoassociative memory, all computer memories that enable one to retrieve a piece of data from only a tiny sample of itself * Bidirectional associative memory, a type of recurrent neural network * Hopfield network, a form of recurrent artificial neural network * Transderivational search in psychology or cybernetics, a search for a fuzzy match across a broad field ","title":"Associative memory"},{"id":"433013","text":"Hippuris vulgaris (from Greek: ·ºµœÄœÄŒøœÇ ‚Äî horse and Œø·ΩêœÅŒ¨ ‚Äî tail), known as mare's-tail or common mare's-tail, is a common aquatic plant of Eurasia and North America ranging from Greenland to the Tibetan Plateau to Arizona.

It roots underwater, but most of its leaves are above the water surface. The leaves occur in whorls of 6-12; those above water are 0.5 to 2.5 cm long and up to 3 mm wide, whereas those under water are thinner and limper, and longer than those above water, especially in deeper streams. The stems are solid and unbranched but often curve, and can be up to 60 cm long. In shallow water they project 20‚Äì30 cm out of the water. It grows from stout rhizomes.

Allin was best known for his controversial live performances, which often featured transgressive acts, including self- mutilation and assaulting audience members, for which he was arrested and imprisoned on multiple occasions. AllMusic and G4TV's That's Tough have called him \\"the most spectacular degenerate in rock & roll history\\" and the \\"toughest rock star in the world\\". Known more for his notorious stage antics than for his music, Allin recorded prolifically, not only in the punk rock genre, but also in spoken word, country, and more traditional-style rock. His lyrics, which often expressed themes of violence and misanthropy, polarized listeners and created varied opinions of him within the highly politicized punk community. Allin's music was often poorly recorded and produced, given limited distribution, and met with mostly negative reviews from critics,Weisbard, Eric, Spin Alternative Record Guide, Vintage Book s, 1995 although he maintained a cult following throughout and after his career. Allin promised for several years that he would commit suicide on stage during one of his concerts, but instead died from an accidental drug overdose on June 28, 1993, at the age of 36. Early life Allin was born Jesus Christ Allin at Weeks Memorial Hospital in Lancaster, New Hampshire, the younger of two sons born to Merle Colby Allin, Sr. (October 20, 1923 ‚Äì June 23, 2001) and Arleta Gunther (August 17, 1936 ‚Äì August 7, 2019) He was given this name because his father told his wife that Jesus Christ had visited him, and told him that his newborn son would be a great man in the vein of the Messiah. During early childhood, Allin's older brother Merle was unable to pronounce \\"Jesus\\" properly and called him \\"Jeje\\", which became \\"GG\\". Allin's family lived in a log cabin with no running water or electricity in Groveton, New Hampshire. His father was an abusive religious fanatic who threatened his family with death, digging graves in their cellar and threatening to fill them in the near future. In an essay titled \\"The First Ten Years\\", Allin wrote that Merle Sr. wanted to kill his family in a murder‚Äìsuicide. He \\"despised pleasure\\" and allowed his family \\"very little contact with others\\". They lived a \\"primitive existence\\" and \\"were more like prisoners than a family\\". Allin also stated that his mother attempted to escape before she filed for divorce, but Merle Sr. thwarted the attempt by kidnapping Allin.Lifestory: GG Allin (including relevant excerpt of The First Ten Years) Allin said that he was glad to experience such an upbringing, and that it \\"made [him] a warrior soul at an early age.\\" In 1961, Arleta filed for divorce from Merle Sr., as his mental instability was worsening. Allin and his brother were from that time raised by their mother and stepfather, and settled in East St. Johnsbury, Vermont, in 1966. Arleta changed her younger son's legal name to Kevin Michael Allin on March 2, 1962, during his first year of schooling. Arleta had allowed his birth name to stand until this point and finally changed it to give her son a chance of a mockery- free childhood. Allin, a poor student, was placed in special education classes and required to repeat the third grade. According to his older brother, he experienced bullying by fellow students for nonconformity.Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies. Dir: Todd Phillips, 1994. In his second year of high school, he began attending school cross-dressed, which he said was inspired by the New York Dolls. When asked about his childhood, Allin said that it was \\"very chaotic. Full of chances and dangers. We sold drugs, stole, broke into houses, cars. Did whatever we wanted to for the most part ‚Äì including all the bands we played in. People even hated us back then.\\" Recording career=Early years Allin's earliest musical influences were 1960s British Invasion bands including the Beatles, Greg Van Voorst, the Rolling Stones, and the Dave Clark Five.Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies ‚Äì Bonus features, \\"Merle & Dino Interview\\". Minute marker 0:00:23: \\"We were into, y'know, all the early British Invasion stuff, like the early-mid 60s... The Beatles, Greg Van Voorst, and The Rolling Stones, and The Dave Clark 5, and The Monkees, and all that kind of stuff, you know.\\" In the early '70s, Alice Cooper became an important influence on Allin. Allin's earliest recorded musical endeavors were as a drummer, he also wrote most of his songs on an acoustic guitar. In his mid-teens, he and his older brother Merle, who plays bass guitar, formed their first band, Little Sister's Date, which lasted a little over a year. The group covered songs by Aerosmith, Kiss, and other popular rock bands of the time period. Both Allin and Merle gained a strong interest in punk rock. The Ramones and the Stooges were major influences on Allin. He graduated from Concord High School in Concord, Vermont, in 1975, and shortly after formed the band Malpractice with his older brother, local musician Jeff Penny, and Brian Demurs (a high school friend). Allin played the drums for Malpractice until the band separated in 1977. In September 1977 to April 1984, he started fronting the Jabbers. Allin's 1980 debut album was Always Was, Is and Always Shall Be for Orange Records. In addition to singing he played drums on most tracks. It would be reissued for the first time on CD in 1995 by the Halycon imprint. At one point, industry veteran and the Dead Boys producer Genya Ravan served as his manager. Tension within the Jabbers mounted as Allin grew uncontrollable, uncompromising and vicious. The Jabbers disbanded the spring of 1984, their second to last show was opening for Charged GBHhttps://archive.org/stream/GGAllinAmericasFavoriteSonAutobiography/2005%20-%20America%E2%80%99s%20Favorite%20Son%20-%20GG%20Allin%20Autobiography_djvu.txt. Allin fronted many acts during the early to mid-1980s. This includes albums from the Cedar Street Sluts, the Scumfucs in 1982 and the Texas Nazis in 1985. Allin remained in the underground hardcore scene, yet was not part of the East Coast hardcore scene. His performances in Manchester, New Hampshire, with the Cedar Street Sluts earned him the nickname of \\"the Madman of Manchester\\". Allin gained wider attention with the ROIR cassette-only release of Hated in the Nation (1987) containing tracks from Allin's out-of-print catalog with the Jabbers, the Scumfucs and the Cedar Street Sluts. The tape also featured several in-studio and in-concert recordings with an all-star band assembled by producer Maximum RocknRoll and early Allin patron Mykel Board. This band featured J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr. on lead guitar and Bongwater record producer/musician Mark Kramer on bass. Mid-era and more extreme live performances By the mid- to late 1980s, Allin was addicted to alcohol and generally abused any intoxicants provided to him. Allin first defecated onstage in 1985 at a show in Peoria, Illinois. According to fellow performer Bloody Mess, \\"I was with him when he bought the Ex-Lax. Unfortunately, he ate it hours before the show, so he constantly had to hold it in or he would've shit before he got onstage... After he shit onstage, complete chaos broke out in the hall... All of the old men in charge of the hall went fucking NUTS!.. Hundreds of confused punk kids were flipping out, running out the door, because the smell was INCREDIBLE.\\" Defecation became a regular part of his stage act. Allin idolized country music legend Hank Williams and saw himself as a kindred spirit. Both were relative loners and outsiders, both were habitual users of intoxicants, both lived with few (if any) possessions, and both traveled the country relentlessly. Allin's acoustic output, documented on the EP The Troubled Troubador, was heavily influenced by Williams. He recorded his own rewrites of Hank Williams, Jr.'s \\"Family Tradition\\" and David Allan Coe's \\"Longhaired Redneck\\", calling his own versions \\"Scumfuc Tradition\\" and \\"Outlaw Scumfuc\\", respectively. Later, Allin also released another country album, Carnival of Excess, his most refined record. During this period, Allin collaborated with Bulge (also known as Psycho under a different name, on the album Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies), the Aids Brigade (the 7\\" EP Expose Yourself to Kids) and the Holymen (You Give Love a Bad Name). Allin also began performing many spoken word pieces. Video footage of these is available but rare. Unwilling to seek steady employment, Allin supported himself by selling his own records. Allin was also fascinated with serial killers. He wrote to and visited John Wayne Gacy in prison a number of times and Gacy painted a portrait of Allin, which became the album cover to the soundtrack of the film Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies. By this point, Allin's performances, which often resulted in considerable damage to venues and sound equipment, were regularly stopped by police or venue owners after only a few songs. Allin was charged with assault and battery or indecent exposure a number of times. His constant touring was only stopped by jail time or by long hospital stays for broken bones, blood poisoning, and other physical trauma. Another attraction to Allin performances was his continual threats of suicide. In 1989, Allin wrote to Maximum RocknRoll stating that he would commit suicide on stage on Halloween 1989. However, he was in jail when that day came. He continued his threat each following year but ended up imprisoned each following Halloween. When asked why he did not follow through with his threats, Allin stated, \\"With GG, you don't get what you expect‚Äîyou get what you deserve.\\" He also stated that suicide should only be done when one had reached one's peak, meeting the afterlife at one's strongest point and not at one's weakest. In June 1993, Allin made an appearance on The Jane Whitney Show. This interview is infamous for being his last interview and for Allin's aggression toward the audience. Allin openly stated that he would commit suicide and take his fans with him. When questioned by Jane, he clarified that he would make them commit suicide as well or he would kill them. Allin also stated that, at 35, he could sleep with 12-, 13- and 16-year-old girls, boys and animals and claimed that he raped both women and men at his concerts. Letter from November 1989 1989 trial and imprisonment In late 1989, Allin was arrested and charged with \\"assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder\\" of a female acquaintance in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In a psychological evaluation made as part of the trial, Allin was judged as having at least average intelligence, and was described as \\"courteous, cooperative and candid\\". The unnamed evaluator noted that Allin did not appear psychotic, and seemed comfortable with his unorthodox lifestyle. However, the evaluator asserted Allin was dependent on alcohol and had a mixed personality disorder with narcissistic, borderline and masochistic features. Allin initially denied the charges, claiming that the woman was a willing participant in their sexual activities. Allin admitted to cutting her, burning her, and drinking her blood, but insisted that she did the same thing to him. Allin also claimed that inconsistencies in the woman's statements to authorities supported his assertions. The judge in the case agreed there were substantial inconsistencies in the woman's account. Ultimately, however, Allin plea bargained to the reduced charge of felonious assault, and he was imprisoned from December 25, 1989, to March 26, 1991. It was during this time in prison that Allin began feeling re-energized about his life and \\"mission\\". He wrote The GG Allin Manifesto during this period. Hated documentary and final days After his release from prison, Allin skipped parole to go on another tour, footage of which was shot for Todd Phillips's documentary Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies. The film contained graphic scenes from a performance Allin gave at the rock club Space at Chase in Manhattan's East Village. A heavily intoxicated Allin stripped naked, defecated on the floor, wiped his feces on himself and threw feces into the audience. He also threw beer bottles, breaking a woman's nose, and assaulted several other people in the crowd. Clips were included from other Allin appearances, as well as interviews with Allin, his band, and their fans. The film was released in 1994 and later followed on DVD in 1997. In 1991, GG recorded an album entitled Murder Junkies, released by New Rose Records, featuring Antiseen as his backing band. This album contained 10 musical tracks and 10 spoken-word pieces. Other than Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies, Allin considered this album to be that which most accurately captured his persona and stated philosophy on life. It was also during this period that Allin recorded the album War in My Head ‚Äì I'm Your Enemy, released on Awareness Records and featuring the band Shrinkwrap. This particular album consists of one 45-minute track that is a collage of spoken-word pieces which Shrinkwrap put to music. Allin's growing notoriety led to appearances on various television shows: Geraldo, The Jerry Springer Show and The Jane Whitney Show. At the time of his death, Allin was making plans for a spoken-word album. He also mentioned a somewhat unlikely European tour, enthusiastically talking about it in the hours before his death. Personal life=Family and relationships GG Allin married Sandra Farrow on October 6, 1978.Jesus Christ Allin page: \\"GG Allin's Partial Arrest Record on His Death Report.\\" They divorced in 1985. In the mid-1980s, Allin became involved with a teenage girl from Garland, Texas named Tracy Deneault. She became pregnant, and their daughter, Nico Ann Deneault, was born March 13, 1986. Nico chose to distance herself from her family.interview with Arleta on The Best of the Murder Junkies DVD Allin and Tracey Deneault never married. At the time of his death, GG Allin's \\"girlfriend\\" was Liz Mankowski. Mankowski was 17 when they met. They met when they appeared together (alongside Mankowski's sister and father) on The Jerry Springer Show. They also appeared together on The Jane Whitney Show, in 1993, with another Allin fan called Wendy. GG Allin's older brother Merle Allin served as bassist for his last band, the Murder Junkies. Beliefs Allin was an extreme individualist, misanthrope, and anti-authoritarian, promoting lawlessness and violence against police officers in many of his lyrics; his essay, The GG Allin Manifesto, was intended to summarize his personal philosophy. He revealed on Geraldo that he believed his body to be a temple of rock and roll, and that his flesh, blood, and bodily fluids were a communion to the people. Another reason given for his onstage antics (by Dino, the drummer of his band) was that he wanted to draw a parallel between his actions and \\"a society that's going crazy with violence\\". He has also said that if he was not a performer, he would probably be a serial killer or a mass murderer. Regarding Allin's views on death, he believed in some form of an afterlife. He planned to kill himself onstage on Halloween many times in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but was stopped due to prison sentences around every Halloween each year. He explained his views on death in the film Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies, stating: \\"It's like I've got this wild soul that just wants to get out of this life. It's too confined in this life. I think that to take yourself out at your peak... if you could die at your peak, your strongest point, then your soul will be that much stronger in the next existence.\\" Death GG Allin's grave in Littleton, New Hampshire GG Allin's last show was on June 27, 1993, at a small club called The Gas Station, a punk venue located inside a former gas station at 194 East 2nd Street in Manhattan. During the second song, the venue cut the power, after which he trashed the club, walked across the street naked, and then continued on, now wearing shorts, but still covered in blood and feces, through the neighborhood, followed by a large group of fans. After walking the streets for almost an hour, Allin eventually went to his friend Johnny Puke's apartment. There, he and others continued to party and use drugs. Sometime during the evening, Allin ingested large amounts of heroin, on which he accidentally overdosed and slipped into an unconscious state. Sometime in the early morning of June 28, Allin died from the effects of his heroin overdose. Later that morning, someone noticed that Allin still lay motionless in the same place where they had left him and called for an ambulance. Allin was pronounced dead at the scene. He was two months short of his 37th birthday. Funeral Allin's funeral took place on July 3, 1993, in his native New Hampshire, at the St. Rose Cemetery, Littleton. At his funeral, Allin's bloated, unpreserved corpse was dressed in his black leather jacket and trademark jock strap. GG was buried with a bottle of Jim Beam beside him in his casket, as requested (openly stated in his self-penned acoustic country ballad, \\"When I Die\\"). As part of his brother's request, the mortician was instructed not to wash the corpse or apply any makeup. Allin's funeral became a low-level party. Friends posed with his corpse, placing drugs and whiskey into his mouth. As the funeral ended, his brother put a pair of headphones on Allin. The headphones were plugged into a portable cassette player, in which was loaded a copy of The Suicide Sessions. Legacy Video footage of the soundcheck, concert, and aftermath from Allin's final concert on the day of his death was appended to the 1997 DVD release of Hated. GG Allin's grave was frequently vandalized with urine, feces, cigarette butts, and alcohol by fans,Littleton Courier, June 18, 2009 an act that was greatly discouraged by GG's mother Arleta. His tombstone has since been removed because of this. Hank Williams III's 2008 album Damn Right, Rebel Proud features the song \\"P.F.F.\\", which features the line \\"This song is written and dedicated for GG Allin\\" spoken at the beginning. On December 13, 2018, Showtime premiered the 2017 documentary GG Allin: All in the Family which documented Allin's life, career and death and how his brother and mother were coping with his death 20 years later. According to Merle Allin's Facebook page, Arleta Allin (Gunther) died on August 7, 2019.

Early years Ned Lagin was born in New York City and raised on Long Island in Roslyn Heights, New York. Growing up, Lagin was influenced by classical and jazz music, and the modern music and art cultures of New York City in the 1960s. He started photography with a Kodak Baby Brownie Special at the age of five, and piano lessons and science, natural history, and electronic projects at the age of six. He attended the Wheatley School in Old Westbury, New York, was awarded two National Science Foundation Scholarships, and attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with the intention of becoming an astronaut. Lagin received a degree in molecular biology and humanities from MIT in 1971, where he studied with John Harbison, Gregory Tucker, David Epstein, Noam Chomsky, Gian-Carlo Rota, Salvador Luria, and Jerome Lettvin. Chomsky's generative grammar concepts inspired Lagin's thinking about creating generative music forms (1968), and Lettvin connected him to the writings of Norbert Wiener and Warren McCulloch, and more generally to cybernetics. While at MIT, Lagin also completed jazz coursework at the Berklee School of Music. He was deeply influenced by the jazz world in New York City, particularly pianist Bill Evans,Relix, Volume 18, No.3, page 31 (\\"Summer Issue\\"): Ned Lagin ‚Äì An Interview with Nick Skidmore who he met in Boston and saw perform many times in New York and Boston in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, Evans wrote out some of his tunes for Lagin. His piano teachers included Dean Earl, a Charlie Parker sideman, and he studied jazz improvisation with Lee Konitz. He played piano in the MIT Concert Jazz Band and MIT Jazz Quintet\\"Collegiate Jazz Festival 1969\\" program, Notre Dame Collegiate Jazz Festival, March 14 and 15, 1969, University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana led by Herb Pomeroy, a sideman with Duke Ellington and Stan Getz. In the autumn of 1971, Lagin began graduate study in composition as an Irving Fine Fellow at Brandeis University, where he studied with Josh Rifkin and Seymour Shifrin. He completed a symphony, a string quartet, jazz big band pieces, and electronic pieces before dropping out and permanently relocating to the Bay Area.Douglas Kahn, \\"Between a Bach and a Bard Place: Productive Constraint in Early Computer Arts\\" in MediaArtHistories, edited by Oliver Grau, The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2010. pg. 441. \\"Seastones\\" album description from Rykodisc online catalog Performing with the Grateful Dead In early 1970, Lagin initiated a correspondence with Jerry Garcia after seeing the Grateful Dead at the Boston Tea Party in 1969. In May 1970, he helped facilitate a concert and free live outdoor performance featuring the band at MIT that coincided with the Kent State shootings. That summer, Lagin, at Garcia's invitation, visited San Francisco and contributed piano to \\"Candyman\\" during the American Beauty album sessions, played in several jams, and started what would become close friendships with Garcia, bassist Phil Lesh, and David Crosby. From 1970 to 1975, Lagin sat in on Hammond B3 organ, electric piano, and clavichord during long instrumental passages at several Grateful Dead concerts.August 14‚Äì15, 1971 Berkeley Community Theater, Berkeley, CA‚ÄîNed Lagin His first performances with the Grateful Dead were on November 5 and November 8, 1970 at the Capitol Theater in Port Chester, New York; his first complete concert was at Boston University's Sargent Gym on November 21, 1970.The Deadhead's Taping Compendium, Volume I: An In-Depth Guide to the Music of the Grateful Dead on Tape, 1959‚Äì1974 ‚Äì by Michael M.

During many 1974 Grateful Dead concerts over several tours, including Europe, he performed a middle set of electronic music, including parts of his composition Seastones, on computer-controlled analog synthesizers with Phil Lesh on electronically processed bass. Some sets included Jerry Garcia playing guitar filtered through effects processors and Bill Kreutzmann on drums; these sets occasionally segued into the final Grateful Dead set, with Lagin performing with the Dead, including an appearance in The Grateful Dead Movie. During the 1974 tours, he played through the vocal system of the Wall of Sound PA, in quad, with 9600 watts going through over two hundred speakers. The March 17, 1975 cancelled Grateful Dead studio session became a Seastones session with Crosby and included \\"Ned's Birthday Jam.\\"Blues For Allah entry in The Compleat Grateful Dead Discography http://tcgdd.freeyellow.com .

Photography and art Self Portrait, 2010 Lagin began photography at the age of five, first with a Baby Brownie camera, and subsequently with other small format cameras. From childhood and continuing through to the beginning of college, photography was for him part of being an amateur naturalist and scientist. Beginning in 1978, and continuing for the next 40 years, Lagin's primary media for creativity has been photography and art. First in small, medium (6x6cm, 6x7cm), and large (4x5) format film photography (using 1928 and 1950's Speed Graphic cameras), and subsequently using film scanners and Photoshop (1992), and digital cameras (2003). His photography and art influences include Ansel Adams, Elliot Porter, Walker Evans, Edward Weston, Life magazine and The World We Live In, and National Geographic. Lagin's images, as single photographs and paintings, and in compositions of multiple images, include nature, landscapes, sand drawings, nudes, erotica, and self-portraits. His creation of sand drawings and multi-image forms to create \\"fields of meaning(s)\\" was influenced by the rock art and imagery (petroglyphs, pictographs) of Native Americans, Australian Aboriginals, and prehistoric Europeans. Lagin's photographic, sand drawing, and painting collections and artist's books, spanning 1981‚Äì2017, include: Our Love, Metaphysics, Light in the Silence, Artifacts of Desire, Reflections of Solitude, and Light Time Geographies. Additionally, Lagin has written a collection of writings titled Notes about art, metaphysics, natural history, photography, pictures and \\"the natural history of picture world\\". From his Notes: \\"when you look at a picture the picture looks at you\\" Cat Dreams Completed in 2016, Cat Dreams is Ned Lagin's first music CD, and first public music, since 1975.

The sender's intention is generally to use up as much of the recipient's fax ink, toner, or thermal paper as possible, thus costing the recipient money, as well as denying the recipient use of their own machine (similar to computer-based denial of service attacks). This is made easier because fax transmission protocols compress the solid black image very well, so a very short fax call can produce many pages. Black faxes have been used to harass large institutions or government departments, to retaliate against the senders of junk faxes, or merely as simple pranks. The basic principle of a black fax can be extended to form a black fax attack. In this case, one or more sheets are fed halfway through the sender's fax machine and taped end to end, forming an endless loop that cycles through the machine. Not only can solid black be used, but also images which will repeat endlessly on the receiver's machine until its toner runs out. The introduction of computer-based facsimile systems (combined with integrated document imaging solutions) at major corporations now means that black faxes are unlikely to cause problems for them. On the other hand, the ability of computer modems to send faxes offers new avenues for abuse. A program could be used to generate hundreds of pages of highly compressed, pure black ‚Äì or huge volumes of relevant-looking, original, non-repeating high- black-density junk, just as effective but far more difficult to counteract ‚Äì and send them very quickly to the target fax machine. Black faxes and fax loops are similar (in both intention and implementation) to lace cards.

The 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade was tasked to cross the Ghent Canal about five kilometers south of Bruges at the small village of Oostkamp in early September 1944. Directly across the canal from Oostkamp was another small village named Moerbrugge. The canal is about 20 metres wide and very deep. Opposition was not expected so only one battalion was chosen for the crossing: the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's), the Argylls. Two batteries of the 15th Field Regiment, RCA were placed in support but due to the rapid advance of the allied armies, supply lines were hundreds of miles long and not much ammunition was available for the guns. As a result, no preparatory fire was laid on. Fire would be provided on an \\"as required\\" basis. The South Alberta Regiment (SARs) would place its tanks on the friendly side of the canal at either side of the crossing point and hold the flanks of the crossing with their fire along with the Vickers machine guns of The New Brunswick Rangers. The 3-inch mortars of the Argylls and the 4.2-inch mortars of the Rangers were in support but as low on ammunition as the artillery. Finally, \\"A\\" Company of the Argylls, the Argyll scout platoon and one squadron of the SARs were moved to a point north of the crossing along the canal to provide a diversion and to test German defences in that area. At that time, the Argyll Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Dave Stewart, was away from the unit which was left under command of the Deputy Commanding Officer, Major B. Stockloser. Major Stockloser ordered \\"B\\", \\"C\\", and \\"D\\" companies to cross the canal but had not arranged for assault boats, stating that the operation would be \\"a crossing of opportunity\\". Crossing At 15:30 on 8 September 1944, the three assault companies moved to Oostkamp. Luckily, the \\"opportunity\\" to which Major Stockloser had alluded came about in the form of two civilian boats which were discovered by Major Mackenzie, Officer Commanding \\"D\\" Company. These boats would eventually ferry all three companies across the canal. Some boats sank during the crossing and heavily laden soldiers were drowned. At 17:30, \\"D\\" Company started to cross and soon the Germans responded with 88 mm and mortar fire. Casualties started to mount even before the companies reached the other side. In two hours, \\"C\\" Coy would drop in strength from 63 men to just 46. By midnight, all three companies were across and holding a narrow bridgehead on the far side. Major Mackenzie was wounded and \\"D\\" Company was driven back to the canal by German counter- attacks. \\"C\\" Company was cut off from the \\"B\\" and \\"D\\" Companies by German infiltration. The day ended with 5 Argylls killed and 26 wounded. Moerbrugge - Monument Moerbrugge - South Alberta Regiment Moerbrugge - Names of Canadian soldiers Holding action The 9 September 1944 would see The Lincoln and Welland Regiment cross the canal and take up a position on the right flank of the Argylls. The situation would remain serious throughout the day, with several German counter-attacks launched against the bridgehead. \\"C\\" Company was in a particularly difficult position being cut off from the other companies. In addition, their radios failed leaving them out of contact with all support. However, the company hung on and repulsed all counter-attacks. Company Sergeant Major George Mitchell deserves much credit for holding the defence together. He personally led a party that brought up much needed supplies and ammunition. After the battle, he would be awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. Lance Corporal Lorne A. Webb and Private Arthur Bridge held their position in an upstairs window and returned fire with their Bren gun despite German machine gun and 20 mm cannon fire directed at them, some of which passed through the window opening but missed hitting them. As ammunition ran low, the riflemen loaded their remaining rounds into Bren magazines and kept feeding them to the Bren gunners. At one point, Webb inflicted 15 to 20 casualties on the attacking Germans in the matter of a few minutes. Three heavy counter-attacks on \\"C\\" Company were driven off with extremely heavy losses visited upon the Germans. However, one Argyll platoon was overrun by sheer weight of numbers and the platoon commander killed. Because of the incessant German shelling and mortaring of the crossing site, the engineers found it impossible to construct a Bailey bridge so supplies and ammunition had to be ferried across the canal in boats. Slowly, more artillery ammunition was finding its way forward to the Canadian guns and supporting fire increased. The SARs and New Brunswick Rangers continued to hold the flanks of the assault force. At 14:00, \\"A\\" Company and the Scout Platoon were recalled from their diversionary task and moved to a supporting position on the friendly side of the crossing. It was feared that the bridgehead might collapse and the six Argyll and Lincoln and Welland companies in Moerbrugge might have to be evacuated. At 15:00, Lieutenant Colonel Stewart returned to the unit. The brigade commander placed him in charge of the crossing with the Lincoln and Welland under command. He immediately set about reorganising the positions on the bridgehead. At 19:00, the Germans blanketed both sides of the crossing with a hail storm of mortar fire as a prelude to their final counter- attack. However, their attempt was thwarted and the counter-attack was beaten back. Due to the fire, the engineers had to halt bridge construction yet again. However, by midnight, Canadian counter battery fire finally suppressed the German shelling of the bridge site. The Argylls lost 7 killed, 22 wounded and 12 captured during the day. By the morning of the 10 September 1944, the engineers finally completed the bridge. SAR tanks moved across and established contact with the cut off \\"C\\" Company. About 150 German prisoners were sent back over the new bridge. Aftermath An estimated 700 Germans were killed, wounded or captured during the Moerbrugge battle. Twenty of their 20 mm FLAK (anti aircraft) cannons were captured along with six 81 mm mortars. German shelling and mortaring would continue sporadically all day but ownership of the crossing site was no longer an issue. One Argyll died and two were wounded on the 10th.

Early years Dobbs was born in Queen City, Missouri, where his father was a worker in a coal company garage. The family moved to Minneapolis, and he graduated from North High School (Minneapolis, Minnesota) in 1925. In 1926, he left for North Dakota to find work, but returned the following fall. At this point, young Farrell Dobbs was a conservative Republican, and supported Herbert Hoover for president in 1928. Moves leftward, connects with Teamsters However, his political viewpoint was changed during the Great Depression in the 1930s. Seeing the plight of workers in that situation (including himself), he became politically radicalized to the left. In 1933, while working for the Pittsburgh Coal Company in Minneapolis, Dobbs joined the Teamsters. After getting to know the three Trotskyist Dunne brothers, (Miles, Vincent and Grant Dunne) and Swedish socialist Carl Skoglund, he joined the Communist League of America. Dobbs was one of the initiators of a general strike in Minneapolis, and for a while worked full-time as a union organizer. He was influential in the Teamsters' shift from emphasis on local delivery work to over-the-road traffic, which keyed their great expansion towards becoming the largest union in the United States.The Kennedys: An American Drama, by Peter Collier (political author) and David Horowitz, Summit Books, 1984, New York, , p. 221 Dobbs quit in 1939 to work for the new Socialist Workers Party (SWP). Dobbs met the Russian revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky when he visited Mexico shortly before Trotsky's death in 1940. Mentors Hoffa Dobbs served as mentor and advisor to a young Jimmy Hoffa, while Hoffa was making his rise within the Teamsters, eventually becoming its president in 1957. Dobbs primarily inspired Hoffa with his view that the capitalist system was a Darwinian struggle, where power, rather than morality, was the primary factor determining the eventual outcome.The Kennedys: An American Drama, by Peter Collier (political author) and David Horowitz, Summit Books, 1984, New York, , p. 221 Jailed under Smith Act For opposing World War II, he and other leaders of the SWP and the Minneapolis Teamsters were convicted of violating the Smith Act, which made it illegal to \\"conspire to advocate the violent overthrow of the United States Government.\\" He served over a year in Federal Correctional Institution, Sandstone, from 1944 to 1945. Presidential candidate, supports Fidel Castro After his release, he became the editor of the SWP's newspaper, The Militant. From 1948 to 1960 he was the SWP's candidate for President of the United States, running in four elections. He succeeded James P. Cannon as national secretary of the party in 1953, serving until 1972. In 1960, Farrell Dobbs and Joseph Hansen, Trotsky's former secretary in Mexico, went to Cuba to experience the revolutionary movement there. The two American Trotskyists decided to fully support the Cuban Revolution and the leadership of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Later life Farrell Dobbs retired in 1972, but remained in the party until his death in 1983. He devoted the later part of his life to historical documentation of the American leftist movement and the Minnesota Teamsters.

Corporate power and organization  Luis Suarez- Villa, in his 2009 book Technocapitalism: A Critical Perspective on Technological Innovation and Corporatism argues that it is a new version of capitalism that generates new forms of corporate organization designed to exploit intangibles such as creativity and new knowledge.Luis Suarez-Villa, Technocapitalism: A Critical Perspective on Technological Innovation and Corporatism (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2009). The new organizations, which he refers to as experimentalist organizations are deeply grounded in technological research, as opposed to manufacturing and services production. They are also heavily dependent on the corporate appropriation of research outcomes as intellectual property. This approach is further developed by Suarez-Villa in his 2012 book Globalization and Technocapitalism: The Political Economy of Corporate Power and Technological Domination, in which he relates the emergence of technocapitalism to globalization and to the growing power of technocapitalist corporations.Luis Suarez-Villa, Globalization and Technocapitalism: The Political Economy of Corporate Power and Technological Domination (London: Ashgate, 2012). Taking into account the new relations of power introduced by the corporations that control technocapitalism, he considers new forms of accumulation involving intangibles‚Äîsuch as creativity and new knowledge‚Äîalong with intellectual property and technological infrastructure. This perspective on globalization‚Äîand the effect of technocapitalism and its corporations‚Äîalso takes into account the growing global importance of intangibles, the inequalities created between nations at the vanguard of technocapitalism and those that are not, the increasing importance of brain-drain flows between nations, and the rise of what he refers to as a techno-military-corporate complex that is rapidly replacing the old military-industrial complex of the second half of the 20th century. The concept behind technocapitalism is part of a line of thought that relates science and technology to the evolution of capitalism. At the core of this idea of the evolution of capitalism is that science and technology are not divorced from society‚Äîor that they exist in a vacuum, or in a separate reality of their own‚Äîout of reach of social action and human decision. Science and technology are part of society, and they are subject to the priorities of capitalism as much as any other human endeavor, if not more so. Prominent scientists in the early 20th century, such as John Bernal, posited that science has a social function, and cannot be seen as something apart from society.John D. Bernal, The Social Function of Science (New York: Macmillan, 1939). Other scientists at that time, such as John Haldane, related science to social philosophy, and showed how critical approaches to social analysis are very relevant to science, and to our understanding of the need for science.John B. S. Haldane, Dialectical Materialism and Modern Science (London: Labour Monthly, 1942). In our time, this line of thought has encouraged philosophers such as Andrew Feenberg to adopt and apply a critical theory approach to technology and science, providing many important insights on how scientific and technological decisions‚Äîand their outcomes‚Äîare shaped by society, and by capitalism and its institutions.Andrew Feenberg, Critical Theory of Technology (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991). The term technocapitalism has been used by one author to denote aspects and ideas that diverge sharply from those explained above. Dinesh D'Souza, writing about Silicon Valley in an article, used the term to describe the corporate environment and venture capital relationships in a high tech-oriented local economy. His approach to the topic was consonant with that of business journals and the corporate management literature. Some newspaper articles have also used the term occasionally and in a very general sense, to denote the importance of advanced technologies in the economy.  Forms of tech capitalism  Tech capitalism can take many forms such as: IP based financing where patents and registered IP of new technology is an instrument for building capitalism. Debt based equity where new and innovative technology is used as the security interest for securing financing or leasing.

Depending upon the manufacturer (or country), the scale ranges from 1‚à∂148 to 1‚à∂160. In all cases, the gauge (the distance between the rails) is . The term N gauge refers to the track dimensions, but in the United Kingdom in particular British N gauge refers to a 1‚à∂148 scale with 1‚à∂160 () track gauge modelling. The terms N scale and N gauge are often inaccurately used interchangeably, as scale is defined as ratio or proportion of the model, and gauge only as a distance between rails. The scale 1‚à∂148 defines the rail-to-rail gauge equal to 9 mm exactly (at the cost of scale exactness), so when calculating the rail or track use 1‚à∂160 and for engines and car wheel base use 1‚à∂148. All rails are spaced 9 mm apart but the height can differ. Rail height (in thousandths of an inch) is expressed as a \\"code\\": thus, Code 55 rails are high while Code 80 rails have a height of . Common real railroad rails are at least tall and can be taller on some roads, so at true scale the rails would be about high. Many older N-scale models may not run well on Code 55 track as their flanges are often unrealistically large, causing the wheels to bounce along the ties instead of ride along the railhead. Wheelsets with these large flanges are colloquially known as 'pizza cutters' due to a resemblance to the kitchen utensil. An advantage of N scale is that it allows hobbyists to build layouts that take up less space than HO scale, or put longer track runs into the same amount of space, because the models are smaller (by nearly a half) than they are in HO scale (1‚à∂87). While N scale is quite small, it is not the smallest commercially available scale, as Z scale is smaller yet at 1‚à∂220 and T scale is 1‚à∂450 or 1‚à∂480. N scale is considered generally compatible with 1‚à∂144 scale for miniature wargaming.  History  Kato model of SBB Re 460 electric locomotive, featuring the ubiquitous Arnold \\"Rapido\\" coupler SW-8 switcher. Although trains and accessories of similar gauge or scale existed as early as 1927, modern commercially produced N-scale models were first launched by the Arnold company of Nuremberg in 1962. Unlike other scales and gauges, which were de facto standards at best, within two years N-scale manufacturers defined the gauge and voltage, as well as the height and type of couplers. For example, Arnold developed the now ubiquitous \\"Rapido\\" coupler to provide a simple and robust releasable coupler design. Although the original Arnold coupler has been joined by more functional and aesthetically pleasing designs, Arnold allowed use of the Rapido design by other manufacturers, so established a common standard to couple together rolling stock from different sources. N scale has a large worldwide following. Models are made of very many standard gauge prototypes from every continent. N scale's popularity is second only to that of HO. In Japan, where space in homes is more limited, N scale is the most popular scale, and HO scale is considered large. Not all modellers select N because they have small spaces; some use N scale to build more complex or more visually expansive models. N scale in Australia has become more popular over the years. Modellers use mainly US, British, and European prototypes because for a long time, the Australian market had no N-scale models of local prototype. The creation of local prototypes is now a flourishing \\"cottage\\" industry, making Australia N-scale modelling more popular each year. N-gauge track and components are also used with larger scales, in particular H0e (or \\"HOe\\") and 00-9 scale for modelling narrow gauge railways. N-scale models on Z-scale track are used to model metre gauge (Nn3). A small amount of 2-foot (Nn2) industrial narrow-gauge modelling in N scale using custom track is done, but suppliers of parts are few. Nn18 layouts use T-scale track and mechanisms to represent minimum gauge railways. N-scale trains and structures are often used on HO or larger layouts to create forced perspective, or the illusion that an object is further away than it actually is.  Standards  A collection of N scale buildings and scenery A British model (made by PECO) of an LMS 4-6-0 'Jubilee' steam locomotive Photo of section of N scale layout with track and a human hand shown for size comparison Close-up of N gauge Southern Pacific GS-4 #4432 by Con-cor Standards useful to both manufacturers and modellers are maintained by MOROP in Europe and the NMRA in North America. These standards are generally the same for such elements as track gauge, scale ratio, couplings, and electrical power, and differ for clearances and other factors that are specific to the prototype being modelled. The wheel and track standards are, however, slightly incompatible and most vendors follow neither standard in part because of this. N scale locomotives are powered by DC motors which accept a maximum of 12 V DC. In traditional DC control, the speed of the train is determined by the amount of voltage supplied to the rails. The direction of the train is determined by the polarity of the power to the rails. Since the end of the 20th century, an increasing number of enthusiasts have started using digital train control systems to determine the speed and direction of their trains. This has in part been made possible by surface mount technology and new motors that draw very little current (typically 0.2 amps). The most popular digital control systems used in N scale model railways are NMRA-DCC and Selectrix. The initial agreed-to standard coupling was known as a 'Rapido' coupler from the manufacturer (Arnold); this coupler had been produced under a license from TT-manufacturer Rokal. Most companies developed their own variants of this coupler to avoid Arnold patents on the spring system. Graham Farish initially adopted a plastic flexible U rather than a spring, Peco used a compatible weighted coupler system (Elsie), and Fleischmann cunningly sidestepped the problem by using a sprung plate. All were compatible, though. The Rapido coupler system works well, but is difficult to use for automatic uncoupling and also relatively large. In the US, Canada, and Australia, it has been largely superseded by a more realistic- looking magnetic knuckle coupler, originally made by Micro-Trains and branded Magne-Matic. The MT couplers (as they are known) are more delicate and closer to scale North American appearance than Rapido couplers. Also, they can be opened by a magnet placed under the track. Other manufacturers, such as Atlas, McHenry and Kato, are now making couplers that mate with Micro Trains couplers. European modellers have the option to convert the couplings on their rolling stock to the Fleischmann Profi-Coupler system for more reliable operation should they wish to do so, but most N scale rolling stock continues to be manufactured with Rapido couplers - a design which is fairly robust and easy to mold. Modern N scale stock uses a standard NEM socket for couplers which allows different coupling designs to be used by simply pulling out the old coupler and fitting a new one of a different design. In the UK, vendors are increasingly shipping both NEM sockets for couplers and buckeye (knuckle) couplers. It is also very easy to use for coupling and uncoupling.  Variants  thumb NS DH2 in 1‚à∂160 scale (bottom) and Kato Bernina Express in 1‚à∂150 scale (top) on 9 mm track gauge. Size comparison with a one-euro coin. In the United States and Europe, models of standard gauge [] trains are built to 1‚à∂160 scale and made so that they run on N gauge track, but in some other countries changes are made. Finescale modellers also use variants of normal N scale.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, a scale of 1‚à∂148 is used for commercially produced models. In Japan, a scale of 1‚à∂150 is used for the models of and in gauge trains, while a scale of 1‚à∂160 is used for models of standard gauge Shinkansen (Bullet Train, excluding Mini-shinkansen) models. In the U.S. and Europe, a scale of 1‚à∂160 is used for models of trains, irrespective of the gauge of the real trains from which they are scaled. All of these scales run on the same track gauge (N gauge). This means the track is a little too narrow for 1‚à∂148/1‚à∂150 but the difference is usually considered too small to matter. Strict 2 mm fine scale modellers use slightly wider and usually hand-built track. In Britain, some N scale models are built to \\"2 mm scale\\" for \\"2 mm to the foot\\" which calculates to a 1‚à∂152 proportion. Early N scale was also known as \\"OOO\\" or \\"Treble-O\\" in reference to O and OO and was also 1‚à∂152, though for an entirely different reason.  2 mm to the foot scale  A number of modellers in the United Kingdom use 2 mm scale, a closer-to-scale standard than N scale. 2 mm scale is scaled at 2 mm to the foot (1‚à∂152) with a track gauge. Nearer to scale appearance is achieved by finer rail, flange, and crossing dimensions than commercial N gauge () components. A variation of the 2 mm standards is used by the FiNe group for 1‚à∂160 scale. It uses the same rail, flange, and crossing dimensions as 2 mm (1‚à∂152) standards, but with a track gauge of , and corresponding reduction in back-to-back. FiNe is dominated by European modellers.  OOO models  In 1961, Lone Star introduced some of the very first (1‚à∂160) N scale models branded as Treble-0-Lectric (OOO) into the United Kingdom.As an aside on the perennial question of whether British '00' gauges use letters or numbers, Lone Star named their product the 'Treble-0-Lectric' (with a zero) yet described this as gauge 'OOO', with three letters. The original die-cast metal models were push along and gauged to run on a die-cast trackwork having a gauge that was closer to . Coupling was by a simple loop and pin arrangement. The novelty of the \\"Lone Star Locos\\" line was such that they even found their way to the United States and were sold in the toys area of major department stores like J.J. Newberry. Electrified models followed soon after. The track gauge was widened to a nominal and rails were isolated with nonconductive ties (sleepers) for DC operation. Gearing between the motor and the axles at such a small scale was done by rubber bands, rather than the usual worm gear. A different coupling based on a shrunken OO scale coupling was fitted. The OOO couplings and specifications have long since been replaced by commercial N scale manufacturers.  Australian N scale  Australian railways use several gauges across the states, although in most cases 9 mm gauge track is used. Some modellers have used Z gauge track for Nn3 models of Queensland Railways. N scale modelling in Australia has been a cottage-industry affair, with typically small runs of resin-based models being produced. Some etch- brass kits have also been released. In most cases, the kits have been bodies designed to run on mechanisms or bogies available from overseas. Some very fine models are starting to emerge from various Australian manufacturers with many kits now available. Manufacturers have started to engage Chinese manufacturers to produce very high quality wagons and locomotives. The Victorian producer Aust-N-Rail pioneered this approach, while in 2011, BadgerBits released Australia's first ready-to-run N gauge locomotive, a 48 class retailing for around A$240. A new manufacturer has arrived on the scene (November 2011) with Australia-N Railways using both Australian locally manufactured detail accessories and top end Chinese factories to produce their new locomotives and rolling stock. Other kits continue to be released using the more usual method of resin-based castings and it is now possible obtain models of railways running in most states, although the coverage is highly variable.  Japanese N scale  A 1‚à∂150 scale model of a Japanese railroad diorama Since the former Japanese National Railway and other major private railways adopted a track gauge of , major Japanese N-scale models adopted 1‚à∂150 with 9 mm gauge. But, in the case of Shinkansen, which adopted a track gauge, models are scaled down to 1‚à∂160. A small number of modelers adopted a model scale of 1‚à∂120 using 9 mm gauge tracks to represent the narrow gauge railway gauge lines common in Japan. This is a different prototype gauge and scale to standard N scale with the narrower prototype gauge and called TT- gauge.  Notable layouts  N gauge track *German Wolfgang Frey started to build an N scale layout of the Stuttgart main railway station in 1978. Thirty years later, the project grew to more than . Mr Frey's \\"Stuttgart Hbf\\" layout is an exact replica of the Stuttgart main railway station with its related railyards in the 1970s. The layout is based on extensive background research of the prototype. The layout is computer controlled by 27 PCs running software developed by the owner of the layout and features very detailed and prototypical signalling systems. The layout was kept private until his untimely death in October 2012, but in 2017 should be opened as a public exhibition. * One of the largest N scale layouts in the world is located at the San Diego Model Railroad Museum. Pacific Desert Lines is a layout featuring hand-laid code 40 rail. Each piece of rail is (forty thousandths) high and is manually affixed to the roadbed by solder to copper-clad ties placed every 5th tie. About (scale miles, actually ) of mainline track are on this massive layout, as well as over 500 hand-made turnouts. Many models of local San Diego structures can be identified on the layout, including an intricate scale model of San Diego's Santa Fe Depot, the Western Metal Supply Building, the Carrizo Gorge's Goat Canyon Trestle, Palomar Observatory, the American Agar building, and the Carlsbad, California flower fields and power plant. The model of the Santa Fe depot was constructed using the actual building's blueprints and has been featured on the cover of Model Railroader magazine. The Spanish revival architecture is reproduced using epoxy castings of scale model adobe roof tiles. The Western Metal Supply Building (now part of the left field foul line in the San Diego Padres' Petco Park) was constructed using historic photographs and contains brick castings, brass- etched fire escapes, and computer-generated window panes. The detail on the Goat Canyon Trestle includes the prototype's railings, catwalks, and fire suppression system. The power plant contains fibre-optic strobe lights in its chimney. Many buildings have detailed interiors, right down to the napkin dispenser and placemats on the tables at the corner cafe. Some surfers appear in the water off the coast. The layout can be operated by manual or computer control. Trains can run completely unattended or a single operator can control the layout with the click of a mouse. *In the United States, a landmark N scale project layout, the Clinchfield, was built in 1978 by the late Gordon Odegard and featured in a series of articles for Model Railroader magazine. The article series was also reprinted in the book Modelling the Clinchfield in N Scale by Kalmbach Publishing. The Clinchfield layout measured and was noteworthy for a number of reasons: 1) it was highly portable because of its modular construction, 2) it showed the potential of high scenery to track ratios possible in 1‚à∂160, 3) it used a unique aluminum frame and (at the time revolutionary) styrofoam construction to cut down on weight and 4) it was highly prototypical for the era. The Clinchfield layout is one of the most famous American N scale layouts ever constructed and was awarded as the grand prize in a 1984 sweepstakes. The layout was also displayed at a number of train shows and has traded ownership several times by private collectors. The prototype Clinchfield Railroad was an operating and holding company for the Carolina, Clinchfield and Ohio Railway. The layout has been refurbished, outfitted for DCC, and was shown at the 2008 N Scale Collectors National Convention in Louisville, KY. *Also in the United States, a massive N scale semipublic layout, named East Valley Lines, is in Los Angeles, California. It is maintained by a semipublic special club and is part of Griffith Park.

In 2012, Nasum reunited with Rotten Sound frontman Keijo Niinimaa taking the place of Talarczyk, for a one-off tour to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary. Biography Nasum was formed in 1992 by Anders Jakobson (guitar) and Rickard Alriksson (drums/vocals), two former members of the band Necrony. The record label of Necrony offered Nasum a slot on a split 7\\". After Mieszko Talarczyk joined the band as a guitarist in 1993, the band was featured on Blind World split EP with Agathocles. After several more splits, Nasum released an MCD (mini compact disc) of their own with Poserslaughter Records in 1995. As the band started touring, Alriksson departed from Nasum. Guitarist Jakobson moved into the drummer's position and Talarczyk handled guitars and vocals. More EPs and splits followed over 1996 and 1997; and in 1998 Nasum released their first full-length album, Inhale/Exhale, on Relapse Records. As the band expanded their audience and touring, they recruited a full-time bassist, Jesper Liver√∂d (from Burst) in early 1999. The second album, Human 2.0, was released in April 2000 and followed by two years of touring and performing in support of the work, including a stop in Japan. The third album, Helvete, was released in 2003, featured Napalm Death's Shane Embury, was well received, and led to even more high-profile appearances, especially on the European festival circuit.Shane Embury and Barney Greenaway of Napalm Death both cite hearing Nasum, and Inhale/Exhale in particular, as a definite turning point which helped them to rediscover grindcore and thus led to the recording of 2000's acclaimed Enemy of the Music Business.(Terrorizer No. 140, Spring 2005) At that time, Nasum were joined by second guitarist Urban Skytt and bassist Jon Lindqvist, who replaced the departing member Liver√∂d. In 2004, Nasum released Shift and continued with touring. Talarczyk went on vacation to Thailand shortly before the December 26, 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. His death was officially confirmed on February 17, 2005, and Nasum disbanded. A compilation, Grind Finale was released in 2006 and a live album featuring a 2004 show from Osaka, entitled Doombringer, was released in early 2008. In October 2011, Nasum announced a special one-off tour to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary the following year. Filling in for late singer Talarczyk was Rotten Sound frontman Keijo Niinimaa. Anders Jakobson has since stated that Nasum will never reunite again.

A ZUI is a type of graphical user interface (GUI). Information elements appear directly on an infinite virtual desktop (usually created using vector graphics), instead of in windows. Users can pan across the virtual surface in two dimensions and zoom into objects of interest. For example, as you zoom into a text object it may be represented as a small dot, then a thumbnail of a page of text, then a full-sized page and finally a magnified view of the page. ZUIs use zooming as the main metaphor for browsing through hyperlinked or multivariate information. Objects present inside a zoomed page can in turn be zoomed themselves to reveal further detail, allowing for recursive nesting and an arbitrary level of zoom. When the level of detail present in the resized object is changed to fit the relevant information into the current size, instead of being a proportional view of the whole object, it's called semantic zooming. Some consider the ZUI paradigm as a flexible and realistic successor to the traditional windowing GUI, being a Post-WIMP interface.  History  Ivan Sutherland presented the first program for zooming through and creating graphical structures with constraints and instancing, on a CRT in his Sketchpad program in 1962.Sketchpad: A man-machine graphical communication system A more general interface was done by the Architecture Machine Group in the 1970s at MIT. Hand tracking, touchscreen, joystick and voice control was employed to control an infinite plane of projects, documents, contacts, video and interactive programs. One of the instances of this project was called Spatial Dataland.Dataland: the MIT's '70s media room concept that influenced the Mac Another GUI environment of the 70's which used the zooming idea was Smalltalk at Xerox Parc, which had infinite \\"desktops\\" (only later coined as such by Apple Computer), that could be zoomed in upon from a birds eye view after the user had recognized a miniature of the window setup for the project. The longest running effort to create a ZUI has been the Pad++ project started by Ken Perlin, Jim Hollan, and Ben Bederson at New York University and continued at the University of New Mexico under Hollan's direction. After Pad++, Bederson developed Jazz, then Piccolo,Piccolo (formerly Jazz): ZUI toolkit for Java and C# (no longer actively maintained) and now Piccolo2DPiccolo2D: Piccolo's successor. at the University of Maryland, College Park, which is maintained in Java and C#. More recent ZUI efforts include Archy by the late Jef Raskin, ZVTM developed at INRIA (which uses the Sigma lens technique), and the simple ZUI of the Squeak Smalltalk programming environment and language. The term ZUI itself was coined by Franklin Servan-Schreiber and Tom Grauman while they worked together at the Sony Research Laboratories. They were developing the first Zooming User Interface library based on Java 1.0, in partnership with Prof. Ben Bederson, University of New Mexico, and Prof. Ken Perlin, New York University. GeoPhoenix, a Cambridge, MA, startup associated with the MIT Media Lab, founded by Julian Orbanes, Adriana Guzman, Max Riesenhuber, released the first mass-marketed commercial Zoomspace in 2002-3 on the Sony CLI√â PDA handheld, with Ken Miura of Sony In 2006, Hillcrest Labs introduced the HoME television navigation system, the first graphical, zooming interface for television.Popular Mechanics 2007. Retrieved November 11, 2011. Glen Derene. Wii 2.0: Loop remote lets you click by gesture. In 2007, Microsoft's Live Labs has released a zooming UI for web browsing called Microsoft Live Labs Deepfish for the Windows Mobile 5 platform. Apple's iPhone (premiered June 2007) uses a stylized form of ZUI, in which panning and zooming are performed through a touch interface. A more fully realised ZUI is present in the iOS home screen (as of iOS 7), with zooming from the homescreen into folders and finally in to apps. The photo app zooms out from a single photo to moments, to collections, to years. And similarly in the calendar app with day, month and year views.https://www.apple.com/ios/ios7/ It is not a full ZUI implementation since these operations are applied to bounded spaces (such as web pages or photos) and have a limited range of zooming and panning. Franklin Servan-Schreiber founded Zoomorama, based on work he did at the Sony Research Laboratories in the mid-nineties. The Zooming Browser for Collage of High Resolution Images was released in Alpha in October 2007. Zoomorama's browser is all Flash based. Development of this project was stopped in 2010, but many examples are still available on the site. In 2017, bigpictu.re offers an infinite notepad (infinite both in panning and zooming) as a web- application based on one of the first ZUI open-source libraries.bigpicture.js, a library that allows infinite panning and infinite zooming 2015. bigpicture.js Also, Zircle UI offers an Open Source UI Library that uses zoomable navigation and circular shapes. https://zircleui.github.io/zircleUI/.

A professor of Divinity, he started his career as a Privatdozent for church history and homiletics at the University of Dorpat (in what is today Tartu, Estonia) in 1843, he was further appointed university preacher in 1847. Since 1848 he held an ordinary chair (tenure) as professor for practical and systematic theology. Between 1853 and 1866 Harnack was professor at Frederick Alexander University (merged in the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg since 1961) in Erlangen, Bavaria, German Confederation (now Germany). Harnack was a staunch Lutheran and a prolific writer on theological subjects; his chief field of work was practical theology, and his important book on that subject summing up his long experience and teaching appeared at Erlangen (1877‚Äì1878, 2 vols.). The liturgy of the then Lutheran church in Russia has, since 1898, been based on his Liturgische Formulare (1872). His twin sons were the German theologian Adolf von Harnack (1851‚Äì1930) and mathematician Carl Gustav Axel Harnack (1851‚Äì1888). His other two sons were also successful scientists, with the pharmacology and physiological chemistry professor Erich Harnack (1853‚Äì1914) and the history of literature professor Otto Harnack (1857‚Äì1914), father of Arvid Harnack and Falk Harnack.

It is based on an idea by Trent Reznor, founder of industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, and is a companion piece to the 1992 Nine Inch Nails EP Broken. The film features songs from Broken and is essentially a compilation of its music videos (the exception being \\"Last\\" and the two hidden tracks). The movie, roughly 20 minutes in length, weaves the album's four music videos together via a violent \\"snuff film\\" framing sequence, concluding with an otherwise unreleased video for the EP's final song \\"Gave Up\\" to set the conclusion of the film's frame story to the song. Due to its extremely graphic content, Broken was never officially released, but was leaked as a bootleg which became heavily traded on VHS in the 1990s and more recently online. Reznor said that Broken makes the music video for \\"Happiness in Slavery\\", one of the tracks on the album, \\"look like a Disney movie\\". While Reznor's comments about the film have been cryptic at best, he makes no secret of its existence, and the entire uncensored film is available to view when accessed by a hidden link on the discography page of the official Nine Inch Nails website. Plot The final scene of \\"Happiness in Slavery\\". The torture machine can be seen in the center, with Trent Reznor near the far wall The film begins with a scene of a person being executed by hanging. The trap door opens and the person drops with a serene smile on his face. The movie then cuts to footage of an amateur video taken from inside a car going through various parts of a city, as the backwards \\"n\\" from the Broken album cover and the title \\"broken\\" is shown, superimposed as a glass overlay. The car goes from the middle-class suburbs to, literally, the other side of the tracks into a shoddy industrial area. A brief shot of a \\"Meat District\\" sign is shown. The car approaches a young man on the sidewalk. Almost immediately, he is suddenly seen in a basement, tied with a seatbelt to a chair and cleave-gagged while being forced to watch a television. The music video for \\"Pinion\\" begins to play. It begins in a bathroom. The camera zooms in on a toilet flushing, and a network of pipes is shown leading to a contraption with a large gear system and a pressure gauge on it. As the camera zooms out, a tight plastic bodybag-like suit suspended in a padded cell with six rods by the side is shown, with the end of the pipes attached to the mouth portion with water gushing in, presumably to drown the person inside. An alternative interpretation is that the person bound inside is being fed the \\"waste of the world\\" coming through the pipes. Cutting back to the amateur video, the killer, wearing some sort of leather mask, drags the victim's head back and forces him to drink some sort of liquid from a jerrycan. The middle of the music video for \\"Wish\\" is again interrupted by amateur footage, showing the victim chained to a table with a large wad of a dark substance on his face. As the killer is then seen putting his pants on, it is usually assumed that the substance is feces. After the video ends, the killer repeatedly rewinds to the part of the music video where Trent Reznor screams \\"fist fuck!\\" and begins to rub his fist. The video for \\"Help Me I Am in Hell\\" shows a middle-age bald man in a room filled with flies. He ignores them while eating some sort of steak and drinking wine, despite the fact that the flies enter his mouth while he eats. The video cuts away several times to show the same man in bondage gear. This video was blacked out in the most prominent leak, and is now generally believed (although not proven) to be part of the complete film, but was blacked out by Reznor in the bootlegged copy. Reznor later admitted to distributing different copies of Broken to his friends, each with a different part of the video blacked out so that he would be able to identify the culprit if it were to be leaked. Following the music video, the victim is shown still tied to a table as the killer proceeds to rip his teeth out. The video for \\"Happiness in Slavery\\", which was banned by music video channels worldwide, begins. The most widely known part of the movie, it features performance artist Bob Flanagan stripping off his clothes and settling down on a machine that tortures, rapes, and kills him before grinding him up to fertilize a patch of soil beneath the machine. The film ends with the music video for \\"Gave Up\\", which is a different video from the one on Closure as it is not an actual Nine Inch Nails video but rather the band's music dubbed over the storyline of the movie. At this point, the victim is suspended from the ceiling and is repeatedly attacked by the perpetrator, first with a blade and then a blowtorch, after which the killer slices off the victim's penis with a straight razor. The camera work closely resembles that of an amateur snuff film, while there is interspersed footage of police searching through the basement and finding remains of previous victims. At one point, a sign saying \\"TRESPASSERS WILL BE EATEN\\" is shown. Finally, the film cuts back to the victim strapped on a table, as the murderer hacks his limbs off with a chainsaw, rapes him, and slices his chest open to eat his heart. The film then cuts back to the execution scene, again showing the killer being dropped through the trap door with a smile on his face. He falls through an immensely long tunnel until the rope suddenly tightens. The film ends with the inverted version of the Broken album cover, with the background black and a mirrored \\"n\\" character filled with the original orange background. After 30 seconds of no audio and a black screen, the severed head of the killer flies across the screen. In versions of the film labeled as \\"techno-necrophilia\\", it is followed by a segment of Robert \\"Budd\\" Dwyer's real-life televised suicide. This does not appear on the \\"leaked\\" DVD version, and it is possible that it was merely added by a third party while the tape was circulating. Cast and crew Much of the cast, aside from Bob Flanagan in \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" and the band itself in \\"Wish\\", is unknown. The film and the \\"Wish\\" video was directed by industrial music pioneer Peter Christopherson of the band Throbbing Gristle and co-founder of Industrial Records, although the other music videos were directed by various other people: \\"Pinion\\" and \\"Help Me I Am in Hell\\" is credited to Eric Goode and Serge Becker, while \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" is credited to Jon Reiss. Production Broken was created as a companion piece to the EP of the same name after Reznor wanted to create an art project based on the EP with Christopherson, who intended the piece to be \\"a comment on the existence of snuff movies and people's obsession with them\\". At the time, however, Reznor was recording in the house where the Tate murders were committed; seeing the video made him uneasy, so the project was shelved, though not before Reznor circulated a few copies on VHS. Christopherson himself has expressed regret in the film's eventual popularity: while he intended the film to be obviously fake, the degradation in quality as the tapes got copied over and over have made the distinction and his \\"pretty obvious clues\\" harder and harder to spot. Availability The film has not been given an official commercial release because Reznor wanted to stop it from overshadowing the prominence of the music, thus adding to its mythological status in alternative culture. The original hand-dubbed tapes were distributed by Reznor to various friends with technological glitches implemented at certain points, in order to let him know who leaked any copies that might surface. Reznor, commenting in the \\"Access\\" section of the Nine Inch Nails website in 2007, implied that Gibby Haynes was responsible for the most prominent leak. This copy was traded on VHS tapes for years (resulting in many poor-quality, high-generation copies), and was later encoded in MPEG and AVI formats and distributed extensively through peer-to-peer networks and Nine Inch Nails fan websites. These are generally not of the highest quality, as they are not first-generation copies. The music videos (without the interstitial footage between songs) for \\"Pinion\\", \\"Wish\\", \\"Help Me I Am in Hell\\", and \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" were made officially available on Closure and on the official Nine Inch Nails website. On Fixed (the 1992 remix CD for the Broken EP), remixers employed a heavily processed sample of Flanagan's screaming from the \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" video as part of the rhythm in the tracks \\"Screaming Slave\\" and a remix of the \\"Happiness in Slavery\\" song (although the sample is very obscure on the latter). On the Collected DVD that was sent out in promotion of the album With Teeth in 2005, portions of the movie are shown for a few seconds in crystal-clear quality. In August 2005, a new copy of the movie was distributed via BitTorrent as a remastered DVD image. The remaster, titled \\"Broken 2.0\\", was primarily sourced from a low- generation copy of the tape that was anonymously sent to a long-time member of the online fan community; however, much of the music video content was replaced with higher-resolution footage sourced from the VHS release of Closure. Like all of the copies that existed online prior to that point, this version does not have video footage during \\"Help Me I Am in Hell\\", but a blank screen instead. Menu screens, a chapter index, and the option to listen to the audio tracks from the CD without added sound effects are all distinct features of \\"Broken 2.0\\". On December 30, 2006, an unofficial version of the film was released on a DVD disc image and distributed via The Pirate Bay by the same anonymous user called \\"seed0\\", who had uploaded the leaked DVD version of Closure. The DVD image represents a significant upgrade in visual and audio quality from \\"Broken 2.0.\\" and includes the oft-missing video for \\"Help Me I Am in Hell\\". Fans have speculated that this version of the film has been sourced directly from the master tapes, and that Reznor himself may have been the source of this leak along with the Closure DVD leak, as implied by a post on his official blog on December 21, 2006, which said: \\"Happy Holidays! This one is a guilt-free download. (shhhh - I didn't say that out loud). If you know what I'm talking about, cool.\\" On May 6, 2013, the entire video was made available for streaming on Vimeo via Nine Inch Nails' Tumblr page. It was removed by Vimeo almost immediately, and the Tumblr post was updated with an allusion to The Pirate Bay. In July 2014, the full video returned to Vimeo, but was once again deleted. As of January 2020, the entire uncensored film is currently available to view when accessed by a hidden link on the discography page of the official Nine Inch Nails website.

It is the oldest extant neighborhood in the city. The current boundaries of the district include I-75 to the north, the Lodge Freeway to the east, Bagley and Porter streets to the south, and Rosa Parks Boulevard (12th Street) to the west. The neighborhood was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Corktown Historic District is largely residential, although some commercial properties along Michigan Avenue are included in the district.Corktown Historic District, National Park Service, retrieved 8/6/09 The residential section is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is designated as a City of Detroit Historic District. The neighborhood contains many newer homes and retains some original Irish businesses. History The Great Famine of Ireland of the 1840s resulted in extensive Irish migration to the United States and Canada. By the middle of the 19th century, they were the largest ethnic group settling in Detroit. Many of these newcomers settled on the west side of the city; they were primarily from County Cork, and thus the neighborhood came to be known as Corktown. By the early 1850s, half of the population of the 8th Ward (which contained Corktown) were of Irish descent. Historically, the neighborhood was roughly bounded by Third Street to the east, Grand River Avenue to the north, 12th Street to the west, and Jefferson Avenue/Detroit River to the south. By the Civil War, German immigrants had begun making inroads into the Corktown neighborhood.Armando Delicato, Julie Demery, Detroit's Corktown, Arcadia Publishing, 2007, Many immigrants had come from German provinces after the revolutions of 1848. By the turn of the century, the original Irish population had diffused through the city, and new immigrants, notably Mexican and Maltese, moved into this older housing. As the century progressed, migrants from the American South and Appalachia, both black and white, were lured by the jobs in the automobile industry and also went to the city. By the middle of the 20th century, the area of Corktown was reduced through urban renewal schemes, the building of light industrial facilities, and the creation of the Lodge Freeway and Fisher Freeway. Revitalization Tiger Stadium was in Corktown at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Trumbull Street until its demolition in 2009. The UIS Irish Plaza is a park and memorial dedicated to honoring Metro Detroit's Irish immigrant community and their descendants. Corktown has seen a number of revitalization projects since 2005. These include the United Irish Societies Irish Plaza, dedicated in 2006; the 66,000-square-foot Quicken Loans Technology Center, opened in 2015;\\"Construction Underway On New Quicken Loans Technology Center\\"Dan Gilbert unveils new Quicken Loans computer center, Detroit Free Press, 30 June 2015 and the Detroit Police Athletic League (PAL) headquarters, and youth sports facility at the old Tiger Stadium site at Michigan and Trumbull Avenues, developed in 2016. Opposite the PAL facility, a $37-million mixed-use development, The Corner, with 111 apartments, and 34 townhomes for sale, broke ground in early 2018. Also in 2016, the new Trumbull & Porter boutique hotel opened after a $10 million renovation; and in 2017, Soave Enterprises broke ground on Elton Park, a multi-phase, multi-year $150 million, 420 apartment mixed-used development. Ford Corktown Campus thumbBuilt in 1913, the historic Michigan Central Station served passenger traffic until 1988, after which it was abandoned. It was purchased by Ford Motor Company in May 2018. It is undergoing a significant four-year renovation for mixed-use development. A major redevelopment push in the area was started by the Ford Motor Company, which began development on an urban campus in Corktown in 2017 with its purchase, renovation and occupation of The Factory building at Michigan Ave. and Rosa Parks Blvd. Ford later bought other parcels of land in Corktown, including the Michigan Central Station and the adjacent Roosevelt Warehouse. Ford plans a new $740 million Corktown campus, including 1.2 million square feet of mixed-use development spread over the Michigan Central Station, Roosevelt Warehouse, the Factory building at 1907 Michigan Avenue, and build a new mixed-use 290,000-square-foot, four-story building on the vacant brass factory building site, known as \\"The Alchemy\\", at 2051 Rosa Park Blvd. Ford also announced plans to build two new parking structures. The focus of the Corktown campus will be on autonomous vehicles and electric vehicles. Ford expects to move 2,500 of its employees to the campus with space for an additional 2,500 entrepreneurs, technology companies and partners related to Ford's expansion into Autos 2.0. Ford is also seeking $104 million in tax breaks from the city as part of a $250 million incentive package over 34 years.  Architecture  The original buildings in Corktown are Federal-style detached homes and rowhouses built by Irish settlers. A worker's row house circa 1840 is located on Sixth Street and is one of the oldest existing structures in the city of Detroit. In later years, modestly sized Victorian townhouses with Italianate, Gothic, and Queen Anne elements were constructed in the district. Education Residents are zoned to Detroit Public Schools.

The island is 5 km long, 3 km wide and is located approximately 7 nautical miles north of Heraklion. Administratively, Dia is part of the community of Elia within the municipal unit of Gouves, Hersonissos municipality in Heraklion. In the south coast of Dia there are four coves, which are (from west to east) Agios Georgios, Kapari, Panagia (Madonna) and Agrielia. One more cove, that of Aginara, is to the east. History The island was formerly known as Standia, by juncture loss in the phrase œÉœÑŒÆŒΩ ŒîŒØŒ± (Greek for on Dia). It was the principal port of Crete for centuries.T.A.B. Spratt, Travels and Researches in Crete, 1:35 (1865) Its four south coves have been used as anchorages since the Minoan period. Mythology The islet looks like a giant lizard when viewed from the city of Heraklion. Greek mythology tells of a giant lizard that tried to destroy the island of Crete, however, Zeus turned it into stone with a thunderbolt, thus creating the island. The island is visible from Crete's capital city of Heraklion, as it would have been in the time of the Minoans, from Knossos. Because of this, it was sometimes identified as the island that Theseus escaped to after killing the Minotaur. Ecosystem On Dia there are a number of protected wildlife species including the snail Albinaria retusa, the lizard Podarcis erchardii schiebeli, the wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus cnossius, and Eleonora's falcon, known as mavropetritis in Greek.O ŒºŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÄŒµœÑœÅŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ œÉœÑŒ∑ ŒîŒØŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒöœÅŒÆœÑŒ∑œÇ Greek Ornithological Organisation (Greek) Dia is part of the European Network of Nature (Natura) 2000 and is a protected hunting ground.ŒîŒØŒ∫œÑœÖŒø Natura 2000 Protected areas There are also a number of protected plants such as Carlina diae.

The population of Lorestan was estimated at 1,716,527 people in 2006. In 2014 it was placed in Region 4. Lorestan covers an area of 28,392 km2. The major cities in this province are Khorramabad, Borujerd, Dorud, Aligudarz, Kuhdasht, Azna, Aleshtar, Nurabad, and Pol-e Dokhtar.  Geography and climate  Gahar Lake, Dorud Sepiddasht Darreh-ye AnƒÅrƒÅn, Khorramabad County A general view of Oshtorankuh Fritillaria in Lorestan The name Lorestan means \\"land of the Lurs\\". In the wider sense it consists of that part of western Iran coinciding with the Ilam Province and extending for about 650 km on a northwest to southeast axis from Kermanshah to Fars, with a breadth of 150‚Äì180 km. The terrain consists chiefly of mountains, with numerous ranges, part of the Zagros chain, running northwest to southeast. The central range has many summits that almost reach the line of perpetual snow, rising to 4000 m and more. It feeds the headwaters of Iran's most important rivers, such as the Zayanderud, Jarahi, Karun, Diz, Abi, Karkheh. Between the higher ranges lie many fertile plains and low hilly, well-watered districts. The highest point of the province is the Oshtorankuh peak at 4,050 m. The low-lying areas being in the southernmost sector of the province are approximately 500 m above sea level. Oak forest covers the outer slopes, together with elm, maple, walnut, and almond trees. Lorestan region Western Luristan comprises a series of parallel fertile valleys running high in the Zagros mountains. The Pusht-i Kuh region is in the western foothills of the Kabir Kuh range. The Pish-i Kuh region lies to the east of Kabir Kuh. This area had human settlements during the Bronze Age as early as the mid‚Äì3rd millennium B.C. Climatically, the province can be divided into three parts: the mountainous regions, such as Boroujerd, Doroud, Azna, Nourabad and Alishtar experience cold winters and moderate summers. In the central region, the spring season begins from mid-February and lasts till mid May. The township of Khorramabad is in this realm. However, southern areas such as Pol- e-Dokhtar and Papi are under the influence of the warm air currents of Khuzestan, have hot summers and relatively moderate winters. Lorestan Land of Culture and Civilization The climate is generally sub-humid continental with winter precipitation, a lot of which falls as snow (K√∂ppen Csa). Because it lies on the westernmost slopes of the Zagros Mountains, annual precipitation in Lorestan is among the highest anywhere in Iran south of the Alborz Mountains. At Khorramabad, the average annual precipitation totals 530 millimetres (21 inches) of rainfall equivalent, while up to 1270 millimetres (50 inches) may fall on the highest mountains. The months June to September are usually absolutely dry, but Khorramabad can expect 4 inches of rainfall equivalent in December and January. Temperatures vary widely with the seasons and between day and night. At Khorramabad, summer temperatures typically range from a minimum of 12 ¬∞C (54 ¬∞F) to a hot maximum of 32 ¬∞C (90 ¬∞F). In winter, they range from a minimum of -2 ¬∞C (28 ¬∞F) to a chilly maximum of 8 ¬∞C (46 ¬∞F).  Administrative divisions  Lorestan includes eleven counties (shahrestans): Aligudarz County, Azna County, Borujerd County, Delfan County, Dorud County, Dowreh County, Khorramabad County, Kuhdasht County, Selseleh County, Poldokhtar County, and as of 2013 Rumeshkan County. Since the creation of the map at the left, Kuhdasht County has been divided into Rumeshkan County and a smaller Kuhdasht County. Khorramabad city Luristan  History  The ancient history of Lorestan is closely intertwined with the rest of the Ancient Near East. In the 3rd and 4th millennium BC, migrant tribes settled down in the mountainous area of the Zagros Mountains. The Kassites, an ancient people who spoke neither an Indo- European nor a Semitic language, originated in LorestƒÅn. They would control Babylonia after the fall of the Old Babylonian Empire ca. 1531 BC and until ca. 1155 BC. Parts of Luristan were invaded and settled by the Iranian Medes in the 2nd millennium BC. The Medes absorbed the indigenous inhabitants of the region, primarily the Kassites as well as the Gutians, by the time the area was conquered by the Persians in the 1st millennium BC. In February 2017, archeological discoveries related to the Achaemenid era were made in Lorestan for the first time.

Found in Lorestan, Rietberg Museum, Z√ºrich Small Luristan bronze artworks, usually dated about 1000 to 650 BC, reached the outside world from the late 1920s and are found in museums all over the world, where they are valued for their vigorous style, with many representations of animals. But actually, the beginning of this bronze-making tradition goes back to the mid‚Äì3rd millennium BC.

The earlier bronze objects were made during the Elam period. Lorestan was successfully integrated into the Achaemenid, Parthian and Sasanian empires. Parts of the region managed to stay independent during the Arab, Seljuk and Mongol invasions. According to the Encyclopaedia of Islam, the Lurs, previously open adherents of the Ahl-e-Haqq faith, revere bread and fire like the Zoroastrians. \\"Being split up into numerous tribes and sections, they migrate to their summer pastures as separate bands without overall command. In 1936, Reza Shah's army conquered them, with much bloodshed and starvation, forcing many of the survivors to settle in villages under landlords.\\" In the early 1930s, when British explorer Freya Stark visited Luristan, she reported that few Europeans had visited the area before her, partly due to its remoteness, but also because of the dangers one could expect to encounter among lawless tribespeople.Stark, Freya, The Valley of the Assassins, J. Murray, London, 1934 Soltani Mosque Boroujerd Transportation=Roads Lorestan is located on Tehran-Bandar Emam Khomeyni highway, one of the most important roads in terms of good transportation. The road connects Arak in Markazi Province to Andimeshk in northern Khuzestan via Borujerd, Khorramabad and Pol-e Dokhtar. This highway consists of roads 56 and Road 37 (Iran) with junction at Borujerd. Freeway 5 is the 2nd road for rapid transport between Tehran and Khuzestan with connections in Borujerd and Khorramabad in Lorestan. Airports Khorramabad Airport is the only active airport in Lorestan with daily flights to Tehran. The second airport is planned to be built in north of Borujerd. Railway Due to its mountainous conditions, Lorestan has one of the important railways in Iran. The Lorestan rail route is 215 km long, with 15 stations having been established. Lorestan has 133 railway tunnels. The railway follows the rivers Dez and Sezar.  People and culture  Lurish Language Map Imamzade Ibrahim tomb Ilkhanid period, in Borujerd. Luristan Soumak saddle bag, late 20th century The Lurs constitute part of the southwestern branch of the Iranian peoples, who are spread across the Iranian plateau and beyond, stretching from the Hindu Kush to central Anatolia and from the Caucasus and Central Asia to the Persian Gulf -- a region that is sometimes termed Greater Iran.Frye, Richard Nelson, Greater Iran, p.xi: \\"... Iran means all lands and peoples where Iranian languages were and are spoken, and where in the past, multi-faceted Iranian cultures existed.\\" Their language (called Luri or Lurish language) is closely related to Persian, and there are two distinct dialects. \\"Lur-e-Bozourg\\" (Greater Lur) is spoken by the Bakhtiaris, and \\"Lur-e-Kuchik\\" (Lesser Lur), spoken by the Lurs themselves. People in Borujerd speak in Borujerdi Dialect, a local Lori Persian dialect extracted from Luri. Northwest of Lorestan Province is dominated by Laki speakers. Professor Richard N. Frye wrote that \\"the Lurs and their dialects are closely related to the Persians of Fars province, and naturally belong to the southwestern branch of the Iranian peoples...\\" The overwhelming majority of Lurs are Shia Muslims, with a small minority of Yarsanis of the Laki subgroup. In Khuzestan, Lur tribes are primarily concentrated in the northern part of the province, while in Ilam they are mainly in the southern region. Before the 20th century the majority of Lurs were nomadic herders, with an urban minority residing in the city of Khorramabad. There were several attempts by the Pahlavi governments to forcibly settle the nomadic segment of the Lur population. Under Reza Shah, these campaigns tended to be unsuccessful. The last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, used less forceful methods along with economic incentives, which met with greater, though not complete, success. By the mid-1980s the vast majority of Lurs had been settled in towns and villages throughout the province or had migrated to the major urban centres. A number of nomadic Lur tribes continue to exist in the province. Among the settled urban populace the authority of tribal elders still remains a strong influence, though not as dominant as it is among the nomads. As in Bakhtiari Lurs and Kurdish societies, northern Lur women have had much greater freedoms than women in other Iranian groups.  Northern region  Golden masks excavated in Kalmakareh, dated first half of 1st millennium BC. National Museum of Iran. In the northern part of Lorestan, formerly known as Lesser Lorestan (\\"Lur-e-Kuchak\\"), live the Faylis, divided into the Pishkuh Lurs in the east and Pushtkuh Lurs in the adjoining Iraqi territory in the west. Lesser Lorestan maintained its independence under a succession of princes of the Khorshidi dynasty, known as Atabegs, from A.D. 1155 to the beginning of the 17th century. Shah Abbas I then removed the last Atabeg, Shah Verdi Khan, and entrusted the government of the province to Hossein Khan Shamlu, the chief of the rival tribe of Shamlu, with the title of Vali in exchange for that of Atabeg. The descendants of Hossein Khan retained the title as governors of the Pushtkuh Lurs, to whom only the denomination of Feili now applies.  Southern region  The southern part of the province, formerly known as Greater Lorestan (\\"Lur-e-Bozorg\\"), comprises the Bakhtiari region of the province of Khuzestan and the districts of the Mamasenni and Kuhgilu Lurs, which are in Fars province. At one time, Greater Lorestan formed an independent state under the Fazlevieh Atabegs from A.D. 1160 until 1424. Its capital, Idaj, survives as mounds and ruins at Malamir, sixty miles southeast of the city of Shushtar in Khuzestan.

Setting Chill is inspired by the works of Shelley, Stoker, and Poe, where usual foes are vampires, werewolves, mummies, ghosts, goblins, and ghouls.RPG Archive: Chill Players take on the role of envoys, members of a secret organization known as S.A.V.E. (Societas Argenti Viae Eternitata, or, The Eternal Society of the Silver Way) that tracks down and eliminates evil in the world. History The game was introduced by Pacesetter Ltd in 1984.

In 1990, Mayfair Games inc. purchased the rights, and the following year published a second edition of the game system called Chill Core Rulebook. Over the next three years, Mayfair published fourteen sourcebooks for the setting and a collection of short stories. Mayfair's game was translated into French by Oriflam in 1994. In 2012, Mayfair Games sold Chills intellectual property rights to Martin Caron and Ren√©e Dion.

Reception In the October 1984 edition of Dragon (Issue 90), Jerry Epperson had a few quibbles with various game mechanics. He questioned the economics rules that essentially gave characters access to unlimited amounts of cash. Epperson also wondered why a range stick was included, since there were no regulated combat maneuvering rules that would make use of the stick. And he found the introductory adventure included in the game was overly simplistic: \\"Terror in Warwick House is much like a guided tour of a national monument. While it portends to be a dangerous place, one gets the feeling that those who fell victim to the sinister occupants before the player characters were called to the scene were either idiots or invalids. The clues required by the characters to dispose of the evil are practically spoon-fed to the players.\\" But Epperson concluded that \\"these problems are not major flaws in the game‚Äôs design; any GM should be able to alter them with little effort. All things considered, the Chill game does just what it sets out to do. It doesn‚Äôt stall play with unwieldy rules or sub- systems, and it allows the GM to pace the storyline and preserve the intensity of a situation thanks to the game‚Äôs elegant simplicity. As an alternative to dungeon delving, superheroing, or chasing after Cthulhu, the Chill game is something you can really sink your teeth into.\\" Two reviews of Chill appeared in issues of Space Gamer. In the November-December 1984 edition (Issue No. 71), William Barton admired Chill for being less violent and less weird than other horror roleplaying games, saying, \\"Chill is a viable alternative in supernatural gaming for those who desire less gunplay than is typical in Stalking or prefer more conventional creatures than the sanity-blasting horrors of CoC.\\" In the July-August 1985 edition (Issue 75), Warren Spector thought that \\"Though superficially simpler than Call of Cthulhu, the clear leader in the horror field, Chill falls somewhat short of the mark.\\" In the January 1985 edition of White Dwarf (Issue 61), Angus McLellan gave Chill an average rating of 7 out of 10. McLellan felt the gameplay was fairly slow and lacking in scares; furthermore, Call of Cthulhu had already paved the way for horror-based role-playing games. Paul Mason reviewed Chill for Imagine magazine, and stated that \\"if you fancy a game of investigation with gothic horror overtones, and you don't much care for H P Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos, then Chill would be the game to buy.\\" In the December 1988 edition of Dragon (Issue 140), Ken Rolston reviewed two supplements published by Pacesetter just before it went out of business, Vampires and Creature Feature. Rolston had a more favourable opinion of Vampires, calling it an \\"excellent book... The graphic presentation is top-notch.\\" Rolston was particularly enthusiastic about the writing, which he called, \\"exceptional\\" and concluded, \\"I highly recommend this supplement.\\" He was less enthusiastic about Creature Feature, saying, \\"This supplement lacks the graphic quality or refined presentation of the finer Chill supplements.\\" Rolston thought the concept of allowing players to become monsters and prey on humans did have \\"an oddly redeeming appeal\\", but felt that \\"the replay value [is] negligible.\\" He gave this supplement a thumbs down, saying, \\"Creature Feature will not be of use to most GMs, but students of the hobby may find it interesting for a brief diversion or as a curiosity.\\" In the October 1992 edition of Dragon (Issue 186), Rick Swan reviewed three supplements that had been published by Mayfair Games: Apparitions Sourcebook, Lycanthropes Sourcebook, and Vampires Sourcebook. Overall, Swan thought the material was not very original: \\"The designers have hardly let their imaginations run wild; the approach draws primarily from legends and movies, meeting the expectations of conservative horror buffs but rarely exceeding them. Dracula and the Wolfman are welcome; vampiric Martians and lycanthropic cattle need not apply.\\" However, Swan found the books \\"consistently entertaining and filled with interesting material that is intelligently presented.\\" He concluded, \\"Players and referees alike should get a kick out these engaging books... I would‚Äôve liked stronger scenarios and a few more adventure hooks, but all in all, the fastidious research, evocative writing, and enthusiasm for the material makes for a winning combination. I‚Äôm looking forward to future volumes.\\" Reviews *Challenge #47 (1990) *Different Worlds #37 (Nov./Dec., 1984) *The V.I.P. of Gaming Magazine #4 (July/Aug., 1986) *White Wolf #23 (Oct./Nov., 1990) * Casus Belli #22 (Oct 1984) * Casus Belli #23 (Dec 1984) * Casus Belli #38 (June 1987) ReferencesExternal links * Chill official page on Facebook *Salt Circle Games' Chill Patreon Category:Horror role-playing games Category:Mayfair Games games Category:Pacesetter games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1984 ","title":"Chill (role-playing game)"},{"id":"433081","text":"Alex Paul Barris, (September 16, 1922 ‚Äì January 15, 2004) was an American-born Canadian television actor and writer.

In 1897, work began on a new building nearby to house the school on Renfrew Street, funded by a donation of ¬£10,000 from the Bellahouston Trust, left from the will of Moses Stevens of Bellahouston.Bellahouston Trustees mackintosh-architecture.gla.ac.uk, Retrieved 16 April 2019 The building was designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, chosen for the commission by the school's director, Francis Newbery, who oversaw a period of expansion and fast-growing reputation. The first half of the building was completed in 1899 and the second half in 1909. The School's campus has grown since that time and in 2009 an international architectural competition was held to find an architect-led design team who would develop the Campus Masterplan and design the Phase 1 building. The competition was won by New York-based Steven Holl Architects working with Glasgow-based JM Architects. The Reid Building was completed in 2014 and sits opposite the now destroyed Mackintosh Building on a site previously occupied by the Foulis, Assembly and Newbery Tower Buildings. The school has produced most of Scotland's leading contemporary artists including, since 2005, 30 per cent of Turner Prize nominees and five recent Turner Prize winners: Simon Starling in 2005, Richard Wright in 2009, Martin Boyce in 2011, Duncan Campbell in 2014 and Charlotte Prodger in 2018. The School of Architecture is highly rated by the architecture profession and the School of Design has been described by Design Week as \\"leaders in design education\\". The School is organised into five academic schools: * The Mackintosh School of Architecture * The School of Design * The School of Fine Art * The School of Simulation and Visualisation * The Innovation School GSA also has a long-established portfolio of non-degree art and design classes for children and adults delivered through GSA Open Studio. Disciplines within the five schools include fine-art photography (founded by Thomas Joshua Cooper in 1982); painting and printmaking, sculpture and environmental art, product design, product-design engineering, textile design, fashion design, silversmithing and jewellery design, interior design, communication design, interaction design, and architecture. Fires=2014 fire The fa√ßade of the Mackintosh building after the fire of 2014 The original Mackintosh building was severely damaged by fire on 23 May 2014. An initial fire service estimate was that 90 per cent of the building and 70 per cent of its contents had been saved. The fire, which began in the basement, quickly spread upwards and, although it was brought under control quite quickly, significant damage was done to the historic studios and stairways. The renowned Mackintosh library was destroyed; the archive was water damaged, but was able to be air and freeze dried. There were no casualties. The fire broke out as students were preparing for their Degree Show. Eyewitnesses said that the fire appeared to have started when a projector exploded in the basement of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh building just before 12:40 pm. Investigators later determined that the cause was not a faulty projector, but \\"a canister of expanding foam\\" used in close proximity to a hot projector, causing flammable gases to ignite. According to The Scotsman newspaper, the use of aerosol cans is against school policy. The report from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service found that the design of the building contributed greatly to the spread of the fire: \\"the number of timber lined walls and voids, and original ventilation ducts running both vertically and horizontally throughout the building\\" as well as \\"a vertical service void\\", which \\"ran the entire height of the building ‚Ä¶ [and] allowed flames, hot gases, and smoke to travel\\". Fire and smoke dampers, which are intended to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through ducts, had not been retrofitted. In addition, an intended fire suppression system for the building had not been completed. A school staff member was on hand when the blaze first ignited, but was unable to contain the fast-spreading flames. = Restoration = A careful restoration process began soon after the fire; work on restoring and recreating the Mackintosh design, including the famous library interior, started in 2016. The restoration was performed with historical accuracy, including the use of original wood species such as longleaf pine and tulipwood. 2018 fire A large fire broke out in the Mackintosh Building on 15 June 2018, causing extensive damage. Emergency services received the first call at 11:19 pm BST, and 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were dispatched to the fire. No casualties were reported. As of June 2018 the cause of the fire was not known. Alan Dunlop, visiting professor of architecture at Robert Gordon University who studied at the Mackintosh School of Architecture, was contacted by the press immediately after the fire and stated: \\"I can‚Äôt see any restoration possible for the building itself. It looks totally destroyed.\\" This point of view was not supported by the early external building surveys, which appeared to indicate that much of the exterior had survived, though extensively damaged. Drone footage enabled a clearer assessment of the extent of the interior damage, and a programme of partial dismantling was established to stabilise the portions of the facade at risk of collapse, notably the south elevation. A Glasgow City Council spokesperson said: \\"There is a consensus emerging that the intention of the building control people, HES (Historic Environment Scotland) people and the art school is to save the building... Right now, people are operating on the understanding it will be saveable.\\" It was also noted by Roger Billcliffe that \\"It has been voted Britain‚Äôs most important building several times over, and we have all of the information needed to recreate every detail, following extensive laser surveys after the first fire.\\" The first opportunity for the school administration to visit the site happened on 19 June 2018. Muriel Gray, Chair of the Board of Governors, stated: \\"This was the first opportunity for the expert team to see the building and begin what will be a long and complex process of determining the future of the Mack, but we remain optimistic. There is a huge desire to see Mackintosh‚Äôs masterpiece rise again, one which we all share. We have incredibly detailed information on the building collated over the last 4 years, and have worked with teams of talented craftspeople who were doing a tremendous job on the restoration.\\" In a subsequent statement to the BBC, Professor Tom Inns, director of the school, affirmed that \\"This building is not beyond saving. It will be saved in some form.\\" He continued to support his firm belief that the building should continue in its function as a working art school, rather than a museum. On 28 June 2018 it was announced that work was being planned to take down parts of the building that were in danger of collapse. Compensation for local residents and businesses was to be made available by the Scottish Government. The same day, Glasgow School of Art terminated its ¬£25 million restoration contract with Kier Group following the fire. In November 2018, Tom Inns wrote to the Scottish Parliament Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee suggesting that if the Mackintosh Building was to be rebuilt then an independent Mackintosh Building Trust should be established to oversee what will be one of Scotland‚Äôs biggest heritage projects over the next 5‚Äì7 years, costing in excess of ¬£100 million. Tom Inns suggested this would allow the GSA Board of Governors and Executive team to focus on the task of running one of the world‚Äôs top art schools. At the time of the fire, sprinklers had yet to be installed in the building. Components for the fire suppression system had been delivered the day before, but were weeks away from assembly and testing. Scottish Campuses=Glasgow Campus The western fa√ßade of the Mackintosh building The school has a large footprint across Glasgow: From the date of the first fire of May 2014, until September 2019 the School of Fine Art was temporarily housed in a campus at the Tontine Building, Merchant City, Glasgow. The School of Design, The Innovation School and The Mackintosh School of Architecture, along with the GSA Library are all located in and around the Garnethill area, where the Mackintosh Building sits. The Stow Building, bought from Kelvin College (hence retaining the name, Stow) - has been refurbished and fitted out. Stow opened to the general public for the first time for the 2019 degree show, and opened as a functioning academic building, housing all of the Fine Art courses, in September 2019. The School of Simulation and Visualisation (formerly the Digital Design Studio (DDS)) is based on the southside of Glasgow in The Hub, at Pacific Quay by the River Clyde. The Mackintosh Building was the heart of the campus and continued to be a functioning part of the school until the first major fire on 23 May 2014. The building housed the Fine Art Painting department, first year studios and administrative staff. It houses the Mackintosh gallery which held many different exhibitions throughout the year. The Mackintosh Gallery (also known as the Mackintosh Museum) was the only part of the Mackintosh building open to the general public; all other areas of the school were only viewable by guided tour. An exception to this rule was the Degree Show where all the studios within the Mackintosh building were opened to allow people to view the graduating year's final artworks. while the Mackintosh Building underwent restoration and the newly acquired Stow Building is refurbished.A scale model of the GSA's Mackintosh building An international architectural competition was launched in March 2009 to find the design team to prepare a campus masterplan and detailed design of the first new building phase. The winner of the competition was Steven Holl Architects, working in partnership with Glasgow's JM Architects and Arup Engineering. Work commenced in 2011 and continued until 2013. The building was structurally complete in 2013. The new building was named the Reid Building after the Director who was in post at the time of the commissioning: Dame Seona Reid, and won Building of the Year at the 2014 Architect's Journal awards ‚Äì the AJ100 Awards in May 2014, and the Award for Arts or Entertainment Structures at the IStructE's 2014 Structural Awards. Forres - Altyre Estate Campus The Innovation School also has a base in Forres, Morayshire; focusing on research-led teaching at post-graduate level. Singapore Campus Since September 2012, the GSA has delivered years 3 and 4 of its Bachelor of Arts (Hons) Programmes in Communication Design and Interior Design in Singapore, in partnership with the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), based at the Temasek Polytechnic Campus in Tampines. The programmes enable Diploma students from the Singapore Polytechnics to progress from a Diploma to a BA (Hons) degree. Students studying in Singapore benefit from the same programme of study and award as in the home institution, along with resources and equipment according to the GSA specifications. Students The GSA has been ranked in the top 10 of specialist educational institutions in The Guardian University Guide, ranking it the top specialist visual arts institution in the UK. Its degrees are validated by the University of Glasgow. Of its 1,900 students, almost 20 per cent are international, 20 per cent from the rest of the UK and approximately 20 per cent are postgraduate. The GSA is placed 8th in the 2019 QS World Rankings for Art and Design and 2nd in the nationally ranking 2016 Complete University Guide league table for Art and Design. HESA statistics show the GSA to have one of the lowest student drop-out rates in the UK. In 2002 the funding councils published figures which placed Glasgow School of Art as having the second-lowest number of students from a working-class background out of a list of UK higher education institutions. With 7 per cent of its students coming from social classes IIIm, IV and V (skilled manual, semi- skilled or un-skilled workers), the figures put it above Oxford and Cambridge in terms of exclusivity. Glasgow School of art disputed the figures, explaining that the majority of its applicants did not come through the UCAS system on which the statistics were based so the numbers involved were very small. This was reinforced by HEFCE, which said the figures should be treated with care. In March 2016, the Commission on Widening Access (CoWA) found the percentage of Scottish-domiciled full-time first degree entrants from SIMD 20 (20 per cent most deprived areas of Scotland) at the GSA was 22.2 per cent. This is the second highest in Scotland, according to CoWA's report, with only University of the West of Scotland having more.Commission on Widening Access ‚Äì Technical paper on measures and targets, p11, Annex A (14 March 2016) gov.scot, Retrieved 16 April 2019 Research The Glasgow School of Art is host to a number of high-profile research projects, funded primarily through the Arts and Humanities Research Council, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, and the Economic and Social Research Council, although other UK research councils have funded projects in the past. At the last Research Assessment Exercise in 2014, the GSA had the largest art and design research community in Scotland and with 23 per cent of research evaluated as world leading. The GSA has a number of research centres including the Digital Design Studio, Mackintosh Environmental Architectural Research Unit, Institute of Design Innovation, Centre for Advanced Textiles and the Glasgow Urban Lab Research professors include Professor Thomas Joshua Cooper, Professor Alastair Macdonald, Professor Tim Sharpe, Professor Irene McAra- McWilliam , Professor Sally Stewart, Professor Henry Rogers, Professor Johnny Rodger, Professor Christopher Platt, Professor Steve Love, Professor Paul Chapman and Professor Brian Evans.

The Earth's atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the large-scale structure of its circulation remains fairly constant. The smaller scale weather systems ‚Äì mid-latitude depressions, or tropical convective cells ‚Äì occur \\"randomly\\", and long-range weather predictions of those cannot be made beyond ten days in practice, or a month in theory (see Chaos theory and the Butterfly effect). The Earth's weather is a consequence of its illumination by the Sun, and the laws of thermodynamics. The atmospheric circulation can be viewed as a heat engine driven by the Sun's energy, and whose energy sink, ultimately, is the blackness of space. The work produced by that engine causes the motion of the masses of air and in that process, it redistributes the energy absorbed by the Earth's surface near the tropics to the latitudes nearer the poles, and thence to space. The large-scale atmospheric circulation \\"cells\\" shift polewards in warmer periods (for example, interglacials compared to glacials), but remain largely constant as they are, fundamentally, a property of the Earth's size, rotation rate, heating and atmospheric depth, all of which change little. Over very long time periods (hundreds of millions of years), a tectonic uplift can significantly alter their major elements, such as the jet stream, and plate tectonics may shift ocean currents. During the extremely hot climates of the Mesozoic, a third desert belt may have existed at the Equator. Latitudinal circulation features An idealised view of three large circulation cells showing surface winds Vertical velocity at 500 hPa, July average. Ascent (negative values) is concentrated close to the solar equator; descent (positive values) is more diffuse but also occurs mainly in the Hadley cell. The wind belts girdling the planet are organised into three cells in each hemisphere‚Äîthe Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, and the polar cell. Those cells exist in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The vast bulk of the atmospheric motion occurs in the Hadley cell. The high pressure systems acting on the Earth's surface are balanced by the low pressure systems elsewhere. As a result, there is a balance of forces acting on the Earth's surface. The horse latitudes are an area of high pressure at about 30¬∞ to 35¬∞ latitude (north or south) where winds diverge into the adjacent zones of Hadley or Ferrel cells, and which typically have light winds, sunny skies, and little precipitation.  Hadley cell  The ITCZ's band of clouds over the Eastern Pacific and the Americas as seen from space The atmospheric circulation pattern that George Hadley described was an attempt to explain the trade winds. The Hadley cell is a closed circulation loop which begins at the equator. There, moist air is warmed by the Earth's surface, decreases in density and rises. A similar air mass rising on the other side of the equator forces those rising air masses to move poleward. The rising air creates a low pressure zone near the equator. As the air moves poleward, it cools, becomes denser, and descends at about the 30th parallel, creating a high-pressure area. The descended air then travels toward the equator along the surface, replacing the air that rose from the equatorial zone, closing the loop of the Hadley cell. The poleward movement of the air in the upper part of the troposphere deviates toward the east, caused by the coriolis acceleration (a manifestation of conservation of angular momentum). At the ground level, however, the movement of the air toward the equator in the lower troposphere deviates toward the west, producing a wind from the east. The winds that flow to the west (from the east, easterly wind) at the ground level in the Hadley cell are called the Trade Winds. Though the Hadley cell is described as located at the equator, in the northern hemisphere it shifts to higher latitudes in June and July and toward lower latitudes in December and January, which is the result of the Sun's heating of the surface. The zone where the greatest heating takes place is called the \\"thermal equator\\". As the southern hemisphere summer is December to March, the movement of the thermal equator to higher southern latitudes takes place then. The Hadley system provides an example of a thermally direct circulation. The power of the Hadley system, considered as a heat engine, is estimated at 200 terawatts.  Ferrel cell  Part of the air rising at 60¬∞ latitude diverges at high altitude toward the poles and creates the polar cell. The rest moves toward the equator where it collides at 30¬∞ latitude with the high-level air of the Hadley cell. There it subsides and strengthens the high pressure ridges beneath. A large part of the energy that drives the Ferrel cell is provided by the polar and Hadley cells circulating on either side and that drag the Ferrel cell with it. The Ferrel cell, theorized by William Ferrel (1817‚Äì1891), is, therefore, a secondary circulation feature, whose existence depends upon the Hadley and polar cells on either side of it. It might be thought of as an eddy created by the Hadley and polar cells. The air of the Ferrel cell that descends at 30¬∞ latitude returns poleward at the ground level, and as it does so it deviates toward the east. In the upper atmosphere of the Ferrel cell, the air moving toward the equator deviates toward the west. Both of those deviations, as in the case of the Hadley and polar cells, are driven by conservation of angular momentum. As a result, just as the easterly Trade Winds are found below the Hadley cell, the Westerlies are found beneath the Ferrel cell. The Ferrel cell is weak, because it has neither a strong source of heat nor a strong sink, so the airflow and temperatures within it are variable. For this reason, the mid-latitudes are sometimes known as the \\"zone of mixing.\\" The Hadley and polar cells are truly closed loops, the Ferrel cell is not, and the telling point is in the Westerlies, which are more formally known as \\"the Prevailing Westerlies.\\" The easterly Trade Winds and the polar easterlies have nothing over which to prevail, as their parent circulation cells are strong enough and face few obstacles either in the form of massive terrain features or high pressure zones. The weaker Westerlies of the Ferrel cell, however, can be disrupted. The local passage of a cold front may change that in a matter of minutes, and frequently does. As a result, at the surface, winds can vary abruptly in direction. But the winds above the surface, where they are less disrupted by terrain, are essentially westerly. A low pressure zone at 60¬∞ latitude that moves toward the equator, or a high pressure zone at 30¬∞ latitude that moves poleward, will accelerate the Westerlies of the Ferrel cell. A strong high, moving polewards may bring westerly winds for days. The Ferrel system acts as a heat pump with a coefficient of performance of 12.1, consuming kinetic energy from the Hadley and polar systems at an approximate rate of 275 terawatts.  Polar cell  The polar cell is a simple system with strong convection drivers. Though cool and dry relative to equatorial air, the air masses at the 60th parallel are still sufficiently warm and moist to undergo convection and drive a thermal loop. At the 60th parallel, the air rises to the tropopause (about 8 km at this latitude) and moves poleward. As it does so, the upper-level air mass deviates toward the east. When the air reaches the polar areas, it has cooled by radiation to space and is considerably denser than the underlying air. It descends, creating a cold, dry high-pressure area. At the polar surface level, the mass of air is driven south toward the 60th parallel, replacing the air that rose there, and the polar circulation cell is complete. As the air at the surface moves toward the equator, it deviates westwards. Again, the deviations of the air masses are the result of the Coriolis effect. The air flows at the surface are called the polar easterlies, flowing from northeast to southwest near the north pole and from southeast to northwest near the south pole. The outflow of air mass from the cell creates harmonic waves in the atmosphere known as Rossby waves. These ultra-long waves determine the path of the polar jet stream, which travels within the transitional zone between the tropopause and the Ferrel cell. By acting as a heat sink, the polar cell moves the abundant heat from the equator toward the polar regions. The Hadley cell and the polar cell are similar in that they are thermally direct; in other words, they exist as a direct consequence of surface temperatures. Their thermal characteristics drive the weather in their domain. The sheer volume of energy that the Hadley cell transports, and the depth of the heat sink contained within the polar cell, ensures that transient weather phenomena not only have negligible effect on the systems as a whole, but ‚Äî except under unusual circumstances ‚Äî they do not form. The endless chain of passing highs and lows which is part of everyday life for mid-latitude dwellers, under the Ferrel cell at latitudes between 30 and 60¬∞ latitude, is unknown above the 60th and below the 30th parallels. There are some notable exceptions to this rule; over Europe, unstable weather extends to at least the 70th parallel north. The polar cell, terrain, and Katabatic winds in Antarctica can create very cold conditions at the surface, for instance the lowest temperature recorded on Earth: ‚àí89.2 ¬∞C at Vostok Station in Antarctica, measured 1983.  Longitudinal circulation features Diurnal wind change in local coastal area, also applies on the continental scale. While the Hadley, Ferrel, and polar cells (whose axes are oriented along parallels or latitudes) are the major features of global heat transport, they do not act alone. Temperature differences also drive a set of circulation cells, whose axes of circulation are longitudinally oriented. This atmospheric motion is known as zonal overturning circulation. Latitudinal circulation is a result of the highest solar radiation per unit area (solar intensity) falling on the tropics. The solar intensity decreases as the latitude increases, reaching essentially zero at the poles. Longitudinal circulation, however, is a result of the heat capacity of water, its absorptivity, and its mixing. Water absorbs more heat than does the land, but its temperature does not rise as greatly as does the land. As a result, temperature variations on land are greater than on water. The Hadley, Ferrel, and polar cells operate at the largest scale of thousands of kilometers (synoptic scale). The latitudinal circulation can also act on this scale of oceans and continents, and this effect is seasonal or even decadal. Warm air rises over the equatorial, continental, and western Pacific Ocean regions. When it reaches the tropopause, it cools and subsides in a region of relatively cooler water mass. The Pacific Ocean cell plays a particularly important role in Earth's weather. This entirely ocean-based cell comes about as the result of a marked difference in the surface temperatures of the western and eastern Pacific. Under ordinary circumstances, the western Pacific waters are warm, and the eastern waters are cool. The process begins when strong convective activity over equatorial East Asia and subsiding cool air off South America's west coast creates a wind pattern which pushes Pacific water westward and piles it up in the western Pacific. (Water levels in the western Pacific are about 60 cm higher than in the eastern Pacific.). The daily (diurnal) longitudinal effects are at the mesoscale (a horizontal range of 5 to several hundred kilometres). During the day, air warmed by the relatively hotter land rises, and as it does so it draws a cool breeze from the sea that replaces the risen air. At night, the relatively warmer water and cooler land reverses the process, and a breeze from the land, of air cooled by the land, is carried offshore by night.  Walker circulation  The Pacific cell is of such importance that it has been named the Walker circulation after Sir Gilbert Walker, an early-20th-century director of British observatories in India, who sought a means of predicting when the monsoon winds of India would fail. While he was never successful in doing so, his work led him to the discovery of a link between the periodic pressure variations in the Indian Ocean, and those between the eastern and western Pacific, which he termed the \\"Southern Oscillation\\". The movement of air in the Walker circulation affects the loops on either side. Under normal circumstances, the weather behaves as expected. But every few years, the winters become unusually warm or unusually cold, or the frequency of hurricanes increases or decreases, and the pattern sets in for an indeterminate period. The Walker Cell plays a key role in this and in the El Ni√±o phenomenon. If convective activity slows in the Western Pacific for some reason (this reason is not currently known), the climates of areas adjacent to the Western Pacific are affected. First, the upper-level westerly winds fail. This cuts off the source of returning, cool air that would normally subside at about 30¬∞ south latitude, and therefore the air returning as surface easterlies ceases. There are two consequences. Warm water ceases to surge into the eastern Pacific from the west (it was \\"piled\\" by past easterly winds) since there is no longer a surface wind to push it into the area of the west Pacific. This and the corresponding effects of the Southern Oscillation result in long-term unseasonable temperatures and precipitation patterns in North and South America, Australia, and Southeast Africa, and the disruption of ocean currents. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, fast-blowing upper level Westerlies of the Hadley cell form, which would ordinarily be blocked by the Walker circulation and unable to reach such intensities. These winds disrupt the tops of nascent hurricanes and greatly diminish the number which are able to reach full strength. = El Ni√±o ‚Äì Southern Oscillation = El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a are opposite surface temperature anomalies of the Southern Pacific, which heavily influence the weather on a large scale. In the case of El Ni√±o, warm surface water approaches the coasts of South America which results in blocking the upwelling of nutrient-rich deep water. This has serious impacts on the fish populations. In the La Ni√±a case, the convective cell over the western Pacific strengthens inordinately, resulting in colder than normal winters in North America and a more robust cyclone season in South-East Asia and Eastern Australia. There is also an increased upwelling of deep cold ocean waters and more intense uprising of surface air near South America, resulting in increasing numbers of drought occurrences, although fishermen reap benefits from the more nutrient-filled eastern Pacific waters.

Today historical dances are danced as performance, for pleasure at themed balls or dance clubs, as historical reenactment, or for musicological or historical research. Dances from the early 20th century can be recreated precisely, being within living memory and after the advent of film and video recording. Earlier dance types, however, must be reconstructed from less reliable evidence such as surviving notations and instruction manuals. For performance dancing, see History of dance. Categories=Medieval dance Very little evidence survives about medieval dance except what can be gleaned from paintings and works of literature from this time period. Some names of the dances which we know existed during the Middle Ages include Carole, Ductia, Estampie (Istampitta), Saltarello, and the Trotto. The farandole is also frequently presented as a medieval dance, based on surviving iconography. Renaissance dance The earliest surviving dance manuals come from the Renaissance period, including examples by Italian dance master and composer Fabritio Caroso and French cleric Thoinot Arbeau. Thus we are able to reconstruct the dances with a greater degree of certainty. The large number of dances with Spanish origin reflect the cultural influence of the dominating power of the age. Dance types: * Allemande (Almain) * Basse danse (Bassadance) * Branle (Bransle) * Canario * Coranto * Dompe * Galliard * La volta, variation on the Galliard * Pavane * Sarabanda * Spagnoletta * Tourdion, a fast Galliard Baroque dance It was during the baroque era that Londoner John Playford published The Dancing Master, which, along with similar publications, provides us with a large repertoire of baroque English country dances. Apart from country dances, the most well-documented baroque dance style was that which was developed at the French court during the 17th century. The term \\"baroque dance\\" is often used to refer specifically to this style, reflecting the dominating power of the era. Dance types include: * Bourr√©e * Canary * Chaconne * (French) Courante * Entr√©e grave * Forlana * Gavotte * Gigue * Loure * Menuet (minuet) * Musette * Passacaille (passacaglia) * Passepied * Rigaudon * Sarabande * Tambourin The French style was also danced in England where they introduced their own dance type: * Hornpipe  Dance during the English Regency  An era of uncertainty in England, with the Napoleonic Wars, periodic riots, and the French Revolution across the Channel. Clothing tended to be light and unrestrictive, encouraging dances with lots of skipping and jumping, such as the English Country Dance, Polonaise, Quadrille, and Scotch Reel.  Dance in the mid-19th century  Albert Hall Canberra (circa 2016) (sepia) Starting with the great international polka craze of 1844 anyone who was anyone was dancing. Women were in hoop skirts, and turning dances helped to keep them out of the way. Dances popular during this period included the polka, schottische, two-step, and the waltz.  Dance in the late 19th century to about 1910  The dances popular in mid-century were still being done at the end of the century, but by fewer people. Dance masters, in vain attempts to maintain their place in society and in the economy, invented dances of greater and greater complexity that people followed with less and less enthusiasm. During this period, the bustle replaced the hoop, which necessitated a few changes in dancing. At the same time, ragtime music began to gain mainstream respectability. Some examples of dances popular during this period include the cakewalk, Krakowiak, mazurka, racket, redowa, and the waltz.  Dance in the Ragtime era  Vernon and Irene Castle brought an air of respectability to couples dancing, and sparked what was arguably the largest U.S. dance craze ever. But by the end of World War I, these were considered old fashioned, and included the foxtrot, maxixe, one-step, tango, and waltz.  Dance in the 1920s  During the roaring twenties, for the first time, there was a class of children who did not have to work to help support the family. This was an era of highly energetic dances done by the younger generation, represented by the Black Bottom, Charleston, foxtrot, shag, and waltz.  Dance in the 1930s and 1940s  In the peak of the Swing era, more exotic dance styles became ever more popular among younger generations in America. Dances popular during this period were the Big Apple (dance), foxtrot, swing, waltz, tap, and the jitterbug.

From 1985 to 1990, she was Medical Director at the District Office for lung diseases and tuberculosis in East Berlin. Since 1990 Bergmann-Pohl has been the Patron of the General Disabled Persons in Germany (ABID eV) and since 2003 President of the Berlin Red Cross. Also since 2003 she has been a member of the Presidium of the International Federation and has been a vice president since 2007. Political career Meeting of the Volkskammer, 2 October 1990 In 1981, she joined the CDU, one of the bloc parties of the GDR, and in 1987 was elected to the district board in East Berlin. In the general election of March 1990, the only free election ever held in East Germany, she was elected to the People's Chamber, which on 5 April elected her its President. On the same day, parliament also abolished the State Council, the country's collective presidency. Under the Constitution, the president of the People's Chamber was ex officio vice president of the GDR; as such, Bergmann-Pohl became provisional head of state as well. In that role, she presided over the People's Chamber formally petitioning to join the Federal Republic of Germany on 23 August, as well as the overwhelming approval of the unification treaty on 12 September. After German reunification on 3 October 1990, she became a member of the Bundestag and, along with other leading members of the last GDR government, was also appointed Federal Minister for Special Affairs in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet. After the 1990 all-German election, she was appointed Parliamentary Secretary in the Federal Ministry for Health on 18 January 1991. Following her party's defeat in the 1998 election, she departed from the government on 27 October 1998 but remained in the Bundestag until 2002.

He served as the seventh Chief Justice of the United States from 1874 to his death in 1888. During his tenure, the Waite Court took a narrow interpretation of federal authority related to laws and amendments that were passed during the Reconstruction Era to expand the rights of freedmen and protect them from attacks by vigilante groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Born in Lyme, Connecticut, Waite established a legal practice in Toledo, Ohio after graduating from Yale University. As a member of the Whig Party, Waite won election to the Ohio Senate. An opponent of slavery, he helped establish the Ohio Republican Party. He served as a counsel in the Alabama Claims and presided over the 1873 Ohio constitutional convention. After the May 1873 death of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, President Ulysses S. Grant underwent a prolonged search for Chase's successor. With the backing of Secretary of the Interior Columbus Delano, Grant nominated Waite in January 1874. The nomination of the relatively obscure Waite was poorly received by some prominent politicians, but the Senate unanimously confirmed Waite and he took office in March 1874. Despite some support for his nomination, he declined to run for president in the 1876 election, arguing that the Supreme Court should not serve as a mere stepping stone to higher office. He served on the court until his death of pneumonia in 1888. Waite did not emerge as an important intellectual force on the Supreme Court, but he was well regarded as an administrator and conciliator. He sought a balance between federal and state power and joined with most other Justices in narrowly interpreting the Reconstruction Amendments. His majority opinion in Munn v. Illinois upheld government regulation of grain elevators and railroads and influenced constitutional understandings of government regulation. He also helped establish the legal concept of corporate personhood in the United States. However in the Civil Rights Cases109 U.S. 3 (1883) he sided with a majority to strike down the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which had prohibited discrimination in access to public services, that was not restored until the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Early life and education Morrison Remick Waite was born on November 29, 1816, at Lyme, Connecticut, the son of Henry Matson Waite, an attorney, and his wife Maria Selden. His father later was appointed as a judge of the Superior Court and associate judge of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, serving 1834‚Äì1854; and appointed as chief justice of the latter from 1854‚Äì1857. Morrison had a brother Richard, with whom he later practiced law. p.16 Waite attended Bacon Academy in Colchester, Connecticut, where one of his classmates was Lyman Trumbull. He graduated from Yale University in 1837 in a class with Samuel J. Tilden, who later was the 1876 Democratic presidential nominee. As a student at Yale, Waite became a member of the Skull and Bones and Brothers in Unity societies,* and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1837.\\"Supreme Court Justices Who Are Phi Beta Kappa Members\\" , Phi Beta Kappa website, accessed October 4, 2009 Shortly after graduating, Waite became a law clerk for his father in 1837. Soon afterward Waite moved to Maumee, Ohio, where he studied law as an apprentice in the office of Samuel L. Young. He was admitted to the bar in 1839, and went into practice with his mentor. The law firm became prominent in business and property law. p. 17 He was elected to one term as mayor of Maumee. Marriage and family He married Amelia Champlin Warner on September 21, 1840 in Hartford, Connecticut. They had three sons together: Henry Seldon, Christopher Champlin, and Edward Tinker; and a daughter Mary Frances Waite. Political and legal career In 1850, Waite and his family moved to Toledo, where he set up a branch office of his law firm with Young. Waite soon came to be recognized as a leader of the state bar. When Young retired in 1856, Waite built a prosperous new firm with his brother Richard Waite. One of his partners in Toledo was George P. Estey, a man from New Hampshire who served as a Union Army general during the American Civil War. An active member of the Whig Party, Waite was elected to a term in the Ohio Senate in 1849‚Äì1850. He made two unsuccessful bids for the United States Senate, and was offered (but declined) a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court. In the mid-1850s, because of his opposition to slavery, Waite joined the fledgling Republican Party and helped to organize it in his home state. By 1870, he was known as one of the best lawyers in Ohio. p.18 In 1871, Waite received an invitation to represent the United States (along with William M. Evarts and Caleb Cushing) as counsel before the Alabama Tribunal at Geneva. In his first national role, he gained acclaim when he won a $15 million award from the tribunal. In 1872, he was unanimously selected to preside over the Ohio 1873 constitutional convention. Supreme Court nomination Waite's Chief Justice nomination President Ulysses S. Grant nominated Waite as Chief Justice on January 19, 1874, after a political circus related to the appointment. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase died in May 1873, and Grant waited six months before first offering the seat in November to the powerful Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York, who declined. After ruling out a promotion of a sitting Associate Justice to Chief (despite much lobbying from the legal community for Justice Samuel Freeman Miller), Grant offered the Chief Justiceship to senators Oliver Morton of Indiana and Timothy Howe of Wisconsin, then to his Secretary of State, Hamilton Fish. He finally submitted his nomination of Attorney General George H. Williams to the Senate on December 1. A month later, however, Grant withdrew the nomination, at Williams' request, after charges of corruption made his confirmation all but certain to fail. One day after withdrawing Williams, Grant nominated Democrat and former Attorney General Caleb Cushing, but withdrew it after Republican Senators alleged Civil War-era connections between Cushing and the Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Finally, after persistent lobbying from Ohioans, including Interior Secretary Columbus Delano, on January 19, 1874, Grant nominated the little-known Waite. He was notified of his nomination by a telegram. The nomination was not well received in political circles. The former Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, remarked of Waite that, \\"It is a wonder that Grant did not pick up some old acquaintance, who was a stage driver or bartender, for the place,\\" and the political journal The Nation, said \\"Mr Waite stands in the front-rank of second-rank lawyers.\\" Nationwide sentiment, however, was relief that a non-divisive and competent choice had been made, and Waite was confirmed unanimously as Chief Justice on January 21, 1874, receiving his commission the same day. Waite took the oaths of office on March 4, 1874. The Waite Court, 1874‚Äì1888 Chief Justice Waite never became a significant intellectual force on the Supreme Court. But his managerial and social skill, \\"especially his good humor and sensitivity to others, helped him to maintain a remarkably harmonious and productive court.\\"Grand Concourse, The Ohio Judicial Center, Supreme Court of Ohio During Waite's tenure, the Court decided some 3,470 cases. In part, the large number of cases decided and the variety of issues confronted reflected the lack of discretion the Court had at the time in hearing appeals from lower federal and state courts. However, Waite demonstrated an ability to get his brethren to reach decisions and write opinions without delay. His own work habits and output were formidable: he drafted one-third of these opinions. In matters of regulation over economic activity, he supported broad national authority, stating his opinion that federal commerce powers must \\"keep pace with the progress of the country.\\" In the same vein, a primary theme in his opinions was the balance of federal and state authority. These opinions influenced Supreme Court jurisprudence well into the 20th century. In the cases that grew out of the American Civil War and Reconstruction, and especially in those that involved the interpretation of the Reconstruction Amendments, i.e. the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, Waite sympathized with the court's general tendency to interpret these amendments narrowly. In United States v. Cruikshank, the court struck down the Enforcement Act, ruling that the states had to be relied on to protect citizens from attack by other private citizens. > The very highest duty of the States, when they entered into the Union under > the Constitution, was to protect all persons within their boundaries in the > enjoyment of these 'unalienable rights with which they were endowed by their > Creator.' Sovereignty, for this purpose, rests alone with the States. It is > no more the duty or within the power of the United States to punish for a > conspiracy to falsely imprison or murder within a State, than it would be to > punish for false imprisonment or murder itself. He concluded that \\"We may suspect that race was the cause of the hostility but is it not so averred.\\" Thus, the court overturned the convictions of three men accused of massacring at least 105 blacks in the Colfax massacre at the Grant Parish, Louisiana, courthouse on Easter 1873. Their convictions under the Enforcement Act were thrown out not because the statutes were unconstitutional, but because the indictments under which the men were charged were infirm because they failed to allege specifically that the murders were committed on account of the victims' race. Waite believed that white moderates should set the rules of racial relations in the South. But, in reality, those states were not prepared to protect African Americans. They did not prosecute most lynchings or paramilitary attacks against blacks. The majority of the Court and the people outside the South were tired of the bitter racial strife related to Reconstruction. In the 1870s, white Democrats regained power in southern legislatures; they passed Jim Crow laws suppressing blacks as second- class citizens. After years of elections surrounded by fraud and violence to suppress black voting, from 1890‚Äì1908 (after Waite's death) all the Democrat- dominated southern state legislatures passed new constitutions or amendments that disfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites in the South. Well into the 1960s, these laws excluded those groups from the political system. Waite's social and political orientation was also apparent in the Court's response to claims by other groups. In Minor v. Happersett (1875), using the restricted definition of national citizenship and the 14th Amendment as set forth in the Slaughterhouse Cases (1873), Waite upheld the states' right to deny women the franchise. Nonetheless, Waite sympathized with the women's rights movement and supported the admission of women to the Supreme Court bar. In his opinion of Munn v. Illinois (1877), one of six Granger cases involving Populist-inspired state legislation to fix maximum rates chargeable by grain elevators and railroads, Waite wrote that when a business or private property was \\"affected with a public interest\\", it was subject to governmental regulation. Thus, the Court ruled against charges that Granger laws encroached upon private property rights without due process of law and conflicted with the Fourteenth Amendment. Later, this opinion was often regarded as a milestone in the growth of federal government regulation. In particular, New Dealers in the Franklin Roosevelt administration looked to Munn v. Illinois for guidance in interpreting due process, as well as the commerce and contract clauses. Waite concurred with the majority in the Head Money Cases (1884), the Ku-Klux Case (United States v. Harris, 1883), the Civil Rights Cases (1883), Pace v. Alabama (1883), and the Legal Tender Cases (including Juilliard v. Greenman) (1883). Among the most important opinions he personally wrote were the Enforcement Act Cases (1875), the Sinking Fund Cases (1878), the Railroad Commission Cases (1886) and the Telephone Cases (1887). In 1876, amid speculation about a third term for President Grant, who had been tainted by scandals, some Republicans turned to Waite. They believed he was a better presidential nominee for the Republican Party. However, Waite refused, announcing \\"my duty [i]s not to make it a stepping stone to someone else but to preserve its purity and make my own name as honorable as that of any of my predecessors.\\" In the aftermath of the presidential election of 1876, Waite refused to sit on the Electoral Commission that decided the electoral votes of Florida because of his close friendship of GOP presidential nominee Rutherford B. Hayes as well as being a Yale College classmate of Democratic presidential nominee Samuel J. Tilden. As Chief Justice, Waite swore in Presidents Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, Chester A. Arthur and Grover Cleveland. After suffering a breakdown, probably due to overwork, Waite refused to retire. Almost to the moment of his death, he continued to draft opinions and lead the Court. Role in corporate personhood controversy In 1885, S. W. Sanderson, who was the Chief Legal Advisor for the Southern Pacific Railroad, decided to sue Santa Clara County in California because they were trying to regulate the railroad's activity. His claim, in part, was that because a railroad was a 'person' under the constitution, local governments couldn't 'discriminate' against it by having different laws and taxes in different places. When the Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company, , came before Justice Waite in the US Supreme Court, Sanderson asserted that 'corporate persons' should be treated the same as 'natural (or human) persons.' and although the court specifically did not rule on it the court recorder John Chandler Bancroft Davis inserted the following dictum in the headnotes: > The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the > provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which forbids a > State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of > the laws, applies to these corporations. We are all of the opinion that it > does.118 U.S. 394 (1886) ‚Äì Official court Syllabus in the United States > Reports Before publication, Davis wrote a letter to Waite, dated May 26, 1886, to make sure his headnote was correct to which Waite replied: > I think your mem. in the California Railroad Tax cases expresses with > sufficient accuracy what was said before the argument began. I leave it with > you to determine whether anything need be said about it in the report > inasmuch as we avoided meeting the constitutional question in the > decision.[4] Hence this dictum in the headnote and the Waite reply changed the course of history and how corporations came to have the legal rights of a human person: Thomas Hartmann in his book Unequal Protection: The rise of corporate dominance and theft of human rights has the following to say > In these two sentences (according to the conventional wisdom), Waite > weakened the kind of democratic republic the original authors of the > Constitution had envisioned, and set the stage for the future worldwide > damage of our environmental, governmental, and cultural commons.

The disciplined and disinterested lawyer in him transcended the bounds > of the environment within which he moved and the views of the client whom he > served at the bar. Death Chief Justice Waite died unexpectedly of pneumonia in 1888. This created a stir in Washington, as there had been no hint that his illness was serious. His condition had been treated as confidential, in part to avoid alarming his wife who was in California. The Washington Post devoted its entire front page to his demise. Large crowds joined in the mourning. Except for Justices Bradley and Matthews, all the justices accompanied his body on the special train that went to Toledo, Ohio. Mrs. Waite traveled by train from California, arriving just in time for the funeral. Published reports indicated the Chief Justice would be buried in a family plot he had purchased in Forest Hill Cemetery, but he was not interred there.

For unknown reasons, his remains were interred under a monument in Woodlawn Cemetery, Plot: Section 42, by the river in Toledo, Ohio. Waite, who had financial difficulties during his service as Chief Justice, left a very small estate that was insufficient to support his widow and daughters. Members of the organized Bar in Washington and New York raised money to create two funds for the benefit of Waite's family members.Ira Brad Matetsky, \\"The Waite Funds\\", 18 Green Bag 2d 173 (Winter 2015).

Shows the river's course highlighted on a topographic map. The river is in the Great Lakes Basin and is a tributary of Lake Superior. The river's name comes from the French \\"Rivi√®re aux courants\\", referring to the river's currents. Course The Current River begins at Current Lake in Unorganized Thunder Bay District and flows northwest, then turns southeast, passing out of Ray Lake over a dam, then under Ontario Highway 527 and reaches Onion Lake. It continues southwest, passes into geographic Gorham Township, flows past the community of Stepstone, and turns southeast before entering the City of Thunder Bay. It takes in the left tributary North Current River, turns south, passes under Ontario Highway 17, then flows through Boulevard Lake and over Boulevard Lake Dam, and flows into Thunder Bay on Lake Superior. History The river's name is the English version of the name given it by early French explorers: \\"Rivi√®re aux courants\\", referring to the river's currents. In 1859 Lindsay Russell, Surveyor-General for Canada, followed the river from its mouth in Lake Superior towards its source, reporting that: :\\"Current River, having a general course of north, winds about among steep, rocky hills, which sometimes rise straight up from its edge; from the top of one of these, about 6 miles from its mouth, we could see its course for a long distance through an exceedingly rough country. It is full of rapids and falls pouring through clefts of up-heaved granite and slate. Opposite the second mile of the line it passes through slate, but higher up, granite.\\"Chronology of Development on the Current River (Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, July 2012) http://www.slideshare.net/superiorforum/a-chronology-of-development-on-the- current-river Two other sizable rivers and a creek ‚Äî the Neebing River, the McIntyre River and McVicar's Creek ‚Äî run between Current River and the Kaministiquia River to the south, but in 1858 neither of these two rivers were of sufficient interest to be identified by name. From the vantage point of Fort William, the Neebing River was referred to as \\"First River\\" and the McIntyre continued for some time to be known as \\"Second River.\\"Elizabeth Arthur, Thunder Bay District 1821-1891 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1973), 91-93. Sometimes, from the vantage point of Prince Arthur's Landing, the names were reversed, the McIntyre being the First River and the Neebing River the Second River. Early references to development along the Current River include mention of John McKenzie's acquisition of land along it in 1857, and William Petit Trowbridge's 400 acre (162 hectare) purchase of patented mineral lands at the river's mouth in 1865.\\"Andrew Russell's Statement of Mineral Lands on Lake Superior 1865,\\" in Elizabeth Arthur, Thunder Bay District 1821-1892 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1973), 105-107. About 1867 brothers Peter, John and Donald McKellar discovered silver deposits near the river, and their Thunder Bay Silver Mining Co. operated near its mouth from 1866 to 1870, when fire destroyed the buildings. The Duncan-Shuniah Mine also operated in this area from 1867 to 1881. An 1875 editorial in Prince Arthur Landing's satirical newspaper Thunderbolt mentions (facetiously) factories and mills on the Current River, but there was no industrial activity on the river until the 20th century. In 1901 a dam was built near the mouth of the river, resulting in flooding which created an artificial lake known as Boulevard Lake. The land around the lake was developed as a municipal park. Industry has continued to build at the mouth of the river‚Äîpredominantly pulp, wood and newsprint mills, along with rail and lake shipping facilities‚Äîbut numerous parklands follow it inland.

He taught chemistry at the University of British Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley. Biography Neil Bartlett was born on 15 September 1932 in Newcastle-upon- Tyne, England. Bartlett's interest in chemistry dated back to an experiment at Heaton Grammar School when he was only eleven years old, in which he prepared \\"beautiful, well-formed\\" crystals by reaction of aqueous ammonia with copper sulfate. He explored chemistry by constructing a makeshift lab in his parents' home using chemicals and glassware he purchased from a local supply store. He went on to attend King's College, University of Durham (which went on to become Newcastle University) in the United Kingdom where he obtained a Bachelor of Science (1954) and then a doctorate (1958). In 1958, Bartlett's career began upon being appointed a lecturer in chemistry at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC, Canada where he would ultimately reach the rank of full professor. During his time at the university he made his seminal discovery that noble gases were indeed reactive enough to form bonds. He remained there until 1966, when he moved to Princeton University as a professor of chemistry and a member of the research staff at Bell Laboratories. He then went on to join the chemistry department at the University of California, Berkeley in 1969 as a professor of chemistry until his retirement in 1993. He was also a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory from 1969 to 1999. In 2000, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He died on 5 August 2008 of a ruptured aortic aneurysm. He lived with his wife Christina Bartlett until his death. They had 4 children. Research Bartlett's main specialty was the chemistry of fluorine and of compounds containing fluorine. In 1962, Bartlett prepared the first noble gas compound, xenon hexafluoroplatinate, Xe+[PtF6]‚àí. This contradicted established models of the nature of valency, as it was believed that all noble gases were entirely inert to chemical combination. He subsequently produced and reproduced several other fluorides of xenon: XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6. By exploiting the solvent and basic properties of XeF6, he was able to prepare the first quinquevalent gold compound, Xe2F11+AuF6‚àí. Honors In 1968 he was awarded the Elliott Cresson Medal. In 1973, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (United Kingdom). In 1976 he received the Welch Award in Chemistry for his synthesis of chemical compounds of noble gases and the consequent opening of broad new fields of research in the inorganic chemistry. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. In 1979, he was honored as a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences. He was awarded the prestigious Davy Medal in 2002 for his discovery that the noble gases were not that noble after all. Previous recipients of the Davy Medal had included people as diverse as Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, the inventor of the Bunsen burner, and Albert Ladenburg, who suggested the existence of the compound prismane. In 2006, his research into the reactivity of noble gases was designated jointly by the American Chemical Society and the Canadian Society for Chemistry (CSC) as an International Historic Chemical Landmark at the University of British Columbia in recognition of its significance, \\"fundamental to the scientific understanding of the chemical bond.\\" Bartlett was nominated for a Nobel Prize in Chemistry every year between 1963 and 1966 but did not get the Prize.https://old.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=13013 Nobel Prize nomination database Hospitalization In January 1963, Bartlett and his graduate student, P. R. Rao, were hospitalized after an explosion in the laboratory. As they looked at what they thought might be the first crystals of XeF2, the compound exploded, getting shards of glass in the eyes of both men. According to Bartlett, he thought that the compound may have contained water molecules, and he and Rao took off their glasses to get a better look. They were both taken to the hospital for four weeks, and Bartlett was left with damaged vision in one eye. The last piece of glass from this accident was removed 27 years later.Bell, Philip.

It ran on three-rail track whose running rails were apart. Origins Lionel dubbed its new standard Standard Gauge and trademarked the name. Lionel's Standard Gauge is distinct from the standard gauge of real railroads, and the later 1:64 scale S gauge popularized by American Flyer after World War II. Due to the trademark, Lionel's competitors mostly called their similar offerings \\"wide gauge\\".Classic Toy Trains Magazine - O Gauge Trains Operating, Collecting, Forums, Lionel Trains Historians offer two alternative explanations for the creation of Standard Gauge. One is that Lionel misread the specifications for M√§rklin's European Gauge 2, measuring the distance between the inside portion of the rails rather than between the centers of the rails as M√§rklin did, thus accidentally making a slightly larger and incompatible standard. The other possibility is that the change was a deliberate effort to forestall European competition by creating incompatible trains. While many believe the latter is more likely, since several U.S. companies such as Carlisle & Finch were producing trains to that standard, no definitive proof in favor of either theory has ever surfaced. Standard Gauge production began in 1906 or 1907. A Lionel catalog exists showing Standard Gauge with a post mark that appears to indicate 1906, however most collectors feel that production did not begin until 1907, and that Lionel manufactured their 2 7/8 inch gauge line through 1906. Lionel's competitors Whatever the reason for its initial creation, Lionel's Standard Gauge caught on at the expense of gauges 1 and 2. No fewer than four American competitors adopted Lionel's gauge: Ives in 1921,http://www.ivestrains.org/webonly/about/Ives%20Manufacturing%20Company.pdf Boucher in 1922,Tinplate FAQ Part 1 Dorfan in 1924,Dorfan Trains and American Flyer in 1925.American Flyer Trains While all the manufacturers' track was the same size and the trains and buildings approximately the same scale, the couplers for the most part remained incompatible, making it impossible to mix train cars from different manufacturers without modification. The increased number of manufacturers seemed to give legitimacy to Lionel's gauge. The boom of the 1920s made large toy trains affordable and Standard Gauge had its heyday in the mid-1920s only to virtually disappear during the Great Depression. Ives filed for bankruptcy in 1928 and its offerings were off the market by 1932. American Flyer discontinued its Standard Gauge trains in 1932. Dorfan went out of business in 1934. Lionel discontinued Standard Gauge trains in 1940. Boucher, the last of the wide gauge manufacturers, folded in 1943. O gauge, was smaller, less expensive to manufacture and it required less space to operate a layout. Thus, it became the most popular scale in the United States almost by default. Decline of Standard Gauge Lionel did not introduce a new Standard Gauge piece after 1933. In 1937, there were some Lionel 500 series cars that were created with new trucks that had box couplers.http://www.train99.com/ency/mo/mo9.html This shows that Lionel invested in tooling to modernize Standard Gauge, but ultimately did not put them into production. The toy train market evolved into scale modeling. Lionel's prized 700e Hudson was cataloged in O-gauge from 1937 as their top of the line train. The larger Standard Gauge no longer symbolized top of the line Lionel. Lionel last showed Standard Gauge in their 1940 catalogs, ultimately only offering rolling stock, which suggests they were selling off existing inventory. After 1940 Standard Gauge managed to survive in South America. Doggenweiler, a firm in Chile, produced a small quantity of trains in Standard Gauge and Gauge 2 from 1933 until about 1960. Standard Gauge was revived in the United States in the 1950s by the small firm McCoy Manufacturing, who produced trains of original design well into the 1990s. In the 1970s, Williams Electric Trains began producing and marketing reproductions of Lionel trains of the 1920s and 1930s. This line was later marketed by Lionel itself, and is now produced and marketed by MTH Electric Trains. A number of smaller manufacturers, mostly one- and two-person operations, hand-build and market reproductions of very early Standard Gauge trains.

The plate states \\"Sam Livingston, Calgary's first citizen\\". Samuel Henry Harkwood (Sam) Livingston (4 February 1831 ‚Äì 4 October 1897) born in Ireland, he came to Canada following an unsuccessful venture in the Californian gold rush of 1849, and eventually found his way to Jumping Pound, North-West Territories, in 1873 where he opened a trading post. He was going to settle near the confluence of the Bow and Elbow Rivers in 1875 but, when the North-West Mounted Police arrived and established Fort Calgary, Livingston and his family moved further up the Elbow River to the current location of the Glenmore Reservoir. When the Glenmore Dam was built and the area flooded, part of the Livingston house was preserved and now stands at Heritage Park. Sam Livingston was an important man to Alberta's history. The Glenmore Reservoir gets its name from Sam too; Sam and Jane started a school on their farm that Sam named 'Glenmore School' after a place in Ireland. Glenmore is a village in County Kilkenny and quite close to his birthplace in County Wicklow. Sam Livingston married Jane Howse in 1865 and settled at Fort Victoria for a while. He also started a business which included trading for buffalo hides. By 1874 he had relocated his operations southward to be closer to the trade with the plains Indians and was doing business near the Roman Catholic mission, Our Lady of Peace, on the Elbow River. In the summer of 1876 Livingston moved with his family closer to Fort Calgary (Calgary), the newly established North-West Mounted Police post on the river. Here, in 1876, he began cultivation and with John Glenn was one of the first farmers in the area. Livingston was a great innovator who brought the first examples of mechanized equipment to farming in the Calgary area. Some people call Sam Livingston \\"Calgary's First citizen\\", but George Clift King is also given that title. In fact John Glenn was the first documented European settler in the Calgary area, in 1873. In 1872, Alexis Cardinal (Metis) had built a shack for Father Constantine Scollen. In March 1873, Scollen moved there and established the first mission to the Blackfoot Confederacy in Alberta.

This experiment was performed by Neil Bartlett at the University of British Columbia, who formulated the product as \\"Xe+[PtF6]‚àí\\", although subsequent work suggests that Bartlett's product was probably a salt mixture and did not in fact contain this specific salt. Preparation \\"Xenon hexafluoroplatinate\\" is prepared from xenon and platinum hexafluoride (PtF6) as gaseous solutions in SF6. The reactants are combined at 77 K and slowly warmed, to allow for a controlled reaction. Structure The material described originally as \\"xenon hexafluoroplatinate\\" is probably not Xe+[PtF6]‚àí. The main problem with this formulation is \\"Xe+\\", which would be a radical and would dimerize or abstract an F atom to give XeF+. Thus, Bartlett discovered that Xe undergoes chemical reactions, but the nature and purity of his initial mustard yellow product remains uncertain. Further work indicates that Bartlett's product probably contained [XeF]+[PtF5]‚àí, [XeF]+[Pt2F11]‚àí, and [Xe2F3]+[PtF6]‚àí. The title \\"compound\\" is a salt, consisting of an octahedral anionic fluoride complex of platinum and various xenon cations. It has been proposed that the platinum fluoride forms a negatively charged polymeric network with xenon or xenon fluoride cations held in its interstices. A preparation of \\"XePtF6\\" in HF solution results in a solid which has been characterized as a polymeric network associated with XeF+. This result is evidence for such a polymeric structure of xenon hexafluoroplatinate. History In 1962, Neil Bartlett discovered that a mixture of platinum hexafluoride gas and oxygen formed a red solid. The red solid turned out to be dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate, Bartlett noticed that the ionization energy for O2 (1175 kJ mol‚àí1) was very close to the ionization energy for Xe (1170 kJ mol‚àí1). He then asked his colleagues to give him some xenon \\"so that he could try out some reactions\\", whereupon he established that xenon indeed reacts with PtF6. Although, as discussed above, the product was probably a mixture of several compounds, Bartlett's work was the first proof that compounds could be prepared from a noble gas. His discovery illustrates that the finding of new chemical methods often lead initially to impure products. Since Bartlett's observation, many well-defined compounds of xenon have been reported including XeF2, XeF4, and XeF6.

Her other children included William and Giles.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography under Briouze [Braose], William (III) de The de Braoses were loyal to King Richard I but grew in power under King John of England. The dynasty was in conflict with King John towards the end of his reign and almost lost everything. Reginald de Braose was a scion of the powerful Marcher family of de Braose, helped manage its survival and was also related by marriage to the Welsh Princes of Wales.  Magna Carta  He supported his brother Giles de Braose in his rebellions against King John. Both brothers were active against the King in the Baron's War. Neither was present at the signing of Magna Carta in June 1215 because at this time they were still rebels who refused to compromise.  Restoration of royal favour  King John acquiesced to Reginald's claims to the de Braose estates in Wales in May 1216. Reginald became Lord of Brecon, Abergavenny, Builth and held other Marcher Lordships but was also very much a vassal of the Welsh leader Llewelyn Fawr, Prince of Gwynedd who had become his father-in-law in 1215 Brut y Tywysogion when Reginald married Llywelyn's daughter, Gwladus Ddu. Henry III restored Reginald to favour and the Bramber estates (confiscated by King John) in 1217.  Welsh wars  At this seeming betrayal, Rhys and Owain, Reginald's Welsh nephews who were Princes of Deheubarth, were incensed and took Builth, except the castle. Llywelyn Fawr also became angry and his forces besieged Brecon. Reginald eventually surrendered to Llewelyn and gave up Seinhenydd (Swansea). By 1221 they were at war again, with Llewelyn again laying siege to Builth. The siege was relieved by King Henry III's forces. From this time on Llewelyn tended to support the claims of Reginald's nephew John de Braose concerning the de Braose lands in Wales. Reginald was a witness to the re-issue of Magna Carta by King Henry III in 1225. He died two or three years later in 1227 or 1228 in Brecon and was succeeded by his son by his first wife, Graecia Briwere (or Brewer), daughter of William Brewer. He was buried in Brecon Priory Church (now Brecon Cathedral). Reginald and Graecia had a son, William de Braose, who was executed by Llewellyn King of Gwynedd upon being caught in the bedchamber of Joan Lady of Wales. It may be that the Matilda de Braose who was the wife of Rhys Mechyll, Prince of Deheubarth was the daughter of Reginald.

The parts, accessories, etc. for sale may not be manufactured by the OEM. According to a report by the International Trade Administration in the Department of Commerce, \\"Aftermarket parts are divided into two categories: replacement parts and accessories. Replacement parts are automotive parts built or remanufactured to replace OE parts as they become worn or damaged. Accessories are parts made for comfort, convenience, performance, safety, or customization, and are designed for add-on after the original sale of the motor vehicle.\\" The aftermarket encompasses parts for replacement, collision, appearance, and performance. The aftermarket provides a wide variety of parts of varying qualities and prices for nearly all vehicle makes and models. Consumers have the option of repairing their vehicles themselves (the \\"do-it-yourself\\" or \\"DIY\\" segment) or can take the vehicle to a professional repair facility (the \\"do-it-for me\\" or \\"DIFM\\" segment). The aftermarket helps keep vehicles on the road by providing consumers the choice of where they want their vehicles serviced, maintained, or customized. Size of the automotive aftermarket The United States automotive aftermarket is estimated to be worth $318.2 billion (2013), contributing more than 2.3% to GDP. The aftermarket employs 4.2 million people who work at manufacturers, distributors, retailers and repair shops. In the United States, online sales of aftermarket accessories have showed year over year increases over traditional brick and mortar stores. In fact, according to Hedges & Company, \\"Sales of auto parts & accessories continued to climb in 2015, and will continue the trend into 2016 to reach $7.4 billion dollars, posting around a 16% increase over 2015.\\" Singapore, which does not have a domestic automobile industry, is an especially important destination for businesses exporting automotive parts and accessories due to its high automobile turnover stemming from the peculiarities of its driving laws. (In short, car owners are legally required to get rid of their cars after ten years of use and Singapore's compensation scheme to offset the registration fee of new cars has incentivized more frequent turnover.) High automobile turnover and the preference for new parts means that the market for remanufactured and reconditioned auto parts is very small. Combined with a high demand for \\"accessories, car-care products, prestige items, and new spare parts,\\" Singapore's automotive aftermarket is large. In fact, Singapore has become a major automotive components manufacturing base, as several leading multinational corporations (MNCs) have established international procurement offices as well as their Southeast Asia distribution centers. In Canada, the automotive aftermarket is a C$19.4 billion industry that employs about 420,000 people. In Australia, the automotive aftermarket industry in 2013 was estimated to generate a AUD$5.2 billion turnover, with 21000 staff, and 1400 manufacturers. in Europe, the total volume of Independent Aftermarket (IAM) amounted to 127 billion Euros in 2015 (end-user prices without labor and tax). At that moment there were 54 parts traders with annual turnover over 100 mio Euros in Europe, 6 of them exceeded 1 billion Euros. Meeting platform for the international automotive aftermarket is the B2B trade fair Automechanika which takes place every two years in Frankfurt. At last edition the hot topics were connected cars, autonomous driving, alternative drives and the workshop of the future. Online versus brick-and-mortar aftermarket accessory vendors Among online retailers, Amazon.com and eBay Motors are the largest sellers of aftermarket parts and accessories in the U.S. by both units sold and revenue, and are expected to grow 25% in 2014, far outstripping traditional chain stores. As DIY parts sales soften at the retail counter, chain stores have pushed themselves into the DIFM commercial business, eating into distributors‚Äô and wholesalers‚Äô market share. Since 2007, DIY sales at the chain stores have fallen a total of 3% to 5%, while commercial sales have brought in a double- digit sales increase. AutoZone‚Äôs DIFM sales in 2013 alone increased over 13%. Online sales of auto parts and accessories in the United States, excluding online auctions and used parts, have been projected to pass $10 billion in 2018. Legal issues Automobile manufacturers have attempted to hinder or suppress automotive aftermarket sales by means of copyright or patent infringement litigation. For example, in British Leyland Motor Corp. v Armstrong Patents Co. in the UK, the House of Lords decided in 1986 that Leyland could not claim copyright infringement in order to prevent the aftermarket sale of replacement tailpipes to purchasers of those motor cars. Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co. is a 1961 U.S. Supreme Court case in which the Court redefined the U.S. patent law doctrine of repair and reconstruction: \\"No element, not itself separately patented, that constitutes one of the elements of a combination patent is entitled to patent monopoly, however essential it may be to the patented combination and no matter how costly or difficult replacement may be.\\"\\"Aro Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Convertible Top Co. - 377 U.S. 476\\", p. 343. In 2005 Harley-Davidson filed a patent and trademark infringement lawsuit against two aftermarket engine manufacturers producing drop-in replacements for Harley's engines, namely S&S; Cycle and Delkron, Inc. Harley accused S&S; and Delkron of copying parts for Twin Cam engines and using Harley trademarks without permission.

In 1990, he served as the only democratically elected prime minister of the German Democratic Republic, and as such was the last leader of an independent East Germany. Family background De Maizi√®re belongs to a noble family originally from Maizi√®res-l√®s-Metz who, as Huguenots, fled France for asylum in Prussia in the late 17th century; the Maizi√®re family attended French-language schools and Huguenot churches in Berlin until the beginning of the 20th century. He is a son of the lawyer Clement de Maizi√®re. His uncle Ulrich de Maizi√®re was Inspector General of the Bundeswehr (the West German Armed Forces). His cousin Thomas de Maizi√®re is a close advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel and served as the Federal Minister of the Interior from 17 December 2013 to 14 March 2018 in Merkel's third cabinet. Early life and education Lothar de Maizi√®re was born in Nordhausen, Thuringia, and attended the ancient Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster, where he was one of the last pupils before the school closed in 1958. He next studied viola at the Hanns Eisler College of Music in East Berlin from 1959 to 1965. He played in the Berlin Symphony Orchestra before going on to study law (by distance learning, through the Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin) from 1969 to 1975.Derek Lewis & Ulrike Zitzlsperger, Historical Dictionary of Contemporary Germany, Rowman & Littlefield, 18 Oct 2016 p.412 Career A longtime member of the East German Christian Democratic Union, de Maizi√®re helped oust the party's pro-Communist leadership after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He was elected the party's chairman in November. In the first‚Äîand as it turned out, only‚Äîfree election held in East Germany, de Maizi√®re was elected to the Volkskammer. One month later, he succeeded Hans Modrow as Premier and held this position from 12 April until 2 October 1990, heading the de Maizi√®re cabinet. He ran on a platform of speedy reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany (from 1949 to 1990, West Germany). As premier, de Maizi√®re signed the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany (the so-called \\"Two Plus Four Treaty\\"), which ended the four wartime allied powers' rights and responsibilities in Berlin and Germany, and which preceded German reunification. The treaty provided that it would be signed by the four allies and the two Germanies but ratified only by newly reunified Germany and the allies. In accordance with that treaty, East Germany ceased to exist on 3 October, and its territory was annexed by the Federal Republic. After German reunification, he was appointed Minister for Special Affairs in the CDU government of chancellor Helmut Kohl, until his resignation on 17 December 1990 amid rumours that he had worked for the East German Stasi (Stasi name: IM Czernihttps://www.zeit.de/1992/05/neues-von-czerni).

The work was first performed on 26 April 1899 by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the composer, in an original version which has not survived. After the premiere, Sibelius made some revisions, resulting in the version performed today. The revised version was completed in the spring and summer of 1900, and was first performed in Berlin by the Helsinki Philharmonic, conducted by Robert Kajanus on 1 July 1900. The symphony is characterized by its use of string and woodwind solos; the first movement opens with a long and discursive clarinet solo over a timpani roll; (this idea returns at the start of the fourth movement, fortissimo in the strings, with wind and brass chordal accompaniment), and subsequent movements include violin, viola, and cello solos. Most performances of the work last between 35 and 40 minutes. Many conductors choose to slacken the speeds suggested by Sibelius's metronome markings, particularly in the fast part (allegro energico) of the first movement. Because of this, many versions of the symphony are about 38‚Äì40 minutes long (the publishers suggest the duration is 40 minutesMusicSalesClassical.com's \\"suggestion\\" of the tempo). In Osmo V√§nsk√§'s recording of the work, released in 1997, the first movement is played at the metronome mark suggested by Sibelius and takes 9:42 (compared with the ‚Äì minute duration of most other recordings).

Gleaning is the act of collecting leftover crops from farmers' fields after they have been commercially harvested or on fields where it is not economically profitable to harvest. It is a practice described in the Hebrew Bible that became a legally enforced entitlement of the poor in a number of Christian kingdoms.Hussey, Stephen. \\"'The Last Survivor of an Ancient Race': The Changing Face of Essex Gleaning\\". The Agricultural History Review, vol. 45, no. 1 (1997): 61-72. . Bible According to the Book of Deuteronomy and Leviticus, farmers should leave corners of their fields unharvested (pe'ah), should not pick up that which was dropped (gleanings), and should not harvest any over-looked produce that had been forgotten when they harvested the majority of a field. On one of the two occasions that this is stated in Leviticus, it adds that in vineyards, some grapes should be left ungathered, a statement also found in Deuteronomy. These verses additionally command that olive trees should not be beaten on multiple occasions, and whatever remains from the first set of beatings should be left. According to Leviticus, these things should be left for the poor and for strangers, and Deuteronomy commands that it should be left for widows, strangers, and paternal orphans. The Book of Ruth tells of gleaning by the widow Ruth to provide for herself and her mother-in-law, Naomi, who was also a widow. Rabbinical views In classical rabbinic literature, it was argued that the biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to grain fields, orchards, and vineyards. The farmer was not permitted to benefit from the gleanings, and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions;Hullin 131aPe'ah 5:6Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, 4:11 the farmer was not even allowed to help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also argued that the law was only applicable in Canaan,Pe'ah 2:5 (Palestinian Talmud) although many classical rabbinic writers, who were based in Babylon, applied the laws there too;Hullin 134bMaimonides, Mishneh Torah, 1:14 it was also seen as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor non-Jews were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace.Gittin 59b Historic European practice Arthur Hughes. In many parts of Europe, including England and France, the Biblically-derived right to glean the fields was reserved for the poor; a right, enforceable by law, that continued in parts of Europe into modern times.Vardi, Liana. \\"Construing the Harvest: Gleaners, Farmers, and Officials in Early Modern France\\". The American Historical Review, vol. 98, no. 5 (1993): 1424-447. doi:10.2307/2167061. In 18th century England, gleaning was a legal right for \\"cottagers\\", or landless residents. In a small village the sexton would often ring a church bell at eight o'clock in the morning and again at seven in the evening to tell the gleaners when to begin and end work.L W Cowrie (1996) Dictionary of British Social History Wordsworth Reference p.130 This legal right effectively ended after the Steel v Houghton decision in 1788. Modern times Impoverished Germans gleaning in 1956 The Shulchan Aruch argues that Jewish farmers are no longer obliged to obey the biblical rule.Shulchan Aruk, Yoreh De'ah 332:1 Nevertheless, in modern Israel, rabbis of Orthodox Judaism insist that Jews allow gleanings to be consumed by the poor and by strangers during Sabbatical years. In the modern world, gleaning is practised by humanitarian groups which distribute the gleaned food to the poor and hungry; in a modern context, this can include the collection of food from supermarkets at the end of the day that would otherwise be thrown away. In addition to supermarkets, gleaning events also occur at farms in the field. Volunteers, called gleaners, visit a farm where the farmer donates what is left in their fields to collect and donate to a food bank. In New York State in 2010, this form of gleaning alone rescued 3.6 million pounds of fruits and vegetables. There are a number of organizations that practice gleaning to resolve issues of societal hunger; the Society of St. Andrew, for example, is dedicated to the role. When people glean and distribute food, they may be bringing themselves legal risk; in the Soviet Union, the Law of Spikelets (sometimes translated \\"law on gleaning\\") criminalised gleaning, under penalty of death, or 20 years of forced labour in exceptional circumstances. In the US, the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act of 1996 limited the liability of donors to instances of gross negligence or intentional misconduct, alleviating gleaning from much of the risk that was allegedly hampering the delivery of surplus food from restaurants and dining facilities to emergency food centers. The law preempts state Good Samaritan Acts, that provide less protection. On the island of Bali, traditional law allows fruit from a tree to be picked by the passerby from the ground - even if the tree is on privately owned land. Gleaning in art The Gleaners (L√©on Augustin Lhermitte, 1898) Gleaning was a popular subject in art, especially in the nineteenth century. Gleaning in rural France has been represented in the paintings Des Glaneuses (1857) by Jean-Fran√ßois Millet and Le rappel des glaneuses (1859) by Jules Breton (image), and explored in a 2000 documentary/experimental film, The Gleaners and I, by Agn√®s Varda.Callenbach, Ernest. \\"The Gleaners and I (Les Glaneurs Et La Glaneuse)\\". Film Quarterly, vol. 56, no. 2 (2002): 46-49. doi:10.1525/fq.2002.56.2.46. Vincent van Gogh's sketch of a Peasant Woman Gleaning in Nuenen, The Netherlands (1885) is in the Charles Clore collection. Woolgathering Gathering Wool by Henry Herbert La Thangue Woolgathering is a practice similar to gleaning, but for wool. The practice, now obsolete, was of collecting bits of wool that had gotten caught on bushes and fences or fallen on the ground as sheep passed by. The meandering perambulations of a woolgatherer give rise to idiomatic sense of the word as meaning aimless wandering of the mind. Fishing Along marine coastlines, gleaning has been defined as \\"fishing with basic gear, including bare hands, in shallow water not deeper than that one can stand\\".Nordlund, L.M., Unsworth, R.K., Gullstr√∂m, M. and Cullen‚ÄêUnsworth, L.C.

We had all the > same ideas about bands and life and drinking and everything. Laffoon had for three years previously been a member of the band Keith Joe Dick and the Goners. Two different guitar players joined, but soon left.. Then the band added guitarist Rosie Flores, namesake of the band Rosie and the Screamers, with whom Laffoon was acquainted from her time with Keith Joe Dick and the Goners. The trio added bassist Laura Bandit, a veteran of the minor punk bands One Doesn't Swallow and Hard as Nails, Cheap as Dirt. A fifth member of the group, Marsky Reins, played fiddle in addition to guitar, helping the band to achieve a signature punked up country and western sound. Sporting cowboy boots and western skirts, the band delivered a high energy live show. \\"A lot of people tell us we've got more balls than any girl band they've seen because we get real wild onstage,\\" Pleasant Gehman noted. \\"We're not into wimpiness at all.\\" The band portrayed The She-Devils in Max Tash's film The Runnin' Kind, which took its name from a song written by sister and brother Diane Boom Boom Dixon and Gary Dixon (Fur Dixon's husband). :Lineup changes The band had several lineup changes over the course of their existence, adding Miiko Watanabe on bass as well as former Pandoras drummer Casey Gomez. :Later bands Original drummer and songwriter Diane 'Boom Boom' Dixon went on to play with the Baloney Heads and the Real Dixons in Austin, Texas. Pleasant Gehman became a writer and editor, professional dancer and a member of the Ringling Sisters. Rosie Flores went on to have a successful solo career in the alternative country and rockabilly scene. Genny Schorr, the original guitar player, was also in the original line-up of all girl band Backstage Pass and was involved in The Masque. She later owned Rock clothing store Strait Jacket with Elvis Costello's manager Jake Riviera. She was associated with bands such as The Bangles as Stylist. Miiko Watanabe went on to play with American Girls. Fur Dixon went on to play in The Cramps, The Dixons, Fur Dixon and Blow Up, Fur Dixon and Steve Werner, and a new band she formed in 2015, WTFUKUSHIMA!

Canon advertised using 18,000 baseball caps with the word \\"Canon\\" on the back at Yankee Stadium. A baseball cap is a type of soft cap with a rounded crown and a stiff bill projecting in front. The front of the cap typically displays a design or a logo (historically, usually only a sports team, namely a baseball team, or names of relevant companies, when used as a commercial marketing technique). The cap may be \\"fitted\\" to the wearer's head or the back may have elastic, a plastic prong-in-a-hole (multiple holes with one prong that can be inserted), Velcro, a zipper, or a tri-glide slide so that it can be quickly adjusted to fit different wearers' heads. The baseball cap is a part of the traditional baseball uniform worn by players, with the brim pointing forward to shield the eyes from the sun. Since the 1980s, varieties of the hat have become prevalent in the United States and many other nations, both for utilitarian (protecting the eyes from the sun) and fashion accessory purposes.  History  Jackie Robinson wearing a baseball cap in 1954. Portrait of Cincinnati Reds players, 1888 In 1860, the Brooklyn Excelsiors wore the ancestor of the modern rounded-top baseball cap, which featured a long peak and a button on top, and by 1900, the \\"Brooklyn style\\" cap became popular. During the 1940s, latex rubber became the stiffening material inside the hat and the modern baseball cap was born. The peak, also known in certain areas as the \\"bill\\" or \\"brim\\", was designed to protect a player's eyes from the sun. Typically, the peak was much shorter in the earlier days of the baseball hat. Also, the hat has become more structured, versus the overall \\"floppy\\" cap of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The baseball cap was and still is an important means by which to identify a team. Often the logo, mascot, or team's initial was placed on the cap. Usually, the cap was also fashioned in the official colors of a particular team. The basic shape, including curved peak, is similar to some styles of 19th century sun bonnets.BBC ‚Äì Happy 59th, baseball caps 18 December 2008  Design  Fitted baseball caps ‚Äî those without an adjuster ‚Äî are normally sewn in six sections, and may be topped with a matching fabric-covered button (also called a squatchee) on the crown. Metal grommets or fabric eyelets are often sewn or attached near the top of each of the six sections of fabric to provide ventilation. In some cases, the rear sections of the crown are made of net-like mesh material for extra ventilation. The peak is typically stiffened by a sewn-in piece of paperboard or stiff plastic.  Variations  Baseball caps are made of many types of material and shaped in various styles for different purposes. Major and minor league baseball players wear classic-style caps made of wool (or, more recently, polyester) with their team's simple logo and colors; the logo is usually embroidered into the fabric. More recently there are brands that are using uncommon materials for snapback hats as for example wood brims. Formerly, baseball caps only came in standard hat sizes. Since the early 1970s, they have also been available in a one-size-fits-all form, with an adjustment strap in the back. The style, commonly called snapback, has become increasingly popular as fashion accessories. Advances in textiles have led to the \\"stretch-fit\\" hat, which uses Lycra or rubber to allow a hat to have a fitted style while still being \\"adjustable\\" within sizes. Trucker cap The front may be soft, or may be stiffened by buckram to display a logo more clearly. Another version of the baseball cap is a plastic mesh cap with a foam front imprinted with a company logo. This style is sometimes called a trucker cap or a \\"gimme cap\\" because it is given away for free as a promotional item. Dad hats are unstructured caps with low profile, curved brim, and stripe on the back. There are 4 major types of baseball caps: # Snapback hat - (hat with a snap closure in the rear) with flat brim, high profile, adjustable. # Adjustable hat - (hat with a velcro closure in the rear) unstructured, low profile, curved brim, adjustable. # Fitted hat - curved or flat brim, structured cap, high profile, unadjustable. # \\"Flexfit\\" hat - curved or flat brim, structured cap, high profile, adjustable by the use of elastic materials.  Athletic use  face mask by some catchers and are worn under the mask of umpires. Beginning with the 2014 season, MLB pitchers are permitted to wear a special reinforced cap to protect their heads from line drives. Athletes in other sports wear caps with their team's logo and colors as \\"sideline\\" caps; both types are also sold as authentic team merchandise in retail stores. Other caps may simply have a maker's logo, such as Reebok, Nike or Carhartt; these hats are often made of brushed cotton. Golfers tend to prefer the sports visor form which does not cover the head but keeps the sun out of their eyes; women also traditionally have worn visors casually but a trend in certain youth subcultures sees an increase in feminine use of full caps.  Professional use = Military  Baseball caps worn by naval officers from the US, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines Some armed forces use baseball caps as part of their uniforms, including the United States Navy and United States Coast Guard. Used mostly with the utility uniform and coveralls, the baseball cap usually has a command logo on the front to denote command affiliation. Baseball caps of a particular color are worn to denote a specific function of a person or particular job. For example, in the United States submarine force, red baseball caps are worn by drill monitors who facilitate and critique members of the boat's crew during drills. In the United States Army, parachute riggers wear red baseball caps and parachute instructors wear black baseball caps as part of their uniform. In various squadrons of the United States Air Force's civilian auxiliary, squadron-distinctive baseball caps have been issued as headgear (or \\"cover\\") for the Battle Dress Uniform, typically displaying squadron colors, squadron number, and/or squadron patch. Although the BDUs have their own cover, a patrol cap in M81 Woodland, some squadrons have opted for more distinctive covers.  Police  :See also: Uniform#Police Finnish police wearing baseball caps, with Finnish Border Guard agents wearing side caps There has been a marked trend in recent years among police forces and other uniformed bodies throughout the world to substitute cheap and comfortable baseball caps for peaked caps and other traditional headdresses. The baseball cap is also commonly used by private security companies as a cheap, practical piece of uniform headgear. The Finnish Police uses a baseball cap (seen on the image at this link), which is considered an official identification device and cannot be worn, or even displayed by civilians, and has mostly replaced the traditional side cap. In Britain, the baseball cap has the additional advantage of being unisex and suitable for wear by both male and female officers. Throughout 2017, the Northamptonshire, Cheshire and Lancashire police forces adopted specially strengthened baseball caps known as \\"Bump Caps\\", to replace the helmets and bowler hats previously worn. However, the Northamptonshire force announced in November 2018 that their \\"Bump Caps\\" had proven scruffy and unpopular, and would be withdrawn from use.Northamptonshire Chronicle & Echo, 15 November 2018 In Slovenia, policemen on motorcycles wear baseball caps as a part of their uniform, when they remove the helmet. Turkish police switched from peaked caps to baseball caps in the 1990s. In many United States police forces, the baseball cap is worn as a more practical alternative to the traditional peaked cap or campaign hat, the latter of which is generally used by Sheriff's departments and state police forces. Baseball caps are more common on the West Coast, whereas in eastern states, the traditional peaked cap is more prominent. A notable exception is the San Francisco Police Department, where peaked caps are still worn regularly. Many armed police units around the world, notably SWAT in the United States and the United Kingdom Metropolitan Police Specialist Firearms Command, often wear baseball caps to shield their eyes from the sun where a full helmet would be excessive.

It is situated between the hand and forearm on the thumb side of the wrist (also called the lateral or radial side). It forms the radial border of the carpal tunnel. The scaphoid bone is the largest bone of the proximal row of wrist bones, its long axis being from above downward, lateralward, and forward. It is approximately the size and shape of a medium cashew.  Structure  The scaphoid is situated between the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones. It is located on the radial side of the wrist, and articulates with the radius, lunate, trapezoid, trapezium and capitate. Over 80% of the bone is covered in articular cartilage. Bone The palmar surface of the scaphoid is concave, and forming a tubercle, giving attachment to the transverse carpal ligament. The proximal surface is triangular, smooth and convex, and articulates with the radius and adjacent carpal bones, namely the lunate, capitate, trapezium and trapezoid. The lateral surface is narrow and gives attachment to the radial collateral ligament. The medial surface has two facets, a flattened semi-lunar facet articulating with the lunate bone, and an inferior concave facet, articulating alongside the lunate with the head of the capitate bone. The dorsal surface of the bone is narrow, with a groove running the length of the bone and allowing ligaments to attach, and the surface facing the fingers (anatomically inferior) is smooth and convex, also triangular, and divided into two parts by a slight ridge. Blood supply It receives its blood supply primarily from lateral and distal branches of the radial artery, via palmar and dorsal branches. These provide an \\"abundant\\" supply to middle and distal portions of the bone, but neglect the proximal portion, which relies on retrograde flow. The dorsal branch supplies the majority of the middle and distal portions, with the palmar branch supplying only the distal third of the bone. Variation The dorsal blood supply, particularly of the proximal portion, is highly variable. Sometimes the fibers of the abductor pollicis brevis emerge from the tubercle. In animals In reptiles, birds, and amphibians, this bone is instead commonly referred to as the radiale because of its articulation with the radius.  Function  The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. The scaphoid is also involved in movement of the wrist. It, along with the lunate, articulates with the radius and ulna to form the major bones involved in movement of the wrist. The scaphoid serves as a link between the two rows of carpal bones. With wrist movement, the scaphoid may flex from its position in the same plane as the forearm to perpendicular. Clinical significance=Fracture Fractures of the scaphoid are the most common of the carpal bone injuries, because of its connections with the two rows of carpal bones. The scaphoid can be slow to heal because of the limited circulation to the bone. Fractures of the scaphoid must be recognized and treated quickly, as prompt treatment by immobilization or surgical fixation increases the likelihood of the bone healing in anatomic alignment, thus avoiding mal-union or non-union. Delays may compromise healing. Failure of the fracture to heal (\\"non-union\\") will lead to post- traumatic osteoarthritis of the carpus. One reason for this is because of the \\"tenuous\\" blood supply to the proximal segment. Even rapidly immobilized fractures may require surgical treatment, including use of a headless compression screw such as the Herbert screw to bind the two halves together. Healing of the fracture with a non-anatomic deformity (frequently, a volar flexed \\"humpback\\") can also lead to post-traumatic arthritis. Non-unions can result in loss of blood supply to the proximal pole, which can result in avascular necrosis of the proximal segment. Scaphoid fractures may be difficult to diagnose via plain x-ray, so repeat x-ray may be used at a later date, or cross-sectional imaging via MRI or CT scan. Other diseases A condition called scapholunate instability can occur when the scapholunate ligament (connecting the scaphoid to the lunate bone) and other surrounding ligaments are disrupted. In this state, the distance between the scaphoid and lunate bones is increased. There is a rare disease of this bone called Preiser's Disease. Palpation The scaphoid can be palpated at the base of the anatomical snuff box. It can also be palpated in the volar (palmar) hand/wrist. Its position is the intersections of the long axes of the four fingers while in a fist, or the base of the thenar eminence. When palpated in this position, the bone will be felt to slide forward during radial deviation (wrist abduction) and flexion. Clicking of the scaphoid or no anterior translation can indicate scapholunate instability. Etymology The etymology of the scaphoid bone () is derived from the Greek skaphos, which means \\"a boat,\\" and the Greek eidos, which means \\"kind\\". The name refers to the shape of the bone, supposedly reminiscent of a boat. In older literature about human anatomy, the scaphoid is referred to as the navicular bone of the hand (this time from the Latin word ‚Äúnavis‚Äù = boat), since there is also a bone in a similar position in the foot which is called the navicular.

The castle was part of the defensive line controlled by the Knights Templar, and a stronghold used during the Portuguese Reconquista. History Tagus River, showing the granite outcropping and its 18-metre rise over the waterway. The semi-circular battlements and allures that skirt the inner enclosure and the main keep. It is believed that the castle was constructed on the site of a primitive Lusitanian castro that was later conquered by the Romans during the 1st century B.C.E. It was later remodeled by successive invading forces, including the Alans, Visigoths and the Andalusian Berbers, although it is unclear when the actual castle was established. In excavations carried out in the interior and exterior enclosures, various vestiges of Roman occupation were discovered including coins, millennium markers, and Roman foundations, while medieval remnants such as medallions and two marble columns were also discovered in the castle's vicinity. The castle of Almourol is one of the more emblematic and cenographic medieval military monuments of the Reconquista, and one of the best representations of the influence of the Knights Templar in Portugal. When it was conquered in 1129 by forces loyal to the Portuguese nobility, it was known as Almorolan, and placed in the trust of Gualdim Pais, the master of the Knights Templar in Portugal, who subsequently rebuilt the structure. The structure was reconstructed, starting in 1171 (from an inscription over the principal gate) and restored during the subsequent reigns. Losing its strategic place, it was abandoned, resulting in its fall into ruins. In the 19th century, it was \\"reinvented\\" by idealistic romanticists, which eventually led to interventions in the 1940s and 1950s, and its adaption as an Official Residence of the Portuguese Republic. During this period, there were many restorations that transformed the physical appearance of the structure, including the addition of crenellations and bartizans. The DGMEN - Direc√ß√£o-Geral dos Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (Directorate-General of Buildings and National Monuments), the forerunner of the IGESPAR, first intervened on the site in 1939, through the construction of the chemin de ronde in masonry, including reinforced concrete; the dismantlement and reconstruction of the corner of the keep; repair and consolidation of the battlements, including the demolition of the tower's allure, reconstruction of a brick vault under the existing; and reconstruction of the pavement in small stone. Around 1940-1950, the spaces were adapted for its use as an official residence of the Portuguese Republic. At the end of this short term, the building's furniture was acquired by the Commission for Furniture Acquisition () in 1955, while an electrical system was installed. Between 1958 and 1959, there was some consolidation of the keep with concrete straps, a project to diminish the permeability of the courtyard and reconstruction of the interior walls of the tower by the Escola Pr√°tica de Engenharia (Practical School of Engineering), as well as the reconstruction of a door that included doorposts and lintels. In subsequent years, other projects followed: in 1959, the fa√ßade of one section of wall was repaired; in 1960, with the conclusion of the repairs to the exterior walls, the pavement and road access was improved by the Direc√ß√£o da Arma de Engenharia de Tancos (Tancos Directorate for the Engineering Arm). However, one roadway that skirted the islet from the quay to the southern end of the castle was reconstructed by the Servi√ßos de Engenharia do Estado Maior do Ex√©rcito (Army General Staff Engineering Services). By 1996, the walls had been repaired, sections of the keep were preserved, and the pavement in the castle restored.  21st century and tourism  Owing to water infiltration, the castle began to show some signs of degradation by 2004, including a few of the exterior walls. Although access to the Portuguese National Monument and fluvial islet is free, visitors to the structure must pay for an inexpensive boat-ride across the river, the only way for visitors to reach the castle.The main gate/door (viewed from the interior) showing access to the allures. Architecture Example of the crenellations of the outer enclosure The castle rises over a granite outcropping in height, and is approximately long and wide, in the middle of the Tagus River waterway, a few metres below its confluence with the Z√™zere River in front of the town of Tancos. The castle has an irregular rectangular plan consisting of two enclosures: an exterior lower level faces upstream with a traitors' gate and walls reinforced by nine tall circular towers; while the interior enclosure, located at a higher elevation, has walls accessible by the main gate to the main keep. The keep is three stories tall, and includes the original pads that supported the main truss. The remaining sentry towers are irregular, owing to the irregular terrain. The keep is actually an innovation at this castle, appearing in the 12th century after the Castle of Tomar, the principal defensive redoubt of the Templars in Portugal.Barroca (2001), p.107 Similarly, the watchtowers were innovations brought into the western Iberian peninsula by the Templars, and applied in Almourol. The interior is bisected by several masonry doorways that link the different parts of the castle. Two inscription stones mark the castle's history and its re-edification by Gualdim Pais (over the main gate), as well as its Christian history (from the cross carved into the space above an open window in the keep).

As the party was the Official Opposition in the Parliament of Canada, Gauthier was also the Leader of the Opposition during this time. He later recanted his sovereignist views when he joined the Conservative Party two years before his death. Early life Gauthier was born in Quebec City on February 18, 1950, and was raised in Chambord. His father, Joseph-Georges Tremblay, worked as a motor engine technician; his mother, C√©cile (Archambault), was a housewife. Gauthier was a school teacher from 1970 to 1975, educational advisor from 1976 to 1979, then director of education services from 1979 to 1981 at the Roberval school board. He then served as president of the Tourism Corporation of Chambord in 1975 and in 1976 as president of Chambord Chamber of Commerce in 1977 and 1978. Political career Gauthier was first elected as a Member of the National Assembly of Quebec for the Parti Qu√©b√©cois in 1981 for Roberval and was parliamentary secretary to the finance minister from 1983 to 1985. He was re-elected to the legislature in 1985 and served until 1988 when he resigned his seat to become director-general of the Roberval school board. He won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as a candidate of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois in 1993. Gauthier was not one of the Bloc's better-known Members of Parliament (MPs), but after Lucien Bouchard resigned to become Premier of Quebec, Gauthier won the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leadership election of 1996, defeating Francine Lalonde. The vote was conducted among members of the party's directorate rather than by all members of the party, and this hurt Gauthier's legitimacy. Gauthier's lack of profile resulted in some opposition parties mocking him as being the \\"faceless leader\\" of the opposition, as he was largely a political unknown in most of Canada and even in Quebec. His leadership was unpopular with the caucus due to alleged conservative views and his lack of \\"charisma or authority\\" when compared to Bouchard. Facing a revolt by his MPs, which culminated in the leaking of confidential caucus discussions, Gauthier resigned in March 1997. He was succeeded by Gilles Duceppe. As a result of health issues after surgery, he announced in March 2007 that he would not run in the next federal election. He served as BQ House Leader from 1997 until 2007. Gauthier also served as the chief campaign organizer. He formally resigned on July 29, 2007, and became the host of Gauthier, a television news show, which began airing on TQS in September 2007. On May 12, 2018, Gauthier joined the Conservative Party of Canada after not having been a member of any political party for 11 years. He has also said he was no longer a sovereigntist though he remained a Quebec nationalist. Personal life and death Gauthier was married to Anne Allard until his death. He had two children from a previous marriage (Alexandre and Isabelle). Gauthier died on May 30, 2020, at the age of 70. He had been suffering from lung cancer in the years leading up to his death.

The churches¬π have common roots with the Christadelphians and the Church of God General Conference (Abrahamic Faith). Background Benjamin Wilson spent his early life in Halifax, England. Benjamin, with his brothers, Joseph, John, and James, questioned the teachings of their local Baptist Church and \\"became convinced that the promises to Abraham were central to salvation\\". Benjamin and James moved their families to Geneva, Illinois in 1844. Brothers John and Joseph came to Geneva around 1849. Together they started a church in Geneva. Because of adopting a stance against military service, there was a need to adopt an \\"official\\" name during the Civil War. The name \\"Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith\\", suggested by Benjamin Wilson, was chosen. The work of the Wilsons led to a number of congregations from Ohio to California (where Benjamin later moved), but no central organization. John Thomas, founder of the Christadelphians, was also a British emigrant who had been associated with the Campbellite movement in Illinois. Thomas and Wilson first corresponded by letter from 1846-1856 then met and were in active fellowship from 1856-1862. However, in 1863 a disagreement between the two men concerning the judgment seat and the resurrection caused the groups associated with them to separate, and the rift was confirmed when the two groups registered (for the purposes of conscientious objection in the American Civil War) with different names in 1865.Hemingray, Peter, Preface to new edition of the Emphatic Diaglott, Abrahamic Beacon, Miami, 2003 The Church of the Blessed Hope began as a local congregation in Cleveland, Ohio. It was organized on October 4, 1863. Mark Allen, a missionary of the Church of God Abrahamic Faith movement from Woburn, Massachusetts, led fourteen Ohioans in founding this body. Congregations were soon afterward established in Salem and Unionville, and these congregations incorporated themselves as the Church of the Blessed Hope in 1888. All these congregations still exist, although the Cleveland body has moved to Chesterland. The leader of the Cleveland congregation from 1922‚Äì1927 was a Christadelphian. The Church of the Blessed Hope and the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith were different in name, but part of the same movement. By the early 20th century, the movement had grown to over 200 congregations in about a dozen states. They were only a loose fellowship of churches. Some ties were maintained by state conferences and a periodical, The Restitution. When Benjamin Wilson retired in 1869 he left his The Gospel Banner to be merged with his nephew Thomas Wilson's Herald of the Coming Kingdom and Bible Instructor, which was renamed in The Restitution in 1871 and published by Thomas Wilson and W.D. St. Clair in Chicago. In 1911 the five man Ministerial Association objected to the next editor of The Restitution, A. R. Underwood of Plymouth Indiana, leading to a severing of fellowship of the churches. The majority followed those opposed to Underwood, led by L. E. Connor, and they added two doctrines to their statement of faith - universal resurrection and open communion. Later, they also added the belief in a personal devil. The majority regrouped in 1921 and organized the Church of God (General Conference) (CoGGC) publishing a new magazine The Restitution Herald, published in Oregon, Illinois. Five congregations (three in Ohio and one each in Kentucky and Indiana) rejected these doctrinal additions and stood for the old Geneva Statement of Faith, now publishing The Restitution from Cleveland, Ohio. The minority congregations maintained ties, and in 1966 four of the then six churches adopted a uniform doctrinal statement. In 1976 these six churches (informally known as CGAF) began to gather for an annual gathering, which is now held each year in August at various colleges in Ohio.History of the Church of the Blessed Hope 1863-1963, by B.

Lang, et al., (11 page pamphlet) Faith and practice The Church of the Blessed Hope (CGAF) rejects the doctrine of the Trinity; recognizes the Bible as God's revealed word; teaches that salvation is obtained through hearing, believing, confessing, and obeying the gospel; and expects the premillennial return and reign of Jesus, in which the righteous and the unjust will be raised, but that those who have not heard the gospel will not be raised from the dead. Valid baptism is performed through the immersion of believers in water. Christ's command to partake the bread and the cup (communion) is observed weekly. They reject the doctrines which the larger CoGGC grouping accepted in 1921, namely a literal devil, universal resurrection, and open communion. Additionally CGAF members do not serve in war as combatants, although some congregations permit members to serve in humanitarian positions.Profiles in Belief: the Religious Bodies of the United States and Canada, by Arthur Carl Piepkorn Status In 2003, the Church of the Blessed Hope (CGAF) had eight congregations¬≤ with about 400 members. The three Ohio congregations use the name Church of the Blessed Hope and the others do not. These CGAF churches are theologically much closer to the Christadelphians than they are to the Church of God General Conference (CoGGC), and have made moves in recent years to strengthen their ties. Most of the churches use the Christadelphian hymnal and Sunday School literature. Several of the CGAF churches, while having their own local statement of faith have also recognised the most common Christadelphian statement of the faith (BASF),http://www.abrahamicfaithinniles.org/belief.php in much the same way as many Christadelphian assemblies in Britain have their own local statements but employ the most common statement for wider purposes. It is a common practice for members of the Church of the Blessed Hope to seek out Christadelphian ecclesias when they move to areas where there is not a Church of the Blessed Hope. They are generally accepted into the Christadelphian ecclesia, and become active members of the Christadelphian community. Likewise, the Church of the Blessed Hope will accept a Christadelphian into fellowship. The CGAF annual Gathering,http://abrahamicfaithgathering.org/ currently held at Denison, Ohio, has played an important role in reintroducing CGAF to Christadelphians and Christadelphians to CGAF. The Gathering receives a large contingent of both Unamended Christadelphians and Amended Christadelphians each year, and likewise many CGAF members attend Christadelphian events such as the annual Great Lakes Christadelphian Bible School.http://glcbs.org/ CGAF members have been invited to submit both articles, letters and event announcements in the Christadelphian Tidings,http://www.tidings.org/reflections/reflect200901.htm and likewise Christadelphians in the Abrahamic Faith Beacon. CGAF members cooperate with Christadelphian mission and charity organisations overseas. At the same time, common participation by CGAF and Christadelphian members on discussion forums has helped to make many Christadelphians, even outside North America, aware of the common beliefs shared with CGAF, and the differences with Church of God General Conference.

A barchan or barkhan dune (from Kazakh –±–∞—Ä—Ö–∞–Ω ) is a crescent-shaped dune. The term was introduced in 1881 by Russian naturalist Alexander von Middendorf, for crescent-shaped sand dunes in Turkestan and other inland desert regions. Barchans face the wind, appearing convex and are produced by wind action predominantly from one direction. They are a very common landform in sandy deserts all over the world and are arc-shaped, markedly asymmetrical in cross section, with a gentle slope facing toward the wind sand ridge, comprising well-sorted sand. This type of dune possesses two \\"horns\\" that face downwind, with the steeper slope known as the slip face, facing away from the wind, downwind, at the angle of repose of the sand in question, approximately 30-35 degrees for medium-fine dry sand. The upwind side is packed by the wind, and stands at about 15 degrees. Barchans may be high and wide at the base measured perpendicular to the wind. Simple barchan dunes may appear as larger, compound barchan or megabarchan dunes, which can gradually migrate with the wind as a result of erosion on the windward side and deposition on the leeward side, at a rate of migration ranging from about one meter to 100 meters per year. Barchans usually occur as groups of isolated dunes and may form chains that extend across a plain in the direction of the prevailing wind. Barchans and mega- barchans may coalesce into ridges that extend for hundreds of kilometers. Dune collisions and changes in wind direction spawn new barchans from the horns of the old ones and govern the size distribution of a given field. As barchan dunes migrate, smaller dunes outpace larger dunes, catching-up the rear of the larger dune and eventually appear to punch through the large dune to appear on the other side. The process appears superficially similar to waves of light, sound, or water that pass directly through each other, but the detailed mechanism is very different. The dunes emulate soliton behavior, but unlike solitons, which flow through a medium leaving it undisturbed (think of waves through water), the sand particles themselves are moved. When the smaller dune catches up the larger dune, the winds begin to deposit sand on the rear dune while blowing sand off the front dune without replenishing it. Eventually, the rear dune has assumed dimensions similar to the former front dune which has now become a smaller, faster moving dune that pulls away with the wind. Barchan dunes have been observed on Mars, where the thin atmosphere produces winds strong enough to move sand and dust.

A similar nonparametric test used on dependent samples is the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Assumptions and formal statement of hypotheses Although Mann and Whitney developed the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test under the assumption of continuous responses with the alternative hypothesis being that one distribution is stochastically greater than the other, there are many other ways to formulate the null and alternative hypotheses such that the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test will give a valid test. A very general formulation is to assume that: # All the observations from both groups are independent of each other, # The responses are ordinal (i.e., one can at least say, of any two observations, which is the greater), # Under the null hypothesis H0, the distributions of both populations are equal., See Table 2.1 of Pratt (1964) \\"Robustness of Some Procedures for the Two-Sample Location Problem.\\" Journal of the American Statistical Association. 59 (307): 655‚Äì680. If the two distributions are normal with the same mean but different variances, then Pr[ X>Y]=Pr[YY]=Pr[Y # The alternative hypothesis H1 is that the distributions are not equal. Under the general formulation, the test is only consistent when the following occurs under H1: # The probability of an observation from population X exceeding an observation from population Y is different (larger, or smaller) than the probability of an observation from Y exceeding an observation from X; i.e., or . Under more strict assumptions than the general formulation above, e.g., if the responses are assumed to be continuous and the alternative is restricted to a shift in location, i.e., , we can interpret a significant Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test as showing a difference in medians. Under this location shift assumption, we can also interpret the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test as assessing whether the Hodges‚ÄìLehmann estimate of the difference in central tendency between the two populations differs from zero. The Hodges‚ÄìLehmann estimate for this two-sample problem is the median of all possible differences between an observation in the first sample and an observation in the second sample. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test / Wilcoxon rank-sum test is not the same as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, although both are nonparametric and involve summation of ranks. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test is applied to independent samples. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is applied to matched or dependent samples. Calculations The test involves the calculation of a statistic, usually called U, whose distribution under the null hypothesis is known. In the case of small samples, the distribution is tabulated, but for sample sizes above ~20, approximation using the normal distribution is fairly good. Some books tabulate statistics equivalent to U, such as the sum of ranks in one of the samples, rather than U itself. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test is included in most modern statistical packages. It is also easily calculated by hand, especially for small samples. There are two ways of doing this. Method one: For comparing two small sets of observations, a direct method is quick, and gives insight into the meaning of the U statistic, which corresponds to the number of wins out of all pairwise contests (see the tortoise and hare example under Examples below). For each observation in one set, count the number of times this first value wins over any observations in the other set (the other value loses if this first is larger). Count 0.5 for any ties. The sum of wins and ties is U (i.e.: U_1) for the first set. U for the other set is the converse (i.e.: U_2). Method two: For larger samples: # Assign numeric ranks to all the observations (put the observations from both groups to one set), beginning with 1 for the smallest value. Where there are groups of tied values, assign a rank equal to the midpoint of unadjusted rankings. E.g., the ranks of are (the unadjusted rank would be ). # Now, add up the ranks for the observations which came from sample 1\\\\. The sum of ranks in sample 2 is now determinate, since the sum of all the ranks equals where N is the total number of observations. # U is then given by: :::U_1=R_1 - {n_1(n_1+1) \\\\over 2} \\\\,! ::where n1 is the sample size for sample 1, and R1 is the sum of the ranks in sample 1\\\\. ::Note that it doesn't matter which of the two samples is considered sample 1\\\\. An equally valid formula for U is :::U_2= R_2 - {n_2(n_2+1) \\\\over 2} \\\\,! ::The smaller value of U1 and U2 is the one used when consulting significance tables. The sum of the two values is given by :::U_1 + U_2 = R_1 - {n_1(n_1+1) \\\\over 2} + R_2 - {n_2(n_2+1) \\\\over 2}. \\\\,! :: Knowing that and , and doing some algebra, we find that the sum is :::. Properties The maximum value of U is the product of the sample sizes for the two samples (i.e.: U_i = n_1 n_2). In such a case, the \\"other\\" U would be 0\\\\. Examples=Illustration of calculation methods Suppose that Aesop is dissatisfied with his classic experiment in which one tortoise was found to beat one hare in a race, and decides to carry out a significance test to discover whether the results could be extended to tortoises and hares in general. He collects a sample of 6 tortoises and 6 hares, and makes them all run his race at once. The order in which they reach the finishing post (their rank order, from first to last crossing the finish line) is as follows, writing T for a tortoise and H for a hare: :T H H H H H T T T T T H What is the value of U? * Using the direct method, we take each tortoise in turn, and count the number of hares it beats, getting 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, which means that . Alternatively, we could take each hare in turn, and count the number of tortoises it beats. In this case, we get 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, so U = 25. Note that the sum of these two values for , which is . * Using the indirect method: : rank the animals by the time they take to complete the course, so give the first animal home rank 12, the second rank 11, and so forth. : the sum of the ranks achieved by the tortoises is . :: Therefore (same as method one). :: the sum of the ranks achieved by the hares is , leading to . Illustration of object of test A second example race illustrates the point that the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test does not test for inequality of medians, but rather for difference of distributions. Consider another hare and tortoise race, with 19 participants of each species, in which the outcomes are as follows, from first to last past the finishing post: :H H H H H H H H H T T T T T T T T T T H H H H H H H H H H T T T T T T T T T If we simply compared medians, we would conclude that the median time for tortoises is less than the median time for hares, because the median tortoise here (in bold) comes in at position 19, and thus actually beats the median hare (in bold), which comes in at position 20. However, the value of U is 100 (using the quick method of calculation described above, we see that each of 10 tortoises beats each of 10 hares, so ). Consulting tables, or using the approximation below, we find that this U value gives significant evidence that hares tend to have lower completion times than tortoises (, two-tailed). Obviously these are extreme distributions that would be spotted easily, but in larger samples something similar could happen without it being so apparent. Notice that the problem here is not that the two distributions of ranks have different variances; they are mirror images of each other, so their variances are the same, but they have very different skewness. Example statement of results In reporting the results of a Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test, it is important to state: *A measure of the central tendencies of the two groups (means or medians; since the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test is an ordinal test, medians are usually recommended) *The value of U (perhaps with some measure of effect size, such as Common language effect size or Rank-biserial correlation). *The sample sizes *The significance level. In practice some of this information may already have been supplied and common sense should be used in deciding whether to repeat it. A typical report might run, :\\"Median latencies in groups E and C were 153 and 247 ms; the distributions in the two groups differed significantly (Mann‚ÄìWhitney , , two-tailed).\\" A statement that does full justice to the statistical status of the test might run, :\\"Outcomes of the two treatments were compared using the Wilcoxon‚ÄìMann‚ÄìWhitney two-sample rank-sum test. The treatment effect (difference between treatments) was quantified using the Hodges‚ÄìLehmann (HL) estimator, which is consistent with the Wilcoxon test. This estimator (HLŒî) is the median of all possible differences in outcomes between a subject in group B and a subject in group A. A non- parametric 0.95 confidence interval for HLŒî accompanies these estimates as does œÅ, an estimate of the probability that a randomly chosen subject from population B has a higher weight than a randomly chosen subject from population A. The median [quartiles] weight for subjects on treatment A and B respectively are 147 [121, 177] and 151 [130, 180] kg. Treatment A decreased weight by HLŒî = 5 kg (0.95 CL [2, 9] kg, , ).\\" However it would be rare to find so extended a report in a document whose major topic was not statistical inference. Normal approximation and tie correction For large samples, U is approximately normally distributed. In that case, the standardized value :z = \\\\frac{ U - m_U }{ \\\\sigma_U }, \\\\, where mU and œÉU are the mean and standard deviation of U, is approximately a standard normal deviate whose significance can be checked in tables of the normal distribution. mU and œÉU are given by :m_U = \\\\frac{n_1 n_2}{2}, \\\\, and :\\\\sigma_U=\\\\sqrt{n_1 n_2 (n_1 + n_2+1) \\\\over 12}. \\\\, The formula for the standard deviation is more complicated in the presence of tied ranks. If there are ties in ranks, œÉ should be corrected as follows: : \\\\sigma_\\\\text{corr}=\\\\sqrt{{n_1 n_2 \\\\over 12 } \\\\left((n+1)-\\\\sum_{i=1}^k {{t_i}^3 - t_i \\\\over n(n-1)}\\\\right) } \\\\, where , ti is the number of subjects sharing rank i, and k is the number of (distinct) ranks. If the number of ties is small (and especially if there are no large tie bands) ties can be ignored when doing calculations by hand. The computer statistical packages will use the correctly adjusted formula as a matter of routine. Note that since , the mean used in the normal approximation is the mean of the two values of U. Therefore, the absolute value of the z statistic calculated will be same whichever value of U is used. Effect sizes It is a widely recommended practice for scientists to report an effect size for an inferential test. Proportion of concordance out of all pairs The following three measures are equivalent. =Common language effect size= One method of reporting the effect size for the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test is with f, the common language effect size. As a sample statistic, the common language effect size is computed by forming all possible pairs between the two groups, then finding the proportion of pairs that support a direction (say, that items from group 1 are larger than items from group 2). To illustrate, in a study with a sample of ten hares and ten tortoises, the total number of ordered pairs is ten times ten or 100 pairs of hares and tortoises. Suppose the results show that the hare ran faster than the tortoise in 90 of the 100 sample pairs; in that case, the sample common language effect size is 90%. This sample value is an unbiased estimator of the population value, so the sample suggests that the best estimate of the common language effect size in the population is 90%. The relationship between f and the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U (specifically U_1) is as follows: : f = {U_1 \\\\over n_1 n_2} \\\\, This is the same as the area under the curve (AUC) for the ROC curve below. =œÅ statistic= A statistic called œÅ that is linearly related to U and widely used in studies of categorization (discrimination learning involving concepts), and elsewhere, is calculated by dividing U by its maximum value for the given sample sizes, which is simply . œÅ is thus a non-parametric measure of the overlap between two distributions; it can take values between 0 and 1, and it is an estimate of , where X and Y are randomly chosen observations from the two distributions. Both extreme values represent complete separation of the distributions, while a œÅ of 0.5 represents complete overlap. The usefulness of the œÅ statistic can be seen in the case of the odd example used above, where two distributions that were significantly different on a Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test nonetheless had nearly identical medians: the œÅ value in this case is approximately 0.723 in favour of the hares, correctly reflecting the fact that even though the median tortoise beat the median hare, the hares collectively did better than the tortoises collectively. =Area-under-curve (AUC) statistic for ROC curves= The U statistic is equivalent to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) that can be readily calculated. :\\\\mathrm{AUC}_1 = {U_1 \\\\over n_1n_2} Note that this is the same definition as the common language effect size from the section above. i.e.: the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one (assuming 'positive' ranks higher than 'negative').Fawcett, Tom (2006); An introduction to ROC analysis, Pattern Recognition Letters, 27, 861‚Äì874. Because of its probabilistic form, the U statistic can be generalised to a measure of a classifier's separation power for more than two classes: :M = {1 \\\\over c(c-1)} \\\\sum \\\\mathrm{AUC}_{k,l} Where c is the number of classes, and the Rk,l term of AUCk,l considers only the ranking of the items belonging to classes k and l (i.e., items belonging to all other classes are ignored) according to the classifier's estimates of the probability of those items belonging to class k. AUCk,k will always be zero but, unlike in the two-class case, generally , which is why the M measure sums over all (k,l) pairs, in effect using the average of AUCk,l and AUCl,k. Rank-biserial correlation A method of reporting the effect size for the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test is with a measure of rank correlation known as the rank- biserial correlation. Edward Cureton introduced and named the measure. Like other correlational measures, the rank-biserial correlation can range from minus one to plus one, with a value of zero indicating no relationship. There is a simple difference formula to compute the rank-biserial correlation from the common language effect size: the correlation is the difference between the proportion of pairs favorable to the hypothesis (f) minus its complement (i.e.: the proportion that is unfavorable (u)). This simple difference formula is just the difference of the common language effect size of each group, and is as follows: :r = f - u For example, consider the example where hares run faster than tortoises in 90 of 100 pairs. The common language effect size is 90%, so the rank-biserial correlation is 90% minus 10%, and the rank-biserial . An alternative formula for the rank-biserial can be used to calculate it from the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U (either U_1 or U_2) and the sample sizes of each group: :r = f - (1 - f) = 2 f - 1 = {2U_1 \\\\over n_1 n_2} - 1 = 1 - {2U_2 \\\\over n_1 n_2} This formula is useful when the data are not available, but when there is a published report, because U and the sample sizes are routinely reported. Using the example above with 90 pairs that favor the hares and 10 pairs that favor the tortoise, U2 is the smaller of the two, so . This formula then gives , which is the same result as with the simple difference formula above. Relation to other tests=Comparison to Student's t-test The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test tests a null hypothesis of that the probability that a randomly drawn observation from one group is larger than a randomly drawn observation from the other is equal to 0.5 against an alternative that this probability is not 0.5 (see Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test#Assumptions and formal statement of hypotheses). In contrast, a t-test tests a null hypothesis of equal means in two groups against an alternative of unequal means. Hence, except in special cases, the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test and the t-test do not test the same hypotheses and should be compared with this in mind. ;Ordinal data: The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test is preferable to the t-test when the data are ordinal but not interval scaled, in which case the spacing between adjacent values of the scale cannot be assumed to be constant. ;Robustness:As it compares the sums of ranks,Motulsky, Harvey J.; Statistics Guide, San Diego, CA: GraphPad Software, 2007, p. 123 the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test is less likely than the t-test to spuriously indicate significance because of the presence of outliers. However, the Mann-Whitney U test may have worse type I error control when data are both heteroscedastic and non-normal. ;Efficiency:When normality holds, the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test has an (asymptotic) efficiency of 3/œÄ or about 0.95 when compared to the t-test.Lehamnn, Erich L.; Elements of Large Sample Theory, Springer, 1999, p. 176 For distributions sufficiently far from normal and for sufficiently large sample sizes, the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test is considerably more efficient than the t.Conover, William J.; Practical Nonparametric Statistics, John Wiley & Sons, 1980 (2nd Edition), pp. 225‚Äì226 This comparison in efficiency, however, should be interpreted with caution, as Mann-Whitney and the t-test do not test the same quantities. If, for example, a difference of group means is of primary interest, Mann-Whitney is not an appropriate test. The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test will give very similar results to performing an ordinary parametric two-sample t-test on the rankings of the data. Different distributions If one is only interested in stochastic ordering of the two populations (i.e., the concordance probability , the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test can be used even if the shapes of the distributions are different. The concordance probability is exactly equal to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) that is often used in the context. =Alternatives= If one desires a simple shift interpretation, the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test should not be used when the distributions of the two samples are very different, as it can give erroneous interpretation of significant results. In that situation, the unequal variances version of the t-test may give more reliable results. Similarly, some authors (e.g., Conover) suggest transforming the data to ranks (if they are not already ranks) and then performing the t-test on the transformed data, the version of the t-test used depending on whether or not the population variances are suspected to be different. Rank transformations do not preserve variances, but variances are recomputed from samples after rank transformations. The Brown‚ÄìForsythe test has been suggested as an appropriate non-parametric equivalent to the F-test for equal variances. See also Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test. Related test statistics=Kendall's tau The Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test is related to a number of other non-parametric statistical procedures. For example, it is equivalent to Kendall's tau correlation coefficient if one of the variables is binary (that is, it can only take two values). Software Implementations In many software packages, the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U test (of the hypothesis of equal distributions against appropriate alternatives) has been poorly documented. Some packages incorrectly treat ties or fail to document asymptotic techniques (e.g., correction for continuity). A 2000 review discussed some of the following packages: * MATLAB has ranksum in its Statistics Toolbox. * R's statistics base-package implements the test in its \\"stats\\" package. * The R package will calculate the z statistic for a Wilcoxon two-sample, paired, or one-sample test. * SAS implements the test in its PROC NPAR1WAY procedure. * Python (programming language) has an implementation of this test provided by SciPy * SigmaStat (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) * SYSTAT (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) * Java (programming language) has an implementation of this test provided by Apache Commons *Julia (programming language) has implementations of this test through several packages.

History The statistic appeared in a 1914 article by the German Gustav Deuchler (with a missing term in the variance). In a single paper in 1945, Frank Wilcoxon proposed both the one-sample signed rank and the two-sample rank sum test, in a test of significance with a point null-hypothesis against its complementary alternative (that is, equal versus not equal). However, he only tabulated a few points for the equal-sample size case in that paper (though in a later paper he gave larger tables). A thorough analysis of the statistic, which included a recurrence allowing the computation of tail probabilities for arbitrary sample sizes and tables for sample sizes of eight or less appeared in the article by Henry Mann and his student Donald Ransom Whitney in 1947. This article discussed alternative hypotheses, including a stochastic ordering (where the cumulative distribution functions satisfied the pointwise inequality ). This paper also computed the first four moments and established the limiting normality of the statistic under the null hypothesis, so establishing that it is asymptotically distribution-free.

Samba dancers at Rio Carnival in 2008. Samba was created by African people in Brazil from the music and dance culture they brought from Africa. Samba music is very similar to and has been influenced by many music genres, as well as many other Latin American music genres and dances. The term \\"samba\\" originally referred to any of several Latin duet dances with origins from the Congo and Angola. Today Samba is the most prevalent dance form in Brazil, and reaches the height of its importance during the festival of Carnaval. There is actually a set of dances, rather than a single dance, that define the Samba dancing scene in Brazil; however, no one dance can be claimed with certainty as the \\"original\\" Samba style. Besides Brazilian Samba, a major style of Samba is ballroom Samba, which differs significantly.  Etymology  There are many theories about the origin of the word \\"samba\\". One of the first references to \\"samba\\" was in Pernambuco magazine's O Carapuceiro, in February 1838. Father Miguel Lopes Gama of Sacramento wrote an article arguing against what he called \\"the samba d'almocreve\\", which was a type of dance drama popular with black people of that time. According to Hiram Ara√∫jo da Costa, over the centuries, the festival of dances of slaves in Bahia were called samba. During the mid-19th century, the word referred to several types of music made by African slaves. Samba further developed specific characteristics in each Brazilian state, not only due to the diversity of tribes of African immigrants, but also because of the distinctive cultures each region embodied. Some of these popular dances were known as Bai√£o,http://www.greatbrazilianmusic.com/forro.html Bochinche, Candombe (Candombl√©), Cat√™r√™t√™, Caxamb√∫, Choradinho, C√¥co-inch√°do, Cocumb√≠, C√≥rta-j√°ca, Curur√∫, Furrund√∫, Jongo, Lund√∫, Maracat√∫, Max√≠xe, Quimb√™te, S√£o- Gon√ßalo, Saramba; as well as the many varieties of the Portuguese Fandango, and the Indio dance Purac√©.  Styles =Samba no p√© A performer of Samba dance at Rio Carnival Samba no p√© (literally, \\"samba in the foot\\") is a solo dance that is commonly danced impromptu when samba music is played. The basic movement involves a straight body and a bending of one knee at a time. The feet move very slightly - only a few inches at a time. The rhythm is 2/4, with 3 steps per measure. It can be thought of as a step-ball-change. It can be described calling it and-a-one, and-a-two, then back to one. The basic movement is the same to either side, where one foot moves to the outside lifting up just before the first beat (i.e. the right leg moves slightly to the right) and leg is kept as straight as a pole. The other foot moves slightly towards the front, and closer to the first foot. The second leg bends lightly at the knee so that the left side of the hip lowers and the right side appears to move higher. The weight is shifted to this inside foot briefly for the next \\"and-a\\", then shifted back to the outside foot on the \\"two\\", and the same series of actions is repeated towards the other side. The dance simply follows the beat of the music and can go from average pace to very fast. Men dance with the whole foot on the ground while women, often wearing heels, dance just on the balls of the foot. Professionals may change the steps slightly, taking 4 steps per measure instead of 3, and often add various arm movements depending on the mood of the music. There are also regional forms of the dance in Brazil where the essential steps are the same, but because of a change in the accent of the music people will dance similar movements to the slightly changed accents. For instance, in Bahia the girls tend to dance tilting their legs towards the outside instead of keeping their knees close to each other as in Rio de Janeiro. This is the type of Samba one sees in the Brazilian Carnival parades and in other Samba carnivals over the world. This is also one of the most common type of samba dancing in Brazil. Samba de Gafieira Samba de Gafieira is a partner dance considerably different from the Ballroom Samba. It appeared in the 1940s and it gets its name from the gafieira, popular urban nightclubs of Rio de Janeiro at that time. The dance derived from the Maxixe and followed the arrival of the Choro (another samba musical style). It left most of the Maxixe's Polka elements behind but maintained the entwined leg movements of the Argentine tango, although adopting a more relaxed posture than the latter. Many see this form of Samba as a combination of Waltz and Tango. Several Brazilian dance studios use elements and techniques from these two dances to teach Samba de Gafieira steps and dance routines. Samba Pagode Samba Pagode is a Samba partner dance that resembles the Samba de Gafieira but tends to be more intimate. The literal meaning of the Portuguese word \\"pagode\\" translates to \\"fun\\" or \\"merrymaking\\". The word is also utilized to refer to an informal gathering of samba dancers along with their accompanying music. The three instruments typically used in Samba Pagode performances. A key feature of Samba Pagode is its rhythmic texture created with a variety of beats. It became a dance style after the appearance of the Pagode style of music, which originated in the Brazilian city of S√£o Paulo. The pagode style utilizes three specific percussion instruments: the tanta, the repique-de-mao, and the pandeiro. All three instruments are played by hand, which lends to creating a softer, more intimate sound than the batucada Samba performed by many Samba schools in Brazil. Pagode-like events have dated back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the emergence of urban Samba in Rio de Janeiro. Samba Ax√© Samba Ax√© is a solo dance that started in 1992 during the Brazilian Carnival season in Bahia when the Ax√© rhythm replaced the Lambada. For years it became the major type of dance for the North east of Brazil during the holiday months. The dance is completely choreographed and the movements tend to mimic the lyrics. It is very energetic and mixes elements of Samba no p√© and aerobics and because of the lyrics, which are made for entertainment, the dance generally has some sort of ludic element. Several Ax√© music groups such as \\"√â o Tchan\\" have as part of their marketing strategy to always release a choreography together with every one of their songs; therefore, Samba Ax√© is an ever-changing genre with no set of steps, routines or basic step. Samba- reggae Samba-reggae is a mix of reggae beats created by Samba drums. It is found in popular songs by the artist Daniela Mercury, who introduced the rhythm to the world with songs like \\"Sol da Liberdade\\" \\"O Reggae E O Mar\\" and \\"Perola Negra\\". Samba Reggae is a popular samba style in Bahia, with many followers in various parts of Brazil. Samba-reggae drummers performing during the Brazilian festival of Carnaval Samba-reggae has birthed a style of African-influenced dance which has been obtained from the styles of Afro- Brazilian and candomble dance. Within social settings, samba-reggae dances are often performed in a follow-the-leader manner, with a small number of advanced dancers initiating steps in a line in front of the crowd, and then the whole crowd subsequently following along. The percussionists of samba-reggae often dance while playing their drums as well. The third- and fourth drummers, known as surdos perform short choreographies, utilizing mallets to emphasize sharp arm movements. The fundos (the first and second surdos at the lead) often take center stage to showcase elaborate, deft mallet lifts and throws, and also toss their drums high overhead. Samba-rock Samba-rock is a playful form of the samba that originates from S√£o Paulo. It is a form of Latin nightclub dance. One of Samba-rock's first dance instructors, Mestre Ataliba, describes the essence of the dance style. \\"Dance wise, samba rock is about relaxation and concentration, all at once... It blends the African 'ginga' (body flow from Capoeira), which is present at the feet and the hips, and the European reference of the ballroom etiquette. We can dance it to the sound of Rita Pavone, samba pagode, reggae, R&B.; It really embraces every music culture\\". Samba de roda Samba de Roda, Salvador (\\"Samba of roda\\") is a traditional Afro-Brazilian dance performed originally as informal fun after a Candombl√© ceremony, using the same percussion instruments used during the religious ceremony. The typical drum is the atabaque; drummers improvise variations and elaborations on common patterns, accompanied typically by singing and clapping as well as dancing. The Samba de Roda is a celebratory event incorporating music, choreography and poetry. The term \\"Samba\\" encompassed many different rhythms, tunes, drumming and dances of various periods and areas of the Brazilian territory. It appeared in the state of Bahia, more specifically in the region of Rec√¥ncavo in Brazil, during the 17th century. Because all drumming and dance was generalized by Portuguese colonizers as \\"samba\\", it is difficult to attribute it to one distinct heritage. However, the most universally recognized cultural origin of Samba is Lundu, a rhythm that was brought to Brazil by the Bantu slaves from Africa. Lundu reveals, in a way, the amalgamation of black (slaves) and white (Portuguese) and indigenous cultures. When the African slaves where imported, it was named the \\"semba\\" and with the introduction of the Arabic Pandeiro (tambourine), brought into the Roda by the Portuguese, the \\"Samba\\" was molded into the form of dance it is now. In the indigenous language, \\"samba\\" means roda de dan√ßa, or a circle to dance since the indigenous peoples danced in celebration on many occasions, such as the celebration of popular Catholic festivals, Amerindian or Afro- Brazilian religious ceremonies, but was also practiced at random. All participants, including beginners, are invited to join the dance and observe as well as imitate. Usually, only the women dance after each other and they are surrounded by others dancing in a circle and clapping their hands. The choreography is often spontaneous and is based on movements of the feet, legs and hips. One of the most typical moves is the umbigada which is clear Bantu influence, where the dancer invites her successor into the circle's center. The factor that frequently draws the attention of most people to the rhythm is the unusually-accented (syncopated) beat. The absent beat is the strongest characteristic of Samba prompting the listener to dance to fill the gap with her/his body movements. This syncopated rhythm is also an indication of Black resistance against cultural assimilation. The Samba of Roda in particular was considered an expression of freedom and identity of the underprivileged and became a means of liberation. The Samba de Roda has significantly waned during the twentieth century due to economic decline and increased poverty in the region. The effects of mass media and competition from popular modern music have also devalued this tradition among the younger generation. Finally, the weakening of the Samba de Roda was heightened through the aging of practitioners and demise of those who made the musical instruments.

Extended by order of the later King Frederick I of Prussia according to plans by Andreas Schl√ºter from 1689 to 1713, it was considered as a major work of Prussian Baroque architecture.Georg Dehio: Handbuch der Deutschen Kunstdenkm√§ler, Berlin. Deutscher Kunstverlag, Munich 2006, , p. 63. (German) The former royal palace was one of Berlin‚Äôs largest buildings and shaped the cityscape with its -high dome. Damaged during the Allied bombing in World War II, it was demolished by the East German authorities in 1950. After German reunification, the Berlin Palace is being rebuilt as Humboldt Forum.  Overview  National Memorial to emperor Wilhelm I, around 1900 The Renaissance residence in the 17th century (as painted by Abraham Begeyn) The Berlin Palace, also incorrectly known as the City Palace (), is a building in the center of Berlin, located on the Museum Island at Schlossplatz opposite the Lustgarten park. From the 15th century to the early 20th century, the Berliner Schloss was a royal and imperial palace that mostly served as the main residence of the Electors of Brandenburg, the Kings of Prussia, and the German Emperors. Demolished by the East German government in the 1950s, the palace is being rebuilt, with completion expected in 2020. The reconstructed palace will be the seat of the Humboldt Forum, a museum for world culture which is a successor museum of the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber, which was also located in the 19th century-Berlin Palace. The Humboldt Forum has been described as the German equivalent of the British Museum. The palace was originally built in the 15th century, but had changed in form throughout the next few centuries. It bore features of the Baroque style; its shape, which had been finalized by the mid-18th century, is for the most part attributed to German architect Andreas Schl√ºter, whose first design is likely to date from 1702, even though the palace incorporated earlier parts as seen in 1688 by Nicodemus Tessin. It served as a residence to various Electors of Brandenburg. It was the principal residence and winter residence of the Hohenzollern Kings of Prussia from 1701 to 1918. After the unification of Germany in 1871, it also became the central residence for the German Emperors, who also served as the Kings of Prussia. After the proclamation of the Weimar Republic in 1918, the palace became a museum. In World War II, the building was heavily damaged by Allied bombings. Although it could have been repaired, the palace was demolished in 1950 by the German Democratic Republic authorities, despite criticism. In the 1970s, the Palace of the Republic was constructed on its site, but controversially demolished in 2008 to make place for the reconstruction of the old palace. Following the reunification of Germany, it was decided to rebuild the entire exterior of the palace in the original style except for the east side. The authentically reconstructed facades will include various remnant sculptures and stones of the original palace. The interior will be modern, except the facades of one of the courts which is constructed in original style (Schl√ºterhof). The floorplan has been designed to allow future reconstruction of notable historical rooms. The building will house the Humboldtforum museum and congress complex, and is scheduled to be finished in 2020. History up to 1871 Schenk) Gaertner's depiction of Schl√ºterhof (1830) Aerial view of the Stadtschloss, circa 1905‚Äì1925 The palace replaced an earlier fort or castle guarding the crossing of the Spree river at C√∂lln, a neighboring town which merged with Berlin in 1710. The castle stood on Fishers' Island, as the southern end of the Museum Island in the Spree is known. In 1443 Frederick II \\"Irontooth\\", Margrave and Prince Elector of Brandenburg, laid the foundations of Berlin's first fortification in a section of swampy wasteland north of C√∂lln. At the completion of the castle in 1451, Frederick moved there from the town of Brandenburg. The main role of the castle and its garrison in this period was to establish the authority of the Margraves over the unruly citizens of Berlin, who were reluctant to give up their medieval privileges to a monarchy. In 1415 King Sigismund had enfeoffed the Hohenzollern princes with Brandenburg, and they were now establishing their power and withdrawing electoral privileges which the cities had attained in the Brandenburg interregnum of 1319‚Äì1415. The castle also included a chapel. In 1454 Frederick II, after having returned via Rome from his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, made the castle chapel a parish church, richly endowing it with relics and altars.Ingo Materna and Wolfgang Ribbe, Geschichte in Daten ‚Äì Brandenburg, Munich and Berlin: Koehler & Amelang, 1995, p. 68. . Pope Nicholas V ordered Stephan Bodecker, then Prince-Bishop of Brandenburg, to consecrate the Chapel to Erasmus of Formiae.Wolfgang Gottschalk, Altberliner Kirchen in historischen Ansichten, W√ºrzburg: Weidlich, 1985, p. 171. On 7 April 1465, at Frederick's request, Pope Paul II attributed to St Erasmus Chapel a canon-law College named Stift zu Ehren Unserer Lieben Frauen, des heiligen Kreuzes, St. Petri und Pauli, St. Erasmi und St. Nicolai. This collegiate church became the nucleus of today's Evangelical Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church, adjoining the site of the castle. In 1538, the Margrave Joachim II demolished the palace and engaged the master builder Caspar Theiss to build a new and grander building in the Italian Renaissance style. After the Thirty Years War (1618‚Äì1648), Frederick William (1620‚Äì1688), the \\"Great Elector\\", embellished the palace further. In 1688, Nicodemus Tessin designed courtyard arcades with massive columns in front. Not much is known about the alterations of 1690‚Äì1695, when Johann Nering was the court architect. Martin Gr√ºnberg continued the alterations in 1695‚Äì1699. In 1699, the Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg (who took the title King in Prussia in 1701, becoming Frederick I), appointed the architect Andreas Schl√ºter to execute a \\"second plan\\" in the Italian manner. Schl√ºter's first design probably dates from 1702; he planned to rebuild the palace in the Protestant Baroque style. His overall concept in the shape of a regular cube enclosing a magnificently ornamented courtyard was retained by all the building directors who succeeded him. In 1706, Schl√ºter was replaced by Johann Friedrich Eosander von G√∂the, who designed the western extension of the palace, doubling its size. In all essentials, Schl√ºter's balanced, rhythmic composition of the fa√ßades was retained, but G√∂the moved the main entrance to the new west wing. Berliner Schloss was the original location for the Amber Room, but Peter the Great of Russia admired it during a visit and in 1716 Frederick William I presented the room to Peter as a gift. Frederick William I, who became king in 1713, was interested mainly in building up Prussia as a military power, and dismissed most of the craftsmen working on the Stadtschloss. As a result, G√∂the's plan was only partly carried out. Nevertheless, the exterior of the palace had come close to its final form by the mid-18th century. The final stage was the erection of the dome in 1845, during the reign of Frederick William IV. The dome was built by Friedrich August St√ºler after a design by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. Subsequent major works were limited to the interior, engaging the talents of Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, Carl von Gontard and many others. The Stadtschloss was itself the epicenter of the Revolution of 1848 in Prussia. Huge crowds gathered outside the palace to present an \\"address to the king\\" containing their demands for a constitution, liberal reform and German unification. Frederick William emerged from the palace to accept their demands. On 18 March, a large demonstration outside the Stadtschloss led to bloodshed and the outbreak of street fighting. Frederick William later reneged on his promises and reimposed an autocratic regime. From that time onwards, many Berliners and other Germans came to see the Stadtschloss as a symbol of oppression and \\"Prussian militarism\\". Later history The portrait gallery of the palace In 1871, King William I was elevated to the status of Emperor (Kaiser) of a united Germany, and the Stadtschloss became the symbolic heart of the German Empire. The Empire was (in theory) a constitutional state, and from 1894 onwards, the new Reichstag building, the seat of the German parliament came to not only rival but overshadow the Stadtschloss as the Empire's center of power. In conjunction with Germany's defeat in World War I, William II was forced to abdicate both as German Emperor and as King of Prussia. In November 1918, the Spartacist leader, Karl Liebknecht, declared the German Socialist Republic from a balcony of the Stadtschloss, ending more than 400 years of royal occupation of the building. During the Weimar Republic, parts of the Stadtschloss were turned into a museum, while other parts continued to be used for receptions and other state functions. Under Adolf Hitler's National Socialist (Nazi) Party, which laid to rest monarchist hopes of a Hohenzollern restoration, the building was mostly ignored. During World War II, the Stadtschloss was twice struck by Allied bombs: on 3 February and 24 February 1945. On the latter occasion, when both the air defenses and fire-fighting systems of Berlin had been destroyed, the building was struck by incendiaries, lost its roof, and was largely burnt out. The end of the war saw the Stadtschloss a burned-out shell of its former glory, although the building had remained structurally sound and much of its interior decoration was still preserved. It could have been restored, as many other bombed-out buildings in central Berlin later were. The area in which it was located was within the Soviet Union zone, which became the German Democratic Republic. The building was used for a Soviet war movie (\\"the Battle of Berlin\\") in which the Stadtschloss served as a backdrop, with live artillery shells fired at it for the realistic cinematic impact.Renate Petras, Das Schloss in Berlin: Von der Revolution 1918 bis zur Vernichtung 1950, Berlin: Verlag Bauwesen, 1999, p. 110. The site of the City Palace in 2007, with the Palast der Republik being demolished. The new socialist government declared the Stadtschloss a symbol of Prussian militarism, although at that time there appeared to be no plans to destroy the building. Some parts of it were in fact repaired and used from 1945 to 1950 as an exhibition space. A secret 1950 GDR Ministry of Construction report, only rediscovered in 2016, calculated that reconstruction of the damaged Palace could be achieved for 32 million GDR marks. But in July 1950 Walter Ulbricht, the new General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, announced the demolition of the palace. Despite objections, its removal commenced in September 1950, the process taking four months and consuming 19 tons of dynamite. So solid was its construction that the dome and its entire mount remained intact even after it is fell to the ground.Photo: K√∂hler, Gustav; 15 October 1950; Bundesarchiv, Bild 183-08 103-0025 Only one section was preserved, a portal from the balcony from which Karl Liebknecht had declared the German Socialist Republic. It was later added to the Council of State building (Staatsratsgeb√§ude), with an altered cartouche, where it forms the main entrance. The empty space where the Stadtschloss had stood was named Marx-Engels-Platz and used as a parade ground. Liebknecht's balcony in the State Council Building (Staatsratsgeb√§ude) (today's ESMT European School of Management and Technology) In 1964, the GDR built a new Staatsrat or Council of State building on part of the site, incorporating Liebknecht's balcony in its facade. From 1973 to 1976, during the government of Erich Honecker, a large modernist building was built, the Palast der Republik (Palace of the Republic), which occupied most of the site of the former Stadtschloss. Shortly before German reunification in October 1990, the Palast der Republik was found to be contaminated with asbestos and was closed to the public. After reunification, the Berlin city government ordered the removal of the asbestos, a process which was completed by 2003. In November 2003, the German federal government decided to demolish the building and leave the area as parkland pending a decision as to its ultimate future. Demolition started in February 2006 and was completed in 2009. East Germans resented the demolition, especially those for whom the Palace of the Republic had been a place of fond memories, or who felt a sense of dislocation in a post-communist world. From 2008 until the commencement of construction in 2013, the large area of the original Schlossplatz became a grassed field, laid out on minimal lines with wooden platforms. At the same time, the Berlin Monument Authority (Landesdenkmalamt) undertook extensive archaeological excavations. Parts of cellars that had been situated in the south-west corner of the former Palace were discovered and it was decided these would be preserved and made accessible to visitors as an \\"archaeological window\\".  Reconstruction =The debate Fa√ßade trial Following reunification a 20-year-long debate commenced as to whether the palace should be reconstructed, and whether this should be in part or whole. Pro-reconstruction lobby groups argued that the rebuilding of the Stadtschloss would restore the unity and integrity of the historic center of Berlin, which includes the Berliner Dom, the Lustgarten and the museums of Museum Island. Opponents of the project included those who advocated the retention of the Palast der Republik on the grounds that it was itself of historical significance; those who argued that the area should become a public park; and those who believed that a new building would be a pastiche of former architectural styles; would be an unwelcome symbol of Germany's imperial past; and would be unacceptably expensive for no definite economic benefit. They also argued that it would be impossible to accurately reconstruct the exterior or interiors of the building, since neither detailed plans nor the necessary craft skills are available. Others disputed this, claiming that sufficient photographic documentation of both existed when it was converted to a museum following 1918. The ideological divide was epitomized by the two following groups. The Association for the Preservation of the Palace of the Republic (Verein zur Erhaltung des Palastes der Republik) championed a renovation of the GDR building that would incorporate a re-creation of the principal western facade the City Place, for a multipurpose \\"people's center\\" similar to the Pompidou Center in Paris. The Berlin City Palace Sponsoring Association (F√∂rderverein Berliner Stadtschlo√ü) argued for complete external reconstruction of the City Palace, as they considered it the only option that would restore the esthetic and historic ensemble of Berlin's heart.Goebe,Rolf J. Berlin's Architectural Citations: Reconstruction, Simulation, and the Problem of Historical Authenticity, PMLA, Modern Language Association of America, 2003 It also rejected suggestions that the proposed meticulous reconstruction would be an unauthentic 'Disney' replica, drawing attention to the fact that most centuries-old stone buildings are, by dint of aging and repair, at least partial reconstructions; and that the argument that the present time can only represent itself in its own architectural language, is simply ideology. It also drew attention to the Venice Charter observation that \\"historic edifices have a material age and an immaterial significance\\" ‚Äì an importance that transcends time, and justifies their reconstruction to preserve a vital part of urban identity and historical memory, provided that sufficient documentation for a truly authentic copy exists. Towards construction The dome of the palace with a cross, installed on May 29, 2020 An important driving force behind the reconstruction was businessman Wilhelm von Boddien.Frederick Studemann, 'Berlin‚Äôs Stadtschloss and the trouble with history', Financial Times, 14 September 2019Whitney, Craig R. . \\"A Berlin Palace Stirs in Its Grave\\". The New York Times, 12 July 1993. In 1992, he and Kathleen King von AlvenslebenAmid Squabbling, Berlin to Reveal Imperial Palace Design, DW, 27 November 2008 founded, what evolved to be the Berlin City Palace Sponsoring Association ‚Äì which became the most influential lobby group. The Association accumulated plans that had been believed lost, and funded a research project at the Technical University of Berlin to measure surviving photos and drawings of the Palace to create precise architectural plans. In 1993, on the world's largest scaffolding assembly, it audaciously erected a trompe-l'oeil mockup of two frontages of the Stadtschloss facade on a 1:1 scale on plastic sheeting. Privately funded by donations and sponsorship, this coup de th√©√¢tre stood for a year and half. Showing a vision of central Berlin lost for fifty years, and how the palace could provide the missing link to the historical ensemble of the Zeughaus, the Altes Museum, and the Berlin Cathedral, the spectacle brought the debate to a temporary climax in 1993/4. While opinion continued to remain divided, the association succeeded in winning over many politicians and other key figures to its efforts. Construction work, November 2018 In view of the previous opposition, including high cost, and most importantly, the psychological and political objections, successive German governments had declined to commit themselves to the project. However, by 2002 and 2003 cross-party resolutions of the Bundestag (German parliament) reached a compromise to support at least a partial rebuilding of the Stadtschloss. In 2007, the Bundestag made a definitive decision about the reconstruction. According to this compromise, which had been drawn up by a commission, three fa√ßades of the palace would be rebuilt, but the interior would be a modern structure to serve as a cultural museum and forum. An architectural competition was held, and in 2008 the jury chose the submission by Italian architect Franco Stella.Werning, Remei Capdevila From Berliner Stadtschloss to Humboldt-Box and Back Again: Architecture in the Conditional, Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona Some of the internal spaces in Stella's design follow the exact proportions of the original state rooms of the palace; this would allow for their reconstruction at a later date should this be desired. The reconstruction also reproduces the original meter-thick width of the outer walls. These have been rebuilt as a sandwiched construction as follows: an inner retaining wall of concrete, followed by a layer of insulation, and an outer wall of brick, sandstone and stucco which replicates the original. Reconstruction of the Renaissance-gabled Pharmacy Wing, which connected to the Stadtschloss on the north side, would be another possible future project. Panorama of how the finished reconstruction will look. Due to German government budget cuts, construction of the \\"Humboldtforum\\", as the new palace was titled, was delayed. The foundation stone was finally laid by President Joachim Gauck in a ceremony on 12th of June 2013 which heralded the launch of a ‚Ç¨590M reconstruction project. In 2017, there was a debate whether to feature a cross on the dome of the palace, in relation to adhering historical accuracy or secularism. Afterwards, a statue of Antinous was installed on the palace facade in the Schl√ºterhof courtyard. However, the cross was installed on the top of the dome on May 29, 2020. On completion in 2020, the building will house a modern museum containing collections of African and other non-European art, as well as two restaurants, a theater, a movie theater, and an auditorium.

He was deeply involved in the impeachment proceedings against Dr Henry Sacheverell in 1710, and his work on the impeachment is said to have contributed to his early demise. Early life Dolben was the younger son of John Dolben, Archbishop of York , and his wife Catherine Sheldon, daughter of Ralph Sheldon of Stanton, Staffordshire, and niece of Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, and was baptised in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, on 1 July 1662. He was educated at Westminster School where he is listed as a pupil in 1676, and with the encouragement of his uncle Sir William Dolben, Recorder of London, was admitted at Inner Temple in 1677. He also matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1678 but is not recorded as a graduate. From 1682 to 1683, he travelled abroad in France. By December 1683, he married Elizabeth Mulso, second daughter and co-heiress of Tanfield Mulso of Finedon Hall, Northamptonshire and his wife Mary Luther. Her portrait was once attributed to Sir Peter Lely, but is now thought to be the work of John Riley, completed after his death by John Closterman. He was called to the bar in 1684. Dolben, whose father died in April 1686, squandered his inheritance on gambling. He also squandered his wife's fortune, selling his moiety of the manor of Finedon around this time to his elder brother, Sir Gilbert Dolben, 1st Baronet, who had married John's sister-in-law, Anne Mulso. In 1691, Sir Gilbert wrote that John's wife and children were reduced to living on the charity of friends. He also complained that their father's memory was being unfairly traduced, as critics said that John's conduct was the result of a bad upbringing. Sir William Dolben, who had intended to leave a legacy to John Dolben, was so outraged by his profligacy that he cut him out of his will, and settled the legacy in trust for John's children. Career In 1692, Dolben moved to the East Indies, where he became judge-advocate for the East India Company in Bengal and was later a friend of Thomas Pitt, the Governor. He was able to profit by the trading opportunities available to repair his fortune. He went on a voyage to China in 1699 with one of Pitt's sons. By July 1701, he returned to England and corresponded with Pitt on the affairs of the East India Companies. In about 1702 he went back to the East Indies until 1706. Back in England, he was trusted by Pitt to conduct his affairs. Dolben was returned as Member of Parliament for Liskeard on the interest of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet, Bishop of Winchester at a by-election on 21 November 1707. He immediately proved to be a conscientious MP, and was active on ten committees. Most important of these was the bill to extend the East India Company Act and he was particularly concerned in uniting the two East India companies. He put forward a proposal which involved increasing the company's loan to the government by ¬£200,000 and the bill passed into law. He was suspected of working towards replacing Pitt as Governor, but after he reported to Pitt the successful unification of the two companies, he noted that the Company were enraged at the extra sum which he was seen being responsible for imposing on them. At the 1708 British general election Dolben was returned unopposed for Liskeard again and continued to be very active. He was named to nine drafting committees, including the bill to prevent wagers relating to the public. In spite of this, Dolben himself was still an avid gambler and was forecast to be required to make another trip to the Indies to recover his fortune. He managed a bill to establish a company trading to Africa, and was a teller for the Whigs on ten occasions. He voted for of naturalizing the German Palatines in 1709 and was trustee for poor Palatines. It was Dolben who first raised the issue of Dr Sacheverell's printed sermons on 13 December 1709, moving that the House should take the matter into consideration, and that the sermons should be voted 'malicious, scandalous and seditious libels'. In the debate on the next day, he moved that Sacheverell should be impeached. He was appointed to the committee to draw up the articles of impeachment, and acted as chairman. At the trial itself he acted as one of the managers. He got into some difficulties from his conduct during the trial, while the mob threatened to burn down his house and hang him on a tree . At Liskeard the mob pulled down the clock which he had presented to the town. As well as showing great energy in this role, he was active in other Parliamentary business, including sitting on committees and telling for the Whigs. He was also a appointed a Director of the Bank of England in 1710. Literature of the Sacheverell trial Among the pamphlets relating to Dolben are: * A Letter written by Mr. J. Dolbin to Dr. Henry Sacheverell, and left by him with a friend at Epsom, 1710, p. 16; composed as a letter of repentance. * A true Defence of Henry Sacheverell, D.D., in a Letter to Mr. D‚Äî‚Äîn [Dolben]. By S. M. N. O., 1710. * An Elegy on the lamented Death of John Dolben. * The Life and Adventures of John Dolben, 1710, pp. 16. Later life and legacy Dolben worked himself to the point where his health gave way, and he retired to the country. He also gave up the directorship of the Bank of England. He then contracted a fever, and it was said he was worse treated by his physicians than by the mob, and died on 29 May 1710, unlamented by Dr Sacheverell‚Äôs friends. He was buried in Finedon Church under a large grey-marble tombstone. His two sons died abroad in his lifetime (William, the elder, whose portrait was painted by Godfrey Kneller in 1709 and engraved by Smith in 1710, dying in 1709, aged 20), and Mary, one of his three daughters, died on 24 June 1710, aged 8. His widow survived until 4 March 1736. Their two surviving daughters, Anne and Catherine, were married in Westminster Abbey. Anne married the politician Gilbert Affleck of Dalham Hall, Suffolk, and Catherine married Samuel Whitelocke, grandson of Bulstrode Whitelocke.

Beck drew up the diagram in his spare time while working as an engineering draftsman at the London Underground Signals Office. London Underground was initially sceptical of Beck's radical proposal, an uncommissioned spare-time project, but tentatively introduced it to the public in a small pamphlet in 1933. It was immediately popular, and the Underground has used topological maps to illustrate the network ever since.  London Underground map  Map of underground lines, 1908  Before Beck  Prior to the Beck diagram (the underground map that he created), the various underground lines had been laid out geographically, often superimposed over the roadway of a city map. This meant the centrally located stations were shown very close together and the out-of-town stations spaced far apart. From around 1909 a new type of 'map' appeared inside the train cars; it was a non-geographic linear diagram, in most cases a simple straight horizontal line, which equalized the distances between stations. By the late 1920s most Underground lines and some mainline (especially LNER) services displayed these, many of which had been drawn by George Dow. Some writers and broadcasters have speculated that Dow's maps partly inspired Beck's work. The geographical-based map, used immediately prior to Beck, in 1932, was produced by the underground map designer for the period 1926‚Äì1932, F. H. Stingemore. It was Stingemore's idea to slightly expand the central area of the map for ease of reading. Beck's Underground Map of 1933  Beck's concept  It was however Beck who had the idea of creating a full system map in colour. He believed that Underground passengers were not concerned with geographical accuracy and were more interested in how to get from one station to another and where to change trains. While drawing an electrical circuit diagram, Beck came up with a new idea for a map that was based upon the concept of an electrical schematic on which all the stations were more-or-less equally spaced rather than a geographic map. Beck first submitted his idea to Frank Pick of London Underground in 1931 but it was considered too radical because it did not show distances relative from any one station to the others. The design was therefore rejected by the Publicity department at first, but the designer persisted. So, after a successful trial of 500 copies in 1932, distributed via a few select stations, the map was given its first full publication in 1933 (700,000 copies). The positive reaction from customers proved it was a sound design, and a large reprint was required after only one month. It is suggested by Degani (2013) that one of the configuration techniques employed by Beck was that of an \\"underlying grid\\". In some cases the vertical and horizontal grid units are equalised, but on the whole the grid is rectilinear. The result is a \\"relaxed grid ... which has a certain rhythm and charm ‚Äì somewhat similar to the grid used by modern artists (e.g. Piet Mondrian's painting Composition With Yellow, Blue and Red, 1937‚Äì42.)\\"  The map after Beck  The modern Tube map, based on the simplified topological design invented by Beck Beck tried to regain control of the map, threatening legal action until 1965, \\"bitter and betrayed by the very organisation he had helped, so admirably, to promote.\\" In 1997, Beck's importance was posthumously recognised, and currently (2018) the statement 'This diagram is an evolution of the original design conceived in 1931 by Harry Beck' is printed on every London Underground map.  Design Icon  As part of the Transported by Design programme of activities, on 15 October 2015, after two months of public voting, Harry Beck's tube map was elected by Londoners as number 3 of the 10 favourite transport design icons.  Other works  In 1938 he produced a diagram of the entire rail system of the London region (as far as St Albans in the north, Ongar in the north east, Romford in the east, Bromley in the south east, Mitcham in the south, Hinchley Wood in the south west, Ashford in the west, and Tring in the north west). It included both the Underground and mainlines. It was not published at the time but was seen in Ken Garland's book, first published in 1994; it took until 1973 until any official attempt was made to replicate a rail diagram for the entire London region. Beck produced at least one map for British Railways. After nationalisation, the Eastern Region commissioned Beck to produce a map of the suburban lines out of Marylebone, King's Cross, Liverpool Street and Fenchurch Street, similar in scope to earlier maps produced by George Dow for the London & North Eastern Railway. Beck produced at least two versions of a diagram for the Paris M√©tro. The project, which Beck was never commissioned to do, may have been begun, according to Ken Garland, as early as before the start of World War II. A version dating from approximately 1946 is published in Garland's book. His second version is published for the first time in Mark Ovenden's book about the Paris M√©tro.  Recognition  Finchley Central Underground station According to some accounts, Beck was never formally commissioned to develop his initial idea and worked on the map only in his spare time. He was thus never actually paid for the map. Other sources report that he was paid a fee of five or ten guineas. After long failing to acknowledge Beck's importance as the original designer of the Tube map, London Regional Transport finally created the Beck gallery at the London Transport Museum in the early 1990s, where his works are displayed. A commemorative plaque was installed at Finchley Central Underground station. Beck's home at 60 Court House Road, Finchley was marked with a plaque by the Finchley Society in 2003. In March 2006 viewers of BBC2's The Culture Show and visitors to London's Design Museum voted Harry Beck's Tube map as their second-favourite British design of the 20th century in the Great British Design Quest. The winner was Concorde. GB Railfreight named locomotive 66721 after Beck in January 2007. In January 2009 the Royal Mail included Beck's map when it issued a set of postage stamps celebrating British design classics. In March 2013 a blue plaque was unveiled on the house where Beck was born, in Wesley Road in Leyton, to mark the 80th anniversary of the Tube map.

Life He was the grandson of Henry Sinclair, 1st Earl of Orkney, and the son of Henry Sinclair, 2nd Earl of Orkney and Egidia Douglas. His father Henry, who had been a de facto Jarl of Orkney, died in 1420; William travelled to Copenhagen in 1422 to establish his claim to the Jarldom, but David Menzies was appointed instead, to rule as William's guardian until he came of age. In 1424, William succeeded in wresting de facto control of the earldom from his guardian, but it was not until 1434 that he was acknowledged as Jarl of Orkney by King Eric. In 1446 he laid the foundation stone of the Collegiate Church of St Matthew, commonly referred to as Rosslyn Chapel. After the death of childless King Christopher of Norway in 1448, Earl William was mentioned as a possible candidate for the vacant throne, as the jarl of Orkney was the highest ranking nobleman in Norway. However, there are no indications that he pursued this claim. For a time William was protector of the young James Stewart, the later James I of Scotland. He was Lord High Admiral of Scotland, and was Lord Chancellor of Scotland from 1454 to 1456. He became the first Lord St. Clair in Scotland in 1449. In 1468, King James III of Scotland married Margaret, daughter of King Christian I of Norway. Christian was unable to immediately provide a dowry. Instead, he promised that dowry would be provided at a later date, pledging the territory of the Jarldom of Orkney as security for his promise. In 1470, James III offered William the castle and lands of Ravenscraig in Fife,} in return for William quitclaiming his rights in Orkney and Shetland, an offer William accepted. The Norse jarldom technically remained in existence, but William now only had authority over the mainland parts - Caithness and Sutherland. In 1472, it having become clear that the dowry was unlikely to be paid, James declared the Jarldom's territory to be forfeit to the Scottish Crown, to which it was annexed by an Act of the Scottish Parliament, on 20 February. William now wielded his authority under the king of Scotland, rather than of Norway. Exchanging his inherited lordship of Nithsdale for lands in Caithness, William was granted the hereditary title Earl of Caithness. He resigned the Earldom in favour of his son William in 1476, and lived another 8 years. Family William Sinclair was married three times: firstly to Lady Elizabeth Douglas, daughter of Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas; secondly to Marjory Sutherland (married 1456), daughter of Alexander Sutherland of Dunbeath; and thirdly to Janet Yeman. By Lady Elizabeth Douglas he had the following children: * William Sinclair, 2nd Lord St. Clair was, in the opinion of the father, a wastrel, wherefore he was disinherited. His family received only Ravenscraig Castle in Fife. * Lady Catherine Sinclair, who married Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany. * Elizabeth Sinclair, who married Andrew, Master of Rothes By Marjory Sutherland he had the following children: *Sir Oliver Sinclair, who received the Barony of Roslin. *William Sinclair, 2nd Earl of Caithness (b. 1460 - d. 1513) *Alexander Sinclair (c. 1454) *George Sinclair (c. 1453) *Robert Sinclair (1447) *Arthur Sinclair (c. 1452) *Lady Eleanor Sinclair (b. 1457- d. 1518), who married John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl. *Lady Elizabeth Sinclair (b. c. 1455 - d. 1498), who married the Laird of Houston. *Lady Margaret Sinclair (c. 1450), who married David Boswell of Balmuto. *Lady Katherine Sinclair (b. 1440 - d. 1479) *Lady Susan Sinclair (c. 1451) *Lady Marjory Sinclair (1455‚Äì80), married Andrew Leslie, Master of Rothes. With Andrew she had issue including William Leslie, 3rd Earl of Rothes *Lady Mariota Sinclair (c. 1455) *Lady Euphemia Sinclair (c. 1470), who married John Kincaid Laird of Warriston. Illegitimate: *Sir David Sinclair of Sumburgh, died 1507. The earl's second son of his second marriage, William Sinclair, became the designated heir of the Earldom of Caithness, and continued that title. The Barony of Roslin went to his first son by that marriage, Sir Oliver Sinclair. All in all, the Sinclair ancestry is well and thoroughly represented in Scottish and British high nobility, thanks to the marriages of his daughters and other descendants. William's daughter of his second marriage, Lady Eleanor Sinclair, married John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl, a relative of the kings of Scotland. Lord Henry Darnley and his son, King James VI of Scotland, descended from Eleanor, and through them, many Royal houses of Europe. His other daughter by this marriage, Katherine Sinclair, married Alexander Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany, a nephew of the 1st Earl of Atholl.

Early history Ives was founded in Plymouth, Connecticut by Edward Ives, a descendant of Plymouth colony governor William Bradford. The company initially produced paper dolls whose limbs moved in response to hot air, but soon began producing a wide range of toys, including a toy cannon that shot using real gunpowder and clockwork powered dolls and animals that could move. The clockwork toys were designed by Jerome Secor, Nathan Warner, and Arthur Hotchkiss and by the 1880s, Ives was a leading producer of these toys. Ives model railroad locomotive, circa 1912 Its emphasis shifted to trains as its designs were copied by other toymakers who were willing to sell them more cheaply. Ives' trains were made of tin or cast iron and initially powered by clockwork, but like later electric trains, some models could whistle and smoke. On December 22, 1900, a disastrous fire struck and destroyed the Ives & Williams Company main factory destroying the building and all the patterns, parts and tools for manufacturing the cast-iron toys. The fire prompted a re- design by William R. Haberlin for 1901 that resulted in Ives' first toy train that ran on track. In 1901, The Ives Manufacturing Company, in rented space from William R. Haberlin and Timothy F. Hayes, began producing the first \\"O\\" gauge trains in the United States to run on fabricated sectional track. The trains were powered by clockwork machinery inside the toy, and sales for the year totaled $2,600.00. During that year and 1902, the die stamping production of trains, cars and track was subcontracted out to Haberlin and Hayes Bridgeport Tool & Die.Made in the Ives Shops (1991) by Gerard A. Robinson, D.D.S. In the end the fire benefited the Ives Manufacturing Company, as the insurance money permitted it to build a modern factory with state-of-the-art tooling. Although several companies were selling electric trains at the time, Ives opted to remain with clockwork, partly because many U.S. homes still lacked electricity. Initially, Ives' greatest competition came from German imports, and not from domestic manufacturers. Ives' response was with marketing, which it directed at its target audience, the twelve-year-old boy. Its campaigns addressed boys as business partners, telling them that the success of Ives' fictional railroad, Ives Railway Lines, depended on their shrewd management. This worked, building brand loyalty. William R. Haberlin William R. Haberlin is the man who made all of the tools and dies for the original Ives O-gauge (\\"O\\" gauge) clockwork train line in 1901! Everything (Except the patterns for the iron locomotives bodies, which were made by Charles A. Hotchkiss, mentioned in Model Craftsman - March 1944, and the clockwork mechanisms themselves, manufactured by an outside company (The Reeves Manufacturing Company in New Haven, Connecticut and later in Milford, Connecticut) that went into this line was tooled up by Mr. Haberlin, and his partner, T.F. Hayes (Timothy F. Hayes), in their tool shop, the Hayes & Haberlin Machine Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The work included the first tools and machinery ever built in the United States for manufacturing tinplate track. The first year, as Ives was in a hurry to get track, a set of drop-hammers were made up for the rails and ties. The tinplate was first cut up into strips, and then placed under the drop-hammer. The next year Mr. Haberlin and Mr. Hayes made up regular dies for use in a punch press, which would cut the rails and ties out of sheet tin. Thirty thousand rails could be made in a day; a working day in 1902 being ten hours. Ives did not make a machine for rolling their rails until somewhat later (In 1907-1908, after Haberlin had left the Ives' Manufacturing Company to work for Sir Thomas Edison as a toolmaker/machinist with his brother John E. Haberlin in Edison's laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey). A little later, Mr. Haberlin went to work for Ives entirely, selling them his tool shop (Hayes & Haberlin Machine Company), and as tool maker, designed and made all of their early dies. In 1906, Mr. Haberlin left Ives and started making up dies for himself, founding, on April 6, 1907, the American Miniature Railway Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut (which was both Ives' and Haberlin's hometown), until recently one of the least known of the early American tinplate manufacturers. They continued in business, making a line similar (because Haberlin was the first to have designed and invented it) to Ives, until 1912.Model Craftsman, April 1944 \\"Along the Tinplate Track: A Department for Tinplaters\\" by Louis Hertz Electric trains Ives released its first electric trains in 1910, partially in response to companies such as American Flyer undercutting its prices on clockwork trains. Ives initially produced electric trains in O gauge and 1 gauge. Ives' train sales continued to decline in the face of increasing competition and Lionel's greater momentum, the latter having released its first electric trains nearly a decade earlier. Meanwhile, construction toys were gaining in popularity, so in an effort to re-diversify, Ives released a Meccano and Erector Set-like construction toy in 1913 named Struktiron. Although it offered parts its competition did not, the set was not very successful and Ives withdrew it from the market in 1917. World War I had mixed effects on the company. On one hand, it eliminated imports from Germany, increasing Ives' share of the market. However, Ives' geographic location made it difficult to bring in the materials it needed to make trains, and also made shipping finished products difficult. Lionel and American Flyer, being headquartered in New York City and Chicago, respectively, did not face that challenge. Additionally, Ives' isolation made it impossible for Ives to gain lucrative wartime government manufacturing contracts. As a result, Ives did not benefit financially from the war. After the war, Ives, along with competitors Lionel and American Flyer, lobbied successfully for protective tariffs to promote the fledgling American toy train industry. As a result, there was very little foreign competition after World War I, especially at the high end of the market where Ives had positioned itself. The seasonal nature of train sales continued to cause concern for Ives, and Harry Ives, Edward Ives' son and successor, sought one last time to diversify by selling toy boats, which he hoped would support the company through strong summer sales. The first boats, released in 1917, were powered by a clockwork engine from an Ives O gauge locomotive. However, the designs were unrealistic looking, lacking the costly detail that was the highlight of competing German designs, and had a tendency to sink easily. Additionally, since Ives did not use a primer when painting the boats, the paint flaked off easily. Ives had difficulty adapting its methods for designing and building trains to work for boats. Despite the problems, Ives continued producing the boats until 1928. Few Ives boats exist today, but it is unclear whether this was due to lack of popularity or their propensity to sink. Harry Ives had a heated professional relationship with Lionel founder Joshua Lionel Cowen, in which they traded lawsuits and, starting in 1915, Lionel criticized the quality of Ives' offerings in print advertisements, calling its cars flimsy and showing a cast- iron Ives locomotive shattering into 15 pieces when dropped from a table, while a Lionel locomotive dropped from the same height would survive with only dents. Other ads criticizing Ives' quality appeared, but they always compared Ives' cheapest products with Lionel's priciest offerings. Although Ives could rightly claim that its lithographed offerings were more realistic than Lionel's simple enameled two-color cars, Lionel, taking a cue from Ives, targeted advertising straight at children, claiming its cars were the most realistic and that its paint jobs were more durable. Ives' subdued responses did little to counter Lionel's claims, only calling its competitors (including Lionel) imitators whose technology was \\"12 years behind.\\" It was no match for Lionel's bold and brash ads. Additionally, Lionel's trains generally were priced lower, or, in instances where their price was comparable to Ives, they were larger, making them appear to be a better value for the money. As a result, Lionel continually gained ground on Ives, finally overtaking them in sales in 1924. In 1921, Ives abruptly discontinued its slow-selling 1 gauge trains in favor of Wide Gauge trains, a standard Lionel had introduced several years earlier and called \\"Standard Gauge\\". Ives did not call its trains Standard Gauge, as Lionel had trademarked the name. While Ives was inconsistent in what it called its larger-gauge trains, it most frequently called it wide gauge. Numerous other companies also entered the wide gauge market in the early 1920s, increasing consumer interest in the size and forcing the manufacturers to innovate in order to survive. In 1924, Ives introduced a locomotive engine that would change directions when its power flow was interrupted, a feature that Lionel would not offer for another two years. Even after Lionel's introduction, Ives' offering was unique in that it offered a neutral position as well as forward and reverse, and the engine's headlight continued to operate even when the train was in neutral. Ives charged a premium for this feature, which it dubbed the \\"R-unit\\" (the \\"R\\" stood for 'remote'), and it increased sales. This was not enough for Ives to re-take its former place as market leader‚Äîby 1926, Lionel's revenue was twice that of Ives'--and, worse yet for the company, Ives was losing money by the mid-1920s. This was worsened by Ives' attempts to compete at the low end of the market, where, unlike its competition, it sold its entry-level models at a loss. If Ives' low-end products were higher quality than its competitors, it benefited its customers, not the company. Bankruptcy In an effort to turn around the company, Harry Ives relinquished his presidency in 1927, becoming chairman of the board and bringing in an outsider, Charles R. Johnson, as president, but problems continued and Ives' largest creditor sued in 1928. Ives filed for bankruptcy, reporting liabilities of $188,303.25. As Ives already had $245,000 in Christmas sales lined up, Johnson petitioned for a private sale and a quick settlement. The motion for a private sale was denied. On July 31, 1928, Ives was purchased by Lionel and American Flyer for $73,250. The low price in comparison to the company sales was presumably due to liens on Ives' assets. Lionel and Flyer then operated Ives as a joint venture, retaining Johnson and Harry Ives as president and chairman, respectively. Harry Ives left the company in September 1929, and died within seven years. Ives' new owners immediately discontinued the line of toy boats, and much of Ives' train product line was replaced with relabeled American Flyer or Lionel product, and most new designs were carried out using Lionel and American Flyer parts, even though Ives' own designs were usually more realistic. There are several reasons for this. When Lionel and American Flyer bought Ives, they did not buy the factory or tooling, which they then had to rent. It may have been less expensive for the parent companies to supply their own parts than to rent the old Ives tooling. Some historians have speculated that the Ives tooling was worn out and no longer suitable for use. A third factor was that Lionel's and Flyer's manufacturing process was less labor-intensive, which made their designs less expensive to manufacture than the Ives designs they replaced. A notable exception was the Ives 1122 locomotive, first produced in 1929, which was the first near-to-scale model of an existing locomotive to enter the marketplace. Although it had a 4-4-2 wheel configuration, it was otherwise a recognizable copy of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad President Washington Class 4-6-2 locomotive. Whatever the reasons, the Ives product line after 1928 inherited many recognizable traits from three different companies' product lines. Lionel Manufactured Production In 1930, Lionel bought out American Flyer's share in Ives and closed the Ives factory in Connecticut, moving operations to Lionel's New Jersey factory. Lionel kept the Ives brand on the market through 1932, then repositioned Ives for 1933, branding its entry-level trains as Lionel-Ives, then dropped the Ives name altogether following that year. Although re-issues were occasionally made, the Ives name never re- appeared on the marketplace with any kind of regularity. Although Joshua Lionel Cowen would later claim that he dumped all of the Ives molds in the Connecticut River, Ives' influence lived on. Lionel continued the Ives practice of issuing low-end train sets that ran on a circle of O-gauge track with a 27-inch radius, and Lionel incorporated some Ives-designed freight cars into its product line. The Lionel 1680 tanker car, for instance, was an Ives design that remained in Lionel's catalogs right up to the start of World War II. Even more significantly, the Ives e-unit first introduced in 1924 lived on in Lionel locomotives, with a modified version of the Ives design first appearing in Lionel trains starting in 1933. Some historians have said Cowen coveted the Ives e-unit, and that it was the primary reason Lionel bought the company. It would remain present in Lionel trains for more than 50 years.

Rosslyn Chapel was founded on a small hill above Roslin Glen as a Catholic collegiate church (with between four and six ordained canons and two boy choristers) in the mid-15th century. The chapel was founded by William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness of the Scoto-Norman Sinclair family. Rosslyn Chapel is the third Sinclair place of worship at Roslin, the first being in Roslin Castle and the second (whose crumbling buttresses can still be seen today) in what is now Roslin Cemetery.Turnbull, Michael, 'Rosslyn Chapel Revealed' (Sutton Publishing Ltd., November 2007) Sinclair founded the college to celebrate the Divine Office throughout the day and night, and also to celebrate Masses for all the faithful departed, including the deceased members of the Sinclair family. During this period, the rich heritage of plainsong (a single melodic line) or polyphony (vocal harmony) were used to enrich the singing of the liturgy. Sinclair provided an endowment to pay for the support of the priests and choristers in perpetuity. The priests also had parochial responsibilities. After the Scottish Reformation (1560), Catholic worship in the chapel was brought to an end. The Sinclair family continued to be Catholics until the early 18th century. From that time, the chapel was closed to public worship until 1861. It was re-opened as a place of worship according to the rites of the Scottish Episcopal Church, a member church of the Anglican Communion. It was reported in The Argus of Melbourne, Australia that Rosslyn Chapel was the site of an alleged bombing attempt by a suffragette. Since the late 1980s, the chapel has been the subject of speculative theories concerning a connection with the Knights Templar and the Holy Grail, and Freemasonry. It was prominently featured in this role in Dan Brown's bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code (2003) and its 2006 film adaptation. Medieval historians say these accounts have no basis in fact. Rosslyn Chapel remains privately owned. The current owner is Peter St Clair- Erskine, 7th Earl of Rosslyn. Interior of the chapel. Architecture keystone in the roof The original plans for Rosslyn have never been found or recorded, so it is open to speculation whether or not the chapel was intended to be built in its current layout. Its architecture is considered to be among the finest in Scotland. Construction of the chapel began on 20 September 1456, although it has often been recorded as 1446. The confusion over the building date comes from the chapel's receiving its founding charter to build a collegiate chapel in 1446 from Rome. Sinclair did not start to build the chapel until he had built houses for his craftsmen. Although the original building was to be cruciform, it was never completed. Only the choir was constructed, with the retro-chapel, otherwise called the Lady chapel, built on the much earlier crypt (Lower Chapel) believed to form part of an earlier castle. The foundations of the unbuilt nave and transepts stretching to a distance of 90 feet were recorded in the 19th century. The decorative carving was executed over a forty-year period. After the founder's death, construction of the planned nave and transepts was abandoned - either from lack of funds, lack of interest or a change in liturgical fashion. The Lower Chapel (also known as the crypt or sacristy) should not be confused with the burial vaults that lie underneath Rosslyn Chapel. The chapel stands on fourteen pillars, which form an arcade of twelve pointed arches on three sides of the nave. At the east end, a fourteenth pillar between the penultimate pair form a three- pillared division between the nave and the Lady chapel.Wallace-Murphy, Tim; Hopkins, Marilyn. Rosslyn: Guardians of the Secrets of the Holy Grail, Element Books, 1999, p. 8, . The three pillars at the east end of the chapel are named, from north to south: the Master Pillar, the Journeyman Pillar and, most famously, the Apprentice Pillar. These names for the pillars date from the late Georgian period ‚Äî prior to this period they were called the Earl's Pillar, the Shekinah and the Prince's Pillar. Apprentice pillar The Apprentice Pillar One of the more notable architectural features of the Chapel is the \\"Apprentice Pillar, or \\"Prentice Pillar\\". Originally called the \\"Prince's Pillar\\" (in the 1778 document An Account of the Chapel of Roslin)Forbes , Robert An Account of the Chapel of Roslin. (reprint ed. Cooper, Robert L. D., Grand Lodge of Scotland, 2000. ) the name morphed over time due to a legend dating from the 18th century, involving the master mason in charge of the stonework in the chapel and his young apprentice mason. According to the legend, the master mason did not believe that the apprentice could perform the complicated task of carving the column without seeing the original which formed the inspiration for the design. The master mason travelled to see the original himself, but upon his return was enraged to find that the upstart apprentice had completed the column by himself. In a fit of jealous anger, the master mason took his mallet and struck the apprentice on the head, killing him. The legend concludes that as punishment for his crime, the master mason's face was carved into the opposite corner to forever gaze upon his apprentice's pillar.Dr Forbes, Bishop of Caithness, An Account of the Chapel of Rosslyn, 1774; cited in Rosslyn Chapel (1997) by the Earl of Rosslyn, p. 27. There is however, no evidence that any such murder took place. On the architrave joining the pillar there is an inscription, Forte est vinum fortior est rex fortiores sunt mulieres super omnia vincit veritas: \\"Wine is strong, a king is stronger, women are stronger still, but truth conquers all\\" (1 Esdras, chapters 3 & 4). The author Henning Klovekorn has proposed that the pillar is representative of one of the roots of the Nordic Yggdrasil tree, prominent in Germanic and Norse mythology. He compares the dragons at the base of the pillar to the dragons found eating away at the base of the Yggdrasil root and, pointing out that at the top of the pillar is carved tree foliage, argues that the Nordic/Viking association is plausible considering the many auxiliary references in the chapel to Celtic and Norse mythology.Klovekorn, Henning. The 99 Degrees of Freemasonry. Cornerstone, 2007 . The general form of the pillar has been related to a type described by the French architect Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc as a \\"bunch of sausages.\\"Finlay, Ian, Scottish Crafts, Harrap (1948), p. 23, \\"On en voit un (pilier) compos√© de gros boudins en spirale dans l'√©glise de Sainte-Croix de Provins,\\" Viollet-le-Duc, Dictionnaire Raisonn√© de l‚ÄôArchitecture Fran√ßaise du XIe au XVIe si√®cle/Pilier A full-size plaster cast of the Apprentice Pillar and the adjacent bay of the chapel was made in 1871, and is in the Cast Courts of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Carvings Among Rosslyn's many intricate carvings are a sequence of 213 cubes or \\"boxes\\" protruding from pillars and arches with a selection of patterns on them. It is unknown if these patterns have any particular meaning attached to them. Many people have attempted to find information coded into them, but no interpretation has yet proven conclusive. Unfortunately, many of these 'boxes' are not original, having been replaced in the 19th century after erosion damage. One recent attempt to make sense of the boxes has been to interpret them as a musical score. The motifs on the boxes somewhat resemble geometric patterns seen in the study of cymatics. The patterns are formed by placing powder upon a flat surface and vibrating the surface at different frequencies. By matching these Chladni patterns with musical notes corresponding to the same frequencies, the father-and-son team of Thomas and Stuart Mitchell produced a tune which Stuart calls the Rosslyn Motet. Green Man of the chapel There are more than 110 carvings of \\"Green Men\\" in and around the chapel. Green Men are carvings of human faces with greenery all around them, often growing out of their mouths. They are found in all areas of the chapel, with one example in the Lady chapel, between the two middle altars of the east wall. Carvings, which some believe depict Indian corn (maize) Other carvings represent plants, including depictions of wheat, strawberries or lilies. The authors Robert Lomas and Christopher Knight have hypothesized that some carvings in the chapel represent ears of new world corn or maize, a plant which was unknown in Europe at the time of the chapel's construction. Knight and Lomas view these carvings as evidence supporting the idea that Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, travelled to the Americas well before Columbus.Knight, Christopher; Lomas, Robert. The Hiram Key. Fair Winds Press, 2001 . In their book they discuss meeting with the wife of botanist Adrian. Dyer, and that Dyer's wife told him that Dyer agreed that the image thought to be maize was accurate. In fact Dyer found only one identifiable plant among the botanical carvings and suggested that the \\"maize\\" and \\"aloe\\" were stylized wooden patterns, only coincidentally looking like real plants. Crypt The chapel has been a burial place for several generations of the Sinclairs; a crypt was once accessible from a descending stair at the rear of the chapel. This crypt has been sealed shut for many years, which may explain the recurrent legends that it is merely a front to a more extensive subterranean vault containing (variously) the mummified head of Jesus Christ,Laidler, Keith, The Head of God ‚Äì The Lost Treasure of the Templars (1998). the Holy Grail,Wallace-Murphy, Tim; Hopkins, Marilyn, Rosslyn: Guardian of Secrets of the Holy Grail (1999). the treasure of the Templars,Robert Lomas, The Origins of Freemasonry or the original crown jewels of Scotland.Ralls-MacLeod, Karen; Robertson, Ian, The Quest for the Celtic Key (2002). In 1837, when the 2nd Earl of Rosslyn died, his wish was to be buried in the original vault. Exhaustive searches over the period of a week were made, but no entrance to the original vault was found and he was buried beside his wife in the Lady Chapel.Donaldson's Guide to Rosslyn Chapel published 1862. Rooftop pinnacle The pinnacles on the rooftop have been subject to interest during renovation work in 2010. Nesting jackdaws had made the pinnacles unstable and as such had to be dismantled brick by brick revealing the existence of a chamber specifically made by the stonemasons to harbour bees. The hive, now abandoned, has been sent to local bee keepers to identify.

Restoration, conservation and tourism The chapel's altars were destroyed in 1592, In 1590, the Presbytery forbade George Ramsay, Minister of Lasswade, from burying the wife of Oliver St. Clair in the chapel. The same St. Clair had been repeatedly asked to destroy the chapel's altars because they were taken to represent \\"monuments of idolatry\\". St. Clair's tenants were forced to attend the Lasswade Parish Church. In 1592, St. Clair, who had until then refused to destroy the altars, was summoned to appear before the Church of Scotland General Assembly and threatened with excommunication if the altars remained standing after 17 August 1592. On 31 August 1592, George Ramsay reported that the altars of Roslene were haille demolishit. John Charles Carrick, The Abbey of S. Mary, Newbottle: a memorial of the royal visit, 1907, G. Lewis & Co., 1908, p. 153. and the chapel was abandoned, gradually falling into decay. In 1842 the chapel, then in a ruined and overgrown state, was visited by Queen Victoria, who expressed a desire that it should be preserved. Restoration work was carried out in 1862 by David Bryce on behalf of James Alexander, 3rd Earl of Rosslyn. The chapel was re-dedicated on 22 April 1862, and from this time, Sunday services were once again held, now under the jurisdiction of the Scottish Episcopal Church, for the first time in 270 years. The Rosslyn Chapel Trust was established in 1995, with the purpose of overseeing its conservation and its opening as a sightseeing destination. The chapel underwent an extensive programme of conservation between 1997 and 2013. This included work to the roof, the stone, the carvings, the stained glass and the organ. A steel canopy was erected over the chapel roof for fourteen years. This was to prevent further rain damage to the church and also to give it a chance to dry out properly. Three human skeletons were found during the restoration.http://www.midlothianadvertiser.co.uk/news/local- headlines/rosslyn_chapel_bones_to_be_dated_1_2061151 Major stonework repairs were completed by the end of 2011. The last major scaffolding was removed in August 2010. A new visitor centre opened in July 2011. The chapel's stained- glass windows and organ were fully restored. New lighting and heating were installed. The expected cost of the restoration work is around ¬£13 million, with about ¬£3.7 million being spent on the Visitor Centre. Funding has come from various sources including Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic Scotland and the environmental body, WREN. Actor Tom Hanks also made a donation. Photography and video have been forbidden in the chapel since 2008. The chapel sells commercially produced photos in its shop. In 2006, historian Louise Yeoman criticised the Rosslyn Chapel trust for \\"cashing in\\" on the popularity of The Da Vinci Code, against better knowledge.\\"What really upsets me is that they know the Knights Templar connection is false, yet they still perpetuate the myth on their interpretation boards.\\" In the financial year of 2013-14, Rosslyn Chapel recorded 144,823 visitors, the highest number since 2007-08, when (at the height of popular interest induced by The Da Vinci Code), the number of visitors was close to 159,000.The trust's financial year ends on 31 March. Scaffolding coming down helps visitor numbers go up, Rosslyn Chapel Trust website (April 2014). In popular culture=Templar and Masonic connections The chapel became the subject of speculation regarding its supposed connection with the Knights Templar or Freemasonry beginning in the 1980s.The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982), Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry Hardcover John J. Robinson, Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry Hardcover (1989), Michael Baigent The Temple and the Lodge (1991), Coppens, Philip. The Stone Puzzle of Rosslyn Chapel. Frontier Publishing/Adventures Unlimited Press (2002). This part of its history was referenced in the DC Comics storyline Batman: Scottish Connection, in which the hero Batman becomes caught up in an old vendetta between two Scottish clans during a visit to Scotland, this mystery including the discovery of an ancient treasure trove hidden in Rosslyn.Batman: Scottish Connection by Alan Grant and Frank Quitely, September 1998 The topic entered mainstream pop culture with Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code (2003), reinforced by the subsequent film of the same name (2006), Numerous books were published after 2003 to cater to the popular interest in supposed connections between Rosslyn Chapel, Freemasonry, the Templars and the Holy Grail generated by Brown's novel. e.g.: Mark Oxbrow and Ian Robertson, Rosslyn and The Grail. Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing (2005), Ashley Cowie. The Rosslyn Templar (2009), Alan Butler and John Ritchie, Rosslyn Revealed, A Library in Stone (2006), Alan Butler and John Ritchie, Rosslyn Chapel Decoded: New Interpretations of a Gothic Enigma (2013). The chapel, built 150 years after the dissolution of the Knights Templar, supposedly has many Templar symbols, such as the \\"Two riders on a single horse\\" that appear on the Knights Templar Seal. William Sinclair 3rd Earl of Orkney, Baron of Roslin and 1st Earl of Caithness, claimed by novelists to be a hereditary Grand Master of the Scottish stonemasons, built Rosslyn Chapel. A later William Sinclair of Roslin became the first Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland and, subsequently, several other members of the Sinclair family have held this position.National Geographic Channel. Knights Templar, 22 February 2006 video documentary. Written by Jesse Evans. Robert L. D. Cooper, curator of the Grand Lodge of Scotland Museum and Library, in 2003 published a 12th edition of the 1892 Illustrated Guide to Rosslyn Chapel with the intention of countering the \\"nonsense published about Rosslyn Chapel over the last 15 years or so\\".\\"Book Review\\" at the Grand Lodge of Scotland website: \\"There has been so much nonsense published about Rosslyn Chapel over the last 15 years or so that it is now extremely difficult to know what is nonsense and what is accurate.\\" Cooper in 2006 also published Rosslyn Hoax? in which he actively debunks this type of speculation at length and in great detail. An example is the comparison of the Rosslyn myth of the Apprentice Pillar with that of the allegorical references to Hiram Abiff in Masonic ritual, and in the process he debunks any similarities between the two. A minute comparison between the Rosslyn Myth and the Masonic allegory can be found in a detailed tabular form in The Rosslyn Hoax?Robert L D Cooper, The Rosslyn Hoax?, Lewis Masonic 2006, pp. 173‚Äì4 Cooper further debunks other claims of a connection between carvings within Rosslyn Chapel and Scottish Freemasonry. The suggestion that the Apprentice Pillar is a physical reference to the Entered Apprentice degree of Scottish Freemasonry logically led to the conclusion that the other two pillars (in line south to north with the so-called Apprentice Pillar) represented the Fellow of Craft degree (middle pillar) and the Master Mason's degree (north pillar). This association of three pillars in the east part of Rosslyn Chapel with the three degrees of Scottish Freemasonry is impossible, given the fact that (according to Cooper) the third degree of Freemasonry was invented c.1720 - almost 300 years after Rosslyn Chapel was founded.Robert L D Cooper, The Rosslyn Hoax?, Lewis Masonic 2006, pp. 146‚Äì7 An interior view showing the Apprentice Pillar and ornate carvings. The claim that the layout of Rosslyn Chapel echoes that of Solomon's Temple has been analysed by Mark Oxbrow and Ian Robertson in their book, Rosslyn and the Grail: > Rosslyn Chapel bears no more resemblance to Solomon's or Herod's Temple than > a house brick does to a paperback book.

As to a possible connection between the St. Clairs and the Knights Templar, the family testified against the Templars when that Order was put on trial in Edinburgh in 1309. Historian Dr. Louise Yeoman, along with other medieval scholars, says the Knights Templar connection is false, and points out that Rosslyn Chapel was built by William Sinclair so that Mass could be said for the souls of his family. It is also claimed that other carvings in the chapel reflect Masonic imagery, such as the way that hands are placed in various figures. One carving may show a blindfolded man being led forward with a noose around his neck ‚Äì similar to the way a candidate is prepared for initiation into Freemasonry. The carving has been eroded by time and pollution and is difficult to make out clearly. The chapel was built in the 15th century, and the earliest records of Freemasonic lodges date back only to the late 16th and early 17th centuries.History page from the website of the United Grand Lodge of England A more likely explanation however is that the Masonic imagery was added at a later date. This may have taken place in the 1860s when James St Clair-Erskine, 3rd Earl of Rosslyn instructed Edinburgh architect David Bryce, a known Freemason, to undertake restoration work on areas of the church including many of the carvings. Alternative histories Alternative histories involving Rosslyn Chapel and the Sinclairs have been published by Andrew Sinclair and Tim Wallace-Murphy arguing links with the Knights Templar and the supposed descendants of Jesus Christ. The books in particular by Tim Wallace-Murphy and Marilyn Hopkins Rex Deus: The True Mystery of Rennes-le- Ch√¢teau and the Dynasty of Jesus (2000) and Custodians of Truth: The Continuance of Rex Deus (2005) have focused on the hypothetical Jesus bloodline with the Sinclairs and Rosslyn Chapel. On the ABC documentary Jesus, Mary and Da Vinci, aired on 3 November 2003, Niven Sinclair hinted that the descendants of Jesus Christ existed within the Sinclair families. These alternative histories are relatively modern - not dating back before the early 1990s. The precursor to these Rosslyn theories is the 1982 book The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (retitled Holy Blood, Holy Grail in the United States) by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln that introduced the theory of the Jesus bloodline in relation to the Priory of Sion hoax - the main protagonist of which was Pierre Plantard, who for a time adopted the name Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair.

Other players may consider this disruptive when done to the exclusion of all other considerations, such as storytelling, atmosphere and camaraderie. When focusing on the letter of the rules over the spirit of the rules, it is often seen as unsporting, un-fun, or unsociable. This behaviour is most often found in games with a wide range of game features, lengthy campaigns or prize tournaments such as massively multiplayer or collectible games. Those wishing to discuss the behavior without pejorative connotation may use the neutral term optimization.  Description  Powergaming in roleplaying games can take several forms. One form is the deliberate creation of optimal player characters (PCs), with the aim of maximising the power the player wields in the game world. This is known as min-maxing, due to the practice of maximising desirable or \\"powerful\\" traits while minimising underpowered or unuseful traits. Such characters often draw criticism for not fitting the theme and tone of the game world or for being difficult to challenge. Another form of powergaming involves a focus on acquiring power during game progression, often by acquiring powerful equipment or unusual abilities. This lends itself to gameplay which is materialistic (and often, in the context of the game world, arguably amoral) and can frustrate other players who are looking to interact with the game world, score points, and not merely acquire game resources.Ed Simbalist & Wilf Backhaus Chivalry and Sorcery (1983) p.10 3.03 Power Gaming Another term for a powergamer is a munchkin, who may be differentiated from normal powergamers to describe players who seek to acquire power and loot at the expense and disregard of their teammates. In online text-based role- playing games that emphasize collaborative role-play over acquiring levels or skills, a player can be described as a powergamer if he or she presumes or declares that his or her own action against another player character is successful without giving the other player character the freedom to act on his or her own prerogative. They may also be a player who tries to force others to participate in unwanted role-playing. For instance, a player who unilaterally describes his character as doing something with (or to) another character that would usually require the other to play along -- such as having a fight or a sexual encounter -- is considered to be powergaming. In such games, in which a sense of community and rapport between players is seen as crucial and conducive to the game's overall well-being, powergaming is generally regarded as extremely offensive behaviour if it is not stated in the rules as being a bannable offense. It is often seen as synonymous with twinking or godmoding. In video games, powergamers enjoy being at the bleeding edge of progression of their selected game, taking part in every activity that yields the fastest progression, and bypassing the \\"lesser\\" activities or any other secondary job/trait/skill. This is a wide generalization however. A gamer that likes to maximise all aspects of the game and do so in an expedient manner is also classified as a powergamer, often seeing more of the world than the \\"average\\" player would.

The stated purpose was to reduce unemployment by providing training, subsidised employment and voluntary work to the unemployed. Spending on the New Deal was ¬£1.3 billion in 2001. The New Deal was a cornerstone of New Labour and devised mainly by LSE Professor Richard Layard, who has since been elevated to the House of Lords as a Labour peer. It was based on similar workfare models in Sweden, which Layard has spent much of his academic career studying. Purpose The New Deal had as its signature, the power to withdraw benefits from those who 'refused reasonable employment'. 'Workfare' in the UK can arguably be traced back to 1986, and compulsory 'Restart' interviews for claimants after a certain period, and as such the first introduction of 'conditionalities' with the possible outcome of 'sanctions' for perceived non- compliance. The 'New Deal' replaced the previous workfare programme of the then-Conservative government of John Major, 'Project Work', which had been launched in the early 90s's. A further project was introduced in 1999, the Working Families Tax Credit, a tax credit scheme for low income workers which was meant to provide an incentive to work, and to continue in work. Professor Richard Beaudry, from the Department of Economics at the University of York, defined the New Deal as follows in a 2002 paper, Workfare and Welfare: Britain‚Äôs New Deal (pp. 8‚Äì9) : \\"The New Deal reforms promise eventual reform of welfare assistance for all benefit recipients.\\" New Deal Programmes Although originally targeting the young unemployed (18- to 24-year-olds), the New Deal programmes subsequently targeted other groups. These include: ‚Ä¢ New Deal for Young People (NDYP) received by far the greatest proportion of New Deal funding (¬£3.15 billion through to 2002 ). It targeted unemployed youth (aged 18‚Äì24) unemployed for 6 months or longer. ‚Ä¢ New Deal 25+ targeted aged 25+ unemployed for eighteen months or more. In terms of funding, ¬£350 million was allocated up to 2002. ‚Ä¢ New Deal for Lone Parents targeted single parents with school age children. ¬£200 million was directly allocated to the program, not including additional assistance for child-care. ‚Ä¢ New Deal for the Disabled targeted those with disabilities in receipt of Incapacity and similar benefits. ¬£200 million was budgeted for the program up to 2002 (Peck, ‚ÄúWorkfare‚Äù 304-305). This was superseded by the 'Work Capability Assessment', introduced by the Brown government in 2008, and administered by Atos Healthcare. ‚Ä¢ New Deal 50+ targeted those aged 50+. ‚Ä¢ New Deal for Musicians was a little-known element aimed at unemployed musicians. Referral procedure The greatest emphasis of the first New Labour government was the NDYP, which was a pilot phase for more ambitious New Deal reforms with other groups. The NDYP began with an initial compulsory 'consultation session', referred to as 'Gateway', that focused on improving job search and interview skills. This training was provided by a third-party organisation from the workfare industry such as a4e, a quango such as CSV or a charity spin-off such as YMCA Training. If an employment search still proved unsuccessful after the Gateway sessions, to continue to receive Job Seeker's Allowance, one of four options had to be chosen: ‚Ä¢ A subsidised job placement. The subsidy being ¬£60 per week, and lasting 6 months; a ¬£750 training allowance was also available to participants. Those taking part were not paid wages. ‚Ä¢ Full-time education and training, for up to 12 months. ‚Ä¢ Work in the voluntary sector, called the 'Community Task Force': those taking part were paid JSA plus a ¬£15 training allowance. ‚Ä¢ Work with the Environmental Task Force.(DWP website; Peck, ‚ÄúWorkfare‚Äù 304; Glyn 53) Participation in one of the four options was mandatory in order to be still able to claim JSA, refusal to participate led to 'sanctions' - withdrawal of JSA, and referral to a 'Decision Maker' who decided the outcome of 'sanctions' on the claimant. Flexible New Deal A new scheme, called the 'Flexible New Deal', was introduced in October 2009, aimed at revamping the programme that had, by then, been in existence for more than a decade. Following the formation of the Conservative-led coalition government after the General Election of May 2010, Tory minister Chris Grayling announced the end of the New Deal that October. Grayling said the scheme had cost over ¬£31,000 per job placement. Although the figure quoted was correct at the time, the project was front-loaded with costs and lagged in results; given another 11 months the cost per head would have been roughly half of the quoted figure.http://fullfact.org/factchecks/is_chris_grayling_giving_the_new_deal_a_fair_deal-1608 The New Deal was replaced in the Summer of 2011 by the Coalition Government's Single Work Programme.http://www.regen.net/news/ByDiscipline/Economic- Development/1009458/Flexible-New-Deal-contracts-risk-cancelled/ Steps to Work Steps to Work was the replacement for the New Deal in Northern Ireland and is still in existence. It is administered by the Department for Employment and Learning through its Jobs and Benefits Office. Steps to Work came into effect in 2008 and consists of largely the same provisions as the New Deal with the exception that payment by the Department is now more focused towards employment outcomes ‚Äì and thus payment to workfare third parties ‚Äì than previously. Criticisms Critics claim that participants failed to see the value in the programmes and the programmes were not effective in equipping participants for work.

The Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) is the second simulated Mars analog habitat owned and operated by the Mars Society. The station was built near Hanksville, Utah, in the western United States in the early 2000s, and it is typically crewed by small crews who visit the station for one week to three month rotations to conduct scientific research. The campus includes a two- story habitat (the Hab), a greenhouse (the GreenHab), a solar observatory (the Musk Observatory), a robotic observatory, an engineering pod (the RAM) and a science building (the ScienceDome). Tunnels between all of the buildings except the robotic observatory allow crews to travel between the buildings without a spacesuit while they are in simulation (sim).  Background  The MDRS station is situated on the San Rafael Swell of southern Utah, located by road northwest of Hanksville, Utah. It is the second such analogue research station to be built by the Mars Society, following in the footsteps of the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station or FMARS on Devon Island in Canada's high Arctic. The third station, the European Mars Analog Research Station or EuroMARS was founded and built in early 2002. It was shipped to the UK in the mid 2000s in preparation for deployment to the selected research site (approximately N65¬∞ 46' 7.18\\" W16¬∞ 45' 30.50\\") which is located next to the Krafla Rift Volcano, about north east of the village of Myvatn, Iceland. The fourth station, the Australia Mars Analog Research Station / MARS Oz is currently in the planning stages and it will be deployed to the selected research site (S 30¬∞ 18' 13.91\\" E 139¬∞ 26' 39.55\\") east of the Arkaroola Sanctuary, which itself is roughly north of Adelaide, South Australia. The Mars Society launched the Mars Analog Research Station (MARS) Project in order to develop key knowledge needed to prepare for the human exploration of Mars. The project's goals are to develop field tactics based on environmental constraints (i.e., being required to work in spacesuits), to test habitat design features and tools, and to assess crew selection protocols. Although much warmer than Mars, the desert location was selected because of its Mars- like terrain and appearance. From the moment they arrive at MDRS, crews enter a \\"living on Mars\\" simulation. Crew members must wear an analogue space suit simulator or a \\"sim suit\\" when completing tasks outside the Habitat (HAB) to simulate the protection they would need from the harsh Martian environment. Complete analogue space suit simulators include a helmet, jumpsuit, boots, gaithers, gloves, an air supply pack, Platypus water pack, and a radio. Hand held radios mounted on the suits' helmets (with externally mounted push to talk switches) are used to communicate with Habitat communication base (Hab- com) and with fellow analogue Mars surface explorers on the same EVA. For safety reasons, there is always one crew member in the HAB to act as Hab-Com in case anything goes wrong on the extra-vehicular activity (EVA). In the event that crew's vehicles break down or one of their members becomes injured in the field, being able to communicate with the HAB is crucial to protect the safety of the people partaking in the analogue Mars surface exploration simulation mission. Destinations for EVAs can be chosen from an established waypoint database and traveled to either on foot or by ATV. MDRS is owned and operated by The Mars Society, which selects the crews and handles most of the administrative tasks. The Mars Society is an international, non-profit organization, with chapters worldwide, that is dedicated to convincing governments and the public of the benefits of Mars exploration through various projects such as M.A.R.S., the Mars Analogue Pressurized Rover Competition, and the ARCHIMEDES Mars balloon mission. Students interested in participating in the project receive a $500 travel stipend from the Spaceward Bound Program run out of NASA Ames Research Center. The Spaceward Bound Program aims to train the next generation of space explorers by allowing students and teachers to participate in projects in extreme environments that can serve as simulations for the moon or Mars. A Local Manager has been hired to take care of some of the maintenance and support services. Research Each crew establishes different scientific goals they hope to accomplish during their time at MDRS. The majority of the biological studies carried out involve extremophiles, or organisms that are capable of living in extreme environments. Bacteria and algae isolated from the surrounding desert are common subjects of study. These microorganisms have been studied for their DNA, diversity and the environments they live in. For example, in a study for methanogens researchers studied soil and vapour samples from five different desert environments in Utah, Idaho and California in the United States, and in Canada and Chile. Of these, five soil samples and three vapour samples from the vicinity of the MDRS were found to have signs of viable methanogens. A unique opportunity to combine geology and biology occurs when studying the endoliths found in rocks around the Hab. These species of bacteria are capable of living inside rocks and obtaining the energy they need by photosynthesizing using the light that penetrates the rocks. These extreme organisms are a popular subject of research at MDRS for both geologists and biologists. Other experiments include a study of the effect of EVAs on the heart rates and blood pressures of crew members, a human factors study that examine the correlation between cognitive ability and mood and a study on how much a space suit inhibits dexterity in comparison to regular street clothes. Crews Crew 73 members in Space Suit Simulators MDRS crews traditionally consist of six people, who volunteer for one of the two-week shifts or crew rotations available during the northern hemisphere's winter months. The field season ends in the northern spring since the summer heat of the desert is not conducive to a pleasant simulation. Crews pay all of their own transportation expenses to get to and from the designated assembly place from where they are transported to and from MDRS. As Volunteers, the Crews are not paid for their participation in a crew rotation at the station, but do get valuable experience. The crews usually consist of a mix of Scientist, astronomers, physicists, biologists, geologists, engineers and the occasional journalist. Each crew member is usually assigned a role: Commander, Executive Officer (ExO), Health and Safety Officer (HSO), Crew Biologist, Crew Geologist or Chief Engineer. The Crew Commander is ultimately responsible for the entire crew and operations. Their other responsibilities include maintaining a structured stream of information from the crew to Mission Support, establishing the agenda for each day (EVAs, maintenance, cooking, cleaning, etc.) and holding morning and evening meetings with all crew members. The Executive Officer's duty is to act as the second in command during the mission and to act as the Commander in the event that the Commander is incapacitated or unavailable. The Crew Geologist and the Crew Biologist work together to establish and accomplish the science goals of the mission. The Crew Geologist and Crew Biologist are in charge of developing the geology and biology goals for the mission, planning field EVAs and subsequent laboratory work to achieve those goals. Both the Crew Geologist and Crew Biologist work with the Remote Science Team (RST) during all stages of the mission. The Chief Engineer is responsible for maintaining all systems necessary for routine Hab operations. These include the power, water, ATV and GreenHab systems. , 175 crews have served rotations at MDRS over a period of sixteen years. The Research Station MDRS Crew 73 meets with writer Laurie Schmidt upstairs in the Hab. The research station consists of three buildings, the Habitat, the Greenhab, the Musk Mars Desert Observatory and a remotely located Engineering Support Equipment Area. Habitat The analogue Mars Lander Habitat, commonly referred to as \\"The HAB\\", is a two-story cylinder that measures about in diameter and is a crew's combined home and place of work during a Mars surface exploration simulation. On the first floor there are two simulated airlocks, a shower and toilet, an EVA Preparation room for storage and maintenance of the simulated space suits and their associated equipment, and a combined science lab and engineering work area. The laboratory is shared between the Crew Geologist and the Crew Biologist and includes an autoclave, analytical balance, microscope, and a stock of chemicals and reagents for conducting biochemical tests. On the second floor are six very small private crew staterooms with bunks and a small reading desk, a common dining and entertainment area, a dedicated communications station and a galley or kitchen equipped with a gas stove, refrigerator, microwave, oven and a sink for meal preparations. Above the six crew staterooms is a Loft which contains the internal fresh water storage tank and equipment storage space. At the peak of the HAB's dome shaped roof is an access hatch to permit maintenance access to the satellite antenna and weather monitoring instruments. Power is supplied by 12 rechargeable 24-volt batteries, located under the HAB which can provide electrical power for up to twelve hours. In addition to the batteries are two electricity generators named respectively \\"Casper\\" and \\"Wendy\\". Power from the generators is channeled through a Xantrex inverter, which sends the power either to the battery banks to recharge them or via a panel with 19 circuit breakers, to the HAB electrical distribution system. Water is supplied to the HAB via a potable water tank located away in the Engineering Support Equipment Area. The tank is a plastic storage container with a capacity (8 days worth of water at per person per day). Water must be manually carried or pumped via a hose from the potable water tank to the HAB's internal tank, which holds about . The water is then gravity fed into a pressure pump that distributes the fresh water to the rest of the HAB, including a water heater. The water used to flush toilet is greywater. This is waste water that has run down the sink and shower drains in the HAB and then through the greywater system out of the GreenHab. Water is rationed and monitored to minimize inefficiency and waste in the system. The HAB is also equipped with an internet connection and several web cams so that the public can view the ongoing mission. GreenHab The GreenHab is a greenhouse used for growing crops and plant research. The original Gary Fisher GreenHab, retrofitted in 2009 from a closed loop water recycling center to a functional greenhouse, was destroyed by fire in December 2014, and replaced in September 2015 after an Indiegogo campaign raised $12,540 to rebuild it. Originally the rebuilt GreenHab was planned as a geodesic dome. However, once the pad and frame were in place, there appeared to be no way to make it wind and winter tight, so it was completed as the new ScienceDome. The new Greenhab is a 12 foot by 24 foot transparent building that is climate and light controlled. The plants grown in the Greenhab are mostly herbs, greens, radishes, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Musk Mars Desert Observatory The Musk Mars Desert Observatory The Musk Mars Desert Observatory houses a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, donated by Celestron. The telescope is capable of being operated remotely, and is accessible to amateur and professional astronomers via the internet. The observatory's other sponsors include Le Sueur Manufacturing Inc., which provided the Astro-Pier on which the telescope is mounted; Software Bisque, which provided TheSky software; Vince Lanzetta of East Coast Observatories; Adirondack Video Astronomy; High Point Scientific; Technical Innovations; and the Lehigh Valley Amateur Astronomical Association. The addition of the Musk Mars Desert Observatory provides research opportunities that were not available before, not only to the crew, but local teachers and students. It also encourages more public involvement as students and teachers are invited to interact with the crew and to use the observatory as a learning tool. Engineering tasks are completed in the RAM (Repair and assembly module) a retrofitted Chinook helicopter fuel compartment designed with for tool storage, and work spaces for engineering project and repair of station instruments. It was moved to the campus in October 2017 and became fully operational in November 2018. Other North of the GreenHAB is the underground septic tank and its outflow field. This area is a \\"No Drive - Foot Traffic Only Zone\\" as there is no record of where exactly the septic tank is buried. East of the GreenHab is an omnidirectional Jovian radio telescope. The MDRS is the site of the University Rover Challenge, the first of which was held on June 2, 2007. The Flag of Mars appears on a couple of the buildings, as does the Flag of the United States. The Mars Society logo is also present in a few places.

Tenets  According to Rockwell, the paleolibertarian movement hearkens back to such thinkers as \\"Ludwig von Mises, Albert Jay Nock, Garet Garrett, and the entire interwar Old Right that opposed the New Deal and favored the Old Republic\\"\\"Paleolibertarianism\\" by Karen De Coster, LewRockwell.com, December 2, 2003 and distinguished themselves from neo- libertarians, Beltway libertarianism (a pejorative term used by hardline libertarians to describe libertarians who have gained traction in the Beltway, i.e. Washington, D.C.), left-libertarianism and lifestyle libertarianism. According to Rockwell, paleolibertarianism \\"made its peace with religion as the bedrock of liberty, property, and the natural order\\". Paleolibertarianism developed in opposition to the social progressivism of mainstream libertarianism. In his essay \\"The Case for Paleo-Libertarianism\\", Rockwell charged mainstream libertarians with \\"hatred of Western culture\\". He argued that \\"pornographic photography, 'free'-thinking, chaotic painting, atonal music, deconstructionist literature, Bauhaus architecture, and modernist films have nothing in common with the libertarian political agenda‚Äîno matter how much individual libertarians may revel in them\\". Of paleolibertarians, he wrote that \\"we obey, and we ought to obey, traditions of manners and taste\\". After explaining why cultural conservatives could make a better argument for liberty to the middle classes, Rockwell predicted \\"in the new movement, libertarians who personify the present corruption will sink to their natural level, as will the Libertarian Party, which has been their diabolic pulpit\\".  Early history  In the essay \\"Right-Wing Populism: A Strategy for the Paleo Movement\\", Rothbard reflected on the ability of paleolibertarians to engage in an \\"outreach to rednecks\\" founded on social conservatism and radical libertarianism. He cited former Senator Joseph McCarthy as a model for the new movement.Murray Rothbard. \\"Right-Wing Populism: A Strategy for the Paleo Movement\\". 1992. In the 1990s, a \\"paleoconservative-paleolibertarian alliance was forged\\", centred on the John Randolph Club founded by traditionalist Catholic Thomas Fleming. Rockwell and Rothbard supported paleoconservative Republican candidate Pat Buchanan in the 1992 presidential election and described Buchanan as the political leader of the \\"paleo movement\\". In 1992, Rothbard declared that \\"with Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy\\".Lee Edwards, The Conservative Revolution: The Movement That Remade America, Simon and Schuster, 1999, p. 329. Three years later, he said Buchanan developed too much faith in economic planning and centralized state power which eventually led paleolibertarians to withdraw their support for Buchanan.Lew Rockwell, \\"What I Learned From Paleoism\\", at LewRockwell.com, May 2, 2002. In addition to Buchanan's economic nationalism, Paul Gottfried later complained of a lack of funding, infighting, media hostility or blackout and vilification as \\"racists\\" and \\"anti-Semites\\". Rothbard died in 1995. In 2007, Rockwell stated he no longer considered himself a \\"paleolibertarian\\" and was \\"happy with the term libertarian\\".\\"Do You Consider Yourself a Libertarian?\\", Kenny Johnsson interviews Lew Rockwell for The Liberal Post , as posted on Lew Rockwell.com, May 25, 2007.  Controversy  Political scientist and activist Jean Hardisty describes paleolibertarianism as entailing \\"explicit racism, anti-Semitism, and sexism\\". She notes Rothbard's praise of The Bell Curve, a controversial work which argues that there are demonstrable IQ differences among racial groups; and the Rothbard-Rockwell Report's publishing of an article written by Samuel T. Francis which asserted that \\"of the two major races in the United States today, only one possesses the capacity to create and sustain\\" suitable levels of civilization.Hardisty, Jean (1999).

Author holds a Ph.D. in Political Science from Northwestern University.  Ron Paul newsletters  The libertarian publication Reason asserted that \\"a half-dozen longtime libertarian activists‚Äîincluding some still close to Ron Paul‚Äîall named the same man as Paul's chief ghostwriter: Ludwig von Mises Institute founder Llewellyn Rockwell, Jr.\\", although Rockwell denied it.Matt Welch, \\"Old News\\"? \\"Rehashed for Over a Decade\\"?, Reason, January 11, 2008.Julain Sanchez and David Weigel, Who Wrote Ron Paul's Newsletters?, Reason, January 16, 2008.Joe Conason, Rand Paul The roots of Rand Paul‚Äôs civil rights resentment, Salon, May 21, 2010.David Weigel, Our Odd Ron Paul \\"Moment\\", Slate, December 15, 2011.Alex Massie, Ron Paul's Newsletter Problem, The Spectator, December 22, 2011.  Revival = United States  In 2012, former National Review writer John Derbyshire argued that \\"since Lew Rockwell joined La Raza\\" (referring to a LewRockwell.com article with a soft open-borders advocacy), Hans-Hermann Hoppe was the last real paleolibertarian standing. Yet paleolibertarianism had hardly disappeared from America, with Karen De CosterKaren De Coster, \\"About\\" . and Justin Raimondo both continuing to use the term to describe themselves both during and after Ron Paul's presidential campaigns.Justin Raimondo, \\"Ron Paul and the Prospects of Paleo-Libertarianism\\". In a move similar to his and Murray Rothbard's support for Pat Buchanan, Lew Rockwell was sympathetic to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, particularly for his stance on illegal immigration,\\"The Trump Phenomenon\\" The Tom Woods Show along with Justin Raimondo, who voted for Trump on the basis of his foreign policy. In a 2016 pre-election debate with Reason editor Nick Gillespie, Austrian School anarcho-capitalist economist Walter Block advised libertarians living in battleground states to support Trump rather than cast their votes for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, citing critical foreign policy differences between the Republican and Democratic frontrunners.Gillespie, Nick (29 October 2016). \\"Should Libertarians Vote for Trump?

In line with these views, paleolibertarian columnist Ilana Mercerhttps://mises.org/profile/ilana- mercerhttps://bigleaguepolitics.com/interview-writer-ilana-mercer-takes-on- the-cato-institutes-left-libertarianism authored a book in June 2016 about presidential candidate Trump titled The Trump Revolution: The Donald's Creative Destruction Deconstructed, the first critical examination of then- candidate Trump from a paleolibertarian perspective.https://townhall.com/columnists/jackkerwick/2016/07/20/the-trump- revolution-the-donalds-creative-destruction-deconstructed-a-review-of-the- first-libertarian-case-for-the-trump-process-n2195251 In discussing Mercer's book, Objectivist-libertarian scholar Chris Matthew Sciabarra observed that Mercer endorsed \\"not necessarily the policies of Trump, but 'The Process of Trump'\\".https://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/notablog/archives/002136.html Scabbarra further noted that \\"[t]he most interesting of her arguments is the bolstering of liberty by Donald J. Trump [...] smashing an enmeshed political spoils system to bits: the media complex, the political and party complex, the conservative poseur complex. In the age of unconstitutional government‚ÄîDemocratic and Republican‚Äîthis process of creative destruction can only increase the freedom quotient\\". Jeff Deist, president of the Mises Institute, a right-libertarian think tank for promoting Rothbardian anarcho- capitalism and the Austrian School of economics, said of the alt-right that he found their writings \\"interesting [...] and somewhat refreshing\\".\\"Alt-Right vs. Socialist Left\\" Mises Institute In 2017, Deist concluded a speech at the Mises Institute titled \\"For a New Libertarian\\", arguing: \\"In other words, blood and soil and God and nation still matter to people. Libertarians ignore this at the risk of irrelevance\\".https://mises.org/blog/new-libertarian This led to criticism from bleeding-heart libertarian Steve Horwitz, who argued that \\"the invocation of 'blood and soil' as something that libertarians should recognize as a valid concern and should appeal to should be chilling. That phrase, which has a history going back at least to the 19th century, was central to the Nazi movement and was at the core of their justification for eliminating those people who did not have connections to the German homeland\\". Horwitz ultimately concluded that libertarianism was not about a narrow view of family, religion, culture and civil society, but instead \\"liberal tolerance, universalism, and cosmopolitanism, putting the freedom and harmony of all people ahead of the supposed interests of any parochial sub-group, and especially ones defined by the artificial boundaries of nation-states and their subsets\\".http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2017/08/rhetoric- libertarians-unfortunate-appeal-alt-right/ White supremacist blog The Right Stuff also exhibits features of paleolibertarianism. One post has criticised the mainstream right in the following terms: \\"While they lost or ignore topics like race, nativism and the culture war, they have an obsession with neoliberal economics and neocon geopolitics\\". They have also been largely supportive of Rockwell, yet they have criticized his \\"move away from inflammatory newsletters\\".  Canada  In 2014, controversial voluntaryist blogger and podcaster Stefan Molyneux started to become more culturally conservative than he had been previously. He has released podcasts of his Freedomain Radio show addressing topics such as Western culture,\\"The Impending Collapse of Western Civilisation\\" Stefan Molyneux immigration\\"The Truth About Immigration\\" Stefan Molyneux and group differences in cognitive ability.\\"IQ and Immigration\\" Stefan Molyneux Like Lew Rockwell, he has supported Donald Trump for the presidency of the United States.\\"The Untruth About Donald Trump\\" Stefan Molyneux Property and Freedom Society member Christian Robitaille has argued for an alliance of paleolibertarians and traditionalist conservative in Quebec.  United Kingdom  In October 2013, the Traditional Britain Group showed interest in certain paleolibertarian ideas. In March 2014, it hosted a seminar including a track led by Andrew Linley titled \\"Politics: Destroyer of Natural Order\\". John Kersey, vice president of the Traditional Britain Group, describes himself as a \\"radical traditionalist and paleolibertarian\\". In October 2014, former UK Independence Party Member of Parliament and Mises UK president Godfrey Bloom gave a speech to the annual conference of Traditional Britain entitled \\"Why Traditionalism and Libertarianism are Not Incompatible\\". Sean Gabb, the former Director of the Libertarian Alliance, is a close friend of Hans-Hermann Hoppe, attending his Property and Freedom Society conferences every year in Bodrum. Gabb is a paleolibertarian in some respects and a critic of mass immigration. Gabb has addressed Traditional Britain Group conferences in efforts at classical liberal outreach to traditionalists. Keir Martland, Gabb's successor, has written favourably about the prospects for a new \\"paleo- alliance\\", arguing that \\"a conservative society cannot exist under an oppressive state just as much as a libertarian society cannot exist in a cultural and moral vacuum\\". In the essay \\"On Left and Right, Libertarianism, and The Donald\\", Martland is sympathetic to the nationalism of Donald Trump, writing: \\"When compared with rule by a socialist mob or rule by a hostile oligarchy of globalists, neither giving a damn about the Nation but only about plunder, nationalism comes off comparatively very well indeed\\".https://misesuk.org/2016/09/20/on-left-and-right-libertarianism-and- the-donald/  See also  * Austrian School * Coalition for the Renewal of the Republic‚ÄìLiberty and Hope * Criticism of democracy * Dark Enlightenment * Libertarian conservatism * Libertarian perspectives on immigration * National conservatism * Paleoconservatism * Party of Free Citizens * Radical right (United States) * Real Politics Union * Right-libertarianism * Right-wing populism  References  Category:Anarcho-capitalism by form Category:Austrian School Category:Libertarianism by form Category:Libertarianism in the United States Category:Right-libertarianism ","title":"Paleolibertarianism"},{"id":"433283","text":"Frances Perkins (born Fannie Coralie Perkins; April 10, 1880 ‚Äì May 14, 1965) was an American workers-rights advocate who served as the U.S. Secretary of Labor from 1933 to 1945, the longest serving in that position, and the first woman appointed to the U.S. Cabinet. As a loyal supporter of her friend, Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR), she helped pull the labor movement into the New Deal coalition. She and Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes were the only original members of the Roosevelt cabinet to remain in office for his entire presidency. During her term as Secretary of Labor, Perkins executed many aspects of the New Deal, including the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Public Works Administration and its successor the Federal Works Agency, and the labor portion of the National Industrial Recovery Act. With the Social Security Act she established unemployment benefits, pensions for the many uncovered elderly Americans, and welfare for the poorest Americans. She pushed to reduce workplace accidents and helped craft laws against child labor. Through the Fair Labor Standards Act, she established the first minimum wage and overtime laws for American workers, and defined the standard forty-hour work week. She formed governmental policy for working with labor unions and helped to alleviate strikes by way of the United States Conciliation Service. Perkins dealt with many labor questions during World War II, when skilled labor was vital and women were moving into formerly male jobs.Downey, Kirstin. The Woman Behind the New Deal, 2009, p. 337. She was the subject of the documentary film \\"Summoned\\" (2020). Early life Fannie Coralie Perkins was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Susan Ella Perkins (nee Bean) (1849 ‚Äì 1927) and Frederick William Perkins (1844 ‚Äì 1916), the owner of a stationer's business (both of her parents originally were from Maine).1880 Census Fannie Perkins had one sister, Ethel Perkins Harrington (1884‚Äì1965). The family could trace their roots to colonial America, and the women had a tradition of work in education. She spent much of her childhood in Worcester, Massachusetts. Frederick loved Greek literature and passed that love on to Fannie. Perkins attended the Classical High School in Worcester. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in chemistry and physics in 1902. While attending Mount Holyoke, Perkins discovered progressive politics and the suffrage movement. She was also named class president. One of her professors was Annah May Soule, who assigned students to tour a factory to study working conditions;Annah May Soule Papers, Mount Holyoke College Archives and Special Collections, South Hadley, MA. Perkins recalled Soule's course as an important influence. Early career and continuing education After college, she held a variety of teaching positions, including a position teaching chemistry from 1904 to 1906 at Ferry Hall School (now Lake Forest Academy), an all girls school in Lake Forest, Illinois. In Chicago, she volunteered at settlement houses, including Hull House where she worked with Jane Addams. She changed her name from Fannie to Frances when she joined the Episcopal church in 1905.Kennedy, Susan E. \\"Perkins, Frances\\". American National Biography Online. Oxford University Press, Feb. 2000. Web. March 27, 2013. In 1907, she moved to Philadelphia and enrolled at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School to learn economics. After two years in Philadelphia, Perkins moved to Greenwich Village, where she attended Columbia University and became active in the suffrage movement. In support of the suffrage movement, Perkins attended protests and meetings and advocated for the cause on street corners. She obtained a master's degree in political science from Columbia in 1910.Downey, Kristin. The Woman Behind the New Deal. Anchor Books, 2010, p. 11, p. 25. She achieved statewide prominence as head of the New York office of the National Consumers League in 1910 and lobbied with vigor for better working hours and conditions. Perkins also taught as a professor of sociology at Adelphi College. The next year, she witnessed the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, a pivotal event in her life. The factory employed hundreds of workers, mostly young women, but lacked fire escapes. When the building caught fire, many workers tried unsuccessfully to escape through the windows. Just a year before these same women and girls had fought for and won the 54 hour work week and other benefits that Perkins had championed. One hundred forty-six workers died. It was because of this fire Frances Perkins would leave her office at the New York office of the National Consumers League and, on the recommendation of Theodore Roosevelt, become the executive secretary for the Committee on Safety of the City of New York. In 1913, Perkins was instrumental in getting New York to pass a \\"fifty-four-hour\\" bill capping the number of hours women and children could work. Perkins pressed for votes for the legislation, encouraging proponents including legislator Franklin Delano Roosevelt to filibuster while Perkins called state senators to make sure they could be present for the final vote. In 1912, Perkins resigned as head of the New York office of the National Consumers League to take the position of executive secretary with the Committee on Safety. The Committee on Safety was formed to increase fire safety following the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. As part of the Committee on Safety, Perkins investigated the fire at the Freeman plant in Binghamton, New York, in which 63 people died. Perkins blamed lax legislation for the loss.  Marriage and personal life  In 1913, Perkins married New York economist Paul Caldwell Wilson. She kept her maiden name because she did not want her activities in Albany to affect her husband, then the secretary to the New York City mayor. She defended her right to keep her maiden name in court. The couple had a daughter, Susanna, born in December 1916. Less than two years later, Wilson began to show signs of mental illness. He would be frequently institutionalized for mental illness for the remainder of their marriage.Downey, Kirstin. The Woman Behind the New Deal, 2009, p. 2. Perkins had retreated from public life following the birth of her daughter, but returned after her husband's illness in order to provide for her family. According to biographer Kirstin Downey, Susanna displayed \\"manic-depressive symptoms\\" as well.Downey, Kirstin. The Woman Behind the New Deal, 2009, p. 380. Although a few writers have speculated that Perkins privately had a romantic relationship with her friend Mary Harriman Rumsey, founder of the Junior League (the women lived together in Washington, D.C., until Rumsey's death in 1934), there is no evidence of a romantic relationship between them.  Return to work in New York  Prior to moving to Washington, D.C., Perkins held various positions in the New York State government. She had gained respect from the political leaders in the state of New York. In 1919, she was added to the Industrial Commission of the State of New York by Governor Al Smith. Her nomination was met with protests from both manufacturers and labor, neither of whom felt Perkins represented their interests. Smith stood by Perkins as someone who could be a voice for women and girls in the workforce and for her work on the Wagner Factory Investigating Committee. Although claiming the delay in Perkins' confirmation was not due to her sex, some state senators pointed to Perkins' not taking her husband's name as a sign that she was a radical. Perkins was confirmed on February 18, 1919, becoming one of the first female commissioners in New York, and began working out of New York City. The state senate-confirmed position made Perkins one of three commissioners overseeing the industrial code, and the supervisor of both the bureau of information and statistics and the bureau of mediation and arbitration. The position also came with an $8,000 salary, making Perkins the highest-paid woman in New York state government. Six months into her job, her fellow Commissioner James M. Lynch called Perkin's contributions \\"invaluable,\\" and added \\"[f]rom the work which Miss Perkins has accomplished I am convinced that more women ought to be placed in high positions throughout the state departments.\\" In 1929, the newly elected New York governor, Franklin Roosevelt, appointed Perkins as the inaugural New York State industrial commissioner.Our History ‚Äì New York State Department of Labor . Labor.ny.gov (March 25, 1911). Retrieved on 2013-08-12. As commissioner, Perkins supervised an agency with 1,800 employees. Having earned the co-operation and the respect of various political factions, Perkins helped put New York in the forefront of progressive reform. She expanded factory investigations, reduced the workweek for women to 48 hours, and championed minimum wage and unemployment insurance laws. She worked vigorously to put an end to child labor and to provide safety for women workers. Cabinet career Time (August 14, 1933) Theodore Peyser with President Roosevelt as he signs the National Labor Relations Act (June 6, 1933) In 1933, Roosevelt summoned Perkins to ask her to join his cabinet. Perkins presented FDR with a long list of labor programs she would fight for, from Social Security to minimum wage. ‚Äò‚ÄôNothing like this has ever been done in the United States before,‚Äù she told FDR. ‚ÄúYou know that, don‚Äôt you?‚Äô‚Äô Agreeing to back her, FDR nominated Perkins as Secretary of Labor. The nomination was met with support from the National League of Women Voters and the Women's Party. The American Federation of Labor criticized the selection of Perkins because of a perceived lack of ties to labor. As Secretary, Perkins oversaw the Department of Labor. Perkins went on to hold the position for twelve years, longer than any other Secretary of Labor. She also became the first woman to hold a cabinet position in the United States and thus became the first woman to enter the presidential line of succession. The selection of a woman to the cabinet had been rumored in the four previous administrations, with Roosevelt being the first to follow through. Roosevelt had witnessed Perkins‚Äô work first hand during their time in Albany. With few exceptions, President Roosevelt consistently supported the goals and programs of Secretary Perkins. As Secretary of Labor, Perkins played a key role in the cabinet by writing New Deal legislation, including minimum-wage laws. Her most important contribution, however, came in 1934 as chairwoman of the President's Committee on Economic Security (CES). In this post, she was involved in all aspects of its reports, including her hand in the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps and the She-She-She Camps. Perkins also drafted the Social Security Act of 1935. On the day the bill was signed into law, her husband escaped from a mental institution. In 1939, she came under fire from some members of Congress for refusing to deport the communist head of the west coast International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Harry Bridges. Ultimately, Bridges was vindicated by the Supreme Court. With the death of President Roosevelt, Harry Truman ascended to the office on April 12, 1945. Truman chose his own cabinet, including Lewis B. Schwellenbach as Secretary of Labor. Perkins' tenure as Secretary ended on June 30, 1945 with the swearing in of Schwellenbach. Later life Following her tenure as Secretary of Labor, in 1945 Perkins was asked by President Truman to serve on the United States Civil Service Commission. In her post as commissioner, Perkins spoke out against government officials requiring secretaries and stenographers to be physically attractive, blaming the practice for the shortage of secretaries and stenographers in the government. Perkins left the Civil Service Commission in 1952 when her husband died. During this period, she also published a memoir of her time in FDR's administration called The Roosevelt I Knew (1946, ) which covered her personal history with Franklin Roosevelt, starting from their meeting in 1910. Following her government service career, Perkins remained active as a teacher and lecturer at the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University until her death in 1965 at age 85. She also gave guest lectures at other universities, including two 15-lecture series at the University of Illinois Institute of Labor and Industrial relations in 1955 and 1958.Soderstrom, Carl; Soderstrom, Robert; Stevens, Chris; Burt, Andrew (2018). Forty Gavels: The Life of Reuben Soderstrom and the Illinois AFL-CIO. 3. Peoria, IL: CWS Publishing. p. 42. . At Cornell she lived at the Telluride House where she was one of the intellectual community's first female members. Kirstin Downey, author of The Woman Behind the New Deal: The Life of Frances Perkins, FDR's Secretary of Labor and His Moral Conscience, dubbed her time at the Telluride House \\"probably the happiest phase of her life\\". Perkins is buried in the Glidden Cemetery in Newcastle, Maine.\\"CAM Cover Story\\". Cornell Alumni Magazine.com (May 17, 1965). Retrieved on 2013-08-12. Legacy The Frances Perkins Building is the Washington, D.C. headquarters of the United States Department of Labor and is located at 200 Constitution Avenue NW and runs alongside Interstate 395 The Frances Perkins House, a U.S. National Historic Landmark since 1991, located at 2326 California Street, NW, Washington, D.C. Perkins would have been famous simply by being the first woman cabinet member, but her legacy also stems from her additional accomplishments. She was largely responsible for the U.S. adoption of social security, unemployment insurance, the federal minimum wage, and federal laws regulating child labor. The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church honors Perkins with a feast day on May 13. She was the winner of the \\"Golden Halo\\" in Lent Madness 2013, an educational tool hosted by Forward Movement Publications featuring the saints of the calendar of the Episcopal Church. In 1967, the Telluride House and Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations established the Frances Perkins Memorial Fellowship. In 1982, Perkins was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. In 2015, Perkins was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 LGBT History Month. In 2019, she was announced as one of the members of the inaugural class of the Government Hall of Fame. Also that year, Elizabeth Warren used a podium built with wood salvaged from the Perkins homestead. Character in historical context As the first female member of the presidential cabinet, Perkins had an unenviable challenge: she had to be as capable, as fearless, as tactful, and as politically astute as the other Washington politicians, in order to make it possible for other women to be accepted into the halls of power after her.The Tennessean, Arts & Entertainment, March 8, 2009, \\"The Woman Behind the New Deal\\" (Kirstin Downey). \\"Perkins ... not only had to do more than her male counterparts to prove herself, but she had to do it while dealing with rough-and-tumble labor leaders, a husband in and out of mental institutions, condescending bureaucrats and some Congress members hell-bent on impeaching her.\\" p. 11. Perkins had a cool personality that held her aloof from the crowd. On one occasion, however, she engaged in some heated name- calling with Alfred P. Sloan, the chairman of the board at General Motors. During a punishing United Auto Workers strike, she phoned Sloan in the middle of the night and called him a scoundrel and a skunk for not meeting the union's demands. She said, \\"You don't deserve to be counted among decent men. You'll go to hell when you die.\\" Sloan's late-night response was one of irate indignation.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, p. 68, Random House, New York, 2012. . Her results indicate her great love of workers and lower-class groups, but her Boston upbringing held her back from mingling freely and exhibiting personal affection. She was well-suited for the high-level efforts to effect sweeping reforms, but never caught the public's eye or its affection.Frances Perkins Collection. Mount Holyoke College Archives Memorials and monuments President Jimmy Carter renamed the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C. the Frances Perkins Building in 1980. Perkins' was honored with a postage stamp that same year. Her home in Washington from 1937 to 1940, and her Maine family home are both designated National Historic Landmarks. The Frances Perkins Center is a nonprofit organization located in Damariscotta, Maine. Its mission is to fulfill the legacy of Frances Perkins through educating visitors on her work and programs and preserving the Perkins family homestead for future generations. The Center regularly hosts events and exhibitions for the public. Perkins remains a prominent alumna of Mount Holyoke College, whose Frances Perkins Program allows \\"women of non- traditional age\\" (i.e., age 24 or older) to complete a Bachelor of Arts degree.

The picture stars Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughn, and Jacqueline Bisset. The screenplay by Alan R. Trustman and Harry Kleiner was based on the 1963 novel Mute Witness, by Robert L. Fish, writing under the pseudonym Robert L. Pike. Lalo Schifrin wrote the original jazz-inspired score. Robert Duvall has a small role as a cab driver who provides information to McQueen. The star of the movie, a 1968 Mustang Fastback, was sold at Mecum Auctions for a record price of $3.4 million ($3.7 million including auction fees) on January 10, 2020. The film was made by McQueen's Solar Productions company, with his partner Robert Relyea as executive producer. Released by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts on October 17, 1968, the film was a critical and box- office smash, later winning the Academy Award for Best Film Editing (Frank P. Keller) and receiving a nomination for Best Sound. Writers Trustman and Kleiner won a 1969 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Bullitt is also notable for its car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco, which is regarded as one of the most influential in movie history. In 2007, Bullitt was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, as \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".  Plot  On a Friday night in Chicago, mobster Johnny Ross briefly meets his brother, Pete, after fleeing from the Outfit. The next morning SFPD detective Lieutenant Frank Bullitt and his team, Delgetti and Stanton are tasked by Senator Walter Chalmers with guarding Ross over the weekend, until he can be presented as a witness to a Senate subcommittee hearing on organized crime on Monday morning. The detectives are told he is in a cheap hotel on Embarcadero. Delgetti takes the first shift followed by Stanton and then Bullitt. At 1am Sunday, while Stanton is phoning Bullitt to say Chalmers and a friend want to come up, Ross unchains the room door. Two hitmen burst in shooting Stanton in the leg and Ross in the neck. Chalmers holds Bullitt responsible. Ross dies in hospital from his wounds but Bullitt conceals the death to keep the investigation open, sending the body to the morgue as a John Doe. An informant says that Ross was in town because he stole millions of dollars from the Chicago Outfit. Bullitt also finds out he made a long-distance phone call to a hotel in San Mateo. While driving his Ford Mustang, Bullitt becomes aware he is being followed by a Dodge Charger driven by the two hitmen. An extended chase ensues through the streets of San Francisco to Brisbane. Eventually the Dodge crashes off the road, killing its occupants in a fiery explosion. Bullitt and Delgetti are confronted by their boss, Captain Sam Bennett, as well as Chalmers (who is assisted by SFPD Captain Baker). After being served a writ of habeas corpus, Bullitt reveals that Ross has died. Bennett ignores the writ and lets Bullitt investigate the lead of the long-distance phone call to San Mateo. Due to his car being damaged in the chase, Bullitt gets a ride from his girlfriend Cathy. At the hotel, Bullitt finds the woman who phoned, garrotted, in her room. Cathy follows the police to the crime scene and is horrified. On the way back to San Francisco she confronts Bullitt about his work, saying \\"Frank, you are living in a sewer\\". She wonders, \\"What will happen to us?\\" While examining the victim's luggage, Bullitt and Delgetti discover a travel brochure for Rome and traveler's checks made out to an Albert and Dorothy Renick. Bullitt requests their passport applications from Chicago. Bullitt, Captain Bennett, Chalmers and Captain Baker gather around the telecopier as the applications arrive. It turns out Chalmers sent Bullitt to guard a doppelg√§nger, Albert Renick, a used car salesman from Chicago, while his wife Dorothy was staying in San Mateo. Bullitt realises that Ross was playing the politically-ambitious Chalmers by using Renick as a decoy so he could slip out of the country Sunday night. Delgetti and Bullitt watch the Rome gate at San Francisco International Airport, however, the real Ross (on Renick's passport) has switched to an earlier London flight with his ticket for Rome. Bullitt boards the plane after it is ordered to return to the terminal but the mobster escapes through the rear cabin door. In the crowded passenger terminal, Ross kills a deputy sheriff before being shot dead by Bullitt. Chalmers arrives to survey the scene, but leaves saying nothing. Bullitt arrives home early on Monday morning to find Cathy, who, having chosen to stay, is asleep in his bed. Cast * Steve McQueen as Lt.

Warner as \\"doing authority differently\\". Development Bullitt was director Yates's first American film. He was hired after McQueen saw his 1967 UK feature Robbery, with its extended car chase. Joe Levine, whose Embassy Pictures had distributed Robbery, didn't much like the film, but Alan Trustman, who saw the picture the very week he was writing the Bullitt chase scenes, insisted that McQueen, Relyea and D'Antoni (none of whom had ever heard of Yates) see Robbery and consider Yates as director for Bullitt. Casting McQueen based the character of Frank Bullitt on San Francisco Inspector Dave Toschi, with whom he worked prior to filming.Steve McQueen ‚Äì The Making Of Bullitt, 1968 Warner Bros. promotional short film.Graysmith, Robert. (1986). Zodiac, p. 96. St. Martin's Press. McQueen even copied Toschi's unique \\"fast draw\\" shoulder holster. Toschi later became famous, along with Inspector Bill Armstrong, as the lead San Francisco investigators of the Zodiac Killer murders that began shortly after the release of Bullitt. Toschi is played by Mark Ruffalo in the film Zodiac, in which Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) mentions that \\"McQueen got the idea for the holster from Toschi.\\"IMDB The Zodiac Car chase burning rubber in the car chase scene alt=Photograph of a car with a driver looking backwards out of its window. The car's rear tire is smoking from the friction of spinning against the road. At the time of the film's release, the exciting car chase scenes, featuring McQueen at the wheel in all driver-visual scenes, generated prodigious excitement. Leonard Maltin has called it a \\"now-classic car chase, one of the screen's all-time best.\\" Emanuel Levy wrote in 2003 that \\"Bullitt contains one of the most exciting car chases in film history, a sequence that revolutionized Hollywood's standards.\\" In his obituary for Peter Yates, Bruce Weber wrote, \\"Mr. Yates' reputation probably rests most securely on Bullitt (1968), his first American film ‚Äì and indeed, on one particular scene, an extended car chase that instantly became a classic.\\" =Filming= The chase scene starts at 1h:05m into the film. The total time of the scene is 10 minutes and 53 seconds, beginning in the Fisherman's Wharf area of San Francisco, at Columbus and Chestnut (although Bullitt first notices the hitmen following his car while driving west on Army Street, now Cesar Chavez Street, just after passing under Highway 101), followed by Midtown shooting on Hyde and Laguna streets, with shots of Coit Tower and locations around and on Filbert and University streets. The scene ends outside the city at the Guadalupe Canyon Parkway in San Bruno Mountain near Brisbane. The route has been mapped, showing that it is geographically impossible to take place in real time. Two 1968 390 cu. in. V8 Ford Mustang GT Fastbacks (325 hp) with four-speed manual transmissions were used for the chase scene, both lent by the Ford Motor Company to Warner Bros. as part of a promotional agreement. The Mustangs' engines, brakes and suspensions were heavily modified for the chase by veteran car racer and technician Max Balchowsky. Ford also originally lent two Galaxie sedans for the chase scenes, but the producers found the cars too heavy for the jumps over the hills of San Francisco. They were replaced with two 1968 375 hp 440 Magnum V8-powered Dodge Chargers. The engines in both Dodge Charger models were left largely unmodified, but the suspensions were mildly upgraded to cope with the demands of the stunt work. The director called for maximum speeds of about , but the cars (including the chase cars filming) at times reached speeds of over . Driver's point-of-view shots were used to give the audience a participant's feel of the chase. Filming took three weeks, resulting in nine minutes and 42 seconds of pursuit. Multiple takes were spliced into a single end product resulting in discontinuity: heavy damage on the passenger side of Bullitt's car can be seen much earlier than the incident producing it, and the Charger appears to lose five wheel covers, with different ones missing in different shots. Shooting from multiple angles simultaneously and creating a montage from the footage to give the illusion of different streets also resulted in the speeding cars passing the same vehicles at several different times, including, as widely noted, a green Volkswagen Beetle. In one scene the Charger crashes into the camera; the damaged front fender is noticeable in later scenes. Local authorities did not allow the car chase to be filmed on the Golden Gate Bridge, but did permit it in Midtown locations including Bernal Heights and the Mission District, and on the outskirts of neighboring Brisbane. McQueen, at the time a world-class race car driver, drove in the close-up scenes, while stunt coordinator Carey Loftin, stuntman and motorcycle racer Bud Ekins, and McQueen's usual stunt driver, Loren Janes, drove for the high-speed part of the chase and performed other dangerous stunts. Ekins, who doubled for McQueen in The Great Escape sequence where McQueen's character jumps over a barbed wire fence on a motorcycle, performs a lowsider crash stunt in front of a skidding truck during the Bullitt chase. The Mustang's interior rear view mirror goes up and down depending on who is driving: when the mirror is up, McQueen is visible behind the wheel, when it is down, a stunt man is driving. The black Dodge Charger was driven by veteran stunt driver Bill Hickman, who played one of the hitmen and helped with the chase scene choreography. The other hitman was played by Paul Genge, who played a character who had ridden a Dodge off the road to his death in an episode of Perry Mason (\\"The Case of the Sausalito Sunrise\\") two years earlier. In a magazine article many years later, one of the drivers involved in the chase sequence remarked that the Charger - with a larger engine (big-block 440 cu. in. versus the 390 cu. in.) and greater horsepower (375 versus 325) - was so much faster than the Mustang that the drivers had to keep backing off the accelerator to prevent the Charger from pulling away from the Mustang. =Editing= The editing of the car chase likely won Frank P. Keller the editing Oscar for 1968, and has been included in lists of the \\"Best Editing Sequences of All-Time\\". Paul Monaco has written, \\"The most compelling street footage of 1968, however, appeared in an entirely contrived sequence, with nary a hint of documentary feel about it ‚Äì the car chase through the streets of San Francisco in Bullitt, created from footage shot over nearly five weeks. Billy Fraker, the cinematographer for the film, attributed the success of the chase sequence primarily to the work of the editor, Frank P. Keller. At the time, Keller was credited with cutting the piece in such a superb manner that he made the city of San Francisco a \\"character\\" in the film.\\" The editing of the scene was not without difficulties; Ralph Rosenblum wrote in 1979 that \\"those who care about such things may know that during the filming of the climactic chase scene in Bullitt, an out-of-control car filled with dummies tripped a wire which prematurely sent a costly set up in flames, and that editor Frank Keller salvaged the near-catastrophe with a clever and unusual juxtaposition of images that made the explosion appear to go off on time.\\" This chase scene has also been cited by critics as groundbreaking in its realism and originality. In the release print and the print shown for many years, a scene in which the Charger actually hits the camera causing a red flare on screen, which many feel added to the realism, was edited out on DVD prints to the disappointment of many fans. Music The original score was composed by Lalo Schifrin to track the various moods and the action of the film, with Schifrin's signature contemporary American jazz style. The tracks on the soundtrack album are alternative versions of those heard in the film, re-recorded by Schifrin with leading jazz musicians, including Bud Shank (flute), Ray Brown (bass), Howard Roberts (guitar) and Larry Bunker (drums). In 2000, the original arrangements as heard in the movie were recreated by Schifrin in a recording session with the WDR Big Band in Cologne, Germany, and released on the Aleph label.Payne, D. Lalo Schifrin discography accessed July 25, 2013. This release also includes re-recordings of the 1968 soundtrack album arrangements for some tracks. In 2009, the never-before-released original recording of the score heard in the movie, recorded by Schifrin on the Warner Bros. scoring stage with engineer Dan Wallin, was made available by Film Score Monthly. Some score passages and cues are virtually identical to the official soundtrack album, while many softer, moodier cues from the film were not chosen or had been rewritten for the soundtrack release. Also included are additional cues that were not used in the film. In addition, the two-CD set features the official soundtrack album, newly mixed from the 1\\" master tape. In the restaurant scene with McQueen and Bissett, the live band playing in the background is Meridian West, a jazz quartet that McQueen had seen performing at The Trident, a famous restaurant in Sausalito.\\"By 1968 the group was performing at The Trident, a prominent jazz club in Sausalito and the group became a regular performer at Glide Memorial on Sundays. By March of 1968, Meridian West had been noticed by Steve McQueen, the actor, who was captivated by a performance at The Trident. McQueen gave the group a visual cameo appearance in the movie, \\"Bullitt,\\" which was being filmed in San Francisco in April.\\" - Meridian Meridian West web site (archived at WebCite). A similar account is available at Meridian West Folk Jazz Ensemble with Allan Pimentel (archived at WebCite). Reception Bullitt garnered both critical acclaim and box office success. Box office The film opened at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on Thursday, October 17, 1968, together with a new stage show. It grossed $210,000 in its first week, including a Hall record Saturday of $49,073. Produced on a $5.5 million budget, the film grossed over $42.3 million in the US, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 1968. Critical response Bullitt was well received by critics and is considered by some to be one of the best films of 1968. At the time, Renata Adler made the film a New York Times Critics' Pick, calling it a \\"terrific movie, just right for Steve McQueen ‚Äì-fast, well acted, written the way people talk.\\" According to Adler, \\"the ending should satisfy fans from Dragnet to Camus.\\" In 2004, The New York Times placed the film on its list of The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made. In 2011, Time magazine listed it among \\"The 15 Greatest Movie Car Chases of All Time\\", describing it as \\"the one, the first, the granddaddy, the chase on the top of almost every list\\", and saying \\"Bullitts car chase is a reminder that every great such scene is a triumph of editing as much as it is stunt work. Naturally, it won that year's Academy Award for Best Editing\\". Among 21st-century critics, it holds a 97% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, representing positive reviews from 34 of 35 critics with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Steve McQueen is cool as ice in this thrilling police procedural that also happens to contain the arguably greatest car chase ever.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 80 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \\"Universal acclaim\\". Awards and honors The film was nominated for and won several critical awards. Frank P. Keller won the 1969 Academy Award for Best Film Editing, and it was also nominated for Best Sound. Five nominations at the BAFTA Film Awards for 1969 included Best Director for Peter Yates, Best Supporting Actor for Robert Vaughn, Best Cinematography for William A. Fraker, Best Film Editing for Frank P. Keller, and Best Sound Track. Robert Fish, Harry Kleiner, and Alan Trustman won the 1969 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture. Keller won the American Cinema Editors Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film. The film also received the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Cinematography (William A. Fraker) and the Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing ‚Äì Feature Film. It was successful at the 1970 Laurel Awards, winning Golden Laurel awards for Best Action Drama, Best Action Performance (Steve McQueen) and Best Female New Face (Jacqueline Bisset). In 2000, the Society of Camera Operators awarded Bullitt its \\"Historical Shot\\" award to David M. Walsh. Legacy The Bullitt Mustang on display at the LeMay Car Museum in Tacoma, Washington, 2019 The famous car chase was later spoofed in Peter Bogdanovich's screwball comedy film What's Up, Doc?, the Clint Eastwood film The Dead Pool, in the Futurama episode \\"Bendin' in the Wind\\", and in the Archer season six episode \\"The Kanes\\". The car chase can be seen playing on the screen in the drive-in theater scene in 2014 film, Need for Speed. The 13th episode of TV series Alcatraz includes a recreation of the chase scene, with newer models of the Mustang and Charger. Bullitt producer Philip D'Antoni went on to film two more car chases, for The French Connection and The Seven-Ups, both set and shot in New York City. The Ford Mustang name has been closely associated with the film. In 2001, the Ford Motor Company released the Bullitt edition Ford Mustang GT.The Auto Channel ‚Äì Ford Mustang Bullitt (2001) Another version of the Ford Mustang Bullitt, which is closer to resembling the original film Mustang, was released in 2008, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the film.2008 Ford Mustang Bullitt ‚Äì First Test from Motor Trend A third version was released in 2018 for the 2019 and 2020 model years. In 2009, Bud Brutsman of Overhaulin' built an authentic-looking replica of the Bullitt Mustang, fully loaded with modern components, for the five-episode 2009 TV series, Celebrity Rides: Hollywood's Speeding Bullitt, hosted by Chad McQueen, son of Steve McQueen.McQueen's '68 \\"Bullitt\\" Mustang Tribute Build from BoldRide.com The Mustang is featured in the 2003 video game Ford Racing 2, in a Drafting challenge, on a course named Port Side. It appears in the Movie Stars category, along with other famous cars like the Ford Torino from Starsky & Hutch and the Ford Mustang Mach 1 from Diamonds Are Forever. In the 2011 video game, Driver: San Francisco, the \\"Bite the Bullet\\" mission is based on the famous chase scene, with licensed versions of the Mustang and Charger from the film. One of the two Mustangs used to film the chase scene was said to have been scrapped after filming, due to damage and liability concerns, while the other was sold to an employee of Warner Bros. In 1974, the car was purchased by Robert Kiernan, from a classified ad in Road & Track, for a price variously reported as $3,500 and $6,000. According to the family, it was used for several years as the family car, then retired; in 1977, McQueen made an attempt to buy it, but the family declined. Kiernan's son, Sean, began to restore the car in 2014, and had it authenticated in 2016, with documentation that included McQueen's letters offering to purchase it. On January 10, 2020, the car was sold to an unidentified buyer by Mecum Auctions at its Kissimmee auction, for a record price of $3.7 million. The other stunt Mustang was found in 2016 at a junkyard in Mexico; subsequent paint jobs suggested it had been used for several years rather than scrapped. The car was conclusively verified by an automobile authentication expert, using the vehicle's VIN and other identifying information. It was shipped to California, where the owners planned a full restoration. Steve McQueen's likeness as Frank Bullitt was used in two Ford commercials. The first was for the Europe-only 1997 Ford Puma, which featured a special effects montage of McQueen (who died in 1980) driving a new Puma around San Francisco before parking it in a studio apartment garage beside the film Mustang and the motorcycle from The Great Escape. In a 2004 commercial for the 2005 Mustang, special effects are again used to create the illusion of McQueen driving the new Mustang, after a man receives a Field of Dreams-style epiphany and constructs a racetrack in the middle of a cornfield.AutoBlog ‚Äì Ford Mustang Steve McQueen Ad Revealed from autoblog.com Several items of clothing worn by McQueen's Bullitt received a boost in popularity thanks to the film: desert boots, a trench coat, a blue turtleneck sweater and, most famously, a brown tweed jacket with elbow patches.Bonhams Lot 100 From The Chad McQueen Collection: The Bullitt Jacket.

The site also houses a training and conference centre, including the hosting of social events such as weddings and birthday parties. The 44 hectare (109 acre) site is in Sewardstonebury, Epping Forest, close to Chingford, London. In the late Middle Ages the area was a farm, growing to a wealthy estate that fell into disrepair towards 1900. It was bought in 1919 by Scout Commissioner William de Bois Maclaren and given to The Scout Association of the United Kingdom to provide camping to London Scouts, and training for Scouters. As Scout Leaders from all countries of the world have come to Gilwell Park for their Wood Badge training, it is one of the landmarks of the world Scouting movement. The site contains a number of camping fields, indoor accommodation, historical sites, monuments of Scouting, and outdoor adventure activities. The site can accommodate events up to 10,000 people, and regularly does so at Scouting events throughout the year. Gilwell Park is also home to Scout Adventures Gilwell Park, one of twelve national centres run directly by or in partnership with the Scout Association, alongside Buddens, Crawfordsburn, Downe, Fordell Firs, Great Tower, Hawkhirst, Lochgoilhead, Meggernie, Woodhouse Park, Yr Hafod and Youlbury.  History = Original farm in late Middle Ages  The history of Gilwell Park can be traced to 1407, when John Crow owned Gyldiefords, the land that would eventually become Gilwell Park. Between 1407 and 1422, Crow sold the land to Richard Rolfe, and the area became known as Gillrolfes, \\"Gill\\" being Old English for glen. Following Rolfe's death in 1422, different sections of the property came to be called \\"Great Gilwell\\" and \\"Little Gilwell\\". The two areas were named after the Old English \\"wella\\", or spring. A farmhouse has stood at Gilwell Farm ever since. Around this time, an adjoining property was purchased by Richard Osborne. In 1442, he built a large dwelling called Osborne Hall, which stood for 300 years. Legend has it that in the early 16th century, King Henry VIII owned the land and built a hunting lodge for his son Edward. Around 1736 the highwayman Dick Turpin began using Gilwell's forests to conceal himself and for ambushing travellers and freight along roads leading into London. In 1754, William Skrimshire purchased Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell, and half of Osborne's estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall. That building is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time, but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?‚Äì1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings and size of the residence. Tresilian's first wife, Margaret Holland, died young after bearing three daughters. He then married Elizabeth Fawson. Desiring that Gilwell pass on to his eldest daughter, also named Margaret (1750 ‚Äì c.1844), Tresilian drew up a detailed prenuptial agreement with Fawson's father. By the time of Tresilian's death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766‚Äì1834), the elder brother of the painter George Chinnery.  Rich estate in 18th century  The Chinnerys were wealthy and influential. William Chinnery's father, also named William, owned trading ships and named one Gilwell in 1800. William and Margaret Chinnery initially resided in London, and after three years of marriage and inheriting Gilwell in 1792, they moved to Gilwell in 1793. They soon shocked the populace by renaming Osborne Hall to \\"Gilwell Hall\\". William Chinnery expanded Gilwell's land holdings through significant purchases over 15 years and, with his wife, transformed it into a country estate with gardens, paths, and statues. Parts of the garden, paths, and dwelling modifications exist into the 21st century. William Chinnery was exposed as the embezzler of a small fortune from the British Treasury where he worked and was dismissed from all his posts on 12 March 1812. Margaret Chinnery was forced to sign over Gilwell Estate to the Exchequer on 2 July 1812. The Chinnery family was prominent enough that members of the English nobility visited often during the 1790s and early 19th century. King George III visited on occasion, and the Prince Regent, who later became George IV, was a regular visitor. George III's seventh son, Prince Adolphus, became a family friend, lived at Gilwell for a while, and tutored their eldest son George. Gilpin Gorst bought the estate in 1815 at public auction, and his son sold it to Thomas Usborne in 1824. When London Bridge was replaced in 1826, Usborne bought pieces of the stone balustrades, which date to 1209, and erected them behind the White House around the Buffalo Lawn. The estate changed ownership more times, but these families did not maintain the property and it fell into disrepair by 1900. Reverend Cranshaw, a local resident, bought the estate in 1911 and was the last owner prior to the Boy Scout Association, as it was then known.  Scouting connection  The estate's condition declined more during the 1910s. William de Bois Maclaren was a publisher and Scout Commissioner from Rosneath, Dumbartonshire, Scotland. During a business trip to London, Maclaren was saddened to see that Scouts in the East End had no suitable outdoor area to conduct their activities. He contacted Lord Robert Baden-Powell, who appointed P.B. Nevill to handle the matter. Nevill was Scout Commissioner of the East End. On 20 November 1918 over dinner at Roland House, the Scout Hostel in Stepney, Maclaren agreed to donate ¬£7,000 to the project. Part of the agreement included narrowing the areas to look for suitable land to Hainault Forest and Epping Forest. Rover Scouts searched both without success, but then John Gayfer, a young assistant Scoutmaster, suggested Gilwell Hall, a place he went bird-watching. Nevill visited the estate and was impressed, though the buildings were in poor condition. The estate was for sale for ¬£7,000, the price Maclaren had donated. The estate totaled at the time. The estate was purchased in early 1919 by Maclaren for the Boy Scout Association. Nevill first took his Rover Scouts to begin repairing the estate on Maundy Thursday, 17 April 1919. On this visit, the Rovers slept in the gardener's shed in the orchard because the ground was so wet they could not pitch tents. They called this shed \\"The Pigsty\\" and recently restored, it still stands, as it is the site of the first Scout campsite at Gilwell Park. Maclaren was a frequent visitor to Gilwell Park and helped repair the buildings. His dedication was so great that he donated another ¬£3,000. Maclaren's interest had been in providing a campground, but Baden-Powell envisioned a training centre for Scouters. An official opening was planned for 19 July 1919 but it was delayed until Saturday, 26 July 1919 so that Scouts could participate in the Official Peace Festival commemorating the end of World War I. Invitations were changed by hand to save money. Significant remodeling and construction was done in the 1920s. Because of limited finances, few improvements were made during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Baden-Powell never lived at Gilwell Park but he often camped, lectured, taught courses, and attended meetings. He emphasized the importance of Scouters' training at Gilwell Park for Scouting by taking it as the territorial designation in his peerage title of 1st Baron Baden-Powell of Gilwell in 1929 when the barony was conferred upon him by the king.  Origin of the axe and log totem  Two examples of the Gilwell axe and log emblem: 2019 Gilwell Reunion badge which marked the 100th anniversary of Gilwell Park (l) and the logo of the activity centre between 2009 and 2016 (r). The axe and log logo was conceived by the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in the early 1920s to distinguish Gilwell Park from the Scout Headquarters. Gidney wanted to associate Gilwell Park with the outdoors and Scoutcraft rather than the business or administrative Headquarters offices. Scouters present at the original Wood Badge courses regularly saw axe blades masked for safety by being buried in a log. Seeing this, Gidney chose the axe and log as the totem of Gilwell Park. This logo came to be strongly associated with Wood Badge leader training and is still used on certificates, flags, and other programme-related items. The symbol of the axe in the log is associated with feudalism after the invasion and conquest of England by William the Conqueror. In that era, property, including forests, were owned by the landed barons and knights. Serfs, bound to the land in a form of modified slavery, were forbidden to cut wood from trees in the forest, and only permitted to gather downed wood. A freeman who carried an axe in a nobleman's forest demonstrated that he had earned the right by service. Symbolically, the grain of an axe handle must be \\"set square in the eye of the head.\\" The steel head must have the proper temper and be kept sharp. To be useful in the hands of a skilled freeman, an axe also needed to be well-balanced, otherwise the handle might break, endangering its user. The axe represented skilled laborers who had proven themselves through service. Lastly, the axe in the wood reminds those who have completed Wood Badge that they have committed themselves to be an example of service and fealty.  Wartime and later development  Lord Rowallan (centre) in Gilwell Park, 1950. The estate was requisitioned by the War Ministry from 1940 to 1945 as a local command, training, and ordnance centre. Little remains at the estate from World War II, except the hole created by a bomb dropped by the Luftwaffe. It was enlarged and is now used for swimming and canoeing. After the purchase of the original site in 1919, the purchase of Gilwellbury and adjoining land in 1945 is probably the next most important in Gilwell Park's Scouting history because it allowed The Scout Association to close the original road and fully utilize Branchet Field. It was originally used for small retreats and conferences but is now used as staff accommodation. The Ministry of Education assisted in the purchase. The Gilwell Farmhouse is believed to date from the early 18th century, making it the oldest original building at Gilwell Park. It is composed of two buildings that were joined together. There is a brick well head on the farm that is known as the Gil Well. A field adjoining the boundaries of Gilwell Park, known as Bill Oddie Field, affords dramatic views of the London skyline over Pole Hill, Chingford. The field was so-named after employees of The Scout Association spotted TV ornithologist Bill Oddie recording a programme about circling birds of prey on the field in 2006. After the war, the Boy Scout Association bought adjoining land to increase the estate and protect it from rapidly approaching new developments. These areas are called The Quick, New Field, and Hilly Field. An additional purchase and a donation from South Africa in the early 1950s brought the estate to its present size. This began an era of expanding camping facilities for Scouts which lasted until the early 1960s. Training and sleeping facilities were added through the early 1970s. The Boy Scout Association was renamed The Scout Association in 1967. During the 1970s, two key and popular facilities were built: the Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre for Cub Scouts and the Colquhoun International Centre for training Scouters, originally called The International Hall of Friendship. In the 1980s extensive remodelling of the White House was done. In April 2001, The Scout Association moved its program staff from London to Gilwell Park, where its training staff were already located. Extensive renovations were done to the White House and other buildings. With a budget of ¬£20,000,000 and individual contributions as high as ¬£500,000, improvements to programs and facilities have been ongoing since then in preparation for the 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007, which was the 100th anniversary of Scouting, hosted at nearby Hylands Park, Chelmsford, Essex with related activities also being held at Gilwell Park. Gilwell Park provides The Scout Association with over ¬£1,000,000 a year through conference fees, accommodation fees, and sales of materials.  Leader training  While different leader training courses are conducted at Gilwell Park, the most prominent is Wood Badge. Francis Gidney, the first Camp Chief, conducted the first Wood Badge course at Gilwell Park 8‚Äì19 September 1919. Gilwell Park became the home of leadership training in the Scout movement. Leaders from all over the world receive automatic membership in 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group (Gilwell Troop 1) on completion of the Wood Badge course. These leaders are henceforth called Wood Badgers or Gilwellians. Any location in which Wood Badgers meet is called Gilwell Field. The 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group meets every first weekend of September in Gilwell Park for the Gilwell Reunion. The Training Ground, near the White House, is the hallowed ground of Gilwell Park as this is the world home of Wood Badge, the premier Scout leader training course. A large oak tree, the Gilwell Oak, separates the Training Ground from the Orchard.  Camp Chiefs, and other staff  Captain Francis \\"Skipper\\" Gidney became the first Camp Chief in May 1919 and served until 1923. He organized the first Wood Badge training, and contributed to setting up Gilwell Park as the Scouters' training centre. The Gidney Cabin was built and named in his honour in 1929 to serve as a training centre. The second Camp Chief was John Skinner Wilson, who served from 1923 until 1939. Wilson was Colonel with the British Indian Police when he became a Scout Leader in 1917. In 1921 he traveled to Gilwell Park to take leader training, which led to his retirement from the Indian Police in 1922 to become a full-time Scout Leader. He was honoured with the Bronze Wolf Award in 1937, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. R.F. \\"John\\" Thurman was a British Scout Leader who served as Camp Chief from 1943 until 1969 and was awarded the Bronze Wolf Award in 1959. He was a strong promoter of Scout training and wrote books on the subject that were translated into other languages. The Thurman Memorial stands near The Pigsty. Thurman was succeeded by John Huskin as Director of leader training. Don Potter (1902‚Äì2004) was an English sculptor and wood carver who was a lifelong staff member at Gilwell Park, serving as a Gilwell Master Craftsman. Potter created wood carvings at Gilwell Park, including the Jim Green Gate, Gidney Cabin, the Leopard Gates, and totems he carved for the 1929 World Jamboree.  Scout Adventures Gilwell Park  Badge showing the logo for Scout Adventures Gilwell Park as used between 2016 and 2018. Since 2016, the activity centre at Gilwell Park is run and managed by Scout Adventures, following a re-branding of Scout Activity Centres nationwide. The centre offers a large range of outdoor and indoor adventure activities, as well as accommodation and camping, for Scout and Guide groups, schools and other youth organisations.  Activities  Activities provided by Scout Adventures at Gilwell Park include various high rope activities, rock climbing, 3G swing, archery, rifle shooting, kayaking and raft building. Each activity session lasts 90 minutes, with most activities having a participant limit of 12. These activities are primarily run by a team of international volunteers.  Camping Fields  Gilwell Park provides camping opportunities ranging from small groups, up to groups in excess of 2,500 people. This includes everything from unit-level camping to hosting international events. Essex Chase is a large, open field located off of Camp Square. It is a popular field, due to its proximity to Rikki's toilet block, the main campfire circles, Camp Square and Scout Adventures reception. Woodlands Field is a large field that will hold up to 200 campers at the north end of the park. Branchet Field is the largest campsite and will hold 1,200 campers. The field is flat and open, with Maclarens toilet block in the centre. The Northern end of the field also has electrical hookups for camper vans and caravans. Mallinson Field is a small, wooded, secluded area suited to small groups. The Paddock is a smaller camping field, directly connected to the Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre. The field houses Mallinson's toilet block, and holds 30 campers. Ferryman Field is a split-level field located to the North of the site, suitable for 'back to basics' camping due to its wooded nature and distance from facilities.  Accommodation  Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre = The Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre was built in 1970 by fitting interlocking logs together from a Norwegian, with no nails used to construct the original frame. Dorothy Hughes was a Cub Scout Leader from East London who wished to see a purpose-built facility for Cub Scout holidays. The Centre can sleep 40 people, primarily in dormitory-style rooms with smaller rooms provided for use by group leaders. There are both toilet and shower facilities within the building. The building is centrally heated and includes AV equipment and Wi-Fi. The building is centrally heated with a large main hall and kitchen. = Branchet Lodge = Branchet Lodge, named after field upon which it is sited, opened on 23 May 2003 to replace old portable cabins. Branchet Lodge is a single storey building that has central heating and sleeps up to 56 people in two separate wings with a common kitchen and main hall. Each wing has its own toilet and shower facilities. There are four single rooms for leaders, two accessible rooms that sleep two people each, and six rooms that sleep eight people each. It is constructed of stone, timber, copper, and a grass roof. The building is centrally heated, has laundry facilities, and includes AV equipment and Wi-Fi. = Jack Petchey Lodge = The Jack Petchey Lodge opened in September 2008, located next to the Branchet Lodge. There are five single rooms for leaders, ten rooms that sleep four people each and two accessible rooms that sleep two people each. All rooms are en-suite, with communal toilets also provided in the main hall. The building is centrally heated, and includes AV equipment, freeview and Wi- Fi. There is a large communal kitchen as well as laundry facilities. = Peter Harrison Lodge = The Peter Harrison Lodge was built in 2009 and is the newest accommodation building at Gilwell Park. It is very similar to the Jack Petchey Lodge, and located opposite the Branchet Lodge. The building sleeps 50 people. There are four leader rooms, ten rooms sleeping four people each, and two accessible rooms sleeping two people each. All rooms are en- suite, with communal toilets also provided in the main hall. The building is centrally heated, and includes AV equipment, freeview and Wi-Fi. There is a large communal kitchen as well as laundry facilities. = Patrol Cabins = Log cabins on the edge of Woodland Field sleep eight each in bunk beds. Cooking is provided in a separate shelter or an open fire can be utilized.  Special events  Each year Gilwell Park runs a number of regular special events. These have been established for more than 20 years with the addition of Gilwell 24 in 2004 and Scarefest in 2014 and are some of the largest annual Scout events in the UK. * Wintercamp ‚Äì taking place in early January and open to Scouts and Explorer Scouts (11‚Äì18). * Fundays ‚Äì open to the Beaver and Cub age ranges in June. * Gilwell 24 ‚Äì open to the Explorer Scout and Ranger Guide (14‚Äì18) age range in July. * Reunion ‚Äì open to all adult members in Scouting in early September. * Scarefest ‚Äì Open to Scouts, Explorers, Guides & Rangers. Held at the end of October  International Volunteers  Each year Scout Adventures recruits up to 120 volunteers from over 30 countries to assist in the running of its centres. Scout Adventures at Gilwell Park has between 20 ‚Äì 50 volunteers, depending on the season. These volunteers stay for a maximum placement of one year, and are provided with accommodation in return for their work. These volunteers are trained to run activity sessions for guests, carry out maintenance and improvement works on the site, and provide customer service. A new purpose-built accommodation building was opened in 2016 to house an increasing number of volunteers, following the degradation of previous accommodation in The Den and Gilwellbury. The International Volunteer Lodge cost ¬£1.2m to build, the funding for which came largely from the Jack Petchey Foundation, but also from several single private donors with a wider interest in Scouting. The building is predominantly timber framed with a large social space constructed using glulam beams and includes a two-storey sleeping area. This provides 26 double bedrooms and an accessible bedroom, all with en- suite facilities. The single storey social spaces include a drying and boot room, laundry room, open plan kitchen, dining and lounge area, quiet room and cinema style room. Visitors are allowed entry due to stipulations laid down by donor bequests.  Training and Event Centre  Gilwell Park can host indoor and outdoor conferences, training and special events for businesses and individuals. During the summer months, Gilwell Park is a popular wedding venue. The Training and Event Centre also operate the hotel at Gilwell Park, located within the White House. The Training and Event Centre primarily utilises the White House and Colquhoun International Centre (CIC), both of which have a variety of flexible spaces with AV equipment and other conference technologies. Weddings, parties and other functions are also held in The Swan Centre, a log-cabin style hall built in 1966 to replace an earlier building, and the Gidney Cabin built in 1929.  White House  The White House at Gilwell Park The White House and its predecessors represent over 500 years of Gilwell history. It became the headquarters of The Scout Association on 27 April 2001, although Baden-Powell House (the former headquarters) still facilitates some departments of The Scout Association. The White House today serves as a hotel and has a number of conference rooms on the ground floor, following extensive renovations in the 1990s. The hotel comprises 41 guest bedrooms (35 en-suite) across the White House and its modern extension. The White House also houses a bar in the Group Room, and a canteen-style restaurant.  Colquhoun International Centre  The Colquhoun International Centre (CIC) was built in 1971 as a Scout leader training centre, and was extensively renovated in 1995. The building has a main hall (The International Hall of Friendship) that can seat up to 250 people, 2 smaller training suites, and five seminar rooms. The main hall is regularly used for larger weddings, dinners and parties; with the seminar rooms and training suites used for conferences and meetings. The CIC also houses a second bar that is used during functions.  Attractions  A bust of Baden-Powell presented by the Scout Association of Mexico, located near the Buffalo Lawn at Gilwell Park. Gilwell Park has many attractions, primarily Scouting in nature, for visitors to see. This includes a souvenir shop, The Providore, the shape and stock of which have changed considerably over its decades of operation. The Gilwell Park museum closed in 2015 owing to its unsuitable conditions to house historical pieces.  Buildings of note  The White House is connected to The Barn (originally The Stables), a red-brick building built in 1926. The archway in the centre of the building was originally an open passageway. It now houses the reception area for the Training and Event Centre. The first floor of the building was used as training rooms for Cub Scout Leaders. The clock on the front of the building was a gift from a former Japanese Chief Scout, Count Sano, who was present at an early training course at Gilwell Park. The weather vane on the roof depicts Dick Turpin, who was rumoured to live on the site. Close to the estate entrance, The Lodge was built in 1934 as the Camp Chief's (later succeeded by the Director of Programme and Development) home. The building is now used to accommodate Scout Association staff and host internal meetings. The Gilwell Farm is the oldest building on the site still standing, dating from the 1600s. The building started as two separate cottages. In the grounds of the building is the last remaining well on site, known as Gil Well. The Farm was refurbished from its derelict site, opening in 2015 as the new offices and reception of Scout Adventures Gilwell Park . Close by, The Leopard Gates mark the original entrance to Gilwell Park, and were carved by Gilwlel master craftsman Don Potter in 1928. The Lid, which originally consisted of a roof but no walls, was a wet weather shelter built in 1967. In 2009, the building was renovated and now consists of a large activity hall, two classrooms, staff space and a large store room added The activity hall houses all the indoor activities on-site, including an archery range and climbing walls. In front of The Lid, is the Tait McKenzie Statue, gifted by the Boy Scouts of America in 1966. The Barnacle was built in 1950 as a First Aid centre, which quickly became a volunteer-run cottage hospital for visitors and the local community. It houses a six-bed ward, isolation room, dental surgery, X-ray room and operating theatre. In the late 1980s the building became volunteer accommodation, until it was decommissioned in 2016 with the opening of the International Volunteer Lodge. The building now stands empty, awaiting an uncertain future. The Pigsty, a small gardeners shed located on The Orchard, has been preserved as the first campsite at Gilwell Park. The first group of Rover Scouts who arrived to prepare the site when it was purchased in 1919 slept here when the weather proved too bad to pitch their tents.  Faith buildings  The site is home to five houses of worship for Scouts and other visitors, including a Buddhist sala, Jewish synagogue, and an Islamic mosque. The Buddhist Sala was donated to Gilwell Park in 1967 by the Boy Scouts of Thailand. The Buddha found inside was a gift from the Thai government and is over 1000 years old. Thai ambassadors to the United Kingdom often visit the sala, as it is their responsibility to care for it. The White House, originally dating back to 1750, is timber framed and was extended in 1830 and again in the 1960s. The exterior is covered in hung slates, which caused extensive damage to the original frame which required extensive repairs in 1994. The 1797 chimneys are pointed in shape, to stop birds nesting and draw smoke up from the fire. The lawn in front of the building was the house's original turning circle, with the road once being a thoroughfare from Chingford to Waltham Abbey.  Camp Square  Camp Square has had a variety of buildings with many uses over the years, including a Warden's Office (recently demolished), museum (currently empty), archery range (former Scout Shop ‚Äì no longer in use), volunteer accommodation (demolished in 2017), shop, soft drinks bar, staff space and toilet block. In the centre of the Square is the clock tower, known as Big Mac. It was named after Camp Warden Alfred Macintosh. Behind Camp Square, The Bomb Hole was created when a bomb was dropped on the site during World War II, creating a small crater. The Bomb Hole has been extended several times, and is now used for kayaking, raft building and pond dipping activity sessions.  Other attractions  The Small Campfire Circle at Gilwell Park. There are two Campfire Circles which are used extensively during the peak camping season. The Large Campfire Circle has a Maori Gatewat which was presented by the Scouts New Zealand in 1951. The Lime Walk, constructed by previous estate owner Margaret Chinnery, surrounds the Training Ground which was the original main lawn area of the White House. Few of the Lime trees survive to this day. On this path sits the Jim Green Gate, a 1930 tribute to Jim Green, an editor of The Scouter magazine. The Buffalo Lawn is so called because of the replica of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Silver Buffalo Award that was presented by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926. This was to honour the Unknown Scout that helped William D. Boyce bring Scouting to the United States. Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to all the World Scout Jamborees from Gilwell Park. Surrounding the Buffalo Lawn is part of the original balustrade of London Bridge which was re-built in 1820. The sections were moved to Gilwell Park after being purchased at auction in 1826. Considered by many to be the most important Scouting site, The Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was historically held and where the Gilwell oak tree is located. Contrary to popular belief, the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On the Training Ground sits the Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is the Thurman Memorial, in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman. The caravan trailer, presented to Chief Scout Sir Robert Baden-Powell, along with a new Rolls-Royce car, during the 3rd World Scout Jamboree in 1929 is on display during the summer months. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by Olave Baden-Powell in 1945. Gilwell Park also has a number of other smaller memorials, statues, and places and objects of historical or Scouting importance.

The province was divided into Palaestina Prima and Palaestina Secunda in about 390.  Background  Syria was an early Roman province, annexed to the Roman Republic in 64 BC by Pompey in the Third Mithridatic War, following the defeat of Armenian King Tigranes the Great. Following the partition of the Herodian kingdom into tetrarchies in 6 AD, it was gradually absorbed into Roman provinces, with Roman Syria annexing Iturea and Trachonitis. The Roman province of Judea incorporated the regions of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea, and extended over parts of the former regions of the Hasmonean and Herodian kingdoms of Israel. It was named after Herod Archelaus's Tetrarchy of Judea, but the Roman province encompassed a much larger territory. The capital of Roman Syria was established in Antioch from the very beginning of Roman rule, while the capital of the Judaea province was shifted to Caesarea Maritima, which, according to historian H. H. Ben-Sasson, had been the \\"administrative capital\\" of the region beginning in 6 AD.A History of the Jewish People, H. H. Ben-Sasson editor, 1976, page 247: \\"When Judea was converted into a Roman province [in 6 AD, page 246], Jerusalem ceased to be the administrative capital of the country. The Romans moved the governmental residence and military headquarters to Caesarea. The centre of government was thus removed from Jerusalem, and the administration became increasingly based on inhabitants of the hellenistic cities (Sebaste, Caesarea and others).\\" Judea province was the scene of unrest at its founding in 6 AD during the Census of Quirinius and several wars were fought in its history, known as the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars. The Temple was destroyed in 70 AD as part of the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War resulting in the institution of the Fiscus Judaicus. The Provinces of Judaea and Syria were key scenes of an increasing conflict between Judaean and Hellenistic population, which exploded into full scale Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars, beginning with the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War of 66‚Äì70. Disturbances followed throughout the region during the Kitos War in 117‚Äì118. Between 132‚Äì135, Simon bar Kokhba led a revolt against the Roman Empire, controlling parts of Judea, for three years. As a result, Hadrian sent Sextus Julius Severus to the region, who brutally crushed the revolt. Shortly before or after the Bar Kokhba's revolt (132‚Äì135), the Roman Emperor Hadrian changed the name of the Judea province to Syria Palaestina, and founded Aelia Capitolina on the ruins of Jerusalem, which some scholars conclude was done in an attempt to remove the relationship of the Jewish people to the region.H.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, , page 334: \\"In an effort to wipe out all memory of the bond between the Jews and the land, Hadrian changed the name of the province from Iudaea to Syria- Palestina, a name that became common in non-Jewish literature.\\"Ariel Lewin. The archaeology of Ancient Judea and Palestine. Getty Publications, 2005 p. 33. \\"It seems clear that by choosing a seemingly neutral name - one juxtaposing that of a neighboring province with the revived name of an ancient geographical entity (Palestine), already known from the writings of Herodotus - Hadrian was intending to suppress any connection between the Jewish people and that land.\\" Ronald Syme suggested the name change preceded the revolt; he writes \\"Hadrian was in those parts in 129 and 130. He abolished the name of Jerusalem, refounding the place as a colony, Aelia Capitolina. That helped to provoke the rebellion. The supersession of the ethnical term by the geographical may also reflect Hadrian's decided opinions about Jews.\\" (page 90) Hadrian's connection to the name change and the reason behind it is disputed.: \\"While it is true that there is no evidence as to precisely who changed the name of Judaea to Palestine and precisely when this was done, circumstantial evidence would seem to point to Hadrian himself, since he is, it would seem, responsible for a number of decrees that sought to crush the national and religious spirit of thejews, whether these decrees were responsible for the uprising or were the result of it. In the first place, he refounded Jerusalem as a Graeco-Roman city under the name of Aelia Capitolina. He also erected on the site of the Temple another temple to Zeus.\\"  History  Palaestina in modern times (ca 1926 or possibly earlier). Judea (2018).  Consolidation  After crushing the Bar Kokhba revolt, the Roman Emperor Hadrian applied the name Syria Palaestina, meaning \\"Palestinian Syria\\", to Judea province. Some allege that Hadrian wanted to choose a name that revived the ancient name of Palestine and combine it with that of the neighboring province of Syria in an attempt to suppress Jewish connection to the land, but this is not supported by the historical record. Besides a lack of any primary source evidence to indicate Hadrian's alleged ulterior motives for a routine Roman practice of consolidating, re-organizing, and re-naming provinces, the timeline shows the roots of the name Syria Palaestina in the region in fact predate those of Judea. The name Judea had been derived from the Kingdom of Judah which had arisen in the region in the 9th century BC, in the 8th century becoming a vassal of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911‚Äì609 BC). The name Philistia (Palestine) was derived from the Philistines, a people who had arisen in the land between the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age in the 12th century BC. Both the Judeans and Philistines were conquered and exiled by Nebuchadnezzar II between 604 and 586 BC upon the rise of the Neo-Babylonian Empire (626‚Äì539 BC).DNA Begins to Unlock Secrets of the Ancient Philistines Furthermore, the name Syria Palaestina predates Hadrian's naming decision by at least 6 centuries, the term already long in use in Classical Greek historical literature to refer to Palestine as part of a broader Syrian region encompassing the Levant from Cappadocia and Cilicia in the north down through Phoenicia and Palestina, bordering Egypt to the south. Herodotus, writing The Histories in the Ionic dialect of Ancient Greek in 440 BC, repeatedly refers to Syria Palaestina () as a combined name single phrase.s:History of Herodotus/Book 3 , s:History of Herodotus/Book 4 The city of Aelia Capitolina was built by the emperor Hadrian on the ruins of Jerusalem. The capital of the province of Syria proper remained in Antiochia.  Conflict with Sassanids and emergence of the Palmyrene Empire  Beginning in 212, Palmyra's trade diminished as the Sassanids occupied the mouth of the Tigris and the Euphrates. In 232, the Syrian Legion rebelled against the Roman Empire, but the uprising went unsuccessful. Septimius Odaenathus, a Prince of the Aramean state of Palmyra, was appointed by Valerian as the governor of the province of Syria Palaestina. After Valerian was captured by the Sassanids in 260, and died in captivity in Bishapur, Odaenathus campaigned as far as Ctesiphon (near modern-day Baghdad) for revenge, invading the city twice. When Odaenathus was assassinated by his nephew Maconius, his wife Septimia Zenobia took power, ruling Palmyra on behalf of her son, Vabalathus. Queen Zenobia, at Palmyra. Zenobia rebelled against Roman authority with the help of Cassius Longinus and took over Bosra and lands as far to the west as Egypt, establishing the short-lived Palmyrene Empire. Next, she took Antioch and large sections of Asia Minor to the north. In 272, the Roman Emperor Aurelian finally restored Roman control and Palmyra was besieged and sacked, never to recover her former glory. Aurelian captured Zenobia, bringing her back to Rome. He paraded her in golden chains in the presence of the senator Marcellus Petrus Nutenus, but allowed her to retire to a villa in Tibur, where she took an active part in society for years. A legionary fortress was established in Palmyra and although no longer an important trade center, it nevertheless remained an important junction of Roman roads in the Syrian desert.Isaac (2000), p. 165 Diocletian built the Camp of Diocletian in the city of Palmyra to harbor even more legions and walled it in to try and save it from the Sassanid threat. The Byzantine period following the Roman Empire only resulted in the building of a few churches; much of the city went to ruin.  Reorganization  In circa 390, Syria Palaestina was reorganised into several administrative units: Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda, and Palaestina Tertia (in the 6th century), Syria Prima and Phoenice and Phoenice Lebanensis. All were included within the larger Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Diocese of the East, together with the provinces of Isauria, Cilicia, Cyprus (until 536), Euphratensis, Mesopotamia, Osroene, and Arabia Petraea. Palaestina Prima consisted of Judea, Samaria, the Paralia, and Peraea, with the governor residing in Caesarea. Palaestina Secunda consisted of the Galilee, the lower Jezreel Valley, the regions east of Galilee, and the western part of the former Decapolis, with the seat of government at Scythopolis. Palaestina Tertia included the Negev, southern Transjordan part of Arabia, and most of Sinai, with Petra as the usual residence of the governor. Palestina Tertia was also known as Palaestina Salutaris.  Religion = Roman cult  After the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars (66‚Äì135), which Epiphanius believed the Cenacle survived,Catholic Encyclopedia: Jerusalem (A.D. 71-1099): \\"Epiphanius (died 403) says...\\" the significance of Jerusalem to Christians entered a period of decline, Jerusalem having been temporarily converted to the pagan Aelia Capitolina, but interest resumed again with the pilgrimage of Helena (the mother of Constantine the Great) to the Holy Land c. 326‚Äì28. New pagan cities were founded in Judea at Eleutheropolis (Bayt Jibrin), Diopolis (Lydd), and Nicopolis (Emmaus).Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2007). Palestine. In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, 2007.

Second Temple in Judaism  Second Temple Judaism is Judaism between the construction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, c. 515 BC, and its destruction by the Romans in 70 AD. The development of the Hebrew Bible canon, the synagogue, Jewish apocalyptic expectations for the future, and Christianity, can all be traced to the Second Temple period. Following the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars, many Jews left the country altogether for the Diaspora communities, and large numbers of prisoners of war were sold as slaves throughout the Empire. This changed the perception of Jerusalem as the center of faith and autonomous Jewish communities shifted from centralized religious authority into more dispersed one.  Early Christianity  The Romans destroyed the Jewish community of the Church in Jerusalem, which had existed since the time of Jesus.Whealey, J. (2008) \\"Eusebius and the Jewish Authors: His Citation Technique in an Apologetic Context\\" (Journal of Theological Studies; Vol 59: 359-362) Traditionally it is believed the Jerusalem Christians waited out the Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars in Pella in the Decapolis. The line of Jewish bishops in Jerusalem, which is claimed to have started with Jesus's brother James the Righteous as its first bishop, ceased to exist, within the Empire. Hans Kung in \\"Islam: Past Present and Future\\", suggests that the Jewish Christians sought refuge in Arabia and he quotes with approval Clemen et al.: > \\"This produces the paradox of truly historic significance that while Jewish > Christianity was swallowed up in the Christian church, it preserved itself > in Islam.\\"C. Clemen, T. Andrae and H.H. Schraeder, p. 342 Christianity was practiced in secret and the Hellenization of Palaestina continued under Septimius Severus (193‚Äì211 AD).Shahin, Mariam (2005) Palestine: a Guide. Interlink Books , p. 7  Demographics  In Southern Levant, until about 200 AD, and despite the genocide of Jewish‚ÄìRoman wars, Jews had formed a majority of the population with Samaritans and G Pagans forming the rest of the population. By the beginning of the Byzantine period (disestablishment of Syria-Palaestina), the Jews had become a minority and were living alongside Samaritans, pagan Greco-Syriacs and a large Syriac Christian community.

It is located along the valley of the River Kander, west of the Jungfrau massif. It is noted for its spectacular mountain scenery and sylvan alpine landscapes. Tourism is a very significant part of its economic life today. It offers outdoor activities year-round, with hiking trails and mountain climbing as well as downhill and cross-country skiing. History View of Kandersteg, Memorial in Kandersteg to workers killed during construction of the L√∂tschberg Tunnel Photochrome postcard showing Hotel Victoria and Kandersteg Kandersteg is first mentioned, together with Kandergrund, in 1352 as der Kandergrund. Prehistorically the area was lightly settled. However, several late-neolithic or early Bronze Age bows have been found on the L√∂tschberg glaciers and a Bronze Age needle was found in the Golitschenalp. From the Roman era a bridge and part of a road were discovered in the village. Until 1909 Kandersteg was politically and religiously part of Kandergrund. In 1511 the parish built a chapel in Kandersteg, which survived the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation in 1530. It became a filial church of the parish in Kandergrund between 1840 and 1860 and in 1910 became the parish church of the Kandersteg parish. A Roman Catholic church was built in 1927. Traditionally the local economy relied on seasonal alpine herding and farming and supporting trade over the alpine passes. In the 17th and 18th centuries sulfur mining began in the Oeschinenalp. A match factory opened in the village in the 19th century to take advantage of the sulfur. Beginning around 1850, the municipality grew into a tourist destination. Between 1855 and 1890 five hotels opened and by 1913 there were 19 hotels. The population grew dramatically during construction of the L√∂tschberg Tunnel and the L√∂tschberg railway line between 1906 and 1913. The new railroad line and tunnel allowed ever increasing numbers of tourists to visit Kandersteg. A chair lift to Oeschinen Lake opened in 1948, followed by a cable car to the valley floor in 1951. A ski jump was built in 1979. The Kandersteg International Scout Centre opened in 1923.

The Bunderchrinde Pass () connects Kandersteg to Adelboden, whilst the Hoht√ºrli Pass () on the east connects Kandersteg to Griesalp in the Kiental valley. Neither pass carries a road, but both form part of the Alpine Pass Route, a long-distance hiking trail across Switzerland between Sargans and Montreux that passes through the village. The largest lake in the valley is lake Oeschinen. It is located at east of Kandersteg, at the foot of the Bl√ºemlisalp massif. The Gastern Valley is an almost closed off valley.

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, he first appeared in The X-Men #4 (March 1964). He is most often depicted as an enemy of the X-Men, and was originally a weak, hunchbacked mutant, with a superhuman leaping ability. He was Magneto's sniveling servant in the 1960s line-up of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. He eventually led his own version of the Brotherhood, which was more involved in petty crime than mutant liberation. Since his inception, the character has appeared in numerous media adaptations, such as television series, films and video games. For example, Ray Park played a significantly different version of Toad in 2000's X-Men film, and after that, aspects of this Toad have since been implemented into the comic book version. Subsequently, most versions of Toad written or drawn after 2000 resemble the Ray Park version more closely than the original Toad. A younger Toad appeared in the film X-Men: Days of Future Past, played by Evan Jonigkeit. Publication history Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, he first appeared in X-Men #4 (March 1964). Fictional character biography=Lackey Toad was often berated and verbally abused by Magneto. Mortimer Toynbee was born in York, England, and was quickly abandoned by his parents and spent many years in an orphanage, where he was constantly tormented by other children due to his ugliness and strangely shaped body (as his mutant appearance was present from birth). He was considered to be mentally inferior due to his extreme shyness and mild learning disabilities during his primary school years, though he was actually quite intelligent. He dropped out at an extremely early age and decided to fend for himself. Based on years of abuse and knowing full well he was a freak, Mortimer developed a severe inferiority complex, becoming servile to anyone that showed him the slightest bit of affection. Later, he was recruited into Magneto's original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, becoming Magneto's sycophantic 'toady'. Toad believed that Magneto loved him, while the mutant mastermind considered this henchman little more than a human shield. He also developed a crush on his teammate Scarlet Witch, but she did not return his feelings as she was repulsed by his appearance, mannerisms, and lack of hygiene.X-Men #4-7. Marvel Comics. Toad abandoning Magneto. As a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Toad aided Magneto in repeated clashes with the X-Men.

X-Men: Forever Years later, still struggling with depression, Toad was captured by Prosh, along with Juggernaut, Iceman, Jean Grey and Mystique as part of a time-hopping plan to stop a global threat. Toad learned that his deformed body was the result of experimentation by Juggernaut's father, Kurt Marko, at Alamogordo, New Mexico, which left Toad with an unstable genetic structure. The Stranger's equipment corrected his genetic flaws, resulting in an almost complete metamorphosis: Toad had a taller and slimmer appearance and had his powers augmented. Among the most notable changes was a prehensile tongue. Though his change improved his self- esteem, Toad continued to live life without direction. He joined several more incarnations of the Brotherhood of Mutants, none of which lasted for long.X-Men: Forever #1-6 (2001). Marvel Comics. Bloodsport tournament Not long after, Toad entered the Madripoor Bloodsport Tournament. In his first fight in the tournament, Toad wrapped his extremely long tongue around the villain known as Eel, crushing his opponent's bones and seemingly killing him instantly. In the next fight, however, Toad battled Wolverine. His new abilities caught the X-Man off guard and he managed to deal some damage. However, his overconfidence led to his defeat. Wolverine spared his life, not wanting to partake in the act of cold-blooded murder.Wolverine Vol. 2 #167-168. Marvel Comics. New X-Men Toad made a brief reappearance on Genosha some time after the island's annihilation, leading a team including Paralyzer and Unus to try to rebuild the statue of Magneto as a monument to him.New X-Men #132. Marvel Comics. For reasons unknown, Toad eventually returns to Magneto's side during the Planet X storyline; however, Toad was not as docile and subservient as he had been in the past, even openly questioning Magneto at times. Magneto, in turn, is tyrannical in his treatment of Toad, who had become his second-in-command. At that point, the long-presumed-dead Magneto's image had taken a Che Guevara-like notoriety, and Toad questions if Magneto may have been more powerful dead than alive. Nonetheless, Toad tries to defend his former master, only to be incapacitated by Fantomex, who shoots his kneecaps out. Shortly thereafter, Magneto is killed by Wolverine and Toad vanishes from the scene.New X-Men #150. Marvel Comics. It is later revealed that this was not the real Magneto, but a copycat named Xorn. It is unknown if Toad was aware of this. Either way, the real Magneto turns out to be alive after all. So far, Toad has made no known attempts to rejoin him. Unus' gang has come into conflict with Xavier and his allies, who have gained a foothold on Genosha soil. Civil War Toad was among the group of mutants who broke out of the 198 camp, with help from Caliban, Domino, and Shatterstar. The group hid in what they believed was an abandoned nuclear bunker in the Nevada desert. While the X-Men and O*N*E battled outside the bunker, Johnny Dee was instructed by General Lazer to cause chaos amongst the 198. The group of mutants discovered this as Outlaw, being controlled by Johnny, pointed her gun at Domino. Domino's powers caused a misfire, giving Toad a chance to bring Outlaw down. It was then revealed that the bunker was actually a blast- containment chamber for experimental weapons. As the auto-destruct sequence was initiated, Toad was trapped inside the chamber with the rest of the 198. The X-Men, teaming up with Bishop, Iron Man, and Ms. Marvel, quickly found a way to rescue the trapped mutants and the 198 walked away unharmed. Dark Reign Toad is later seen rioting in San Francisco, angry about the fact that mutants have been forbidden to mate with each other to prevent new mutant births. Toad is faced by Cyclops and is defeated.Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1 He is later seen being carried by Trance and Dragoness, who are being pursued by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents.X-Men: Legacy #226. Marvel Comics. After the battle is over, Toad is seen together with Dragoness and Avalanche living on the X-Men's new Utopia homebase.X-Men: Legacy Annual #1 (2009). Marvel Comics. Second Coming After Cyclops deputizes the population of Utopia to help fight an invasion of Nimrod Sentinels from an unknown future, Toad advises a group of mutants including Sack to remain behind on the island, where they could remain safe. In the middle of arguing with Sack, a Nimrod Sentinel fires on them, decapitating Sack and blowing off Toad's right index finger.New Mutants #14 (2010). Marvel Comics. Regenesis After the fight between Cyclops and Wolverine, the X-Men were divided between Utopia and Westchester. Toad decided to go to Westchester with Wolverine who accepts him as the school's janitor.X-Men: Regenesis #1 (2011). Marvel Comics. In the miniseries \\"Magneto: Not a Hero\\", Joseph is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with Astra and mutated deformed versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad. It is soon revealed that the mutated versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad are clones created by Joseph.Magneto: Not a Hero #1-4. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Secret Empire\\" storyline, Toad became a member of New Tian's strike force following Hydra taking over the United States. He gained a secondary mutation where he can light his tongue on fire.X-Men: Blue #7. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Hunted\\" storyline, Toad was among the animal-themed superhumans captured by Taskmaster and Black Ant for Kraven the Hunter's Great Hunt sponsored by Arcade's company Arcade Industries.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #17. Marvel Comics. After most of the animal-themed superheroes regrouped, Toad mentioned that that Man-Bull was killed amidst the chaos caused by the Hunter-Bots.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #19. Marvel Comics. Toad later assisted the animal-themed characters in fighting the Hunter-Bots.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #20. Marvel Comics. When Yellowjacket finds Black Ant hiding in the bush, Toad joins Yellowjacket, Human Fly, Razorback, and White Rabbit in preparing to take revenge on him only for Taskmaster to appear and make off with Black Ant.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #23. Marvel Comics. Relationship with Husk During the events of \\"Avengers vs. X-Men,\\" Toad and Husk have developed a sentimental relationship.Wolverine & The X-Men #9-15. Marvel Comics. The relationship led to him quitting the Grey Academy to join her at the Hellfire Academy where she had become a teacher, but he soon finds he is relegated once again to being a janitor and sees Husk being twisted and corrupted by the Academy, quickly regretting that he joined.Wolverine and the X-Men #30-32. Marvel Comics. In the Hellfire Academy, he found himself disillusioned with their attempts to teach the children how to be villains, feeling they should actually try educating them and tell them how unfortunate the life of a villain could be, which ended up with Husk shoving him out of the room and claiming he had embarrassed her. When he witnessed Quentin Quire - whom he had brought to the Hellfire Academy along with him - being tortured by Sauron, he finally took action and turned on the Hellfire Academy choosing to help Quentin escape. As they were escaping, they are attacked by Husk and the All-New Hellions. Husk's increasingly slipping sanity causes her to attempt to kill Toad during the fight. Despite his reluctance to hurt her, Toad begins to rip off layers of her flesh until she is left in her human form, confused about where she is and why she is not still in the Grey Academy, having apparently lost most of her memory. The Hellfire Academy is defeated, Kade Kilgore is trapped inside the Siege Perilous, Wilhemina Kensington manages to escape, but Manuel Enduque and Maximilian Frankenstein are forced to enroll in the Jean Grey Academy. Toad is seen sitting beside Husk's hospital bed. Later, it transpires Husk's unhinged personality was caused by a secondary mutation that caused her powers to affect her mind along with her body. Due to his earlier betrayal, Toad is fired by Wolverine as janitor of the Grey Academy. As he leaves the school, Husk arrives to apologize to him. Toad accepts her apology and tells her he always knew things between them were too good to last. Before he can go, Husk asks him to visit her in a nearby coffee shop so she can try to get to know him and remember what she liked about him before she lost her memory. But Frankenstein creates self-replicating energy robots to attack the city and distract the staff so he and Enduque can escape the Grey Academy. Toad tracks them down and tells them how he was given a second chance and intends to take it. Frankenstein tells him to show him to prove his commitment, Toad does this by attacking and hospitalizing Enduque. Husk sits alone in the destroyed coffee shop and Toad never shows up, later she gives Enduque counselling and finds Toad left her a message saying he had to leave or else someday she would wake up and see him for what he really was. Toad is seen crying silently as he now works for Maximilian Frankenstein and recommends they go someplace nobody can hurt them. Powers and abilities The Toad's intellect and physical abilities have gone through some changes over the years. In the character's inception, he possessed superhuman leg strength and endurance, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, a superhuman ability to leap great distances. However, over the years, the Toad's original powers have increased and he has gained additional powers through further mutation, including adhesive saliva and an elongated prehensile tongue.. As a result of further mutation, he now has mottled green skin and pointed-tip ears. Toad's primary mutant ability is a superhuman leaping ability that allows him to leap many times higher and farther than an ordinary human. He possesses some degree of superhuman strength and endurance, primarily concentrated in his lower torso and legs, which grants him his superior leaping abilities. His vertebral column and skeletal structure are unusually flexible, enabling him to remain in a constant crouching position and contort his body into unusual position without injury or strain. In his first appearances, Toad had very little knowledge of hand-to-hand combat, fighting mainly by kicking wildly and by leaping about and attempting to land on his opponents (as Toad once weighed over 250 lbs this could be potentially harmful). Recently, he has demonstrated a better sense of combat and a leaner physique, using both his leaping ability and his elongated prehensile tongue to his advantage. As a result of having his genetic structure restored (thus stabilizing and augmenting his mutation) Toad has the ability to extend his elastic tongue up to 25 feet in length to ensnare objects and people. His tongue is superhumanly strong and tough to the extent that he once killed a magistrate of Genosha by ensnaring him within his tongue and squeezing, causing the magistrate to be crushed to death almost immediately. He can also secrete odorless pheremonous venom and psychoactive chemicals from his tongue and fingertips that allow him to influence, manipulate, and control the minds of others to a limited extent. Thanks to special pads on his hands and feet, Toad can stick to and climb most surfaces with ease, even if they are vertical, inverted, or slick. He can also secrete a highly adhesive resin from his pores that paralyzes the nervous system of anybody that touches it. Toad has also demonstrated the ability to psionically communicate with amphibian life (which he often uses as spies), and to expel powerful gusts of wind from his lungs capable of knocking someone down. Toad's intellect has increased beyond his original levels and he has considerable knowledge of advanced technology and access to vast technological and scientific knowledge, which he gained as a lackey to Magneto and while he was held captive by the Stranger, as well as his studies of machinery in the possession of Arcade and Arkon. He once possessed alien technology that he stole from the Stranger's world, and could utilize it to create synthezoid robots, among other uses. He has demonstrated the ability to apply this advanced technology, but lacks the creativity to make progress beyond his existing knowledge. For example, while he could construct and utilize a powerful exoskeletal armor, he would be unable to improve on its base design. Although Toad's amphibian-like traits extend to his physical appearance, this was revealed to be contingent upon his mutation during the events in which the High Evolutionary deprived the world's mutant population of their extraordinary abilities. Following the events, Toad was revealed to be an extremely handsome young man. This is as he would look had he not been born a mutant.The Uncanny X-Men #379, 2000 Toad later gained a secondary mutation where he can light his tongue on fire. Other versions=1602 Toad appears in the Marvel 1602 series working as a spy for Enrique (Magneto) in the Vatican. As Enrique's plot was to recruit the \\"witchbreed\\" who could conceal their abilities in the unfriendly world, it is unclear why Toad was included, as he is shown with a long tongue constantly coming out of his mouth. He also has the ability to move around on walls and ceilings. When his deception is discovered by the Papacy, he betrays Enrique and his allies in exchange for his life. However, when Enrique's group breaks free, they capture Toad.Marvel 1602 #7. Marvel Comics. Enrique promises to kill him, but his death is at least delayed, as he is seen alive on the ship later, though he doesn't appear in the climax.Marvel 1602 #8 Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse, Toad was a member of Forge's resistance group, the Outcasts. This version of Toad was a highly articulate Shakespearean actor, and a master swordsman. When the Outcasts were attacked by Domino, Toad killed her henchman Caliban but dies immediately afterward at the hands of Grizzly.X-Man #3. Marvel Comics. Marvel Noir Toad (Mortimer Toynbee) is a mutant partner of homicide detective Fred Dukes in X-Men Noir.X-Men: Noir #1. Marvel Comics. House of M When a mentally unstable Scarlet Witch warped reality into the mutant-dominant House of M, Toad appeared as a member of Wolverine's Red Guard, and wrote a best-selling book about his time in Magneto's service. When his real memories were restored, he agreed to help the heroes in changing the reality back to normal.House of M #5. Marvel Comics. Marvel Zombies Toad is seen as a zombie, along with several other members of the zombie Freedom Force chasing after the still living Blob. They succeed, as he is seen as a zombie in Dead Days. Powerless In the limited series Powerless where the characters of the Marvel Universe are ordinary humans, Toad, referred to simply as Mortimer or Mort, appears as member of the shadowy organization headed by Erik Lensherr. He briefly aids Victor Creed as they search for Weapon X, but they are attacked by their target and their car runs off the road. Mortimer's fate is unseen but Creed assumes Weapon X kills him. He does not appear again.Powerless #5. Marvel Comics. Ronin In the limited series X-Men Ronin, Toad is an elderly teacher that several of the X-Men turn to for help when the entire Prefecture are made to believe they are monsters. Toad works to help heal Wolverine, who had been laid low by a telepathic blast. Earth X In the Earth X reality, Toad gains Magneto's powers and rules over Sentinel City, humiliating Magneto as payback.Universe X #3. Marvel Comics. Ultimate Marvel Cyclops' arm, while Cyclops is choking Blob. In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Toad was a founding member of the Brotherhood of Mutants. In this version, he is not the sycophantic Toad from the mainstream universe, but rather is ruthless and vicious. This Toad is also British like the mainstream version but has four fingers, green skin and can walk on walls and ceilings like Spider-Man. He became good friends with Ultimate Cyclops, when they were in the Brotherhood together. This friendship carried on even after Cyclops returned to the X-Men.Ultimate X-Men #15. Marvel Comics. After the supposed death of Professor Xavier and the consequent passing of control of the school to Cyclops and Jean Grey, Toad works as an instructor at the school, something with which Jean feels mildly uncomfortable. Cyclops asks Toad to visit the Morlocks and tell them of the new school regime that he is trying to create. Sunder, the Morlock leader had taken in Nightcrawler and believes the two to be working against him. Toad and Nightcrawler are then taken captive and then freed by Cyclops, Jean, Rogue, and Iceman.Ultimate X-Men #82. Marvel Comics. After the Apocalypse debacle, Professor X returns to the institute. The world outside has returned to how it was before Apocalypse appeared, but the mansion has both Cyclops' group who remained behind and Bishop's team of New X-Men together as a much larger team. Toad officially joins the team and, like Iceman, wears a bandana with the \\"X\\" symbol on it.Ultimate X-Men #93. Marvel Comics. Toad is then rarely seen in the Ultimate X-Men comic following this and is not even shown during the \\"Banshee Drug\\" storyline where Colossus makes an X-Men team of drug-enhanced X-Men to fight Xavier's X-Men. He is a part of Xavier's X-Men during the storyline, but is not shown. The Ultimatum Wave then hits New York, prompting William Stryker to attack the X-Men mansion with his soldiers. Toad is killed defending Firestar in the resulting massacre. Ultimate Toad's personality and appearance is more snarky British punk than subservient yes-man, and he has been shown as a relatively competent fighter in his few appearances. In the first story arc (\\"The Tomorrow People\\"), Toad successfully disables both Cyclops and Storm by leaping on them, but is defeated by Iceman, who freezes his legs. Storm then strikes him with a kick across the face.Ultimate X-Men #3. Marvel Comics. Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows On Earth-18119 as seen in the pages of Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows, Toad is seen as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants.Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows Vol. 2 #6. Marvel Comics. In other media=Television * Toad made a cameo in Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends on a TV monitor, when Magneto is demanding for The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to be freed from prison in the episode \\"The Prison Plot\\". Magneto describes him as \\"obedient and super- agile\\". * Toad appears in the pilot episode X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men, voiced by Frank Welker. He is an eager-to-please sycophant barely tolerated by Magneto, who at one point tells him to \\"go play in an airlock\\". * Toad appeared in the X-Men animated series episodes Secrets, No Longer Buried and Graduation Day. In his first appearance, Toad is part of the Children of the Shadow, a mutant-supremacist group led by Bill Braddock, a.k.a. Solarr. * The Toad who appears in the X-Men: Evolution animated series (voiced by Noel Fisher) is an American teen named Todd Tolansky instead of Mortimer Toynbee. In the series he speaks with a heavy Brooklyn accent and is a member of the Brotherhood and a former classmate of the X-Men. He has a crush on Magneto's daughter, Wanda, a.k.a. the Scarlet Witch and shares a rivalry with Nightcrawler. Although mostly depicted as a misguided youth and delinquent, he aids his Brotherhood teammates and the X-Men in defeating Apocalypse in the series finale. * Toad first appeared in the Wolverine and the X-Men episode \\"Hindsight\\" Pt. 2, voiced by A. J. Buckley. He is seen sporting dreadlocks, and a bandana. Toad is a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants and was shown captured by the Mutant Response Division until Blob rescued him. Toad was mentioned to have been captured by the MRD many times, so many times in fact, that in the episode \\"Time Bomb\\" Quicksilver contemplated leaving him behind to just be rid of the nuisance of having to save him before he told him about Nitro. He is an inexperienced fighter as shown is the episode \\"Battle Lines,\\" after knocking Cyclops' glasses off, he stands in front of him to taunt him and ends up getting zapped. He even at one point refused to fight the X-Men in the episode \\"Time Bomb\\" believing it would be better if he did not get involved. * A. J. Buckley reprises his role of Toad in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"Hulk Talk Smack.\\" There is also a reference to Storm's movie line when Thor blasts Toad into the water knocking him out as Silver Surfer replies \\"Oh, so that is what happens to a toad when it is struck by lightning. What a let-down.\\" Film Ray Park as Toad in X-Men. * Toad appeared as a character in the 2000 movie X-Men, played by Ray Park. He is a member of Magneto's Brotherhood and possesses enhanced leaping capability and acrobatic speed, agility, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, balance, a sticky prehensile tongue, and the ability to spit a mucus that hardens almost instantly. He has a different personality from the comic incarnation, confident and comical. Toad also appears to have some scientific ingenuity, as he was seen working on Magneto's machine that can induce mutations in normal humans. Toad battles Storm, Cyclops, and Jean Grey all at once in the battle in the Statue of Liberty, he starts by locking Cyclops in a display case, sends Storm to the second floor and spits slime on Jean Grey as she stops him in mid-air. Storm returns to stop Toad from harming Jean but is knocked down an elevator shaft, however Storm flies up again and blows Toad out of the statue. Toad manages to latch his tongue onto a support beam, but Storm strikes his tongue with a lightning bolt and the shock causes him to fall into the Hudson River. * Evan Jonigkeit portrayed a younger Toad in the 2014 film X-Men: Days of Future Past. He possesses his long tongue and has mottled skin. In the interview in which he revealed the role, he said, \\"I read a lot of the comic books. I found out the storyline of my character, who is Toad,\\" he said. \\"X-Men fans will know that Ray Park played him in the first movie, so it's a generation story of how he came to be. It's really cool.\\" He is shown as an American GI - along with Alex Summers - who is nearly taken into custody by Bolivar Trask as part of his anti-mutant efforts before they are rescued by Mystique. Toad is later shown working in a diner as he watches Magneto's broadcast.

The X-Men encounter him at a HAARP base and defeat him. He was imprisoned in their holding cell until Magneto later rescued him. Upon arrival on Asteroid M, Emma Frost took control of Toad's mind to open the entrance to Asteroid M. * Armin Shimerman reprises his role of Toad who is a playable character in the sequel X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse. He has special dialogue with Stryfe and Blink (when she is rescued). He also has a crush on Magneto's daughter Scarlet Witch and often praises and compliments her. * In the GBA version of X-Men: The Official Game (which fills in the gap between X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand), Toad appeared in a minor role. * Toad appears in X-Men: Destiny, voiced by Alexander Polinsky in a cockney accent. * Toad is featured as a boss in the Facebook game Marvel: Avengers Alliance. * Toad is a playable character in Lego Marvel Super Heroes, voiced by Greg Cipes. * Toad appears as an opponent in Marvel Heroes, but only with Blob.http://marvelheroes.info/villain/toad/ Toys * Toad had one figure in the Marvel Legends toy line's debut, and several in the X-Men Movie line. * There was also a figure made of X-Men: Evolution Toad which came with 'slime dumping locker' accessory. * The X-Men movie lineup includes a figure of Toad, modeled after Ray Park, with a long removable and whipping tongue as his accessory.

IDDFS is optimal like breadth-first search, but uses much less memory; at each iteration, it visits the nodes in the search tree in the same order as depth- first search, but the cumulative order in which nodes are first visited is effectively breadth-first.  Algorithm for directed graphs The following pseudocode shows IDDFS implemented in terms of a recursive depth-limited DFS (called DLS) for directed graphs. This implementation of IDDFS does not account for already-visited nodes and therefore does not work for undirected graphs. function IDDFS(root) is for depth from 0 to ‚àû do found, remaining ‚Üê DLS(root, depth) if found ‚â† null then return found else if not remaining then return null function DLS(node, depth) is if depth = 0 then if node is a goal then return (node, true) else return (null, true) (Not found, but may have children) else if depth > 0 then any_remaining ‚Üê false foreach child of node do found, remaining ‚Üê DLS(child, depth‚àí1) if found ‚â† null then return (found, true) if remaining then any_remaining ‚Üê true (At least one node found at depth, let IDDFS deepen) return (null, any_remaining) If the goal node is found, then DLS unwinds the recursion returning with no further iterations. Otherwise, if at least one node exists at that level of depth, the remaining flag will let IDDFS continue. 2-tuples are useful as return value to signal IDDFS to continue deepening or stop, in case tree depth and goal membership are unknown a priori. Another solution could use sentinel values instead to represent not found or remaining level results.  Properties  IDDFS combines depth-first search's space-efficiency and breadth-first search's completeness (when the branching factor is finite). If a solution exists, it will find a solution path with the fewest arcs. Since iterative deepening visits states multiple times, it may seem wasteful, but it turns out to be not so costly, since in a tree most of the nodes are in the bottom level, so it does not matter much if the upper levels are visited multiple times. The main advantage of IDDFS in game tree searching is that the earlier searches tend to improve the commonly used heuristics, such as the killer heuristic and alpha- beta pruning, so that a more accurate estimate of the score of various nodes at the final depth search can occur, and the search completes more quickly since it is done in a better order. For example, alpha-beta pruning is most efficient if it searches the best moves first. A second advantage is the responsiveness of the algorithm. Because early iterations use small values for d, they execute extremely quickly. This allows the algorithm to supply early indications of the result almost immediately, followed by refinements as d increases. When used in an interactive setting, such as in a chess-playing program, this facility allows the program to play at any time with the current best move found in the search it has completed so far. This can be phrased as each depth of the search corecursively producing a better approximation of the solution, though the work done at each step is recursive. This is not possible with a traditional depth-first search, which does not produce intermediate results.  Asymptotic analysis = Time complexity  The time complexity of IDDFS in a (well-balanced) tree works out to be the same as breadth-first search, i.e. O(b^{d}), where b is the branching factor and d is the depth of the goal. = Proof = In an iterative deepening search, the nodes at depth d are expanded once, those at depth d - 1 are expanded twice, and so on up to the root of the search tree, which is expanded d+1 times. So the total number of expansions in an iterative deepening search is :b^{d} + 2b^{d-1} + 3b^{d-2} + \\\\cdots + (d-1)b^{2} + db + (d + 1) = \\\\sum_{i=0}^d (d+1-i)b^i where b^{d} is the number of expansions at depth d, 2b^{d - 1} is the number of expansions at depth d - 1, and so on. Factoring out b^{d} gives :b^{d}(1 + 2b^{-1} + 3b^{-2} + \\\\cdots + (d-1)b^{2 - d} + db^{1 - d} + (d + 1)b^{-d}) Now let x = \\\\frac{1}{b} = b^{-1}. Then we have :b^{d}(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \\\\cdots + (d-1)x^{d - 2} + dx^{d - 1} + (d + 1)x^d) This is less than the infinite series :b^{d}(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + \\\\cdots ) = b^{d} \\\\left( \\\\sum^{\\\\infty}_{n=1}n x^{n-1} \\\\right) which converges to :b^d (1 - x)^{-2} = b^d \\\\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}, for abs(x) < 1 That is, we have b^{d}(1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \\\\cdots + (d-1)x^{d - 2} + dx^{d - 1} + (d + 1)x^d) \\\\leq b^d (1 - x)^{-2}, for abs(x) < 1 Since (1 - x)^{-2} or \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{b} \\\\right)^{-2} is a constant independent of d (the depth), if b > 1 (i.e., if the branching factor is greater than 1), the running time of the depth-first iterative deepening search is O(b^d). = Example = For b=10 and d=5 the number is : \\\\sum_{i=0}^{5} (5 + 1 - i)10^i = 6 + 50 + 400 + 3000 + 20000 + 100000 = 123456 All together, an iterative deepening search from depth 1 all the way down to depth d expands only about 11 \\\\% more nodes than a single breadth-first or depth-limited search to depth d, when b = 10. The higher the branching factor, the lower the overhead of repeatedly expanded states, but even when the branching factor is 2, iterative deepening search only takes about twice as long as a complete breadth-first search. This means that the time complexity of iterative deepening is still O(b^d).  Space complexity  The space complexity of IDDFS is O(d), where d is the depth of the goal. = Proof = Since IDDFS, at any point, is engaged in a depth-first search, it need only store a stack of nodes which represents the branch of the tree it is expanding. Since it finds a solution of optimal length, the maximum depth of this stack is d, and hence the maximum amount of space is O(d). In general, iterative deepening is the preferred search method when there is a large search space and the depth of the solution is not known. Example For the following graph: 200px a depth-first search starting at A, assuming that the left edges in the shown graph are chosen before right edges, and assuming the search remembers previously-visited nodes and will not repeat them (since this is a small graph), will visit the nodes in the following order: A, B, D, F, E, C, G. The edges traversed in this search form a Tr√©maux tree, a structure with important applications in graph theory. Performing the same search without remembering previously visited nodes results in visiting nodes in the order A, B, D, F, E, A, B, D, F, E, etc. forever, caught in the A, B, D, F, E cycle and never reaching C or G. Iterative deepening prevents this loop and will reach the following nodes on the following depths, assuming it proceeds left-to-right as above: *0: A *1: A, B, C, E (Iterative deepening has now seen C, when a conventional depth- first search did not.) *2: A, B, D, F, C, G, E, F (It still sees C, but that it came later. Also it sees E via a different path, and loops back to F twice.) *3: A, B, D, F, E, C, G, E, F, B For this graph, as more depth is added, the two cycles \\"ABFE\\" and \\"AEFB\\" will simply get longer before the algorithm gives up and tries another branch.  Related algorithms  Similar to iterative deepening is a search strategy called iterative lengthening search that works with increasing path-cost limits instead of depth-limits. It expands nodes in the order of increasing path cost; therefore the first goal it encounters is the one with the cheapest path cost. But iterative lengthening incurs substantial overhead that makes it less useful than iterative deepening. Iterative deepening A* is a best-first search that performs iterative deepening based on \\"\\"-values similar to the ones computed in the A* algorithm.  Bidirectional IDDFS  IDDFS has a bidirectional counterpart, which alternates two searches: one starting from the source node and moving along the directed arcs, and another one starting from the target node and proceeding along the directed arcs in opposite direction (from the arc's head node to the arc's tail node). The search process first checks that the source node and the target node are same, and if so, returns the trivial path consisting of a single source/target node. Otherwise, the forward search process expands the child nodes of the source node (set A), the backward search process expands the parent nodes of the target node (set B), and it is checked whether A and B intersect. If so, a shortest path is found. Otherwise, the search depth is incremented and the same computation takes place. One limitation of the algorithm is that the shortest path consisting of an odd number of arcs will not be detected. Suppose we have a shortest path \\\\langle s, u, v, t \\\\rangle. When the depth will reach two hops along the arcs, the forward search will proceed to v from u, and the backward search will proceed from v to u. Pictorially, the search frontiers will go through each other, and instead a suboptimal path consisting of an even number of arcs will be returned. This is illustrated in the below diagrams: 400px What comes to space complexity, the algorithm colors the deepest nodes in the forward search process in order to detect existence of the middle node where the two search processes meet. Additional difficulty of applying bidirectional IDDFS is that if the source and the target nodes are in different strongly connected components, say, s \\\\in S, t \\\\in T, if there is no arc leaving S and entering T, the search will never terminate. = Time and space complexities = The running time of bidirectional IDDFS is given by : 2\\\\sum_{k = 0}^{n / 2} b^k and the space complexity is given by : b^{n/2}, where n is the number of nodes in the shortest s,t-path. Since the running time complexity of iterative deepening depth-first search is \\\\sum_{k=0}^n b^k, the speedup is roughly : \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=0}^n b^k}{2\\\\sum_{k=0}^{n/2} b^k} =\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1 - b^{n+1}}{1-b}}{2\\\\frac{1 - b^{n/2 + 1}}{1-b}} = \\\\frac{1-b^{n+1}}{2(1 - b^{n/2 + 1})} = \\\\frac{b^{n+1} - 1}{2(b^{n/2+1} - 1)} \\\\approx \\\\frac{b^{n+1}}{2b^{n/2+1}} = \\\\Theta(b^{n/2}). = Pseudocode = function Build-Path(s, Œº, B) is œÄ <- Find-Shortest-Path(s, Œº) (Recursively compute the path to the relay node) remove the last node from œÄ return œÄ \\\\circ B (Append the backward search stack) function Depth-Limited-Search-Forward(u, Œî, F) is if Œî = 0 then F <- F \\\\cup {u} (Mark the node) return foreach child of u do Depth-Limited-Search- Forward(child, Œî ‚àí 1, F) function Depth-Limited-Search-Backward(u, Œî, B, F) is prepend u to B if Œî = 0 then if u in F then return u (Reached the marked node, use it as a relay node) remove the head node of B return null foreach parent of u do Œº <- Depth-Limited-Search-Backward(parent, Œî ‚àí 1, B, F) if Œº eq null then return Œº remove the head node of B return null function Find-Shortest- Path(s, t) is if s = t then return <s> F, B, Œî <- ‚àÖ, ‚àÖ, 0 forever do Depth- Limited-Search-Forward(s, Œî, F) foreach Œ¥ = Œî, Œî \\\\+ 1 do Œº <- Depth-Limited- Search-Backward(t, Œ¥, B, F) if Œº eq null then return Build-Path(s, Œº, B) (Found a relay node) F, Œî <- ‚àÖ, Œî \\\\+ 1  References  Category:Graph algorithms Category:Search algorithms ","title":"Iterative deepening depth-first search"},{"id":"433329","text":"The Blob (Frederick J. \\"Fred\\" Dukes) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of the X-Men. A mutant originally depicted as an obese circus freak, the Blob claims to be immovable when he so desires. He possesses an extreme amount of pliable body mass, which grants him superhuman strength. Possessing the demeanor of a bully, he mostly uses his powers for petty crime and as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants and Freedom Force. He is one of the most prominent, long-running mutants to be depowered as a result of the Decimation storyline. The Blob appeared in the 2009 superhero film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, where he was played by actor Kevin Durand. Wrestler \\"Giant\\" Gustav Claude Ouimet had a cameo as Blob in X-Men: Apocalypse. Publication history Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co- writer Jack Kirby, he first appeared in X-Men #3 (January 1964). Fictional character biography=Early years Born in Lubbock, Texas, Fred J. Dukes starts out as a member of a circus sideshow under the name \\"The Blob\\". His act was that he could remain stationary when others tried to move him. He is detected and contacted by Charles Xavier via Cyclops, who sees his performance and tells him that he (Dukes) is a mutant, and asks him to join the X-Men. At the X-Mansion, the other X-Men dislike Dukes for his obnoxious attitude. Iceman uses his power against Dukes to create an ice block around his foot, but the Blob easily escapes. The Blob refuses Xavier's invitation, saying he is better than the other X-Men. When Xavier tries erasing his mind of what has transpired, the Blob escapes the X-Mansion despite the efforts of the Beast and uses the sewer to get away without being followed. He tells the manager of the carnival he is taking over, then gathers up the other circus members and they attack the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters, as he plans to get technology from the X-Men and take over the world. Meanwhile, Xavier works on a device which will allow him to erase the memories of many people. The carnival succeeds in defeating the X-Men despite a warning from Angel. They tie up the X-Men and leave them on the lawn. They then enter the X-Mansion to find the Professor and his technology. Xavier telepathically contacts Marvel Girl and tells her to remove her blindfold using her telekinesis, then levitate a knife from a performer's tent to cut through her bonds, after which she frees the other members. Xavier is able to wipe everyone's minds after the carnival is stopped by a wall of ice, and the Blob goes back to the circus.X-Men Vol. 1 #3) Joining the Brotherhood The mutant Magneto soon seeks out the Blob to recruit him into his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, restoring his memory through a jarring blow to the head. The Blob temporarily accepts the invitation, but leaves when it is revealed that Magneto has no real concern for the Blob's safety after he is hit by explosives which were launched at the X-Men. He goes back to the Circus.X-Men Vol. 1 #7 He teams up with Unus due to the alien Lucifer, who soon becomes his confidant. They disguise themselves as X-Men and commit crimes.X-Men Vol. 1 #20 The Blob also serves as a member of Factor Three.X-Men Vol. 1 #37-39 He briefly works as an operative for the Secret Empire, where he fights the Beast.Amazing Adventures #12-13 With the reorganized Brotherhood, the Blob fights Professor X and the Defenders. He is reverted to infancy by Alpha the Ultimate Mutant.Defenders #15-16 The Blob is later returned to adulthood, and fights the Champions of Los Angeles.Champions #17 He later winds up in prison, but is freed by Mystique in order to recruit him into her incarnation of the Brotherhood.Uncanny X-Men #140 He becomes part of the plot to assassinate Senator Kelly, the event which leads to the apocalyptic alternate future of Days of Future Past.Uncanny X-Men #141-142 He also battles the Avengers as a member of the Brotherhood.Avengers Annual #10 With Unus, he battles the Hulk.Marvel Fanfare #7 With the Brotherhood, he battles the X-Men once more.Uncanny X-Men #177-178 He witnesses the apparent death of Unus, then goes berserk and attacks Spider-Man and the Black Cat.Spectacular Spider-Man #91 He remains with the Brotherhood, becoming a special operative of the federal government when the Brotherhood is reformed as the government-sponsored Freedom Force. On the team's first mission, they help capture Magneto.Uncanny X-Men #199 They then battle the X-Men in San Francisco.Uncanny X-Men #206 Blob also participates in Freedom Force's capture of the Avengers for the federal government.Avengers Annual #15 With Freedom Force, he attempts to capture Rusty Collins, then battles X-Factor.X-Factor #8-10 With Freedom Force, he battles the X-Men in San Francisco,Uncanny X-Men #223 and later assists in the attempt to arrest the X-Men in Dallas,Uncanny X-Men #225 battling the New Mutants in Dallas as well.New Mutants #64 He battles X-Factor again,X-Factor #30-31 and under Spiral's orders, he and Pyro battle Daredevil in an attempt to capture a young mutant.Daredevil #269 He again attempts to arrest Rusty Collins, fighting the New Mutants again.New Mutants #78-80 He joins Avalanche and Pyro in attacking Avengers headquarters.Avengers #312 With Freedom Force, he finally captures Rusty Collins and fellow New Mutant Skids. He helps to capture Cable, but is defeated by Cable and then by Sunspot during an attempt to recapture Cable.New Mutants #86-89 With Freedom Force, he assists in thwarting a jailbreak from the Vault.Vault Graphic Novel After Freedom Force's dissolution, the Blob participates in other versions of the Brotherhood, including one led by Toad and another led by Professor X; the Blob takes over as leader of the latter when Xavier leaves. The psychic entity Onslaught later recruits Blob, vastly upgrading his powers and abilities (in his powered-up state, his mutation becomes virtually identical to that of Phat). During this time, the Blob fights the various members of X-Force and is soundly defeated in each encounter. Months later, a powered-down Dukes joins the new Brotherhood led once again by Mystique, alongside Toad, Sabretooth, and the daughter of the original Mastermind. When Exodus recreates the Brotherhood of Mutants, Blob offers to join but is quickly dismissed by Exodus, who considers him useless. This is a major blow to Dukes' already weak self-esteem, for which he seeks the counsel of therapist Sean Garrison. After a session, Blob attacks the Xavier Institute, though he is defeated by the combined efforts of the New Mutants and the Hellions. He is then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. Post M-Day Due to the Scarlet Witch's depowering of 90% of Earth's mutants, the Blob is one of the thousands to lose their power, though his epidermis does not shrink to compensate for his loss of mass, leaving him with huge folds of loose skin. The depressed Blob attempts to commit suicide, but his skin folds prevent him from cutting through to any major blood vessels on his throat or wrists. Someone that resembles the Blob is seen apprehended by the Thunderbolts and is seen in the Folding Castle's Detention Quadrant.Thunderbolts vol. 1 #103 Blob later resurfaces as a member of X-Cell, a group of depowered mutants that blames the government for the loss of their powers, attacking Mutant Town in defiance of the Decimation. After mistakenly getting into a fight with Rictor and Multiple Man and getting in a cheap shot on Rictor, he stole a car. With fellow X-Cell member Fatale, he attempted to flee, eventually hitting an open manhole (left open earlier in the day by Strong Guy and Wolfsbane) and causing the car to crash leaving Blob hanging from the car. When both of them ran afoul of Marrow, Blob was thrown from the car. Through unknown means, Dukes loses the excess skin and his fortunes turn in his favor. Now known as Freddie Dukes, he has become a weight-loss guru in Japan, and is to star in an upcoming movie filmed in San Francisco made by Kingo Sunen. He is also seen with Magneto and the High Evolutionary.Uncanny X-Men #500 In the miniseries \\"Magneto: Not a Hero\\", Joseph is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with Astra and mutated deformed versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad. It is soon revealed that these actually are clones created by Joseph.Magneto: Not a Hero #1-4 In Uncanny X-Men #16, Fred Dukes is working with Mystique in Genosha and is once again shown as heavily obese and appears to have his powers restored.Uncanny X-Men #16 (2014) Mystique has supplied him with Mutant Growth Hormones (MGH) extracted from Dazzler. Powers and abilities Before being depowered, the Blob's mutant physiology granted him a number of advantages. He had superhuman strength, endurance, and great resistance to physical injury. The Blob's elastic, blubbery skin is difficult to penetrate by gunfire, missiles, and even Wolverine's claws, though with sufficient force and a favorable angle, the claws can lacerate his flesh. On one occasion, a concentrated optic blast fired by Cyclops was sufficient to puncture a hole through his shoulder, much to the shock of Dukes himself. The magic swords of both Black Raazer and the Arabian Knight were able to harm him. He could also alter his personal mono-directional gravity field beneath himself to make himself virtually immovable as long as he was in contact with the ground, although an incredible force can uproot him, along with a chunk of whatever he is standing on. The only beings on record to have been able to move the Blob against his wishes are the Hulk, Juggernaut, and Strong Guy (powered-up near his limit by absorbing kinetic energy),X-Factor #107 although Colossus has managed to lift Dukes by digging underground and raising the piece of earth Dukes stands on, stating this as an exception to his immovability. Magneto once was able to move the Blob by lifting the ground under the Blob's feet via metal pipes.Uncanny X-Men #7 Despite his appearance, the Blob's speed and agility are those of a fairly athletic male of normal stature, a fact which frequently catches his opponents by surprise. The Blob's superhuman strength greatly increased over the years, in a manner similar to that of the Thing. This improvement is said to be a result of his ongoing mutation. The Blob is vulnerable to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears do not have the same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, Sleepwalker defeated the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The Hulk once took the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he is all but invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to concussions and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as Daredevil knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.Daredevil Vol. 1 #269 Dukes can be incapacitated by drinking alcohol, although due to his immense mass, a large amount of alcohol is required. Other versions=Age of Apocalypse Blob appears briefly in the Age of Apocalypse as a test subject that Henry McCoy was toying with in the Breeding Pens in a direct violation of the Kelly Pact that Apocalypse signed in order to keep the Human High Council occupied and at bay while he rallied his forces.X-Men: Alpha McCoy considered Blob's mutation useless which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, and attacked his experimenter. Havok came to McCoy's rescue, but Dukes proved to be even too much for the Prelate to handle. His pseudo freedom was fleeting because moments later the head of the pens, Havok's older brother Cyclops, showed up to deliver a searing optic blast that would put him back in his place.Factor X #1 When the Age of Apocalypse was revisited in the 10th anniversary, Blob was a member of Sinister's team known as Sinister Six. It appears that McCoy or Sinister himself had his powers altered in a manner that allowed Blob to project his gravitational field outward. When the Sinister Six met the X-Men in battle, Dukes' new powers were used to sweep the X-Men off their feet with the Silver Samurai receiving a double dose. Quicksilver attempted to fell the behemoth with multiple punches, but Dukes remained standing regardless of how many hits he got in. It was not until Rogue stepped in with a punch that had the power necessary to overtake him that the mammoth would topple over. Following the Sinister Six's defeat, Blob managed to escape.X-Men: Age of Apocalypse #6 Later he's seen as a member of the Black Legion, a group of psychotic altered mutants under the supervision of a now insane Weapon X.Uncanny X-Force #12 It is also revealed that he left the Age of Apocalypse timeline and joined Archangel's quest to become the new heir of Apocalypse. He's seen in Akkaba Metropolis under the North Pole and he was the one to prevent the escape of Psylocke.Uncanny X-Force #15 In the \\"Final Execution Saga\\" story line in Uncanny X-Force, Fredrick is part of a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants led by Daken with the aim of taking down X-Force and turning Evan Sabahnur into a new Apocalypse.Uncanny X-Force #30 During the saga the X-Force team is captured and tortured after Nightcrawler from the Age of Apocalypse universe betrays the team,Uncanny X-Force #32 to get his revenge on Fredrick due to him eating his wife Linda. Kurt seemingly succeeds in his goal of revenge by teleporting a live shark into Fredrick's stomach during a fight with him, causing him to be devoured from within.Uncanny X-Force #33 Cable & Deadpool Deadpool's search for Cable across alternate timelines forces an encounter with the Blob of \\"an age of Apocalypse\\" (not to be confused with the X-Men story arc of the same name). In this reality, Blob has taken the mantle of Famine, one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse.Cable & Deadpool #15 House of M Put in an internment camp after Bolivar Trask's rise to power in the House of M reality, he was freed in Magneto's first major raid on US soil. After being freed, he first took his mutant name, \\"Blob\\" and was instrumental in the destruction of several Sentinels. He then joined Magneto's mutant group.Civil War: House of M #2 Blob is seen as a member of the Genoshan Black Ops version of the Marauders. It was later revealed that Dukes is also a member of an NYPD strike team called the Brotherhood.House of M: Avengers #2 Marvel Noir Eric Magnus is Chief of Detectives and Fred appears as a member of his Brotherhood, a cabal of bent policemen. He is initially partnered with rookie Detective Peter Magnus, and later with Detective Mortimer Toynbee.X-Men Noir #1 Marvel Zombies Blob appears twice in the Marvel Zombies universe. He is alive when first encountered, but being pursued by several zombie versions of Marvel characters, including Pyro, Black Cat, Iron Fist, Toad and Rhino.Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness #2-3 (2007) He is later seen as a zombie fighting the X-Men.Marvel Zombies #5 (May 2006) Ultimate Marvel Ultimate Blob in a chokehold by Cyclops with Toad's tongue around his arm. The Ultimate Universe version of Blob, real name Franklin Dukes,Ultimatum: X-Men Requiem #1 is a member of the Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy. His powers are similar to that of his Earth-616 counterpart, although he has been moved by a helicopter during the Weapon X saga, suggesting that he may be less powerful. He seems to eat constantly, and is often seen browsing the internet or chatting to people via instant messaging. One such incident sees the Blob pretend to be a female model/physicist named Naomi who cyber-seduces the X-Man Beast‚Äîleading to the discovery of Magneto's survival and to the Ultimate War saga. Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, the Blob may very well have additional superhuman-eating powers as part of his mutation, as not only has he threatened to actually eat his enemies alive, but it was expressly stated that he had personally consumed all of the Weapon X computers in a matter of moments when the Brotherhood invaded the Weapon X compound to rescue the X-Men.Ultimate X-Men Volume 2: Return to Weapon X In Ultimatum, the Blob is seen eating the Wasp, proving the cannibalistic claims are true.Ultimatum #2 However, Hank Pym grows to a gigantic size and bites the Blob's head off in return.Ultimatum #3 It has been revealed that Blob was Liz Allan's estranged genetic father after she discovered her own mutant abilities. He impregnated Liz's mother while working for a circus sideshow.Ultimate Spider-Man #120 It has also been shown that the Blob fathered a son (Theodore \\"Tubby Teddy\\" Allan) by an unknown woman. Teddy is in high school and has his father's same bulky appearance and similar abilities, as he was shot at point blank range and merely said \\"It tickles\\".Ultimate Comics: X #4 He later joins Quicksilver's new Brotherhood as the new iteration of Blob.Ultimate Comics: X #5 Planet X Blob is an enforcer on the alternate universe when the Apocalypse Twins skew the time lines and create a mutant utopia.Uncanny Avengers 18 Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows In the second volume of Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows, Blob is seen as a member of the Brotherhood of Mutants.Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows Vol. 2 #6  Age of X-Man  In the alternate universe created by Nate Grey in Age of X-Man, Blob is the leader of the X-Tremists. This version of Fred Dukes is a dramatic departure from previous representations; he is \\"soft-hearted, bookish, kind and gentle\\". Blob has romantic feelings for his teammate Betsy Braddock. According to X-Tremists writer Leah Williams, \\"My hope in removing the villainy aspects of his character for X-tremists was to make people confront how they feel about fatness in general by utilizing an intriguing aspect of AoX: there is no bodily prejudice.\\" In other media=Television * The \\"massive, immovable Blob\\" makes a brief appearance in the Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends episode \\"The Prison Plot\\" where he was among the mutants that Magneto tries to free from prison. * The Blob appears as a member of Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants in the 1989 animated pilot X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men, voiced by Alan Oppenheimer. * The Blob appears in several episodes of the 1990s X-Men animated series, voiced by Robert Cait.

As in the comics, Blob was working as a strongman in a Texas sideshow when approached by the X-Men to join their team. Instead, he was reeled in by Mystique before the X-Men get the chance to approach him. In the end of the series, in Professor Xavier's prophetic vision of the future, Blob and the rest of the Brotherhood joins S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Freedom Force. * Blob first appears in the Wolverine and the X-Men episode \\"Hindsight\\" Pt. 2, voiced by Stephen Stanton.

After the team disbands, the once-muscular and formidable mutant soldier developed an eating disorder and became extremely obese. Wraith now has him in training as a boxer to lose weight. Wraith warns Logan not to make fun of his weight, but Logan taunts Dukes, and when he calls him \\"Bub\\", Dukes mishears this as \\"blob\\" and starts fighting him. Dukes' mass absorbs Logan's blows, giving him the upper hand until he accidentally stuns himself with a head-butt to Logan's adamantium-reinforced skull, allowing Logan to knock him out by slamming his elbow onto Dukes' head. Once revived, Dukes reveals that Creed and Stryker are working together, capturing mutants and experimenting on them, having allegedly learned the information from Agent Zero.

It is Georgia's dominant religious institution, and a majority of Georgian people are members. The Orthodox Church of Georgia is one of the oldest churches in the world. It asserts apostolic foundation, and its historical roots must be traced to the early and late Christianization of Iberia and Colchis by Saint Andrew in the 1st century AD and by Saint Nino in the 4th century AD, respectively. As in similar autocephalous Orthodox churches, the Church's highest governing body is the Holy Synod of bishops. The church is headed by the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia, currently Ilia II, who was elected in 1977. Orthodox Christianity was the state religion throughout most of Georgia's history until 1921, when it was conquered by the Russian Red Army during the Russian-Georgian War and became part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.). The current Constitution of Georgia recognizes the special role of the Georgian Orthodox Church in the country's history, but also stipulates the independence of the church from the state. Government relations are further defined and regulated by the Concordat of 2002. The church is the most trusted institution in Georgia. According to a 2013 survey 95% respondents had a favorable opinion of its work. It is highly influential in the public sphere and is considered Georgia's most influential institution. History=OriginsTraditions regarding Christianity's first appearance in Iberia and Colchis= According to Georgian Orthodox Church tradition, the first preacher of the Gospel in Colchis and Iberia (modern-day Western and Eastern Georgia) was the apostle Andrew, the First- called. According to the official church account, Andrew preached across Georgia, carrying with him an acheiropoieta of the Virgin Mary (an icon believed to be created \\"not by human hand\\"), and founded Christian communities believed to be the direct ancestors of the Church. However, modern historiography considers this account mythical, and the fruit of a late tradition, derived from 9th-century Byzantine legends about the travels of St. Andrew in eastern Christendom. Similar traditions regarding Saint Andrew exist in Ukraine, Cyprus and Romania. Other apostles claimed by the Church to have preached in Georgia include Simon the Canaanite (better known in the West as Simon the Zealot) said to have been buried near Sokhumi, in the village of Anakopia, and Saint Matthias, said to have preached in the southwest of Georgia, and to have been buried in Gonio, a village not far from Batumi. The Church also claims the presence in Georgia of the Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus, coming north from Armenia. =The Conversion of Iberia= Saint Nino of Cappadocia, baptizer of the Georgians. The propagation of Christianity in present-day Georgia before the 4th century is still poorly known. The first documented event in this process is the preaching of Saint Nino and its consequences, although exact dates are still debated. Saint Nino, honored as Equal to the Apostles, was according to tradition the daughter of a Roman general from Cappadocia. She preached in the Caucasian Kingdom of Iberia (also known as Kartli) in the first half of the 4th century, and her intercession eventually led to the conversion of King Mirian III, his wife Queen (later Saint) Nana and their family. Cyril Toumanoff dates the conversion of Mirian to 334, his official baptism and subsequent adoption of Christianity as the official religion of Iberia to 337. From the first centuries C.E., the cult of Mithras, pagan beliefs, and Zoroastrianism were commonly practiced in Georgia. However, they now started to gradually decline, even despite Zoroastrianism becoming a second established religion of Iberia after the Peace of Acilisene in 378, and more precisely by the mid-fifth century. The royal baptism and organization of the Church were accomplished by priests sent from Constantinople by Constantine the Great. Conversion of the people of Iberia proceeded quickly in the plains, but pagan beliefs long subsisted in mountain regions. The western Kingdom of Lazica was politically and culturally distinct from Iberia at that time, and culturally more integrated into the Roman Empire; some of its cities already had bishops by the time of the First Council of Nicea (325). Expansion and Transformation of the Church The conversion of Iberia marked only the beginnings of the formation of the Georgian Orthodox Church. In the next centuries, different processes took place that shaped the Church, and gave it, by the beginning of the 11th century, the main characteristics that it has retained until now. Those processes concern the institutional status of the Church inside Eastern Christianity, its evolution into a national church with authority over all of Georgia, and the dogmatic evolution of the church.. =The long path to autocephaly= In the 4th and 5th centuries, the Church of Iberia was strictly subordinate to the Apostolic See of Antioch: all bishops were consecrated in Antioch before being sent to Iberia. Around 480, in a step towards autocephaly, the Patriarch of Antioch Peter the Fuller elevated the Bishop of Mtskheta to the rank of Catholicos of Iberia with the approval, or at the instigation, of the Byzantine emperor Zeno. The Church remained subordinate to the Antioch Church; the Catholicos could appoint local bishops, but until the 740s, his own election had to be confirmed by the synod of the Church of Antioch, and even after the 8th century, annual payments were made to the Church of Antioch. In 1010, the Catholicos of Iberia was elevated to the honor of Patriarch. From then on, the premier hierarch of the Georgian Orthodox Church carried the official title of Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia. =Territorial expansion and birth of a national church= Jvari Monastery, near Mtskheta, one of Georgia's oldest surviving monasteries (6th century) At the beginnings of the Church history, what is now Georgia was not unified yet politically, and would not be until the beginnings of the 11th century. The western half of the country, mostly constituted of the kingdom of Lazica, or Egrisi, was under much stronger influence of the Byzantine Empire than eastern Iberia, where Byzantine, Armenian and Persian influences coexisted. Such division was reflected in major differences in the development of Christianity. In the east, from the conversion of Mirian, the church developed under the protection of the kings of Iberia, or Kartli. A major factor in the development of the church in Iberia was the introduction of the Georgian alphabet. The impulse for a script adapted to the language of the local people stemmed from efforts to evangelize the population. A similar dynamic led to the creation of the Armenian alphabet. The exact origin of the script is still debated, but must have happened in the second half of the 4th century or the early 5th century. The introduction of monasticism, and its tremendous development, in Iberia in the 6th century encouraged both foreign cultural inputs and the development of local written works. From that moment, together with translations of the Bible, ecclesiastical literature in Georgian was produced in Iberia, most prominently biographies of saints, such as the \\"Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik\\" and the \\"Martyrdom of Saint Abo\\". Many of the saints from the first centuries of the church were not ethnic Georgians (Shushanik was an Armenian princess, Abo an Arab), showing that the church had not yet acquired a strictly national character. This changed only during the 7th century, after the wide political and cultural changes brought about by the Muslim conquests. This new menace for local culture, religion, and autonomy, and the difficulties to maintain constant contact with other Christian communities, led to a drastic cultural change inside the Church, which became for the first time ethnically focused: it evolved into a \\"Kartvelian Church\\". The bishops and Catholicos were now all ethnic Georgians, as were the saints whose \\"Lives\\" were written from that period. In the western half of Georgia, ancient Colchis, which had remained under stronger Roman influence, local churches were under jurisdiction of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and were culturally and linguistically Hellenistic. Bishops from the port cities took part in ecumenical councils, from the Council of Nicea (325) together with those from the Byzantine territories. From the 6th century, those churches, whose language remained Greek, were headed by a metropolitan in Phasis. The integration of the Black sea coastal regions into what came to be known as Georgia was a long process. A first step came with the Arab invasions of the 7th and 8th centuries, which mostly affected Iberia. Refugees, among them noblemen such as Archil of Kakheti, took shelter in the West, either in Abkhazia or Tao-Klarjeti, and brought there their culture. Such movements led to the progressive merge of western and eastern churches under the latter, as Byzantine power decreased and doctrinal differences disappeared. The western Church broke away from Constantinople and recognized the authority of the Catholicos of Mtskheta by the end of the 9th century. Political unification under the Bagrationi dynasty consolidated this evolution by the end of the 10th century: in a single, unified Kingdom of Georgia, there would be a unified Georgian Church. =Relations with the Armenian and Byzantine churches= During the first centuries of Christianity, the South Caucasus was culturally much more united than in later periods, and constant interactions between what would become the Georgian and Armenian Churches shaped both of them. The Armenian Church was founded two decades earlier, and was during the 4th century larger and more influential than the Church in Iberia. As such, it exerted strong influence in the early doctrine of the Church. The influence of the Church of Jerusalem was also strong, especially in liturgy. The Georgian-Armenian ecclesial relationship would be tested after the Council of Chalcedon (451), whose christological conclusions were rejected by the Armenian Church and important portions of the Church of Antioch, as well as the Coptic Church based in Alexandria. At first, the Catholicoi of Iberia chose the anti-Chalcedonian camp together with the Armenians, even though diversity of opinions was always present among the clergy, and tolerated by the hierarchy. The king of Iberia, Vakhtang Gorgasali, who sought an alliance with Byzantium against the Persians, accepted the Henotikon, a compromise put forward by the Byzantine Emperor Zeno in 482. Such conciliation was attempted again at the First Council of Dvin in 506, and the status quo was preserved during the 6th century. Around 600 however, tensions flared between the Armenian Apostolic Church and the church in Iberia, as the Armenian Church attempted to assert prominence in the Caucasus, in both hierarchical and doctrinal matters, whereas the Catholicos of Mtskheta, Kirion I, leaned towards the Byzantine, Chalcedonian side of the debate, as Iberia was once again seeking imperial support against the Sassanid Empire, who had abolished the Kingdom in 580. The Third Council of Dvin, in 607, sanctioned the rupture with the Armenian Church. The following centuries confirmed the Byzantine orientation of the Georgian Church, and its estrangement from the Armenian Church. Confessional disputes remained impossible to overcome, and were a staple of theological literature in both areas. The integration of western and eastern Georgian churches from the 9th century also sealed the Orthodox nature of the Georgian Church, as Byzantine liturgy and cultural forms spread to the detriment of traditional Oriental practice. The Church during the Golden Age of Georgia Between the 11th and the early 13th centuries, Georgia experienced a political, economical and cultural golden age, as the Bagrationi dynasty managed to unite western and eastern halves of the country into a single kingdom. To accomplish that goal, kings relied much on the prestige of the Church, and enrolled its political support by giving it many economical advantages, immunity from taxes and large appanages. At the same time, the kings, most notably David the Builder (1089‚Äì1125), used state power to interfere in church affairs. In 1103, he summoned the council of Ruisi-Urbnisi, which condemned Armenian Miaphysitism in stronger terms than ever before, and gave unprecedented power, second only to the Patriarch, to his friend and advisor George of Chqondidi. For the following centuries, the Church would remain a crucial feudal institution, whose economical and political power would always be at least equal to that of the main noble families. Cultural influence of Christianity in Medieval Georgia A page from a rare 12th century Gelati Gospel depicting the Nativity During the Middle Ages, Christianity was the central element of Georgian culture. The development of a written Georgian culture was made possible by the creation of the Georgian alphabet for evangelization purposes. Monasticism played a major role in the following cultural transformation. It started in Georgia in the 6th century, when Assyrian ascetic monks, known as the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers, settled in Iberia and founded a series of monasteries, most notably David Gareja. They were soon joined by local monks, which led to the creation of significant works of hagiographic literature in Georgian, such as the \\"Life of Saint Nino\\" and the \\"Martyrdom of the Holy Queen Shushanik\\". The golden age of Georgian monasticism lasted from the 9th to the 11th century. During that period, Georgian monasteries were founded outside the country, most notably on Mount Sinai, Mount Athos (the Iviron monastery, where the Theotokos Iverskaya icon is still located), and in Palestine. The most prominent figure in the history of Georgian monasticism is judged to be Gregory of Khandzta (759‚Äì861), who founded numerous communities in Tao-Klarjeti. The Khakhuli triptych Specific forms of art were developed in Georgia for religious purposes. Among them, calligraphy, polyphonic church singing, cloisonn√© enamel icons, such as the Khakhuli triptych, and the \\"Georgian cross-dome style\\" of architecture, which characterizes most medieval Georgian churches. The most celebrated examples of Georgian religious architecture of the time include the Gelati Monastery and Bagrati Cathedral in Kutaisi, the Ikalto Monastery complex and Academy, and the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta. Outstanding Georgian representatives of Christian culture include Peter the Iberian (Petre Iberieli, 5th century), Euthymius of Athos (Ekvtime Atoneli, 955‚Äì1028), George of Athos (Giorgi Atoneli, 1009‚Äì1065), Arsen Ikaltoeli (11th century), and Ephrem Mtsire, (11th century). Philosophy flourished between the 11th and 13th century, especially at the Academy of Gelati Monastery, where Ioane Petritsi attempted a synthesis of Christian, aristotelician and neoplatonic thought. The division of the Church (13th‚Äì18th centuries) The Mongol invasions in the 13th century and Tamerlane in the 14‚Äì15th century greatly disrupted Georgian Christianity. The political unity of the country was broken several times, and definitely in the 1460s. Churches and monasteries were targeted by the invaders, as they hosted many treasures. As a result of those devastations, many fell into disrepair or were abandoned. In the western half of Georgia, the Catholicate of Abkhazia was established following the Mongol rule. It seceded from the Mtskheta see as the Kingdom disintegrated, and the western Catholicos thereafter assumed the title of Patriarch. This rival seat, based first in Pitsunda, then at the Gelati Monastery near Kutaisi, subsisted until 1795. During those times, contacts with the Catholic Church increased, first as a way to liberate itself from meddling by the Byzantine Church, then to find stronger allies against invaders. Between 1328 and the early 16th century, a Catholic bishop had his see in Tbilisi to foster those contacts. However, formal reunion with Rome never happened, and the Church remained faithful to Eastern Orthodoxy. In the next centuries, Georgia, weakened and fragmented, fell under the domination of the Ottoman and successive Persian (Safavid, Afsharid, and Qajar) Empires: mostly, the Ottomans ruled the West of the country, the Persians the East, while generally allowing autonomous Georgian kingdoms to subsist under their control. With the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Georgian Christians had lost their traditional recourse against Muslims, and were left to themselves. New martyrs were canonized by the Church after each invasion, most notably Queen Ketevan of Kakheti, who was tortured to death in 1624 for refusing to renounce Christianity on the orders of Abbas I of Persia (Shah-Abbas). Not all members of the royal families of Kartli and Kakheti were so faithful to the Church, though. Many of them, to gain Persian favor, and win the throne over their brothers, converted to Islam, or feigned to, such as David XI of Kartli (Daud Khan). Other noblemen, such as Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani, left the weakened local Church for Catholicism, as missionaries were bringing the printing press and western culture to Georgia around 1700. Only the emergence of a strong Orthodox power, the Russian Empire, could reinforce during the 18th century the status and prestige of the Church among the elites, and the shared Orthodoxy was a potent factor in the calls for Russian intervention in the Caucasus, to liberate Georgia from Muslim domination. The Church under Russian and Soviet rule Patriarch Anton II of Georgia was downgraded to the status of an archbishop by the Russian Imperial authorities. In 1801, the Kingdom of Kartl-Kakheti (Eastern Georgia) was occupied and annexed by the Russian Empire. On 18 July 1811, the autocephalous status of the Georgian Church was abolished by the Russian authorities, despite strong opposition in Georgia, and the Georgian Church was subjected to the synodical rule of the Russian Orthodox Church. From 1817, the metropolitan bishop, or exarch, in charge of the Church was an ethnic Russian, with no knowledge of the Georgian language and culture. The Georgian liturgy was suppressed and replaced with Church Slavonic, ancient frescoes were whitewashed from the walls of many churches, and publication of religious literature in Georgian heavily censored. The 19th century was a time of decline and disaffection, as the church buildings often fell into disrepair, and the trust of people in the institution was diminished by its Russification and corruption. Calls for autocephaly became heard again only after the intellectual national revival that started in the 1870s; the local clergy made such calls during the 1905 revolution, before being repressed again. Following the overthrow of the Tsar Nicholas II in March 1917, Georgia's bishops unilaterally restored the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church on 25 March 1917. These changes were not accepted by the Russian Orthodox Church. After the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921, the Georgian Orthodox Church was subjected to intense harassment. Hundreds of churches were closed by the atheist government and hundreds of monks were killed during Joseph Stalin's purges. The independence of the Georgian Orthodox Church was finally recognized by the Russian Orthodox Church on 31 October 1943: this move was ordered by Stalin as part of the war- time more tolerant policy towards Christianity in the Soviet Union. New anti- religious campaigns took place after the war, especially under Nikita Khrushchev. Corruption and infiltration by the security organs were also plaguing the Church. First signs of revival can be seen from the 1970s, when Eduard Shevardnadze, then secretary of the Georgian SSR's Communist Party, adopted a more tolerant stance, and new Patriarch Ilia II could from 1977 renovate derelict churches, and even build new ones. At the same time, nationalist dissidents such as Zviad Gamsakhurdia emphasized the Christian nature of their struggle against Communist power, and developed relations with Church officials that would come to fruition after 1989. Present-day status The Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi (or Sameba Cathedral), built between 1995 and 2004 On 3 March 1990, the Patriarch of Constantinople recognized and approved the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church (which had in practice been exercised or at least claimed since the 5th century), as well as the Patriarchal honour of the Catholicos. Georgia's subsequent independence in 1991 saw a major revival in the fortunes of the Georgian Orthodox Church. The special role of the Church in the history of the country is recognized in the Article 9 of the Constitution of Georgia; its status and relations with the state were further defined in the Constitutional Agreement, or Concordat, signed by President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze and Patriarch Ilia II on 14 October 2002. The Concordat notably recognizes Church ownership of all churches and monasteries, and grants it a special consultative role in government, especially in matters of education. Eparchies of the Georgian Apostolic Autocephalous Orthodox Church as of 2010 Many churches and monasteries have been rebuilt or renovated since independence, often with help from the state or wealthy individuals. The Church has enjoyed good relations with all three Presidents of Georgia since independence was restored. However, tensions subsist within the Church itself regarding its participation in the ecumenical movement, which Patriarch Ilia II had endorsed (he served as head of the World Council of Churches between 1977 and 1983). Opposition to ecumenism was fueled by fears of massive proselytizing by Protestant denominations in Georgia. In 1997, faced with open dissension from leading monks, Ilia II rescinded Church participation in international ecumenical organizations, though he stopped short of denouncing ecumenism as \\"heresy\\". Opposition against Protestant missionary activity has remained strong in contemporary Georgia, and even led to episodes of violence. Separatism in Abkhazia has also affected the Church: the Eparchy of Sukhumi, regrouping Abkhaz clergy, proclaimed in 2009 its secession from the Georgian Orthodox Church to form a new Abkhazian Orthodox Church; this move remained however unrecognized by any other orthodox authorities, including the Russian Orthodox Church. The relations with the neighboring Armenian Apostolic Church have also been uneasy since independence, notably due to various conflicts about church ownership in both countries. 83.9% of Georgia's population identified themselves as Orthodox in the 2002 census.2002 census results ‚Äì p. 132 In 2002, it was reported that there were 35 eparchies (dioceses) and about 600 churches within the Georgian Orthodox Church, served by 730 priests. The Georgian Orthodox Church has around 3,600,000 members within Georgia (no sources attempt to count members among the Georgian diaspora). Structure=Holy Synod Holy Trinity Church (Tsminda Sameba) of Gergeti, in the mountains of Khevi The Georgian Orthodox Church is managed by the Holy Synod, headed by the Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia. The Holy Synod is the collective body of bishops of the Church. In addition to the Patriarch, the Synod comprises 38 members, including 25 metropolitan bishops, 5 archbishops and 7 simple bishops. As of 2012, the following bishops are members of the Holy Synod, in such hierarchical order: * Metropolitan of Kutaisi and Gelati: Calistratos (Margalitashvili) * Metropolitan of Chiatura and Sachkhere: Daniel (Datushvili) * Metropolitan of Western Europe: Abraham (Garmeliya) * Metropolitan of Tianeti and Pshav-Khevsureti: Tadeos (Ioramashvili) * Metropolitan of Manglisi and Tsalka: Anania (Japaridze) * Metropolitan of Margveti and Ubisi: Vakhtang (Akhvledani) * Metropolitan of Tsilkani and Dusheti: Zosimas (Shioshvili) * Metropolitan of Tqibuli and Terjola: Giorgi (Shalamberidze) * Metropolitan of Urbnisi and Ruisi: Job (Akiashvili) * Metropolitan of Alaverdi: David (Makharadze) * Metropolitan of Nekresi: Sergios (Chekurishvili) * Metropolitan of Shemokmedi: Joseph (Kikvadze) * Metropolitan of Nikozi and Tskhinvali: Isaiah (Chanturia) * Metropolitan of Borjomi and Bakuriani: Seraphim (Jojua) * Metropolitan of Nikortsminda: Elise (Jokhadze) * Metropolitan of Poti and Khobi: Grigori (Berbichashvili) * Metropolitan of Akhalkalaki and Kumurdo: Nikoloz (Pachuashvili) * Metropolitan of Akhaltsikhe and Tao-Klarjeti: Theodore (Chuadze) * Metropolitan of Khoni and Samtredia: Saba (Gagiberiya) * Metropolitan of Batumi, Lazeti, North America and Canada: Dimitri (Shiolashvili) * Metropolitan of Vani and Baghdati: Anton (Buluhiya) * Metropolitan of Zugdidi and Tsaishi: Gerasimos (Sharashenidze) * Metropolitan of Samtavisi and Gori: Andria (Gvazava) * Metropolitan of Chkondidi and Martvili: Petre (Tsaava) * Metropolitan of Senaki, Chkhorotsqu and Australia: Shio (Mujiri) * Archbishop of Tsageri and Lentekhi: Stepan (Kalaidzhishvili) * Archbishop of Bodbe: David (Tikaradze) * Archbishop of Stepantsminda and Khevi: Iegudiel (Tabatadze) * Archbishop of Rustavi and Marneuli : Ioane (Gamrekeli) * Archbishop of Dmanisi, Agarak-Tashiri, Great Britain and Ireland: Zenon (Iaradzhuli) * Bishop of Mestia and Upper Svaneti: Ilarion (Kitiashvili) * Bishop of Gurjaani and Velistsikhe: Euthymos (Lezhava) * Bishop of Ninotsminda and Sagarejo: Luka (Lomidze) * Bishop of Skhalta: Spiridon (Abuladze) * Bishop of Bolnisi: Ephrem (Gamrekelidze) * Bishop of Dedoplistsqaro and Hereti: Melchisedek (Khachidze) * Bishop of Gardabani and Martqopi: Jacob (Iakobishvili) * Bishop of Surami and Khashuri: Svimeon (Tsakashvili) Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia The first head bishop of the Georgia Church to carry the title of Patriarch was Melkisedek I (1010‚Äì1033). Since 1977, Ilia II (born in 1933) has served as the Catholicos- Patriarch of All Georgia and Archbishop of Mtskheta and Tbilisi.

She was retained by William Randolph Hearst because she had championed Hearst's mistress Marion Davies and subsequently became an influential figure in Hollywood. At her peak, her columns were read by 20 million people in 700 newspapers worldwide. She remained the unchallenged ‚ÄúQueen of Hollywood gossip‚Äù until the arrival of the flamboyant Hedda Hopper, with whom she feuded for years. Early life Louella Parsons was born Louella Rose Oettinger in Freeport, Illinois, the daughter of Helen (Stine) and Joshua Oettinger. Her father was of German Jewish descent, as was her maternal grandfather, while her maternal grandmother, Jeanette Wilcox, was of Irish origin. During her childhood, her parents attended an Episcopal church. She had two brothers, Edwin and Fred, and a sister, Rae. In 1890, her widowed mother married John H. Edwards. They lived in Dixon, Illinois, hometown of Ronald Reagan. Parsons decided to become a writer or a reporter during high school. At her 1901 high school graduation, she gave a foretelling speech, entitled \\"Great Men\\", after which her principal announced that she would become a great writer. After high school, Parsons enrolled in a teacher's course at a local Dixon college. She received a financial contribution from a distant German relative. While still in college, Parsons obtained her first newspaper job as a part-time writer for the Dixon Star. In 1902, she became the first female journalist in Dixon, where she gossiped about Dixon social circles, making a step towards her Hollywood career. She and her first husband, John Parsons, moved to Burlington, Iowa. Her only child, Harriet (1906‚Äì1983), who grew up to become a film producer, was born there. While in Burlington, Parsons saw her first motion picture, The Great Train Robbery (1903). When her marriage broke up, Parsons moved to Chicago. In 1912, she had her first taste of the movie industry working for George K. Spoor as a scenario writer at the Essanay Company in Chicago, selling her first script for $25. Her daughter, Harriet, was billed as \\"Baby Parsons\\" in several movies, which included The Magic Wand (1912), written by Louella Parsons. She also wrote a book titled How to Write for the Movies. Career=Hearst Corporation In 1914, Parsons began writing the first movie gossip column in the United States for the Chicago Record Herald. William Randolph Hearst bought that newspaper in 1918 and Parsons was out of a job, as Hearst had not yet discovered that movies and movie personalities were news. Parsons then moved to New York City and started working for the New York Morning Telegraph writing a similar movie column, which attracted the attention of Hearst after he saw her interview of his mistress and prot√©g√© Marion Davies. Parsons had encouraged readers to \\"give this girl a chance\\" while the majority of critics disparaged Davies. Parsons showered the former chorus girl with praise which led to a friendship between the two women and led to an offer from Hearst in 1923 for her to become the $200-a-week motion- picture editor of his New York American. Her perpetual praise of Davies did not go unnoticed by others as well. The phrase ‚ÄúMarion never looked lovelier‚Äù became a standard in her column and a tongue-in-cheek cultural catchphrase. There was persistent speculation that Parsons was elevated to her position as the Hearst chain's lead gossip columnist because of a scandal she did not write about. In 1924, director Thomas Ince died after being carried off Hearst's yacht, allegedly to be hospitalized for indigestion. Many Hearst newspapers falsely claimed that Ince had not been aboard the boat at all and had fallen ill at the newspaper mogul's home. Charlie Chaplin's secretary reported seeing a bullet hole in Ince's head when he was removed from the yacht. Rumors proliferated that Chaplin was having an affair with Hearst's mistress Davies, and that an attempt to shoot Chaplin may have caused Ince's death. Allegedly, Parsons was also aboard the yacht that night but she ignored the story in her columns. The official cause of death was listed as heart failure.Fleming, E.J., The Fixers, McFarland & Co., 2005pg. 46-48 Syndication In 1925, Parsons contracted tuberculosis and was told she had six months to live. She spent a year in Palm Springs, California, which led to it being a popular resort for Hollywood movie stars. She moved to Arizona for the dry climate, then to Los Angeles, where she decided to stay. With the disease in remission, she went back to work, and Hearst suggested she become a syndicated Hollywood columnist for his newspapers. As she and the publishing mogul developed an ironclad relationship, her Los Angeles Examiner column came to appear in over seven hundred newspapers the world over, with a readership of more than 20 million, and Parsons gradually became one of the most powerful voices in the movie business with her daily allotment of gossip. Radio Program Beginning in 1928, she hosted a weekly radio program featuring movie star interviews that was sponsored by SunKist. A similar program in 1931 was sponsored by Charis Foundation Garment. In 1934, she signed a contract with the Campbell's Soup Company and began hosting a program titled Hollywood Hotel, which showcased stars in scenes from their upcoming movies. The stars appeared for free which did not please rival broadcasters or all of the stars but they did not complain in case of reprisals. Her opening line of the show was \\"My first exclusive of tonight is...\\", which became feared. The show was cancelled after the Screen Actors Guild demanded payment for its members. Warner Bros. paid her $50,000 to appear in a filmed version in 1937, but the film flopped. \\"First Lady of Hollywood\\" June Allyson reveals a secret to Louella (1946) Parsons saw herself as the social and moral arbiter of Hollywood and many feared her disfavor more than that of movie critics. Parsons had informants in studio corridors, hairdressers‚Äô salons, and lawyers‚Äô and doctors‚Äô offices. Her husband was a urologist and Hollywood physician, and it was thought that he passed on information he learnt in his position as a studio doctor. She worked from her Beverly Hills home with a staff consisting of a secretary, her assistant reviewer (Dorothy Manners, who worked with Parsons for thirty years), a \\"leg\\" man who gathered news and a female reporter who covered caf√©. She had three telephones in her office. She also had former silent stars on her payroll to help them financially. She considered the biggest scoop of her career to be the divorce of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and Mary Pickford, then the most famous couple in Hollywood. Parsons had learnt of the split from Pickford herself, who had made the mistake of counting on the columnist's discretion. Parsons sat on the story for six weeks hoping that they would reconcile and concerned that the news might damage the film industry, but published once she heard that the Los Angeles Times had also got the story. When she had received a tip that Clark Gable was divorcing his second wife Ria, Parsons essentially held Mrs. Gable hostage at her home until she was sure that her story was speeding across the wire ahead of any other service. Her unofficial title ‚ÄòQueen of Hollywood‚Äô was challenged in 1938 by newcomer Hedda Hopper, to whom she was initially friendly and helpful. However, they came to be fierce rivals. Parsons also appeared in many cameo spots in movies, including Without Reservations (1946), and Starlift (1951). Writing Style In contrast to her arch-rival Hedda Hopper, who was notorious for her column's crass tone, Parsons' writing style was often described as \\"sweetness and light\\" or \\"gooey\\". She received criticism for her casual chatty tone and casual regard for dates and places. She countered that \\"the best gossip\\" is informal and that the speed at which she needed to complete her daily column did not allow for much rewriting or polishing. She stated that she would rather get the word out than potentially disappoint her readers. She became known in Hollywood for assuming an air of goofy vagueness in order to snap up material without people suspecting she was listening or otherwise letting their guard down. Decline After the death of Hearst in 1951 and with the rise of stars becoming producers, Parsons's influence diminished. She began to show signs of physical deterioration and when the Los Angeles Examiner folded in 1962 her column was switched to the Hearst afternoon paper, the Los Angeles Herald-Express. This meant she lost an edge to Hopper's appearances in the morning Los Angeles Times. She continued her column until December 1965 when it was taken over by her assistant, Dorothy Manners, who had already been writing the column for more than a year. Feud with Hedda Hopper When Hopper had initially come to Hollywood, she and Parsons had a mutually beneficial arrangement. Hopper was then a moderately successful actress, and according to Parson's successor, Dorothy Manners, \\"if anything happened on a set‚Äîif a star and leading man were having an affair‚ÄîHedda would give Louella a call.‚Äù In return, Hedda was guaranteed a few lines of copy under Louella‚Äôs increasingly influential byline. After MGM canceled her contract, Hopper struggled to maintain her career as an actress. Luckily, she was offered a position as a Hollywood columnist by the Esquire Feature Syndicate due to a recommendation by Andy Hervey of MGM‚Äôs publicity department. One of the first papers to pick up ‚ÄúHedda Hopper‚Äôs Hollywood‚Äù was the Los Angeles Times, a morning paper like Louella‚Äôs Examiner. Hopper first publicly scooped Parsons with the divorce of the president‚Äôs son Jimmy Roosevelt (a Goldwyn employee), who was involved with a Mayo Clinic nurse, from his wife, Betsey. The story became front page news across the country. Citizen Kane When rumors began to surface that Orson Welles debut film Citizen Kane was inspired by Hearst's life, Parsons lunched with the director and believed his evasions and denials. Hopper arrived uninvited to an early screening of the film and wrote a scathing critique, calling it a \\"vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man\\". As a result, Hearst sent Parsons a letter complaining that he had learned about Citizen Kane from Hopper and not her. On the warpath, Parsons then demanded a private screening of the film and threatened RKO chief George Schaefer on Hearst's behalf, first with a lawsuit and then with a vague threat of consequences for everyone in Hollywood. On January 10, Parsons and two lawyers working for Hearst were given a private screening of the film. Horrified by what she saw, Louella rushed out of the studio screening room to cable Hearst, who telegraphed back the terse message \\"Stop Citizen Kane\\". Soon after, Parsons called Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released Kane. She also warned other studio heads that she would expose the private lives of people throughout the industry and reveal long-suppressed scandalous information. When Schaefer‚Äîwho had also been threatened by Hearst with legal action‚Äîannounced that Citizen Kane was scheduled to premiere in February 1941 at Radio City Music Hall, Parsons contacted the manager of Radio City Music Hall and advised him that exhibiting the film would result in a press blackout. The premiere was canceled. Other exhibitors were fearful of being sued by Hearst and refused to show the film. As a result, despite support from Hearst adversaries as Henry Luce, on release overall the film lost money. Parsons was by no means alone in her campaign against Citizen Kane but Welles never quite recovered his position in Hollywood afterward. Ingrid Bergman In the early 1950s, the Los Angeles Examiner ran on its front page, above Parsons‚Äôs byline: \\"Ingrid Bergman Baby Due in Three Months at Rome\\". Bergman had left her husband, neurologist Peter Lindstrom to live in Italy with director Roberto Rossellini but the news that she might be pregnant was met with some skepticism. Bergman was well-known for the angelic role of Sister Benedict in The Bells of St. Mary's. Hopper, who had been a public supporter of Bergman, had believed the actress' denial of the pregnancy, and printed a fervent repudiation of the rumor. However, Bergman was indeed pregnant and Hopper, enraged at being scooped, launched a PR campaign decrying Bergman for being pregnant out of wedlock and carrying a married man's child. Parsons had allegedly received the tip from Howard Hughes who was incensed at Bergman for being unable to shoot a film for him as promised. Reaction Reportedly, whereas Hopper was more inclined to see their much-publicized antagonism as funny and good for business, Parsons took it personally and saw Hopper as a rival in every possible way. Hopper also referred to Doc Martin as \\"that goddamn clap doctor\\", which infuriated Parsons. It has been suggested that Hopper was set up as a columnist by Louis B. Mayer (with the blessing of other studio chiefs) to offset Louella‚Äôs monopolistic power. Gossip columnist Liz Smith, stated that: \\"The studios created both of them. And they thought they could control both of them. But they became Frankenstein monsters escaped from the labs.\\" Hopper and Parsons had a combined readership of 75 million in a country of 160 million. Memoirs Parsons' memoirs, The Gay Illiterate (1944), published by Doubleday, Doran and Company, became a bestseller. That was followed by a second volume in 1961, Tell It to Louella, published by G.P. Putnam's Sons. In her personal histories, she expunged significant bits of her history in order to align her life with the Catholicism she began to practice in middle age. She alleged that her first husband died on a transport ship on the way home from World War I, leaving her a widow instead of a divorced single mother. Her second marriage to Jack McCaffrey and eventual divorce is omitted. Personal life Parsons was married three times. First, to real estate developer and broker John Dement Parsons, whom she married in 1905. From this union, they had one daughter named Harriet who was born on August 23, 1906, in Burlington City, Des Moines County, Iowa. Parsons divorced John in 1914. A year later, she married second husband John McCaffrey Jr. in 1915. The couple later divorced. Her third marriage was to Los Angeles surgeon Dr. Harry Martin (whom she called \\"Docky\\") in 1930; Martin served in the Army Medical Corps during World War I and World War II. His specialty was venereal diseases and he advanced to the post of Twentieth Century Fox‚Äôs chief medical officer. He was also known as a heavy drinker. They remained married until Martin's death on June 24, 1951.Dr. Martin is dead. Fox Film official. The New York Times. June 25, 1951 After Martin's death she dated songwriter Jimmy McHugh, a fellow Catholic who introduced her to many of the new teenage musical sensations of the time, including Elvis Presley. The couple were a fixture at parties, premieres, and such nightspots as Dino‚Äôs Lodge on Sunset Strip. Harriet would later follow her mother's passion for writing, and would find employment as a writer for a popular California magazine. She also became one of the few female producers in the Hollywood studio system although she still struggled in this role despite the influence of her powerful mother. Later years and death After her retirement, Parsons lived in a nursing home where she died of arteriosclerosis on December 9, 1972, at the age of 91. Her funeral mass was attended by individuals from the movie industry with whom she had maintained genuine friendships. A convert to Roman Catholicism, she was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. Parsons has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in Hollywood, one for motion pictures at 6418 Hollywood Boulevard and one for radio at 6300 Hollywood Boulevard. Cultural Legacy *Parsons was caricatured in Frank Tashlin's cartoon The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos (1937) as \\"Louella Possums\\". *On March 8, 1956, Parsons' life was presented in an episode of the television anthology series Climax!. Teresa Wright portrayed Parsons in the program. *Elizabeth Taylor portrayed Parsons in the TV film Malice in Wonderland (1985) opposite Jane Alexander as Hedda Hopper. * Brenda Blethyn portrayed Parsons in RKO 281 aka Citizen Welles, a 2000 motion picture about the making of Citizen Kane and the relation between Orson Welles, William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies. *Jennifer Tilly portrayed Parsons in the feature film The Cat's Meow (2001) which was inspired by the mysterious death of film mogul Thomas H.

Biography  Sylvan was born Francis Richard Routley in Levin, New Zealand, and his early work is cited with this surname. He studied at Victoria University College of the University of New Zealand (now Victoria University of Wellington), and then Princeton University, before taking positions successively at several Australian institutions, including the University of Sydney. From 1971 until his death in Bali, Indonesia, he was a fellow at the Research School of Social Sciences (RSSS) at the Australian National University in Canberra. Sylvan was married to the philosopher/environmentalist Val Routley (later, Val Plumwood), with whom he worked closely for twenty years before their separation in 1982.Hyde, Dominic (2014). Eco-Logical Lives. The Philosophical Lives of Richard Routley/Sylvan and Val Routley/Plumwood. Cambridge: White Horse Press. After his divorce from Plumwood, he married Louise Sylvan (n√©e Mirlin) in 1983 and adopted the last name Sylvan (an English word meaning \\"of the forest\\") to reflect his love of the forest and commitment to environmentalism.  Work in logic and metaphysics  Sylvan was instrumental in the development and study of relevance logic. In 1972, Sylvan (in a paper co-authored with Plumwood) proposed a semantics for certain relevant logics that had been developed by American philosophers Nuel Belnap and Alan Ross Anderson.Routley, R. and V. Routley (1972). \\"Semantics of First Degree Entailment\\", No√ªs, 3: 335‚Äì359. Together with Robert K. Meyer, Routley turned this into a semantics for a large number of logical systems. Their work in logic work helped make ANU a center for the study of non-classical logic in general. Routley's work had particular influence for Graham Priest, a well-known proponent of non- classical logic; Sylvan and Priest edited a well-regarded volume on the topic.Priest, G., Routley, R., and Norman, J. (eds.) (1989). Paraconsistent Logic: Essays on the Inconsistent, M√ºnchen: Philosophia Verlag. Priest in turn influenced Sylvan; they met in 1976 at the Australasian Association of Logic conference in Canberra at a time when Sylvan was doing novel work on dialetheism, the view that some contradictions are true.See Routley, Richard and Meyer, Robert K. (1976), \\"Dialectical Logic, Classical Logic and the Consistency of the World\\", Studies in Soviet Thought 16: 1‚Äì25. Not long after meeting Priest, then investigating a logic capable of handling such true contradictions, Sylvan also endorsed the view.Routley, Richard (1979), \\"Dialectical Logic, Semantics and Metamathematics\\", Erkenntnis 14: 301‚Äì331. Sylvan's studies ranged over a variety of topics in logic and the philosophy of logic. He wrote important papers on free logic, general modal logic,\\"Existence and identity in quantified modal logics,\\" Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic 10: 113‚Äì149 (1969) and natural deduction systems.\\"A simple natural deduction system,\\" Logique et Analyse 12: 129‚Äì152 (1969) However, much of his most important work in logic was dedicated to relevant logic, for which he authored numerous papers (both technical and expository). From early in his career (and for many years after), Sylvan defended a sophisticated Meinong- inspired ontology (which he called \\"noneism\\"), first presented in his 1966 paper, \\"Some Things Do Not Exist.\\"Routley, Richard (1966): \\"Some Things Do Not Exist\\". Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic 7, 251‚Äì276. After several more papers in the 1970s, the theory was given a book-length treatment in 1980, Exploring Meinong's Jungle and Beyond.Routley, Richard (1982). Exploring Meinong's Jungle and Beyond. Ridgeview Pub Co. The view‚Äîalso defended in recent years by PriestPriest, Graham (2005). Towards Non-Being. The Logic and Metaphysics of Intentionality. Oxford: Clarendon.‚Äîutilizes a modal theory including \\"impossible worlds\\" to deal with supposed objects, like the \\"round square.\\" Sylvan's formulation is logically consistent, and avoids certain paradoxes associated with Meinong's original ontology; although, like many Meinongian views, it faces criticism due to its presumed ontological implausibility.Maria Reicher, \\"Nonexistent Objects\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2006), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),Hyde, Dominic (2001), 'Richard (Routley) Sylvan: Writings on Logic and Metaphysics', History and Philosophy of Logic 22: 181‚Äì205.  Environmental ethics and politics  Outside of logic and metaphysics, Sylvan was a proponent of so-called deep environmental ethics in the study of environmental ethics (following shallow/deep distinction formulated by Arne N√¶ss). In his important 1973 paper \\"Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental, Ethic?\\",Routley, Richard (1973), \\"Is There a Need for a New, an Environmental, Ethic?\\", Proceedings of the XVth World Congress of Philosophy, Varna, 1: 205‚Äì10. Reprinted in Environmental Philosophy: from Animal Rights to Radical Ecology (ed. M. Zimmerman et al.), Prentice Hall: New Jersey, 1993, pp.12-21. he defended a then-unorthodox account of the intrinsic value of the non-human, natural world. For this he was sometimes considered a defender of deep ecology, but he was in fact very critical of much of the domain.Sylvan, Richard (1985), \\"A Critique of Deep Ecology\\", Discussion Papers in Environmental Philosophy #12, Department of Philosophy, Research School of the Social Sciences, Australian National University: Canberra, 60 pages.

Redelift and G. Woodgate (eds), The Sociology of the Environment, Edward Elgar: London, 1994.

It is a sub-district of the Tel Kaif District and is 45 km north of the city of Mosul. Sami Zubaida calls Alqosh \\"another Assyrian center\\" when stating that Colonel R. S. Stafford, the British Administrative Inspector for Mosul, said that, at the time of the Simele massacre, another massacre was planned for there.  Christianity  Rabban Hormizd Monastery The importance of Alqosh for the Church of the East arose from its proximity to the Rabban Hormizd Monastery, named after its seventh-century founder Rabban Hormizd (Rabban means \\"monk\\"), who is venerated as a saint in the churches descended from the Church of the East, erroneously called the Nestorian. The monastery, built on the mountain slope, was for the East Syrian Church of the East a centre of learning that stood against the neighbouring West Syrian (Syriac Orthodox Church) communities and monasteries. It was the burial place of the patriarchs of the Church of the East from the late fifteenth century and was their seat from the time of Shimun VI (1503-1538) until the end of the series of patriarchs known as the Eliya line.List_of_Patriarchs_of_the_Church_of_the_East#Patriarchal lines from the schism of 1552 until 1830 Isolated and cut off by snow from Alqosh in winter, it never became their permanent residence, and its line of patriarchs is commonly described as the Mosul line or as resident in Alqosh.F. Kristian Girling, \\"The Chaldean Catholic Church: A study in modern history, ecclesiology and church-state relations (2003‚Äì2013)\\" (Department of Theology, Heythrop College, University of London), p. 43 In the schism of 1552, the abbot of the monastery, Yohannan Sulaqa, was elected irregularly to the post of patriarch by several bishops who were dissatisfied with the restriction of patriarchal succession to members of a single family. By tradition, a patriarch could be ordained only by someone of archiepiscopal (metropolitan) rank, a rank to which only members of that one family were promoted. For that reason, Sulaqa travelled to Rome, where, presented as the new patriarch elect, he entered communion with the Catholic Church and was ordained by the Pope and recognized as patriarch. He and his successors (who eventually formally broke communion with Rome) took up residence further east. This schism gave rise to the Chaldean Catholic Church, in opposition to what historians call the traditionalist wing of the Church of the East, that which in 1976 officially adopted the name \\"Assyrian Church of the East\\". In the 17th and 18th centuries, the \\"legitimist\\" Alqosh patriarchal line from which Sulaqa broke away in 1552, drew closer to Rome, especially during the 58-year reign of Eliya XI/XII Denkha (1722‚àí1778), who sent several letters to Rome, some with professions of faith in line with Catholic teaching, but no formal papal recognition followed.Heleen L. Murre-Van Den Berg, \\"The Patriarchs of the Church of the East from the Fifteenth to Eighteenth Centuries\\" in Hugoye: Journal of Syriac Studies Volume 2 (1999 [2010), p. 247, However, it was a member of the family from whom the \\"legitimate\\" traditionalist patriarchs were chosen, Yohannan Hormizd (1760‚Äì1838) who, having considered himself a Catholic since 1778, was chosen as patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church in 1830.  Association with the Prophet Nahum  Supposed tomb of the Prophet Nahum Austen Henry Layard, who visited the area in 1847, reported that by \\"a very ancient tradition\\" the village contains the tomb of the prophet Nahum, whose Old Testament book begins with: \\"An oracle concerning Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.\\"Nahum 1:1 While Jerome located in Galilee the birthplace of Nahum, Layard considered not without weight the Alqosh tradition in spite of the lack of inscriptions or ancient remains. Iraqi Jews made pilgrimage to the site during Shavuot, and \\"He who has not made the pilgrimage to Nahum's tomb has not yet known real pleasure\\" was a common saying. When Jews were expelled from Iraq or voluntarily emigrated to Israel in 1948, the Jewish custodian entrusted the care of the building to a local Chaldean Catholic. A survey conducted in 2017 determined that the structure was in danger of collapse, and in the following year work began on stabilizing it. Destruction=Other attacks * The village was attacked and sacked by Timur (Tamerlane) in 1401 AD. * Alqosh was attacked in 1508 AD by Pasha of Baghdad Bar Yak (Murad Bey). *Soran Kurds attacked Alqosh, killing nearly 300 villagers in 1831. * Mosa Pasha, the governor of Amadiya, approached Alqosh and put fire to Rabban Hermizd Monastery in 1828 AD. * Mohammed Pasha (Mira Koor), the Kurdish prince of Rowanduz attacked Alqosh, killing over 600 of its inhabitants in 1832 AD. * Resoul Beck, Mira Koor's brother, repeated the attack in 1840 AD. *Rabban Hormizd Monastery was attacked by the Kurds, and 1000 manuscripts may have been destroyed. * In 2014, the terrorists associated with the radical Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) came close to Alqosh. Almost all of the people fled Alqosh; however, many men and youths did not leave Alqosh due to a desire to protect their town. ISIL failed to take the town after protection from the Assyrian militia, Alqoshians and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. Old farming methods in Alqosh Demographics Party in Alqosh The town of Alqosh is primarily home to members of the Chaldean Catholic Church but has a smaller number of Yazidi inhabitants. In 1913, the town of Alqosh, was according to Joseph Tfinkdji inhabited by 7,000 Chaldean Catholics.Joseph Tfinkdji, \\"L'√âglise Chald√©enne Catholique autrefois et aujourd'hui\\", in Annuaire Pontifical Catholique 17 (1914). pp. 449-525. Many have emigrated since the 1970s. It is estimated that at least 40,000 \\"Alqushnaye\\" immigrants and their 2nd and 3rd generation descendants now live in the cities of Detroit, Michigan, the western suburb of Fairfield in Sydney, Australia and San Diego, California. In February 2010, the attacks against Assyrians in Mosul forced 4,300 Assyrians to flee from Mosul to the Nineveh plains where there is an Assyrian majority population. A report by the United Nations stated that 504 Assyrians at once migrated to Alqosh. Many Assyrians from Mosul and Baghdad since the post-2003 Iraq war have fled to Alqosh for safety. The town's population in 2020 is estimated to be roughly 4,600. In 2014 the mayor of Aqlosh, Faiz Jahwareh, was illegally detained and replaced by KDP member Lara Zara, only to be reinstated after protests by Alqosh residents. Jahwareh was again detained and replaced by the KRG in July 2017 on the basis of false corruption charges that were dismissed by the Iraqi Federal Court. Basim Bello, mayor of nearby Tel Keppe, was also unlawfully removed by the same parties in August 2017, and reinstated by order of the Governor of Nineveh in August 2018. Climate Alqosh has a semi-arid climate (BSh) with extremely hot and dry summers, and cool wet winters. \`  Natives of Alqosh  * Yohannan Hormizd (1760‚Äì1838), Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church 1830‚Äì1838 * Joseph VI Audo (1790‚Äì1878), Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church 1847‚Äì1878 * Toma Audo (1854‚Äì1918), Archbishop of Urmia * Yousef VI Emmanuel II Thomas (1852‚Äì1947), Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church 1900‚Äì1947 * Paul II Cheikho (1906‚Äì1989), Patriarch of the Chaldean Catholic Church 1958‚Äì1989 * Hirmis Aboona (1940‚Äì2009), historian * Emil Shimoun Nona (1967‚Äì ), Archbishop of Mosul 2009‚Äì2015, Eparch of Chaldean Catholic Eparchy of Saint Thomas the Apostle of Sydney 2015‚Äì  See also  *Assyrian homeland *Disputed territories of Northern Iraq *Proposals for Assyrian autonomy in Iraq *Rabban Hormizd Monastery ReferencesSources * * Addai Scher, Notice sur les manuscrits syriaques conserv√©s dans la biblioth√®que du couvent des Chald√©ens de Notre-Dame-des-Semences, Journal Asiatique S√©r. 10: 8, 9 (1906).

In some styles of game, the murderer may be aware that they are the killer and in other games the murderer discovers this along with the other participants. Murder mystery games may involve the actual 'murders' of guests throughout the game, or may open with a 'death' and have the rest of the time devoted to investigation. Murder mystery games may also refer to public performances in venues for events, team building or corporate entertainment, where the suspects are played by actors, and the role of detectives falls to the other guests. Dinner party murder mystery games are generally played with small groups of individuals, e.g. 6-20. Murder mystery events for larger groups are usually run for numbers between 20 and 250 attendees, though events can be run with 400+ in attendance. Origin The murder mystery fiction genre began in the first half of the nineteenth century. The party game wink murder dates back to at least the early twentieth century, and sees one player secretly selected as a murderer, being able to \\"kill\\" other players by winking at them. A killed player must count to five before dying, and the murderer tries to avoid detection. 1935 saw the release of the first murder mystery game known as Jury Box. In this game, the players or jurors are given the scenario of the murder, the evidence presented by the prosecutor and defendant, two photographs of the crime scene and ballot papers. Jurors have to make the decision as to who is guilty and then a real solution is read out. Cluedo, or Clue in North America, was the first murder mystery board game, where players race to identify a killer. It was released some time later in 1948, and has continued to be popular. The earliest mention of role playing murder mystery games in their present \\"How to Host\\" boxed format is in the 1980s when they were thought to be a bit of a one-year wonder in the game shops. Back then the scenarios were simple, the acting directions minimal, and the games relied on the guests being comfortable ad-libbing responses to each other's questions. In 1986, Dimitry Davidoff created Mafia, a new version of the murder mystery game that was simpler and most likely the precursor for what we refer to as interactive murder mystery games now. Today, there are many online companies who offer both instant download versions of games and boxed versions. Gameplay= Dinner party games  Murder mystery games for dinner parties in their current incarnation are often structured so that each guest is equally involved. Murder Mystery Dinner Party Game Kits can take the form of scripted games or interactive games. Your preference will be driven on how you want your party to progress. Do you see you and a few friends sitting around a table playing a game? Then a scripted game will be your choice. If you want your party to play like a normal party with people mingling and moving around, then interactive games that use clues rather than scripts will be the one you want. A newspaper article prop for a live action murder mystery game In scripted murder mystery games, the participants are told exactly what to say and when. They are often provided with introductory statements, questions to ask, answers to give and occasionally some shared dialogue to break the ice. Character information often comes in booklets which are read from throughout the course of the evening, usually around a table in rounds with the sole purpose being to solve the murder. These were popular in the '90s with the How To Host Box Games. There is no room for ad libbing in scripted games. You may act out as your character, but interactions are restricted to the information provided in the game. In interactive murder mystery games the guests are provided with character backgrounds and confidential information. Unlike scripted games, there are many sub-plots and the goal isn't just to solve the murder. A dinner normally takes place during the party, but the guests are not restricted to sitting around a table and can move around, talking to who they want, when they want. They are given license to interrogate or perform actions or activities with the other guests which will help them solve the case or accomplish their own characters goals. Interactive games do allow for ad libbing and allow a person to take their character in the direction they want to go. Some games will allow the murderer to know upfront that they are the killer, and others will keep it a secret until the rest of the group is told during a solution round. The games for 6 to 20+ players are usually played over 2‚Äì3 hours and the players use their character booklets and clues (i.e., the game contents) to delve into the background of the murder using the questions, answers, hints, evidence and clues provided. These are all designed to elicit more and more information about the murder, until the players are in a good position to suggest who they believe the guilty party is. More often than not, players will be invited (by the host) to attend the party dressed as, and ready to play the part of, one of the suspects listed in the game scenario. The scripted game is usually played over a 3 course dinner party, whereas an interactive game can be played as a mix and mingle style format with finger foods, buffet or a sit down dinner. Boxed or downloadable games are designed to be played by groups of friends, family or co-workers, who are seeking to enjoy a fancy dress style party with an additional 'theme'. Interactive games are also used in team building environments. Companies and Church groups have found them to be a good resource for fostering good communication skills and building closer relationships among individuals. The setup of these games can be simple or elaborate. Some games require no setup beyond a way to randomly select the roles; however, some party hosts like to develop an elaborate menu and decorate extensively to match the theme of their chosen game. As well as providing the food and drink for the evening, the party host is required to follow the hosts instructions, prepare for the party in advance, and generally coordinate proceedings during the evening. Organizers of the mystery can assign roles and characters based on their knowledge of the guests.  Large group murder mystery game  As not everyone can take a role in a large group game, the suspect roles are usually given to actors, who learn scripts or just ad lib a performance which will gradually reveal who the murderer is to the other guests. The actors are fully \\"in the know\\" about all aspects of the case. The remaining guests will take on the role of detective and it will be their \\"job\\" to actively solve the case by examining evidence, finding clues, following and questioning suspects ‚Äì whatever it takes for them to solve the mystery. Large group events can be run in several ways including: * In a single room with a staged theatrical performance, * With actors acting \\"in the round\\" amongst the guests, * In multiple rooms with clues scattered throughout the venue and suspects in different areas. * As more traditional card games with clue cards given to the guests with chunks of information on each one. * In video format with evidence being presented to teams after watching suspect videos. * In a combination of script and clue evidence. Large group games are often played in a hired venue, a restaurant, a hotel, or at a workplace. They are often used for fundraisers, team building and corporate events. (*Live versions of murder mystery shows, in which guests attend commercial venues such as hotels as paying viewers, are sometimes classed as dinner theater or mystery dinners, not Murder Mystery Games.) However, there are interactive games that were created for large groups up to 200+ guests. Typically, these events are hosted like the other format of interactive games, but some characters in the game are expanded into teams to allow for everyone in the group to have a role.4 Versions Murder mystery games come in several different versions: * Scripted or turn-based games work by releasing information over the course of the game. As the game progresses, each character learns something new about the plot and their involvement. Each turn players are prompted to ask specific questions, or perhaps read from a script. These are popularly played around the table at a dinner party. * Interactive murder mystery games provide players with details of their character from the start, but it is up to the character to determine how they solve the murder. Often players have other objectives ‚Äì such as to be the richest player at the end of the game. Most people will have their own secrets that have nothing to do with the murder. This provides even more reasons for players to interact with each other. These games are better suited to buffets or finger food as generally everyone needs to be able to mingle and also to talk to others without being overheard. Some are done during a sit down dinner as long as time is provided afterwards for guests to move about and mingle. * Video based or on-line interactive mystery games will use video to provide the back story to the crime and may provide witness testimonials or show evidence to allow guests to solve the case in a more \\"game\\" style format. These are often played individually on the internet, but sometimes are played in larger groups for team building. * Murder mysteries can be played on internet forums, the organizer privately notifies the murderer to let them know and they must try to blame someone else on the thread. At the end of a round, the organizer reveals the murderer. * Variants may involve changing the nature of the crime (especially if younger players are involved), allowing some participants to know certain facts in advance (even the identity of the murderer), or having 'plot twists' of unexpected events to occur, to help or hinder the investigation, as needed. Games may contain scavenger hunts, puzzles and problems to solve.

It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin 2C-E in PiHKAL and documented in his book PiHKAL. Like the other substances in its family, it produces sensory and cognitive effects in its physical reactions with living organisms. It is also a powerful vasoconstrictor at high doses. Properties Mass Spectrometer Analysis: 2C-E 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine is a colorless oil. Crystalline forms are obtained as the amine salt by reacting the free base with a mineral acid, typically hydrochloric acid (HCl). Shulgin does not report an exact boiling point for the free base, stating only that during one synthesis the fraction boiling between 90 and 100 ¬∞C at 0.25 mmHg pressure was collected and converted to the hydrochloride salt. Shulgin reports the melting point of the hydrochloride salt as 208.5‚Äì210.5 ¬∞C. Effects 20 mg Capsules of 2C-E 2C-E Pile According to Shulgin, the duration of 2C-E's effects is generally between six and ten hours for an average dose, with the plateau lasting between three and six hours. 2C-E's effects are often described as \\"neutral\\", in comparison with other psychedelic chemicals and even other 2C-x related molecules.

My first experience with 2C-E was really profound, and it is the substance of a chapter within the story. Several people have said, about 2C-E, \\"I don't think I like it, since it isn't that much fun. But I intend to explore it again.\\" There is something here that will reward the experimenter. Someday, the full character of 2C-E will be understood, but for the moment, let it rest as being a difficult and worth- while material. A very much worth-while material.\\" Adverse effects Adverse effects include tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, delirium, and hallucinations. At least two deaths have been attributed to a 2C-E overdose. Drug prohibition laws=Australia In Queensland, 2C-E was added to the 'Dangerous Drugs' list of the 'Drugs Misuse Act 1986' by the 'Drugs Misuse Amendment Act 2008'. Making it illegal to produce, supply or possess. Canada As of October 31, 2016, 2C-E is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada. China As of October 2015, 2C-E is a controlled substance in China. Denmark 2C-E is added to the list of Schedule B controlled substances. Germany 2C-E is an Anlage I controlled drug. New Zealand New Zealand has a catch-all Analogues section in Schedule 3 / Class C of their drug laws that would make 2C-I, 2C-E, DOI, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine Schedule 3 compounds in New Zealand.  Portugal  Portugal has decriminalized possession of all recreational drugs in quantities no more than a ten-day supply of that substance. However production and distribution (buying/selling) are a criminal offense. Sweden Sveriges riksdags health ministry classified 2C-E as \\"health hazard\\" under the act (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Oct 1, 2004, in their regulation SFS 2004:696 listed as 2,5-dimetoxi-4-etylfenetylamin (2C-E), making it illegal to sell or possess. UK In the United Kingdom, 2C-E is a Class A controlled substance. The UK has the strictest laws in the EU on designer drugs. The Misuse Of Drugs Act was amended in 2002 to include a \\"catch most\\" clause outlawing every drug, and possible future drug, from the LSD (ergoline) and MDMA (phenethylamine) chemical families (including 2C-E). The amendment is a near verbatim quote from the books of the American biochemist Alexander Shulgin, who obtained a PhD from the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Shulgin, a former research chemist at the Dow Chemical Company, re-discovered the synthesis for MDMA in 1976 and published the syntheses for more than 200 phenethylamine compounds of his own invention, and 55 tryptamine compounds many of which were also his own invention. The Shulgins were motivated to release the synthesis information as a way to protect the public's access to information about psychedelic compounds, a goal Alexander Shulgin has noted many times. United States As of July 9, 2012, in the United States 2C-E is a Schedule I substance under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, making possession, distribution and manufacture illegal.

Due to the destruction of prairie, the populations of Franklin's ground squirrel have dwindled, approaching levels of concern. Its decline in the eastern portion of its range is mostly attributed to habitat fragmentation. Taxonomy Franklin's ground squirrel was first described by Joseph Sabine in 1822, who named it in honor of the British Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin. It was formerly placed in the large ground squirrel genus Spermophilus, in its own subgenus, Poliocitellus, but since DNA sequencing of the cytochrome b gene has shown Spermophilus to be paraphyletic it is now placed in its own genus. Franklin's ground squirrel is suggested to be sister to a clade containing not only the Mohave, round-tailed, spotted, and Perote ground squirrels (genus Xerospermophilus), but the prairie dogs as well. There are no commonly recognized subspecies. Description Lincoln, Nebraska Franklin's ground squirrel is a typically sized squirrel, with adults measuring from in total length, including the tail. Males weigh about in the spring, and up to in the fall. In comparison, females are significantly lighter, and put on proportionally less weight through the year, being about in the spring, and up to in the fall. The fur is brownish grey marked with both light and dark speckles, and fades to yellowish white on the animal's underside. The tail is darker, almost blackish in color, while the head is a relatively solid grey. In many respects, Franklin's squirrel closely resembles the common eastern grey squirrel. However, it has a shorter, less bushy tail, shorter ears, longer claws, and a patch of slightly yellowish fur on the rump, which the eastern grey lacks. Other local squirrels with which it might be confused include Richardson's ground squirrel, which is more built, and has a longer tail, and the Columbian ground squirrel, which has noticeably reddish fur. The squirrel has a number of scent glands. There are small glands at the corners of the mouth, which appear to be used when greeting other members of the same species, and a number of glands running from the shoulders down to the pelvis, which may be used to mark burrows. The largest glands, however, are the three anal glands, one above the anus, and one either side. These produce a musky scent during the mating season, and are found in both sexes. Distribution and habitat Franklin's ground squirrel is found from central Alberta to southern Manitoba in Canada, and in the United States from North Dakota and Minnesota as far south as northern Kansas to northwestern Indiana. Within this region, it inhabits tallgrass prairies where there is dense vegetation cover, often along the boundaries of woodland or marsh. Range map Biology Franklin's ground squirrel is omnivorous, feeding mainly on vegetation in the spring and late summer, but with meat and eggs forming a significant proportion of their diet in the early summer. In the spring, they feed on roots, new shoots, and grasses, shifting to leaves and flowers, and then to fruit and seeds as the year progresses. Plants eaten include dandelion, stinging nettle, red-berried elder, white clover, and wild peas, as well as garden vegetables. Animal material consumed ranges from insects to eggs, small rodents, fish and frogs, up to rabbits and even fully-grown mallards. The squirrel hibernates from about August to April, although this varies between individuals. Males typically enter hibernation earlier than females, and adults earlier than young-of-the-year, which need more time to build up fat reserves. Badgers are the main predators of Franklin's ground squirrels, although they are also eaten by coyotes, foxes, weasels, hawks, and snakes. The mating season begins as soon as the squirrels emerge from their burrows in the spring, and continues until June, during which time pairs may often share a burrow. Gestation lasts 28 days. Litters may be of anything from two to thirteen pups, with eight being average. The young are born naked and blind, with their eyes only opening after 18 to 20 days. They are weaned by 30 days of age. Females do not become sexually mature until their second year, but can live for four to five years, while males typically do not survive beyond the age of two. Behavior Franklin's ground squirrel is diurnal, spending the night in burrows, typically built on steep slopes. The burrows are about in diameter, and extend on average below ground. They consist of a single nesting chamber lined with dried plant matter, and a number of side tunnels leading to food storage areas and latrines. Burrows typically have two or three entrances. Each burrow is home to only one or two squirrels during the spring and summer, when the animals are generally antisocial. In North Dakota, males have an average home range of and females , although the home ranges of individual squirrels do overlap, and population densities can range from . In the winter, several individuals can share the same burrow.

Described as a symphony when published, it comprises six songs for two singers who alternate movements. Mahler specified that the two singers should be a tenor and an alto, or else a tenor and a baritone if an alto is not available.Das Lied von der Erde ‚Äì Eine Symphonie f√ºr eine Tenor- und eine Alt- (oder Bariton-) Stimme und Orchester (nach Hans Bethges Die chinesische Fl√∂te) von Gustav Mahler, Partitur, [The Song of the Earth. A Symphony for tenor and alto (or baritone) voice and orchestra (after Hans Bethge's The Chinese Flute). By Gustav Mahler. Score. Published by Universal Edition 1912. Mahler composed this work following the most painful period in his life, and the songs address themes such as those of living, parting and salvation. On the centenary of Mahler's birth, the composer and prominent Mahler conductor Leonard Bernstein described Das Lied von der Erde as Mahler's \\"greatest symphony\\".New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts. Original broadcast 7 February 1960, \\"Who is Gustav Mahler?\\"  History  Three disasters befell Mahler during the summer of 1907. Political maneuvering and antisemitism forced him to resign as Director of the Vienna Court Opera, his eldest daughter Maria died from scarlet fever and diphtheria, and Mahler himself was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. \\"With one stroke,\\" he wrote to his friend Bruno Walter, \\"I have lost everything I have gained in terms of who I thought I was, and have to learn my first steps again like a newborn\\".Richard Freed, programme note The same year saw the publication of Hans Bethge's Die chinesische Fl√∂te, a volume of ancient Chinese poetry rendered into German. Mahler was captivated by the vision of earthly beauty and transience expressed in these verses and chose seven of the poems to set to music as Das Lied von der Erde. Mahler completed the work in 1909. Mahler was aware of the so-called \\"curse of the ninth\\",M. Kennedy, The Dent Master Musicians: Mahler (J. M. Dent, London, 1974 and 1990), p. 156. a superstition arising from the fact that no major composer since Beethoven had successfully completed more than nine symphonies: he had already written eight symphonies before composing Das Lied von der Erde. Fearing his subsequent demise, he decided to subtitle the work A Symphony for Tenor, Alto (or Baritone) Voice and Orchestra, rather than numbering it as a symphony. His next symphony, written for purely instrumental forces, was numbered his Ninth. That was indeed the last symphony he fully completed, because only two movements of the Tenth had been fully orchestrated at the time of his death.  Premieres  The first public performance was given, posthumously, on 20 November 1911 in the Tonhalle in Munich, sung by Sara Cahier and William Miller (both Americans) with Bruno Walter conducting. Mahler had died six months earlier, on 18 May. One of the earliest performances in London (possibly the first) occurred in January 1913 at the Queen's Hall under conductor Henry Wood, where it was sung by Gervase Elwes and Doris Woodall. Wood reportedly thought that the work was 'excessively modern but very beautiful'.H.J. Wood, My Life of Music (Gollancz, London 1946 edn), 287.  Text  Mahler's source for the text was Hans Bethge's Die chinesische Fl√∂te. Bethge used prior translations and adaptations of the original Chinese poetry.Hans Bethge. Die chinesische Fl√∂te.

These attributions have been a matter of some uncertainty, and around the turn of the 21st century, Chinese scholars extensively debated the sources of the songs following a performance of the work in China in 1998.A summary of the interpretations of Tang poem origins of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde (in Chinese:ÂÖ≥‰∫éÈ©¨Âãí„ÄäÂ§ßÂú∞‰πãÊ≠å„ÄãÂîêËØóÊ≠åËØç‰πãËß£ËØëÁ†îÁ©∂ÁöÑÁªºËø∞) According to the musicologist Theodor W. Adorno, Mahler found in Chinese poetry what he had formerly sought after in the genre of German folk song: a mask or costume for the sense of rootlessness or \\"otherness\\" attending his identity as a Jew. This theme, and its influence upon Mahler's tonality, has been further explored by John Sheinbaum.John J. Sheinbaum, 'Adorno's Mahler and the Timbral Outsider', Journal of the Royal Musical Association, 2006, Vol. 131 no. 1, pp. 38-82. It has also been asserted that Mahler found in these poems an echo of his own increasing awareness of mortality.M. Kennedy, The Dent Master Musicians: Mahler (Dent, London 1974 and 1990), p. 155. 'It voices the aching regret of a man who must soon leave the world', (Blom 1937, p. 4). The Universal Edition score of 1912 for Das Lied von der Erde shows Mahler's adapted text as follows. 1. \\"Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde\\" (\\"The Drinking Song of Earth's Sorrow\\") Schon winkt der Wein im gold'nen Pokale, Doch trinkt noch nicht, erst sing' ich euch ein Lied! Das Lied vom Kummer Soll auflachend in die Seele euch klingen. Wenn der Kummer naht, Liegen w√ºst die G√§rten der Seele, Welkt hin und stirbt die Freude, der Gesang. Dunkel ist das Leben, ist der Tod. Herr dieses Hauses! Dein Keller birgt die F√ºlle des goldenen Weins! Hier, diese Laute nenn' ich mein! Die Laute schlagen und die Gl√§ser leeren, Das sind die Dinge, die zusammen passen. Ein voller Becher Weins zur rechten Zeit Ist mehr wert, als alle Reiche dieser Erde! Dunkel ist das Leben, ist der Tod! Das Firmament blaut ewig und die Erde Wird lange fest steh'n und aufbl√ºh'n im Lenz. Du aber, Mensch, wie lang lebst denn du? Nicht hundert Jahre darfst du dich erg√∂tzen An all dem morschen Tande dieser Erde! Seht dort hinab! Im Mondschein auf den Gr√§bern Hockt eine wild-gespenstische Gestalt ‚Äì Ein Aff' ist's! H√∂rt ihr, wie sein Heulen Hinausgellt in den s√º√üen Duft des Lebens! Jetzt nehmt den Wein! Jetzt ist es Zeit, Genossen! Leert eure gold'nen Becher zu Grund! Dunkel ist das Leben, ist der Tod! The wine beckons in golden goblets but drink not yet; first I'll sing you a song. The song of sorrow shall ring laughingly in your soul. When the sorrow comes, blasted lie the gardens of the soul, wither and perish joy and singing. Dark is life, dark is death! Master of this house, your cellar is full of golden wine! Here, this lute I call mine. The lute to strike and the glasses to drain, these things go well together. A full goblet of wine at the right time is worth more than all the kingdoms of this earth. Dark is life, dark is death! The heavens are ever blue and the Earth shall stand sure, and blossom in the spring. But you O man, what long life have you? Not a hundred years may you delight in all the rotten baubles of this earth. See down there! In the moonlight, on the graves squats a wild ghostly shape; an ape it is! Hear you his howl go out in the sweet fragrance of life. Now! Drink the wine! Now it is time comrades. Drain your golden goblets to the last. Dark is life, dark is death!

In alle T√§ler steigt der Abend nieder Mit seinen Schatten, die voll K√ºhlung sind. O sieh! Wie eine Silberbarke schwebt Der Mond am blauen Himmelssee herauf. Ich sp√ºre eines feinen Windes Weh'n Hinter den dunklen Fichten! Der Bach singt voller Wohllaut durch das Dunkel. Die Blumen blassen im D√§mmerschein. Die Erde atmet voll von Ruh' und Schlaf. Alle Sehnsucht will nun tr√§umen, Die m√ºden Menschen geh'n heimw√§rts, Um im Schlaf vergess'nes Gl√ºck Und Jugend neu zu lernen! Die V√∂gel hocken still in ihren Zweigen. Die Welt schl√§ft ein! Es wehet k√ºhl im Schatten meiner Fichten. Ich stehe hier und harre meines Freundes; Ich harre sein zum letzten Lebewohl. Ich sehne mich, o Freund, an deiner Seite Die Sch√∂nheit dieses Abends zu genie√üen. Wo bleibst du? Du l√§√üt mich lang allein! Ich wandle auf und nieder mit meiner Laute Auf Wegen, die von weichem Grase schwellen. O Sch√∂nheit! O ewigen Liebens ‚Äì Lebens ‚Äì trunk'ne Welt! Er stieg vom Pferd und reichte ihm den Trunk Des Abschieds dar. Er fragte ihn, wohin er f√ºhre Und auch warum es m√º√üte sein. Er sprach, seine Stimme war umflort. Du, mein Freund, Mir war auf dieser Welt das Gl√ºck nicht hold! Wohin ich geh'? Ich geh', ich wand're in die Berge. Ich suche Ruhe f√ºr mein einsam Herz. Ich wandle nach der Heimat, meiner St√§tte. Ich werde niemals in die Ferne schweifen. Still ist mein Herz und harret seiner Stunde! Die liebe Erde all√ºberall Bl√ºht auf im Lenz und gr√ºnt aufs neu! All√ºberall und ewig blauen licht die Fernen! Ewig... ewig... The sun departs behind the mountains. In all the valleys the evening descends with its shadow, full cooling. O look! Like a silver boat sails the moon in the watery blue heaven. I sense the fine breeze stirring behind the dark pines. The brook sings out clear through the darkness. The flowers pale in the twilight. The earth breathes, in full rest and sleep. All longing now becomes a dream. Weary men traipse homeward to sleep; forgotten happiness and youth to rediscover. The birds roost silent in their branches. The world falls asleep. It blows coolly in the shadows of my pines. I stand here and wait for my friend; I wait to bid him a last farewell. I yearn, my friend, at your side to enjoy the beauty of this evening. Where are you? You leave me long alone! I walk up and down with my lute on paths swelling with soft grass. O beauty! O eternal loving-and- life-bedrunken world! He dismounted and handed him the drink of farewell. He asked him where he would go and why must it be. He spoke, his voice was quiet. Ah my friend, Fortune was not kind to me in this world! Where do I go? I go, I wander in the mountains. I seek peace for my lonely heart. I wander homeward, to my abode! I'll never wander far. Still is my heart, awaiting its hour. The dear earth everywhere blossoms in spring and grows green anew! Everywhere and forever blue is the horizon! Forever ... Forever ...  Instrumentation  Mahler had already included movements for voice and orchestra in his Second, Third, Fourth and Eighth Symphonies. However, Das Lied von der Erde is the first complete integration of song cycle form with that of the symphony. The form was afterwards imitated by other composers, notably by Shostakovich and Zemlinsky. This new form has been termed a \\"song-symphony\\",M. Kennedy and J. Bourne Kennedy (Eds.), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music (Oxford University Press, London 2007). a hybrid of the two forms that had occupied most of Mahler's creative life. Das Lied von der Erde is scored for a large orchestra, consisting of the following: ;Woodwinds :piccolo :3 flutes (3rd doubling 2nd piccolo) :3 oboes (3rd doubling cor anglais) :3 B clarinets :E clarinet :bass clarinet :3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon) ;Brass :4 horns :3 trumpets :3 trombones :tuba ;Percussion :4 timpani (used only in \\"Von der Sch√∂nheit\\") :bass drum :snare drum :cymbals :triangle :tambourine (used only in \\"Von der Sch√∂nheit\\") :tam-tam (used only in \\"Der Abschied\\") :glockenspiel ;Keyboards :celesta (used only in \\"Der Abschied\\") ;Voices :alto solo :tenor solo ;Strings :mandolin :2 harps :1st violins :2nd violins :violas :cellos :double basses (with low C string) Only in the first, fourth and sixth songs does the full orchestra play together. The celesta is only heard at the end of the finale, and only the first movement requires all three trumpets, with two playing in the fourth movement and none playing in the sixth. In many places the texture resembles chamber music, with only a few instruments being used at one time. Mahler's habit was to subject the orchestration of every new orchestral work to detailed revision over several years. Though the musical material itself was hardly ever changed, the complex instrumental 'clothing' would be altered and refined in the light of experience gained in performance. In the case of Das Lied von der Erde, however, this process could not occur as the work's publication and first performance occurred posthumously. The score calls for tenor and alto soloists. However, Mahler includes the note that \\"if necessary, the alto part may be sung by a baritone\\". For the first few decades after the work's premiere, this option was little used. On one occasion Bruno Walter tried it out and engaged Friedrich Weidemann, the baritone who had premiered Kindertotenlieder under Mahler's own baton in 1905. However, Walter felt that tenor and baritone did not work as well as tenor and alto, and he never repeated the experiment.Audiophile Audition Following the pioneering recordings of the work by baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau under conductors Paul Kletzki and Leonard Bernstein, the use of baritones in this work has increased.  Arrangements  Arnold Schoenberg began to arrange Das Lied von der Erde for chamber orchestra, reducing the orchestral forces to string and wind quintets, and calling for piano, celesta and harmonium to supplement the harmonic texture. Three percussionists are also employed. Schoenberg never finished this project, but the arrangement was completed by Rainer Riehn in 1980. In 2004, the Octavian Society commissioned Glen Cortese to create two reductions of the work, one for a chamber ensemble of twenty instruments and one for a small orchestra with woodwinds and brass in pairs. Both these reductions are published in critical editions by Universal in Vienna. In 2020, a new arrangement for two soloists and a 15-piece chamber ensemble by Reinbert de Leeuw was recorded by the Belgian group Het Collectief with Lucile Richardot and Yves Saelens. Mahler also arranged the work for piano accompaniment, and this has been recorded by Cyprien Katsaris with Thomas Moser and Brigitte Fassbaender. Katsaris has also performed this version in concert.  Movements =1. \\"Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde\\" The first movement, \\"The Drinking Song of Earth's Misery\\" (in A minor), continually returns to the refrain, Dunkel ist das Leben, ist der Tod (literally, \\"Dark is life, is death\\"), which is pitched a semitone higher on each successive appearance. : \\\\relative c { \\\\set melismaBusyProperties = #'() \\\\clef treble \\\\key a \\\\minor \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"lead 6 (voice)\\" g'2.(  d  bes  g  ees'  d)  bes  a  g } \\\\addlyrics { Dun -- kel ist das Le -- ben, ist der Tod. } \\\\midi{\\\\tempo 4 = 180} Like many drinking poems by Li Bai, the original poem \\"Bei Ge Xing\\" (a pathetic song) () mixes drunken exaltation with a deep sadness. The singer's part is notoriously demanding, since the tenor has to struggle at the top of his range against the power of the full orchestra. This gives the voice its shrill, piercing quality, and is consistent with Mahler's practice of pushing instruments, including vocal cords, to their limits. According to musicologist Theodor W. Adorno, the tenor should here create the impression of a \\"denatured voice in the Chinese (falsetto) style\\". : \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key a \\\\minor \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"french horn\\" \\\\partial 8*1 e8\\\\ff  a2.  e4. d8 e a  e2. } \\\\midi{\\\\tempo 4 = 180} The movement begins with a three- note horn call which recurs throughout the song, most notably at the climax in which the singer describes an ape calling \\"into the sweet fragrance of life.\\" The climax also marks the first of the three whole-tone passages that occur in the symphony. 2. \\"Der Einsame im Herbst\\" : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\set Staff.instrumentName = #\\"Ob.\\" \\\\clef treble \\\\key d \\\\minor \\\\time 3/2 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"oboe\\" R1.

Marked 'somewhat dragging and exhausted', it begins with a repetitive shuffling in the strings, followed by solo wind instruments. The lyrics, which are based on the first part of a Tang Dynasty era poem by Qian Qi, lament the dying of flowers and the passing of beauty, as well as expressing an exhausted longing for sleep. The orchestration in this movement is sparse and chamber music-like, with long and independent contrapuntal lines. 3. \\"Von der Jugend\\" : \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"flute\\" f8(\\\\p g bes c d f d c  bes g f g d4) } \\\\midi{\\\\tempo 4 = 190} The third movement, \\"Of Youth\\" (for tenor, in B major), is the most obviously pentatonic and faux-Asian. The form is ternary, the third part being a greatly abbreviated revision of the first. It is also the shortest of the six movements, and can be considered a first scherzo. 4. \\"Von der Sch√∂nheit\\" : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/4 \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"lead 6 (voice)\\" \\\\autoBeamOff r4 bes8 a  \\\\time 3/4 d,4 g fis8 e  \\\\time 4/4 g4 d } \\\\addlyrics { Jun- ge M√§d- chen pfl√º- cken Blu- men, } \\\\midi{\\\\tempo 4 = 70} The music of this movement, \\"Of Beauty\\" (for alto, in G major), is mostly soft and legato, meditating on the image of some \\"young girls picking lotus flowers at the riverbank.\\" Later in the movement there is a louder, more articulated section in the brass as the young men ride by on their horses. There is a long orchestral postlude to the sung passage, as the most beautiful of the young maidens looks longingly after the most handsome of the young men. 5. \\"Der Trunkene im Fr√ºhling\\" : \\\\relative c' { \\\\key a \\\\major umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\clef treble \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"french horn\\" e\\\\f \\\\times 2/3 { d8\\\\p-. b-. d-. } e4\\\\f \\\\times 2/3 { d8\\\\p-. b-. d-. }  e4\\\\fp fis16-. d-. b-. d-. e4\\\\fp fis16-. d-. b-. d-. } \\\\midi{\\\\tempo 4 = 110} The second scherzo of the work is provided by the fifth movement, \\"The drunken man in Spring\\" (for tenor, in A major). Like the first, it opens with a horn theme. In this movement Mahler uses an extensive variety of key signatures, which can change as often as every few measures. The middle section features a solo violin and solo flute, which represent the bird the singer describes. 6. \\"Der Abschied\\" The final movement, \\"The Farewell\\" (for alto, from C minor to C major), is nearly as long as the previous five movements combined. Its text is drawn from two different poems, both involving the theme of leave-taking. Mahler himself added the last lines. This final song is also notable for its text-painting, using a mandolin to represent the singer's lute, imitating bird calls with woodwinds, and repeatedly switching between the major and minor modes to articulate sharp contrasts in the text. The movement is divided into three major sections. In the first, the singer describes the nature around her as night falls. In the second, she is waiting for her friend to say a final farewell. A long orchestral interlude precedes the third section, which depicts the exchange between the two friends and fades off into silence. : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\minor umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"flute\\" r8 c'-. c32(-> d\\\\> c b! c8\\\\p~ c4) } \\\\midi{\\\\tempo 4 = 60} Lines 1‚Äì3, 17‚Äì19, and 26‚Äì28 are all sung to the same music, with a pedal point in the low strings and soft strokes of the tam-tam; in the first two of these sections, a countermelody in the flute imitates the song of a bird, but the third of these sections is just the bare pedal point and tam-tam.Gustav Mahler, \\"Das Lied von der Erde: Eine Symphonie f√ºr eine Tenor- und eine Alt- (oder Bariton-) Stimme und Orchester (nach Hans Bethges \\"Die chinesische Fl√∂te\\")\\" (Universal-Edition, Vienna, 1912) The singer repeats the final word of the song, ewig (\\"forever\\"), like a mantra, accompanied by sustained chords in the orchestra, which features mandolin, harps, and celesta. Ewig is repeated as the music fades into silence, the final chord \\"printed on the atmosphere\\" as Benjamin Britten asserted.Letter to Henry Boys, 29 June 1937, quoted in Mitchell and Reid (eds.) (1991) Letters from a Life: Selected Letters and Diaries of Benjamin Britten, London: Faber, p. 493 It is also worth noting that throughout Das Lied von der Erde there is a persistent message that \\"The earth will stay beautiful forever, but man cannot live for even a hundred years.\\" At the end of \\"Der Abschied,\\" however, Mahler adds three original lines which repeat this, but purposefully omit the part saying that \\"man must die\\". Conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein asserts that this ties in with the Eastern idea of Nirvana, in that the \\"soul\\" of the singer, as she or he dies, becomes one with the everlasting earth.\\"Das Lied von der Erde: A Personal Introduction (1972); documentary by Humphrey Burton starring Leonard Bernstein, Rene Kollo, Christa Ludwig, and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra : { << ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\set melismaBusyProperties = #'() \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"lead 6 (voice)\\" e2.~\\\\pp  e~  e(  d)  R  R  R  R  R  R \\\\bar \\".\\" } \\\\addlyrics { e - - wig! } ew PianoStaff \\\\relative c' { ew Staff { \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"string ensemble 1\\" s2.  2.~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~ ~  4 r r \\\\bar \\".\\" } } { ew Staff { \\\\clef bass \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 s2.  e~  e~  e~  e  ~  ~  ~  ~  4 r r \\\\bar \\".\\" } } >> } \\\\midi{\\\\tempo 4 = 160} The last movement is very difficult to conduct because of its cadenza-like writing for voice and solo instruments, which often flows over the barlines. Mahler specifically instructed the movement to be played Ohne R√ºcksicht auf das Tempo (Without regard for the tempo). Bruno Walter related that Mahler showed him the score of this movement and asked about one passage, \\"Can you think of a way of conducting that? Because I can't.\\"De La Grange, Henry-Louis, Gustav Mahler, Volume IV: A New Life Cut Short. Oxford University Press (), p. 510 (2008). Mahler also hesitated to put the piece before the public because of its relentless negativity, unusual even for him. \\"Won't people go home and shoot themselves?\\" he asked.SCO Programme Note  Recordings = Original score as written by Mahler Versions with female and male soloists= * Marc Albrecht, with Alice Coote and Burkhard Fritz, Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra (Pentatone 3530480) * Daniel Barenboim, with Waltraud Meier and Siegfried Jerusalem, Chicago Symphony Orchestra (Erato CD D-2292-45624-2) * Eduard van Beinum, with Nan Merriman and Ernst Haefliger, Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam (Fontana LP 894 120 ZKY) * Leonard Bernstein, with Christa Ludwig and Ren√© Kollo, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra (Sony CD 88697806222) * Gary Bertini, with Marjana Lipov≈°ek and Ben Heppner, Cologne Radio Symphony Orchestra (EMI Classics 0946 3 40238 2 5, 11-CD box set) * Pierre Boulez, with Violeta Urmana and Michael Schade, Vienna Philharmonic (DGG, CD E4695262) * Colin Davis, with Jessye Norman and Jon Vickers, London Symphony Orchestra (Philips 441 474-2) * Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, with Yvi J√§nicke and Christian Elsner, Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra (Orfeo C494001B;

Roland Harriman Among Those Elected to Junior Societies., The New York Times, November 19, 1914 Among his siblings was W. Averell Harriman, the financier and government official, four years his senior. Edward H. Harriman's estate was substantial, variously estimated between $70 million and $100 million upon his death in 1978. He was educated at Groton School, from which he graduated in 1913, and Yale University (B.A., 1917), where he was a member of Psi Upsilon fraternity. He was also a member of Skull and Bones with his classmate and friend Prescott Bush. During World War I he served for 10 months as an inspector with the rank of lieutenant in the United States Army Ordnance Department; stricken with pneumonia and influenza, he was honorably discharged in January 1919. E. Roland Harriman, residence in Arden, New York. Career After regaining his health in California, in November 1919, Harriman joined the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, a firm in which his brother W. Averell Harriman had an interest. In 1922 Harriman joined W. A. Harriman Company, investment bankers in New York City, and in 1923 he became its vice president. In 1927 the two brothers formed the banking firm Harriman Brothers and Company. In 1931 the firm was merged with Brown Bros. & Co., with Roland as vice president. Headquartered on Wall Street, Brown Brothers Harriman started with nine partners and about 200 employees, performing specialized banking services for customers, mainly medium-sized corporations; it was not a member of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In 1968 Harriman and three other senior partners at Brown Brothers (Robert A. Lovett, secretary of defense under President Harry Truman; Prescott Bush, former senator from Connecticut; and Knight Woolley ‚Äî all Yale men) moved \\"upstairs,\\" literally and figuratively, to make way for the younger partners, one of whom was Robert Roosa, former undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury. In 1975 a few years prior to Harriman's death, there were 29 partners and approximately 1,000 employees. Harriman served as the chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad for 23 years. Union Bank Harriman was one of the seven directors of the Union Banking Corporation (along with Prescott Sheldon Bush, father of future U.S. president George H.W. Bush), which financed Fritz Thyssen a donor to the Nazi Party and whose assets were seized by the United States government during World War II under the Trading with the Enemy Act and Executive Order No. 9095.

Flora Europaea. It has also been introduced to Australia, South Africa and United States, where it is an invasive weed. Due to a high concentration of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, it is poisonous to grazing livestock, especially those with simple digestive systems, like horses. Description Echium plantagineum is a winter annual plant growing to 20‚Äì60 cm tall, with rough, hairy, lanceolate leaves up to 14 cm long. The flowers are purple, 15‚Äì20 mm long, with all the stamens protruding, and borne on a branched spike.Blamey, M. & C. Grey-Wilson. Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. 1989. Piggin, C. M. & A. W.

Taxonomy The Latin genus name comes from the Greek word 'ekhis' which means viper (a type of snake). Some sources say that this is due to the seeds resembling a viper's head. Others claim that the forking at the end of the thin flower style resembles a viper's tongue. It is also claimed that the plant roots when eaten with wine could provide a folk cure for a snake bite. The Latin specific epithet plantagineum then refers to the leaves of the plant which are similar to those of a plantain.W. T. Parsons, William Thomas Parsons and E. G. Cuthbertson Invasive species In Adelaide, South Australia Echnium plantagineum has become an invasive species in Australia, where it is also known as Salvation Jane (particularly in South Australia), blueweed, Lady Campbell weed, Paterson's Curse and Riverina bluebell.Lewis Kahn and David Cottle (editors) In the United States, the species has become naturalised in parts of California, Oregon, and some eastern states and areas such as northern Michigan. In Oregon it has been declared a noxious weed. Toxicity Echium plantagineum contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids and is poisonous. The MERCK Veterinary Manual, Table 5 D. Jesse Wagstaff When eaten in large quantities, it causes reduced livestock weight and death, in severe cases, due to liver damage. Paterson's curse can also kill horses,Patersons Curse and Horse Health and irritate the udders of dairy cows and the skin of humans. After the 2003 Canberra bushfires, a large bloom of the plant occurred on the burned land, and many horses became ill and died from grazing on it.Paterson's curse poisoning in horses. Animal Health Surveillance Quarterly Report 8(4) Oct-Dec 2003. Because the alkaloids can also be found in the nectar of Paterson's curse, the honey made from it should be blended with other honeys to dilute the toxins.

The Kecksburg UFO incident occurred on December 9, 1965, at Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, United States in North America, when a fireball was reported by citizens of six U.S. states and Canada over Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Canada. Astronomers said it was likely a meteor bolide burning up in the atmosphere and descending at a steep angle. NASA released a statement in 2005 reporting that experts had examined fragments from the area and determined they were from a Soviet satellite, but records of their findings were lost in the 1990s. NASA responded to court orders and Freedom of Information Act requests to search for the records. The incident gained wide notoriety in popular culture and UFOlogy, with speculations ranging from alien craft to debris from the Soviet space probe Kosmos 96,E.g., space expert and skeptic James Oberg first proposed the Kosmos 96 explanation in 1991 and was continuing to advocate it in a 1998 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article on the Kecksburg case and is often referred to as \\"Pennsylvania's Roswell\\".  Initial reports  On the evening of December 9, 1965, a large, brilliant fireball was seen by thousands in at least six U.S. states and Ontario, Canada. It streaked over the Detroit, Michigan ‚Äì Windsor, Canada area. Reports of hot metal debris over Michigan and northern Ohio,Metal debris fall and recoveries were reported in or near Elyria, Ohio, and Livonia, Jackson, and Battle Creek, Michigan. Example sources were Chicago Tribune and Baltimore Sun, December 11, 1965 (Livonia), Elyria Chronicle-Telegram, December 11, 1965, and UPI story in Kalamazoo (MI) Gazette, December 11, 1965 (Jackson & Battle Creek) grass fires,E.g., The Spokesman-Review, December 10, 1965, p. 1, \\"U.F.O. Starts Many Fires\\", Chicago Tribune December 11, 1965, \\"Flaming Streak Across Sky Identified as Great Meteor: Blamed for Grass and Woods Fires in North States\\", Cleveland Plain-Dealer, December 10, 1965, \\"Fireballs Are Blamed in Elyria Grass Blazes\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, December 10, 1965, \\"'Flaming Ball' Crashes South of Pittsburgh, Sets Fires in 3 States\\". Grass fires associated with falling debris were widely reported in AP and UPI stories in Elyria, Ohio, Eaton Township, Ohio, near Columbus, and near Lapeer, Michigan, 40 miles (64 km) north of Detroit; smoke in the woods was also reported by witnesses and in the press to what landed near Kecksburg. and sonic booms in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area were attributed to the fireball.E.g., Pittsburgh astronomer Nicholas Wagman was quoted by UPI December 10 saying he believed the fireball to be a Geminid meteor and that \\"there were reports of a shock wave in parts of Western Pennsylvania at the time of the sighting\\" similar to a meteorite found in Pennsylvania in 1938. Some people in the village of Kecksburg, about southeast of Pittsburgh, reported something crashing in the woods, wisps of blue smoke, vibrations, and a \\"thump\\".Greensburg Tribune-Review headline story, December 10, 1965 According to an initial story in the Greensburg Tribune-Review: > \\"The area where the object landed was immediately sealed off on the order of > U.S. Army and State Police officials, reportedly in anticipation of a 'close > inspection' of whatever may have fallen ... State Police officials there > ordered the area roped off to await the expected arrival of both U.S. Army > engineers and possibly, civilian scientists.\\" When State troopers and Air Force personnel searched the woods, they reportedly found \\"absolutely nothing\\".E.g. AP article, Dec. 10: \\"State troopers and Air Force personnel tramped through the area for hours with Geiger counters. They said they found nothing and called off the search.\\" A subsequent edition in the Tribune-Review bore the headline \\"Searchers Fail To Find Object\\". Authorities discounted proposed explanations such as a plane crash, errant missile test, or reentering satellite debris and generally assumed it to be a meteor. Astronomer Paul Annear said the fireball was likely a meteor entering the Earth's atmosphere. Geophysicist George Wetherilo discounted speculations that it was debris from a satellite and agreed the reports were probably due to a meteor. Astronomers William P. Bidelman and Fred Hess said it undoubtedly was a meteor bolide. A spokesman for the Defense Department in Washington said first reports indicated the reported fireball was a natural phenomenon.E.g., 1) AP article, Dec. 10, 1965, Lebanon, PA, Daily Times: \\"A spokesman for the Defense Department in Washington said first reports indicate it was a natural phenomenon. All aircraft, missiles and the like are accounted for, he said.\\" 2) UPI article, Lima, Ohio, News, Dec. 11, 1965: \\"In Washington, the Air Force said it 'concludes that the phenomena was a meteor or meteors that entered the atmosphere.' The Air Force, which process information of unidentified flying objects, said all aircraft and missiles were accounted for and there was no evidence of space debris which entered the atmosphere at that time.\\"  Scientific articles =Sky and Telescope Several articles were written about the fireball in science journals. The February 1966 issuehttp://www.debunker.com/images2/KecksburgFeb66S&T.jpg; of Sky & Telescope reported that the fireball was seen over the Detroit-Windsor area at about 4:44 p.m. EST. The Federal Aviation Administration had received 23 reports from aircraft pilots, the first starting at 4:44 p.m. A seismograph 25 miles southwest of Detroit had recorded the shock waves created by the fireball as it passed through the atmosphere. The Sky & Telescope article concluded that \\"the path of the fireball extended roughly from northwest to southeast\\" and ended \\"in or near the western part of Lake Erie\\". Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada A 1967 article by two astronomers in the Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (JRASC) used the seismographic record to pinpoint the time of passage over the Detroit area to 4:43 p.m. In addition, they used photographs of the trail taken north of Detroit at two different locations to triangulate the trajectory of the object. They concluded that the fireball was descending at a steep angle, moving from the southwest to the northeast, and likely impacted on the northwestern shore of Lake Erie near Windsor, Ontario.E.g., NASA statements In December 2005, just before the 40th anniversary of the Kecksburg incident, NASA released a statement reporting that experts had examined metallic fragments from the area and determined they were from a Russian satellite that re-entered the atmosphere and broke up, but records of their findings were lost in the 1990s.Nasa under pressure over 'UFO': Sci- Tech: News: News24 Leslie Kean, described as \\"an investigative reporter backed by the Sci-Fi Channel\\", reportedly \\"sued NASA under the Freedom of Information Act\\" for the lost NASA records. On October 26, 2007, NASA agreed to search for those records after being ordered by a court. During the hearing, Steve McConnell, NASA's public liaison officer, testified that two boxes of papers from the time of the Kecksburg incident were missing. Loss of records is not a unique case for NASA; for example, the original tapes recorded during the televised Apollo 11 Moon landing were misplaced or reused.\\"Houston, We Erased The Apollo 11 Tapes\\". National Public Radio, July 16, 2009. In 2008 space writer James Oberg suggested that NASA was unlikely to possess any such documents since, in his view, it was highly likely that the supposed NASA team that investigated the site were in fact Air Force personnel who identified themselves as NASA personnel, something regularly done by military personnel in civilian clothes during the 1960s. He further suggested that Kean's action was no more than a \\"publicity stunt\\" for the benefit of Kean's employers. According to John Ventre of MUFON and Shafton native Owen Eichler, their recent investigations have led them to speculate the object that reportedly landed in Kecksburg was \\"a General Electric Mark 2 Re-entry Vehicle that had been launched by the Air Force as a spy satellite, but fell out of orbit\\", however, ‚Äúwe need confirmation from NASA or the Air Force\\". More recent comments by NASA are less supportive of a link to a Russian satellite: > There is some speculation that the reentry of the Cosmos 96/Venera-type > spacecraft was responsible for a fireball which was seen over southwestern > Ontario, Canada and at least eight states from Michigan to New York at 4:43 > p.m. EST (21:43 UT) on 9 December 1965. Investigations of photographs and > sightings of the fireball indicated its path through the atmosphere was > probably too steep to be consistent with a spacecraft re-entering from Earth > orbit and was more likely a meteor in a prograde orbit from the vicinity of > the asteroid belt, and probably ended its flight over western Lake Erie. > U.S. Air Force tracking data on Cosmos 96 also indicate the spacecraft orbit > decayed earlier than 21:43 UT on 9 December. Other unconfirmed reports state > the fireball subsequently landed in Pennsylvania southeast of Pittsburgh > near the town of Kecksburg (40.2 N, 79.5 W) at 4:46 p.m. EST (although > estimating the impact point of fireballs from eyewitness accounts is > notoriously inaccurate). Uncertainties in the orbital information and > reentry coordinates and time make it difficult to determine definitively if > the fireball could have been the Cosmos 96 spacecraft.  Television and film  * In 1990, the NBC television show Unsolved Mysteries aired an episode partially devoted to the incident. The episode suggested an extraterrestrial craft had crashed. It quoted local residents at the time who said they had found an object in the woods shaped like an acorn and about as large as a Volkswagen Beetle bearing writing resembling Egyptian hieroglyphs which was subsequently removed in a secret military operation. A prop from that show remains on display in the village.Unsolved Mysteries Original Robert Stack Episodes, Season 3 Episode 1, December 31, 1990. * In 2003, the Sci Fi Channel aired a two-hour documentary entitled \\"The New Roswell: Kecksburg Exposed\\", hosted by Bryant Gumbel. During the show, Kecksburg resident John Hays said when he was a 10-year old boy, he saw \\"a flat-bed truck emerging from the site near his house carrying something the ‚Äúsize of a VW‚Äù, an exact repetition of the claims he made in the first episode of Unsolved Mysteries, season 3, in 1990. * The 2008, an episode of the Discovery Channel series Nazi UFO Conspiracy suggested the incident was the recovery of an alleged Nazi UFO called Die Glocke (\\"The Bell\\"; also known as \\"The Nazi Bell\\"),Nazi UFO Conspiracy: The Bell Video at YourDiscovery.com * In February 2009, the History Channel's UFO Hunters suggested a military conspiracy and cover-up related to the incident. * In 2011, the History Channel's Ancient Aliens suggested the alleged Nazi secret weapon Die Glocke was recovered at Kecksburg, prompting a government conspiracy and cover-up. * In 2014, Giorgio Tsoukalos with the History Channel's In Search of Aliens visited the site of the crash led by local UFO researcher Stan Gordon. * On September 12, 2019, producer/director Cody Knotts premiered his film \\"Kecksburg\\" based on the events at Kecksburg. The film follows the dramatized story of real-life John Murphy, a reporter for local radio station WHJB who was among the first to arrive on the scene, as he tries to uncover more information about the mysterious object that crash landed in the rural woodlands of Kecksburg. * Filmmaker Andrew Patterson has said that the plot of his 2019 film The Vast of Night was partially based on the Kecksburg incident.

Early life Harriman was born on February 20, 1848, in Hempstead, New York, the son of Orlando Harriman, Sr., an Episcopal clergyman, and Cornelia Neilson. He had a brother, Orlando Harriman, Jr. His great- grandfather, William Harriman, had emigrated from England in 1795 and became a successful businessman and trader. As a young boy, Harriman spent a summer working at the Greenwood Iron Furnace in the area owned by the Robert Parker Parrott family that would become Harriman State Park. He quit school at age 14 to take a job as an errand boy on Wall Street in New York City. His uncle Oliver Harriman had earlier established a career there. By age 22, he was a member of the New York Stock Exchange. Career Harriman's father-in-law was president of the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad Company, which aroused Harriman's interest in upstate New York transportation. In 1881, at age 33, Harriman acquired the small, broken-down Lake Ontario Southern Railroad. He renamed it the Sodus Bay & Southern, reorganized it, and sold it to the Pennsylvania Railroad at a considerable profit. This was the start of his career as a rebuilder of bankrupt railroads. A 1907 cartoon depicting Harriman and his railroads as subject to federal law and the Interstate Commerce Commission Harriman was nearly 50 years old when in 1897 he became a director of the Union Pacific Railroad. By May 1898, he was chairman of the executive committee, and from that time until his death, his word was the law on the Union Pacific system. In 1903, he assumed the office of president of the company. From 1901 to 1909, Harriman was also the president of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The vision of a unified UP/SP railroad was planted with Harriman. (The UP and SP were reunited on September 11, 1996, a month after the Surface Transportation Board approved their merger.) At the time of his death Harriman controlled the Union Pacific, the Southern Pacific, the Saint Joseph and Grand Island, the Illinois Central, the Central of Georgia, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and the Wells Fargo Express Company. Estimates of his estate ranged from $150 million to $200 million. That fortune was left entirely to his wife. The Harriman Alaska Expedition In 1899, Harriman sponsored and accompanied a scientific expedition to catalog the flora and fauna of the Alaska coastline. Many prominent scientists and naturalists went on the expedition, aboard the luxuriously refitted steamer SS George W. Elder. Interest in ju-jitsu Harriman became interested in ju-jitsu after his two-month visit to Japan in 1905. When he returned to America, he brought with him a troupe of six Japanese ju-jitsu wrestlers, including the prominent judokas Tsunejiro Tomita and Mitsuyo Maeda. Among many performances, the troupe gave an exhibition that drew some 600 spectators in the Columbia University gymnasium on February 7, 1905. Personal life In 1879, Harriman married Mary Williamson Averell, daughter of William J. Averell, a banker in Ogdensburg, New York. Together they had: * Mary Harriman (1881‚Äì1934), who married Charles Cary Rumsey (1879‚Äì1922), a sculptor, in 1910. * Henry Neilson Harriman (1883‚Äì1888), who died young. * Cornelia Harriman (1884‚Äì1966), who married Robert Livingston Gerry, Sr. (1877‚Äì1957) in 1908. * Carol Averell Harriman (1889‚Äì1948), who married Richard Penn Smith, Jr. (1893‚Äì1929) in 1917. After his death, she married W. Plunket Stewart, who had previously been married and divorced from Elsie Cassatt, the daughter of Alexander Cassatt, in 1930. * William Averell Harriman (1891-1986), the Secretary of Commerce under President Harry S.

He was married three times: First to Kitty Lanier Lawrance (from 1915 until their divorce in 1929), then Marie Norton Whitney (from 1930 until her death in 1970), then lastly Pamela Beryl Digby Churchill Hayward (from 1971 until his death in 1986) * Edward Roland Noel Harriman (1895‚Äì1978), who married Gladys Fries (1896‚Äì1983) in 1917. Harriman died on September 9, 1909, at his home, Arden, at 1:30 p.m. at age 61. Naturalist John Muir, who had joined him on the 1899 Alaska Expedition, wrote in his eulogy of Harriman, \\"In almost every way, he was a man to admire.\\" Harriman was buried at the St. John's Episcopal Church cemetery in the hamlet of Arden, near his estate. Harriman estate In 1885, Harriman acquired \\"Arden\\", the Parrott family estate in the Ramapo Highlands near Tuxedo, New York, for $52,500. The property had been a source of charcoal for the Parrott Brothers Iron Works. Over the next several years he purchased almost 40 nearby parcels of land, adding , and connected all of them with of bridle paths. His residence, Arden House, was completed just seven months before he died. In the early 1900s, his sons W. Averell Harriman and E. Roland Harriman hired landscape architect Arthur P. Kroll to landscape many acres. In 1910, his widow donated to the state of New York for Harriman State Park. The estate was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966. In 1977, they gave the State of Idaho a Harriman State Park\\" on several conditions. One of these was that the waters of the Henry's Fork, which flowed through the property, had to be managed for catch-and-release fly fishing. To this day, it is considered one of the greatest fly fishing streams in North America. Legacy Bust of Edward H. Harriman by Auguste Rodin Award *In 1913, his widow created the E. H.

History left The Bureau du Roi was probably started in 1760, when the commission was formally announced. Its first designer was Jean- Fran√ßois Oeben, the master cabinet maker of the royal arsenal. The first step in its construction was the fabrication of an extremely detailed miniature model in wax. The full scale desk was finished in 1769 by his successor, Jean Henri Riesener, who had married Oeben's widow. Made for the new Cabinet du Roi at the Palace of Versailles, it was transferred to the Louvre Museum in Paris after the French Revolution, but has been returned to the Palace of Versailles in the 20th century where it stands again in the room where it was standing before the Revolution, i.e. the Cabinet int√©rieur du Petit Appartement (\\"Inner study of the Private Apartments\\"), the famous study room where kings Louis XV and Louis XVI carried out their daily work, and where King Louis XVI decided to support the American insurgents in 1777. Secret diplomatic papers were kept inside the secretary's secret drawers, whose only key the king always carried with him. Description The desk is covered with intricate marquetry of a wide variety of fine woods. In an oval reserve at the center of its 'public' side, away from the king himself, is the marquetry head of Silence, with forefinger to lips, a reminder of the discretion required in the king's business. Gilt-bronze moldings of plaques, statuettes, miniature busts and vases, even integral scrolling gilt-bronze candle stands, further adorn the surfaces of the desk. The original design was to have a miniature bust of Louis XV on top, but it was replaced by Minerva after his death in 1770. Riesener later executed a simplified second version of the Bureau du Roi for Pierre-Gaspard-Marie Grimod, comte d'Orsay; today this may be seen in the Wallace Collection in London. His copy was the first of a number of replicas that were produced from the 1870s onwards by leading cabinetmakers in Paris, including four examples by Fran√ßois Linke.

He was a son of the 3rd Earl of Carnarvon. He was Liberal Member of Parliament for the two-member constituency of Nottingham from 1870 to 1874. He promoted a classical liberal philosophy and took the ideas of Herbert Spencer a stage further by advocating voluntary-funded government that uses force only in defence of individual liberty and private property. He is known as the originator of voluntaryism. Life Auberon Herbert was born at Highclere Castle on 18 June 1838. He was the third son of the 3rd Earl of Carnarvon, and brother of Henry Herbert, the 4th Earl. Herbert was educated at Eton College, entering the school in 1850. He left school early, having been elected to a founder's kin fellowship at St John's College, Oxford in 1855. In May 1858 he joined the 7th Queen's Own Hussars at Canterbury with the rank of Cornet by purchase, and in June 1859 became a Lieutenant, also by purchase. In the autumn of 1860 he joined the service troops at Umballa, India. In 1861 he returned to England and sold his commission in 1862. He then returned to Oxford, where he was President of the Union in Hilary Term 1862; he graduated B.C.L. in 1862 and D.C.L. in 1865. He lectured in history and jurisprudence at St John's College, and resigned his fellowship in 1869.\\"Herbert, Auberon Edward William Molyneux\\", Dictionary of National Biography, 1912 supplement In March 1864 he visited the scene of the Prusso-Danish war, and distinguished himself at Dybbol by sallies from the Danish redoubts for the purpose of rescuing the wounded. As a recognition of his bravery he was made a knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. His impressions of the campaign were recorded in his letters to his mother published under the title The Danes in Camp (1864). He went to the United States during the American Civil War, and he witnessed the Siege of Richmond (1864‚Äì65). During the Franco-Prussian War he went to France, and was present at the Battle of Sedan (1870). He was outside Paris during the Siege of Paris (1870‚Äì71), and was one of the first to enter the city after the capitulation, being nearly shot as a spy on his way in. He remained there during the Paris Commune in the company of his second brother, Alan Herbert, who practised medicine in Paris. In later life he received the Austrian Order of the Iron Crown, third class, for helping to rescue the crew of the Pare, an Austrian vessel wrecked off Westward Ho! In 1871 Herbert married Lady Florence Amabel, daughter of George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper. She died in 1886. They had four children. Of their two sons, the elder died in boyhood, while the younger, Auberon Thomas, born in 1876, succeeded Francis Cowper, 7th Earl Cowper as Lord Lucas and Dingwall in 1905. Their two daughters were Clair Mimram (presumably named for the River Mimram in Hertfordshire), born 1874, and Nan Ino, born 1880, who succeeded her brother as 10th Baroness Lucas and 6th Lady Dingwall. Political career He stood as a Conservative candidate for Newport in the 1865 general election but was defeated. He held the post of private secretary to Stafford Northcote, the President of the Board of Trade from 1866 to 1868. He stood as a Liberal candidate for Berkshire in the 1868 election but lost. He served as President of the fourth day of the first ever Co-operative Congress in 1869. He was successfully elected in a by-election for Nottingham in 1870 becoming a Liberal M.P. Ashley, New Milton, Hampshire. Residence of Auberon Herbert, c. 1874 to c. 1886 The Old House north of Burley, Hampshire. Rebuilt in brick by Herbert, where he lived for the last 20 years of his life For the Elementary Education Act 1870 he supported the principle that all provided schools should be secular or strictly unsectarian. His support for this Act (state provided schools) is in contradiction to his later political position. In 1872 he seconded Sir Charles Dilke's motion for an inquiry into the expenses of the civil list, and followed Sir Charles's example by declaring himself a republican. This led to a scene of great disorder, and the latter part of his speech was inaudible. He took a leading part in the passing of the Protection of Wild Birds Act 1872. He was an ardent supporter of Joseph Arch and spoke at the mass meeting at Leamington on Good Friday 1872, when the National Agricultural Labourers' Union was formed. On account of his objection to taking life he became a vegetarian. He retired from parliamentary life at the 1874 general election. He took an active part in the agitation caused by the Bulgarian atrocities; organised in 1878 the great 'anti-Jingo' demonstration in Hyde Park against the expected war with Russia; and in 1880 championed the cause of Charles Bradlaugh, speaking at some of the stormy Hyde Park meetings. He was an ardent but independent supporter of Herbert Spencer. His creed developed a variant of Spencerian individualism which he described as 'voluntaryism'. In 1884 Herbert published his best-known book, A Politician in Trouble about his Soul, a reprint with alterations and additions from The Fortnightly Review. In the first chapters the objections to the party system are discussed, and in the last chapter Spencerian principles are expounded and the doctrine of Laissez-faire is pushed to the extreme point of advocating 'voluntary taxation.' In 1890 Herbert started a small weekly paper, Free Life, which soon became a small separate monthly paper, the Organ of Voluntary Taxation and the Voluntary State which ran until 1901. Later life On leaving parliament he took to farming, purchasing Ashley Arnewood farm in Ashley, New Forest, where he lived until his wife's death in 1886. He then moved to the neighbourhood of Burley in the New Forest, and built, after a pre-existing building, 'The Old House,' which was his home until his death on 5 November 1906. He was buried in a grave in the grounds of his house. Voluntaryism Government, he argued, should never initiate force but be \\"strictly limited to its legitimate duties in defense of self-ownership and individual rights,\\" and to be consistent in not initiating force they should maintain themselves only through \\"voluntary taxation.\\" He stressed that \\"we are governmentalists... formally constituted by the nation, employing in this matter of force the majority method\\" ‚Äì however, using this force only in a defensive mode. He strongly opposed the idea that initiation of force may somehow become legitimate merely by constituting a majority, reasoning that \\"If we are self-owners (and it is absurd, it is doing violence to reason, to suppose that we are not), neither an individual, nor a majority, nor a government can have rights of ownership in other men.\\"\\"Essay X: The Principles of Voluntaryism and Free Life\\" Herbert recommends a \\"central agency\\" to defend liberty and property that is funded by a \\"voluntary tax,\\" calling it \\"government.\\" In his essay \\"A Politician in Sight of Haven,\\" Herbert does discuss the franchise, stating it would be limited to those who paid a voluntary \\"income tax,\\" anyone \\"paying it would have the right to vote; those who did not pay it would be ‚Äì as is just ‚Äì without the franchise. There would be no other tax.\\" The law would be strictly limited, of course, and the \\"government... must confine itself simply to the defence of life and property, whether as regards internal or external defence.\\" Herbert says that in \\"voluntaryism the state employs force only to repel force ‚Äì to protect the person and the property of the individual against force and fraud; under voluntaryism the state would defend the rights of liberty, never aggress upon them.\\" G. K. Chesterton wrote, \\"Herbert Spencer really went as far as he could in the direction of Individualism, just as Karl Marx went as far as he could in the direction of Socialism. He left only the gallant and eccentric Auberon Herbert to go one step further; and practically propose that we should abolish the police; and merely insure ourselves against thieves and assassins, as against fire and accident.\\"Illustrated London News 15 February 1936, p. 266. A collection of Herbert's work, The Right and Wrong of Compulsion by the State and Other Essays, was published by Liberty Classics in 1978. Herbert and anarchism In an announcement of Herbert's death, Benjamin Tucker said, \\"Auberon Herbert is dead. He was a true anarchist in everything but name. How much better (and how much rarer) to be an anarchist in everything but name than to be an anarchist in name only!\\"Tucker, Benjamin .Liberty, vol. 15, no. 6, p. 16 Tucker praised Herbert's work as \\"a magnificent assault on the majority idea, a searching exposure of the inherent evil of State systems, and a glorious assertion of the inestimable benefits of voluntary action and free competition...\\" while admonishing him for his support of profit in trade (but believes, unlike Herbert himself, that Herbert's system would result in an economy without profit).Tucker, Benjamin. Auberon Herbert and His Work , Liberty, Vol. 3, No. 10, Saturday, 23 May 1885, Whole No. 62 According to Eric Mack, Herbert felt that people who \\"like Tucker, favored the free establishment of defensive associations and juridical institutions were simply making a verbal error in calling themselves \\"anarchists\\".\\"Mack, Eric. Voluntaryism: The Political Thought of Auberon Herbert Herbert explicitly rejected the label \\"anarchist\\" for his ideas. He argued that anarchy was a \\"contradiction,\\" and that the Voluntaryists \\"reject the anarchist creed.\\" They \\"believe in a national government, voluntary supported... and only entrusted with force for protection of person and property.\\" He called his system of a national government funded by non-coerced contributions \\"the Voluntary State.\\"A Voluntaryist Appeal, Herbert Spencer and the Limits of the State, pp. 228, 239 According to Chris Tame, \\"He refused to accept the label of 'anarchist', largely because of a semantic decision whereby he labelled the defensive use of force (which, naturally, he accepted) as 'government.'\\"Tame, Chris R. The libertarian tradition No 1: Auberon Herbert, The Journal of the Libertarian Alliance, Vol. 1, No. 2, Spring 1980 Richard Sylvan, points out that \\"a variety of political arrangements and organization, including governments of certain sorts, are entirely compatible with anarchy.\\" Rather, anarchists oppose the state or \\"coercive government.\\"Slyvan, Richard. Anarchism. A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, editors Goodin, Robert E. and Pettit, Philip. Blackwell Publishing, 1995, p. 293. Sean Sheehan points out, \\"A distinction that is relevant to the anarchist ideal is the difference between the government, referring to the state, and government, referring to the administration of a political system. Anarchists, like everyone, tend to use the word government as a synonym for state, but what is rejected by anarchism's a priori opposition to the state is not the concept of government as such but the idea of a sovereign order that claims and demand obedience, and if necessary the lives, of its subjects.\\"Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, Reaktion Books 2004, pp. 25‚Äì26 Anarchist William R. McKercher notes that Herbert \\"was often mistakenly taken as an anarchist\\" but \\"a reading of Herbert's work will show that he was not an anarchist.\\"W.R.McKercher, Freedom and Authority, vol.II, no.17, (1888) pp. 73. The leading British anarchist journal of the time noted that the \\"Auberon Herbertites in England are sometimes called Anarchists by outsiders, but they are willing to compromise with the inequity of government to maintain private property.\\"McKercher, 199. Since the development of anarcho-capitalism in the 1950s, at least one anarcho-capitalist, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, believes that Herbert \\"develops the Spencerian idea of equal freedom to its logically consistent anarcho- capitalist end\\" as noted in a bibliography.Anarcho-Capitalism: An Annotated Bibliography, 2002. Retrieved from LewRockwell.com However, anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard disagreed and called Herbert a \\"near-anarchist.\\"Rothbard, Murray. Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal, Ramparts, VI, 4, 15 June 1968, copyright 2005 Mises Institute. Obtained from LewRockwell.com. Criticism Victor Yarros, an individualist anarchist, noted what he believed to be a key flaw in Herbert's ideology, namely economic inequality. In an article called \\"Private Property and Freedom\\", Yarros argued: According to Carl Watner, \\"Herbert never defended his position in Liberty.\\" Anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin echoed Yarros and argued that the \\"modern Individualism initiated by Herbert Spencer is... a powerful indictment against the dangers and wrongs of government, but its practical solution of the social problem is miserable ‚Äì so miserable as to lead us to inquire if the talk of 'No force' be merely an excuse for supporting landlord and capitalist domination.\\"Act For Yourselves, Freedom Press, London, 1987, p. 98. John A. Hobson, an early democratic socialist, echoed the anarchist critique in his essay on Herbert, \\"A Rich Man's Anarchism\\".J.A.Hobson, Humanitarian, no 12, 1898, pp. 390‚Äì7. He argued that Herbert's support for exclusive private property would result in the poor being enslaved to the rich. Herbert, \\"by allowing first comers to monopolise without restriction the best natural supplies\\" would allow them \\"to thwart and restrict the similar freedom of those who come after.\\" Hobson gave the \\"extreme instance\\" of an island \\"the whole of which is annexed by a few individuals, who use the rights of exclusive property and transmission... to establish primogeniture.\\" In such a situation, the bulk of the population would be denied the right to exercise their faculties or to enjoy the fruits of their labour, which Herbert claimed to be the inalienable rights of all. Hobson concluded: \\"It is thus that the 'freedom' of a few (in Herbert's sense) involves the 'slavery' of the many.\\"Hobson, p. 394. Hobson's argument reflected Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's critique of inheritance and land laws in continental Europe in What Is Property? Scholar M. W. Taylor notes that \\"of all the points Hobson raised... this argument was his most effective, and Herbert was unable to provide a satisfactory response.\\"Men Versus the State, Clarendon Press, 1992, p. 249.

Zichmni is described as a great lord of some islands off the southern coast of Frislanda, a possibly fictitious island claimed to be larger than Ireland and located south of Iceland. According to the book, the letters provided a first-hand account of a voyage of exploration undertaken in 1398 by Prince Zichmni, accompanied by the Zeno brothers. The book claims that the voyagers crossed the North Atlantic to Greenland. A few recent authors speculate that they may have reached the coast of North America. There is disagreement among historians as to whether to accept the Zeno letters as valid.

S. Wilson, and written by Maddock, Wilson, and Underwood. Tremors was released by Universal Pictures and stars Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward, Finn Carter, Michael Gross, and Reba McEntire. In the film, tired of their dull lives in the small desert town of Perfection, Nevada, repairmen Val McKee (Bacon) and Earl Bassett (Ward) try to skip town. However, they happen upon a series of mysterious deaths and a concerned seismologist Rhonda (Carter) studying unnatural readings below the ground. With the help of an eccentric survivalist couple Burt and Heather Gummer (Gross and McEntire), the group fights for survival against giant, worm-like monsters hungry for human flesh. The film is the first installment of the Tremors franchise, and was followed by five direct-to-video sequels: Tremors 2: Aftershocks (1996), Tremors 3: Back to Perfection (2001), Tremors 5: Bloodlines (2015), Tremors: A Cold Day in Hell (2018) and Tremors: Shrieker Island (2020) and a direct-to-video prequel, Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004). A television series titled Tremors: The Series, aired from March through August 2003. Plot Valentine \\"Val\\" McKee and Earl Bassett are handymen working in Perfection, Nevada, an isolated settlement in the high desert east of the Sierra Nevada mountains. They eventually get tired of their jobs and leave for Bixby, the nearest town. As they leave, they discover the dead body of another resident, Edgar Deems, perched atop an electrical tower, still grasping the tower's crossbeams and his rifle. Jim Wallace, the town's doctor, determines that Edgar died of dehydration, apparently having been too afraid to climb down. Later on, an unseen creature kills shepherd Fred and his flock of sheep. Val and Earl discover his severed head and believe that a serial killer is on the loose. Two construction workers ignore Val and Earl's warning and are killed by the same creature, causing a rock slide. Val and Earl try to find help after warning the residents, but find the phone lines are dead and that the rock slide has blocked the only road out of town. Out of sight, a snake-like creature wraps itself around their truck's rear axle, but is torn apart when Val stomps on the accelerator and drives away, and is discovered when they return to town. Val and Earl borrow horses to ride to Bixby for help. They come upon Wallace and his wife's buried station wagon near their trailer, but the couple is missing (having been killed the previous night). As they press on, an enormous burrowing worm-like monster suddenly erupts out of the ground, revealing the snake-like creature to be one of the worm's many tentacled \\"tongues\\". Thrown from their horses, the men flee with the monster in pursuit. The chase ends when the eyeless creature crashes through the concrete wall of an aqueduct, dying from the impact. Rhonda LeBeck, a graduate student conducting seismology tests in the area, stumbles onto the scene; she deduces from previous readings that three other worms are in the area. Rhonda, Val, and Earl become trapped overnight atop a cluster of boulders near one of the worms, and surmise that the creatures hunt their prey by detecting seismic vibrations. The trio then finds some discarded poles and use them to pole vault across some nearby boulders and eventually reach Rhonda's truck, narrowly escaping the creature. After the three return to town, the worms attack and kill general store owner Walter Chang, forcing everyone to hide on the town's various rooftops. Meanwhile, survivalist couple Burt and Heather Gummer manage to kill one of the creatures after unwittingly luring it to their basement armory. In town, the two remaining worms attack the building foundations, knocking over a trailer belonging to Nestor before dragging him under and devouring him. Realizing they cannot stay in the town any longer, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel distract the monsters while Val commandeers a track loader and chains a semi-trailer to the rear; the survivors use it to try to escape to a nearby mountain range. En route, both worms create a sinkhole trap that disables the track loader, and the survivors flee to some nearby boulders for safety. Earl then has an idea to lure in the worms and trick them into swallowing Burt's homemade pipe bombs. The strategy successfully kills one worm, but the last one spits a bomb back towards the survivors, forcing them to disperse as the explosion destroys all but one of the remaining bombs. Val lures the final worm into chasing him to the edge of a cliff and then explodes the remaining bomb behind it, frightening the worm into charging through the cliff face, where it plummets to its death onto the rocks below. The group returns to town, where they call in the authorities to begin an investigation while Earl encourages Val to pursue a romantic relationship with Rhonda. CastProduction The concept of Tremors was originally conceived in the early 1980s, when writers S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock were working for the United States Navy as filmmakers in charge of creating educational safety videos. While getting footage, the two climbed a large desert boulder and asked the question \\"what if there was something wouldn't let us off of this rock?\\" This inspired the two to start brainstorming ideas for a monster movie, which was eventually dubbed 'Land Sharks'. They shared their idea to friend Ron Underwood, who was working with National Geographic as a documentary director, and used his knowledge of zoology to better develop the \\"land sharks\\" into creatures that could realistically exist. After their script for Short Circuit became a major box office hit, Wilson and Maddock quickly began shopping around their idea for Tremors. The name 'Land Sharks' was changed due to a then-popular Saturday Night Live sketch featuring a character of the same name. The original screenplay, titled 'Beneath Perfection', was finished in June 1988. Filming Filming began in early 1989 over the course of 50 days. Principal photography took place around Lone Pine, California and the isolated community of Darwin, California, which the crew liked due to its uncanny similitaries to the fictional town of Perfection, Nevada. The town, which was entirely a set, was built near Olancha, California at . The mountains in the distance are the Sierra Nevada, and Owens Lake is visible in the background during the film's climax. Props The creature for Tremors was designed by Amalgamated Dynamics. The full-scale graboid seen after being dug up by Val was cast in lightweight foam. It was placed in a trench, then buried, and dug up again to achieve the desired \\"used\\" effect. Burt's elephant gun, an 8-gauge Darne shotgun, was rented from a private collector for use in the film. It \\"fired\\" dummy cartridges custom made from solid brass rod stock.The Ultimate Tremors FAQ, Questions about Tremors: What is that dang elephant gun Burt uses to kill the Graboid in his basement?. Written by S. S. Wilson (writer/director of Tremors) stampede-entertainment.comThe Ultimate Tremors FAQ, Questions about Tremors: What happened to the 8 gauge elephant gun (actually a Darne shotgun) Burt used to kill the Graboid in his basement?. Written by S. S. Wilson (writer/director of Tremors) stampede-entertainment.com Post- production Composer Ernest Troost's musical score for the film went mostly unused. The studio thought it was \\"too goofy\\" and cut most of it, later hiring composer Robert Folk to write a new score that was more \\"serious and action-y\\". Despite his contributions, Folk ultimately went uncredited. Tremors was set for a November 1989 release. However, the MPAA gave the film an R-rating due to language, and the creators decided at the last minute to make the film more commercially viable. Over 20 or so uses of the word \\"fuck\\" were either cut or redubbed with softer words; examples include \\"can you fly, you sucker?\\" and \\"we killed that motherhumper\\", among several others. The film was pushed back to allow more time for editing, and the film was eventually released in January 1990 with a PG-13 rating. Wilson and Maddock later stated they were happy with the decision to make Tremors appeal to a family audience. Release and reception=Box office Tremors opened on January 19, 1990 in 1,457 theaters against no new releases and debuted at the #5 spot, behind Born on the Fourth of July, Tango & Cash, The War Of The Roses, and Internal Affairs, grossing $3,731,520 in its opening weekend. It dropped to #6 on its second week but would stay in the top 10 for four weeks before finally dropping to #11 in week 5. Tremors had a budget of $10 million and ended up grossing $16,667,084 at the domestic box office, which made it financially successful though far below projected numbers. In 2019, Kevin Bacon hinted that Tremors only made \\"a fifth of what the charts at Universal said it would.\\" Its creators blamed the subpar theatrical performance on its marketing campaign; S.S. Wilson felt that the film was not well promoted once its release date was delayed, while Brent Maddock stated the theatrical trailer was \\"cringeworthy\\" and likely deterred audiences. Critical reception Tremors was hailed by critics for its diverse cast and humor. As of September 2020 the film holds a \\"certified fresh\\" rating of 86% at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 44 reviews and an average score of 7.17 out of 10, with the consensus: \\"An affectionate throwback to 1950s creature features, Tremors reinvigorates its genre tropes with a finely balanced combination of horror and humor. James Berardinelli praised Tremors with a 3/4 star rating, feeling that \\"horror/comedies often tread too far to one side or the other of that fine line; Tremors walks it like a tightrope\\". Roger Ebert gave the film a 3.5/4 rating and wrote \\"Most shlocky creature features seem oblivious to character development...but Tremors is smart enough to realize that the characters are the driving force of a great story, not the monsters or the violence.\\" Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly gave Tremors a B+, saying \\"Tremors is the Slacker of monster movies: bemused, improvisatory, willfully low-key...most of its errors can be overlooked and forgiven, which is rare for its genre.\\" Richard Harrington of the Washington Post called the film \\"a delightful throwback to such '50s and '60s films\\", and Jeffery Anderson of the San Francisco Examiner gave the film a glowing 4.5/5 star review, calling Tremors \\"effectively terrifying when it needs to be, effectively exciting when it needs to be, and effectively hilarious when it needs to be, Tremors may very well be the best horror film, the best action flick, and the best comedy of the year\\". In some less enthusiastic reviews, Vincent Canby for the New York Times remarked that the film \\"was clearly more fun to make than it is for us to watch\\", and Variety gave the film a C- on the basis that Tremors \\"...has a few clever twists and characters but ultimately can't decide on what it wants to be: flat-out funny, which it's usually not, or a scarefest, which it's usually not either.\\" Gene Siskel initially gave the film a negative review, stating \\"most of the secondary characters aren't compelling and its horror conventions are lame...Tremors could make a cute short subject but it doesn't sustain itself as an entire film\\", but later gave the film a positive review in his book Cinema: Year by Year 1894-2001, saying \\"If you want to see a good B-movie, watch Tremors; it was one of the few monster movies to get the formula right.\\" Home releases While only a modest hit at the box office, Tremors went on to become a massive hit on home video purchases, rentals, and on television, becoming one of the most rented films of 1990. Because of this, it has gained a very large cult following over the years. Tremors debuted on VHS on April 1, 1990, on Laserdisc on April 16, 1996, and on DVD on April 28, 1998. This was released on VHS by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment in June 2, 2000. The film was released on Blu-ray on November 9, 2010 and again on September 17, 2013, as part of the Tremors: Attack Pack for region 1 (U.S. and Canada). In the United Kingdom, the Attack Pack was not released on Blu- ray; instead, the second, third, and fourth films were released on Blu-ray separately on August 5, 2013. It was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on December 15, 2020. Soundtrack The soundtrack for Tremors was composed by Ernest Troost and released in 2000. The album contained nine tracks from the film, as well as four additional tracks, also composed by Troost, from Bloodrush. For promotional purposes, the album was released as a limited edition CD. Graboids The Graboid is an ancient species of sandworm. According to UGO.com, \\"Graboids are to the desert what sharks are to the ocean\\". Graboids advance through several radically different life cycle stages. Graboids are described as subterranean animals, superficially resembling gigantic worms or grubs, with long cylindrical bodies. When fully grown, a Graboid will be up to long, and across at the widest point, and weigh 10‚Äì20 tons. Graboids have no eyes; they do not need them, due to living underground. Their heads consist of a massive black armored beak, which is used to push aside the dirt while digging. The beak opens like a grotesque flower; it consists of a wide upper jaw, a thinner lower jaw, and a pair of hooked mandibles, one on each side. In Tremors 5: Bloodlines, they are reported to have a semi-rigid internal structure, much like the cuttlebone of cuttlefish. Graboids have three long powerful snake- like tentacles, which are prehensile and can have at least a good reach; possibly up to or greater. Each of these tentacles (which have been loosely compared to functioning like the creature's tongue) terminates in a toothed mouth of its own. It is unclear if they bite off and swallow food on their own, or if they are simply used to get a better grip on prey so it can be dragged into the creature's jaws. Normally kept retracted in the Graboid's throat, these tentacles were initially mistaken for the whole creatures, causing the characters in the first Tremors film to underestimate the size of their underground opponents. The Graboid's common name is derived from these prehensile tentacles, which 'grab' prey and pull it back down the Graboid's hungry gullet. At times, these tentacles appear to be semi-autonomous, hissing and writhing like snakes. Food is typically swallowed whole, though early in the first film, they are shown to be capable of dismembering and decapitating prey. Life cycle Fan made life cycle diagram. *Graboids are hatched from eggs laid by Ass-Blasters (the final stage in the life cycle), as indicated in Tremors 3. These eggs split open diagonally. *Dirt Dragons are baby Graboids, first introduced in Tremors 4. Shorter and more compact than adults, their mouth tentacles are not developed enough to aid in hunting, but they compensate for this by hurling themselves out of the ground to tackle prey \\"like some kind of demonic trout\\". Like mature Graboids, they are covered in spikes that aid in burrowing, but they are also covered in a row of armored scales on their backs for protection. As they grow in size, Dirt Dragons gradually molt into larger Graboids, too heavy to launch themselves out of the ground, switching to hunt with their now developed mouth tentacles. *Upon maturing, Graboids measure 30 feet (9.2 m) long and will resume attacking and consuming prey. After that, they will seek a secluded spot where they will metamorphose. *Shriekers are bipedal, armless predators resembling a flightless bird, with the characteristic mandibles of Graboids. They are introduced in Tremors 2. The most bizarre transition in their life cycle, Shriekers are \\"born\\" from Graboids by tearing their way out of them (with an average litter size of three to six), which kills the Graboid. The SciFi Channel website for the TV series contained an article postulating that Shriekers are essentially parasitic \\"twins\\": fertilized embryos that gestate inside of their older siblings. Shriekers are not only blind like Graboids, but deaf: they rely on a special heat-vision organ in their forehead. Unlike Graboids, they have no mouth tentacles. Shriekers reproduce asexually: after eating enough food, Shriekers will spit out a cocoon containing a mini version of themselves, which matures into an adult in a matter of hours. This leads to exponential population growth, producing large herds of Shriekers after only a few days. *Ass-Blasters are introduced in Tremors 3: when a Shrieker is around three days old, it will undergo a Moulting process, turning into an Ass- Blaster. Ass-Blasters can live up to several years (an individual sold to Siegfried & Roy in Tremors 3 was still alive two years later in the TV series). Ass-blasters are so-named because they can achieve flight using an explosive chemical reaction in their cloaca, much like a Bombardier beetle. Resembling a large Shrieker with thinner and more streamlined proportions, Ass-blasters also possess large frilled membranes that serve as crude wings, allowing them to glide through the air after explosively launching themselves. Like Shriekers, they are blind and deaf, relying on heat vision. While Shriekers reproduce asexually once they have consumed enough food, Ass- Blasters will slip into a \\"food-coma\\" if they eat too much. Each Ass-Blaster carries a single Graboid egg in its gut: because they can cover large distances when flying, they can spread their eggs over a wide range. Sequels & spin-offs A sequel, Tremors 2: Aftershocks, was released in 1996. A second sequel, Tremors 3: Back to Perfection, was released in 2001, followed by a prequel, Tremors 4: The Legend Begins in 2004. These three sequels were all made with direct involvement from S.S. Wilson, Brent Maddock, and Ron Underwood at Stampede Entertainment. Following an 11-year gap, Tremors 5: Bloodlines was released in 2015, with the franchise's sixth inclusion, Tremors: A Cold Day in Hell, in 2018. These two films were made by Universal 1440 Entertainment without any involvement from Stampede Entertainment. All Tremors sequels thus far have been released direct-to-video without a theatrical release, though Tremors 2: Aftershocks did receive a brief limited theatrical run. Another direct-to-video sequel, Tremors: Shrieker Island, was released in October 2020. In 2003, the franchise spawned a television show titled Tremors: The Series. The show aired in 2003 on the Syfy Channel but was canceled after one season. A 60-minute pilot for a second television series also titled Tremors was filmed in 2017. However, no further episodes of this show were ever filmed. In popular culture * On March 21, 2012, the NBC Nightly News story \\"Shaken and awakened in Wisconsin\\" jokingly blamed the filming of a \\"Tremors remake\\" as the cause for unidentified loud booming noises. *\\"Bad Apple!\\", a 2013 episode of the superhero comedy series The Aquabats! Super Show!, features a scene of a giant underground worm attacking a desert farm which series co-creator Christian Jacobs noted was an homage to Tremors, with some shots mirroring those in the original film. * \\"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm\\", an episode of the second season of the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants, features a large worm known as the \\"Alaskan bull worm\\"; the worm is defeated when it tumbles off a cliff, similar to the death of the final graboid in Tremors.

The band took its self-mocking name from the publishing term \\"remaindered book\\", a work of which the unsold remainder of the publisher's stock of copies is sold at a reduced price. Their performances collectively raised $2 million for charity from their concerts. Band members included Dave Barry, Stephen King, Amy Tan, Cynthia Heimel, Sam Barry, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Joel Selvin, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount Jr., Barbara Kingsolver, Robert Fulghum, Matt Groening, Tad Bartimus, Greg Iles, Aron Ralston and honorary member Maya Angelou among others, as well as professional musicians such as multi-instrumentalist (and author) Al Kooper, drummer Josh Kelly, guitarist Roger McGuinn and saxophonist Erasmo Paulo. Founder Kathi Kamen Goldmark died on May 24, 2012, and the group disbanded a month later, following a memorial concert in her honor. History The Remainders was founded by Kathi Kamen Goldmark in 1992. Goldmark was then a musician whose day job was in book publicity. Through this, she met many prolific authors. One day while driving one of the authors around, she hit upon the idea of starting a band with them. It stuck. The Remainders' first performance was in 1992 at the American Booksellers Association convention in Anaheim, California. A review of the concert in The Washington Post referred to it as \\"the most heavily promoted musical debut since The Monkees.\\" The Remainders also played at the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1995. In April 2010, they began the Wordstock Tour presented by the Pearson Foundation and We Give Books, benefiting the children and schools of Haiti. The Remainders gave their last concert on June 23, 2012, at the annual conference of the American Library Association in Anaheim, where they played their first concert 20 years before. The event, co-sponsored by ProQuest, raised money for library and information science scholarships. The Remainders last performed together on the August 6, 2012, episode of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, on which both Stephen King and Dave Barry were guests (although the segment was taped in June 2012 when the band was in town for the ALA concert). In September 2014, it was announced that the Remainders would reunite to perform at the Tucson Festival of Books in March 2015. On March 15, 2015, the band's reunion was referenced in Merl Reagle's syndicated Sunday crossword puzzle. Titled \\"Book Notes,\\" the crossword included the band's name and several puns using names of writers who were members.

Financial services companies are present in all economically developed geographic locations and tend to cluster in local, national, regional and international financial centers such as London, New York City, and Tokyo. Financial Services Authority Seychelles logo on building  History  Change in access to a financial account or services between 2005 and 2014 by country The term \\"financial services\\" became more prevalent in the United States partly as a result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of the late 1990s, which enabled different types of companies operating in the U.S. financial services industry at that time to merge. Companies usually have two distinct approaches to this new type of business. One approach would be a bank which simply buys an insurance company or an investment bank, keeps the original brands of the acquired firm, and adds the acquisition to its holding company simply to diversify its earnings. Outside the U.S. (e.g. Japan), non-financial services companies are permitted within the holding company. In this scenario, each company still looks independent, and has its own customers, etc. In the other style, a bank would simply create its own brokerage division or insurance division and attempt to sell those products to its own existing customers, with incentives for combining all things with one company. Relationship to government The financial sector is traditionally among those to receive government support in times of widespread economic crisis. Such bailouts, however, enjoy less public support than those for other industries.The Economist, April 4th 2020, page 51. Banks=Commercial banking services A commercial bank is what is commonly referred to as simply a bank.

Recently a number of websites have been created to give consumers basic price comparisons for services such as insurance, causing controversy within the industry. *Insurance underwriting - Personal lines insurance underwriters actually underwrite insurance for individuals, a service still offered primarily through agents, insurance brokers, and stock brokers. Underwriters may also offer similar commercial lines of coverage for businesses. Activities include insurance and annuities, life insurance, retirement insurance, health insurance, and property insurance and casualty insurance. *Finance and insurance - a service still offered primarily at asset dealerships. The F&I; manager encompasses the financing and insuring of the asset which is sold by the dealer. F&I; is often called \\"the second gross\\" in dealerships who have adopted the model *Reinsurance - Reinsurance is insurance sold to insurers themselves, to protect them from catastrophic losses. The United States, followed by Japan and the United Kingdom are the largest insurance markets in the world. Other financial services *Angel investment networks - A group of angel investors can create their own network to be the financial foundation for future companies. *Credit card networking - Companies that serve as the bridge between the retailers and the banks who issue the bank cards. The four major credit card networks are: Mastercard, Visa Inc., American Express and Discover Financial. *Conglomerates - A financial services company, such as a universal bank, that is active in more than one sector of the financial services market e.g. life insurance, general insurance, health insurance, asset management, retail banking, wholesale banking, investment banking, etc. A key rationale for the existence of such businesses is the existence of diversification benefits that are present when different types of businesses are aggregated. As a consequence, economic capital for a conglomerate is usually substantially less than economic capital is for the sum of its parts. *Debt resolution - A consumer service that assists individuals that have too much debt to pay off as requested, but do not want to file bankruptcy and wish to pay off their debts owed. This debt can be accrued in various ways including but not limited to personal loans, credit cards or in some cases merchant accounts. Financial market utilities - Organizations that are part of the infrastructure of financial services, such as stock exchanges, clearing houses, derivative and commodity exchanges and payment systems such as real-time gross settlement systems or interbank networks. *Payment recovery - Assistance in recovering money inadvertently paid to vendors by businesses, such as by accidental duplicate payment of an invoice or failure to return a deposit. Financial exports A financial export is a financial service provided by a domestic firm (regardless of ownership) to a foreign firm or individual. While financial services such as banking, insurance and investment management are often seen as a domestic service, an increasing proportion of financial services are now being handled abroad, in other financial centres, for a variety of reasons. Some smaller financial centres, such as Bermuda, Luxembourg, and the Cayman Islands, lack sufficient size for a domestic financial services sector and have developed a role providing services to non-residents as offshore financial centres. The increasing competitiveness of financial services has meant that some countries, such as Japan, which were once self-sufficient, have increasingly imported financial services. The leading financial exporter, in terms of exports less imports, is the United Kingdom, which had $95 billion of financial exports in 2014. The UK's position is helped by both unique institutions (such as Lloyd's of London for insurance, the Baltic Exchange for shipping etc.); and an environment that attracts foreign firms; many international corporations have global or regional headquarters in the London and are listed on the London Stock Exchange, and many banks and other financial institutions operate there or in Edinburgh.

Lineage Born in 1346, he was the son of Richard Fitzalan, 3rd Earl of Arundel and Eleanor of Lancaster.G. E. C. The Complete Peerage p. 244-245 He succeeded his father to the title of Earl of Arundel on 24 January 1376. His brother was Thomas Arundel, the Bishop of Ely from 1374 to 1388, Archbishop of York from 1388 to 1397, and Archbishop of Canterbury in 1397 and from 1399 until his death in 1414.Powell, et al. The House of Lords p. 398 At the coronation of Richard II, Richard Fitzalan carried the crown. Admiral Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester; Thomas Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham; Henry, Earl of Derby (later Henry IV); and Thomas Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, demand Richard II to let them prove by arms the justice for their rebellion In 1377, Richard Fitzalan held the title of Admiral of the North and West. In this capacity, he attacked Harfleur at Whitsun 1378, but was forced to return to his ships by the defenders. Later, he and John of Gaunt attempted to seize Saint-Malo but were unsuccessful.Seward The Hundred Years War p. 124-125 Power Struggle Fitzalan was closely aligned with Thomas, Duke of Gloucester, who was uncle of King Richard II. Thomas was opposed to Richard II's desire for peace with France in the Hundred Years War and a power struggle ensued between him and Gloucester. In late 1386, Gloucester forced King Richard II to name himself and Richard Fitzalan to the King's Council.Seward The Hundred Years War p. 136-139 This Council was to all intents and purposes a Regency Council for Richard II. However, Richard limited the duration of the Council's powers to one year.Powell et al. The House of Lords p. 400-401 Knight of the Garter In 1386, Richard II named Richard Fitzalan Admiral of England and made him a Knight of the Garter. As Admiral of England, he defeated a Franco-Spanish-Flemish fleet off Margate in March 1387, along with Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham. New favourites In August 1387, the King dismissed Gloucester and Fitzalan from the Council and replaced them with his favourites - including the Archbishop of York, Alexander Neville; the Duke of Ireland, Robert de Vere; Michael de la Pole; the Earl of Suffolk, Sir Robert Tresilian, who was the Chief Justice; and the former Mayor of London Nicholas Brembre.Powell et al. The House of Lords p. 404 Radcot Bridge The King summoned Gloucester and Fitzalan to a meeting. However, instead of coming, they raised troops and defeated the new Council at Radcot Bridge on 22 December 1387. During that battle, they took the favourites prisoner. The next year, the Merciless Parliament condemned the favourites. FitzAlan was one of the Lords Appellant who accused and condemned Richard II's favorites. He made himself particularly odious to the King by refusing, along with Gloucester, to spare the life of Sir Simon de Burley who had been condemned by the Merciless Parliament. This was even after the queen, Anne of Bohemia, went down on her knees before them to beg for mercy. King Richard never forgave this humiliation and planned and waited for his moment of revenge. Arundel was named Governor of Brest in 1388. Opposed to peace Peace was concluded with France in 1389. However, Richard FitzAlan followed Gloucester's lead and stated that he would never agree with the peace that had been concluded. Marriage and children Arundel married twice. His first wife was Elizabeth de Bohun, daughter of William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton and Elizabeth de Badlesmere. They married around 28 September 1359 and had seven children: * Thomas Fitzalan, 5th Earl of Arundel * Lady Eleanor Fitzalan (c. 13651375), on 28 October 1371, at the age of about six, married Robert de Ufford. Died childless. * Elizabeth Fitzalan (c. 13668 July 1425), married first William Montacute (before December 1378); no issue. Married second, in 1384, Thomas Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk; had issue. Married third, before August 1401, Sir Robert Goushill of Hoveringham; had issue.

Had an affair with Cardinal Henry Beaufort, by whom she had an illegitimate daughter, Jane Beaufort. * Margaret Fitzalan, who married Sir Rowland Lenthall; by whom she had two sons. * William (or Richard) Fitzalan After the death of his first wife in 1385, Arundel married Philippa Mortimer, daughter of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March. Her mother was Philippa Plantagenet, the only daughter of Lionel of Antwerp and thus a granddaughter of Edward III. They had no children.  Death and succession  By 1394, Arundel was again a member of the royal council, and was involved in a quarrel with John of Gaunt, whom he accused in the parliament of that year. Fitzalan further antagonized the King by arriving late for the queen's funeral. Richard II, in a rage, snatched a wand and struck Fitzalan in the face and drew blood. Shortly after that, the King feigned a reconciliation but he was only biding his time for the right moment to strike. Arundel was persuaded by his brother Thomas to surrender himself and to trust to the king's clemency. On 12 July 1397, Richard was arrested for his opposition to Richard II, as well as plotting with Gloucester to imprison the king.Seward The Hundred Years War p. 142 He stood trial at Westminster and was attainted.Powell et al. The House of Lords p. 417 He was beheaded on 21 September 1397 and was buried in the church of the Augustin Friars, Bread Street, London. Tradition holds that his final words were said to the executioner, \\"Torment me not long, strike off my head in one blow\\".Thomas B. Costain The Last Plantagenets, page 200 In October 1400, the attainder was reversed, and Richard's son Thomas succeeded to his father's estates and honours.

M√§rklin & Cie. GmbH or M√§rklin (M√ÑRKLIN or MAERKLIN in capital letters) is a German toy company. The company was founded in 1859 and is based at G√∂ppingen in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Although it originally specialised in doll house accessories, today it is best known for model railways and technical toys. In some parts of Germany and in Sweden, the company's name is almost synonymous with model railways.  History  A carousel made by the company in 1911, from the collection of the Children's Museum of Indianapolis A simple M√§rklin model A coffee-table M√§rklin layout in Z scale (1:220). The locomotive is about 50 mm long. M√§rklin model steam engine in function. M√§rklin released its first wind-up train with carriages that ran on standardised track in 1891, noting that railway toys had the potential to follow the common practice of doll's houses, in which the initial purchase would be enhanced and expanded with more accessories for years after the initial purchase. To this end, M√§rklin offered additional rolling stock and track with which to expand its boxed sets. M√§rklin is responsible for the creation of several popular model railway gauges or scale, noteworthy exceptions being N scale and Wide gauge. In 1891, M√§rklin defined gauges 1-5 as standards for toy trains and presented them at the Leipzig Toy Fair. They soon became international standards. M√§rklin followed with 0 gauge (by some accounts as early as 1895 or as late as 1901), H0 scale in 1935, and the diminutive Z scale, 1:220, in 1972 -- smallest in the world for decades -- under the name Mini-Club (the scale of Z was assigned after the product line was introduced). Mini-Club was developed as M√§rklin's answer to Arnold Rapido's introduction of N gauge. Today, M√§rklin manufactures and markets trains and accessories in Gauge 1, H0 scale, and Z scale. In 1994 M√§rklin acquired the Nuremberg based model train manufacturer Trix producing DC-operated H0 and N scale. M√§rklin's older trains are considered highly collectible, and M√§rklin's current offerings enjoy premium status among hobbyists. Although M√§rklin is best known for its trains, from 1914 to 1999, the company produced mechanical construction sets similar to Meccano and Erector. Between 1967 and 1982, the company produced a slotcar system called M√§rklin Sprint. M√§rklin also produced numerous other toys over the years, including lithographed tinplate toy automobiles and boats. From 1909 until well into the 1950s they sold a range of alcohol-burning model steam engines. These were very educational toys, and could be linked to dynamos to provide lighting. In the late 1990s and M√§rklin purchased the assets of Trix in January 1997, thus adding N gauge to their scale lineup. On 11 May 2006, the company, which had until then been owned by the three families M√§rklin, Friz and Safft, was sold to the British investment group Kingsbridge Capital, with the support of the employees. The purchase price was approximately $38 million. At the time, M√§rklin had approximately $70.5 million in debt, as a result of several years of slumping sales. In 2007, the company expanded its product offering by buying the remaining assets of the bankrupt firm, Ernst Paul Lehmann Patentwerk, who owned the LGB brand and product line of G scale model railways. On 4 February 2009 M√§rklin filed for insolvency at the G√∂ppingen municipal court.M√§rklin meldet Insolvenz an In Spiegel Online vom 4. Feb. 2009 A year and a day later, on 5 February 2010, M√§rklin announced a return to profitability.M√§rklin erwirtschaftet wieder schwarze Zahlen in 2009 SammlerVz news, 6 February 2010 In 2013 M√§rklin was acquired by the Simba Dickie Group. On July 22, 2013 the managing director Stefan L√∂bich left M√§rklin.  The M√§rklin System  M√§rklin system with contact studs located in the middle of the tracks The M√§rklin system is the technique of using a third rail concealed in the roadbed with only small studs protruding through the ties of the track. The two outer rails are connected electrically. This provides the simplified wiring enjoyed by larger gauges‚Äîsuch as for reverse loops‚Äîwithout seriously detracting from the realism of the track because only two of the rails are visible. Because the two outer rails are not electrically isolated from each other, however, some do not consider M√§rklin's system to be a true three-rail system. However, older sections of 'M-Track' do have an actual conductor rail rather than studs. This older system is compatible with newer trains, although the reduced clearance for the pick-up shoe can sometimes cause running difficulties. The M√§rklin system has some incompatibility with other manufacturers' H0 trains. Because the wheels on M√§rklin's cars are not insulated, it causes shorts if its cars are used on other manufacturers' H0 track without changing the wheels. The profile of the wheels are also different (see also NEM 340). Additionally, for many years M√§rklin was the only brand that used AC for its H0 scale trains, although in the 60s Fleischmann, HAG, R√∂wa, Roco and others started producing trains for the M√§rklin system. Some people convert M√§rklin locomotives to DC for use on DC layouts, and by buying HAMO, M√§rklin had begun offering a line of DC locomotives as well, first under the name of HAMO and, after buying Trix, under that name. M√§rklin Digital locomotive  M√§rklin Digital  M√§rklin was among the early model railway companies to introduce a digital train-control system. The M√§rklin Digital system for M√§rklin's 3-rail AC train layouts was introduced in 1984 using Motorola microchips. A few years later the system developed jointly by M√§rklin, Lenz GmbH and Arnold GmbH was introduced for 2-rail DC locomotives. The system was used by Arnold in their N scale locomotives. While the first digital Z locomotives were announced in the late 1990s, the plans were cancelled rapidly due to heat dissipation problems in small locomotives. This digital control system was later developed into DCC (Digital Command Control). M√§rklin's digital system for 3 rail track is not directly compatible with DCC (Digital Command Control) although the systems are electrically compatible and many controllers can work both systems. Today M√§rklin offers DCC compatible locomotives for its 2-rail DC Trix brand.  Products and collectibles  M√§rklin model 33190.10, from set 2881; model of KPEV S10 nr. 1008, later DB 17 008; Schwartzkopff factory number 4760 Over the years, the M√§rklin marque became valuable to model train collectors, some of the very early models fetching impressive prices at auction. The range of products is extensive, and collectors also pay attention to packaging that were used for the products. Collectors also look for rare and hard to find models, such as the SBB Crocodile model, the AMTRAK ICE model, the Western Pacific 'California Zephyr' model, and the famous Union Pacific Big Boy model, among many others. The M√§rklin toy company systematically included a print run number on almost all their printed material, including the boxes in which their products shipped. These print run numbers indicate the printer and also the month and year of printing. This is useful for dating an item that is known to be associated with some printed material. The second group of digits indicates the catalogue number. The last set of numeric digits in the print run number indicates the month and year that the item was printed. The last group of letters identifies the printer. Koll's Preiskatalog issued by Joachim Koll in German lists all 00/H0 models and provides price estimates. M√§rklin's products are mainly German (DB) model trains. However, M√§rklin also produces Swiss (SBB), Dutch (NS), American (various independent railways from the Golden Age of American trains), and various other model trains from around the world. In January 2005, the M√§rklin museum in G√∂ppingen, Germany, was burgled and more than 100 pieces, with an estimated value of more than 1 million Euros, were stolen. The items, which included one-of-a-kind prototypes along with pieces that dated back to 1891, were recovered in March 2005. The third game in the Ticket to Ride board game series, released in 2006, was named Marklin in their honour.Boardgamegeek.com 24 November 2010 In 2010 M√§rklin announced the release of its sixth model of the Russian Railways, the Russian Velaro SAPSAN high speed train. The model is based upon the DB ICE 3MF model which began to be sold in 2008. The first S≈ΩD railways Russian HO models was a Transsiberian 100 –õ–µ–¢ –¢—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Å–∏–±–∏—Ä—Å–∫–æ–π (100 Let Transsibirskoy) tanker wagon, a rare limited edition from 1991, two locomotives, steam locomotive Series T–≠-5293 (M√§rklin ref. 34159), a second version of the same Cold War military reserve steam locomotive T–≠-3915 (M√§rklin ref. 37159) and two S≈ΩD car goods wagon sets (M√§rklin ref. 47897 and ref. 47899).  Nominal size H0  The largest segment of product range and sales is nominal size H0, with a scale of 1:87 and an H0 track. M√§rklin introduced it in 1935, about half a year later than Trix, and today it is the most common size worldwide. The company is market leader in H0 in German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), having a market-share of approximately 50 per cent. So, in the area of H0 tracks there are two categories of similar size - the track system with two conductors, produced by multiple companies on the one side, the middle-conductor track system dominated by M√§rklin on the other. Also, in this area M√§rklin is the only company to offer a complete assortment of goods - the range in this track size consists of a huge variety of rolling stock, tracks, analog as well as digital control systems, trolley systems and other accessory parts.

His books have sold over 39 million copies worldwide. Having achieved national recognition for sports writing in his early career, he is perhaps best known for the inspirational stories and themes that weave through his books, plays, and films. Albom lives with his wife Janine Sabino in Detroit, Michigan. Early life Albom was born on May 23, 1958 to a Jewish family in Passaic, New Jersey. He lived in Buffalo, New York for a little while until his family settled in Oaklyn, New Jersey, just outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He grew up in a small, middle-class neighborhood which most people never left. Albom was once quoted as saying that his parents were very supportive, and always used to say, \\"Don‚Äôt expect your life to finish here. There‚Äôs a big world out there. Go out and see it.\\" His older sister, younger brother and he himself all took that message to heart and traveled extensively. His siblings are currently settled in Europe. Columnist While living in New York, Albom developed an interest in journalism. Still supporting himself by working nights in the music industry, he began to write during the day for the Queens Tribune, a weekly newspaper in Flushing, New York. His work there helped earn him entry into the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. During his time there, to help pay his tuition he took work as a babysitter. In addition to nighttime piano playing, Albom took a part-time job with SPORT magazine. Upon graduation, he freelanced in that field for publications such as Sports Illustrated, GEO, and The Philadelphia Inquirer, and covered several Olympic sports events in Europe ‚Äì including track and field and luge ‚Äî paying his own way for travel, and selling articles once he was there. In 1983, he was hired as a full-time feature writer for The Fort Lauderdale News and Sun Sentinel, and eventually promoted to columnist. In 1985, having won that year's Associated Press Sports Editors award for best Sports News Story, Albom was hired as lead sports columnist for the Detroit Free Press to replace Mike Downey, a popular columnist who had taken a job with the Los Angeles Times. Albom's sports column quickly became popular. In 1989, when the Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News merged weekend publications, Albom was asked to add a weekly non- sports column to his duties. That column ran on Sundays in the \\"Comment\\" section and dealt with American life and values. It was eventually syndicated across the country. Both columns continue today in the Detroit Free Press. During his years in Detroit, he became one of the most award-winning sports writers of his era. He was named best sports columnist in the nation a record 13 times by the Associated Press Sports Editors and won best feature writing honors from that same organization a record seven times. No other writer has received the award more than once. He has won more than 200 other writing honors from organizations including the National Headliner Awards, the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, and National Association of Black Journalists. On June 25, 2010, Albom was awarded the APSE's Red Smith Award for lifetime achievement, presented at the annual APSE convention in Salt Lake City, Utah. The selection was heavily criticized by a number of Albom's peers, including fellow Red Smith Award winner Dave Kindred. In 2013, Albom was inducted into the National Sports Media Association (formerly the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association) Hall of Fame and his induction into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame was announced May 2017. Many of his columns have been collected into anthology books including Live Albom I (Detroit Free Press, 1988), Live Albom II (Detroit Free Press, 1990), Live Albom III (Detroit Free Press, 1992), and Live Albom IV (Detroit Free Press, 1995). Albom also serves as a contributing editor to Parade magazine. His column is syndicated by Tribune Content Agency. Fabrication scandal In 2005, Albom and four editors were briefly suspended from the Detroit Free Press, after Albom wrote a column that stated that two college basketball players were in the crowd at an NCAA tournament game when in fact they were not. In a column printed in the April 3, 2005 edition, Albom described two former Michigan State basketball players, both then in the NBA, attending an NCAA Final Four semifinal game on Saturday to cheer for their school. The players had told Albom they planned to attend, so Albom, filing on his normal Friday deadline but knowing the column could not come out until Sunday (after the game was over) wrote that the players were there. But the players' plans changed at the last minute and they did not attend the game. The Detroit Free Press also suspended the four editors who had read the column and allowed it to go to print. Albom was in attendance at the game, but the columnist failed to check on the two players‚Äô presence. A later internal investigation found no other similar instances in Albom's past columns, but did cite an editorial-wide problem of routinely using unattributed quotes from other sources. Carol Leigh Hutton, publisher of the Detroit Free Press at the time of the scandal, later told Buzzfeed that she regretted the way it was handled. \\"It was a stupid mistake that Mitch made that others failed to catch but not at all indicative of some problem that required the response we gave it. I allowed myself to believe that we were doing this highly credible, highly transparent thing, when really in hindsight what I think we were doing was acquiescing to people who were taking advantage of a stupid mistake.\\" Author=Sports books Albom's first non- anthology book was Bo: Life, Laughs, and the Lessons of a College Football Legend (Warner Books), an autobiography of football coach Bo Schembechler co- written with the coach. The book was published in August 1989 and became Albom's first New York Times bestseller. Albom's next book was Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, The American Dream, a look into the starters on the University of Michigan men's basketball team that reached the NCAA championship game as freshmen in 1992 and again as sophomores in 1993. The book was published in November 1993 and also became a New York Times bestseller. Tuesdays with Morrie Albom's breakthrough book came about after he was rotating the TV channels and viewed Morrie Schwartz's interview with Ted Koppel on ABC News Nightline in 1995, in which Schwartz, a sociology professor, spoke about living and dying with a terminal disease, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease). Albom, who was close to Schwartz during his college years at Brandeis University, felt guilty about not keeping in touch so he reconnected with his former professor, visiting him in suburban Boston and eventually coming every Tuesday for discussions about life and death. Albom, seeking a way to pay for Schwartz's medical bills, sought out a publisher for a book about their visits. Although rejected by numerous publishing houses, Doubleday accepted the idea shortly before Schwartz's death as Albom was able to fulfill his wish to pay Schwartz's bills. Tuesdays with Morrie, chronicled Albom's time spent with his professor, was published in 1997. The initial printing was 20,000 copies. As word of mouth grew, the book sales slowly increased and landed the book a brief appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, nudging the book onto the New York Times bestseller's list in October 1997. It steadily climbed, reaching the number- one position six months later. It remained on the New York Times bestseller list for 205 weeks. One of the top selling memoirs of all time, Tuesdays With Morrie has sold over 14 million copies and has been translated into 45 languages. Oprah Winfrey produced a television movie adaptation by the same name for ABC, starring Hank Azaria as Albom and Jack Lemmon as Morrie. It was the most-watched TV movie of 1999 and won four Emmy Awards. The Five People You Meet in Heaven After the success of Tuesdays with Morrie, Albom's follow-up was the fiction book The Five People You Meet in Heaven (Hyperion Books) which he published in September 2003. Although released six years after Tuesdays With Morrie, the book was a fast success and again launched Albom onto the New York Times best-seller list. The Five People You Meet in Heaven sold over 10 million copies in 38 territories and in 35 languages. In 2004, it became a television movie for ABC, starring Jon Voight, Ellen Burstyn, Michael Imperioli, and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Lloyd Kramer, the film was critically acclaimed and the most watched TV movie of the year, with 18.7 million viewers.About The Real Eddie. Mitch Albom Official Website For One More Day Albom's second novel, For One More Day (Hyperion), was published in 2006. The hardcover edition spent nine months on the New York Times Bestseller list after debuting at the top spot. It also reached No. 1 on the USA Today and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. It was the first book to be sold by Starbucks in the launch of the Book Break Program in the fall of 2006. It has been translated into 26 languages. On December 9, 2007, ABC television aired the 2-hour television event motion picture Oprah Winfrey Presents: Mitch Albom's For One More Day, which starred Michael Imperioli and Ellen Burstyn. Burstyn received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her role as Posey Benetto. For One More Day is about a son who gets to spend a day with his mother, who died eight years earlier. Charley \\"Chick\\" Benetto is a retired baseball player who, facing the pain of unrealized dreams, alcoholism, divorce, and an estrangement from his grown daughter, returns to his childhood home and attempts suicide. There he meets his long dead mother, who welcomes him as if nothing ever happened. The book explores the question, \\"What would you do if you had one more day with someone you‚Äôve lost?\\" Albom has said his relationship with his own mother was largely behind the story of that book, and that several incidents in For One More Day are actual events from his childhood. Have a Little Faith Have a Little Faith, Albom's first nonfiction book since Tuesdays With Morrie, was released on September 29, 2009, through Hyperion publishing, and recounts Albom's experiences that led to him writing the eulogy for Albert L. Lewis, a Rabbi from his hometown in New Jersey. The book is written in the same vein as Tuesdays With Morrie, in which the main character, Mitch, goes through several heartfelt conversations with the Rabbi in order to better know and understand the man that he would one day eulogize. Through this experience, Albom writes, his own sense of faith was reawakened, leading him to make contact with Henry Covington, the African-American pastor of the I Am My Brother's Keeper church, in Detroit, where Albom was then living. Covington, a past drug addict, dealer, and ex- convict, ministered to a congregation of largely homeless men and women in a church so poor that the roof leaked when it rained. From his relationships with these two very different men of faith, Albom writes about the difference faith can make in the world. On November 27, 2011, ABC aired the Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie based on the book. The Time Keeper This work focuses on the inventor of the world's first clock, who is punished for trying to measure God's greatest gift. He is banished to a cave for centuries and forced to listen to the voices of all who came after him seeking more days and years. Eventually, with his soul nearly broken, Father Time is granted his freedom, along with a magical hourglass and a mission: a chance to redeem himself by teaching two earthly people the true meaning of time. He returns to our world now dominated by the hour and commences a journey with two unlikely partners: a teenage girl who is about to give up on life and a wealthy old businessman who wants to live forever. To save himself, he must save them both. The First Phone Call from Heaven In 2013, Albom moved to a new publisher, HarperCollins, for the publication of his seventh book and fourth novel. In The First Phone Call From Heaven, the small town of Coldwater, Michigan is thrust into the international spotlight when its citizens suddenly start receiving phone calls from deceased loved ones. Is it the greatest miracle ever or a massive hoax? Sully Harding, a grief-stricken single father recently released from prison, is determined to find the truth. The town is fictional, and not the real Coldwater, Michigan, but Albom pays tribute to the real small town in the book's acknowledgements. The First Phone Call from Heaven received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly and Library Journal. The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto In 2015, Albom's fifth novel, The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto, was published by HarperCollins. His longest book at almost 400 pages, it chronicles the life and mysterious death of the fictional musician Frankie Presto, as narrated by the voice of Music. An orphan born in a burning church in Spain in 1936, Frankie is blessed with musical ability. At nine years old, Frankie is sent to America in the bottom of a boat. His only possession is an old guitar and six precious strings. His Forrest Gump-like journey takes him through the musical landscape of the 20th century, from classical to jazz to rock and roll super stardom, meeting and working with other greats like Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Carole King, Little Richard, and even The Beatles. Real musicians, including Tony Bennett, Wynton Marsalis, Paul Stanley, Darlene Love, and Ingrid Michaelson, lent their names to first-person passages to the book. An original 17-song soundtrack for the book was released by Republic Records four days before the book's release. It featured original songs written and performed by Albom and other artists including Sawyer Fredericks, Mat Kearney, Ingrid Michaelson, John Pizzarelli, and James Brent, interpreting Frankie Presto's \\"greatest hits,\\" along with such older favorites featured in the novel such as Tony Bennett's \\"Lost in the Stars\\" and Dionne Warwick's \\"A House is Not a Home.\\" The Next Person You Meet in Heaven A sequel to The Five People You Meet in Heaven, the novel tells the story of Eddie's heavenly reunion with Annie, the little girl he saved on earth in the first book. The story strongly emphasizes on how lives and losses intersect, and that not only does every life matter, but that every ending is also a new beginning. The book debuted at the top of the New York Times bestseller list. Finding Chika Albom's return to nonfiction for the first time in a decade. It is a memoir and a tribute to Chika, a young Haitian orphan who arrived at Albom's Have Faith Haiti Orphanage in Port Au Prince before being diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor and passing away two years later. An excerpt will be read by Albom on the new Lit Hub/Podglomerate Storybound (podcast), accompanied by an original score from musician Maiah Wynne. Radio host Albom began on radio in 1987 on WLLZ- Detroit, a now-defunct Active Rock radio station. He worked on the station's morning program as a sports commentator, and started a Sunday night sports- talk program, The Sunday Sports Albom in 1988, believed to be one of the first sports talks shows to ever air on FM radio. In 1996, he moved to WJR, a powerful, clear-channel station in Detroit, where he broadcasts a five-day a week general talk show with an emphasis on entertainment, writing, current events and culture. He has been honored by the Michigan Association of Broadcasters as the top afternoon talk show host, and was voted best talk show host in Detroit by Hour Detroit magazine. In 2001, the show was televised nationally in a simulcast by MSNBC. Albom continues to do the show from 5 to 7 p.m. ET. Following his Monday show, he hosts an hour-long sports talk show called, \\"The Monday Sports Albom\\". Television Albom appeared regularly on ESPN's The Sports Reporters (aired Sunday mornings from Studio A in Bristol, CT at ESPN Plaza at 9:00am EST) and regularly appears on SportsCenter. He has also made appearances on Costas Now, The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Today Show, CBS‚Äôs The Early Show, ABC‚Äôs Good Morning America, Dr. Phil, Larry King Live, The View, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, and appeared as a guest voice on The Simpsons on the episode Thursdays with Abie in 2010. Playwright On November 19, 2002, the stage version of Tuesdays with Morrie opened Off Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theatre. Co-authored by Mitch Albom and Jeffrey Hatcher (Three Viewings) and directed by David Esbjornson (The Goat or Who Is Sylvia?). Tuesdays with Morrie starred Alvin Epstein (original Lucky in Waiting for Godot) as Morrie and Jon Tenney (The Heiress) as Mitch. His follow-up to the stage adaptation of Tuesdays were two original comedies that premiered at the Purple Rose Theatre Company, in Chelsea, Michigan, a theater started by actor Jeff Daniels. Duck Hunter Shoots Angel (The Purple Rose's highest grossing play as of 2008) and And the Winner Is have both been produced nationwide, with the latter having its West Coast premiere at the Laguna Playhouse in Laguna Beach, California. The premiere of Albom's Ernie, a play dedicated to the memory of famed Detroit Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell, occurred in April 2011 at the City Theatre in Detroit. In subsequent years the play travelled to theaters in Traverse City, East Lansing, and Grand Rapids. It has run for seven summer seasons as of 2017. In the summer of 2016, Albom debuted his first musical at the City Theatre with \\"Hockey - The Musical!\\" A musical comedy with a book, original songs and parody lyrics written by Albom, \\"Hockey - The Musical!\\" follows five characters who work to convince God to spare hockey after concluding that the world has too many sports and one should be eliminated. An opening night review in The Detroit Free Press describe an \\"audience roaring for most of the 90 minutes\\" Musician Albom is an accomplished songwriter, pianist and lyricist. In 1992, he wrote the song \\"Cookin' For Two\\" for a television movie, Christmas in Connecticut, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The song was nominated for The CableACE Award. Albom has been featured on the cover of Making Music Magazine. He also wrote the song \\"Hit Somebody (The Hockey Song)\\", which was recorded by singer/songwriter Warren Zevon, with David Letterman on backup vocals. The song was released as a single in Canada and will be adapted into a film by director Kevin Smith. He currently performs with the Rock Bottom Remainders, a band of writers that also features Dave Barry, Stephen King, Ridley Pearson, Amy Tan, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, Sam Barry, and Scott Turow. Their performances raise funds for various children's literacy projects across the country. In July 2013, Albom co-authored Hard Listening (Coliloquy, 2013) with the rest of the Rock Bottom Remainders. The ebook combines essays, fiction, musings, candid email exchanges, and conversations, compromising photographs, audio, and video clips, and interactive quizzes to give readers a view into the private lives of the authors. Charity work \\"The Dream Fund,\\" established in 1989, provides a scholarship for disadvantaged children to study the arts. \\"A Time to Help\\", started in 1998, is a Detroit volunteer group \\"S.A.Y. (Super All Year) Detroit \\"is an umbrella program that funds shelters and cares for the homeless.\\" It is now a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that funds numerous homeless shelters throughout the Metro Detroit area. His most recent effort, A Hole in the Roof Foundation, helps faith groups of different denominations who care for the homeless repair the spaces they use. Their first project was the I Am My Brother's Keeper roof in the crumbling but vibrant Detroit church, completed in December 2009. The second project, completed in April 2010, was the rebuilding of the Caring and Sharing Mission and Orphanage in Port-au- Prince, Haiti. Albom also directs the Have Faith Haiti Mission, a project whose stated objective is \\"dedicated to the safety, education, health and spiritual development of Haiti‚Äôs impoverished children and orphans\\", incorporating language lessons and Christian prayer. Other During a Detroit Free Press strike in 1995 Albom crossed the picket line and returned to work. In 1999, Albom was named National Hospice Organization's Man of the Year. In 2000, at the Emmy Awards, Albom was personally thanked by actor Jack Lemmon during his acceptance speech for his Emmy for Best Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries for Tuesdays With Morrie. It would be Lemmon's last major acting role. In February 2003, Albom was called to testify at Chris Webber's perjury trial. Webber had been a member of the University of Michigan's basketball teams of the early 1990s. He was a member of the \\"Fab Five\\" players, the subject of a book by Albom. Webber and three other Wolverines who played in the 1990s were alleged to have received over $290,000 in improper loans from a man considered to be a booster of the University of Michigan, although amounts were never verified. The four other Fab Five members were not implicated and the school was cleared of any direct involvement or knowledge of the loans, which were made to players and their families.. On November 22, 2005, Albom was the sole and final guest on Ted Koppel's farewell appearance on ABC's Nightline. Koppel had gotten to know Albom through his broadcasts with Morrie Schwartz and the final program dealt with the legacy of those shows and Albom's book. On October 22, 2007, Albom appeared with former New York Governor Mario Cuomo and Tony Bennett in An Evening with Tony Bennett to honor the release of Bennett's Tony Bennett In The Studio: A Life of Art and Music, for which Albom wrote the foreword. On May 30, 2017, Albom was one of eight new inductees announced for the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in Detroit. The ceremony took place on September 15, 2017.

History George Winn, an ex-slave, founded the Guthrie congregation at Guthrie in 1905. Its early work toward racial integration gained it the pejorative title The Church of God (Holstein). The congregation at Guthrie hosts the Oklahoma State campmeeting each May and the Oklahoma State assembly meeting each December. In 2003, the Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma) had 43 congregations in 18 states in the United States; (the largest concentrations being in Oklahoma and California). The church does not keep membership rolls. Faith and Victory (founded 1923) is a monthly (11 months per year) publication of the church. Through mission efforts the church has extended into at least 11 other countries outside of the U.S. Theology and practices This body attempts to closely follow the teachings of The Bible. They see an example in spiritual leaders such as Daniel Sidney Warner and others that were instrumental in bringing about the \\"Evening Light Reformation.\\" They believe that God began to restore the church to the standards and light of the early morning church era through Warner and others in 1880. The Guthrie congregation and associated congregations are from a minority group that dissolved fellowship with Church of God (Anderson) as a result of controversies that arose regarding liberal versus conservative issues during the years 1910-1917. This minority felt that the majority was compromising the original teachings of the Evening Light Reformation and chose to remain with what they believed to be the original standards. They felt that this could easily be ascertained by comparing the teachings of the Anderson Movement at that time with the original writings of the Evening Light Reformation. Although Guthrie is home to one of the larger congregations in this fellowship, Guthrie is not the headquarters. The church teaches that Christ is the head of the church and that the headquarters is in heaven. An ecclesiastical hierarchy with one man having the preeminence over others is considered man-rule and not the pattern described in the Bible for church leadership. The doctrines and practices of the church reflect those of the Church of God (Anderson) in its earlier days. In comparison, the church maintains a stronger emphasis on outward, practical holiness and separation from cultural trends of the world than the present Anderson Movement. Sanctification is held as a second work of grace after justification by faith. In keeping with the standard of holiness, a ministerial statement was issued in 1959 taking a stand against people in leadership positions in the church having televisions in their homes. The church teaches that the committing of willful sin, and that alone, disqualifies someone from being a member. Practices of the church include baptism by immersion, the Lord's supper, feet washing, lifting up holy hands, anointing with oil, divine healing, fasting and a cappella singing. Teaching on the end of time is that the second coming of the Lord represents the end of the world and the end of life on the world for all people, both good and evil, without there being a one thousand-year reign on earth or second chance for the wicked to repent. Free-will offering is taught rather than tithing, and the ministry believes in living by faith rather than accepting salaries. Camp A campground for church of God meetings was built at Monark Springs, Missouri. The original tabernacle was constructed in 1940, and has been expanded more than once. The tabernacle at Monark is still in use today for the national Church of God campmeeting, with attendance from a number of States and international locations. The Monark campmeeting begins the third Friday of each July and continues for 10 days. The grounds include dining and sleeping facilities. The Church of God ministry believes in Holy Spirit leadership in the services, allowing liberty for calling of songs, testimonies, and preaching in the general services, as the Lord leads rather than following a prepared schedule. Special services are usually set aside for missionary reports, for observance of foot-washing and the Lord‚Äôs supper, and for healing of the sick. The healing service coincides with fast day. Two meetings are held in Guthrie each year - the Oklahoma State Campmeeting toward the end of May and the Assembly meeting toward the end of December. Both are ten-day meetings. Other major meetings are held in California, West Virginia, and Louisiana each year.

The cycle of four Lieder for medium voice (often performed by women as well as men) was written around 1884‚Äì85 in the wake of Mahler's unhappy love for soprano Johanna Richter, whom he met while conductor of the opera house in Kassel, Germany,Seckerson, Edward. Mahler. Omnibus Press, 1984. p. 30. and orchestrated and revised in the 1890s. Introduction The work's compositional history is complex and difficult to trace. Mahler appears to have begun composing the songs in December 1884 and to have completed them in 1885. He subjected the score to a great deal of revision, probably between 1885 and 1886, and some time in the early 1890s orchestrated the original piano accompaniments. As a result of this situation, various discrepancies exist between the different sources. It appears to have been in the orchestral version that the cycle was first performed on 16 March 1896 by the Dutch baritone Anton Sistermans with the Berlin Philharmonic and Mahler conducting, but possible indications of an earlier voice-and-piano performance cannot be discounted. The work was published in 1897 and is one of Mahler's best-known compositions. The lyrics are by the composer himself, though they are influenced by Des Knaben Wunderhorn, a collection of German folk poetry that was one of Mahler's favorite books, and the first song is actually based on the Wunderhorn poem \\"Wann [sic] mein Schatz\\". There are strong connections between this work and Mahler's First Symphony, with the main theme of the second song being the main theme of the 1st Movement and the final verse of the 4th song reappearing in the 3rd Movement as a contemplative interruption of the funeral march.Proms Programme Note Contents=I ‚Äì \\"Wenn mein Schatz Hochzeit macht\\" (\\"When My Sweetheart is Married\\") The first movement is entitled \\"Wenn mein Schatz Hochzeit macht\\" (\\"When My Sweetheart is Married\\"), and the text discusses the Wayfarer's grief at losing his love to another. He remarks on the beauty of the surrounding world, but how that cannot keep him from having sad dreams. The orchestral texture is bittersweet, using double reed instruments, clarinets and strings. It begins in D minor and ends in G minor. :Wenn mein Schatz Hochzeit macht, :Fr√∂hliche Hochzeit macht, :Hab' ich meinen traurigen Tag! :Geh' ich in mein K√§mmerlein, :Dunkles K√§mmerlein, :Weine, wein' um meinen Schatz, :Um meinen lieben Schatz! :Bl√ºmlein blau! Verdorre nicht! :V√∂glein s√º√ü! :Du singst auf gr√ºner Heide. :Ach, wie ist die Welt so sch√∂n! :Zik√ºth! Zik√ºth! :Singet nicht! Bl√ºhet nicht! :Lenz ist ja vorbei! :Alles Singen ist nun aus! :Des Abends, wenn ich schlafen geh', :Denk' ich an mein Leide! :An mein Leide! II ‚Äì \\"Ging heut' Morgen √ºber's Feld\\" (\\"I Went This Morning over the Field\\") The second movement, \\"Ging heut' Morgen √ºber's Feld\\" (\\"I Went This Morning over the Field\\"), contains the happiest music of the work. Indeed, it is a song of joy and wonder at the beauty of nature in simple actions like birdsong and dew on the grass. \\"Is it not a lovely world?\\" is a refrain. However, the Wayfarer is reminded at the end that despite this beauty, his happiness will not blossom anymore now that his love is gone. This movement is orchestrated delicately, making use of high strings and flutes, as well as a fair amount of triangle. The melody of this movement, as well as much of the orchestration, was later reused by Mahler and developed into the 'A' theme of the first movement of his First Symphony. It begins in D major and ends in F-sharp major. :Ging heut' Morgen √ºber's Feld, :Tau noch auf den Gr√§sern hing; :Sprach zu mir der lust'ge Fink: :\\"Ei du! Gelt? Guten Morgen! Ei gelt? :Du! Wird's nicht eine sch√∂ne Welt? :Zink! Zink! Sch√∂n und flink! :Wie mir doch die Welt gef√§llt!\\" :Auch die Glockenblum' am Feld :Hat mir lustig, guter Ding', :Mit den Gl√∂ckchen, klinge, kling, :Ihren Morgengru√ü geschellt: :\\"Wird's nicht eine sch√∂ne Welt? :Kling, kling! Sch√∂nes Ding! :Wie mir doch die Welt gef√§llt! Heia!\\" :Und da fing im Sonnenschein :Gleich die Welt zu funkeln an; :Alles Ton und Farbe gewann :Im Sonnenschein! :Blum' und Vogel, gro√ü und Klein! :\\"Guten Tag, ist's nicht eine sch√∂ne Welt? :Ei du, gelt? Sch√∂ne Welt!\\" :Nun f√§ngt auch mein Gl√ºck wohl an? :Nein, nein, das ich mein', :Mir nimmer bl√ºhen kann! III ‚Äì \\"Ich hab' ein gl√ºhend Messer\\" (\\"I Have a Gleaming Knife\\") The third movement is a full display of despair. Entitled \\"Ich hab' ein gl√ºhend Messer\\" (\\"I Have a Gleaming Knife\\"), the Wayfarer likens his agony of lost love to having an actual metal blade piercing his heart. He obsesses to the point where everything in the environment reminds him of some aspect of his love, and he wishes he actually had the knife. Note: while the translation of \\"gl√ºhend\\" as gleaming is not totally incorrect, \\"gleaming\\" misses an important point: \\"gl√ºhend\\" includes an element of heat, as in \\"glowing with heat\\"; a potentially better translation might be any of \\"glowing\\", \\"burning\\", scorching\\". This isn't just a bright- looking (i.e. gleaming\\") knife, but one that burns and scorches... Consult e.g. the PONS online dictionary for translations of \\"gl√ºhend\\". The music is intense and driving, fitting to the agonized nature of the Wayfarer's obsession. It begins in D minor and ends in E-flat minor. :Ich hab' ein gl√ºhend Messer, :Ein Messer in meiner Brust, :O weh! Das schneid't so tief :in jede Freud' und jede Lust. :Ach, was ist das f√ºr ein b√∂ser Gast! :Nimmer h√§lt er Ruh', :nimmer h√§lt er Rast, :Nicht bei Tag, noch bei Nacht, :wenn ich schlief! :O weh! :Wenn ich den Himmel seh', :Seh' ich zwei blaue Augen stehn! :O weh! Wenn ich im gelben Felde geh', :Seh' ich von fern das blonde Haar :Im Winde weh'n! :O weh! :Wenn ich aus dem Traum auffahr' :Und h√∂re klingen ihr silbern Lachen, :O weh! :Ich wollt', ich l√§g' auf der Schwarzen Bahr', :K√∂nnt' nimmer die Augen aufmachen! IV ‚Äì \\"Die zwei blauen Augen von meinem Schatz\\" (\\"The Two Blue Eyes of my Beloved\\") The final movement culminates in a resolution. The music, also reused in the First Symphony (in the slow movement), is subdued and gentle, lyrical and often reminiscent of a chorale in its harmonies. Its title, \\"Die zwei blauen Augen von meinem Schatz\\" (\\"The Two Blue Eyes of my Beloved\\"), deals with how the image of those eyes has caused the Wayfarer so much grief that he can no longer stand to be in the environment. He describes lying down under a linden tree, finding rest for the first time and allowing the flowers to fall on him; and somehow (beyond his own comprehension) everything was well again: \\"Everything: love and grief, and world, and dream!\\" It begins in E minor and ends in F minor. :Die zwei blauen Augen von meinem Schatz, :Die haben mich in die weite Welt geschickt. :Da mu√üt ich Abschied nehmen vom allerliebsten Platz! :O Augen blau, warum habt ihr mich angeblickt? :Nun hab' ich ewig Leid und Gr√§men! :Ich bin ausgegangen in stiller Nacht :wohl √ºber die dunkle Heide. :Hat mir niemand Ade gesagt :Ade! :Mein Gesell' war Lieb und Leide! :Auf der Stra√üe steht ein Lindenbaum, :Da hab' ich zum ersten Mal im Schlaf geruht! :Unter dem Lindenbaum, :Der hat seine Bl√ºten √ºber mich geschneit, :Da wu√üt' ich nicht, wie das Leben tut, :War alles, alles wieder gut! :Alles! Alles, Lieb und Leid :Und Welt und Traum! Translation of the title Although Songs of a Wayfarer is the title by which the cycle is generally known in English, Fritz Spiegl has observed that German \\"Geselle\\" actually means \\"journeyman\\", i.e., one who has completed an apprenticeship with a master in a trade or craft, but is not yet a master himself; journeymen in German-speaking countries traditionally traveled from town to town to gain experience with various masters. A more accurate translation, therefore, would be Songs of a Travelling Journeyman. The title hints at an autobiographical aspect of the work; as a young, newly qualified conductor (and budding composer), Mahler was himself at this time in a stage somewhere between 'apprentice' and recognized 'master' and had been moving from town to town (Bad Hall, Laibach, Olm√ºtz, Vienna, Kassel). All the while, he was honing his skills and learning from masters in his field.

They are therefore clumsy in water (compared e.g. with the Dytiscidae or Hydrophilidae), and prefer to get around by crawling. The family consists of about 200 species in 5 genera, distributed wherever there is freshwater habitat; it is the only extant member of superfamily Haliploidea. They are also known as crawling water beetles or haliplids. Description The imagines of these beetles are generally oval in shape, with a very convex upperside, and are generally long. They are generally yellowish to light brown in color, frequently with light and dark patterns dotted with 10 or more rows of punctures on the elytra. The family's most distinctive characteristic is the large coxal plates of the hindlegs, which are immobile (though not fused in the centerline) and extend back along the underside to cover most of the abdomen base and the hindleg trochanters and femora. They are used as air storage supplementing the air carried under the elytra. The compound eyes are markedly protruding from a smallish head, which bears antennae with 11 segments set upon an antennophore with a conspicuously short base (scapus). The extension of the prosternum is broad, with a truncated tip, ending adjacent to the metasternal process. The metasternum has a complete transverse ridge. The slender legs have long swimming hairs on tibiae and tarsi, but are not flattened into \\"flippers\\". The foreleg tibiae lack the apparatus for antenna cleaning present in many other beetles. Unlike in other Adephaga, the hindwings are not folded under the elytra, but rolled together apically. Haliplidae larvae have a long and slender body with a tough exoskeleton. They can be recognized by their specialized mouthparts, carried on a small head. The maxillae and labium are adapted to manipulating the algae the larvae feed on, while the mandibles contain a channel through which fluids are sucked out of the food. The larval legs are short and carry a single claw each, but the forelegs have various adaptations for climbing among water plants. Respiration is via gills which are either long and filamentous, or (in Peltodytes) short microtracheal extensions; they are carried on the tergites of all sternal and all but the tenth (last) abdominal segments. The latter may be absent, but in the larvae of some Haliplidae it is tapering and ends in two prongs (which are not urogomphi though). The last (third) instar has functional spiracles on the mesothorax and the first to seventh abdominal segments. Ecology Haliplids live in the aquatic vegetation around the edges of small ponds, lakes, and quiet streams. Adults are omnivorous, eating insect eggs, small crustaceans, hydrozoan polyps, and algae, while the larvae eat only algae. The species of Peltodytes deposit eggs on the surface of aquatic plants, while Haliplus chews out a cavity in the plants for their eggs. There are three instars, and pupation takes place on land in a chamber constructed by the larva. Crawling water beetles are not extensively studied because their interaction with humans is minimal. Hungerford's crawling water beetle (Brychius hungerfordi) is an endangered species found only in Michigan and Ontario. Systematics The classification of haliplids as a separate group of Adephaga is unquestioned, and most entomologists believe they developed from terrestrial beetles separately from other types of water beetles. For many decades, the family was in need of revision, the last general catalog being published by A. Zimmermann in 1920. B. J. van Vondel produced an updated catalogue of the known Haliplidae taxa. Like predaceous diving beetles (Dytiscidae), the crawling water beetles form an early offshoot of the Adephaga. They still have grooved maxillae and their tentoriolacinial muscle does not attach to the mesal stipial base. Their larvae, like those of predaceous diving beetles, do not possess eggshell-bursters on the head. It is not yet resolved whether Haliplidae and Dytiscidae are closest relatives, or whether they originated independently from the basal Adephaga. Genera The family is not very diverse, with only five genera accepted.Haliplidae Species List at Joel Hallan's Biology Catalog. Texas A&M; University. Retrieved on 10 May 2012. Of these, Peltodytes is probably the most ancestral, though it has a number of autapomorphies. The others have more synapomorphies in common; Haliplus is the more diverse and appears to include some minor lineages formerly considered independent genera.

He was the founder of the law firm Shidler McBroom & Gates (a predecessor of K&L; Gates), and also served as president of both the Seattle King County and Washington State Bar associations. He was the father of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Early life Gates was born in Bremerton, Washington, in 1925, and was the son of Lillian Elizabeth (Rice) and William Henry Gates, a furniture store owner. He graduated from Bremerton High School. Gates served in the US Army for three years during World War II. He subsequently attended the University of Washington under the G.I. Bill, earning a B.A. in 1949 and a J.D. degree in 1950. While at UW, he was a member of the Chi Psi fraternity. Career Gates co-founded the law firm Shidler McBroom & Gates in 1964, which later became a part of Preston Gates & Ellis LLP (PGE). He practiced with the firm until 1998, when it was merged into the firm now known as K&L; Gates. During his career he served as president of both the Seattle/King County Bar Association and the Washington State Bar Association. Gates served on the boards of numerous organizations in the Pacific Northwest, including the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce, King County United Way and Planned Parenthood. In 1995 he founded the Technology Alliance, whose mission is to expand technology-based employment in Washington. In 1998, Gates retired from Preston Gates & Ellis. He served for 15 years on the Board of Regents for the University of Washington, and until his death was a co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which his son Bill and his daughter-in-law Melinda founded. He served as a director for the bulk retail corporation Costco Wholesale from 2003, and was a founding co-chair of the Pacific Health Summit. He served as an Honorary Chair for the World Justice Project. The project works to lead a global, multidisciplinary effort to strengthen the Rule of Law for the development of communities of opportunity and equity. Gates co- authored the book Wealth and Our Commonwealth: Why America Should Tax Accumulated Fortunes with Chuck Collins. It is a defense of the policies promoted by the estate tax. He was also the author of the book Showing Up for Life: Thoughts on the Gifts of a Lifetime. Personal life In 1951, Gates married Mary Maxwell Gates (1929‚Äì1994), whom he met at the University of Washington (UW), and they remained married until her death in 1994.

The Interior Plains are a vast physiographic region that spreads across the Laurentian craton of central North America, extending from the Gulf Coast region to the Arctic Ocean along the east flank of the Rocky Mountains. In Canada, it separates the Rocky Mountains from the Canadian Shield, while in the U.S., it includes the Great Plains of the west and the Tallgrass prairie region to the south of the Great Lakes extending east to the Appalachian Plateau region. Geology and physiography This area was originally formed when cratons collided and welded together 1.8-1.9 billion years ago in the Trans-Hudson orogeny during the Paleoproterozoic Era. Precambrian metamorphic and igneous rocks now form the basement of the Interior Plains and make up the stable nucleus of North America. With the exception of the Black Hills of South Dakota, the entire region has low relief, reflecting more than 500 million years of relative tectonic stability. The Interior Plains were often covered by shallow inland seas. Sediments from the shield and the Rocky Mountains were deposited in these seas over millions of years. Eventually, the sediments were compressed by the weight of the layers above into sedimentary rock. Part of the sedimentary rock deposited in these areas consists of coral reefs that formed close to the surface of seas during the Paleozoic Era. Paleozoic and Mesozoic Throughout the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, the mostly low-lying Interior Plains region remained relatively unaffected by the mountain-building tectonic collisions occurring on margins of the continent. During much of the Mesozoic Era, the North American continental interior were mostly well above sea level, with two major exceptions. During part of the Jurassic, rising seas flooded the low-lying areas of the continent, forming the Sundance Sea; in the Cretaceous, much of the Interior Plains region lay submerged beneath the Western Interior Seaway. Cenozoic The Interior Plains continued to receive deposits from the eroding Rocky Mountains to the west and Appalachian and Ozark/Ouachita Mountains to the east and south throughout the era. The flatness of the Interior Plains is a reflection of the platform of mostly flat-lying marine and stream deposits laid down in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras.

Origins Born in about 1403, he was the son of Sir Robert Wingfield (died 1409) by his wife Elizabeth Russell, daughter of Sir John Russell (d.1405), of Strensham in Worcestershire and his first wife Agnes. The elder Robert was son of Sir John Wingfield and his wife Margaret Hastings (died 1397), later second wife of Russell. As guardian of her son, it was Russell who arranged the marriage of Robert to his daughter Elizabeth. He is thought to have been kin, although the precise nature of the relationship is unknown, to Sir John de Wingfield (fl.c.1350) of Wingfield Castle in Suffolk, about 12 miles north of Letheringham, chief administrator to Edward the Black Prince (1330-1376), whose daughter and heiress Catherine Wingfield married Michael de la Pole, later 1st Earl of Suffolk, and lived at Wingfield Castle in Suffolk. Career In 1420 he was a legatee in the will of his great-aunt Elizabeth Elmham, and in 1426 was knighted at Hereford by King Henry VI. The next year he was elected a knight of the shire for Suffolk and sat in all Parliaments until 1436. In 1436 he was appointed steward of the lands in Norfolk of the Honour of Richmond and in 1443 he became steward to John de Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk and accompanied him on his embassy to the court of King Charles VII of France. In December 1447 he was named as a rioter in Suffolk and was imprisoned in the Marshalsea, but was pardoned in February 1448. In September of that year he complained that the Duke of Norfolk had attacked his home at Letheringham with an armed force and had burned his furniture and removed goods worth the then huge sum of ¬£1,200. Despite these local difficulties, in 1449 he was elected a Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire, but was denounced in Parliament next year as one of the King's \\"evil advisors\\". Marriage and children Before 18 August 1421 he married Elizabeth Goushill (born about 1402), a daughter of Sir Robert Goushill of Hoveringham in Nottinghamshire, by his wife Elizabeth Fitzalan. Elizabeth Goushill was co- heiress of her father's estate along with her sister Joan Goushill, the wife of Thomas Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley, and their half-brother was John de Mowbray, 2nd Duke of Norfolk.

History Temperance activist Neal Dow helped craft the Maine liquor law while he was mayor of Portland, Maine. The law's wording included that the sale of all alcoholic beverages except for \\"medicinal, mechanical or manufacturing purposes\\" was prohibited. Word of the law's passage quickly spread elsewhere in the nation, and by 1855 twelve states had joined Maine in total prohibition. Known as \\"dry\\" states, these states were the opposite of \\"wet\\" states, where no prohibition laws existed.Henry Stephen Clubb, The Maine Liquor Law: Its Origin, History, and Results, Including a Life of Hon. Neal Dow (Published by Pub. for the Maine Law Statistical Society, by Fowler and Wells, 1856) (accessed on Google Book Search on January 21, 2009) The act was unpopular with many working-class people and immigrants. Opposition to the law turned violent in Portland on June 2, 1855, during an incident known as the Portland Rum Riot. Opponents of the Maine Law stormed Portland City Hall because they thought Mayor Dow was keeping liquor in the basement. Newspapers reported that Dow ordered rioters to be fired upon, killing one and wounding seven. The riot was a contributing factor to the law being repealed in 1856. However, despite repeal, prohibition was re-enacted in various forms and eventually was written into the state constitution in 1885. The Maine Law gained recognition internationally and was the inspiration for United Kingdom Alliance in Manchester, England. That organization grew and during the late 19th century a street in Manchester, England, was renamed \\"Maine Road\\" in honour of the law.

It is typically described in terms of what an individual voluntarily refrains from doing. This includes restraint from revenge by practicing non-violence and forgiveness, restraint from arrogance by practicing humility and modesty, restraint from excesses such as extravagant luxury or splurging by practicing prudence, and restraint from rage or craving by practicing calmness and self-control. Temperance has been described as a virtue by religious thinkers, philosophers, and more recently, psychologists, particularly in the positive psychology movement. It has a long history in philosophical and religious thought. In classical iconography, the virtue is often depicted as a woman holding two vessels transferring water from one to another. It is one of the cardinal virtues in western thought found in Greek philosophy and Christianity, as well as eastern traditions such as Buddhism and Hinduism. Temperance is one of the six virtues in the positive psychology classification, included with wisdom, courage, humanity, justice, and transcendence. It is generally characterized as the control over excess, and expressed through characteristics such as chastity, modesty, humility, self-regulation, hospitality, decorum, abstinence, forgiveness and mercy; each of these involves restraining an excess of some impulse, such as sexual desire, vanity, or anger. The term \\"temperance\\" can also refer to the abstention from alcohol (teetotalism), especially with reference to the temperance movement. It can also refer to alcohol moderation.  History =Greek civilization Digges memorial by Nicholas Stone, St. Mary's Church, Chilham There are two words in ancient Greek that have been translated to \\"temperance\\" in the English language. The first, s√¥phrosune, largely meant self-restraint. The other, enkrateia, was a word coined during the time of Aristotle, to mean control over oneself, or self-discipline. Enkrateia appears three times in the King James Bible, where it was translated as temperance. The modern meaning of temperance has evolved since its first usage. In Latin, tempero means restraint (from force or anger), but also more broadly the proper balancing or mixing (particularly, of temperature, or compounds). Hence the phrase \\"to temper a sword\\", meaning the heating and cooling process of forging a metal blade. The Latin also referred to governing and control, likely in a moderate way (i.e. not with the use of excessive force) [needs references]. Temperance is a major Athenian virtue, as advocated by Plato; self-restraint (s√¥phrosune) is one of his four core virtues of the ideal city, and echoed by Aristotle. According to Aristotle, \\"temperance is a mean with regard to pleasures\\". In \\"Charmides\\", one of Plato's early dialogues, the one who possessed sophrosune is defined in four ways: (1) one who has quietness, (2) one who has modesty, (3) one who does his own business, and (4) one who knows himself. Plato quickly dismisses the three first definitions and argues against (4) that if sophrosune would have been only the property of knowing what one knows or not, then it would be useless without knowledge about other matters. Religions Representation of temperance (painted wood sculpture, dated 1683, which covers the shrine of the baptismal church Breton Commana in France). Temperance foot tips over a jug of wine, and presents a pitcher of water Themes of temperance can be seen across cultures and time, as illustrated here. Buddhism Temperance is an essential part of the Eightfold Path. In the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, often regarded as the first teaching, the Buddha describes the Noble Eightfold Path as the Middle Way of moderation, between the extremes of sensual indulgence and self- mortification. The third and fifth of the five precepts (pa√±ca-sila) reflect values of temperance: \\"misconduct concerning sense pleasures\\" and drunkenness are to be avoided.Harvey, P. (1990). An introduction to Buddhism: Teaching, history and practices. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. Christianity In the Judeo-Christian tradition, temperance is prolific. The Old Testament emphasizes temperance as a core virtue, as evidenced in both Solomon's Book of Proverbs and in the Ten Commandments, with its admonitions against adultery and covetousness. The New Testament does so as well, with forgiveness being central to theology and self-control being one of the Fruits of the Spirit. With regard to Christian theology, the word temperance is used by the King James Version in Galatians 5:23 for the Greek word ·ºêŒ≥Œ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒµŒØŒ± (enkrateia), which means self-control or discipline (Strong's Concordance, 1466). Thomas Aquinas promoted Plato's original virtues in addition to several others. Within the Christian church Temperance is a virtue akin to self- control. It is applied to all areas of life. It can especially be viewed in practice among sects like the Amish, Old Order Mennonites, and Conservative Mennonites. In the Christian religion, temperance is a virtue that moderates attraction and desire for pleasure and \\"provides balance in the use of created goods\\". St. Thomas calls it a \\"disposition of the mind which binds the passions\\".Niemiec, R. M. (2013). VIA character strengths: Research and practice (The first 10 years). In H. H. Knoop & A. Delle Fave (Eds.), Well- being and cultures: Perspectives on positive psychology (pp. 11‚Äì30). New York: Springer. Temperance is believed to combat the sin of gluttony. More recently, in positive psychology, temperance was defined to include these four main character strengths: forgiveness, humility, prudence, and self-regulation. Hinduism The concept of dama () in Hinduism is equivalent to temperance. It is sometimes written as damah (Sanskrit: ‡§¶‡§Æ‡§É).Sanskrit translations for Self-Control English-Sanskrit Dictionary, GermanySanskrit Words; See dama and damah The word dama, and Sanskrit derivative words based on it, connote the concepts of self-control and self-restraint. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, in verse 5.2.3, states that three characteristics of a good, developed person are self-restraint (damah), compassion and love for all sentient life (daya), and charity (daana).Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, Translator: S Madhavananda, p. 816, For discussion: pp. 814‚Äì821; Quote - \\"‡§§‡§¶‡•á‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Ø‡§Å ‡§∂‡§ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§¶‡•ç ‡§¶‡§Æ‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§æ‡§®‡§Ç ‡§¶‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡§ø\\", translation: Learn three cardinal virtues - temperance, charity and compassion for all life.\\" In Hinduism literature dedicated to yoga, self-restraint is expounded with the concept of yamas ().James Lochtefeld, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing New York, , see article on Yama, p. 777 According to ·π£a·π≠sampad, self-restraint (dama) is one of the six cardinal virtues.Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, France, this reference is in French; see explanation under the term dama: contr√¥le de ses passions The list of virtues that constitute a moral life evolve in vedas and upanishads. Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added, some replaced, others merged. For example, Manusamhita initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a dharmic (moral) life: Dhriti (courage), Kshama (forgiveness), Dama (temperance), Asteya (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), Saucha (purity), Indriyani-graha (control of senses), dhi (reflective prudence), vidya (wisdom), satyam (truthfulness), akrodha (freedom from anger). In later verses this list was reduced to five virtues by the same scholar, by merging and creating a more broader concept. The shorter list of virtues became: Ahimsa (Non-violence), Dama (temperance), Asteya (Non- covetousness/Non-stealing), Saucha (purity), Satyam (truthfulness).Gupta, B. (2006).

Journal of Religious Ethics, 34(3), 373‚Äì395.Mohapatra & Mohapatra, Hinduism: Analytical Study, ; see pp. 37‚Äì40 This trend of evolving concepts continue in classical Sanskrit literature, Dama with Ahimsa and few other virtues present in the evolving list of virtues necessary for a moral life (dharma).Comparative Religion, Kedar Nath Tiwari, ; see pp. 33‚Äì34Bailey, G. (1983). Puranic notes: reflections on the myth of sukesin. South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies, 6(2), 46‚Äì61. Five types of self-restraints are considered essential for a moral and ethical life in Hindu philosophy: one must refrain from any violence that causes injury to others, refrain from starting or propagating deceit and falsehood, refrain from theft of other's property, refrain from sexually cheating on one's partner, and refrain from avarice.Heim, M. (2005), Differentiations in Hindu ethics, in William Schweiker (Editor), The Blackwell companion to religious ethics, , Chapter 35, pp. 341‚Äì354 The scope of self- restraint includes one's action, the words one speaks or writes, and in one's thoughts. The necessity for temperance is explained as preventing bad karma which sooner or later haunts and returns to the unrestrained.Rao, G. H. (1926), The Basis of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, 37(1), pp. 19‚Äì35Hindrey, Roderick (1978), Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, Motilal Banarsidass Publications, The theological need for self- restraint is also explained as reigning in the damaging effect of one's action on others, as hurting another is hurting oneself because all life is one.Sturgess, Stephen (2013), The Yoga Book: A Practical Guide to Self- realization, Watkins Publishing, , see Chapter 2  Jainism  Temperance in Jainism is deeply imbibed in its five major vows which are: *Ahimsa (nonviolence) *Satya (truth) *Brahmacharya (chastity or celibacy), *Asteya (non-stealing) *Aparigraha (non-possessiveness). In Jainism, the vow of Ahimsa is not just restricted to not resorting to physical violence, but it also encompasses in itself abstinence from violence in any and all form either by thought, speech or action. On Samvatsari, the last day of Paryushan‚Äîthe most prominent festival of Jainism‚Äîthe Jains greet their friends and relatives on this last day with MicchƒÅmi Dukka·∏ça·πÉ, seeking their forgiveness. The phrase is also used by Jains throughout the year when a person makes a mistake, or recollects making one in everyday life, or when asking for forgiveness in advance for inadvertent ones. Contemporary organizations Values of temperance are still advocated by more modern sources such as the Boy Scouts, William Bennett, and Ben Franklin.Peterson & Seligman, M.E.P. (2004).

It was annulled by Papal mandate as she, since her father's attainder and execution, had ceased to be of any importance to him. Pope Clement VI obligingly annulled the marriage, bastardized the issue, and provided a dispensation for his second marriage to the woman with whom he had been living in adultery (the dispensation, dated 4 March 1345, was required because his first and second wives were first cousins).

Scholars working in the tradition of CDA generally argue that (non-linguistic) social practice and linguistic practice constitute one another and focus on investigating how societal power relations are established and reinforced through language use. In this sense, it differs from discourse analysis in that it highlights issues of power asymmetries, manipulation, exploitation, and structural inequities in domains such as education, media, and politics. Background Critical discourse analysis emerged from 'critical linguistics' developed at the University of East Anglia by Roger Fowler and fellow scholars in the 1970s, and the terms are now often interchangeable.Some still insist on distinctions between the two terms, although they are relatively minor Research in the field of sociolinguistics was paying little attention to social hierarchy and power.Wodak, R. (2001) \\"What CDA is about\\" In: Wodak, Ruth & Meyer, Michael (eds.) (2001) Methods of Critical Discourse Analysis. London: Sage. p. 5 CDA was first developed by the Lancaster school of linguists of which Norman Fairclough was the most prominent figure. Ruth Wodak has also made a major contribution to this field of study. In addition to linguistic theory, the approach draws from social theory‚Äîand contributions from Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, J√ºrgen Habermas, Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu‚Äîin order to examine ideologies and power relations involved in discourse. Language connects with the social through being the primary domain of ideology, and through being both a site of, and a stake in, struggles for power. Ideology has been called the basis of the social representations of groups, and, in psychological versions of CDA developed by Teun A. van Dijk and Ruth Wodak, there is assumed to be a sociocognitive interface between social structures and discourse structures. The historical dimension in critical discourse studies also plays an important role. Methodology Although CDA is sometimes mistaken to represent a 'method' of discourse analysis, it is generally agreed upon that any explicit method in discourse studies, the humanities and social sciences may be used in CDA research, as long as it is able to adequately and relevantly produce insights into the way discourse reproduces (or resists) social and political inequality, power abuse or domination.Fairclough, Norman, Critical discourse analysis: the critical study of language. Harlow: LongmanFairclough, Norman, Language and globalization. Oxon: Routledge That is, CDA does not limit its analysis to specific structures of text or talk, but systematically relates these to structures of the sociopolitical context. CDA has been used to examine political speech acts, to highlight the rhetoric behind these, and any forms of speech that may be used to manipulate the impression given to the audience. However, there have been flaws noted with CDA. For example, it has been said that it is simultaneously too broad to distinctly identify manipulations within the rhetoric, yet is also not powerful enough to appropriately find all that researchers set out to establish. Norman Fairclough discussed the term CDA in his book Language and Power. Fairclough introduced the concepts that are now viewed as vital in CDA such as \\"discourse, power, ideology, social practice and common sense.\\" He argues that language should be analyzed as a social practice through the lens of discourse in both speaking and writing. Fairclough developed a three- dimensional framework for studying discourse, where the aim is to map three separate forms of analysis onto one another: analysis of (spoken or written) language texts, analysis of discourse practice (processes of text production, distribution and consumption) and analysis of discursive events as instances of socio-cultural practice. Particularly, he combines micro, meso and macro- level interpretation. At the micro-level, the analyst considers various aspects of textual/linguistic analysis, for example syntactic analysis, use of metaphor and rhetorical devices. The meso-level or \\"level of discursive practice\\" involves studying issues of production and consumption, for instance, which institution produced a text, who is the target audience, etc. At the macro-level, the analyst is concerned with intertextual and interdiscursive elements and tries to take into account the broad, societal currents that are affecting the text being studied. Teun A. van Dijk's approach to Critical Discourse Analysis combines cognitive theories with linguistic and social theories. Van Dijk uses cognition as the middle layer of a three-layer approach consisting of discourse, cognitive and society. By integrating a cognitive approach, researchers are better able to understand how larger social phenomenon are reinforced through popular, everyday discourse. Critics of this practice point out that his approach focuses on the reproduction of ideologies rather than the transformation. Ruth Wodak has developed a framework based on the systemic collection of sample texts on a topic to better understand the interrelationship of discourses that exist within the field. This framework allows for the discussion and analysis of ideologies involved in a set of discourses. The macro level of analysis is helpful in understanding how macro-structures of inequality persist through discursive processes across multiple sites and texts.  Applications  CDA has been applied to media studies, English language teaching, heritage language socialization and environmental sciences to name a few.

He took part in the Siege of Caerlaverock in July 1300. Petition for succession and inheritance After a period of longstanding opposition to King Edward II and his advisors, including joining two open rebellions, Henry's brother Thomas was convicted of treason, executed and had his lands and titles forfeited in 1322. Henry did not participate in his brother's rebellions; he later petitioned for his brother's lands and titles, and on 29 March 1324 he was invested as Earl of Leicester. A few years later, shortly after his accession in 1327, the young Edward III of England returned the earldom of Lancaster to him, along with other lordships such as that of Bowland. Capture and custody of the King On the Queen's return to England in September 1326 with Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, Henry joined her party against King Edward II, which led to a general desertion of the king's cause and overturned the power of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, and his namesake son Hugh the younger Despenser. He was sent in pursuit and captured the king at Neath in South Wales. He was appointed to take charge of the king and was responsible for his custody at Kenilworth Castle. Full restoration and reward Henry was appointed head of the regency council for the new king Edward III of England, and was also appointed captain-general of all the king's forces in the Scottish Marches.Burke, John, A general and heraldic dictionary of the peerages of England, Ireland, and Scotland, (Henry Colburn and Richard Bentley:London, 1831), 424. He was appointed Constable of Lancaster Castle and High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1327. He also helped the young king to put an end to Mortimer's regency and tyranny, also had him declared a traitor and executed in 1330. Loss of sight In about the year 1330, he became blind (Prestwich states Henry was going blind around 1329). Later life and death Henry spent the last fifteen years of his life at Leicester Castle. There he founded a hospital for the poor and infirm in an extension of the castle bailey. It became known as the Newarke, and Henry was buried in the hospital chapel when he died in 1345.

He was formally seconded for service with the Imperial Yeomanry and appointed a captain of the 45th (Dublin) Company on 3 February 1900. The company left for South Africa in the middle of March 1900, and on arrival was attached to the 13th Battalion, Imperial Yeomanry. He was wounded and returned home the following year. In January 1902 he was again seconded for service with the Imperial Yeomanry. He was appointed in command of the 29th Battalion (composed primarily of officers and men from the Irish Horse), with the temporary rank of Lieutenant-colonel (antedated to 1 January 1902), and left Ireland for South Africa in May 1902. As the senior officer, he was in command of almost 1 150 officers and men on board the transport ship Bavarian for the journey. They arrived in South Africa after the end of hostilities, as the Peace of Vereeniging was signed on 31 May, and returned home only four months later, leaving Cape Town on the SS Dilwara which arrived at Southampton in late October. In Dublin, he was a member of the Kildare Street Club.Thomas Hay Sweet Escott, Club Makers and Club Members (1913), pp. 329‚Äì333 During the First World War Lord Longford commanded the 2nd South Midland Mounted Brigade of the 2nd Mounted Division, a yeomanry formation, with the rank of Brigadier-General. The Division was initially based in Egypt but was sent dismounted to Suvla on the Gallipoli peninsula as reinforcements during the Battle of Sari Bair. On 21 August 1915 the Division was in reserve for the final attack on Scimitar Hill. When the initial attack by the 29th Division failed, the yeomanry were ordered to advance in the open across a dry salt lake. Raked by shrapnel fire, most of the brigades halted in the shelter of Green Hill but Longford led his brigade in a charge which captured the summit of the hill. As he continued to advance, he was killed. His last words before his death were, reputedly, \\" Don't bother ducking, the men don't like it and it doesn't do any good....\\" Longford's body was never recovered as the British made no further advances before the evacuation of Suvla on 20 December. His grave is marked as a special memorial in Green Hill Cemetery at Suvla. Family Lord Longford married Lady Mary Julia Child-Villiers, daughter of Victor Child-Villiers, 7th Earl of Jersey, in 1899. They had two sons and four daughters. He was succeeded in the earldom by his elder son, Edward. His second son, Frank, later succeeded his elder brother and became a prominent Labour politician. Longford's daughters were Lady Violet Pakenham, a writer and critic and the wife of the noted novelist Anthony Powell; Lady Mary Clive, author of Christmas at the Savages and other novels; Lady Pansy Lamb, novelist, biographer, and wife of the painter Henry Lamb; and Lady Julia Mount, mother of Sir Ferdinand Mount. The Countess of Longford died in November 1933, aged 56.  Notes  References  *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors). Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage (1990 edition).

The Hotsuma Tsutae (also Hotuma Tsutaye, Japanese ÁßÄÁúü‰ºù) is an elaborate epic poem of Japanese legendary history which differs substantially from the mainstream version as recorded in the Kojiki and the Nihon Shoki. Its antiquity is undetermined. Although many proponents allege that the Hotsuma predates the mainstream mythology, the first known manuscript was dedicated to a shrine by Waniko Yasutoshi (also known as Yunoshin Ibo) in 1775. Some excerpts were published and translated into modern Japanese in 1884, a printing which was noted by Hirata Atsutane in his work on jindai moji, a Japanese writing system developed prior to the use of Chinese characters, but which otherwise ignored the work. Atsutane's Kokugaku was principally concerned with the Kojiki and the Hotsuma Tsutae would have only muddled his theories. Yasutoshi's manuscript was almost lost, but was discovered and rescued in 1993 following the publication of some popular books on the subject in the mid-20th century by Yoshinosuke Matsumoto.Yoshinosuke Matsumoto The Mainichi Newspapers Co., Ltd (1980/07) - Public appars.Yoshinosuke Matsumoto (Author), Andrew Driver (Translator) The Hotsuma Legends: Paths of the Ancestors. Japan Translation Center, LTD. (1999) - Translated. The Hotsuma Tsutae is known for its text and rhythm. It was written in yamato-kotoba, which only uses a Japanese vocabulary which predates contact with China. Some of the yamato-kotoba used in Hotsuma Tsutae are unattested elsewhere in the Old Japanese corpus but have parallels to old words, meaning that if it is a late medieval hoax it is extremely elaborate. Among other things in its primarily historical and non-mythological record, the text discusses the births, lives, and deaths of kami from Japanese folk shrines and history; in this case, the word kami being used to mean something like royalty and not \\"gods\\". In the poem, Amaterasu, the sun kami of Shinto, is male, and not female as is written in the official records. Matsumoto theorizes that Amaterasu was feminized in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki to provide a justification for the reign of Empress Suiko who reigned just before those documents were written. Although for the most part Japanese academics remain uninterested in this text, some scholars are of the opinion that it may have been written in the Edo period. This is due to claims that the text was written in an original Japanese alphabet - in academic circles, the existence of writing in Japan before the use of Chinese characters is denied, also the alphabet does not reflect the Old Japanese phonology but rather those of later stages of Japanese. The general opinion is that it is a false document. However, no definitive conclusion has yet been reached.

The defenders of Harfleur surrendered to the English on terms and were treated as prisoners of war. The English army was considerably reduced by casualties and an outbreak of dysentery during the siege but marched towards Calais, less a garrison left behind at the port. The English were intercepted en route and fought the Battle of Agincourt (25 October), inflicting a huge defeat on the French. Background Henry V of England invaded France following the failure of negotiations with the French. He claimed the title of King of France through his great-grandfather Edward III, although in practice the English kings were generally prepared to renounce this claim if the French would acknowledge the English claim on Aquitaine and other French lands (the terms of the Treaty of Bretigny). He initially called a great council in the spring of 1414 to discuss going to war with France, but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims. In the following negotiations Henry said that he would give up his claim to the French throne if the French would pay the 1.6 million crowns outstanding from the ransom of John II (who had been captured at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356), and concede English ownership of the lands of Normandy, Touraine, Anjou, Brittany and Flanders, as well as Aquitaine. Henry would marry Princess Catherine, the young daughter of Charles VI, and receive a dowry of 2 million crowns. The French responded with what they considered the generous terms of marriage with Princess Catherine, a dowry of 600,000 crowns, and an enlarged Aquitaine. By 1415 negotiations had ground to a halt, with the English claiming that the French had mocked their claims and ridiculed Henry himself. In December 1414, the English Parliament was persuaded to grant Henry a \\"double subsidy\\", a tax at twice the traditional rate, to recover his inheritance from the French. On 19 April 1415, Henry again asked the great council to sanction war with France, and this time they agreed. Invasion and preparations On Tuesday 13 August 1415, Henry landed at Chef-en-Caux in the Seine estuary. Then he attacked Harfleur with at least 2,300 men-at-arms and 9,000 bowmen. The French garrison of 100 men was reinforced by two experienced knights, the Sieur d'Estouteville and the Sieur de Gaucourt, who arrived with a further 300 men- at-arms and took command. Investment and siege On 18 August, Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence, led part of the army to set up camp on the far east side of the town. This meant that the town was invested and a French relief convoy, bearing supplies of guns, powder, arrows and crossbows was captured. Details of the siege are not well known but seem to have followed the standard pattern of siege warfare in the Late Middle Ages. After the walls had been seriously damaged by the twelve great guns and other traditional artillery of the English siege train, Henry planned a general assault one month to the day that the town had been enveloped. But the town's commanders asked for a parley and terms were agreed that if the French army did not arrive before 23 September, the town would surrender to the English. Harfleur yielded to the invaders on 22 September. The knights were released on parole to gather ransom, and those townspeople who were prepared to swear allegiance to Henry were allowed to remain, while the rest were ordered to depart. Aftermath Henry left a garrison of 300 men-at-arms and 900 archers in the town. On Monday 8 October the English army set out for Calais. Henry searched for an undefended or weakly defended bridge or ford on the Somme river, hoping to slip past the French army unnoticed, but although he crossed the Somme he failed to evade the French army and was forced to fight the battle of Agincourt. Casualties During the siege, the English army suffered from dysentery (known as the bloody flux) which continued to affect them after the siege ended. Contemporary sources suggest that Henry V lost up to 5,000 men at Harfleur, principally to disease. Anne Curry, drawing information from existing sick lists, identifies 1,330 men who were invalided home and another 36 who died during the siege. She believes these numbers represent a close maximum of English casualties and estimated that the English numbered around 9,000 at Agincourt. Several historians criticised her methodology and preferred to maintain the higher casualty rates, pointing out that existing records are incomplete and that they are not reliable ways to estimate total troop numbers. Clifford Rogers considers the number of 36 deaths to be impossibly low and finds the higher contemporary figures believable, citing other historical examples of armies being heavily hit by dysentery. In the second edition of his volume \\"Cursed Kings....\\" (2016) Jonathan Sumption wrote that less the Harfleur garrison, the English army numbered 900 men-at-arms and 5,000 archers when the march began. In popular culture As it forms a crucial episode in William Shakespeare's play, Henry V, the siege is portrayed in all cinematic adaptations, including the 1944 film by Laurence Olivier, the 1989 film by Kenneth Branagh, the 2012 television film, as well as the 2019 film by David Mich√¥d. It is also fictionally portrayed in the historical novel Azincourt (2008) as well as the children's novel My Story: A Hail of Arrows: Jenkin Lloyd, Agincourt, France 1415, and the Danish novel The Highest Honour (2009) by Susanne Clod Pedersen.

Terminal Island is roughly split between the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach. Land use on the island is entirely industrial and port-related except for Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island. In this night-time aerial photograph of Los Angeles, San Pedro is in the center and right foreground, including part of the brightly lit Terminal Island. The dark peninsula to the left of San Pedro is Palos Verdes. History The island was originally called Isla Raza de Buena Gente and later Rattlesnake Island. It was renamed Terminal Island in 1891. In 1909, the newly reincorporated Southern California Edison Company decided to build a new steam station to provide reserve capacity and emergency power for the entire Edison system and to enable Edison to shut down some of its small, obsolete steam plants. The site chosen for the new plant was on a barren mudflat known as Rattlesnake Island, today's Terminal Island in the San Pedro Bay. Construction of Plant No. 1 began in 1910. The land area of Terminal Island has been supplemented considerably from its original size. In 1909 the city of Los Angeles annexed the city of Wilmington. During this time the \\"Father of the Harbor\\" Phineas Banning, held deed to roughly 18 acres of land on Rattlesnake Island. Phineas Banning was instrumental in bringing innovative changes to San Pedro Bay and made the first steps towards expansion. Once annexed with the city of Los Angeles the expansion was completed. In the late 1920s, Deadman's Island in the main channel of the Port of Los Angeles was dynamited and dredged away, and the resulting rubble was used to add to Terminal Island's southern tip. In 1930, the Ford Motor Company built a facility called Long Beach Assembly, having moved earlier operations from Downtown Los Angeles. The factory remained until 1958 when manufacturing operations were moved inland to Pico Rivera. In 1927, a civilian facility, Allen Field, was established on Terminal Island. The Naval Reserve established a training center at the field and later took complete control, designating the field Naval Air Base San Pedro (also called Reeves Field). In 1941, the Long Beach Naval Station was located adjacent to the airfield. In 1942, the Naval Reserve Training Facility was transferred, and a year later NAB San Pedro's status was downgraded to a Naval Air Station (NAS Terminal Island). Reeves Field as a Naval Air Station was disestablished in 1947, although the adjacent Long Beach Naval Station continued to use Reeves Field as an auxiliary airfield until the late 1990s. A large industrial facility now covers the site of the former Naval Air Station. The island was home to about 3,500 first- and second-generation Japanese Americans prior to World War II in an area known as East San Pedro or Fish Island. On February 9, 1942, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the FBI incarcerated all of the adult Issei males on Terminal Island. On February 19, 1942, immediately after the signing of Executive Order 9066, Terminal Island's remaining inhabitants were given 48 hours to evacuate their homes. They were subsequently sent to internment camps, and the entire neighborhood was razed. The Japanese community on Terminal Island was the first to be evacuated and interned en masse. Because of the island's relative geographical isolation, its inhabitants developed their own culture and even their own dialect. The dialect, known as \\"kii-shu ben‚Äù (or \\"Terminal Island lingo\\"), was a mix of English and the dialect of Kii Province, where many residents hailed from. After World War II, the Terminal Islanders settled elsewhere. In 1971, they formed the Terminal Islanders Club, which has organized various events for its members. In 2002, the surviving second-generation citizens set up a memorial on Terminal Island to honor their parents. During World War II, Terminal Island was an important center for defense industries, especially shipbuilding. It was also, therefore, one of the first places where African Americans tried to effect their integration into defense-related work on the West Coast. In 1946, Howard Hughes moved his monstrous Spruce Goose airplane from his plant in Culver City to Terminal Island in preparation for its test flight. In its first and only flight, it took off from the island on November 2, 1947. Brotherhood Raceway Park, a mile drag racing strip, opened in 1974 on former US Navy land. It operated, with many interruptions, until finally closing in 1995 to be replaced by a coal-handling facility. Preservation of vacant buildings earned the island a spot on the top 11 sites on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's 2012 Most Endangered Historic Places List. In mid-2013, the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners approved a preservation plan. The trust cited the site as one of ten historic sites saved in 2013. Current use The west half of the island is part of the San Pedro area of the city of Los Angeles, while the rest is part of the city of Long Beach. The island has a land area of 11.56 km2 (4.46 sq mi), or , and had a population of 1,467 at the 2000 census. The Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach are the major landowners on the island, who in turn lease much of their land for container terminals and bulk terminals. The island also hosts canneries, shipyards, and United States Coast Guard facilities. The Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island, which began operating in 1938, hosts more than 900 low security federal prisoners. The Long Beach Naval Shipyard, decommissioned in 1997, occupied roughly half of the island. Sea Launch maintains docking facilities on the mole that was part of the naval station. Aerospace company SpaceX is initially leasing from the Port of Los Angeles on the island at Berth 240. They will refurbish five buildings and raise a tent-like structure for research, design, and manufacturing. SpaceX has been building and testing its planned Starship crewed space transportation system intended for suborbital, orbital and interplanetary flight in Texas. The new SpaceX rocket, too large to be transported for long distances overland, will be shipped to the company's launch area in Florida or Texas by sea, via the Panama Canal. The site was used for shipbuilding from 1918, and was formerly operated by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation and then the Southwest Marine Shipyard. The location has been disused since 2005. Bridges Vincent Thomas Bridge Terminal Island is connected to the mainland via four bridges. To the west, the distinctive green Vincent Thomas Bridge, the fourth-longest suspension bridge in California, connects it with the Los Angeles neighborhood of San Pedro. The Gerald Desmond Bridge connects the island with downtown Long Beach to the east. The Commodore Schuyler F. Heim Bridge joins Terminal Island with the Los Angeles neighborhood of Wilmington to the north. Adjacent to the Heim Bridge is a rail bridge called the Henry Ford Bridge, or the Badger Avenue Bridge.  In popular culture  Terminal Island is the setting at the start of The Terror: Infamy, season 2 of the AMC series, The Terror, before the Japanese American residents are relocated to internment camps following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and at the end. Terminal Island is also the setting of the first truck heist scene in the film The Fast and the Furious. See also * List of islands of California * Albert P.

He was the second surviving son of King Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence. In his childhood he had a claim on the Kingdom of Sicily; however, he never ruled there. He was granted all the lands of Simon de Montfort in 1265, and from 1267 he was titled Earl of Leicester. In that year he also began to rule Lancashire, but he did not take the title Earl of Lancaster until 1276. Between 1276 and 1284 he governed the counties of Champagne and Brie with his second wife, Blanche of Artois, in the name of her daughter Joan, and he was described in the English patent rolls as earl of Lancaster and Champagne. His nickname, \\"Crouchback\\" (meaning \\"cross-back\\"; Latin gibbosus), refers to his participation in the Ninth Crusade.Simon Lloyd, \\"Edmund , first earl of Lancaster and first earl of Leicester (1245‚Äì1296)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008). Life Edmund was born in London, a son of Henry III of England and Eleanor of Provence. He was a younger brother of Edward I, Margaret, and Beatrice, and an elder brother of Catherine. He was invested ruler of the Kingdom of Sicily by the Bishop of Bologna in 1255, on behalf of Pope Alexander IV. In return, his father undertook to pay the papacy 135,541 marks and fight a war to dislodge the Hohenstaufen king Manfred. Henry's barons refused to contribute to what they called the \\"Sicilian business\\", and ultimately Henry was only able to pay 60,000 marks. Steven Runciman says the grant of the kingdom was revoked by Pope Alexander IV on 18 December 1258; Baines and Harland state that this occurred in 1263, under Pope Urban IV. However, Edmund soon obtained important possessions and dignities, for soon after the forfeiture of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester on 25 October 1265, Edmund received the Earldom of Leicester and later that of Lancaster. He was granted the honour of the Stewardship of England and the lands of Nicolas de Segrave. He also acquired the estates of Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby, that included the Honour of Hinckley Castle. In 1267, Edmund was granted the lordship of Builth Wells, in opposition to the then holder, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (the last prince of an independent Wales). To help him conquer the land, he was also granted his elder brother's lordships of the Trilateral of Skenfrith, Grosmont and White Castle, all in Monmouthshire, together with Monmouth. After the civil war in 1267, he was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire. Henry III created his second son Earl of Leicester in 1267, granting the honour and privileges of that city. The following year he was made Constable of Leicester Castle, a royal possession in the king's name. Crouchback by now had a reputation as a ruthless and ferocious warrior, but he was not in England fighting de Montfort. In 1271, Edmund accompanied his elder brother Edward on the Ninth Crusade to Palestine. Some historians, including the authors of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica article on him, state that it was because of this that he received the nickname 'Crouchback' (which means \\"cross-back\\"), indicating that he was entitled to wear a cross stitched into the back of his garments. On his return from the Crusade of 1271‚Äì2, he seems to have made Grosmont Castle his favoured home and undertook much rebuilding there. His son Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster was apparently born there in 1281. Edmund remained loyal to his brother, Edward I; the Charter grants of 1265, 1267, and 1268‚Äì9 were confirmed by the King in a document of Inspeximus in 1284, and by Parliament in the Great Charter of Leicester.\\"Fourteenth century England\\" vol. VII, p.137. Also in 1284, on the marriage of his stepdaughter, he renounced the title of earl of Champagne, although he continued in possession of his wife's dowerlands. Edmund frequently acted as an ambassador abroad. He was sent as Governor of Ponthieu in 1291, on behalf of his second wife, Blanche of Artois. His duty to the church included the foundation of a Nuns of Clara or Poor Clares nunnery at Minories, St Aldate's. In 1291, his estate paid for the establishment for the Chapel of Savoy, in memory of his mother, near St Clement Danes. Filial piety was part of the chivalric code of an honourable knight. Edmund was a generous benefactor to the monastery of Grace Dieu in Leicestershire, and to the nuns at Tarrant Crawford. He also helped establish a major Greyfriars monastery at Preston in the duchy of Lancaster. In 1281, he supervised the construction of Aberystwyth Castle for King Edward I to subjugate the Welsh. The following year Edmund accompanied Roger Mortimer on campaign against Llywelyn, defeating and capturing the prince. In 1294 the French king, Philip IV, through trickery, defrauded King Edward out of his lands in Gascony. Edward immediately began to plan an invasion but ran into difficulties. First, some of the Welsh rebelled against him, then the Scots rebelled. Finally, by the end of 1295, he was ready to take up the conflict with Philip. He wanted to send Edmund to lead a small force ahead of the main army he was gathering, but Edmund fell ill in that autumn and was unwell until Christmas. Finally Edmund was able to go to Bordeaux for his brother. Amongst the nobles was the Earl of Lincoln and 26 banneret knights. During the siege of Bayonne the English ran out of money, so the army melted into the countryside. Broken-hearted, the warrior-prince Edmund Crouchback died on 5 June. His body was carried to England and was interred on 15 July 1296 at Westminster Abbey, London. Family Edmund married firstly on 8 April 1269 Aveline de Forz, daughter of William de Forz, 4th Earl of Albemarle and Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon. She died just four years after the marriage, at the age of 15, and was buried at Westminster Abbey. The couple had no children, though some sources believe she may have died in childbirth or shortly after a miscarriage. He married secondly on 3 February 1276 Blanche of Artois, in Paris, widow of King Henry I of Navarre, and daughter of Robert I of Artois and Matilda of Brabant. With Blanche he had three children: * Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster (born circa 1278, executed 22 March 1322) * Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster (born circa 1281, died 22 September 1345) * John of Lancaster (born bef.

He is described by William Stubbs as \\"a feudal adventurer of the worst type\\". Family background Forz was the son of William de Forz (died 1195), and Hawise, Countess of Aumale (died 11 March 1214), a daughter of William le Gros, 1st Earl of Albemarle. His father was a minor nobleman from the village of Fors in Poitou; the toponymic is variously rendered as Fors and Forz, or else Latinised to Fortibus. Estate holdings Soon after 1213, Albemarle was established by King John in the territories of the Earldom of Albemarle, and in 1215 the whole of his mother's estates were formally confirmed to him. The Earldom of Albemarle which he inherited from his mother, included a large estate in Yorkshire, notably the wapentake of Holderness, including the castle of Skipsea, and the honour of Craven, as well as estates in Lincolnshire and elsewhere. It had also included the county of Aumale, but this had recently been lost to the French, along with the rest of Normandy. Albemarle was the first holder of his earldom to see it as wholly English. Involvement in military actions Albemarle was actively engaged in the struggles of the Norman barons against both King John and King Henry III. He was generally loyal to King John during the baronial revolt, although he did eventually join the barons after the leaders of the City of London joined them and the king's cause looked hopeless. Albemarle was one of the twenty-five executors of the Magna Carta, but among them he was probably the least hostile to the king. The barons made him constable of Scarborough Castle, but when soon after fighting began between the barons and the king, he went over to John's side, the only executor to do so. He fought for the king until the French capture of Winchester in June 1216, when again the king's cause looked hopeless. He then stayed on the barons' side until their cause fell apart. He sided with John, then subsequently changed sides as often as it suited his policy. After John's death, Albemarle supported the new king, Henry III, fighting in the siege of Mountsorrel and at the Battle of Lincoln. His real object was to revive the independent power of the feudal barons, and he co-operated to this end with Falkes de Breaut√© and other foreign adventurers established in the country by John. This brought him into conflict with the great justiciar, Hubert de Burgh, who was effectively regent. In 1219 he was declared a rebel and excommunicated for attending a forbidden tournament. In 1220 matters were brought to a crisis by his refusal to surrender the two royal castles of Rockingham and Sauvey of which he had been made constable in 1216. Henry III marched against them in person, the garrisons fled, and they fell without a blow. In the following year, however, Albemarle, in face of further efforts to reduce his power, rose in revolt. Excommunication and loss of power Albemarle was now again excommunicated by the legate Pandulf Verraccio at a solemn council held in St Paul's, and the whole force of the kingdom was set in motion against him, a special scutage‚Äîthe scutagium de Bihan‚Äîbeing voted for this purpose by the Great Council. The capture of his Castle of Bytham broke his power; he sought sanctuary and, at Pandulph's intercession, was pardoned on condition of going for six years to the Holy Land. He remained in England, however, and in 1223 was once more in revolt with Falkes de Breaut√© and other turbulent spirits. A reconciliation was again patched up; but it was not until the fall of Falkes de Breaut√© that Albemarle finally settled down as an English noble. He eventually gave in when the cause was lost in 1224, and was thenceforth loyal to Henry III. Revived influence In 1225 Albemarle witnessed Henry's third re-issue of the Great Charter; in 1227 he went as English ambassador to Antwerp; and in 1230 he accompanied Henry on his expedition to Brittany. In 1241 he set out for the Holy Land, but died at sea, on his way there, on 26 March 1242.

He was the father of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. Biography William was the son of Sir William Brandon of Wangford, Suffolk, and of Soham, Cambridgeshire, Knight Marshal of Marshalsea (1425 ‚Äì 4 March 1491) and wife (married 1462) Elizabeth Wingfield (died 28 April 1496/1497). He had numerous siblings, including Sir Thomas Brandon, who fought with him at the Battle of Bosworth and later became a leading courtier and Master of the Horse of Henry VII. In 1478 Sir John Paston wrote that Brandon had been arrested for an attempted rape: \\"yonge William Brandon is in warde and arestyd ffor thatt he scholde have fforce ravysshyd and swyvyd an olde jentylwoman ...\\" By that time he was already married to Elizabeth Bruyn, a widow with two sons, and according to Paston there were rumours he would be hanged for his offence. Brandon apparently escaped prosecution however, because a few years later he was one of the key London connections behind the Buckingham Revolt of 1483, along with his brother Thomas and brother-in-law, Wingfield. Pardoned in March 1484, he boarded a ship at Mersea in November and sailed for France, where he was supposedly joined by his wife, who gave birth to their eldest son in Paris. He joined his brother Thomas in the relief of the Hammes fortress. Battle of Bosworth Royal Standard of Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth. At the Battle of Bosworth, William formed part of Henry Tudor's personal entourage, performing the role of royal standard bearer. When Richard III launched his final charge, he personally unhorsed Sir John Cheney, a well-known jousting champion. Brandon was the other notable victim of the charge, killed by Richard while defending the standard. As such he appears in stanzas 155 and 156 in The Ballad of Bosworth: According to popular myth William and his brother were both knighted by Henry Tudor when he landed at Milford in 1485, however Thomas was only knighted after the Battle of Blackheath in 1497 and William was presumably only called \\"Sir William\\" out of courtesy after his death, or out of confusion with his father, the elder Sir William. Family Some time before 4 November 1474/1475 Brandon married Elizabeth Bruyn, daughter and co-heiress of Sir Henry Bruyn of South Ockendon, Essex, and wife Elizabeth Darcy, himself the son of Sir Maurice Bruyn. She was the widow of Thomas Tyrrell of Heron, Essex, whom she had married before 17 February 1461/1462, and who died after 3 July 1471, c. 13 October 1473, of the City of London, of Beckenham, Kent and of South Ockendon, Essex. She was a granddaughter of Sir Maurice Bruyn (d. 1466), and daughter and co-heiress of Sir Henry Bruyn (d. 1461) by Elizabeth Darcy (died c. 1471), daughter of Sir Robert Darcy of Maldon, Essex. Elizabeth Bruyn's paternal aunt, Joan Bruyn, married John Digges, great-grandfather of the scientist, Leonard Digges. On her father's side Elizabeth Bruyn was descended from Sir William le Brune, Knight Chamberlain to King Edward I. After William Brandon's death at the Battle of Bosworth on 22 August 1485, she married William Mallory or Mallery, Esq., whom she survived. She died 7 or 26 March 1493/1494.. By Elizabeth Bruyn, William Brandon had two sons and a daughter (the actual order of birth is not known): *William Brandon (d. before 1500). *Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk (ca. 1484 - 24 August 1545). *Anne Brandon, married firstly Sir John Shilston, and secondly Sir Gawain Carew.

Indications The spleen, similar in structure to a large lymph node, acts as a blood filter. Current knowledge of its purpose includes the removal of old red blood cells and platelets, and the detection and fight against certain bacteria. It is also known to function as a site for the development of new red blood cells from their hematopoietic stem cell precursors, and particularly in situations in which the bone marrow, the normal site for this process, has been compromised by a disorder such as leukemia. The spleen is enlarged in a variety of conditions such as malaria, mononucleosis and most commonly in cancers of the lymphatics, such as lymphomas or leukemia. It is removed under the following circumstances: #When it becomes very large such that it becomes destructive to platelets/red blood cells #For diagnosing certain lymphomas #Certain cases of splenic abscess #Certain cases of wandering spleen #Splenic vein thrombosis with bleeding Gastric varices #When platelets are destroyed in the spleen as a result of an auto-immune condition, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. #When the spleen bleeds following physical trauma #Following spontaneous rupture #For long-term treatment of congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) if severe hemolytic anemia develops #The spread of gastric cancer to splenic tissue #When using the splenic artery for kidney revascularisation in renovascular hypertension. #For long-term treatment of congenital pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency The classical cause of traumatic damage to the spleen is a blow to the abdomen during a sporting event. In cases where the spleen is enlarged due to illness (mononucleosis), trivial activities, such as leaning over a counter or straining while defecating, can cause a rupture. Procedure Laparoscopy is the preferred procedure in cases where the spleen is not too large and when the procedure is elective. Open surgery is performed in trauma cases or if the spleen is enlarged. Either method is major surgery and is performed under general anesthesia. Vaccination for pneumococcus, H. influenza and meningococcus should be given pre-operatively if possible to minimize the chance of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI), a rapid-developing and potentially fatal type of septicaemia. The spleen is located and disconnected from its arteries. The ligaments holding the spleen in place, gastrosplenic ligament, splenorenal ligament and splenocolic ligament, are dissected and the organ is removed. In some cases, one or more accessory spleens are discovered and also removed during surgery. The incisions are closed and when indicated, a drain is left. If necessary, tissue samples are sent to a laboratory for analysis. Side effects Splenectomy causes an increased risk of sepsis due to encapsulated organisms (such as S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae). It has been found that the risk of acquiring sepsis is 10 to 20 times higher in a splenectomized patient compared to a non- splenectomized patient, which can result in death, especially in young children. Therefore, patients are administered the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar), Hib vaccine, and the meningococcal vaccine post-operatively (see asplenia). These bacteria often cause a sore throat under normal circumstances but after splenectomy, when infecting bacteria cannot be adequately opsonized, the infection becomes more severe. An increase in blood leukocytes can occur following a splenectomy. The post-splenectomy platelet count may rise to abnormally high levels (thrombocytosis), leading to an increased risk of potentially fatal clot formation. Mild thrombocytosis may be observed after a splenectomy due to the lack of sequestering and destruction of platelets that would normally be carried out by the spleen. In addition, the splenectomy may result in a slight increase in the production of platelets within the bone marrow. Normally, erythrocytes are stored and removed from the circulating blood by the spleen, including the removal of damaged erythrocytes. However, after a splenectomy the lack of presence of the spleen means this function cannot be carried out so damaged erythrocytes will continue to circulate in the blood and can release substances into the blood. If these damaged erythrocytes have a procoagulant activity then the substances they release can lead to the development of a procoagulant state and this can cause thromboembolic events e.g. pulmonary embolism, portal vein thrombosis and deep vein thrombosis. There also is some conjecture that post-splenectomy patients may be at elevated risk of subsequently developing diabetes. Splenectomy may also lead to chronic neutrophilia. Splenectomy patients typically have Howell-Jolly bodies and less commonly Heinz bodies in their blood smears. Heinz bodies are usually found in cases of G6PD (Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase) and chronic liver disease. A splenectomy also results in a greatly diminished frequency of memory B cells. A 28-year follow-up of 740 World War II veterans who had their spleens removed on the battlefield showed a significant increase in the usual death from pneumonia (6 deaths rather than the expected 1.74) and an increase in the deaths from ischemic heart disease (41 deaths rather than the expected 30.26) but not from other conditions. Partial splenectomy Much of the spleen's protective roles can be maintained if a small amount of spleen can be left behind. Where clinically appropriate, attempts are now often made to perform either surgical subtotal (partial) splenectomy, or partial splenic embolization. In particular, whilst vaccination and antibiotics provide good protection against the risks of asplenia, this is not always available in poorer countries. However, as it may take some time for the preserved splenic tissue to provide the full protection, it has been advised that preoperative vaccination still be given.

He was Archbishop of Paris from 1981 until his resignation in 2005. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1983 by Pope John Paul II. His life is depicted in the 2013 film Le m√©tis de Dieu (The Jewish Cardinal). Life and work=Early years Lustiger was born Aaron Lustiger in Paris to a Jewish family. His parents, Charles and Gis√®le Lustiger, were Ashkenazi Jews from Bƒôdzin, Poland, who had left Poland around World War I.Sophie de Ravinel, Le cardinal Lustiger est mort, Le Figaro, 5 August 2007 Lustiger's father ran a hosiery shop. Aaron Lustiger studied at the Lyc√©e Montaigne in Paris, where he first encountered anti- Semitism.Henri Tincq, L'adieu √† Jean-Marie Lustiger, Le Monde, 6 August 2007 Interview with the Israeli daily, Yediot Ahronoth, published in 1982 by the journal Le D√©bat (quoted by Sophie de Ravinel, Le cardinal Lustiger est mort, Le Figaro, 5 August 2007) Visiting Germany in 1937, he was hosted by an anti- Nazi Protestant family whose children had been required to join the Hitler Youth. Sometime between the ages of ten and twelve, Lustiger came across a Protestant Bible and felt inexplicably attracted to it. On the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the family moved to Orl√©ans.Cardinal Lustiger, The Telegraph, 7 August 2007 In March 1940, during Holy Week, the 13-year-old Lustiger decided to convert to Roman Catholicism. On 21 August he was baptized as Aaron Jean-Marie by the Bishop of Orl√©ans, Jules Marie Courcoux. His sister converted later.John Tagliabue, French Catholic leader, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, dies at 80, International Herald Tribune, 6 August 2007 In October 1940, the Vichy regime passed the first Statute on Jews, which forced Jews in France to wear a yellow badge. Although Jean-Marie Lustiger lived hidden in Orl√©ans, his parents had to wear the badge. Lustiger, his father, and sister sought refuge in unoccupied southern France, while his mother returned to Paris to run the family business. In September 1942, his mother was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp where she was murdered the following year. The surviving family returned to Paris at the end of the war. Lustiger's father tried unsuccessfully to have his son's baptism annulled, and even sought the help of the chief rabbi of Paris.Cardinal Lustiger, The Telegraph, 7 August 2007 Early career Lustiger graduated from the Sorbonne with a literature degree in 1946. He entered the seminary of the Carmelite fathers in Paris, and later the Institut Catholique de Paris. He first visited Israel in 1951. On 17 April 1954 he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop √âmile- Ars√®ne Blanchet, rector of the Institut Catholique. From 1954 to 1959 he was a chaplain at the Sorbonne. For the next ten years, he was the director of Richelieu Centre, which trains university chaplains and counsels lay teachers and students of the grandes √©coles, graduate schools such as the √âNS-Fontenay- Saint-Cloud or the Ecole des Chartes. From 1969 to 1979, Lustiger was vicar of the Parish of Sainte-Jeanne-de-Chantal, in the wealthy 16th arrondissement of Paris. His parochial assistant was Andr√© Vingt-Trois, who years later would succeed him as Archbishop of Paris. On 10 November 1979, Lustiger was appointed Bishop of Orl√©ans by Pope John Paul II after a 15-month vacancy. John Paul had been advised by Cardinal Paolo Bertoli, who was displeased with a new illustrated Catechism for French urban youth (Pierres vivantes) and was on bad terms with most of the French clergy.Christian Terras, Jean-Marie Lustiger : un colosse aux pieds d‚Äôargile, 6 August 2007 Lustiger received his episcopal consecration on 8 December 1979 from Cardinal Fran√ßois Marty, with Archbishop Eug√®ne Ernoult of Sens and Bishop Daniel P√©zeril serving as co- consecrators. When installed as bishop, Lustiger avoided all reference to his liberal predecessor Guy-Marie Riob√©, a pacifist closely allied to Catholic Action. Archbishop of Paris (1981‚Äì2005) Lustiger with Pope John Paul II in Bosnia, 1997; Cardinal Franjo Kuhariƒá on right On 31 January 1981 Lustiger was named Archbishop of Paris, succeeding Cardinal Marty. According to Georges Suffert, he was supported by a letter to John Paul II from Andr√© Frossard. Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, the founder of the Traditionalist Catholic group Society of Saint Pius X, criticized his nomination. He said that the position was being given to \\"someone who is not truly of French origin\\". Liberal French clergy considered Lustiger's nomination a defeat for them. Lustiger was considered a first-rate communicator and he was a personal friend of Jean G√©lamur, head of the Catholic media group Bayard Presse. The new archbishop was particularly attentive to the media; he developed Catholic radio and television channels (Radio Notre-Dame) after Fran√ßois Mitterrand's liberalization of French media in 1981. He founded KTO TV in 1999, which struggled financially. Lustiger also founded a new seminary for training priests, bypassing the existing arrangements. He was considered, primarily by his critics, to be authoritarian, earning him the nickname of \\"Bulldozer\\". Lustiger deposed the vicars general Michel Guittet and Pierre Gervaise, had Georges Gilson transferred to Le Mans and Emile Marcus to Nantes, personally headed the meetings of the episcopal council, and made numerous other changes. He dismantled P. B√©guerie's team in Saint-S√©verin. In October 1981, the French bishops elected the more liberal Jean Vilnet as President of the Episcopal Conference, with whom Lustiger was on difficult terms throughout his life. In 1982, he invited for the celebration of Lent in Notre-Dame Roger Etchegaray (whom he disliked at first) and the Jesuit Roger Heckel. He participated in the annual meeting of the movement Comunione e Liberazione in Rimini in summer 1982. In January 1983 he invited Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger to Notre-Dame de Paris, where the latter criticized new catechisms proposed by a large part of the French clergy. He was incardinated Cardinal-Priest of Santi Marcellino e Pietro by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 2 February 1983, at the same time as the Jesuit theologian Henri de Lubac. On 26 November 1994, he was named Cardinal-Priest of San Luigi dei Francesi. As a cardinal, Lustiger began to attract international attention. He was considered papabile, or eligible for election as pope. Certain Catholic circles interpreted the Prophecy of Malachy in reference to him as a Jewish Pope. Lustiger carried out several reforms in the Archdiocese of Paris concerning priests' formation, creating in 1984 an independent theological faculty in the √âcole cath√©drale de Paris, distinct from the Institut Catholique. He constructed seven new churches in Paris. In addition, he supported the development of charismatic movements, such as the Emmanuel Community (of which he was in charge until June 2006) and the Chemin Neuf Community. The latter was recognized in 1984 by the Vatican as an International Association of the Faithful. Some parishes were entrusted to charismatic movements. In Paris, he ordained 200 priests; they represented 15 percent of the French total, and were drawn from a diocese which had two per cent of the French population. Strongly attached to the ideal of priestly celibacy, Lustiger used his position as Ordinary for Orientals to prevent the deployment of married Eastern Rite Catholic priests in France. He favoured development of a permanent diaconate, to be filled mainly by married men involved in the workplace. In 1984, Lustiger led a mass rally at Versailles in opposition to the Savary Law, which reduced state aid to private (which was mostly Catholic) education. He was seen to surpass his comrades Jean Vilnet, Paul Guiberteau and Jean Honor√©, who were leaders on the issue. Shortly afterwards Alain Savary had to resign. This opposition cemented Lustiger's relations with the groups supporting private education, from whose midst he was to draw most of his candidates for the priesthood. He supported the 1905 Law on the Separation of Church and State, but, when testifying before the Commission Stasi on secularism, he opposed the 2004 French law on secularity, which limited conspicuous religious symbols in schools.La Croix, 24 September 2003 Lustiger had his right-hand man, Andr√© Vingt-Trois, appointed bishop in 1988. Following Marcel Lefebvre's schism in June 1988, Lustiger tried to reduce tensions with the Traditionalist Catholics, celebrating a Tridentine Mass and sending conservative priest Patrick Le Gal as his emissary to Lefebvre. Along with Cardinal Albert Decourtray, he strongly criticised Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ in 1988, clashing with the liberal bishop Jacques Gaillot. Along with his clerical contacts, Lustiger maintained contacts with the political world. He developed rather good working relations with Fran√ßois Mitterrand's Socialist government, despite their political disagreements. During the celebrations of the second centenary of the French Revolution in 1989, he opposed Minister of Culture Jack Lang about the Pantheonization of the Abb√© Gr√©goire, one of the first priests to take the oath on the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. For this, he was criticized by the liberal Catholic review Golias.Quand Mgr Lustiger corrige l‚Äôabb√© Gr√©goire, Golias, 4 August 2006 He deposed the priest Alain Maillard de La Morandais from his diplomatic functions toward the political sphere, as he considered him to be too pro-Balladur during the 1995 presidential campaign. Despite his opposition to Mitterrand's governments, Lustiger, as Archbishop of Paris. presided over Mitterrand's funeral. Lustiger's search for dialogue with politicians led to his founding in 1992 of the Centre Pastoral d'Etudes politiques at St. Clotilde church in the 7th arrondissement, close to the hub of the French establishment. He sought to identify and conciliate rising national √©lites in politics and communication. He was less amenable to initiatives from non-French Catholic groups or individuals (their position was inconclusively debated at the Diocesan Synod). Relations with the cultural sphere were promoted by a series of Lenten Sermons at Notre-Dame (into which dialogue with prominent French intellectuals and state-employed academics were introduced) and by plans for the opening of the Centre St. Bernard in the 5th arrondissement. Lustiger was never elected as head of the Conf√©rence des √©v√™ques de France (French Episcopal Conference) by his peers, with whom he was not popular. He was elected a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1995, succeeding Albert Decourtray and bypassing Cardinal Paul Poupard. Two years later, he organized a World Youth Day in Paris, attended by more than a million people. Theology and ethics Lustiger upheld papal authority in theology and morals: \\"There are opinions and there is faith,\\" he said in 1997. \\"When it is faith, I agree with the Pope because I am responsible for the faith.\\" Cardinal Lustiger was a strong believer in priestly celibacy and opposed abortion and the ordination of women. Although he fully endorsed John Paul II's views on bioethics, he considered condom use acceptable if one of the partners had HIV. He founded the Non-Governmental Organization Tib√©riade to attend to AIDS patients. He considered Christianity to be the accomplishment of Judaism, and the New Testament to be the logical continuation of the Old Testament. In Le Choix de Dieu (The Choice of God, 1987), he declared that modern anti-Semitism was the product of the Enlightenment, whose philosophy he attacked. He read the Thomistic philosophers √âtienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain‚Äîone of the main Catholic thinkers of his youth‚Äîas well as Jean Guitton, but also the Protestant philosopher Paul Ric≈ìur, and Maurice Clavel, and the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. Close to Augustinism, he preferred the post- conciliar theologian Louis Bouyer to the (pre-conciliar) neo-Thomist Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange. His main influence was Henri de Lubac, as well as the Jesuits Albert and Paul Chapelle. Lustiger, unlike other leading twentieth- century French bishops, did not draw noticeably on patristic writings and was more sensitive to rabbinic texts. When appointed to Paris he encouraged some liberal clergy to return to the lay state. He was influential in the appointment of his moderate conciliar auxiliary Georges Gilson to the See of Le Mans, replacing senior clergy with men who shared similar views to his own. He pursued ecumenism but also gave a critical address on Anglicanism when welcoming Archbishop Robert Runcie to Notre Dame. In 1995, Lustiger played a key role in deposing the liberal bishop of √âvreux, Jacques Gaillot, who was then transferred to the titular see of Partenia. Lustiger was an outspoken opponent of racism and anti-Semitism. He was strongly critical of Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the French National Front, comparing Le Pen's xenophobic views to Nazism. \\"We have known for 50 years that the theory of racial inequality can be deadly. ...It entails outrages.\\" He also said: \\"The Christian faith says that all men are equal in dignity because they are all created in the image of God.\\" He supported the action of the parish priest of St. Bernard-de-la-Chapelle in accepting the protracted sit-in of a group of undocumented immigrants in 1996, but subsequently showed less sympathy to such activities. The police were called to a similar sit-in at St. Merry. He incurred the hostility of some in the Spanish Church because he strongly opposed the project to canonize Queen Isabella I of Castile. In 1974, Pope Paul VI had opened her cause for beatification, which placed her on the path toward possible sainthood. Lustiger's opposition was due to the fact that Isabella and her husband Ferdinand of Aragon had expelled Jews from her domains in 1492. Lustiger was a favorite of Pope John Paul II. He had a Polish background and staunchly upheld the Pope's conservative views in the face of much hostility from liberal Catholic opinion in France. This led to some speculation that Lustiger would be a candidate to succeed John Paul II, but he always refused to discuss any such possibility. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. Relations with the Jewish world Along with Cardinal Francis Arinze and Bishop Jean-Baptiste Gourion of Jerusalem, Lustiger was one of only three prelates of his time who were converts to the Roman Catholic faith; he and Gourion were the only two who were born Jewish and still considered themselves \\"Jewish\\" all their lives. He said he was proud of his Jewish origins and described himself as a \\"fulfilled Jew\\", for which he was chastised by Christians and Jews alike. Former Chief Ashkenazi Rabbi of Israel Yisrael Meir Lau publicly denounced Lustiger. Lau accused Lustiger of betraying the Jewish people by converting to Catholicism. Archbishop's Israel visit prompts betrayal charges, 26 April, Reuters mirrored by Nizkor Project . Lustiger, who claimed that he was still a Jew, considered being \\"Jewish\\" as an ethnic designation and not exclusively a religious one. Lustiger's strong support for the State of Israel, conflicting with the Vatican's officially neutral position, also won him Jewish support. On becoming Archbishop of Paris, Lustiger said: > I was born Jewish and so I remain, even if that is unacceptable for many. > For me, the vocation of Israel is bringing light to the goyim. That is my > hope and I believe that Christianity is the means for achieving it. The former chief rabbi of France, Rabbi Ren√© Samuel Sirat, says he personally witnessed Lustiger entering the synagogue to recite kaddish‚Äîthe Jewish mourners' prayer‚Äîfor his mother.Daniel Ben Simon, 'He'd say kaddish for his mother', Haaretz, 7 August 2007 Cardinal Lustiger gained recognition after negotiating in 1987 with representatives of the organized Jewish community (including Th√©o Klein, the former president of the CRIF)Th√©o Klein, Aaron- Jean-Marie Lustiger, mon cousin, Le Monde, 8 August 2007 the departure of the Carmelite nuns who built a convent in Auschwitz concentration camp (see Auschwitz cross).

In 1998, Lustiger was awarded the Nostra Aetate Award for advancing Catholic-Jewish relations by the Center for Christian-Jewish Understanding, an interfaith group housed on the campus of Sacred Heart University, a Catholic university at Fairfield, Connecticut, in the United States. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group, protested the award, saying it was \\"inappropriate\\" to honor Lustiger, who was born a Jew but left the faith. \\"It's fine to have him speak at a conference or colloquium,\\" said the league's national director Abraham Foxman. \\"But I don't think he should be honored because he converted out, which makes him a poor example.\\" In France, however, Lustiger enjoyed good relations with the Jewish community. Th√©o Klein observed that although conversions usually carry negative connotations in the Jewish world, it was not so with the Cardinal.Catherine Corroler, \\"Jean-Marie Lustiger, mort d'un cardinal d'action\\" in Lib√©ration, 6 August 2007 Read here Klein called Lustiger \\"his cousin\\". In 2004 and 2006, Lustiger visited New York and included visits to the Bobover Rebbe (who blessed him), Yeshiva University, JTSA, and Yeshivat Chovevei Torah where he addressed the students and faculty along with fellow visiting European bishops. The World Jewish Congress paid homage to him after his death.Statement of the World Jewish Congress on the Death of French Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, PRNewswire-USNewswire, 6 August 2007 Retirement and death When Lustiger reached the age of 75 on 17 September 2001, he submitted his resignation as Archbishop of Paris to Pope John Paul II, as required by canon law. The Pope kept it on file for some years. But on 11 February 2005, Lustiger's resignation was accepted and Andr√© Vingt-Trois, a former auxiliary bishop of Paris who had become Archbishop of Tours, succeeded him as Archbishop of Paris. Lustiger made his final public appearance in January 2007. He died on 5 August 2007 at a clinic outside Paris where he had been battling bone and lung cancer since April. Le Figaro, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, announced Lustiger's death. The funeral, presided over by Cardinal Lustiger's successor, was held at Notre Dame Cathedral on 10 August 2007.

It was created by writ for Roger de Mowbray in 1283. It was held for a long time by the Mowbray and Howard Dukes of Norfolk. The title was united with the Barony of Segrave in 1368, when John Mowbray, 1st Earl of Nottingham and 5th Baron Mowbray succeeded to that title. Then, it became united with the Dukedom of Norfolk. The two titles were frequently separated due to the attainders of the dukes of Norfolk, and were later reunited upon the dukes' restorations. The final separation occurred with the death of the ninth duke, when the barony of Mowbray fell into abeyance. Thereafter, it was united with the Barony of Stourton after it, and the barony of Segrave, were brought out of abeyance in the nineteenth century in favour of the twentieth Baron Stourton. The baronies of Mowbray and Segrave were shortly separated, as the barony of Segrave was called out of abeyance about two weeks after the barony of Mowbray.

The title was created in 1550 for Walter Devereux, 10th Baron Ferrers of Chartley. History The Devereux () family is of Norman descent and came to England after the Norman conquest in 1066 ‚Äì this branch lorded over Lyonshall and Bodenham, Herefordshire, as their main estates. Sir Walter Devereux (died 1485) married Anne Ferrers, 8th Baroness Ferrers of Chartley (d. 1469) (see the Baron Ferrers of Chartley for earlier history of this title). He was summoned to Parliament as Lord Ferrers of Chartley in her right. Devereux was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, fighting on the side of King Henry VII. Their son, the eighth Baron, married Cicely, daughter of William Bourchier, Viscount Bourchier, son of Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex and 5th Baron Bourchier) (see the Baron Bourchier for more information on the Bourchier family). He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Baron, who served with distinction in the French Wars of King Henry VIII and was honoured in 1550 when he was created Viscount Hereford in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by a grandson, the son of his second son, Hon. Sir Richard Devereux. This latter Walter Devereux was also a prominent soldier during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Lord Hereford was a Field Marshal of the forces sent to quell the Northern Rebellion of 1569 and led an expedition to occupy Ulster in 1573. In 1570, he succeeded his first cousin twice removed as eighth Baron Bourchier in right of his great- grandmother Cecily Bourchier. In 1572, the earldom of Essex held by the Bourchier family (which had become extinct in 1540) was revived when he was created Earl of Essex in the Peerage of England. On his death the titles passed to his son Robert, the second Earl. He was the highly trusted courtier, soldier and favourite of Queen Elizabeth I. However, Lord Essex after many years defied the Queen and tried to raise a rebellion in London. He was condemned to death for high treason and beheaded in the Tower of London on 25 February 1601. His titles were forfeited. However, his son Robert was restored in blood in 1603 and became the third Earl. He later fought as a Parliamentarian in the Civil War, leading the Parliamentary forces against Charles I at the Battle of Edgehill, the first major battle of the Civil War. He died on 14 September 1646 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on the 19 October, both Houses of Parliament attending the funeral. On Lord Essex's death the earldom of Essex became extinct. The barony of Ferrers of Chartley and barony of Bourchier fell into abeyance. leaving the viscountcy alone continuing (extant). The Hereford viscountcy was inherited by the 4th Viscount's cousin, Sir Walter Devereux, 2nd Baronet, who became the 5th Viscount Hereford. He had previously represented in different parliaments Worcester, Tamworth and Lichfield in the House of Commons. The titles descended from father to son until the death of his grandson, the seventh Viscount, in 1683. This Viscount died at the age of nine and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Viscount. He died childless at an early age and was succeeded by his second cousin once removed, the ninth Viscount. He was the great-grandson of Sir George Devereux, brother of the fifth Viscount, and had served as Member of Parliament for Montgomery prior to his succession in 1700. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire 1711‚Äì14. His son, the 10th Viscount, represented Montgomery in Parliament for over 20 years until his succession in 1740. He died without male issue and was succeeded by his kinsman, the 11th Viscount. He was a great-great grandson of Sir George Devereux mentioned. Lord Hereford was succeeded by his eldest son, the 12th Viscount. He was childless and on his death in 1783 the titles passed to his younger brother, the 13th Viscount, who moved the principal Welsh seat of the viscountcy from Montgomeryshire to Pencoyd in Brecknockshire. He was succeeded by his son, the 14th Viscount. He was a Tory politician and served under the Duke of Wellington as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners from 1828 to 1830 and under Sir Robert Peel as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms from 1834 to 1835. The 15th Viscount, the Reverend Robert, was an Hon. Canon of Durham. From 1924, the 17th Viscount resided at Hampton Court, Herefordshire, which was sold by his grandson, the 18th Viscount, in 1972. The 18th Viscount instead chose to make his home at Haseley Court, Oxfordshire, which he relinquished in 1982, when he settled at Lyford Cay, near Nassau, in the Bahamas. The titles are held by the 19th Viscount, who succeeded his father in 2004. The Devereux baronetcy, of Castle Bromwich in the County of Warwick, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1611 for the Hon. Edward Devereux, seated at Castle Bromwich Hall, landowner and the fourth son of the first Viscount Hereford. He had briefly served Tamworth in the House of Commons. His eldest son succeeded his first cousin twice removed downwards as fifth Viscount Hereford in 1646.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage Volume 1 1900 The viscountcy of Hereford is the senior viscountcy in the Peerage of England.

Early life and education A native of Laurel in southern Mississippi, Pickering attended Jones County Junior College and then received a bachelor of arts degree in 1959 from the University of Mississippi at Oxford. He earned his bachelor of laws in 1961 from the University of Mississippi School of Law. Career In the early 1960s, Pickering was active in the Democratic Party, but he switched affiliation in 1964 to the Mississippi Republican Party. At the time, Pickering said that ‚Äúthe people of his state were heaped with humiliation and embarrassment at the Democratic Convention‚Äù in Atlantic City, New Jersey. At the convention, African Americans, who had been disenfranchised in the Deep South except during Reconstruction, formed the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party to challenge the party regulars. A month before the convention, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Along with other disaffected Democrats, Pickering played a key role in building his state's Republican Party.Crespino, Joseph. (2007). In Search of Another Country: Mississippi and the Conservative Counterrevolution. Princeton: Princeton University Press. p.103.Kornacki, Steve (2011-02-03) ‚ÄòThe 'Southern Strategy', fulfilled‚Äô, Salon.com As a young prosecutor in the 1960s, Pickering worked closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to pursue the Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi, according to the United States Senate Congressional Record from October 30, 2003. In 1966, he testified against Klan member Sam Bowers, who was being tried for the murder of civil rights activist Vernon Dahmer. After testifying, Pickering and his family needed FBI protection. The Klan later claimed victory when Pickering was defeated in his campaign for a seat in the Mississippi House of Representatives. Pickering was once a law partner of Carroll Gartin, a Democrat who served a third term as lieutenant governor from 1964 until his death in office in 1966. Gartin had won the position over the Democrat-turned- Republican Stanford Morse of Gulfport, a former member of the Mississippi State Senate. Morse ran on the Republican gubernatorial ticket headed by former Democrat Rubel Phillips, formerly of Corinth, the first serious attempt by the GOP in a post-Reconstruction gubernatorial contest in Mississippi.Billy Hathorn, ‚ÄòChallenging the Status Quo: Rubel Lex Phillips and the Mississippi Republican Party (1963-1967)‚Äô, The Journal of Mississippi History XLVII, November 1985, No. 4, p. 240-264 Pickering was appointed and served as city prosecuting attorney in Laurel. He was thereafter elected and served four years as the Jones County prosecutor. After serving briefly as Laurel municipal judge, he was elected to two terms in the Mississippi State Senate from 1972 to 1980. In 1978, Pickering sought the Republican nomination for the United States Senate seat being vacated by the veteran Democrat James O. Eastland, but he lost his party's nomination to U.S. Representative Thad Cochran of Mississippi's 4th congressional district. Cochran in a three-way general election won by a plurality against Democrat Maurice Dantin and Independent Charles Evers, a well-known figure in the civil rights movement. In 1979 Pickering ran for state attorney general, but he lost to the Democrat and later Governor William Allain. He ran on the ticket headed for the second consecutive time by the GOP gubernatorial nominee, businessman Gil Carmichael of Meridian. From 1976 to 1978, Pickering was the chairman of the Mississippi Republican Party, having succeeded Clarke Reed. In 1976, Pickering chaired the subcommittee of the Republican Party's Platform Committee, which called for a constitutional amendment to overturn Roe v. Wade, which established a woman's right to abortion. In 1984, as president of the Mississippi Baptist Convention, Pickering was presiding when the Convention adopted a resolution calling for legislation to outlaw abortion unless the life of the woman was in danger. On October 2, 1990, Pickering was appointed to the district court by United States President George H. W. Bush. Fifth Circuit nomination On May 25, 2001, during the 107th Congress, President George W. Bush nominated Pickering for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated by Henry Anthony Politz who had taken senior status in 1999, but Pickering's nomination was not acted upon favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee then under the control of Democratic senator, Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat. Nevertheless, on January 7, 2003, President Bush renominated Pickering to the same position. With the Republicans now in charge of the committee during the 108th Congress, Pickering's nomination was voted out to the full Senate. With no way to stop his confirmation, the Senate Democrats chose to filibuster Pickering in order to prevent him from receiving a straight up-or-down confirmation vote. Democratic opposition to Pickering was based mainly upon two factors. First, during two hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he maintained a position opposing abortion. Second, he was accused of ‚Äúglaring racial insensitivity‚Äù because of a 1994 hate-crimes case in which he decided that 25-year-old Daniel Swan, who had participated with two others in a cross burning, should receive a reduced sentence. The other participants in the cross-burning had escaped jail sentences for the crime because of plea bargaining. During the course of testimony, Pickering came to suspect that the Civil Rights Division had made a plea bargain with the wrong defendant. He felt that one of the other defendants, a 17-year-old, was more likely the ringleader of the group. When it came time to sentence Swan, Pickering questioned whether it made sense that the most-guilty defendant got off with a misdemeanor and no jail time, while a less-guilty defendant would be sentenced to seven and a half years in prison. ‚ÄúThe recommendation of the government in this instance is clearly the most egregious instance of disproportionate sentencing recommended by the government in any case pending before this court,‚Äù Pickering wrote. ‚ÄúThe defendant [Swan] clearly had less racial animosity than the juvenile.‚Äù Pickering sentenced Swan to two years in prison rather than to the seven and a half years originally requested by the Justice Department. The Clinton Department of Justice later agreed with Pickering and requested a two-year sentence instead.http://www.nationalreview.com/york/york010903b.asp Groups that opposed Pickering's confirmation to the Fifth Circuit included: the national (but not the Mississippi chapter) of the NAACP, the Legislative Black Caucus, the Magnolia Bar Association, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and the Mississippi Worker's Center for Human Rights, the Congressional Black Caucus, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Alliance for Justice, the Human Rights Campaign, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the National Bar Association, the American Association of University Women, the National Women's Law Center, the National Partnership for Women and Families, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the National Women's Political Caucus, the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of School Administrators, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, the United Steelworkers of America, among others. However, Pickering's nomination was supported by several past leaders of the NAACP in Mississippi. One of his strongest supporters was former senatorial candidate Charles Evers, brother of the slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers. Senate Republicans failed to overcome a filibuster of Pickering's nomination on October 30, 2003, when he did not receive enough votes to invoke cloture and end debate on his nomination. Frustrated with the obstruction of the Senate Democrats, on January 16, 2004, President George W. Bush gave Pickering a recess appointment to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal. In December 2004, unable to overcome his filibuster and with his recess appointment about to end, Pickering announced that he was withdrawing his name from consideration as a nominee to the Fifth Circuit and retiring from the federal bench. He later was replaced as a nominee by Michael B. Wallace, but Wallace's nomination was also eventually withdrawn because of Democratic opposition. Only in 2007 was the seat allowed to be filled with Leslie H. Southwick, who was confirmed. Personal life Pickering is married to Margaret Ann Pickering, with whom he has three daughters and one son, former U.S. Representative Charles \\"Chip\\" Pickering Jr. They have twenty-one grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

Most presidential doctrines are related to the Cold War. Though many U.S. presidents had themes related to their handling of foreign policy, the term doctrine generally applies to presidents such as James Monroe, Harry S. Truman, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, all of whom had doctrines which more completely characterized their foreign policy. Presidential doctrines=Monroe Doctrine U.S. president James Monroe. The Monroe Doctrine, expressed in 1823, proclaimed the United States' opinion that European powers should no longer colonize the Americas or interfere with the affairs of sovereign nations located in the Americas, such as the United States, Mexico, Gran Colombia and others. In return, the United States planned to stay neutral in wars between European powers and in wars between a European power and its colonies. However, if these latter type of wars were to occur in the Americas, the U.S. would view such action as hostile toward itself. The doctrine was issued by President James Monroe during this seventh annual State of the Union address to Congress. It was met first with doubt, then with enthusiasm. This was a defining moment in U.S. foreign policy. The doctrine was conceived by its authors, especially John Quincy Adams, as a proclamation by the States of moral opposition to colonialism, but has subsequently been re-interpreted in a wide variety of ways, including by President Theodore Roosevelt as a license for the U.S. to practice its own form of colonialism (known as the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine.) Roosevelt Corollary A political cartoonists' commentary on Roosevelt's \\"big stick\\" policy The Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine was a substantial alteration (called an \\"amendment\\") of the Monroe Doctrine by U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. In its altered state, the Monroe Doctrine would now consider Latin America as an agency for expanding U.S. commercial interests in the region, along with its original stated purpose of keeping European hegemony from the hemisphere. In essence, Roosevelt's Monroe Doctrine would be the basis for a use of economic and military hegemony to make the U.S. the dominant power in the Western Hemisphere. The new doctrine was a frank statement that the U.S. was willing to seek leverage over Latin American governments by acting as an international police power in the region. This announcement has been described as the policy of \\"speaking softly but carrying a big stick\\", and consequently launched a period of \\"big stick\\" diplomacy, in contrast with later Dollar Diplomacy. Roosevelt's approach was more controversial among isolationist-pacifists in the U.S. Truman Doctrine The 1947 Truman Doctrine was part of the United States' political response to perceived aggression by the Soviet Union in Europe and the Middle East, illustrated through the communist movements in Iran, Turkey and Greece. As a result, American foreign policy towards the USSR shifted, as George F. Kennan phrased it, to that of containment. Under the Truman Doctrine, the United States was prepared to send any money, equipment, or military force to countries that were threatened by the communist government, thereby offering assistance to those countries resisting communism. In U.S. president Harry S Truman's words, it became \\"the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures\\". President Truman made the proclamation in an address to the U.S. Congress on March 12, 1947 amid the crisis of the Greek Civil War (1946‚Äì1949). Truman insisted that if Greece and Turkey did not receive the aid that they needed, they would inevitably fall to communism with consequences throughout the region. Truman signed the act into law on May 22, 1947 which granted $400 million in military and economic aid to Turkey and Greece. However, this American aid was in many ways a replacement for British aid which the British were no longer financially in a position to give. The policy of containment and opposition to communists in Greece for example was carried out by the British before 1947 in many of the same ways it was carried out afterward by the Americans. The doctrine also had consequences elsewhere in Europe. Governments in Western Europe with powerful communist movements, such as Italy and France, were given a variety of assistance and encouraged to keep communist groups out of government. In some respects, these moves were in response to moves by the Soviet Union to purge opposition groups in Eastern Europe out of existence. Eisenhower Doctrine The Eisenhower Doctrine was announced by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in a message to the United States Congress on January 5, 1957. Under the Eisenhower Doctrine, a country could request American economic assistance and/or aid from U.S. military forces if it was being threatened by armed aggression from another state. Eisenhower singled out the Soviet threat in his doctrine by authorizing the commitment of U.S. forces \\"to secure and protect the territorial integrity and political independence of such nations, requesting such aid against overt armed aggression from any nation controlled by international communism\\". The doctrine was motivated in part by an increase in Arab hostility toward the West, and growing Soviet influence in Egypt and Syria following the Suez Crisis of 1956.\\"The Eisenhower Doctrine, 1957\\" In the global political context, the Doctrine was made in response to the possibility of a generalized war, threatened as a result of the Soviet Union's attempt to use the Suez War as a pretext to enter Egypt. Coupled with the power vacuum left by the decline of Great British and French power in the region after their failure in that same war, Eisenhower felt that a strong position needed to better the situation was further complicated by the positions taken by Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was rapidly building a power base and using it to play the Soviets and Americans against each other, taking a position of \\"positive neutrality\\" and accepting aid from the Soviets. The military action provisions of the Doctrine were applied in the Lebanon Crisis the following year, when America intervened in response to a request by that country's president. Kennedy Doctrine The Kennedy Doctrine refers to foreign policy initiatives of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, towards Latin America during his term in office. Kennedy voiced support for the containment of Communism and the reversal of Communist progress in the Western Hemisphere. In his Inaugural address on January 20, 1961, President Kennedy presented the American public with a blueprint upon which the future foreign policy initiatives of his administration would later follow and come to represent. In this address, Kennedy warned \\"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\\"1 He also called upon the public to assist in \\"a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself\\".1 It is in this address that one begins to see the Cold War, us-versus-them mentality that came to dominate the Kennedy administration. Johnson Doctrine The Johnson Doctrine, enunciated by U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson after the United States' intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1965, declared that domestic revolution in the Western Hemisphere would no longer be a local matter when \\"the object is the establishment of a Communist dictatorship\\". Nixon Doctrine The Nixon Doctrine was put forth in a press conference in Guam on July 25, 1969 by Richard Nixon. He stated that the United States henceforth expected its allies to assume primary responsibility for their own military defense. This was the start of the \\"Vietnamization\\" of the Vietnam War. The Doctrine argued for the pursuit of peace through a partnership with American allies. In Nixon's own words (Address to the Nation on the War in Vietnam November 3, 1969) : * First, the United States will keep all of its treaty commitments. * Second, we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security. * Third, in cases involving other types of aggression, we shall furnish military and economic assistance when requested in accordance with our treaty commitments. But we shall look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its defense. The doctrine was also applied by the Nixon administration in the Persian Gulf region, with military aid to Iran and Saudi Arabia, so that these U.S. allies could undertake the responsibility of ensuring peace and stability in the region. According to Michael Klare, author of Blood and Oil: The Dangers and Consequences of America's Growing Petroleum Dependency (New York: Henry Holt, 2004), application of the Nixon Doctrine \\"opened the floodgates\\" of U.S. military aid to allies in the Persian Gulf, and helped set the stage for the Carter Doctrine and for the subsequent direct U.S. military involvement of the Gulf War and the Iraq War. Carter Doctrine The Carter Doctrine was a policy proclaimed by President of the United States Jimmy Carter in his State of the Union Address on January 23, 1980, which stated that the United States would use military force if necessary to defend its national interests in the Persian Gulf region. The doctrine was a response to the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union, and was intended to deter the Soviet Union‚Äîthe Cold War adversary of the United States‚Äîfrom seeking hegemony in the Persian Gulf. After stating that Soviet troops in Afghanistan posed \\"a grave threat to the free movement of Middle East oil\\", Carter proclaimed: :Let our position be absolutely clear: An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force. (full speech) This, the key sentence of the Carter Doctrine, was written by Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's National Security Adviser. Brzezinski modeled the wording of the Carter Doctrine on the Truman Doctrine, and insisted that the sentence be included in the speech \\"to make it very clear that the Soviets should stay away from the Persian Gulf\\". () In The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power, author Daniel Yergin notes that the Carter Doctrine \\"bore striking similarities\\" to a 1903 British declaration, in which British Foreign Secretary Lord Landsdowne warned Russia and Germany that the British would \\"regard the establishment of a naval base or of a fortified port in the Persian Gulf by any other power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal\\".(Yergin, p. 140, 702). Reagan Doctrine The Reagan Doctrine was an important Cold War strategy by the United States to oppose the influence of the Soviet Union by backing anti-communist guerrillas against the communist governments of Soviet-backed client states. It was created partially in response to the Brezhnev Doctrine and was a centerpiece of American foreign policy from the mid-1980s until the end of the Cold War in 1991. =Reagan's definition= Reagan first explained the doctrine in his 1985 State of the Union Address: \\"We must not break faith with those who are risking their lives...on every continent, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua ... to defy Soviet aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth. Support for freedom fighters is self-defense.\\" The Reagan doctrine called for American support of the Contras in Nicaragua, the Mujahideen in Afghanistan and Jonas Savimbi's UNITA movement in Angola, among other anti-communist groups. Clinton Doctrine The Clinton Doctrine is not a clear statement in the way that many other doctrines were. However, in a February 26, 1999, speech, President Bill Clinton said the following, which was considered the Clinton Doctrine: :It's easy ... to say that we really have no interests in who lives in this or that valley in Bosnia, or who owns a strip of brushland in the Horn of Africa, or some piece of parched earth by the Jordan River. But the true measure of our interests lies not in how small or distant these places are, or in whether we have trouble pronouncing their names. The question we must ask is, what are the consequences to our security of letting conflicts fester and spread. We cannot, indeed, we should not, do everything or be everywhere. But where our values and our interests are at stake, and where we can make a difference, we must be prepared to do so. Later statements \\"genocide is in and of itself a national interest where we should act,\\" and \\"we can say to the people of the world, whether you live in Africa, or Central Europe, or any other place, if somebody comes after innocent civilians and tries to kill them en masse because of their race, their ethnic background or their religion, and it's within our power to stop it, we will stop it,\\" augmented the doctrine of interventionism. Bush Doctrine The Bush Doctrine is the set of foreign policies adopted by the president of the United States George W. Bush in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In an address to the United States Congress after the attacks, President Bush declared that the U.S. would \\"make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them\\", a statement that was followed by the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. Subsequently, the Bush Doctrine has come to be identified with a policy that permits preventive war against potential aggressors before they are capable of mounting attacks against the United States, a view that has been used in part as a rationale for the 2003 Iraq War. The Bush Doctrine is a marked departure from the policies of deterrence that generally characterized American foreign policy during the Cold War and brief period between the collapse of the Soviet Union and 9/11, and can also be contrasted with the Kirkpatrick Doctrine of supporting stable right-wing dictatorships that was influential during the Administration of Ronald Reagan. Obama Doctrine The Obama Doctrine is yet to be fully defined, and President Obama himself has expressed a dislike for an overly \\"doctrinaire\\" approach to foreign policy. When asked about his doctrine, Obama has replied that the United States would have to \\"view our security in terms of a common security and a common prosperity with other peoples and other countries\\". On April 16, 2009, E. J. Dionne wrote a column for The Washington Post defining the doctrine as \\"a form of realism unafraid to deploy American power but mindful that its use must be tempered by practical limits and a dose of self- awareness\\". The Obama Doctrine has been praised by some as a welcome change from the dogmatic and aggressive Bush Doctrine. Others, such as Bush appointee and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, have criticized it as overly idealistic and na√Øve, promoting appeasement with the country's enemies. From Politico: President Obama tried to put an end to all this talk of an \\"Obama Doctrine\\" on March 29, 2011, telling Brian Williams that the countries in North Africa and the Middle East are \\"different\\" and can't be subject to the same American policy. \\"I think it's important not to take this particular situation and then try to project some sort of Obama Doctrine that we're going to apply in a cookie-cutter fashion across the board,\\" Obama said.

Michelson feared that if he donated his works to a large museum that they would largely be placed in storage. After Michelson's death in 1978 his wife Janine started to search for a location, and at the suggestion of family friend Wendy Russell Reves, chose Marshall, Texas (Mrs. Reves' birthplace). The museum houses a permanent collection of works; including over a thousand paintings, drawings, and prints by Michelson. The museum's collection has expanded to include pieces not associated with Michelson. In 1999 the museum received the 20th- century American Art collection of Dr. Bernard and Gloria Kronenberg. The collection includes paintings, drawings, lithographs and statues by fifty- three artists including Milton Avery and Georges Rouault. The Ramona and Jay Ward Collection of African Masks is another permanent collection and includes masks of the Yoruba, Senufo, and other West African peoples.

The illusion occurs when the auditory component of one sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, leading to the perception of a third sound. The visual information a person gets from seeing a person speak changes the way they hear the sound. If a person is getting poor quality auditory information but good quality visual information, they may be more likely to experience the McGurk effect. Integration abilities for audio and visual information may also influence whether a person will experience the effect. People who are better at sensory integration have been shown to be more susceptible to the effect. Many people are affected differently by the McGurk effect based on many factors, including brain damage and other disorders. Background It was first described in 1976 in a paper by Harry McGurk and John MacDonald, titled \\"Hearing Lips and Seeing Voices\\" in Nature (23 Dec 1976). This effect was discovered by accident when McGurk and his research assistant, MacDonald, asked a technician to dub a video with a different phoneme from the one spoken while conducting a study on how infants perceive language at different developmental stages. When the video was played back, both researchers heard a third phoneme rather than the one spoken or mouthed in the video. This effect may be experienced when a video of one phoneme's production is dubbed with a sound-recording of a different phoneme being spoken. Often, the perceived phoneme is a third, intermediate phoneme. As an example, the syllables /ba-ba/ are spoken over the lip movements of /ga-ga/, and the perception is of /da-da/. McGurk and MacDonald originally believed that this resulted from the common phonetic and visual properties of /b/ and /g/. Two types of illusion in response to incongruent audiovisual stimuli have been observed: fusions ('ba' auditory and 'ga' visual produce 'da') and combinations ('ga' auditory and 'ba' visual produce 'bga'). This is the brain's effort to provide the consciousness with its best guess about the incoming information.O‚ÄôShea, M. (2005). The Brain: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press The information coming from the eyes and ears is contradictory, and in this instance, the eyes (visual information) have had a greater effect on the brain and thus the fusion and combination responses have been created. Vision is the primary sense for humans, but speech perception is multimodal, which means that it involves information from more than one sensory modality, in particular, audition and vision. The McGurk effect arises during phonetic processing because the integration of audio and visual information happens early in speech perception. The McGurk effect is very robust; that is, knowledge about it seems to have little effect on one's perception of it. This is different from certain optical illusions, which break down once one 'sees through' them. Some people, including those that have been researching the phenomenon for more than twenty years, experience the effect even when they are aware that it is taking place.Rosenblum, L. D. (2010). See what I'm saying: The extraordinary powers of our five senses. New York, NY: W. W. Norton & Company Inc. With the exception of people who can identify most of what is being said from speech- reading alone, most people are quite limited in their ability to identify speech from visual-only signals. A more extensive phenomenon is the ability of visual speech to increase the intelligibility of heard speech in a noisy environment. Visible speech can also alter the perception of perfectly audible speech sounds when the visual speech stimuli are mismatched with the auditory speech. Normally, speech perception is thought to be an auditory process; however, our use of information is immediate, automatic, and, to a large degree, unconscious and therefore, despite what is widely accepted as true, speech is not only something we hear. Speech is perceived by all of the senses working together (seeing, touching, and listening to a face move). The brain is often unaware of the separate sensory contributions of what it perceives. Therefore, when it comes to recognizing speech the brain cannot differentiate whether it is seeing or hearing the incoming information. It has also been examined in relation to witness testimony. Wareham and Wright's 2005 study showed that inconsistent visual information can change the perception of spoken utterances, suggesting that the McGurk effect may have many influences in everyday perception. Not limited to syllables, the effect can occur in whole words and have an effect on daily interactions that people are unaware of. Research into this area can provide information on not only theoretical questions, but also it can provide therapeutic and diagnostic relevance for those with disorders relating to audio and visual integration of speech cues. Internal factors=Damage Both hemispheres of the brain make a contribution to the McGurk effect. They work together to integrate speech information that is received through the auditory and visual senses. A McGurk response is more likely to occur in right-handed individuals for whom the face has privileged access to the right hemisphere and words to the left hemisphere. In people that have had callosotomies done, the McGurk effect is still present but significantly slower. In people with lesions to the left hemisphere of the brain, visual features often play a critical role in speech and language therapy. People with lesions in the left hemisphere of the brain show a greater McGurk effect than normal controls. Visual information strongly influences speech perception in these people. There is a lack of susceptibility to the McGurk illusion if left hemisphere damage resulted in a deficit to visual segmental speech perception. In people with right hemisphere damage, impairment on both visual-only and audio-visual integration tasks is exhibited, although they are still able to integrate the information to produce a McGurk effect. Integration only appears if visual stimuli is used to improve performance when the auditory signal is impoverished but audible. Therefore, there is a McGurk effect exhibited in people with damage to the right hemisphere of the brain but the effect is not as strong as a normal group. DisordersDyslexia= Dyslexic individuals exhibit a smaller McGurk effect than normal readers of the same chronological age, but they showed the same effect as reading-level age-matched readers. Dyslexics particularly differed for combination responses, not fusion responses. The smaller McGurk effect may be due to the difficulties dyslexics have in perceiving and producing consonant clusters. =Specific language impairment= Children with specific language impairment show a significantly lower McGurk effect than the average child. They use less visual information in speech perception, or have a reduced attention to articulatory gestures, but have no trouble perceiving auditory-only cues. =Autism spectrum disorders= Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) showed a significantly reduced McGurk effect than children without. However, if the stimulus was nonhuman (for example bouncing a tennis ball to the sound of a bouncing beach ball) then they scored similarly to children without ASD. Younger children with ASD show a very reduced McGurk effect; however, this diminishes with age. As the individuals grow up, the effect they show becomes closer to those that did not have ASD. It has been suggested that the weakened McGurk effect seen in people with ASD is due to deficits in identifying both the auditory and visual components of speech rather than in the integration of said components (although distinguishing speech components as speech components may be isomorphic to integrating them). =Language-learning disabilities= Adults with language-learning disabilities exhibit a much smaller McGurk effect than other adults. These people are not as influenced by visual input as most people. Therefore, people with poor language skills will produce a smaller McGurk effect. A reason for the smaller effect in this population is that there may be uncoupled activity between anterior and posterior regions of the brain, or left and right hemispheres. Cerebellar or basal ganglia etiology is also possible. =Alzheimer‚Äôs disease= In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is a smaller McGurk effect exhibited than in those without. Often a reduced size of the corpus callosum produces a hemisphere disconnection process. Less influence on visual stimulus is seen in patients with AD, which is a reason for the lowered McGurk effect. =Schizophrenia= The McGurk effect is not as pronounced in schizophrenic individuals as in non-schizophrenic individuals. However, it is not significantly different in adults. Schizophrenia slows down the development of audiovisual integration and does not allow it to reach its developmental peak. However, no degradation is observed. Schizophrenics are more likely to rely on auditory cues than visual cues in speech perception. =Aphasia= People with aphasia show impaired perception of speech in all conditions (visual- only, auditory-only, and audio-visual), and therefore exhibited a small McGurk effect. The greatest difficulty for aphasics is in the visual-only condition showing that they use more auditory stimuli in speech perception. External factors=Cross-dubbing Discrepancy in vowel category significantly reduced the magnitude of the McGurk effect for fusion responses. Auditory /a/ tokens dubbed onto visual /i/ articulations were more compatible than the reverse. This could be because /a/ has a wide range of articulatory configurations whereas /i/ is more limited, which makes it much easier for subjects to detect discrepancies in the stimuli. /i/ vowel contexts produce the strongest effect, while /a/ produces a moderate effect, and /u/ has almost no effect. Mouth visibility The McGurk effect is stronger when the right side of the speaker's mouth (on the viewer's left) is visible. People tend to get more visual information from the right side of a speaker's mouth than the left or even the whole mouth. This relates to the hemispheric attention factors discussed in the brain hemispheres section above. Visual distractors The McGurk effect is weaker when there is a visual distractor present that the listener is attending to. Visual attention modulates audiovisual speech perception. Another form of distraction is movement of the speaker. A stronger McGurk effect is elicited if the speaker's face/head is motionless, rather than moving. Syllable structure A strong McGurk effect can be seen for click-vowel syllables compared to weak effects for isolated clicks. This shows that the McGurk effect can happen in a non-speech environment. Phonological significance is not a necessary condition for a McGurk effect to occur; however, it does increase the strength of the effect. Gender Females show a stronger McGurk effect than males. Women show significantly greater visual influence on auditory speech than men did for brief visual stimuli, but no difference is apparent for full stimuli. Another aspect regarding gender is the issue of male faces and voices as stimuli in comparison to female faces and voices as stimuli. Although, there is no difference in the strength of the McGurk effect for either situation. If a male face is dubbed with a female voice, or vice versa, there is still no difference in strength of the McGurk effect. Knowing that the voice you hear is different from the face you see ‚Äì even if different genders ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt eliminate the McGurk effect. Familiarity Subjects who are familiar with the faces of the speakers are less susceptible to the McGurk effect than those who are unfamiliar with the faces of the speakers. On the other hand, there was no difference regarding voice familiarity. Expectation Semantic congruency had a significant impact on the McGurk illusion. The effect is experienced more often and rated as clearer in the semantically congruent condition relative to the incongruent condition. When a person was expecting a certain visual or auditory appearance based on the semantic information leading up to it, the McGurk effect was greatly increased. Self influence The McGurk effect can be observed when the listener is also the speaker or articulator. While looking at oneself in the mirror and articulating visual stimuli while listening to another auditory stimulus, a strong McGurk effect can be observed. In the other condition, where the listener speaks auditory stimuli softly while watching another person articulate the conflicting visual gestures, a McGurk effect can still be seen, although it is weaker. Temporal synchrony Temporal synchrony is not necessary for the McGurk effect to be present. Subjects are still strongly influenced by auditory stimuli even when it lagged the visual stimuli by 180 milliseconds (point at which McGurk effect begins to weaken). There was less tolerance for the lack of synchrony if the auditory stimuli preceded the visual stimuli. In order to produce a significant weakening of the McGurk effect, the auditory stimuli had to precede the visual stimuli by 60 milliseconds, or lag by 240 milliseconds. Physical task diversion The McGurk effect was greatly reduced when attention was diverted to a tactile task (touching something). Touch is a sensory perception like vision and audition, therefore increasing attention to touch decreases the attention to auditory and visual senses. Gaze The eyes do not need to fixate in order to integrate audio and visual information in speech perception. There was no difference in the McGurk effect when the listener was focusing anywhere on the speaker's face. The effect does not appear if the listener focuses beyond the speaker's face. In order for the McGurk effect to become insignificant, the listener's gaze must deviate from the speaker's mouth by at least 60 degrees. Other languages Whatever the language, all listeners rely on visual information to a degree in speech perception. But the McGurk effect‚Äôs intensity differs across languages. Dutch, English, Spanish, German, Italian and Turkish language listeners experience a robust McGurk effect; Japanese and Chinese listeners, weaker. Most research on the McGurk effect between languages has been between English and Japanese. A smaller McGurk effect occurs in Japanese listeners than English listeners.Hisanaga, S., Sekiyama, K., Igasaki, T., Murayama, N. (2009).

Retrieved from http://www.isca- speech.org/archive/eurospeech_1995/e95_1699.html The cultural practice of face avoidance in Japanese people may diminish the McGurk effect, as well as tone and syllabic structures of the language. This could also be why Chinese listeners are less susceptible to visual cues, and similar to Japanese, produce a smaller effect than English listeners. Studies also show that Japanese listeners do not show a developmental increase in visual influence after six, as English children do. Japanese listeners identify incompatibility between visual and auditory stimuli better than English listeners. This greater ability could relate to Japanese‚Äôs lacking consonant clusters. Regardless, listeners of all languages resort to visual stimuli when speech is unintelligible; the McGurk effect then applies to them equally. The McGurk effect works with listeners of every tested language. Hearing impairment Experiments have been conducted involving hard of hearing individuals as well as individuals that have had cochlear implants. These individuals tend to weigh visual information from speech more heavily than auditory information. In comparison to normal hearing individuals, this is not different unless there is more than one syllable, such as a word. Regarding the McGurk experiment, responses from cochlear implanted users produced the same responses as normal hearing individuals when an auditory bilabial stimulus is dubbed onto a visual velar stimulus. However, when an auditory dental stimulus is dubbed onto a visual bilabial stimulus, the responses are quite different. The McGurk effect is still present in individuals with impaired hearing or using cochlear implants, although it is quite different in some aspects. Infants By measuring an infant's attention to certain audiovisual stimuli, a response that is consistent with the McGurk effect can be recorded. From just minutes to a couple of days old, infants can imitate adult facial movements, and within weeks of birth, infants can recognize lip movements and speech sounds. At this point, the integration of audio and visual information can happen, but not at a proficient level. The first evidence of the McGurk effect can be seen at four months of age; however, more evidence is found for 5-month-olds. Through the process of habituating an infant to a certain stimulus and then changing the stimulus (or part of it, such as ba-voiced/va- visual to da-voiced/va-visual), a response that simulates the McGurk effect becomes apparent. The strength of the McGurk effect displays a developmental pattern that increases throughout childhood and extends into adulthood.

The name \\"woodswallow\\" is a misnomer as they are not closely related to true swallows. Instead, they belong to the family Artamidae, which also includes butcherbirds, currawongs and the Australian magpie. The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1771, its specific epithet derived from the ancient Greek words leukos 'white', and rhynchos 'bill'. Description This woodswallow's soft-plumage is charcoal grey apart from the white underparts that give the species its English and scientific names, in contrast to the related great woodswallow whose upperside is a more glossy black.Coates, Brian J.; The Birds of Papua New Guinea Including the Bismarck Archipelago and Bougainville: Volume 2 - Passerines; pp. 373-375. Despite its brush-tipped tongue, usually associated with nectar feeders, it catches insects on the wing. Natural history This species is often seen tightly bunched together in large flocks on power lines and branches The white- breasted woodswallow has large, pointed wings and is very agile in powered and gliding flight. This is a nomadic species, following the best conditions for flying insects, and often roosting in large flocks. The nest is a small structure built in the hollow formed by a broken branch, or in a forked branch. The normal clutch is three eggs.

Eisenhower signed the bill into law. With an original authorization of $25 billion for the construction of 41,000 miles (66,000 km) of the Interstate Highway System supposedly over a 10-year period, it was the largest public works project in American history through that time. The addition of the term \\"defense\\" in the act's title was for two reasons: First, some of the original cost was diverted from defense funds. Secondly, most U.S. Air Force bases have a direct link to the system. One of the stated purposes was to provide access in order to defend the United States during a conventional or nuclear war with the Soviet Union and its communist allies. All of these links were in the original plans, although some, such as Wright Patterson AFB were not connected up in the 1950s, but only somewhat later. The money for the Interstate Highway and Defense Highways was handled in a Highway Trust Fund that paid for 90% of highway construction costs with the states required to pay the remaining 10 percent. It was expected that the money would be generated through new taxes on fuel, automobiles, trucks, and tires. As a matter of practice, the federal portion of the cost of the Interstate Highway System has been paid for by taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel.  Historical background of the Interstate Highway System  U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Eisenhower's support of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 can be directly attributed to his experiences in 1919 as a participant in the U.S. Army's first Transcontinental Motor Convoy across the United States on the historic Lincoln Highway, which was the first road across America. The highly publicized 1919 convoy was intended, in part, to dramatize the need for better main highways and continued federal aid. The convoy left the Ellipse south of the White House in Washington, D.C., on July 7, 1919, and headed for Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. From there, it followed the Lincoln Highway to San Francisco. Bridges cracked and were rebuilt, vehicles became stuck in mud and equipment broke, but the convoy was greeted warmly by communities across the country. The convoy reached San Francisco on September 6, 1919. The convoy was memorable enough for a young Army officer, 28-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Dwight David Eisenhower, to include a chapter about the trip, titled \\"Through Darkest America With Truck and Tank,\\" in his book At Ease: Stories I Tell to Friends (Doubleday and Company, Inc., 1967). \\"The trip had been difficult, tiring and fun,\\" he said. That experience on the Lincoln Highway, plus his observations of the German autobahn network during World War II, convinced him to support construction of the Interstate System when he became president. \\"The old convoy had started me thinking about good, two-lane highways, but Germany had made me see the wisdom of broader ribbons across the land.\\" His \\"Grand Plan\\" for highways, announced in 1954, led to the 1956 legislative breakthrough that created the Highway Trust Fund to accelerate construction of the Interstate System. Eisenhower advocated for the highways for the purpose of national defense. In the event of a ground invasion by a foreign power, the U.S. Army would need good highways to be able to transport troops and material across the country efficiently. Following completion of the highways the cross-country journey that took the convoy two months in 1919 was cut down to five days.  Tollways  Many limited-access toll highways that had been built prior to the Interstate Highway Act were incorporated into the Interstate system (for example, the Ohio Turnpike carries portions of Interstate 76, I-80 and I-90). For major turnpikes in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kansas, Oklahoma, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and West Virginia, tolls continue to be collected, even though the turnpikes have long since been paid for. The money collected is used for highway maintenance, turnpike improvement projects and states' general funds. (That is not the case in Massachusetts, where the state constitution requires the money be used for transportation.) In addition, there are several major toll bridges and toll tunnels included in the Interstate system, including four bridges in the San Francisco Bay Area, ones linking Delaware with New Jersey, New Jersey with New York, New Jersey with Pennsylvania, the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan, and Indiana and Kentucky in the Louisville area. Tolls collected on Interstate Highways remain on segments of I-95, I-94, I-90, I-88, I-87, I-80, I-77, I-76, I-64, I-44, I-294, I-355 and several others. In addition, some states have built tolled express lanes within existing freeways. Toll turnpikes in the following states have been declared paid off, and those highways have become standard freeways with the removal of tolls: Connecticut (I-95), Kentucky (part of I-65), Maryland (part of I-95), Texas (part of I-30), Virginia (the part of I-95 between Richmond and Petersburg). Additionally, Kentucky has several former toll roads that, in full or part, became part of the Interstate Highway system after the removal of tolls (parts of I-69, I-165, and I-169, with I-69 Spur and I-369 following in the near future).

White-browed woodswallows are highly nomadic travelling in pairs to flocks from hundred to thousands of birds. They often wander irregularly around inland Australia, usually heading north for winter in the Northern Territory and central Queensland, and south in spring for nesting. White-browed woodswallows regularly associate with flocks of the masked woodswallows. Male, Thargomindah SW Queensland  Distribution  The white-browed wood-swallow is found throughout Australia with higher concentrations in central New South Wales. According to the IUCN Redlist, wood-swallow are considered least of concern.  Ecology and Habitat  They inhabit margins of rainforests, woodlands, inland/coastal scrubs, golf courses, vineyards, suburban streets and arid areas of Australia. They make a ‚Äòtchip-tchip‚Äô call similar to masked woodswallows.  Reproduction  Breeding occurs between August and December or after rain. White-browed woodswallows nest in shrubs, forks of trees, hollow stumps or posts, the nest are normally made of twigs, grass and rootlets. The eggs are white/grey, spotted, or blotched brown-grey. A clutch will usually consist of 2 to 3 eggs.  Diet  White-browed woodswallows feed on nector when blossoms are available but mainly feed on insects.

As its name suggests, at 12 to 14 cm in length it is the smallest of the woodswallows. It is dark, smoky brown overall, with deep gunmetal grey wings and a black-tipped, blue- tinged bill. Like other woodswallows, groups cluster huddled close together on high, dead branches to rest or sleep. Typical group sizes are modest but it is not uncommon to have hundreds gather together at a roost site. Little woodswallows soar effortlessly above the treetops or along cliff faces when hunting flying insects--being small, they are easily confused with martins. The nest is a rudimentary affair, placed in a tree hollow or similar space, and made of twigs and other vegetable matter. Breeding takes place from August to January, or after rain. Three eggs are laid and the young leave the nest when barely able to fly, taking up a perch on a nearby tree and calling incessantly for the food the parents bring them.

Many African politicians of the 1950s and 1960s professed their support for African socialism, although definitions and interpretations of this term varied considerably. These politicians include Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, and Fran√ßois Tombalbaye of Chad, among others. Flag of the African Socialist movement  Origins and themes  As many African countries gained independence during the 1960s, some of these newly formed governments rejected the ideas of capitalism in favour of a more afrocentric economic model. Leaders of this period professed that they were practising 'African Socialism'.Socialist Models of Development, p. 851, Charles K. Wilber, Kenneth P. Jameson Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Modibo Keita of Mali, L√©opold Senghor of Senegal, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and S√©kou Tour√© of Guinea, were the main architects of African Socialism according to William H. Friedland and Carl G. Rosberg Jr., editors of the book African Socialism. Common principles of various versions of African socialism were: social development guided by a large public sector, incorporating the African identity and what it means to be African, and the avoidance of the development of social classes within society. Senghor claimed that \\"Africa‚Äôs social background of tribal community life not only makes socialism natural to Africa but excludes the validity of the theory of class struggle,\\" thus making African socialism, in all of its variations, different from Marxism and European socialist theory.  History  The first influential publication of socialist thought tailored for application in Africa occurred in 1956 with the release of Senegalese intellectual Abdoulaye Ly's Les masses africaines et l'actuelle condition humaine.  Variants = Ujamaa  Julius Nyerere The concept, or political ideology of Ujamaa, formed the basis of Julius Nyerere's autarkic social and economic developmental policies in Tanzania after Tanganyika gained independence from its colonial power Britain in 1961 and its union with Zanzibar to form Tanzania in 1964[1]. The word Ujamaa comes from the Swahili word for extended family or familyhood and is distinguished by several key characteristics, namely that a person becomes a person through the people or community. Julius Nyerere's perceived African socialism as being embedded within African culture largely due to its communitarian model, a feature of African lifestyle that had been severely changed during the period of colonisation, and therefore took it upon himself to reestablish it. In 1967, President Nyerere published his development blueprint, which was titled the Arusha Declaration, in which Nyerere pointed out the need for an African model of development. That formed the basis of Tanzania's political vision for the years to come. Julius Nyerere partly based his declaration on the People's Republic of China as he had close contacts with them. Inspired by the Chinese experience of collectivisation under Mao, Tanzania followed a strategy of social equality and autarky. Tanzania's rural areas were reorganised in autonomous communities on the basis of voluntary adhesion wherein the distribution of goods and living conditions were aimed to be as equal as possible. All decisions had to be reached by consensus within the village. The economy was reorganised with the purpose of valuing agricultural output, on the other hand the economic model worked on the assumption that peasants were able to pay back their loans. The Ujamaa village policy was generalised in 1969, only to become obligatory in 1974 which broke the traditional principle of autonomous rule over the village. Nyerere's regime nonetheless remained less authoritarian than those of Nkrumah or S√©kou Tour√© as for instance although a one-party system existed within Tanzania, elections could be disputed between two candidates. In spite of belonging to the same party this form of political confrontation allowed the direct competition of ideas within the party. By 1975 65% of the rural community had been regrouped in so-called Ujamaa villages. The economic targets set by the Arusha Declaration had not been met and living conditions for poor farmers had not improved in the meantime. To add to Julius Nyerere's concerns, bureaucratic inefficiencies hampered effective distribution of resources and clear directives. Ujamaa is ultimately considered to be a political failure and Nyerere himself retired from the political scene in 1985. According to the BBC, \\"while he united his nation and made major advances in the fields of health and education,\\" Julius Nyerere's African socialist \\"Ujamaa\\" collectives \\"proved disastrous for Tanzania's economy\\". By the end of his political tenure, 96% of children had gone to primary school, 50% of them being girls. Female life expectancy had grown from 41 to 50.7 years between 1960 and 1980 and maternal mortality rates dropped from 450 per 100,000 births to under 200 by 1973. Ultimately, Nyerere's Arusha Declaration rested on false preconceptions such as (i) peasants being persuaded that communal agriculture was in their interests, (ii) that capitalist models of agriculture were not a force to be reckoned with, (iii) the participation of small-holders could be easily guaranteed, (iv) a bureaucracy willing to work towards a socialist state and (v) that peasants could be helped to reach self-reliance.  Ubuntu  The ancient Ubuntu philosophy of South Africa recognizes the humanity of a person through their interpersonal relationships. The word comes from the Zulu and Xhosa languages. Ubuntu believes in a bond that ties together all of humanity and the fact that a human being is of a high value. According to Archbishop Desmond Tutu, A man with ubuntu is open and accessible to others, confirming of others, doesn't feel debilitated that others are capable and great, for he or she has a legitimate confidence that originates from realizing that he or she has a place in a more noteworthy entire and is decreased when others are mortified or reduced, when others are tormented or abused.  Harambee  Harambee is a term that originated among natives, specifically Swahili porters of East Africa and the word Harambee traditionally means \\"let us pull together\\". It was taken as an opportunity for local Kenyans to self-develop their communities without waiting on government. This helped build a sense of togetherness in the Kenyan community but analysts state that it has brought about class discrepancies due to the fact that some individuals use this as an opportunity to generate wealth.  Kwame Nkrumah and Nkrumahism  Nkrumahism was the political philosophy of Ghana's first post-independence president Kwame Nkrumah. As one of the first African political leaders, Nkrumah became a major figure in the left-wing pan-African movement. In his piece A declaration to the colonial peoples, Nkrumah called on Africans to \\"...affirm the right of all colonial peoples to control their own destiny.\\" and that \\"All colonies must be free from foreign imperialist control, whether political or economic.\\". His focus on economic and political freedom would prove to be a fundamental part of his overarching political philosophy, combining the nationalist independence movement in his home country of Ghana along with left-wing economic thought. A major figure in the Ghanaian independence movement, Nkrumah came to power shortly after Ghana gained its independence in 1957. Once in power, he began a series of infrastructural and economic development plans designed to stimulate the Ghanaian economy. $16 million was designated to be used to build a new town in Tema to be used as an open seaport for Accra and the eastern region of the country. The government designed a new plan to tackle issues surrounding illiteracy and lack of access to education, with thousands of new schools being built in rural areas. Kwame Nkrumah, the first President of Ghana Determined to industrialize the country rapidly, Nkrumah set out to modernize Ghana's economy in order to better compete with the West. In turn, his government embarked on a strategy of slowly increasing the amount of government-controlled firms in the country while simultaneously putting restrictions on privately-owned companies operating in Ghana. By 1965, the state-controlled 50% of the insurance industry within the country, 60% of all bank deposits were deposited at state- run banks, 17% of the country's sea-bound cargo was handled by state-run firms, 27% of all industrial production was either produced by state-run firms or firms in which the state-controlled a considerable portion and 35% of the country's total imports were handled by the government. Nkrumah also pushed for Ghana to become an international advocate for the spread of socialism and pan-Africanism throughout the newly independent African states. As the first African colonial state to be granted independence, Ghana became an inspiration to many of the nascent left-wing independence movements throughout the continent. In 1958, Nkrumah helped found the Union of Independent African States, a political union between Ghana, Mali, and Guinea. Though the union was short-lived, the proposed political organization marked the first attempt at regional unity among newly established African republics. Nkrumah was also instrumental in pushing Ghana towards the major Communist powers, including the USSR and the PRC. In 1961, he made his first official visit to Moscow, receiving an honorary degree from the University of Moscow. In a speech given in Accra given in front of a visiting Soviet delegation in 1963, Nkrumah said, \\"We in Ghana have formally chosen the socialist path and we will build a socialist society... Thus our countries, the Soviet Union and Ghana, will go forward together.\\"  L√©opold S√©dar Senghor and the Socialist Party of Senegal  L√©opold Senghor was the founder of the Socialist Party of Senegal and the first President of the country. An important figure not only in the political development of the country, but Senghor was also one of the leading figures in the N√©gritude movement, which informed much of his political thought. Senghor would come to embody a new form of African socialism that rejected many of the traditional Marxist modes of thinking that had developed in post-independence Africa. Born into an upper-middle-class family, Senghor was able to take advantage of the French educational system that was afforded to many of Africa's educated colonial elite. However, these schools did little to teach African students about their native culture, instead favoring policies of assimilation into mainstream French life. As Senghor once put it the French wanted \\"bread for all, culture for all, liberty for all; but this liberty, this culture, and this bread will be French.\\" Excelling in his primary education, Senghor enrolled in the University of Paris. After graduating and serving in the French Army during the Second World War, Senghor began a career as a poet in Paris, releasing his first book, Chants d'ombre (Shadow Songs) in 1945 and Anthologie de la nouvelle po√©sie n√®gre et malagache de lengue fran√ßaise (Anthology of the New Black and Malagasy Poetry in 1948. Both pieces were instrumental in developing the bulk of the emerging N√©gretude movement, which Senghor hoped would represent the \\"sum total of the values of the civilization of the African world.\\". President Senghor meeting with President Rafael Caldera of Venezuela His work highlighted the vast inequalities in French colonial society and looked at the unique experience of the thousands of Africans living under French rule. In his piece The Challenge of Culture in French West Africa, Senghor called on Africans to \\"develop a culture based on the strengths of local tradition that was also open to the modern European world\\". Senghor was initially not a supporter of an independent Senegal, worrying that the small African country would have little chance as an independent nation. Instead, he advocated for an interconnected relationship similar to that of Paris and France's provinces. In his piece, Vues sure l'Afrique noir, ou s'assumiler non √™tre assimil√©s (Views on Black Africa, or To Assimilate, Not Be Assimilated), Senghor advocated for popularly elected Senegelese representatives and an executive in Paris, French economic funds to help with Senegalese development, and the inclusion of African cultural and linguistic education in the French educational system. In 1958, referendums were held in all of the French African colonies on the future of the colonial possessions. The debate was between full on independence and joining the French community, a sort of association of former French colonies that would allow countries like Senegal to become independent, but still maintain an economic and diplomatic relations with the French government. Senghor supported the yes side of the vote and Senegal voted 97% in favor of the association. When Senegal became a fully independent country in 1960, Senghor was elected to the presidency. After a failed coup led by his Prime Minister in 1962, the Senghor government moved to abolish the post, which was approved by 99% in referendum. The vote substantially strengthened the power of the President, who no longer had to compete with the Prime Minister for executive power. The Socialist Party compounded its control of Senegalese politics in 1966 when it was declared the country's only legal party, with Senghor as its leader. The one-party system would stay in place until Senghor decided to liberalize the country's election laws by allowing for a 3 party system, with one socialist, one liberal, and one communist party being allowed to contest elections. As president, Senghor represented a moderated version of African Socialism that didn't align with the more radical interpretations seen in other newly independent African states. Unlike other ex-colonies, Senegal remained closely aligned with the French government. They retained the French Franc as the national currency and Senghor was known to consult the French government before making any major foreign policy decisions. He allowed French advisors and companies to remain in Senegal, including in government and educational posts. When asked about nationalizing French companies, Senghor responded that it would be to \\"kill the goose that laid the golden egg\\". His government invested heavily in both education and the public sector, investing 12-15 billion francs and 6 to 9 billion francs in both sectors respectively. He also sought to give more power to the underdeveloped Senegalese countryside which he did by instituting price protections on peanut crops and allowing for rural representation when making decisions on agricultural policy.

Founded in the early 1960s, its leader was Kamisese Mara, the founding father of the modern Fijian nation. Widely seen as the political vehicle of the traditional Fijian chiefs, the Alliance Party also commanded considerable support among the Europeans and other ethnic minorities, who, although comprising only 3‚Äì4% of Fiji's population, were over represented in the parliament (with a third of the seats before 1973, and a sixth thereafter, allocated to them). Indo-Fijians were less supportive, but the Fijian-European block vote kept the Alliance Party in power for more than twenty years. Formation of the Alliance Party The formation of the Alliance Party was the direct result of the call, in November 1965, by the Governor, Sir Derek Jakeway, \\"for leaders of imagination, who have the interests of all the people of Fiji truly at heart, to build political alliances with the object of contesting elections on a common racial platform and then, if they win a majority of seats, forming a broad based administration which will be effectively self-governing\\". In 1965, there already existed in Fiji political organisations which represented various interest groups (but no other political party like the Federation Party). These were the Fijian Association, which was formed in 1956 to \\"counter the Indian demand for political reform\\", the National Congress of Fiji formed by Indians opposed to the Federation Party, the General Electors Association representing the Europeans and Part- Europeans, the Suva Rotuman Association, the Rotuman Convention, the Chinese Association, the All-Fiji Muslim Political Front, the Fiji Minority Party and the Tongan Organization. On 12 March 1966, all these organisations came together under the leadership of Kamisese Mara to form the Alliance Party.New political party aims for racial unity in Fiji Pacific Islands Monthly, April 1966, p13 1966 general election When the 1966 general election was held, the Alliance Party had been in existence for only six months, consequently there was little co-ordination of activities between its affiliated organisations. Candidate selection was not streamlined and in four Fijian communal constituencies, the Fijian Association allowed its own members to stand against the Alliance endorsed candidates. Some candidates for the Indian communal constituencies stood in the election under the National Congress of Fiji banner. Sometimes individual ambition superseded party loyalty as seen by the case where a European member, on failing to obtain Alliance endorsement, resigned, stood as an independent, won the election, re-joined the Alliance and was made a Minister. In the end, the Alliance, won a landslide victory, taking 22 of the 34 directly elected seats. Its greatest achievement was winning the three cross-voting seats in the western division, where the large Indian majority was expected to elect Federation Party candidates. After the election the three independents and two nominees of the Great Council of Chiefs, also joined the Alliance to give it a total of 27 seats. The remaining 9 seats were won by the NFP, led by A. D. Patel. Owing to the victory of the Alliance, Ratu Mara was appointed Chief Minister when responsible government was introduced in September 1967. 1977 to 1987 The rule of the Alliance Party was briefly challenged in the election of March 1977, when a split in the ethnic Fijian vote resulted in the loss of nine seats. The Alliance ended up with 24 seats in the 52-seat parliament, two less than the Indo-Fijian- dominated National Federation Party (NFP). A constitutional crisis developed when, three days after the election, the NFP splintered in a leadership brawl, and the Governor General of Fiji, Ratu Sir George Cakobau, asked the Mara government to remain in power in a caretaker capacity. A second election was held in September that year to resolve the impasse; the Alliance was returned with an unprecedented 36 seats out of 52. The majority of the Alliance Party was reduced in the 1982 election, but with 28 seats out of 52, it retained office. In April 1987, the party was finally beaten by a multi-racial coalition led by Timoci Bavadra, an ethnic Fijian who nevertheless drew most of his support from the Indo-Fijian population. After less than a month in office, the new government was deposed in a military coup led by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka. After several months of turmoil, the former Prime Minister Ratu Mara, the Alliance Party leader, was called back to head a transitional government. As part of a major realignment of Fijian politics, however, the Alliance Party was dissolved. Attempts to revive the Alliance More than fifteen years after the disbanding of the Fijian Alliance, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs from 2001 to 2004, and a son-in-law of the late Ratu Mara, formally registered the National Alliance Party of Fiji on 18 January 2005 as a claimed successor to the defunct party. Ganilau launched the new party at a mass rally in Suva on 8 April 2005. The Fijian Alliance was considered to be a centre-right party, and was a member of the International Democrat Union, an umbrella-organization of moderate right- wing parties from many countries, including the Republican Party of the United States, the British Conservative Party, and the Australian Liberal Party.

He also served as the 21st Lieutenant Governor (and the first since statehood). He was also Chief Justice of the Superior Court, during the American Revolution (1769‚Äì1784). Early life Matthew Griswold was born in Lyme, Connecticut, the eldest son of John Griswold, politician and landowner, and Hannah (Lee) Griswold. He was the fourth generation of his family to live in Connecticut; the Griswold family had emigrated there from England in 1639. Through his mother, he is connected to the DeWolf family. The Griswolds were one of the wealthiest and most respected families in Lyme; several Griswolds served in public office in Connecticut over the generations. In his mid-20s, he decided to study law. He was admitted to the New London Bar in 1742 and opened a practice in Lyme. Many of his legal cases involved settling estates and collecting debts. He became a well-liked and respected teacher of the law as well and over the years developed the one of the first and finest collections of law books in Connecticut. He married then Deputy Governor Roger Wolcott's daughter Ursula on November 10, 1743, and had seven children with her. Their son, Roger Griswold, later also became governor of Connecticut. Career His reputation as a fair and hard-working lawyer won Griswold the appointment of king's attorney for New London County. The king's attorney represented the interests of England and her colonies in court. That Griswold held this position for over 30 years stands as a testimony to both his ability as a lawyer and his fair-mindedness. Griswold's busy law practice left much of the management of Black Hall to Ursula. Griswold was elected to the Connecticut General Assembly in 1748, and from 1751 to 1759. He was then elected to the Council of Assistants, serving from 1759 to 1769. Griswold and eight other councilmembers demonstrated opposition to the Stamp Act of 1765 when Governor Thomas Fitch was required to take an oath to support it. Griswold became a member of the Sons of Liberty, who publicly protested the Stamp Act. In each of the years from 1769 to 1784, he was elected Deputy Governor of Connecticut. In that position, he also served as Chief Justice of the Superior Court. During this time, he was concerned about education, and was a member of a committee to improved teaching at Yale College. Yale awarded him a Doctor of Laws in 1779 in appreciation. American Revolution Griswold was a strong supporter of the colonists' cause during the American Revolution. He served on many committees that oversaw troop movements, military appointments, provisions, and defense; he especially focused on defending American ships and the Connecticut shoreline. According to family legend, Griswold twice evaded British soldiers as they searched for him, an important target, in his own home. Governorship and later years After the end of the war, Griswold was chosen to be Governor in 1784 by the General Assembly, after he failed to receive a majority of votes in the regular election. He was re-elected in 1785, but then lost to Samuel Huntington in 1786. In 1788, as delegate from Lyme, he became president of Connecticut's convention to ratify the new United States Constitution. Later in 1788, Ursula Griswold died, and Matthew Griswold retired from public life. Death Griswold continued to manage his family estate, Black Hall, until his death on April 28, 1799.

It is long and is the most widespread species in the family Artamidae. Woodswallows have a soft call with chiff, chap and chattering calls which can include vocal mimicry Increased vegetation due to inappropriate fire regimes has caused the woodswallows numbers to decline since 1993 in Cape York Peninsula. Description SW Queensland, Australia The black-faced woodswallow is in length, and weighs . It has a blue-grey beak with a black tip and a black face mask which extends from the base of the bill up to and around the eyes. It has ash grey plumage, which is lighter around the breast with darker wings, and silver underwings. The tail is black with a white tip. There are four different subspecies of back faced wood swallows. These are differentiated by black or white colouration of their tail vents. The white- vented subspecies A.c. normani and A.c.dealbatus are found on the Cape York Peninsula and northern Queensland respectively. The black-vented A.c. cinereus occurs in south west Australia, while A.c.melanops occurs in northern Australia and Lesser Sunda Islands, including Timor. The sexes are similar in colouration. Juvenile woodswallows have a brown body and wing coloration with buff streaks and a pale yellow beak. The voice is soft with chiff, chap and chattering animated calls which can include vocal mimicry. Distribution and habitat This species is broadly distributed in Australia, occupying most of the continent except for the eastern margin. It is mainly sedentary, remaining in arid and semi-arid areas even during dry conditions. Although it can be partly nomadic, the woodswallow prefers open eucalypt woodlands, scrub, and spinifex in arid and semi-arid conditions. In tropical savannah, it prefers open woodlands and grasslands. Woodswallows frequently flock with finches and at times the golden-shouldered parrot. Ecology=Feeding They are mainly insectivorous. Woodswallows are aerial feeders that can soar, hover and dive to catch insect prey which include moths and are also often feed on the ground taking ground insects, or insects caught on the wing to be dismembered. Woodswallows have brush- like tongues for gleaning nectar and will occasionally feed on flowers. Behaviour They are communal breeders, with documented feeding of young by numerous birds, probably as an adaptation to an erratic climate in arid and semi-arid conditions. Woodswallows also exhibit a tendency to flock and cluster roost, during the day and night. Clustering assists with thermoregulation, wind protection, social drive and reduces predation risk. Breeding generally follows periods of rain with abundant insects, generally, they breed once a year between August and September. The sexes are similar in appearance and courtship displays consist of rotating tails and wing waving. The male and female perch a metre apart, then spread their wings while fanning and rotating the tail. Nests are built in tree hollows, crevices, forks of branches or on top of stumps. The same areas are occupied each year. Nest building takes 4‚Äì7 weeks to complete and is composed of twigs, coarse grass and lined with softer grass. The eggs are oval in shape and range from 17-22mm in size. The woodswallows eggs come in a clutch size of 3-4 eggs. , white to dull white in colouration with blotched markings which are red-brown and lavender speckling. Incubation takes 14‚Äì16 days, and chicks fledge 18 days later. The fledglings are at risk from predators such as hawks, butcher birds and kookaburras, but are kept away by alarm calls and attacking behaviour of the parents. Other birds e.g. parrots often feed close to woodswallows thereby reducing their own predation risk. As they are communal breeders, helpers can be seen feeding the young and defending against predators. Subspecies There are 4 different subspecies of black-faced woodswallow. The Great Dividing Range, the Gregory Range and the eastern edge of the Carpentarian grasslands separates the range of the two species. To the east of the range are the subspecies with white vents, while to the west are the black vented subspecies. There have been reported hybrid populations, along territory borders with hybrid zones, where genetic exchange, detected phenotypically using the hybrid index score, has occurred. Of note, the black- vented woodswallows are more adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, while the white-vented are adapted to tropical conditions. Therefore, selection pressure will probably not result in subspecies merging. The role of possible isolation of an ancestral subpopulation with subsequent expansion after glacial factors during the Pleistocene and environmental factors in generating the different plumage patterns has been considered. Molecular phylogeography using mitochondrial DNA in woodswallows was not helpful in determining biogeographical factors. Mt DNA studies revealed random intermixing. There are no current studies using nuclear DNA. This confirms that multiple criteria such as plumage, song, and mtDNA, nDNA and interbreeding determine species and subspecies. Association with other bird species On the Cape York Peninsula, the black-faced woodswallows associate with golden-shouldered parrots and finches, which has important consequences for the endangered parrots. The woodswallow nesting sites occur closer to more open areas, on gravel slopes and glimmer grass flats. The adults frequently feed on insects on the ground, but are also efficient at defending their territory against predators, which is also beneficial for parrots feeding nearby. However, woodswallows numbers have declined since 1993 in Cape York Peninsula. This loss has been attributed to vegetation thickening as a result of inappropriate fire regimes, which has contributed to increased predation of the golden- shouldered parrot. Fire management Although the current conservation status of black-faced woodswallow is least concern, there have been significant regional declines, particularly on the Cape York Peninsula. These losses are thought to be due to vegetation thickening. However, a recent change in fire management, specifically storm-burning, has resulted in a cessation of woodswallow decline. Storm-burning has produced a more open vegetation structure, which is beneficial for insect feeding and nesting by the woodswallows.

Spade also appeared in four lesser-known short stories by Hammett. The Maltese Falcon, first published as a serial in the pulp magazine Black Mask, is the only full-length novel in which Spade appears. The character, however, is widely cited as a crystallizing figure in the development of hard-boiled private detective fiction‚ÄîRaymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe, for instance, was strongly influenced by Spade. Spade was a departure from Hammett's nameless and less-than-glamorous detective, The Continental Op. Spade combined several features of previous detectives, most notably his detached demeanor, keen eye for detail, and unflinching determination to achieve his own justice.  Portrayals  Spade was a new character created specifically by Hammett for The Maltese Falcon; he had not appeared in any of Hammett's previous stories. Hammett says about him: > Spade has no original. He is a dream man in the sense that he is what most > of the private detectives I worked with would like to have been and in their > cockier moments thought they approached. For your private detective does > not‚Äîor did not ten years ago when he was my colleague‚Äîwant to be an erudite > solver of riddles in the Sherlock Holmes manner; he wants to be a hard and > shifty fellow, able to take care of himself in any situation, able to get > the best of anybody he comes in contact with, whether criminal, innocent by- > stander or client.Introduction to The Maltese Falcon (1934 edition) From the 1940s onward, the character became closely associated with actor Humphrey Bogart, who played Spade in the third and best-known film version of The Maltese Falcon. Though Bogart's slight frame, dark features and no- nonsense depiction contrasted with Hammett's vision of Spade (blond, well- built and mischievous), his sardonic portrayal was well-received, and is generally regarded as an influence on both film noir and the genre's archetypal private detective. Spade was played by Ricardo Cortez in the first film version in 1931. Despite being a critical and commercial success, an attempt to re-release the film in 1936 was denied approval by the Production Code Office due to the film's lewd content. Since Warner Bros. could not re- release the film, a second version was made. For the comedy Satan Met a Lady (1936), the central character was renamed Ted Shane and was played by Warren William. The film was a box-office failure. On the radio, Spade was played by Edward G. Robinson in a 1943 Lux Radio Theatre production, and by Bogart in both a 1943 Screen Guild Theater production and a 1946 Academy Award Theater production. A 1946-1951 radio show called The Adventures of Sam Spade (on ABC, CBS, and NBC) starred Howard Duff (and later Steve Dunne) as Sam Spade and Lurene Tuttle as Spade's devoted secretary Effie Perrine, and took a considerably more tongue-in-cheek approach to the character. George Segal played Sam Spade, Jr., son of the original, in the film spoof, The Black Bird (1975). The Black Bird was panned by critics. Peter Falk delivered a more successful spoof the following year as Sam Diamond in Neil Simon's Murder by Death. This was preceded by the spoof character Sam Diamond in The Addams Family episode \\"Thing Is Missing\\" (1965) portrayed by Tommy Farrell. In 2009, with the approval of the estate of Dashiell Hammett, the veteran detective- story writer Joe Gores published Spade & Archer: The Prequel to Dashiell Hammett's THE MALTESE FALCON with Alfred A. Knopf, the original publisher of Hammett's The Maltese Falcon.

There are varieties of lemonade found throughout the world. In North America and South Asia, cloudy lemonade dominates. It is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a sweetener such as cane sugar, simple syrup or honey. In the United Kingdom and Australia, clear lemonade, a carbonated drink, is preferred. Despite the differences between the drinks, each is known simply as \\"lemonade\\" in countries where it is dominant. The suffix \\"-ade\\" may also be applied to other similar drinks made with different fruits, such as limeade, orangeade, or cherryade.  History  British Formula One motor racing driver Jackie Stewart drinking carbonated lemonade in 1969 Children operating a lemonade stand in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, California, 1960 A drink made with lemons, dates, and honey was consumed in 13th and 14th century Egypt, including a lemon juice drink with sugar, known as qatarmizat. In 1676, a company known as Compagnie de Limonadiers sold lemonade in Paris. While carbonated water was invented by Joseph Priestley in 1767, the first reference found to carbonated lemonade was in 1833 when the drink was sold in British refreshment stalls. R. White's Lemonade has been sold in the UK since 1845.  Varieties = Cloudy lemonade  The predominant form of lemonade found in the US, Canada, and India, cloudy lemonade, also known as traditional or old fashioned lemonade in the UK and Australia, is typically non-carbonated and made with fresh lemon juice; however commercially produced varieties are also available. Generally served cold, cloudy lemonade may also be served hot as a remedy for congestion and sore throats, frozen, or used as a mixer. Traditionally, children in US and Canadian neighborhoods start lemonade stands to make money during the summer months. The concept has become iconic of youthful summertime Americana to the degree that parodies and variations on the concept exist across media. References can be found in comics and cartoons such as Peanuts, and the 1979 computer game Lemonade Stand. = Pink lemonade = A popular variation of cloudy lemonade, pink lemonade, is created by adding additional fruit juices, flavors, or food coloring to the recipe. Most store-bought pink lemonade is simply colored with concentrated grape juice or dyes. A 1912 obituary, credited the invention of pink lemonade to circus worker Henry E. \\"Sanchez\\" Allott, saying he had dropped in red cinnamon candies by mistake. An earlier origin story credits another circus worker, Pete Conklin, in 1857. His brother, George Conklin tells the story in his 1921 memoir. According to the story, Conklin's lemonade was a mixture of water, sugar, tartaric acid, with the tub garnished with a single lemon that he repeatedly used for the season. One day, he ran out of water. Searching desperately, he found a tub of water a bareback rider had recently used to rinse her pink tights. Adding in the sugar, acid and remaining bits of lemon, he offered the resulting mixture as \\"strawberry lemonade\\", he saw his sales double.Nickell, Joe.

Schweppes uses a blend of lemon and lime oils.Product description Other fizzy drinks (or pop) which are both lemon and lime flavoured may also sometimes be referred to as lemonade, such as Sprite and 7 up. There are also speciality flavours, such as Fentimans Rose Lemonade, which is sold in the UK, the US, and Canada. Shandy, a mixture of beer and clear lemonade, is often sold pre-bottled, or ordered in pubs.  Brown lemonade  There are various drinks called brown lemonade. In Northern Ireland, brown lemonade is flavoured with brown sugar. A variant from Venezuela has cane sugar and lime.  Other varieties  In India and Pakistan, where it is commonly known as nimbu paani, and in Bangladesh, lemonades may also contain salt and/or ginger juice. Shikanjvi is a traditional lemonade from this region, and can also be flavored with saffron, cumin and other spices.Jiggs Kalra, Pushpesh Pant, Classic cooking of Punjab, Allied Publishers, 2004, Julie Sahni, Indian regional classics: fast, fresh, and healthy home cooking, Ten Speed Press, 2001, , 9781580083454, \\"...

Limonana, a type of lemonade made from freshly squeezed lemon juice and mint leaves, is a widely popular summer drink in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Limonana was created in the early 1990s in Israel after an advertising agency promoted the then-fictitious product to prove the efficacy of advertising on public buses. The campaign generated so much consumer demand that restaurateurs and manufacturers began really producing the drink, which would become very popular. In Northern Africa, a drink called cherbat is made of lemon, mint, and rose water. Switcha is a version of the drink made in the Bahamas and Turks & Caicos that can also be made with limes instead of lemons. = Citron press√© = The French soft drink citron press√©, being diluted with water In France, it is common for restaurants to offer citron press√©, an unmixed version of lemonade in which the customer is given lemon juice, syrup and water separately to be mixed in their preferred proportions.  Health effects  The high concentration of citric acid in lemon juice is the basis for popular culture recommendations of consumption of lemonade to prevent calcium-based kidney stones. Studies have not demonstrated that lemonade causes a sustained improvement of urine pH, increased citric acid concentration in urine, reduction in supersaturation by stone-forming salts, or prevention of recurrent stones.

It occurs from Canada to southernmost South America, and is thus the most widely distributed bird in the Americas. It occurs in most suburban areas in its range and it is the single most common wren. Its taxonomy is highly complex and some subspecies groups are often considered separate species.

The subspecies vary greatly, with upperparts ranging from dull greyish-brown to rich rufescent-brown, and the underparts ranging from brown, over buff and pale grey, to pure white. All subspecies have blackish barring to the wings and tail, and some also to the flanks. All subspecies show a faint eye-ring and eyebrow and have a long, thin bill with a blackish upper mandible, and a black-tipped yellowish or pale grey lower mandible. The legs are pinkish or grey. The short tail is typically held cocked.Peterson, Roger Tory (1947). A Field Guide to the Birds: Eastern Land and Water Birds, Houghton Mifflin Co., Boston, p. 121. This bird's rich bubbly song is commonly heard during the nesting season but rarely afterwards. There is marked geographical variation in the song, though somewhat more gradual than in the bird's outward appearance that can strikingly differ, e.g., on neighboring islands in the Caribbean. Birds from far north and south of the species' range nonetheless have songs that differ markedly.

Ecology In North America, the house wren is thought to achieve the highest density in floodplain forests in the western great plains where it uses woodpecker holes as nesting sites. In South and Central America it can be found in virtually any habitat and is, as indicated by its common name, often associated with humans. North American birds migrate to the southern United States and Mexico for winter. Most return to the breeding grounds in late April to May, and leave for winter quarters again around September to early October. These birds forage actively in vegetation. They mainly eat insects such as butterfly larvae, also spiders and snails. Southern house wrens rarely attend mixed-species feeding flocks. Reproduction Audubon's illustration of nesting house wrens The nesting habits do not seem to differ significantly between the northern and southern house wrens at least. They usually construct a large cup nest in various sorts of cavities, taking about a week to build. The nest is made from small dry sticks and is usually lined with a variety of different materials. These include: feather, hair, wool, spider cocoons, strips of bark, rootlets, moss, and trash. The male wren finds dry sticks, which he adds to the nest. Once he is done, the female inspects at the nest; but if she does not approve of the construction, she will throw any unwanted sticks to the ground. After this process, the female lines the nest. Nest cavities are usually a few meters above ground at most, but occasionally on cliffs as high up as and more at least in southern populations; they may be natural or man-made, often using bird houses. House wrens are feisty and pugnacious animals considering their tiny size. They are known to occasionally destroy the eggs of other birds nesting in their territory by puncturing the eggshell. Females that sang more songs to conspecifics that were simulated by playback lost fewer eggs to ovicide by other wrens. Female bird song in this species is therefore thought to have a function in competition and is not only displayed by males. They are also known to fill up other birds' nests within its territory with sticks to make them unusable. Adult bringing food for young (note begging calls) Depending on the exact population, the house wrens' clutch is usually between two and eight red-blotched cream-white eggs, weighing about each and measuring c. at the widest points. Only the female incubates these, for around 12‚Äì19 days, and she will every now and then leave the nest for various reasons. While she is on the nest, the male provisions her with food. The young, which like all passerines hatch almost naked and helpless, take another 15‚Äì19 days or so to fledge. They are being fed by both parents, and need plenty of food given their tiny size (see also Bergmann's Rule). As the young near fledging, the parents spend much of their time procuring food for them. Brood loss due to predation was found to be light in the Southern Andean Yungas, with predation of nestling young being almost insignificant. Known predators of house wrens at the nest include cats, rats, opossums, woodpeckers, foxes, raccoons, squirrels, snakes and owls. Adults away from the nests can usually avoid these predators although both small hawks and owls occasionally take free-flying adult wrens.Brown, J. (2001). Troglodytes aedon, Animal Diversity Web. Accessed March 18, 2013. Migrant populations are nesting within 6 weeks of returning from winter quarters, leaving theoretically time for a second brood. In the subtropical montane forest of northwestern Argentina and similar habitat, the southern house wren breeds in the rainy summer months from late October to late December. In Washington, D.C. area, house wren parents made significantly more feeding trips per hour in suburban backyards compared to rural backyards. Yet rural nestlings grew at a faster rate than their suburban counterparts. In addition, suburban parents spent less time brooding (sitting on the nest) compared to rural parents. Such results suggest that suburban backyard habitats offer house wrens food for nestlings that is inferior in either quality or quantity to what rural habitats offer. Food items may, for example, be smaller in suburban habitats, and force adults to make more trips to the box. In South Temperate Argentina, southern house wrens dispersed more frequently between- seasons than within a season, with females dispersing more often than males. Widowed and single males dispersed more frequently than paired males, whilst within-season divorce increased the breeding success of females but not males. Conservation status Turnaround video of a Martinique house wren specimen, Naturalis Biodiversity Center The house wren may have been displaced somewhat in some northern parts of its range by the introduction of the house sparrow, but is still common and widespread throughout most of the Americas. It is not considered threatened by the IUCN, though this would certainly not hold true for several of the island population if they turn out to be true species. Some taxa, especially from the Lesser Antilles, are rare and highly endangered or possibly already extinct. Several factors seem to have contributed to a varying degree to the decline of these birds, namely habitat destruction, predation by introduced mongooses, and hurricanes: * Martinique house wren, Troglodytes aedon martinicensis) ‚Äì Martinique, apparently extinct (c.1890) * Guadeloupe house wren, Troglodytes aedon guadeloupensis ‚Äì Guadeloupe, possibly extinct (late 20th century?) * Saint Lucia house wren, Troglodytes aedon mesoleucus ‚Äì Saint Lucia, believed extinct by the 1970s, subsequently rediscovered but still precariously rare The Saint Vincent house wren (Troglodytes aedon musicus) of Saint Vincent was close to extinction in the mid-late 20th century; it has since recovered and today is not uncommon. As remarked above, these are variously placed in T. musculus if that is considered distinct, or as one or several distinct species. In culture John James Audubon illustrates the house wren in Birds of America (published, London 1827‚Äì38) as Plate 83. The image was engraved and colored by the Robert Havell, London workshops. The limited 1985 edition by Audubon is available for purchase at the New York History Society. Troglodytes Aedon was one of the two pets of King Friday the XIII in Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. Trog, as the King called him, was a wooden wren on a stick, and Trog had his own song. King Friday's other pet was a mockingbird (a wooden mockingbird on a stick) named Mimus Polyglottos (see Neighborhood of Make-Believe). Brazilian footballer Garrincha earned his nickname from one of the names the house wren has in Rio de Janeiro. ReferencesFurther reading * ffrench, Richard; O'Neill, John Patton & Eckelberry, Don R.

It was historically a north-west projection of Berkshire. The area is commonly referred to as the 'Vale of the White Horse' and is crossed by the Ridgeway National Trail in its far south, across the North Wessex Downs AONB at the junction of four counties. The northern boundary is defined by the River Thames. The name refers to Uffington White Horse, a prehistoric hill figure. History The area has been long settled as a productive fertile chalklands above well-drained clay valleys and well-farmed with many small woodlands and hills between the Berkshire Downs and the River Thames on its north and east sides. It is named after the prominent and large Bronze Age- founded Uffington White Horse hill figure. The district had essentially been the majority of Wantage Rural District and three small towns in the county of Berkshire from their late 19th century inception as districts until local government re-organisation in 1974 when its parishes of Ardington, Blewbury, Childrey, Chilton, Denchworth, East Challow, East Hanney, East Hendred, Goosey, Grove, Harwell, Letcombe Bassett, Letcombe Regis, Lockinge, Sparsholt, Upton, West Challow, West Hanney and West Hendred became the new district in Oxfordshire. The rest became part of Newbury (later West Berkshire)'s district of the rump county. The towns (and predecessor urban districts) are, in size order, Abingdon, Faringdon and Wantage. There are 68 parishes in the district. The district was formed on 1 April 1974 from: the Municipal Borough of Abingdon, Wantage Urban District, Abingdon Rural District, Faringdon Rural District and part of the Wantage Rural District of Berkshire. Politics The Vale of White Horse District Council is based in Milton Park, Milton. The council has been controlled by either Liberal Democrat or Conservative administrations since Vale of White Horse was created in 1973. The council was run by the Conservative Party from 2011 until the 2019 UK local elections, at which the Liberal Democrats regained control in a landslide, after having previously held the council from 1995 to 2011. Geography The Vale is the valley of the Ock, a stream which joins the Thames from the west at Abingdon. It is almost flat and well wooded, its green meadows and foliage contrasting richly with the bald summits of the Berkshire Downs, which flank it on the south. The numerous elm trees that once were a major feature of the Vale were lost to Dutch Elm Disease. To the north, a low ridge separates it from the upper Thames Valley, holding back the soft Jurassic sedimentary deposits (Greensand, Gault and Kimmeridge Clay) behind a hard corallian limestone escarpment ridge, in what is technically a hanging valley; but local usage sometimes extends the vale to cover all the ground between the Cotswolds (on the north) and the Berkshire Downs. According to the geographical definition, however, the Vale is from two to five miles wide, and the distance by road from Abingdon to Shrivenham at its head is 18 miles. Wantage is the only town in the foot or slopes of the vale (Faringdon, on the northwestern rim, is closely associated). Wantage is in a sheltered hollow at the foot of the hills, along which villages concentrate often in long strip parishes. Numerous springs, the run-off from the chalk hills were main local water sources, and an accessible water table enabled the growing of fruits, grains and vegetables. Sites of interest Towards the west, above Uffington, the hills reach a culminating point of 261 m (856 ft) in White Horse Hill. In its northern flank, just below the summit, a gigantic figure of a horse is cut, the turf being removed to show the white chalky soil beneath. This figure gives name to the hill, the range and the Vale. It is 114 m (374 ft) long and highly stylised, the neck, body and tail varying little in width. A panoramic view into the Vale; the White Horse is on the right and Dragon Hill centre right The origin of the figure is unknown. Tradition asserted it to be the monument of a victory over the Danes by King Alfred, who was born at Wantage, but the site of the Battle of Ashdown (871 CE), has been variously located. Moreover, the figure has been dated to the Bronze Age, so it pre-dates the battle by many centuries. Many ancient remains occur in the vicinity of the Horse. Vale scene, with White Horse Hill on the horizon On the summit of the hill there is an extensive and well-preserved circular camp, apparently used by the Romans but of much earlier origin. It is an Iron Age hill fort named Uffington Castle, after the village in the vale below. Within a short distance are Hardwell Castle, a near-square work and, on the southern slope of the hills near Ashdown House, a small camp traditionally called Alfred's Castle. Further to the West, there is Liddington Castle. The Uffington White Horse, as seen from an altitude of about 600 m (2000 ft), from the cockpit of a glider A smooth, steep gully on the north flank of White Horse Hill is called the Manger, and to the west of it rises a bald mound named Dragon Hill, the traditional scene of St George's victory over the dragon, the blood of which made the ground bare of grass for ever. But the name may derive from Celtic Pendragon (\\"dragon's head\\"), which was a title for a king, and may point to an early place of burial. To the west of White Horse Hill lies a long barrow called Wayland's Smithy, said to be the home of a smith who was never seen, but who shod the horses of travellers if they were left at the place with payment. The legend is elaborated, and the smith appears as a character, in Sir Walter Scott's novel Kenilworth, and in Rudyard Kipling's Puck of Pook's Hill. The Vale as a whole appears at the beginning of Tom Brown's Schooldays, as the scene of innocent Saxon boyhood adventures, before the eponymous hero is sent away to school at Rugby. Rosemary Sutcliff's 1977 historical novel Sun Horse, Moon Horse takes place in the Vale, telling the tale of the White Horse's creation in ancient Celtic times. The White Horse has been carefully cleared of vegetation from time to time. The figure has remained clear of turf throughout its long existence, except for being covered as a precaution during the Second World War. The cleaning process, known as the Scouring of the White Horse, was formerly made the occasion of a festival. Sports of all kinds were held, and keen rivalry was maintained, not only between the inhabitants of the local villages, but between local champions and those from distant parts of England. The first of such festivals known took place in 1755 and they died out only subsequently to 1857. The Ridgeway A grassy track represents the Ridgeway, claimed as the oldest road in Europe, perhaps five thousand years old or more. It travels along the crest of the hills, far above what would then have been marshy lowlands or forests, continuing Icknield Street, from the Chilterns to Goring and Streatley on the River Thames. It links The Wash and Salisbury Plain, and would have been an important artery for trade. Other earthworks, in addition to those near the White Horse, overlook the Vale, such as Letcombe Castle (also known as Segsbury Camp) above Wantage. At the foot of the hills, not far east of the Horse, is preserved the so-called Blowing Stone of Kingston Lisle, a mass of sandstone (a sarsen) pierced with holes in such a way that, when blown like a trumpet, it produces a loud note. It is believed that, in earlier times, the stone served the purpose of a bugle. Several of the village churches in the Vale are of interest, notably the fine Early English cruciform building at Uffington, that has an octagonal tower and is known as The Cathedral of the Vale. Economy Farmland and White Horse Hill Farming is mostly arable. In livestock the range is mixed. The area had a large dairy industry, especially in the 1960s, but it was much reduced by the 21st century, with the large fertile fields supported by subsidies. The Lockinge Estate is a longstanding agricultural employer within the region. Natural mineral resources are mined (quarried) in the Vale. These include sand, gravel and (formerly) Fuller's Earth. With the closure of British Leyland's long-established MG works at Abingdon in 1980, there is no motor industry, apart from some specialist car makers and component factories. Macdermid Autotype in Wantage remains one of the few large industrial employers in the region. The length of the Vale is traversed by the Great Western Main Line and the Cherwell Valley Line. Appleford railway station and Radley railway station are now the only stations within the Vale, although there used to be stations at Challow, Uffington, Grove (near Wantage), Abingdon and Steventon. These all closed as part of the Beeching cuts, in the early 1960s. The nearest mainline stations are now Swindon, Oxford and Didcot Parkway. The Harwell Science and Innovation Campus is a large employer, particularly for scientists and engineers. At one time Amey plc had its head office in Sutton Courtenay, Vale of White Horse.

W. Edwards Deming said of him: > As a statistician, he was, like so many of the rest of us, self-taught, on a > good background of physics and mathematics. Born in New Canton, Illinois to Anton and Esta Barney Shewhart, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign before being awarded his doctorate in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1917. He married Edna Elizabeth Hart, daughter of William Nathaniel and Isabelle \\"Ibie\\" Lippencott Hart on August 4, 1914 in Pike County, Illinois. Work on industrial quality Bell Telephone‚Äôs engineers had been working to improve the reliability of their transmission systems. In order to impress government regulators of this natural monopoly with the high quality of their service, Shewhart's first assignment was to improve the voice clarity of the carbon transmitters in the company's telephone handsets. Later he applied his statistical methods to the final installation of central station switching systems, then to factory production. When Shewhart joined the Western Electric Company Inspection Engineering Department at the Hawthorne Works in 1918, industrial quality was limited to inspecting finished products and removing defective items. That all changed on May 16, 1924. Shewhart's boss, George D. Edwards, recalled: \\"Dr. Shewhart prepared a little memorandum only about a page in length. About a third of that page was given over to a simple diagram which we would all recognize today as a schematic control chart. That diagram, and the short text which preceded and followed it, set forth all of the essential principles and considerations which are involved in what we know today as process quality control.\\" Shewhart's work pointed out the importance of reducing variation in a manufacturing process and the understanding that continual process-adjustment in reaction to non-conformance actually increased variation and degraded quality. Shewhart framed the problem in terms of assignable-cause and chance-cause variation and introduced the control chart as a tool for distinguishing between the two. Shewhart stressed that bringing a production process into a state of statistical control, where there is only chance-cause variation, and keeping it in control, is necessary to predict future output and to manage a process economically. Dr. Shewhart created the basis for the control chart and the concept of a state of statistical control by carefully designed experiments. While Dr. Shewhart drew from pure mathematical statistical theories, he understood data from physical processes never produce a \\"normal distribution curve\\" (a Gaussian distribution, also commonly called a \\"bell curve\\"). He discovered that observed variation in manufacturing data did not always behave the same way as data in nature (Brownian motion of particles). Dr. Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display controlled variation that is natural to the process, while others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the process causal system at all times. Shewhart worked to advance the thinking at Bell Telephone Laboratories from their foundation in 1925 until his retirement in 1956, publishing a series of papers in the Bell System Technical Journal. His work was summarized in his book Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product (1931). Shewhart‚Äôs charts were adopted by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in 1933 and advocated to improve production during World War II in American War Standards Z1.1-1941, Z1.2-1941 and Z1.3-1942. Later work From the late 1930s onwards, Shewhart's interests expanded out from industrial quality to wider concerns in science and statistical inference. The title of his second book, Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control (1939), asks the question: \\"What can statistical practice, and science in general, learn from the experience of industrial quality control?\\" Shewhart's approach to statistics was radically different from that of many of his contemporaries. He possessed a strong operationalist outlook, largely absorbed from the writings of pragmatist philosopher Clarence Irving Lewis, and this influenced his statistical practice. In particular, he had read Lewis' Mind and the World Order many times. Though he lectured in England in 1932 under the sponsorship of Karl Pearson (another committed operationalist) his ideas attracted little enthusiasm within the English statistical tradition. The British Standards nominally based on his work, in fact, diverge on serious philosophical and methodological issues from his practice. His more conventional work led him to formulate the statistical idea of tolerance intervals and to propose his data presentation rules, which are listed below: # Data have no meaning apart from their context. # Data contain both signal and noise. To be able to extract information, one must separate the signal from the noise within the data. Walter Shewhart visited India in 1947‚Äì1948 under the sponsorship of P. C. Mahalanobis of the Indian Statistical Institute. He toured the country, held conferences and stimulated interest in statistical quality control among Indian industrialists.\\"A Brief History of the Indian Statistical Institute\\" He died at Troy Hills, New Jersey in 1967. Influence In 1938 his work came to the attention of physicists W. Edwards Deming and Raymond T. Birge. The two had been deeply intrigued by the issue of measurement error in science and had published a landmark paper in Reviews of Modern Physics in 1934. On reading of Shewhart's insights, they wrote to the journal to wholly recast their approach in the terms that Shewhart advocated. The encounter began a long collaboration between Shewhart and Deming that involved work on productivity during World War II and Deming's championing of Shewhart's ideas in Japan from 1950 onwards. Deming developed some of Shewhart's methodological proposals around scientific inference and named his synthesis the Shewhart cycle. To celebrate his quasquicentennial (125th) birth anniversary, the journal Quality Technology and Quantitative Management () published a special issue in on \\"Advances in the Theory and Application of Statistical Process Control\\".Min Xie & Amitava Mukherjee (2017) \\"Quasquicentennial of birth of Shewhart\\", Quality Technology and Quantitative Management 14(4) Achievements and honours In his obituary for the American Statistical Association, Deming wrote of Shewhart: > As a man, he was gentle, genteel, never ruffled, never off his dignity. He > knew disappointment and frustration, through failure of many writers in > mathematical statistics to understand his point of view. He was founding editor of the Wiley Series in Mathematical Statistics, a role that he maintained for twenty years, always championing freedom of speech and confident to publish views at variance with his own.

From 15 January 1876 the society published a journal in Afrikaans called Die Afrikaanse Patriot (\\"The Afrikaans Patriot\\") as well as a number of books, including grammars, dictionaries, religious material and histories. Die Afrikaanse Patriot was succeeded in 1905 by today's Paarl newspaper. Arnoldus Pannevis, a teacher, is generally considered to be the spiritual father of the society. He had observed that most of the South Africans from Dutch descent could not speak the \\"pure\\" form of their original mother tongue anymore. In the course of its (then) 200-year-old history, the language of the immigrants from the Netherlands had been thoroughly changed by the influence of other European immigrants, indigenous tribes such as the Khoikhoi, and especially the Cape Malays. In 1874 Pannevis expressed these views in the journal de Zuid-Afrikaan under the title \\"Is die Afferkaans wesenlijk een taal?\\" The eight founding members were Gideon Malherbe, the Dutch immigrant CP Hoogenhout, DF du ToitAF (nicknamed Dokter, i.e. \\"Doctor\\"), a journalist coincidentally named Daniel Francois du ToitAF (nicknamed Oom Lokomotief, i.e. \\"Uncle Locomotive\\"), his brother Rev SJ du Toit, August Ahrbeck, Petrus Malherbe and SG du Toit. Everybody except Hoogenhout and Ahrbeck were related. Many of these were of Huguenot descent. On 14 August 1975 the Afrikaans Language Museum was opened in the former house of Gideon Malherbe in Paarl, the building in which the Society was founded.

He is famous as a private tutor of aspiring undergraduate Cambridge mathematicians, earning him the sobriquet the \\"senior- wrangler maker.\\" He also made important contributions in asserting a solid, rather than fluid, interior for the Earth and explaining many geological phenomena in terms of his model. However, though his conclusions proved to be correct, his mathematical and physical reasoning were subsequently seen as unsound. Early life Hopkins was born at Kingston-on-Soar, in Nottinghamshire, the only son of William Hopkins, a gentleman farmer. In his youth he learned practical agriculture in Norfolk before his father rented him a small farm at Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. However, Hopkins was unsuccessful as a farmer and, when his first wife died sometime around 1821, he took the opportunity to mitigate his losses and enter St Peter's College (now Peterhouse) at the University of Cambridge, taking his degree of B.A. in 1827 as seventh wrangler and M.A. in 1830.. Wrangler maker Before graduation, Hopkins had married Caroline Frances Boys (1799‚Äì1881) and was, therefore, ineligible for a fellowship. He instead maintained himself as a private tutor, coaching the young mathematicians who sought the prestigious distinction of Senior Wrangler. He was enormously successful in the role, earning the sobriquet senior wrangler maker and grossing ¬£700‚Äì800 annually. By 1849, he had coached almost 200 wranglers, of whom 17 were senior wranglers including Arthur Cayley and G. G. Stokes. Among his more famous pupils were Lord Kelvin, James Clerk Maxwell and Isaac Todhunter. Francis Galton praised his teaching style: He also coached Edward Routh who went on to be Senior Wrangler and himself a prodigious \\"wrangler maker\\".. In 1833, Hopkins published Elements of Trigonometry and became distinguished for his mathematical knowledge. There was a famous story that the theory of George Green (1793‚Äì1841) was almost forgotten. In 1845, Lord Kelvin (William Thomson, a young man in 1845) got some copies of Green's 1828 short book from William Hopkins. Subsequently, Lord Kelvin helped to make Green's 1828 work famous according to the book \\"George Green\\" written by D.M. Cannell. Geology About 1833, through meeting Adam Sedgwick at Barmouth and joining him in several excursions, Hopkins became intensely interested in geology. From then on, in papers published by the Cambridge Philosophical Society and the Geological Society of London, he defined the discipline of physical geology, making mathematical investigations dealing with the effects that an elevatory force, acting from below, would produce on a portion of the Earth's crust, in fissures and faults. In this way he discussed the elevation and denudation of the Lake District, the Wealden area, and the Bas Boulonnais. Hopkins conceived of a largely solid but dynamic Earth threaded with cavities whereby hot vapours or fluids could create locally elevatory pressures. Such a model was at odds with the ideas of Charles Lyell whose theory was of a \\"steady state\\" with a largely liquid terrestrial interior, inside a solid crust no more than 100 miles thick. Hopkins presented a series of papers at the Royal Society between 1838 and 1842 analysing the Earth's rotation, including its precession and nutation, and using observations to support his theory, contending that they were inconsistent with a fluid interior. He also interpreted earthquakes and volcanoes through the same model in an 1847 British Association report. As part of his investigations, Hopkins sought to quantify the effects of enormous pressures on the melting point and thermal conductivity of various substances. With the support of a grant from the Royal Society, he invoked the assistance of Thomson, James Prescott Joule and William Fairbairn to make measurements which he interpreted as supporting his theory. He further asserted that the cooling of the Earth had had no real impact on climate. He read a paper to the Geological Society On the Causes which may have produced changes in the Earth's superficial Temperature (1851). In his second address as president of the Geological Society of London (1853) he criticised Elie de Beaumont's theory of the elevation of mountain-chains and the imperfect evidence on which he saw it as resting. Ultimately, it was Thomson who tactfully pointed out that, though Hopkins's conclusions about the Earth's structure were correct, his mathematical and physical reasoning was unsound. Glaciology Hopkins wrote also on the motion of glaciers and the transport of glacial erratics but trespassed on the sensitivities of J. D. Forbes who saw the subject as his personal fiefdom and was contemptuous of Hopkins's lack of observational experience in the subject. Private life Hopkins enjoyed music, poetry and landscape painting. He spent the end of his life in a lunatic asylum in Stoke Newington. He died there of chronic mania and exhaustion. He had, with his second wife, one son and three daughters, among them morality campaigner Ellice Hopkins. He played first-class cricket from 1825 to 1828. He was mainly associated with Cambridge University Cricket Club and made 4 known appearances in first-class matches.CricketArchive. Retrieved on 8 August 2009.

Lewis obituary, New York Times, February 4, 1964 Biography Lewis was born in Stoneham, Massachusetts. His father was a skilled worker in a shoe factory, and Lewis grew up in relatively humble circumstances. He discovered philosophy at age 13, when reading about the Greek pre-Socratics, Anaxagoras and Heraclitus in particular. The first work of philosophy Lewis recalled studying was A Short History of Greek Philosophy by John Marshall (1891). Immanuel Kant proved a major lifelong influence on Lewis's thinking. In his article \\"Logic and Pragmatism\\", Lewis wrote: \\"Nothing comparable in importance happened [in my life] until I became acquainted with Kant... Kant compelled me.

He then taught English for one year in a high school in Quincy, Massachusetts, then two years at the University of Colorado. In 1906, he married Mable Maxwell Graves. In 1908, Lewis returned to Harvard and began a Ph.D. in philosophy, which he completed in a mere two years. He then taught philosophy at the University of California, 1911‚Äì20, after which he returned again to Harvard, where he taught until his 1953 retirement, eventually filling the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy. His Harvard course on Kant's first Critique was among the most famous in undergraduate philosophy in the U.S. until he retired. Lewis's life was not free of trials. His daughter died in October 1932 and he suffered a heart attack in 1933. Nevertheless, the publications of Lewis (1929) and Lewis and Langford (1932) attest to these years having been a highly productive period of his life. During this same period, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1929, and in 1933, he presided over the American Philosophical Association.\\"Clarence Irving Lewis\\". Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Lewis accepted a visiting professorship at Stanford during 1957‚Äì58, where he presented his lectures for the last time. For the academic year 1959‚Äì60, he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies at Wesleyan University.wesleyan.edu Philosophical work=Logic Lewis studied logic under his eventual Ph.D. thesis supervisor, Josiah Royce, and is a principal architect of modern philosophical logic. In 1912, two years after the publication of the first volume of Principia Mathematica, Lewis began publishing articles taking exception to Principia' s pervasive use of material implication, more specifically, to Bertrand Russell's reading of a‚Üíb as \\"a implies b.\\" Lewis restated this criticism in his reviews of both editions of Principia Mathematica. Lewis's reputation as a promising young logician was soon assured. Material implication allows a true consequent to follow from a false antecedent. Lewis proposed to replace material implication with strict implication, such that a (contingently) false antecedent does not always strictly imply a (contingently) true consequent. This strict implication was not primitive, but defined in terms of negation, conjunction, and a prefixed unary intensional modal operator, \\\\Diamond. If X is a formula with a classical bivalent truth value, then \\\\DiamondX can be read as \\"X is possibly true\\". Lewis then defined \\"A strictly implies B\\" as \\" eg \\\\Diamond(A\\\\land egB)\\". Lewis's strict implication is now a historical curiosity, but the formal modal logic in which he grounded that notion is the ancestor of all modern work on the subject. Lewis' \\\\Diamond notation is still standard, but current practice usually takes its dual, \\\\square (\\"necessity\\"), as primitive and \\\\Diamond as defined, in which case \\"A strictly implies B\\" is simply written as \\\\square(A‚ÜíB). His first logic text, A Survey of Symbolic Logic (1918), went out of print after selling several hundred copies. At the time of its publication, it included the only discussion in English of the logical writings of Charles Sanders Peirce and only the second monograph, after Russell's of 1900, on Leibniz.Bertrand Russell, A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz (Cambridge: The University Press, 1900). While the modal logic of A Survey was soon proved inconsistent, Lewis went on to devise the modal systems S1 to S5, and to set these out in Symbolic Logic (1932) as possible formal analyses of the alethic modalities. Lewis mildly preferred S2 over the others; the amended modal system of A Survey was S3, but it is S4 and S5 that have generated sustained interest, mathematical as well as philosophical, down to the present day. S4 and S5 are the beginning of what is now called normal modal logic. On Lewis' strict implication and his modal systems S1-S5, see Hughes and Cresswell (1996: chapt. 11). Pragmatist but no positivist This section follows Dayton (2004) closely. Around 1930, American philosophy began to experience a turning point because of the arrival of logical empiricism, brought by European philosophers fleeing Nazi Germany. This new doctrine challenged American philosophers of a naturalistic or pragmatic bent, such as Lewis. In any event, logical empiricism, with its emphasis on scientific models of knowledge and on the logical analysis of meaning, soon emerged as a, and perhaps the, dominant tendency in American philosophy. While many saw Lewis as kin to the logical empiricists, he was never truly comfortable in such company because he declined to divorce experience from cognition. Positivism rejected value as lacking cognitive significance, also rejecting the analysis of experience in favor of physicalism. Both rejections struck him as regrettable. Indeed, his growing awareness of the pragmatic tradition led him in the opposite direction. For Lewis, it is only within experience that anything can have significance for anything, and thus he came to see value as a way of representing the significance of knowledge for future conduct. These convictions led him to reflect on the differences between pragmatism and positivism, and on the cognitive structure of value experiences. Lewis agreed that pragmatism committed one to the Peircean pragmatic test. But in a 1930 essay, \\"Pragmatism and Current Thought,\\" he maintained that this commitment can be taken in either of two directions. One direction emphasises the subjectivity of experience. The other direction, and the one he took in Mind and the World Order (1929), began with Peirce's limitation of meaning to that which makes a verifiable difference in experience. Hence concepts are abstractions in which \\"the immediate is precisely that element which must be left out\\". But this claim must be properly understood. An operational account of concepts mainly eliminates the ineffable: \\"If your hours are felt as twice as long as mine, your pounds twice as heavy, that makes no difference, which can be tested, in our assignment of physical properties to things.\\" Hence a concept is but a relational pattern. But it does not follow that one ought to discard the world as it is experienced: > In one sense, that of connotation, a concept strictly comprises nothing but > an abstract configuration of relations. In another sense, its denotation or > empirical application, this meaning is vested in a process which > characteristically begins with something given and ends with something done > in the operation which translates a presented datum into an instrument of > prediction and control. Thus knowledge begins and ends in experience, keeping in mind that the beginning and ending experiences differ. Knowledge of something requires that the verifying experience be actually experienced. Thus for the pragmatist, verifiability as an operational definition (or test) of the empirical meaning of a statement requires that the speaker know how to apply the statement, and when not to apply it, and be able to trace the consequences of the statement in situations both real and hypothetical. Lewis firmly objected to the positivist conception of value statements as devoid of cognitive content, as merely expressive. For a pragmatist, all judgements are implicitly value judgements. Lewis (1946) sets out both his conception of sense meaning, and his thesis that valuation is a form of empirical cognition. In his essay \\"Logical Positivism and Pragmatism,\\" Lewis revealed his disagreement with verificationism by comparing it unfavorably with his preferred pragmatic conception of empirical meaning. From the outset, he saw both pragmatism and logical positivism as forms of empiricism. At first glance, it would seem that the pragmatic conception of meaning, despite its different formulation and its focus on action, very much resembles the logical positivist verification requirement. Nevertheless, Lewis argued that there is a deep difference between the two: pragmatism ultimately grounds meaning on conceivable experience, while positivism reduces the relation between meaning and experience to a matter of logical form. For Lewis, the positivist conception of meaning omits precisely what a pragmatist would count as empirical meaning. Specifying which observation sentences follow from a given sentence helps us determine the empirical meaning of the given sentence only if the observation sentences themselves have an already understood meaning in terms of the specific qualities of experience to which the predicates of the observation sentences refer. Thus Lewis saw the logical positivists as failing to distinguish between \\"linguistic\\" meaning, namely the logical relations among terms, and \\"empirical\\" meaning, namely the relation expressions have to experience. (In the well-known terminology of Carnap and Charles W. Morris, empirical meaning falls under pragmatics, linguistic meaning under semantics.) For Lewis, the logical positivist shuts his eyes to precisely that which properly confirms a sentence, namely the content of experience. Epistemology Lewis (1929), Mind and the World Order, is now seen as one of the most important 20th century works in epistemology. Lewis is now included among the American pragmatists, a belated assessment that is the major theme of Murphey (2005). Lewis was an early exponent of coherentism, particularly as supported by probability observations such as those advocated by Thomas Bayes.Olsson, Erik (2017) \\"Coherentist Theories of Epistemic Justification\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta, editor He was the first to employ the term \\"qualia\\", popularized by his doctoral student Nelson Goodman, in its generally agreed modern sense.Lewis, Clarence Irving (1929). Mind and the world-order: Outline of a theory of knowledge. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons. p. 121 Ethics and aesthetics Lewis's late writings on ethics include the monographs Lewis (1955, 1957) and the posthumous collection Lewis (1969). From 1950 until his death, he wrote many drafts of chapters of a proposed treatise on ethics, which he did not live to complete. These drafts are included in the Lewis papers held at Stanford University. Lewis (1947) contains two chapters on aesthetics and the philosophy of art. Legacy Lewis's work has been relatively neglected in recent years, even though he set out his ideas at length. He can be understood as both a late pragmatist and an early analytic philosopher, and had students of the calibre of Brand Blanshard, Nelson Goodman, and Roderick Chisholm. Joel Isaac believes this neglect is justified.Joel Isaac (2006) Why not Lewis?, Transactions of the C. S. Peirce Society via Project Muse Ten lectures and short articles that Lewis produced in the 1950s were collected and edited by John Lange in 1969. The collection, Values and Imperatives: Studies in Ethics, was published by Stanford University Press. Lewis's reputation benefits from interest in his contributions to symbolic logic, binary relations, modal logic and the development of pragmatism in American philosophy.

He is the son of Jimmy Hoffa. James Hoffa was first elected in 1998, and subsequently re-elected in 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016 to five-year terms. In 2018, Hoffa was elected chair of the Road Transport Section of the International Transport Workers' Federation at its quadrennial Congress in Singapore. Hoffa is the second-longest serving General President of the Teamsters Union, after Dan Tobin, who served from 1907 to 1952. Personal life father in 1965 Hoffa is the only son of Jimmy Hoffa, who was also president of the Teamsters, and his wife Josephine (n√©e Poszywak). He is the brother of Judge Barbara Ann Crancer. Hoffa has a wife, Virginia, two sons, David and Geoffrey, and six grandchildren. Born in Detroit, Michigan on May 19, 1941, Hoffa attended Cooley High School. There, he became a member of the National Honor Society, and an all-city and all-state football player. During the summer months, the Hoffa family visited their cottage in rural Orion Township outside Detroit.How one man's bad luck paved way for creation of Cranbrook The Detroit News, January 14, 2002 Hoffa often accompanied his father to Teamster meetings and events, and became a Teamster in 1959 on his 18th birthday. Hoffa holds a degree in economics from Michigan State University (1963) and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Michigan Law School (1966). Hoffa was awarded a Ford Foundation Fellowship to work in the Michigan State Senate as an aide to senate and house members doing constituent relations and research. Hoffa is a member of Alpha Tau Omega. He was an attorney for the Teamsters from 1968 to 1993. Teamsters activity=1996 campaign Hoffa campaigned against the Teamsters incumbent president, Ron Carey, at the Teamsters international convention of June 1996 in Philadelphia. After nearly 500,000 votes were cast in early November, 1996, Ron Carey had won the election with 52 percent of the vote.Swoboda, Frank, \\"Carey Claims Reelection Win as Teamsters President; Thousands of Challenged Ballots Await Tabulation in Close Race Against James P.

A landmark agreement with United Parcel Service (UPS) was reached in July 2002 for the 210,000 Teamsters employed there. Hoping to avoid a damaging strike similar to the one in 1997, negotiators at UPS acquiesced to Teamster demands, producing a contract with a 25 percent increase in wages and benefits. \\"These negotiations have taken place in an economic climate in which millions of American workers are seeing their health benefits cut and their retirement savings wiped out.

Several months after DHL signed the agreement with the Teamsters eliminating the strike clause, more than 85% of the Union drivers were laid off. This contract ultimately led to the demise of the Union drivers at DHL. Facilities such as DTW (Romulus, MI) which had nearly 200 union drivers, now only has approximately 25 drivers.

Hoffa with the Mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, in 2017 For the last 14 months, Hoffa managed the Teamsters' effort as the union worked with YRC Worldwide (YRCW) as the country's largest less-than-truckload company struggled during the recession. The Teamsters and YRCW reached a labor cost savings agreement in August, and YRCW reached new bank terms with its lenders at the end of October. But in December, Hoffa sent letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, state Attorneys General, state insurance officials and Congressional leaders on financial industry oversight calling on regulators to review the questionable promotion of credit default swaps for bonds of YRCW. Hoffa urged the oversight bodies to investigate financial firms that were underwriting and/or marketing basis packages that consist of YRC bonds and credit default swaps. Two days after the letters were sent, YRC announced it had obtained the necessary thresholds on its bond holder debt-to- equity exchange offer, which was the final part of a comprehensive restructuring plan that required all major stakeholders‚Äîits workers, pension funds, secured lenders and bond holders‚Äîto contribute toward helping the company survive the worst freight recession in generations. Hoffa and the Teamsters were credited in several news reports for helping YRC avert bankruptcy. Bloomberg said Goldman Sachs helped YRCW complete the debt swap after the 'Teamsters Union said the bank was trying to profit from a failure of the largest U.S. trucker by sales.\\"Paulden, Pierre, and Detrixhe, John, Bloomberg. \\"Goldman Sachs Helps YRC Avert Bankruptcy Following Hoffa's Plea.\\" Jan. 1, 2010. Hoffa was re-elected to a fourth term heading the Teamsters Union in November 2011. He won nearly 59 percent the vote for another five- year term. The three-way race was between Hoffa, Fred Gegare and Sandy Pope. Gegare is a Wisconsin Teamster, trustee on a pension fund and a Teamsters International Vice President. Pope is president of Teamsters Local 805 in New York City. May 14, 2019 on PBS NewsHour, Hoffa endorsed President Trump's use of tariffs and a trade war with China to bring China to the table for a robust trade deal. He stated that his hope was that the tariffs would work to open the Chinese market for American goods long kept out, and that in the long run, opening the Chinese market would create more American jobs.

In September 2010, President Obama appointed Hoffa to the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations. Labor Day speech Hoffa speaks at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. On September 5, 2011, he caused some controversy when introducing President Obama at a Labor Day rally in Detroit, Michigan. In his remarks, an animated Hoffa stated \\"We have to keep an eye on the battle we face‚Äîa war on workers. And you see it everywhere there is the Tea Party. And you know there is only one way to beat and win that war. The one thing about working people is we like a good fight. And you know what, they've got a war, they've got a war with us and there is only going to be one winner. It is going to be the workers of Michigan and America ‚Äì we are going to win that war. All the way.\\" He then urged the audience to vote in the coming election and in reference to the Tea Party, stated, \\"Everybody here's got to vote,\\" Hoffa said. \\"If we go back and we keep the eye on the prize, let's take these sons-of-a-bitches out and give America back to America where we belong!\\"\\"Transcript: Teamsters Jim Hoffa's speech on Labor Day\\" \\"Detroit Free Press\\" September 6, 2011 Following the fiery remarks, some conservative media outlets chastised the Democratic Party and President Obama for not condemning Hoffa for using violent rhetoric of the kind some claimed as leading to the 2011 Tucson Shooting,Fox Nation Blog \\"HEATED DEBATE! DNC Refuses to Condemn Hoffa Hate on 'Fox & Friends' September 6, 2011, accessed September 6, 2011, while the White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said, \\"Mr. Hoffa speaks for himself, he speaks for the labor movement...The president speaks for himself.\\" However, Hoffa responded to the controversy by stating, \\"We didn't start this war‚Äîthe right wing did. My comments on Labor Day in Detroit echo the anger and frustration of American workers who are under attack by corporate-funded politicians who want to destroy the middle class. We're tired of seeing good-paying jobs shipped overseas. This fight is about the economy, it's about jobs and it's about rebuilding America. As I said yesterday in Detroit, we all have to vote in order to take these anti- worker politicians out of office. We're fighting back. That's what Teamsters do‚Äîwe stand up for what is right,\\" Hoffa said. \\"I will never apologize for standing up for my fellow Teamsters and all American workers.\\"Muskal, Michael. \\"James Hoffa stands by indelicate comments; White House steps back\\" \\"Los Angeles Times\\", September 6, 2011, accessed September 6, 2011. National Review's Jonah Goldberg supported Hoffa's language, if not the content, saying \\"We are in a really weird place where the head of the Teamsters can't talk tough. I mean, I guess ex-cons are the only ones left who can still talk like men every now and then.\\" Goldberg went on to state that the issue was not the language, but the \\"absolutely bizarre standard\\" for language established after Tucson. Some commentators and journalists have charged that the context of the quote was changed by editing out the \\"Everybody here's got to vote\\" passage by the news organization; Fox News Channel and other media outlets, thus fueling the controversy by making the speech sound like a call for violence instead of a call to vote.Ross, Dave \\"Brevity or Deception?\\" accessed September 7, 2011, Organizing successes Hoffa led a resurgence of the Teamsters resulting in a net increase of members in 2007, the first year of net growth in the union in nearly three decades. Significant organizing victories included more than 12,600 workers at UPS Freight, 9,000 mechanics at United Airlines, 22,000 school bus drivers at First Student/FirstGroup since 2006 under the union's Drive Up Standards campaign, 3,200 customer service representatives at America West Airlines, and nearly 900 crewmembers of Atlas Air, Inc. and Polar Air Cargo Worldwide. In 2009, more than 1,700 school bus workers employed at the Baumann transportation companies on Long Island joined the union. The organizing victory at UPS Freight was particularly noteworthy, because it is the former Overnite Transportation, which the union struggled to organize for many years. The campaign got a major boost when UPS purchased Overnite, and it became UPS Freight. \\"This [UPS Freight] is the largest organizing victory in the freight industry in 25 years. We were amazed that at the 90-day mark of our national campaign, 9,900 workers had signed cards. This shows the workers' commitment in joining a union that will give them a strong voice in the workplace.\\"Nyden, Paul, Charleston Gazette. \\"UPS Freight Workers Join Teamsters.\\" April 8, 2008. Online. \\"We announced two goals for the Teamsters in 2008: To organize 40,000 workers and to elect Barack Obama President of the United States. I am proud to say that thanks to the hard work by so many in our union, the Teamsters delivered on both promises.\\"\\"43,000 Teamsters Reach Organizing Milestone.\\" Teamster magazine. March/April 2009. The union's successful organizing plan has emphasized the Teamster core industries‚Äîparticularly those in the global supply chain‚Äîand the management of Hoffa and the Teamsters Organizing Department involved the entire union. The bulk of the organizing resulted from coordinated, disciplined campaigns in which numerous Teamster local unions and Joint Councils participated. Organizing has been a main theme of Hoffa's administration, culminating in 2005, when the Teamsters Union left the AFL-CIO to found the new Change to Win Federation with emphasis on organizing and growth. The union has achieved an annual increase in organizing gains every year since, with 2008 marking a record-breaking year. Hundreds of volunteer member organizers have arranged worker-to-worker contacts between Teamsters and unorganized workers in the same craft. In 2009, the Teamsters began a project to recruit and train 1,000 member organizers before the end of 2009 to be ready when the Employee Free Choice Act is passed. \\"There is no better spokesperson for the Teamsters than a Teamster like you,\\" Hoffa said. \\"‚Ä¶ We are engaged in national campaigns that will test the resources of the union. Without a mighty army of Teamster member organizers, we're not going to get it done.\\"\\"The Mighty Army of Teamster Organizers Wants You.\\" www.teamster.org. \\"We formed our union with the Teamsters so we could have an opportunity to negotiate for fair pay, benefits and equal treatment,\\" said Nicole Miles, a monitor at First Student in Parkville, Missouri and Local 838 member. \\"Coming from a Teamster family, I supported the Teamsters because I wanted to be part of a union that will support me. I'm proud of our vote to join the Teamsters.\\" Split from the AFL-CIO A billboard in Detroit supporting Hoffa in 1998 (still standing as of July 2006) Frustrated with the AFL-CIO's lack of emphasis on organizing, the Teamsters Union and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) split from the AFL-CIO on July 25, 2005. The group of breakaway unions, which later included the Laborer's, United Farm Workers and United Food and Commercial Workers Union, formed their own group called the Change to Win Federation. \\"We have been disappointed that over the last 10 years [the period of former AFL- CIO President John Sweeney's tenure] we have seen a decline in membership, a decline in density.\\"Edsall, Thomas, The Washington Post. \\"Two Top Unions Split From AFL-CIO.\\" July 25, 2005. Online. Hoffa further explained his union's decision to Fox News. \\"In our view, we must have more union members in order to change the political climate that is undermining workers' rights in this country. The AFL-CIO has chosen the opposite approach. We proposed that the AFL-CIO embark on a new course of action that would not only protect our existing Teamsters members and their families but lead to thousands of new working men and women to have the opportunity to organize into a strong union that would give them the chance to achieve the American dream to own their own home, send their kids to college and plan a strong retirement.Fox News. \\"Teamsters, SEIU Bolt the AFL-CIO.\\" July 26, 2005.

Life  Beckington was born at Beckington in Somerset, and was educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford. Having entered the Church he held many ecclesiastical appointments, and became dean of the Arches in 1423; and Archdeacon of Buckingham in 1424. After that he devoted his time to secular affairs and was sent on an embassy to Calais in 1439 and to John IV, count of Armagnac in 1442. At this time Beckington was acting as secretary to Henry VI, and soon after his return in 1443 he was appointed Lord Privy Seal, an office he held until 1444. He was consecrated bishop of Bath and Wells on 13 October 1443. The bishop erected many buildings in Wells and elsewhere, probably altering the rectory at Sutton Courtenay in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), an early preferment. The most important results of Beckington's missions to France were one Latin journal, written by himself, referring to the embassy to Calais; and another, written by one of his attendants, relating to the journey to Armagnac. He died at Wells on 14 January 1465. Beckington is buried at Wells Cathedral and has an unusual monument there: his effigy is depicted twice; one above the other in a two tier arrangement, the bottom effigy depicting his decaying corpse whilst unwrapped from its shroud, and the effigy above depicting him in what is assumed to be his bishop's attire. When his tomb was opened during Victorian times he was found to be buried very simply (as depicted on his tomb) with just one ornament: his bishop's ring. This was removed and is now in a museum. Beckington played a leading role as architect of the legal aspects of Henry VI's foundation of Eton College in 1440; he is commemorated in the name of the school's central dining hall, 'Bekynton'. Bekynton's architecture is marked with a symbol depicting a barrel and a flame. This is a pun on his name, being \\"beacon tun\\". One of the easiest to be viewed is in Penniless Porch Wells  Works  Beckington's own journal was published in the Proceedings of the Privy Council, vol. v., edited by Nicholas Harris Nicolas (1835); and the other journal in the Official Correspondence of Thomas Bekynton, edited by George Williams for the Rolls Series (1872), which contains many interesting letters. This second journal was translated into English by Nicolas (1828).

It is located on the River Barrow, near the border with County Kilkenny, and is around 20 km (12 miles) north east of Waterford. In 2016 it had a population of 8,040 people, making it the fourth-largest town in the county. History New Ross c. 1680 The port town of New Ross dates from pre-Middle Ages. The earliest settlement in this area dates to the 6th century when St. Abban of Magheranoidhe founded a monastery in what is now Irishtown. The original earthen banked circular enclosure of his monastery was visible around the graveyard until it was removed by the council. It was replaced by a concrete wall and steel fence. Its name, Ros, was shortened from Ros Mhic Treoin, or the Wood of the Son of Treoin. New Ross was in the territory of Dermot McMurrough and came to prominence when the Anglo-Normans conquered the region. The Norman knight William Marshall and his bride Isabella de Clare arrived during the early part of the 13th century. An earthen defensive structure called a motte was built at Old Ross in order to hold the newly conquered territory. A medieval borough sprung up around it - peopled by English and Welsh settlers. The arrival of Isabella and William is described in the Chronicles of Ross, which are in the British Museum. It records that in 1189, Isabella set about \\"building a lovely city on the banks of the Barrow\\". The town's fortunes further increased when King John made William the Earl of Pembroke at his coronation in 1199. A year later, the Earl Marshal transferred the Norman capital of Leinster to Kilkenny and New Ross became the main port. The town grew around the bridge built by William Marshal, son-in-law of Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (Strongbow), and a leader of the Norman invasion of Ireland. The town of New Ross (the town of the new bridge) was granted a Royal Charter in 1207. The port gained concessions from King John in 1215 and again in 1227 but these were later revoked by Henry III and Edward I to protect the port of Waterford. New Ross was still Ireland's busiest port in the 13th century. These restrictions were lifted in the 14th century by Edward II and Edward III. St Mary's Abbey (Church of Ireland) was built in 1811. There are two Roman Catholic churches, the parish church of SS. Michael and Mary completed in 1902, and the Augustinian church opened in 1835. New Ross in 1832 The town was fought over in the Irish Confederate Wars of the 1640s. In 1643, the town resisted the siege by James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, who fought a battle near the town with an Irish army under Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara but later re-conquered by Oliver Cromwell in 1649 who discharged three cannon shots at the Aldgate. The town is at an important crossing point, sited on the River Barrow between the river estuary to the south and the point where the River Nore joins the Barrow to the north. It was the location of one of the bloodiest battles of the 1798 rebellion. Education There are four primary schools in New Ross, two for boys, one for girls and one co-education school. The two boys' schools are Michael Street National School which caters for children from Junior Infants up until 1st Class. They then move up to the Senior school, New Ross CBS, which children attend from 2nd class onwards. The girls' primary school, St Joseph's, caters for students from Junior Infants to 6th Class. There is a mixed school in New Ross, St Canice's, which is situated across the bridge in Rosbercon. There are five secondary schools in New Ross, one is all-boys, two are all-girls, and two are mixed. St Augustine's and Good Counsel College, New Ross, is an all-boys school which caters for over 750 students making it by far the largest school in New Ross. St Mary's and Our Lady of Lourdes are the two all-girl secondary schools. The two mixed schools are the Vocational College and the CBS Secondary. Sport Sporting organisations in the town of New Ross include Geraldine O'Hanrahans GAA Club, St Michaels Boxing Club, New Ross RFC, New Ross Celtic Soccer Club, New Ross Town Soccer Club, New Ross Boat Club, New Ross Badminton Club, New Ross Swimming Club, Dunbrody Archers, United Striders AC and New Ross Golf Club. Arts and culture The town's arts centre is St Michael's Theatre. The present building was built in 1806, eight years after the insurrection of 1798 and served as the parish church until 1902 when the new parish church, St Mary's & Michael's, was opened. St Michael's has a staff of 12, a 300-seat theatre, a 50-seat studio venue, an art gallery, a cinema, a coffee shop and a bar. The Tholsel New Ross is home to the Ros Tapestry project, a community initiative undertaken throughout County Wexford by a team of 150 voluntary embroiderers. The Ros Tapestries depict events including the founding of New Ross by William Marshall. The first tapestry was completed in 2002 and to date all but one of the 15 tapestries are complete. In 2009 the Ros Tapestry Exhibition was opened at The Quay, New Ross. Transport=Road The road crossing the Barrow is the N25 road linking Cork, Waterford City away and Rosslare Harbour away. The N30 links Enniscorthy and New Ross. Bus links The town is served by several bus routes and its main stop is on the town's quay. There are services to and from Waterford each day.

Wexford Bus operate a service between Wexford and Waterford while Kilbride Coaches operate a route linking the town to Kilkenny. Wexford Local Link operate services to Enniscorthy. Rail New Ross railway station opened on 19 September 1887, closed for passenger traffic on 30 March 1964 and closed for goods traffic by 1995. Sea New Ross is Ireland's only inland port, located from the sea on the River Barrow. A small marina is located downstream of the town. The tall ship Asgard II which provided sail-training, sometimes docked in New Ross on its travels. Economy Until the creation of ships too large to reach the port, in the 19th century, New Ross was a port town. However, the river is too shallow to allow passage of large ships and the port gradually went into decline. The town continued to be a market town for the rich agricultural hinterland, but suffered from recession throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and early part of the 1990s. As of the 21st century, there is some industry in the area, with businesses centering on services and retail. Retail outlets including Tesco, Lidl and Aldi are located away from the centre of town. Tourism The Ros Tapestry Exhibition Centre located on the Quay in New Ross, is a series of 15 embroidered Tapestry panels.

He was the first Muslim to have successfully captured Sindh. Sources Information about Muhammad bin Qasim and the Arab conquest of Sind in the medieval Arabic sources is limited compared to the contemporary Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. The Futuh al-Buldan (Conquests of the lands) by al- Baladhuri (d. 892) contains a few pages on the conquest of Sindh and Muhammad's forces, while biographical information is limited to a passage in the work of al-Ya'qubi (d. 898), a few lines in the history of al-Tabari (d. 839) and scant mention in the Kitab al-aghani (Book of songs) of Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani. A detailed account of Muhammad's conquest of Sind and his death is found in the Chach Nama, a 13th-century Persian text. The information in the Chach Nama purportedly derives from accounts by the descendants of the Arab soldiers of the 8th-century conquest, namely qadis (judges) and imams from the Sindhi cities of Alor and Bhakar who claimed descent from Muhammad's tribe, the Banu Thaqif. The orientalist Francesco Gabrieli holds the accounts likely emerged after and considers the Chach Nama to be a \\"historical romance\\" and \\"a late and doubtful source\\" for information about Muhammad. Origins and early life Muhammad was born in . His birthplace was almost certainly in the Hejaz (western Arabia), either in Ta'if, the traditional home of his Thaqif tribe, or in Mecca or Medina. Following their general embrace of Islam in , members of the Thaqif gradually attained high military and administrative ranks in the nascent Caliphate and played important command and economic roles during and after the early Muslim conquests, particularly in Iraq. The tribe produced effective commanders associated with early Arab military operations against the Indian subcontinent: in the Thaqafite governor of Bahrayn (eastern Arabia), Uthman ibn Abi al-As, dispatched naval expeditions against the Indian ports of Debal, Thane and Bharuch. The tribe's power continued to increase with the advent of the Umayyad Caliphate in 661. Muhammad belonged to the Abu Aqil family of the Banu Awf, one of the two principal branches of the Thaqif. The Abu Aqil family gained prestige with the rise of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, the paternal first cousin of Muhammad's father al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn al-Hakam. Al-Hajjaj was made a commander by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik () during the Second Muslim Civil War and killed the Umayyads' chief rival for the caliphate, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, in 692, and two years later was appointed the viceroy of Iraq and the eastern Caliphate. Following his promotion, al- Hajjaj became a patron of the Thaqif and appointed several members to important posts in Iraq and its dependencies. Muhammad's father was appointed the deputy governor of Basra, though his career was otherwise undistinguished. According to a letter between Muhammad and al-Hajjaj cited by the Chach Nama, Muhammad's mother was a certain Habibat al-Uzma (Habiba the Great). The Chach Nama also indicates Muhammad had a similar-aged brother named Sulb and Arabic sources indicate he had a much younger brother named al-Hajjaj, who served as an Umayyad commander during the Alid revolt of 740. No information is provided by the Arabic sources about Muhammad's childhood and adolescence. The modern historian Nabi Bakhsh Baloch holds that Muhammad most likely grew up partly in Ta'if and then Basra and Wasit, the provincial capital of Iraq founded by al- Hajjaj in 702. Muhammad's time in Basra, a military and intellectual center of the Islamic world at the time, may have widened Muhammad's career horizons, while at Wasit he was likely educated and trained under al-Hajjaj's patronage. Al-Hajjaj was highly fond of Muhammad, and considered him prestigious enough to marry his sister Zaynab, though she preferred the older Thaqafite al-Hakam ibn Ayyub ibn al-Hakam, to whom she was ultimately wed. The Kitab al-aghani refers to Muhammad at the age of 17 as \\"the noblest Thaqafite of his time\\". In the summation of Baloch, \\"Muhammad grew up under favorable conditions into an able, energetic and cultured lad of fine tastes\\". Governor of Fars Muhammad's first assignment was in the province Fars in modern Iran, where he was asked to subjugate a group of Kurds. After the successful completion of the mission, he was appointed as the governor of Fars. He likely succeeded his uncle Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi, a brother of al-Hajjaj, who was previously a governor. The city of Shiraz is said to have been revived by Muhammad. He built a royal villa in the city and a military camp at a short distance from it. He was also given the task of subjugating the area to the south of Shiraz, and the distant area of Jurjan near the Caspian Sea. Fars might have also had at this time some of the rebels left over from the revolt of Ibn al-Ash'ath, which almost brought down the rule of al-Hajjaj. An aged supporter of rebels and a Shia notable of the time, a disciple of the companion of Prophet Jabir ibn Abd Allah al-Ansari and a famous narrator of Hadith,Maclean, Derryl N. (1989), Religion and Society in Arab Sind, BRILL, pp. 126, Atiyya ibn Sa'd Awfi was arrested by Muhammad bin Qasim on the orders of Al-Hajjaj and demanded that he curse Ali on threat of punishment. Atiyya refused to curse Ali and was punished. While Maclean doesn't give the details of the punishment, early historians like Ibn Hajar Al-asqalani and Tabari record that he was flogged by 400 lashes and his head and beard shaved for humiliation and that he fled to Khurasan and returned to Iraq after the ruler had been changed.History of al-Tabari Vol. 39, pp. 228, under \\"Those Who Died in the Year 111\\", State University of New York Press, (1998).Ibn Hajar al-‚ÄòAsqalani, \\"Tahdhib al-Tahdhib\\", Volume 7, pp 226, narrator no. 413. Background on Sindh=Early Muslim presence in Sindh Rashidun Caliphate (632-661 AD) The connection between the Hindu Sind and Islam was established by the initial Muslim missions during the Rashidun Caliphate. Al- Hakim ibn Jabalah al-Abdi, who attacked Makran in the year 649 AD, was an early partisan of Ali ibn Abu Talib. During the caliphate of Ali, many Jats of Sindh had came under influence of IslamS. A. A. Rizvi, \\"A socio-intellectual History of Isna Ashari Shi'is in India\\", Volo. 1, pp. 138, Mar'ifat Publishing House, Canberra (1986). and some even participated in the Battle of Camel and died fighting for Ali. Harith ibn Murrah Al-abdi and Sayfi ibn Fasayl' al- Shaybani, both officers of Ali's army, attacked Makran in the year 658. Sayfi was one of the seven shias who were beheaded alongside Hujr ibn Adi al-Kindi in 660 AD near Damascus. Under the Umayyads (661 - 750 AD), many Shias sought asylum in the region of Sindh, to live in relative peace in the remote area. Ziyad Hindi is one of those refugees.S. A. N. Rezavi, \\"The Shia Muslims\\", in History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization, Vol. 2, Part. 2: \\"Religious Movements and Institutions in Medieval India\\", Chapter 13, Oxford University Press (2006). Umayyad interest in Sindh Map of expansion of Umayyad Caliphate According to Wink, Umayyad interest in the region was galvanized by the operation of the Meds (a tribe of Scythians living in Sindh) and others. The Meds had engaged in piracy on Sassanid shipping in the past, from the mouth of the Tigris to the Sri Lankan coast, in their bawarij and now were able to prey on Arab shipping from their bases at Kutch, Debal and Kathiawar. At the time, Sindh was the wild frontier region of al-Hind, inhabited mostly by semi-nomadic tribes whose activities disturbed much of the Western Indian Ocean. Muslim sources insist that it was these persistent activities along increasingly important Indian trade routes by Debal pirates and others which forced the Arabs to subjugate the area, in order to control the seaports and maritime routes of which Sindh was the nucleus, as well as, the overland passage. During Hajjaj's governorship, the Meds of Debal in one of their raids had kidnapped Muslim women travelling from Sri Lanka to Arabia, thus providing grounds to the rising power of the Umayyad Caliphate that enabled them to gain a foothold in the Makran, Balochistan and Sindh regions.Nicholas F. Gier, From Mongols to Mughals: Religious violence in India 9th-18th centuries, Presented at the Pacific Northwest Regional Meeting American Academy of Religion, Gonzaga University, May 2006. The Umayyad Caliphate on the eve of the invasions of Spain and Sindh in 710. Also cited as a reason for this campaign was the policy of providing refuge to Sassanids fleeing the Arab advance and to Arab rebels from the Umayyad consolidation of their rule. These Arabs were imprisoned later on by the Governor Deebal Partaab Raye. A letter written by an Arab girl named Nahed who escaped from the prison of Partab Raye asked Hajjaj Bin Yusuf for help. When Hajjaj asked Dahir for the release of prisoners and compensation, the latter refused on the ground that he had no control over those. Al-Hajjaj sent Muhammad Bin Qasim for action against the Sindh in 711. The mawali; new non-Arab converts; who were usually allied with Al-Hajjaj's political opponents and thus were frequently forced to participate in battles on the frontier of the Umayyad Caliphate ‚Äî such as Kabul, Sindh and Transoxania. An actual push into the region had been out of favor as an Arab policy since the time of the Rashidun Caliph Umar bin Khattab, who upon receipt of reports of it being an inhospitable and poor land, had stopped further expeditionary ventures into the region. The campaign of Muhammad bin Qasim Hajjaj had put more care and planning into this campaign than the second campaign. Al-Hajjaj gave Muhammad command of the expedition between 708 and 711, when Muhammad was only 15‚Äì17 years old, apparently because two previous Umayyad commanders had not been successful in punishing Sindh's ruler Raja Dahir for his failure to prevent pirates from disrupting Muslim shipping off the coast of Sindh. Al- Hajjaj superintended this campaign from Kufa by maintaining close contact with Muhammad in the form of regular reports for which purpose special messengers were deputed between Basra and Sindh. The army which departed from Shiraz under Muhammad consisted of 6,000 Syrian cavalry and detachments of mawali (sing. mawla; non-Arab, Muslim freedmen) from Iraq. At the borders of Sindh he was joined by an advance guard and six thousand camel cavalry and later, reinforcements from the governor of Makran were transferred directly to Debal (Daybul), at the mouth of the Indus, by sea along with five manjaniks (catapults). The army that eventually captured Sindh would later be swelled by the Gurjars and Meds as well as other irregulars who heard of the Arab successes in Sindh. When Muhammad passed through the Makran desert while raising his forces, he had to subdue the restive towns of Fannazbur and Arman Belah (Lasbela), both of which had previously been conquered by the Arabs. Extent and expansion of Umayyad rule under Muhammad bin Qasim in medieval India (modern international boundaries shown in red). The first town assaulted in Muhammad's Sindh campaign was Debal and upon the orders of al-Hajjaj, he exacted a retribution on Debal by giving no quarter to its residents or priests and destroying its great temple. From Debal, the Arab army then marched northeast taking towns such as Nerun and Sadusan (Sehwan) without fighting. One-fifth of the war booty including slaves were remitted to al- Hajjaj and the Caliph. The conquest of these towns was accomplished with relative ease; however, Dahir's armies being prepared on the other side of the Indus had not yet been confronted. In preparation to meet them, Muhammad returned to Nerun to resupply and receive reinforcements sent by al-Hajjaj. Camped on the east bank of the Indus, Muhammad sent emissaries and bargained with the river Jats and boatmen. Upon securing the aid of Mokah Basayah, \\"the King of the island of Bet\\", Muhammad crossed over the river where he was joined by the forces of the Thakore of Bhatta and the western Jats. At Ar-rur (Rohri) Muhammad was met by Dahir's forces and the eastern Jats in battle. Dahir died in the battle, his forces were defeated and Muhammad took control of Sindh. In the wake of the battle enemy soldiers were executed ‚Äîthough artisans, merchants and farmers were spared ‚Äîand Dahir and his chiefs, the \\"daughters of princes\\" and the usual fifth of the booty and slaves were sent to al-Hajjaj. Soon the capitals of the other provinces, Brahmanabad, Alor (Battle of Aror) and Multan, were captured alongside other in-between towns with only light Muslim casualties. Multan was a key site in the Hindu religion. Usually after a siege of a few weeks or months the Arabs gained a city through the intervention of heads of mercantile houses with whom subsequent treaties and agreements would be settled. After battles all fighting men were executed and their wives and children enslaved in considerable numbers and the usual fifth of the booty and slaves were sent to al-Hajjaj. The general populace was encouraged to carry on with their trades and taxes and tributes settled. The conquest of Sindh, in modern-day Pakistan, although costly, was a major gain for the Umayyad Caliphate. However, further gains were halted by Hindu kingdoms during Arab campaigns. The Arabs attempted to invade India but they were defeated by the north Indian king Nagabhata of the Gurjara Pratihara Dynasty and by the south Indian Emperor Vikramaditya II of the Chalukya dynasty in the early 8th century. After the failure of further expeditions on Kathiawar, the Arab chroniclers conceded that the Abbasid caliph al-Mahdi () \\"gave up the project of conquering any part of India.\\" Military and political strategy The military strategy had been outlined by Al-Hajjaj in a letter sent to Muhammad bin Qasim: > My ruling is given: Kill anyone belonging to the ahl-i-harb (combatants); > arrest their sons and daughters for hostages and imprison them. Whoever does > not fight against us...grant them aman (safety) and settle their tribute > [amwal] as dhimmah (protected person)... The Arabs' first concern was to facilitate the conquest of Sindh with the fewest casualties while also trying to preserve the economic infrastructure. Towns were given two options: submit to Islamic authority peacefully or be attacked by force (), with the choice governing their treatment upon capture. The capture of towns was usually accomplished by means of a treaty with a party from among the enemy, who were then extended special privileges and material rewards. There were two types of such treaties, \\"Sulh\\" or \\"ahd-e- wasiq (capitulation)\\" and \\"aman (surrender/ peace)\\". Among towns and fortresses that were captured through force of arms, Muhammad bin Qasim performed executions of ahl-i-harb (fighting men) as part of his military strategy, whose surviving dependents were enslaved. Where resistance was strong, prolonged and intensive, often resulting in considerable Arab casualties, Muhammad bin Qasim's response was dramatic, inflicting 6,000 deaths at Rawar, between 6,000 and 26,000 at Brahmanabad, 4,000 at Iskalandah and 6,000 at Multan. Conversely, in areas taken by sulh, such as Armabil, Nirun, and Aror, resistance was light and few casualties occurred. Sulh appeared to be Muhammad bin Qasim's preferred mode of conquest, the method used for more than 60% of the towns and tribes recorded by al-Baladhuri and the Chach Nama. At one point, he was actually berated by Al-Hajjaj for being too lenient. Meanwhile, the common folk were often pardoned and encouraged to continue working; Al-Hajjaj ordered that this option not be granted to any inhabitant of Debal, yet Qasim still bestowed it upon certain groups and individuals. After each major phase of his conquest, Muhammad bin Qasim attempted to establish law and order in the newly conquered territory by showing religious tolerance and incorporating the ruling class ‚Äì the Brahmins and Shramanas ‚Äì into his administration. Reasons for success Muhammad bin Qasim's success has been partly ascribed to Dahir being an unpopular Hindu king ruling over a Buddhist majority who saw Chach of Alor and his kin as usurpers of the Rai Dynasty. This is attributed to having resulted in support being provided by Buddhists and inclusion of rebel soldiers serving as valuable infantry in his cavalry-heavy force from the Jat and Meds.\\"The fall of Multan laid the Indus valley at the feet of the conqueror. The tribes came in, 'ringing bells and beating drums and dancing,' in token of welcome. The Hindu rulers had oppressed them heavily, and the Jats and Meds and other tribes were on the side of the invaders. The work of conquest, as often happened in India, was thus aided by the disunion of the inhabitants, and jealousies of race and creed conspired to help the Muslims. To such suppliants Mohammad Kasim gave the liberal terms that the Arabs usually offered to all but inveterate foes. He imposed the customary poll-tax, took hostages for good conduct, and spared the people's lands and lives. He even left their shrines undesecrated: 'The temples,' he proclaimed, 'shall be inviolate, like the churches of the Christians, the synagogues of the Jews, and the altars of the Magians.'\\" Stanley Lane-Poole, Medieval India under Mohammedan Rule, 712-1764, G.P.

Along with this were: # Superior military equipment; such as siege engines and the Mongol bow. # Troop discipline and leadership. # The concept of Jihad as a morale booster. # Religion; the widespread belief in the prophecy of Muslim success. # The Samanis being persuaded to submit and not take up arms because the majority of the population was Buddhist who were dissatisfied with their rulers, who were Hindu. # The laboring under disabilities of the Lohana Jats. # Defections from among Dahirs chiefs and nobles. Administration of Sindh After the conquest, Muhammad bin Qasim's task was to set up an administrative structure for a stable Muslim state that incorporated a newly conquered alien land, inhabited by non-Muslims.Appleby. pg. 291-292 He adopted a conciliatory policy, asking for acceptance of Muslim rule by the natives in return for non-interference in their religious practice, so long as the natives paid their taxes and tribute. In return, the state provided protection to non-Muslim from any foreign attacks and enemies. He established Islamic Sharia law over the people of the region; however, Hindus were allowed to rule their villages and settle their disputes according to their own laws, and traditional hierarchical institutions, including the village headmen () and chieftains () were maintained. A Muslim officer called an amil was stationed with a troop of cavalry to manage each town on a hereditary basis Everywhere taxes (mal) and tribute (kharaj) were settled and hostages taken ‚Äî occasionally this also meant the custodians of temples. Non- Muslim natives were excused from military service and from payment of the religiously mandated tax system levied upon Muslims called Zakat, the tax system levied upon them instead was the jizya - a progressive tax, being heavier on the upper classes and light for the poor. In addition, three percent of government revenue was allocated to the Brahmins. Incorporation of ruling elite into administration During his administration, Hindus and Buddhists were inducted into the administration as trusted advisors and governors. A Hindu, Kaksa, was at one point the second most important member of his administration.H. M. Elliot and John Dowson, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians, (London, 1867-1877), vol. 1, p. 203. \\"Kaksa took precedence in the army before all the nobles and commanders.

Religion Lane-Poole writes that, \\"as a rule Muslim government was at once tolerant and economic\\".Medieval India by Stanly Lane-Poole, Pub 1970, Page 10. The preference of collection of jizya over the conversion to Islam is a major economic motivator.Habib Tiliouine, Richard J. Estes, 2016, \\"The State of Social Progress of Islamic Societies\\", Springer, page 338.John Powell, 2010, \\"Weapons & Warfare: Warfare : culture and concepts\\", Salem Press, page 884. Hindus and Buddhists who were classified as Dhimmis had to pay mandatory Jizya, Jizya is normally higher than the zakat to be paid by Muslims.Bj√∏rn Olav Utvik, 2006, \\"The Pious Road to Development: Islamist Economics in Egypt\\", Hurst & Company, page 101.The French scholar Gustave Le Bon (the author of La civilisation des Arabes) writes \\"the incidence of taxation fell more heavily on a Muslim than a non-Muslim.\\" Mun'im Sirry (2014), Scriptural Polemics: The Qur'an and Other Religions, p.179.

Patrick Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World. Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 219. In Al-Biruni's narrative, according to Manan Ahmed Asif ‚Äì a historian of Islam in South and Southeast Asia, \\"Qasim first asserts the superiority of Islam over the polytheists by committing a taboo (killing a cow) and publicly soiling the idol (giving the cow meat as an offering)\\" before allowing the temple to continue as a place of worship. A religious Islamic office, \\"sadru-I-Islam al affal\\", was created to oversee the secular governors. The native hereditary elites were reappointed with the title of rana. According to Yohanan Friedmann, Qasim declared that the Brahmins of Brahmanabad were good people.Iqtidar Hisain Siddiqui, 2010, Indo-Persian historiography up to thirteenth century, Primum Books, Delhi. While proselytization occurred, given the social dynamics of areas of Sindh conquered by Muslim, the spread of Islam was slow and took centuries. No mass conversions to Islam took place and some temples escaped destruction such as the Sun Temple of Multan on payment of jizya.Schimmel pg.4 In the Arab settlers controlled areas of Sindh and Multan, conversion to Islam occurred only slowly, not on a massive scale. Majority of the population continued to remain Hindu who had to pay the jizya imposed by the Muslim state.Mohammad Yunus, Aradhana Parmar, 2003, \\"South Asia: A Historical Narrative\\", Oxford University Press, page 123. Death Muhammad had begun preparations for further expansions when al-Hajjaj died in 714, followed a year later by Caliph al-Walid I, who was succeeded by his brother Sulayman. The latter took revenge against the generals and officials who had been close to al-Hajjaj. Sulayman owed political support to al-Hajjaj's opponents and so recalled both of al-Hajjaj's successful generals Qutayba ibn Muslim, the conqueror of Transoxiana (Central Asia) and Muhammad. He also appointed the son of the distinguished general al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra, Yazid, who was once imprisoned and tortured by al-Hajjaj, as the governor of Fars, Kirman, Makran, and Sindh; he immediately placed Muhammad in chains. There are two different accounts regarding the details of Muhammad's fate: * According to al-Baladhuri Muhammad was killed due to a family feud with the governor of Iraq. Sulayman was hostile toward Muhammad because apparently he had followed the order of Hajjaj to declare Sulayman's right of succession void in all territories conquered by him. When Muhammad received the news of the death of al-Hajjaj he returned to Aror. Muhammad was later arrested under the orders of the Caliph by the replacement governor of Sindh, Yazid ibn Abi Kabsha al-Sasaki, who worked under the new military governor of Iraq, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, and the new fiscal governor, the mawla Salih ibn Abd al- Rahman. Salih, whose brother was executed by al-Hajjaj, tortured Muhammad and his relatives to death. The account of his death by al-Baladhuri is brief compared to the one in the Chach Nama. * The Chach Nama narrates a tale in which Muhammad's demise is attributed to the daughters of Dahir who had been taken captive during the campaign. Upon capture they had been sent on as presents to the Caliph for his harem in the capital Baghdad (however Baghdad had not yet been built and the actual capital was Damascus). The account relates that they then tricked the Caliph into believing that Muhammad had violated them before sending them on and as a result of this subterfuge, Muhammad was wrapped and stitched in oxen hides,Pakistan, the cultural heritage by A·∏•mad ShujƒÅ ª PƒÅshƒÅ Sang-e-Meel Publications, 1998, Page 43 and sent to Syria, which resulted in his death en route from suffocation. This narrative attributes their motive for this subterfuge to securing vengeance for their father's death. Upon discovering this subterfuge, the Caliph is recorded to have been filled with remorse and ordered the sisters buried alive in a wall.Keay, pg. 185 Aftermath After bin Qasim's departure, the next appointed Arab governor died on arrival. Dahir's son recaptured Brahmanabad and c. 720, he was granted pardon and included in the administration in return for converting to Islam. Soon, however, he recanted and split off when the Umayyads were embroiled in a succession crisis. Later, Junayd ibn Abd al- Rahman al-Murri killed Jaisiah and recaptured the territory before his successors once again struggled to hold and keep it. During the Abassid period, c. 870, the local emirs shook off all allegiance to the caliphs and by the 10th century the region was split into two weak states, Mansurah on the lower Indus and Multan on the upper Indus, which were soon captured by Ismailis who set up an independent Fatimid state.Keay, pg 186-187 These successor states did not achieve much and shrank in size. The Arab conquest remained checked in what is now the south of Pakistan for three centuries by powerful Hindu monarchs to the north and east until the arrival of Mahmud of Ghazni.Akbar, M.J, The Shade of Swords, Routledge (UK), December 1, 2003, pg.102. Controversy There is controversy regarding the conquest and subsequent conversion of Sindh. This is usually voiced in two antagonistic perspectives viewing Qasim's actions: His conquest, as described by Stanley Lane-Poole, in Medieval India (Published in 1970 by Haskell House Publishers Ltd), was \\"liberal\\". He imposed the customary poll tax, took hostages for good conduct and spared peoples' lives and lands. He even left their shrines undesecrated: 'The temples;' he proclaimed, 'shall be inviolate, like the churches of the Christians, the synagogues of the Jews and altars of the Magians'.Medieval India by Stanley Lane-Poole, Published by Haskell House Publishers Ltd. NY 1970. Page 10 In the same text, however, it is mentioned that \\"Occasional desecration of Hindu fanes took place... but such demonstrations were probably rare sops to the official conscience...\\", as destruction of temples and civilian massacres still took place.A Book of Conquest, p. 169, authored by Manan Ahmed Asif, published by Oxford University Press, 19-Sep-2016. #Coercive conversion has been attributed to early historians such as Elliot, Cousens, Majumdar and Vaidya. They hold the view that the conversion of Sindh was necessitated. Qasim's numerical inferiority is said to explain any instances of apparent religious toleration, with the destruction of temples seen as a reflection of the more basic, religiously motivated intolerance. #Voluntary conversion has been attributed to Thomas W. Arnold and modern Muslim historians such as Habib and Qureishi. They believe that the conquest was largely peaceful, and the conversion entirely so, and that the Arab forces enacted liberal, generous and tolerant policies. These historians mention the \\"praiseworthy conduct of Arab Muslims\\" and attribute their actions to a \\"superior civilizational complex\\". Various polemical perceptions of Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism are also reflected in this debate. The period of Qasim's rule has been called by U.T. Thakkur \\"the darkest period in Sind history\\", with the records speaking of massive forced conversions, temple destruction, slaughters and genocides; the people of Sindh, described as inherently pacifist due to their Hindu/Buddhist religious inclinations, had to adjust to the conditions of \\"barbarian inroad\\".Sindhi Culture by U.T. Thakkur, University of Bombay 1959 On one extreme, the Arab Muslims are seen as being compelled by religious stricture to conquer and forcibly convert Sindh, but on the other hand, they can be seen as being respectful and tolerant of non-Muslims as part of their religious duty, with conversion being facilitated by the vitality, equality and morals of the Islamic religion. Citations of towns taken either violently or bloodlessly, reading back into Arab Sindh information belonging to a later date and dubious accounts such as those of the forcible circumcision of Brahmins at Debal or Qasims consideration of Hindu sentiment in forbidding the slaughter of cows are used as examples for one particular view or the other. Some historians strike a middle ground, saying that Qasim was torn between the political expediency of making peace with the Hindus and Buddhists; having to call upon non-Muslims to serve under him as part of his mandate to administer newly conquered land; and orthodoxy by refraining from seeking the co-operation of \\"infidels\\". It is contended that Qasim may have struck a middle ground, conferring the status of Dhimmi upon the native Sindhis and permitting them to participate in his administration, but treating them as \\"noncitizens\\" (i.e. in the Caliphate, but not of it). While Muhammad's warring was clearly at times brutal, he is supposed to have said of Hinduism that 'the idol temple is similar to the churches of the Christians, (to the synagogues) of the Jews and to the fire temples of the Zoroastrians' (mƒÅ al-budd illƒÅ ka-kanƒÅ æis al-na·π£ƒÅrƒÅ wa ‚Äôl-yah≈´d wa-buy≈´t nƒ´rƒÅn al-madj≈´s). This 'seems to be the earliest statement justifying the inclusion of the Hindus in the category of ahl al-dhimma, leading Muhammad to be viewed by many modern Muslims as a paragon of religious tolerance. Legacy * Qasim's presence and rule was very brief. His conquest for the Umayyads brought Sindh into the orbit of the Muslim world.Markovits, Claude The Global World of Indian Merchants, 1750-1947: Traders of Sind from Bukhara to Panama, Cambridge University Press, June 22, 2000, , pg. 34. * After the conquest of Sindh, Qasim adopted the Hanafi school of Sharia law which regarded Hindus, Buddhists and Jains as \\"dhimmis\\" and \\"People of the Book\\", allowing them religious freedom as long as they continued to pay the tax known as \\"jizya\\". This approach would prove critical to the way Muslim rulers ruled in India over the next centuries. * Coastal trade and a Muslim colony in Sindh allowed for cultural exchanges and the arrival of Sufi missionaries to expand Muslim influence.Federal Research Division. \\"Pakistan a Country Study\\", Kessinger Publishing, June 1, 2004, pg.45.

This technique alters the wind resistance and weight on one side of the ball, causing it to move in an atypical manner. It may also cause the ball to \\"slip\\" out of the pitcher's fingers without the usual spin that accompanies a pitch. In this sense, a spitball can be thought of as a fastball with knuckleball action. Alternative names for the spitball are spitter, mud ball, shine ball, supersinker, vaseline ball (because originally, Vaseline was used to give the ball a little more break), and emery ball. A spitball technically differs from a standard emery ball, in which the surface of the ball is cut or abraded. The general term for altering the ball in any way is doctoring. History The invention of the spitball has been popularly credited to a number of individuals, among them Elmer Stricklett and Frank Corridon. Numerous accounts, however, refer to different players experimenting with versions of the spitball throughout the latter half of the 19th century, and it remains unlikely that any one individual \\"invented\\" the spitball. Ed Walsh, however, is certainly responsible for popularizing it. Walsh dominated the American League from 1906‚Äì1912, primarily on the strength of his spitball, and pitchers around the league soon copied his spitball or invented their own trick pitch. The dramatic increase in the popularity of \\"freak deliveries\\" led to a great deal of controversy throughout the 1910s regarding the abolition of the spitball and related pitches. In his autobiography, Ty Cobb wrote that such \\"freak pitches [...] were outlawed when the owners greedily sold out to home runs.\\" In addition, there were serious issues with the spitball, including some that affected safety. A variation on the standard spitball called for the pitcher to smear the entire surface of the normally white ball with a mixture of tobacco spittle and dirt or mud in order to stain it the same deep brown color as the infield which made it nearly impossible for batters to see (and sometimes avoid) in low-light conditions. In August 1920, Ray Chapman was killed when he was struck in the temple by a spitball thrown by pitcher Carl Mays during a poorly lit game. Ban In Major League Baseball (MLB), the spitball was banned in two stages. In the winter of 1919‚Äì1920, managers voted to partially ban the spitball. Each team was allowed to designate up to two pitchers who would be permitted to throw spitballs. After the 1920 season, the use of the spitball was banned with the exception of a group of 17 existing spitballers, who were grandfathered in and allowed to throw the pitch legally until they retired. Of the exempted group, Burleigh Grimes lasted the longest, retiring in 1934. The complete list of exempted spitballers is: Ray Fisher (played through 1920); Doc Ayers (1921); Ray Caldwell (1921); Phil Douglas (1922); Dana Fillingim (1925); Marv Goodwin (1925); Dutch Leonard (1925); Allen Russell (1925); Allen Sothoron (1926); Dick Rudolph (1927); Stan Coveleski (1928); Urban Shocker (1928); Bill Doak (1929); Clarence Mitchell (1932); Red Faber (1933); Jack Quinn (1933); and Grimes. In March 1955, MLB Commissioner Ford Frick advocated for the return of the spitball, telling a sportswriter, \\"If I had my way, I'd legalize the old spitter. It was a great pitch and one of the easiest to throw. There was nothing dangerous about it.\\" Despite the Commissioner's enthusiasm, the pitch remained illegal. Methodology Although the spitball is now banned at all levels of professional and organized amateur baseball, it is still sometimes thrown in violation of the rules. (In 1942, Leo Durocher, then-manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, fined Bobo Newsom for throwing a spitball and \\"lying to me about it.\\") Typically, a lubricant is hidden behind the pitcher's knee or under the peak of his cap. Others will place the ball in their mitt and then cough on or lick it. Another tactic pitchers use is to soak their hair in water before going out to the mound, and then rub their hair before a pitch. Some pitchers have even glued a piece of sandpaper to one of their fingers and scuffed the ball to achieve an effect similar to the spitball. Ted \\"Double Duty\\" Radcliffe stated that he would hide a piece of emery board in his belt buckle so that he could roughen the ball or even cut it. During the Minnesota Twins' 1987 pennant chase, starting pitcher Joe Niekro was suspended when he was caught on the field with a nail file in his back pocket. Niekro said in defense that he had been filing his nails, a common practice amongst knuckleball pitchers. One week later, Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Kevin Gross was caught with sandpaper in his glove and suspended. In the 1986 season, Houston Astros pitcher Mike Scott was frequently accused of cheating.http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/readers/baseball/cheaters.html After Scott's dominating performance in Game 4 of the 1986 NLCS, New York Mets player Wally Backman presented to the media a collection of 17 balls scuffed the same way as proof of Scott's questionable practice. Preacher Roe, who played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1950s, was renowned both for his ability to control the spitball and to throw it without getting caught and described his methodology in a 1955 article in Sports Illustrated. \\"The Outlawed Spitball Was My Money Pitch\\" was published a year after he retired. Another famous user of the pitch was Gaylord Perry, who went so far as to title his autobiography Me and the Spitter and chronicled the clever ways in which he avoided detection. For example, Perry would put Vaseline on his zipper because umpires would never check a player's groin. Don Drysdale and Lew Burdette also used the pitch regularly. Mike Fiers has been accused of doctoring the baseball during both his no-hitters. Legal spits The name dry spitter is sometimes used to describe a pitch that moves like a spitball without saliva, such as the forkball or split-finger fastball. It is sometimes used simply as slang for the knuckleball. There is also the remote term of God-given spitter, which is when the ball is naturally dampened by moist air or light rainfall, which allows pitchers to be able to throw pitches with sharper breaks, much like a spitball. Comparison to cricket  The techniques used to prepare a spitball are analogous to the techniques still used to condition the ball in cricket. As was the case in pre-1920s baseball, usually a single cricket ball is used for a long period of time (almost 500 deliveries in international cricket), wherein the newer ball, because of its condition, swings naturally, losing the swing as it becomes more used. The fielding team progressively attempts to make one side of the ball more shiny than the other to create phenomena such as reverse swing, the aerodynamic opposite of conventional swing. Some techniques, such as physically polishing the ball against the player's clothing, or applying sweat and saliva, are entirely legal and are used widely; other techniques are illegal (known as ball tampering), including practices such as altering the ball's state by the use of artificial substances such as sun block or dirt, degradation by fingernails or other hard substances, intentionally returning the ball along the ground to abrade it, or picking the seam.

He began his service with the Umayyads under Caliph Abd al-Malik (), who successively promoted him as the head of the caliph's shurta (security forces), the governor of the Hejaz (western Arabia) in 692‚Äì694, and the practical viceroy of a unified Iraqi province and the eastern parts of the Caliphate in 694. Al-Hajjaj retained the last post under Abd al-Malik's son and successor al-Walid I (), whose decision-making was highly influenced by al-Hajjaj, until his death in 714. As governor of Iraq and the east, al-Hajjaj instituted key reforms. Among these were the minting of silver dirhams with strictly Muslim religious formulas instead of the coins' traditional, pre-Islamic Sasanian design; changing the language of the dƒ´wƒÅn (bureaucracy) of Iraq from Persian to Arabic; and the introduction of a uniform version of the Quran. To revive agricultural production and increase tax revenue, al-Hajjaj expelled non-Arab Muslim converts from the garrison cities of Kufa and Basra to their rural villages of origin and collected from them the jizya (poll tax) nominally reserved for non-Muslim subjects and oversaw large-scale canal digging projects. In 701, al-Hajjaj, with reinforcements from Syria, crushed a mass rebellion led by the Kufan Arab nobleman Ibn al-Ash'ath whose ranks spanned the Arab troops, Muslim converts and religious elites of Iraq. Consequently, al-Hajjaj further tightened control over the province, founding the city of Wasit to house the loyalist Syrian troops whom he thereafter relied on to enforce his rule. A highly capable though ruthless statesman, strict in character, a harsh and demanding master, al-Hajjaj was widely feared by his contemporaries and became a deeply controversial figure and an object of deep- seated enmity among later, pro-Abbasid writers, who ascribed to him persecutions and mass executions. Origin and early life and career Al- Hajjaj was born in ca. 661 in the city of Ta'if in the Hejaz. He belonged to the clan of Abu Aqil, called after al-Hajjaj's paternal great-grandfather. The clan was part of the Banu Awf branch of the Banu Thaqif tribe. Members of the Thaqif attained high military and administrative ranks in the nascent Caliphate and played important command and economic roles during and after the early Muslim conquests, particularly in Iraq. The tribe's political influence continued to grow with the advent of the Umayyad Caliphate in 661. Al-Hajjaj's ancestry was not particularly distinguished: the Abu Aqil family was poor and its members had worked as stone carriers and builders. His mother, al-Fari'a, had been married and divorced by al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba, a member of the Thaqif who was appointed governor of Kufa by the first Umayyad caliph, Mu'awiya I (). As a boy, al-Hajjaj acquired the nickname Kulayb (\\"little dog\\"), with which he was later derisively referred to. His early life is obscure, except for his having been a schoolmaster in his hometown‚Äîanother source of derision to his enemies‚Äîwhere he taught his pupils to copy and recite the Quran. His father Yusuf ibn al-Hakam and elder brother Muhammad were also teachers in Ta'if. After a short, undetermined period, al-Hajjaj and his father left their teaching jobs and took up military service under Caliph Yazid I (), who was facing increasing opposition to his rule in the Hejaz. He participated in the Second Muslim Civil War, fighting in the battles of al-Harra (682) and of al- Rabadha (684)‚Äîboth near Medina‚Äîbut without particular distinction. Al-Hajjaj fought in the brigade of Hubaysh ibn Dulja al-Qayni fled the field at al- Harra, where a Syrian army dispatched by Yazid defeated the local defenders of Medina who had discarded the Caliph's authority. According to verses recorded in the Kitab al-aghani, al-Hajjaj acknowledged: \\"I took to flight ... but later, I made good my fault by renewing the attack. For a sheikh takes to flight only once\\". He and his father were among the few to survive the battle at al-Rabadha, where the veteran Umayyad commander of the expedition Hubaysh ibn Dulja al-Qayni was slain fighting forces loyal to the Mecca-based anti- Umayyad caliph Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. Al-Hajjaj's first public post, as governor of Tabala in the Tihama region south of Ta'if, was unremarkable. Al- Hajjaj abandoned the post, considering it beneath his ambition. An Arabic proverb later developed out of this anecdote: ahwan  øala al-Hajjaj min Tabala (\\"as insignificant as Tabalah is to al-Hajjaj\\"). Soon after Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan () acceded to the caliphate, al-Hajjaj left his hometown and went to the Umayyad capital, Damascus, where he entered the security force (shurta) of the Caliph. The commander of the shurta, the Caliph's main adviser Rawh ibn Zinba al-Judhami, was impressed with al-Hajjaj's military capabilities and thinking. Upon Rawh's recommendation, Abd al-Malik appointed al-Hajjaj to enforce the Caliph's authority over a large army he mobilized for an expedition against the Zubayrid ruler of Iraq, Ibn al-Zubayr's brother Mu'sab, in 689/90. The Caliph was satisfied by the rapidity and efficiency with which al-Hajjaj restored discipline during a mutiny by the troops. During Abd al- Malik's siege of the rebel leader of the Qays tribes of Upper Mesopotamia, Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi, in al-Qariqisiya in the summer of 691, al- Hajjaj was sent as an emissary of the Caliph alongside the theologian Raja ibn Haywa to negotiate a reconciliation with Zufar. As a result of his success suppressing the Caliph's mutinous troops, Abd al-Malik entrusted al-Hajjaj with command of the army's rear-guard. He achieved further feats of valour, so that after the defeat of Mus'ab at the Battle of Maskin, Abd al-Malik entrusted him to subdue Ibn al-Zubayr in Mecca. In late 691 he set out from Kufa at the head of 2,000 Syrian troops. After taking over Ta'if unopposed, he halted there as Abd al-Malik had charged him to try to secure Ibn al-Zubayr's capitulation by diplomatic means if possible, and to avoid the shedding of blood in Mecca. Ibn al-Zubayr rejected the Umayyad offers, and al-Hajjaj, after receiving reinforcements and the Caliph's permission, moved to attack Mecca. The Umayyad troops bombarded the city with catapults from Mount Abu Qubays, not letting up even during the hajj; even the Ka'aba was not spared, despite the presence of the assembled pilgrims. When a sudden thunderstorm broke out, which his soldiers interpreted as divine wrath, he was able to rally them and convince them that it was actually a sign of victory. Finally, in October 692, after seven months of siege and the defection of several thousand of his supporters, including two of his sons, Ibn al-Zubayr was killed alongside his last remaining loyal followers, fighting around the Ka'aba. As a reward, Abd al-Malik gave al-Hajjaj the governorship of the Hijaz, Yemen, and al-Yamama. As governor, al-Hajjaj led the hajj in person in the years 73 and 74 AH (693 and 694 CE), and restored the Ka'aba to the shape and dimensions it had originally, rejecting the alterations made by Ibn al- Zubayr following the first Umayyad siege in 683. Al-Hajjaj was able to restore peace in the Hijaz, but his severity occasioned the frequent personal intervention of the Caliph. Governor of Iraq Map of Iraq (Lower Mesopotamia) in the late 9th century In early 694, Caliph Abd al-Malik sent al-Hajjaj to govern Iraq. This involved combining the governorships of Kufa and Basra, which had not been done since the days of Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan twenty years earlier. The caliph had previously appointed his brother Bishr ibn Marwan governor of Kufa, but when he died in early 694, this \\"experiment in family rule\\" (Hugh N. Kennedy) had clearly not been a success, and al- Hajjaj, whose ability and loyalty had been amply demonstrated, was appointed to this crucial post. The governorship of Iraq was indeed \\"the most important and responsible administrative post of the Islamic state\\" (A. Dietrich), as it comprised not only Iraq proper, but also included the lands conquered by troops from the two colony towns (misr) of Kufa and Basra, i.e. Persia, Khurasan and the other eastern provinces of the Caliphate. The governor of Iraq was therefore in charge of a huge super-province or vice-royalty stretching from Mesopotamia to the still expanding borders in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, comprising half of the Caliphate's territory and producing more than half its income. In addition, the post was of particular political sensitivity due to the long history of Kharijism and political dissent in Iraq, particularly in Kufa. This discontent was driven by various tribal, economic, and political factors. The population of Kufa contained people from almost all Arab tribes, but also many of those undesired elsewhere, such as the vanquished of the Ridda wars. Although it dominated the fertile lands of the Sawad, many of these were assigned by the Umayyads to princes of the dynasty, while the average Kufan was given land as a stipend for military service; but as the size of the stipend was determined by the earliness of conversion to Islam, many received only minuscule grants. Finally, the Kufans were largely left out of the spoils of conquest in the East; it was the Basrans who secured the lion's share, taking over far more extensive and richer territory like Khurasan or Sindh, while the Kufans were left with the mountains of Jibal and central Persia as their city's sole dependencies. Al-Hajjaj's purview originally excluded Khurasan and Sistan, which were governed by the largely ineffectual Umayyad prince Umayya ibn Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid, but in 697/8 he received these two provinces as well, expanding his rule over the entire eastern half of the Caliphate. He remained in this post until his death in 714, and throughout this period, encompassing the remainder of Abd al-Malik's reign and most of that of his successor al-Walid (r. 705‚Äì715), he would be \\"the dominant feature in the sources\\" (G. R. Hawting). Relations with the caliphs Sasanian-style dirham minted by al-Hajjaj in 695 Al-Hajjaj was, in the words of A. Dietrich, \\"the most loyal servant that a dynasty could wish for\\", and his loyalty was reciprocated by Abd al-Malik with his full trust. The relationship was further strengthened through family ties: al-Hajjaj's daughter wed Masrur, son of al- Walid I (), while the daughter of his brother Muhammad was wed to the future Yazid II (); the latter named his first-born son after al-Hajjaj, who in turn named three of his sons after members of the dynasty. Abd al-Malik named one of his sons al-Hajjaj, to whom the This close relationship is further evidenced by the many surviving letters exchanged between the two men. Al- Hajjaj's relationship with Abd al-Malik was much different than with the latter's successor, al-Walid, with whom the correspondence was restricted to their official functions. On the other hand, while Abd al-Malik was able to restrain his over-zealous governor whenever he was \\"extortionate in the raising of taxes, was too liberal with public resources, or was shedding more blood than was necessary\\" (A. Dietrich), al-Walid considered himself in al- Hajjaj's debt because he had championed the succession of al-Walid against Abd al-Malik's brother Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan, and the new Caliph allowed his powerful governor free rein and relied heavily on his counsel even in the appointment and dismissal of officials. If his meddling in the succession had secured him the favour of al-Walid, it had also caused the declared enmity of al-Walid's brother Sulayman (r. 715‚Äì717). Sulayman furthermore had championed the cause of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom al-Hajjaj had imprisoned. The possibility of Sulayman's accession so frightened al-Hajjaj that he wished not to outlive al-Walid. Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt and aftermath Arriving at Kufa, al-Hajjaj gave an inaugural sermon at the local mosque that has become famous and is \\"often cited as an example of Arab eloquence\\" (G. R. Hawting). The situation he found there was one of disorder. The troops of Basra and Kufa, ostensibly garrisoned at Ramhurmuz under al-Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra had instead, upon the death of Bishr, left the camp and were idling in the cities. In order to restore discipline, al-Hajjaj announced that any man who did not within three days return to the camp would be put to death and his property be left open to plunder. This proved effective, but when he went to the troops to distribute the pay, al-Hajjaj faced another mutiny under Ibn al-Jarud because of making cuts in pay that the troops refused to accept. These problems overcome, al-Hajjaj sent the troops against the Kharijites. In 696 al-Muhallab defeated the Azariqa who had rallied around Qatari ibn al-Fuja'a as their anti-caliph, and in spring 697 another Kharijite leader, Shabib ibn Yazid al- Shaybani, was defeated on the Dujayl river in Khuzistan with the aid of Syrian troops. In the same year, al-Hajjaj suppressed the rebellion of the governor of Mada'in, al-Mutarrif ibn al-Mughira ibn Shu'ba, who had allied with the Kharijites. These campaigns eradicated the Kharijite rebellion, but came at a cost to his relationship with the Iraqis: the campaigns against the Kharijites were extremely unpopular, and measures like the cuts in pay, according to Hugh N. Kennedy, \\"[seem] almost to have goaded the Iraqis into rebellion, as if looking for an excuse to break them\\". The explosion came in 699: when he had been conferred the governorships of Khurasan and Sistan, al-Hajjaj had given it to al-Muhallab, but in Sistan, the situation was far more unstable, and the country had to be essentially reconquered. An army under the local governor Ubayd Allah ibn Abi Bakra had suffered a heavy defeat against the ruler of the kingdom of Zabulistan, known as the Zunbil, and now al-Hajjaj ordered Abd al- Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath, the most pre-eminent member of the Kufan aristocracy (the ashrƒÅf) to lead an army against the Zunbil. This army was drawn from the Kufan soldiery, and such was the splendour of its equipment, or perhaps the \\"proud and haughty manner of the Kufan soldiers and ashrƒÅf who composed it\\" (G. R. Hawting), that it became known in history as the \\"Peacock Army\\". This expedition marked the beginning of a rebellion that came close to destroying not only al-Hajjaj's, but also Umayyad, power in Iraq. Ibn al- Ash'ath led his army to Sistan, and, as A. Dietrich writes, \\"at first carried out his campaign carefully and according to orders; he pacified each territory as it was conquered, ensured supplies and accustomed his troops gradually to the different climatic conditions\\". Al-Hajjaj, however, sent letter after letter to his commander, demanding an immediate assault against the Zunbil. The tone of these letters was extremely offensive, and he threatened to dismiss Ibn al-Ash'ath and appoint his own brother Ishaq to command the expedition instead. Al-Hajjaj's harsh tone and unreasonable demands, as well as the army's evident reluctance to continue such a protracted and arduous campaign so far from their homes, provoked a widespread mutiny, led by Ibn al- Ash'ath himself. The rebel army marched back to Iraq, growing to over 100,000 strong in the process as they were joined by other malcontents, and being transformed from a mutiny against al-Hajjaj‚Äîdenounced as an enemy of God and a latter-day Pharaoh‚Äîto a full-blown anti-Umayyad movement. Al-Hajjaj tried to stop the rebels at Tustar, but the rebels were victorious (early 701). Al- Hajjaj abandoned Basra to the rebels, and Ibn al-Ash'ath entered the city in triumph. Reinforced with Syrian troops, al-Hajjaj managed to score a minor victory, after which the bulk of the rebel army left Basra for their natural stronghold, Kufa. Al-Hajjaj recaptured Basra and pursued Ibn al-Ash'ath to Kufa, encamping near the city. Ibn al-Ash'ath's progress had sufficiently alarmed the Umayyad court that they sought a negotiated settlement, even though they kept sending Syrian reinforcements to al-Hajjaj. Abd al-Malik offered to dismiss al-Hajjaj, appoint Ibn al-Ash'ath as governor over one of the Iraqi towns, and raise the Iraqis' pay so that they received the same amount as the Syrians. Ibn al-Ash'ath was inclined to accept, but the more radical of his followers, especially the scholars known as qurrƒÅ æ, refused, believing that the offered terms revealed the government's weakness, and pushed for outright victory. The two armies eventually met in the Battle of Dayr al-Jamajim in April 701, which resulted in a crushing victory for al- Hajjaj and his more disciplined Syrians. Kufa surrendered after that, and al- Hajjaj further undercut Ibn al-Ash'ath's support by promising amnesty to those who surrendered, providing however that they acknowledged that their rebellion had been tantamount to renouncing Islam; those who refused were executed. The remnants of the rebel army fled to Basra, but were soon evicted and pursued by the Syrians to Khuzistan and Sistan. There Ibn al-Ash'ath sought refuge with the Zunbil, but was either assassinated by the latter or committed suicide to avoid being surrendered to al-Hajjaj. Most of his remaining followers tried to reach Herat, but were defeated by al-Muhallab's son, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, who surrendered those of north Arab provenance (Mudaris) but let the southern Arab (Yemeni) go. The failure of Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt led to the tightening of Umayyad control over Iraq. In 702 al-Hajjaj founded the city of Wasit, situated midway between Basra and Kufa, where he moved his seat. There he gathered all Syrian troops present in Iraq, ostensibly in order to rein in the Syrians and prevent excess at the expense of the populace, but in reality his aim was to isolate the Syrians from the locals and solidify their loyalty to him. Henceforth Iraq passed under virtual Syrian occupation, and the Iraqis, regardless of social status, were deprived of any real power in the governance of the region. Al-Hajjaj was now the undisputed master not only of Iraq, but of the entire Islamic East; only the governor of Khurasan, Yazid ibn al- Muhallab, retained some autonomy. Although Yazid was able to refuse several summons to Wasit, finally in 704 al-Hajjaj persuaded the Caliph to dismiss him, and Yazid was put in prison. Campaigns of expansion As governor of Iraq and viceroy of the East, al-Hajjaj supervised a major wave of expansion. He appointed Muhammad ibn al-Qasim al-Thaqafi to lead the conquest of northwestern India, Qutayba ibn Muslim to conquer Transoxiana, and Mujja'a ibn Si'r to Oman. Although al-Hajjaj himself undertook no campaign during these years, his role was essential: not only did he select the generals who carried out these campaigns, but also \\"prepared them very carefully, sparing no expense, since he calculated that with victory he would recover his expenses many times over\\" (A. Dietrich). The relationship between al-Hajjaj and Muhammad ibn Qasim has always been one of great debate. Many accounts list al- Hajjaj as being his uncle or father in law. According to the Chach Nama, the oldest chronicle of the Arab conquest of Sindh, the primary reason al-Hajjaj ordered an expedition against Raja Dahir, was the pirate raid off the coast of Debal, resulting in the capturing both gifts to the caliph from the King of Serendib (modern Sri Lanka) as well as the female pilgrims on board who were captured.Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg: The Chachnamah, An Ancient History of Sind, Giving the Hindu period down to the Arab Conquest. Commissioners Press 1900, Section 18 Upon hearing of the matter, al-Hajjaj wrote a letter to the Raja, and upon unsuccessful resolution being reached, launched a military attack. Other reasons attributed to al-Hajjaj's interest was in (1) gaining a foothold in the Makran, Balochistan and Sindh regions, (2) protecting the maritime interests of the caliphate, and (3) to punish the armies from Sindh for participating alongside the Persians in various battles such as those at Salasal, QƒÅdisiyyah and Nahawand and also the granting of refuge to fleeing rebel chieftains. Domestic government and reforms Silver dirham following Sasanian motives, struck in the name of al-Hajjaj Already in 695, al-Hajjaj began minting the new gold and silver coins, which superseded the Byzantine and Sasanian coins still used until then. He established mints at Kufa and later in Wasit and decreed strict punishments for counterfeiters. The new coins contained the name of Allah, and hence were initially opposed by many theologians who argued that they would also be used by infidels, but they quickly became a success and \\"helped to promote the circulation of money and the stabilization of economic conditions\\" (A. Dietrich). Al-Hajjaj also ordered the translation of the tax registers (diwƒÅn) into Arabic from the Persian in which it had hitherto been kept, so that he could supervise it personally. Following his victory over the Iraqis, al-Hajjaj began a series of reforms aimed at restoring tranquility and prosperity to the troubled state after almost twenty years of civil war and rebellions. He invested much effort in reviving agriculture, especially in the Sawad, and thereby increasing revenue through the kharƒÅj (land tax). He began to restore and expand the network of canals in lower Iraq. According to al-Baladhuri, he spared no expense to repair embankments when they broke, awarded uncultivated lands to deserving Arabs, and took measures to reverse the flow of the rural population to the cities, especially the new converts (mawƒÅlƒ´). According to the historian Ibn Abd al-Hakam (d. 871), al-Hajjaj, with the support of Abd al- Malik, was the first to collect the jizya (poll tax) from the mawƒÅlƒ´, though its imposition was nominally restricted to non-Muslim subjects of the Caliphate. thumb350px*Rasm (in black) was the only script found in the earliest surviving fragments of the Quran. *I øjƒÅm (examples in red) was added in later Arabic so that consonant letters could be distinguished. *Harakat (examples in blue) indicate short vowels which have been used in the Quran but not in most written Arabic. =Allegations of tampering with the Quran= As part of his efforts to strengthen uniformity in the state, he also tried to introduce a definitive, uniform version of the Quran so as to eliminate theological quarrels. Al-Hajjaj's version also probably included new vowel diacritics, and purged the text of any references hostile to the Umayyads. He declared this version to be the only valid one, while prohibiting the use of Ibn Mas'ud's qirƒÅ'a. The orientalist Arthur Jeffery claimed that al-Hajjaj made changes to the Quran, purging the text of any references hostile to the Umayyads and declaring his version to be the only valid one. Other authors however argue that it is difficult to assess any role had by al-Hajjaj, though they argue for plausibility of a widely known account that has him ordering Nasr ibn Asim to introduce new vowel diacritics, a story that is unchallenged, despite the strong hostility of Muslim sources towards al-Hajjaj. Jeffery argued that al-Hajjaj seemed \\"to have made an entirely new recension of the Qur'an\\", basing his argument on a Muslim source and two Christian sources. The Muslim source is a hadith report in Sunan Abu Dawood, which details eleven changes. Researcher Umar Ibn Ibrahim Radwan, argues that the changes could be categorised as differences in the qira'at. Doubting the authenticity of the hadith report, Radwan argues that the codex of Uthman, a caliph favored by al- Hajjaj, had already been memorised by thousands of Muslims and that the Abbasid dynasty, which was known for polemically showcasing the negative aspects of Ummayad rule, would have taken the opportunity to show that the Umayyads had corrupted the Quran. One of the Christian sources was a letter reported by Levond to have been written by the Byzantine emperor Leo III addressed to Caliph Umar II. Jeffrey notes the authenticity of the letter is disputed by historian, including John Wansbrough, who denied that Levond had reported it. Neal Robinson argues that even if the letter was authentic, the activity of al-Hajjaj would have been limited to destroying sectarian writings and early codices which preserved the suras (Quranic chapters) in a different order. The other Christian source is an apologetic letter attributed to Abd al-Masih al-Kindi. The dating of the letter is disputed, the Arabist Paul Kraus concluding that its composition dated to the beginning of the 10th century. Moreover, other authors have rejected that the letter had any factual basis, arguing that it was a polemical work. According to the Islamic historical tradition, in , al-Hajjaj improved written Arabic by adding diacritical marks to the bare rasm of early \\"defective\\" Arabic so that consonants such as these five letters ŸÄÿ®ŸÄ ŸÄÿ™ŸÄ ŸÄÿ´ŸÄ ŸÄŸÜŸÄ ŸÄŸäŸÄ (y, n, th, t, b) could be distinguished from one another. However, some historians believe these language reforms occurred earlier in Syria or Iraq before the advent of Islam. Death and legacy Al-Hajjaj died in Wasit in May or June 714 at the age of 53 or 54. On his deathbed, he appointed his son Abd Allah to replace him as leader of the Friday prayers. He penned a letter to al-Walid, which concluded as follows: > When I meet God and find favour with Him, therein shall be the joy of my > soul. The eternity of God sufficeth me, and I therefore place not my hopes > on mortals. Those who were before us have tasted of death, and after them we > also shall taste it. The cause of his death, according to the medieval historian Ibn Khallikan (d. 1282), was a stomach cancer. The following year, al-Walid died as well, and his brother Sulayman came to power. As the heir apparent, Sulayman had allied with many of al-Hajjaj's opponents, particularly Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom he appointed governor of Iraq shortly after his accession. Possibly having been convinced by such allies that al-Hajjaj had provoked hatred among the Iraqis toward the Umayyads as opposed to fostering their loyalty, the caliph deposed the late viceroy's appointees and allies in the province and throughout the eastern Caliphate. This was likely due to their connection with al-Hajjaj personally. Among those who fell from grace was al-Hajjaj's kinsman, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, who was dismissed from his governorship of Sindh and executed in Wasit. In the assessment of historian Julius Wellhausen, al-Hajjaj was \\"harsh and at times hard, but not cruel; neither was he petty or bigoted\\". Though he was criticized in the early Muslim sources for his bombardment of Mecca and the Ka'aba during his siege of Ibn al-Zubayr, \\"other shameful deeds\\" al-Hajjaj was held responsible for are the \\"inventions and fabrications of the hatred of his enemies\\". Among these was a charge by an anonymous source recorded by al-Tabari that al-Hajjaj massacred between 11,000 and 130,000 men in Basra following his suppression of Ibn al-Ash'ath's revolt, in contrast to the older traditional Muslim sources, which held that al-Hajjaj granted a general pardon in Kufa and Basra after his victory for rebels who renounced Ibn al-Ash'ath. Family Al-Hajjaj's first wife was Umm Aban, a daughter of Nu'man ibn Bashir al-Ansari, an aide of Caliph Mu'awiya and onetime governor of Kufa. Before being appointed governor of Iraq, he was also wed to another daughter of Nu'man, Hamida, after she had been divorced by Abd al-Malik's chief adviser, Rawh ibn Zinba; al-Hajjaj divorced Hamida during his governorship in Iraq. During his governorship of Medina, al-Hajjaj married Umm al-Julas, a daughter of Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid, a member of the Umayyad dynasty. This followed his divorce of Umm Kulthum bint Abd Allah ibn Ja'far, a grandniece of Caliph Ali (). While al-Mas'udi holds al-Hajjaj divorced Umm Kulthum to humiliate the family of Abu Talib (the father of Ali), accounts recorded in the Kitab al-Aghani and by Ibn Abd Rabbihi and Ibn al-Athir hold that Abd al-Malik ordered al-Hajjaj to divorce her and return her dowry after petitions by her father and the Umayyad prince Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mu'awiya; the modern historian Shiv Rai Chowdhry argues the latter account is more credible. During his rule in Iraq, al-Hajjaj married Hind, a daughter of al- Muhallab, but according to the historian al-Tabari, divorced her in 708/09 because she cried audibly at the torture of her brother Yazid in al-Hajjaj's prison. With his marriage to Umm Banin bint al-Mughira ibn Abd al-Rahman, a great-granddaughter of al-Harith ibn Hisham, al-Hajjaj became one of the few non-Qurayshites to marry into the prominent Banu Makhzum clan; two of his sons also married into the clan. According to the historian Ibn Hazm (d. 1064), al- Hajjaj had four sons: his eldest Muhammad, and Abd al-Malik, Aban and Sulayman (or al-Walid). The latter three were named after members of the Umayyad dynasty. Al-Tabari mentions a son named Abd Allah. Muhammad died during al- Hajjaj's lifetime and his descendants were recorded living in Damascus as late as the 9th century. Abd al-Malik also had descendants recorded living in the 9th century, in Basra, while Aban and Sulayman (or al-Walid) died without progeny.

Marwari is also found in the neighbouring state of Gujarat and Haryana, Eastern Pakistan and some migrant communities in Nepal. With some 7.8 million or so speakers (ce. 2011), it is one of the largest varieties of Rajasthani. Most speakers live in Rajasthan, with a quarter million in Sindh and a tenth that number in Nepal. There are two dozen dialects of Marwari. Marwari is popularly written in Devanagari script, as is Hindi, Marathi, Nepali and Sanskrit; although it was historically written in Mahajani, it is still written in the Perso-Arabic script by the Marwari minority in Eastern Pakistan (the standard/western Naskh script variant is used in Sindh Province, and the eastern Nastalik variant is used in Punjab Province), where it has educational status but where it is rapidly shifting to Urdu. Marwari has no official status in India and is not used as a language of education. Marwari is still spoken widely in and around Bikaner and Jodhpur.  History  It is believed that Marwari and Gujarati evolved from Gujjar Bhakha or Maru-Gurjar, language of the Gurjars. Formal grammar of Gurjar Apabhra·πÉ≈õa was written by Jain monk and eminent Gujarati scholar Hemachandra Suri.  Geographical distribution  Marwari is primarily spoken in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Marwari speakers have dispersed widely throughout India and other countries but are found most notably in the neighbouring state of Gujarat and in Eastern Pakistan. Speakers are also found in Bhopal. With around 7.9 million speakers in India according to the 2001 census. There are several dialects: Tha·∏∑ƒ´ (spoken in eastern Jaisalmer district and northwestern Jodhpur district), BƒÅg·πõƒ´ (near Haryana), Bhitrauti, Sirohƒ´, GodwƒÅrƒ´.  Lexis  Indian Marwari [rwr] in Rajasthan shares a 50%‚Äì65% lexical similarity with Hindi (this is based on a Swadesh 210 word list comparison). It has many cognate words with Hindi. Notable phonetic correspondences include /s/ in Hindi with /h/ in Marwari. For example, /sona/ 'gold' (Hindi) and /hono/ 'gold' (Marwari). Pakistani Marwari [mve] shares 87% lexical similarity between its Southern subdialects in Sindh (Utradi, Jaxorati, and Larecha) and Northern subdialects in Punjab (Uganyo, Bhattipo, and Khadali), 79%‚Äì83% with Dhakti [mki], and 78% with Meghwar and Bhat Marwari dialects. Mutual intelligibility of Pakistani Marwari [mve] with Indian Marwari [rwr] is decreasing due to the rapid shift of active speakers in Pakistan to Urdu, their use of the Arabic script and different sources of support medias, and their separation from Indian Marwaris, even if there are some educational efforts to keep it active (but absence of official recognition by Pakistani or provincial government level). Many words have been borrowed from other Pakistani languages. Merwari [wry] shares 82%‚Äì97% intelligibility of Pakistani Marwari [mve], with 60%‚Äì73% lexical similarity between Merwari varieties in Ajmer and Nagaur districts, but only 58%‚Äì80% with Shekhawati [swv], 49%‚Äì74% with Indian Marwari [rwr], 44%‚Äì70% with Godwari [gdx], 54%‚Äì72% with Mewari [mtr], 62%‚Äì70% with Dhundari [dhd], 57%‚Äì67% with Haroti [hoj]. Unlike Pakistani Marwari [mve], the use of Merwari remains vigorous, even if its most educated speakers also proficiently speak Hindi [hin]. Phonology /h/ sometimes elides. There are also a variety of vowel changes. Most of the pronouns and interrogatives are, however, distinct from those of Hindi.  Morphology  Marwari languages have a structure that is quite similar to Hindustani (Hindi or Urdu). Their primary word order is subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb Most of the pronouns and interrogatives used in Marwari are distinct from those used in Hindi; at least Marwari proper and Harauti have a clusivity distinction in their plural pronouns.  Vocabulary  Marwari vocabulary is somewhat similar to other Western Indo-Aryan languages, especially Rajasthani and Gujarati, however, elements of grammar and basic terminology differ enough to significantly impede mutual intelligibility. In addition, Marwari uses many words found in Sanskrit (the ancestor of most North Indian languages) which are not found in Hindi.  Writing system  Marwari is generally written in the Devanagari script, although the Mahajani script is traditionally associated with the language. In Pakistan it is written in the Perso-Arabic script with modifications. Historical Marwari orthography for Devanagari uses other characters in place of standard Devanagari letters.Pandey, Anshuman. 2010.

The 2016 census population was 21,722 for Balbriggan and its environs.  Etymology  According to P.W. Joyce, the name arises from Baile Breacain [sic], which literally means \\"Brecan's Town\\".P.W. Joyce, Irish local names explained (Dublin 1923). Brecan is a common medieval first name and there are several other Brackenstowns in Ireland. There is also a possible link to the local Bracken River, in which case the name could derive from breic√≠n, meaning \\"little trout\\". Many locals however have traditionally felt that Baile Brig√≠n means \\"Town of the Little Hills\\", due to the relatively low hills that surround the town. The town's name could be derived from the word brecan, as the area was part of a Medieval kingdom known as Brega, populated by a tribe or clan known as the Bregii, and the aforementioned River Bracken.  History  There is no consensus about when the foundation of the town occurred, other than there may always have been a small settlement of fishermen, weavers and some sort of agricultural trade post.  18th century  An 18th century traveller described Balbriggan as \\"... a small village situated in a small glin [glen] where the sea forms a little harbour ‚Äì it is reckoned safe and is sheltered by a good pier. The village is resorted to in Summer time by several genteel people for the benefit of bathing.\\" Balbriggan rose from a small fishing village to a place of manufacturing and commercial importance in part due to local landowner and judge George Hamilton, Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland), who, in 1780, established factories to aid in the manufacturing of cotton.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 London John Murray 1926p.164 He also improved the harbour by building the pier, which was completed in 1763.Ball p.164  19th century  St. Georges Church tower, 1813 Lewis's Topographical Directory of Ireland, from 1837, refers to Balbriggan as follows: > A seaport, market and post village and a chapelry, in the parish and barony > of Balrothery, county of Dublin, and province of Leinster, 15 miles (N. by > E.) from Dublin; containing 3,016 inhabitants. > The inhabitants are partly employed in the fishery, but principally in the > manufacture of cotton; there are two large factories, the machinery of which > is worked by steam-engines and water-wheels of the aggregate power of 84 > horses, giving motion to 7,500 spindles, and spinning upon the average about > . of cotton yarn per week.

Balbriggan Beach with Martello tower in the background  Historical events  Medieval battle = According to Ware, a medieval annalist, a battle took place at Balbriggan on Whitsun-eve, 1329, between the combined forces of John de Bermingham, Earl of Louth (who had been elevated to the 'palatine dignity' of the county) and Richard, Lord of Malahide, and several of their kinsmen, and the forces of local rival families, the Verduns, Gernons and Savages, who were opposed to the elevation of the earl. In this event, the former, with 60 of their English followers, were killed. = William III = William III camped here after the Battle of the Boyne, in July 1690. = Milling = Balbriggan was the location of the 19th century Smith's Stocking Mill, which made stockings as well as men's \\"Long-Johns\\" called Balbriggans. These are often mentioned in John Wayne films ‚Äì 'he put his balbriggans on' ‚Äì and both Queen Victoria and the Czarina of Russia also wore \\"Balbriggans\\". Balbriggan's strong textile connections also include the linen & cotton manufacturing of Charles Gallen & Company, who in 1870, purchased the existing weaving mill and associated facilities built by Baron Hamilton. The firm became famous as the finest linen weavers in Ireland and had custom all over the world. They were also suppliers of linens to the Vatican, Embassies of Ireland and the US, and fine hotels worldwide. The business continues today from another location as the old mill in the town centre has been redeveloped. = Sack of Balbriggan = The assault on the village's population by the British Black and Tans based in the nearby Gormanston military barracks on 20 September 1920 was one of the more infamous acts of the Irish War of Independence. This event, known as the \\"Sack of Balbriggan\\", resulted in the destruction of 54 houses and a hosiery factory, and the looting of four public houses. The attack received much international attention due to Balbriggan's position close to foreign news correspondents in Dublin. A subsequent delegation from the United States pledged to rebuild thirty homes in the village and a local factory. Other deaths followed during the war, most noticeably those of S√©amus Lawless and Sean Gibbons who were bayoneted to death by the British forces on 21 September 1920. A plaque on Bridge Street in the town commemorates their murder. = Wavin = Wavin has been manufacturing plastic pipes, contributing to the provision of running water in many Irish rural homes, in their purpose-built facility since 1962.  Location and access  Martello tower at Balbriggan Balbriggan is 32 km north of Dublin city, in the northern part of the traditional County Dublin. It lies on the Belfast‚ÄìDublin main line of the Irish rail network. Commuter rail services serve Balbriggan railway station, which opened on 25 May 1844 and closed for goods traffic on 2 December 1974. It is estimated that about 2,200 commuters use the station every working day. The town is also located next to the M1 motorway (the section known as the Balbriggan Bypass), which was completed in 1998. Prior to this, the main Dublin-Belfast road went through the centre of the town, with major traffic congestion on a daily basis. Bus service is provided by Dublin Bus routes 33, 33A (taken over by Go-Ahead Ireland on 2 December 2018) and 33X as well as Bus √âireann routes 101 (Dublin- Drogheda) and 104 (Balbriggan Town service). It is the most northerly town in Fingal (although the village of Balscadden lies further north within the county), and is situated close to Bettystown, Laytown (County Meath) and Drogheda (County Louth). Balbriggan experienced a population boom in the early part of the 2000s as a result of the large demand for housing within the wider Dublin region. The population has increased as a result, with hundreds of new homes being built.  Geography  The River Bracken, also known as the Matt River, which flows through the town, once formed a lake known locally at \\"the Canal\\" or \\"Head\\"(of water). The water was sluiced through a canal and tunnels down to the Lower Mill where it turned a waterwheel to drive the cotton manufacturing machinery. The retaining wall of the reservoir collapsed in the 1960s and the area was reclaimed through land-fill in the early 1980s to create a public park. On the northern edge of the town, the small Bremore River comes to the sea just beyond the Martello Tower.  Amenities  The town is coastal and has a sandy beach. It was at one time a holiday destination for people from Dublin city. Balbriggan is also the location of a Sunshine Home which aims to provide a holiday to underprivileged children from the Greater Dublin area. The home is operated by the Sunshine Fund, a unique branch of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul which provides week-long summer breaks for children aged 7 to 11 from disadvantaged parts of Dublin, Meath, Wicklow and Kildare. The purpose-built home has hosted these holidays since 1935, with over 100,000 young people having passed through their doors.  Economy  Balbriggan ‚Äì beach The Department of Foreign Affairs has located a passport production facility in Balbriggan. There is also a proposal to relocate the Drogheda International Seaport to the Bremore Port area to the north of the town. Local development bodies expect that the proposed Bremore Port and orbital motorway projects as well as the existing M1 motorway and Belfast ‚Äì Dublin railway are major draws to prospective companies with large logistical sectors hoping to expand or set up in the Fingal area. Balbriggan Town Hall served as home to Balbriggan Town Council until the council's dissolution in 2014.

Mu‚Äôayyad Nizami a native of Ganja in Azarbaijan, is an unrivaled master of thoughts and words, a poet whose freshness and vigor all the succeeding centuries have been unable to dull. Little is known of his life, the only source being his own works, which in many cases provided no reliable information. We can only deduce that he was born between 535 and 540 (1140‚Äì46) and that his background was urban. Modern Azarbaijan is exceedingly proud of its world famous son and insists that he was not just a native of the region, but that he came from its own Turkic stock. At all events his mother was of Iranian origin, the poet himself calling her Ra‚Äôisa and describing her as Kurdish. background in Ganja (Seljuq empire, now Azerbaijan) and is believed to have spent his whole life in South Caucasus. According to De Blois, Ganja was a city which at that time had predominantly an Iranian population.

Tazkerehs, which are the compilations of literary memoirs that include maxims of the great poets along with biographical information and commentary of styles refer to him briefly. Much of this material in these Tazkerehs are based on legends, anecdotes, and hearsays. Consequently, few facts are known about Nezami's life, the only source being his own work, which does not provide much information on his personal life.

The verse (quoted on p. 14): \\"I am lost as a pearl in the sea of Ganja, yet I am from the Qohestan of the city of Qom \\", does not expressly mean that he was born in Qom.

Excerpt: \\"In the Shahnama, Firdawsi already makes Iskandar an exemplary figure, whom the companionship of Aristotle helps to rise still higher, by the path of wisdom and moderation, in the direction of abstinence and contempt for this world. And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of DƒÅrƒÅ (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by \\"the rotation of the Heavens\\"....At the time of Ni·∫ìami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Ni·∫ìami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, \\"I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole\\"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran. D Family Nezami was married three times. His first wife was a Kipchak slave girl which was sent to him by Fakhr al-Din Bahramshah, the ruler of Darband, as part of a larger gift. According to Iraj Bashiri she became Nezami's \\"most beloved\\" wife. His only son Mohammad was from this wife. She died after \\"Khosrow and Shirin\\" was completed. Mohammad was seven at the time. Nezami mentions his son again in Layli and Majnun adding that now this son is 14 years old and \\"apple of my eyes\\". In \\"Haft Peykar\\" (Seven Beauties), he also mentions and advises his son about taking more responsibility as the father was growing more frail. Some modern writers in the late 20th century have claimed that this wife was called Afaq. Vahid Dastgerdi seems to be the first writer to propose this name for Nezami's first wife, but Said Nafisi (at the same time) and a recent source have challenged this interpretation of the corresponding verse in Nezami's work and the assumption that Afaq was the real name of his wife and have taken the Afaq in that verse to simply mean \\"horizon\\" rather than a proper name. Strangely enough, Nezami's two other wives, too, died prematurely ‚Äì the death of each coinciding with the completion of an epic, prompting the poet to say, \\"God, why is it that for every mathnavi I must sacrifice a wife!\\".Iraj Bashiri,\\"The Teahouse at a Glance\\" ‚Äì Nizami's Life and Works , 2000 Education Nezami was not a philosopherSeyyed Hossein Nasr, Mehdi Amin Razavi, \\"The Islamic intellectual tradition in Persia\\", RoutledgeCurzon; annotated edition (July 4, 1996). pp. 178‚Äì187 in the sense of Avicenna or an expositor of theoretical Sufism in the sense of Ibn 'Arabi. However, he is regarded as a philosopher and gnostic who mastered various fields of Islamic thoughts which he synthesized in a way that brings to mind the traditions of later Hakims such as Qutb al-Din Shirazi. Often referred to by the honorific Hakim (\\"the Sage\\"), Nezami is both a learned poet and master of a lyrical and sensuous style. About Nezami's prodigious learning there is no doubt. Poets were expected to be well versed in many subjects; but Nezami seems to have been exceptionally so. His poems show that not only he was fully acquainted with Arabic and Persian literatures and with oral and written popular and local traditions, but was also familiar with such diverse fields as mathematics, astronomy, astrology, alchemy, medicine, botany, Koranic exegesis, Islamic theory and law, Iranian myths and legends,Maria Sutenly, \\"Visionary Rose: Metaphorical Application of Horticultural Practice in Persian Culture\\" in Michel Conan and W.

Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled\\" cultural heritage unite pre-Islamic and Islamic Iran into the creation of a new standard of literary achievement.

Collection of Freer Gallery of Art The recent discovery and publication of the anthology titled Nozhat al-Majales contains Persian language quatrains from Nizami and 115 other poets from the northwestern Iran (ArrƒÅn, ≈†arvƒÅn, Azerbaijan; including 24 poets from Ganja alone) during the same era. Unlike other parts of Persia, where the poets mostly belonged to higher echelons of society such as scholars, bureaucrats, and secretaries, a good number of poets in the northwestern areas rose from among the common people with working-class backgrounds, and they frequently used colloquial expressions in their poetry. Accordingly, the book demonstrates the social conditions at the time, reflecting the full spread of Persian language and the culture in the region, which is evidenced by the common use of spoken idioms in poems and the professions of many of the poets. The influence of the northwestern Pahlavi language, for example, which had been the spoken dialect of the region, is clearly observed in the poems contained in this anthology. However, at the same time, the Caucasus region was entertaining a unique mixture of ethnic cultures. Khaqani's mother was a Nestorian Christian, Mojir Baylqani's mother was an Armenian, and Nezami's mother was a Kurd. Their works reflect the cultural and linguistic diversity of the region. By the end of the 10th century, Persian literature became widespread from the eastern Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus. The earliest extant example of Persian poetry from the area is that of Qatran Tabrizi(1009‚Äì1072) who served in the courts of the Shaddadid and Rawadid dynasties. Qatran Tabrizi, is credited with what some scholars in the last century have termed as the founder of the \\"Azerbaijan\\" or \\"Trans-Cacausian\\" schoolRypka, Jan. \\"Poets and Prose Writers of the Late Saljuq and Mongol Periods\\", The Cambridge History of Iran, Volume 5, The Saljuq and Mongol Periods, ed., Published January 1968.

It is also possible to speak of a certain similarity of inspiration and of style between the poets born and educated in these areas, to the point of defining them as belonging to the ‚ÄòAzerbaijan school‚Äô (Rypka, Hist. Iran Lit., pp. 201‚Äì9). The complexity of the language and of the compositional techniques, the originality and multiplicity of the themes, the presence of Persian archaisms and, at the same time, a wide range of borrowings from Arabic vocabulary are among the stylistic features which are common to poets in this cultural context compared with other contemporaries closer to the Khorasani style.‚Äù archaism while borrowing from Arabic vocabulary, as well as new concepts. Other sources including the Encyclopaedia of Islam and traditional Iranian literary sources have used the term \\"'Iraqi\\" style for the Persian poetry of Nezami.De Bruijn, J.T.P. (1997), ‚ÄúIran: Literature‚Äù, Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Ed., vol. IV:52‚Äì75. excerpt: \\"‚ÄúOn the other hand he enriched the romantic mathnawi by using imagery of lyric poetry to the full, treating it with all the rhetorical ingenuity characteristic of the 'Iraqi style‚Äù\\" Atabeg of Azerbaijan Qizil Arslan welcomes Nizami The Seljuqs took control of Ganja from the Shaddadids in 1075 and spread Persian literary westwards to their courts. In the middle of the 12th century, the Seljuks control of the region weakened and their provincial governors, virtually autonomous local princes, further encouraged Persian culture, art and poetry in their courts. Persian culture characteristically flourished in this era when political power was diffused and Persian remained the primary language, Persian civil cervants, merchants were in great demand and rival dynastines continue to vie for the service of Persian poets. This was especially true in Ganjeh, the Caucasian outpost town where Nizami lived. Nezami was patronized by different rulers and dedicated his epics to various rival dynasties including the Seljuqs, Eldiguzids(who maintained control of Ganja during most of the later 12th century), Shirvanshahs, the ruler of Ahar and Ahmadilis. Although he enjoyed the patronage of various rulers and princes, he avoided the court life and is generally believed to have lived a secluded life. Since he was not a court poet, he does not appear in the annals of the dynasties which list the names of events of the ruling families. According to Professor Chelkowski: It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading Firdawsi's monumental epic Shahnameh (The book of Kings).(Chelkowski, P. \\"Nezami's Iskandarnameh:\\" in Colloquio sul poeta persiano Nizami e la leggenda iranica di Alessandro magno, Roma, 1977). p. 10: \\"The Persian legend of Alexander the Great seems to overshadow all of the other fantastic Alexander stories not only in the tale of the successful accomplishment of many a \\"mission-impossible\\" but especially concerning the nature of his career. In Iran he rose from the stature of a damned evil conqueror of the country, to that of a national Iranian hero king, and even more, to that of the great prophet of God, preparing all the nations for the true religion. Yet the Persian legend of Alexander is very little known in the Western world.\\" p. 13: \\"Nizami was a typical product of the Iranian culture. He created a bridge between Islamic Iran and pre-Islamic Iran and also between Iran and the whole ancient world. His great humanism, strong character, sensibility, drama, colorful description of nature, rich language, and the poetic genius created a new standard of literary achievements and captured the imagination of countless imitators\\". p. 17: \\"In the case of previous romances of Khosraw and Bahram, Nizami dealt with national Iranian heroes, though from pre-Islamic times. In the tale of Layla and Majnun, the Arab nationality of the lover is of no importance since the story is based on a simple Arab folktale which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians\\". p. 19: \\"Alexander was glorified by the Muslims as a divine agent, a prophet-king and the blessed conqueror of the lands that were to become the stronghold of Islam. To some Muslims, Islam was a realization of Alexander's \\"koine\\" --- a commonwealth where people could live in harmony and in peace of heart and mind. In this atmosphere attempts were made to make out of Alexander not only a Muslim but a Persian as well\\". p. 21: \\"However, it was not Tabari directly, but Ferdowsi who was Nizami's source of inspiration and material in composing Iskandarnameh. Nizami constantly alludes to the Shahnameh in his writing, especially in the prologue to the Iskandarnameh. It seems that he was always fascinated by the work of Firdawsi and made it a goal of his life to write an heroic epic of the same stature. p. 22: \\"It seems that Nezami's favorite pastime was reading Firdawsi's monumental epic Shahnameh (The book of Kings)\\". p. 22: \\"In fact, although Alexander conquered Iran, he was soon conquered by Persian customs and ways of life. In many aspects he was so overwhelmed by Persian civilization that he became more Persian than the Persians. He tried to make a blend of the Greek and Persian civilization --- even genetically, when he sponsored mass marriages between his troops and Persian women. He himself married Roxane (Rowshanak) the daughter of the Sogdian prince ‚Äì not the daughter of Darius the Third, as both Firdawsi and Nizami believed. Like Alexander, Arabs, Turks, Mongols and other people who overran the Iranian plateau also came under the spell of Persian culture. Foreign invaders remained to become contributors and patrons of Persian art and culture. To give one example, some of Nizami's benefactors were of Turkic stock.\\" Nezami has mentioned Ferdowsi as the Sage (Hakim) and Knower/Wise (daanaa) and the great master of discourse: who has decorated words like new bride. Nezami advises the son of the Shirvanshah to read the Shah-nama and to remember the meaningful sayings of the wise.Dr. Ali Asghar Seyed Gohrab. \\"Layli and Majnun: Love, Madness and Mystic Longing\\", Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun 2003. p. 276. Nezami has used the Shahnameh as a source in his three epics of \\"Haft Peykar\\", \\"Khosrow and Shirin\\" and \\"Eskandar-Nameh\\". The story of Vis and Ramin also had an immense influence on Nezami. Although Nezami takes the bases for most of his plots from Ferdowsi, but the basis for his rhetoric comes from Gorgani. This is especially noticeable in the Khosrow and Shirin, which is of the same meter and imitates some scenes from Vis and Ramin. Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in Vis and Ramin. Nezami had a paramount influence on the romantic tradition, and Gorgani can be said to have initiated much of the distinctive rhetoric and poetic atmosphere of this tradition, with the absence of the Sufi influences, which are seen in Nezami's epic poetry. The first monumental work of Nezami, the Makhzan al-Asrar is influenced by Sanai's \\"Hadikat al-Hakika\\". > The ·∏§adiqat al-·∏•aqiqa is not only one of the first of a long line of Persian > didactical ma·πØnawis, it is also one of the most popular works of its kind as > the great number of copies made throughout the centuries attest.

The princesses and their pavilions are manifestations of specific planets, specific climes, colours, and days. The pavilions are domed, representing the structure of the heavens. Nizami illustrates the harmony of the universe, the affinity of the sacred and the profane, and the concordance of ancient and Islamic Iran.\\" (Nizami Ganjavi in Encyclopedia of Islam, Chelkowski).\\" Nezami acknowledges this but considers his work to be superior. The main similarities between Sanai's poem and Nezami's are in its ethico- philosophical genre, although Nezami uses a different metre and organized the whole work in a different fashion. Khaqani Sherwani daring imagery, was to have a momentous influence on Nezami Ganjavi and through the latter on Persian poetry in general. Works Nezami lived in an age of both political instability and intense intellectual activity, which his poems reflect; but little is known about his life, his relations with his patrons, or the precise dates of his works, as the many legends built up around the poet color the accounts of his later biographers. He dedicated his poems to various rulers of the region as was custom of that time for great poets, but avoided court life. Nezami was a master of the Masnavi style (double-rhymed verses). The Khamsa or Panj Ganj Nizami's main poetical work, for which he is best known, is a set of five long narrative poems known as the Khamsa (, 'Quintet or Quinary') or Panj Ganj (, 'Five Treasures'): * Makhzan-ol-Asr√¢r (, 'The Treasury or Storehouse of Mysteries'CHARLES-HENRI DE FOUCH√âCOUR, \\"IRAN:Classical Persian Literature\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Iranica), 1163 (some date it 1176) * Khosrow o Shirin (, 'Khosrow and Shirin'), 1177‚Äì1180 * Leyli o Majnun (, 'Layla and Majnun'), 1192 * Eskandar-N√¢meh (, 'The Book of Alexander'), 1194 or 1196‚Äì1202 * Haft Peykar (, 'The Seven Beauties'), 1197 The first of these poems, Makhzan-ol-Asr√¢r, was influenced by Sanai's (d. 1131) monumental Garden of Truth. The four other poems are medieval romances. Khosrow and Shirin, Bahram-e Gur, and Alexander the Great, who all have episodes devoted to them in Ferdowsi's Shahnameh, appear again here at the center of three of four of Nezami's narrative poems. The adventure of the paired lovers, Layla and Majnun, is the subject of the second of his four romances, and derived from Arabic sources. In all these cases, Nezami reworked the material from his sources in a substantial way. The Khamsa was a popular subject for lavish manuscripts illustrated with painted miniatures at the Persian and Mughal courts in later centuries. Examples include the Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208), created for the Mughal Emperor Akbar in the 1590s.

The story deals with such esoteric subjects as philosophy and theology. The story contains twenty discourses, each of them portraying an exemplary story on religious and ethical topics. Each chapter concludes with apostrophe to the poet himself containing his pen name.JTP de Bruijn. Persian Sufi Poetry, An Introduction to the Mystical ‚Äì Taylor and Francis (Routledge) 1997 pp. 97‚Äì98 The content of the poems are indicated in the heading to each chapter and are written in a typical Homiletics style. The stories which discuss spiritual and practical concerns enjoin kingly justice, riddance of hypocrisy, warning of vanity of this world and the need to prepare for the after-life. The general message of the discourse is that Nezami preaches the ideal way of life drawing attention to his reader of the supreme rank man among God's creatures and approaching of the end life and the necessity of man becoming aware of his spiritual destination. In a few chapters he address the duties of a King, but as a whole he addresses himself to mankind in general rather than his royal patrons. In the introduction, the poet provides an account of his solitary vigils, called Khalwat. There is no indication that these were Sufi vigils, but are used as a literally fantasy on the duty of spiritually inclined poet he wanted to be. In highly rhetorical style, the aim he pursues is to transcend the limitation of secular literature of the courts. With this work, Nezami joins the destination of Persian poetry which had started with Sanai and was continued by others, in the first place by Attar. Not a romantic epic, \\"The Treasury of Mysteries\\" was translated into English by Gholam H. Darab in 1945.Darab, Gholam Hossein. Treasury of Mysteries, translation of Makhzanol Asrar. (London:. Arthur Probsthain, 1945). After this early work, Nezami turned into narrative poetry. =Khosrow o Shirin= Khusrau stand on either side of the canal built to supply Shirin with the milk of goats and cows, taken from the Khamsa of Nizami A story of pre-Islamic Persian origin which is found in the great epico- historical poems of Shahnameh and is based on a true story that was further romanticized by Persian poets. The story chosen by Nezami, was commissioned and dedicated to the Seljuk Sultan Toghril II, the Atabek Muhammad ibn Eldiguz Jahan Pahlavan and his brother Qizil Arslan. It contains about 6,500 distichs in length, the story depicts the love of Sassanian Khosrow II Parviz towards his Armenian princess Shirin. \\"Khusrow and Shirin\\" recounts the story of King Khosrow's courtship of Princess Shirin, and vanquishing of his love-rival, Farhad. The story has a complex structure with several genres exploited simultaneously; and contains many verbal exchanges and letters, all imbued with lyrical intensity. Khosrow endures long journeys, physical and spiritual, before returning to Shirin, his true love. They are eventually married, but eventually Khosrow is killed by his son and Shirin commits suicide over the body of her murdered husband. Pure and selfless love is represented here embodied in the figure of Farhad, secretly in love with Shirin, who finally falls victim to the king's ire and jealousy. The influence of Vis o Ramin is visible as the poem imitates a major scene (that of the lovers arguing in the snow) from Vis o RƒÅmin, as well as being in the same meter (hazaj) as GorgƒÅni's poem. Nezami's concern with astrology also has a precedent in an elaborate astrological description of the night sky in Vis o RƒÅmin. In turn, Nezami's great work had a tremendous influence on later authors and many imitations of this work were made. With complete artistic and structural unity, the epic of Khosrow o Shirin turned to be a turning point not only for Nizami but for all of Persian literature. Salƒ´m conversing with Majnun in the desert. Nizami's text illustrated with a miniature painting from a late 16th- century Indian book =Leyli o Majnun= A story of Arabic origin which was later absorbed and embellished by the Persians. The poem of 4,600 distichs was dedicated, in 1192, to Abu al-Muzaffar Shirvanshah, who claimed descent from the Sassanid King, whose exploits are reflected in Nezami's \\"Seven Beauties\\"(Haft Paykar). The poem is based on the popular Arab legend of ill- starred lovers: the poet Qays falls in love with his cousin Layla, but is prevented from marrying her by Layla's father. Layla's father forbids contact with Qays and Qays becomes obsessed and starts signing of his love for Layla in public. The obsession becomes so severe that he sees and evaluates everything in terms of Layla; hence his sobriquet \\"the possessed\\" (Majnun). Realizing that cannot obtain union even when other people intercede for him, he leaves society and roams naked in the desert among the beasts. However the image of Layla was so ingrained in him that he cannot eat or sleep. His only activity becomes composing poetry of longing for Layla. Meanwhile, Layla is married against her will, but she guards her virginity by resisting the advances of her husband. Arranging a secret meeting with Majnun, they meet, but have no physical contact. Rather they recite poetry to each other from a distance. Layla's husband dies eventually which removes the legal obstacles to a licit union. However Majnun is so focused on the ideal picture of Layla in his mind that he had fled to the desert. Layla dies out of grief and is buried in her bridal dress. Hearing this news, Majun rushes to her grave where he instantly dies. They are buried side by side and their grave becomes a site of pilgrimage. Someone dreams that in Paradise they are united and live as a king and queen. Nezami composed his romance at the request of the Shirvanshah Akhsatan. Initially, he doubted that this simple story about the agony and pain of an Arab boy wandering in rough mountains and burning deserts would be a suitable subject for royal court poetry and his cultured audience. It was his son who persuaded him to undertake the project, saying: \\"wherever tales of love are read, this will add spice to them\\". Nezami used many Arabic anecdotes in the story but also adds a strong Persian flavor to the legend. He adapted the disconnected stories about Majnun to fit the requirement of a Persian romance.Pellat, Ch.; Bruijn, J.T.P. de; Flemming, B.; Haywood, J.A. \\"Madjn≈´n LaylƒÅ.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W. P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2009. Brill Online. Excerpts: \\"The theme was chosen for the first time as the subject of a Persian narrative poem, but the precedent of the treatment of a similar subject of Arabic origin existed in  øAyy≈´·∏≥ƒ´'s War·∏≥a u GulshƒÅh. Ni·∫ìƒÅmƒ´ states in the introduction to his poem that he accepted the assignment with some hesitation. At first, he doubted whether this tale of madness and wanderings through the wilderness would be suitable for a royal court (ed. Moscow 1965, pp. 41 ff.). He adapted the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance. ...In some respects, the Bedouin setting of the original has been changed under the influence of urban conditions more familiar to the poet and his audience: the young lovers become acquainted at school; the generous Nawfal is a prince in the Iranian style rather than an Arab official. Ni·∫ìƒÅmƒ´ added a second pair of lovers, Zayn and Zaynab, in whom the love between the main characters is reflected. It is Zayn who in a dream sees Madjn≈´n and Laylƒ´ united in paradise at the end of the romance.\\" An important aspect of Layla and Majun that is hardly recognized is the poet's highly humanitarian approach. During the war by Nawfal in favor of Majnun, the latter is unhappy wishing the termination of the war. Majun gives away his horse and amours to save a gazelle and a stag.Ganjavi N. Tras. By Rogers, L. (2002). The Fire of Love: The Love Story of Layla and Majnun New Yorki: Writers Club Press, pp. 77-79. He Persianises the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc.Ali Asghar Seyed-Gohrab, \\"Layli and Majnun: Madness and Mystic Longing\\" Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun. 2003, pp. 76‚Äì77, excerpt: Although Majnun was to some extent a popular figure before Nizami's time, his popularity increased dramatically after the appearance of Nizami's romance. By collecting information from both secular and mystical sources about Majnun, Nizami portrayed such a vivid picture of this legendary lover that all subsequent poets were inspired by him, many of them imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. As we shall see in the following chapters, the poet uses various characteristics deriving from ‚ÄòUdhrite love poetry and weaves them into his own Persian culture. In other words, Nizami Persianises the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc. and adapts the disconnected stories to fit the requirements of a Persian romance. The Story of Layla and Majnun by Nizami, was translated and edited by Dr. Rudolf Gelpke into an English version in collaboration with E. Mattin and G. Hill Omega Publications and published in 1966. Excerpt from the introduction: \\"Nizami preserves the Bedouin atmosphere, the nomad's tents in the desert and the tribal customs of the inhabitants, while at the same time transposing the story into the far more civilized Iranian world...Majnun talks to the planets in the symbolic language of a twelfth century Persian sage, the encounters of small Arabic raiding parties become gigantic battles of royal Persian armies and most of the Bedouins talk like heroes, courtiers, and savants of the refined Iranian Civilization\\" A comprehensive analysis in English containing partial translations of Nezami's romance Layla and Majnun examining key themes such as chastity, constancy and suffering through an analysis of the main characters was recently accomplished by Ali Asghar Seyed-Gohrab. =Eskandar-N√¢meh= The Romance of Alexander the Great\\" contains 10,500 distichs. There are differences of opinion on whether this was Nezami's last epic or the Haft Paykar. The names of its dedicatees are uncertain but the ruler of Ahar, Nosart al-Din Bishkin b. Mohammad has been mentioned. The story is based on Islamic myths developed about Alexander the Great, which derive from Qur'anic references to the Dhu'l-Qarnayn as well as from the Greek Alexander romance of Pseudo-Callisthenes. It consists of two books, Sharaf-Nama and Iqbal-nameh. The poem narrates the three stages in Alexander's life: first as the conqueror of the world; then as a seeker after knowledge, gaining enough wisdom to acknowledge his own ignorance; and finally as a prophet, traveling once again across the world, from west to east, and south to north to proclaim his monotheistic creed to the world at large. The Sharaf-nama discusses the birth of Alexander, his succession to the throne of Rum (Greece), his wars against Africans who invaded Egypt, his conquest of Persia and his marriage to the daughter of Darius. The episode also discusses Alexander's pilgrimage to Mecca, his stay in the Caucasus and his visit to Queen Nushaba of Barda' and her court of Amazons. Alexander conquers India, China and the land of the Rus. The Sharafnama concludes with Alexander's unsuccessful search for the water of immortal life. The Iqbal-nameh is a description of Alexander's personal growth into the ideal ruler on a model ultimately derived, through Islamic intermediaries, from Plato's Republic. He has debates with Greek and Indian philosophers (c.f. with Garshaspnama) and a major portion of the text is devoted to the discourses he has with seven Greek sages. The poet then tells of Alexander's end and adds an account of the circumstances of the death of each of the seven sages. Nezami's image of Alexander is that of an Iranian Abel, A.

Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007. Brill online edition). Excerpt: \\"In the Shahnama, Firdawsi already makes Iskandar an exemplary figure, whom the companionship of Aristotle helps to rise still higher, by the path of wisdom and moderation, in the direction of abstinence and contempt for this world. And Firdwasi laid stress on the defeat of DƒÅrƒÅ (the Darius of the Greeks) as something desired by \\"the rotation of the Heavens\\"....At the time of Ni·∫ìami, however, Islam is from then onwards well established in Iran, and it is the prophetic and ecumenical aspect of his destiny that the poet makes evident in his hero. As a learned Iranian poet, Ni·∫ìami, who demonstrates his eclecticism in the information he gives (he says, \\"I have taken from everything just what suited me and I have borrowed from recent histories, Christian, Pahlavi and Jewish ... and of them I have made a whole\\"), locates the story of his hero principally in Iran. He makes him the image of the Iranian \\"knight\\", peace- loving and moderate, courteous and always ready for any noble action. Like all Ni·∫ìami's heroes, he conquers the passions of the flesh, and devotes his attention to his undertakings and his friendships. These features appear in the account, which follows ancient tradition, of his conduct towards the women of the family of Darius, in his brotherly attitude on the death of that ruler, in his behaviour towards queen Nushaba (the Kaydaf of Firdawsi, the Kandake of the pseudo-Callisthenes) whom he defends against the Russians. knight. An English translation of the Sharaf-Nama by Henry Wilberforce-Clarke was published in 1881 under the title Sikandar Nama e Bara and is available online. =Haft Peykar= Practice Makes Perfect from a Haft Peykar of Nizami. Brooklyn Museum. A pre-Islamic story of Persian origin, it was dedicated to the ruler of Maragha, 'Ala' Al-Din korp Arslan. It is the story of Bahram V, the Sassanid king, who is born to Yazdegerd after twenty years of childlessness and supplication to Ahura Mazda for a child. The Haft Peykar is a romanticized biography of the Sasanian Persian empire ruler Bahram Gur. His adventurous life had already been treated by Ferdowsi in the Shahnama, to which fact Nezami alludes a number of times. In general, his method is to omit those episodes that the earlier poet had treated, or to touch on them only very briefly, and to concentrate on new material. The poet starts by giving an account of the birth of Bahram Gur and his upbringing in the court of the Arab King No'man and his fabled palace Khwarnaq. Bahram whose upbringing is entrusted to No'man becomes a formidable huntsman. While wandering through the fabled palace, he discovers a locked room which contains a depiction of seven princesses; hence the name Haft Peykar (seven beauties). Each of these princesses is from the seven different climes (traditional Zoroastrian-Islamic division of the Earth) and he falls in love with them. His father Yazdegerd I passes away and Bahram returns to Persia to claim his throne from pretenders. After some episodes he is recognized as King and rescues the Persians from a famine. Once the country is stable, the King searches for the seven princesses and wins them as his brides. His architect is ordered to construct seven domes for each of his new brides. The architect tells him that each of the seven climes is ruled by one of the seven planets (classical planetary system of Zoroastrian-Islamic world) and advises him to assure good fortune by adorning each dome with the color that is associated with each clime and planet. Bahram is skeptical but follows the advice of the architect. The princesses take up residence in the splendid pavilions. On each visit, the king visits the princesses on successive days of the week; on Saturday the Indian princess, who is governed by Saturn and so on. The princesses names are Furak (Nurak), the daughter of the Rajah of India, as beautiful as the moon; Yaghma Naz, the daughter of the Khaqan of the Turks; Naz Pari, the daughter of the king of Khwarazm; Nasrin Nush, the daughter of the king of the Slavs; Azarbin (Azareyon), the daughter of the king of Morocco; Humay, the daughter of the Roman Caesar; and Diroste (wholesome), a beautiful Iranian princess from the House of Kay Ka'us. Each princess relates to the king a story matching the mood of her respective color. These seven beautifully constructed, highly sensuous stories occupy about half of the whole poem. While the king is busy with the seven brides, his evil minister seizes power in the realm. Bahram Gur discovers that the affairs of Persia are in disarray, the treasury is empty and the neighboring rulers are posed to invade. He clears his mind first by going hunting. After returning from hunt, he sees a suspended dog from a tree. The owner of the dog, who was shepherd, tells the story of how his faithful watchdog had betrayed his flock to a she-wolf in return for sexual favors. He starts investigating the corrupt minister and from the multitude of complaints, he selects seven who tell him the injustice they have suffered. The minister is subsequently put to death and Bahram Gur restores justice and orders the seven pleasure-domes to be converted to fire temples for the pleasure of God. Bahram then goes hunting for the last time but mysteriously disappears. As a pun on words, while trying to hunt the wild ass (g≈´r) he instead finds his tomb (g≈´r). Ritter, in his introduction to the critical edition describes it as: \\"the best and most beautiful epic in New Persian poetry and at the same time . . . one of the most important poetical creations of the whole of oriental Indo-European literature\\". The Haft Peykar is considered the poet's masterpiece. Overall, in this masterpiece, Nezami illustrates the harmony of the universe, the affinity of the sacred and the profane, and the concordance of ancient and Islamic Iran. The story was translated to English in 1924 by Charles Edward Wilson.The Haft paikar [Engl.], Wilson, Charles Edward, London: Probsthain. 1924. (Probsthain's Oriental series.). (see Amazon) A newer English rendering based on more complete manuscripts was accomplished by Professor Julia Scott Meysami. An excerpt (Original Persian): Other poetry Only a small corpus of his Persian lyric poetry, mainly qa·π£ƒ´dahs (\\"odes\\") and ghazals (\\"lyrics\\") have survived. Ten of his quatrains have also been recorded in the anthology Nozhat al-Majales (which was compiled around 1250) by Jamal Khalil Shirvani along with 23 other poets from Ganja. A famous ghazal of Nezami talks about altruism as the path for reaching the ultimate spiritual goal: Influence and legacy Nizami Mausoleum in Ganja, Azerbaijan. Persian culture The influence of Ne·∫ìƒÅmi's work on the subsequent development of PersianDomenico Parrello, \\"·∏¥AMSA OF NE·∫íƒÄMI\\" in Encyclopaedia Iranica literature has been enormous and the Khamseh became a pattern that was emulated in later Persian poetry (and also in other Islamic literatures). The legacy of Nezami is widely felt in the Islamic world and his poetry has influenced the development of Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Kurdish and Urdu poetry amongst many other languages. In Persian miniature, the stories in Nezami's poems alongside those of Ferdowsi's Shahnama have been the most frequently illustrated literary works. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: Nezami is admired in Persian-speaking lands for his originality and clarity of style, though his love of language for its own sake and of philosophical and scientific learning makes his work difficult for the average reader.

The viewpoint that Nezami is a Persian poet is even today held by the scholars of many countries, specially of Iran.\\" consider Nezami as a significant Persian poet and hail him as the greatest exponent of romantic epic poetry in Persian literature.Dr. Lalita Sinha (Universiti Sains Malaysia, Senior Lecturer in Comparative Literature and Comparative Religion). Garden of Love. World Wisdom, Inc, 2008. . page: 24. \\"Hailed by scholars of Persian literature as the greatest exponent of romantic epic poetry in Persian literature (Levy 1969, XI), Nizami is also referred....\\" Amongst the many notable poets who have taken the Five Treasures of Nezami as their model may be mentioned Amir Khusro, Jalal Farahani, Khwaju Kermani, Mohammad Katebi Tarr-Shirini, Abdul Rahman Jami, Hatefi Jami, Vahshi Bafqi, Maktabi Shirazi, Ali-Shir Nava'i, Abdul Qader-e Bedel Dehlavi, Fuz√ªl√Æ, Hashemi Kermani, Fayzi, Jamali and Ahmad Khani. Not only poets, but historians such as Rawandi were also influenced by Nezami's poetry and used his poem in rendering history. Besides these, scores of poets have started their composition with the first line of the Makhzan al-Asrar. According to Dr. Rudolf Gelpke: Many later poets have imitated Nizami's work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones. The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed not less than forty Persians and thirteen Turkish versions of Layli and Majnun. According to Vahid Dastgerdi, If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of Layli and Majnun. Jami in his Nafahatol Ons remarks that: Although most of Nezami's work on the surface appear to be romance, in reality they are a mask for the essential truths and for the explanation of divine knowledge. Jami in his Baharestan mentions that: Nezami's excellence is more manifest than the sun and has no need of description. Hashemi of Kerman remarks: The empire of poetry obtained its law and order from Nezami's beautiful verses and To present words before Nezami's silent speech is a waste of time. Amir Khusro writes: \\"The ruler of the kingdom of words, famed hero, Scholar and poet, his goblet [glass] toasts. In it ‚Äì pure wine, it's drunkingly sweet, Yet in goblet [glass] beside us ‚Äì only muddy setting.\\" Western reception Nizami Museum of Azerbaijani Literature in Baku, Azerbaijan. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe writes: A gentle, highly gifted spirit, who, when Ferdowsi had completed the collected heroic traditions, chose for the material of his poems the sweetest encounters of the deepest love. Majnun and Layli, Khosrow and Shirin, lovers he presented; meant for one another by premonition, destiny, nature, habit, inclination, passion staunchly devoted to each other; but divided by mad ideas, stubbornness, chance, necessity, and force, then miraculously reunited, yet in the end again in one way or another torn apart and separated from each other. With regards to the recitation of his poetry, Peter Chelkowski states: \\"The memorization and recitation of their literary heritage has alway beens vital to Iranians, whose attitude towards the power of the written and spoken word is revential. Even today the national passion for poetry is constantly expressed over radio and television, in teahouses, in literary societies, in daily conversation, and in the Musha'areh, the poetry recitation contest. Nizami's work serves as a vehicle and a symbol of this tradition, for it unites universality with deep-rooted artistic endeavor, a sense of justice and passion for the arts and sciences with spirituallity and genuine piety. for richness and fineness of metaphor, accuracy, and profundity of psychological observation, and sheer virtuosity of storytelling, Nizami is unequalled\\". Nezami's story of Layla and Majnun also provided the namesake for a hit single by Eric Clapton, also called \\"Layla\\". Recorded with Derek and the Dominos, \\"Layla\\" was released on the 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. The album was highly influenced by Nezami and his poetry of unrequited love. The fifth song of Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, \\"I Am Yours\\", was in fact a Nezami composition, set to music by Clapton. In 2004, there was a conference on Nezami organized in the University of Cambridge. The book containing the proceedings of this conference was published under the title: \\"Nizami: A Key to the Treasure of Hakim \\" in 2011 by Leiden Press. Soviet Union In the early 1940s Azerbaijani composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov to mark the 800th anniversary of Nizami Ganjavi planned to write seven songs on Nizami poems accordingly to seven beauties of the poem. However Hajibeyov wrote only two songs: Sensiz (Without You, 1941) and Sevgili Janan (Beloved, 1943). Another Azerbaijani composer Gara Garayev, composed Seven Beauties (ballet) in 1947‚Äì48 based on Nizami's eponymous poem that won an international acclaim.. He also composed Leyli and Majnun (ballet) that premiered on 25 May 1969 at the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater in Baku and later was recorded as a film.Tatiana Egorova Soviet Film Music: An Historical Survey, p. 186 A minor planet 3770 Nizami, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh in 1974 is named after him.

The Nizami Museum of Literature is located in Baku, Azerbaijan. One of the Baku Metro stations is also named after Nizami Ganjavi. There is Institute of Literature named after Nizami and Cinema named after Nizami in Baku. One of the districts of Baku is called Nizami raion. The life of Nizami Ganjavi is shown in the Azerbaijani movie \\"Nizami\\" (1982), in which the leading role, role of Nizami Ganjavi, was played by Muslim Magomayev. The Nizami Mausoleum, built in honor of Nizami, stands just outside the city of Ganja in Azerbaijan. It is a tall cylindrical building, surrounded by gardens. To one side, there is a metal statue commemorating Nizami's epic poems. The mausoleum was originally built in 1947 in place of an old collapsed mausoleum, and rebuilt in its present form after Azerbaijan Republic regained its independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Monuments to Nezami are found in many cities of Azerbaijan and Iran, as well as in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Udmurtiya (Russia), Kyiv (Ukraine), Beijing (China), Tashkent (Uzbekistan), Marneuli (Georgia), Chi≈üinƒÉu (Moldova), Rome (Italy).

The attack Former Israeli Embassy before the attack. On 17 March 1992, at 2:42 pm (UTC‚àí3), a pick-up truck driven by a suicide bomber and loaded with explosives smashed into the front of the Israeli Embassy located on the corner of Arroyo and Suipacha, and detonated. The embassy, a Catholic church, and a nearby school building were destroyed. Four Israelis died, but most of the victims were Argentine civilians, many of them children.Bergman, 171. The blast killed 29 and wounded 242. It was Argentina's deadliest terror attack until the 1994 AMIA bombing and it remains the deadliest attack on an Israeli diplomatic mission. Fatalities Priest Juan Carlos Brumana was one of the people killed in the suicide bombing. He died in the Catholic Church Mater Admirabilis that is in front of the embassy. Among the dead there were two Israeli women who were the wives of the embassy's consul and first secretary. Responsibility A group called Islamic Jihad Organization, which has been linked to Iran and possibly Hezbollah, claimed responsibility; their stated motive for the attack was Israel's assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Sayed Abbas al- Musawi in February 1992. Islamic Jihad also released surveillance footage they took of the embassy before the blast. After the bombing, Israel sent investigators to Argentina to search for clues. They learned that the bombers planned the attack in the Tri-Border area, where the borders of Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil meet and which has a large Muslim population.Bergman, 172. Messages intercepted by the American National Security Agency revealed Iranian knowledge of the impending attack, as well as the complicity of Hezbollah operative Imad Mughniyah. In fact, Mughniyah was formally charged by Argentina with participating in the bombings of the Israeli embassy. In May 1998, Moshen Rabbani (the Cultural Attach√© in the Iranian Embassy in Argentina until December 1997) was detained in Germany, and the Argentine government expelled seven Iranian diplomats from the country, stating that it had \\"convincing proof\\" of Iranian involvement in the bombing. However, none of the suspects were prosecuted. The attack occurred when Iran and Argentina were hoping for a resumption of nuclear cooperation, although Argentina had announced the suspension of the shipments of nuclear materials to Iran a couple months before the bombing.Argentina's Iranian nuke connection, Gareth Porter, 15 November 2006 A number of sourcesUnited States Department of State, April 2005 report on Hezbollah involvement with the assistance of Syria. Hezbollah denies these claims. In 1999, the Argentine government issued an arrest warrant for Imad Mughniyah in connection with this attack and the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, which killed 85. It is suspected that the two attacks are linked.Norton, Augustus Richard, Hezbollah: A Short History, Princeton University Press, 2007, p.79 Aftermath=Kirchner on the case When he was president, N√©stor Kirchner pronounced that allowing these two incidents to happen, with no real inquiries to be followed, equalled a \\"national disgrace\\". He reopened, and kept open files from these incidents, most to be read by Justice Juan Jose Galeano. In the same process Kirchner hoped to lift the ban for former Intelligence Officers (Argentine) to testify. A former president of Argentina (his widow, Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner) also claimed that she wanted to get to the bottom of the case. Argentinian federal prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, was assigned to investigate the bombing, but one day before he was scheduled to report on his findings, he was found dead in his home on 18 January 2015.

Career  Born in Brooklyn, New York, into an academic scientific family, Birge obtained his doctorate from the University of Wisconsin in 1913. In the same year he married Irene A. Walsh. The Birges had two children, Carolyn Elizabeth (Mrs. E. D. Yocky) and Robert Walsh, Associate Director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1973-1981. After five years as an instructor at Syracuse University, he became a member of the physics department at University of California, Berkeley, where he remained until he retired, as chairman, in 1955. On his arrival at Berkeley, Birge sought collaboration with the Berkeley College of Chemistry, then under the leadership of Gilbert N. Lewis. However, Birge's championing of the Bohr atom led him into conflict with the chemists who defended Lewis' earlier theory of the cubical atom. Birge was unafraid of scientific controversy and persevered with his course on atomic structure, attracting future Nobel Laureates in chemistry William Francis Giauque and Harold Clayton Urey. His work on molecular spectra included the development of the Birge-Sponer method, which was later generalized by the LeRoy-Bernstein theory . Birge's later work arose from his initial bewilderment at the variety and inconsistency among measurements of the fundamental physical constants. His interest led to a broad mastery of all branches of the physical sciences and gave fruit with many publications, in particular, a 1929 paper in Reviews of Modern Physics that recommended a standard set of values for the constants based on earlier published results. There ensued a frustration with the conventional methods of statistics as applied in physical science which led to a collaboration with W. Edwards Deming. Following their 1934 joint paper in Reviews of Modern Physics, their approaches diverged with Deming following the work of Walter A. Shewhart while Birge became interested in the more conventional statistical approaches of least squares and maximum likelihood. Birge's interest in statistics led him to the investigation of parapsychology in which he conducted many experiments without finding any conclusive results.  Leadership of Berkeley Physics Department  Birge was an active administrator and was the architect of the department's prestige, seeking out physicists such as Robert Oppenheimer and Ernest Lawrence and guiding the department through its golden years of the 1930s and through the changes brought on by World War II, the Manhattan Project, and the birth of \\"Big Science.\\" In the late 1930s, Birge opposed the creation of an assistant professorship for Oppenheimer's associate Robert Serber, writing another colleague that \\"one Jew in the department is enough.\\" Bird, Kai and Sherwin, Martin T., \\"American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer\\", Vintage Books, 2006, ; page 106 Both Oppenheimer and Serber were Jewish. During the McCarthy era in 1949, the Regents of the University of California enforced an anti-communist oath to be signed by all employees. Though an outspoken critic of the oath, after much searching of conscience, Birge decided that his loyalty to the department and the university demanded that he sign and fight from within for freedom of speech. Many of his colleagues did not sign and were dismissed.  Death and honors  Birge died in Berkeley, California. His honors include: * President of the American Physical Society; * Member of the National Academy of Sciences; and * Honorary degree of LLD from the University of California, Berkeley. In December 1964, the new Physics building at Berkeley, Birge Hall was dedicated to Raymond Birge.

He was the last holder of the post of Premier peintre du Roi, serving from 1789 to 1791. Biography He was born in Montpellier. Protected by Comte de Caylus, he entered at an early age the studio of Natoire, and obtained the grand prix in 1745. He used his time at Rome in applying to the study of nature and the development of his own powers all that he gleaned from the masterpieces around him; but his tendencies were so foreign to the reigning taste that on his return to Paris he owed his admission to the academy for his picture Daedalus and Icarus (Louvre) solely to the indignant protests of Fran√ßois Boucher.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica , 1911 When in 1776, at the height of his established reputation, he became director of the school of France at Rome, he refused to take Jacques-Louis David with him amongst his pupils, stating he was too old to teach a young artist. After his return, five years later, his fortunes were wrecked by the French Revolution; but he undauntedly set to work, and at the age of eighty (1796) carried off the prize in an open government competition. Napoleon Bonaparte acknowledged his merit by making him a senator. Joseph-Marie Vien died in Paris, and was buried in the crypt of the Panth√©on.

This conditioning is intended to cause the patient to associate the stimulus with unpleasant sensations with the intention of quelling the targeted (sometimes compulsive) behavior. Aversion therapies can take many forms, for example: placing unpleasant-tasting substances on the fingernails to discourage nail-chewing; pairing the use of an emetic with the experience of alcohol; or pairing behavior with electric shocks of mild to higher intensities. Aversion therapy, when used nonconsentually, is widely considered to be inhumane. At the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center, aversion therapy is used to perform behavior modification in students as part of the center's applied behavioral analysis program. The center has been condemned by the United Nations for torture. In addictions Various forms of aversion therapy have been used in the treatment of addiction to alcohol and other drugs since 1932 (discussed in Principles of Addiction Medicine, Chapter 8, published by the American Society of Addiction Medicine in 2003). Alcohol addiction An approach to the treatment of alcohol dependence that has been wrongly characterized as aversion therapy involves the use of disulfiram, a drug which is sometimes used as a second-line treatment under appropriate medical supervision. When a person drinks even a small amount of alcohol, disulfiram causes sensitivity involving highly unpleasant reactions, which can be clinically severe. Rather than as an actual aversion therapy, the nastiness of the disulfiram-alcohol reaction is deployed as a drinking deterrent for people receiving other forms of therapy who actively wish to be kept in a state of enforced sobriety (disulfiram is not administered to active drinkers). Cocaine dependency Emetic therapy and faradic aversion therapy has been used to induce aversion for cocaine dependency. Cigarette addiction It is unknown whether aversion therapy, in the form of rapid smoking (to provide an unpleasant stimulus), can help tobacco smokers overcome the urge to smoke. In compulsive habits Aversion therapy has been used in the context of subconscious or compulsive habits, such as chronic nailbiting, hair-pulling (trichotillomania), or skin-picking (commonly associated with forms of obsessive compulsive disorder as well as trichotillomania).  In history  Pliny the Elder attempted to heal alcoholism in the first century Rome by putting putrid spiders in alcohol abusers' drinking glasses. In 1935, Charles Shadel turned a colonial mansion in Seattle into the Shadel Sanatorium where he began treating alcoholics for their substance use disorder. His enterprise was launched with the help of gastroenterologist Walter Voegtlin and psychiatrist Fred Lemere. Together, they created a medical practice that exclusively treated chronic alcoholism through Pavlovian conditioned reflex aversion therapy. In popular culture * In Anthony Burgess's novel A Clockwork Orange and the film adaptation directed by Stanley Kubrick, the main character Alex is subjected to a fictional form of aversion therapy, called the \\"Ludovico technique\\", with the aim of stopping his violent behavior.  Judge Rotenberg Center  The Judge Rotenberg Center is a school in Canton, Massachusetts that uses the methods of ABA to perform behavior modification in children with developmental disabilities. Before it was banned in 2020, the center used a device called a Graduated Electronic Decelerator (GED) to deliver electric skin shocks as aversives. The Judge Rotenberg center has been condemned by the United Nations for torture as a result of this practice. While many human rights and disability rights advocates have campaigned to shut down the center, as of 2020 it remains open. Six students have died of preventable incidents at the school since it opened in 1971.

Her name means \\"Eagle\\" in Polish. The boat is best known for the Orze≈Ç incident, her escape from internment in neutral Estonia during the early stages of the Second World War. Construction Orze≈Ç was laid down 14 August 1936 at the Dutch shipyard De Schelde, as the Job No. 205; launched on 15 January 1938, and commissioned on 2 February 1939. She was a modern design (designed by the joint venture of Polish and Dutch engineers), albeit quite large for the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. World War II=Polish Campaign At the beginning of the invasion of Poland Orze≈Ç was docked in Oksywie. As per the Worek Plan, the submarine was deployed on patrol in a designated strategic zone of the Baltic Sea. The crew received orders to attack the pre-dreadnought Schleswig-Holstein, should it leave Danzig. With the situation rapidly deteriorating, Orzel abandoned its sector on 4 September and began to withdraw into the Baltic Sea. The submarine was attacked by the German minesweepers M3 and M4, damaged but evaded destruction that evening. Escape to Britain thumb The clandestine German transport Rio de Janeiro The stone commemorating the \\"Orze≈Ç incident\\" and the escape of the submarine Orze≈Ç in 1939, - in both Polish and Estonian languages, Estonian Maritime Museum, Tallinn Orzels crew decided to head to Tallinn, Estonia as a result of the damage. Orze≈Ç reached Tallinn on 14 September 1939. On 15 September the captain, Lieutenant-Commander Henryk K≈Çoczkowski, was forced to leave the submarine to undergo hospital treatment for an unknown illness he had been suffering from since 8 September. Under the Hague Convention of 1907, section XIII, Article 12,The Avalon Project - Laws of War : Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers in Naval War (Hague XIII); October 18, 1907 \\"belligerent ships\\" could enter a neutral port but were forbidden from remaining there for \\"more than twenty-four hours.\\" At the insistence of Germany, the Estonian military authorities boarded the ship, interned the crew, confiscated all the navigation aids and maps, and commenced removing all her armaments. However, only fifteen of her twenty torpedoes were removed before the hoist cable parted; this was because it had been secretly sabotaged by her new commander, former chief officer, Lieutenant Jan Grudzinski. The crew of Orze≈Ç conspired together to carry out a daring escape. Around midnight on 18 September, the submarine's Estonian guards were overpowered, the mooring lines were cut, and Orze≈Ç got under way. The alarm was raised, and her conning tower was peppered by machine-gun fire. Running half-submerged, Orze≈Ç ran aground on a bar at the harbour mouth, where artillery fire damaged her wireless equipment. Grudzinski managed to get the boat off the bar by blowing her tanks, and she proceeded out of the Gulf of Finland, intending to sail for a British port, the crew having heard a radio report that the Polish submarine had been welcomed in Britain. Orzel escaped from Tallinn with two Estonian guards on board as hostages. The Estonian and German press covering the Orze≈Ç incident declared the two captured guards missing at sea. Grudzinski set them ashore in Sweden, providing them with clothing, money, and food for their safe return to homeland. The Polish crew believed that those returning from the underworld \\"deserve to travel first class only\\". The escape of the submarine Orze≈Ç was used by the Soviet Union and Germany to challenge Estonian neutrality. Since Orze≈Çs navigational charts had all been removed by the Estonian authorities, Captain Grudzinski resolved to stop a German ship and take her charts. However, the only German vessels encountered were warships rather than merchantmen. The submarine's sole remaining navigational aid was a list of lighthouses, and using these as a reference, Orze≈Ç followed a course along the Baltic coast, around Denmark, and out into the North Sea where she came under attack by British as well as German forces, since without her wireless equipment she had no means of identifying herself. Forty days after she had originally sailed from Gdynia, Orze≈Ç made landfall, off the east coast of Scotland. She lay on the bottom until emergency repairs were made to the radio, then surfaced to transmit a message in English. A Royal Navy destroyer then came out and escorted her into port, much to the surprise of the British who had thought her long since sunk. Orze≈Ç sank no enemy vessels during her journey from Estonia to Britain, although Soviet authorities blamed her for sinking the Soviet tanker Metallist in Narva Bay on 26 September, the incident being used as a pretext for the Soviet invasion of the Baltic states. Norwegian Campaign Orze≈Ç in the United Kingdom After a refit, Orze≈Ç was assigned to the Royal Navy's 2nd Submarine Flotilla, and was assigned to patrol missions. Shortly after noon on 8 April 1940 she sank the 5,261 ton clandestine German troop transport off the small harbour village of Lillesand in southern Norway,Losses of the German merchant navy on the Rio de Janeiro killing hundreds of German troops intended for the invasion of Norway.Norwegian Defence Force website on the sinking of the Rio de Janeiro Rio de Janeiro was heading to Bergen in order to take part in the initial landings of Operation Weser√ºbung - the invasion of Norway and opening move of the Norwegian Campaign. News that several hundred German soldiers were rescued by the Norwegian Navy and some had admitted their intention to occupy Norway reached the Norwegian parliament that evening, however this news was dismissed and no steps were taken to alert their Navy or Coast Guard of the impending invasion. Two days later Orze≈Ç fired a torpedo at a German minesweeper V 705; however, she was forced to dive before the sinking of the German ship could be confirmed - the ship was not damaged by the torpedoes. Loss On 23 May 1940, Orze≈Ç departed on its seventh patrol in the central North Sea. On 1 and 2 June, radio messages were transmitted from the Rosyth Naval base ordering the boat to alter its patrol area and proceed to the Skagerrak (the strait separating Norway and Sweden from the Danish Jutland peninsula). No radio signals had been received from her since she had sailed, and on 5 June Orze≈Ç was ordered to return to base. No reception was acknowledged. On 8 June 1940 the submarine was officially declared lost. The true cause is unknown, although it is commonly believed the Orze≈Ç most likely struck a British or German sea mine in or near the Skagerrak. Another theory suggests the boat may have been sunk mistakenly by a British aircraft. Search for the wreck Between 2008 and 2017 a number of Polish expeditions, both private and public- funded, searched the region of North Sea where she went missing with the hope of finding her final resting place. Wrecks of various other ships have been located, but Orze≈Ç has not been among them and ultimately the fate of the ship remains a mystery. In June 2013 the Polish Navy, following reports of a wreck of an unknown large submarine found in the North Sea, conducted one more expedition to check whether the ship could be Orze≈Ç. The wreck was surveyed and identified as . In 2017 another private expedition found a previously unknown wreck which they identified to be most likely HMS Narwhal based on sonar data. On May 23rd, 2020, 80 years after leaving on its final patrol, the Shipwreck Expeditions Association announced a partnership to search for the wreck in conjunction with the Maritime University of Szczecin with the assistance from the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland and the Ministry of Maritime Economy and Inland Navigation. The search is currently entering the logistics and preparations phase for the first expedition.

She contested the 2005 election under her married name, despite having been divorced for two years, so as not to confuse the voters. Following the election she returned to her maiden name. She attended Woodmill High School in Dunfermline before embarking on a career in nursing. She joined the Fife Health Board in 1975 as a nursing assistant, becoming a pupil nurse in 1977, before becoming a State Enrolled Nurse in 1978 working at the Lynebank Hospital in Dunfermline. In 1978 she left Fife and joined the Northern Ireland Eastern Health Service in 1980, leaving in 1983 as a staff nurse. She moved to England in 1983 and joined the East Kent Community Health Care Trust as a staff nurse. She became a councillor in 1994 on the Ashford Borough Council where she served until 2000. She has been a member of the National Executive Committee since 1990. Moffat is also a member of UNISON and the Trades Union Congress's General Purposes Committee. Parliamentary career Moffat was elected to the House of Commons for the East Lothian constituency in the 2001 general election. She has served on a number of select committees including the Modernisation and Accommodation and Works Committee (2004‚Äì2005), the European Scrutiny Committee (2004‚Äì2005) and Trade and Industry Select Committee (2005‚Äì2007). She was also Parliamentary Private Secretary to Alan Johnson at the Department of Health from 2008‚Äì2009. In November 2008, Moffat was one of 18 MPs who signed a Commons motion backing a Team GB football team at the 2012 Summer Olympics, saying football \\"should not be any different from other competing sports and our young talent should be allowed to show their skills on the world stage\\". The football governing bodies of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all opposed to a Great Britain team, fearing it would stop them competing as individual nations in future tournaments. Travel expenses In 2003‚Äì2004, Moffat billed the taxpayer ¬£39,744 for travel expenses ‚Äì the highest of any Member of Parliament. Green Party activist Michael Collie fought to have the details of the claims published under the Freedom of Information Act. The UK Parliament refused to disclose the information for a total of two years, going as far as the High Court to prevent its disclosure. It was not until November 2007 that Moffat's expenses were finally made public. Moffat claimed for first-class rail and air fares and trips to Malta and Portugal. Moffat claimed ¬£9,792 in rail fares, with the average claim for a London to Glasgow/Edinburgh journey being ¬£277. She had also claimed ¬£1,817 in rail fares for 42 trips between Heathrow and Central London ‚Äì an average of ¬£43 when the highest priced ticket costs ¬£18. Moffat claimed ¬£15,712 for air travel between London and Scotland, plus ¬£12,289 in mileage (a total of 24,129 miles). In total for the period 2002‚Äì2005 Moffat's travel expenses amounted to ¬£95,539. She cut her claims by 70% in 2006‚Äì07, claiming ¬£12,331. In 2007/2008 she had the joint highest expenses claims for Additional Costs Allowances including claims for ¬£400 per month for food even when Parliament is not sitting. Hitler comparison of First Minister On 23 May 2007, she compared the newly elected Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond to Adolf Hitler, saying \\"proportional representation gave Germany Adolf Hitler and in Scotland to a lesser degree we've had the member for Banff and Buchan\\" during a debate in the House of Commons on the 2007 Scottish Elections. Angus Robertson criticised Moffat's conduct, saying, \\"It was ignorant, it was ill-judged, it was plain wrong, and it was very dangerous.\\" Moffat said \\"What I was referring to was the voting system, the proportional representation and electoral voting system, not about individuals. I was just giving examples.\\" Deselection by constituency party In November 2008 the East Lothian constituency party passed a vote of no confidence in Moffat. Her critics claimed dissatisfaction over Moffat's travel expenses and disputes with constituency staff. In response, the national Labour Party suspended the constituency party. However, the East Lothian Labour Party proceeded to vote on 22 January 2010 to deselect Anne Moffat. This was confirmed by a further vote by 130 to 59 on 19 March 2010.BBC News, 19 March 2010 Her critics, who included senior party officials in the constituency, asserted that she had neglected her duties as an MP, as exemplified by having been, at one point, the MP to make the lowest number of speeches in the House of Commons; that she had failed to attend party meetings; and that she had failed to properly represent her constituents. On 23 March the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party rejected her appeal.BBC News 23 March 2010 On 25 March it emerged that she had negotiated a retirement deal as an MP on the grounds of poor health.

He also studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he researched artificial intelligence and language translation. He speaks six languages, despite being born with a cleft palate, and has worked as a professional translator of Danish and German for the European Commission and other clients. He was the first person with the cleft palate disability to enter Parliament. As a computer scientist, he developed the COMPACT clinical trials package for the Medical Research Council.

Nick Palmer with the then Secretary of State for Transport, Ruth Kelly, launching free bus travel. He suggested TV Licence exemption for over-75s which was then adopted by the government, along with similar measures like free bus passes for the elderly. In January 1998, Palmer introduced a bill under the Ten Minute Rule, amending the Firearms act 1968 and raising the age for possession of air weapons, especially to prevent malicious use against pets. In April 2000, he introduced a private members bill to presume consent for organ donation, a measure still being considered which could increase transplants by 25%. In January 2002, he introduced a 10-minute rule bill advocating Identity Cards which was adopted by the Government. He subsequently brokered a deal to get the government's version through the Lords. He campaigned for five years for bells to be fitted to all new bicycles in response to a petition from his constituents. A bill was passed making them compulsory from 1 May 2004. He introduced a bill about fine print, requiring a minimum size of print in documents, especially those relating to advertising and contracts. In December 2005, he introduced another 10-minute rule bill intended to ensure speed camera warning signs displayed the limit they enforced. In May 2008, he introduced an amendment to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 requiring that \\"strictly neutral information\\" be provided in cases of foetal abnormality. This was based on his parents' experience of the expert advice from pioneering surgeon Archibald McIndoe who successfully reconstructed his cleft palate. He gave speeches in the Commons on animal welfare issues and in December 2009 he was one of 8 cross-party supporters of a bill introduced by Nigel Waterson to \\"make provision for residents of care homes and sheltered accommodation to keep domestic pets in certain circumstances.\\" Based on his experience as a computer software developer, he spoke against the terms of the Digital Economy Bill and joined Tom Watson and Austin Mitchell in leading a Labour rebellion against its third reading.

He held the seat comfortably with an increased majority at the 2001 election, and again with a reduced majority in 2005 election. An opinion piece suggested that part of the reason that Palmer had held his seat was due to his high constituency work rate. In the 2010 election, the seat was lost to the Conservative candidate Anna Soubry, reflecting a national swing. While an MP, he responded to a \\"very high\\" percentage of constituents' letters, addressing matters of local concern such as open-cast mining and the development of the local Nottingham tramway and in February 2008 he asked about \\"proposals to build on virtually the entire green belt\\" in Broxtowe at Prime Minister's Questions. In June 2008 he asked the Department for Transport about the second phase of the tram/train trials. He campaigned for and organised a bus service to link Kimberley with the Nottingham tram at Phoenix Park. Post-parliamentary career A month after losing his seat in the 2010 general election, Palmer became the first ex-MP to sign on for unemployment benefit. He said this was partly to keep his national insurance contributions continuous and partly to explore for himself what the unemployment services are like. Palmer described the experience as sensitive but said he had received plenty of helpful suggestions and was favourably impressed. In September 2010, he became Director of International and Corporate Affairs for the BUAV. In September 2011 Palmer contributed to the book What next for Labour?. He wrote two pieces, one entitled \\"Student Fees: A Constructive Response\\" and the other \\"Animal Welfare: The Neglected Swing Issue\\".What Next for Labour: Contributors He is the patron of Cats Protection. In August 2010, pursuing his interest in animal welfare, he joined the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection as their Director of International and Corporate Relations. He stood again for the Broxtowe seat at the 2015 general election but failed to regain the seat. In September 2016 he intervened in the leadership battle between Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith. Palmer described himself as one who considered the 1997‚Äì2010 Labour government as 'very successful' but 'blighted by the disaster of Iraq'. He called on members and parliamentarians to give Corbyn a 'decent chance'. On 2 May 2019, he was elected to Waverley Borough Council in the Godalming Binscombe Ward.Haslemere Herald Personal life In 1983 Palmer founded Flagship Magazine. Palmer married Fiona Hunter in 2000, having proposed to her on the terrace of the House of Commons. The ceremony took place on his birthday in the ornate 14th century Chapel of St Mary Undercroft.

He was the eldest son of Lieutenant-General Anne de Tubi√®res, comte de Caylus. His mother, Marthe-Marguerite de Villette de Mursay, comtesse de Caylus (1673‚Äì1729), was the daughter of vice-admiral Philippe, Marquis de Villette-Mursay. His younger brother was Charles de Tubi√®res de Caylus, who became a naval officer and governor of Martinique. He was a cousin of Mme de Maintenon, who brought Marthe-Marguerite up like her own daughter. Marthe- Marguerite wrote valuable Souvenirs of the court of Louis XIV; these were edited by Voltaire (1770), and by many later editors. Career While a young man, Caylus distinguished himself in the campaigns of the French army, from 1709 to 1714. After the peace of Rastatt (1714) he spent some time in travelling in Italy, Greece, the Levant, England and Germany, and devoted much attention to the study and collection of antiquities. He became an active member of the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture and of the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions. Chief among his antiquarian works must be the profusely illustrated Recueil d'antiquit√©s √©gyptiennes, √©trusques, grecques, romaines et gauloises (6 vols., Paris, 1752‚Äì1755), which was mined by the designers of Neoclassical arts for the rest of the century. His Numismata Aurea Imperatorum Romanorum, treats only the gold coinage of the Roman emperors, those worthy of collection by a grand seigneur. His concentration on the object itself marked a step towards modern connoisseuship, and in his M√©moire (1755) on the method of encaustic painting, the ancient technique of painting with wax as a medium mentioned by Pliny the Elder, he claimed to have rediscovered the method. Denis Diderot, who was no friend to Caylus, maintained that the proper method had been found by J.-B. Bachelier. Caylus in Receuil d'Antiquit√©s, Book 7, 1767 Caylus was an admirable etcher, and copied many paintings of the great masters. He caused engravings to be made, at his own expense, of Bartoli's copies from ancient pictures and published Nouveaux sujets de peinture et de sculpture (1755) and Tableaux tir√©s de l'Iliade, de l'Odyss√©e, et de l'En√©ide (1757). His cultural interests were not confined to the arts of Classical Antiquity but extended to Gallic monuments, such as the megaliths of Aurille (Poitou), of which he commissioned drawings in 1762. He encouraged artists whose reputations were still in the making, and befriended the connoisseur and collector of prints and drawings Pierre-Jean Mariette when Mariette was only twenty-two, but his patronage was somewhat capricious. Diderot expressed this fact in an epigram in his Salon of 1765: \\"Death has delivered us from the cruellest of connoisseurs.\\" Caylus had quite another side to his character. He had a thorough acquaintance with the gayest and most disreputable sides of Parisian life, and left a number of more or less witty stories dealing with it. These were collected (Amsterdam, 1787) as his ≈íuvres badines compl√®tes. The best of them is the Histoire de M. Guillaume, cocher (c. 1730). His Contes, hovering between French fairy tales and oriental fantasies, between conventional charm and moral satire, have been collected and were published in 2005; they were originally published as les F√©eries nouvelles (1741), les Contes orientaux (1743), Cinq contes de f√©es (1745), plus two posthumous stories published in 1775. The ', published in 1805, is of very doubtful authenticity. See also E. and J. de Goncourt, Portraits intimes du XVIIIi√®me si√®cle; Charles Nisard's edition of the ' (1877); and a notice by O. Uzanne prefixed to a volume of his Facties (1879).

Biography=Before World War II Anders was born on 11 August 1892 to his father Albert Anders and mother Elizabeth (maiden name Tauchert) in the village of Kro≈õniewice‚ÄìB≈Çonie, sixty miles west of Warsaw, in what was then a part of the Russian Empire. Both his parents were of Baltic-German origin and he was baptised as a member of the Protestant Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland. Anders had three brothers ‚Äì Karol, Tadeusz and Jerzy, all of whom also went on to pursue careers in the military.Wy≈ºsza Szko≈Ça Informatyki i ZarzƒÖdzania w Rzeszowie (in Polish) Anders attended a technical high school in Warsaw and later studied at Riga Technical University,Anders W≈Çadys≈Çaw at Encyklopedia PWN. where he became a member of the Polish student fraternity .Ksiƒôga PamiƒÖtkowa Arkonii 1879 ‚Äì 1979 (in Polish) ‚Äì http://www.arkonia.pl/Czytelnia/Ksiegi_pamiatkowe/Ksiega_100lecia. After graduation Anders was accepted into the Russian Military School for reserve officers. As a young officer, he served in the 1st Krechowiecki Lancers Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army during World War I. When Poland regained its independence in November 1918 he joined the newly-formed Polish Army. During the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War of 1919-1921 he commanded the 15th Pozna≈Ñ Uhlans Regiment and was awarded the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari. After the war Anders continued his military education in France at the Ecole Superieur de Guerre and upon graduation he returned to Poland, where he served on the general staff of the Polish Army under General Tadeusz Jordan-Rozwadowski (Chief of the General Staff from 1920 to 1921). Anders opposed J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's coup d'√©tat in Poland in 1926, but unlike Jordan-Rozwadowski, he avoided persecution by the Sanation regime that assumed power after the coup. Pi≈Çsudski made him the commander of a cavalry brigade in 1931 and he was promoted to the rank of general three years later. World War II Anders commanded the Nowogr√≥dzka Cavalry Brigade during the German Army's invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was immediately called into action, taking part in the Battle of M≈Çawa. After the collapse of the Polish Northern Front the brigade withdrew towards Warsaw, and also fought heavy battles against the Germans around Minsk Mazowiecki and in the second phase of the Battle of Tomasz√≥w Lubelski. After learning about the Soviet invasion of Poland, Anders retreated south in the direction of Lw√≥w (now called Lviv), hoping to reach the Hungarian or Romanian border, but was intercepted by Soviet forces and captured on 29 September, after being wounded twice. He was initially jailed in Lw√≥w and subsequently transferred to the Lubyanka prison in Moscow on 29 February 1940. During his imprisonment Anders was interrogated, tortured and unsuccessfully urged to join the Red Army. A wartime picture of Anders. After the launch of Operation Barbarossa and the signing of the Sikorski-Maisky agreement, Anders was released by the Soviets with the aim of forming a Polish Army to fight against the Germans alongside the Red Army. Continued friction with the Soviets over political issues as well as shortages of weapons, food and clothing, led to the eventual evacuation of Anders' men ‚Äì known as Anders' Army ‚Äì together with a sizeable contingent of Polish civilians who had been deported to the USSR from Soviet-occupied Poland, via the Persian Corridor into Iran, Iraq, and finally into Mandatory Palestine. The evacuation, which took place in March 1942, was based on the British-Soviet-Polish understanding. The soldiers involved were evacuated from the Soviet Union and made their way through Iran to British-ruled Palestine, where they passed under British command. Here, Anders formed and led the Polish 2nd Corps, while continuing to agitate for the release of Polish nationals still in the Soviet Union. The Polish 2nd Corps became a major tactical and operational unit of the Polish Armed Forces in the West. Anders commanded the Corps throughout the Italian Campaign, capturing Monte Cassino on 18 May 1944, later fighting on the Gothic Line and in the final spring offensive. After World War II After the war the Soviet-installed communist government of Poland deprived him of Polish citizenship and of his military rank. Anders had, however, always been unwilling to return to a Soviet-dominated Poland where he probably would have been jailed and possibly executed, and remained in Britain. He was prominent in the Polish Government in Exile in London and became inspector- general of the Polish forces-in-exile, as well as working on behalf of various charities and welfare organisations. His book about his experiences during the Second World War, An Army in Exile, was first published by MacMillan & Co, London, in 1949. He died in London on 12 May 1970, where his body lay in state at the church of Andrzej Bobola, and many of his former soldiers and their families came to pay their last respects. He was buried, in accordance with his wishes, amongst his fallen soldiers from the 2nd Polish Corps at the Polish War Cemetery at Monte Cassino in Italy. After the collapse of communist rule in Poland in 1989, his citizenship and military rank were posthumously reinstated. Many personal effects which once belonged to Anders are on display in the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London. Private life Anders was married twice. He had two children with his first wife Irena Maria Jordan-KrƒÖkowska (born 1894, died 1981) ‚Äì a daughter, Anna (born 1919, died 2006) and a son, George (born 1927, died 1983). In 1948, he married the actress and singer Irena Jarosiewicz,Irena Anders buried at Monte Cassino better known under her stage name Renata Bogda≈Ñska, with whom he had a daughter, Anna Maria (born in 1950). Post-war, Anders was accused of being an anti-Semite.

(MP) from 1994 until 2010, representing Dudley West from 1994 until 1997, and then Dudley South from 1997 until his retirement from the House of Commons at the 2010 general election. He served as Economic Secretary to the Treasury from 2008 to 2010. Early life Pearson was educated at Balliol College, Oxford (BA Philosophy, Politics, and Economics) and the University of Warwick (MA, PhD). Political career Having unsuccessfully contested Bexhill and Battle in the 1983 general election, Pearson entered parliament for Dudley West in a by-election in December 1994, winning a Conservative seat left vacant by the death of John Blackburn in October of that year. He won the seat with nearly 70% of the votes, with the Conservative candidates polling at less than 20%.Results of Byelections in the 1992‚Äì97 Parliament Boundary changes saw him move to the newly created constituency of Dudley South in 1997. Pearson served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Paymaster-General Geoffrey Robinson from 1997 until Robinson was forced to resign in 1998. In 2001 he returned to the government as a whip. In 2002 he moved to the Northern Ireland Office as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. After the 2005 general election he was promoted to Minister of State for Trade in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In the PM's 2006 reshuffle, he was appointed as Minister of State for Climate Change and Environment at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. In an interview with The Guardian published on 5 January 2007, Pearson courted considerable controversy by publicly criticising several airlines, particularly Ryanair, for failing to pull their weight in lowering UK carbon emissions. He described Ryanair as \\"the irresponsible face of capitalism\\". In response, Michael O'Leary, the CEO of Ryanair, claimed Ryanair had made a considerable investment in environmentally friendly planes and technologies and had the lowest fuel use per passenger figures of any British airline. O'Leary described Pearson as \\"silly\\", adding that Pearson \\"hadn't a clue what he [was] talking about\\". On 29 June 2007, Pearson was moved in Gordon Brown's first reshuffle to become a Minister of State in the newly created Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills under Secretary of State John Denham. Whilst there he was criticised for not doing anything to avert the current funding crisis at the Science and Technology Facilities Council hitting UK Astronomy and particle physics. In Gordon Brown's next reshuffle of 3 October 2008, Pearson was moved to the Treasury as Economic Secretary, also becoming Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Economics and Business. In the June 2009 reshuffle Pearson retained his role at the Treasury but lost his business role as the department was merged to create the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. On 21 January 2010, Pearson announced that he would not contest the next general election.

It was commanded by Lieutenant General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders and fought with distinction in the Italian Campaign, in particular at the Battle of Monte Cassino. By the end of 1945, the corps had grown to well over 100,000 soldiers. History Victims of Soviet deportations from occupied Poland in 1939‚Äì40 had been processed by the NKVD and sent to prison or exile in Siberia.Davies, p. 448 The Nazi-Soviet pact of August 1939RobertsVincent effectively ended on 22 June 1941 when the German Wehrmacht invaded the USSR.Davies, p. 444, 453 The release of many thousands of former citizens of Poland (including Ukrainians and Belorussians) from the Soviet Gulags, following the signing of the Polish-Russian Military Agreement on 14 August 1941, allowed for the creation of a Polish Army on Soviet soil.Stefancic, p. 157, 159Davies, p. 272 Its first commander, General Micha≈Ç Tokarzewski, began the task of forming this army in the Soviet town of Totskoye on 17 August. The commander ultimately chosen by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski to lead the new army, Lieutenant General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders, had just been released from the Lubyanka prison in Moscow, on 4 August, and did not issue his first orders or announce his appointment as commander until 22 August. This army grew over the following two years and provided the bulk of the units and troops of the Polish II Corps. The Polish II Corps was created in 1943 from various units fighting alongside the Allies in all theatres of war. The 3rd Carpathian Rifle Division was formed in the Middle East from smaller Polish units fighting in Egypt and Tobruk, as well as the Polish Army in the East that was evacuated from the Soviet Union through the Persian Corridor. Its creation was based on the British Allied Forces Act 1940, which allowed the Allied units of the exiled government of Poland to be grouped in one theatre of war. However, the British High Command never agreed to incorporate the exiled Polish Air Force into the Corps. In February 1944, the Polish II Corps was transferred from Egypt to Italy, where it became an independent part of the British Eighth Army, under Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese. During 1944‚Äì45, the Corps fought with distinction in the Italian campaign, during the fourth and final Battle of Monte Cassino in May 1944, the Battle of Ancona during Operation Olive (the fighting on the Gothic Line in September 1944), and the Battle of Bologna during the final offensive in Italy in March 1945.

Height 1210, north of Rionero in Vulture. In 1944, the Polish II Corps numbered about 50,000 soldiers. During three subsequent battles, it suffered heavy losses (in the final stage of the Battle of Monte Cassino, even the support units were mobilised and used in combat) and it was suggested to General Anders that he withdraw his units. However, since the Soviet Union broke off diplomatic relations with the Polish government and no Poles were allowed out of the USSR, Anders believed that the only source of recruits lay ahead ‚Äì in German POW camps and concentration camps. By 1945, new units were added, composed mainly of freed POWs and Poles forcibly conscripted into the Wehrmacht. This increased the Corps' strength to around 75,000 men, approximately 20,000 of whom were transferred to other Polish units fighting in the West. After the war, the divisions of the Corps were used in Italy until 1946, when they were transported to Britain and demobilised. The total establishment of the Polish II Corps in 1946 was 103,000. The majority of soldiers remained in exile and settled in Britain. The Corps had a consistently high fighting reputation and was well-regarded by the American and Commonwealth troops with whom they fought. Those that settled in Britain were transported from many ports, including Toulon, France. Composition In May 1945, the Corps consisted of 55,780 men and approximately 1,500 women in auxiliary services. There was also a bear mascot, named Wojtek, who was officially entered onto the unit roll as a private soldier, subsequently being promoted to corporal. The majority of the Corps were Polish citizens who had been deported by the NKVD to the Soviet Gulags during the Soviet Union's annexation of Eastern Poland (Kresy Wschodnie) in 1939. Following Operation Barbarossa and the Sikorski-Mayski Agreement, many of them were released and allowed to join the Polish Armed Forces in the East being formed in Southern Russia and Kazakhstan. For political reasons, the Soviet Union soon withdrew support for the creation of a Polish Army on its territory and reduced the supply rate, which resulted in General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders withdrawing his troops to British-held Persia and Iraq. From there, they were moved to British-controlled Palestine, where they joined forces with the 3rd Carpathian Division, which was composed mainly of Polish soldiers who had managed to escape to French Lebanon through Romania and Hungary after the defeat of Poland in 1939. The main bulk of the soldiers were from the eastern voivodeships of pre-war Poland. Although the majority were ethnic Poles, there were also other nationalities, including Jews, Belarusians and Ukrainians. After being relocated to Palestine, many Jewish soldiers deserted and fled into the countryside. However, Menachem Begin - the future Prime Minister of Israel and at the time a II Corps soldier - though urged by his friends to desert, refused to remove his uniform until he had been officially discharged.

R.\\" Smith (September 9, 1899 ‚Äì April 4, 1990) was the CEO of American Airlines from 1934 to 1968 and from 1973 to 1974. He was also the wartime deputy commander of the Air Transport Command, and United States Secretary of Commerce for a brief period under President Lyndon B. Johnson. He is regarded as one of the titans of U.S. airline history. Early life and business career Smith was born on September 9, 1899, in Minerva, Texas, located in Milam County, to Roy Edgerton Smith and the former Marion Burck. Smith attended the University of Texas despite never having graduated from high school. Upon his graduation, Smith worked as an accountant for the accounting firm of Peat Marwick Mitchell and later ran a number of businesses, including a Western apparel store and a firm that sold state records of new mothers to manufacturers of baby supplies. Smith's abilities were first recognized by Texas industrialist Alva Pearl Barrett, who in 1928 set up the airline Texas Air Transport (TAT), which became Southern Air Transport. Smith joined SAT as a vice president in 1929, and through a series of mergers SAT became part of American Airlines. American's owner, E. L. Cord, hired Smith to run the nationwide network based on his able management of Southern operation. In 1934, he became president of American Airlines. In business, he was known for an informal, no-nonsense leadership style that stressed close relationships with both executives and employees. Convair president Jack Naish noted that \\"you can close a $100 million deal on his word alone.\\" He generally communicated through personally typed one-page memos. Smith was said to know every American employee by name until the end of his first term as CEO. He fostered a close relationship with Douglas Aircraft that led American to become a key adopter of the Douglas DC-3 and DC-6: he was also one of the early proponents of what is now LaGuardia Airport in New York City. One of Smith's most famous acts was the publication of an advertisement entitled \\"Why Dodge This Question: Afraid To Fly?\\" in 1934. Airline safety had been a taboo subject at the time, and Smith was credited with being the first airline manager to discuss it openly with the public. With the outbreak of World War II, Smith left American to become a colonel in the United States Army Air Forces, eventually rising to the rank of major general in the Air Transport Command; he immediately left the AAF in 1945 and returned to his airline. Due to his informal but results-oriented management style, Smith won high praise during the War. Referring to Smith and ATC commander General Harold George, General Henry Arnold, the chief of the Air Forces, wrote that \\"no matter what mission I gave them, I could count on its being carried out 100%\\".Arnold: Global Mission, p.295. It did not hurt that Smith was close friend with the first family, and Eleanor Roosevelt would habitually call on him for travel arrangements. In 1946, Smith began to break Pan American's monopoly in international air travel through American Overseas Airlines, leading to American's expansion overseas. He also set up the Admirals Club, the first airline lounge system. In the 1950s, he helped American become the first domestic jet carrier in the US by selecting the Boeing 707 aircraft, which came out months before its rival Douglas DC-8. Political career Smith was exceptionally well-connected politically, beginning with a Fort Worth and Texas base. He was close friends with many prominent Texan politicians, including Lyndon B. Johnson, Jesse Jones and Sam Rayburn. Smith was also on very close terms with the Roosevelt family, especially Eleanor Roosevelt and her son Elliott Roosevelt. C.R. introduced Elliott to his second wife, served as best man, and persuaded him to move to Fort Worth. In 1933, seeing that Eleanor (who never would speak up for herself) was often inconvenienced on her travels, Smith decided to always fly along with her on American Airlines to ensure her comfort. Smith was instrumental in lobbying for the FAA to implement a mandatory retirement age of 60 for commercial airline pilots in large part because he was eager to remove older, expensive pilots from his cockpits and replace them with young men who would work for lower salaries and, he was convinced, would be easier to retrain for the new jet engine-based airliners, as there was some anecdotal evidence suggesting that older pilots on average took longer to adjust to the new jet airliners which had very different control characteristics than piston-engined planes. In addition, this measure would save on training costs since most younger pilots at that time had experience piloting aircraft in World War II and the Korean War. The age 60 retirement rule was publicly justified on the grounds that pilots might experience health issues past the age of 60 and that contemporary medical science was not advanced enough to test for them. This rule remained in effect from 1960 until 2007 when Congress voted to raise it to 65 on the grounds that the age 60 rule was outdated and it was now much easier to screen pilots for potential health risks. In addition, Congress asked the FAA to present clear, definitive scientific evidence that a pilot of 64 was more unsafe than a pilot of 59, which they could not do. As a small compromise, it was agreed that at least one person in the cockpit must be under 60. Mandatory retirement for airline pilots had first been proposed in the early 1950s. Commercial aviation at this time was only about 30 years old and many pilots who had begun their careers as young men in the 1920s were passing the age of 50. Some airlines, including American, had begun implementing forced retirement on their own initiatives, although others such as Delta Airlines opposed it. In April 1959, Air Line Pilot Magazine reported that Captain Deke DeLong of Northwest Airlines had just retired at 65, making him the oldest active commercial pilot in the nation, and that an estimated forty other pilots aged 60 and up were still active. Matters came to a head over three veteran American Airlines pilots, Captains Robert Rentz, Ernie Cutrell, and James Burns, all of whom had been flying for over 30 years and who were nearly deified figures in the aviation community. Their long list of accomplishments ended up having no bearing on C.R. Smith's decisions and the trio of pilots were summarily forced into retirement. Retired Air Force Lieutenant General and FAA chairman Elwood Quesada was a strong supporter of Smith's lobbying for the age 60 rule, although his suggestion that only pilots with military experience be allowed to fly jetliners was not taken up. After resigning as FAA chairman in 1961, Quesada was rewarded with a seat on American Airlines' board of directors. Smith's friendship with Lyndon Johnson was the principal reason for his accession to the Cabinet, and he became the U.S. Secretary of Commerce following the resignation of Alexander B. Trowbridge. Smith served until the age of 69, from March 1968, until January 1969. However, he often clashed with the civil service because of his aversion to bureaucracy: on his first day, he objected to having four secretaries and asked that three of them be fired. This culture shock caused him to leave his post early and enter a first retirement. Smith left American in 1968. He returned in 1973, following a period of corporate mismanagement and scandal, although he retired again less than a year later, stating that he was \\"working in a 747 era with a DC-6 state of mind.\\" In 1976, Smith was the recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation. Death and honors C. R. Smith's grandfather clock at the American Airlines C.R. Smith Museum Smith died from a lengthy illness in Annapolis, Maryland, on April 4, 1990, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. The American Airlines C. R. Smith Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, is named after him. Smith was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1976. He was also the 1976 recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for distinguished achievement in commercial air transportation. In 1992 he was inducted into the Airlift/Tanker Association Hall of Fame. In 1996, Smith was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame.

His works include: *Chants populaires de l'Italie (1865) *Vita tristis, Reveries fantastiques, Romances sans musique (1865) *Melancholia (1868) *Le Livre du n√©ant (1872) *Henry Regnault, sa vie et son ≈ìuvre (1872) *L'Illusion (1875-1893) *Cantique des cantiques (1885) *Les Quatrains d'Al-Gazali (1896) *William Morris (1897). The author of the Livre du n√©ant had a predilection for gloomy subjects and especially for pictures of death. His oriental habits of thought earned for him the title of the Hindou du Parnasse contemporain (cf. Le Parnasse contemporain). Some of his poems have been set to music by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, Henri Duparc, Charles Bordes, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn, Edouard Tr√©misot and Paul Paray. He also maintained a correspondence of interest with the poet St√©phane Mallarm√© from 1862 to 1871.

George Santayana's Poetry and Religion (1900) has an essay on his concept of La gloire du n√©ant. Danse Macabre Saint-Sa√´ns' Danse Macabre (Dance of Death) is based on this poem written by Henri Cazalis. Zig, zig, zig, Death in cadence, Striking with his heel a tomb, Death at midnight plays a dance-tune, Zig, zig, zig, on his violin. The winter wind blows and the night is dark; Moans are heard in the linden-trees. Through the gloom, white skeletons pass, Running and leaping in their shrouds. Zig, zig, zig, each one is frisking. The bones of the dancers are heard to crack- But hist! of a sudden they quit the round, They push forward, they fly; the cock has crowed.

The population is 300,911 (2017 est.) in an area of 581 km¬≤.Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica The elevation is 588 m. It is 154 km from S√£o Paulo, the state capital, and 1011 km from Brasilia, Brazil's capital. The city can be easily reached from S√£o Paulo by two highways: Rodovia Anhanguera and Rodovia dos Bandeirantes. Once an important and strategical pole of the coffee culture, Limeira was also known as the \\"Brazilian orange capital\\" due to the great citrus production that occurred in the past, although now the main crop cultivated in the city is the sugar cane. Afterwards, it became recognized by its new plated jewelry and semi-jewelry industry which attract customers from all over the world, giving the city the title of \\"Brazil's plated jewelry capital\\". There are more than 450 companies that are responsible for half of Brazil's exports in this sector. There is a famous farm located in Limeira, Fazenda Ibicaba, that belonged to Nicolau de Campos Vergueiro, who brought the first immigrants from Europe, especially from Germany, Portugal, Switzerland and Belgium, to replace the enslaved African- Brazilian workers, which was basically a government effort to \\"bleach\\" the race, as it was feared Brazil would become a \\"black country\\". Limeira is thus said to have accomplished the first positive experience with immigrant workers in Brazil. Probably because Northern Europeans preferred to run their own farms rather than to subject themselves to indentured work and the Portuguese tended to work in commerce, Italian immigrants were brought to work the fields. Such immigrant groups were greater in numbers than all the others all over S√£o Paulo state. Northern Europeans and the first Italians to arrive in the country often came with the promise of being granted lands in exchange for their work, but the last ones were treated socially only better than the slaves themselves. The latter, nonetheless, had nowhere to go for jobs as slavery ended and many begged to be rehired for food. The situation of some of them improved when the British installed the railway in the country and gave them prestigious jobs with housing. Today, Limeira is located in a prosperous region in S√£o Paulo State. A.A. Internacional is a traditional football club based in Limeira, along with Independente F.C. The city's biggest stadium is the Major Jos√© Levy Sobrinho stadium, built in 1977. The city's basketball team is Associa√ß√£o Limeirense de Basquete, which plays in the Novo Basquete Brasil and the Liga Sudamericana. Its home arena is the Gin√°sio \\"V√¥\\" Lucato. History The history of Limeira begins with the economic exploitation in the state of S√£o Paulo, more precisely in mid-1826, which marks the founding of the region of Limeira. But also includes a period before this year involving a legend which tries to explain the origin of the current name of the city. Legendary origin The origin of the name involves a popular myth enshrined in its population. Tradition says that the pioneers used to rest in a guesthouse-situated 150 km from S√£o Paulo, around the river Tatuibi, which the name in Tupi-Guarani means small armadillo. This landing was called Blue Hill Ranch (Rancho Morro Azul) since it was near an elevation that in the distance is seen in shades of blue. It is said that in 1781 a caravan was headed to the wilds of Araraquara and while passing through Limeira, camped near the stream of the Bladder ‚Äì C√≥rrego do Bexiga (where today is the Market Model). In this caravan there was a Franciscan, Fr. Jo√£o das Merc√™s, which carried a picu√° de limas (a kind of lime orange), which claimed to cure and prevent fevers. But at night he began to feel ill, blaming the limas which he said had been poisoned. Eventually he died during the night and the next day he would have been buried there, along with his Picu√° de Lima's that no one wanted to eat because could be poisoned, as he said. Then there would have sprung a lime tree, born from the limes of the Fr. Jo√£o das Merc√™s. Years later, the Blue Hill Ranch (Rancho do Morro Azul) would be called the Ranch of the Lime Orange Tree (Rancho de Limeira).History of Limeira on Cityhall Website Historical facts Limeira came in cleared land near the path known as the Picad√£o de Cuiab√°, road flow of troops who were trading and sourcing supplies to the mines of Mato Grosso. Ibicaba Farm during 19th century From the observation of standard trees (indicating the fertility of the land) that existed along the road in still virgin lands, planters and noble farmers that were living in ‚ÄòCidade da Constitui√ß√£o‚Äô (town of the Constitution, today Piracicaba), Itu, Porto Feliz and Atibaia, know where the best lands were and managed to gain allotments from the provincial government. This occurred from 1799 to 1820 in the region. The beginning of the village took place then with the installation of mills, the coming of slaveholders and slaves and also with the expulsion of squatters who had in the area. It is possible to observe that, by the census of 1822, in the Town of New Constitution (Piracicaba), the region of Morro Azul and Tatuibi (both Limeira) had a population of 951 free people and 546 slaves. The roads that link these properties to the capital were precarious making Nicolau Pereira de Campos Vergueiro to lead a group of farmers like Manuel Bento de Barros, Jos√© Ferraz de Campos and others to ask the provincial government to construct a road that facilitates the flow of production of the mills in the region of Piracicaba and Limeira. This road was opened in 1826, while around it came a housing project, the Freguesia de Nossa Senhora das Dores do Tatuibi (Parish of Our Lady of Sorrows of Tatuibi), formalized by provincial law on December 9, 1930.IBGE: Hist√≥ria de Limeira The traffic of the road facilitated the growth of trade and other activities and marks the founding of the municipality of Limeira. The core was built on land donated by Captain Luis Manuel Bastos da Cunha, he is considered the founder of the city. In 1842 the region was elevated to village, but only in 1844 the city council land was installed and Limeira gained its first president, Manuel Jos√© de Carvalho. Limeira was elevated to city on April 18, 1863. On April 20, 1875 it was created the county of Limeira. Officially, the city's anniversary is September 15 and it is considered to be founded in 1826. Origin of the private-sponsored European immigration Limeira is one of the first cities in Brazil to receive private-sponsored European immigration. Through the pioneering effort undertaken by the then owner of the Mill Ibicaba in 1840, Nicolau Pereira de Campos Vergueiro (known as Senator Vergueiro), eighty Portuguese came to work on its lands. This was the first positive experience in developing the partnership system in Brazil. The immigrants would replace the slave labor, still in use at this time, but they would receive benefits, unlike the slaves. In 1846, Germans came to work in Ibicaba and Senator Vergueiro became an important figure in replacement of slave labor with free European labor. The farm Ibicaba was during a period the largest producer of coffee in Brazil. Today it is an important historical ensemble formed by its headquarters, slave quarters, terraces, dams and other facilities as part of the set of the city's historic farms.  Climate  Limeira experiences a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cwa), with distinctive wet and dry seasons lasting from October to March and from April to September, respectively, and warm to hot temperatures year-round. The average temperature is 19.8 ¬∞C (67.6 ¬∞F) and yearly precipitation stands at 1300.5 mm (51.2 in). In 17 October 2014, temperatures in the city reached a record high of 38.6 ¬∞C (101.4 ¬∞F) and its coldest day was 9 July 2011, with a low of 0.1 ¬∞C (32.1 ¬∞F). Industry By the year of 1850, agricultural equipment started to be produced in Limeira and during the Paraguayan War instruments to the soldiers were also produced. Between the years of 1907 and 1922 important industries, such as 'Chap√©us Prada' (1907), 'Caf√© K√ºhl' (1920) and 'Ind√∫stria de Papel Santa Cruz' (1922) started their production in Limeira. However, it was after the 1940s that Limeira became well known for its industry. The old industry building of Chap√©us Prada, now Limeira's City Hall Between the 1940s and 1970s many citrus companies started producing orange and orange juice in Limeira to export to inside and outside of Brazil, including to USA and Europe, this commerce gave to the city the title of 'The City of Orange'. Citrobrasil (1940) and Citrosuco (1966) were the biggest companies in Limeira in orange production, however when the United States started its policy to protect and encourage the nacional industry of orange in California, the production of orange in Limeira collapsed. Also after the Second World War the automotive industries took place in the city with 'Freios Varga' (today TRW) in 1945 and 'Rodas Fumagalli' in 1946. After the 1970s, the industrial section area started to grow faster and some multinational companies came to Limeira, such as: Ajinomoto; the American company Rockwell bought Fumagalli in 1974, and 'Freios Varga' joined the English Group Lucas in 2000. Recently, some Japanese and Korean automotive companies have settled in Limeira, for example: Yacchyio do Brasil, Stanley, Mando, DAS and Faurecia, which is a French company that has been building a new plant in the city. Recently, Samsung invested U$300 million in building an industry in Limeira.Valor Econ√¥mico article Limeira is also known for its new plated jewelry and semi-jewelry industry which attract customers from all over the world, giving the city the title of \\"Brazil's plated jewelry capital.\\" There are more than 450 companies that are responsible for half of Brazil's exportation in this sector. The city has been trying to become more attractive to industries related to incentive programs. This policy tries to reduce the unemployment and the informal jobs, which has been growing together with its population. Part of the population works in cities nearby, including Piracicaba and Americana. According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), Limeira has a GDP of R$5.6 billion (2010), around U$3.6 billion.Gazeta de Limeira article based on IBGE database The industrial sector accounts for approximately 50% of registered jobs in the city. Thus, Limeira took its industrial vocation with its incentive program, which guided the development and implementation of its current industrial park. The city has a number of favorable conditions for their development, such as the extension of Highway Bandeirantes (Rodovia dos Bandeirantes), the implementation of the Tiet√™-Paran√° waterway, and the installation of the Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline.Cityhall official website: Information about Limeira's Industry All these factors, combined with their potential and possibilities, specified multiple paths for the development of the industrial sector of the city: * Limeira is inserted in the Campinas region, an area marked by a strong industrial concentration and has a GDP that is larger than many states in the country, such as Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul, for example. * In the formal economy has approximately 1,000 industries, employing more than 22,000 registered employees, with a significant share of skilled labor. The size of the business is diversified, with a production quite varied, including brake systems, automotive wheels, exhausts, metal products, machinery for processing of agricultural products, paper and cardboard packaging, hats, and more. Limeira also has the largest concentration of production of machine tools in Latin America and the largest sugar refining industry in South America. However, the main segment that has been standing out in the city after the 1990s is to jewelry and lapidary stones, consisting mainly of micro and small businesses with family investment. Currently, the largest industries in operation are: * Ajinomoto Interamericana Ind. Com. Ltda. - Food * CPkelco, Huber Co. - Chemical, food, Citrus * ZF/TRW - Brakes - Truck and Car steering systems * Invicta - Machine tools for wood * Mastra Ind√∫stria e Com√©rcio - Automotive Exhaust System * Metal Leve S.A.

The implementation of the Shopping Center, in the 1980s, along the Rodovia Anhanguera (Anhanguera Road), came to further boost the development of the tertiary sector in the city. Allied to this and following the world trend of globalization and outsourcing observed the emergence of many companies included in the modernization process, which now act as support for the industries of the city. After the 1990s, the mall closed, but there is still a shopping mall located in downtown (Shopping Patio Limeira). By the end of 2012 Another two malls will probably be operating, one on Piracicaba road and other on Anhanguera Road. In the area of public services, Limeira presents itself as home to several organizations and government agencies in regional performance as the Caixa Economica Federal, Delegacia da Receita Federal, IBGE, CETESB, Delegacia de Ensino do Estado, Inspetoria Fiscal da Secretaria da Fazenda do Estado, Comando da Pol√≠cia Militar and Secretary of Agriculture of the State of S√£o Paulo; there is also private institutions, such as CIESP, SENAI, SESI, SENAC e JUCESP. The main concern is the competition around the city. There is a big competition from neighbor cities because of diversity, variety and comfort. Sometimes, people prefer to travel to Campinas or Piracicaba for consumption.

The sugar cane production reaches more than 1 million tons per year and citrus (orange, lemon and tangerine), more than 1.4 billion units. On a smaller scale for production there are avocados, corn, rice and beans. The city is considered the first producer of S√£o Paulo citrus industry, and it is recognized by its production of seedlings, especially citrus. During the last three decades Limeira gained a large center of commerce of plants and seedlings on Geada, located on Limeira-Piracicaba Road, approximately km 120.

R. Tambo, was a South African anti-apartheid politician and revolutionary who served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) from 1967 to 1991. Biography=Early life Oliver Tambo was born on (27 October 1917) in the village of Nkantolo in Bizana; eastern Pondoland in what is now the Eastern Cape. The village Tambo was born in was made up mostly of farmers. His father, Mzimeni Tambo, was the son of a farmer and an assistant salesperson at a local trading store. Mzimeni had four wives and ten children, all of whom were literate. Oliver's mother, Mzimeni's third wife, was called Julia. Tambo came from a stable family in which his father's children had to have a good education. He attended Anglican and Methodist missionary schools, including Holy Cross missionary school with his brother in April 1928. After five years at the Holy Cross, Tambo excelled in his studies and transferred to St. Peter's in Johannesburg. Tambo graduated in 1938 as one of the top students. After this, Tambo was admitted to the University of Fort Hare but in 1940 he, along with several others including Nelson Mandela, was expelled for participating in a student strike. In 1942, Tambo returned to his former high school in Johannesburg to teach science and mathematics. League In 1943, Tambo, Mandela and Walter Sisulu founded the ANC Youth League, with Tambo becoming its first National Secretary and a member of the National Executive in 1948. The Youth League proposed a change in the tactics of the anti- apartheid movement. Previously, the ANC had sought to further its cause by actions such as petitions and demonstrations; the Youth League felt these actions were insufficient to achieve the group's goals and proposed their own \\"Programme of Action\\". This programme advocated tactics such as boycotts, civil disobedience, strikes, and non-collaboration. Tambo being greeted on arrival in East Germany (1978) In 1955, Tambo became Secretary-general of the ANC after Sisulu was banned by the South African government under the Suppression of Communism Act. In 1958, he became Deputy President of the ANC and in 1959 was served with a five-year banning order by the government. Exile in London In response, Tambo was sent abroad by the ANC to mobilise opposition to apartheid. He settled with his family in Muswell Hill, north London, where he lived until 1990. His exile took a toll on him not seeing his wife and three children, but his wife Adelaide supported the ANC at home by taking in ANC members arriving from the UK.Oliver Tambo: the exile, The Independent, 15 October 2007. In 1967, Tambo became Acting President of the ANC, following the death of Chief Albert Lutuli. He sought to keep the ANC together even after he was exiled from South Africa. Due to his skillful lobbying, he was able to attract talented South African exiles, one of them being Thabo Mbeki. On 30 December 1979 in Lusaka, Zambia, Tambo as President and Alfred Nzo, then Secretary-general of the ANC, met Tim Jenkin, Stephen Lee and Alex Moumbaris, ANC members and escapees from incarceration at Phillip kgosi prison as political prisoners. Their presence was officially announced by the ANC in early January and Tambo introduced them at a press conference on 2 January 1980. Guerrilla activity Tambo was directly responsible for organizing active guerilla units. Along with his comrades Nelson Mandela, Joe Slovo, and Walter Sisulu, Tambo directed and facilitated several attacks against the apartheid state. In a 1985 interview, Tambo was quoted as saying, \\"In the past, we were saying the ANC will not deliberately take innocent life. But now, looking at what is happening in South Africa, it is difficult to say civilians are not going to die.\\" The post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 1997-1998 identified Tambo as the person who gave final approval for the 20 May 1983 Church Street bombing, which resulted in the death of 19 people and injuries to 197-217 people. The attack was orchestrated by a special operations unit of the ANC's Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), commanded by Aboobaker Ismail. Such units had been authorised by Tambo as President of the ANC in 1979. At the time of the attack, they reported to Joe Slovo as chief of staff. The ANC's submission said that the bombing was in response to a South African cross-border raid into Lesotho in December 1982 which killed 42 ANC supporters and civilians, and the assassination of Ruth First, an ANC activist and wife of Joe Slovo, in Maputo, Mozambique. It claimed that 11 of the casualties were SADF personnel and hence a military target. The legal representative of some of the victims argued that as they were administrative staff, including telephonists and typists, they could not be considered a legitimate military target. Ten MK operatives, including Ismail, applied for amnesty for this and other bombings. The applications were opposed on various grounds, including that it was a terrorist attack disproportionate to the political motive. The TRC found that the number of civilians versus military personnel killed was unclear. South African Police statistics indicated that seven members of the SADF were killed. The commission found that at least 84 of the injured were SADF members or employees. Amnesty was granted by the TRC. In 1985, he was re-elected President of the ANC. Return to South Africa He returned to South Africa on 13 December 1990 after over 30 years in exile, after having been elected National Chairperson of the ANC in July of the same year. He was able to return to South Africa because of the legalization of the ANC. When he returned after his time in exile he received much support. Some of that support even came from old rivals. However, because of his stroke in 1989. It was harder for him to fulfill his duties as President of the ANC, so in 1991 Nelson Mandela took over as president of the ANC. When he stepped down as president, however, the congress created a special position for him as the National Chairman. Death After suffering complications following a stroke, Tambo died on April 24, 1993 at the age of 75. His death came 14 days after Chris Hani's assassination and one year prior to the 1994 general election in which Nelson Mandela became the President of South Africa. Mandela, Thabo Mbeki and Walter Sisulu attended the funeral. Tambo was buried in Benoni, Gauteng. International relationships The strong fight against apartheid brought Tambo to form a series of intense international relationships. In 1977, Tambo signed the first solidarity agreement between the ANC and a municipality: the Italian town of Reggio Emilia was the first city in the world to sign such a pact of solidarity. This was the beginning of a long understanding which brought Italy to put an effort into concrete actions to support the right of southern African people's self-determination; one of these actions was the organization of solidarity ships. The first one, called \\"Amanda\\", departed from Genova in 1980. It was Tambo himself who asked Reggio Emilia to mint Isitwalandwe Medals, the greatest of the ANC's honors. Honours Johannesburg International Airport In 2004, he was voted number 31 in SABC3's Great South Africans, scoring lower than H. F. Verwoerd, before the SABC decided to cancel the final rounds of voting. The decision to cancel the results was largely informed by the fact that the majority of blacks South Africans did not participate in the voting, as SABC3 caters predominantly to English speakers. In late 2005, ANC politicians announced plans to rename Johannesburg International Airport after him.Also Thabo Mbeki at this time did not side with this idea and there was a behind closed door meeting deliberating on this. The proposal was accepted and the renaming ceremony occurred on 27 October 2006. The ANC-dominated government had previously renamed Jan Smuts Airport as Johannesburg International Airport in 1994 on the grounds that South African airports should not be named after political figures. There is a bust of O. R. Tambo at the Albert Road Recreation Ground, Muswell Hill, outside the Alexandra Park School. In June 2013, the city of Reggio Emilia (Italy) celebrated Tambo with the creation of a park dedicated to the President of the African National Congress. His house at 51 Alexandra Park Road, Muswell Hill, London, was purchased by the South African Government in 2010 as a historic monument and now bears a plaque. Tambo's grave was declared a National Heritage site when he died but lost this status when his wife, Adelaide Tambo, died and was buried alongside him. However their grave was re-declared a National Heritage site in October 2012. To conclude the centenary celebrations of the birth of Tambo, a commemoration was held at Regina Mundi Catholic Church in Moroka, Soweto on 27 October 2017. This same event marked also the centenary of the sinking of the troopship SS Mendi. The event was curated by Ambassador Lindiwe Mabuza and Fr Lawrence Mduduzi Ndlovu, together with the Thabo Mbeki Foundation and the Oliver and Adelaide Tambo Foundation. Participating choirs were the Imilonji kaNtu Choral Society, Johannesburg Metro Police Choir and Ekurhuleni Metro Police Choir. The soloist of the day was Sibongile Khumalo.

The film's original advertising used \\"Die Harder\\" as a tagline, and many releases of the film (e.g. the 2006 DVD release and 2007 Blu-ray release) were marketed under the title Die Hard 2: Die Harder. is a 1990 American action-thriller film and the second installment in the Die Hard film series. The film was released on July 4, 1990 in the United States. The film was directed by Renny Harlin, written by Steven E. deSouza and Doug Richardson and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane. The film co-stars Bonnie Bedelia, William Sadler, Art Evans, William Atherton, Franco Nero, Dennis Franz, Fred Thompson, John Amos and Reginald VelJohnson. The screenplay was adapted from Walter Wager's 1987 novel 58 Minutes. The novel has the same plot but differs slightly: a cop must stop terrorists who take an airport hostage while his wife's plane circles overhead, and has 58 minutes to do so before the plane crashes. Roderick Thorp, who wrote the 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever, upon which Die Hard was based, receives credit for creating \\"certain original characters\\", although his name is misspelled onscreen as \\"Roderick Thorpe\\". As with the first film, the action in Die Hard 2 takes place on Christmas Eve. McClane is waiting for his wife to land at Washington Dulles International Airport when terrorists take over the air traffic control system. He must stop the terrorists before his wife's plane and several other incoming flights that are circling the airport run out of fuel and crash. During the night, McClane must also contend with airport police and a military commander, none of whom want his assistance. The film was preceded by Die Hard (1988) and followed by Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007), and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013). Plot On Christmas Eve 1990, two years after the Nakatomi Tower Incident, former New York city police officer John McClane is now working for the Los Angeles police department and is waiting at Washington Dulles International Airport for his wife Holly to arrive from Los Angeles. Reporter Richard Thornburg, who exposed Holly's identity to Hans Gruber in the Nakatomi Tower, is assigned a seat across the aisle from her. In the airport bar, McClane observes two men in Army fatigues behaving suspiciously and pursues them into the baggage area. After a shootout, McClane kills one of them, Oswald Cochrane, while the other escapes. Learning that Cochrane was believed to have been killed in action while serving in Honduras, McClane relates the situation to airport police captain Carmine Lorenzo, who bluntly dismisses his concerns. Former U.S. Special Forces Colonel William Stuart and other former members of his unit establish a base in a church near Dulles. They hack into the air traffic control systems, sever communication with the planes, and deactivate the runway lights, leaving Dulles ATC powerless to land aircraft. Their goal is to rescue General Ramon Esperanza, a drug lord and dictator of Val Verde, who is being extradited to the United States to stand trial on drug trafficking charges. They demand a Boeing 747 cargo plane so they can escape to another country with Esperanza in tow, and warn the airport controllers not to try to restore control. With his wife on one of the planes circling above Washington, D.C. with too little fuel to be redirected, McClane prepares to fight the terrorists, allying himself with a janitor, Marvin, to gain larger access to the airport. Dulles communications director Leslie Barnes heads to an unfinished antenna array with a SWAT team to re-establish communications with the planes but are ambushed by Stuart's henchmen and the SWAT team is killed in the ensuing firefight. McClane rescues Barnes and kills Stuart's men. Stuart retaliates by recalibrating the instrument landing system and then impersonating air traffic controllers to crash a British jetliner, killing everyone on board. A U.S. Army Special Forces team led by Major Grant is called in. By listening in on a two-way radio that was dropped by one of Stuart's henchmen, McClane finds out that Esperanza, having killed his captors and now piloting the plane carrying him to Dulles, is landing. With Marvin's aid, McClane reaches the aircraft before Stuart's henchmen. Trapping him in the cockpit, the mercenaries throw in grenades, but McClane escapes via the ejection seat seconds before the grenades detonate. Barnes helps McClane locate the mercenaries' hideout, and they tell Grant and his team to raid the location, but the mercenaries escape on snowmobiles. McClane pursues them but is stunned to discover the mercenaries' guns are loaded with blanks, concluding that the Special Forces team are in fact Stuart's subordinates. McClane demands Lorenzo intercept the Boeing 747 in which the mercenaries will escape; Lorenzo refuses to listen until an extremely fed up McClane fires at the Captain with the blank gun, thus proving his story. Aboard Holly's flight, a suspicious Thornburg is monitoring airport radio traffic and learns about the situation from a secret transmission to the circling planes from Barnes. He phones in a sensational and exaggerated take on what is happening, leading to panic and preventing the officers from reaching the escape plane, until Holly subdues Thornburg with a stun gun. McClane hitches a ride on a news helicopter that drops him off on the wing of the taxiing mercenaries' 747. He jams the left inboard aileron with his jacket, preventing the plane from taking off. Grant fights McClane, but is knocked off the wing and falls into an engine, killing him. Stuart succeeds in knocking McClane off the plane and removing McClane's jacket, but fails to notice that McClane had opened the fuel hatch.

Production and promotion Die Hard 2 was the first film to use digitally composited live-action footage with a traditional matte painting that had been photographed and scanned into a computer. It was used for the last scene, which took place on a runway. One of the writers of the screenplay, Steven E. de Souza, later admitted in an interview for the book Action Speaks Louder: Violence, Spectacle, and the American Action Movie that the villains were based on America's \\"Central American\\" meddling, primarily the Iran‚ÄìContra affair.Action Speaks Louder: Violence, Spectacle, and the American Action Movie, page 165 Of the film's budget, Bruce Willis was paid $7.5 million for reprising his role for the film. Reception=Box office The film exceeded all expectations by outdoing the massive box office success of Die Hard. The film had a $62‚Äì70 million budget and had a wide release in 2,507 theaters, making $21.7 million its opening weekend. Die Hard 2 domestically made $117.5 million, and $122.5 million internationally, earning over $240 million worldwide, almost doubling that of Die Hard. The film was re-released internationally in 1993 and made $216,339 more, which totaled its gross to $240.2 million. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 6.15/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"It lacks the fresh thrills of its predecessor, but Die Hard 2 still works as an over-the-top ‚Äì and reasonably taut ‚Äì big-budget sequel, with plenty of set pieces to paper over the plot deficiencies.\\" On the review aggregator Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert, who gave the original film a mixed review, described the sequel as \\"terrific entertainment\\", despite noting substantial credibility problems with the plot. Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel dubbed the film as being as disappointing a sequel as Another 48 Hrs. and RoboCop 2, and said, > Whatever small pleasure there is to be found in this loud dud is due mostly > to the residual good feelings from the first film... As played by Bruce > Willis, McClane is still an engaging character, even if he is much less > amusingly drawn this time. Willis is in there trying, but the qualities that > helped to make his character sympathetic in the first film are missing. > McClane no longer worries openly about his personal safety, as he did in the > original movie. His quasi-cowboy personality from Die Hard is all but > forgotten ‚Äì he has become more of a Rambo and less of a Roy Rogers. And > though the filmmakers try to establish McClane as resistant to advanced > technology, this promising idea isn't developed. Empire magazine rated the film three out of five stars, while stating, \\"It's entertaining nonsense that doesn't quite manage to recapture the magic of the original. Still, there are some nice moments here, and Willis is on solid ground as the iconic McClane.\\" Gene Siskel ranked the film as the sixth best movie of 1990. Maxim magazine ranked the film's plane crash #2 on its list of \\"Greatest Movie Plane Crashes\\".  Home media  The film debuted on video in the United States in February 1991 and was the most rented video in its first week above Navy SEALs and sold a record 505,000 units for rental. The film had its DVD debut on 10 January 2000 and re-released again in early 2005 as a Widescreen Edition and June 19, 2007, followed by a Blu-ray release on November 20, 2007 and a re-release on January 29, 2013.

A brightly-lit figure out of the audience's sight below the stage is reflected in a pane of glass placed between the performer and the audience. To the audience, it appears as if the ghost is on stage. Pepper's ghost is an illusion technique used in the theatre, amusement parks, museums, television, and concerts. It is named after the English scientist John Henry Pepper (1821‚Äì1900) who popularized the effect in a demonstration in 1862. Examples of the illusion are the Girl-to-Gorilla trick found in old carnival sideshows and the appearance of \\"Ghosts\\" at the Haunted Mansion and the \\"Blue Fairy\\" in Pinocchio's Daring Journey, both at the Disneyland park in California. Teleprompters are a modern implementation of Pepper's ghost. The technique was used by Digital Domain for the appearance of Tupac Shakur onstage with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg at the 2012 Coachella Music and Arts Festival and Michael Jackson at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards. The essential device employed to stage the illusion is an optical beam splitter operated in reverse to combine two images towards the audience's point of view. The beam splitter element is typically a large, flat sheet of ordinary glass. The image of one scene is reflected from the glass surface towards the viewers, and the image of a second scene is transmitted through the glass. The stage lighting is controlled to selectively illuminate the scenes, but not the glass itself, which is invisible to observers. The combined image is genuine and not an illusion; the illusion consists of the audience not detecting the glass. Effect An audience views a stage or room with various objects in it. On command, ghostly objects appear to fade in or out of existence in the room, or objects in the room transform into different objects. Technique The basic trick involves a stage that is specially arranged into two rooms, one that people can see into or the stage as a whole, and a second that is hidden to the side, the \\"blue room\\". A plate of glass (or Plexiglas or plastic film) is placed somewhere in the main room at an angle that reflects the view of the blue room towards the audience. Generally this is arranged with the blue room to one side of the stage, and the plate on the stage rotated around its vertical axis at 45 degrees. Care must be taken to make the glass as invisible as possible, normally hiding the lower edge in patterning on the floor and ensuring lights do not reflect off it. When the lights are bright in the main room and dark in the blue room, the reflected image cannot be seen. When the lighting in the blue room is increased, often with the main room lights dimming to make the effect more pronounced, the reflection becomes visible and the objects within the blue/hidden room seem to appear, from thin air, in the space visible to the audience. A common variation uses two blue/hidden rooms -- (one behind the glass in the main room, and one to the side) -- the contents of which can be switched between 'visible' and 'invisible' states by manipulating the lighting therein. The hidden room may be an identical mirror-image of the main room, so that its reflected image exactly matches the layout of the main room; this approach is useful in making objects seem to appear or disappear. This illusion can also be used to make an object, or person -- reflected in, say, a mirror -- appear to morph into another (or vice versa). This is the principle behind the Girl-to-Gorilla trick found in old carnival sideshows. Another variation: the hidden room may itself be painted black, with only light-colored objects in it. In this case, when light is cast on the room, only the light objects strongly reflect that light, and therefore appear as ghostly, translucent images on the (invisible) pane of glass in the room visible to the audience. This can be used to make objects appear to float in space. History=Giambattista della Porta Giambattista della Porta was a 16th-century Neapolitan scientist and scholar who is credited with a number of scientific innovations (including sometimes, erroneously, the camera obscura, first described in detail by Leonardo da Vinci). His 1584 work Magia Naturalis (Natural Magic) includes a description of an illusion, titled \\"How we may see in a Chamber things that are not\\" that is the first known description of the Pepper's ghost effect. Porta's description, from the 1658 English language translation, is as follows. Henri Robin and Pierre S√©guin French illusionist Henri Robin (Henrik Joseph Donckel) claimed to have had the idea for the illusion in 1845 and had a first satisfactory result in 1847. He presented it as \\"Fantasmagorie vivante\\" (living phantasmagoria) in theatres in Lyon and Saint-Etienne, but to his astonishment it didn't sort much effect. He found the illusion lacking and worked on a more convincing variation that he showed with much more success in Venice, Rome, Munich, Vienna and Brussels, but as he later admitted \\"since these experiences caused me great embarrassment, I found myself forced to put them aside for a while\\".Sarah Stanton and Martin Banham, The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theater , Cambridge University Press,1996, p. 316. The process was patented in 1852 by painter Pierre S√©guin, who had worked for Henri Robin.Spectres vivants et impalpables ¬ª, Jean-Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin, Magie et physique amusante, √©d. book-e-book, 2002 (√©d. orig. 1877), p. 64. John Pepper and Henry Dircks The Royal Polytechnic Institute London was a permanent science-related institution, first opened in 1838. With a degree in chemistry, John Henry Pepper joined the institution as a lecturer in 1848. The Polytechnic awarded him the title of Professor. In 1854, he became the director and sole lessee of the Royal Polytechnic. In 1862, inventor Henry Dircks developed the Dircksian Phantasmagoria, his version of the long- established phantasmagoria performances. This technique was used to make a ghost appear on-stage. He tried unsuccessfully to sell his idea to theatres. It required that theaters be completely rebuilt to support the effect, which they found too costly to consider. Later in the year, Dircks set up a booth at the Royal Polytechnic, where it was seen by John Pepper. Pepper realized that the method could be modified to make it easy to incorporate into existing theatres. Dircks's illusion used a reflecting glass perpendicular to the theater floor, reflecting actors directly underneath the audience, whereas Pepper tilted the glass to a 45-degree angle and placed actors lying on their sides in a pit in front of the audience. Pepper first showed the effect during a scene of Charles Dickens's The Haunted Man, to great success. Pepper's implementation of the effect tied his name to it permanently. Dircks eventually signed over to Pepper all financial rights in their joint patent. Though Pepper tried many times to give credit to Dircks, the title \\"Pepper's ghost\\" endured. The relationship between Dircks and Pepper was summarised in an 1863 article from Spectator: > This admirable ghost is the offspring of two fathers, of a learned member of > the Society of Civil Engineers, Henry Dircks, Esq., and of Professor Pepper, > of the Polytechnic. To Mr. Dircks belongs the honour of having invented him, > or as the disciples of Hegel would express it, evolved him from out of the > depths of his own consciousness; and Professor Pepper has the merit of > having improved him considerably, fitting him for the intercourse of mundane > society, and even educating him for the stage. Modern examples The illusion is widely used for entertainment and publicity purposes (often wrongly described as \\"holographic\\"). Such setups can involve custom projection media server software and specialized stretched films. The installation may be a site-specific one-off, or a use of a commercial system such as the Cheoptics360 or Musion Eyeliner. Products have been designed using a clear plastic pyramid and a smartphone screen to generate the illusion of a 3D object. Amusement parks The world's largest implementation of this illusion can be found at The Haunted Mansion and Phantom Manor attractions at several Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. There, a -long scene features multiple Pepper's ghost effects, brought together in one scene. Guests travel along an elevated mezzanine, looking through a -tall pane of glass into an empty ballroom. Animatronic ghosts move in hidden black rooms beneath and above the mezzanine. A more advanced variation of the Pepper's Ghost effect is also used at The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. The walk-through attraction Turbidite Manor in Nashville, Tennessee, employs variations of the classic technique, enabling guests to see various spirits that also interact with the physical environment, viewable at a much closer proximity. The House at Haunted Hill, a Halloween attraction in Woodland Hills, California, employs a similar variation in its front window to display characters from its storyline. Projecting an image on the floor and reflecting it in a pane of glass allows a live actor (left) to interact with a projected \\"ghost\\" An example that combines the Pepper's ghost effect with a live actor and film projection can be seen in the Mystery Lodge exhibit at the Knott's Berry Farm theme park in Buena Park, California, and the Ghosts of the Library exhibit at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, as well as the depiction of Maori legends called A Millennium Ago at the Museum of Wellington City & Sea in New Zealand. The Hogwarts Express attraction at Universal Studios Florida uses the Pepper's ghost effect, such that guests entering \\"Platform \\" seem to disappear into a brick wall when viewed from those further behind in the queue. Museums Museums increasingly use Pepper's ghost exhibits to create attractions that appeal to visitors. In the mid-1970s James Gardener designed the Changing Office installation in the London Science Museum, consisting of a 1970s-style office that transforms into an 1870s-style office as the audience watches. It was designed and built by Will Wilson and Simon Beer of Integrated Circles. Another particularly intricate Pepper's ghost display is the Eight Stage Ghost built for the British Telecom Showcase Exhibition in London in 1978. This display follows the history of electronics in a number of discrete transitions. The Little Match Girl in the Fairy Tale Forest, Efteling, Netherlands More modern examples of Pepper's ghost effects can be found in various museums in the United Kingdom and Europe. Examples of these in the United Kingdom are the ghost of Annie McLeod at the New Lanark World Heritage Site, the ghost of John McEnroe at the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum, which reopened in new premises in 2006, and one of Sir Alex Ferguson, which opened at the Manchester United Museum in 2007. Other examples include the ghost of Sarah (who picks up a candle and walks through the wall) and also the ghost of the Eighth Duke at Blenheim Palace. In October 2008 a life-sized Pepper's ghost of Shane Warne was opened at the National Sports Museum in Melbourne, Australia. The effect is also used at the Dickens World attraction at Chatham Maritime, Kent, United Kingdom. Both the York Dungeon and the Edinburgh Dungeon use the effect in the context of their 'Ghosts' shows. Durham Cathedral uses the effect in a different way in its Open Treasure museum. Here it is used to display information about St Cuthbert's coffin without obscuring the view from other angles. Another example can be found at Our Planet Centre in Castries, St Lucia, which opened in May 2011, where a life-size Prince Charles and Governor general of the island appear on stage talking about climate change. The South African Jewish Museum in Cape Town uses elaborate Pepper's ghost video technology in their permanent exhibit. The Artist Group PXNG.LI has exhibited the evolutionary processes in a Pepper's ghost box at the Natural Science Museum in Karlsruhe, Germany. Television, film, and video Teleprompters are a modern implementation of Pepper's ghost used by the television industry. They reflect a speech or script and are commonly used for live broadcasts such as news programmes. In the episode of The Magic School Bus that deals with light, \\"Gets a Bright Idea\\", Arnold's mischievous cousin Janet uses a Pepper's ghost illusion to convince the class a theater is haunted. It ends up helping the class learn more about how light and reflections behave. On 1 June 2013, ITV broadcast Les Dawson: An Audience With That Never Was. The programme featured a Pepper's ghost projection of Les Dawson, presenting content for a 1993 edition of An Audience with... to be hosted by Dawson but unused due to his death two weeks before recording. In the 1990 movie Home Alone, the technique is used to show Harry with his head in flames, as result of a blow torch from a home invasion gone bad. CGI was not available at the time of filming. In the 2016 BBC Sherlock episode \\"The Abominable Bride\\", the Pepper's ghost trick is used to show Emelia Ricoletti as a ghost in Sir Eustace Carmichael's house. In CBS's The Mentalist episode \\"Red Scare\\" (Season 2, episode 5, 2009), Patrick Jane realises that Pepper's ghost was used in an attempt to scare one of the characters, an architect, from an old house he was developing. In CTV's The Listener episode \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" (Season 5, episode 4, 2014), the team realises that Pepper's ghost was used by a murderer to give himself an alibi, and is then used by the team to trick the murderer into revealing his guilt. Various arcade games, most notably Taito's 1978 video game Space Invaders, used a mirror-based variation of the illusion to make the game's graphics appear against an illuminated backdrop. Concerts An illusion based on Pepper's ghost involving projected images has been featured at music concerts (often erroneously marketed as \\"holographic\\"). At the 2006 Grammy Awards, the Pepper's ghost technique was used to project Madonna with the virtual members of the band Gorillaz onto the stage in a \\"live\\" performance. This type of system consists of a projector (usually DLP) or LED screen, with a resolution of 1280√ó1024 or higher and brightness of at least 5,000 lumens, a high-definition video player, a stretched film between the audience and the acting area, a 3D set/drawing that encloses three sides, plus lighting, audio, and show control. During Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg's performance at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, a projection of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur appeared and performed \\"Hail Mary\\" and \\"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\\". The use of this approach was repeated in 2013 at west coast Rock the Bells dates, featuring projections of Eazy-E and Ol' Dirty Bastard. On 18 May 2014, during the Billboard Music Awards, an illusion of deceased pop star Michael Jackson, other dancers, and the entire stage set was projected onto the stage for a performance of the song \\"Slave to the Rhythm\\" from the posthumous Xscape album. On September 21, 2017, the Frank Zappa estate announced plans to conduct a reunion tour with the Mothers of Invention that would make use of Pepper's ghosts of Frank Zappa and the settings from his studio albums. Initially scheduled to run through 2018, the tour was later pushed back to 2019. A projection of Ronnie James Dio performed at the Wacken Open Air festival in 2016. Political speeches NChant 3D telecast, live, a 55-minute speech by Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of Gujarat, to 53 locations across Gujarat on 10 December 2012 during the assembly elections. In April 2014, they projected Narendra Modi again at 88 locations across India. In 2014, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyep Erdogan delivered a speech via Pepper‚Äôs ghost in Izmir.

He was Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for West Lancashire. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 1992, and retired at the general election of 2005. Pickthall's father was a shipyard fitter. He attended Ulverston Grammar School, and then the University of Wales, obtaining a B.A. Hons. English Literature and History. He then went on to the University of Lancaster, where he obtained an M.A. with the thesis ‚ÄúThe Influence of Socialism on 20th Century British Poetry‚Äù. He became a member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the Labour Party, in 1963. He married a Canadian, Judith Ann in 1973; they have two daughters, Alisoun and Jenny. He initially worked as a lecturer of English, in the Ruffwood Comprehensive School and Edge Hill College of H.E. (where he became the Head of European Studies) At the general election of June 1987, Pickthall ran for Parliament in West Lancashire, but lost to the Conservatives by 1,353 votes. Later, in 1989, he won the seat of Ormskirk, on Lancashire County Council, by a very small margin. However, this was sufficient for the Labour Party, to take control of the County Council, by one seat. At the general election of April 1992, he took the parliamentary seat of West Lancashire, and in the following elections, in May 1997 and June 2001, he retained the seat, with a substantial majority. He became a member of the Select committee on Agriculture in 1992, the post that he maintained until 1997. He was appointed parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Alun Michael MP, in 1997, later serving Jack Straw MP. He resigned as PPS in December 2000, in response to the police investigation, into his election expenses. He was later reinstated shortly afterwards, in 2001, when the police investigation concluded there had been ‚Äúno wrongdoing‚Äù. He was transferred to the Foreign Office in 2001, where he continued as Jack Straw's PPS. He pledged his ‚Äúcontinuing support‚Äù for Tony Blair in July 2004, remarking that his performance has been ‚Äúpsychologically remarkable‚Äù. Pickthall is considered a leftist, frequently campaigning about animal welfare and environmental issues. He is opposed to hare coursing, as the Waterloo Cup took place at Great Altcar, in his constituency, and hunting. His support, for the hunting ban, led to pro hunt supporters leaving a dead fox on his doorstep, in February 2005. He retired from the House of Commons, at the general election of May 2005.

It was originally made with a barley-almond blend. It has a pronounced almond taste and is used to flavor many cocktails. Orgeat syrup is an important ingredient in the Mai Tai and many Tiki drinks. History An early (but toxic) recipe for orgeat can be found in The English and Australian Cookery Book: \\"Take a pound and a quarter of bitter almonds, and half a pound of sweet almonds, which have been blanched, nine pounds of loaf sugar, six pints of water, and the rinds of three lemons. Pound the almonds in a mortar with the sugar, and add the water a little by degrees; then put the mixture on the fire with the lemon-peel. After a boil pour off the syrup and press the almonds, to extract the milk; add this to the syrup, and strain the whole through a sieve. When cold add a little orange flower water, and bottle the mixture. The orgeat is used as a summer drink, mixed with water, according to taste.\\" Bitter almonds as a general rule contain cyanide and can be lethal in large quantities. For this reason modern syrups generally are produced only from sweet almonds. Such syrup products do not contain significant levels of hydrocyanic acid, so are generally considered safe for human consumption unless the person is allergic. Word origin The word \\"orgeat\\" () is derived from the Latin hordeaceus \\"made with barley\\" through the French, where barley is called orge. The Catalan word orxata, from which derives the Spanish horchata, has the same origin, though today the two drinks have little else in common and neither of them uses barley. Regional uses In Tunisia and Libya, it is called rozata and is usually served chilled in wedding and engagement parties as a symbol of joy and purity because of its white colour and its fresh (flowery) flavor. It comes in many different flavours, such as traditional almond, banana, mango, pistachio, among others. In Suriname, there is a drink called orgeade, which is a similar syrup made of sugar and almonds. Maltese ruƒ°ƒ°ata is made of almond and vanilla essence and may include cinnamon and cloves. In Cyprus and on the Greek islands of Chios and Nisyros, a similar syrup is known as soum√°dha (). Soumada has a very ancient history at least in Cyprus, stretching back into the Roman period, and it was given as an exotic delicacy by King Peter I of Cyprus to King Casimir the Great of Poland at the Congress of Krak√≥w, held in Poland in 1364.Maria Dembinska and William Woys Weaver, Food and Drink in Medieval Poland (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999) p.41 See also *Horchata, a related Valencian drink *falernum syrup *fassionola syrup *drink mixers * List of syrups *Tiki drinks ReferencesExternal links * Category:Sugar substitutes Category:Drink mixers Category:Syrup Category:Greek cuisine Category:Cypriot cuisine Category:Libyan cuisine Category:Tunisian cuisine Category:Almonds ","title":"Orgeat syrup"},{"id":"433853","text":"Christopher Richard Pond (born 25 September 1952) is a former Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom.

This operation, while fairly abstract, unifies a number of constructions throughout mathematics.  Motivation  It was noted in various quite different settings that a short exact sequence often gives rise to a \\"long exact sequence\\". The concept of derived functors explains and clarifies many of these observations. Suppose we are given a covariant left exact functor F : A ‚Üí B between two abelian categories A and B. If 0 ‚Üí A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C ‚Üí 0 is a short exact sequence in A, then applying F yields the exact sequence 0 ‚Üí F(A) ‚Üí F(B) ‚Üí F(C) and one could ask how to continue this sequence to the right to form a long exact sequence. Strictly speaking, this question is ill-posed, since there are always numerous different ways to continue a given exact sequence to the right. But it turns out that (if A is \\"nice\\" enough) there is one canonical way of doing so, given by the right derived functors of F. For every i‚â•1, there is a functor RiF: A ‚Üí B, and the above sequence continues like so: 0 ‚Üí F(A) ‚Üí F(B) ‚Üí F(C) ‚Üí R1F(A) ‚Üí R1F(B) ‚Üí R1F(C) ‚Üí R2F(A) ‚Üí R2F(B) ‚Üí ... . From this we see that F is an exact functor if and only if R1F = 0; so in a sense the right derived functors of F measure \\"how far\\" F is from being exact. If the object A in the above short exact sequence is injective, then the sequence splits. Applying any additive functor to a split sequence results in a split sequence, so in particular R1F(A) = 0. Right derived functors (for i>0) are zero on injectives: this is the motivation for the construction given below.  Construction and first properties  The crucial assumption we need to make about our abelian category A is that it has enough injectives, meaning that for every object A in A there exists a monomorphism A ‚Üí I where I is an injective object in A. The right derived functors of the covariant left-exact functor F : A ‚Üí B are then defined as follows. Start with an object X of A. Because there are enough injectives, we can construct a long exact sequence of the form :0\\\\to X\\\\to I^0\\\\to I^1\\\\to I^2\\\\to\\\\cdots where the I i are all injective (this is known as an injective resolution of X). Applying the functor F to this sequence, and chopping off the first term, we obtain the chain complex :0\\\\to F(I^0)\\\\to F(I^1) \\\\to F(I^2) \\\\to\\\\cdots Note: this is in general not an exact sequence anymore. But we can compute its cohomology at the i-th spot (the kernel of the map from F(Ii) modulo the image of the map to F(Ii)); we call the result RiF(X). Of course, various things have to be checked: the end result does not depend on the given injective resolution of X, and any morphism X ‚Üí Y naturally yields a morphism RiF(X) ‚Üí RiF(Y), so that we indeed obtain a functor. Note that left exactness means that 0 ‚ÜíF(X) ‚Üí F(I0) ‚Üí F(I1) is exact, so R0F(X) = F(X), so we only get something interesting for i>0. (Technically, to produce well-defined derivatives of F, we would have to fix an injective resolution for every object of A. This choice of injective resolutions then yields functors RiF. Different choices of resolutions yield naturally isomorphic functors, so in the end the choice doesn't really matter.) The above-mentioned property of turning short exact sequences into long exact sequences is a consequence of the snake lemma. This tells us that the collection of derived functors is a Œ¥-functor. If X is itself injective, then we can choose the injective resolution 0 ‚Üí X ‚Üí X ‚Üí 0, and we obtain that RiF(X) = 0 for all i ‚â• 1. In practice, this fact, together with the long exact sequence property, is often used to compute the values of right derived functors. An equivalent way to compute RiF(X) is the following: take an injective resolution of X as above, and let Ki be the image of the map Ii-1‚ÜíIi (for i=0, define Ii-1=0), which is the same as the kernel of Ii‚ÜíIi+1. Let œÜi : Ii-1‚ÜíKi be the corresponding surjective map. Then RiF(X) is the cokernel of F(œÜi).  Variations  If one starts with a covariant right-exact functor G, and the category A has enough projectives (i.e. for every object A of A there exists an epimorphism P ‚Üí A where P is a projective object), then one can define analogously the left-derived functors LiG. For an object X of A we first construct a projective resolution of the form :\\\\cdots\\\\to P_2\\\\to P_1\\\\to P_0 \\\\to X \\\\to 0 where the Pi are projective. We apply G to this sequence, chop off the last term, and compute homology to get LiG(X). As before, L0G(X) = G(X). In this case, the long exact sequence will grow \\"to the left\\" rather than to the right: :0\\\\to A \\\\to B \\\\to C \\\\to 0 is turned into :\\\\cdots\\\\to L_2G(C) \\\\to L_1G(A) \\\\to L_1G(B)\\\\to L_1G(C)\\\\to G(A)\\\\to G(B)\\\\to G(C)\\\\to 0. Left derived functors are zero on all projective objects. One may also start with a contravariant left-exact functor F; the resulting right-derived functors are then also contravariant. The short exact sequence :0\\\\to A \\\\to B \\\\to C \\\\to 0 is turned into the long exact sequence :0\\\\to F(C)\\\\to F(B)\\\\to F(A)\\\\to R^1F(C) \\\\to R^1F(B) \\\\to R^1F(A)\\\\to R^2F(C)\\\\to \\\\cdots These right derived functors are zero on projectives and are therefore computed via projective resolutions.  Examples  * If A is an abelian category, then its category of morphisms A^{{\\\\ast\\\\to\\\\ast}} is also abelian. The functor \\\\ker: A^{{\\\\ast\\\\to\\\\ast}}\\\\to A which maps each morphism to its kernel is left exact. Its right derived functors are ::R^i(\\\\ker)(f) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\ker(f) & i=0 \\\\ \\\\operatorname{coker}(f) & i=1 \\\\ 0 & i>1\\\\end{cases} :Dually the functor \\\\operatorname{coker} is right exact and its left derived functors are ::L_i(\\\\operatorname{coker})(f)=\\\\begin{cases} \\\\operatorname{coker}(f) & i=0 \\\\ \\\\ker(f) & i=1 \\\\ 0 & i>1\\\\end{cases} :This is a manifestation of the snake lemma.  Homology and Cohomology Sheaf cohomology= If X is a topological space, then the category Sh(X) of all sheaves of abelian groups on X is an abelian category with enough injectives. The functor \\\\Gamma: Sh(X)\\\\to Ab which assigns to each such sheaf \\\\mathcal{F} the group \\\\Gamma(\\\\mathcal{F}) := \\\\mathcal{F}(X) of global sections is left exact, and the right derived functors are the sheaf cohomology functors, usually written as H^i(X,\\\\mathcal{F}). Slightly more generally: if (X,\\\\mathcal{O}_X) is a ringed space, then the category of all sheaves of \\\\mathcal{O}_X-modules is an abelian category with enough injectives, and we can again construct sheaf cohomology as the right derived functors of the global section functor. There are various notions of cohomology which are a special case of this: * De Rham cohomology is the sheaf cohomology of the sheaf of locally constant \\\\R-valued functions on a manifold. The De Rham complex is a resolution of this sheaf not by injective sheaves, but by fine sheaves. * √âtale cohomology is another cohomology theory for sheaves over a scheme. It is the right derived functor of the global sections of abelian sheaves on the √©tale site. =Ext functors= If R is a ring, then the category of all left R-modules is an abelian category with enough injectives. If A is a fixed left R-module, then the functor \\\\operatorname{Hom}(A,-): R\\\\text{-Mod} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{Ab} is left exact, and its right derived functors are the Ext functors \\\\operatorname{Ext}_R^i(A,-). Alternatively \\\\operatorname{Ext}_R^i(-,B) can also be obtained as the left derived functor of the right exact functor \\\\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,B): R\\\\text{-Mod} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{Ab}^{op}. Various notions of cohomology are special cases of Ext functors and therefore also derived functors. * Group cohomology is the right derived functor of the invariants functor (-)^G : k[G]\\\\text{-Mod}\\\\to k[G]\\\\text{-Mod} which is the same as \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{k[G]}(k,-) (where k is the trivial k[G]-module) and therefore H^i(G,M) = \\\\operatorname{Ext}_{k[G]}^i(k,M). * Lie algebra cohomology of a Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} over some commutative ring k is the right derived functor of the invariants functor (-)^{\\\\mathfrak{g}}: \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\text{-Mod}\\\\to k\\\\text{-Mod} which is the same as \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{U(\\\\mathfrak{g})}(k,-) (where k is again the trivial \\\\mathfrak{g}-module and U(\\\\mathfrak{g}) is the universal enveloping algebra of \\\\mathfrak{g}). Therefore H^i(\\\\mathfrak{g},M) = \\\\operatorname{Ext}_{U(\\\\mathfrak{g})}^i(k,M). *Hochschild cohomology of some k-algebra A is the right derived functor of invariants (-)^A: (A,A)\\\\text{-Bimod}\\\\to k\\\\text{-Mod} mapping a bimodule M to its center, also called its set of invariants M^A := Z(M) := {m\\\\in M \\\\mid \\\\forall a\\\\in A: am=ma} which is the same as \\\\operatorname{Hom}_{A^e}(A,M) (where A^e:=A\\\\otimes_k A^{op} is the enveloping algebra of A and A is considered a (A,A)-bimodule via the usual left and right multiplication). Therefore HH^i(A,M) = \\\\operatorname{Ext}_{A^e}^i(A,M): =Tor functors= The category of left R-modules also has enough projectives. If A is a fixed right R-module, then the tensor product with A gives a right exact covariant functor A\\\\otimes_R - : R\\\\text{-Mod} \\\\to Ab; The category of modules has enough projectives so that left derived functors always exists. The left derived functors of the tensor functor are the Tor functors \\\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(A,-). Equivalently \\\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(-,B) can be defined symmetrically as the left derived functors of -\\\\otimes B. In fact one can combine both definitions and define \\\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(-,-) as the left derived of -\\\\otimes-: \\\\text{Mod-}R \\\\times R\\\\text{-Mod} \\\\to Ab. This includes several notions of homology as special cases. This often mirrors the situation with Ext functors and cohomology. * Group homology is the left derived of taking coinvariants (-)_G: k[G]\\\\text{-Mod}\\\\to k\\\\text{-Mod} which is the same as k\\\\otimes_{k[G]}-. * Lie algebra homology is the left derived functor of taking coinvariants \\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\text{-Mod}\\\\to k\\\\text{-Mod}, M\\\\mapsto M/[\\\\mathfrak{g},M] which is the same as k\\\\otimes_{U(\\\\mathfrak{g})}-. * Hochschild homology is the left derived functor of taking coinvariants (A,A)\\\\text{-Bimod}\\\\to k\\\\text{-Mod}, M\\\\mapsto M/[A,M] which is the same as A \\\\otimes_{A^e} -. Instead of taking individual left derived functors one can also take the total derived functor of the tensor functor. This gives rise to the derived tensor product -\\\\otimes^L-: D(\\\\text{Mod-}R) \\\\times D(R\\\\text{-Mod}) \\\\to D(Ab) where D is the derived category.  Naturality  Derived functors and the long exact sequences are \\"natural\\" in several technical senses. First, given a commutative diagram of the form :\\\\begin{array}{ccccccccc} 0&\\\\to&A;_1&\\\\xrightarrow{f_1}&B;_1&\\\\xrightarrow{g_1}&C;_1&\\\\to&0\\\\ &&\\\\alpha\\\\downarrow\\\\quad&&\\\\beta\\\\downarrow\\\\quad&&\\\\gamma\\\\downarrow\\\\quad&&\\\\ 0&\\\\to&A;_2&\\\\xrightarrow{f_2}&B;_2&\\\\xrightarrow{g_2}&C;_2&\\\\to&0 \\\\end{array} (where the rows are exact), the two resulting long exact sequences are related by commuting squares: Image:two long exact sequences.png Second, suppose Œ∑ : F ‚Üí G is a natural transformation from the left exact functor F to the left exact functor G. Then natural transformations RiŒ∑ : RiF ‚Üí RiG are induced, and indeed Ri becomes a functor from the functor category of all left exact functors from A to B to the full functor category of all functors from A to B. Furthermore, this functor is compatible with the long exact sequences in the following sense: if :0\\\\to A\\\\xrightarrow{f}B\\\\xrightarrow{g}C\\\\to 0 is a short exact sequence, then a commutative diagram Image:two long exact sequences2.png is induced. Both of these naturalities follow from the naturality of the sequence provided by the snake lemma. Conversely, the following characterization of derived functors holds: given a family of functors Ri: A ‚Üí B, satisfying the above, i.e. mapping short exact sequences to long exact sequences, such that for every injective object I of A, Ri(I)=0 for every positive i, then these functors are the right derived functors of R0.  Generalization  The more modern (and more general) approach to derived functors uses the language of derived categories. In 1968 Quillen developed the theory of model structures on a category, which give an abstract category- theoretic system of fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences. Typically one is interested in the underlying homotopy category obtained by localizing against the weak equivalences. A Quillen adjunction is an adjunction between model categories that descends to an adjunction between the homotopy categories. For example, the category of topological spaces and the category of simplicial sets both admit Quillen model structures whose nerve and realization adjunction gives a Quillen adjunction that is in fact an equivalence of homotopy categories. Particular objects in a model structure have ‚Äúnice properties‚Äù (concerning the existence of lifts against particular morphisms), the ‚Äúfibrant‚Äù and ‚Äúcofibrant‚Äù objects, and every object is weakly equivalent to a fibrant-cofibrant ‚Äúresolution.‚Äù Although originally developed to handle the category of topological spaces Quillen model structures appear in numerous places in mathematics; in particular the category of chain complexes from any Abelian category (modules, sheaves of modules on a topological space or scheme, etc.) admit a model structure whose weak equivalences are those morphisms between chain complexes preserving homology. Often we have a functor between two such model categories (e.g. the global sections functor sending a complex of Abelian sheaves to the obvious complex of Abelian groups) that preserves weak equivalences *within the subcategory of ‚Äúgood‚Äù (fibrant or cofibrant) objects.* By first taking a fibrant or cofibrant resolution of an object and then applying that functor, we have successfully extended it to the whole category in such a way that weak equivalences are always preserved (and hence it descends to a functor from the homotopy category). This is the ‚Äúderived functor.‚Äù The ‚Äúderived functors‚Äù of sheaf cohomology, for example, are the homologies of the output of this derived functor. Applying these to a sheaf of Abelian groups interpreted in the obvious way as a complex concentrated in homology, they measure the failure of the global sections functor to preserve weak equivalences of such, its failure of ‚Äúexactness.‚Äù General theory of model structures shows the uniqueness of this construction (that it does not depend of choice of fibrant or cofibrant resolution, etc.)  References  * * Category:Homological algebra Category:Functors ","title":"Derived functor"},{"id":"433879","text":"The cubical atom was an early atomic model in which electrons were positioned at the eight corners of a cube in a non-polar atom or molecule. This theory was developed in 1902 by Gilbert N. Lewis and published in 1916 in the article \\"The Atom and the Molecule\\" and used to account for the phenomenon of valency. Lewis's theory was based on Abegg's rule. It was further developed in 1919 by Irving Langmuir as the cubical octet atom. The figure below shows structural representations for elements of the second row of the periodic table. center Although the cubical model of the atom was soon abandoned in favor of the quantum mechanical model based on the Schr√∂dinger equation, and is therefore now principally of historical interest, it represented an important step towards the understanding of the chemical bond. The 1916 article by Lewis also introduced the concept of the electron pair in the covalent bond, the octet rule, and the now-called Lewis structure. Bonding in the cubical atom model Single covalent bonds are formed when two atoms share an edge, as in structure C below. This results in the sharing of two electrons. Ionic bonds are formed by the transfer of an electron from one cube to another without sharing an edge (structure A). An intermediate state where only one corner is shared (structure B) was also postulated by Lewis. Image:cubical atom 2.svg Double bonds are formed by sharing a face between two cubic atoms. This results in sharing four electrons: Image:cubical atom 3.svg Triple bonds could not be accounted for by the cubical atom model, because there is no way of having two cubes share three parallel edges. Lewis suggested that the electron pairs in atomic bonds have a special attraction, which result in a tetrahedral structure, as in the figure below (the new location of the electrons is represented by the dotted circles in the middle of the thick edges). This allows the formation of a single bond by sharing a corner, a double bond by sharing an edge, and a triple bond by sharing a face. It also accounts for the free rotation around single bonds and for the tetrahedral geometry of methane.

He was the Member of Parliament for Southport from 2001‚Äì2017. He stood down at the 2017 snap election. In November 2017, he was elected to Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council as a councillor for Duke's Ward. Early life and career Pugh was educated at Prescot Grammar School and Maidstone Grammar School. He graduated from Durham University, attending St Cuthbert's Society, where he studied Philosophy. Formerly a religious studies teacher and Head of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby, Pugh has lived in Southport since 1974. He also taught at Salesian College (later Savio High School) in Bootle. Pugh joined the Liberal Party in 1977. Pugh served on Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council, representing Birkdale, from 1987 until his election to Parliament. At the time of his election, Pugh was leader of the council (from 1992), and of the Sefton Liberal Democrats. Parliamentary career First elected to the House of Commons in the 2001 general election, in his first parliamentary term, Pugh served on the Transport, Local Government and Regions Select Committee and was Liberal Democrat education spokesperson with responsibility for schools. Following his re-election to Parliament in 2005, he served as shadow spokesperson for Transport and Health, and, subsequent to the election of Nick Clegg as party leader worked with Vince Cable as Shadow Treasury spokesperson. In the 2007 leadership election, John Pugh supported Nick Clegg in preference to Chris Huhne. With the formation of the coalition government in 2010 he was appointed as Co-Chair of the Liberal Democrat Parliamentary Committee for Health and Social Care, a position he relinquished at the end of 2013 to focus on producing a report examining the social and economic issues facing the North. In his party's 2015 leadership election, John Pugh supported Tim Farron in preference to Norman Lamb. In December 2015, Pugh voted to extend the bombing of ISIL targets in Iraq to Syria. On 19 April 2017, Pugh announced that he would not be standing in the 2017 general election. Campaign interests Amongst Pugh's campaigning interests is public sector IT, specifically around the role Open Source Software might play. Pugh has argued that the public sector could reduce costs by increasing use of Open Source Software and has accused the BBC of effectively giving Microsoft illegal state aid in only making their iPlayer download service available on Windows computers (at the time). Pugh has interests in mental health policy. In October 2009, Pugh introduced a private members' bill under the 10-minute rule calling for more local control over the NHS. Locally in Southport, Pugh is interested in saving local pubs, and also in the drinking culture of the UK. Pugh sees cheap alcohol deals in supermarkets as one of the major problems causing pub closures, and fuelling the culture. He also took the fight for Local Post Offices to 10 Downing Street. In Transport, Pugh has long campaigned for the reinstatement of the Burscough Curves, and is working with local groups such as the Ormskirk, Preston and Southport Travellers' Association (OPSTA) and the Southport Rail Transport Forum (SRTF) to save services from to Pugh supports Amnesty International, with whom he is reported to have had close ties with the Formby & Southport Group over a number of years. In 2013, he became one of the few Liberal Democrat MPs to vote against the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill. Personal life He is married to Annette with three daughters and a son.

It is a member of the mint family Lamiaceae and native to the Mediterranean region, though it has been naturalized in many places throughout the world. It has a long history of medicinal and culinary use, and in modern times it has been used as an ornamental garden plant. The common name \\"sage\\" is also used for a number of related and unrelated species. Names Salvia officinalis has numerous common names. Some of the best-known are sage, common sage, garden sage, golden sage, kitchen sage, true sage, culinary sage, Dalmatian sage, and broadleaf sage. Cultivated forms include purple sage and red sage. The binary botanical name officinalis refers to plants with a well-established medicinal or culinary value. Taxonomy Salvia officinalis was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It has been grown for centuries in the Old World for its food and healing properties, and was often described in old herbals for the many miraculous properties attributed to it. The binary name, officinalis, refers to the plant's medicinal use‚Äîthe officina was the traditional storeroom of a monastery where herbs and medicines were stored. S. officinalis has been classified under many other scientific names over the years, including six different names since 1940 alone. It is the type species for the genus Salvia. The second most commonly used species of sage is Salvia lavandulaefolia, which shares a similar composition with Salvia officinalis, with the exception that lavandulaefolia contains very little of the potentially toxic GABAA receptor- antagonizing monoterpenoid thujone. Description Sage leaves are covered with fine hairs called trichomes Cultivars are quite variable in size, leaf and flower color, and foliage pattern, with many variegated leaf types. The Old World type grows to approximately tall and wide, with lavender flowers most common, though they can also be white, pink, or purple. The plant flowers in late spring or summer. The leaves are oblong, ranging in size up to long by wide. Leaves are grey-green, rugose on the upper side, and nearly white underneath due to the many short soft hairs. Modern cultivars include leaves with purple, rose, cream, and yellow in many variegated combinations. History Painting from Koehler's Medicinal Plants (1887) Salvia officinalis has been used since ancient times for warding off evil, snakebites, increasing women's fertility, and more. The Romans referred to sage as the \\"holy herb,\\" and employed it in their religious rituals. Theophrastus wrote about two different sages, a wild undershrub he called sphakos, and a similar cultivated plant he called elelisphakos. Pliny the Elder said the latter plant was called salvia by the Romans, and used as a diuretic, a local anesthetic for the skin, a styptic, and for other uses. Charlemagne recommended the plant for cultivation in the early Middle Ages, and during the Carolingian Empire, it was cultivated in monastery gardens. Walafrid Strabo described it in his poem Hortulus as having a sweet scent and being useful for many human ailments‚Äîhe went back to the Greek root for the name and called it lelifagus. The plant had a high reputation throughout the Middle Ages, with many sayings referring to its healing properties and value.An Anglo-Saxon manuscript read \\"Why should man die when he has sage?\\" Kintzios, p. 10 It was sometimes called S. salvatrix (sage the savior). Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen all recommended sage as a diuretic, hemostatic, emmenagogue, and tonic. Le Menagier de Paris, in addition to recommending cold sage soup and sage sauce for poultry, recommends infusion of sage for washing hands at table. John Gerard's Herball (1597) states that sage \\"is singularly good for the head and brain, it quickeneth the senses and memory, strengtheneth the sinews, restoreth health to those that have the palsy, and taketh away shakey trembling of the members.\\" Gervase Markham's The English Huswife (1615) gives a recipe for a tooth-powder of sage and salt. It appears in recipes for Four Thieves Vinegar, a blend of herbs which was supposed to ward off the plague. In past centuries, it was also used for hair care, insect bites and wasp stings, nervous conditions, mental conditions, oral preparations for inflammation of the mouth, tongue and throat, and also to reduce fevers. Uses=Culinary use The top side of a sage leaf ‚Äì trichomes are visible The underside of a sage leaf ‚Äì more trichomes are visible on this side A pot of Salvia officinalis Sage seeds are very small and almost spherical in shape In Britain, sage has for generations been listed as one of the essential herbs, along with parsley, rosemary, and thyme (as in the folk song \\"Scarborough Fair\\"). It has a savory, slightly peppery flavor. Sage appears in the 14th and 15th centuries in a \\"Cold Sage Sauce\\", known in French, English and Lombard cuisine, probably traceable to its appearance in Le Viandier de Taillevent. It appears in many European cuisines, notably Italian, Balkan and Middle Eastern cookery. In Italian cuisine, it is an essential condiment for saltimbocca and other dishes, favored with fish. In British and American cooking, it is traditionally served as sage and onion stuffing, an accompaniment to roast turkey or chicken at Christmas or Thanksgiving Day, and for Sunday roast dinners. Other dishes include pork casserole, Sage Derby cheese and Lincolnshire sausages. Despite the common use of traditional and available herbs in French cuisine, sage never found favor there. In the Levant and Egypt it is commonly used as a flavor for hot black tea, or boiled and served as an herbal drink in its own right. Essential oil Common sage is grown in parts of Europe for distillation of an essential oil, although other species such as Salvia fruticosa may also be harvested and distilled with it. The essential oil contains cineole, borneol, and thujone. Sage leaf contains tannic acid, oleic acid, ursolic acid, carnosol, carnosic acid, fumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, niacin, nicotinamide, flavones, flavonoid glycosides, and estrogenic substances. Medical research Some research has suggested certain extracts of Salvia officinalis and S. lavandulaefolia may have positive effects on human brain function, improving memory and attention in the young, old and those with Alzheimer's Disease. These results have been seen laboratory research and in controlled clinical trials. The thujone present in Salvia extracts may be neurotoxic. Cultivars In favorable conditions in the garden, S. officinalis can grow to a substantial size (1 square metre or more), but a number of cultivars are more compact. As such they are valued as small ornamental flowering shrubs, rather than for their herbal properties. Some provide low ground cover, especially in sunny dry environments. Like many herbs they can be killed by a cold wet winter, especially if the soil is not well drained. But they are easily propagated from summer cuttings, and some cultivars are produced from seeds. Named cultivars include: * 'Alba', a white-flowered cultivar * 'Aurea', golden sage * 'Berggarten', a cultivar with large leaves, which rarely blooms, extending the useful life of the leaves * 'Extrakta', has leaves with higher oil concentrations * 'Icterina', a cultivar with yellow-green variegated leaves * 'Lavandulaefolia', a small leaved cultivar * 'Purpurascens' ('Purpurea'), a purple-leafed cultivar * 'Tricolor', a cultivar with white, purple and green variegated leaves 'Icterina' and 'Purpurascens' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

History Descriptions of medicinal use of the plant goes back to the writings of Theophrastus (4th century BCE), Dioscorides (1st century CE), and Pliny the Elder (1st century CE). Clary seeds have a mucilaginous coat, which is why some old herbals recommended placing a seed into the eye of someone with a foreign object in it so that it could adhere to the object and make it easy to remove. This practice is noted by Nicholas Culpeper in his Complete Herbal (1653), who referred to the plant as \\"clear-eye\\".The Complete Herbal at Bibliomania, with link to entry for Clary, or More Properly Clear-Eye. It was used as in ingredient in wine and beer production. In 16th-century Germany elderflower infused clary was added to Rhine wines to make a more potent varietal known as Muscatel.Rodale's Illustrated Encyclopedia of Herbs Uses Cultivated field in northeastern North Carolina The distilled essential oil is used widely in perfumes and as a muscatel flavoring for vermouths, wines, and liqueurs. It is also used in aromatherapy. It has also been used to induce labour and throughout labour to bring on contractions. In the United States, large scale production is concentrated in northeastern North Carolina in the counties surrounding Bertie County.

The group is thought to contain as many as 100,000 species, many of which have not yet been described. Like other parasitoid wasps, they were long placed in the \\"Parasitica\\", variously considered as an infraorder or an unranked clade, now known to be paraphyletic. Etymology The name is derived from Latin 'ichneumon', from Ancient Greek ·º∞œáŒΩŒµœçŒºœâŒΩ (ikhne√∫m≈çn, \\"tracker\\"), from ·º¥œáŒΩŒøœÇ (√≠khnos, \\"track, footstep\\"). The name is shared with the Egyptian mongoose, Herpestes ichneumon. Description The superfamily is defined by fusion of the costal and radial veins of the fore wing, and almost all species have more than 11 antennal segments. Both included families have a cosmopolitan distribution. Ichneumonoids have morphological similarities with relatives within the order Hymenoptera, including ants and bees. Ichneumonoidea contains a great deal of morphological diversity, with species ranging in size from long. Most are slender, and the females of many species (particularly in the genus Megarhyssa) have extremely long ovipositors for laying eggs. The ichneumonid wasps may be more familiar to non-entomologists than braconids, as they are generally larger. The two families are distinguished from each other primarily by details of wing venation.  Braconidae  Most are brownish or black, not brightly colored.Borror and White Fore wings lack vein 2m-cu.  Ichneumonidae  Ichneumonids vary greatly in size and their color varies from brightly colored yellow to uniform black. Fore wing with vein 2m-cu present and tubular.  Trachypetidae  The family Trachypetidae was erected in 2020 for three Australian genera formerly included in the Braconidae.D.L.J. Quicke, A.D. Austin, E.P. Fagan‚ÄêJeffries. P.D.N. Hebert, B.A. Butcher (2020) Recognition of the Trachypetidae stat.n. as a new extant family of Ichneumonoidea (Hymenoptera), based on molecular and morphological evidence. Systematic Entomology. DOI: 10.1111/syen.12426 Evolution Parasitoidism evolved only once in the Hymenoptera, during the Permian, leading to a single clade, the Apocrita. The Apocrita emerged during the Jurassic. Parasitic life cycle Ichneumonoids are solitary insects, and the vast majority are parasitoids; the larvae feed on or in another insect until it finally dies. Most hosts are holometabolus insect larvae, but there are many exceptions. In general, ichneumonoids are host specific, and only attack one or a few closely related host species. Many species use polydnaviruses to suppress the immune systems of their host insects. Due to the wide variety in hosts and lifestyles, see subfamily pages for more detail. The female ichneumonoid finds a host and lays an egg on, near, or inside the host's body. The ovipositor of ichneumonoids generally cannot deliver a sting as many wasps or bees do. It can be used to bore wood and lay eggs on hosts deep inside, or reach hosts hidden inside leaf shelters. Upon hatching, the larva feeds either externally or internally, killing the host when it is ready to pupate. Various ichneumonoids are used as biological control agents in controlling horticultural or forest pests. An example is the relationship between the species Ichneumon eumerus and its host butterfly Phengaris rebeli. The butterfly larva is a parasite within Myrmica ant nests. The adult I. eumerus searches for ant nests and only enters when they contain P. rebeli caterpillars. Once inside, they oviposit within the caterpillars and escape the nest by releasing a chemical which causes the worker ants to fight each other rather than the intruding wasp. The wasp eggs then hatch inside the caterpillar and eventually consume and kill the host. ;Life cycle of Hercus fontinalis File:Hercus fontinalis early instar larvae.jpgEarly instar larvae on caterpillar File:Hercus fontinalis later instar larvae.jpgLater instar larvae File:Hercus_fontinalis_final_instar_larva.jpgFinal instar larvae building cocoon File:Hercus fontinalis pupa.jpgPupa inside cocoon File:Hercus fontinalis eclosion.jpgAdults emerging from cocoons File:Hercus fontinalis female.jpgAdult female ReferencesExternal links  Reference large-format photos of 15 different species of Ichneumonidae * An interesting account of an observer's encounter with Ichneumons. * University of Florida Department of Entomology & Nematology page about ichneumons * Bugguide.net.

They had now come under the jurisdiction of fifteen states, some of which had never existed and others that had passed out of existence in 1939.\\" Before the revolutions of 1989 which resulted in the end of communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, a number of these now sovereign countries constituted the component republics of the Soviet Union. Armenia The history of the Jews in Armenia dates back more than 2,000 years. After Eastern Armenia came under Russian rule in the early 19th century, Jews began arriving from Poland and Iran, creating Ashkenazic and Mizrahi communities in Yerevan. More Jews moved to Armenia during its period as a Soviet republic finding more tolerance in the area than in Russia or Ukraine. After World War II, the Jewish population rose to approximately 5,000. However, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many left due to inadequate services and today the country's Jewish population has shrunk to 750. Despite small numbers, a high intermarriage rate, and relative isolation, a great deal of enthusiasm exists to help the community meet its needs.Advocates on Behalf of Jews in Russia, Ukraine, the Baltic States, and Eurasia: Armenia and Jews There are about 100 Jews presently living in Armenia, mainly in the capital Yerevan. They are mostly of Ashkenazi origin and some are Mizrahi Georgian Jews. Azerbaijan Quba rayon, Azerbaijan, 1932 The History of the Jews in Azerbaijan (; ; ; ) dates back to Late Antiquity. Historically Jews in Azerbaijan have been represented by various subgroups, mainly Mountain Jews, Ashkenazi Jews and Georgian Jews. After Sovietization all Zionism-related activities including those of cultural nature that were carried out in Hebrew were banned. In the early 1920s, a few hundred Mountain Jewish families from Azerbaijan and Dagestan left for Palestine and settled in Tel Aviv. The next aliyah did not take place until the 1970s, after the ban on Jewish immigration to Israel was lifted (see Refusenik). Between 1972 and 1978 around 3,000 people left Azerbaijan for Israel. 1970 was the demographic peak for Azerbaijani Jews after World War II; according to the census, 41,288 Jews resided in Azerbaijan that year. The Electronic Jewish Encyclop√¶dia: Azerbaijan Many Jewish √©migr√©s from Azerbaijan settled in Tel-Aviv and Haifa. There are relatively large communities of Mountain Jewish expatriates from Azerbaijan in New York City and Toronto. Similar to many immigrant communities of the Czarist and Soviet eras in Azerbaijan, Ashkenazi Jews appear to be linguistically Russified. The majority of Ashkenazi Jews speak Russian as their first language with Azeri sometimes being spoken as the second. The number of Yiddish-speakers is unknown. Belarus German‚Äìoccupied Belarus, 1941 The Jews in Belarus, then known as Byelorussian SSR were the third largest ethnic group in the country in the first half of the 20th century. Before World War II, Jews were the third among the ethnic groups in Belarus and comprised more than 40% of the population in cities and towns. The population of cities such as Minsk, Pinsk, Mahiliou, Babrujsk, Viciebsk, and Homiel was more than 50% Jewish. In 1897 there were 724,548 Jews in Belarus, or 13.6% of the total population.Slutsky, Yehuda (2007). \\"Belorussia.\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica. 2nd ed. Vol. 3. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. p.303-305. Some 800,000 Jews‚Äî90% of the Jewish population‚Äîwere killed in Belarus during the Holocaust.Associated Press, Oct 21, 2008, \\"Belarus marks ghetto's destruction 65 years on\\" According to the 2009 census, there were 12,926 Jews in Belarus (0.1% of the population). The Jewish Agency estimates the community of Jews in Belarus at 70,000. Marc Chagall, Mendele Mocher Sforim, Chaim Weizmann and Menachem Begin were born in Belarus. By the end of the 19th century, many Belarusian Jews were part of the general flight of Jews from Eastern Europe to the New World due to conflicts and pogroms engulfing the Russian Empire and the anti-Semitism of the Russian czars. Millions of Jews, including tens of thousands of Jews from Belarus, emigrated to the United States of America and South Africa. A small number also emigrated to the British Mandate of Palestine. During the first years of Soviet occupation of Belarus, Jews were able to get managing positions in the country. In WWII, atrocities against the Jewish population in the German- conquered areas began almost immediately, with the dispatch of Einsatzgruppen (task groups) to round up Jews and shoot them. In the second half of the 20th century, there was a large wave of Belarusian Jews immigrating to Israel (see Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1970s), as well as to the United States. In 1979, there were 135,400 Jews in Belarus; a decade later, 112,000 were left. The collapse of the Soviet Union and Belarusian independence saw most of the community, along with the majority of the former Soviet Union's Jewish population, leave for Israel (see Russian immigration to Israel in the 1990s), when most of the former Soviet Union's Jewish population left for Israel. The 1999 census estimated that there were only 29,000 Jews left in the country. However, local Jewish organizations put the number at 50,000, and the Jewish Agency believes that there are 70,000. About half of the country's Jews live in Minsk. Despite anti-semitic government policies, national Jewish organizations, local cultural groups, religious schools, charitable organizations, and organizations for war veterans and Holocaust survivors have been formed. Since the mass immigration of the 1990s, there has been some continuous immigration to Israel. In 2002, 974 Belarusians moved to Israel, and between 2003 and 2005, 4,854 followed suit. Estonia The history of the Jews in Estonian SSRJewish History in Estonia at www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org starts with individual reports of Jews in what is now Estonia from as early as the 14th century. However, the process of permanent Jewish settlement in Estonia began in the 19th century, especially after they were granted the official right to enter the region by a statute of Russian Tsar Alexander II in 1865. This allowed the so-called Jewish 'Nicholas soldiers' (often former cantonists) and their descendants, First Guild merchants, artisans, and Jews with higher education to settle in Estonia and other parts of the Russian Empire outside their Pale of Settlement. The \\"Nicholas soldiers\\" and their descendants, and artisans were, basically, the ones who founded the first Jewish congregations in Estonia. The Tallinn congregation, the largest in Estonia, was founded in 1830. The Tartu congregation was established in 1866 when the first fifty families settled there. Synagogues were built, the largest of which were constructed in Tallinn in 1883 and Tartu in 1901. Both of these were subsequently destroyed by fire in World War II. The life of the small Jewish community in Estonia was disrupted in 1940 with the Soviet occupation of Estonia. Cultural autonomy together with all its institutions was liquidated in July 1940. In July and August of the same year all organisations, associations, societies and corporations were closed. Jewish businesses were nationalized. A relatively large number of Jews (350‚Äì450, about 10% of the total Jewish population) were deported into prison camps in Russia by the Soviet authorities on 14 June 1941.Weiss-Wendt, Anton (1998). The Soviet Occupation of Estonia in 1940‚Äì41 and the Jews. Holocaust and Genocide Studies 12.2, 308‚Äì325.Berg, Eiki (1994). The Peculiarities of Jewish Settlement in Estonia. GeoJournal 33.4, 465‚Äì470. In WWII, more than 75% of Estonia's Jewish community, aware of the fate that otherwise awaited them, managed to escape to the Soviet Union; virtually all the remainder (between 950 and 1000 men, women and children) had been killed by the end of 1941. The four Estonians held most responsible for the murders at Kalevi-Liiva were accused at war crimes trials in 1961. Two were later executed; the others avoided sentencing by having gone to exile. From 1944 until 1988 the Estonian Jewish community had no organisations, associations, or clubs. In March 1988, as the process towards regaining Estonia's independence was beginning, the Jewish Cultural Society was established in Tallinn. It was the first of its kind in the late Soviet Union. Unlike in other parts of the Soviet Union, there were no problems with registering either the society or its symbols. The Society began by organising concerts and lectures. Soon the question of founding a Jewish school arose. As a start, a Sunday school was established in 1989. The Tallinn Jewish Gymnasium on Karu Street was being used by a vocational school. In 1990, a Jewish School with grades 1 through 9 was established. Georgia Shechita, Shalom Koboshvili, 1940 The Georgian Jews () are from Georgia, in the Caucasus. Georgian Jews are one of the oldest communities in Georgia, tracing their migration into the country during the Babylonian captivity in 6th century BC.The Wellspring of Georgian Historiography: The Early Medieval Historical Chronicle The Conversion of Katli and The Life of St. Nino, Constantine B. Lerner, England: Bennett and Bloom, London, 2004, p. 60 In 1801, the Russian Empire annexed Eastern Georgia. In the beginning of the 19th century, Ashkenazi Russian Jews were forced to move to Georgia by the Russian government. The Ashkenazi Jews and the Georgian Jews began establishing contact with each other, but relations were strained. Georgian Jews viewed the Ashkenazim as godless and secular, while the Ashkenazim looked down on the Georgian Jews. Zionism was a uniting cause for the two groups. Beginning in 1863, groups of Jews began making aliyah, mostly for religious reasons. The Red Army invaded Georgia in February 1921, prompting a mass exodus from the region. Initially, the Soviets allowed the Jews to maintain their religious customs, but after a Georgian rebellion in 1924, the Bolshevik government terminated all Zionist activity, imposed economic restrictions, and generally discriminated against the Jewish community. As a result, many Jewish businesses were bankrupted and 200 families applied for exit visas. Only 18 were allowed to emigrate. In the mid-1920s, the Soviets focused on industrializing and secularizing the Jews of Georgia. Mass numbers of Jews were forced to work in factories or to join craft cooperatives and collective farm projects. In 1927‚Äì1928, OZET, the organization for settling Jewish workers on farms, established a number of Jewish collective farms. These small homogeneous communities became isolated Jewish communities where Jewish learning was continued. Recognizing this, the Communists disbanded the communities in the 1930s, scattering the Jews among various farms and destroying Jewish communal life. The situation of the Jewish community of Georgia improved dramatically due to the end of the Soviet occupation. Ukraine Ukrainian Jewry has endured both times of discrimination as well as times of development and success. The Jews have been living in Ukraine since before the Common Era, where they worked with Greek traders near the Black Sea. Their population really expanded in the 13th century through migration of Jews from the Rhineland in particular. A large number of Jews during this period worked as artisans and merchants, but the largest amount of income came from the arenda system. The Jews were put in charge of the arendas and given the power to collects taxes while also the power to make and sell alcohol. This system allowed the Jews to become successful and helped their population to increase. By the end of the 19th century the Jews, compared to the Ukrainians, were more concentrated in urban settings. Lviv pogrom, 1941 The beginning of the 20th century brought with it a series of pogroms that led to the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews. A large number of the pogroms were carried out by the Ukrainian nationalist military and migrant industrial workers. Between 1918 and 1919, there were over 1,200 pogroms in Ukraine which stemmed from the belief that Jews were disloyal to the Tsar and were supporters of the Bolsheviks. There were rumors that Alexander III gave people the right to attack Jews because of the assassination of Alexander II. By the time the pogroms ended, 30,000 Jews were killed, 500,000 Jews were left homeless, and a total of 150,000 died due to diseases and wounds. Just 30 years later, the Jews were once again targeted and killed during the Holocaust when the Nazis occupied Ukraine. During the war, a total of 1.5 million Ukrainian Jews were killed, leaving only 40% of the Jewish population prior to the war. In 1939, when Western Ukraine was taken over by Germany, the Jews were put into ghettos and later sent to death camps where they were killed. Additionally, the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile killing units, was responsible for the mass murder of up to a million Ukrainian Jews. On the other hand, Jews living in areas annexed by the USSR did not come into contact with the Nazis, but they were forced to undergo Sovietization. Following the atrocities of the second world war, there was a lot of antisemitic violence in Ukraine. However, after the period known as Glasnost, the view of Jews became more positive as they realized a need for change. The number of Jews in Ukraine has drastically decreased since the late 20th century. The 2001 census showed that 380,000 Jews left Ukraine since 1989, which was ¬æ of the entire Jewish population.

They are part of the Morris dance tradition.  History  Silurian Border Morris Men, Church Lane, Ledbury, Boxing Day 1996 This was a village dance done in winter for fun and a bit of money. It usually includes three to twelve dancers. Some of the earliest accounts of a border morris tradition are provided by E.C. Cawte. There is reference to questions about \\"any disguised persons, as morice dancers, maskers, or mum'ers\\" to St. Mary's Parish Church in Shrewsbury in 1584 and an amazing account of morris dancers at Hereford races in 1609, describing \\"two musicians, four whifflers, and twelve dancers, including hobby horse and maid marian\\", all from villages within 14 miles of Hereford. The account claimed, \\"Hereford-shire for a morris-daunce puts downe, not onely all Kent, but verie neare (if one had line enough to measure it) three quarters of Christendome\\". Cawte quotes further accounts describing complaints to the local magistrates about disruptive morris dancers in Longdon, disrupting the Sabbath day from 1614 to 1617 and another account of dancers in Much Wenlock in 1652, causing a disturbance in an ale house at Nordley. Later records from Shrewsbury mention payment to the \\"Bedlam Morris\\" in 1688 and 1689. The dance depends on the numbers available, as at Brimfield. The dances collected from a particular place sometimes differ quite markedly between informants, as at White Ladies Aston, reflecting the flexibility from year to year. Sometimes a gang would only have one dance, sometimes two, or as at Malvern and Pershore an indeterminate set of figures. Widders with short sticks The common features are the rather short sticks and sometimes a stick and handkerchief version of the same dance, also usually a high single step akin to the local country dance step. Such detail as starting foot rules and phrase endings are notable for their apparent absence. Some of these village sides blackened their faces . There is no record of any sides dancing together. A few ‚Äì both Upton-upon-Severn dances for example ‚Äì matched the complexity of Cotswolds Morris, but many ‚Äì e.g. Bromsberrow Heath ‚Äì had a stark simplicity of one figure and one chorus repeated forever.Details of the collected dances can be found in Roy Dommett's Source Material for the Border Morris Tradition  Revival  Dancing at Monmouth, as part of the Olympic torch relay, 2012 In the 1960s, E.C. Cawte, the folklorist, proposed that these dances from the English side of the Welsh borders ‚Äì Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire ‚Äì constituted a Welsh border tradition. Music for The Widders Since the 1960s and with further collecting in the 1970s by people such as Dave Jones (late of Silurian Morris, founded 1969, and later the Not For Joes) and Keith Francis (of Silurian Morris) a distinctive border morris style has grown. The tradition is characterised by black faces, tattered shirts or coats, much stick-clashing and a big band traditionally comprising melodeons, fiddles, concertinas, triangles and tambourines, although they now often also feature a tuba or sousaphone, and flute or oboe. Under the guidance of Dave Jones and Keith Francis, Silurian Border Morris sought to interpret the collected dance material, preserving as much of the traditional styles and features as can be deduced. By contrast, in 1975, John Kirkpatrick created a new border tradition with the Shropshire Bedlams, which seeks to capture the spirit of the border sides, but not recreate any specific tradition or dance. Their dances feature much \\"whooping\\" and this has become characteristic amongst many other border sides. Perhaps in keeping with the original tradition, the Original Welsh Border Morris (founded 1973) meet only once a year, at Christmas, and dance the traditional dances of Herefordshire and Worcestershire. With many of the newer sides, the dances have often become complex, involving many invented and evolved steps, figures and choruses. Many dances were collected by Cecil Sharp and later collectors, and several were included in Bacon's book,Bacon, Lionel 1974 A Handbook of Morris Dances. Published by The Morris Ring but border morris was largely neglected by revival morris sides until late in the 20th century. The Silurian Morris Men of Ledbury, Herefordshire, included border dances in performances from the early 1970s and changed exclusively to border morris in 1979, and the Shropshire Bedlams were founded in 1975; both became pioneers of a resurgence of border morris among revival sides in the following decades. Silurian Border Morris Men dancing Black Ladies Aston, at Saddleworth Rushcart, August 2013 The Leominster Morris were reformed in 1988, split from The Breinton Morris (who disbanded after a further ten years) and made contact with one of the musicians from the previous side from the 1930s, Tom Postons. His recollections of the dancing of the time as having \\"lots of bowing, hat- raising, and clashing of sticks on the ground\\" led to the \\"revival\\" of Postons' stick dance. Cecil Sharp visited the town on 27 December 1909 with local folklorist Ella Mary Leather, and collected tunes from the prolific local gypsy fiddler John Locke. The Leominster men use several of Locke's tunes in their repertoire today. Border morris dancing was different on the Welsh side of the border, and a team on the Welsh side was formed in 1992. Initially the side was named Morys ar y Clwt but it was changed to Carreg-las in 1997. They use traditional Welsh and English folk and morris dance tunes. Carreg-las translates from the Welsh as 'bluestone', a rock found locally in the Preseli Mountains, of which it is said Stonehenge was constructed. Theories of origins of blackface Silurian Border Morris Men, at Saddleworth Rushcart, August 2013 The origins of the blackface are much debated and remain unclear. However, various theories exist, and these are discussed below. 15th-century Moorish mimicry A small statue of a \\"Moriskent√§nzer\\" made by Erasmus Grasser in 1480 for Old Townhall in Munich, one of a set of 16, of which only 10 remain. This dancer has an appearance which would be described at the time as \\"moorish\\", but all the other 9 surviving carvings are fairer-skinned. All wear bells on their legs. The term morris is believed to be from the late Middle English word morys, a variant of the word moorish ‚Äì from the Moors of Morocco; this explanation was cited as early as 1801. Carved figures from 1480 in Munich, Germany, show \\"Moriskent√§nzer\\" with bells, including one of the ten extant having African features. Later evidence from France includes this quote from Thoinot Arbeau circa 1580: \\"In fashionable society when I was young, a small boy, his face daubed with black and his forehead swathed in a white or yellow handkerchief, would make an appearance after supper. He wore leggings covered with little bells and performed a morris\\". However, the precise linkage between the morris in France and England at that time remains unclear. Henry VII may have become familiar with French morris during his time in France, and is recorded as having morris at his own court in England (see below). Another theory is that the blackface tradition derives from earlier forms of the dance involving a Moroccan king and his followers. There is recorded evidence from 1688 of payments in Shrewsbury of 10 shillings to \\"Ye Bedlam Morris\\" and 2 shillings for \\"Ye King of Morocco\\". Evidence of the 18th-century association of black faces with morris is given by the description of the Betley Window (a stained- glass window in Betley Hall, Staffordshire, from around 1621, depicting morris dancers) by its owner, George Tollet (1725‚Äì1779). Writing in 1778, he states \\"we are authorised ... to call some of the representations on my window, Morris Dancers, though I am uncertain whether it exhibits one Moorish personage, as none of them have black or tawny faces, nor do they brandish swords or staves in their hands, nor are they, in their shirts adorned with ribbons.\\" Gallop (1934) questions the Moorish link, quoting both Douce and Cecil Sharp who felt the English dance was too dissimilar in style and appearance to be derived from the continental European Moorish dances believed to be of Moorish origin. Sharp himself appears to have changed his view between 1906, when he saw a link between the black faces of English morris and the dancers on the Franco‚ÄìSpanish border, and 1912, when he viewed the dance to be a pan-European custom possibly corrupted by Moorish influence. He argued that the name Moorish was used as a description of an existing earlier tradition, not because the dancers represented Moors. Gallop goes on to examine the linkage between the English morris dance and the mouriscada or morisca dances of Spain and Portugal, which involve ritual, choreographed battles between the Christians and Moors or Turks, often to music, involving swords and handkerchiefs. Gallop asks whether the Christian‚ÄìMoorish link is actually a later interpretation of earlier pagan mock battles between Summer and Winter, such as that fought on May Day on the Isle of Man between the Queens of Summer and Winter. He argues that in parts of Portugal and the Basque Country, the word moor is also used to mean 'pagan', and that perhaps morris dance originally meant 'pagan dance', and that bells and disguised faces are a common feature of pagan ritual. Thus, for Gallop, the Moorish link is coincidental and the true origins are much older and pagan. This view remains popular for many today. Disguise Blackface and disguise, often in a pagan themed context have their own history which intersects with morris tradition. There is evidence from the 1450s onward of the blackening of faces with charcoal as a means to evade identification, and in association with pagan themes. In the Kent and Essex enclosure riots of 1450‚Äì51 men cross- dressed as 'Queen of the Fairies' (similar to the related Doamna Z√Ænelor, of the CƒÉlu»ôari) including those wearing blackface. > An event which took place in the autumn of 1450 illustrates well the way in > which the often separate activities of poaching and protest could on > occasion conflate. On October 1450 a large group of men entered the duke of > Buckingham's park at Penshurst in Kent and carried off eighty-two deer. > Thirty-two men, nineteen of them yeomen, were named in subsequent indictment > which made clear that a good number had escaped by its claim that there had > been a total of a hundred present (not a figure to be taken too literally). > These armed men had charcoaled faces, wore long false beards and withheld > their names, calling themselves servants of the Queen of the Fairies. The Rebels' Proclamation of 1489 following on the Black Act a few years prior, provides another contemporary example of disguise in British folk tradition. > In a letter of May 1489 to his brother John Paston III, William Paston III > included a copy of the proclamation issued by the rebels shortly after the > murder of the earl of Northumberland. Addressing the 'Northe partys of > England', this proclamation summoned 'euery lorde, knyght, esquyer, > gentylman, and yeman' to array themselves 'for to geynsstonde suche persons > as is abowtward for to dystroy owre suffereyn lorde the Kynge and the > Comowns of Engelond for suche vnlawfull poyntys as Synt Thomas of > Cauntyrbery dyed for'.

Barbara Lowe's (1957) review of early records of the morris in England cites one of the earliest recorded mentions of the morris in England, with Henry VII paying \\"Master Wentworth ¬£6 13s. 4d. 'towards the making of a disguising for a morysse'\\" in September 1501. She goes on to describe later accounts of Henry VIII's Shrovetide banquet for ambassadors in 1509, in which the torchbearers \\"were appareyled in crymosen satyne and grene lyke Moreskoes, their faces blacke\\". The following year, in 1510, \\"there was a Pageant like a mountain, out of which came a Lady of Gold, and the children of honour called the Henchemen, which were freshly disguysed, and danced a Morice before the Kyng\\". Lowe (1957) also quotes from The Booke of all maner of Orders concerning an Erles House, dating from around 1510, which provides rules for \\"plays, interludes and disguisings, including Morrises\\" and states, \\"If a Morris is to be performed, it should take place after the disguising\\". Thus the link to blackened faces, and between morris dance and disguise, is clearly established by the early 16th century, although the nature of that disguise is broader than simply a black face, and includes all manner of elaborate costumes. E. C. Cawte's (1963) work on morris dancing in Herefordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire quotes A History of Shrewsbury regarding the Visitation at St. Mary's Parish Church, Shrewsbury, in 1584, when it was asked, \\"Whether there have bene any lords of mysrule, or somer lords and ladies, or any disguised persons, as morice dancers, maskers or mumm'ers, or such lyke, within the parishe, ether in the nativititide or in som'er, or at any other tyme, and what be their names?\\" It is thus clear that in Shrewsbury, on the Welsh border, morris dancers were associated with disguise in the 16th century. The explanation of disguise is also given for the blackface in the later periods, and that during the hard winters of the 17th and 18th century, out of work labourers and builders sought to anonymously supplement their income by a bit of dancing and begging. The use of blackface as a form of disguise is established in early 18th-century England. In 1723 it became a capital offence under the Waltham \\"Black Act\\" to appear \\"in disguise, either by mask or by blackened face\\". Certainly by the 17th century, border morris seems to have degenerated into a source of public nuisance, as many of Lowe's (1957) primary accounts recall. 19th-century minstrelsy Chloe Metcalfe (2013) and Richard Carlin (2008) question the link between the American minstrel shows into Victorian England in the late 1830s and the morris. By the early 20th century, border morris dancing was referred to colloquially by some as \\"nigger dancing\\" or \\"going niggering\\". Some view this as direct evidence of the link with minstrel shows. Theresa Buckland's (1990) research details the linkages between the 19th-century Lancashire Britannia Coconut Dancers and minstrel shows, although it does not discuss any link to Welsh border morris. She argued, \\"The 'disguise' function of the costume has most likely been influences by Cecil Sharp's [1911] interpretation of the black face [...] which has been repeated in various publications and ephemera of the English Folk Dance and Song Society ... The dancers have been exposed to information from these publications, whether first-hand or further removed.\\" The argument of disguise is used to \\"explain away\\" the blackface, while the black faces of dancers have radically different symbolic potential than that of the faces of supposedly disguised labourers. According to the American Morris News (2005), \\"It is most commonly thought that the origin and function of blackface in Morris dancing lies in primitive disguise rather than an imitation of black men. However, this is not definitely the case. Accounts of the Morris of Shakespeare's time make no mention of blackface, while the border teams contemporary with minstrel shows typically blacked up. American minstrel shows, if not the actual origin of blackface among Morris dancers, at least contributed to its popularity.\\" Robert Hornback (2008) has a different viewpoint, comparing border morris to crude parodies of African tribal war dances, and cites the blackface of Morris dancing as part of racist practices in Britain that predate American minstrelsy and, in fact, contribute to the minstrel tradition. Modern interpretations The Widders dancing at Chepstow Apple Day, 2013 Canadian academic Pauline Greenhill, commenting on morris dancing in Canada, writes that In an ethnographic study of Morris dancing, Greenhill states that the blackface practices of other English dances \\"only underscores the colonial complicity of Morris, particularly for non- English, nonwhite audiences.\\" It is possible that the interpretation of the blackface changed over the centuries ‚Äì from Moroccan mimicry, to disguise, to a minstrel-inspired costume and back to disguise. To avoid controversy, some modern sides wear masks or colour their faces in different colours. Changing times Regardless of the historical basis for black face disguise in border morris, the practice has become increasingly controversial. Although initially confined to specific folk events or newspaper articles, the issue was brought into focus by the rapidly changed social awareness following the George Floyd Protests and growing international impact of the Black Lives Matter movement. This led to the Morris Ring issuing a statement on 3 July 2020 This was in part motivated by an opinion piece written by the UK far- right organisation Patriotic Alternative on 1 July 2020, encouraging their followers to take up Morris Dancing (of all kinds, not specifically Border Morris) and rejected in a statement the following day by the Joint Morris Organisation. On 3 July 2020, the Joint Morris Organisation, representing the Morris Federation, the Morris Ring and Open Morris, issued a press statement to The Telegraph newspaper in the UK, stating, References External links  * https://www.academia.edu/5468139/To_Black_up_Or_Not_to_Black_Up_A_Personal_Journey * http://www.great-western.org.uk/dommett/BlackFace.pdf * https://web.archive.org/web/20120222000637/http://www.ironmenandseverngilders.org/ *Border Morris: Roots & Revival, Gordon Ashman * Visit to Herefordshire and Worcestershire, May 1957.

Ehrenburg is among the most prolific and notable authors of the Soviet Union; he published around one hundred titles. He became known first and foremost as a novelist and a journalist ‚Äì in particular, as a reporter in three wars (First World War, Spanish Civil War and the Second World War). His articles on the Second World War have provoked intense controversies in West Germany, especially during the sixties. The novel The Thaw gave its name to an entire era of Soviet politics, namely, the liberalization after the death of Joseph Stalin. Ehrenburg's travel writing also had great resonance, as did to an arguably greater extent his memoir People, Years, Life, which may be his best known and most discussed work. The Black Book, edited by him and Vassily Grossman, has special historical significance; detailing the genocide on Soviet citizens of Jewish ancestry by the Nazis, it is the first documentary work on the Holocaust. In addition, Ehrenburg wrote a succession of works of poetry. Life and work Ehrenburg, early 20th century Ilya Ehrenburg was born in Kiev, Russian Empire to a Lithuanian-Jewish family; his father was an engineer. Ehrenburg's family was not religiously affiliated; he came into contact with the religious practices of Judaism only through his maternal grandfather. Ehrenburg never joined any religious denomination. He learned no Yiddish, although he edited the Black Book, which was written in Yiddish. He considered himself Russian and, later, a Soviet citizen, but left all his papers to Israel's Yad Vashem. He took strong public positions against antisemitism. He wrote in Russian even during his many years abroad. When Ehrenburg was four years old, the family moved to Moscow, where his father had been hired as director of a brewery. At school, he met Nikolai Bukharin, who was two grades above him; the two remained friends until Bukharin's death in 1938 during the Great Purge. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1905, both Ehrenburg and Bukharin got involved in illegal activities of the Bolshevik organisation. In 1908, when Ehrenburg was seventeen years old, the tsarist secret police (Okhrana) arrested him for five months. He was beaten up and lost some teeth. Finally he was allowed to go abroad and chose Paris for his exile. In Paris, he started to work in the Bolshevik organisation, meeting Vladimir Lenin and other prominent exiles. But soon he left these circles and the Communist Party. Ehrenburg became attached to the bohemian life in the Paris quarter of Montparnasse. He began to write poems, regularly visited the caf√©s of Montparnasse and got acquainted with a lot of artists, especially Pablo Picasso, Diego Rivera, Jules Pascin, and Amedeo Modigliani. Foreign writers whose works Ehrenburg translated included those of Francis Jammes. During World War I, Ehrenburg became a war correspondent for a St. Petersburg newspaper. He wrote a series of articles about the mechanized war that later on were also published as a book (The Face of War). His poetry now also concentrated on subjects of war and destruction, as in On the Eve, his third lyrical book. Nikolai Gumilev, a famous symbolistic poet, wrote favourably about Ehrenburg's progress in poetry. In 1917, after the revolution, Ehrenburg returned to Russia. At that time he tended to oppose the Bolshevik policy, being shocked by the constant atmosphere of violence. He wrote a poem called \\"Prayer for Russia\\" which compared the Storming of the Winter Palace to rape. In 1920 Ehrenburg went to Kiev where he experienced four different regimes in the course of one year: the Germans, the Cossacks, the Bolsheviks, and the White Army. After antisemitic pogroms, he fled to Koktebel on the Crimea peninsula where his old friend from Paris days, Maximilian Voloshin, had a house. Finally, Ehrenburg returned to Moscow, where he soon was arrested by the Cheka but freed after a short time. He became a Soviet cultural activist and journalist who spent much time abroad as a writer. He wrote modernistic picaresque novels and short stories popular in the 1920s, often set in Western Europe (The Extraordinary Adventures of Julio Jurenito and his Disciples (1922), Thirteen Pipes). Ehrenburg continued to write philosophical poetry, using more freed rhythms than in the 1910s. In 1929 he published The Life of the Automobile, a communist variant of the it-narrative genre. As a friend of many of the European Left, Ehrenburg was frequently allowed by Stalin to visit Europe and to campaign for peace and socialism. In 1936‚Äì39, he was a war journalist in the Spanish civil war, but also got involved directly in the military activities of the Republican camp. World War II Ilya Ehrenburg with Red Army soldiers in 1942 Ehrenburg was offered a column in Krasnaya zvezda (the Red Army newspaper) days after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of the war, he had published more than 2,000 articles in Soviet newspapers. He saw the Great Patriotic War as a dramatic contest between good and evil. In his articles, moral and life-affirming Red Army soldiers faced off against a dehumanized German enemy. In 1943, Ehrenburg, working with the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, began to collect material for what would become The Black Book of Soviet Jewry, documenting the Holocaust. In a December 1944 article in Pravda, Ehrenburg declared that the Germans' greatest crime was their murder of six million Jews. His incendary articles calling for vengeance against the German enemy won him a huge following among front-line Soviet soldiers, who sent him much fan mail. As a consequence, he is one of many Soviet writers, along with Konstantin Simonov and Aleksey Surkov, who have been accused by many of \\"[lending] their literary talents to the hate campaign\\" against Germans.Orlando Figes The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia, 2007, , page 414. Austrian historian Arnold Suppan argued that Ehrenburg \\"agitated in the style of Nazi racist ideology\\", with statements such as: This notorious pamphlet, titled \\"Kill\\", was written during the Battle of Stalingrad. Ehrenburg accompanied the Soviet forces during the East Prussian Offensive and criticized the indiscriminate violence against German civilians, for which he was reprimanded by Stalin. However, his words were later reinterpreted as license for atrocities against German civilians during the Soviet invasion of Germany in 1945. Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels accused Ehrenburg of advocating the rape of German women. However, Ehrenburg denied this and historian Antony Beevor considers it a Nazi fabrication. In January 1945, Adolf Hitler claimed that \\"Stalin's court lackey, Ilya Ehrenburg, declares that the German people must be exterminated.\\" After criticism by Georgy Aleksandrov in Pravda in April 1945,–¢–æ–≤–∞—Ä–∏—â –≠—Ä–µ–Ω–±—É—Ä–≥ —É–ø—Ä–æ—â–∞–µ—Ç. vivovoco.rsl.ru Ehrenburg responded that he never meant wiping out the German people, but only German aggressors who came to our soil with weapons, because \\"we are not Nazis\\" who fight with civilians.–ü–ò–°–¨–ú–û –ò.–ì. –≠–†–ï–ù–ë–£–†–ì–ê –ò.–í. –°–¢–ê–õ–ò–ù–£. vivovoco.rsl.ru Ehrenburg fell into disgrace at that time and it is estimated that Aleksandrov's article was a signal of change in Stalin's policy towards Germany.Joshua Rubenstein: Tangled Loyalties.

Ehrenburg escaped this purge and continued to publish and travel abroad. He was accused of informing on his comrades, but there is no evidence to support this theory. On 21 September 1948, at the behest of Politburo members Lazar Kaganovich and Georgii Malenkov, Ehrenburg published an article in Pravda arguing that Jews deserved their own state and condemned antisemitism. In February 1953, he refused to denounce the supposed Doctors‚Äô Plot and wrote a letter to Stalin opposing collective punishment of Jews. In 1954, Ehrenburg published a novel titled The Thaw that tested the limits of censorship in the post-Stalin Soviet Union. It portrayed a corrupted and despotic factory boss, a \\"little Stalin\\", and told the story of his wife, who increasingly feels estranged from him, and the views he represents. In the novel, the spring thaw comes to represent a period of change in the characters' emotional journeys, and when the wife eventually leaves her husband, this coincides with the melting of the snow. Thus, the novel can be seen as a representation of the thaw, and the increased freedom of the writer after the 'frozen' political period under Stalin. In August 1954, Konstantin Simonov attacked The Thaw in articles published in Literaturnaya gazeta, arguing that such writings are too dark and do not serve the Soviet state.Orlando Figes The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia, 2007, , pages 590‚Äì591. The novel gave its name to the Khrushchev Thaw. Just prior to publishing the book, however, Ehrenburg received the Stalin Peace Prize in 1952. Ehrenburg is particularly well known for his memoirs (People, Years, Life in Russian, published with the title Memoirs: 1921-1941 in English), which contain many portraits of interest to literary historians and biographers. In this book, Ehrenburg was the first legal Soviet author to mention positively a lot of names banned under Stalin, including the one of Marina Tsvetaeva. At the same time he disapproved of the Russian and Soviet intellectuals who had explicitly rejected Communism or defected to the West. He also criticized writers like Boris Pasternak, author of Doctor Zhivago, for not having been able to understand the course of history. Ehrenburg's memoirs were criticized by the more conservative faction among the Soviet writers, concentrated around the journal Oktyabr. For example, as the memoirs were published, Vsevolod Kochetov reflected on certain writers who are \\"burrowing in the rubbish heaps of their crackpot memories.\\" For the contemporary reader though, the work appears to have a distinctly Marxist-Leninist ideological flavor characteristic to a Soviet-era official writer. He was also active in publishing the works by Osip Mandelstam when the latter had been posthumously rehabilitated but still largely unacceptable for censorship. Ehrenburg was also active as a poet till his last days, depicting the events of World War II in Europe, the Holocaust and the destinies of Russian intellectuals. Death Ilya Ehrenburg's grave with a wire reproduction of his portrait by Picasso Ehrenburg died in 1967 of prostate and bladder cancer, and was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, where his gravestone is adorned with a reproduction of his portrait drawn by his friend Pablo Picasso.

And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land. So I'm happy, tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.\\"  Divine promise  Yahweh (God) shows Moses the Promised Land (Frans Pourbus the Elder, c. 1565‚Äì80) The promise that is the basis of the term is contained in several verses of Genesis in the Torah. In it is said: :The LORD had said to Abram, \\"Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I will show you.\\" and in : : The LORD appeared to Abram and said, \\"To your offspring [or seed] I will give this land.\\" Commentators have noted several problems with this promise and related ones: # It is to Abram's descendants that the land will (in the future tense) be given, not to Abram directly nor there and then. However, in it is said: He also said to him, \\"I am the LORD, who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it.\\" However, how this verse relates to the promises is a matter of controversy. # There is nothing in the promise to indicate God intended it be applied to Abraham‚Äôs physical descendants unconditionally, exclusively (to nobody but these descendants), exhaustively (to all of them) or in perpetuity. # Jewish commentators drawing on Rashi's comments to the first verse in the Bible, assert that no human collective ever has any a priori claim to any piece of land on the planet, and that only God decides which group inhabits which land in any point in time. This interpretation has no contradictions since the idea that the Jewish people have a claim to ownership rights on the physical land is based on the idea of God deciding to give the land to the Jewish people and commanding them to occupy it as referred to in Biblical texts previously mentioned. In the boundary of the Promised Land is clarified in terms of the territory of various ancient peoples, as follows: : On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram and said, \\"To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates - the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaite, Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites and Jebusites.\\" The verse is said to describe what are known as \\"borders of the Land\\" (Gevulot Ha-aretz).Kol Torah, vol. 13, no. 9, Torah Academy of Bergen County, Nov 8, 2003 In Jewish tradition, these borders define the maximum extent of the land promised to the descendants of Abraham through his son Isaac and grandson Jacob.See 6th and 7th portion commentaries by Rashi The promise was confirmed to Jacob at , though the borders are still vague and is in terms of \\"the land on which you are lying\\". Other geographical borders are given in which describes borders as marked by the Red Sea, the \\"Sea of the Philistines\\" i.e. the Mediterranean, and the \\"River,\\" (the Euphrates). The promise is fulfilled in the biblical book of Joshua when the Israelites cross the Jordan river into the promised land for the first time. Pastoral scene of the Promised Land It took a long time before the Israelites could subdue the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. The furthest extent of the Land of Israel was achieved during the time of the united Kingdom of Israel under David.Stuart, Douglas K., Exodus, B&H; Publishing Group, 2006, p. 549Tyndale Bible Dictionary, Walter A. Elwell, Philip Wesley Comfort, Tyndale House Publishers, Inc., 2001, p. 984 The actual land controlled by the Israelites has fluctuated considerably over time, and at times the land has been under the control of various empires. However, under Jewish tradition, even when it is not in Jewish occupation, the land has not lost its status as the Promised Land.  Descendants of Abraham  The concept is central to Zionism. In 1896, Herzl exhorted Jews to take up the movement, writing \\"for these have never lost the faith in the Promised Land\\". Traditional Jewish interpretation, and that of most Christian commentators, define Abraham's descendants as Abraham's seed only through his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob, to the exclusion of Ishmael and Esau. Parshah In-Depth - Lech-Lecha This may however reflect an eisegesis or reconstruction of primary verses based on the later biblical emphasis of Jacob's descendants. The promises given to Abraham happened prior to the birth of Isaac and were given to all his offspring signified through the rite of circumcision. Johann Friedrich Karl Keil is less clear, as he states that the covenant is through Isaac, but notes that Ishmael's descendants have held much of that land through time. Biblical commentary on the Old Testament, Volume 1, Carl Friedrich Keil, Franz Delitzsch, p. 224 Mainstream Jewish tradition regards the promise made to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob as having been given to all Jews, including proselytes and in turn their descendants, with the traditional view being that a convert becomes a child of Abraham, as in the term \\"ben Avraham\\". Christian interpretation In the New Testament, the descent and promise is reinterpreted along religious lines. In the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul the Apostle draws attention to the formulation of the promise, avoiding the term \\"seeds\\" in plural (meaning many people), choosing instead \\"seed,\\" meaning one person, who, he understands to be Jesus (and those united with him). For example, in he notes: :\\"The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say ‚Äúand to seeds,‚Äù meaning many people, but ‚Äúand to your seed,‚Äù meaning one person, who is Christ.\\" In Paul goes further, noting that the expansion of the promise from singular to the plural is not based on genetic/physical association, but a spiritual/religious one: :\\"There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham‚Äôs seed, and heirs according to the promise.\\" In it is written: :\\"It was not through the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.\\"  Boundaries from the Book of Numbers  :Boundaries of the 'Promised Land' given in the Book of Numbers (chapter 34) ::The South border. ‚Äî(v. 3) \\"Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward : (v. 4) And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin : and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon : (v. 5) And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.\\" ::The Western border. ‚Äî(v. 6) \\"And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border : this shall be your west border.\\" ::The North border. ‚Äî(v. 7) \\"And this shall be your north border : from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor : (v. 8) From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad : (v 9) And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar-enan : this shall be your north border.\\" ::The East border. ‚Äî(v. 10) \\"And ye shall point out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham : (v. 11) And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward : (v. 12) And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about.\\" :Boundaries of the 'Promised Land' given by Jerome c.400 ::You may delineate the Promised Land of Moses from the Book of Numbers (ch. 34): as bounded on the south by the desert tract called Sina, between the Dead Sea and the city of Kadesh- barnea, [which is located with the Arabah to the east] and continues to the west, as far as the river of Egypt, that discharges into the open sea near the city of Rhinocolara; as bounded on the west by the sea along the coasts of Palestine, Phoenicia, Coele‚ÄëSyria, and Cilicia; as bounded on the north by the circle formed by the Taurus Mountains and Zephyrium and extending to Hamath, called Epiphany‚ÄëSyria; as bounded on the east by the city of Antioch Hippos and Lake Kinneret, now called Tiberias, and then the Jordan River which discharges into the salt sea, now called the Dead Sea.Hieronymus (1910). \\"Epistola CXXIX Ad Dardanum de Terra promissionis (al. 129; scripta circa annum 414ce)\\".

Spyros Simitis, the brother of former Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, characterized Zavos's claims as \\"scientific barbarism\\".

He is best known as Lando Calrissian in the Star Wars franchise, first in the early 1980s, and nearly forty years later in The Rise of Skywalker (2019), marking one of the longest intervals between onscreen portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history. Williams was born in New York City, and raised with his twin sister Loretta in Harlem. In 1945 he made his Broadway theatre debut at age seven in The Firebrand of Florence. He later graduated from The High School of Music & Art, then won a painting scholarship to the National Academy of Fine Arts and Design, where he won a Hallgarten Prize for painting in the mid-1950s. To fund his art supplies he returned to acting, including stage, films, and television. He continued painting; his work has since been shown in galleries and collections worldwide. Williams‚Äô film debut was in The Last Angry Man (1959), but he came to national attention in the television movie, Brian's Song (1971) which earned him an Emmy nomination for Best Actor. He has appeared in at least 70 films over six decades including critically acclaimed and popular movies such as Lady Sings the Blues (1972) and Mahogany (1975), both starring Williams paired with Diana Ross, and Nighthawks (1981). In the 1980s he was cast in his most enduring role as Lando Calrissian, becoming the first African-American actor with a major role in the Star Wars franchise, in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983). He also voiced Lando in video games, animated series, and the National Public Radio adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back. He was inducted into the Black Filmmaker's Hall of Fame in 1984, and earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1985. Another franchise relationship started with Batman (1989), playing attorney Harvey Dent, a role that was developed into a villainous alter-ego, Two-Face, which he voiced for The Lego Batman Movie (2017). Williams's television work has over sixty credits starting in 1966 including recurring roles over the decades in Gideon's Crossing; Dynasty, General Hospital: Night Shift; and General Hospital. Numerous cameos and supporting roles included being paired with Marla Gibbs on The Jeffersons, 227, and The Hughleys. Later work included voice acting in the series Titan Maximum (2009), and appearing on the reality show Dancing with the Stars (2014). His work has earned him numerous awards and honors including three NAACP Image Awards, and the NAACP Lifetime Achievement award. Early life and education William December Williams Jr. was born in New York City, the son of Loretta Anne (1915‚Äì2016), a West Indian-born elevator operator at the Lyceum Theatre and aspiring performer from Montserrat, and William December Williams, Sr. (1910‚Äì2008), an African-American caretaker, with some Native American ancestry from Texas. He grew up in Harlem on 110th Street, between Lenox and 5th, adjacent to Central Park North‚Äì110th Street station. He used to go to Central Park to see the Negro league players and the Cuban baseball league, \\"They were fantastic, and I wound up working with a lot of those guys,\\" (in The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings (1976)). He has a twin sister, Loretta, and they were raised by their maternal grandmother while their parents worked several jobs. His mom had studied opera for years, becoming an accomplished opera star who wanted to break into movies; the family was richly cultured, exposing the children early on to drawing, painting, theatre and similar creative experiences; Billy Dee would remain a fan of the arts including opera. In March 1945 he made his Broadway debut at age seven portraying a page in The Firebrand of Florence, Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin‚Äôs operetta starring Lotte Lenya. His mom, who worked at the theatre, volunteered him for the part which he found boring. Williams attended Booker T. Washington Junior High School where he had dreams of being a painter. He graduated in 1955 from the LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan, where he majored in arts with a focus on visual arts. The school would later be the subject for Fame (1980), and its derivative television series. While there he got a two-year scholarship for the National Academy of Fine Arts and Design in New York‚Äîwhich later changed its name to National Academy of Design‚Äîto study with a focus on \\"classical principles of painting\\". He was nominated at eighteen or nineteen years old for a Guggenheim Fellowship grant‚Äîfor \\"creative ability in the arts,\\" and won a Hallgarten Prize in the mid-1950s. Although he had scholarships to pay for school tuition, he turned to acting to pay for his paints, supplies, and canvasses. His first Broadway theatre \\"big break\\" was a play, A Taste of Honey. He continued to struggle as an actor for ten years working as an extra, doing small and large theatre, and \\"slowly breaking into television and film\\". During art school he gained interest in the Stanislavsky Method‚Äîexperiencing a role contrasted with representing it, to mobilize an actor's conscious thought and will to in turn activate emotional response and subconscious behavior‚Äîand began studying at the Harlem Actors Workshop.Benedetti (1999a, 201), Carnicke (2000, 17), and Stanislavski (1938, 16‚Äî36 \\"art of representation\\" corresponds to Mikhail Shchepkin's \\"actor of reason\\" and his \\"art of experiencing\\" corresponds to Shchepkin's \\"actor of feeling\\"; see Benedetti (1999a, 202). * Benedetti, Jean. 1999a.

It was run by blacklisted actor Paul Mann who embraced actors of all races; Williams also studied there under Sidney Poitier. He first viewed his acting as a way to pay for his art supplies, by the early 1960s though he began to \\"devote all of his energy to performance.\\" In succession he got an actor agent through a friend, started getting major Off-Broadway roles, then work on Broadway. Career=Stage Billy Dee Williams with Joan Plowright in A Taste of Honey on Broadway in 1960 Williams first appeared on Broadway in 1945 in The Firebrand of Florence. He returned to Broadway as an adult in 1960 in the adaptation of The Cool Word. He appeared in A Taste of Honey in 1960. A 1976 Broadway production, I Have a Dream, was directed by Robert Greenwald and starred Williams as Martin Luther King Jr. His most recent Broadway appearance was in August Wilson's Fences, as a replacement for James Earl Jones in the role of Troy Maxson in 1988. Break into film and television Williams made his film debut in 1959 in The Last Angry Man, opposite Paul Muni, in which he portrayed a delinquent young man. He was frustrated in the 1960s with the \\"paucity of parts for leading black men,\\" the majority of roles he wanted went to Sidney Poitier. He enjoyed doing theater and television, but \\"his slow-building film career ate at him.\\" He found LSD, a popular hallucinogenic drug with the era's hippie movement to be a cure, \\"LSD saved my life ... I wasn't doing it to get high. It let me get inside of myself.\\" Otherwise he is anti-drug. He rose to stardom after starring in the critically acclaimed television film Brian's Song (1971), in which he played Chicago Bears star football player Gale Sayers, who stood by his friend Brian Piccolo (James Caan), during Piccolo's struggle with terminal cancer. Both Williams and Caan were nominated for Emmy Awards for best actor for their performances. Williams said the role was the one of which he was most proud \\"It was a love story, really. Between two guys. Without sex. ... It ended up being a kind of breakthrough in terms of racial division.\\" Williams' success with Brian's Song earned him a seven-year contract with Motown's Berry Gordy. He became one of America's most well-known black film actors of the 1970s, after starring in a string of critically acclaimed and popular movies, many of them in the \\"blaxploitation\\" genre. In 1972, he starred as Billie Holiday's husband Louis McKay in Motown Productions' Academy Award-nominated Holiday biopic Lady Sings the Blues. Through his portrayal he became \\"a full-fledged sex symbol, touted as the 'black Clark Gable.'\\" Diana Ross starred in Lady Sings the Blues opposite Williams; Motown paired the two of them again three years later in the successful follow-up project Mahogany.  1980‚Äìpresent  Williams was cast as Lando Calrissian in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), becoming the first African-American actor with a major role in the Star Wars series. J. J. Abrams, who would direct Williams in the ninth installment film in 2019, noted, \\"Lando was always written as a complex, contradictory, nuanced character. And Billy Dee played him to suave perfection, ... It wasn't just that people of color were seeing themselves represented; they were seeing themselves represented in a rich, wonderful, intriguing way.\\" He would reprise the role soon after in Return of the Jedi (1983). Between the latter two films, he starred alongside Sylvester Stallone as a cop in the thriller Nighthawks (1981). The charm of his role as Lando Calrissian proved to be popular with audiences. Williams has voiced the character in the 2002 video game Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast, the audio dramatization of Dark Empire, the National Public Radio adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back, two productions for the Star Wars: Battlefront series, The Lego Movie, and in two episodes of the animated TV series Star Wars Rebels. Some fans were disappointed with Calrissian's absence from the first film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens, but in July 2018 it was announced that he would reprise his role in The Rise of Skywalker (2019), marking one of the longest intervals between onscreen portrayals of a character by the same actor in American film history. Williams co-starred in 1989's Batman as district attorney Harvey Dent, a role that was planned to develop into Dent's alter-ego, the villain Two-Face, in sequels. However, that never came to pass; he was set to reprise the role in the sequel Batman Returns, but his character was deleted and replaced with villain Max Shreck. When Joel Schumacher stepped in to direct Batman Forever, where Two-Face was to be a secondary villain, Schumacher decided to hire Tommy Lee Jones for the role. There was a rumor that Schumacher had to pay Williams a fee in order to hire Jones, but Williams said that it was not true: \\"You only get paid if you do the movie. I had a two-picture deal with Star Wars. They paid me for that, but I only had a one picture deal for Batman.\\" Williams eventually voiced Two- Face in the 2017 film The Lego Batman Movie. Williams' television work included a recurring guest-starring role on the short-lived show Gideon's Crossing. He is also known for his advertisements for Colt 45, a malt liquor, for a five-year period starting in the mid-1980s; he would reprise his spokesperson role in 2016. Williams brushed off criticism‚Äîfor the subtext of the ad campaign, 'works every time,' and the target audience‚Äîof the choice, \\"I drink, you drink. Hell, if marijuana was legal, I'd appear in a commercial for it.\\" Colt 45 hired Williams \\"simply because he was so cool,\\" and went from trailing behind Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company in barrels produced, to \\"skyrocketing\\" a year after the 1986 ads ran to two million barrels in the top spot for malt liquor. In the 1984‚Äì1985 season of Dynasty, he played Brady Lloyd opposite Diahann Carroll. Williams was paired with actress Marla Gibbs on three situation comedies: The Jeffersons (Gibbs's character, Florence, was in love with Williams and challenged him on everything because she thought Williams was an imposter); 227 (her character, Mary, pretending to be royalty, met Williams at a banquet); and The Hughleys (Gibbs and Williams portrayed Darryl's parents). In 1992, he portrayed Berry Gordy in The Jacksons: An American Dream. In 1993, Williams made a guest appearance on the spin-off to The Cosby Show, A Different World, as Langston Paige, a grumpy landlord, in a backdoor pilot for his own series. Williams appeared as himself on Martin where he provided Martin Lawrence's character with advice on getting back together with Gina. Williams made a special guest appearance on the hit sketch comedy show In Living Color in 1990. He portrayed Pastor Dan in an episode of That '70s Show. In this episode, \\"Baby Don't You Do It\\" (2004), his character is obsessed with Star Wars, and uses this to help counsel Eric Forman (himself a Star Wars fan) and Donna Pinciotti about his premarital relationship. Williams made a cameo appearance as himself on the television series Lost in the episode \\"Expos√©\\". He also appears regularly on short clips on the Jimmy Kimmel Live! as a semi-parody of himself. In February 2006, Williams guest starred as himself in the season 5 episode \\"Her Story II\\" of Scrubs, where he plays the godfather of Julie (Mandy Moore). Turk hugs him, calling him \\"Lando\\", even though he prefers to be called Billy Dee. Williams played Toussaint Dubois for General Hospital: Night Shift in 2007 and 2008. Williams reprised his role as Toussaint on General Hospital beginning in June 2009. Also in 2009, Williams took on the role of the voice of Admiral Bitchface, the head of the military on the planet Titan, in the Adult Swim animated series Titan Maximum. In July 2010, Williams appeared in the animated series The Boondocks, where he voiced a fictionalized version of himself in the episode \\"The Story of Lando Freeman\\". In February 2011, Williams appeared as a guest star on USA Network's White Collar as Ford, an old friend of Neal Caffrey's landlady June, played by Diahann Carroll. In February 2012, Williams was the surprise guest during a taping of The Oprah Winfrey Show spotlighting Diana Ross. Ross and Williams were reunited after having not seen each other in 29 years. In October 2012, Williams appeared as a guest star on NCIS in Season 10 Episode 5 titled \\"Namesake\\", as Gibbs's namesake and his father's former best friend, Leroy Jethro Moore. On January 9, 2013, Williams made a cameo appearance as himself on Modern Family, season 4, episode 11 \\"New Year's Eve\\". In 2014 Williams competed on the 18th season of Dancing with the Stars, a reality show/dancing competition partnered with professional dancer Emma Slater. The couple had to withdraw from the competition on the third week due to an injury to Williams's back. Over the years, Williams has been a featured guest at fan conventions, mostly science fiction ones for his iconic Lando Calrissian role in the Star Wars franchise. Of his fan interactions he has said they have mostly been positive ones, \\"I love every single moment of it, I'll have an audience for the rest of my life.\\"  Return to painting  In the late 1980s, Williams resumed painting devoting much of his time to the work. He returned to New York to star in August Wilson's play Fences replacing James Earl Jones in the lead for four months starting in February 1988. It marked a turning point for him, returning home, and for him, the center of the art scene. He also renewed his friendship with Peter Max who had also trained, and sold art in the city, and renewed Williams' interest in painting. Within a two-year span he ‚Äúcranked out 120 original works of art.\\" Williams is the honorary chairman of Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz (TMIJ) in Washington, D.C., which fosters jazz education. TMIJ uses his artwork each year for its competition programs since 1990. He had his first solo exhibition in 1991 followed by many throughout North America, and later, the world. Around 1992, Williams, inspired by his friend and fellow New York artist Peter Max who had a teapot collection, started a cookie jar collection. Being an opera fan, he first found a jar in the shape of a singer in an opera gift shop by artisan couple Michael and Shelley Buonaiuto; later buying more than a dozen from their limited lines including ones of jazz artists Josephine Baker and Fats Waller. His 1993 self-portrait is at the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution (Washington D.C.) with a description that he \\"specializes in acrylic paintings combining traditional brushwork with an airbrushing technique\\"; he also works in oils. Williams painted a series of impressionistic portraits of the Tuskegee Airmen, the \\"African-American pilots whose real-life exploits changed the course of American military history.\\" He started the series in the 1990s but when officials from National Air and Space Museum (NASM) saw them they wanted more, and to use them in an exhibition. In 1999 they were displayed at the African-American Museum of Art, Culture and History in New Orleans, and in early 2000, the NASM in Washington, D.C. He was commissioned for four paintings‚Äîincluding one of track and field star Jesse Owens sprinting, and another of a pair of boxers in a fight ring‚Äîfor Nissan that were displayed at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1997 he did paintings for Walt Disney Company's Mighty Ducks arena for the Anaheim Ducks. From a description, circa late 1990s, at one of the galleries that carries his work, \\"Billy's paintings are usually acrylic on canvas, applied with brush and airbrush. He also works with collage elements and has even created three-dimensional canvasses incorporating ceramic, Lucite, and neon light.\\" He got permission from Star Wars creator George Lucas to sell lithographs of a montage of Williams' iconic character from the franchise, Lando Calrissian. As of 2001 his paintings sold for an average of $10,000 to $35,000 (). \\"I call my paintings 'abstract reality,'\\" said Williams. \\"Sometimes I refer to them as 'impressions/expression.' It's the best way I can explain them.\\" In early 2001 Williams was one of the celebrity artists painting seven-foot angel sculptures as part of the Oscar Academy's sponsoring L.A.'s \\"A Community of Angels\\" charity project. The art angels were displayed for months then auctioned to raise funds for L.A. youth programs. In his online gallery biography, he states, \\"[an] interest in Eastern philosophy characterizes his images, first to record the physical reality, and then to uncover through the application of light, color and perspective. He cites Edward Hopper, M. C. Escher‚Äîthe Dutch Master, Frida Kahlo, Tamara de Lempicka, Thomas Hart Benton, and the exciting, vibrant forms of African art as some of his strongest influences.\\" Williams' work is included at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York, and the American Jazz Museum in Kansas City, Missouri. In a 2001 interview he said, \\"Either I want to drop dead with a paint brush in my hand or I want to drop dead doing a soliloquy on the stage, I love acting. I love it. I take my acting very seriously, but I also find it fun. To do what children do and get paid for it is a lot of fun. I'm very fortunate.\\" In late 2007 he was a guest artist on a ten-day Princess Cruise liner. They bought about eighty pieces which they put on their cruises and then auctioned off. He was commissioned for another set of Disney paintings to be unveiled in 2011 at Disney's D23 Expo, also in Anaheim, California. For those, he set iconic Disney characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse, and Goofy in jazz music settings. In a 2011 interview he said, \\"I mostly create abstract paintings. I paint what's obvious to the eye and then incorporate an abstract point of view, which allows me a lot of space to play in. I work a lot with acrylic and oils, mostly acrylic right now and do a lot of line drawings.\\" In a September 2015 interview he said he finds painting \\"cathartic\\" compared to collective film work, \\"When you're painting you just lock yourself up in your little private world. And it's all about you and your imagination and nobody else interfering with that. It's a great exercise because you really start discovering who you are and what you are without a lot of assistance ‚Ä¶ and the moment you come up with something interesting it's a success that‚Äôs really based on your own personal, private sensibility.\\" As of 2019 he has made around 300 paintings, which Williams sees as his legacy. Other ventures=Let's Misbehave In 1961, Williams recorded a jazz LP produced by Prestige Records entitled Let's Misbehave, on which he sang swing standards. The album, which was a commercial success, earned Williams a spot on Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever (1983). The album included the first- ever vocal recording of \\"A Taste of Honey\\", a song by Bobby Scott and Ric Marlow later covered by The Beatles on their 1963 debut album Please Please Me. Williams was the first to sing the song in the U.S., on the Broadway stage with Joan Plowright as part of the original Broadway production of the play A Taste of Honey. Williams said of the album, \\"Recording it was sort of a lark. I did some singing in clubs, for a moment, and then I stopped. I have too much respect for singers to really think that I'm a singer.\\" The album was re- released on CD, download and streaming platforms in 2014. Thirty years later, in the early 1990s, he sang on a ‚Äúcelebrity-packed charity single,\\" \\"Voices That Care,‚Äù to honor U.S. troop of Operation Desert Storm, the 1990‚Äì1991 Gulf War, and supporting the International Red Cross. The single reached number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100, and number six on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks. Through sales and plays of the song Williams and the other celebrities became platinum-recording and Billboard-charting artists. Video games Williams voiced Lando Calrissian in the video game Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and Star Wars Battlefront as well as the spin-off Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron. However, the Battlefront appearances were archive footage and his voice-appearance in Elite Squadron is left uncredited or unknown. He also played a live-action character, GDI Director Redmond Boyle, in the game Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, which was released in March 2007. This made him the second former Star Wars actor to appear in a Command & Conquer game, with the first being James Earl Jones as GDI General James Solomon in Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun. Williams voiced Lando Calrissian in 2015's Star Wars: Battlefront for the DLC pack Bespin and its 2017 sequel Star Wars Battlefront II. In the 2016 game Let It Die, Williams voices Colonel Jackson, who acts as the 2nd major boss players face. Internet In 2008, Williams reprised his role as Lando Calrissian to appear in a video on Funny or Die in a mock political ad defending himself for leader of the Star Wars galaxy against vicious attack ads from Emperor Palpatine. Williams is currently a cast member of Diary of a Single Mom, a web-based original series directed by award-winning filmmaker Robert Townsend. The series debuted on PIC.tv in 2009.  Books  * PSI/Net (1999), , novel co-written with Rob MacGregor based on an actual government program of psychic spying *JUST/In Time (2001), Personal life Williams has been married three times, and has three children, and two grandchildren. His first marriage was to Audrey Sellers in 1959. They were divorced some years later, after which he apparently became depressed. He stated that \\"there was a period when I was very despondent, broke, depressed, my first marriage was on the rocks.\\" They had a son, Corey Dee Williams, born in 1960. In 1968, Williams married model and actress Marlene Clark in Hawaii. They divorced in 1971. He moved from New York City to California in 1971. He married Teruko Nakagami on December 27, 1972. She brought a daughter, Miyako (born 1962), from her previous marriage to musician Wayne Shorter. Together they have a daughter, Hanako (born 1973). In 1984 he bought a \\"Zen-like contemporary\\" home in the Trousdale Estates neighborhood of Beverly Hills, California; he sold it in 2012. He filed for an amicable divorce from Nakagami in 1993, but they reconciled, and were again living together by 1997. Williams was arrested on January 30, 1996, after allegedly assaulting his live-in girlfriend, whom the police did not identify. He posted a US$50,000 bail. L.A. Police said the woman had minor bruises and scratches. The attorney's office filed misdemeanor charges of spousal battery and dissuading a witness. The woman later stated that the incident was her fault and hoped the police would drop the case. In a plea bargain, Williams agreed to undergo 52 counseling sessions. In a 2019 interview, Williams says he never slapped or abused women. In late 2019, Williams talked about his feminine side in an interview, and used masculine and feminine pronouns to refer to himself. Media outlets widely speculated that Williams might be gender fluid, but he clarified that he was referring to anima and animus: the feminine side of men and the masculine side of women in Jungian psychology.

He was one of the most prominent philanthropists in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, crown land of Austria-Hungary. He was a pioneer who in 1856 built the world's first modern oil refinery.Magdalena Puda-Blokesz, Ignacy ≈Åukasiewicz: ojciec ≈õwiatowego przemys≈Çu naftowego, dzia≈Çacz polityczny i patriota, fi lantrop i spo≈Çecznik, przede wszystkim CZ≈ÅOWIEK Ludwik Tomanek, Ignacy ≈Åukasiewicz tw√≥rca przemys≈Çu naftowego w Polsce, wielki inicjator - wielki ja≈Çmu≈ºnik. ‚Äî Miejsce Piastowe: Komitet Uczczenia Pamiƒôci Ignacego ≈Åukasiewicza ‚Äî 1928 His achievements included the discovery of how to distill kerosene from seep oil, the invention of the modern kerosene lamp (1853), the introduction of the first modern street lamp in Europe (1853), and the construction of the world's first modern oil well (1854). Life=Youth and studies ≈Åada coat-of- arms Ignacy ≈Åukasiewicz was born on 8 March 1822 in Zaduszniki, near Mielec, in the Austrian Empire (after the Partitions of Poland) as the youngest of five children. His family was of Armenian origin. His parents were Apolonia, n√©e ≈öwietlik, and J√≥zef ≈Åukasiewicz, a member of the local intelligentsia nobility entitled to use the ≈Åada coat of arms and a veteran of Ko≈õciuszko's Uprising. The family rented a small manor in Zaduszniki but, soon after Ignacy's birth, financial difficulties forced them to relocate to the nearby city of Rzesz√≥w. There Ignacy entered the local secondary school (Konarski's Gymnasium), but failed to pass the examinations and left in 1836. In order to help his parents and financially support all the relatives, he moved to ≈Åa≈Ñcut, where he began work as a pharmacist's assistant. Toward the end of his life, ≈Åukasiewicz often described his childhood as happy; the home atmosphere was patriotic and somewhat democratic, and he commonly recalled his first tutor, Colonel Woysym-Antoniewicz, who resided in their house. Involvement in political movements Mikolasch's Gold Star Pharmacy Upon moving to ≈Åa≈Ñcut, ≈Åukasiewicz also became involved in several political organizations that supported the idea of restoring Polish sovereignty and independence and participated in many political gatherings around the area. In 1840 he returned to Rzesz√≥w, where he continued working at Edward H√ºbl's private pharmacy. In 1845 he met diplomat and activist Edward Dembowski, who admitted ≈Åukasiewicz to the illegal \\"Centralization of the Polish Democratic Society\\", a party that focused on radical policies and supported a revolt against the Austrian government. The organization's aim was to prepare an all-national uprising against all three partitioning powers. Since the movement was seen as a possible danger to the Austrian monarchy, on 19 February 1846 ≈Åukasiewicz and several other members of the party were arrested by the Austrian authorities and imprisoned in the city of Lw√≥w. However, on 27 December 1847 ≈Åukasiewicz was released from prison due to lack of evidence, but for the rest of his life he was regarded as \\"politically untrustworthy\\" and often observed by local police that was in possession of his records. He was also ordered to remain in Lw√≥w with his elder brother Franciszek. Career as chemist On 15 August 1848 he was employed at one of the biggest and best pharmacies in Austrian Galicia (so-called \\"Austrian Poland\\"); the Golden Star (Pod Z≈ÇotƒÖ GwiazdƒÖ) Pharmacy in Lviv, owned by Piotr Mikolasch. In 1850, a handheld pharmaceutical almanac and a precious document entitled manuskrypt, the joint work of Mikolasch and ≈Åukasiewicz was published. Because of this achievement, the authorities granted him a permit to continue pharmaceutical studies at the Royal Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w. After several years of studies, financed mostly by Mikolasch, he passed all his university examinations except for that in pharmacognosy, which prevented him from graduating. Finally on 30 July 1852 ≈Åukasiewicz graduated from the pharmacy department at the University of Vienna, where he earned a master's degree in pharmaceutics. As soon as he returned to the pharmacy of Piotr Mikolasch in Lviv, he began a new phase of his life devoted to the studies of exploiting kerosene. Galician oil wells Oil wells, Grabownica Starze≈Ñska, 1930s Petroleum industry and oil lamp While oil was known to exist for a long time in the Subcarpathian-Galician region, it was more commonly used as an animal drug and lubricant, but ≈Åukasiewicz was the first person to distill the liquid in Poland and in the world and was able to exploit it for lighting and create a brand new industry. In autumn of 1852 ≈Åukasiewicz, Mikolasch and his colleague John Zeh analyzed the oil, which was provided in a few barrels by traders from the town of Drohobycz. After pharmaceutical methods and processes the purified oil was obtained and sold in the local pharmacies, but the orders were small due to high prices. In early 1854 ≈Åukasiewicz moved to Gorlice, where he continued his work. He set up many companies together with entrepreneurs and landowners. That same year, he opened the world's first oil \\"mine\\" at B√≥brka, near Krosno (still operational as of 2020). At the same time ≈Åukasiewicz continued his work on kerosene lamps. Later that year, he set up the first kerosene street lamp in Gorlice's Zawodzie district. In subsequent years he opened several other oil wells, each as a joint venture with local merchants and businessmen. In 1856 in Ulaszowice, near Jas≈Ço, he opened an \\"oil distillery\\" ‚Äî the world's first industrial oil refinery. As demand for kerosene was still low, the plant initially produced mostly artificial asphalt, machine oil, and lubricants. The refinery was destroyed in an 1859 fire, but was rebuilt at Polanka, near Krosno, the following year. Later life and death By 1863 ≈Åukasiewicz, who had moved to Jas≈Ço in 1858, was a wealthy man. He openly supported the January 1863 Uprising and financed help for refugees. In 1865 he bought a large manor and the village of Chork√≥wka. There he established yet another oil refinery. Having gained one of the largest fortunes in Galicia, ≈Åukasiewicz promoted the development of the oil industry in the areas of Dukla and Gorlice. He gave his name to several oil-mining enterprises in the area, including oil wells at Ropianka, Wilsznia, Smereczne, Ropa, and W√≥jtowa. He also became a regional benefactor and founded a spa resort at B√≥brka, a chapel at Chork√≥wka, and a large church at Zrƒôcin. As one of the best-known businessmen of his time, ≈Åukasiewicz was elected to the Galician Sejm. In 1877 he also organized the first Oil Industry Congress and founded the National Oil Society. Ignacy ≈Åukasiewicz died in Chork√≥wka on 7 January 1882 of pneumonia and was buried in the small cemetery at Zrƒôcin, next to the Gothic Revival church that he had financed. ≈Åukasiewicz married, in 1857, his niece Honorata Stacherska and after losing their only daughter, Marianna, the couple adopted Walentyna Antoniewicz.

It is based at the Fox Studios lot in Century City, California. FX originally launched on June 1, 1994. The network's original programming aspires to the standards of premium cable channels in regard to mature themes and content, high-quality writing, directing and acting. Sister channels FXM and FXX were launched in 1994 and 2013, respectively. FX also carries reruns of theatrical films and terrestrial-network sitcoms. Advertising-free content was available through the FX+ premium subscription service until it was shut down on August 21, 2019. As of September 2018, FX is available to approximately 89.2 million television households (96.7% of households with cable) in the United States. In addition to the flagship U.S. network, the \\"FX\\" name is licensed to a number of related pay television channels in various countries around the world. History=1994‚Äì97: Early years  FX, originally stylized as \\"fX\\", launched on June 1, 1994. Broadcasting from a large \\"apartment\\" in Manhattan's Flatiron District, fX was one of the first forays into large-scale interactive television. The channel centered on original programming, which was broadcast live every day from the \\"fX Apartment,\\" and rebroadcasts of classic television shows from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, such as Batman, Wonder Woman, Eight Is Enough, Nanny and the Professor and The Green Hornet. fX had two taglines during this period: \\"TV Made Fresh Daily\\" and \\"The World's First Living Television Network\\". The \\"f\\" in the channel's name and logo was rendered in lower-case to portray a type of relaxed friendliness; the stylized \\"X\\" represented the channel's roots: the crossing searchlights of the 20th Century Fox logo. The live shows were each mostly focused on one broad topic. Shows included Personal fX (collectibles and antiques), The Pet Department (pets), Under Scrutiny with Jane Wallace (news) and Sound fX (music). The channel's flagship show, Breakfast Time, hosted by Laurie Hibberd and Tom Bergeron, was formatted like an informal magazine show and was an Americanized version of Great Britain's The Big Breakfast. Breakfast Time and Personal fX would regularly feature the channel's \\"roving reporters\\" ‚Äì which included Suzanne Whang, John Burke and Phil Keoghan ‚Äì visiting unique places around the United States live via satellite. Other notable fX personalities included Karyn Bryant and Orlando Jones, who were panelists on Sound fX. The channel prided itself on its interactivity with viewers. fX, in 1994, was an early adopter of the internet, embracing e-mail and the World Wide Web as methods of feedback. Most of the shows would feature instant responses to e-mailed questions, and one show, Backchat (hosted by Jeff Probst), was exclusively devoted to responding to viewer mail, whether sent through e-mail or traditional postal mail. Select viewers were allowed to spend a day at the \\"apartment\\" and take part in all of the channel's shows. Inside the channel's syndicated programming blocks, channel hosts would frequently appear during commercial breaks to read news headlines, respond to e-mails from viewers about the episode that was airing, or to promote upcoming programming. The first incarnation of fX was not available on Time Warner Cable, one of the major cable systems in New York City, where its programming originated. TWC would not carry the channel until September 2001. The live shows gradually disappeared one by one until only Personal fX remained. Breakfast Time was moved to the Fox network and renamed Fox After Breakfast in mid-1996. It underwent several format changes, but never found a substantial audience and was canceled less than a year later. By the time that all live programming (with the exception of Personal fX) was dropped, the channel focused entirely on its classic television shows until its relaunch in mid-1997. Personal fX remained on the refocused FX until May 1, 1998. FX vacated the \\"apartment\\" in the summer of 1998 and the channel's operations were streamlined with the other Fox-owned subscription channels. 1997‚Äì2001: Fox Gone Cable In early 1997, fX was relaunched as \\"FX: Fox Gone Cable\\", refocusing the channel's target audience towards men aged 18 to 49. During the first few years after its relaunch, FX was known for little else than airing reruns of such Fox shows as The X-Files and Married... with Children, as well as 20th Century Fox-produced shows such as M*A*S*H and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The channel also added Major League Baseball games to its lineup at that time (at one point sharing rights with then-sister network Fox Family), and eventually expanded its sports programming to include NASCAR races in 2001. In the summer of 1998, FX debuted three original series: Bobcat's Big Ass Show, Instant Comedy with the Groundlings and Penn & Teller's Sin City Spectacular. All three series were cancelled the following year. Soon after its relaunch, the \\"Fox Gone Cable\\" tagline was dropped. By 1999, new original TV shows were added with the debut of shows such as Son of the Beach (a Baywatch parody that starred Timothy Stack and was executive produced by Howard Stern) and The X Show (a male-oriented late night panel talk show). The channel also acquired the pay-TV syndication rights to reruns of series such as Ally McBeal, NYPD Blue and The Practice for then-record high prices then unseen in the pay-TV industry despite all three 20th Century Fox Television series being under common ownership; when these shows expensively fumbled in primetime, FX predominantly ran movies in its more high-profile time periods, though with the move of premiere film rights from free-to-air broadcast networks to basic cable channels, FX unexpectedly would end up a benefactor of this change. 2002‚Äì07: Emergence in original programming Beginning in 2002, the channel emerged as a major force in original pay-TV programming, gaining both acclaim and notoriety for edgy dramas. That year, FX debuted the police drama The Shield, which became a breakout hit. This trend continued the following year with Nip/Tuck, a drama about two plastic surgeons, and the Denis Leary- helmed Rescue Me, about the lives of a crew of firemen from the New York City Fire Department post-9/11. Both shows were lauded by critics, and achieved equal success with viewers. Rescue Me was one of the few television series to be given an order for an additional season prior to the broadcast of its most recent season: in June 2009 FX renewed the show for an 18-episode sixth season, although the fifth season had not premiered at the time. Unlike many broadcast networks, FX has chosen to take risks with its programming and push the envelope of what can be shown on television; as a result, most (though not all) of the channel's original programming are assigned TV-MA ratings, often for strong profanity, sexual and/or violent content. Family organizations such as the Parents Television Council and American Family Association, have asked advertisers to boycott these shows due to their graphic content. Despite this, FX's original programming output, outside of a few shows, has been critically acclaimed for their strong storylines and characters. Capitalizing on the success of the hit documentary Super Size Me, filmmaker Morgan Spurlock launched a new series, 30 Days, which debuted on FX in June 2005. The series place its subjects in situations uncomfortable to them for 30 days, such as making millionaires work for minimum wage, and having Christians live in a Muslim community. In the summer of 2005, FX debuted two new comedy series, Starved, about the daily lives of four friends with eating disorders who live in New York City; and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, about the usually very politically incorrect comic misadventures of four people who own a bar in the titular city. Both of these shows feature frank sexual dialogue and strong language, and were pitched as \\"The Dark Side of Comedy.\\" Starved was derided by groups that sought to publicize eating disorders and was cancelled after its first season due to low ratings. Conversely, Sunny quickly became a critical darling, consistently achieved high viewership, and was picked up for a second season within days of its first-season finale. Fox aired an edited version of Sunny for a three-episode run in the summer of 2006, in an effort to further promote the series. In 2006, FX debuted two new series, the reality series Black. White. and the drama Thief; neither series was picked up for a second season. During 2007, FX introduced three new dramas: Dirt, starring Courteney Cox; The Riches, starring Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver; and Damages, starring Glenn Close, Ted Danson and Rose Byrne. All three performed well in the ratings and were renewed for second seasons. By 2008, FX was available in 90.6 million homes in the U.S. 2008‚Äì18: Subsequent times FX logo used from 2008 to 2013. In 2008, the channel launched a new branding campaign built around the theme \\"There Is No Box.\\" It alluded to the phrase \\"thinking outside the box\\" and referred to how the channel's programming goes beyond \\"the box\\" concept. In addition, this was a pun related to the channel's creating original shows to compete against premium channels such as HBO. The channel's logo was updated on December 18, 2007, retaining only the FX wordmark while removing the klieg light logo box that had been placed to its left since the 1997 rebrand. The new branding included an advertising campaign featuring a post-game ad for the channel during Fox's coverage of Super Bowl XLII. The promo used the James Morrison song \\"You Give Me Something\\". During 2008, competition with other pay-TV channels increased. This was evident in the second season ratings for series Dirt and The Riches, whose ratings decreased significantly from their freshman seasons. During some weeks, viewership for both shows barely exceeded 1 million. Both shows were cancelled in 2008; acquired shows Dharma and Greg, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Married... with Children and Fear Factor were also removed from the schedule. On September 3, 2008, FX debuted Sons of Anarchy, a drama series created by Kurt Sutter (who previously served as executive producer of The Shield) about a fictional outlaw motorcycle club devoted to protecting their sheltered California town from corporate developers and drug dealers; its September premiere coincided with that of The Shields final season. Sons of Anarchy became a critical and commercial success, having aired for seven seasons . In 2010, the series attracted an average of 4.9 million viewers per week, making it FXs highest rated series to date. Other new shows that premiered in 2010 included the Kenny Hotz comedy Testees, which debuted in October 2008 and was cancelled after its first season. In August 2008, FX relaunched its website, adding streaming of full episodes of its original shows. In 2009, reruns of the former American Broadcasting Company sitcom Spin City were removed from the schedule (though it was restored early the following year). In July 2009, FX ordered three new comedy pilots: Archer, an animated series featuring a spy agency, which premiered on January 14, 2010;Animated Archer Coming to FX, IGN.com, July 14, 2009 The League, with a group of friends who are part of a fantasy football league; and Louie, a sitcom starring stand-up comedian and writer Louis C.K., which \\"blend[s] stand-up material with [...] 'extended vignettes' depicting moments from [the comedian's] offstage experiences.\\" The following year, FX debuted Wilfred, a comedy series starring Elijah Wood. It is based on the Australian series Wilfred. In March 2010, the channel debuted Justified, a drama series created by Graham Yost based on Elmore Leonard's short story \\"Fire in the Hole\\" (which was the series' original working title). It starred Timothy Olyphant as U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens ‚Äì a tough, soft- spoken lawman with a rough side ‚Äì and chronicles his cases and personal life, including unfinished business with an ex-wife and his aging father. FX also picked up the crime comedy-drama Terriers, created by Ted Griffin, for its fall 2010 lineup; in 2011, the channel debuted the boxing drama Lights Out, about retired boxing champion Patrick \\"Lights\\" Leary who is considering a comeback, despite the serious risks it entails. Despite the critical acclaim that Terriers and Lights Out received, the two series were cancelled after their first seasons due to low viewership; For Terriers specifically, FX Networks president and General Manager John Landgraf would later admit in a 2016 interview with critic Alan Sepinwall that \\"I cannot think of a more painful moment of my career than the one when I defined Terriers as a failure by canceling it.\\" On October 1, 2010, parent company News Corporation (which spun off FX and the company's other U.S.-based entertainment properties to 21st Century Fox in July 2013) pulled its channels from Dish Network due to a carriage dispute over retransmission consent revenue. FX returned to the satellite provider's channel lineup on October 29, 2010, after Dish Network and News Corporation signed a long-term carriage agreement. On November 1, 2010, following a similar dispute, FX and its sister channels were restored by New York City-based cable provider Cablevision through a separate carriage agreement. On October 14, 2011, FX announced it picked up the rights to develop a series based on Scar Tissue and Lords of the Sunset Strip, the autobiographies of the Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis and his father, Blackie Dammett. HBO had picked up the series, which was to be titled Spider & Son, a few years before but never completed the project. Entourage writer/producers Marc Abrams and Mike Benson were tapped as its showrunners and Kiedis was to be involved as a co-producer. Dammett said in 2013 that the show has been \\"mothballed,\\" and he hopes interest will resume on the project once the Red Hot Chili Peppers wrapped up their world tour that year. As of 2014 there has been no mention from FX, Kiedis or Dammett on the status of the series. On January 30, 2013, FX premiered the 1980s-set Cold War drama The Americans. On March 28, 2013, FX president John Landgraf announced their upcoming launch of a new channel, FXX. Landgraf described the channel as \\"slightly more comedy focused\\" and aimed at younger audiences 18-34 compared with FX's programming and viewers aged 25‚Äì54, respectively. The channel was launched alongside the new tagline, \\"Fearless\\", that was implemented during 2013 across the channels of FX Networks. These announcements were part of FX Networks' plans to further distinguish itself from the \\"sameness\\" of free-to- air television and its \\"endless imitators\\" on subscription TV.  2019‚Äìpresent: Disney subsidiary  On March 20, 2019, The Walt Disney Company acquired 21st Century Fox. Consequently, FX Networks was integrated into the newly renamed Walt Disney Television unit. In a September 2018 interview with Variety of the Disney-Fox deal, Landgraf said, \\"I think this is a necessary step. I have curiosity and a bit of anxiety about how it will work, but I'm really excited about it. On April 8, 2019, FX Networks had acquired off- network rights to Family Guy, starting with its sixteenth season and Bob's Burgers, starting with its ninth season. Family Guy began airing on FXX on April 16, 2019, while Bob's Burgers made its debut on September 24, 2019. FXX shares the rights to Family Guy with new sister network Freeform. WarnerMedia's Adult Swim and TBS currently hold the rights to older seasons of both shows; WarnerMedia's rights to Family Guy will expire by fall 2021, at which point reruns will be exclusive to FX Networks and Freeform, with the rights to Bob's Burgers similarly coming under FX Networks' full control at a later date. On May 14, 2019, Comcast relinquished its control in Hulu to Disney effective immediately. As a result, the streaming service became a division of Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International with Comcast effectively becoming a silent partner. In November 2019, it was announced that FX will produce series for Hulu under the brand name 'FX on Hulu'. Four series previously in development for the linear FX channel will now premiere on Hulu, including Devs, Mrs. America, A Teacher and The Old Man. Furthermore, episodes aired on the lineair FX channel will be available on 'FX on Hulu' the next day. 'FX on Hulu' launched on March 2, 2020. On June 11, 2019, Hulu and FX picked up show rights to Lionsgate films released in 2020 and 2021. Programming FX's most popular original shows include Justified, Damages, Nip/Tuck, Rescue Me, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, The League, Sons of Anarchy, The Shield, The Strain, Archer, American Horror Story, Anger Management, The Americans, Better Things, Louie, You're the Worst, Fargo, American Crime Story, Legion, and Atlanta. The channel also broadcasts theatrically released feature films from network sister company 20th Century Fox and other film studios (such as Sony Pictures Entertainment, Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Lionsgate Films, Relativity Media, Village Roadshow Pictures and Warner Bros.), which take up much of FX's primetime and the majority of its weekend schedules. It airs repeats of network television sitcoms (such as Two and a Half Men and How I Met Your Mother). From the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the acquired shows which FX broadcast consisted largely of series originally broadcast on Fox between the late 1980s and the 2000s (such as That '70s Show, Married... with Children, and In Living Color). Sports programming After obtaining the spring broadcast rights to NASCAR, Fox Sports announced that FX would serve as its pay-TV partner for the 2001 inaugural season of race telecasts. As a result, FX covered several races in the series then known as the Busch Series and Winston Cup (including the All-Star Race), as well as select qualifying and final practice sessions. Having FX carry the race telecasts was intended to promote the channel and encourage NASCAR fans to contact their subscription providers to add FX to their lineup. In 2002, Peter Liguori, who was then president of FX, praised NASCAR for its growth; the channel increased penetration from 58.5 million to 76.6 million households nationwide.FX Credits NASCAR for Growth , NASCAR.com, April 11, 2002. FX lost the broadcast rights to NASCAR after the 2006 season, as sister channel Speed Channel became the new pay-TV partner for NASCAR on Fox. In 1997, FX obtained partial pay-TV rights to Major League Baseball games; the channel initially aired game telecasts on Monday nights, before moving them to Saturday nights in 1998. In 2000, FX began sharing the Major League Baseball pay-TV rights with then-sister network Fox Family Channel (taking rights to the league's Thursday evening games from Fox Sports Net), with games being scheduled on an alternating basis with FX. Starting with the 2001 season, FX also obtained rights to games from the MLB Division Series, the only playoff round to which Fox did not hold television rights. Among the games televised on FX was Cal Ripken, Jr.'s final home game with the Baltimore Orioles in September 2001. On April 27, 2011, FX began airing soccer games from the UEFA Champions League as part of the league's overall television deal with Fox Sports. In the fall of 2011, FX began broadcasting Big 12, Conference USA and Pac-12 college football games on Saturdays (mainly primetime games, with some daytime games mixed in), as part of Fox Sports' broadcasting contracts with the three conferences. In January 2012, FX began broadcasting content from the Ultimate Fighting Championship. With the August 2013 launches of national sports networks Fox Sports 1 and Fox Sports 2, FX no longer serves as a regular pay-TV outlet for Fox Sports. However, UFC 185 preliminary fights aired on FX due to FS1 showing college basketball. Also on March 5, 2016 FX aired a Bundesliga match between that league's top two teams Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund to provide wider distribution of the fixture, as Fox, FS1, and FS2 all had sporting commitments of their own at the time of the match and the match was to air on the little-distributed Fox Soccer Plus (which does not have carriage on numerous TV providers). Because this was Fox's first year of coverage of Germany's top soccer league and Bayern and Borussia are the two most successful Bundesliga teams (and have an intense rivalry known as Der Klassiker), Fox wanted to give the game wider distribution, and so the game was moved to FX in a last-minute decision. In June 2016, FX continued its broadcast of sports with the airing of three games from the Copa Am√©rica Centenario in order to gain a wider viewing audience for the selected teams. With Disney's purchase of 21st Century Fox and its entertainment networks, FX will likely carry only entertainment programming in the future with it being under the same corporate umbrella as ESPN and its multiple networks and streaming venues. FX Networks right FX Networks, LLC, also referred to as FX Networks and FX Productions, is a company consisting of a network of cable channels plus a production company and a subsidiary of Walt Disney Television, one half of the Disney Media Networks segment of The Walt Disney Company. Fox Broadcasting started up its fX unit by November 1993 under president Anne Sweeney Chuck Saftler was hired in November 1993. Coming from KTLA TV station, Mark Sonnenberg was recruit as first head of programming. On June 1, 1994, the fX cable channel premiered. Early the next month, Fox Broadcasting chair Lucie Salhany and fX was then transferred in a reorganization soon there after under Fox Television chair and CEO Chase Carey. In mid-July 1994, a movie sister channel was announced under the working name of The Fox Movie Studio, also under Sweeney under the title of president of fX and Fox Movie Studio, to start airing in the fall. FX Networks launched the Fox Movie Studio on October 31, 1994 as fXM: Movies from Fox. fXM: Movies from Fox on March 1, 2000 was renamed Fox Movie Channel. Sweeney left for Disney in February 1996. She was replaced by Sonnenberg, who lasted until 1998. Peter Liguori was appointed to replace him. The FX289 channel for UK and Ireland launched in January 2004 then rebranded as FX as it moved in the Sky EPG in April 2005. The channel was rebranded as Fox on 11 January 2013. John Landgraf joined as president of entertainment in 2004 then promoted in 2005 to president and general manager of FX Networks. In that span, FX's original series increased to 11 from two, which was a factor in starting an in-house production company. In August 2007, FX Productions was formed to take stakes in FX programming. FX acquired a number of non-Fox films for the channels. Landgraf was elevated to CEO of FX Networks and FX Productions in June 2013 while taking charge of FXNow digital video-on-demand platform. FXX launched on September 2, 2013 replacing Fox Soccer. Also that month, Fox Movie Channel changed its name back to FXM. Expanding from the FX-BBC co-production of Taboo, in October 2018 FX agreed to give the BBC UK rights to all future and select current FX original scripted shows. On December 14, 2017 The Walt Disney Company announced that it would acquire 21st Century Fox, including FX Networks, LLC. The acquisition was completed on March 20, 2019, thus making FX Networks a subsidiary of Walt Disney Television. FX in 2017 with Comcast launched FX Plus streaming service. FX Plus was shut down on August 20, 2019 as Disney planned to have FX channels supply Hulu with four shows shifting premieres to Hulu from FX. FX programming was moved to Hulu as \\"FX on Hulu\\" on March 2, 2020 with a limited number of shows. FX Movie Channel right FX Movie Channel (or FXM) launched on October 31, 1994 as FXM: Movies from Fox (prior to its launch, the channel was originally named \\"Fox Movie Studio\\") Originally launched as a spinoff of FX, the channel focused on feature films from the 20th Century Fox film library from the 1930s to the 1970s along with a few other film studios. FXM became a separately branded channel on March 1, 2000, when it was renamed Fox Movie Channel. On January 1, 2012, Fox Movie Channel's programming was divided into two 12-hour blocks: its main programming schedule, from 3:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, was a commercial-free block retaining the older movies from the 20th Century Fox library. Another block, called FX Movie Channel, the other 12 hours consisted of an expanded slate of more recent feature films from Fox and some of the other film studios. On March 27, 2013, Fox Entertainment Group announced that Fox Movie Channel would be fully rebranded under the FXM name and format. FX Movie Channel became the primary brand for the channel in September 2013; the classic film block retained the Fox Movie Channel name until June 9, 2014, when the block (which retains a commercial-free format) was renamed FXM Retro. FXX right Aimed at young men in the 18-34 age range, FXX is a pay television channel that launched on September 2, 2013, replacing the sports-oriented Fox Soccer; FXX is a general entertainment channel that primarily focuses on comedies (whereas FX focuses primarily on drama series and films, although FX and FXX do not maintain the same genre- exclusive format as TBS and TNT as FX continues to carry sitcoms and comedic films, while FXX carries a limited selection of dramatic series and films); its programming includes original and acquired comedy series, some feature films and drama series. With the launch of the channel, first-run episodes of some of FX's original comedy series (such as It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell) were shifted over to FXX. At its launch, most providers that have agreements to carry FXX have placed the channel in extra-cost sports packages (despite being a general entertainment service) as an artifact of carriage deals with the previous holder of FXX's channel space, Fox Soccer; this has been resolved over time, with FX and FXX being located next to each other on some channel lineups. FXNOW FXNOW is a website for desktop computers, as well as an application for smartphones and tablet computers, along with Windows 10. It allows subscribers of participating pay television providers (such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast Xfinity) numerous viewing options: *individual episodes of FX and FXX's original series (which are made available the morning after their original airdate), *acquired series (most notably, the 552-episode catalog of the first 25 seasons of The Simpsons, which was added on August 21, 2014 as part of FXX's acquisition of subscription syndication rights to the series, but has since been moved over to the Disney+ streaming service), and feature films (with an initial library of 165 film titles, which increased to more than 200 titles beginning in 2015), *Additional content includes behind-the-scenes features on computers and mobile devices via their TV Everywhere login provided by their subscription provider. *The ability to watch Fox programming along was introduced in 2018, along with FX/FXX programming being added to the FOXNOW app, this feature was removed in March 2019, due to Disney acquiring FX Networks. Launched in January 2014, the service is also available through iOS, Android, Samsung and Windows 8 (later Windows 10) devices, Xbox One and Xbox 360, and the Roku streaming player. Although the service is available for free to subscribers of participating subscription TV providers, shows available for streaming on FXNOW feature commercial interruption. =FX+= In September 2018, Fox officially launched FX+, a streaming service featuring all FX and FXX original series from The Shield to the present day ad-free. Initially, the service was made available in the United States exclusively for Xfinity subscribers in the fall of 2017. Xfinity, Armstrong and Cox subscribers have access to FX+ direct through their set-top boxes via those providers' video on demand platforms, in addition to the streaming options. In July 2019, it was announced on the service's website that it would cease being available on August 21, 2019, as a result of The Walt Disney Company's near-full acquisition of Hulu and move of FX content to that service; its ad-free model would otherwise be effectively duplicative with Hulu's commercial-free plan. FX on Hulu right FX on Hulu is a channel/hub on Hulu launched on March 2, 2020. It includes original series, the vast majority of FX's post-2000 series catalog and next-day streaming of current FX and FXX series. In November 2019, four shows were moved from FX to Hulu, Devs, Mrs. America, A Teacher and The Old Man. In the first phase from March 2 to 7, the hub rolled out with 40 current and library shows with four FX shows premiering on FX during this period, then being made available on Hulu the next day. Phase two began on April 15 with Mrs. America premiering along with two other FX shows and a documentary series. FX Entertainment FX Entertainment is the division of FX Networks that oversees original programming under the FX brand, including FX Productions. It was formed in May 2019 as part of FX Networks' executive restructuring following acquisition by Disney. On June 10, 2019, Disney announced that both FX Entertainment and Disney Television Studios would share the same casting division. =FX Productions= right FX Productions (FXP) is FX Networks' in-house production company. FX Productions was formed in August 2007 to take stakes in FX programming. Eric Schrier add senior vice president of FX Productions to the post of senior vice president of original programming in charge of current series and alternative programming. In July 2014, Fox Networks Group and DNA Films formed DNA TV Limited joint venture. Fox Networks Group would have first global first rights with co-financing options to the joint venture's shows. DNA TV would be managed by DNA Films management with Eric Schrier, president of Original Programming for FX Networks and FX Productions handling Fox's joint venture interest. Paul Simms signed an overall television production deal with FXP in October 2017.https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/fx-atlanta-paul-simms-overall- deal-1202493508/ In November 2019, it was announced that a number of new series originally ordered for FX produced by FX Productions before the Disney merger would be carried over to Hulu as part of the move of FX's streaming presence for most of the network's library not already under contract with another streaming provider. The series will remain under the purview of FX Productions, and be marketed under a new Hulu sub-brand, \\"FX on Hulu\\". It is planned by the end of 2021 that a third of Hulu's original series input will be produced by FX Productions. International Since 2004, FX has overseen operations of FX-branded television networks around the world. As the network was launched in new markets, the FX brand has been used in several countries. FX has established channels in various countries worldwide including Latin America, Canada, Australia, India, Europe, and Southeast Asia.

The SD channel, as was standard with all of Fox's broadcast and pay-TV networks (and also its new Disney siblings, which also all operate in 720p), is now merely downscaled from the HD feed at the provider headend level rather than having a devoted SD feed.  Controversy  In June 2017, the 101-year-old actress Olivia de Havilland filed a lawsuit against FX Networks and producer Ryan Murphy for inaccurately portraying her and using her likeness without permission. On March 26, 2018, a California appeals court threw out the lawsuit on First Amendment grounds.

He served for sixteen years before being impeached and removed from office in December 2010. Education and career Porteous was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Louisiana State University in 1968 and a Juris Doctor from Louisiana State University Law School in 1971. He was a special counsel to the Office of the State Attorney General, Louisiana from 1971 to 1973. He served as Chief of the Felony Complaint Division in the District Attorney's Office, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, from 1973 to 1975. He was in private practice in Gretna from 1973 to 1980, and in Metairie from 1980 to 1984. He was a city attorney of Harahan from 1982 to 1984. He was elected as a judge on the 24th Judicial District Court of Louisiana in 1984 and served until 1994. Federal judicial service On August 25, 1994, Porteous was nominated by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana vacated by Robert Frederick Collins. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 7, 1994, and received his commission on October 11, 1994. Notable rulings Porteous ruled in several landmark cases against the state, including one 2002 case in which he ruled that the state of Louisiana was illegally using federal money to promote religion in its abstinence-only sex education programs. He ordered the state to stop giving money to individuals or organizations that \\"convey religious messages or otherwise advance religion\\" with tax dollars. Judge Porteous also said there was ample evidence that many of the groups participating in the Governor's Program on Abstinence were \\"furthering religious objectives.\\" Those who supported such groups objected to his ruling. Also in 2002, Porteous overturned a federal ban on rave paraphernalia such as glowsticks, pacifiers, and dust masks, originally banned due to the subculture's ties to recreational drugs such as Ecstasy, after the American Civil Liberties Union successfully claimed the ban to be unconstitutional. He had previously ruled in 1999 against a Louisiana law aimed at banning the second trimester abortion procedure known as intact dilation and extraction. Bankruptcy In 2001, Porteous filed for bankruptcy, which led to revelations in the press about his private life, specifically the fact that he was alleged to have had close ties with local bail bond magnate Louis Marcotte III, at the center of a corruption probe. Porteous himself was the subject of investigation by federal investigators. In May 2006, Porteous, beset by the recent loss of his home due to Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, and the death of his wife a few months later, and still under investigation by a federal grand jury, was granted temporary medical leave and began a year-long furlough from the federal bench. Impeachment proceedings On June 18, 2008, the Judicial Conference of the United States transmitted a certificate to the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives expressing the Conference's determination that consideration of impeachment of Porteous might be warranted. The certificate stated that there was substantial evidence that Porteous \\"repeatedly committed perjury by signing false financial disclosure forms under oath\\", thus concealing \\"cash and things of value that he solicited and received from lawyers appearing in litigation before him.\\" In a specific case, > he denied a motion to recuse based on his relationship with lawyers in the > case . . . and failed to disclose that the lawyers in question had often > provided him with cash. Thereafter, while a bench verdict (that is, a > verdict by a judge sitting without a jury) was pending, he solicited and > received from the lawyers appearing before him illegal gratuities in the > form of cash and other things of value thus depriving \\"the public of its right to his honest services\\". The certificate concluded that this conduct \\"constituted an abuse of his judicial office\\" in violation of the Canons of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. The certificate also stated that there was substantial evidence that Porteous had \\"repeatedly committed perjury by signing false financial disclosure forms under oath\\" in connection with his bankruptcy, allowing \\"him to obtain a discharge of his debts while continuing his lifestyle at the expense of his creditors\\". Further, he had \\"made false representations to gain the extension of a bank loan with the intent to defraud the bank\\". Investigation On September 18, 2008, the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to proceed with an investigation of the bribery and perjury allegations. (Archived by WebCite at ) On October 15, 2008 House Judiciary Chair John Conyers announced that Alan I. Barron had been hired as Special Counsel to lead an inquiry into Porteous' impeachment. Representatives Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) were designated as Chair and Ranking Member, respectively, to lead the task force conducting the inquiry. Three months later, the House passed via voice vote a Conyers-sponsored resolution authorizing and directing the Committee on the Judiciary to inquire whether the House should impeach Porteous. The resolution was needed because the previous year's investigation had ended with the previous Congress. In October 2009, Reps. Conyers and Lamar S. Smith introduced a resolution asking to access the judge's tax returns as part of the investigation. The resolution was referred to the Rules Committee and, at the same time, a timeframe was established which called for the investigation to end in November 2009; the Judicial Impeachment Task Force would decide by the end of the year if impeachment would be recommended to the Judiciary Committee. If the recommendation was for impeachment, the Committee would take up the matter in early 2010. The task force scheduled the first hearings on the case for November 17 and 18, with more meetings in December before a final recommendation was made. Impeachment On November 13 Porteous sued the task force, claiming that the panel was violating his Fifth Amendment rights by using testimony given under immunity in making the case against him. (Archived by WebCite at ) On January 21, 2010, the panel voted unanimously to recommend four articles of impeachment to the full Judiciary Committee, which, on January 27, voted to send the articles of impeachment to the full House. On March 4, 2010, the full Committee reported , a resolution of impeachment of Porteous, to the full House. The full House considered the resolution, which included four articles of impeachment, on March 11, 2010. The subjects of the articles of impeachment, and the corresponding vote of the House of Representatives, appear below: :Article I ‚Äì engaging in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him as a Federal judge ‚Äì Passed the House by a vote of 412‚Äì0. :Article II ‚Äì engaged in a longstanding pattern of corrupt conduct that demonstrates his unfitness to serve as a United States District Court Judge ‚Äì Passed the House by a vote of 410‚Äì0. :Article III ‚Äì knowingly and intentionally making false statements, under penalty of perjury, related to his personal bankruptcy filing and violating a bankruptcy court order ‚Äì Passed the House by a vote of 416‚Äì0. :Article IV ‚Äì knowingly made material false statements about his past to both the United States Senate and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order to obtain the office of United States District Court Judge ‚Äì Passed the House by a vote of 423‚Äì0. The same day, Representatives Adam Schiff (D-CA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Hank Johnson (D-GA), Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), and Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) were appointed as managers to conduct the trial in the Senate. In addition, Schiff and Goodlatte were designated as the lead managers. (Archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5pE0afpen) The articles of impeachment were sent to the Senate, where the proceedings were started on March 17. On that same day, Senators passed two resolutions: one provided for a summons for Porteous to answer the articles against him, and the other provided for a committee to analyze the evidence against him and report their findings to the full Senate. Senators Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT) were designated as Chair and Vice Chair of the committee, respectively. The committee met on April 16; The trial was due to begin in early August, with a vote before the Senate happening in late September, but due to delays, it did not begin until mid-September, with a vote scheduled for December 8, 2010. Trial On December 7, 2010, the full Senate began hearing the impeachment trial. During the Senate trial for impeachment, Jonathan Turley, acting in Judge Porteous's defense, announced that Judge Porteous had decided to leave the federal bench in 2011 were he not removed from office. The following day, the Senate voted unanimously to convict Porteous on the first of four impeachment charges, removing him from the bench, before subsequently convicting him on the remaining three articles. In addition, Porteous was forever disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States. :Article I ‚Äì engaging in a pattern of conduct that is incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him as a Federal judge ‚Äì Convicted in the Senate by a vote of 96‚Äì0.https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session;=2&vote;=00261 :Article II ‚Äì engaged in a longstanding pattern of corrupt conduct that demonstrates his unfitness to serve as a United States District Court Judge ‚Äì Convicted in the Senate by a vote of 69‚Äì27.https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session;=2&vote;=00262 :Article III ‚Äì knowingly and intentionally making false statements, under penalty of perjury, related to his personal bankruptcy filing and violating a bankruptcy court order ‚Äì Convicted in the Senate by a vote of 88‚Äì8.https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session;=2&vote;=00263 :Article IV ‚Äì knowingly made material false statements about his past to both the United States Senate and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in order to obtain the office of United States District Court Judge ‚Äì Convicted in the Senate by a vote of 90‚Äì6.https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session;=2&vote;=00264 :Disqualification ‚Äì Forever disqualified to hold any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States ‚Äì Disqualified by the Senate by a vote of 94‚Äì2.https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session;=2&vote;=00265 On January 13, 2011, the Louisiana Supreme Court officially acknowledged the loss of Porteous's state attorney license.

The title was borne by the Dukes of Newcastle-under-Lyne from 1768 to 1988, until the dukedom became extinct. Earls of Lincoln, first creation (1141) *William d'Aubigny, 1st Earl of Lincoln and 1st Earl of Arundel (c. 1109‚Äì1176) The Earldom was created for the first time probably around 1141 as William d'Aubigny, 1st Earl of Arundel, is mentioned as Earl of Lincoln in 1143 in two charters for the Abbey of Affligem, representing his wife Adeliza of Louvain, former wife of King Henry I. Earls of Lincoln, second creation (after 1143) *William de Roumare, Earl of Lincoln (1096‚Äì1155) (reverted to Crown) The Earldom was created for a second time by King Stephen sometime after 1143 for William de Roumare. However, in 1149 or 1150, as William had gone over to the side of Empress Matilda, the King Stephen took the earldom from him and elevated Gilbert de Gant as Earl of Lincoln. Earls of Lincoln, third creation (about 1149) *Gilbert de Gant, Earl of Lincoln (1120‚Äì1156) (reverted to crown) The Earldom was created for a third time by King Stephen in 1149 or 1150 for Gilbert de Gant, but on his death in 1156 it reverted to the Crown. Earls of Lincoln, fourth creation (1217) The Earldom was created for a fourth time in 1217 for Ranulph de Blondeville. He had no issue. In April 1231, with the consent of the King, before his death he passed the Earldom to his sister Hawise of Chester, and she was formally invested by King Henry III in October 1232. Royal consent was needed for this, because the Earldom would otherwise have reverted to the crown in the absence of a legitimate male heir. She in turn passed the Earldom, again with the consent of the King, to her daughter Margaret de Quincy suo jure, and her son-in-law John de Lacy, Baron of Pontefract. They were formally invested by Henry III in November 1232. Their grandson, the third Earl, married Margaret Longesp√©e. Their daughter Alice inherited the earldom. She was the wife of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. They had no children and the earldom reverted to the Crown on Alice's death in 1348. * 1217‚Äì1231 Ranulf de Blondeville, 1st Earl of Lincoln (1172‚Äì1232) * 1231‚Äì1232 Hawise of Chester, 1st Countess of Lincoln suo jure (1180‚Äìc. 1242) (received as inter vivos gift Apr 1231) * 1232‚Äì1240 John de Lacy, 2nd Earl of Lincoln (1192‚Äì1240) (held jointly by the right of his wife; see below) * 1232‚Äì1266 Margaret de Quincy, 2nd Countess of Lincoln suo jure (c. 1206‚Äì1266) (received as inter vivos gift 23 Nov 1232) * 1272‚Äì1311 Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln (1251‚Äì1311) (Earldom administered in wardship by his mother Alice of Saluzzo from 1266‚Äì1272) * 1311‚Äì1348 Alice de Lacy, 4th Countess of Lincoln suo jure (1281‚Äì1348) (reverted to the Crown as she died without issue) The above list does not contain the men who became Earl of Lincoln by right of their wives who were Countess of Lincoln suo jure, except for John de Lacy, 2nd Earl of Lincoln. He is included in the above list because he was created Earl of Lincoln by Royal Charter (together with his wife Margaret de Quincy, Countess of Lincoln). The other men who became Earl of Lincoln by right of their wives were: * Walter Marshal, 5th Earl of Pembroke, married Margaret de Quincy in January 1242, died November 1245 * Thomas of Lancaster, husband of Alice de Lacy, became Earl of Lincoln on the death of his father-in-law in February 1311, died March 1322 * Sir Eubulus le Strange, married Alice de Lacy before November 1324, died September 1335 * Hugh de Freyne, married Alice de Lacy before March 1336, died c. January 1337 As Earl of Lincoln, these husbands had immense power with the right to control the estates of their wives. The above list also does not include Margaret Longesp√©e, who was Countess of Salisbury in her own right, but Countess of Lincoln only by right of her husband Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln. Earls of Lincoln, fifth creation (1349) Henry Grosmont, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Lincoln, the royal arms of King Henry III a label France of three points. These were inherited from his grandfather, Edmund Crouchback, second son of Henry III. The Earldom was created for a fifth time in the following year, 1349, when it was revived for Alice's nephew-in-law Henry of Grosmont, who was later created Duke of Lancaster. It became extinct on his death in 1361. Earls of Lincoln, sixth creation (1467) *John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln (1462‚Äì1487) Arms of John de La Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln (sixth creation). The label argent (white) distinguishes his arms from those of his father, the Duke of Suffolk. The Earldom was created for a sixth time in 1467 for John de la Pole. He was the eldest son of John de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk, and Elizabeth of York. He predeceased his father and the title became extinct on his death in 1487. Earls of Lincoln, seventh creation (1525) *Henry Brandon, 1st Earl of Lincoln (1523‚Äì1534) The Earldom was created for the seventh time in 1525 for Henry Brandon. He was the second son of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, by his wife Mary Tudor. He died at the age of eleven in 1534 when the title became extinct. Earls of Lincoln, eighth creation (1572) This creation of the Earldom was made for the eighth time in 1572 for the naval commander Edward Clinton, 9th Baron Clinton (see the Baron Clinton for earlier history of the family). He served as Lord High Admiral under Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He represented Launceston and Lancashire in the House of Commons. His son, the third Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby and Lincolnshire. In 1610 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Clinton. His great- grandson, the fifth Earl, died without surviving issue in 1692 when the earldom and barony separated. The barony fell into abeyance between his aunts (see the Baron Clinton for further history of this title). He was succeeded in the earldom by his second cousin once removed, the sixth Earl. He was the grandson of Sir Edward Clinton, second son of the second Earl. His son, the seventh Earl, served as Paymaster of the Forces, as Constable of the Tower and as Cofferer of the Household. Lord Lincoln married Lucy Sydney (died 1736), daughter of Robert Sydney, 2nd Earl of Leicester (see the Earl of Chichester for earlier history of the Pelham family). His eldest son, the eighth Earl, died as a child and was succeeded by his younger brother, the ninth Earl. He was Cofferer of the Household and Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire and Cambridgeshire. He married his first cousin Catherine Pelham (died 1760), daughter and heiress of Henry Pelham. In 1756 his uncle the Duke of Newcastle upon Tyne was created Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne, with remainder to his nephew Lord Lincoln, and on the Duke's death in 1768 Lincoln succeeded as second Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne according to the special remainder. He assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Pelham the same year. The Duke's two elder sons, George Pelham-Clinton, Lord Clinton, and Henry Pelham- Clinton, Earl of Lincoln, both predeceased him. He was therefore succeeded by his third son, the third Duke. He was a Major-General in the Army. On his early death the titles passed to his son, the fourth Duke. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire from 1809 to 1839. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Duke. He was a prominent politician and held office as Chief Secretary for Ireland, as Secretary of State for the Colonies and as Secretary of State for War. His eldest son, the sixth Duke, briefly represented Newark in the House of Commons. The Duke married Henrietta Adele, the wealthy heiress and daughter of Henry Thomas Hope. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the seventh Duke, who died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother. In 1881 the eighth Duke assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Hope on inheriting the substantial Hope estates through his paternal grandmother. On his death the titles passed to his only son, the ninth Duke. He had two daughters but no sons and was succeeded by his third cousin, the tenth Duke. He was the great-grandson of Lord Charles Pelham-Clinton, second son of the fourth Duke. He died unmarried in December 1988, having held the titles for only a month. On his death the dukedom became extinct while he was succeeded in the earldom by his distant relative, the eighteenth Earl, a descendant in the tenth-generation of the Hon. Sir Henry Fynes-Clinton, third son of the second Earl. Lord Lincoln lived all his life in Australia, and reportedly learned of his succession from a British newspaper. He wrote a book: Memoirs of an Embryo Earl. the title is held by his grandson, the nineteenth Earl, whose father had died in 1999. He is a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, and still lives in Australia. Several other members of the Clinton family have also gained distinction. Edward Clinton, Lord Clinton, son of the fourth Earl, was Member of Parliament for Callington. The Honourable George Clinton, youngest son of the sixth Earl, was a Naval Commander, politician and Colonial administrator. His son General Sir Henry Clinton was Commander-in- Chief of the British in North America from 1778 to 1782. His sons General Sir William Henry Clinton and Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton were also successful military commanders. Lord Edward Pelham-Clinton GCVO, second son of the fifth Duke, was a soldier and courtier. Clumber Park in 1829 The seat of the Dukes of Newcastle was Clumber House near Worksop, Nottinghamshire. However, the house was demolished in 1938. The surrounding estate was sold to the National Trust in 1946 and is now a country park featuring a noteworthy Walled Kitchen Garden open to the public.

The NVA was organized into four branches: the Landstreitkr√§fte (Ground Forces), the Volksmarine (Navy), the Luftstreitkr√§fte (Air Force), and the Grenztruppen (Border Troops). The NVA belonged to the Ministry of National Defence and commanded by the National Defense Council of East Germany, headquartered in Strausberg east of East Berlin. From 1962, conscription was mandatory for all GDR males aged between 18 and 60 requiring an 18-month service, and it was the only Warsaw Pact military to offer non-combat roles to conscientious objectors, known as \\"construction soldiers\\" (Bausoldat). The NVA reached 175,300 personnel at its peak in 1987. The NVA was formed on 1 March 1956 to succeed the Kasernierte Volkspolizei (Barracked People's Police) and under the influence of the Soviet Army became of the Warsaw Pact militaries opposing NATO during the Cold War. The majority of NATO officers rated the NVA the best military in the Warsaw Pact based on discipline, thoroughness of training, and the quality of officer leadership. The NVA did not see significant combat but participated in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, deployed military advisors to communist governments in other countries, and manned the Berlin Wall where they were responsible for numerous deaths. The NVA was dissolved on 2 October 1990 with the GDR before German reunification, and its facilities and equipment were handed over to the Bundeswehr (the armed forces of West Germany), which also absorbed most of its personnel below the rank of non- commissioned officer. History Soldiers of the Guard Regiment Friedrich Engels marching at a changing-of-the-guard ceremony at the Neue Wache on the Unter den Linden in Berlin A GDR colors cap, here for a flag of a Ministry of the Interior (MdI) unit; the NVA had the same in gold. The German Democratic Republic (GDR) established the National People's Army on 1 March 1956 (six months after the formation of the West German Bundeswehr) from the Kasernierte Volkspolizei. This formation culminated years of preparation during which former Wehrmacht officers and communist veterans of the Spanish Civil War helped organize and train paramilitary units of the People's Police. Though the NVA featured a German appearance ‚Äì including uniforms and ceremonies patterned after older German military traditions ‚Äì its doctrine and structure showed the strong influence of the Soviet Armed Forces. During its first year, about 27 percent of the NVA's officer corps had formerly served in the Wehrmacht. Of the 82 highest command positions, ex-Wehrmacht officers held 61; however, very few of them had served in high ranks. The military knowledge and combat experience of these veterans were indispensable in the NVA's early years, although by the 1960s most of these World War II veterans had retired. (The West German Bundeswehr was even more reliant on Wehrmacht veterans, who initially comprised the majority of its commissioned ranks.) In its first six years the NVA operated as an all-volunteer force. (West Germany, in contrast, re-introduced universal military service in 1956.) The GDR introduced conscription in 1962. According to the Parallel History Project on Cooperative Security: Like the ruling communist parties of other Soviet satellites, the East German Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) assured control by appointing loyal party members to top positions and by organizing intensive political education for all ranks. The proportion of SED members in the officer corps rose steadily after the early 1960s, eventually reaching almost 95 percent. The NVA saw itself as the \\"instrument of power of the working class\\" (Machtinstrument der Arbeiterklasse). According to its doctrine, the NVA protected peace and secured the achievements of socialism by maintaining a convincing deterrent to imperialist aggression. The NVA's motto, inscribed on its flag, read: \\"For the Protection of the Workers and Farmers' Power\\". The NVA never took part in full-scale combat, although it participated in a support role in the suppression of the Prague Spring of 1968, and NVA officers often served as combat advisers in Africa.Tsouras, 1994, 250. Some of the first NVA advisors went to the Republic of the Congo in 1973. During the 1980s at various times the NVA had advisors in Algeria, Angola, Ethiopia, Guinea, Iraq, Libya, Mozambique, South Yemen, and Syria.IISS Military Balance 1981-89, via Tsouras, 1994, 250. When the Soviet Union prepared to occupy Czechoslovakia in 1968, the GDR government committed the 7th Panzer Division and the 11th Motorised Infantry Division to support the intervention (assigned to 20th Guards Army and 1st Guards Tank Army respectively), becoming the first deployment of German troops outside Germany for the first time since the Second World War.Tsouras, \\"Changing Orders\\", Facts on File, 1994, 170. But the East German participation raised Czech ire, and the two divisions were \\"kept out of sight in the Bohemian forests\\" (Tsouras, 1994, 170) and allowed to travel only at night. In a few days they were withdrawn. Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp. In the early 1970s the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG) high command assigned to the NVA the wartime mission of capturing West Berlin.David Stone, Fighting for the Fatherland: The Story of the German Soldier from 1648 to the Present Day, Conway, London, 2006, p.385-6, , drawing upon Colonel AD Meek, \\"Operation Centre\\", British Army Review, No. 107, 1994 The NVA plan for the operation, designated \\"Operation Centre\\", called for some 32,000 troops in two divisions, accompanied by the GSFG's Soviet 6th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade. The plan was regularly updated until 1988, when a less ambitious plan that simply aimed at containing Berlin was substituted. In the autumn of 1981 the NVA stood ready to intervene in Poland in support of a possible Soviet invasion, but the declaration of martial law in Poland (13 December 1981) averted the crisis. The NVA went into a state of heightened combat readiness on several occasions, including the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, and, for the last time, in late 1989 as protests swept through the GDR. Ideology The NVA operated as a professional volunteer army until 1962, when conscription was introduced. The GDR's National Defense Council controlled the armed forces, but the mobile forces came under the Warsaw Pact Unified Command. Political control of the armed forces took place through close integration with the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), which vetted all officers. Military training (provided by the school system) and the growing militarization of East German society bolstered popular support for the military establishment. From a Leninist perspective, the NVA stood as a symbol of Soviet-East German solidarity and became the model communist institution ‚Äì ideological, hierarchical, and disciplined.Emily O. Goldman and Leslie C. Eliason, The diffusion of military technology and ideas (2003) p 132 The NVA synthesized communist and Prussian symbolism, naming its officers' academy after Karl Marx's co-author Friedrich Engels, and its highest medal after Prussian Army General Gerhard von Scharnhorst.Alan L. Nothnagle, Building the East German myth (1999) p 176 During the Peaceful Revolution that led to the downfall of the GDR's communist government, some NVA forces were placed on alert but were never deployed against protesters. At the same time, the Soviet government ordered its troops in the GDR to remain in barracks. After the forced retirement of SED and state leader Erich Honecker and other conservatives from the ruling Politburo at the height of the crisis in October 1989, the new SED leadership ruled out using armed force against the protesters.Dale Roy Herspring, Requiem for an army: the Demise of the East German Military (1998) Composition The manpower of the NVA consisted of some 85,000 soldiers in 1962, climbed to 127,000 by 1967, and remained essentially steady through 1970.Hancock, M. Donald. The Bundeswehr and the National People's Army: A Comparative Study of German Civil-Military Polity. University of Denver, 1973. p 25. In 1987, at the peak of its power, the NVA numbered 175,300 troops. Approximately 50% of this number were career soldiers, while the others were short-term conscripts. According to a 1973 study, NVA leaders from the late 1950s through the 1960s came predominantly from working-class backgrounds, with few from middle-class or professional families and no representatives of the aristocracy present in the upper echelons. Excepting specialized military or political instruction, most NVA leaders reported primary school as their highest level of formal education.Hancock, M. Donald. The Bundeswehr and the National People's Army: A Comparative Study of German Civil-Military Polity. University of Denver, 1973. p 12-13 Post-unification An NVA Tatra-813 carrying a GAZ-63 The NVA disbanded with the dissolution of the East German government in October 1990. Its facilities and equipment were handed over to the Bundeswehr. Most facilities closed, and equipment was either sold or given to other countries. Most of the NVA's 36,000 officers and NCOs were let go, including all officers above the rank of lieutenant colonel. The Bundeswehr retained only 3,200 ‚Äì after a demotion of one rank. In addition, all female soldiers (at this point it was still prohibited for women to become soldiers in the Bundeswehr) and all soldiers over the age of 55 were discharged. Until 1 March 2005, Germany listed time served in the NVA as time \\"served in a foreign military\\". Service in the NVA did not count for points towards federal pensions in the unified Germany. Retired NVA soldiers and officers received only minimal pensions after unification: a thirty-year veteran would receive a pension smaller than a graduate-student stipend. After the reform of 2005, service in the NVA became known as \\"served outside of the Bundeswehr\\". Many former NVA officers feel bitter about their treatment after unification. While receiving only minimal pensions, few have been able to find jobs except as laborers or security guards. Former NVA officers are not permitted to append their NVA rank to their name as a professional title; no such prohibition applies to rank attained in the Wehrmacht or in the Waffen-SS during the Nazi era. One of the few former NVA facilities to remain open was a base in Storkow near Berlin, which housed the NVA's camouflage and deception center. This became the Bundeswehr Unit for Camouflage and Deception.\\" East German army unit finds skills still in demand after reunification\\".

It was equipped with a large number of modern weapons systems, most of Soviet origin, from which a small portion were given back to the Soviet Union in 1990. The remaining equipment and materiel was still substantial, including large quantities of replacement parts, medical supplies, atomic, biological and chemical warfare equipment, training devices and simulators, etc. One of the first measures taken after the reunification was a survey and securing of weapons and devices by former members of the NVA. The federally operated Materiel Depot Service Gesellschaft (MDSG) was charged with taking custody of and warehousing this equipment. The MDSG employed 1,820 people who were primarily taken from the Bundeswehr. The MDSG was privatised in 1994. Much of the materiel was given free of charge to beneficiaries in the new federal states or other departments, to museums, or to friendly nations in the context of military suport for developing countries. The German Federal Intelligence Service secretly sold NVA equipment to several countries, violating international and German laws as well as international treaties. The rest was destroyed. * 767 aircraft (helicopters, fixed wing aircraft), 24 of which were MiG-29s * 208 ships * 2,761 tanks * 133,900 wheeled vehicles * 2,199 artillery pieces * 1,376,650 firearms * 303,690 tons of ammunition * 14,335 tons of fuel and cleaning materials 24 modern MIG-29s became part of the Luftwaffe. After 1999, 23 of the 24 aircraft were given to Poland. Recruitment and conscientious objection Before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, military service in the GDR was voluntary, though the Free German Youth and public schools mounted intensive recruitment drives, and service in the NVA was often a prerequisite for career advancement. Compulsory military service had been introduced in 1956 in West Germany, one year after the West German military was established, but the GDR held back from this step until 1962. The situation changed when the border was sealed in August 1961, and five months later the government announced a mandatory service term of 18 months for men. There was, at first, no alternative service for conscientious objectors. This changed in 1964 when, under pressure from the national Protestant church, the GDR's National Defence Council authorised the formation of Baueinheiten (construction units) for men of draft age who \\"refuse military service with weapons on the grounds of religious viewpoints or for similar reasons\\". The construction soldiers wore uniforms and lived in barracks under military discipline, but were not required to bear arms and received no combat training. In theory, they were to be used only for civilian construction projects. The GDR therefore became the only Warsaw Pact country to provide a non-combat alternative for conscientious objectors. However, fearing that other soldiers would be contaminated by pacifist ideas, the government took care to segregate the construction units from regular conscripts. Moreover, conscripts who chose the alternative service option often faced discrimination later in life, including denial of opportunities for higher education. Organization The NVA had four main branches:Forester, Thomas M., The East German Army; Second in the Warsaw Pact, George Allen & Unwin Ltd, London, 1980 * The Landstreitkr√§fte (Ground Forces) with an active strength of 108,000 in the following divisions: **1st Motor Rifle Division (Potsdam-Eiche) **4th Motor Rifle Division (Erfurt) **6th Motor Rifle Division (K√∂nigswartha) **7th Panzer Division (Dresden) **8th Motor Rifle Division (Schwerin) **9th Panzer Division (Eggesin) **10th Motor Rifle Division (Ronneburg) **11th Motor Rifle Division (Halle) **17th Motor Rifle Division (Petersroda) **19th Motor Rifle Division (Wulkow) **20th Motor Rifle Division (Bredenfelde) * The Volksmarine (People's Navy) with a strength of 18,300 * The Luftstreitkr√§fte/Luftverteidigung (Air Forces/Air Defence) with a strength of 58,000 In wartime, mobilization of the NVA's reserves would have nearly doubled its strength. GDR authorities also had at their disposal the internal security troops of the Ministry of the Interior (the Kasernierte Volkspolizei) and the Ministry for State Security (the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment) along with the 210,000 strong party auxiliary \\"Combat Groups of the Working Class\\" (Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse), who were available in times of war. The highest level of leadership for the NVA was the Ministry for National Defense (Ministerium f√ºr Nationale Verteidigung) headquartered in Strausberg near East Berlin. NVA administration was divided into the following commands: * the Kommando Landstreitkr√§fte (KdoLaSK) based in Geltow near Potsdam * the Kommando Luftstreitkr√§fte und Luftverteidigungskr√§fte (KdoLSK/LV) based in Strausberg * the Kommando Volksmarine (KdoVM) based in Rostock * the Kommando der Grenztruppen (KdoGT) based in P√§tz near Berlin Appearance Various uniforms worn by NVA officers Uniforms The first military units of the Central Training Administration (Hauptverwaltung Ausbildung ‚Äì HVA) were dressed in police blue. With the restructuring of the Barracked Police (CIP) in 1952, khaki uniforms similar in shape and colour to those of the Soviet Army were introduced. The desire for a separate \\"German\\" and \\"socialist\\" military tradition, and the consequent founding of the NVA in 1956, introduced new uniforms which strongly resembled those of the Wehrmacht. They were of a similar cut and made of a brownish-gray, called stone gray, cloth. The dark high-necked collar were later removed, except on the coats from 1974‚Äì79. Even the NVA's peculiar \\"gumdrop\\" army helmet, in spite of its easily noticeable resemblance to well-known Soviet designs, was actually based on a prototype \\"B / II\\" helmet that was initially developed for the Wehrmacht by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Fry and his collaborator Dr. Hansel from the Institute for Defence Technical Materials Science in Berlin. The helmet had seen trials since 1943, but was not adopted during World War II.Baer, Ludwig: Die Geschichte des Deutschen Stahlhelmes: von 1915 bis 1945; seine Geschichte in Wort u. Bild . L. Baer (Selbstverlag), Eschborn, 1977. With the exceptions of the People's Navy, whose dark-blue uniforms were consistent with the styles of most navies around the world, and the Combat Groups of the Working Class (Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse), who wore their own olive-green fatigue uniforms, all NVA armed services, the Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment, the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic, and the Kasernierte Volkspolizei wore the same basic uniform. Several later modifications were introduced, but the style and cut remain fundamentally the same. There were a variety of uniforms worn according to the setting (work or social) and season (summer or winter). Most uniforms (service, semi-dress, and parade) were stone grey, a brownish-grey colour that was conspicuously different from the grey- green of the People's Police. Officers' uniforms differed from those of enlisted personnel by better quality and texture cloth. The field and service uniforms were normal attire for most day-to-day functions. Uniform categories Several basic categories of uniforms were worn: GDR borderguards and members of a Combat Groups of the Working Class at the border of the Berlin sector on 14 August 1961 Another GDR stamp celebrating 25 years of the NVA The field uniform as worn by GDR border troops NVA generals wearing parade uniforms in a 1984 promotion and awards ceremony * Parade uniform (Paradeuniform) ‚Äì The parade uniform for officers was the semi-dress/walking- out tunic with all authorized orders, awards and decorations attached, breeches and riding boots, steel helmet, white shirt, dark-gray necktie, and a ceremonial dagger worn on the left side and fastened to a silver-gray parade belt. Officers in guards of honor carried sabers. In winter, a greatcoat, scarf, and gloves were worn. * Service uniform (Dienstuniform) ‚Äì The summer service uniform for officers was a bloused jacket, called a Hemdbluse, worn without a shirt, trousers, and a visored service cap. The winter service uniform featured a tunic with four large buttoned-down patch pockets, a black waist belt, the service cap, breeches, shirt, tie, and pants belt; high boots were reserved for officers and NCOs. A long, heavy, belted greatcoat was also part of the winter uniform. * Semi-dress/walking-out uniform (Ausgangsuniform) ‚Äì With a few details, the semi-dress uniform was the same for all ranks and was worn for walking-out purposes (i.e. off-duty and off-post). It consisted of a single-breasted tunic without belt, a silver-gray shirt with dark-gray tie, the service cap, long trousers, and black low-quarter shoes. Officers also wore the tunic with a white shirt. During periods of warm weather, there was the option of omitting the tunic, and furthermore omitting the tie. A double-breasted jacket was optional for officers and warrant officers. * Field service uniform (Felddienstuniform) ‚Äì The summer field uniform for both officers and enlisted consisted of a jacket and trousers originally in Flachtarnenmuster and then in Strichtarn, a dark-brown (later a forest green) raindrop camouflage pattern on a stone-gray background; a field cap, service cap, or steel helmet; high black boots; and a gray webbing belt with y-strap suspenders. In winter, a quilted stone gray padded suit without a camouflage pattern was worn over the service uniform. Later winter uniforms were also of the same camouflage pattern as the summer variant. The winter uniform also included a fur pile cap or a steel helmet, boots, knitted gray gloves, belt, and suspenders. * Work uniform (Arbeitsuniform) ‚Äì Seasonal considerations and weather governed the kind of work uniforms worn. Generally, reconditioned articles of service uniforms (field, semi-dress, and padded winter uniforms) were dyed black and issued for all types of fatigue and maintenance details. Coveralls are also used by the lower ranks, especially armor and air force personnel. Officers in technical branches supervising fatigue details wore a laboratory-style smock. * Other uniforms ‚Äì High-ranking officers occasionally wore white uniforms (or white jackets), and staff officers were issued distinctive staff service uniforms. Women wore uniforms consisting of jackets, skirts or slacks, blouses, caps, boots or pumps, and other appropriate items according to season and occasion. Personnel such as paratroopers, motorcyclists, and tank troops wore additional items with their uniforms identifying them as such. Fallschirmj√§ger uniform. Waffenfarben NVA personnel initially wore the Waffenfarben as worn by the Wehrmacht, but later reverted to white except for generals who wore red. The uniforms of the Border Troops were distinguished from that of the NVA ground force and Air Force/Air Defense Force by a green armband with large silver letters identifying the wearer's affiliation. Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment uniforms were nearly identical to those of the NVA and were distinguished primarily by the dark red MfS service color of its insignia and by an honorary cuff-band on the left sleeve bearing the regiment's name. Other Stasi officers wore a similar uniform, but without the cuff-band. Rank insignia NVA personnel displayed their rank insignia on shoulder boards or shoulder loops on service, semi-dress, and parade uniforms, and subdued sleeve insignia midway between the shoulder and elbow on the left sleeve of the field uniform, coveralls, or other special uniforms. A general officer rank was denoted by five-pointed silver stars mounted on a gold and silver braided shoulder cord set on a bright red base. All other officers and NCOs wore a four-pointed star. Like many of the armies of the other Warsaw Pact countries, NVA rank insignia followed the Soviet pattern in the arrangement of stars. The Volksmarine followed similar shoulder insignia for the naval officers (who also used sleeve insignia) and enlisted ratings except that these were blue and white or yellow (in the case of naval ratings). Awards and decorations The GDR had some seventy decorations for persons or groups it wished to recognize, and it bestowed them liberally. Some, such as battle decorations, were specifically set aside for armed forces personnel, many awarded to soldiers and civilians alike, and others, although ordinarily civilian awards, can on occasion be earned by those on military duty. The latter group included decorations for achievement in the arts, literature, production, and work methods. They were awarded to service personnel or specific units that participated in civil production projects or assisted during harvesting. The Order of Karl Marx, Patriotic Order of Merit, Star of People's Friendship, Banner of Labor, Order of Scharnhorst, and the National Prize were among the more important awards. Some, including the Order of Merit and the Star of People's Friendship, were awarded in three classes. A few were accompanied by substantial monetary premiums. The NVA did not permit military personnel to wear Wehrmacht awards and decorations. Periodicals The two main periodicals of the NVA were the weekly newspaper Volksarmee and the monthly soldier's magazine Armeerundschau. Relics The former Nazi holiday complex at Prora, on the island of R√ºgen, contains a number of museum displays. One of these is devoted to the NVA, which had used part of the complex as a barracks. Many German military museums host former NVA equipment like tanks and aircraft.

It reflects the lasting memories of power and prestige associated with the Roman Empire itself. Several polities have claimed immediate continuity with the Roman Empire, using its name or a variation thereof as their own exclusive or non-exclusive self-description. Unsurprisingly, as centuries went by and more political ruptures occurred, the idea of institutional continuity became increasingly debatable. The most enduring and significant claimants of continuation of the Roman Empire have been, in the East, the Byzantine Empire followed after 1453 by the Ottoman Empire; and in the West, the Holy Roman Empire from 800 to 1806. The abolition of the Ottoman sultanate in 1922 may thus be viewed as the moment when the Roman Empire ceased to continuously exist. Separately from claims of continuation, the view that the Empire had ended has led to various attempts to revive it or appropriate its legacy. In the respective contexts of Orthodox Russia since the 16th century and modern Italy between 1870 and 1945, such attempts have used the vocabulary of a \\"Third Rome\\" (the \\"second Rome\\" being, respectively, Constantinople and the Rome of the Popes) to convey their assertions of legitimate succession. Historiography and nomenclature In Western Europe, the view of the Deposition of Romulus Augustulus in 476 CE as a historic watershed, marking the fall of the Western Roman Empire and thus the beginning of the Middle Ages, was introduced by Leonardo Bruni in the early 15th century, strengthened by Christoph Cellarius in the late 17th century, and cemented by Edward Gibbon in the late 18th century. It is, however, little more than a historiographic convention, since the Imperial idea long survived the Western Roman Empire in most of Western Europe, and indeed reached territories that had never been under Roman rule during classical antiquity. The notion of the Eastern Roman Empire ending in 1453, also adopted by Gibbon, is similarly questionable. The Ottoman Sultans' assumed title of Emperor of the Romans (Kayser-i Rum) was justified by right of conquest, even though it was generally not accepted by the Christian states of Europe at the time and was only one among several sources of the Sultans' legitimation, even among their Christian subjects. To the extent the Ottomans' Imperial claim needed additional validation by a religious authority, it received it from Patriarch Gennadius Scholarius and his successors. The lack of acknowledgement of that continuity in traditional Western historiography can be viewed as a case of political and/or belief bias. Names De Byzantin√¶ histori√¶ scriptoribus, also known as the \\"\\", cover page with arms of Louis XIV What modern historiography calls the \\"Byzantine Empire\\" never used that expression, and kept calling itself the Roman Empire, Empire of the Romans, or Romania until the fall of Constantinople. Following the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire in 800, Christian Western Europeans were reluctant to apply the \\"Roman\\" epithet to the Eastern Empire and frequently called it \\"Empire of the Greeks\\" or \\"Greek Empire\\", even though they also used Romania - the latter also for the Latin Empire of the 13th century. By contrast, Muslims in the Levant and farther east typically referred to the people of the Eastern Empire as \\"Romans\\" (Rum), and to Western Europeans, including those from the Holy Roman Empire, as \\"Franks\\" (Farang). The name Byzantium refers to the ancient city on the Bosporus, now Istanbul, which Constantine renamed Constantinople in 330. It was not used thereafter, except in rare historical or poetic contexts, until it first took its new meaning in 1557 - when the German scholar Hieronymus Wolf published his Corpus Histori√¶ Byzantin√¶, a collection of historical sources about the Eastern Empire. Then from 1648 onwards, Philippe Labbe and fellow French Jesuits published the 24-volume De Byzantin√¶ histori√¶ scriptoribus, and in 1680 Du Cange produced his own Historia Byzantina. These endeavors further entrenched the use of the \\"Byzantine\\" label among French authors, including Montesquieu in the 18th century.Fox, What, If Anything, Is a Byzantine? Outside France in the Western world, it only came into general use around the mid-19th century, after Barthold Georg Niebuhr and his continuators published the 50-volume Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinae. Similarly, what historians call the \\"Carolingian Empire\\" and \\"Holy Roman Empire\\" - in French and Spanish, \\"Holy Roman Germanic Empire\\" (Saint Empire romain germanique, Sacro Imperio Romano Germ√°nico) was the Roman Empire, Empire of the Romans or simply Empire to their own subjects and rulers, with \\"Frankish\\" or \\"of the Franks\\" sometimes added depending on context. Only in 1157 did the twists and turns of the Investiture Controversy lead to the practice of calling the Empire, though not the Emperor himself, \\"holy\\" (sacrum).Peter Moraw, Heiliges Reich, in: Lexikon des Mittelalters, Munich & Zurich: Artemis 1977‚Äì1999, vol. 4, columns 2025‚Äì2028. The reference to Germany (Heiliges R√∂misches Reich Deutscher Nation, Sacrum Imperium Romanum Nationis Germanic√¶), which first appeared in the late 15th century, was never much used in official Imperial documents,Peter H. Wilson, \\"Bolstering the Prestige of the Habsburgs: The End of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806\\", in The International History Review, Vol. 28, No. 4 (Dec. 2006), p. 719. and even then was a misnomer since the Empire's jurisdiction in Italy had not entirely disappeared. Other colloquial designations in the early Modern era included \\"German Empire\\" () or \\"Roman-German Empire\\" (). In 1773, a few decades before the Holy Roman Empire's demise, Voltaire made the famous quip that it \\"was in no way holy, nor Roman, nor an empire.\\" Imperial legitimacy In the early decades of the Roman Empire, legitimacy was largely defined by the institutions inherited from the Roman Republic, initially together with a form of hereditary succession within the Julio-Claudian dynasty. As the old Republican institutions gradually lost relevance, many later Emperors derived their legitimacy from acclamation by the army, and during the Nerva‚ÄìAntonine dynasty, adoption by their predecessor. The Roman Empire itself was long defined by its eponymous capital, but this equation became blurred after the crisis of the Third Century as the administrative center was moved to Mediolanum (Milan), then further fragmented into various locations (e.g. Nicomedia, Sirmium, Augusta Treverorum, Serdica) before being reconsolidated by Constantine the Great in Byzantium, renamed and dedicated as Constantinople in 330 - while Ravenna replaced Milan as Western political capital in 402. Meanwhile, the Empire was Christianized in the course of the 4th century, which partly redefined the authority of the Emperor as he became the protector of the new state religion. Thus, the Imperial identity, and therefore the question of which polity could rightfully claim to be the Roman Empire, rested not on a single criterion but on a variety of factors: dominant territorial power and the related attributes of peace and order; rule over Rome and/or Constantinople; protection of justice and of the Christian faith (against paganism, heresy, and later Islam); as well as, albeit only intermittently, considerations of dynastic succession or of ethnic nationalism. Conflicting claims The multidimensionality of the imperial claim, together with the unique prestige of the imperial title, explains the recurrence of often intractable conflicts about which polities and rulers could rightfully assume them. These conflicts lost their potency in the course of the Early modern period, however, as improved communications and literacy increasingly undermined any claim of universal supremacy. A letter of Carolingian Emperor Louis II to Byzantine Emperor Basil I, probably drafted in Roman circles close to the Papacy in response to a lost original and surviving in 13th-century copy kept at the Vatican Library, articulates how the debate was framed in its time (ca. 871). The following quotes are from a full translation by scholar Charles West. Territorial rule over Constantinople is not the exclusive criterion for a rightful Imperial claim: While the Empire as an idea is unitary, there is no established doctrine that there should be only one Emperor at any time, especially if the two Emperors are on friendly terms. Whether on purpose or not, Louis's description of two Emperors of a single Empire matches the doctrine underlying the Tetrarchy or the division between Eastern and Western Empire between 395 and 476: Louis's claim is ancient enough to be justified by tradition since it has already held for several generations: Louis defends the Carolingian principle of dynastic succession as validated by tradition. Furthermore, there should be no exclusive ethnic criterion for the Imperial dignity. Here Louis apparently refers to a claim by Basil that the Emperor should be a Greek (Romanus in the Byzantine parlance of the time) and not from a non-Greek ethnicity (gens). Also, the rule over the city of Rome is as good a claim to Roman Imperial dignity as the rule over the \\"Romans\\", i.e. the (Greek) subjects of the Byzantine Empire: Using a modern vocabulary, Louis comes across as more inclusive than Basil on matters of ethnicity, but also more exclusive on dynastic legitimacy. Both points, of course, were self-serving, not least given Basil's own humble family background. Empire and Christianity Since the 4th century and particularly since the Edict of Thessalonica in 380, the defense and promotion of Christianity has been a key driver of Imperial identity. After that date, however, the territorial scope of the Empire or any of its continuating entities has never exactly coincided with that of Christendom, and the discrepancies led to enduring conflicts of legitimacy. The most consequential of these was the East-West Schism, which crystallized in 1054 as a consequence of longstanding fights over governance and jurisdiction (known as ecclesiastical differences) and over doctrine (theological differences), and can be fairly viewed as a delayed effect of the problem of two emperors arising from the creation of the Carolingian Empire in 800. Earlier examples include the preference of several \\"Barbarian\\" kingdoms during the Migration Period for Arianism after the competing Nicene Creed had regained dominance in Constantinople: the Burgundians until 516, Vandals until 534, Ostrogoths until 553, Suebi until the 560s, Visigoths until 587, and Lombards until 652. The adoption of Arianism protected these kingdoms' rulers from the religious disputes and policy initiatives of Constantinople, while being more acceptable to their majority-Catholic subjects than paganism. Emperor John VIII at the Council of Florence, by Benozzo Gozzoli, ca. 1459 On two occasions, the Eastern (Byzantine) Emperors reunited their church with its Western (Roman Catholic) counterpart, on political motivations and without durable effect. At the Second Council of Lyon in 1274, Emperor Michael VIII aimed to appease the Papacy to keep his \\"Frankish\\" adversaries in check, particularly Charles I of Anjou's plans to (re-)invade the Empire; the union was never widely accepted in Constantinople, and was reversed at the Council of Blachernae in 1285 after both Michael and Charles had died. At the Council of Ferrara/Florence in 1438-39, Emperor John VIII negotiated under the threat of Ottoman conquest, but the union agreement was again resisted in Constantinople and only proclaimed by Isidore of Kiev in December 1452, four years after John's death and too late to prevent the fall of Constantinople a few months later. Conversely, the Ottoman Sultans' policies as self-proclaimed Emperors of the Romans (i.e. in the language of the time, of the Eastern Orthodox Christians) supported the independence of the Orthodox Church from Rome and occasionally favored reforms to keep religiously-inspired separatism in check, e.g. the revival of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá in 1557. The initial instrument of that policy, Gennadius Scholarius, had been a prominent opponent of the union of the Eastern and Western churches in the 1440s and early 1450s. The link between Empire and Christianity has a durable legacy: to this day, Rome remains the seat of the Catholic Church, and Constantinople (Istanbul) that of the Ecumenical Patriarchate with a widely recognized status of primus inter pares within the Eastern Orthodox Church. (In 2018, the negotiations over autocephaly of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine led to a schism between Moscow and Constantinople as the Russian Orthodox Church unilaterally severed full communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate. A similar schism had occurred in 1996 over the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church, but unlike in 2018 it was resolved after a few months.) The Imperial connection extends, through the legacy of the Ottoman Empire, to Islam as well. Istanbul was also until 1923 the seat of the only widely recognized Caliphate of the last half-millennium, and keeps most of the surviving Relics of Muhammad as the Sacred Trust in Topkapƒ± Palace, close to the location of the former Roman Imperial palace. Imperial continuation in the East=Roman/Byzantine Empire until 1204 Territorial extent of the Roman/Byzantine Empire 476-1400 There is seamless continuity between the Roman and Byzantine Empires, to the extent that the date at which the former ends and the latter begins is essentially a matter of historiographical convention. The Byzantines consistency and near-exclusively called themselves Romans, before and after they adopted Greek as principal state language in the 7th century. Traditional Western European historiography retains 395 as the date of beginning of the Byzantine Empire, when Theodosius I was succeeded by Arcadius in the East and Honorius in the West. Alternative conventions date the transition from Rome to Byzantium at the translation of the imperial capital from Rome to Constantinople in 330, or at the reign of Heraclius marking the end of late antiquity. Even though the Byzantine Empire went through numerous political upheavals, and faced periods of dramatic contraction in the 7th and late 11th centuries, it exhibited unquestionable institutional continuity until 1204, not least because its central and defining seat of power, Constantinople, was never conquered during this period. Conversely, in the Eastern Mediterranean territories that ceased being part of the Empire during that period, there emerged almost no competing claim of Imperial legitimacy. In their different ways, the Avars and Slavs in the Balkans, and the Sasanians and Muslims in the Levant and Northern Africa, had different models of governance and no appetite for posing as Romans. This may also be linked to their inability to conquer the Imperial capital despite numerous attempts, as is suggested by the counter-example of the Ottoman Sultans claiming the Imperial title after 1453. =First Bulgarian Empire= In the period before 1204, the only significant competing Imperial claim in the East appeared in 913, when Simeon I of Bulgaria was crowned \\"Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans\\" (Car i samod«ér≈æec na vsiƒçki b«élgari i g«érci in the modern vernacular) by the Patriarch of Constantinople and imperial regent Nicholas Mystikos outside of the Byzantine capital. The decade 914‚Äì927 was then spent in a destructive Byzantine‚ÄìBulgarian war over the Imperial claim and other matters of conflict. The Bulgarian monarch was eventually recognized as \\"Emperor of the Bulgarians\\" (basileus t≈çn Boulgar≈çn) by the Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lakapenos in 924, following the convention also adopted with the Carolingian Empire that basileus (a Greek word that can translate as \\"king\\" or \\"emperor\\" depending on context) was not an equal title to that of the Emperor as long as it did not explicitly confer authority over the \\"Romans\\". Constantinople's recognition of the basileus dignity of the Bulgarian monarch and the patriarchal dignity of the Bulgarian patriarch was again confirmed at the conclusion of permanent peace and a Bulgarian‚ÄìByzantine dynastic marriage in 927. The Bulgarian title \\"tsar\\" (Caesar) was adopted by all Bulgarian monarchs up to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule. During the Second Bulgarian Empire, 14th-century literary compositions portrayed the then capital of Tarnovo, now Veliko Tarnovo, as successor of both Rome and Constantinople. Bulgarian contemporaries called the city \\"Tsarevgrad Tarnov\\", the Imperial city of Tarnovo, echoing the Bulgarian name then used for Constantinople, Tsarigrad. Fourth Crusade and its aftermath Political fragmentation in the aftermath of the sack of Constantinople, early 13th century The Fourth Crusade and sack of Constantinople in 1204 marked a major rupture in the history of the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire, and opened a period of fragmentation and competing claims of Imperial legitimacy. The crusading (\\"Latin\\") invaders divided most of the Empire among themselves by a formal treaty of partition, under which the Latin Empire of Constantinople's direct rule did not extend greatly further than the city itself. It included the Turkish Straits and their immediate hinterland, e.g. Adrianople and Nicomedia, but neither Salonica nor Nicaea. Other territories of the former Empire were not conquered by the Latin crusaders, and remained held by various holdovers of the former (\\"Greek\\") Empire. Several of the polities emerging from that fragmentation claimed to be the rightful successor of the prior Empire, on various motives: the Latin Empire held the Imperial capital; the rulers of the Empire of Trebizond stemmed from the formerly Imperial Komnenos family; those of the Despotate of Epirus (briefly the Empire of Thessalonica) were from the Angelos family, even though they renounced the imperial claim by accepting Nicaean overlordship in 1248; the Empire of Nicaea successfully claimed the patriarchate in 1206, and eventually prevailed through skillful management of alliances and its recapture of Constantinople in 1261. =Latin Empire of Constantinople= The Latin Empire had its own line of Imperial succession, initially dominated by the House of Flanders then by the French House of Courtenay. It was embattled almost from the start, however, as the city was never able to recover from the trauma of 1204. Despite its theoretical suzerainty, the Latin Empire was not even politically dominant among the crusader states, which were referred to as Latin or Frankish by Easterners. After being expelled from Constantinople in 1261, its titular Emperors occasionally held territorial power in parts of modern Greece. Jacques des Baux was Prince of Achaea in 1381-83, and the last recorded claimant to the Latin Imperial title. Late Byzantine era Byzantine Empire (purple) immediately before the fall of Constantinople The Palaiologos dynasty prolonged the Roman Imperial experience from its recovery of Constantinople in 1261 until the Ottoman conquest in 1453. The Empire shrunk considerably during that period, however, and at the end it was only the imperial city itself without any hinterland, plus most of the Peloponnese (then referred to as Morea) typically under the direct rule of one of the Emperor's sons with the title of Despot. This line of Imperial succession ceased in 1453: even though the Despotate of the Morea lingered on a few more years, until the Ottomans conquered it in 1460, its rulers at the time did not claim Imperial authority. =Serbian Empire= In 1345, the Serbian King Stefan Du≈°an proclaimed himself Emperor (Tsar) and was crowned as such at Skopje on Easter 1346 by the newly created Serbian Patriarch, as well as by the Patriarch of All Bulgaria and the Archbishop of Ohrid. His imperial title was recognized by, among others, the Bulgarian Empire, much diminished following the Battle of Velbazhd in 1330, albeit not by the Byzantine Empire. In Serbia, the title of \\"Emperor of Serbs and Romans\\" (in its final simplified form; —Ü–∞—Ä –°—Ä–±–∞ –∏ –†–∏–º—ô–∞–Ω–∞ in modern Serbian) was only employed thereafter by Stefan Du≈°an's son Stefan Uro≈° V until his death in 1371. A half-brother of Du≈°an, Simeon Uro≈°, and then his son Jovan Uro≈°, used the same title until the latter's abdication in 1373, while ruling as dynasts in Thessaly. =Empire of Trebizond= The Empire of Trebizond, one of the entities that had emerged from the fragmentation of the early 13th century, survived until Ottoman conquest in 1461. Its Komnenos rulers claimed the Imperial title for themselves in competition to the ones in Constantinople, even though they did not receive any meaningful international recognition. A separate polity on the Crimean coast of the Black Sea, the Principality of Theodoro, only fell to the Ottomans in 1475. There is no indication that its rulers made any claim of being Roman Emperors. =Andreas Palaiologos's cessions= Seal of Andreas Palaiologos, late 15th century. The Latin inscription translates as \\"Andreas Palaiologos by the Grace of God Despot of the Romans\\" Andreas Palaiologos, a nephew of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos and the head of what remained of the Palaiologos family, started calling himself Emperor of Constantinople in 1483 and, possibly childless, sold what he viewed as his imperial title to Charles VIII of France in 1494. The following Kings of France kept the claim until Charles IX in 1566, when it went into disuse. Charles IX wrote that the imperial Byzantine title \\"is not more eminent than that of king, which sounds better and sweeter.\\"David Potter, A History of France, 1460‚Äì1560: The Emergence of a Nation State, 1995, p. 33 In his last will in 1502, Andreas Palaiologos again ceded his self-awarded imperial title, this time to Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile.Polychrones Kyprianos Enepekides, Das Wiener Testament des Andreas Palaiologos vom 7. April 1502 Other pretenders to the Byzantine throne have appeared following his death that year, with increasingly dubious claims as centuries went by. Charles I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, who also claimed descent from the Palaiologos family, declared in 1612 his intent to reclaim Constantinople but only succeeded in provoking an upraising in the Mani Peninsula, which lasted until 1619. Ottoman Empire after 1453 Mehmed II and Gennadius II, 18th- century mosaic at the Fener Patriarchate in Istanbul After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Mehmed II declared himself Roman Emperor: Kayser-i Rum, literally \\"Caesar of the Romans\\", the standard title for earlier Byzantine Emperors in Arab, Persian and Turkish lands. In 1454, he ceremonially established Gennadius Scholarius, a staunch antagonist of Catholicism and of the Sultan's European enemies, as Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and ethnarch (milletbashi) of the Rum Millet, namely Greek Orthodox Christians within the Empire. In turn, Gennadius endorsed Mehmed's claim of Imperial succession.Dimitri Kitsikis, T√ºrk-Yunan ƒ∞mparatorluƒüu. Arab√∂lge ger√ßeƒüi ƒ±≈üƒ±ƒüƒ±nda Osmanlƒ± Tarihine bakƒ±≈ü ‚Äì ƒ∞stanbul, ƒ∞leti≈üim Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, 1996. Mehmed's claim rested principally with the idea that Constantinople was the rightful seat of the Roman Empire, as it had indeed been for more than a millenium even if the 1204-1261 period is subtracted. Contemporary scholar George of Trebizond wrote that \\"the seat of the Roman Empire is Constantinople (...) and he who is and remains Emperor of the Romans is also the Emperor of the whole world\\". An additional though questionable claim of legitimacy referred to the past alliances between the Ottoman dynasty and Byzantine Imperial families. Byzantine Princess Theodora Kantakouzene had been one of the wives of Orhan I, and an unsupported but widespread story portrayed Mehmed as a descendent of John Tzelepes Komnenos. Mehmed's imperial plans went further and aimed at conquering Rome itself, thus reuniting the Empire in a way it hadn't been for nearly eight centuries. His Italian campaign started in 1480 with the invasion of Otranto, but was cut short by Mehmed's sudden death on . None of his successors renewed that endeavor. Instead, they repeatedly (albeit never successfully) attempted to conquer the capital of the rival contenders to the Imperial Roman title, with a first siege of Vienna in 1529 and a second one in 1683. Being the rightful heir of the Roman/Byzantine Empire became part of the identity of the Sultanate, together with its Turkish and Muslim heritage, even though that dimension was played down by Western observers. In the words of scholar Asli Ergul: All subsequent Sultans of the Ottoman Empire kept Kayser-i Rum as one of their many titles, including the last one, Mehmed VI, until his deposition on . (Mehmed's cousin Abdulmejid II briefly succeeded him as Caliph and Amir al- Mu'minin, but never held the Imperial title.) In diplomatic exchanges with the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottomans initially refused to acknowledge the latter‚Äôs Imperial claim, because they saw themselves as the only rightful successors of Rome. In the Treaty of Constantinople (1533), the Austrian negotiators agreed not to make any mention of the holy Roman Empire, only referring to Ferdinand I as King of Germany and Charles V as King of Spain. The Ottomans, however, abandoned that requirement in the Treaty of Sitvatorok in 1606, and similarly to the Russian Empire in the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca in 1774. Chinese usage during the Ming dynasty referred to the Ottomans as Lumi (È≠ØËø∑), derived from R√ªmi, litterally \\"Roman\\". Imperial continuation in the West=Political fragmentation and Imperial overlordship Western Empire as it started to fragment, 418 CE Peak fragmentation in the West, 476 CE By the start of the 5th century, the Western Roman Empire remained close to its maximum territorial extent, notwithstanding the loss of the Agri Decumates during the crisis of the Third Century, but Roman rule had become fragime and many areas were depopulated. In the early years of the century, the Empire withdrew from Great Britain, leaving it open to Anglo-Saxon settlement. Mounting foreign incursions soon resulted in permanent settlement of Germanic and other ethnic groups into territories that became gradually autonomous, were sometimes acknowledged or even encouraged by treaty (foedus) by the Western Empire, and often embarked on expansion by further conquest. Thus, the Vandals crossed the Rhine in 406, the Pyrenees in 409, the Straight of Gibraltar in 428, and established the Vandal Kingdom in Northern Africa and the Western Mediterranean islands by the mid-5th century; the Suebi, initially moving alongside the Vandals, established their Western Iberian kingdom in 409; the Visigothic Kingdom was initially established by treaty in 418 in the Garonne Valley, and soon expanded into the Iberian Peninsula; the Alemanni expanded into Alsace and beyond, from their initial base in the Agri Decumates; in the 440s, the Kingdom of the Burgundians was established around the Rhone; an autonomous Kingdom of Soissons was carved out from 457 by Roman military commanders between the Seine and Somme rivers; last but not least, the Franks, which had been established north of the Rhine in 358 by treaty with Emperor Julian, expanded into what is now Belgium and Northern France. As a consequence, when the last Western Emperor Romulus Augustulus was deposed by military commander Odoacer in 476, his direct rule did not extend much beyond the current Northern borders of Italy. Another military leader, Julius Nepos, briefly Romulus Augustulus's predecessor, held territory in Dalmatia and kept the Imperial title until his assassination in 480. In a symbolic act that would fascinate later historians, Odoacer sent back the Imperial regalia or accessories of Romulus Augustulus to the Eastern Emperor Zeno in Constantinople. Far from signaling the end of imperial rule in Italy, however, this meant that Odoacer acknowledged Zeno's overlordship and did not claim full sovereignty. Like previous foederati leaders, he adopted the title of King (Rex) and ruled in the name of the remaining Emperors, namely Zeno and also Julius Nepos while the latter was still alive. This arrangement was kept by Theodoric the Great, who vanquished and killed Odoacer in 493 and replaced him as King of Italy. Justinian's reconquest campaigns in the West, 535-554 Political boundaries kept moving in the later 5th and 6th centuries. Clovis I, king of the Franks (d. 511), conquered Alemannia, the Kingdom of Soissons and most of the Visigothic Kingdom north of the Pyrenees, and his sons conquered the Kingdom of the Burgundians in 534, thus creating a vast kingdom of Francia, which was however periodically divided between various members of the Merovingian dynasty. Meanwhile, Eastern Emperor Justinian I reestablished direct Imperial rule in Southern Spain, North Africa and especially Italy, reconquered during the hard-fought Gothic War (535‚Äì554). Later in the 6th century, Emperor Maurice sponsored Gundoald, a member of Clovis's Merovingian dynasty, in his claim to the Frankish kingdom, which however ended unsuccessfully in 585 at Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges. Even though it was out of the Empire's direct military reach, Francia kept acknowledging the overlordship of Constantinople throughout the 6th century. At a ceremony in early 508 in Tours, Clovis received the insignia sent by Emperor Anastasius I which established his service to the Empire as Consul. Similarly, in the early 6th century, King Gundobad of the still-independent Burgundians, despite being an Arian, was Magister militum in the name of the Emperor. The Gesta pontificum Autissiodorensium, a compendium of information about the Bishops of Auxerre first compiled in the late 9th century, keeps referring to the reigning Roman Emperor up to Desiderius (d. 621), listed as bishop \\"in the reigns of Phocas and Heraclius\\" (imperantibus Foca, atque Heraclio). No such deference appears to have existed in the Visigothic Kingdom at the same time, however. Chris Wickham portrays the Visigothic king Euric (466-484) as \\"the first major ruler of a 'barbarian' polity in Gaul - the second in the Empire after Geiseric - to have a fully autonomous political practice, uninfluenced by any residual Roman loyalties.\\" Imperial rule in the West eroded further from the late 6th century. In Britain, to the extent discernible from scarce documentation, Roman rule was at best a distant memory. In Francia, references to Imperial overlordship disappear at the time of Merovingian renewal under Chlothar II and Dagobert I. In the Iberian Peninsula, the Visigothic King Suintila expelled the last Imperial forces from Southern Spain in 625. In Italy, the Lombards invaded in 568, and the resulting Kingdom of the Lombards was hostile to the Empire whose territorial footprint shrunk gradually. The Column of Phocas on the Roman Forum, dedicated in 608, counts among the last monumental expressions of (Eastern) Imperial power in Rome. Constans II was the last (Eastern) Emperor to visit Rome for centuries, in 663, and plundered several of the remaining monuments to adorn Constantinople. =Papal pivot= The Roman Papacy was to become the instrument of the Imperial idea's revival in the West. The position of the Popes had been strengthened by the reconquest of Rome by Justinian, as the Emperors periodically reaffirmed the traditional primacy of the Bishop of Rome to check the potential political influence of the Patriarch of Constantinople. Furthermore, for various reasons, Catholicism finally triumphed over Arianism in the Western kingdoms: in the Visigothic Iberian Peninsula with the conversion of Reccared I in 587, and in Lombard-held Italy, after some back-and-forth, following the death of King Rothari in 652. The promotion of iconoclasm by Emperor Leo III the Isaurian from 726 led to a deepening rupture between the Eastern Empire and the Papacy. Pope Gregory II saw iconoclasm as the latest in a series of imperial heresies. In 731, his successor Pope Gregory III organized a synod in Rome which declared iconoclasm punishable by excommunication. Leo III responded in 732/33 by confiscating all papal patrimonies in south Italy and Sicily, and further removed the bishoprics of Thessalonica, Corinth, Syracuse, Reggio, Nicopolis, Athens, and Patras from papal jurisdiction, instead subjecting them to the Patriarch of Constantinople. This was in effect an act of triage: it strengthened the imperial grip in Southern Italy, but all but guaranteed the eventual destruction of the exarchate of Ravenna, which soon occurred at Lombard hands. In effect, the papacy had been \\"cast out of the empire\\". Pope Zachary, in 741, was the last pope to announce his election to a Byzantine ruler or seek their approval. Coronation of Pepin the Short by Pope Stephen II in 754 (right), miniature by Jean Fouquet, Grandes Chroniques de France, ca. 1455-1460 The Popes needed to quickly reinvent their relationship to secular authority. Even though the neighboring Lombard kings were no longer heretical, they were often hostile. The more powerful and more distant Franks, which had by and large been allies of the Empire, were an alternative option as potential protectors. In 739, Gregory III sent a first embassy to Charles Martel seeking protection against Liutprand, King of the Lombards, but the Frankish strongman had been Liutbrand's ally in the past and had asked him in 737 to ceremonially adopt his son. The Papacy had more luck with the latter, Pepin the Short, who succeeded Charles in October 741 together with his elder brother Carloman (who withdrew from public life and became a monk in 747). Pope Zachary was pressed into action by the final Lombard campaign against the exarchate of Ravenna, whose fall in mid-751 sealed the end of Byzantine rule in Central Italy. He was in contact with the Frankish ruling elites through the venerable Boniface, Archbishop of Mainz, and other clerics such as Burchard of W√ºrzburg and Fulrad. In March 751 he moved to depose Childeric III, the last Merovingian King, following which Pepin was dedicated as King of France in Soissons. In 754, Zachary's successor Pope Stephen II undertook the first-ever papal visit north of the Alps, met Pepin in Ponthion and anointed him as king at Saint-Denis on July 28, setting the template for later rites of coronation of French Kings. Stephen further legitimized the Carolingian dynasty by also anointing Pepin's sons Charles and Carloman, by prohibiting the election of any non-descendent of Pepin as king, and by proclaiming that \\"the Frankish nation is above all nations\\". This in return prompted the Donation of Pepin in 756, cementing the Popes' rule over the Papal States over the next eleven centuries. Subsequently in 773-774, Pepin's son and successor Charlemagne conquered the Lombard Kingdom of Italy. Holy Roman Empire Coronation of Charlemagne, probably by Gianfrancesco Penni on a design by Raphael, fresco in the Raphael Rooms of the Vatican, 1516-1517 Carolingian (yellow) and Byzantine (purple) Empires in the early 9th century Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire, late 10th / early 11th century The coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III, in Rome on Christmas Day 800, was explicitly intended as establishing continuity with the Roman Empire that still existed in the East. In Constantinople, Irene of Athens had blinded and deposed her son Emperor Constantine VI a few years earlier. With no precedent of a woman being sole holder of the imperial title, her critics in the West (e.g. Alcuin) viewed the imperial throne as vacant rather than recognizing her as Empress. Thus, as Peter H. Wilson put it, \\"it is highly likely Charlemagne believed he was being made Roman Emperor\\" at the time of his coronation. Charlemagne's imperial title, however, rested on a different base from any of the Roman emperors until him, as it was structurally reliant on the partnership with the Papacy, embodied in the act of his coronation by the Pope. Meanwhile, the accession to the Byzantine throne of Nikephoros I in 802 confirmed the conflict of legitimacy between the Frankish and Byzantine incarnations of the Roman Empire, known in historiography as the problem of two emperors (in German, Zweikaiserproblem). According to Theophanes the Confessor, Charlemagne had attempted to prevent that conflict with a project to marry Irene, but this was not completed. The territorial conflicts were addressed in the following years through a series of negotiations known as the Pax Nicephori, but the broader conflict with Constantinople about Imperial legitimacy proved extremely durable. Political authority fragmented within the Empire following Charlemagne's death. The eventual outcome was an association of the Imperial dignity with the Easternmost (\\"German\\") lands of the Carolingian geography, but that was not self-evident at the start and took a long time to happen. From 843 to 875, the holders of the Imperial title only ruled over Northern Italy and, at the start, the \\"middle kingdom\\" of Lotharingia. On Christmas Day 875, exactly 75 years after Charlemagne, Charles the Bald of West Francia was crowned Emperor in Rome by Pope John VIII, adopting the motto renovatio imperii Romani et Francorum, which raised the prospect of an Empire centered on what is today France. But Charles died soon afterwards in 877. His successor Charles the Fat only briefly managed to reunite all the Carolingian domains, and after his death in 888 the Western part of Francia was dominated by the non-Carolingian Robertians, later the Capetian dynasty. For over seven decades the Emperors' authority was then mostly confined to Northern Italy, until Otto I revived the Imperial idea and was crowned by Pope John XII in Rome in 862. From then on, all Emperors had dynastic roots in the Germanic- speaking lands (even though Frederick II was born in Italy, Henry VII in Valenciennes, Charles IV in Prague, Charles V in Ghent, Ferdinand I in Spain, Charles VII in Brussels, Francis I in Nancy, and Francis II in Florence). During the millennium of the Holy Roman Empire, several specific attempts were made to recall the Empire's classical heritage. Emperor Otto III reigned from Rome from 998 to his death in 1002, and made a short-lived attempt to revive ancient Roman institutions and traditions in partnership with Pope Sylvester II, who chose his papal name as an echo of the time of Constantine the Great. Frederick II took a keen interest in Roman antiquity, sponsored archaeological excavations, organized a Roman-style triumph in Cremona in 1238 to celebrate his victory at the battle of Cortenuova, and had himself depicted in classical imagery. Similarly, Maximilian I was highly mindful of classical references in his \\"memorial\\" projects of the 1510s that included the three monumental woodblock prints of the Triumphal Arch, Triumphal Procession and Large Triumphal Carriage. =Empire and Papacy= According to his biograph Einhard, Charlemagne was unhappy about his coronation, a fact that later historians have interpreted as displeasure about the Pope's assumption of the key role in the legitimation of Imperial rule. Instead of the traditional recognition by popular acclamation, Leo III had crowned Charlemagne at the outset of the ceremony, just before the crowd acclaimed him. In September 813, Charlemagne tried to override that precedent by himself crowning his son Louis the Pious in Aachen, but the principle of Papal coronation survived and was renewed in 962 when Otto I restored the Empire and its rituals after decades of turmoil. The interdependence between Pope and Emperor led to conflict after the Papacy started asserting its position with the Gregorian Reform of the mid-11th century. The Investiture Controversy (1076-1122) was followed by wars of Guelphs and Ghibellines (the respective partisans of the Pope and the Emperor) that lasted until the 15th century. In 1527, the Pope's involvement in the Italian Wars led to the traumatic sack of Rome, after which the Papacy's influence in international politics was significantly reduced. =Empire and Kingdoms= Early in the Empire's history, Louis the Pious formally established the supremacy of the Empire over Catholic kingdoms through the document issued in 817 and later known as Ordinatio Imperii. The view at the time was that the Empire covered all Western Christendom under one authority. (The British Isles, Brittany, and the Kingdom of Asturias were omitted in this vision.) Under Louis's arrangement, only his elder son Lothair would hold the title of Emperor, and Lothair's younger brothers Pepin and Louis should obey him even though they were kings, respectively, of Aquitaine and Bavaria. That document was controversial from the start, however, not least as it did not conform to Frankish succession law and practices. Following Louis the Pious's death in June 840, the Battle of Fontenoy (841), Oaths of Strasbourg (842) and Treaty of Verdun (843) established a different reality, in which the Imperial title remained undivided but its holder competed with kings for territory, even though at the time all were still bound by the family links of the Carolingian dynasty and the bounds of Catholic Christianity. Following the gradual demise of the Carolingian dynasty in the late 9th and 10th centuries, the rivalry between the Empire and individual kingdoms developed on these early precedents. The Kingdom of France, developing from Charles the Bald's West Francia, was continually reluctant to acknowledge the Emperor's senior status among European monarchs. As Latin Christendom expanded in the High Middle Ages, new kingdoms appeared outside of the Empire and would similarly bid for territory and supremacy. France itself was instrumental in the developments that led to the Empire's political decline from the 16th to the early 19th centuries. Modern-era nationalist revivals A number of political regimes have claimed various forms of successorship of the Roman Empire, even though they acknowledged a significant time lag between what they viewed as the Empire's extinction and their own efforts to revive it. These attempts have increasingly been framed in nationalist terms, in line with the times. Despite its name, European imperialism has typically not invoked the memories of the Roman Empire, with the only exception of Italy for a few decades in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thus, European colonial empires are not mentioned in this section. Imperial Russia Coat of arms of the Russian Empire with the double- headed eagle, formerly associated with the Byzantine Empire Ivan III of Russia in 1472 married Sophia (Zo√©) Palaiologina, a niece of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI, and styled himself Tsar (–¶–∞—Ä—å, \\"Caesar\\") or imperator. In 1547, Ivan IV cemented the title as \\"Tsar of All Rus\\" (–¶–∞—Ä—å –í—Å–µ—è –†—É—Å–∏). In 1589, the Metropolitanate of Moscow was granted autocephaly by the Patriarchate of Constantinople and thus became the Patriarchate of Moscow, thanks to the efforts of Boris Godunov. This sequence of events supported the narrative, encouraged by successive rulers, that Muscovy was the rightful successor of Byzantium as the \\"Third Rome\\", based on a mix of religious (Orthodox), ethno-linguistic (East Slavic) and political ideas (the autocracy of the Tsar). Supporters of that view also asserted that the topography of the seven hills of Moscow offered parallels to the seven hills of Rome and the seven hills of Constantinople. In 1492 Zosimus, Metropolitan of Moscow, in a foreword to his Presentation of the Paschalion, referred to Ivan III as \\"the new Tsar Constantine of the new city of Constantine ‚Äî Moscow.\\" In a panegyric letter to Grand Duke Vasili III composed in 1510, Russian monk Philotheus (Filofey) of Pskov proclaimed, \\"Two Romes have fallen. The third stands. And there will be no fourth. No one shall replace your Christian Tsardom!\\"Mashkov, A.D. Moscow is the Third Rome (–ú–û–°–ö–í–ê ‚Äì –¢–†–ï–¢–Ü–ô –†–ò–ú). Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia. Risorgimento and Fascist Italy Italy's nationalist visionary Giuseppe Mazzini promoted the notion of the \\"Third Rome\\" during the Risorgimento: \\"After the Rome of the emperors, after the Rome of the Popes, there will come the Rome of the people\\", addressing Italian unification and the establishment of Rome as the capital.Rome Seminar After the Italian unification into the Kingdom of Italy, the state was referred to as the Third Rome by some Italian figures.Christopher Duggan. The Force of Destiny: A History of Italy Since 1796. New York, New York, USA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008. p. 304. After unification, Rome was chosen as capital despite its relative backwardness as it evoked the prestige of the former Empire. Mazzini spoke of the need of Italy as a Third Rome to have imperial aspirations, to be realized in the Italian Empire.Silvana Patriarca, Lucy Riall. The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth- Century Italy. p. 248. Mazzini said that Italy should \\"invade and colonize Tunisian lands\\" as it was the \\"key to the Central Mediterranean\\", and he viewed Italy as having the right to dominate the Mediterranean Sea as ancient Rome had done. In his speeches, Benito Mussolini echoed the rhetoric of the Risorgimento and referred to his regime as a \\"Third Rome\\" or as a New Roman Empire.Martin Clark, Mussolini: Profiles in Power (London: Pearson Longman, 2005), 136. Terza Roma (Third Rome) was also a name for Mussolini's plan to expand Rome towards Ostia and the sea. The EUR neighbourhood was the first step in that direction.Discorso pronunciato in Campidoglio per l'insediamento del primo Governatore di Roma il 31 dicembre 1925, Internet Archive copy of a page with a Mussolini speech. Non-Roman reinterpretations Apotheose of Empire (Hermann Wislicenus, ca. 1880) in the Kaisersaal of the Goslar Imperial Palace. Frederick Barbarossa and other Holy Roman Emperors are watching William I and his son Frederick from the sky; on the sides are, left, Bismarck holding a hammer and Generalfeldmarschall von Moltke; and right, the personifications of just-conquered Alsace and Lorraine as ancestral Imperial lands. Several political regimes in the 19th and early 20th centuries defined themselves with reference to continuators of the Roman Empire, but not to the (Classical) Roman Empire itself. They all assumed nationalist reinterpretations of those continuators, and underplayed the extent to which the latter had portrayed themselves as Roman. * Napoleon I of France claimed the heritage of the Frankish Empire, both the Merovingians, conveniently forgetting the fact that they acknowleded Constantinople's overlordship, and Carolingians, whose legacy was easy to appropriate since he had conquered their heartlands in what are now Belgium and Western Germany. Thus, from his imperial coronation as Emperor of the French on , he used both the symbolism of the bees from the burial of Childeric I (which had been unearthed in 1653 in Tournai) and a mock-Carolingian style for his coronation crown, which he dubbed the Crown of Charlemagne. Even after his first defeat, Napolean again borrowed the Merovingian-inspired bees to compose the Flag of Elba. * The Austrian Empire, and after it the Austrian Republic, borrowed from the imagery and symbolism of the Holy Roman Empire following its demise in 1806. To this day, the Imperial eagle is a symbol of the Austrian government, as is also the case in Germany. * In Greece, the Megali Idea (\\"Great Idea\\") developed shortly after the War of Independence of recreating the Byzantine Empire, understood as an ethnic-Greek polity with capital in Constantinople. The idea first appeared during the debates of Prime Minister Ioannis Kolettis with King Otto that preceded the promulgation of the 1844 constitution.History of Greece Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online This nationalist aspiration drove Greek foreign relations and, to a significant extent, domestic politics for much of the first century after independence. The expression was new in 1844 but the concept had roots in the Greek popular psyche - the \\"Greece of Two Continents and Five Seas\\" (Europe and Asia, the Ionian, Aegean, Marmara, Black and Libyan seas, respectively). The effort to realize the idea after the World War I defeat of the Ottoman Empire, however, ended in disaster with the Greco- Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922), as did the 1974 Cypriot coup d'√©tat which attempted Enosis or the unification of Cyprus with Greece. * The German Empire in 1871 claimed lineage from the Holy Roman Empire, reinterpreted as a national (German) rather than universalist endeavor - thus the lingering historiographical question on whether it started with the coronation of Charlemagne in 800, or (according to the nationalist version) in 962 with the coronation of the more unambiguously German Otto I. The narrative of continuity from the Ottonians to the Hohenzollern was expressed in countless occasions, e.g. the creative restoration of the Imperial Palace of Goslar in the 1870s.Warwick Ball. Rome in the East: The Transformation of an Empire. London, England, UK: Routledge, 2000. p. 449.Craig M. White. The Great German Nation: Origins and Destiny. AuthorHouse, 2007. p. 169. Nazi Germany subsequently called itself the Third Reich (Drittes Reich), succeeding both the Holy Roman Empire and the Bismarckian German Empire. The Holy Roman Empire reference was awkward, however, as it did not fit well with Nazi ideology. In 1939, a circular not intended for publication prohibited further use of the expression \\"Third Reich\\".Reinhard Bollmus: Das Amt Rosenberg und seine Gegner. Studien zum Machtkampf im nationalsozialistischen Herrschaftssystem. Stuttgart 1970, S. 236. Supranationalism and the Imperial idea In the 20th century, several political thinkers and politicians have associated the multi-level governance and multilingualism of the Roman Empire in its various successive incarnations with the modern legal concepts of federalism and supranationalism. The Holy Roman Empire, in particular, was a source of inspiration for promoters of supranational institutions, as its development and constitution stood in contrast to the nationalist underpinning of nation- states. Indeed, the Golden Bull of 1356's final clause made multilingualism a legal requirement for the Empire's political leaders: League of Nations French historian , in a 1926 article titled The Imperial Idea in the History of Europe, portrayed the newly created League of Nations as the modern expression of an \\"Imperial idea\\" that had been degraded by the nationalistic drift of the German Empire, Habsburg Monarchy and Russian Empire. He argued that the three empires' final demise and the League's establishment represent a renewal of the Imperial idea: European Union Logo of the Court of Justice of the European Union Memories of the Roman Empire have accompanied the European Union since its inception with the 1950 Schuman Plan. Whereas the project's main architect, Jean Monnet, was a forward-looking pragmatist, several other key protagonists, in particular Konrad Adenauer and Robert Schuman, came from the heartlands of the Holy Roman Empire and associated it with a positive legacy. In a record kept at the Jean Monnet Foundation for Europe, American diplomat John J. McCloy, a key witness and promoter of early European integration, noted at the time of the Schuman Plan discussions that \\"Adenauer was something like a Holy Roman Emperor (...) Adenauer had a genuine belief in the idea of Western European unity. (...) He viewed the Holy Roman Empire as one of the greatest era in history.\\" A few years later, the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community was signed in March 1957 at the Palazzo dei Conservatori on Rome's Capitoline Hill, a place charged with Roman Imperial symbolism if there is any. Latin, the ancient language of the Roman Empire, is used by several EU Institutions in their logos and domain names, as lingua franca and in order to avoid listing their names in all the official languages, even though it is not one of the official languages of the European Union. For example, the Court of Justice of the European Union has its website at https://curia.europa.eu/. The European Court of Auditors uses Curia Rationum in its logo. The Council of the European Union has its website at http://www.consilium.europa.eu/. In 2006, the six-month Finnish presidency of the Council of the European Union created a website in Latin to report on its policy developments. The Institutional seats of the European Union are all in places associated with the memory of the Holy Roman Empire. Brussels was viewed by Charles V as \\"the center of his Empire\\". Strasbourg was one of the main Imperial Free Cities, and so was Frankfurt - the latter being also where Emperors were crowned from 1562 onwards, in the Kaiserdom. As for Luxembourg, its name is associated with Luxemburg dynasty which provided several Emperors in the 14th and 15th centuries. The most prominent prize awarded for work done in the service of European unification is called the Charlemagne Prize. The comparison of the European Union with the Holy Roman Empire, in a negative or positive light, is a common trope of political commentary. Criticism The view of the European Union as a reincarnation of a foreign and overbearing Roman Empire is one of the clich√©s of nationalist critiques of the EU in some European countries, particularly the United Kingdom. The 2020 withdrawal of the UK from the Union, or Brexit, has been variously compared with the Boudica Rebellion or with end of Roman rule in Britain. A different critical view of the European Union as new Roman Empire has been regularly formulated in Christian fundamentalist circles, principally in the United States. According to that view, the EU, like other supranational endeavors such as the United Nations and World Bank, by attempting to revive the Roman Empire, signals the approaching end time, rapture or Second Coming. Occasionally, the European Union is portrayed as a \\"Fourth Reich\\", further emphasizing its demonic nature. This critique is often portrayed as fringe despite its widespread following among American Evangelicals for several decades. Institutions and emblems Roman Eagle, adopted by Rome in the early 1st century BC, has an enduring legacy as a symbol of power in multiple political regimes (sculpture at the Yorkshire Museum) Toponymy and ethnonymy The Imperial Roman name survived and still survives in a number of regions and was thus adopted by political regimes that ruled those regions, even in cases when those regimes did not claim to be a latter-day incarnation of the Roman Empire. These include: * Romagna, the Italian region that was the administrative center of Byzantine Italy and thus remained associated with the Roman Empire when most of the country had fallen under Lombard rule; * R√ªm, the name by which the Seljuq Turks referred to the parts of Anatolia which they had conquered from the Eastern Roman Empire, thus the common name of the Sultanate of Rum for their realm (1077-1308).Alexander Kazhdan, \\"R≈´m\\" The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium (Oxford University Press, 1991), vol. 3, p. 1816. Paul Wittek, Rise of the Ottoman Empire, Royal Asiatic Society Books, Routledge (2013), p. 81: \\"This state too bore the name of R√ªm, if not officially, then at least in everyday usage, and its princes appear in the Eastern chronicles under the name 'Seljuks of R√ªm' (Ar.: Sal√¢jika ar-R√ªm). A. Christian Van Gorder, Christianity in Persia and the Status of Non-muslims in Iran p. 215: \\"The Seljuqs called the lands of their sultanate Rum because it had been established on territory long considered 'Roman', i.e. Byzantine, by Muslim armies.\\" * Romania, a habitual reference in medieval Latin and Romance languages to the Byzantine Empire, or between 1204 and 1261 to the Latin Empire. It survived for a time in place names such as that of Nafplio, which in Italian was referred to as Napoli in Romania well into the modern era. * Rumelia, the Balkanic parts of the former Eastern Empire, labelled \\"land of the Romans\\" following their conquest by the Ottomans and at a time when the Asia Minor territories formerly known as Rum were more commonly referred to again as Anatolia. * The modern country of Romania. Tracing the origin of the Romanians to the Roman Empire's province of Dacia has long been part of the national narrative in spite of the scarcity of conclusive evidence. The \\"Roman\\" demonym referring to Romance speakers in Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania appeared in the 16th century (with various vernacular spellings) under the influence of Renaissance humanism. The word Romance, naming the language family that also includes Spanish, Portuguese, French and Italian among others, is itself derived from \\"Roman\\". Romaniote Jews derive their name from the former Eastern/Byzantine/Ottoman Empire. The Romani people, by contrast, are named after an unrelated Sanskrit root common with the Domba people in India.

Introduced in 1991, she is the spouse of the character Miles O'Brien in the series Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-1994) and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993-1999). In the Star Trek universe, Keiko Ishikawa is introduced on her wedding day, about to be married to the character Miles O'Brien. We learn Keiko Ishikawa is going to be married in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode Data's Day which was broadcast on syndicated television in 1991. Another important episode for Keiko is \\"Disaster\\" (aired 1991) in which she gives birth to her daughter Molly O'Brien. Keiko and her family is noted as example of how Star Trek was able to expand its narrative beyond weekly space missions. Keiko and her family were regularly featured through the entire run of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Although the Deep Space Nine producers wanted to employ her as a full-time cast member in 1993, Chao could only work part-time, due to her pregnancy at the time and desire to pursue other projects. The character has also been included in other Star Trek media, such as novels. Casting and history Keiko is played by actress Rosalind Chao. In a 1996 interview with Chicago Tribune, Chao noted how actress Nana Visitor's real life pregnancy lead to an impact on the plot and stories of the television show Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. At the time Chao was playing Keiko on that show, and the writers then established that Visitor's character, the Bajoran alien Kira Nerys, would be carrying Keiko and Miles' child. Chao notes that this is one of the times that real-life events of the cast affected a fictional plot of the characters on the television show. Roasalind Chao was offered a role to become a full-time addition to the cast of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, which is what the makers of that show wanted. However, the actress had to turn down this role because the demands of being part of the cast full-time was too strenuous for her. In a later interview, the actress stated she believed she made the right choice, and was still able to appear many times on the show, but not as many times as the full-time characters. Chao was born in the city of Los Angeles, California, and went to college at University of Southern California. She went on to various acting roles eventually leading to her debut as Keiko in the fourth season of Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Data's Day\\" (aired 1991). Chao is a noted Asian-American actress, and starred in the 1993 film adaptation of The Joy Luck Club. Keiko appears as a child in the episode \\"Rascals\\", played by Caroline Junko King. Actress Patti Yasutake auditioned for the role of Keiko character, but was not chosen for the role for which Chao was cast. Yasutake was cast as the Star Trek: The Next Generation character Alyssa Ogawa, who was featured primarily as a space nurse aboard the fictional USS Enterprise D spaceship on the television show. Although Yasutake did not get the role of Keiko, her character, Nurse Ogawa, would be included in 16 episodes of TNG and also make appearances in two Star Trek theatrical films. Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine In January 1991, a new character was introduced to the hit science fiction television show Star Trek: The Next Generation, Keiko, played by actress Rosalind Chao. Keiko went on to be a recurring character on both Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Keiko Ishikawa married Miles O'Brien aboard the USS Enterprise DOkuda, Michael; Okuda, Denise. The Star Trek Encyclopedia, Pocket Books/Simon and Schuster, 1999, p. 330: \\"Born Keiko Ishikawa, she married fellow crew member Miles O'Brien in 2367...aboard the Enterprise-D\\" in the TNG episode \\"Data's Day\\". A year later, in Ten- Forward, she gave birth to a daughter, Molly, with Worf as midwife (TNG episode \\"Disaster\\"). Molly was played by Hana Hatae, starting with the TNG episode \\"Rascals\\". Hatae also played this role on Deep Space Nine. As an adult Hatae recalls being outside at Malibu Creek to film scenes for the episode \\"Time's Orphan\\". Rosalind Chao as Keiko O'Brien was part of the recurring cast of the television show Star Trek Deep Space Nine. Miles O'Brien (played by Colm Meaney), her spouse on the TV show was part of the main cast. When Miles was reassigned to Deep Space Nine, Keiko decided to start a school, and Jake Sisko and Nog were the first students to enroll. Later on Keiko went on an archeobotanical expedition to Bajor. After becoming pregnant with her second child, Keiko returned to Deep Space Nine. An accident endangered mother and child. Doctor Julian Bashir saved both by removing the fetus and implanting it into Kira Nerys's womb. In her honor, the child was named Kirayoshi O'Brien. Kira gives birth to Keiko and Miles's baby in the episode \\"The Begotten\\" of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. When the Dominion War began, Keiko and the children were evacuated away from the war zones. They remained away for a time until the fields of battle had shifted far enough away to make Deep Space Nine safe again. After the war, the O'Brien family relocated to Earth when Miles became a professor at Starfleet Academy. What We Left Behind Stock footage of Rosalind Chao as Keiko was re-scanned at film resolution and used in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine documentary and bookend film What We Left Behind, which was shown in theaters in limited release in 2019. The documentary was noted for raising support from fans of the TV show. What We Left Behind in a one-day one-showing release played at about 800 theaters and grossed over US$380,000 in May 2019. Novels The character of Keiko has appeared in over twenty Star Trek novels. Examples of Star Trek novels that mention Keiko are The Fall: Revelation and Dust, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Warpath, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Warped, and The Tempest. Reception=Noted episodes An example of an episode featuring Keiko that is highly rated is \\"The Wounded\\" in Star Trek: The Next Generation; in 2016, Empire ranked this episode the 31st best out of the top 50 episodes of the 700 plus Star Trek television episodes. Another noted episode with Keiko is \\"Disaster\\"; in 2009 Time magazine rated it as one of the top ten moments of Star Trek (including television and film productions). Character critiques and rankings In 2015, SyFy rated Keiko as among the top 21 most interesting supporting characters of Star Trek, describing her has a fascinating character. In 2017, IndieWire ranked Keiko as the 14th best character on Star Trek: The Next Generation. The words in Keiko's hybrid Japanese-Irish wedding on television were based on Captain Kirk's in the original series episode \\"Balance of Terror\\" (aired 1966) according to writer Ronald D. Moore as noted by The Star Trek Encyclopedia. In 2017, the book To Boldly Go: Essays on Gender and Identity in the Star Trek Universe states that Keiko has the only successful long-term relationship in the entire Star Trek universe with her marriage to Miles O'Brien, noting that they are married in the fourth season of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and go on to have two children, Molly and Yoshi. In 2018, CBR ranked Keiko the 7th best recurring character in all of Star Trek.

Prior to the proclamation of an East German state, the Soviets established in 1948 the German Economic Commission (DWK) as a de facto government in their occupation zone. Its chairman was Heinrich Rau. On 7 October 1949 an East German state, called the German Democratic Republic (GDR), was proclaimed and took the governmental functions over from the DWK. (Largely with the same function owners.) For most of its existence (until autumn of 1989), the most important position in the GDR was that of the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) (titled as the First Secretary between 1953‚Äì1976). The Communist party and its leader held ultimate power and authority over state and government. The formal head of state originally was the President of the German Democratic Republic. After the death of incumbent Wilhelm Pieck in 1960, the office was replaced by a collective head of state, the State Council. The position of chairman was commonly held by the party leader. Government was headed by the Council of Ministers and its chairman, sometimes colloquially called Prime Minister. Other important institutions included the People's Chamber, whose sessions were chaired by a President of the People's Chamber, and, since 1960, the National Defense Council, which held supreme command of the GDR's armed forces and had unlimited authority over the State in time of war. The Council was composed exclusively of members of the SED's Central Committee and Politburo, with the party leader serving as Chairman of the National Defense Council. The political landscape was completely changed by the Peaceful Revolution late in 1989, which saw the SED having to relinquish its monopoly on political power and the National Defense Council and the State Council being abolished. The remaining institutions were the People's Chamber, whose President by default became head of state for the remainder of the GDR's existence, and the Council of Ministers, both now based on the country's first and only democratic elections in March 1990.

Career  Seal of Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick Knighted around 1355, Beauchamp accompanied John of Gaunt in campaigns in France in 1373, and around that time was made a Knight of the Garter. In the parliaments of 1376 and 1377 he was one of those appointed to supervise reform of King Richard II's government. When these were not as effective as hoped, Beauchamp was made Governor over the King. In 1377, or 1378, he granted the manors of Croome Adam (now Earls Croome) in Worcestershire and Grafton Flyford in Warwickshire to Henry de Ardern for a red rose.Driver, J. T.

Beauchamp brought a large contingent of soldiers and archers to King Richard's Scottish campaign of 1385.  Conflict with King Richard II  In 1387 he was one of the Lords Appellant, who endeavored to separate Richard from his favorites. After Richard regained power, Beauchamp retired to his estates, but was invited to London on a ruse in 1397 and charged with high treason, supposedly as a part of the Earl of Arundel's alleged conspiracy. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London (in what is now known as the \\"Beauchamp Tower\\"), pleaded guilty and threw himself on the mercy of the king. He forfeited his estates and titles, and was sentenced to life imprisonment on the Isle of Man. The next year, however, he was moved back to the Tower, until he was released in August 1399 after Henry Bolingbroke's initial victories over King Richard II.

Along with Tracy Hickman, Weis is one of the original creators of the Dragonlance game world. Early life Margaret Weis was born on March 16, 1948, in Independence, Missouri. She discovered heroic fantasy fiction while studying at the University of Missouri (MU): \\"I read Tolkien when it made its first big sweep in the colleges back in 1966,\\" she said. \\"A girlfriend of mine gave me a copy of the books while I was in summer school at MU. I literally couldn't put them down! I never found any other fantasy I liked, and just never read any fantasy after Tolkien.\\" Weis graduated from MU in 1970 with a bachelor's degree in creative writing and literature. Career Weis first worked for a small publishing company in Independence, where she became an editor. From 1972 to 1983 she worked for Herald Publishing House as advertising director and subsequently as director of Independence Press, Herald Publishing's trade division from 1981 to 1983. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Weis wrote children's books about computer graphics, robots, the history of Thanksgiving, the outlaws Frank and Jesse James, and an adventure book at a second-grade reading level for prisoners with low literacy levels. Dragonlance In 1983 Weis applied for a job as a games editor at TSR, Inc. that she saw advertised in Publishers Weekly. TSR turned her down for that position, but hired her as a book editor. She worked in TSR's book division until 1986. One of her first assignments was to help coordinate, along with TSR colleague Tracy Hickman, \\"Project Overlord,\\" which was to include a novel and three AD&D; modules. Weis and Hickman plotted the novel and hired an author, who didn't work out. \\"By that time,\\" said Weis, \\"[Hickman] and I were so into the project that we felt we had to write it.\\" \\"Project Overlord\\" soon became known as Dragonlance and grew into a trilogy of novels, called the Dragonlance Chronicles, and 15 linked modules.Phillips, Casey (February 19, 2010). \\"QandA with Larry Elmore\\", Chattanooga Times Free Press. Distributed through McClatchy-Tribune News Service, February 19, 2010. Jean Black, managing editor of TSR's book department, picked Weis and Hickman to write the series. \\"To my mind,\\" said Weis, \\"what made the project so successful was that everyone was involved in it, excited about it, and believed in it.\\" Weis and Hickman also wrote the Dragonlance Legends trilogy, which was published in 1986. As a writing team they produced several projects based on the Dragonlance saga, which included novels, short stories, art books, and calendars in the product line. Post-TSR Weis and Hickman later left TSR, and wrote the Darksword trilogy (1986‚Äì87) and the seven-book Deathgate Cycle (1988‚Äì94) for Bantam Books. Weis also wrote the space opera Star of the Guardians novels, which she calls her favorite series that she has written. Weis was diagnosed with breast cancer, and recovered in 1993. She published a game based on Mag Force 7 from 1994‚Äì96, and married writer/game designer Don Perrin in 1996. Weis returned to Dragonlance in 1995 with Dragons of Summer Flame, written with Hickman, and her next project was a solo novel called The Soulforge, based on her favorite character from the trilogy, the dark wizard Raistlin. In 1998, she began working with Hickman on Sovereign Stone, a fantasy trilogy in a setting created by artist Larry Elmore, and published by Del Rey. Wizards of the Coast published a new trilogy of Dragonlance novels by Weis and Hickman called War of Souls, beginning with Dragons of a Fallen Sun (2000). Weis completed the third novel in the Dragonvarld trilogy for Tor, Master of Dragons. Her third novel in the Dark Disciple series, Amber and Blood, was released to stores on May 6, 2008. She finished work on the first novel in the Lost Chronicles series with co-author Tracy Hickman, entitled Dragons of the Dwarven Depths. This was released in July 2006. Lucca convention in October 2005. In 1999 Pyramid magazine named Weis one of The Millennium's Most Influential Persons \\"at least in the realm of adventure gaming,\\" and said she and Hickman are \\"basically responsible for the entire gaming fiction genre.\\" Weis was inducted into the Origins Hall of Fame in 2002, recognized in part for \\"one game line turned literary sensation: Dragonlance.\\" In the late 1990s, Larry Elmore approached Weis and Hickman to pitch his fantasy world of Loerem, which they agreed to write about in the Sovereign Stone trilogy of books. Weis formed the company Sovereign Press, with herself as CEO, to publish the Sovereign Stone roleplaying game written by Don Perrin and Lester Smith. To support the setting, Weis and Perrin wrote a short story called \\"Shadamehr and the Old Wives Tale\\" which appeared in Dragon #264 (October, 1999). In 2002 Wizards of the Coast agreed to license the Dragonlance setting to Sovereign Press for RPG publication; Weis and Perrin, along with Jamie Chambers and Christopher Coyle, wrote the Dragonlance Campaign Setting (2003) for publication by Wizards of the Coast, after which Sovereign Press was allowed to expand and supplement that book using the d20 license. In 2004, Perrin left Sovereign Press and Weis founded the new company Margaret Weis Productions. In addition to her writing career, Margaret serves as the owner and chief officer of two publishing companies, including Sovereign Press, Inc., a game publisher based in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. The company formerly owned the license to Larry Elmore's Sovereign Stone RPG world, hence the name of the company. It now produces the Dragonlance line of game products, licensed from Wizards of the Coast. Her newest company, Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd, publishes an RPG line based on several licenses including Serenity and Battlestar Galactica as well as Ed Greenwood's new solo venture into roleplaying, Castlemourn. Weis has served on the Board of Directors of Mag Force 7, Inc., the developer of the Star of the Guardians and Wing Commander Collectible Trading Card Game (CCGs). Personal life Despite her career and fame as a fantasy author, Weis says she does not read fantasy books. Weis is a mother of two from her first marriage. She is divorced from her second husband, Canadian-born author Don Perrin. She was diagnosed in 1993 with breast cancer and underwent successful chemotherapy. She kept herself busy writing The Seventh Gate during her treatment. Weis now lives in southern Wisconsin in a converted barn.

Historically part of Peeblesshire, the original village of Hawkshaw was destroyed when the Fruid Reservoir was constructed in 1963, and is remembered as the ancestral family home of the Porteous family, dating from at least 1439. A fortified tower stood on a hill overlooking the village for hundreds of years, although little remains of it now, its site being marked with a cairn built from stones from the original tower; this was probably one of a series of so-called Peel towers, small fortified keeps built along the Scottish Borders, intended as watch towers where signal fires could be lit to warn of approaching danger. A line of these towers was built in the 1430s across the Tweed valley from Berwick to its source (a few miles from Hawkshaw) as a response to the dangers of invasion from the English Borders. Hawkshaw was one of over two dozen of these in Peeblesshire alone. Roman artefacts have also been found in the vicinity, pre-dating the tower and indicating continuity of habitation in the area for some hundreds of years. The cairn plays host to a gathering of Porteous family members from all over the world every five years. The September 2005 gathering attracted seventy family members from five continents, and a short religious service was followed by the laying of a wreath at the cairn, in memory of all fallen Porteous servicemen and women.

Early life Sindermann was born in a traditional family in Dresden as the son of the Saxon Social Democratic politician Karl Sindermann. His older brother, Kurt Sindermann, also entered politics as a member of the Communist Party and sat on the Saxon state parliament from 1929 to 1933. Horst Sindermann joined the Communist Youth Federation (KJVD) in 1929 and in 1932 became a local functionary in Dresden. The group was banned by the Nazi regime and in June 1933, Sindermann was arrested and condemned to eight months of imprisonment for illegal political activities. In September 1934, he became political director of the KJVD's Dresden branch. In March 1935, he again was arrested for attempted high treason, tortured and put in solitary confinement for six years at Waldheim jail. In 1941, he was transferred to \\"protective custody\\" to several concentration camps, first at Sachsenhausen, then at Mauthausen in Upper Austria, and finally at Ebensee, until being freed by the arriving U.S. army in 1945. Career in East Germany After the war, Sindermann returned to Saxony and joined the KPD. After 1946 he was a member of the Socialist Unity Party (SED), created in April 1946 from the forced merger of Communists and Social Democrats in the Soviet Occupation Zone. Sindermann worked as a newspaper editor of the S√§chsische Volkszeitung at Dresden and the Volksstimme at Chemnitz from 1945 to 1947. He became First party secretary in the Landkreis of Chemnitz and Leipzig. He ran afoul of party co-chairman Otto Grotewohl, whom he criticised for being married to a former Nazi functionary, and in June 1949 was censured by the party's controlling commission and was demoted to the Freiheit paper in Halle, where he then became editor-in-chief from 1950 to 1953. Sindermann was director of agitation and propaganda in the Central Committee from 1954 to 1963. In 1958, he became a candidate and in 1963 a member of the Central Committee. In the same year, he also was appointed first party secretary in the district of Halle (until 1971) and was first elected into the Volkskammer. In 1967, he was admitted to the Politburo. In the East German leadership In 1971, he became Deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers‚Äîi. e., deputy prime minister of East Germany. Two years later, he became its chairman, or prime minister, when the previous occupant, Willi Stoph, succeeded the deceased Walter Ulbricht as Chairman of the State Council. His rise was cut short in October 1976, as party leader Erich Honecker deemed his economic views too liberal. Stoph returned to the premiership, while Sindermann was demoted to the posts of President of the Volkskammer and deputy chairman of the State Council. He was the only Communist to preside over the Volkshammer; the SED had previously reserved the post of parliament chairman for a top member of a block party to keep up the appearance that East Germany was governed by a broad-based coalition. Although he nominally held the third-highest state office in East Germany (behind Prime Minister Stoph and State Council chairman Honecker), he was left with little political influence. Resignation and final years Sindermann remained in these positions until the peaceful revolution, during which he resigned from all offices in November 1989. In a desperate attempt to change its image, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the renamed SED, expelled him in December. In January he was arrested but eventually released on health concerns, without charges being filed. He died in 1990 in Berlin. Family His stepson was the actor Peter Sindermann.

Revising the earlier work of Marco Mastrofini, or an even earlier proposal by \\"Hirossa Ap-Iccim\\" (Hugh Jones), Comte developed a solar calendar with 13 months of 28 days, and an additional festival day commemorating the dead, totalling 365 days. This extra day added to the last month was outside the days of the week cycle, and so the first of a month was always a Monday. On leap years, an additional festival day (also outside the week cycle), to celebrate holy women, would join the memorial day of the dead. The scheme followed the Gregorian calendar rules for determining which years are leap years, and started on January 1. Year 1 \\"of the Great Crisis\\" (i.e. the French Revolution) was equivalent to 1789 in the standard Gregorian system. Much like Comte's other schemas, the positivist calendar never enjoyed widespread use.  Months  The months were named, in chronological historical order, for great figures in Western European history in the fields of science, religion, philosophy, industry and literature. Each day of the year was named after neither Catholic Saints as in the Gregorian calendar nor after √éle-de-France agriculture as in the French Republican calendar but after figures in history in various fields. Weeks and days were also dedicated to great figures in history as a secular version of the concept of saint's days. In all, the Positivist Calendar \\"contains the names of 558 great men of all periods, classified according to their field of activity.\\" Villains of history were also commemorated in order to be held up for \\"perpetual execration\\". Napoleon, according to Comte, was especially deserving of this fate. Months were named: #Moses #Homer #Aristotle #Archimedes #Caesar #Saint Paul #Charlemagne #Dante #Gutenberg #Shakespeare #Descartes #Frederick #Bichat  Criticism  In 1849, Comte wrote that he called his calendar a \\"breach of continuity\\" with the old way of thinking, and his Humanistic calendar was part of that breach. He called it, \\"a provisional institution, destined for the present exceptional century to serve as an introduction to the abstract worship of Humanity.\\" Aside from the religious references the calendar carried, Duncan Steel, author of Marking Time, believes the novelty of the calendar's month names alone helped prevent the wide acceptance of this proposal. Author Tricia Lootens writes that the idea of naming days after literary figures, as if they were Catholic Saint days, didn't catch on outside the Positivist movement.  Advantages  The several advantages of the Positivist calendar are mainly related to its organization. The subdivision of the year is very regular and systematic: * Every year has exactly 52 weeks divided in 13 months. * Each month has exactly 28 days divided in 4 weeks. * Every day of the month falls on the same weekday in each month (i.e. the 17th always falls on a Wednesday). The calendar is the same every year (perennial), unlike the annual Gregorian calendar, which differs from year to year. Hence, scheduling is easier for institutions and industries with extended production cycles. Movable holidays celebrated on the nth certain weekday of a month, such as U.S. Thanksgiving day, would be able to have a fixed date while keeping their traditional weekday. Statistical comparisons by months are more accurate, since all months contain exactly the same number of business days and weekends, likewise for comparisons by 13-week quarters. Supporters of the Positivist calendar have argued that thirteen equal divisions of the year are superior to twelve unequal divisions in terms of monthly cash flow in the economy.  Disadvantages  While each quarter would be equal in length (13 weeks), thirteen is a prime number, placing all activities currently done on a quarterly basis out of alignment with the months. Christian, Islamic and Jewish leaders are historically opposed to the calendar, as their tradition of worshiping every seventh day would result in either the day of the week of worship changing from year to year, or eight days passing when \\"The Festival of All the Dead‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Festival of Holy Women\\" occurs. Birthdays, significant anniversaries, and other holidays would need to be recalculated as a result of a calendar reform, and would always be on the same day of the week. This could be problematic for Public holidays that would fall under non- working days under the new system; eg. If a public holiday is celebrated on January 8, under the Positivist calendar that holiday would always fall on a Sunday, Moses 8, which is already a non-working day, and compensatory leave would have to be given each year on Moses 9, thus essentially changing the date of the holiday to Moses 9. A vast amount of administrative data, and the software that manages that, would have to be corrected/adjusted for the new system, potentially having to support both the IFC and the standard local time keeping systems for a period of time.

It led to an extreme sport named extreme pogo or \\"Xpogo\\". It consists of a pole with a handle at the top and footrests near the bottom, and a spring located somewhere along the pole. The spring joins two sections of the pole, which extends below the footpads. The jumper places their feet on the footpads while balancing on the pole, then jumps up or down with a bending action of the knees to add or subtract energy in the spring. When the spring is at full compression or extension, the jumper is lifted by the recoil of the spring, being launched several inches or feet into the air. This process is repeated to maintain a periodic bounce. The pogo stick can be steered by shifting one's weight off the centerline of the spring in the desired horizontal direction thus producing horizontal locomotion. Inventors A spring stilt utilizing compression springs on each foot was patented in 1891 by George H. Herrington of Wichita, Kansas, \\"for leaping great distances and heights\\". This was an antecedent of the pogo stick as well as today's spring stilts. The modern pogo stick was invented by Max Pohlig and Ernst Gottschall, from Germany. A German patent was registered in Hanover on March 1920 for a device they called a \\"spring end hopping stilt\\". It is thought that the beginning two letters in these men's last names is where the word \\"pogo\\" comes from. The two-handle pogo stick design was patented by George B. Hansburg in 1957. Hansburg described the origins of the Pogo name colloquially in a story of a young Burmese girl with the aforementioned name whose father had created a crude version of the device so that the daughter could travel to the local temple for prayers.Goodson, M. & Todman, B. (Producers). (1959). What's My Line [Television series]. Manhattan, New York City: CBS Broadcast Center. youtube.com. Retrieved 2011-01-19. An earlier design with a single upright vertical handle patented in 1955 posed something of a risk to the user's chin. Later improvements to the pogo stick have been made, including the Vurtego, Flybar, and the BowGo, which allow operators to jump much higher than with a simple coil spring pogo stick. Back flips and other tricks are now possible on some of these newer sticks, which has contributed to the growth of the new sport of Extreme Pogo (\\"Xpogo\\"). Whatever improvements or different types are made, the basic design idea of a person riding on a spring remains the same. Popularity A scene in the 1953 film The Wild One shows gang members playing on pogo sticks. The popularity of the pogo stick has fluctuated over the years, but rose to prominence in the 1970s due to a marketing scheme by Irish/Italian immigrant Ryne Recchia, which promoted the pogo stick's unique design and versatility. There have been shows performed with pogo sticks, marriages performed on them, jumping contests held, and world records set and reset numerous times (which currently stands at 20 hours and 13 minutes). In the early 1990s, the pogo stick featured prominently in the PC gaming franchise, 'Commander Keen', in which the side-scrolling action is uniquely enhanced by the titular character's abilities on the pogo stick. Telly Monster also used the pogo stick in Sesame Street. In 2012, the pogo stick was gaining in popularity through the invention of extreme pogo sticks and the emerging sport of Xpogo. Xpogo No-Handed Backflips on extreme pogo sticks in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Animation of how a pogo stick moves. Extreme Pogo, or Xpogo, is an action sport which involves riding and performing tricks on extreme pogo sticks, defined as such by their durability and potential for height. Today's Xpogo sticks have the potential for over 10 ft. of height (measured from the ground to the bottom of the tip). Extreme pogo is a relatively new extreme sport and is currently emerging into popular culture as evidenced by the growing number of Xpogo athletes around the globe, growing sales from extreme pogo companies, the popularity of Xpogo athlete exhibition teams, positive feedback and continued interest in Xpogo content on sites such as YouTube, and the expanding scope of the annual World Championships of Xpogo, Pogopalooza.

The screenplay by James Warner Bellah and Willis Goldbeck was adapted from a 1953 short story written by Dorothy M. Johnson. In 2007, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Plot summary Senator Ranse Stoddard and his wife Hallie arrive in Shinbone, a frontier town in an unnamed western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon. As they pay their respects, local newspaper editor Maxwell Scott asks Stoddard why a United States senator would make the long journey from Washington to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years. Upon entering the territory as a young attorney, Ranse is beaten and robbed by Liberty Valance and his gang. Tom Doniphon finds Ranse and takes him to Shinbone. Ranse's wounds are treated by Tom's girlfriend, Hallie, and others, who explain to him that Valance terrorizes the residents, and the town's Marshal Appleyard is powerless to stop him. Tom is the only man who stands up to Valance, stating that force is all Valance understands. Ranse is determined that law and justice can prevail over Valance; however, Ranse begins practicing with a gun. Hallie, attracted to Ranse and concerned for his safety, tells Tom of Ranse's gun practice. Tom advises Ranse of Valance's trickery. Tom also makes sure Ranse understands Hallie is Tom's girl by showing renovations to his ranch house are intended for his marriage to her. Shinbone's men meet to elect two delegates to the statehood convention at the territorial capital. Ranse and Dutton Peabody, the local newspaper editor, are elected, despite Valance and his gang's attempt to bully the residents into nominating him in order to represent the cattle barons. Valance challenges Ranse to a gunfight to be held later in the evening. Tom offers to assist Ranse in leaving town, but Ranse stubbornly declines. Valance and his gang vandalize Peabody's newspaper office and beat him nearly to death after Peabody ran a story about Valance's prior murder of some farmers. At a saloon, Valance learns Ranse is waiting for him outside. Valance toys with Ranse, shooting him in the arm, and then aims to kill him, when Ranse fires his gun and Valance drops dead. Ranse returns to Hallie to treat his arm. Tom sees how much the two care for each other, and he retreats to his farm in a drunken rage where he burns down his house. At the statehood convention, Ranse decides to withdraw his name for territorial delegate for statehood, concluding he is not worthy after killing Valance. In an inception flashback, Tom tells Ranse it was he, Tom, who fired the fatal shot killing Valance, not Ranse. Tom regrets saving Ranse's life, because he lost Hallie to him; but, he encourages Ranse to accept the nomination and make Hallie proud. In the present, Stoddard's political accomplishments fill in the intervening years; but his story will not be published, with editor Scott stating, \\"This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\\" As Stoddard returns to Washington, D.C. with Hallie, and contemplates retiring to Shinbone, he thanks the train conductor for the railroad's many courtesies. The conductor replies, \\"Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance.\\" Stoddard blows out the match for his unlit pipe, and stares downward.

Multiple stories and speculations exist to explain this decision. Ford claimed to prefer that medium over color: \\"In black and white, you've got to be very careful. You've got to know your job, lay your shadows in properly, get your perspective right, but in color, there it is,\\" he said. \\"You might say I'm old fashioned, but black and white is real photography.\\" Ford also reportedly argued that the climactic shoot-out between Valance and Stoddard would not have worked in color. Others have interpreted the absence of the magnificent outdoor vistas so prevalent in earlier Ford Westerns as \\"a fundamental reimagining [by Ford] of his mythic West\\" ‚Äì a grittier, less romantic, more realistic portrayal of frontier life. A more pragmatic interpretation cites the fact that Wayne and Stewart, two of Hollywood's biggest stars working together for the first time, were considerably older (54 and 53, respectively) than the characters they were playing. Filming in black and white helped ease the suspension of disbelief necessary to accept that disparity. According to cinematographer William H. Clothier, however, \\"There was one reason and one reason only ... Paramount was cutting costs. Otherwise we would have been in Monument Valley or Brackettville and we would have had color stock. Ford had to accept those terms or not make the film.\\" Another condition imposed by the studio, according to Van Cleef, was that Wayne be cast as Doniphon. Ford resented the studio's intrusion and retaliated by taunting Wayne relentlessly throughout the filming. \\"He didn't want Duke [Wayne] to think he was doing him any favors,\\" Van Cleef said. Strode recounted that Ford \\"kept needling Duke about his failure to make it as a football player\\", comparing him to Strode (a former NFL running back), whom he pronounced \\"a real football player\\". (Wayne's football career at USC had been curtailed by injuries.) He also ridiculed Wayne for failing to enlist during World War II, during which Ford filmed a series of widely praised combat documentaries for the Office of Strategic Services and was wounded at the Battle of Midway, and Stewart served with distinction as a bomber pilot and commanded a bomber group. \\"How rich did you get while Jimmy was risking his life?\\" he demanded. Wayne's avoidance of wartime service was a major source of guilt for him in his later years. Stewart related that midway through filming, Wayne asked him why he, Stewart, never seemed to be the target of Ford's venomous remarks. Other cast- and crew-members also noticed Stewart's apparent immunity from Ford's abuse. Then, toward the end of filming, Ford asked Stewart what he thought of Strode's costume for the film's beginning and end, when the actors were playing their parts 25 years older. Stewart replied, \\"It looks a bit Uncle Remussy to me.\\" Ford responded, \\"What's wrong with Uncle Remus?\\" He called for the crew's attention and announced, \\"One of our players doesn't like Woody's costume. Now, I don't know if Mr. Stewart has a prejudice against Negroes, but I just wanted you all to know about it.\\" Stewart said he \\"wanted to crawl into a mouse hole\\", but Wayne told him, \\"Well, welcome to the club. I'm glad you made it.\\" Ford's behavior \\"...really pissed Wayne off,\\" Strode said, \\"but he would never take it out on Ford,\\" the man largely responsible for his rise to stardom. \\"He ended up taking it out on me.\\" While filming an exterior shot on a horse-drawn cart, Wayne almost lost control of the horses and knocked Strode away when he attempted to help. When the horses did stop, Wayne tried to pick a fight with the younger and fitter Strode. Ford called out, \\"Don't hit him, Woody, we need him.\\" Wayne later told Strode, \\"We gotta work together. We both gotta be professionals.\\" Strode blamed Ford for nearly all the friction on the set. \\"What a miserable film to make,\\" he added. Stewart received top billing over Wayne on promotional posters, but in the film itself Wayne's screen card appears first and slightly higher on a sign post. The studio also specified that Wayne's name appear before Stewart's on theatre marquees, reportedly at Ford's request. \\"Wayne actually played the lead,\\" Ford said, to Peter Bogdanovich. \\"Jimmy Stewart had most of the sides [sequences with dialogue], but Wayne was the central character, the motivation for the whole thing.\\" Parts of the film were shot in Wildwood Regional Park in Thousand Oaks, California. Music The film's music score was composed by Cyril J. Mockridge, but in scenes involving Hallie's relationships with Doniphon and Stoddard, Ford reprised Alfred Newman's \\"Ann Rutledge Theme\\", from Young Mr. Lincoln. He told Bogdanovich that he used the theme in both films to evoke repressed desire and lost love. The film scholar Kathryn Kalinak notes that Ann Rutledge's theme \\"encodes longing\\" and \\"fleshes out the failed love affair between Hallie and Tom Doniphon, the growing love between Hallie and Ranse Stoddard, and the traumatic loss experienced by Hallie over her choice of one over the other, none of which is clearly articulated by dialogue.\\". Portions of the song There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight are played in scenes by bar musicians and a marching band. The Burt Bacharach-Hal David song \\"(The Man Who Shot) Liberty Valance\\" became a top-10 hit for Gene Pitney. Though based upon the movie's plotline, it was not used in the film. Pitney said in an interview that he was in the studio about to record the song when \\"... Bacharach informed us that the film just came out.\\" The film was released April 18, 1962, and the song entered the Billboard Hot 100 the week ending April 28, 1962, peaking at number four in June. Jimmie Rodgers also recorded the song, in the Gene Pitney style. James Taylor covered it on his 1985 album That's Why I'm Here, as did The Royal Guardsmen on their 1967 album Snoopy vs. the Red Baron. It was also covered by the Australian rock band Regurgitator on its 1998 David/Bacharach tribute album To Hal and Bacharach. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the top 100 Western songs of all time. Reception Liberty Valance was released in April 1962, and achieved both financial and critical success. Produced for $3.2 million, it grossed $8 million, making it the 15th-highest grossing film of 1962. Edith Head's costumes were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Costume Design (black- and-white), one of the few Westerns ever nominated in that category. Contemporary reviews were generally positive, although a number of critics thought the final act was a letdown. Variety called the film \\"entertaining and emotionally involving,\\" but thought if the film had ended 20 minutes earlier, \\"it would have been a taut, cumulative study of the irony of heroic destiny,\\" instead of concluding with \\"condescending, melodramatic, anticlimactic strokes. What should have been left to enthrall the imagination is spelled out until there is nothing left to savor or discuss.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin agreed, lamenting that the \\"final anticlimactic 20 minutes ... all but destroy the value of the disarming simplicity and natural warmth which are Ford's everlasting stock-in-trade.\\" Despite this, the review maintained that the film \\"has more than enough gusto to see it through,\\" and that Ford had \\"lost none of his talent for catching the real heart, humor and violent flavor of the Old West in spite of the notable rustiness of his technique.\\" A. H. Weiler of The New York Times wrote that \\"Mr. Ford, who has struck more gold in the West than any other film-maker, also has mined a rich vein here,\\" but opined that the film \\"bogs down\\" once Stoddard becomes famous, en route to \\"an obvious, overlong, and garrulous anticlimax.\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post called the film \\"a leisurely yarn boasting fine performances,\\" but was bothered by \\"the incredulous fact that the lively townsfolk of Shinbone didn't polish off Valence [sic] for themselves. On TV he would have been dispatched by the second commercial and the villainy would have passed to some shadowy employer, some ruthless rancher who didn't want statehood.\\" John L. Scott of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Director Ford is guilty of a few lengthy, slow periods in his story-telling, but for the most part the old, reliable Ford touches are there.\\" Harrison's Reports gave the film a grade of \\"Very Good\\", but Brendan Gill of The New Yorker was negative and called it \\"a parody of Mr. Ford's best work.\\" More recent assessments have been more uniformly positive. The film is considered one of Ford's best, and in one poll, ranked with The Searchers and The Shootist as one of Wayne's best Westerns. Roger Ebert wrote that each of the 10 Ford/Wayne westerns is \\"... complete and self-contained in a way that approaches perfection\\", and singled out Liberty Valance as \\"the most pensive and thoughtful\\" of the group. Director Sergio Leone (Once Upon a Time in the West, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) listed Ford as a major influence on his work, and Liberty Valance as his favorite Ford film. \\"It was the only film,\\" he said, \\"where [Ford] learned about something called pessimism.\\" In a retrospective analysis, The New York Times called Liberty Valance \\"...one of the great Western classics,\\" because \\"it questions the role of myth in forging the legends of the West, while setting this theme in the elegiac atmosphere of the West itself, set off by the aging Stewart and Wayne.\\" The New Yorker's Richard Brody described it as \\"the greatest American political movie\\", because of its depictions of a free press, town meetings, statehood debates, and the \\"civilizing influence\\" of education in frontier America.

The university is the oldest school of higher education in Ethiopia. AAU has thirteen campuses. Twelve of these are situated in Addis Ababa, and one is located in Bishoftu, about away. AAU has several associated research institutions including the Institute of Ethiopian Studies. The Ministry of Education admits qualified students to AAU based on their score on the Ethiopian University Entrance Examination (EUEE). History Front entrance of Addis Ababa University. The origins of AAU was a two-year college in 1950 by the Jesuit Lucien Matte, at the appeal of His Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie I. It began operations the following year. Over the following two years an affiliation with the University of London was developed. The nucleus of AAU was formed with the establishment of the University College of Addis Ababa (UCAA) in 1950. UCAA, which initially consisted of the Faculties of Arts and Science, became a fully fledged college when it was chartered in 1954. In 1955, the Building College was opened. In February 1961, these various colleges and the Theological College were brought together to form the Haile Selassie University. Emperor Haile Selassie I gave his Guenete Leul Palace to serve as the administration building and main campus. He had abandoned the palace, where a number of his ministers and favorites were killed in the wake of the abortive Coup d'√©tat in 1960, in favor of the new Jubilee Palace. Following the 1974 revolution, the university was briefly renamed University of Ethiopia (National University) before it came to assume its present designation, AAU, in 1975. In the wake of the revolution, AAU was closed for two years and students and staff were drafted into what was known as the Development through Cooperation Campaign (zemecha), designed to arise the awareness of the rural population in the spirit of the revolution. The university offered its first Master's programs in 1979 and its first PhD programs in 1987.  Administration  Until 1974 the charter provided for a governance structure in the following descending order or authority: Chancellor (the Emperor himself); the Board of Governors, composed of ministers and members of the royal family; and the Faculty Council, made up of the university officers, deans, directors and elected members. The Faculty later became the Senate. In 1977, the AAU lost its relative autonomy when it was brought under the Commission for Higher Education, which came to exercise administrative jurisdiction over all institutions of higher learning. In 1993, AAU was placed under the Ministry of Education by a government proclamation. Emperor Haile Selassie (center) and French Canadian Jesuit, Fr. Lucien Matte, SJ (right) at the university, 1951 Influence Over and above their academic pursuits, AAU students have been actively engaged in community service (such as conducting literacy programs) and political struggle, particularly in the years before the 1974 revolution. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, students were required to do a year of national service under the Ethiopia University Service program. University teachers and students were instrumental in exposing the hidden 1973 famine and launching the first famine relief program. The Ethiopian Student Movement, of which the University was the birthplace and main venue, played a pivotal role in bringing about the revolution. Almost all leaders of the political organizations that were active in the revolutionary years or are in power now had their political formation inside the University. In 2013/2014, there were 33,940 undergraduate students, 13,000 graduate students, and 1,733 PhD students, making a total student body of 48,673.

Its drainage basin covers . Among its tributaries are Silver Creek, Butte Creek, Abiqua Creek, and the Little Pudding River. Historically, the Pudding River flowed directly into the Willamette River, and aerial photos dating back to 1936 provide evidence of the Willamette River's confluence with the Pudding River main stem channel. Currently, it flows directly into the Molalla River near River Mile 1 before joining the Willamette River. Anadromous and resident salmonids use the Lower Pudding River main stem and key tributaries that support the basin's ecosystems. Geology About 24 million years ago at the end of the Oligocene, Oregon had started to look how it is today and the Willamette Bay finally became the Willamette Valley by drying up and being raised above sea level, after assuming a shape much like today's Puget Sound. Course The Pudding River Basin's complex of headwater creeks originates from the western edge of the Cascade Mountains along a snowpack-limited rigdeline (i.e. no glaciers are present) that forms a critical linkage from the Mount Hood National Forest and Table Rock Wilderness to Silver Falls State Park and the rolling Waldo Hills east of Salem. Peak ridgeline elevations vary from . After emerging from the Cascade Mountain foothills of the Panther Rock Ridge and its unique forested upper-elevation wetlands and lakes, the key tributaries of the watershed like ecologically- important Butte Creek converge near Woodburn into the meandering Pudding River. Passing through and within the Pudding River Valley, the numerous subwatersheds of the Pudding Basin represent a vital part of fertile agricultural lands of the Lower Willamette Valley sub-basin. Two forks of the Pudding join between the cities of Silverton and Mt. Angel, at , as the river continues its course northward where it receives Abiqua Creek from the right at about northwest of Silverton. North of Mt. Angel, Butte Creek, which comes down from the Cascade Range foothills past Scotts Mills, empties into the Pudding River at . The river continues northward past the town of Aurora. For most of its course, Butte Creek and the Lower Pudding River mainstem defines the boundary between Marion and Clackamas Counties. The Pudding River flows into the Molalla River, at , just before the Molalla joins the Willamette River in a floodplain that is part of the Molalla River State Park. Fishing The upper river offers catch-and-release fishing for wild trout, while the lower river has bass and panfish. Although the Pudding River is not stocked with hatchery fish, coastal cutthroat trout and rainbow trout enter the upper main stem from Drift, Butte, Silver, and Abiqua creeks. Fishing is restricted to artificial flies and lures and is not allowed for winter-run steelhead (anadromous rainbow trout) that spawn in the tributaries. The extreme lower reaches of the river are navigable by boat when the stream flow is sufficient, sometimes as late as June.

The question of a posteriori knowledge might be formulated as: can Adam or Eve know what water feels like on their skin prior to touching it for the first time? Religion Zen emphasises the importance of the experiential element in religious experience,Dadid K. Reynolds, The Quiet Therapies (1982) p. 95 as opposed to what it sees as the trap of conceptualization:C. Cheng-Chi, The Practice of Zen (1951) p. 71 as D. T. Suzuki put it, \\"fire. Mere talking of it will not make the mouth burn\\".Quoted in Reynolds, p. 95 Experiential knowledge has also been used in the philosophy of religion as an argument against God's omniscience, questioning whether God could genuinely know everything, since he (supposedly) cannot know what it is like to sin.experiential knowledge Commenting on the distinction between experiential knowledge and propositional knowledge, analytic philosopher and theologian William Lane Craig has stated in an interview with Robert Lawrence Kuhn for the PBS series Closer to Truth that because experiential knowledge is appropriate to the mind which does the knowing, in order for omniscience to be a cognitive perfection God's omniscience must entail God know only and all propositional truths and have only appropriate experiential knowledge. Ecology Writer Barry Lopez writes about experiential knowledge and how it relates back to the environment,Barry Lopez, Arctic Dreams (1999) arguing that without experiencing nature, one cannot fully \\"know\\" and understand the relationships within ecosystems. Therapy Carl Rogers stressed the importance of experiential knowledge both for the therapist formulating his or her theories, and for the client in therapyCarl Rogers, On Becoming a Person (1961) p. 184 and p. 103 ‚Äì both things with which most counsellors would agree.Burnard, p. 64-5 and p. 78 As defined by Thomasina Borkman (Emeritus Professor of Sociology, George Mason University) experiential knowledge is the cornerstone of therapy in self-help groups,K. Humphries, Circles of Recovery (2003) p. 15 as opposed to both lay (general) and professional knowledge. Sharing in such groups is the narration of significant life experiences in a process through which the knowledge derived thereof is validated by the group and transformed into a corpus that becomes their fundamental resource and product. Neville Symington has argued that one of the central features of the narcissist is a shying away from experiential knowledge, in favour of adopting wholesale a ready-made way of living drawn from other people's experience.N. Symington, Narcissism (1993) p. 88 Culture Helen Vendler has characterised Seamus Heaney's art as, in one respect, recording an experiential learning curve: \\"we are earthworms of the earth, and all that / has gone through us is what will be our trace\\".Heaney, quoted in H.

(2009). A case for private freewriting in the classroom. In Vilardi, Teresa; Mary Change (Eds.), Writing-based teaching: Essential practices and enduring questions; Albany, NY: State University of New York Press (pp. 7‚Äì24). While free writing often produces raw, or even unusable material, it can help writers overcome writing blocks and build confidence by allowing them to practice text-production phases of the writing process without fear of censure.Collins, Vicki Tolar. (2000). Freewriting in the middle: Self-help for college writers across the curriculum. In Smith, Jane Bowman; Kathleen Blake Yancey (eds.), Self-assessment and development in writing: A collaborative inquiry; Cresskill, NJ: Hampton Press (pp. 105‚Äì124)Song, Minjong. (1998). Experimental study of the effect of controlled vs. free writing and different feedback types on writing quality and writing apprehension of EFL college students. ERIC Document Reproduction Service, ED 423 703. Some writers even use the technique to collect initial thoughts and ideas on a topic, often as a preliminary to formal writing. Free writing is not the same as automatic writing. Unlike brainstorming where ideas are simply listed, in freewriting one writes sentences to form a paragraph about whatever comes to mind. History Dorothea Brande was an early proponent of freewriting. In her book Becoming a Writer (1934), she advises readers to sit and write for 30 minutes every morning, as fast as they can. Peter Elbow advanced freewriting in his book Writing Without Teachers (1973), and it has been popularized by Julia Cameron through her book The Artist's Way (1992). Technique The technique involves continuous writing, usually for a predetermined period of time (often five to fifteen minutes). The writer writes without regard to spelling, grammar, etc., and makes no corrections. If the writer reaches a point where they can't think of anything to write, it is presumed they will write that they can't think of anything or repeat words, until they find another line of thought. The writer freely strays off topic, letting thoughts lead where they may. At times, a writer may also do a focused freewrite, letting a chosen topic structure their thoughts. Expanding from this topic, the thoughts may stray to make connections and create more abstract views on the topic. This technique helps a writer explore a particular subject before putting ideas into a more basic context. Freewriting is often done on a daily basis as a part of the writer's daily routine. Also, students in many writing courses are assigned to do such daily writing exercises. The writing does not have to be done with pen and paper. A technique known as Freeblogging combines blogging with free-writing with the rules changed so that the writer does not stop typing for long periods of time. The end result may or may not be shared with the public. Definition Free writing is based on a presumption that, while everybody has something to say and the ability to say it, the mental wellspring may be blocked by apathy, self-criticism, resentment, anxiety about deadlines, fear of failure or censure, or other forms of resistance. The accepted rules of free-writing enable a writer to build up enough momentum to blast past blocks into uninhibited flow, the concept outlined by writing teachers such as Louise Dunlap, Peter Elbow, and Natalie Goldberg. Free- writing is all about loosening and limbering the thought process, not about a product or a performance for a student or a writer. Use in education Often free-writing workshops focus on self-expression, and are sometimes even used in teaching to elementary school children. There is no common consensus on the acceptance of this technique, often referred as Natalie Goldberg's first four rules of writing: *Give yourself a time limit. Write for one or ten or twenty minutes, and then stop. *Keep your hand moving until the time is up. Do not pause to stare into space or to read what you've written. Write quickly but not in a hurry. *Pay no attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, neatness, or style. Nobody else needs to read what you produce here. The correctness and quality of what you write do not matter; the act of writing does. *If you get off the topic or run out of ideas, keep writing anyway. If necessary, write nonsense or whatever comes into your head, or simply scribble: anything to keep the hand moving. *If you feel bored or uncomfortable as you're writing, ask yourself what's bothering you and write about that. *When the time is up, look over what you've written, and mark passages that contain ideas or phrases that might be worth keeping or elaborating on in a subsequent free-writing session. Goldberg's rules appear to be based on those developed by Jack Kerouac, whom she cites several times. Kerouac developed 30 \\"rules\\" in his Belief & Technique for Modern Prose. While Kerouac's \\"rules\\" are elliptical and even cryptic for beginning writers, they are more comprehensive than Goldberg's for those who have practised prose writing for some time. Kerouac supplemented these with his Essentials of Spontaneous Prose, and together they form the basis of his prose writing method, a form of narrative stream of consciousness. Kerouac himself cites the \\"trance writing\\" of William Butler Yeats as a precursor of his own practice. Goldberg's rules, which are infused with the study and practice of Zen Buddhism, make the process of free writing more accessible for a beginner and are perhaps less extreme than those of Kerouac, although they are still tinged with an element of mysticism.

The first creation, in tandem with the creation of the title of Earl of Norfolk, came before 1069 in favour of Ralph the Staller; but the title was forfeited by his heir, Ralph de Guader, in 1074. The second creation came in 1337 in favour of Robert de Ufford; the title became extinct on the death of his son, the second Earl, in 1382. The third creation came in 1385 in favour of Michael de la Pole. (For more information on this creation, see the Duke of Suffolk (1448 creation).) The fourth creation came in 1603. Lord Thomas Howard was the second son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, by his second marriage to Margaret, daughter and heiress of the Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden. Howard was a prominent naval commander and politician and served as Earl Marshal, as Lord Chamberlain of the Household and as Lord High Treasurer. In 1597 he was summoned to Parliament as Baron Howard de Walden, and in 1603 he was further honoured when he was created Earl of Suffolk. His second son the Hon. Thomas Howard was created Earl of Berkshire in 1626. Lord Suffolk was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He had already in 1610 been summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Howard de Walden. He later served as Captain of the Honourable Band of Gentlemen Pensioners and as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the third Earl. He was Lord-Lieutenant of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Lord Suffolk had no sons and on his death in 1689 the barony of Howard de Walden fell into abeyance between his daughters (see the Baron Howard de Walden for later history of this title). He was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He was childless and on his death the title passed to his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Earl. He was a politician and served as First Lord of Trade. In 1706, three years before he succeeded his father, he was raised to the Peerage of England in his own right as Baron Chesterford, in the County of Essex, and Earl of Bindon, in the County of Dorset. His son, the seventh Earl, was Lord-Lieutenant of Essex and is also remembered as the owner of the slave Scipio Africanus. The Earl was childless and on his early death in 1722, the barony of Chesterford and earldom of Bindon became extinct. He was succeeded in the earldom of Suffolk by his uncle, the eighth Earl. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the ninth Earl. His wife Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk, was a mistress of King George II. On Lord Suffolk's death the titles passed to his son, the tenth Earl. He represented Bere Alston in the House of Commons. He was childless and on his death the line of the eldest son of the first Earl failed. The earldom was inherited by the late Earl's third cousin, the fourth Earl of Berkshire, who became the 11th Earl of Suffolk as well (see the Earl of Berkshire for earlier history of this branch of the family). He was succeeded by his grandson, the twelfth Earl (the son of William Howard, Viscount Andover). He was a politician and served as Lord Privy Seal and as Secretary of State for the Northern Department. On his death the titles passed to his posthumous son, the 13th Earl. He died as an infant and was succeeded by his great-uncle, the 14th Earl. He was the third son of the 11th Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Castle Rising, Malmesbury and St Michael's. On his death in 1783, the line of the fourth son of the first Earl of Berkshire failed. The late Earl was succeeded by his third cousin, the 15th Earl. He was the great-grandson of Colonel the Hon. Philip Howard, seventh son of the first Earl of Berkshire. Lord Suffolk and Berkshire was a General in the Army. On his death the titles passed to his son, the 16th Earl. He represented Arundel in the House of Commons. His son, the 17th Earl, sat as Whig Member of Parliament for Malmesbury. When he died the titles passed to his son, the 18th Earl. He represented Malmesbury in Parliament as a Liberal. He was succeeded by his son, the 19th Earl. He was killed in action in the First World War. His eldest son, the 20th Earl, was a bomb disposal expert. He was killed in 1941 while trying to defuse an unexploded bomb and was posthumously awarded the George Cross. Since 1941, the titles are held by his eldest son, the 21st Earl, who as a young boy succeeded on his father's death. Several other members of this branch of the Howard family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Edward Howard, younger son of the first Earl of Suffolk, was created Baron Howard of Escrick in 1628. The Hon. Henry Thomas Howard, second son of the 16th Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Cricklade. The Hon. James Howard, fourth son of the 16th Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Malmesbury.

Note: This includes See also: The current structure is a 1933 reconstruction, using some original materials, of the Vechte‚ÄìCortelyou House, which was destroyed in 1897. The original house was an important part of the 1776 Battle of Long Island during the American Revolutionary War. At one time, the Old Stone House was the clubhouse of the Brooklyn Superbas, who later became the Brooklyn Dodgers. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. First house Sketch of the Vechte House, made in 1850 by Benson J. Lossing The current Old Stone House is a replica, using some unearthed original materials, of a Dutch stone farmhouse originally built adjacent to the current site by the Dutch immigrant Claes Arentson Vechte, or his son Hendrick, in 1699. It is also known as the Vechte‚ÄìCortelyou House. The Vechte family farmed the lands around the house, harvested oysters in Gowanus Creek and ferried their produce down the creek to Gowanus Bay and then to lower Manhattan. The house was rented in 1766 by Isaac Cortelyou, but later returned to Vechte. It was then inherited in 1779 by Nicholas Cowenhoven, who sold it in 1790 to Jacques Cortelyou. Cortelyou's son, Peter, later received it as a wedding gift from his father., pp.25-26 Battle of Long Island On August 27, 1776, the house was an important location in the Battle of Long Island during the American Revolutionary War - the first major engagement of the Continental Army after the Declaration of Independence, and the largest battle of the entire war. On that day at 9:00 am, George Washington arrived from Manhattan.McCullough (2005), p.175 having been informed that the British were close to a breakthrough of American lines. Washington realized that he had been completely fooled by a deceptive feint by the British on Long Island and he ordered more troops to Brooklyn from Manhattan.McCullough (2005), p.176 On the American right, to the west, Colonial General Stirling still held the line against Grant. Stirling held on for four hours, still unaware of the British flanking maneuver to his east, and some of his own troops thought they were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. This was intentional by the British. At 11:00 am, however, British General Grant, reinforced by 2,000 Royal marines, hit Stirling's center and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians.Lengel (2005), p.145McCullough (2005), p.178 Stirling pulled back but British troops were, at this point, coming at him in his rear south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer' Millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, on the other side of which was Brooklyn Heights.McCullough (2005), p.177 = Maryland 400= Stirling ordered all of his troops, except a contingent of Maryland troops under the command of Major Mordecai Gist, to cross the creek. This group of Maryland troops became known to history as the Maryland 400, although they numbered about 260‚Äì270 men. Stirling and Gist led the troops in a rear-guard action against the overwhelming numbers of British troops which surpassed 2,000 troops supported by two cannon. Stirling and Gist led the Marylanders in two attacks against the British, who were in fixed positions in and in front of the Vechte‚ÄìCortelyou House (known today as Old Stone House). After the last assault the remaining troops retreated across the Gowanus Creek. Some of the men who tried to cross the marsh were bogged down in the mud under musket fire and others who could not swim were captured. Stirling was surrounded and, unwilling to surrender to the British, broke through the British lines to von Heister's Hessians and surrendered to them. 256 Maryland troops were killed in the assaults in front of the Old Stone House and fewer than a dozen made it back to the American lines.Lengel (2005), p.146 Washington, watching from a redoubt on nearby Cobble Hill, at the intersection of today's Court Street and Atlantic Avenue, was reported to have said, \\"Good God, what brave fellows I must this day lose!\\".Schecter, Barnet. The Battle for New York: The City at the Heart of the American Revolution. Walker & Company. New York. October 2002. The 256 dead troops of the Maryland 400 were buried by the British in a mass grave on a hillock on farmer Adrian Van Brunt's land on the outskirts of the marsh. It was from this battle that Maryland gained its nickname \\"The Old Line State\\". This mass grave is believed to be around the southwest corner of what is today 3rd Ave. between 7th and 8th Streets. After its capture, the house was used as an artillery position by an estimated 2,000 British and hired Hessian soldiers who fired on the Americans, who had already suffered disastrous losses and were fleeing from the east to the American forts across the Gowanus Creek to the west. Some four hundred soldiers of the Maryland Brigade under Colonel William Smallwood regained the house twice that day, but were finally repulsed by the British, with very heavy casualties.Burke, Jason. \\"Seeking Brooklyn‚Äôs Lost Mass Grave\\" The New York Times (August 25, 2012) Nicholas Vechte, grandson of Claes, lived in the Old Stone House during the American Revolutionary War under the British occupation. Upon his death in 1779, the farm he willed to his grandson, Nicholas R. Cowenhoven. In 1797, Cowenhoven sold the house to Jacques Cortelyou, who purchased it for the use of his newly married son, Peter. Peter's son Jacques inherited the house in 1815. His family was the last to live in the Old Stone House. After the death of his wife, Jacques Cortelyou sold the property to Edwin Litchfield, a railroad developer, in 1852. Litchfield lived in Litchfield Villa, now the Brooklyn headquarters of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Litchfield was the major landowner of the farmland in the area at that time and sold much of his land to the city for the creation of Prospect Park. Baseball clubhouse After the Litchfield purchase The Old Stone House remained standing another forty years and was occupied by a caretaker during that period. It also served as a club house for a winter skating team, and then for the professional baseball team called the Brooklyn Superbas, which would later be known as the Brooklyn Dodgers before their move to Ebbets Field. The Old Stone House sits on the site of the original Washington Park, and across Fourth Avenue from the second Washington Park, two of the oldest professional baseball stadiums in New York. The left-center field wall from the second Washington Park is still visible on Third Avenue between First and Third Streets.  Current house and museum The land that the house was on was purchased by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation in 1923 and the house, which had been razed and burned in 1897, was excavated in 1933. Half of the house was below street level when the level of Fourth Avenue had been graded up at the end of the nineteenth century. The house was reconstructed in 1934 for use as a rest room, using many of the original stones, though it was moved slightly from its original location. It underwent additional restoration in the 1970s and 1990s and was established as a memorial to the Battle of Long Island due to the efforts of members of the First Battle Revival Alliance. To honor the memory of the Maryland Continentals, the flag of Maryland flies from the house.https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs- xpm-1996-08-27-1996240113-story.html Today, the Old Stone House Historic Interpretive Center is operated by the Old Stone House of Brooklyn (OSH), a not-for-profit corporation, under license from the Parks Department.

On his return, Van Dyck painted him in oriental dress Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh. Earl of Denbigh (pronounced \\"Denby\\") is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1622 for the courtier and soldier William Feilding, 1st Viscount Feilding, named after Denbigh or Denbighshire. The earldom was one of the hereditary peerages whose entitlement to sit in the House of Lords was removed by the House of Lords Act 1999. The family seat is Newnham Paddox House, near Rugby, Warwickshire. The Feilding family The Feilding family have been Lords of Newnham Paddox in Monks Kirby, Warwickshire since 1433. Despite almost certainly being of Warwickshire origin, in the middle of the 17th century, following their elevation to the peerage, the Feilding family began to claim descent from the Habsburgs through the counts of Laufenburg and Rheinfelden. The claim, though widely accepted at one time, including by the historian Edward Gibbon, was also the subject of ridicule. It was comprehensively debunked at the start of the 20th century.See also image from British Library rightSatirical print of the arms of the Feilding family superimposed on the Habsburg double-headed eagle lacking one head, dedicated to the Garter King of Arms and mocking the family's pretensions at ancestral connections to the Habsburg dynasty. Creation of the title William Feilding was Master of the Great Wardrobe under King James I and also took part in the Expedition to C√°diz of 1625. Feilding had already been created Baron Feilding, of Newnham Paddox in the County of Warwick, and Viscount Feilding in 1620. These titles are also in the Peerage of England. William Feilding owed his elevation in court and to the peerage primarily to his marriage with Susan Villiers. The Villiers family were also minor Midlands gentry until Susan's brother, George Villiers, became the confidant and lover of King James I and was granted the dukedom of Buckingham. Earls of Denbigh Lord Denbigh was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. In contrast to his father he fought as a Parliamentarian in the Civil War. In 1664 he was created Baron St Liz in the Peerage of England, with remainder to the heirs male of his father. William's second son, the Hon. George Feilding, was created Earl of Desmond in 1628 (see below). He died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, William Feilding, 2nd Earl of Desmond, who now also became the third Earl of Denbigh (he also succeeded in the barony of St Liz by special remainder). His son, the fourth Earl, served as Lord-Lieutenant of Leicestershire and Denbighshire. His great-great-grandson, the seventh Earl (the titles having descended from father to son, with the exception of the seventh Earl who succeeded his grandfather), was a soldier and courtier. His grandson, the ninth Earl, served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1897 to 1905 in the Conservative administrations of Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour. the titles are held by his great-great-great- grandson, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1995 (the titles having descended from father to son, with the exception of the tenth Earl who succeeded his grandfather). Lord Denbigh is Grand Carver of England. The Hon. George Feilding, second son of the first Earl of Denbigh, was created Baron Fielding, of Lecaghe in the County of Tipperary, and Viscount Callan, of Callan in the County of Kilkenny, in 1622, and was made Earl of Desmond in 1628. All three titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl, who in 1675 succeeded his uncle as third Earl of Denbigh. See above for further history of the titles. Other members of the Feilding family The writer Henry Fielding (who spelled the family name differently) was the son of Edmund Feilding, the third son of John Feilding, the youngest son of the 3rd Earl. His sister Sarah Fielding was also a well- known author, and their half-brother (Edmund's son by a different wife) was John Fielding, the celebrated blind judge. Lady Elizabeth Feilding, daughter of the first Earl of Denbigh, was created Countess of Guilford for life in 1660. The Hon.

The title was first created in 1397 for Ralph Neville. It was forfeited in 1571 by Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland for leading the Rising of the North. It was revived in 1624 in favour of Sir Francis Fane, whose mother, Mary Neville, was a descendant of a younger son of the first Earl. The first Earl of the first creation had already become Baron Neville de Raby, and that was a subsidiary title for his successors. The current Earl holds the subsidiary title Baron Burghersh (1624). 1397 creation Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and his twelve children. Ralph Neville, 4th Baron Neville of Raby, and 1st earl of Westmorland (1364‚Äì1425), eldest son of John, 3rd Baron Neville, and his wife Maud Percy (see Neville, Family), was knighted by Thomas of Woodstock, afterwards duke of Gloucester, during the French expedition of 1380, and succeeded to his father's barony in 1388. He had been joint warden of the west march in 1386, and was reappointed for a new term in 1390. In 1391 he was put on the commission which undertook the duties of constable in place of the duke of Gloucester, and he was repeatedly engaged in negotiations with the Scots. His support of the court party against the lords appellant was rewarded in 1397 by the earldom of Westmorland. cite Westmorland married as his second wife Joan Beaufort, half-sister of Henry of Lancaster, afterwards Henry IV, whom he joined on his landing in Yorkshire in 1399. He already held the castles of Brancepeth, Raby, Middleham and Sheriff Hutton when he received from Henry IV the honour and lordship of Richmond for life. The only rivals of the Nevilles in the north were the Percies, whose power was broken at Shrewsbury in 1403. Both marches had been in their hands, but the wardenship of the west marches was now assigned to Westmorland, whose influence was also paramount in the east, which was under the nominal wardenship of the young Prince John, afterwards duke of Bedford. Westmorland had prevented Northumberland from marching to reinforce Hotspur in 1403, and before embarking on a new revolt he sought to secure his enemy, surrounding, but too late, one of Sir Ralph Eure's castles where the earl had been staying. In May the Percies were in revolt, with the Earl Marshal, Thomas, 4th Earl of Norfolk, and Richard le Scrope, the Archbishop of York. Westmorland met them on Shipton Moor, near York, on 29 May 1405, and suggested a parley between the leaders. By pretending accord with the archbishop, the earl induced him to allow his followers to disperse. Scrope and Mowbray were then seized and handed over to Henry at Pontefract on 3 January. The improbabilities of this narrative have led some writers to think, in face of contemporary authorities, that Scrope and Mowbray must have surrendered voluntarily. If Westmorland betrayed them he at least had no share in their execution. Thenceforward Westmorland was busily engaged in negotiating with the Scots and keeping the peace on the borders. He did not play the part assigned to him by Shakespeare in Henry V., for during Henry's absence he remained in charge of the north, and was a member of Bedford's council. He consolidated the strength of his family by marriage alliances. His daughter Catherine married in 1412 John, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, brother and heir of the Earl Marshal, who had been executed after Shipton Moor; Anne married Humphrey, 1st Duke of Buckingham; Eleanor married, after the death of her first husband Richard le Despenser, Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland; Cecily married Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and was the mother of Edward IV and Richard III. The sons by his second marriage were Richard, 5th Earl of Salisbury, William, Baron Fauconberg, George, Baron Latimer, Robert, bishop of Salisbury and then of Durham, and Edward, Baron Abergavenny. The earl died on 21 October 1425, and a fine alabaster tomb was erected to his memory in Staindrop church close by Raby Castle. Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland (c. 1404‚Äì1484), the son of John, Lord Neville (died 1423), succeeded his grandfather in 1425, and married as his first wife Elizabeth Percy, dowager Baroness Clifford, the daughter of Sir Henry \\"Hotspur\\" Percy, thus forming further bonds with the Percies. The 3rd Earl, Ralph Neville (1456‚Äì1499), was his nephew, and the son of John Neville, Lord Neville, who was slain at the Battle of Towton. His grandson Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland (1499‚Äì1550), was an energetic border warrior, who remained faithful to the royal cause when the other great northern lords joined the Pilgrimage of Grace. He was succeeded by his son Henry, 5th Earl (c. 1525‚Äì1563). Charles Neville, 6th Earl (1543‚Äì1601), eldest son of the 5th earl by his first wife Anne, daughter of Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland, was brought up a Roman Catholic, and was further attached to the Catholic party by his marriage with Jane, daughter of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. He was a member of the council of the north in 1569 when he joined Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland, and his uncle Christopher Neville, in the Catholic Rising of the North, which had as its object the liberation of Mary Queen of Scots. On the collapse of the ill-organised insurrection Westmorland fled with his brother earl over the borders, and eventually to the Spanish Netherlands, where he lived in receipt of a pension from Philip II of Spain, until his death on 16 November 1601. He left no sons, and his honours were forfeited by his formal attainder in 1571. Raby Castle remained in the hands of the crown until 1645. During the reign of James I, the earldom was claimed by Edward Neville, a descendant of George Neville, 1st Baron Latymer. Though the claimant was recognised as the heir-male of the first Earl of Westmorland, his claim was not admitted due to the attainder. Fane shield in Fulbeck. 1624 creation Francis Fane, 1st Earl of Westmorland, with his wife Mary Mildmay. The title was revived in 1624 in favour of Sir Francis Fane, whose mother, Mary Neville, was a descendant of a younger son of the first Earl of the 1397 creation. He was created Baron Burghersh, in the County of Sussex, and Earl of Westmorland in the Peerage of England 1624, and became Baron le Despencer on his mother's death in 1626. His son Mildmay Fane, 2nd Earl of Westmorland, at first sided with the king's party in the English Civil War, but was afterwards reconciled with the parliament. John Fane, 7th Earl of Westmorland, served under the Duke of Marlborough, and was made in 1739 lieutenant-general of the British Armies. John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland, only son of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, entered the army in 1803, and in 1805 took part in the Hanoverian campaign as aide-de-camp to General Sir George Don. He was assistant adjutant-general in Sicily and Egypt (1806‚Äì1807), served in the Peninsular War from 1808 to 1813, was British military commissioner to the allied armies under the Prince of Schwarzenberg, and marched with the allies to Paris in 1814. He was subsequently promoted major general (1825), lieutenant-general (1838) and general (1854), although the latter half of his life was given to the diplomatic service. He was British resident at Florence from 1814 to 1830, and British ambassador at Berlin from 1841 to 1851, when he was transferred to Vienna. In Berlin he had mediated in the Schleswig-Holstein question, and in Vienna he was one of the British plenipotentiaries at the congress of 1855. He retired in 1855, and died at Apethorpe Hall, Northamptonshire, on 16 October 1859. Himself a musician of considerable reputation and the composer of several operas, he took a keen interest in the cause of music in England, and in 1822 made proposals which led to the foundation in the next year of the Royal Academy of Music. His wife Priscilla Anne, daughter of William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington, was a distinguished artist. His published works include Memoirs of the Early Campaigns of the Duke of Wellington in Portugal and Spain (1820), and Memoir of the Operations of the Allied Armies under Prince Schwarzenberg and Marshal Blucher (1822). Francis Fane, 12th Earl of Westmorland, fourth son of the preceding, was also a distinguished soldier. He entered the army in 1843 and served through the Punjab campaign of 1846; was made aide-de-camp to the governor-general in 1848, and distinguished himself at the Battle of Gujrat on 21 February 1849. He went on the Crimea Campaign as aide-de-camp to Lord Raglan, and was promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1855. On his return to England he became aide-de-camp to the duke of Cambridge, and received the Crimean Medal. The death of his elder brother in 1851 gave him the style of Lord Burghersh, and after his accession to the earldom in 1859 he retired from the service with the rank of colonel. He died in August 1891 and was succeeded by his son, Anthony Fane, 13th Earl of Westmorland.

Robert Bertie The 4th Duke of Ancaster. Earl of Lindsey is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1626 for the 14th Baron Willoughby de Eresby (see Baron Willoughby de Eresby for earlier history of the family). He was First Lord of the Admiralty from 1635 to 1636 and also established his claim in right of his mother to the hereditary office of Lord Great Chamberlain of England. Lord Lindsey fought on the Royalist side in the Civil War and was killed at the Battle of Edgehill on 23 October 1642. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He also fought at Edgehill and surrendered to the Parliamentarians in order to attend his mortally wounded father. Lord Lindsey later fought at the First Battle of Newbury, Second Battle of Newbury, and at Naseby. His son from his second marriage, James, was created Earl of Abingdon in 1682. He was succeeded by his son from his first marriage to Martha Cockayne, the third Earl. He represented Boston in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. His son, the fourth Earl, was summoned to the House of Lords in 1690 through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Willoughby de Eresby. He later served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire and was one of the Lords Justices before the arrival of King George I. In 1706 he was created Marquess of Lindsey and in 1715 he was further honoured when he was made Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. Both titles were in the Peerage of Great Britain. His son, the second Duke, was called to the House of Lords in 1715 through a writ of acceleration as Baron Willoughby de Eresby. He later served as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. He was succeeded by his son, the third Duke. He was a General in the Army and served as Master of the Horse from 1766 to 1778. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. His son, the fourth Duke, was briefly Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire but died unmarried in 1779 at an early age. On his death the barony of Willoughby de Eresby fell into abeyance between his sisters Lady Priscilla and Georgiana, Marchioness of Cholmondeley, who also jointly inherited the office of Lord Great Chamberlain (the abeyance was terminated in 1780 in favour of Priscilla; see the Baron Willoughby de Eresby for later history of this title). The late Duke was succeeded in the earldom, marquessate and dukedom by his uncle, the fifth Duke. He represented Lincoln in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. He had no sons and on his death in 1809 the marquessate and dukedom became extinct. He was succeeded in the earldom of Lindsey by his third cousin, the ninth Earl. He was the great-grandson of the Hon. Charles Bertie, fifth son of the second Earl. Lord Lindsey was a General in the Army and also sat as Member of Parliament for Stamford. On the death in 1938 of his grandson, the twelfth Earl, the line of the fifth son of the second Earl failed. The late Earl was succeeded by his distant relative (his fifth cousin thrice removed) the eighth Earl of Abingdon (see this title for earlier history of this branch of the family), who became the thirteenth Earl. However, it was not until 1951 the Lord Abingdon was recognised in the earldom of Lindsey. the title is held by his first cousin, the fourteenth Earl of Lindsey and ninth Earl of Abingdon. The family seat is at Gilmilnscroft House, near Mauchline, in East Ayrshire.

History  The first creation came in 1322, when the soldier Andrew Harclay, 1st Baron Harclay, was made Earl of Carlisle. He had already been summoned to Parliament as Lord Harclay (or Lord Harcla) in 1321. However, Lord Carlisle was executed for treason in 1322, with his titles forfeited. The second creation came in 1622, when James Hay, 1st Viscount Doncaster, was made Earl of Carlisle. He was a great favourite of James I and had already been created Lord Hay in the Peerage of Scotland in 1606, as well as Baron Hay, of Sawley in the County of York, and Viscount Doncaster in 1618. The latter titles were in the Peerage of England. Lord Carlisle was the member of a junior branch of the Hay family, headed by the Earl of Erroll. He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, the second Earl. In 1637, he also succeeded his maternal grandfather, Charles Goring, 2nd Earl of Norwich, as second Baron Denny (a title created by writ in 1604; see Earl of Norwich). However, Carlisle was childless and on his death in 1660, all the titles became extinct. The third creation came in 1660, when Sir Charles Howard was made Baron Dacre of Gillesland, in the County of Cumberland, Viscount Howard of Morpeth, in the County of Northumberland, and Earl of Carlisle. A member of the prominent Howard family, he was the great- grandson of Lord William Howard, third son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Lord William Howard's wife was Elizabeth Dacre, youngest daughter of Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre (of Gillesland), a title which had fallen into abeyance on the death of the fifth Baron in 1569. Through this marriage, Naworth Castle and Henderskelfe Castle (which later became the site of Castle Howard) came into the Howard family. Lord Carlisle had earlier supported the Parliamentarian cause in the Civil War, and he is supposed to have been created Baron Gilsland and Viscount Howard of Morpeth by Oliver Cromwell in 1657 (it is certain that he was summoned to Cromwell's House of Lords the same year as \\"Lord Viscount Howard\\"). He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented Morpeth, Cumberland and Carlisle in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland. On his death, the titles passed to his son, the third Earl. He was a prominent statesman and served as First Lord of the Treasury from 1701 to 1702, and in 1715. His third but eldest surviving son, the fourth Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Morpeth. He was succeeded by his eldest son from his second marriage, the fifth Earl. He was an influential politician and held office as First Lord of Trade, as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, as Lord Steward of the Household and as Lord Privy Seal. His eldest son, the sixth Earl, also gained political prominence. He served as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests and as Lord Privy Seal, and was Minister without Portfolio between 1830 and 1834 in the famous Whig government of Lord Grey. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the seventh Earl. He was a noted politician and served as Chief Secretary for Ireland, as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He was a clergyman and served as Rector of Londesborough in Yorkshire. He also died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the ninth Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Charles Wentworth George Howard, fifth son of the sixth Earl. He represented Cumberland East in Parliament as a Liberal and was also a well-regarded painter. His eldest son, the tenth Earl, was Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament for Birmingham South. He was succeeded by his only son, the eleventh Earl. He married as his first wife Bridget Helen Monckton, 11th Lady Ruthven of Freeland (see Lord Ruthven of Freeland for earlier history of this title). On his death in 1963, the titles passed to his only son, the twelfth Earl. In 1982, he also succeeded his mother as twelfth Lord Ruthven of Freeland. , the peerages are held by his eldest son, the thirteenth Earl, who succeeded in 1994. Lord Carlisle unsuccessfully contested Easington in the 1987 general election and Leeds West in the 1992 general election. Several other members of this branch of the Howard family have gained distinction. The Hon. Sir Charles Howard, fourth son of the third Earl, was a general in the Army and also represented Carlisle in the House of Commons for many years. Charles Howard, Viscount Morpeth, eldest son of the fourth Earl from his first marriage, briefly represented Yorkshire before his early death from tuberculosis. The Hon. Frederick Howard, third son of the fifth Earl, was a major in the 10th Hussars and fought at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, where he was killed in action. His eldest son Frederick John Howard was Member of Parliament for Youghal. The Very Reverend the Hon. Henry Edward John Howard, fourth son of the fifth Earl, was Dean of Lichfield. His third son Edward Henry Howard was a vice-admiral in the Navy. Admiral the Hon. Edward Granville George Howard, fourth son of the sixth Earl, was created Baron Lanerton in 1874. The aforementioned the Hon. Charles Wentworth George Howard, fifth son of the sixth Earl, represented East Cumberland in Parliament for almost forty years. Lady Harriet Howard, third daughter of the sixth Earl, was the wife of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland. She was Mistress of the Robes to Queen Victoria and an active Whig in society circles. The Hon. Geoffrey William Algernon Howard, fifth son of the ninth Earl, was a Liberal Member of Parliament. His second son was George Howard, Baron Howard of Henderskelfe. The heir apparent to the earldom, when one exists, is styled Viscount Morpeth. The principal family seat today is Naworth Castle, while Castle Howard is now held by a cadet branch of the family.

The 9th Earl was predeceased by his elder son Anthony Ashley- Cooper, Lord Ashley in 1947; on the 9th Earl's death in 1961, the titles passed to his grandson, the 10th Earl, son of Lord Ashley. In 2004, Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 10th Earl of Shaftesbury was murdered by his third wife, Jamila M'Barek, and her brother. They were convicted of the crime in 2007, two years after the 10th Earl's body was found dismembered in the French Alps. The 10th Earl was succeeded by his elder son Anthony Ashley Cooper, 11th Earl of Shaftesbury. In May 2005, six months after succeeding to the Earldom, the 11th Earl died of a heart attack in New York City, while visiting his younger brother Nicholas Ashley-Cooper, who succeeded him as 12th Earl. Other family members Other prominent members of the family include Liberal politician Evelyn Ashley, second son of the 7th Earl; his son, noted politician, Wilfrid Ashley, 1st Baron Mount Temple, who was a member of the Conservative Party, and his daughter, Edwina, who married Louis Mountbatten and was to be last Vicereine of India. Upon that marriage the Earls of Shaftesbury began close social links to the royal family. Lady Mountbatten was a leading member of London society. Edwina's mother was Amalia Mary Maud Cassel (1879‚Äì1911), daughter of the international magnate Sir Ernest Cassel, a friend and private financier to the future King Edward VII and one of the richest men in Europe. When her grandfather died in 1921, Edwina inherited his vast fortune, which included ¬£2 million, the country seat of Broadlands, Romsey, Hampshire; Brook House in London; Moulton Paddocks estate in Newmarket, Suffolk; Classiebawn Castle, Mullaghmore, County Sligo, Ireland; and a seaside house at Branksome Dene in Bouremouth. They married on 18 July 1922 at St Margaret's, Westminster. The monarch's immediate family attended; the then-Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VIII) was the best man. The relationship between the families continues, as descendants have often been royal godchildren. It was at Broadlands that Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip, spent their honeymoon night in 1947. In turn, Prince Charles and his first wife, Lady Diana Spencer, spent their honeymoon night there in 1981. St Giles House St Giles House, the family seat of the Earls of Shaftesbury Portrait by Gerard Soest of a member of the Ashley-Cooper family The family seat is St Giles House (sometimes referred to as Ashley House) near Wimborne St Giles in Dorset. The estate at Wimborne St Giles came into the ownership of the Ashley family around the year 1460, through the marriage of Egidia Hamelyn and Robert Ashley, the 5th great grandfather of the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. Early owners of the estate included the Malmayne family. Matilda Malmayne, heiress of the estate, married Edmund Plecy. The Plecy male line became extinct towards the end of the fourteenth century, and the estate was transferred to Edmund and Matilda's descendant Joan Plecy, as heiress. Lady Joan Plecy was soon married to Sir John Hamelyn (d. 1399), but with no male heirs, the estate went to Sir John's daughter Egidia, by his second wife, who married Robert Ashley. The estate has belonged to the Ashleys and Ashley-Coopers ever since. Construction on St Giles House began in 1651, by Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper, later to become 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. The manor house is built on top of the ruins of the previous estate home. This large house and surrounding grounds include , along with a seven-acre lake and a avenue of trees. The family also owns Lough Neagh, the largest lake in the British Isles. As noted by Christopher Hussey in his article on St Giles' House,Hussey, Christopher. Country Life, \\"St. Giles's House, Dorset,\\" September 10, 17, 24, 1943) \\"The whole, so little changed in two centuries, is a splendid example of the Kent manner changing into the rococo of the mid- century.\\" However, following World War II, the contents of these rooms have been gradually dispersed in a number of sales. The record of these and a number of published articles indicate that the design of the furniture shows a highly accomplished progression from the architectural Palladian style to the full fanciful rococo style. The accomplished design, together with the high level of craftsmanship, clearly indicate a metropolitan origin for the majority of these pieces, but unfortunately the surviving Shaftesbury Account Books contain few references to London cabinet-makers other than William Hallett, his name appearing a number of times between 1745 and 1757 with references to 'carved chairs,' 'the Blew Bed,' and 'Mahogany Cisterns.' The payments to other cabinet-makers mentioned in accounts are small in nature and probably indicate their local origins.Sotheby's Lot No. 93 The Shaftesburys are known to have had connections with London cabinet makers. The 4th Earl's wife, Lady Susannah Noel, daughter of Baptist Noel, 3rd Earl of Gainsborough, was one of the 26 aristocratic subscribers to the first edition of Thomas Chippendale's Director (1754). His second wife, Lady Mary Bouverie, was the daughter of the 1st Viscount Folkestone who was a major patron of William Hallett and Benjamin Goodison, her brother the 2nd Viscount acquiring pieces from the Royal cabinetmakers William Vile and John Cobb.Doyle, James William Edmund.

Just as Graves's Claudius novels (I, Claudius and Claudius the God and his Wife Messalina) were based on The Twelve Caesars of Suetonius and other Roman sources, Count Belisarius is largely based on Procopius's History of Justinian's Wars and Secret History. However, Graves's treatment of his sources has been criticized by the historian Anthony Kaldellis, who writes that \\"There are many historical novels set in the early sixth century, but none can be recommended that are both historically accurate and well-written. R. Graves's Count Belisarius... is at least well-written.\\"Kaldellis's translation of Procopius, The Secret History, with Related Texts, 2010, , p. lxxix. Count Belisarius purports to be a biography written by Eugenius, a eunuch who is a servant of Belisarius' wife Antonina. The novel covers the entire life of Belisarius, with the bulk of the text being devoted to accounts of his life while on campaign in North Africa and Italy. Antonina was often with him during these years, and Graves uses stories about her connections to the court of the Emperor Justinian and his Empress Theodora to incorporate political intrigue and other information into the story of Belisarius' military exploits. Graves's treatment of Belisarius is mostly respectful: the general is, if anything, hampered by his rigid code of honour and loyalty to his Emperor. Other primary characters do not fare so well. Antonina and Theodora are presented as extremely intelligent and capable individuals who are nevertheless prone to holding grudges and to jealousy. Justinian is portrayed as intelligent but reckless, a tragically poor judge of character, and a spendthrift, though driven by genuine piety. Graves recounts how Belisarius suffers trying to satisfy the whims of the two rulers.

Her name derives from a root meaning \\"covered\\" or \\"secret\\".AnneMarie Hellstr√∂m, Jag vill s√• g√§rna ber√§tta. Neil Gaiman, American Gods (10th Anniversary Edition). In Norwegian folklore, she is known as huldra (\\"the [archetypal] hulder\\", though folklore presupposes that there is an entire Hulder race and not just a single individual). She is known as the skogsr√• \\"forest spirit\\" or Tallemaja \\"pine tree Mary\\" in Swedish folklore, and ulda in S√°mi folklore. Her name suggests that she is originally the same being as the v√∂lva divine figure Huld and the German Holda. The word hulder is only used of a female; a \\"male hulder\\" is called a huldrekall and also appears in Norwegian folklore. This being is closely related to other underground dwellers, usually called tusser (sg., tusse). Whereas the female hulder is almost invariably described as incredible, seductive and beautiful, the males of the same race are sometimes said to be hideous, with grotesquely long noses. Folklore The hulder is one of several r√• (keeper, warden), including the aquatic sj√∂r√• or havsfru, later identified with a mermaid, and the bergsr√• in caves and mines who made life tough for the poor miners. More information can be found in the collected Norwegian folktales of Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen and J√∏rgen Moe. Relations with humans A hulder is talking with a charcoal burner. She looks like a young farmer woman, but her tail is peeking out under her skirt. From Svenska folks√§gner (1882). The hulders were held to be kind to charcoal burners, watching their charcoal kilns while they rested. Knowing that she would wake them if there were any problems, they were able to sleep, and in exchange they left provisions for her in a special place. A tale from N√§rke illustrates further how kind a hulder could be, especially if treated with respect (Hellstr√∂m 1985:15). Origins A tale recounts how a woman had washed only half of her children when God came to her cottage; ashamed of the dirty ones, she hid them. God decreed that those she had hidden from him would be hidden from humanity; they became the hulders.K. M. Briggs, The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature, p 147 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967 Toponyms A multitude of places in Scandinavia are named after the Hulders, often places by legend associated with the presence of the \\"hidden folk\\". Here are some examples showing the wide distribution of Hulder-related toponyms between the northern and southern reaches of Scandinavia, and the terms usage in different language groups' toponyms. Danish * Huldremose (Hulder Bog) is a bog on Djursland, Denmark famous for the discovery of the Huldremose Woman, a bog body from 55BC. Norwegian * Hulderheim is southeast on the island Karls√∏ya, Troms, Norway. The name means \\"Home of the Hulder\\". * Hulderhusan is an area on the southwest of Norway's largest island Hinn√∏ya, whose name means \\"Houses of the Hulders\\". S√°mi * Ulddaidv√°rri in Kv√¶nangen, Troms (Norway) means \\"Mountain of the Hulders\\" in North S√°mi. * Uldda≈°v√°ggi is a valley southwest of Alta in Finnmark, Norway. The name means \\"Hulder Valley\\" in North S√°mi. The peak guarding the pass over from the valley to the mountains above has a similar name, Ruollaƒçohkka, meaning \\"Troll Mountain\\"‚Äîand the large mountain presiding over the valley on its northern side is called H√°ldi, which is a term similar to the above-mentioned Norwegian r√•, that is a spirit or local deity which rules a specific area.

Early life Conrad Grebel was born, probably in Gr√ºningen in the Canton of Zurich, about 1498 to Junker Jakob and Dorothea (Fries) Grebel, the second of six children. He spent his early life in Gr√ºningen, and then came to Zurich with his family around 1513. He spent several years abroad in study, worked as a proofreader in Basel, married in 1522, and became a Christian minister around 1523. Education Conrad Grebel is thought to have studied for six years at the Carolina, the Latin school of the Grossm√ºnster Church in Z√ºrich. He enrolled at the University of Basel in October 1514. While there he studied under Heinrich Loriti, a noted humanist scholar. His father acquired a stipend from Emperor Maximilian for Conrad to study at the University of Vienna. In 1515 he began attending there and remained until 1518. While there, Grebel developed a close friendship with Joachim Vadian,In 1519, Vadian married Conrad Grebel's sister Martha. an eminent Swiss humanist professor from St. Gall. After spending three years in Vienna he returned to Z√ºrich for about three months. His father acquired a scholarship for Conrad from the King of France to attend the University in Paris. He spent two years in study there, and joined the boarding academy of his former teacher in Basel, Loriti. In Paris Grebel engaged in a loose lifestyle, and was involved in several brawls with other students. When Grebel's father received word of his son's demeanor, he cut off Conrad's funds and demanded that he return to Zurich. Conrad Grebel spent about six years in three universities, but without finishing his education or receiving a degree. In 1521 Grebel joined a group gathered to study with Huldrych Zwingli. With him they studied the Greek classics, the Latin Bible, the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament. It was in this study group that Grebel met and developed a close friendship with Felix Manz. Ministry Conrad Grebel probably experienced a conversion in the spring of 1522. His life showed a dramatic change, and he became an earnest supporter of the preaching and reforms of Zwingli. He rose to leadership among Zwingli's young and enthusiastic followers. This close following and enthusiastic support of Zwingli was challenged by the Second DisputationThe first disputation occurred in January 1523 between Zwingli and Johann Faber. in Zurich in October 1523. Grebel and Zwingli broke over abolishing the Mass. Zwingli argued before the council for abolishing the Mass and removing images from the church. But when he saw that the city council was not ready for such radical changes, he chose not to break with the council, and even continued to officiate at the Mass until it was abolished in May 1525. Grebel saw this as an issue of obeying God rather than men, and, with others, could not conscientiously continue in that which they had condemned as unscriptural. These young radicals felt betrayed by Zwingli, while Zwingli looked on them as irresponsible. About 15 men broke with Zwingli, and, while taking no specific action at that time, they regularly met together for prayer, fellowship and Bible study. During this time of waiting for direction from God, they sought religious connections outside of Z√ºrich. Grebel wrote to both Andreas Karlstadt and Martin Luther in the summer of 1524, and to Thomas M√ºntzer in September. Karlstadt traveled to Z√ºrich and met with them in October of that year. Despite apparent similarities, no connection between the Z√ºrich radicals and Karlstadt ever came to fruition. In his letter to M√ºntzer, Grebel encouraged M√ºntzer in his opposition to Luther, but also reproached him for several errors he felt he was making. He urged M√ºntzer not to take up arms. The letter was returned to Grebel, having never reached M√ºntzer. The final question to completely sever ties between the radicals and Zwingli was the question of infant baptism. A public debate was held on 17 January 1525. Zwingli argued against Grebel, Manz and George Blaurock. The city council decided in favor of Zwingli and infant baptism, ordered the Grebel group to cease their activities, and ordered that any unbaptized infants must be submitted for baptism within 8 days. Failure to comply with the council's order would result in exile from the canton. Grebel had an infant daughter, Issabella, who had not been baptized, and he resolutely stood his ground. He did not intend for her to be baptized. The group met together for counsel on 21 January in the home of Felix Manz. This meeting was illegal according to the new decision of the council. George Blaurock asked Grebel to baptize him upon a confession of faith.21 January 1525 is generally regarded as the foundation date of Anabaptism. Afterward, Blaurock baptized the others who were present. As a group they pledged to hold the faith of the New Testament and live as fellow disciples separated from the world. They left the little gathering full of zeal to encourage all men to follow their example. Being well known in Z√ºrich, Grebel left the work to others and set out on an evangelistic mission to the surrounding cities. In February, Grebel baptized Wolfgang Ulimann by immersion in the Rhine River. Ulimann was in St. Gall, and Grebel traveled there in the spring. Conrad Grebel and Wolfgang Ulimann spent several months preaching with much success in the area of St. Gall. In the summer he went to Gr√ºningen and preached with great effect. In October 1525 he was arrested and imprisoned. While in prison, Grebel was able to prepare a defense of the Anabaptist position on baptism.Though no copies are known to remain, quotes taken from Grebel's pamphlet are found in Zwingli's reply (Elenchus) published in 1527. Through the help of some friends, he escaped in March 1526. He continued his ministry and was at some point able to get his pamphlet printed. Grebel removed to the Maienfeld area in the Canton of Grisons (where his oldest sister lived). Shortly after arrival he died, probably around July or August. Works and significance The extant works of Conrad Grebel consist of 69 letters written by him from September 1517 to July 1525, three poems, a petition to the Z√ºrich council, and portions of a pamphlet written by him against infant baptism, as quoted by Zwingli in his counterarguments. Three letters written to Grebel (Benedikt Burgauer, 1523; Vadian, 1524; and Erhard Hegenwalt, 1525) have been preserved. The majority of the 69 letters written by Grebel are from his student years, however, and shed little light on his ministry as an Anabaptist. Though his entire life was less than 30 years, his Christian ministry was compressed into less than four years, and his time as an Anabaptist was only about a year and a half, Conrad Grebel's impact earned him the title \\"the Father of Anabaptists\\".Those who rejected infant baptism in favor of adult baptism upon confession of faith were dubbed Anabaptists (\\"rebaptizers\\") by their enemies, but the movement started by Grebel, Manz, Blaurock and others is more properly known as Swiss Brethren. Grebel performed the first known adult baptism associated with the Reformation, and was referred to as the \\"ringleader\\" of the Anabaptists in Z√ºrich. Zwingli complained of no major differences with Grebel on cardinal points of theology, and minimized Grebel's differences as \\"unimportant outward things, such as these, whether infants or adults should be baptized and whether a Christian may be a magistrate.\\" Yet these differences reveal a deep division of thought on the nature of the church, and the relationship of the church and the Christian to the world. The beliefs of Conrad Grebel and the Swiss Brethren have left an impression on the life and thought of Amish, Baptist, Schwarzenau Brethren/German Baptist, and Mennonite churches, as well as numerous pietistic and free church movements. The Bruderhof Communities, founded in 1920, draw inspiration from the beliefs and actions of Conrad Grebel and the other reformation era Anabaptists. Where others only longed for restitution or shrank from too much reform, Grebel and his group acted decisively and at great personal risk. Freedom of conscience and separation of church and state are two great legacies of the Anabaptist movement initiated by these Swiss Brethren. With Petr Chelƒçick√Ω (1390‚Äì1460) of Bohemia, Conrad Grebel is considered one of the first nonresistant Christians of the Reformation. In 1961 a Mennonite University College was named after him in Waterloo, Ontario. Family The Grebels had been a prominent Swiss family for over a century before Conrad's birth. His father Jakob was an iron merchant and served as a magistrate in Gr√ºningen from 1499 to 1512. After that he served as a representative on the council of the Canton of Z√ºrich, and was also frequently called upon as an ambassador for Z√ºrich to meetings of the Swiss Confederation. Jakob Grebel disagreed with his son's religious sentiments, but he also thought Zwingli's measures against the Anabaptists were too harsh. Jakob Grebel was executed in Z√ºrich on 30 October 1526, having been convicted of receiving illegal funds from foreign rulers. Some scholars consider his opposition to the measures of Zwingli as a likely reason behind the execution. Against his family's wishes, Conrad Grebel married Barbara on 6 February 1522. Children were born to this union, and relatives raised the children after the death of Conrad. Ironically, the children were raised in the Reformed faith, and the family name once again became prominent in Z√ºrich.

Nephelinite is a fine-grained or aphanitic igneous rock made up almost entirely of nepheline and clinopyroxene (variety augite). If olivine is present, the rock may be classified as an olivine nephelinite. Nephelinite is dark in color and may resemble basalt in hand specimen. However, basalt consists mostly of clinopyroxene (augite) and calcic plagioclase. Basalt, alkali basalt, basanite, tephritic nephelinite, and nephelinite differ partly in the relative proportions of plagioclase and nepheline. Alkali basalt may contain minor nepheline and does contain nepheline in its CIPW normative mineralogy. A critical ratio in the classification of these rocks is the ratio nepheline/(nepheline plus plagioclase). Basanite has a value of this ratio between 0.1 and 0.6 and also contains more than 10% olivine. Tephritic nephelinite has a value between 0.6 and 0.9. Nephelinite has a value greater than 0.9. Le Maitre (2002) defines and discusses these and other criteria in the classification of igneous rocks. Nephelinite is an example of a silica-undersaturated igneous rock. The degree of silica saturation can be evaluated with normative mineralogy calculated from chemical analyses, or with actual mineralogy for completely crystallized igneous rocks with equilibrated assemblages. Silica-oversaturated rocks contain quartz (or another silica polymorph). Silica-undersaturated mafic igneous rocks contain magnesian olivine but not magnesian orthopyroxene, and/or a feldspathoid. Silica-saturated igneous rocks fall in between these two classes. Silica-undersaturated, mafic igneous rocks are much less abundant than silica-saturated and oversaturated basalts. Genesis of the less common mafic rocks such as nephelinite is usually ascribed to more than one of the following three causes: * relatively high pressure of melting; * relatively low degree of fractional melting in a mantle source; * relatively high dissolved carbon dioxide in the melt. Nephelinites and similar rocks typically contain relatively high concentrations of elements such as the light rare earths, as consistent with a low degree of melting of mantle peridotite at depths sufficient to stabilize garnet. Nephelinites are also associated with carbonatite in some occurrences, consistent with source rocks relatively rich in carbon dioxide. Nephelinite is found on ocean islands such as Oahu, although the rock type is very rare in the Hawaiian islands. It is found in a variety of continental settings. An example is the Hamada nephelinite lava flow in southwest Japan which occurred in the late Miocene age. Nephelinite is also associated with the highly alkalic volcanism of the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcanic field in Tanzania. Nyiragongo, another African volcano known for its semipermanent lava lake activity, erupts lava made of melilite nephelinite. The unusual chemical makeup of this igneous rock may be a factor in the unusual fluidity of its lavas.

Olivine nephelinite flows also occur in the Wells Gray- Clearwater volcanic field in east-central British Columbia and at Volcano Mountain in central Yukon Territory.

Armonk, NY and London: M.E. Sharpe. Mayo was formally trained at the University of Adelaide, acquiring a Bachelor of Arts Degree graduating with First Class Honours, majoring in philosophy and psychology, and was later awarded an honorary Master of Arts Degree from the University of Queensland (UQ). While in Queensland, Mayo served on the University's war committee and pioneered research into the psychoanalytic treatment of shell-shock. As a psychologist Mayo often helped soldiers returning from World War I recover from the stresses of war and with a Brisbane physician, pioneered the psychoanalytic treatment of shell-shock and conducted psycho-pathological tests. He was a lecturer in psychology and mental philosophy at the UQ between 1911 and 1922, when he sailed to the United States. In 1926 he was appointed to the Harvard Business School (HBS) as a professor of industrial research. In Philadelphia he conducted research at a textile plant in order to develop a method to reduce the very high rate of turnover in the plant.Mayo, E. (1924). Revery and industrial fatigue. Journal of Personnel Research, 3, 273-281. Mayo's association with the Hawthorne studies as well as his research and work in Australia led to his enjoying a public acclaim granted to few social scientists of his day. Mayo has been credited with making significant contributions to a number of disciplines, including business management, industrial sociology, philosophy, and social psychology. His field research in industry had a significant impact on industrial and organizational psychology.Trahair, R. C. S. (1984). Elton Mayo: The humanist temper. Piscataway, NJ: Transaction According to Trahair, Mayo \\"is known for having established the scientific study of what today is called organizational behavior when he gave close attention to the human, social, and political problems of industrial civilization.\\" (p. 15). Mayo's work helped to lay the foundation for the human relations movement. He emphasized that alongside the formal organization of an industrial workplace there exists an informal organizational structure as well. Mayo recognized the \\"inadequacies of existing scientific management approaches\\" to industrial organizations, and underlined the importance of relationships among people who work for such organizations. His ideas on group relations were advanced in his 1933 book The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization, which was based partly on his Hawthorne research.Mayo, E. (1933). The human problems of an industrial civilization. Cambridge, MA: Harvard. Early life and education Mayo was the eldest son of George Gibbes Mayo, a draftsman and later a civil engineer, and his wife Henrietta Mary, n√©e Donaldson. His grandfather George Mayo (1807‚Äì1894) was a well-known South Australian medical practitioner. Elton attended several schools in Australia (Queen's School, St Peter's College, and the University of Adelaide) and after 1901 attended medical school in Edinburgh and London, neither of which he completed. In 1903 he went to West Africa, and upon returning to London, began writing articles for magazines and teaching English at the Working Men's College. He returned to Adelaide in 1905 to a partnership in the printing firm of J. H. Sherring & Co., but in 1907 he went back to the university to study philosophy and psychology under Sir William Mitchell. He won the Roby Fletcher prize in psychology and graduated with honours (B.A., 1910; M.A., 1926Trahair, R. C. S. (1984). Elton Mayo: The humanist temper. Piscataway, NJ: Transaction. \\"Mayo wrote of his appointment [to Harvard] to Sir William Mitchell, his mentor at the University of Adelaide. Immediately Mitchell personally arranged for Mayo to receive a Master of Arts degree. It was awarded for a thesis, presumably, on Mayo's research at Continental Mills\\" (p. 199), a textile manufacturing plant in Philadelphia.) and was named the David Murray research scholar in scientific studies. In 1911 he became foundation lecturer in mental and moral philosophy at the new University of Queensland and in 1919‚Äì23 held the first chair of philosophy there. He moved on to the University of Pennsylvania, but spent the second half of his career at Harvard Business School (1926‚Äì1947), where he was professor of industrial research. Two influences on his career from his time at the University of Queensland were Mayo's friendship with the social anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski and his work with shell-shock cases returning from the First World War. Malinowski first met Mayo on his way to and from the Trobriand Islands; they became close friends and were regularly in touch until Malinowski's death in 1942. The work with shell-shock soldiers provided a focus for Mayo's interests in clinical psychology and developed his skills in psychotherapy. In this he was strongly influenced by the work on hysteria and obsession of the French psychiatrist, Pierre Janet, who became a critic of Sigmund Freud. For the rest of his working life, Mayo was an active psychotherapist and this practical experience was an important influence on his theoretical and methodological work in America. Research One of Mayo's (1924) earliest research efforts involved workers at a Philadelphia textile mill.Mayo, E. (1924). Recovery and industrial fatigue. The Journal of Personnel Research, 3, 273-281. The mill had been experiencing a high rate of turnover. Mayo believed that the repetitive work in the spinning department gave rise to mental abnormalities in the workers. He found that the introduction of rest periods helped reduce turnover. The research helped make Mayo more widely known in the U.S. Mayo helped to lay the foundation for the human relations movement, and was known for his industrial research including the Hawthorne Studies and his book The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization (1933). The research he conducted under the rubric of the Hawthorne Studies in the late 1920s and early 1930s, underlining the importance of groups in affecting the behaviour of individuals at work. Elton Mayo laid the ground rules for interviewing, the principles of which have been subsequently repeated in numerous 'how to' books on leadership, coaching and mentoring over the last half century. Hawthorne studies Fritz J. Roethlisberger, Mayo's graduate assistant, and William J. Dickson, head of the Department of Employee Relations at Western Electric, conducted the bulk of the practical research, with Mayo rarely visiting the Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois. Mayo's team carried out a number of \\"experiments\\" to look at ways of improving productivity. The research involved manipulating length of rest and lunch periods and piecework payment plans.Parsons, H.M. (1974). What happened at Hawthorne? Science, 183(4128), 922-932. doi: 10.1126/science.183.4128.922 Mayo concluded that productivity partly depended on the informal social patterns of interaction in the work group. Mayo, in communicating to business leaders, advanced the idea that managers who understand the nature of informal ties among workers can make decisions for management's benefit. Mayo concluded that people's work performance is dependent on both social relationships and job content. He suggested a tension between workers' \\"logic of sentiment\\" and managers' \\"logic of cost and efficiency\\" which could lead to conflict within organizations. Parsons, however, showed that the Hawthorne studies, which were not really experiments, were too confounded to enable researchers to draw firm conclusions. The qualitative aspects of the research suggested that norms of co-operation among workers were related to productivity. The Human Problems of an Industrialized Civilization The books begins with an account of the research on human fatigue and efficiency conducted in the early 20th century. Mayo's credentials Although biographers agree about Mayo's contributions, there is no consensus about his credentials. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, biographical dictionaries, and some published texts indicate that Mayo was a psychologist. Some authors and critics have discussed Mayo's credentials and his various other job titles during his career in the United States. Cullen does not mention that Mayo was a psychologist although Cullen noted that Mayo let interlocutors call him \\"Dr. Mayo,\\" letting himself be cast as a Ph.D. in one of the social sciences, without correcting the mistake. Mayo's biographer Trahair wrote, \\"Mayo was not a psychologist, sociologist, or anthropologist, although sometimes he was cast as such\\" (p. 357). Trahair also wrote that \\"after the great war Mayo's reputation grew as a successful academic, clinical psychologist and public speaker\\" (p. 89). Of course having a reputation as a clinical psychologist does not necessarily make one a clinical psychologist (the public often thinks of psychotherapists, regardless of training, as clinical psychologists or even psychiatrists).Von Sydow, K., & Reimer, C. (1998). Attitudes toward psychotherapists, psychologists, psychiatrists and psychoanalysts: A meta-content analysis of 60 studies published between 1948 and 1995. American Journal of Psychotherapy, 52(4), 463-488. Cullen indicated that Mayo was not a medical doctor, writing that in April 1903, Mayo \\"enrolled at a small medical school at Saint George's Hospital at London....At this point, Mayo's interest in medicine was all but non-existent\\" (p. 28). Having dropped out by December 1903, Mayo \\"wrote home and finally revealed to his family the truth; he did not and could not become a doctor\\" (p. 28). Miner wrote: \\"An effective speaker and proficient in cultivating influential friends and mentors, he nevertheless had little by way of academic credentials and practically no training in the conduct of scientific research\\" (p. 60). Criticisms Mayo's contributions to management theory were criticised by intellectual Daniel Bell. Writing in 1947, Bell criticised Mayo and other social scientists for \\"adjusting men to machines,\\" rather than enlarging human capacity or human freedom.Bell, D. (January 1947). The study of man: Adjusting men to machines. Commentary, 3, 79‚Äì88. Many, including Reinhard Bendix and Lloyd H. Fisher, criticized Mayo for generalizing his results of the Hawthorne studies. The two state that Mayo's research concerned small, isolated groups, and it was not clear that the conditions and supervision he achieved could have been replicated in large groups and factory settings.Hseuh, Y. (2002). The Hawthorne Experiments and the Introduction of Jean Piaget in American Industrial Psychology, 1929-1932. History of Psychology, 5(2), 163-189. His theories are also based upon the assumption that humans, by nature, want to cooperate and form groups, and he never allows for the possibility of Jos√© Ortega y Gasset's idea of \\"the stranger,\\" built upon the proposition that humans, by nature, are suspicious of others.Sarachek, B. (1968). Elton Mayo's Social Psychology and Human Relations. The Academy of Management Journal, 11(2), 189-197. More recently, in 2003, James Hoopes criticised Mayo for \\"substituting therapy for democracy.\\"Hoopes, James. (2003). False Prophets: The Gurus Who Created Modern Management And Why Their Ideas Are Bad For Business Today. Cambridge, MA: Basic Books.

In the late 18th century, Karl von Eckartshausen, a German Christian mystic, describes the true Adepts of the Rose Cross in the following terms: \\"These sages, whose number is small, are children of light, and are opposed to darkness. They dislike mystification and secrecy; they are open and frank, have nothing to do with secret societies and with external ceremonies. They possess a spiritual temple, in which God is presiding\\".von Eckartshausen, Karl (1790). Aufschl√ºsse √ºber Magie. [Explanations Concerning Magic.] M√ºnchen [Munich], 1790; cited by Franz Hartmann in Life & Prophecies of Paracelsus (1493‚Äì1541), p. 199. Later, in the early 20th century, Max Heindel, a Rosicrucian Initiate, emphasizes that the roots of the Brothers of the Rose Cross, immersed in the western mystery tradition, are almost impossible to be traced as \\"theirs is a work which aims to encourage the evolution of humanity, they have labored far back into antiquity‚Äîunder one guise or another\\".The Brothers of the Rose Cross by The Rosicrucian Fellowship Freemasonry and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn Connections between Free Masonry and Rose Cross exist from times preceding the formation of actual Grand Lodge (Landmarks of Andersen in 1717), as it is proved by the poem Threnodie of Henry Adamson (1638) \\"We are brethren of the Rosie Crossie, We have the Mason Word and second sight\\" Thomas De Quincey in his work titled; Rosicrucians and Freemasonry, suggest that Freemasonry was possibly an outgrowth of Rosicrucianism. More recently, the Rosy Cross is also a symbol found in some Masonic Christian bodiesSee image: The \\"18¬∞ Knight of the Rose Croix\\" degree of the Scottish Rite. and employed by individuals and groups formed during the last centuries for the study of Rosicrucianism and allied subjects,See image: Rosy Cross lamen of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. but derived from the adoption of a red rose. Freemasonry Within the Southern Jurisdiction of the Scottish Rite concordant body of Freemasonry, the Eighteenth Degree is specifically concerned with the rose cross and confers the title of \\"Knight Rose Croix\\". Of one version of the degree, Albert Pike wrote in 1871, He goes on to give an explanation of what he believes to be the symbolism of the Rose Cross in that degree: Golden Dawn The Rosy Cross Lamen as worn by Adepts in the Rosae Rubae et Aureae Crucis, the inner order of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Rosy Cross Lamen rear. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn made use of the rosy cross as well, including 'The Ritual of the Rose Cross,\\" designed for spiritual protection and as preparation for meditation. Based on the Rosicrucian symbolism of the Red Rose and the Cross of Gold, it is also a key symbol of the Golden Dawn's Second Order. According to Regardie, the Golden Dawn rosy cross contains attributes for the Elements, Planets, Zodiac, Hebrew alphabet, alchemical principles, the hexagram and pentagram, the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life, and the formula of INRI. On the back side of the rosy cross is inscribed the motto of the Zelator Adeptus Minor at the bottom, \\"The master Jesus Christ, God and Man\\" between four Maltese crosses, and in the center, written in Latin, \\"Blessed be the Lord our God who hath given us the Symbol Signum.\\" Regardie says of the rosy cross in The Golden Dawn: =Symbolism of the Golden Dawn Rosy Cross= This lamen is a complete synthesis of the masculine, positive, or rainbow scale of color attributions, which is also called the Scale of the King. The four arms of the cross belong to the four elements and are colored accordingly. The white portion belongs to the Holy Spirit and the planets. The petals of the rose refer to the twenty-two paths on the Tree of Life and the Twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. It is the cross in Tiphareth, the receptacle and the center of the forces of the Sephiroth and the paths. The extreme center of the rose is white, the reflected spiritual brightness of Kether, bearing upon it the Red Rose of Five Petals and the Golden Cross of Six Squares; four green rays issue from around the angles of the cross. Upon the white portion of the lamen, below the rose, is placed the hexagram, with the planets. Around the pentagrams, which are placed one upon each elemental colored arm, are drawn the symbols of the spirit and the four elements. Upon each of the floriated (the arms) of the cross are arranged the three alchemical principles of sulfur, salt, and mercury. The white rays issuing from behind the rose at the inner angles between the arms of the cross are the rays of the divine light issuing and coruscating from the reflected light of Kether in its center; and the letters and symbols on them refer to the analysis of the Key Word ‚Äì I.N.R.I. Aleister Crowley and Ordo Templi Orientis Kabbalistic Order of the Rose- Cross version of Rosy Cross ‚Äì the Hebrew Tetragrammaton divine name on the arms of the cross, and the Pentagrammaton in the inner pentagram. The symbol of the rosy cross played a substantial role within the system of Thelema as developed by Aleister Crowley. In a cosmological context, the rose is Nuit, the infinitely expanded goddess of the night sky, and the cross is Hadit, the ultimately contracted atomic point. For Crowley, it was the job of the adept to identify with the appropriate symbol so to experience the mystical conjunction of opposites, which leads to attainment. In this sense, the rose cross is a grand symbol of the Great Work: Crowley also makes clear that this process is reflected in the sexual act: The rosy cross is further symbolic of the grade of Adeptus Minor in the A‚à¥A‚à¥, the Qabalistic sphere of Tiphareth on the Tree of Life, the magical formula INRI, and the concepts of Light (LVX) and Life.De Lege Libellum Ordo Templi Orientis The rose cross also has a place in the system of Ordo Templi Orientis. It is associated with the Fifth Degree, the title of which is \\"Sovereign Prince Rose-Croix, and Knight of the Pelican and Eagle.\\" Of it, Crowley writes in \\"An Intimation with Reference to the Constitution of the Order\\": Fellowship of the Rosy Cross The Fellowship of the Rosy Cross was a Christian mystical organization established by Arthur Edward Waite in England in 1915. It developed out of the breakdown of Independent and Rectified Rite of the Golden Dawn. It was based on Waite's complicated ideas and its rites reflected his interest in the history of the Rosicrucian Order, Freemasonry, and Christian mystical teachings through the ages. Most of its members were Freemasons or theosophists. One of its most noted members was the novelist Charles Williams who was a member from 1917 to at least 1928 and possibly later. There were plans to establish a branch in the United States but they appear never to have been fulfilled. The order ended with Waite's death in 1942.Gilbert, Robert A. (1983). The Golden Dawn: Twilight of the Magicians. Aquarian Press. pp. 76‚Äì77. . Arthur Edward Waite wrote also a book entitled The Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross, which presents the brotherhood as a Christian order dating from the Middle Ages. Modern forms Rosicrucian Fellowship emblem AMORC emblem AMORC cross One modern form of the Rosie Cross is found in a Rosicrucian Christian symbol that places a crown of red roses ennobling a white rose at the centre of the cross; radiating behind is the golden five-pointed star, an allusion also to 'the Five Points of Fellowship'.See image The Rosicrucian Fellowship (emblem). It is the symbol of the fraternity that has prepared a great lodge for the Brethren to be gathered.See image: The Ecclesia (portico). The Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, commonly known as the Rosicrucian Order, AMORC, is the largest Rosicrucian group today, with twenty-three Grand Lodges or Jurisdictions worldwide. There are two primary versions used by the Ancient Mystical Order Rosae Crucis. One is a Gold Latin Cross with a Rose at its center. Another is a downward pointing triangle with a Greek (equilateral) Cross inscribed within the triangle and a top oval reminiscent of an Egyptian Ankh. In both cases the symbolism suggests that \\"together, the rose and cross represent the experiences and challenges of a thoughtful life well- lived.\\"AMORC. Our Traditional and Chronological History. In addition, the Gold Latin Cross version represents the human person with arms outstretched in worship, with the rose at its center as the unfoldment of the human soul over many lifetimes of work.

The rocks are mostly pale colored, grey or pink, and in general appearance they are not unlike granites, but dark green varieties are also known. Phonolite is the fine-grained extrusive equivalent. Petrology Nepheline syenite of the Intrusive Complex of Tangu√°, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Motoki et al., 2011a) Nepheline syenites are silica- undersaturated and some are peralkaline (terms discussed in igneous rock). Nepheline is a feldspathoid, a solid-solution mineral, that does not coexist with quartz; rather, nepheline would react with quartz to produce alkali feldspar. They are distinguished from ordinary basic syenites not only by the presence of nepheline but also by the occurrence of many other minerals rich in alkalis and in rare earths and other incompatible elements. Alkali feldspar dominates, commonly represented by orthoclase and the exsolved lamellar albite, form perthite. In some rocks the potash feldspar, in others the soda feldspar predominates. Fresh clear microcline is very characteristic of some types of nepheline syenite. Sodalite, colorless and transparent in thin section, but frequently pale blue in the hand specimens, is the principal feldspathoid mineral in addition to nepheline. Reddish-brown to black triclinic aenigmatite occurs also in these rocks. Extremely iron-rich olivine is rare, but is present in some nepheline syenite. Other minerals common in minor amounts include sodium-rich pyroxene, biotite, titanite, iron oxides, apatite, fluorite, melanite garnet, and zircon. Cancrinite occurs in several nepheline-syenites. A great number of interesting and rare minerals have been recorded from nepheline syenites and the pegmatite veins which intersect them. Macroscopic aspects eudialytic nepheline syenite) Kangerdluarssaq Fjord, far-southern Greenland. Slab is 9.5 cm tall. Macroscopic aspects of nepheline syenite are similar to those of granite. The presence of nepheline and absence of quartz are the fundamental difference. Biotite is generally of low content and the main mafic minerals are clinopyroxene (¬±) and amphibole (¬±). The macroscopic colour is grey, being little darker than granite. There is high-grade metamorphic rock originated from nepheline syenite that is characterized by gneiss texture of very rare occurrence. It is called nepheline syenite gneiss or litchfieldite. An example is found at Cana√£ village, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Texture The rock is holocrystalline, generally equigranular, equidirectional, and gross with grain size of 2 mm to 5 mm. In certain rare cases, the rock contains alkaline feldspar phenocrysts of 2 cm to 5 cm in length and 5 mm to 2 cm in thickness. The phenocrysts demonstrate orientation and eventually show cumulative texture. Mineral composition The main minerals are alkali feldspar, nepheline, clinopyroxene (¬±), amphibole (¬±), and biotite (¬±). Nepheline is the main feldspathoid. Quartz and orthopyroxene are absent. According to the IUGS classification nomenclature (International Union of Geological Sciences, Streckeisen, 1978), nepheline syenite has 10% < F/(F + A + P) < 60% and P/(A + P) < 10% (where F ‚Äì feldspathoids, A ‚Äì alkali feldspar, and P ‚Äì plagioclase volume fractions). Phonolite is the fine-grained equivalent. In case nepheline is less than 10%, the rock is called alkaline syenite with nepheline or pulaskite. The similar rock without quartz and nepheline is denominated alkaline syenite or syenite. Because of the presence of feldspathoids, nepheline syenite is classified to be a typical alkaline rock. The alkaline feldspar is not potassic, but generally sodic-potassic, which is characterized by interlocking anorthoclase, called perthite. In the alkali feldspar almost pure albite domains are observed. Nepheline generally shows partial alteration into natrolite and cancrinite. The clinopyroxene is sodic whose composition varies from hedenbergite to aegirine-augite. This mineral eventually presents resorption shape. The reaction rim constituted by amphibole and/or biotite is commonly observed. The amphibole is of high alkali, such as alkaline hornblende and riebeckite. The alkaline clinopyroxene and amphibole are characteristics of typical alkaline rocks. Biotite is annite, with high Fe/Mg ratio. The accessory minerals are magnetite, ilmenite, apatite, and titanite. Eventually, sodalite is found along hydrothermal fractures. Different from granite, zircon is rare and, if present, it is as xenocrysts. On the other hand, nepheline syenite gneiss contains abundant and large zircon crystals. Genesis Silica-undersaturated igneous rocks typically are formed by low degrees of partial melting in the Earth's mantle. Carbon dioxide may dominate over water in source regions. Magmas of such rocks are formed in a variety of environments, including continental rifts, ocean islands, and supra-subduction positions in subduction zones. Nepheline syenite and phonolite may be derived by crystal fractionation from more mafic silica-undersaturated mantle-derived melts, or as partial melts of such rocks. Igneous rocks with nepheline in their normative mineralogy commonly are associated with other unusual igneous rocks such as carbonatite. Distribution Pseudoleucite nepheline syenite of the Intrusive Complex of Morro de S√£o Jo√£o, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Motoki et al., 2011b) Nepheline syenites and phonolites occur, for example, in Canada, Norway, Greenland, Sweden, the Ural Mountains, the Pyrenees, Italy, Brazil, China, the Transvaal region, the mountains of the Central Montana Alkali Province, and Magnet Cove igneous complex of Arkansas, as well as on oceanic islands. Phonolite lavas formed in the East African rift in particularly large quantity, and the volume there may exceed the volume of all other phonolite occurrences combined, as discussed by Barker (1983). Nepheline-normative rocks occur in close association with the Bushveld Igneous Complex, possibly formed from partial melting of the wall rocks to that large ultramafic layered intrusion. Nepheline syenites are rare; there is only one occurrence in Great Britain (Loch Borralan)Sutherland, D.S. (editor) (1982) Igneous Rocks of the British Isles, page 211 and one in France and Portugal. They are known also in Bohemia and in several places in Norway, Sweden and Finland. In the Americas these rocks have been found in Texas, Arkansas, New Jersey (Beemerville ComplexEby, G. N., 2012, The Beemerville alkaline complex, northern New Jersey, in Harper, J. A., ed., Journey along the Taconic unconformity, northeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and southeastern New York: Guidebook, 77th Annual Field Conference of Pennsylvania Geologists, Shawnee on Delaware, PA, p. 85‚Äì91.) and Massachusetts, also in Ontario, British Columbia and Brazil. South Africa, Madagascar, India, Tasmania, Timor and Turkestan are other localities for the rocks of this series. Rocks of this class also occur in Brazil (Serra de Tingua) containing sodalite and often much augite, in the western Sahara and Cape Verde Islands; also at Zwarte Koppies in the Transvaal, Madagascar, S√£o Paulo in Brazil, Paisano Pass in West Texas, United States, and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The rock of Salem, Massachusetts, United States, is a mica-foyaite rich in albite and aegirine: it accompanies granite and essexite. Litchfieldite is another well-marked type of nepheline-syenite, in which albite is the dominant feldspar. It is named after Litchfield, Maine, United States, where it occurs in scattered blocks. Biotite, cancrinite and sodalite are characteristic of this rock. A similar nepheline-syenite is known from Hastings County, Ontario, and contains hardly any orthoclase, but only albite feldspar. Nepheline is very abundant and there is also cancrinite, sodalite, scapolite, calcite, biotite and hornblende. The lujaurites are distinguished from the rocks above described by their dark color, which is due to the abundance of minerals such as augite, aegirine, arfvedsonite and other kinds of amphibole. Typical examples are known near Lujaur on the White Sea, where they occur with umptekites and other very peculiar rocks. Other localities for this group are at Julianehaab in Greenland with sodalite-syenite; at their margins they contain pseudomorphs after leucite. The lujaurites frequently have a parallel-banding or gneissose structure. Sodalite-syenites in which sodalite very largely or completely takes the place of nepheline occur in Greenland, where they contain also microcline-perthite, aegirine, arfvedsonite and eudialyte. Cancrinite syenite, with a large percentage of cancrinite, has been described from Dalekarlia, Sweden and from Finland. Urtite from Lujaur Urt on the White Sea consists very largely of nepheline, with aegirine and apatite, but no feldspar. Jacupirangite (from Jacupiranga in Brazil) is a blackish rock composed of titaniferous augite, magnetite, ilmenite, perofskite and nepheline, with secondary biotite. Nomenclature There is a wide variety of silica- undersaturated and peralkaline igneous rocks, including many informal place- name varieties named after the locations in which they were first discovered. In many cases these are plain nepheline syenites containing one or more rare minerals or mineraloids, which do not warrant a new formal classification. These include; Foyaite: foyaites are named after Foya in the Serra de Monchique, in southern Portugal. These are K-feldspar-nepheline syenites containing <10% ferromagnesian minerals, usually pyroxene, hornblende and biotite. Laurdalite: The laurdalites, from Laurdal in Norway, are grey or pinkish, and in many ways closely resemble the larvikites of southern Norway, with which they occur. They contain anorthoclase feldspars, biotite or greenish augite, much apatite and in some cases, olivine. Ditroite: Ditroite derives its name from Ditrau, Transylvania, Romania. It is essentially a microcline, sodalite and cancrinite variety of nepheline syenite. It contains also orthoclase, nepheline, biotite, aegirine, acmite. Chemical composition Thin section image of the nepheline syenite of the Intrusive Complex of Tangu√°, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Motoki et al., 2011a) The chemical peculiarities of the nepheline-syenites are well marked. They are exceedingly rich in alkalis and in alumina (hence the abundance of felspathoids and alkali feldspars), with silica varying from 50 to 56%, while lime, magnesia and iron are never present in great quantity, though somewhat more variable than the other components. A worldwide average of the major elements in nepheline syenite tabulated by Barker (1983) is listed below, expressed as weight percent oxides. Nepheline syenite is characterized by high ratio of (Na2O+K2O)/SiO2 and (Na2O+K2O)/Al2O3, which are represented respectively by the existence of nepheline and alkaline mafic minerals. Therefore, it is classified geochemically as alkaline rock. This rock has low Fe and Mg contents, in total about 3wt%, and in this sense it is classified to be felsic rock. However, the SiO2 content is not so high, being 53% to 62wt%, which is equivalent to andesite and diorite. In this sense, it corresponds to intermediate rock. Light rare-earth elements are highly concentrated, indicating that the magma is highly differentiated. * SiO2: 54.99% * TiO2: 0.60% * Al2O3: 20.96% * Fe2O3: 2.25% * FeO: 2.05% * MnO: 0.15% * MgO: 0.77% * CaO: 2.31% * Na2O: 8.23% * K2O: 5.58% * H2O: 1.47% * P2O5: 0.13% The normative mineralogy of this average composition contains about 22% nepheline and 66% feldspar. Because nepheline syenite lacks quartz and is rich in feldspar and nepheline, it is used in the manufacturing of glass and ceramics. Uses Nepheline syenite provides geological clues to environment of formation. It also provides a source of unusual mineral specimens and rare-earth elements (REE) extraction. The industrial use of nepheline syenite includes refractories, glass making, ceramics and, in pigments and fillers. In these applications the nepheline syenite is ground and dark minerals are carefully separated leaving a mixture of primarily felspar and nepheline. This mixture is higher in alkali and aluminium and typically lower in iron than felspars from pegmatites making it a good raw material. NotesReferences * S√∏rensen, H. 1974.

Chapter 1 Origins of the Rosicrucian Order. RF Friends (accessed on February 11, 2017)European Tradition for Initiation. Anthroposophical Health Studies (accessed on February 11, 2017) Christian Rosenkreuz (also spelled Rosenkreutz and Christian Rose Cross) is the legendary, possibly allegorical, founder of the Rosicrucian Order (Order of the Rose Cross). He is presented in three manifestos that were published early in the 17th century. These were: *Fama Fraternitatis (published 1614 in Kassel, Germany) This manifesto introduced the founder, \\"Frater C.R.C.\\" *Confessio Fraternitatis (published 1615 in Kassel, Germany) *The Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz (published 1616 in Strasbourg, Germany). Legend Frater C.R.C. ‚Äì Christian Rose Cross (symbolical representation) According to legend, Christian Rosenkreuz was a doctor who discovered and learned esoteric wisdom on a pilgrimage to the Middle East among Turkish, Arab and Persian sages, possibly Sufi or Zoroastrian masters, supposedly in the early 15th century (see ¬ß Symbolism of the numbers in the Manifestos); returned and founded the \\"Fraternity of the Rose Cross\\" with himself (Frater C.R.C.) as Head of the Order. Under his direction a Temple, called Sanctus Spiritus, or \\"The House of the Holy Spirit\\", was built. It is described that his body, as discovered by a Brother of the Order, was in a perfect state of preservation 120 years after his death (which occurred in absolute secrecy) ‚Äì as Rosenkreuz had predicted ‚Äî in a heptagonal chamber erected by himself as a storehouse of knowledge. It is described that on the Sarcophagus in the centre of the Crypt of Christian Rosenkreutz were written, among other inscriptions the words, \\"Jesus mihi omnia, nequaquam vacuum, libertas evangelii, dei intacta gloria, legis jugum\\" (\\"Jesus is everything to me, by no means empty, the freedom of the gospel, the untouched glory of God, the yoke of the law\\"), testifying to the builder's Christian character. Rosenkreuz's crypt, according to the description presented in the legend, is located in the interior of the Earth, recalling the alchemical motto V.I.T.R.I.O.L.: Visita Interiora Terrae Rectificando Invenies Occultum Lapidem (\\"Visit the interior of the Earth; by rectification thou shalt find the hidden stone\\"). Biographies Count of St. Germain by unknown artist According to some researchers, Christian Rosenkreuz was the last descendant of the Germelshausen, a German family which flourished in the 13th century.Maurice Magre (1877‚Äì1941). Magicians, Seers, and Mystics Their castle stood in the Thuringian Forest on the Border of Hesse and they had embraced Albigensian (i.e., Cathar) doctrines, combining Gnostic and Christian beliefs. The whole family was put to death by Konrad von Marburg except for the youngest son, who was only five years old. He was carried away secretly by a monk who was an Albigensian adept from Languedoc. The child was placed in a monastery which had already come under the influence of the Albigenses, where he was educated and made the acquaintance of the four other brothers who were later to be associated with him in the founding of the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. His account derives from oral tradition. Some occultists including Rudolf Steiner, Max HeindelMax Heindel, Christian Rosenkreuz and the Order of Rosicrucians, 1909 and (much later) Guy Ballard, have stated that Rosenkreuz later reappeared as the Count of St. Germain, a courtier, adventurer and alchemist who reportedly died on 27 February 1784. Steiner once identified Rembrandt's painting \\"A Man in Armour\\" as a portrait of Christian Rosenkreuz, apparently in a 17th-century manifestation. Others believe Rosenkreuz to be a pseudonym for a more famous historical figure, usually Francis Bacon. Steiner gave lectures on Rosenkreutz and Rosicrucianism. Symbolism of the numbers in the Manifestos The Rose Cross, the central symbol to all groups embracing the philosophy of the Rosicrucians. The legend presented in the Manifestos has been interpreted symbolically (as were all hermetic and alchemical texts of those times). They do not directly state Christian Rosenkreuz's years of birth and death, but in two sentences in the second Manifesto the year 1378\\"from the year of Our Lord 1378 (in which year our Christian Father was born)\\", in Confessio Fraternitatis is presented as being the birth year of \\"our Christian Father\\", and it is stated that he lived for 106 years, which would mean he died in 1484.\\"in these one hundred and six years [1484?] of his life\\", Idem The foundation of the Order can be supposed in similar terms to have occurred in the year 1407. However, these numbers (and deduced years) are not taken literally by many students of occultism, who consider them to be allegorical and symbolic statements for the understanding of the Initiated. The justification for this relies on the Manifestos themselves: on the one hand, the Rosicrucians clearly adopted through the Manifestos the Pythagorean tradition of envisioning objects and ideas in terms of their numeric aspects, and, on the other hand, they directly state, \\"We speak unto you by parables, but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy and ingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of all secrets.\\"Cf. Confessio Fraternitatis, the second Rosicrucian Manifesto The metaphorical nature of these legends lends a nebulous quality to the origins of Rosicrucianism. The opening of Rosenkreuz's tomb is thought to be a way of referring to the cycles in nature and to cosmic events; and as well, to the opening of new possibilities for mankind consequent on the advances of the 16th and early 17th centuries. Similarly, Rosenkreuz's pilgrimage seems to refer to the transmutation steps of the Great Work. Similar legends may be found in Wolfram von Eschenbach's description of the Holy Grail as the \\"Lapis Exillis\\", guarded by the Knights Templar, or in the Philosophers' stone of the alchemists, the \\"Lapis Elixir\\".

Tracing garbage collection is the most common type of garbage collection ‚Äì so much so that \\"garbage collection\\" often refers to tracing garbage collection, rather than other methods such as reference counting ‚Äì and there are a large number of algorithms used in implementation.  Reachability of an object  Informally, an object is reachable if it is referenced by at least one variable in the program, either directly or through references from other reachable objects. More precisely, objects can be reachable in only two ways: # A distinguished set of roots: objects that are assumed to be reachable. Typically, these include all the objects referenced from anywhere in the call stack (that is, all local variables and parameters in the functions currently being invoked), and any global variables. # Anything referenced from a reachable object is itself reachable; more formally, reachability is a transitive closure. The reachability definition of \\"garbage\\" is not optimal, insofar as the last time a program uses an object could be long before that object falls out of the environment scope. A distinction is sometimes drawn between syntactic garbage, those objects the program cannot possibly reach, and semantic garbage, those objects the program will in fact never again use. For example: Object x = new Foo(); Object y = new Bar(); x = new Quux(); /* At this point, we know that the Foo object * originally assigned to x will never be * accessed: it is syntactic garbage. */ if (x.check_something()) { x.do_something(y); } System.exit(0); /* In the above block, y *could* be semantic garbage; * but we won't know until x.check_something() returns * some value -- if it returns at all. */ The problem of precisely identifying semantic garbage can easily be shown to be partially decidable: a program that allocates an object X, runs an arbitrary input program P, and uses X if and only if P finishes would require a semantic garbage collector to solve the halting problem. Although conservative heuristic methods for semantic garbage detection remain an active research area, essentially all practical garbage collectors focus on syntactic garbage. Another complication with this approach is that, in languages with both reference types and unboxed value types, the garbage collector needs to somehow be able to distinguish which variables on the stack or fields in an object are regular values and which are references: in memory, an integer and a reference might look alike. The garbage collector then needs to know whether to treat the element as a reference and follow it, or whether it is a primitive value. One common solution is the use of tagged pointers.  Strong and weak references  The garbage collector can reclaim only objects that have no references pointing to them either directly or indirectly from the root set. However, some programs require weak references, which should be usable for as long as the object exists but should not prolong its lifetime. In discussions about weak references, ordinary references are sometimes called strong references. An object is eligible for garbage collection if there are no strong (i.e. ordinary) references to it, even though there still might be some weak references to it. A weak reference is not merely just any pointer to the object that a garbage collector does not care about. The term is usually reserved for a properly managed category of special reference objects which are safe to use even after the object disappears because they lapse to a safe value (usually \`null\`). An unsafe reference that is not known to the garbage collector will simply remain dangling by continuing to refer to the address where the object previously resided. This is not a weak reference. In some implementations, weak references are divided into subcategories. For example, the Java Virtual Machine provides three forms of weak references, namely soft references, phantom references, and regular weak references. A softly referenced object is only eligible for reclamation, if the garbage collector decides that the program is low on memory. Unlike a soft reference or a regular weak reference, a phantom reference does not provide access to the object that it references. Instead, a phantom reference is a mechanism that allows the garbage collector to notify the program when the referenced object has become phantom reachable. An object is phantom reachable, if it still resides in memory and it is referenced by a phantom reference, but its finalizer has already executed. Similarly, Microsoft.NET provides two subcategories of weak references, namely long weak references (tracks resurrection) and short weak references.  Weak collections  Data structures can also be devised which have weak tracking features. For instance, weak hash tables are useful. Like a regular hash table, a weak hash table maintains an association between pairs of objects, where each pair is understood to be a key and value. However, the hash table does not actually maintain a strong reference on these objects. A special behavior takes place when either the key or value or both become garbage: the hash table entry is spontaneously deleted. There exist further refinements such as hash tables which have only weak keys (value references are ordinary, strong references) or only weak values (key references are strong). Weak hash tables are important for maintaining associations between objects, such that the objects engaged in the association can still become garbage if nothing in the program refers to them any longer (other than the associating hash table). The use of a regular hash table for such a purpose could lead to a \\"logical memory leak\\": the accumulation of reachable data which the program does not need and will not use.  Basic algorithm  Tracing collectors are so called because they trace through the working set of memory. These garbage collectors perform collection in cycles. It is common for cycles to be triggered when there is not enough free memory for the memory manager to satisfy an allocation request. But cycles can often be requested by the mutator directly or run on a time schedule. The original method involves a na√Øve mark-and-sweep in which the entire memory set is touched several times.  Na√Øve mark-and-sweep  heap containing eight objects. Arrows represent object references. Circles represent the objects themselves. Objects #1, #2, #3, #4, and #6 are strongly referenced from the root set. On the other hand, objects #5, #7, and #8 are not strongly referenced either directly or indirectly from the root set; therefore, they are garbage. In the naive mark-and-sweep method, each object in memory has a flag (typically a single bit) reserved for garbage collection use only. This flag is always cleared, except during the collection cycle. The first stage is the mark stage which does a tree traversal of the entire 'root set' and marks each object that is pointed to by a root as being 'in-use'. All objects that those objects point to, and so on, are marked as well, so that every object that is reachable via the root set is marked. In the second stage, the sweep stage, all memory is scanned from start to finish, examining all free or used blocks; those not marked as being 'in-use' are not reachable by any roots, and their memory is freed. For objects which were marked in-use, the in-use flag is cleared, preparing for the next cycle. This method has several disadvantages, the most notable being that the entire system must be suspended during collection; no mutation of the working set can be allowed. This can cause programs to 'freeze' periodically (and generally unpredictably), making some real-time and time-critical applications impossible. In addition, the entire working memory must be examined, much of it twice, potentially causing problems in paged memory systems.  Tri-color marking  thumbupright=1.5 An example of tri-color marking on a heap with 8 objects. White, grey, and black objects are represented by light-grey, yellow, and blue, respectively. Because of these performance problems, most modern tracing garbage collectors implement some variant of the tri-color marking abstraction, but simple collectors (such as the mark-and-sweep collector) often do not make this abstraction explicit. Tri-color marking works as described below. Three sets are created white, black and gray: * The white set, or condemned set, is the set of objects that are candidates for having their memory recycled. * The black set is the set of objects that can be shown to have no outgoing references to objects in the white set, and to be reachable from the roots. Objects in the black set are not candidates for collection. * The gray set contains all objects reachable from the roots but yet to be scanned for references to \\"white\\" objects. Since they are known to be reachable from the roots, they cannot be garbage-collected and will end up in the black set after being scanned. In many algorithms, initially the black set starts as empty, the gray set is the set of objects which are directly referenced from roots and the white set includes all other objects. Every object in memory is at all times in exactly one of the three sets. The algorithm proceeds as following: # Pick an object from the gray set and move it to the black set. # Move each white object it references to the gray set. This ensures that neither this object nor any object it references can be garbage-collected. # Repeat the last two steps until the gray set is empty. When the gray set is empty, the scan is complete; the black objects are reachable from the roots, while the white objects are not and can be garbage- collected. Since all objects not immediately reachable from the roots are added to the white set, and objects can only move from white to gray and from gray to black, the algorithm preserves an important invariant no black objects reference white objects. This ensures that the white objects can be freed once the gray set is empty. This is called the tri-color invariant. Some variations on the algorithm do not preserve this invariant but use a modified form for which all the important properties hold. The tri-color method has an important advantage it can be performed \\"on-the-fly\\", without halting the system for significant periods of time. This is accomplished by marking objects as they are allocated and during mutation, maintaining the various sets. By monitoring the size of the sets, the system can perform garbage collection periodically, rather than as needed. Also, the need to touch the entire working set on each cycle is avoided.  Implementation strategies = Moving vs. non-moving  Once the unreachable set has been determined, the garbage collector may simply release the unreachable objects and leave everything else as it is, or it may copy some or all of the reachable objects into a new area of memory, updating all references to those objects as needed. These are called \\"non- moving\\" and \\"moving\\" (or, alternatively, \\"non-compacting\\" and \\"compacting\\") garbage collectors, respectively. At first, a moving algorithm may seem inefficient compared to a non-moving one, since much more work would appear to be required on each cycle. But the moving algorithm leads to several performance advantages, both during the garbage collection cycle itself and during program execution: * No additional work is required to reclaim the space freed by dead objects; the entire region of memory from which reachable objects were moved can be considered free space. In contrast, a non-moving GC must visit each unreachable object and record that the memory it occupied is available. * Similarly, new objects can be allocated very quickly. Since large contiguous regions of memory are usually made available by a moving GC, new objects can be allocated by simply incrementing a 'free memory' pointer. A non-moving strategy may, after some time, lead to a heavily fragmented heap, requiring expensive consultation of \\"free lists\\" of small available blocks of memory in order to allocate new objects. * If an appropriate traversal order is used (such as cdr-first for list conses), objects can be moved very close to the objects they refer to in memory, increasing the chance that they will be located in the same cache line or virtual memory page. This can significantly speed up access to these objects through these references. One disadvantage of a moving garbage collector is that it only allows access through references that are managed by the garbage collected environment, and does not allow pointer arithmetic. This is because any pointers to objects will be invalidated if the garbage collector moves those objects (they become dangling pointers). For interoperability with native code, the garbage collector must copy the object contents to a location outside of the garbage collected region of memory. An alternative approach is to pin the object in memory, preventing the garbage collector from moving it and allowing the memory to be directly shared with native pointers (and possibly allowing pointer arithmetic).  Copying vs. mark-and-sweep vs. mark-and-don't-sweep  Not only do collectors differ in whether they are moving or non-moving, they can also be categorized by how they treat the white, gray and black object sets during a collection cycle. The most straightforward approach is the semi-space collector, which dates to 1969. In this moving collector, memory is partitioned into an equally sized \\"from space\\" and \\"to space\\". Initially, objects are allocated in \\"to space\\" until it becomes full and a collection cycle is triggered. At the start of the cycle, the \\"to space\\" becomes the \\"from space\\", and vice versa. The objects reachable from the root set are copied from the \\"from space\\" to the \\"to space\\". These objects are scanned in turn, and all objects that they point to are copied into \\"to space\\", until all reachable objects have been copied into \\"to space\\". Once the program continues execution, new objects are once again allocated in the \\"to space\\" until it is once again full and the process is repeated. This approach is very simple, but since only one semi space is used for allocating objects, the memory usage is twice as high compared to other algorithms. The technique is also known as stop-and-copy. Cheney's algorithm is an improvement on the semi-space collector. A mark and sweep garbage collector keeps a bit or two with each object to record if it is white or black. The grey set is kept as a separate list or using another bit. As the reference tree is traversed during a collection cycle (the \\"mark\\" phase), these bits are manipulated by the collector. A final \\"sweep\\" of the memory areas then frees white objects. The mark and sweep strategy has the advantage that, once the condemned set is determined, either a moving or non-moving collection strategy can be pursued. This choice of strategy can be made at runtime, as available memory permits. It has the disadvantage of \\"bloating\\" objects by a small amount, as in, every object has a small hidden memory cost because of the list/extra bit. This can be somewhat mitigated if the collector also handles allocation, since then it could potentially use unused bits in the allocation data structures. Or, this \\"hidden memory\\" can be eliminated by using a Tagged pointer, trading the memory cost for CPU time. However, the mark and sweep is the only strategy that readily cooperates with external allocators in the first place. A mark and don't sweep garbage collector, like the mark-and-sweep, keeps a bit with each object to record if it is white or black; the gray set is kept as a separate list or using another bit. There are two key differences here. First, black and white mean different things than they do in the mark and sweep collector. In a \\"mark and don't sweep\\" collector, all reachable objects are always black. An object is marked black at the time it is allocated, and it will stay black even if it becomes unreachable. A white object is unused memory and may be allocated. Second, the interpretation of the black/white bit can change. Initially, the black/white bit may have the sense of (0=white, 1=black). If an allocation operation ever fails to find any available (white) memory, that means all objects are marked used (black). The sense of the black/white bit is then inverted (for example, 0=black, 1=white). Everything becomes white. This momentarily breaks the invariant that reachable objects are black, but a full marking phase follows immediately, to mark them black again. Once this is done, all unreachable memory is white. No \\"sweep\\" phase is necessary. The mark and don't sweep strategy requires cooperation between the allocator and collector, but is incredibly space efficient since it only requires one bit per allocated pointer (which most allocation algorithms require anyway). However, this upside is somewhat mitigated, since most of the time large portions of memory are wrongfully marked black (used), making it hard to give resources back to the system (for use by other allocators, threads, or processes) in times of low memory usage. The mark and don't sweep strategy can therefore be seen as a compromise between the upsides and downsides of the mark and sweep and the stop and copy strategies.  Generational GC (ephemeral GC)  It has been empirically observed that in many programs, the most recently created objects are also those most likely to become unreachable quickly (known as infant mortality or the generational hypothesis). A generational GC (also known as ephemeral GC) divides objects into generations and, on most cycles, will place only the objects of a subset of generations into the initial white (condemned) set. Furthermore, the runtime system maintains knowledge of when references cross generations by observing the creation and overwriting of references. When the garbage collector runs, it may be able to use this knowledge to prove that some objects in the initial white set are unreachable without having to traverse the entire reference tree. If the generational hypothesis holds, this results in much faster collection cycles while still reclaiming most unreachable objects. In order to implement this concept, many generational garbage collectors use separate memory regions for different ages of objects. When a region becomes full, the objects in it are traced, using the references from the older generation(s) as roots. This usually results in most objects in the generation being collected (by the hypothesis), leaving it to be used to allocate new objects. When a collection doesn't collect many objects (the hypothesis doesn't hold, for example because the program has computed a large collection of new objects it does want to retain), some or all of the surviving objects that are referenced from older memory regions are promoted to the next highest region, and the entire region can then be overwritten with fresh objects. This technique permits very fast incremental garbage collection, since the garbage collection of only one region at a time is all that is typically required. Ungar's classic generation scavenger has two generations. It divides the youngest generation, called \\"new space\\", into a large \\"eden\\" in which new objects are created and two smaller \\"survivor spaces\\", past survivor space and future survivor space. The objects in the older generation that may reference objects in new space are kept in a \\"remembered set\\". On each scavenge, the objects in new space are traced from the roots in the remembered set and copied to future survivor space. If future survivor space fills up, the objects that do not fit are promoted to old space, a process called \\"tenuring\\". At the end of the scavenge, some objects reside in future survivor space, and eden and past survivor space are empty. Then future survivor space and past survivor space are exchanged and the program continues, allocating objects in eden. In Ungar's original system, eden is 5 times larger than each survivor space. Generational garbage collection is a heuristic approach, and some unreachable objects may not be reclaimed on each cycle. It may therefore occasionally be necessary to perform a full mark and sweep or copying garbage collection to reclaim all available space. In fact, runtime systems for modern programming languages (such as Java and the .NET Framework) usually use some hybrid of the various strategies that have been described thus far; for example, most collection cycles might look only at a few generations, while occasionally a mark-and-sweep is performed, and even more rarely a full copying is performed to combat fragmentation. The terms \\"minor cycle\\" and \\"major cycle\\" are sometimes used to describe these different levels of collector aggression.  Stop-the-world vs. incremental vs. concurrent  Simple stop-the-world garbage collectors completely halt execution of the program to run a collection cycle, thus guaranteeing that new objects are not allocated and objects do not suddenly become unreachable while the collector is running. This has the obvious disadvantage that the program can perform no useful work while a collection cycle is running (sometimes called the \\"embarrassing pause\\"). Stop-the-world garbage collection is therefore mainly suitable for non-interactive programs. Its advantage is that it is both simpler to implement and faster than incremental garbage collection. Incremental and concurrent garbage collectors are designed to reduce this disruption by interleaving their work with activity from the main program. Incremental garbage collectors perform the garbage collection cycle in discrete phases, with program execution permitted between each phase (and sometimes during some phases). Concurrent garbage collectors do not stop program execution at all, except perhaps briefly when the program's execution stack is scanned. However, the sum of the incremental phases takes longer to complete than one batch garbage collection pass, so these garbage collectors may yield lower total throughput. Careful design is necessary with these techniques to ensure that the main program does not interfere with the garbage collector and vice versa; for example, when the program needs to allocate a new object, the runtime system may either need to suspend it until the collection cycle is complete, or somehow notify the garbage collector that there exists a new, reachable object.  Precise vs. conservative and internal pointers  Some collectors can correctly identify all pointers (references) in an object; these are called precise (also exact or accurate) collectors, the opposite being a conservative or partly conservative collector. Conservative collectors assume that any bit pattern in memory could be a pointer if, interpreted as a pointer, it would point into an allocated object. Conservative collectors may produce false positives, where unused memory is not released because of improper pointer identification. This is not always a problem in practice unless the program handles a lot of data that could easily be misidentified as a pointer. False positives are generally less problematic on 64-bit systems than on 32-bit systems because the range of valid memory addresses tends to be a tiny fraction of the range of 64-bit values. Thus, an arbitrary 64-bit pattern is unlikely to mimic a valid pointer. A false negative can also happen if pointers are \\"hidden\\", for example using an XOR linked list. Whether a precise collector is practical usually depends on the type safety properties of the programming language in question. An example for which a conservative garbage collector would be needed is the C language, which allows typed (non-void) pointers to be type cast into untyped (void) pointers, and vice versa. A related issue concerns internal pointers, or pointers to fields within an object. If the semantics of a language allow internal pointers, then there may be many different addresses that can refer to parts of the same object, which complicates determining whether an object is garbage or not. An example for this is the C++ language, in which multiple inheritance can cause pointers to base objects to have different addresses. In a tightly optimized program, the corresponding pointer to the object itself may have been overwritten in its register, so such internal pointers need to be scanned.  Performance  Performance of tracing garbage collectors ‚Äì both latency and throughput ‚Äì depends significantly on the implementation, workload, and environment. Naive implementations or use in very memory-constrained environments, notably embedded systems, can result in very poor performance compared with other methods, while sophisticated implementations and use in environments with ample memory can result in excellent performance. In terms of throughput, tracing by its nature requires some implicit runtime overhead, though in some cases the amortized cost can be extremely low, in some cases even lower than one instruction per allocation or collection, outperforming stack allocation. Manual memory management requires overhead due to explicit freeing of memory, and reference counting has overhead from incrementing and decrementing reference counts, and checking if the count has overflowed or dropped to zero. In terms of latency, simple stop- the-world garbage collectors pause program execution for garbage collection, which can happen at arbitrary times and take arbitrarily long, making them unusable for real-time computing, notably embedded systems, and a poor fit for interactive use, or any other situation where low latency is a priority. However, incremental garbage collectors can provide hard real-time guarantees, and on systems with frequent idle time and sufficient free memory, such as personal computers, garbage collection can be scheduled for idle times and have minimal impact on interactive performance. Manual memory management (as in C++) and reference counting have a similar issue of arbitrarily long pauses in case of deallocating a large data structure and all its children, though these only occur at fixed times, not depending on garbage collection. ; Manual heap allocation: * search for best/first-fit block of sufficient size * free list maintenance ; Garbage collection: * locate reachable objects * copy reachable objects for moving collectors * read/write barriers for incremental collectors * search for best/first-fit block and free list maintenance for non-moving collectors It is difficult to compare the two cases directly, as their behavior depends on the situation. For example, in the best case for a garbage collecting system, allocation just increments a pointer, but in the best case for manual heap allocation, the allocator maintains freelists of specific sizes and allocation only requires following a pointer. However, this size segregation usually cause a large degree of external fragmentation, which can have an adverse impact on cache behaviour. Memory allocation in a garbage collected language may be implemented using heap allocation behind the scenes (rather than simply incrementing a pointer), so the performance advantages listed above don't necessarily apply in this case. In some situations, most notably embedded systems, it is possible to avoid both garbage collection and heap management overhead by preallocating pools of memory and using a custom, lightweight scheme for allocation/deallocation. The overhead of write barriers is more likely to be noticeable in an imperative-style program which frequently writes pointers into existing data structures than in a functional- style program which constructs data only once and never changes them. Some advances in garbage collection can be understood as reactions to performance issues. Early collectors were stop-the-world collectors, but the performance of this approach was distracting in interactive applications. Incremental collection avoided this disruption, but at the cost of decreased efficiency due to the need for barriers. Generational collection techniques are used with both stop-the-world and incremental collectors to increase performance; the trade-off is that some garbage is not detected as such for longer than normal.  Determinism  * Tracing garbage collection is not deterministic in the timing of object finalization. An object which becomes eligible for garbage collection will usually be cleaned up eventually, but there is no guarantee when (or even if) that will happen. This is an issue for program correctness when objects are tied to non-memory resources, whose release is an externally visible program behavior, such as closing a network connection, releasing a device or closing a file. One garbage collection technique which provides determinism in this regard is reference counting. * Garbage collection can have a nondeterministic impact on execution time, by potentially introducing pauses into the execution of a program which are not correlated with the algorithm being processed. Under tracing garbage collection, the request to allocate a new object can sometimes return quickly and at other times trigger a lengthy garbage collection cycle. Under reference counting, whereas allocation of objects is usually fast, decrementing a reference is nondeterministic, since a reference may reach zero, triggering recursion to decrement the reference counts of other objects which that object holds.  Real-time garbage collection  While garbage collection is generally nondeterministic, it is possible to use it in hard real-time systems. A real- time garbage collector should guarantee that even in the worst case it will dedicate a certain number of computational resources to mutator threads. Constraints imposed on a real-time garbage collector are usually either work based or time based. A time based constraint would look like: within each time window of duration T, mutator threads should be allowed to run at least for Tm time. For work based analysis, MMU (minimal mutator utilization) is usually used as a real-time constraint for the garbage collection algorithm. One of the first implementations of hard real-time garbage collection for the JVM was based on the Metronome algorithm, whose commercial implementation is available as part of the IBM WebSphere Real Time. Another hard real-time garbage collection algorithm is Staccato, available in the IBM's J9 JVM, which also provides scalability to large multiprocessor architectures, while bringing various advantages over Metronome and other algorithms which, on the contrary, require specialized hardware.

Guy was the son of William de Beauchamp, the first Beauchamp earl of Warwick, and succeeded his father in 1298. He distinguished himself at the Battle of Falkirk and subsequently, as a capable servant of the crown under King Edward I. After the succession of Edward II in 1307, however, he soon fell out with the new king and the king's favourite, Piers Gaveston. Warwick was one of the main architects behind the Ordinances of 1311, that limited the powers of the king and banished Gaveston into exile. When Gaveston returned to England in 1312contrary to the rulings of the Ordinanceshe was taken into custody by Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. Warwick abducted Gaveston and, together with Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, had him executed. The act garnered sympathy and support for the king, but Warwick and Lancaster nevertheless managed to negotiate a royal pardon for their actions. After the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, King Edward's authority was once more weakened, and the rebellious barons took over control of government. For Warwick the triumph was brief; he died the next year. Guy de Beauchamp is today remembered primarily for his part in the killing of Gaveston, but by his contemporaries he was considered a man of exceptionally good judgement and learning. He owned what was for his time a large collection of books, and his advice was often sought by many of the other earls. Next to Lancaster, he was the wealthiest peer in the nation, and after his death his lands and title were inherited by his son, Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick.  Family background  Seal of Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick, as appended to the Barons' Letter, 1301. The arms shown are those of Newburgh, the family of his predecessors the Beaumont Earls of Warwick. The Beauchamps frequently quartered their own arms with those of Newburgh, on occasion placing the latter in the 1st & 4th quarters, positions of greatest honour Rolls of Arms, incl. Collins' Roll, c. 1296 Guy de Beauchamp was the first son and heir of William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick, (c. 12381298). His mother was Maud FitzJohn, daughter of John fitz Geoffrey, who was Justiciar of Ireland and a member of the council of fifteen that imposed the Provisions of Oxford on King Henry III. William was the nephew of William Maudit, 8th Earl of Warwick, and when his uncle died without issue in 1268, he became the first Beauchamp earl of Warwick. In 1271 or 1272 his first son was born, and in reference to the new family title, William named his son after the legendary hero Guy of Warwick. William de Beauchamp was a capable military commander, who played an important part in the Welsh and Scottish wars of King Edward I. A marriage between Guy and Isabel de Clare, daughter of Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, was contemplated, or possibly even took place and then annulled. It was not until early 1309 that Guy married Alice de Toeni, a wealthy Hertfordshire heiress. By this time Guy had already succeeded as Earl of Warwick, after his father's death in 1298. By his wife, Alice, Guy had two sons, Thomas, his heir and successor, and John de Beauchamp, Lord Beauchamp KG (13152 December 1360); he carried the royal standard at the Battle of Crecy, and two daughters, *Maud de Beauchamp (died 1366), married before Easter term 1332 Geoffrey de Say, 2nd Lord Say, by whom she had issue. The Barons Saye and Sele are their descendants. *Elizabeth de Beauchamp (c. 13161359), married before Easter term 1332 Thomas Astley, 3rd Lord Astley, by whom she had two sons, William Astley, 4th Lord Astley and Sir Thomas Astley, ancestor of the Astleys of Patshull and of Everley. By an unknown mistress (or mistresses), Earl Guy also had three daughters: *Isabel de Beauchamp; married John de Clinton. *Emma de Beauchamp; married Roland de Oddingseles. *Lucia de Beauchamp (also known as Lucy); married Robert de Napton, Knt.Americans of Royal Descent: Collection of Genealogies Showing the Lineal Descent from Kings of Some American Families By Charles Henry Browning The son of Sir Adam NaptonA History of the County of Warwick: Volume 6, Knightlow Hundred.Originally published by Victoria County History, London, 1951 Lucia and Sir Robert had a son Adam Napton;Magna Charta Barons and Their Descendants By Charles Henry Browning he married Margaret HelierThe antiquities of Warwickshire By Sir William Dugdale  Service to Edward I  Edward I knighted Guy de Beauchamp at Easter 1296.Cokayne (1910‚Äì59), xii, pp. 370-2. Warwick's career of public service started with the Falkirk campaign in 1298. Here he distinguished himself, and received a reward of Scottish lands worth 1000 marks a year.Maddicott (1970), p. 69. At this point his father was already dead, but it was not until 5 September that Guy did homage to the king for his lands, and became Earl of Warwick and hereditary High Sheriff of Worcestershire for life. He continued in the king's service in Scotland and elsewhere. In 1299 he was present at the king's wedding to Margaret of France at Canterbury, and in 1300 he took part in the Siege of Caerlaverock Castle. The next year he was a signatory to a letter to the Pope, rejecting Rome's authority over the Scottish question, and also participated in negotiations with the French over the release of the Scottish King John Balliol. He was present at the Siege of Stirling in 1304, serving under Edward, the Prince of Wales. In March 1307 he made preparations to accompany Prince Edward to France, but this journey never took place. Early in 1307, Edward I made his last grant to Warwick, when he gave him John Balliol's forfeited lordship of Barnard Castle in County Durham. On 7 July that year, near Burgh by Sands in Cumberland, Warwick was present when King Edward died.Prestwich (1997), p. 24. Together with Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, he carried the ceremonial swords at the coronation of King Edward II on 25 February 1308.  Conflict with Edward II  Before his death, the old king had exiled Prince Edward's favourite Piers Gaveston, and Warwick was among those charged with preventing Gaveston's return. The new king, however, not only recalled his favourite, but soon also gave him the title of earl of Cornwall. Warwick was the only one of the leading earls who did not seal the charter, and from the start took on an antagonistic attitude to Edward II. Gaveston was a relative upstart in the English aristocracy, and made himself unpopular among the established nobility by his arrogance and his undue influence on the king. He gave mocking nicknames to the leading men of the realm, and called Warwick the \\"Black Dog of Arden\\". Warwick was in constant opposition to King Edward II. Great seal of Edward II Gaveston was once more forced into exile, but Edward recalled him in less than a year. The king had spent the intervening time gathering support, and at the time, the only one to resist the return of Gaveston was Warwick.Maddicott (1970), p. 90. With time, however, opposition to the king grew. Another source of contention was Edward abandoning his father's Scottish campaigns, a policy that opened the Border region up to devastating raids from the Scots.Maddicott (1970), pp. 108-9. This affected Warwick greatly, with his extensive landed interest in the north.Maddicott (1970), pp. 72, 111, 325. Tensions grew to the point where the king in 1310 had to ban Warwick and others from arriving at parliament in arms. They still did, and at the parliament of March 1310, the king was forced to accept the appointment of a commission to draft a set of ordinances towards reform the royal government. The leaders of these so-called Lords Ordainers were Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, on the side of the clergy, and Warwick, Lincoln and Lancaster among the earls.McKisack (1959), p. 10. Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, was the most experienced of the earls, and took on a modifying role in the group.Phillips (1972), p. 9. Thomas of Lancaster, who was Lincoln's son-in-law and heir, was the king's cousin and the wealthiest nobleman in the realm, but at this point he took a less active part in the reform movement.Maddicott (1970), pp. 9, 84-7. Warwick is described by some sources as the leader of the Ordainers; he was certainly the most aggressive. The set of Ordinances they drafted put heavy restrictions on the king's financial freedom, and his right to appoint his own ministers. It alsoonce moreordered Gaveston to be exiled, to return only at the risk of excommunication.The text of the Ordinances can be found in  Gaveston's death  Gaveston's third and final exile was of even shorter duration, and after two months, he was reunited with King Edward II in England. Archbishop Winchelsey responded by excommunicating Gaveston, as the Ordinances had stipulated.Hamilton (1988), p. 94. Lancaster, who had by this time succeeded his father-in-law Lincoln, had taken over leadership of the baronial opposition.Maddicott (1970), p. 119. While the King departed for York, a number of the barons set out in pursuit of Gaveston. Gaveston ensconced himself at Scarborough Castle, and on 19 May 1312, agreed on a surrender to Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, as long as his security would be guaranteed.Hamilton (1988), p. 96. Pembroke lodged his prisoner in Deddington in Oxfordshire. On 10 June, while Pembroke was away, Warwick forcibly carried away Gaveston to Warwick Castle.Hamilton (1988), p. 97. Here, in the presence of Warwick, Lancaster and other magnates, Gaveston was sentenced to death at an improvised court. On 19 June he was taken to a place called Blacklow Hillon Lancaster's landsand decapitated. According to the Annales Londonienses chronicle, four shoemakers brought the corpse back to Warwick, but he refused to accept it, and ordered them to take it back to where they found it.Hamilton (1988), p. 99. Gaveston's body was eventually taken to Oxford by some Dominican friars, and in 1315, King Edward finally had it buried at Kings Langley. The brutality and questionable legality of the earls' actions helped win political sympathy for the king.McKisack (1959), pp. 28-9. Pembroke was particularly offended, as he had been made to break his promise of safety to Gaveston, and his chivalric honour had been damaged. From this point on Pembroke sided firmly with King Edward in the political conflict.Phillips (1972), pp. 36-7. The king himself swore vengeance on his enemies, but found himself unable to move against them immediately, partly because they were in possession of a number of highly valuable royal jewels taken from Gaveston.Maddicott (1970), 130-54. A settlement was reached in October, whereby the rebellious barons and their retainers received a pardon.McKisack (1959), p. 30. The king nevertheless emerged strengthened from the events, while Warwick and Lancaster were largely marginalised.Maddicott (1970), p. 158-9. This all changed in 1314, when the king decided to stage his first major campaign against the Scots. Warwick and Lancaster refused to participate and the campaign ended in a humiliating English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June. This led to another political reversal and Edward was forced to reconfirm the Ordinances, and submit to the leadership of the rebellious barons.Prestwich (2005), p. 190.  Death and historical assessment  The coat of arms of the Beauchamp family In mid-July Warwick had to withdraw from government to his estates on account of illness.Phillips (1972), p. 92. When he died on 12 August 1315, political leadership was soon left almost entirely to Lancaster. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham reported rumours that the king had had Warwick poisoned.Maddicott (1970), p. 170. He was buried at Bordesley Abbey in Worcestershire, an establishment to which his family had been benefactors. In value, his possessions were second only to those of the earl of Lancaster among the nobility of England. His lands, though primarily centred on Warwickshire and Worcestershire, were spread over nineteen counties as well as Scotland and the Welsh Marches. His heir was his eldest son, whom he had named Thomas after the earl of Lancaster. Thomas, born probably on 14 February 1314, did not succeed to his father's title until 1326, as Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick.Cokayne (1910‚Äì59), xii, pp. 372-5. In the meanwhile Warwick's possessions went into the hands of the king, who donated Warwick's hunting dogs to the earl of Pembroke.Phillips (1972), p. 94. A younger son, named John, also became a peer, as John de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp. Like his elder brother, he distinguished himself in the French wars, and was a founding member of the Order of the Garter.Cokayne (1910‚Äì59), ii, pp. 50-1. Guy de Beauchamp is probably best remembered for his opposition to King Edward II, and for his part in the death of Gaveston. To contemporaries, however, he was considered a man of considerable learning and wisdom. His library, of which he donated 42 books to Bordesley Abbey during his lifetime, was extensive. It contained several saints' lives as well as romances about Alexander and King Arthur. As mentioned, Edward I entrusted the supervision of his son to Warwick. Likewise, when the earl of Lincoln died in 1311, he supposedly instructed his son-in-law Thomas of Lancaster to heed the advice of Warwick, \\"the wisest of the peers\\".Maddicott (1970), p. 115. Chronicles also praised Warwick's wisdom; the Vita Edwardi Secundi says that \\"Other earls did many things only after taking his opinion: in wisdom and council he had no peer\\". Later historians have reflected this view, in the 19th century William Stubbs called Warwick \\"a discriminating and highly literate man, the wisdom of whom shone forth through the whole kingdom\\". He was politically and economically well connected by traditional ties of kinship and marriage. Warwick's death came at an inconvenient time and Thomas of Lancaster proved unequal to the task of governing the nation, so that further years of conflict and instability followed. Nevertheless, the problems of Edward II's reign were deep, and in the words of Michael Hicks: \\"one must doubt whether even Warwick could have brought unity as one chronicler supposed\\".

It offers some of the prominent horse racing events in the United States during early fall, winter and in spring. The track is home to numerous prestigious races including both the Santa Anita Derby and the Santa Anita Handicap as well as hosting the Breeders' Cup in 1986, 1993, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019. Since 2011, The Stronach Group are the current owners. History Santa Anita Park was originally part of \\"Rancho Santa Anita\\", which was owned originally by former San Gabriel Mission Mayor- Domo, Claudio Lopez, and named after a family member, \\"Anita Cota\\". The ranch was later acquired by rancher Hugo Reid, a Scotsman. Later, it was owned by multimillionaire horse breeder and racer Lucky Baldwin. Baldwin initially built a racetrack adjacent to the present site in what is today Arcadia, outside of the city of Los Angeles, in 1904. It closed in 1909 and burned down in 1912. In 1933, California legalized parimutuel wagering and several investor groups worked to open racetracks. In the San Francisco area, a group headed by Dr. Charles H \\"Doc\\" Strub was having trouble locating a site. In the Los Angeles area, a group headed by movie producer Hal Roach was in need of further funds. These two groups combined and the newly formed Los Angeles Turf Club opened the present day track on Christmas Day in 1934, making it the first formally-established racetrack in California. Architect Gordon Kaufmann designed its various buildings in a combination of Colonial Revival and a type of art deco known as Streamline Modern, painted primarily in Santa Anita's signature colors of Persian Green and Chiffon Yellow. In February 1935, the first Santa Anita Handicap was run. The race's $100,000 purse, largest of any race ever in the United States until that time, produced its nickname the Big 'Cap. Art deco entrance to Santa Anita's grandstands. In its heyday, the track's races attracted such stars Betty Grable, Lana Turner, Edgar Bergen, Jane Russell, Cary Grant, Esther Williams, and other stars. Bing Crosby, Joe E. Brown, Al Jolson, and Harry Warner were all stockholders. The unique downhill turf course includes a section where horses have to momentarily cross the dirt track In 1940, Seabiscuit won the Santa Anita Handicap in his last start. In 1942, racing at Santa Anita was suspended due to the Second World War. Santa Anita was used as an \\"assembly center\\" for Japanese Americans excluded from the West Coast. (See below.) For several months in 1942, over 18,000 people lived in horse stables and military-style barracks constructed on the site, including actor George Takei, then a young boy. After the track reopened in 1945, it went through the postwar years with prosperity. A downhill turf course, which added a distinctly European flair to racing at Santa Anita, was added in 1953. Due to its proximity to Los Angeles, Santa Anita has traditionally been associated with the film and television industries. The racetrack sequences in the Marx Brothers 1937 classic A Day at the Races were filmed there, and The Story of Seabiscuit with Shirley Temple was filmed on location in 1949. It was also featured in A Star Is Born (1937).Alleman, Richard (2013). Hollywood: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie L.A. Crown/Archetype. Page 471. . Several stars, including Bing Crosby, Spencer Tracy, Errol Flynn, Alex Trebek, and MGM mogul, Louis B. Mayer, have owned horses that raced at the park. The 1958 Santa Anita Derby was attended by 61,123 people, making the attendance that day a record crowd. They had come to watch Silky Sullivan come from 28 lengths off the pace and win‚Äîgoing away. The 1960s brought about a major renovation of Santa Anita Park, including a much-expanded grandstand as well as major seating additions. In 1968, Del Mar Racetrack relinquished its dates for a fall meeting. A group of horsemen including Clement Hirsch intervened and established the not-for-profit Oak Tree Racing Association. Oak Tree had no facilities of its own and rented Santa Anita Park for its first autumn meeting in 1969. The Oak Tree Association became the operator of the autumn meet at Santa Anita Park. This meet usually ran from the end of September until early November. Many key stakes races were held during the Oak Tree Meeting, including many preps to the Breeders' Cup races. The Oak Tree meet relocated to Hollywood Park for 2010\\"Oak Tree Headed for Hollywood After All\\", The Blood-Horse, August 19, 2010. but the California Horse Racing Board awarded the fall dates to Santa Anita in its own right in 2011. This prompted a renaming of many stakes races held at the fall meeting that were formerly associated with Oak Tree. For example, the Norfolk, Goodwood, Yellow Ribbon, Lady's Secret, and Oak Leaf, were renamed at the FrontRunner, Awesome Again, Rodeo Drive, Zenyatta and Chandelier respectively. Prosperity continued at Santa Anita throughout the 1970s and the 1980s. In 1984, Santa Anita was the site of equestrian events at the 1984 Olympics.1984 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 1. Part 1. pp. 117-20. The following year, the track set an attendance record of 85,527 people on Santa Anita Handicap Day. However, recognizing the potential revenue boon to the State of California, the California Legislature expanded off track betting, bring operating betting parlors within closer driving distance of the race-day tracks. While the Santa Anita meeting could still draw large crowds, attendance had decreased by a third. Only 56,810 people were at the park for Santa Anita Derby Day 2007 to witness a Grade I event.

Washington Ornamental Iron Company built all of Santa Anita's facilities. Lily Okuru, a Japanese American woman who lived on the site during its time as a War Relocation Camp, poses with Seabiscuit statue, 1942. In 1997, Santa Anita Park was acquired by Meditrust when it purchased the Santa Anita Companies for its unique real estate investment trust paired share corporate structure. Following the elimination of the special tax treatment accorded Pair Share REITs, Meditrust sold the track to Magna Entertainment Corp. In 2006, Gulfstream Park and Santa Anita cohosted the Sunshine Millions, a day of competition with $3.6 million in stakes races between horses bred in the State of Florida and those bred in the State of California. At Santa Anita standardbred racing was also conducted. At Santa Anita Park's European-style paddock there are statues of jockeys George Woolf, Johnny Longden, Bill Shoemaker and Laffit Pincay, Jr. plus a memorial bust of announcer Joe Hernandez and one of trainer Charlie Whittingham with his dog, Toby. There is also a lifesize bronze of Seabiscuit in the walking ring at Seabiscuit Court; a similar bronze of John Henry was unveiled near the Seabiscuit statue in December 2009. Buried near the paddock is Emperor of Norfolk, the best horse Lucky Baldwin ever owned, along with three other great Baldwin horses: Volante, Silver Cloud, and Rey El Santa Anita, all four of them winners of the prestigious American Derby. In 2012, a lifesize bronze of Zenyatta was unveiled prior to the running of the race renamed in her honor. Since 1950, Santa Anita Park has annually presented the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award to a rider who demonstrates high standards of personal and professional conduct, on and off the racetrack. South African native Trevor Denman served as Santa Anita's full-time announcer from the 1983 Oak Tree meet until his retirement from the position in 2015. Denman is noted for his calls beginning with \\"And awaaay they go...\\" and his distinctive gravelly voice. Queensland, Australia native Michael Wrona was chosen to succeed Denman in March 2016, and continued through fall 2018. Frank Mirahmadi took over after that. Starting in 2014, Santa Anita began adding more racing cards due to the closure of Hollywood Park Racetrack, hosting Hollywood Park's old spring dates from late April until June. In mid-March 2020, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, racing resumed without fans; two weeks later, racing was suspended until it returned on Friday, May 15, 2020. Horse fatalities of 2019 In early March 2019, all races were cancelled following the 21st fatality of the winter season; racing resumed late in the month. Races were postponed so that the dirt surface could be studied. Seven of the 21 deaths occurred during races on the dirt oval with nine happening during training on dirt and the others occurring on the turf track. Thirty-seven horses died at the facility in 2019, causing the above noted suspension of races, and resulting in the California Racing Commission considering rule changes.Ben Bergman, \\"Racing Continues at Santa Anita Park Amid Mounting Pressure to Suspend Competition After Spate of Horse Deaths\\", KQED, 5 April 2019.\\"Santa Anita racetrack won't close after 2 more horses die, 29 overall since December,\\" CBS News, 10 June 2019.\\"33rd horse dies at Santa Anita Park since December,\\" KABC-TV, 6 October 2019.Libby Cathey, \\"Another racehorse dies at Santa Anita Park, raising death toll to 35 since December,\\" ABCNews, 26 October 2019.\\"15-1 longshot Mongolian Groom fatally injured in Breeders‚Äô Cup Classic,\\" Associated Press, 3 November 2019.

Santa Anita Assembly Center A panoramic view of the Santa Anita Assembly Center. In February 1942, after President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized military commanders to exclude \\"any or all persons\\" from certain areas in the name of national defense, the Western Defense Command began ordering Japanese Americans living on the West Coast to present themselves for \\"evacuation\\" from the newly created military zones. Seventeen temporary \\"assembly centers\\" were designated to house the evicted population until construction on the more permanent and isolated internment camps was finished. Most, like the Santa Anita assembly center, were converted from former uses like racing tracks or fairgrounds.Linke, Konrad. \\"Santa Anita (detention facility)\\" Densho Encyclopedia. Retrieved 2014-07-25. Santa Anita was turned over to the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the government body responsible for oversight of the temporary detention facilities, in March 1942, and army engineers soon after built 500 barracks on the parking lot and converted the horse stables and the area underneath the grandstand into residential \\"apartments\\". Inmates began arriving in April, most coming from the surrounding Los Angeles County, and the center's population soon topped 18,000, peaking at 18,719 by August of that year. Six mess halls, each seating approximately 850 at a time, fed some 3,000 people daily at a cost of 33 cents per inmate. The sanitary facilities faced similar overcrowding, with a ratio of 30 inmates to each shower after the number of showers was increased from 150 to 225 in early July. Consequently, inmates spent a significant portion of their time in Santa Anita waiting in line for meals or to use the sanitary facilities. The Assembly Center remained open for seven months, and in the meantime, inmates took up jobs in camp at the camouflage net factory, the hospital or various administrative departments, and set up schools to ensure their children's education would not be interrupted. Transfer to War Relocation Authority camps began on August 26, 1942, when 901 inmates left for Poston, Arizona, and over the next month the remaining Japanese Americans were sent to Poston and several other camps. The Santa Anita Assembly Center closed on October 27, 1942. Course attributes The Santa Anita track is set against the backdrop of the San Gabriel Mountains.Santa Anita has a one-mile (1,609 m) natural dirt main track which rings a turf course measuring 0.9 mile, or . In addition, it has an unusual hillside turf course which crosses the dirt and had been used mainly to run turf races at a distance of \\"about\\" 6¬Ω furlongs (exact distance is ), as well as longer races at 1¬º miles, 1¬Ω miles and about 1¬æ miles. This type of track is one of the few of its kind in America. In August 2020, Santa Anita broke ground on a new backstretch turf chute. The new turf chute is expected to be finished in time for the 2020/2021 winter meet, and will be used primarily for turf sprints at distances up to 6¬Ω furlongs. Santa Anita effectively ended downhill turf sprints following an incident in the 2019 San Simeon Stakes; under their plans, the hillside turf course will continue to be used for distance races. To comply with a State of California mandate, Santa Anita replaced its dirt racing surface with a new synthetic surface called Cushion Track, a mixture of silica sand, synthetic fibers, elastic fiber, granulated rubber and a wax coating. The new Cushion Track opened for training on Sept 4, 2007 and hosted its first live race on Sept 26, 2007. The track lost 11 racing dates in 2008 due to a drainage problem with the new material, but intensive maintenance and the addition of a liquid binder greatly improved the artificial surface. Santa Anita replaced the artificial surface with a return to an all natural dirt surface in December 2010. Santa Anita occupies . It has a -long grandstand, which is a historic landmark that seats 26,000 guests. The grandstand facade is rendered in an Art Deco style and is largely the original from the 1930s.National Trust for Historic Preservation, Santa Anita racetrack, 2000. The track infield area, which resembles a park with picnic tables and large trees, can accommodate 50,000 or more guests. The Park also contains 61 barns, which house more than 2,000 horses, and an equine hospital. Endangerment and reprieve In 2000, the racetrack was named to America's \\"Most Endangered Historic Places\\" list. The Santa Anita Racetrack was determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in 2006, but continued to be threatened by developer's plans. A themed entertainment complex proposal was aborted, but there were new plans are in the works for the parking and support areas adjacent to the historic race track and grandstands. In 2006, there was a proposal to close Santa Anita Park and use its location as the site of a new retail/entertainment complex. The Arcadia City Council approved a plan In April 2007 to develop an 830,000 square foot commercial, retail, and office complex in the south parking area, where the barracks that housed interned Japanese Americans during World War II are located. The proposal planned to tear down the South Ticket Gate and the 1938 Saddling Barn, and to install a simulcast facility in the center of the historic grandstand. In April 2008, a plan was approved to use large parts of the existing track parking lot to construct a mall, the \\"Shops at Santa Anita\\".\\"Acadia OKs Caruso Mall Near Racetrack\\" , Los Angeles Times, April 18, 2007. , the plans to build another mall next to Santa Anita Park were abandoned. Protests against the project by the Westfield group, owner of the adjacent Westfield Santa Anita Mall (built in 1974 on the site of the old barns and training track), and the bankruptcy of Magna International, owner of Santa Anita Park, were a factor in the decision.

In the above map, The largest area, shaded in green, drains into the Wabash River. Of the other watersheds, the blue areas drain into Lake Michigan, the yellow area drains into the Illinois River, the pink area drains into the Maumee River, the gray area drains into the Ohio river. Illinois River watershed With the Kankakee River, the Illinois River watershed stretches from the Illinois border in northwest Indiana and up into Michigan's Berrien County, adjacent to St. Joseph County. This drainage area include most of the state known as the Northwest Indiana, including the city of La Porte but excluding the area north of the Valparaiso Moraine which drains into Lake Michigan. Lake Michigan watersheds There are two watersheds in the state that drain into Lake Michigan. In the northwest part of the state, it includes the Grand Calumet River area in Lake and Porter counties, and includes the cities of Gary and Hammond. This watershed is defined by the Valparaiso Moraine. The second, and larger Lake Michigan watershed is the St. Joseph River watershed, which drains the north central and northeastern part of the state. It includes the cities of South Bend, Elkhart, Mishawaka and Goshen. Maumee River watershed The smallest watershed in the state is the Maumee River watershed in the northeast part of the state on the border with Ohio. It includes most of the city of Fort Wayne as well as the cities of New Haven, Woodburn, and Auburn. The Maumee eventually empties into Lake Erie at Toledo, Ohio. Ohio River watershed The Ohio River watershed includes the extreme southern part of the state as well as the extreme southwestern Indiana counties. This drainage area includes the cities of Evansville, Richmond and New Albany as well as the Indiana suburbs of Cincinnati, Ohio. Wabash River watershed By far the largest watershed in the state, the Wabash River drainage area contains the several large cities, including Indianapolis and the extreme western part of Fort Wayne. Other cities included in the area are Bloomington, Muncie, Lafayette, Anderson and Terre Haute. This watershed also includes most of Indiana's prime farm land. The area within the Lower Wabash Valley is also known as \\"Watermelon Country\\", largely due to its sandy soil on which watermelons and cantaloupes thrive. Cities within this area include Vincennes, Sullivan. Many towns of this area have \\"Watermelon Festivals\\" such as Owensville, Poseyville and Vincennes (Knox County) usually at harvest time (first weeks of August).

His reputation as a military leader was so formidable that he was nicknamed 'the devil Warwick' by the French. In 1348 he became one of the founders and the third Knight of the Order of the Garter. Thomas was undoubtably a brave warrior in battle and proved to be a strong military leader. For example, the 14th century Anonimalle Chronicle states that when news arrived of his landing at Calais, the Duke of Burgundy, whose forces were camped nearby, made a hasty retreat under cover of darkness to avoid an encounter with 'the devil Warwick'. He fought in Scotland as Captain of the army against the Scots in 1337 at the age of 24. He also fought in the Hundred Years Wars with France, commanding the English victory at the Battle of Crecy in 1346.

He displays the arms of Beauchamp on his tunic Thomas de Beauchamp was born at Warwick Castle, Warwickshire, England to Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick and Alice de Toeni. He served in Scotland frequently during the 1330s, being captain of the army against the Scots in 1337. He was hereditary High Sheriff of Worcestershire from 1333 until his death (in 1369). In 1344, he was also made High Sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire for life. Victor at Cr√©cy and Poitiers Warwick was Marshal of England from 1343/4 until 1369, and was one of the commanders at the great English victories at Cr√©cy and Poitiers. Thomas de Beauchamp fought in all the French wars of King Edward III; he commanded the centre at the Battle of Crecy (where many of his relatives were killed, including his younger half-brother Alan la Zouche de Mortimer). He was trusted to be guardian of the sixteen-year-old Black Prince. Beauchamp fought at Poitiers in 1356 and at the Siege of Calais (1346). He began the rebuilding of the Collegiate Church of Saint Mary in Warwick supposedly using money received from the ransom of the archbishop of Sens who he captured at Poitiers, but that is an over-simplification. He died of plague in Calais on 13 November 1369 and was entombed along with his wife Katherine, countess of Warwick, in the chancel of St Mary's Warwick.

In many cases, bioremediation is less expensive and more sustainable than other remediation alternatives. Biological treatment is a similar approach used to treat wastes including wastewater, industrial waste and solid waste. Most bioremediation processes involve oxidation-reduction reactions where either an electron acceptor (commonly oxygen) is added to stimulate oxidation of a reduced pollutant (e.g. hydrocarbons) or an electron donor (commonly an organic substrate) is added to reduce oxidized pollutants (nitrate, perchlorate, oxidized metals, chlorinated solvents, explosives and propellants). In both these approaches, additional nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and pH buffers may be added to optimize conditions for the microorganisms. In some cases, specialized microbial cultures are added (bioaugmentation) to further enhance biodegradation. Some examples of bioremediation related technologies are phytoremediation, mycoremediation, bioventing, bioleaching, landfarming, bioreactor, composting, bioaugmentation, rhizofiltration, and biostimulation. Chemistry Most bioremediation processes involve oxidation-reduction (Redox) reactions where a chemical species donates an electron (electron donor) to a different species that accepts the electron (electron acceptor). During this process, the electron donor is said to be oxidized while the electron acceptor is reduced. Common electron acceptors in bioremediation processes include oxygen, nitrate, manganese (III and IV), iron (III), sulfate, carbon dioxide and some pollutants (chlorinated solvents, explosives, oxidized metals, and radionuclides). Electron donors include sugars, fats, alcohols, natural organic material, fuel hydrocarbons and a variety of reduced organic pollutants.

Oxygen is generally the preferred electron acceptor because of the higher energy yield and because oxygen is required for some enzyme systems to initiate the degradation process. Numerous laboratory and field studies have shown that microorganisms can degrade a wide variety of hydrocarbons, including components of gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and jet fuel. Under ideal conditions, the biodegradation rates of the low- to moderate-weight aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic compounds can be very high. As the molecular weight of the compound increases, so does the resistance to biodegradation. Common approaches for providing oxygen above the water table include landfarming, composting and bioventing. During landfarming, contaminated soils, sediments, or sludges are incorporated into the soil surface and periodically turned over (tilled) using conventional agricultural equipment to aerate the mixture. Composting accelerates pollutant biodegradation by mixing the waste to be treated with a bulking agent, forming into piles, and periodically mixed to increase oxygen transfer. Bioventing is a process that increases the oxygen or air flow into the unsaturated zone of the soil which increases the rate of natural in situ degradation of the targeted hydrocarbon contaminant. Approaches for oxygen addition below the water table include recirculating aerated water through the treatment zone, addition of pure oxygen or peroxides, and air sparging. Recirculation systems typically consist of a combination of injection wells or galleries and one or more recovery wells where the extracted groundwater is treated, oxygenated, amended with nutrients and reinjected. However, the amount of oxygen that can be provided by this method is limited by the low solubility of oxygen in water (8 to 10 mg/L for water in equilibrium with air at typical temperatures). Greater amounts of oxygen can be provided by contacting the water with pure oxygen or addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to the water. In some cases, slurries of solid calcium or magnesium peroxide are injected under pressure through soil borings. These solid peroxides react with water releasing H2O2 which then decomposes releasing oxygen. Air sparging involves the injection of air under pressure below the water table. The air injection pressure must be great enough to overcome the hydrostatic pressure of the water and resistance to air flow through the soil. Anaerobic Anaerobic bioremediation can be employed to treat a broad range of oxidized contaminants including chlorinated ethenes (PCE, TCE, DCE, VC), chlorinated ethanes (TCA, DCA), chloromethanes (CT, CF), chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons, various energetics (e.g., perchlorate, RDX, TNT), and nitrate. This process involves the addition of an electron donor to: 1) deplete background electron acceptors including oxygen, nitrate, oxidized iron and manganese and sulfate; and 2) stimulate the biological and/or chemical reduction of the oxidized pollutants. Hexavalent chromium (Cr[VI]) and uranium (U[VI]) can be reduced to less mobile and/or less toxic forms (e.g., Cr[III], U[IV]). Similarly, reduction of sulfate to sulfide (sulfidogenesis) can be used to precipitate certain metals (e.g., zinc, cadmium). The choice of substrate and the method of injection depend on the contaminant type and distribution in the aquifer, hydrogeology, and remediation objectives. Substrate can be added using conventional well installations, by direct-push technology, or by excavation and backfill such as permeable reactive barriers (PRB) or biowalls. Slow-release products composed of edible oils or solid substrates tend to stay in place for an extended treatment period. Soluble substrates or soluble fermentation products of slow-release substrates can potentially migrate via advection and diffusion, providing broader but shorter-lived treatment zones. The added organic substrates are first fermented to hydrogen (H2) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs). The VFAs, including acetate, lactate, propionate and butyrate, provide carbon and energy for bacterial metabolism. Heavy metals Heavy metals including cadmium, chromium, lead and uranium are elements so they cannot be biodegraded. However, bioremediation processes can potentially be used to reduce the mobility of these material in the subsurface, reducing the potential for human and environmental exposure. The mobility of certain metals including chromium (Cr) and uranium (U) varies depending on the oxidation state of the material. Microorganisms can be used to reduce the toxicity and mobility of chromium by reducing hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI) to trivalent Cr (III). Uranium can be reduced from the more mobile U(VI) oxidation state to the less mobile U(IV) oxidation state. Microorganisms are used in this process because the reduction rate of these metals is often slow unless catalyzed by microbial interactions Research is also underway to develop methods to remove metals from water by enhancing the sorption of the metal to cell walls. This approach has been evaluated for treatment of cadmium, chromium, and lead. Phytoextraction processes concentrate contaminants in the biomass for subsequent removal.  Additives  In the event of biostimulation, adding nutrients that are limited to make the environment more suitable for bioremediation, nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, oxygen, and carbon may be added to the system to improve effectiveness of the treatment. Many biological processes are sensitive to pH and function most efficiently in near neutral conditions. Low pH can interfere with pH homeostasis or increase the solubility of toxic metals. Microorganisms can expend cellular energy to maintain homeostasis or cytoplasmic conditions may change in response to external changes in pH. Some anaerobes have adapted to low pH conditions through alterations in carbon and electron flow, cellular morphology, membrane structure, and protein synthesis.  Limitations of bioremediation  Bioremediation can be used to completely mineralize organic pollutants, to partially transform the pollutants, or alter their mobility. Heavy metals and radionuclides are elements that cannot be biodegraded, but can be bio- transformed to less mobile forms. In some cases, microbes do not fully mineralize the pollutant, potentially producing a more toxic compound. For example, under anaerobic conditions, the reductive dehalogenation of TCE may produce dichloroethylene (DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC), which are suspected or known carcinogens. However, the microorganism Dehalococcoides can further reduce DCE and VC to the non-toxic product ethene. Additional research is required to develop methods to ensure that the products from biodegradation are less persistent and less toxic than the original contaminant. Thus, the metabolic and chemical pathways of the microorganisms of interest must be known. In addition, knowing these pathways will help develop new technologies that can deal with sites that have uneven distributions of a mixture of contaminants. Also, for biodegradation to occur, there must be a microbial population with the metabolic capacity to degrade the pollutant, an environment with the right growing conditions for the microbes, and the right amount of nutrients and contaminants. The biological processes used by these microbes are highly specific, therefore, many environmental factors must be taken into account and regulated as well. Thus, bioremediation processes must be specifically made in accordance to the conditions at the contaminated site. Also, because many factors are interdependent, small-scale tests are usually performed before carrying out the procedure at the contaminated site. However, it can be difficult to extrapolate the results from the small-scale test studies into big field operations. In many cases, bioremediation takes more time than other alternatives such as land filling and incineration.  Genetic engineering  The use of genetic engineering to create organisms specifically designed for bioremediation is under preliminary research. Two category of genes can be inserted in the organism: degradative genes which encode proteins required for the degradation of pollutants, and reporter genes that are able to monitor pollution levels. Numerous members of Pseudomonas have also been modified with the lux gene, but for the detection of the polyaromatic hydrocarbon naphthalene. A field test for the release of the modified organism has been successful on a moderately large scale. There are concerns surrounding release and containment of genetically modified organisms into the environment due to the potential of horizontal gene transfer. Genetically modified organisms are classified and controlled under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 under United States Environmental Protection Agency. Measures have been created to address these concerns. Organisms can be modified such that they can only survive and grow under specific sets of environmental conditions. In addition, the tracking of modified organisms can be made easier with the insertion of bioluminescence genes for visual identification. Genetically modified organisms have been created to treat oil spills and break down certain plastics (PET)Building a circular economy with synthetic biology  See also  * Biodegradation * Bioleaching * Bioremediation of radioactive waste * Biosurfactant * Chelation * Dutch standards * Folkewall * List of environment topics * Living machines * Green wall * Mega Borg Oil Spill * Microbial biodegradation * Mycoremediation * Mycorrhizal Bioremediation * Phytoremediation * Pseudomonas putida (used for degrading oil) * Restoration ecology * US Microbics * Xenocatabolism  References  External links  * Phytoremediation, hosted by the Missouri Botanical Garden * To remediate or to not remediate? *Anaerobic Bioremediation Category:Biotechnology Category:Environmental soil science Category:Environmental engineering Category:Environmental terminology Category:Conservation projects Category:Ecological restoration Category:Soil contamination Category:Radioactive waste ","title":"Bioremediation"},{"id":"434190","text":"The French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools bans wearing conspicuous religious symbols in French public (e.g., government- operated) primary and secondary schools. The law is an amendment to the French Code of Education that expands principles founded in existing French law, especially the constitutional requirement of la√Øcit√©: the separation of state and religious activities. The bill passed France's national legislature and was signed into law by President Jacques Chirac on 15 March 2004 (thus the technical name is law 2004-2028 of 15 March 2004) and came into effect on 2 September 2004. The full title of the law is \\"\\" (literally \\"Law #2004-228 of March 15, 2004, concerning, as an application of the principle of the separation of church and state, the wearing of symbols or garb which show religious affiliation in public primary and secondary schools\\"). The law does not mention any particular religious symbol, and thus bans Christian (veil, signs), Muslim (veil, signs), Sikh (turban, signs), Jewish and other religious signs. It is, however, considered by many to target the wearing of headscarves (a khimar, considered by many Muslims to be an obligatory article of faith as part of hijab [\\"modesty\\"]) by Muslim schoolgirls. For this reason, it is occasionally referred to as the French headscarf ban in the foreign press. In addition, the law is seen by some as disproportionately affecting Muslims, arguing that Christians rarely wear oversized crosses, and Sikhs have successfully lobbied to be able to wear a simple under-turban, whereas Jews have greater opportunities to enroll children in private Jewish religious schools owing to their long presence in the country. The Law as published in the Journal Officiel de la R√©publique Fran√ßaise Background=Islamic view of headscarves In Islam, Hijab is a duty prescribed on all Muslims, though in the matter discussed in this article it only applies to women. Hijab is often equated with the idea of modesty in all senses including personal, physical and social. While it prescribes restrictions and practices for both men (such as, for example, restraining one's thoughts from objectification of women and covering the aspects of oneself that attract others to them, incorporating the chest and between the navel and knee for many Muslims) and women, it is most known for its religious prescription for a woman to dress modestly and cover her hair. While for some Muslims the concept of hijab is seen as balanced and consistent with ideas of gender equality, others see the religious prescription on female covering as chauvinistic, patriarchal, oppressive and an enforcement on women and against their rights. Most Muslims living in Western societies concede outright that the forcing of women to wear the headscarf is against Islamic precepts and cannot be accepted, but social pressure can in some cases be strong. A number of Islamic feminists see the wearing of the headscarf, and particularly of the full-face veil such as the niqƒÅb, as oppressive of women. French activist and politician Fadela Amara has thus stated: \\"The veil is the visible symbol of the subjugation of women, and therefore has no place in the mixed, secular spaces of France's public school system.\\" French education system A government-operated high school in central Rennes Education is compulsory in France up to the age of 16. The French system of primary and secondary education consists of: # government- operated schools (enseignement public); # private schools receiving government subsidies (enseignement priv√© sous contrat), the vast majority of private schools; and # private schools not receiving government subsidies (enseignement priv√© hors contrat). Schools in the first two categories are required to apply the same national curricula as defined by the Ministry of Education. The curriculum for schools in the third category is free, provided that students receive at least some minimal skills in writing, mathematics, etc. The law discussed in this article only applies to government-operated schools, in the first category. The French government highly subsidises private elementary and secondary schools, even those affiliated with religious organizations, as long as they apply the same curriculum as the public schools, with the same academic standards, and that they do not discriminate on grounds of religious affiliation nor make religious education compulsory. It is for instance common that children of agnostic or otherwise non-religious families, or children of families from other religions, are put in Catholic schools, if their parents judge these schools to offer better conditions of education or to be more convenient. Consequently, families can use private schools at moderate costs. While there are no accessible official national statistics on the costs of private schools, typical prices per year for low- income families are in the range of a few hundred euros. The average costs are ‚Ç¨500 a year per student; however, this statistic includes very expensive, exclusive schools. In addition, according to the figures from the secretariat, more than half of schools have established a price schedule taking into account a family's income; as a result, costs to parents can be as little as ‚Ç¨20 to ‚Ç¨30 per school month per student. In addition, the French government operates a distant learning agency, the CNED, which is another solution for families impacted by the normal rules or schedules of public schools. History Since 1905, France has had a law requiring separation of church and state, prohibiting the state from recognizing or funding any religion. Schools directly operated by the national or local governments must not endorse or promote any religious dogma (whether endorsing an existing religion or endorsing atheism or any other philosophy). Schools funded totally or in part by the national and local governments by law must not force students into religious education; they should remain equally accessible to children of any, or no, faith. For example, even though a majority of the population nominally professes Catholicism (although far fewer regularly practice Catholicism),Les Fran√ßais et leurs croyances , 2003 CSA poll government-operated French schools have no communal prayers, religious assemblies, or Christian crosses on the walls. The Constitution of France says that France is a la√Øque (roughly, secular) Republic. In France, historically, differences between religions (or later between religious and non-religious people) have often resulted in deep divisions of society, from the 16th-century Wars of Religion to the late 19th- century Dreyfus Affair. The relations between the Church of France and the state were disputed under Louis XIV (see Gallicanism); they were severely strained under the Revolution of 1789, when the constitutional government of the National Assembly promulgated the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and the Church divided into the constitutional clergy, who accepted it, and the ultramontanes who did not. Roman Catholicism was recognised as the faith of the majority of French citizens, but Napoleon also named Judaism and the Lutheran and Reformed Churches as officially recognised by the state. Although these four 'official' religions received state funding and protection (until the 1905 law as above), they were not given the status of a religion of the state. France had begun to view faith as a matter for each individual citizen rather than for a nation as a whole. As a result of this history, religious manifestations are considered undesirable in government-operated schools; primary and secondary schools are supposed to be neutral spaces where children can learn away from political or religious pressures, controversies and quarrels. Because of this neutrality requirement, students are normally prohibited from conducting religious proselytising or political activism on the premises. A cross in a French law court before 1905 Civil servants are expected to stay neutral with respect to politics or religion when they discharge their duties. More generally, they are expected to keep a certain reserve and not make comments or demonstrations that may be interpreted as political, religious, or other bias in the course of their duties or as an endorsement of particular religious or partisan political views by the government. Teaching personnel in government-operated schools must not, by law, endorse any political or religious point of view; they may also face sanctions for wearing overt religious symbols.See, for instance, the 2000 ruling of the Conseil d'√âtat, Mlle Marteaux). 1980s and 1990s Because the law was unclear, the Conseil d'√âtat was called in for legal analyses, then for settling litigation. For many years school administrators have accepted, or tolerated, that schoolchildren wear symbols of their various religions, such as a Christian student wearing a cross, or a Jewish student wearing a kippah. However, there was some leeway and uncertainty in those matters, and occasionally some students faced disciplinary action for overly ostentatious attire. Many people find crosses and yarmulkes acceptable, but not headscarves, for a variety of reasons. Some feminists do not consider them as religious symbols, but as symbols of female alienation, or dangerous signs of mounting communautarisme (ethnicisation of social relationships, which the French do not view favorably), rising Islamist movements, or attacks on the Republic, are sometimes deemed 'foreign' and 'un-French'. However, some people regard the wearing of headscarves as a feminist choice and do not view this as fundamentally different from other choices relating to clothing. The fact that most Muslims in France come from former French colonies has added a racist/antiracist tint to the debate. The issue has deeply divided France and debate has raged on ever since. The issue of religion has wider implications than the mere wearing of headscarves, which contributed to the complexity of the debate. Occasionally, Muslim students have refused to attend certain classes when they or those influencing them deemed aspects of their faith to be contradicted (such as swimming classes or physical education); or insisted on attending them in Islamic garb, thus raising the question of whether this purported solution denatured the intended activity. The wearing of the headscarf was also criticized as a means to enforce peer pressure on the girls not wearing it. One defense against this argument was that the ratio of Muslim girls to other girls was not always high in classrooms, and that scarf wearing did not necessarily reflect proselytizing intent; but a countervailing relevant issue was that the relevant group being pressured was Muslim girls not wearing the scarf, who could sometimes be endangered inside or outside school unless they submitted to wearing the scarf like their classmates. Because of the absence of unambiguous law, action was taken on a case-by-case basis against students wearing ostensible religious garb, with differences of practice between establishments. School administrators, in such cases, were taken into legal, social and media quarrels far beyond their ordinary responsibilities. This was highlighted by the 1989 Affaire du Foulard (\\"the headscarf affair\\"), when three young girls were expelled from their school in Creil, near Paris, for refusing to take off their headscarves. This caused such an uproar that administrators realized something had to be done soon to regain control. Because of these difficulties, public powers sought a more consistent approach. In 1989, the Minister of Education requested the legal analysis of the Conseil d'√âtat on the issue of whether or not school administrators could, or should, expel students for wearing religious symbols, within the current framework of applicable regulations, laws, constitutional rights and international conventions. The general assembly of the Conseil gave a detailed analysis, containing the following opinion: > It results from the above that, in teaching establishments, the wearing by > students of symbols by which they intend to manifest their religious > affiliation is not by itself incompatible with the principle of la√Øcit√©, as > it constitutes the free exercise of freedom of expression and of > manifestation of religious creeds, but that this freedom should not allow > students to sport signs of religious affiliation that, due to their nature, > or the conditions in which they are worn individually or collectively, or > due to their ostentatious and provocative character, would constitute an act > of pressure, provocation, proselytism or propaganda, or would harm the > dignity or the freedom of the student or other members of the educative > community, or would compromise their health or safety, or would perturb the > educational activities or the education role of the teaching personnel, or > would trouble public order in the establishment or the normal functioning of > the public service. On 2 November 1992, the Conseil ruled that a school regulation prohibiting all philosophical or religious signs, including those that were worn, was excessively sweeping and against the principle of la√Øcit√©. On 14 March 1994, the Conseil ruled that a school regulation prohibiting any headgear was excessive (the intent of this regulation was to prohibit the wearing of certain religious signs). The Conseil found that this regulation was excessively sweeping, without a clear need for it to be so. On 10 March 1995, the Conseil upheld the expelling of three students from a highschool, on the basis that the three students gravely perturbed classes, infringing on school rules and the alleged prohibition of proselytism. One factor was the insistence of the students on wearing the scarf during sports classes, which was deemed inappropriate attire for such an activity. It also upheld some stipulations of the school regulations which restricted the wearing of signs of a religious, philosophical or political character, with the same legal analysis as the 1989 one cited above. On 11 September 1995, three families appealed before the Conseil rulings of lower administrative courts, which had upheld decisions by high schools to exclude their daughters because they wore the veil; and the Minister of Education appealed rulings of lower courts that had declared illegal three exclusion decisions. The actual legal reasons differed slightly; however, in every case, on 27 November 1996, the Conseil ruled that the children had been inappropriately expelled, considering that the headscarf worn by the student, while it expressed the student's religious beliefs, did not have a protest or ostentatious character, nor did wearing it constitute in any case an act of pressure or proselytism. The opinion and the decisions of the Conseil, which established some kind of case law, still left a considerable margin of appreciation to school administrators, which led to many tensions and embarrassments. It was thus argued that clear and consistent rules should be enacted. Stasi commission's report In July 2003, French President Jacques Chirac set up an investigative committee (commission Stasi) to examine how the principle of la√Øcit√© should apply in practice. It consisted of 20 people headed by Bernard Stasi, then ombudsman of France (m√©diateur de la R√©publique). While an obvious focus of the commission was wearing religious attire in public schools, the commission noted in its report that the issues went further. The Stasi Commission published its report on 11 December 2003, considering that ostentatious displays of religion violated the secular rules of the French school system. The report recommended a law against pupils wearing \\"conspicuous\\" signs of belonging to a religion, meaning any visible symbol meant to be easily noticed by others. Prohibited items would include headscarves for Muslim girls, yarmulkes for Jewish boys, and turbans for Sikh boys. The Commission recommended allowing the wearing of discreet symbols of faith such as small crosses, Stars of David or Fatima's hands. The Senate commission based its report on multiple sources: school representatives, headmasters, teachers; political associations, such as Ni Putes Ni Soumises or SOS Racisme; representatives of the main religions;Because Islam is not a hierarchical religion in the way that Roman Catholicism is (the only hierarchical structure being the currently-defunct Caliphate), it is not obvious which religious representatives should be engaged in discussion by public powers. In addition, contrary to other religious tendencies such as Protestantism, Islam did not have an umbrella organisation in France. To remedy this last issue, in 2003 Nicolas Sarkozy, then Minister of the Interior, set up the French Council of the Muslim Faith, which the State uses as a discussion partner for such issues. This elected council is equivalent in recognition to similar representative groups of other faiths. or leaders of human-rights organizations. Most of the debate about the law centred on the use of the hijab (similar to the one worn by these Indonesian women) by female Muslim students The Commission's report emphasised that publicly funded schools in France should transmit knowledge, teach students critical awareness, assure autonomy and openness to cultural diversity, and encourage personal development. Schooling aims both to train students for a professional career, and to make them into good citizens of the French Republic. The report states that such a mission presupposes fixed common rules, like gender equality and respect for secularity. Most of the debate has centered on hijab ‚Äì the Islamic dress code, which may include a headscarf for women, but more generally, on the wearing of religious or political symbols in schools. The wearing of headscarves in school started comparatively recently in mainland France (since the late 1980s), and has become the focus of the conflict. The increasing number of visible headscarves has been attributed by some to a rise in extremist activity in France, in particular in poor immigrant suburbs. However intellectuals such as Xavier Ternisien of Le Monde Diplomatique have maintained that the indubitable rise in religious observance is not linked with Islamic extremism, but with the frustration of children of immigrants no longer accepting to remain invisible as their parents often were. Further it is often associated with the idea of Muslim communities feeling settled and established in, and thus a part of, in French society such that they feel comfortable in expressing their identity. The Commission identified the following positions with regard to wearing the Muslim headscarf: * For those wearing it, the headscarf can have different meanings. The wearers may have exercised a free personal choice to wear the headscarf; or external pressure may have forced them to do so. Most French people find this idea of constraint or pressure particularly intolerable when it relates to young girls (some girls start wearing a headscarf before the age of 11). The purpose of dressing according to hijab varies from person to person. Some women see the headscarf as a way to preserve their modesty and prevent any sexual attractions as in western countries. Some see it as a form of liberation above the sexualisation and consumerism of modern society. Others see it as a patriarchal article intended to keep women hidden and subservient. The representatives of the main religions and leaders of human rights organisations have expressed several objections to a law banning the wearing of religious symbols. They believe it will lead to the stigmatisation of Muslims, exacerbate anti-religious sentiment, promote the image of a France that restricts personal freedom, and encourage Muslim girls to drop out of schools if they feel forced to choose between schooling and their faith. The Commission said that the Republic must clarify this situation. A section of the report which received less media attention recommended that the school system make Yom Kippur and Eid (festival) into vacation days each year: currently, only some Christian holidays are vacation days (see Holidays in France); students who want to celebrate other festivities have to take some work day off with the authorisation of their parents. However, for critics and Muslims this did not balance out affairs: the banning of Muslim girls from freely choosing to wear an article of faith, seen by them as a religious obligation, could not be balanced with the permission to celebrate a religious festival, which is not obligatory at all. The report also recommended enacting a ban on conspicuous symbols of political affiliation. The French National Assembly has not taken up these proposals. The Commission also noted that occasionally pupils refuse to attend school because of the presence of teachers of the opposite sex, or refuse to attend certain classes (such as gymnastics or swimming lessons). The Commission suggested that only schools or state-recognised doctors (not simply parents) should have the right to grant exemptions. Law creation and interpretations In December 2003, President Jacques Chirac decided to act on the part of the Stasi report which recommended banning conspicuous religious symbols from schools. This meant that the legislature could adopt the recommendations, according to the emergency procedure, in January or February, ready for application at the start of the next school year in September 2004. On 10 February 2004 the lower house voted by a large majority (494 for, 36 against, 31 abstentions) in support of the ban, which includes the caveat that the ban will be reviewed after it has operated for one year. The initiators of the law are said to have particularly targeted two items of clothing: the headscarf and the veil (French: foulard and voile respectively); however the law mentions neither and just addresses \\"ostentatious\\" (\\"conspicuous\\") symbols. Because of its terse, broad, vague terms, the law will leave a lot of its interpretation to the administrative and judicial authorities. The headscarf (sometimes referred to as the hijab in both French and English) covers the hair, ears, neck, and sometimes the shoulders, but not the face. Most Muslim girls who cover their heads in school wear such a headscarf. More rarely, girls may also wear a complete dress covering their body (djelbab). The full or Afghan burka, which covers the entire body except for a slit or grille to see through, occurs more commonly as the dress of an adult woman than that of a schoolgirl. A recent controversy occurred when a mother who wore a full burka became a representative of parents in a city school. Rather than encourage public participation of such women, her participation in school deliberations while entirely covered was highly criticised. It was finally tolerated. In order to enforce the law, effective decisions whether certain items are \\"ostentatious\\" or not will have to be taken. In order to achieve that: * the Minister of Education will issue circulaires, or instructions for its services; it seems that large crosses, full hijabs or yarmulkes would be banned, while small symbols such as small Stars of David or crosses in pendants would not be; * headmasters will have to judge whether particular attire is or not acceptable with respect to the law; * if necessary, families will go to administrative courts to challenge the school authorities' decision; a final decision may not be reached until the Conseil d'√âtat at litigation (supreme administrative court), decides some points of jurisprudence. The law itself may not be challenged before French courts (since this would have warranted action before the Constitutional Council before the signing of the law); however, the courts may significantly curtail its application ‚Äî especially given the inherent margin of appreciation of what is ostentatious or not. The law will apply in France and its overseas territories (which France administers as a part of its metropolitan territory), but it is likely that appropriate enforcement measures will depend on the local context, given the margin of appreciation offered by the law. Overseas Countries and Territories with a large Muslim community will receive some exemptions. For example, it was suggested that Mayotte girls may wear small bandanas and light veils (kishall). Public reaction=France The proposed ban was extremely controversial, with both sides of the political spectrum being split on the issue. In 2004, French Cardinal Bernard Panafieu, the Archbishop of Marseilles called the ban \\"unenforceable\\" While agreeing that some Muslim immigrants have had trouble adjusting to a \\"lay, pluralistic society\\" he asserted that the ban was wrong as it prevented Muslims from \\"asserting their identity\\" and that it would be \\"better to act through persuasion than by compulsion\\" if the state wanted to limit the use of religious symbols. =Population= On February 14, 2004, the Associated Press reported that \\"Thousands of people, many of them women wearing headscarves, marched in France ... to protest a law banning the Islamic coverings and other religious apparel in public schools.\\" Polls suggest that a large majority of the French favour the ban. A January 2004 survey for Agence France-Presse showed 78% of teachers in favour.Laic.Info (in French) A February 2004 survey by CSA for Le Parisien showed 69% of the population for the ban and 29% against. For Muslims in France, the February survey showed 42% for and 53% against. Among surveyed Muslim women, 49% approved the proposed law, and 43% opposed it. Complex reasons may influence why an individual either supports or opposes this amendment. They range from ensuring sex equality, preventing girls from being pressured into wearing the headscarf, boys into wearing turbans (for example), or a desire to see the Muslim community assimilated into French society on the one hand; to uphold freedoms of expression or conscience or religion, preventing the state from imposing restrictions on what a person can or cannot wear, preventing state victimisation of a minority group and opposing what may be seen as discrimination against Muslims or 'the other'. =Political reactions= While all major political parties were somewhat divided on the issue, all major parties (the majority UMP and UDF, the opposition PS) supported the law. However, Andr√© Victor, member of Workers' Struggle wrote in his article Islamic Hijab and the Subjugation of Women 25 April 2003 that \\"Sarkozy has spoken out against hijab on passport photos, and presumably earned the approval of millions of voters, which was probably the real purpose of this exercise in demagoguery[...] Therefore, this policy leads to increase the weight of the most reactionary religious authorities within the immigrant population.\\" =Legal arguments= Some critics have raised a legal point: they see the law as incompatible with the European convention on fundamental human rights. The Stasi Commission responded: The European Court in Strasbourg protects la√Øcit√© when it is a fundamental value of the State. It allows limits to the freedom of expression in public services, especially when it is a matter of protecting minors against external pressures. The Commission considers that the expression of an individual's religion in the French state has to comply with the basic rules regarding the secular nature of the state and has to comply with the requirements of equality between the sexes and the safeguarding of the rights of minors. Similar debates on the education of girls in headscarves have long raged in secular-yet-Muslim Turkey; the European Court of Human Rights upheld the laws of Turkey, which are more restrictive than the French law; it therefore seems highly unlikely it would declare the French law contrary to the Convention. Another piece of legal criticism is that a full-fledged law was not needed to enforce a measure that basically amounts to a new set of school regulations. Any binding document of lesser value (such as a d√©cret or an arr√™t√© ministeriel) would have had a similar effect. Since the writing of the Napoleonic Code, a principle of French law has been that it must be, in the words of the great legislator Portalis, \\"general and abstract.\\" Critics therefore argue that, by legislating on issues that could be solved with texts other than laws, the French legislature lowers the values of the law in general. Article 34 of the Constitution of France vests power in Parliament to legislate on the \\"fundamental principles of teaching\\", leaving the application of these principles to the executive branch. By legislating on such minutiae, the argument goes, Parliament may have overstepped the \\"domain of the law\\" (domaine de la loi) that is set out by the Constitution only for the sake of pleasing the media and some interest groups. However, a counter-argument is that the Conseil d'√âtat, ruling according to current statute law, considered that sweeping prohibitions of religious attire or headgear by administrative authorities was contrary to law. Opposition Human rights NGOs = Some international human rights' organisations criticised the law. Human Rights Watch stated: > The proposed law is an unwarranted infringement on the right to religious > practice. For many Muslims, wearing a headscarf is not only about religious > expression, it is about religious obligation. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom said: > In February 2004, the Commission issued a public statement expressing > concern over the proposed new law. The Commission expressed particular > concern that the proposed restrictions may violate France's international > human rights commitments. The Commission also stated that though increased > immigration in France in recent years has created new challenges for the > French government, including integration of these immigrants into French > society as well as problems of public order, these challenges should be > addressed directly, and not by inappropriately limiting the right to freedom > of thought, conscience, religion, and belief.

In 2009 Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb called France the \\"mother of all evils\\" and urged revenge against France for its ‚Äúfierce war on our daughters who wore Hijab‚Äù. =International= Various commentators outside of France condemned the law based on what they saw as its racist implications. Susan Price, an Australian activist, argued that \\"the wedge-politics of racism has always been used to divide the working class, which in France pulled off spectacular rolling strikes against the government in 2003,\\" adding that \\"the current attack must also be seen as part of a continuum of racist policies which go back to the mid-1990s and the 'Fortress Europe' policies of the major European capitalist governments\\" designed \\"to appeal to the support base of Jean-Marie Le Pen's right-wing National Front (FN).\\" Similar arguments were made at the time by American anti-racist activist, Sharon Smith, who added the claim that Muslim women in France opposing the 2004 law were fighting against the same \\"state-imposed oppression\\" as women in Afghanistan were opposing by seeking freedom to choose to refrain from wearing burkas. Enforcement The law came into effect on 2 September 2004, with the new school year. In September 2005, the Ministry of Education reportedLe Monde , 30 September 2005 that only 12 students showed up with distinctive religious signs in the first week of classes, compared to 639 in the preceding year. A number of students have elected to take state- provided distance-learning classes from CNED. There was one case of a Sikh student in the acad√©mie of Cr√©teil, who refused to remove his turban. The decision caused an outcry from many Muslims across the world, calling it a violation of freedom of practicing their religion. In addition to protests of a few thousand people in Paris, there were protests of up to a few hundred people in other countries, especially in the Muslim world. As a consequence of the law, the years following the ban has seen an increasing number of Islamic secondary schools being established, some Muslim female students chose to study at home, and others left France with their families. Interpretation In some schools, the ban was also applied to long skirts and headbands. In April 2015, a 15-year-old schoolgirl in northeastern France was sent home for wearing a long skirt deemed an \\"ostentatious sign\\" of the girl's Muslim faith by the principal. It caused further controversy and infuriated many of the country's Muslims, who saw the school system's censure of the girl as discriminatory. The Collective Against Islamophobia in France has documented 130 similar cases across France between January 2014 and April 2015.French School Deems Teenager's Skirt an Illegal Display of Religion , The New York Times, April 29, 2015.

The term is most often employed in Fennoscandia, the Isle of Man, parts of Northern England, and Scotland.  Etymology  The English word \\"fell\\" comes from Old Norse fell and fjall (both forms existed). It is cognate with Danish fjeld, Faroese fjall and fj√∏ll, Icelandic fjall and fell, Norwegian fjell with dialects fj√∏ll, fj√∏dd, fjedd, fjedl, fjill, fil(l), and fel,Norsk Stadnamn Leksikon: Grunnord and Swedish fj√§ll, all referring to mountains rising above the alpine tree line.Bjorvand and Lindeman (2007:270‚Äì271).  British Isles  View of the Scafell massif from Yewbarrow, Wasdale, Cumbria. In the valley are older enclosures and higher up on the fell-side are the parliamentary enclosures following straight lines regardless of terrain. In Northern England, especially in the Lake District and in the Pennine Dales, the word \\"fell\\" originally referred to an area of uncultivated high ground used as common grazing usually on common land and above the timberline. Today, generally, \\"fell\\" refers to the mountains and hills of the Lake District and the Pennine Dales. Names that originally referred to grazing areas have been applied to these hilltops. This is the case with Seathwaite Fell, for example, which would be the common grazing land used by the farmers of Seathwaite. The fellgate marks the road from a settlement onto the fell (see photograph for example), as is the case with the Seathwaite Fell. In other cases the reverse is true; for instance, the name of Wetherlam, in the Coniston Fells, though understood to refer to the mountain as a whole, strictly speaking refers to the summit; the slopes have names such as Tilberthwaite High Fell, Low Fell and Above Beck Fells. Ingleton towards the fellgate and Ingleborough, North Yorkshire, England The word \\"fell\\" is also used in the names of various breeds of livestock, bred for life on the uplands, such as Rough Fell sheep, Fell Terriers and Fell ponies. It is also found in many place names across the North of England, often attached to the name of a community; thus the township of Cartmel Fell. In northern England, there is a Lord of the Fells ‚Äì this ancient aristocratic title being associated with the Lords of Bowland. Groups of cairns are a common feature on many fells, often marking the summit ‚Äì there are fine examples on Wild Boar Fell in Mallerstang Dale, Cumbria, and on Nine Standards Rigg just outside Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria. As the most mountainous region of England, the Lake District is the area most closely associated with the sport of fell running, which takes its name from the fells of the district. \\"Fellwalking\\" is also the term used locally for the activity known in the rest of Great Britain as hillwalking. The word \\"fell\\" also enjoys limited use in Scotland, with for example the Campsie Fells in Central Scotland, to the North East of Glasgow. One of the most famous examples of the use of the word \\"fell\\" in Scotland is Goat Fell, the highest point on the Isle of Arran. Criffel and the nearby Long Fell in Galloway may be seen from the northern Lake District of England. Peel Fell in the Kielder Forest is situated on the border between the Scottish Borders to the North and the English county of Northumberland to the South.  Fennoscandia  Road across the barren Hardangervidda plateau, Norway. Norway In Norway, fjell, in common usage, is generally interpreted as simply a summit or area of greater altitude than a hill, which leads to a great deal of local variation in what is defined as a fjell. Fjell is mostly used about areas above the forest line. Distinct summits can be referred to as et fjell (a mountain). High plateaus (vidde landscape) such as Hardangervidda are also regarded as fjell. Professor of geography at the University of Bergen, Anders Lundeberg, has summed up the problem by stating, \\"There simply is no fixed and unambiguous definition of fjell.\\" Ivar Aasen defined fjell as a \\"tall berg\\", primarily referring to a berg that reaches an altitude where trees don't grow, lower berg are referred to as \\"berg\\", √•s (hill, ridge) or hei (moor, heathland). The fixed expression til fjells refers to mountains (or uplands) as a collective rather than a specific location or specific summit (the \\"s\\" in til fjells is an old genitive form remaining only in fixed expressions). According to Ivar Aasen, berg refers to cliffs, bedrock and notable elevations of the surface underpinned by bedrock; berg also refers to the substance of bedrock.Nesset, K√•re (1964). No l√¶rer vi grammatikk. Oslo: Aschehoug.Aasen, Ivar (1918): Norsk ordbog med dansk forklaring. Vestmannalaget/Cammermeyer. For all practical purposes, fjell can be translated as \\"mountain\\" and the Norwegian language has no other commonly used word for mountain. Sweden In Sweden, fj√§ll refers to any mountain or upland high enough that forest will not naturally survive at the top, in effect a mountain tundra. Fj√§ll is primarily used to describe mountains in the Nordic countries, but also more generally to describe mountains shaped by massive ice sheets, primarily in Arctic and subarctic regions. Finland Fells in Finland (including Halti, the highest fell in Finland) In Finnish, the mountains characteristic of the region of Lapland are called tunturi (plural: tunturit), i.e. \\"fell\\". A tunturi is a hill high enough that its top is above the tree line and has alpine tundra. In Finnish, the geographical term vuori is used for mountains recently uplifted and with jagged terrain featuring permanent glaciers, while tunturi refers to the old, highly eroded, gently shaped terrain without glaciers, as found in Finland.Web-Facta, WSOY 2003. They are round inselbergs rising from the otherwise flat surroundings. The tree line can be at a rather low altitude, such as 600 m in Enonteki√∂, owing to the high latitude. The fells in Finnish Lapland form vestiges of the Karelides mountains, formed two billion years ago. Also, the term tunturi is also generally used to refer to treeless plains at high altitudes in far north regions. The term tunturi, originally a word limited to far-Northern dialects of Finnish and Karelian, is a loan from Sami, compare Proto-Sami *tuont√´r, South Sami doedtere, Northern Sami duottar, Inari Sami tuod√¢r \\"uplands, mountains, tundra\\", Kildin Sami t≈´nd√¢r, which means \\"uplands, treeless mountain tract\\" and is cognate with Finnish tanner \\"hard ground\\". From this Sami word, the word \\"tundra\\" is borrowed, as well, through the Russian language. Hills that are over 50 m high, but do not reach the tree line are referred to as vaara, while the general term for hills including hills of 50 m or less is m√§ki.http://www.kysy.fi/kysymys/maaston-muodoista- tuli-juttua-ja-yksimielisyyteen-ei-paasty-millon-harju-ja In place names, however, tunturi, vaara and vuori are used inconsistently, e.g. Rukatunturi is technically a vaara, as it lacks alpine tundra. F√∂rfj√§ll The term f√∂rfj√§ll (literally \\"fore-fell\\") is used in Sweden and Finland to denote mountainous zones lower and less dissected than the fell proper. However, its more pronounced relief, its often higher amount of plateaux, and its coherent valley systems distinguishes the f√∂rfj√§ll also from the undulating hilly terrain (bergkullsterr√§ng) and the plains with residual hills (bergkullsl√§tt). Generally, the f√∂rfj√§ll do not surpass 1000 m ASL. As a geomorphic unit, the f√∂rfj√§ll extends across Sweden as a 650-km-long and 40- to 80-km-broad belt from Dalarna in the south to Norrbotten in the north. * bekkr - 'stream' ¬ª beck * dalr - 'valley' ¬ª dale * fors - 'waterfall' ¬ª force/foss * fjallr - 'mountain' (usually a large, flat mountain) ¬ª fell * gil - 'ravine' ¬ª gill/ghyll * haugr - 'hill' ¬ª howe * pic - 'peak' ¬ª pike * s√¶tr - 'shieling' ¬ª side/seat * tjorn - 'small lake' ¬ª tarn * √æveit - 'clearing' ¬ª thwaite See also * Fell farming * Fell Terrier * List of fells in the Lake District * List of Wainwrights (the 214 fells described in A.

The Vasquez Rocks, north of Los Angeles, were one of his many hideouts and are named after him.  Early life  Tiburcio Vasquez was born in Monterey, Alta California, Mexico (present-day California, United States) on April 11, 1835 to Jos√© Hermenegildo Vasquez and Mar√≠a Guadalupe Cantua. In accord with Spanish tradition, Vasquez's birth was celebrated on the feast day of his namesake, St. Tiburtius. Thus, he always referred to his birthday as August 11, 1835. His great-grandfather came to Alta California with the De Anza Expedition of 1776. Vasquez was slightly built, about . His family sent him to school, and he was fluent in both English and Spanish. In 1852, Vasquez was influenced by Anastacio Garc√≠a, one of California's most dangerous bandits. In 1854, Vasquez was present at the slaying of Monterey Constable William Hardmount in a fight with Anastacio Garc√≠a at a fandango. Vasquez denied any involvement and fled, becoming an outlaw. Vasquez later claimed his crimes were the result of discrimination by the norteamericanos and insisted that he was a defender of Mexican-American rights. Vasquez and Garc√≠a played leading roles in Monterey County's murderous Roach-Belcher feud, which ended when Garc√≠a was executed by hanging in 1875. By 1856, Vasquez was rustling horses. A sheriff's posse caught up with him near Newhall, and he spent the next five years behind bars in San Quentin prison. There he helped organize, and participated in, four bloody prison breaks which left twenty convicts dead. After his release, he committed numerous burglaries, cattle thefts, and highway robberies in Sonoma County in 1866. He was captured after a store burglary in Petaluma and sent to prison again for three years. His \\"trademark\\" was \\"binding [his victims'] hands behind their back and leaving them face down in the dust.\\"  Final years  In 1870, Vasquez organized a bandit gang, which included the notorious Juan Soto, and later, Procopio Bustamante. After numerous bandit raids, he was shot and badly wounded in a gunfight with Santa Cruz police officer Robert Liddell. He managed to escape, and his sisters nursed him back to health. In 1873, he gained statewide, and then nationwide, notoriety. Vasquez and his gang stole $2,200 from Snyder's Store in Tres Pinos, now called Paicines, in San Benito County. Three were killed, but not by Tiburcio. Posses began searching for him, and Governor Newton Booth placed a $1,000 reward on his head. Sheriff John H. Adams from San Jose pursued the band to Southern California; Vasquez escaped after a gunfight. Vasquez hid for a while in Southern California, where he was less well known. With his two most trusted men, he rode over the old Tejon Pass, through the Antelope Valley, and rested at Jim Hefner's ranch at Elizabeth Lake. Vasquez's brother, Francisco, lived nearby. After resting, Vasquez rode on to Littlerock Creek, which became his first Southern California hideout. Vasquez was popular in the Mexican- American community, and had many friends and family members from Santa Rosa in Northern California to Los Angeles in the south. He was handsome, literate, charming, played guitar, and was a skillful dancer. Women were attracted to him and he had many love affairs. He enjoyed reading romantic novels and writing poetry for his female admirers. He had several affairs with married women, one of which eventually led to his downfall. Vasquez returned to the San Joaquin Valley. On November 10, 1873, he and his gang robbed the Jones store at Millerton in Fresno County. On December 26, 1873, he and his band sacked the town of Kingston in Fresno County, robbing all the businesses and making off with $2,500 in cash and jewelry. Governor Booth was now authorized by the California State Legislature to spend up to $15,000 to bring the law down on Vasquez. Posses were formed in Santa Clara, Monterey, San Joaquin, Fresno, and Tulare counties. In January 1874, Booth offered $3,000 for Vasquez's capture alive, and $2,000 if he was brought back dead. These rewards were increased in February to $8,000 and $6,000, respectively. Alameda County Sheriff Harry Morse was assigned specifically to track down Vasquez. Heading towards Bakersfield, Vasquez and gang member Clodoveo Ch√°vez rode to the rock promontory near Inyokern now known as Robbers Roost. Near that spot, at Coyote Holes, they robbed a stagecoach from the Cerro Gordo Mines, silver mines near Owens Lake. During the robbery Vasquez shot and wounded a man who did not obey his orders. The gang moved to Elizabeth Lake and Soledad Canyon, robbing a stage of $300, stealing six horses and a wagon near present-day Acton, and robbing lone travelers. Vasquez was believed to be hiding out at Vasquez Rocks. These rock formations proved a formidable hideout for him and his gang. Shallow caves, deep crevices, and numerous overhangs created a maze for any posse to thread. The tallest rock, 150 feet (46 m) high, provided an excellent lookout point. For the next two months, he escaped attention. However, he then made an error that led to his capture. On April 15, 1874, he and his band held the prominent sheepman Alessandro Repetto for ransom. Pursuing posses from Los Angeles almost trapped the gang in the San Gabriel Mountains, but once again, Vasquez and his men escaped.  Capture  Vintage Map of Tiburcio V√°squez Capture Vasquez took up residence at the adobe home of \\"Greek George\\" Caralambo in the northwest corner of Rancho La Brea, located 200 yards (183 m) south of the present-day Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. Greek George was a former camel driver for General Beale in the Army Camel Corps. Allegedly, Vasquez seduced and impregnated his own niece. Either the girl's family or Greek George's wife's family betrayed Vasquez to Los Angeles Sheriff William R. Rowland. Rowland sent a posse to the ranch and captured Vasquez on May 14, 1874. Greek George's adobe was situated near the present-day Melrose Place in West Hollywood, very close to where the movie industry set up shop a few decades later. Vasquez remained in the Los Angeles County jail for nine days. He had numerous requests for interviews by many newspaper reporters, but agreed to see only three: two from the San Francisco Chronicle and one from the Los Angeles Star. He told them his aim was to return California to Mexican rule. He insisted he was an honorable man and claimed he had never killed anyone. He was photographed by Valentin Wolfenstein behind the jail on May 18, 1874. In late May, Vasquez was moved by steamship to San Francisco. He eventually stood trial in San Jose. Vasquez quickly became a celebrity among many of his fellow Hispanic Californians. He admitted he was an outlaw, but again denied he had ever killed anyone. A note purportedly written by Clodoveo Ch√°vez, one of his gang members, was dropped into a Wells Fargo box. Ch√°vez wrote that he, not Vasquez, had shot the men at Tres Pinos. Nevertheless, at his trial Vasquez admitted participating in the Tres Pinos raid. Since all the participants in the robbery were equally guilty of any murder that took place during its commission, whether Vasquez actually pulled the trigger was legally irrelevant. In January 1875, Vasquez was convicted and sentenced to hang for murder. His trial had taken four days and the jury deliberated for only two hours before finally finding him guilty of one count of murder in the Tres Pinos robbery. Visitors still flocked to Vasquez's jail cell, many of them women. He signed autographs and posed for photographs. Vasquez sold the photos from the window of his cell and used the money to pay for his legal defense. After his conviction, he appealed for clemency. It was denied by Governor Romualdo Pacheco. Vasquez calmly met his fate in San Jose on March 19, 1875. He was 39 years old.  Legacy  Even today, Tiburcio V√°squez remains controversial. He is seen as a hero by some for his defiance of what he viewed as unjust laws and discrimination. Others regard him as a colorful outlaw. To this day, many continue to visit and pay respects to Vasquez's grave. He was buried in Santa Clara Mission Cemetery in Santa Clara, California. His grave is very difficult to find, but visitors to Santa Clara cemetery have managed to find it for years. The groundskeeper directed Vasquez relative Patrick McAnaney to the grave in 1980, telling him \\"Vasquez lived at odds with the people, and he was buried at odds with them.\\" This was in reference to his gravestone being set at an angle relative to the other gravestones. Online photos show his grave beside two large cacti and in front of a palm tree, no longer standing. His carved granite headstone is the only stone in the entire cemetery to stand at an angle. All the rest are in uniform rows, and many other graves surrounding Vasquez's grave are flat to the ground as if no one else wanted to be interred near the famous bandido until decades later when his notoriety had died down. Vasquez's ghost is said to haunt many places, including the cemetery, some of his hideouts, areas where gruesome crimes were committed, and the prison cells where he was held. With his upper-class Californio background, Vasquez is thought to have been one of several sources for the bandit-hero character Zorro. The actor Anthony Caruso played Vasquez in Stories of the Century. Armand Alzamora (1928‚Äì2009) played Vasquez in the 1957 episode, \\"The Last Bad Man\\" of the syndicated anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. The segment focuses on Vasquez's early life of crime, his hatred for the US takeover of California, the prison escape, and his hanging at the age of 39. The trunk and knife that belonged to Tiburcio are on display at the Andres Pico Adobe in Mission Hills, part of the San Fernando Valley Historical Society collection.

The tree extends down to sea level in many areas, particularly in Oregon and Washington. It is the state tree of Idaho, and is sometimes known as the Idaho pine. Description Foliage and cones Western white pine (Pinus monticola) is a large tree, regularly growing to and exceptionally up to tall. It is a member of the white pine group, Pinus subgenus Strobus, and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. The needles are finely serrated, and long. The cones are long and slender, long and broad (closed), opening to broad; the scales are thin and flexible. The seeds are small, long, and have a long slender wing long. It is related to the Eastern white pine (Pinus strobus), differing from it in having larger cones, slightly longer-lasting leaves (2‚Äì3 years, rather than 1.5‚Äì2 years) with more prominent stomatal bands, and a somewhat denser and narrower habit. The branches are borne in regular whorls, produced at the rate of one a year; this is pronounced in narrow, stand-grown trees, while open specimens may have a more rounded form with wide-reaching limbs. It is widely grown as an ornamental tree, but has been heavily logged throughout much of its range in the past. Threats Large P. monticola Western white pine (Pinus monticola) has been seriously affected by the white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola), a fungus that was accidentally introduced from Europe in 1909. The United States Forest Service estimates that 90% of the Western white pines have been killed by the blister rust west of the Cascades. Large stands have been succeeded by other pines or non-pine species. The rust has also killed much of the whitebark pine outside of California. Blister rust is less severe in California, and Western white and whitebark pines have survived there in great numbers. Resistance to the blister rust is genetic, and due to Western white pine's genetic variability some individuals are relatively unaffected by the rust. The Forest Service has a program for locating and breeding rust-resistant Western white pine and sugar pine. Seedlings of these trees have been introduced into the wild.

Early life and education Fano was born in Turin, Italy in 1917 to a Jewish family and grew up in Turin.Did My Brother Invent E-Mail With Tom Van Vleck? (Part Five) BY ERROL MORRIS JUNE 23, 2011, New York Times Fano's father was the mathematician Gino Fano, his older brother was the physicist Ugo Fano, and Giulio Racah was a cousin. Fano studied engineering as an undergraduate at the School of Engineering of Torino (Politecnico di Torino) until 1939, when he emigrated to the United States as a result of anti-Jewish legislation passed under Benito Mussolini. He received his S.B. in electrical engineering from MIT in 1941, and upon graduation joined the staff of the MIT Radiation Laboratory. After World War II, Fano continued on to complete his Sc.D. in electrical engineering from MIT in 1947. His thesis, titled \\"Theoretical Limitations on the Broadband Matching of Arbitrary Impedances\\", was supervised by Ernst Guillemin. Career Fano's career spans three areas, microwave systems, information theory, and computer science. Fano joined the MIT faculty in 1947 to what was then called the Department of Electrical Engineering. Between 1950 and 1953, he led the Radar Techniques Group at Lincoln Laboratory. In 1954, Fano was made an IEEE Fellow for \\"contributions in the field of information theory and microwave filters\\". He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958, to the National Academy of Engineering in 1973, and to the National Academy of Sciences in 1978.Dates of election per the American Academy and National Academies membership lists. Fano was known principally for his work on information theory. He developed Shannon‚ÄìFano coding in collaboration with Claude Shannon, and derived the Fano inequality. He also invented the Fano algorithm and postulated the Fano metric. In the early 1960s, Fano was involved in the development of time- sharing computers. From 1963 until 1968 Fano served as the founding director of MIT's Project MAC, which evolved to become what is now known as the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He also helped to create MIT's original computer science curriculum. In 1967, Fano received the Claude E. Shannon Award for his work in information theory. In 1977 he was recognized for his contribution to the teaching of electrical engineering with the IEEE James H. Mulligan Jr. Education Medal. Fano retired from active teaching in 1984, and died on 13 July 2016 at the age of 98. Bibliography In addition to his work in information theory, Fano also published articles and books about microwave systems, electromagnetism, network theory, and engineering education. His longer publications include: *\\"The Theory of Microwave Filters\\" and \\"The Design of Microwave Filters\\", chapters 9 and 10 in George L.

Retrieved 10 February 2013 Personal life Dextrous was born and raised in Stoke Newington, London Borough of Hackney, London, England. He was classmates with DJ Hype and Smiley and PJ from the group Shut Up and Dance, and DJed at Brooke House Secondary School, where he played trumpet in the brass band, and sang in the school choir. Rude Boy Keith, his partner from their King of the Jungle record label also attended the boys school at the same time, as well as Daddy Earl (twin brother of Smiley and DJ Hype's MC). Career Dextrous took his DJing up a gear when he started to play at parties and small clubs in 1987. At around the same time, he began putting his studio together, based around an Atari 520STFM, Casio HT3000 keyboard, Casio CZ-101 Synth and Yamaha TX7 Sound Module. He released his first record in 1992, on Ruff Quality Recordings (the sister label of Shut Up and Dance Records) entitled \\"Ruffneck Biznizz\\" which topped the Kiss FM House charts. This track was one of the precursors to the jungle scene, with its sped up breakbeats and reggae/dub basslines. In 1993, Dextrous met Teebone and they started producing together under a number of aliases including Fusion Forum, producing tracks like \\"Vintage Keys\\" and \\"Summer Mist\\", on Reinforced Records. Music labels Dextrous decided to start his own label, King of the Jungle Records, with Rude Boy Keith (real name Keith Lawrence), who was working for Shut Up and Dance at the time, and who also attended Brooke House School during the time Dextrous, DJ Hype, Smiley and PJ were there. Dextrous and Rude Boy Keith also became a DJ and MC double act that travelled far and wide, spreading their sound through dubplate specials and PA-ing their latest recordings. During that time, the pair signed to Suburban Base to release Da Kings of the Jungle trilogy. Dextrous was one of the leading lights within the ever-growing jungle scene, and could also be heard on Sunday mornings playing on Kool FM, one of the main pirate radio stations in London. Never one to keep still, Dextrous parted company with the radio station and then subsequently King of the Jungle Records in 1995. By then, he had already launched two further record labels, State of the Art Recordings alongside partners Paul Brown and Jon Stewart, and Subversive Recordings (formerly Subliminal Recordings) which featured a number of collaborations with longtime production partner Teebone including \\"Selectors Roll\\" which featured on the Suburban Base compilation album, Drum & Bass Selection 3 (The Dub Plate Selection) and Top Gun. These labels allowed Dextrous further creative freedom, the former being his platform to express his jazz roots. As a trio, Paul, Jon and Dex recorded under the moniker Solid State. Collectively, they have been credited as one of the pioneers of the liquid funk scene. Together they created the sound they branded \\"urban fusion\\" to cover all of the creative influences evident in their music, including jazz, dub, Detroit techno, garage, funk and reggae. During this time, Solid State recorded for Fabio's Creative Source label as well as Renegade Recordings and Alan McGee's Eruption Records (Creation Records' sister label). Aliases Dextrous has recorded drum and bass/jungle and several other genres including broken beats, UK garage, nu jazz, R&B;, dub and jazz fusion under many aliases: * Transcendent Minds * Solid State * DJ Rus De Tox * Forbidden Zone * Fusion Forum * Retro-Spec * Da Kings of the Jungle * Back2Back * The Regulators * Tit 4 Tat * E.F.Jay He also regularly composes the library/production music for radio and TV.

Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century A&C; Black, 2000, p169 It was the British affiliate of the Trotskyist International Liaison Committee until that body was renamed the International Trotskyist Committee. Although a small group, it immediately moved to producing a paper which was called Workers' International News in mimicry of the magazine of the war-time Workers International League. For a small group of no more than 35 members this was a major undertaking. The main concern of the new group was to clarify its ideas and where to concentrate their work. Therefore, the question of how to orient to the Labour Party was a major area of debate. On the one hand, comrades around Mike Jones, close to the views of the Workers' Party (Argentina) (PO), were for working in the Labour Party Young Socialists and were hostile to the United Secretariat of the Fourth International forces then in the Labour Party. This was an important question for the group as the Italian section of the TILC moved to join the USFI group in that country. On the other extreme of the group, Chris Erswell was supportive of the Italian TILC group's orientation. Meanwhile, the senior leader of the WIL, Pete Flack, found himself isolated when the rest of the National Committee opposed the Italian tactic of fusion with the USFI. The WIL was being pulled in different directions by other Trotskyist tendencies, with the TILC, PO and the Workers Power group all representing different poles of attraction. This became obvious at the first national conference of the group, held in December 1983. The conference solved none of the problems of the group and in January 1984 eleven supporters of the TILC left the WIL to establish the Workers International Review Group. The TILC refused to make them their official British section, instead choosing TILC sympathisers still in the WIL. They formed a Tendency for Political Clarification which was itself clarified when 3 of its 5 members left to join Workers Power. The remaining two members of the tendency then formed a Liaison Committee with the Workers International Review Group which led to the formation of the Revolutionary Internationalist League in November 1984,Barberis, P. et al. Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations: Parties, Groups and Movements of the 20th Century A&C; Black, 2000, p160 which was the British section of the International Trotskyist Committee (formed that summer from the TILC) until its split in 1991. The rump WIL would seem to have expired in the meantime.

Although traditionally made out of wood (typically rosewood, ebony or grenadilla) many modern manufacturers, such as Latin Percussion, offer claves made out of fiberglass or plastic. When struck, claves produce a bright, penetrating clicking noise. This makes them useful when playing in large dance bands. Claves are sometimes hollow and carved in the middle to amplify the sound.  History  Claves have been very important in the development Afro-Cuban music, such as the son and guaguanc√≥. They are often used to play an ostinato, or repeating rhythmic figure, throughout a piece known as the clave.Godfried T. Toussaint, ‚ÄúA mathematical analysis of African, Brazilian, and Cuban clave rhythms,‚Äù Proceedings of BRIDGES: Mathematical Connections in Art, Music and Science, Towson University, Towson, MD, July 27‚Äì29, 2002, pp. 157‚Äì168. Many examples of clave-like instruments can be found around the world.  Technique  Playing a pair of claves The basic principle when playing claves is to allow at least one of them to resonate. The usual technique is to hold one lightly with the thumb and fingertips of the non-dominant hand, with the palm up. This forms the hand into a resonating chamber for the clave. Holding the clave on top of fingernails makes the sound clearer. The other is held by the dominant hand at one end with a firmer grip, much like how one normally holds a drumstick. With the end of this clave, the player strikes the resting clave in the center. Traditionally, the striking clave is called el macho (\\"the male\\") and the resting clave is called la hembra (\\"the female\\"). This terminology is used even when the claves are identical. A roll can be achieved on the claves by holding one clave between the thumb and first two fingers, and then alternating pressure between the two fingers to move the clave back and forth. This clave is then placed against the resonating clave to produce a roll.Karl Peinkofer and Fritz Tannigel, Handbook of Percussion Instruments, (Mainz, Germany: Schott, 1976), 142.  Use in popular music  Among the bands to have used claves are the Beatles in their recording \\"And I Love Her\\" and The Who in their song \\"Magic Bus\\". Claves are also utilized in the interstitial spaces of the Night Court theme.  Use in classical music  Many composers looking to emulate Afro-Cuban music will often use claves such as Arturo Marquez with Danz√≥n No. 2 or George Gershwin with his Cuban Overture. Steve Reich's Music for Pieces of Wood is written for five pairs of claves.Steve Reich, Writings about Music, New York University Press, 1974.

The territory of the comune extends over an area of and is largely devoted to agriculture, in particular to vineyards growing the Grignolino and Barbera wine grapes. Although having only around 1,600 official residents, the population and activity within the village is enhanced by the presence of holiday homes and surrounding hamlets which officially lie within other village boundaries. History and main sights The name Refrancore derives from a battle fought between the Franks and Lombards. The battle was won by the Lombards and the blood spilt by the Franks tinted a local stream red giving the area the Latin name Rivus ex sanguine Francorum which literally means ‚ÄúA stream full of the Franks‚Äô blood‚Äù. This became abbreviated to Rivusfrancorum and eventually Refrancore. At one time there was a small castle on the hill above the village, a drawing of which appears in the Codex Astensis. The last remains of the castle were razed in the 19th century in preparation for the construction of a church which was never actually built. On the hill near the site of the Castle there is a 15th- century ricetto fort which has remained almost entirely intact. Presently it is used as a kindergarten and old people's home. The chapel which was part of the fort has been restored. In the main square there is a clock tower which is all that remains of the 18th-century parish church which was demolished at the start of the 20th century.

It is generally dependent on public funding. It is also the name of a book written by Fadela Amara, one of the leaders of the movement, with the help of Le Monde journalist Sylvia Zappi. In 2005 this movement inspired the creation of the similarly named Varken Hora eller Kuvad (sv) movement in Sweden. Fadela Amara was appointed as junior minister for urban policy in Fran√ßois Fillon's first government in May 2007. She left the government in 2010, and was named France's inspector general for social affairs in January 2011. NPNS was set up by a group of young French women, including Samira Bellil, in response to the violence being directed at them in the predominantly Muslim immigrant suburbs (banlieues) and public housing (cit√©s) of cities such as Paris, Lyon and Toulouse, where organised gang-rapes are referred to as tournantes, or \\"pass-arounds\\"). Goals  Ni Putes Ni Soumises fights against violence targeting women, including domestic violence and gang rape, as well as social pressures. The movement's platform for victims of domestic violence helps women and their children escape dangerous situations and supports them in the rebuilding of their lives after the fact. Its support team is made up of lawyers, psychologists, an educational specialist and a legal counsel. Ni Putes Ni Soumises also supports the White Ribbon Campaign, which runs from 25 November to 6 December every year, and uses this as an opportunity to promote 3919, the national domestic violence helpline. Ni Putes Ni Soumises White Ribbon Campaign poster The book cover of Ni Putes Ni Soumises. Ni Putes Ni Soumises also carries out awareness-raising seminars in schools in order to encourage students to think about gender equality and break the cycle of sexism. In this way, the movement was able to reach out to 950 students in 2016. The slogan used by the movement is meant both to shock and mobilise. Members particularly protest against changes of attitudes toward women, claiming there is an increased influence of Islamic extremism in those French suburbs with large immigrant populations. A particular concern is the treatment of Muslim women. Members claim that they may be pressured into wearing veils, leaving school, and marrying early. However, the movement represents women of all faiths and ethnic origins, all of whom may find themselves trapped by poverty and the ghettoisation of the cit√©s. A translation of the key points of NPNS's national appeal on its official website:Ni Putes Ni Soumises - Le Site Officiel - *No more moralising: our condition has worsened. The media and politics have done nothing, or very little, for us. *No more wretchedness. We are fed up with people speaking for us, with being treated with contempt. *No more justifications of our oppression in the name of the right to be different and of respect toward those who force us to bow our heads. *No more silence in public debates about violence, poverty and discrimination. Early history= Samira Bellil and Sohanne Benziane  Two high-profile cases gave a particular impetus to NPNS during 2003. The first was that of Samira Bellil, who published a book called Dans l'enfer des tournantes (\\"In Gang Rape Hell\\"). In the culture of the banlieues, organised gang-rapes are referred to as tournantes, or \\"pass- arounds\\"). In her book, Bellil recounts her life as a girl under la loi des cit√©s (the law of the ghetto) where she was gang raped on more than one occasion, the first time at age 13, afraid to speak out, and ultimately seen only as a sexual object, alienated and shunned by her family and some of her friends. The second case was that of 17-year-old Sohanne Benziane, who was burned alive by an alleged small-time gang leader.  Protest marches  In the wake of these events, members of Ni Putes Ni Soumises staged a march through France, which started in February 2003 and passed through over 20 cities before culminating in a 30,000-strong demonstration in Paris on 8 March 2003. The march was officially called la Marche des femmes des quartiers contre les ghettos et pour l'√©galit√© (The March of Women from the public housing against ghettoes and for equality). Representatives of Ni Putes Ni Soumises were received by French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin. Their message was also incorporated into the official celebrations of Bastille Day 2003 in Paris, when 14 giant posters each of a modern woman dressed as Marianne, the symbol of the French Republic, were hung on the columns of the Palais Bourbon, the home of the Assembl√©e nationale (the lower house of the French parliament). The following five propositions were accepted by the French government: #The publication of an educational guide dealing with respect, to be distributed in the housing projects and schools. #The establishment of safe houses away from the housing projects for girls and women in immediate distress, where they can be safe in relative anonymity. #The creation of six pilot sites where women will be able to have their voices heard. #The organisation of training seminars for women to develop their particular strengths. #Special provisions made in police stations for girls and women who have been the victims of violence.  Maison de la Mixit√©  The inauguration of the Maison de la Mixiti√©, the movement's premises in Paris' 20th arrondissement, took place in 2006. Then-President Jacques Chirac and then-future-President Fran√ßois Hollande both attended the event.  Recent history  In November 2016 Ni Putes Ni Soumises elected a new leadership team, with St√©phanie Rameau, a long-serving member and activist in the movement, voted president. In May 2017 Ni Putes Ni Soumises moved into its new premises at 80 rue de Paris in Montreuil, a largely working-class suburb of Paris.  Criticisms  Ni Putes Ni Soumises has been criticized by various French feminists and left-wing authors (Sylvie Tissot,Sylvie Tissot, Bilan d‚Äôun f√©minisme d‚Äô√âtat, in Plein Droit n¬∞75, December 2007 Elsa Dorlin,Elsa Dorlin (professor of philosophy at the Sorbonne, member of NextGenderation), \\"Pas en notre nom !\\" - Contre la r√©cup√©ration raciste du f√©minisme par la droite fran√ßaise (Not in our names!

The debate among the French Left concerning the 2004 law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools, mainly targeted against the Hijab, is to be seen under this light. They underline that, first, sexism is not specific to immigrant populations, French culture itself not being devoid of sexism, and second, that the focus on mediatic and violent acts passes under silence the precarization of women. Sylvie Tissot writes that Amara collaborated with the Cercle de l'Oratoire, and Mohammed Abdi, the current president of the NGO, is a member of this think-tank.Qui est Fadela Amara?

The ship was named after the city of Dayton, Ohio. The ship was launched 19 March 1944 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey, sponsored by Mrs. H. Rueger, and commissioned 7 January 1945, Captain Paul William Steinhagen in command. Construction for Dayton was underwritten in part by the citizens of the City of Dayton Ohio through the purchase of war bonds. Service history Dayton arrived at Pearl Harbor 15 May for training, and reached San Pedro Bay, Leyte, 16 June to join the 3rd Fleet. On 1 July, she sortied with the Fleet for the final strikes along the Japanese coast, screening the fast carrier task groups and conducting shore bombardments. She entered Tokyo Bay 10 September and, except for a brief period of upkeep at Eniwetok, remained on occupation duty until 7 November when she got underway for San Pedro, California, arriving 19 November. Dayton sailed from San Pedro 24 January 1946 and arrived at Pearl Harbor 6 days later en route to Japan. Her orders were changed and on 7 February she sailed to join the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, conducting training at Guantanamo Bay on her way to Norfolk, Virginia, her assigned home port. On 3 February 1947, Dayton sailed from Norfolk for a tour in the Mediterranean, exercising off Malta, and paying calls, including a diplomatic visit to Istanbul, Turkey. She sailed again for the Mediterranean in late July, where she served as the flagship of the Commander of Naval Forces, Mediterranean (COMNAVMED). During this cruise the ship was dispatched to Bari, Italy, to load rockets needed by the US and British forces protecting Trieste from insurgents allied with Yugoslavia. This deck cargo was unloaded in Trieste following a high speed run to that city in October 1947. This visit coincided with the announcement by the Western powers that Trieste would be turned over to newly formed Italian government. The citizens of the city chose the opportunity to demonstrate in favor of the decision and the crowd surged onto the pier where the Dayton was tied, causing concern over the security of the ship. The ship then sailed to Venice, tying up at San Marco Square. After a short visit in that city the ship returned to Trieste and shortly after returned to Boston on 30 November 1947. Following local operations from Newport and another cruise to the Mediterranean between 9 February and 26 June 1948, Dayton was placed out of commission, in reserve at Boston, on 1 March 1949. She was stricken from the Naval Register on 1 September 1961, and sold 6 April 1962, to Boston Metals, Baltimore, Maryland.
