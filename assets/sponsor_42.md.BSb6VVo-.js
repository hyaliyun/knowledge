Phelps' house was the namesake of Elmwood and Elmwood Township, Illinois. Descended from the colonist William Phelps, William J. Phelps is the father of William E. Phelps. Biography William Joshua Phelps was born in Burlington, Connecticut on March 2, 1808. He descended from William Phelps, who came to the United States in 1630 and was active in colonial government. He attended public school and worked on a farm during summers. He also attended a private academy. Phelps married Olivia B. Johnson on September 10, 1834. During his adulthood, Phelps would travel during winters for business. On one of these trips, he found an appealing area of Illinois and decided to move west and settle with his new wife. He arrived in Peoria County, Illinois in October 1834. Phelps owned over in the county. The land was rich in coal, which Phelps was able to ship out through the Peoria and Oquawka Railroad (later the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy). Phelps donated the land for the railroad's right-of-way. In 1835, Phelps was elected a justice of the peace, and a year later he was named a county commissioner. Phelps was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives as a Whig in 1840, serving one two-year term. He defeated his opponent, Norman H. Purple, by only seven votes. In 1866, Phelps founded a coal mining partnership with James Lee. The company eventually employed between 100 and 200 men. Phelps built a mansion near the mines and train station, which he named Elmwood after the surrounding grove of elm trees. When Phelps finally succeeded in securing a post office for the settlement in 1854, the town and township were named Elmwood and Elmwood Township. He had three children, though one died in infancy. His son William E. Phelps also served in the Illinois House. Phelps died on February 20, 1883 and was buried in Elmwood Township Cemetery.

Irene Parenti Duclos (or Irene Parenti, or her academic nickname Lincasta Ericinia) (1754‚Äì1795) was an Italian painter and poet. Her work as an expert copyist of old master paintings was highly valued in her era, and brought her honors from several Italian art academies. Moreover, she achieved particular renown as a pioneer in the revival of encaustic painting. Career Irene Parenti Duclos was the daughter of Tuscan painter Giuseppe Parenti, under whom she presumably received her earliest professional training. The first documented notice of Irene Parenti Duclos' painting activity is her 1773 petition to make painted replicas of works in Florence's Uffizi Gallery, where both male and female artists were permitted to set up their easels in its halls and copy after old master paintings and ancient marble statues.Sheila Barker, \\"Irene Parenti Duclos‚Äôs Copy of the Madonna del Sarto: Politics and Perfect Painting,\\" in Irene Parenti Duclos: A Work Restored‚ÄîAn Artist Revealed, ed. Linda Falcone (Florence: The Florentine Press, 2011), p. 28. Between 1773 and 1793, Duclos executed thirty-nine oil copies at the Uffizi, largely in response to the market demand for replicas from British Grand Tourists.Ibid. pp. 29-34; and Sheila Barker, \\"Studied Skills, Innate Talents: Women Artists at Work in the Uffizi\\" in Jane Fortune, Invisible Women: Forgotten Artists of Florence (Florence: The Florentine Press, 2010), p. 111. In addition to conventional oil painting, Duclos practiced the ancient technique of encaustic painting, a rare skill she had learned while in Bologna in 1784-85 from the Spanish Jesuit antiquarian Jos√© Mar√≠a Pignatelli (who was canonized much later in 1954).Tomo ventesimo delle Gazzette Toscane uscite settimana per settimana nell'anno 1785 (Florence: Anton-Giuseppe Pagani, 1785), 15 January 1785, p. 10; and Vincenzo Requeno, Saggi sul ristabilimento dell'antica arte de' greci e romani pittori (Parma: Stamperia Reale, 1787) vol. 1. pp. 350-1, 383.

Duclos made the work for herself, but several years later in 1781 it was offered to Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo for sale through the intervention of Giuseppe Pelli Bencivenni, then director of the Uffizi. The Grand Duke purchased Duclos' painting for 100 gold zecchini and displayed it in the Pitti Palace, where it hung until 1863 . In 1983, it was moved to Florence‚Äôs Galleria dell'Accademia.

Research carried out during the restoration suggests that Duclos traced the design of the original fresco onto paper, transferred the traced design onto her canvas using the spolvero technique, and carried out the painting within proximity to the original to achieve a close chromatic resemblance .Lari, Rossella. 2011. \\"The Restoration of Irene Parenti Duclos‚Äôs Madonna del Sacco: Comparing the Copy with Del Sarto‚Äôs Original\\" in Irene Parenti Duclos: A Work Restored‚ÄîAn Artist Revealed, ed.

It has since been supplanted by the membrane oxygenator as a result of advances in material science. Some continue to promote it as a low-cost alternative allowing greater self-sufficiency.  History  Open-heart surgery developed rapidly beginning in the 1950s, and many methods were developed for oxygenating blood outside the body. A bubble oxygenator was introduced in 1950 by Clark, Gollan, and Gupta. The method faced initial skepticism but in 1956 the University of Minnesota's De-Wall- Lillehei bubble oxygenator was demonstrated to be relatively simple, inexpensive, and easy to operate. The device faced competition from membrane oxygenators, which arrived within the same decade and were found to provide better oxygenation for periods over eight hours, and other advantages beyond six hours. However, most open-heart operations were substantially shorter, and by 1976 the bubble oxygenator was predominant. In the 1980s, microporous membrane oxygenators were developed, and replaced bubble oxygenators in most applications.

Jablonski (born 1953) is an American anthropologist and palaeobiologist, known for her research into the evolution of skin color in humans. She is engaged in public education about human evolution, human diversity, and racism. She is an Evan Pugh University Professor at The Pennsylvania State University, and the author of the books Skin: A Natural History, and Living Color: The Biological and Social Meaning of Skin Color. Early life and education Jablonski grew up on a farm in upstate New York State. With encouragement from her parents, Jablonski began her exploration into the world of science when she was quite young. She recalls exploring the nature around her home, digging for fossils near creeks and trees. Jablonski's interest in studying human evolution stemmed from watching a National Geographic feature on Louis Leakey, a famous paleontologist, that aired in the mid- 1960s. Louis Leakey's study at Olduvai Gorge in East Africa and his focus on the hominid Zinjanthropus boisei sparked Jablonski's attention. She instantly decided that she wanted to pursue the study of human evolution, dismissing her parents' desire for her to attend medical school. Jablonski earned an A.B. degree in biology from Bryn Mawr College in 1975. In 1978, after three years working as a Teaching Assistant in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Washington, she entered the PhD program at the University of Washington, receiving a PhD in anthropology in 1981 for her dissertation: Functional Analysis of the Masticatory Apparatus of Theropithecus gelada (Primates: Cercopithecidae) She was awarded a DPhil. (Honoris Causa) from Stellenbosch University in 2010. She has held teaching positions at the University of Hong Kong and The University of Western Australia. During these years, Nina began her research on the evolution of human bipedalism and skin color. Jablonski is married to George Chaplin, who is another professor as well as her research collaborator at Penn State University. She can also write and speak fluently in Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese), and is also able to write in both Latin and German. Career During her time at the University of Washington, Jablonski conducted research at the University of Hong Kong, in both the Department of Anatomy and the Prince Philip Dental Hospital. After completing her PhD, Jablonski was a lecturer in the Department of Anatomy at the University of Hong Kong from 1981 to 1990, where she was able to continue her research into comparative anatomy and paleontology. She began research in cooperation with the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing in 1982 and the Kunming Institute of Zoology in 1984. Additionally, Jablonski was inspired to begin her research on the natural history of human skin during her time in Hong Kong. After her time in Hong Kong, Jablonski moved to Australia with her husband, George Chaplin, where she worked in the Department of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of Western Australia from 1990-1994 as a senior lecturer. During this period of time, she began research on the evolution of human bipedalism and the evolution of human skin color, which is the foundation of her further research in anthropology. She thought the study on such topics was valuable for researchers to use the basic tools of comparative and historical biology to deduce what probably happened in the past. From 1994 to 2006, she held the Irvine Chair of Anthropology at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco. During this time, she was also a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Additionally, she was also an editor for The First Americans: The Pleistocene Colonization of the New World, a book about the ideas and opinions from analyzing the sources from Siberia to Chile, to tell the history of how the mankind found and got into the Americas. After leaving the California Academy of Sciences, she moved to Penn State University, where she served as head of the Anthropology Department from 2006 to 2011. She is currently an Evan Pugh Professor of Anthropology at Penn State University. Jablonski's main research topics at Penn State focus on the evolution of Old World monkeys, primate thermoregulation, and human skin pigmentation. Starting in 2012 in partnership with Henry Louis Gates, Jr., host of the PBS show Finding Your Roots, she started a curriculum to get younger students of color more interested in STEM. Research Jablonski researches human and primate evolution. She is known for her research into human skin, and has published two books on the subject. She researches the origin and evolution of the skin and skin pigmentation and the relationships between vitamin D requirements and metabolism in the context of human migration and urbanization. In 2012 she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to carry out research into human vitamin D production in natural conditions with the goal of informing public health interventions addressing vitamin D deficiency.  Skin color  Jablonski studies the physiological functions of skin as well as the evolutionary and sociological influences of the past and today. Early in her skin research, she published papers on the connection between neural tube defects and ultraviolet radiation which damages folate in the skin, in the controversial and non-peer reviewed journal Medical Hypotheses. She also collaborated with George Chaplin to study the pattern of melanin distribution among populations at different latitudes, discovering a correlation between skin color and the amount of ultraviolet radiation present in the individual's geographic location. Jablonski and Chaplin later theorized that dark skin with sweat glands evolved with the loss of hair and sexual dimorphism in skin color (with females tending towards lighter skin than males). Jablonski's major findings explain that the physiological purpose for the variation in skin color around the world is due to the balance between the need to protect against UV radiation and facilitating the production of vitamin-D. Heightened melanin levels occur in populations closer to the equator where UV radiation poses risks of folate damage and depigmentation occurs in areas with low levels of UV radiation so that vitamin-D biosynthesis is not inhibited. Jablonski has taken this connection and applied it to the modernizing lifestyle. Jablonski connects certain diseases and health risks to people living in areas where their skin color is maladaptive to the environment and people who are living the modern indoors lifestyle[11]. The main diseases she found to be connected with low levels of UV-B exposure are rickets and multiple sclerosis due to inadequate production of vitamin D. The main health problems related to too much UV radiation are cutaneous malignant melanoma, a type of skin cancer, as well as birth defects that are due to folate depletion.  Old World monkeys  Jablonski's research on Old World monkeys is marked by extensive paleontological field work across Africa and Asia. Her work has led to significant discoveries including an ape cranium in China, and the first identified chimpanzee fossils. In 2004, along with Sally McBrearty, Jablonski discovered teeth dating back to ~545,000 years ago in the Kapthurin Formation belonging to the genus Pan by comparing their measurements to those of modern Pan teeth. Paleoecological evidence at the site showed that chimpanzees were not restricted to forest habitats. Along with the discovery of nearby Homo fossils of the same age, this provided the first fossil evidence for spatiotemporal coexistence between the two genera. More recently, Jablonski's fossil discoveries have been complemented by phylogenetic analysis of modern apes, suggesting that genomic divergence in ancestral gibbons was in part due to habitat shifts during the Miocene‚ÄìPliocene transition. Jablonski's research on the genus Theropithecus also had significant impact, including the discovery of a near-complete skeleton of T. brumpti. This finding established T. brumpti as a terrestrial monkey similar to the modern T. gelada, albeit much larger. Her research is central to modern understanding of extinct Theropithecus size, habitat, and diet, much of which is detailed in Theropithecus: The Rise and Fall of a Primate Genus, edited by Jablonski. She has also written textbook analyses of the fossil record of tarsiers, gibbons, and Cercopithecoidea as a whole.  Primate thermoregulation  In 1994, Jablonski argued against a theory proposed by Peter Wheeler that thermoregulation played a role in hominids‚Äô transition to bipedalism. Wheeler hypothesized that there was evolutionary pressure for early hominids to adopt bipedalism because an upright stance with less surface area exposed to sunlight allowed them to forage for longer without overheating. Jablonski's team constructed their own models, which led to the conclusion that thermoregulatory benefits weren't significant enough for natural selection to favor bipedalism. In 2014, Jablonski began researching the adaptation of goose bumps because she was interested in the connection between the integument of ring-tailed lemurs and thermoregulation. The mechanism for goose bumps is the contraction of smooth muscle called Musculi Arrectores Pilorum (MAP). Jablonski noted that early primates did not have effective networks of MAP throughout the body, a factor that may have significantly affected their ability to forage under the cooler conditions of the late Eocene epoch. Using this information, she concluded that the absence of MAP networks in early primates likely contributed to their extinction in non-tropical latitudes. Jablonski also made connections between goose bumps and brain size, as the ability to regulate body temperature without changes in metabolism seemed to her a necessary adaptation to accommodate the thermal and metabolic sensitivities of larger brains. Jablonski is also interested in exploring how the behaviors of ring-tailed lemurs relate to thermoregulation. In 2016, she traveled to Madagascar where she concluded that lemurs depend on behaviors of sunbathing and huddling to retain heat. Publications * Jablonski, N. G.

At the Toronto Star, she gained notoriety for coverage of Toronto mayor Rob Ford's political and personal life, which led to her authoring the biography Crazy Town: The Rob Ford Story (2014). At The Globe, her focus is on sexual assault cases deemed \\"unfounded\\" by police in Canada.  Early life  Doolittle was born in 1984 in Sarnia, Ontario and grew up in Forest, Ontario, where her mother worked in human resources and her father worked for Eaton's building window displays. As a high-school student, Doolittle was actively involved in numerous extracurricular activities and wrote a column for the Sarnia Observer. Though she originally intended to study theatre, Doolittle has traced her desire to work in journalism from an experience at her high school prom where she felt that the police unfairly profiled her First Nations boyfriend. Doolittle was accepted into Ryerson University's journalism program in 2002, and from 2006 to 2007 she served as editor-in-chief of The Eyeopener, one of Ryerson's two weekly student newspapers. While editor-in-chief she clashed with a professor who cut the newspaper's staff and ran a headline attacking the professor. Journalism career=Toronto Star While a university student, Doolittle was hired as a summer intern at the Toronto Star. After helping to cover the trial of Conrad Black in Chicago, Doolittle was hired back as a full-year intern and then a staff reporter. Doolittle originally covered crime for the paper, but in 2010 was assigned to cover Toronto City Council. In 2013, Doolittle wrote a story with fellow reporter Kevin Donovan alleging that Rob Ford had been asked to leave the Garrison Ball, a military gala, because he was heavily intoxicated. Ford strongly denied this allegation. In part because of her role in writing the Garrison Ball story, she was approached by Mohamed Farah and Mohamed Siad, alleged members of the Dixon Bloods, about a video they had showing Rob Ford smoking crack cocaine. Doolittle was shown the video by Siad on a cell phone, but he refused to give it to the Star unless he was paid $100,000. After Siad also tried to sell the video to John Cook from Gawker, Gawker released a story about the video thus essentially forcing the Star to run their story shortly after. Ford denied smoking crack cocaine and the existence of the video, but he later admitted that he had smoked crack cocaine at least once after the existence of the video was confirmed by Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair. In April 2014, Doolittle left the Toronto Star to take a position as investigative reporter with The Globe and Mail (Toronto). In her blog, she acknowledged her time and experiences at the Star, calling it \\"an amazing paper,\\" and welcomed her opportunity to gain new experiences and learn from new associates at The Globe and Mail. Crazy Town Based on the notability of the Rob Ford crack video and her personal role in investigating it, Doolittle was offered a book deal by Penguin Books, but was given only three months to write the manuscript. Titled Crazy Town: The Rob Ford Story, the book was released in Canada and the United States in February 2014. The book immediately reached the top of Amazon Canada's bestseller list.Strapagiel, Lauren (4 February 2014). \\"Crazy Town: The Rob Ford Story debuts in top spot on Amazon: Author Robyn Doolittle on sexism, why Ford hasn't been arrested and that Gawker rivalry\\", Postmedia News. Retrieved 8 February 2014. In early February 2014, film producers Daniel Iron and Lance Samuels announced they had purchased the movie rights to Crazy Town. After the video was released by the Toronto Police Services, Doolittle acknowledged that she had recalled some details of the video incorrectly. On July 8, 2015, online retailer Kobo honoured Doolittle with its first annual non-fiction Kobo Emerging Writer Prize for Crazy Town. The prize came with a $10,000 cash award, and marketing assistance. The Globe and Mail At The Globe, Doolittle led a 20-month investigation which determined that 1 in 5 sexual assault cases in Canada is closed by police as \\"unfounded\\". As they are not reported to Statistics Canada, this artificially reduces the number of reports. In response to Doolittle's 2017 article, 37 272 cases were reviewed by various police departments and over 400 were reopened including 23 cases in the Canadian Armed Forces. In September 2018, the man who had raped the first victim that Doolittle interviewed for her investigation was sentenced to jail after having his case reopened. After police surveillance collected a sample of the man's DNA, they were able to match it with the victim's child, which had not been done before because the detective had accepted the man's claim that he was sterile at face value. The victim's lawyer, who is an expert on \\"unfounded\\" cases said that it was the first time he had seen such a case result in the criminal being brought to justice. Personal Doolittle lives in a condo in the Parkdale area of Toronto. She has two Pomeranians.

He was born at Mortham in Yorkshire, the second son of Thomas Rokeby and his wife Jane Constable; Jane was the daughter of Sir Robert Constable of Cliffe, Selby, who was executed in 1537 for his part in the Pilgrimage of Grace, and his wife Jane Ingleby. Ralph was educated at the University of Cambridge and Lincoln's Inn, where he was called to the Bar. He was first sent to Ireland in the service of Queen Elizabeth I in 1566; he was recalled to England early in 1569. At the end of the same year he was appointed the first Chief Justice of Connacht, with the task of introducing the system of common law into the Province of Connacht. He found it a discouraging job, writing to Lord Burghley that the people of Connacht \\"were unwilling to embrace justice\\". What was needed, in his view, was the subjugation of the province by military force: if this did not happen, and quickly, then the English must soon bid \\"farewell to Ireland\\". Powers to impose martial law in the province and to pursue the King's enemies with \\"fire and sword\\" were eventually granted, in 1604, some years after Rokeby's death, to the Chief Justice's superior, the Lord President of Connaught. Rokeby earned the good regard of Adam Loftus, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and of MP William FitzWilliam, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, both of whom suggested that he might in due course replace Loftus as Lord Chancellor. He returned to England for good in about 1577 and became Master of Requests about 1586. He was also employed on several commissions for the detection of recusants and traitors, including those which indicted William Parry and Anthony Babington. He sat as a judge at numerous treason trials, notably those of Philip, Earl of Arundel, Sir John Perrot, Dr Lopez and Patrick O'Collun. He was a Bencher of Lincoln's Inn and Master of St Katherine's Hospital near the Tower of London. He died on 14 June 1596 and was buried in St Andrew, Holborn. He never married, though since he obtained leave of absence to return to England for his wedding, he was then clearly intending to do so.; nothing seems to be known of the intended bride. Although he had several siblings, he chose to leave his property to a variety of charities.

Conceived by the French artillery officer Henri-Joseph Paixhans, the French contemporary sources report that the Monster Mortar had a caliber of 22 inches. Before the adoption of the metric system, several European countries had customary units whose name translates into \\"inch\\". The French pouce measured 27.88 mm, at least when applied to describe the calibre of artillery pieces (see also: Units of measurement in France and Mesures usuelles). 22 French inches are equivalent to 24 English inches. caliber mortar was cast at the Belgian royal foundry of Cannons in 1832 in Li√®ge, Belgium.

These mortars never saw action.  Service =Belgian revolution The Belgian Revolution that began in August 1830 led to the secession of the southern provinces from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and established an independent Kingdom of Belgium. The Dutch king William I intended to suppress the Belgian Revolution by invading Belgium on 2 August 1831. Over the course of the next few days Belgian forces were defeated several times in battle and Dutch troops advanced deep into Belgian territory until, on 8August, the Belgian government appealed to France for support. Following the Ten Days' Campaign of the French Arm√©e du Nord under Marshal √âtienne G√©rard, the Dutch troops started to withdraw. The King of the Netherlands ordered the Dutch General David Hendrik Chass√© to hold the Citadel of Antwerp at all costs with 4500 men. Siege of Antwerp From the citadel, Chass√© bombarded the city of Antwerp, setting fire to hundreds of homes and causing many casualties among the civilian population. These events led to the second intervention by the French. On 15November 1832, the French Arm√©e du Nord and its siege specialist Fran√ßois Haxo began to lay the Dutch troops under siege, quickly occupying Fort Montebello situated to the east of the citadel and to the south of the city from which they started firing at the citadel.

Phelps was born on October 9, 1835 in what would become Elmwood, Illinois. His father, William J. Phelps, founded the settlement. The family descended from early American settler William Phelps. When Phelps was fourteen, he began to attend Farmington Academy in winters while working on the family farm in summers. He graduated from Knox College when he was twenty- one and returned to the farm. More so than his father, Phelps was active in political affairs. When the Republican Party first fielded candidates in 1856, Phelps was a staunch supporter. He helped to organize a volunteer unit for the Civil War in Elmwood. In November 1863, Phelps was appointed Consulate General of Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he served for three years. While back in Illinois on May 17, 1864, during a leave of absence, he married Ellen A. Wiley. He learned about negotiations in Kronstadt regarding a sale of a steamboat to the Confederates for use as a blockade runner and provided information so that the Navy could intercept it before it saw use. He resigned in 1865 and returned to the family farm. In 1868, Phelps was elected as a Republican to the Illinois House of Representatives. However, after serving one term there, he became burdened by his business interests and resigned from politics. Phelps died on February 8, 1914, in Seattle.

Tensions between two factions started at the beginning of the Euromaidan during the police siege of the seized by protesters Kyiv City Council on December 11, 2013. When Spilna Sprava activists left the building to confront the riot police in the street, they were locked out by Svoboda militants and later accused of running away from the fight.

It has spread to several other parts of the world including the south coast of Britain, France, the Netherlands and the west coast of the United States. Description Perophora japonica is a colonial tunicate with a network of slender branching stolon on which small, rounded, translucent zooids some long occur at intervals. Younger regions of the colony are yellowish-green and the growing tips of the stolons may have star-shaped, bright yellow terminal zooids. These zooids are easily detached and can break off, float away and found new colonies. Distribution and habitat Perophora japonica is native to Japan, Korea and Peter the Great Gulf in Russia. but has spread to other parts of the world. In 1999 it was first seen off the coasts of the United Kingdom near Plymouth where it was growing on hydroids, brown seaweed and on panels of material placed in the sea to investigate the settling of marine larvae. Two years later it was reported eighty miles further east in the Fleet, Dorset and in another two years it was present in Guernsey. It appeared in waters off the Netherlands and France at much the same date and here it was growing on Sargassum muticum, species of Fucus and Laminaria, sponges, solitary tunicates, shellfish and directly on the underside of pontoons. On the western coast of North America it has been found in Humboldt Bay and San Diego Bay, California. It is probable that it was dispersed as a fouling organism on the hull of ships or accidentally as a result of aquacultural operations.

Warren and Rebecca Solnit. Those writers emphasized the significance of relationships of cultural dominance and ethics (Merchant, Plumwood, Donna Haraway) expressed as sexism (Haraway), spirituality (Starhawk), speciesism (Warren, Gaard), capitalist values that privilege objectification and the importance of vegetarianism in these contexts (Gaard). The main issues Ecofeminism aims to address revolve around the effects of a \\"Eurocentric capitalist patriarchal culture built on the domination of nature, and the domination of woman 'as nature'. The writer Luke Martell in the Ecology and Society journal writes that 'women' and 'nature' are both victims of patriarchal abuse and \\"ideological products of the Enlightenment culture of control.\\" Ecofeminism argues that we must become a part of nature, living with and among it. We must recognize that nature is alive and breathing and work against the passivity surrounding it that is synonymous with the passive roles enforced upon women by patriarchal culture, politics, and capitalism. The relevance of Ecofeminism was discussed in feminist art programs at the college and university level, including at the Institute for Social Ecology at Goddard College, Vermont. In the USA, as far back as 1962, an overwhelming series of lawsuits against the corporate world came from the kitchens of mothers and grandmothers. In 1964, Brazilian women set up the Ac√†o Democr√†tica Feminina Gaucha which soon evolved into an advocacy group for sustainable agriculture. Women around the world were coming together in an effort to break the \\"continuum of Eurocentric patriarchal capitalist exploitation of natural resources, women, and of indigenous peoples.\\" Overview The work of ecofeminist writers helped inspire many early male and female practitioners in the ecological art movement to imitate their concerns about a more horizontal relationship to environmental functions in their own practices. The feminist art writer Lucy Lippard, writing for the Weather Report Show she curated, which included many ecological artists and some ecofeminist artists from the list below (2007 Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art), commented on how many of those artists were women.Lucy, Lippard Weather Report 2007 Authors who have written about ecofeminist artists most prominently include Gloria Feman Orenstein.Orenstein, Gloria; Diamond, Irene \\"Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Ecofeminism\\" The Women's Environmental Art Directory (WEAD) is a compendium of women who self-identify as environmental artists, initiated by Jo Hanson and Susan Leibovitz Steinman in the 1990s, to credit women artists who might not otherwise be recognized by the mainstream art world. In addition to artists, some curators were influenced by ecofeminist thinking, such as Amy Lipton, co-curator of ecoartspace with Tricia Watts. Lipton initiated two relevant shows in her Soho gallery; Amy Lipton gallery history Shapeshifters (1992) which included 22 women artists to commemorate the women who were tried and killed for witchcraft in Salem and The Abortion Project, a pro-choice art exhibition.

An Iowa native, Noun wrote extensively on the history of feminism in Iowa and the United States, writing four books on the subject and an autobiography. As president of the Iowa Civil Liberties Union from 1964 to 1972, she was actively involved and helped fund the Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District case. In 1992, she accomplished a long-term goal and co-founded the Iowa Women‚Äôs Archives at the University of Iowa with activist Mary Louise Smith. In failing health, Noun committed suicide on August 23, 2002. Early life and education Louise Frankel Rosenfield was born on March 7, 1908, in Des Moines, Iowa. Her father, Meyer Rosenfield, was a successful owner of a Younkers department store. Her mother, Rose Frankel Rosenfield was a community activist who was very involved in the women's suffrage movement in Iowa and was close friends with Flora Dunlap, the president of the Iowa Women's Suffrage Association and the first president of the Iowa League of Women Voters. In a 1985 interview with Howard Simmons, Noun asserted that her father was more reticent and that her mother \\"ran the show with a firm hand.\\" Both parents were children of German-Jewish immigrants. Louise Rosenfield had two siblings, Ruth and Joseph. Louise Noun attended West High School in Des Moines, attending half-day sessions due to overcrowded conditions. She finished high school at the newly established Roosevelt High School in Des Moines and graduated in 1925. Noun pursued a bachelor's degree at Grinnell College, transferring to Wellesley College for her junior year, but returning to Grinnell upon hearing of her father's declining health. She graduated from Grinnell in 1929, later earning her M.A. in art history and museum management from Radcliffe College, graduating in 1933. Noun briefly attended Drake University Law School in 1967 for one semester. Personal life= Marriage and child  In 1936, Louise married Maurice \\"Maurie\\" Noun, a successful Des Moines dermatologist. After Maurice Noun returned from serving in World War II, the couple adopted a daughter, Susan, in 1946. During these years, Noun worked as a volunteer in community affairs. The couple divorced in 1967. Soon after, Maurice suffered a fatal heart attack. Louise Noun never remarried. Art collection Noun began her art collection at age thirteen when she was given an oil painting by Harry Lachman on her birthday, a story that was published in the Des Moines Register. While taking graduate courses in art history at Radcliffe College, Noun's interest in art grew; she later professed that she collected, without focus, works by Arthur Dove, Lyonel Feininger, and Henry Moore. Noun first collected art by women in 1963, purchasing art by Isabel Bishop. Finding the work without a signature, Noun contacted the artist and developed a friendship. Other works by female artists collected by Noun include Natalia Goncharova, Hannah H√∂ch, Frida Kahlo, K√§the Kollwitz, Gabriele M√ºnter, Agnes Pelton, and Marguerite Zorach. Some female artists protested the idea of women's only art collections, citing that segregating art collections implied that a women's only art collection was of a lesser value. One artist Noun collected, Dorothea Tanning, refused to show her work in women's only art shows. She left part of her collection to the Des Moines Art Center. Activism In 1944, Louise Noun joined the Des Moines chapter of the League of Women Voters and served as president in 1948‚Äì1949, igniting her long career of activism and philanthropy. Noun served as the president of the Iowa Civil Liberties Union (now the ACLU of Iowa) for 8 years from 1964 to 1972. In the late 1960s, Noun helped finance the landmark U.S. Supreme Court students' rights case Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, with her brother Joseph Rosenfield. Noun was a founding member of the Iowa Women's Political Caucus (1973) and the National Organization for Women(NOW) Des Moines chapter, serving as coordinator from 1972 and president from 1972 to 1974. Noun served on several committees including the Bernie Lorenz Recovery House (1988), of the Young Women's Resource Center (1975‚Äì1982), and the American Friends Service Committee. Noun founded the Chrysalis Foundation in 1989, serving as president until her death in 2002.  Iowa Women's Archives  Louise Noun and Mary Louise Smith, the former chair of the Republican National Committee, worked together to found the Iowa Women's Archives at the University of Iowa Main Library. The idea was conceived by Noun in the 1960s while researching Strong-Minded Women: The Emergence of the Woman-Suffrage Movement in Iowa. To fund the archives, Noun sold Frida Kahlo's 1947 painting \\"Self-Portrait with Loose Hair\\" at Christie's New York for 1.65 million dollars. The sale set a record for the most expensive work by a Latin American artist ever sold at auction. The painting was originally purchased by Noun for $85,000 in 1983. The University of Iowa Foundation undertook fundraising to contribute half a million dollars for the archives, which opened in 1992. The Louise Noun-Mary Louise Smith Iowa Women's Archives is open to the public and currently contains over 1100 manuscript collections of personal papers and records which record women's history in Iowa and other communities.  Louise Noun Library  The Louise Noun Library is scheduled to open in March 2017 at Des Moines' Young Women's Resource Center. Death Noun died on August 23, 2002 in Des Moines, Iowa. With declining health, Noun committed suicide by drug overdose, leaving behind a note denouncing the illegality of assisted suicide, which she termed her \\"final project\\" in her suicide note. This was in keeping with her personality and beliefs, friends said. \\"It has kicked off a debate about the importance of people being able to control their own lives, something that was always important to her,\\" said Gil Cranberg, who served with Ms. Noun on the national board of the American Civil Liberties Union in the 1970s. She was preceded in death by her daughter, who died one day earlier from complications related to brain cancer. Her grandson Jason is her only immediate survivor. Awards and legacy Noun was inducted into the Iowa Women's Hall of Fame in 1981. Among the many honors and awards Noun received after induction were: * Arts/Humanities/Aging Honor for outstanding service awarded by the Iowa Arts Council, * Iowa Humanities Board member; *Iowa Women's Hall of Fame, 1981 * Doctor of Humane Letters, honorary degree awarded by Cornell College, 1985 * Doctor of Humane Letters, an honorary degree, awarded by Drake University, 1991 * Outstanding Achievement Award in the Arts, given by the Iowa Arts Council on its 25th anniversary, 1992 * Peterson-Harlan Award, which recognizes an individual, group or organization that has made significant long-term or continuing contributions to Iowa history, 1993 * The Cristine Wilson Medal for Equality and Justice, 1993 * The Des Moines Roosevelt High School Hall of Fame, 1993 * The University of Iowa Alumni Award, 1994; the Philanthropic Vision Award from the Ms. Foundation, 1995 * The Award for Lifetime Services to the Public Humanities from the Iowa Humanities Board, 1996.

The Crisis of the Sixteenth Century (1521‚Äì1597), started with the VijayabƒÅ Kollaya, the division of the Sinhala Kingdom, then centered at Kotte. The country was divided among three brothers resulting in a series of Wars of Succession. It was also at this time that the Portuguese, whose arrival in Sri Lanka was largely accidental, intruded into the internal affairs of Sri Lanka, establishing control over the maritime regions of the island and sought to control its lucrative external trade. The Portuguese expanded their influence in the island by exploiting the political rivalries between the divided kingdoms, placing client rulers on the thrones of several kingdoms and directly ruling other areas. These machinations allowed them to control the Kingdom of Kotte from 1551, but the main beneficiary was the Kingdom of Sitawaka, which from 1521‚Äì87 was able to expand ‚Äì through conquest of other native kingdoms ‚Äì to cover most of Sri Lanka. Rajasinha I of Sitawaka then attempted to expel the Portuguese from the island, but was repulsed with heavy losses at the Siege of Colombo in 1587‚Äì8. Most of the newly conquered territories then rebelled against Sitawaka. The divided and disorganised rival kingdoms became easy targets for Portuguese expansion. In a series of military conflicts and political manoeuvres the Portuguese extended their control over the kingdoms of Jaffna (1591), Raigama (1593), and Sitawaka (1593). In 1592 the Portuguese placed a client ruler on the throne of the Kingdom of Kandy, but he died soon after in suspicious circumstances and they were forced to withdraw. Seeking to subdue the last major kingdom in Sri Lanka, the Portuguese launched a full military invasion of Kandy in the Campaign of Danture of 1594. The invasion was a disaster for the Portuguese, with their entire army wiped out by Kandyan guerilla warfare. The war became a stalemate, with further Portuguese attempts to conquer Kandy repeatedly repulsed, whilst the Kandyans were unable to oust the Portuguese from the rest of the island. A series of rebellions in both Portuguese held territory and the Kandyan Kingdom led both sides to agree to a truce in 1621. The treaty led to Kandy formally becoming a vassal state of Portugal, but in reality maintaining its independence. This allowed both sides to crush the rebellions in their respective territories, and ended direct conflict between them for the next seventeen years. The Portuguese were also able to conquer the Vanni chieftains in 1621. The uneasy peace was eventually broken by the intervention of the Dutch East India Company in 1638, who sought to exploit the situation to take over Portuguese possessions as part of the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War. The Dutch formed an alliance with Kandy; together they won several battles against the Portuguese, most notably the Siege of Galle in 1640. However, the Dutch-Kandyan alliance broke down and the three remaining powers fought each other in triangular warfare for a time. The Dutch and Kandyans renewed their alliance in 1649 to drive the Portuguese from the island. The Portuguese stronghold at Colombo was conquered in 1656, but once this was done the Dutch immediately betrayed their Kandayn allies, taking over the Portuguese possessions. The Crisis culminated in the collapse of the short lived but influential Kingdom of Sitawaka, and with Portuguese dominance, if not control by 1597, over two of three kingdoms that had existed at the start of the century, including the Jaffna Kingdom. The Kingdom of Kandy was the only independent Sinhalese kingdom to survive thus beginning the Kandyan period (1597‚Äì1815). By the end of the war in 1658 all Portuguese forces had been expelled from the island. The Kingdom of Kandy was the only surviving indigenous polity, ruling almost half of Sri Lanka. The Dutch were left in control of the major population centres.  Origin  The Portuguese arrived in Sri Lanka in 1505S.G. Perera p. 8. and established trade relations with the Kotte kingdom.S.G. Perera p. 11. During the early 16th century their intentions were directed towards defending their trading interests, particularly the lucrative spice trade.Gaston Perera p. 144. However, with time this policy gradually changed to territorial ambitions with the objective of outright conquest.Gaston Perera p. 145. Island resources, Sri Lanka's strategic location for both trade and naval security and rise of the Mughal Empire in India influenced this change.Gaston Perera pp. 145‚Äì146. Spoiling of Vijayabahu in 1521 In 1521, the three sons of the Kotte king Vijayabahu VII rebelled against their father. After killing Vijayabahu, his sons (Bhuvanekabahu, Pararajasingha, and Mayadunne) divided the kingdom among themselves in the 'Spoiling of Vijayabahu'. Mayadunne received the Kingdom of Sitawaka, Pararajasingha was given the Principality of Raigama (taking the name Raigama Bandara), and Bhuvanekabahu ruled over the remaining part of Kotte (as Bhuvanekabahu VII). This event began the Crisis of the Sixteenth Century. The rivalries between these three new realms gave the Portuguese an opportunity to expand their influence on the island, by becoming involved in its internal politics.Rajavaliya p. 77.S.G. Perera p 20. At first the Portuguese limited themselves to securing their share of the cinnamon trade in Colombo and supporting - and defending - their allies the rulers of Kotte. It was only after Dom Jo√£o Dharmapalla converted to Christianity and bequeathed his kingdom to the King of Portugal upon his death in 1597, that the Portuguese regarded Kotte as their territory, and considered the conquest of the entire island to secure it.  Early stages 1521‚Äì1538  During the initial encounters, the Portuguese lent their assistance to the Bhuvanekabahu VII of Kotte to defend against the attacks from Sitawaka.S.G. Perera pp. 18‚Äì23. Their influence over the Kotte grew with the military aid they provided.  Sitawaka expansion 1538‚Äì1587  Growth of the Sitawaka kingdom from 1521 to 1587 In 1551, this uneasy alliance came to an end with the death of Bhuvanekabahu VII of Kotte. Bhuvanekabahu was killed by a shot fired by a Portuguese soldier, which was claimed to be an accidental discharge of the weapon.Paul E. Peiris pp. 115‚Äì116.Rajavaliya p. 79. Following Bhuvanekabahu's death his young grandson, Dharmapala of Kotte, was established on the Kotte throne under the protection of the Portuguese. Later he converted to Christianity and became a vassal of Portuguese emperor.S.G. Perera pp. 37‚Äì44. This sparked a series of campaigns between the Portuguese and the SinhaleseQueyroz pp. 326‚Äì341. who were led first by the Kingdom of Sitawaka and then by the Kingdom of Kandy. Siege of KotteBattle of MulleriyawaThe Siege of Colombo 1587-1588 Having conquered Kandy, King Rajasinha I of Sitawaka turned his attention to the Portuguese stronghold at Colombo. He timed the campaign to begin shortly after the start of the monsoon season, so the Portuguese would not be able to send reinforcements by sea. The Sinhalese army appeared around Colombo on 4 June, consisting of 50,000 men, 2200 pack elephants, 40,000 oxen, and 150 small calibre bronze cannon. Supporting the army were 65 light galleys which were to blockade the fortress by sea. The Portuguese captain defending Colombo was Jo√£o de Correia de Brito, who had 300 Portuguese soldiers assisted by 700 Lascarins, plus a civilian population of some 60,000. Foreseeing the possibility of a siege, he had stockpiled supplies of food and ammunition. The Portuguese flotilla of 6 galleys was beached due to the weather, but nevertheless Brito sent a small craft over the sea to Goa with a distress call.Saturnino Monteiro (2011) Portuguese Sea Battles - Volume IV - 1580-1603 p. 195 Plan view of Portuguese Colombo, made in 1650 Knowing of Colombo's defences, which included a lagoon serving as a moat by its southern side, Rajasinha began the siege by having entrenchments dug around the walls and the lagoon drained, which took a month. With the digging complete, Rajasinha rallied his entire army outside Colombo in a display of force, shouting war-cries to intimidate the besieged. Undaunted, Brito ordered a sally against the troops closest to the city, throwing them into great confusion.Monteiro 2011, p. 197 On the night of 3 August, the Rajasinha ordered the first mass assault. Thousands of Sinhalese attempted to scale Colombo's earthen walls, while sappers (aided by hundreds of elephants) tried to breach them. They were met with superior Portuguese firepower. Some Sinhalese were able to climb onto the bastions S√£o Louren√ßo and S√£o Gon√ßalo, but were repelled by a swift Portuguese counter attack. By the following morning, the Sinhalese had been driven off, having suffered 400 dead and 2,000 wounded.Monteiro 2011, p. 198 Over the following months Rajasinha attempted three more assaults on Colombo, along with attempts to undermine the walls, while the Portuguese conducted sorties against Sinhalese positions. With the end of the monsoon, the first Portuguese reinforcements from Goa arrived on 11 September. Further ships carrying reinforcements arrived on 4 October, 23 October, 4 November, and 15 February. Finally, on 18 February a large fleet of eighteen galleys commanded by Manuel de Sousa Coutinho arrived, after raiding Sitawakan shores in northwestern Sri Lanka. The fleet sailed in battle formation and sounded its guns; the Portuguese defenders greeted it by ringing their church bells and firing a general salvo from the fortress' cannon.Monteiro 2011, p. 202 With the arrival of the reinforcements, there were now 2,000 Portuguese soldiers inside the fortress, in addition to the lascarins and civilian defenders. Rajasinha realised that the opportunity to take Colombo had been lost and lifted the siege shortly afterwards. Over the eight-month campaign, the Sinhalese had lost 5,000 men.Monteiro 2011, p. 203  Portuguese campaign in Jaffna and takeover of Sitawaka 1588‚Äì1593  In 1588 Kandy rebelled against its new Sitawaka rulers. However, the heirs of the Kandyan royal family had fallen under Portuguese influence and were held in Colombo. In 1592 the Portuguese intervened in Kandy, placing their prot√©g√© Yamasinghe Bandara on the throne. However, the new ruler died in suspicious circumstances shortly after his coronation. The Portuguese accused a rival Kandyan faction of poisoning Bandara, but the Kandyans blamed the Portuguese, who were forced to withdraw. Vimaladharmasuriya I became the new king of Kandy. Meanwhile, the Jaffna Kingdom in the north of the island fell increasingly under Portuguese influence. In 1591 a Portuguese expedition deposed (and killed) the Jaffna king Puviraja Pandaram, then installed his son Ethirimana Cinkam as a client ruler. In 1593 Sitawaka forces attempted to re-take Kandy, but were repulsed and their king Rajasinha I died of disease contracted during the fighting. One of the rival claimants to his throne defected to the Portuguese, enabling them to take complete control over Sitawaka.  Campaign of Danture 1594  Key locations in the Campaign of Danture, 1594 The Portuguese tried again to put their preferred candidate on the throne of Kandy as a client ruler. This time it was Dona Catarina, a Kandyan princess who had been entrusted to the care of the Portuguese and brought up in a Catholic European style. She was then aged ten or twelve. Pedro Lopes de Sousa led a force of about 20,000 in an invasion of Kandy, of which one thousand were Portuguese troops (the majority transferred from Goa in India for the expedition), 15,400 native Lascarin allies, 47 elephants used as pack animals, and the remainder Badaga mercenaries from India and coolie labourers. The initial number of opposing Kandyan forces is unknown, but is estimated at 10,000. The defenders held a distinct advantage in the terrain, as Kandy is a mountainous region and the invading force would be forced to traverse well-defended mountain passes. The Portuguese stormed the pass at Balana with heavy losses, after which the Kandyan forces began to retreat before the invaders. The Portuguese were able to enter the capital Kandy without resistance, finding it abandoned by King Vimaladharmasuriya I. Dona Catarina was crowned as the new ruler of the Kingdom of Kandy. However, she and her Portuguese advisers were unpopular rulers, particularly after rumours spread that she was to be married to a Portuguese husband (as the Portuguese were indeed planning). Vimaladharmasuriya's forces engaged in guerilla tactics, attacking Portuguese foraging parties and cutting off lines of supply and communication. A large Portuguese-Lascarin raiding party of 3,000 men was surrounded and destroyed in the Uva region. Shortly thereafter, evidence was found that Jayavira Bandara Mudali, one of the Lascarin chieftains, was preparing to betray the Portuguese to Vimaladharmasuriya. Part of this evidence was later shown to be fabricated by Vimaladharmasuriya, but Jayavira was killed as a traitor before this was realised. Portuguese soldiers kill the Lascarin leader Jayavira and his attendants, who were suspected of treason. Woodcut by Philippus Baldaeus. The death of Jayavira led many of the Lascarins to desert, along with all of the Badaga mercenaries. Less than a thousand native allies were left with the Portuguese forces, who were now massively outnumbered, lacking supplies, and faced a mass rebellion. The Portuguese attempted to retreat from Kandy to the fort at Balana. Losses to guerilla warfare and further Lascarin desertions reduced their forces to about 360 Portuguese and an equal number of Lascarins by the time they reached Danture. In contrast, defections and troops arriving from other parts of the kingdom had swelled Vimaladharmasuriya's forces to about 20,000 men. At Danture, the Portuguese forces were attacked as they retreated. The organised columns disintegrated in the forest and most were wiped out. Sousa surrendered with the remaining 93 European troops. In a departure from usual Sinhalese warfare, the prisoners were tortured and mutilated. Sousa died of the wounds he sustained during the fighting. With the exception of a patrol sent back to the lowlands during the early part of the campaign, only three Portuguese soldiers escaped back to Colombo. Vimaladharmasuriya solidified his control over Kandy by marrying Dona Catarina. In an attempt to prevent further Portuguese incursions he built new fortifications in the Balana pass.  Portuguese consolidation of Kotte and attacks on Kandy 1595‚Äì1617  Political situation in Sri Lanka in the early 17th century With the death of Pedro Lopes de Sousa at Danture, Dom Jer√≥nimo de Azevedo succeeded him as Captain-General of Ceylon, and despite the losses in the battle, Kandy was unable to advance into the lowlands as the Portuguese forts and garrisons remained intact.Chandra Richard De Silva (1972) The Portuguese in Ceylon 1617-1638 H. W. Cave & Company, Colombo Dom Jer√≥nimo proceeded to reform Kotte's provincial administration, dividing it into four provinces, or disavas, each administered by the eponymous disava, with military and judicial powers. The tax system was also reformed and the old system of tributes replaced with fixed mandatory payments. The original military system of castes and levies however, remained organized under the local mudaliar commanders, who assisted the Portuguese troops. Dom Jer√≥nimo also encouraged missionary work by the Jesuits, Augustinians and Dominicans in addition to the Franciscans.C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 12 Nevertheless, the defeat at Danture sparked a number of uprisings in Kotte which Dom Jer√≥nimo had to defeat before he could move on Kandy. He considered the defeat of Kandy an utmost priority to secure Sri Lanka and secured Kotte first with the construction of fortified encampments in Matara, Sabaragamuwa, Manikkadawara, and Malwana, where he established the army HQ.C. R. de Silva (1972) p. 13 By 1603, Kotte was firmly secured and Dom Jer√≥nimo led his troops into Kandy through the mountain pass, where he seized the Kandian fort at Balana and proceeded towards the city of Kandy itself. However, the kingdom could not be subjugated then due to a rebellion among the Lascarins, and was forced to return to Colombo. Unable to capture Kandy, Dom Jer√≥nimo adopted a policy of first weakening Kandy through devastating raid warfare by land, twice every year, at harvest time, resorting to light contingents of troops, while blockading the eastern Kandian ports of Trincomalee and Batticaloa by sea, between 1604 and 1612 with considerable success. This coincided with a succession crisis in Kandy after the death of King Vimaladharmasuryia in 1604, that was only solved months later with the succession of his cousin Senarat to the throne. Senarat proved to be an unpopular ruler and unable to prevent the Portuguese from causing great devastation upon Kandian villages and crops. In 1612, Dom Jer√≥nimo was appointed as the next viceroy of Portuguese India and was succeeded in Sri Lanka by Dom Francisco Meneses (1612‚Äì1614), Manuel Mascarenhas Homem (1614‚Äì1616), and Dom Nuno √Ålvares Pereira (1616‚Äì1618). Because of his great experience in Sri Lanka, as viceroy Dom Jer√≥nimo de Azevedo kept the Portuguese garrisons well supplied and reinforced, which caused the depopulation of Kandy on account of the systematic Portuguese raids.C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 15  Rebellions against both powers and submission of Kandy 1617‚Äì1621  A Portuguese illustration of Sinhalese warriors, produced Uprisings in Portuguese territory The taxes imposed by the Portuguese, and the desecration of Buddhist temples by missionaries caused great discontent among the Sinhalese peasantry and in late 1616 an uprising broke out in Sabaragamuwa. Disava Filipe de Oliveira's forces camped in the Seven Korales were dispatched south, but in his absence, in December 1616 a much greater revolt broke out in eastern Seven Korales, led by a disgraced grain measurer who claimed to be the grandson of Rajasinha, late prince Nikapitiya Bendara, dead since 1611. Senarat immediately took the opportunity to support Nikapitiya with a force of 2000 men commanded by the former rebel leader Kangara Aratchi, and the Prince of Uva, Kuruvita Rala, to march his forces southwards into Matara and Sabaragamuwa. Under these conditions, the Portuguese were overwhelmed: part of Sabaragmuwa and Matara were overrun while a considerable portion of the Seven Korales fell to Nikapitiya's rebellion.C. R. de Silva 1972, pg. 22-23 Rebellion in Kandy Despite initial cordiality, Senarat quickly grew distrustful of Nikapitiyas' success and attitude towards Kandy. Fearing a future rival, he withdrew all his aid and ordered Kuruvita Rala to suspend operations while he attempted to gain a truce with the Portuguese. This in turn caused Kuruvita Rala, a native from Kotte, to rebel in indignation against Senarat, choosing instead to ally with Nikapityia, march against his former ruler, and invite Mayadunne of Denawaka exiled in India to become King of Kandy instead (since his lowly caste disallowed him from crowning himself king). In this regard, C.R. de Silva considers Kuruvita Rala to have been \\"the true Sinhalese patriot, for it was he who put national above dynastic interests\\".C. R. de Silva 1972, pp. 25‚Äì26 A Portuguese illustration of Sinhalese women and children, produced Kuruvita Rala, ruling much of southern Sri Lanka including the port of Batticaloa, now posed a much graver threat to Senarat than Nikapitiya. Thus, after recapturing the Balana fort from the Portuguese turned to them for a treaty and an alliance, but only when he released all the Portuguese prisoners was captain-general Dom Nuno √Ålvares Pereira convinced that Senarat's proposal was genuine.C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 27 The Luso-Kandian Treaty By this sudden turn of events, in August 17 an agreement between the Portuguese and Kandy was reached and a treaty put into effect. In negotiating with the Portuguese, Senarat proved rather capable, refusing most of Portuguese demands but stil had to formally pledge vassalage to the King of Portugal, agree not interfere in missionary work in Kandy (Senarat even entrusted his children to be educated by Franciscans), offer several noblemen as hostages in Colombo and pay two large elephants a year as a token tribute. The Portuguese on their part agreed to a formal alliance and recognized Senerat as the rightful King of Kandy.C. R. de Silva 1972, pp. 32‚Äì34 With the coming of favourable winds in March 1617, important Portuguese reinforcements had arrived in Colombo. In June, developments in Jaffna favoured the Portuguese as Cankili I usurped the throne through a coup and in exchange for Portuguese recognition, agreed to prevent supplies and weapons from reaching the rebels from there. Between July and September the Portuguese were able to recapture the Seven Korales, and Nikapitiya fled to the jungles inhabited by the Vanni in northeastern Sri Lanka, never to be seen again.C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 31 Portuguese conquest of Jaffna 1619 Maximum extent of Portuguese Ceylon (cyan), after the conquest of Jaffna in 1619 and the Vanni Chieftains in 1621 Although the Portuguese confirmed Cankili as the ruler of Jaffna, Cankilis' brutal murder of political rivals made him an unpopular ruler, and incapable of preventing dissatisfaction especially from the rising number of native Christians of the Kingdom. In August 1618, a rebellion instigated by Christian mudaliars Dom Pedro and Dom Luiz and aided by local Portuguese casados evicted Cankili from the throne, but was eventually suppressed with the assistance of 5000 men of the Hindu Nayak of Tanjore, in south-east India.C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 42 As Cankili was a weak ruler who failed to prevent growing unrest in the kingdom, to pay due tribute to the Portuguese, and was rumoured to be allowing supplies to reach the southern rebels and even seeking aid from the Dutch, in March 1619 the Portuguese captain-general of Ceylon Dom Constantino de S√° decided to dispatch Filipe de Oliveira ahead of 230 Portuguese and 3000 lascarins to subjugate Jaffna. Furthermore, the captain-general had received reports that a Christian Malabarese privateer on the service of the Zamorin, Dom Pedro Rodrigues, was attacking Portuguese and allied shipping in the vicinity of the island of Mannar, and tasked Oliveira to deal with the issue en route.C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 44 Upon reaching Mannar, Dom Pedro sailed away, and Oliveira proceeded towards Jaffna. Once there, he demanded the payment of due tributes but as negotiations with Cankili failed, in June the Portuguese-Sinhalese forces of Filipe de Oliveira marched on the capital Nallur, defeated the Tamil forces at Jaffna, captured Cankili and formally annexed Jaffna to the Portuguese Crown.C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 46 The ancient capital of Jaffna was moved to the coastal city of Jaffna itself (Jafanapat√£o), and with the kingdom secured from outside threats by February 1621, navigation in the Palk Strait became much safer. Cankili was sent to Goa to face trial, where he was found guilty. However, he agreed to convert before being formally executed.C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 47 Developments in southern Sri Lanka Portuguese soldiers in Asia in the 17th century, painted by Andr√© Reinoso Elsewhere, in early 1620 Senarat achieved another truce ‚Äì with Mayadunne and Kuruvita Rala ‚Äì by promising them the throne of Kotte instead. Only by June 1620 did the Portuguese captain-general Dom Constantino de S√° de Noronha manage to recapture the southern lowlands, for Kuruvita Rala was a skilled and popular commander and knew the territory well.C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 36 A month later, Kuruvita Rala was himself ambushed and killed by the disava of Matara Dom Costantino Barreto (a Christian Sinhalese) in Panama, southeastern Sri Lanka. The departure of Mayadunne of Denawaka back to India in March 1621 brought the end of the rebellion in Kandy, and peace between the Portuguese and Kandy.C. R. de Silva 1972, p. 54 The Danish Portuguese drawing of the Koneswaram temple The second European power to establish a foothold on Sri Lanka were the Danes. In 1620, Senarat received the first expedition of the Danish East India Company led by Ove Gjedde, who reached Sri Lanka after a perilous journey of over two years, that claimed more than half its personnel. Senarat placed great expectations on a Danish alliance against the Portuguese and agreed to sign a treaty and grant them the port of Trincomalee, where the great Koneswaram temple was located. However, until the Danish could prove capable against the Portuguese, Senarat was not willing to relinquish his hard-won peace with them or grant the Danes any further concessions. Thus, just two weeks after the treaty was signed, the Danish evacuated Trincomalee and left for Tranquebar in Tanjore, where they established a fort.C. R. de Silva 1972, pg. 53-54  Dutch intervention 1638‚Äì1658  Dutch forces storm the fort of Galle in 1640, by Philippus Baldaeus The kingdoms of Spain and Portugal had been in dynastic union under the Spanish Habsburgs since a Portuguese succession crisis in 1580. This Iberian Union possessed a vast empire of colonial possessions, but lacked the strength (particularly naval forces) to defend them. Other colonial powers sought to take advantage of this weakness to obtain their own empires, particularly after the collapse of the Iberian economy in 1627. The Spanish overseas possessions were generally better defended than Portuguese ones, which were widely scattered and difficult to reinforce. The rival Dutch Empire ‚Äì engaged in the Eighty Years' War against its former master, Spain ‚Äì concentrated its overseas efforts on conquering parts of the Portuguese Empire in the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) sought to oust the Portuguese from the East Indies and Indian subcontinent so they could control the lucrative spice trade. Seeing an opportunity to undermine the Portuguese on Sri Lanka, the VOC made contact with the Kingdom of Kandy. Confidence in the Kandyan forces rose after they defeated a Portuguese army at the Battle of Gannoruwa in March 1638. Shortly thereafter, the VOC and Rajasinha II of Kandy signed a treaty in May 1638, by which the VOC promised to aid Kandy in its continuing war against the Portuguese in exchange for a monopoly on many trading goods. The combined VOC and Kandyan forces gradually wore down the Portuguese forces, pushing them out of their strongholds across the island. Batticaloa on the East coast fell to Dutch forces in 1639, then Negombo on the West coast in 1640. Galle was captured after a siege in 1640, providing the Dutch with a port and naval base. However the Kandyans became suspicious of their new allies, correctly believing that the VOC goal was not just to remove the Portuguese from Sri Lanka, but to replace them as the colonial power. The alliance fell apart after a ceasefire was agreed between Dutch and Portuguese forces at some point between 1641 and 1645. Kandyan forces engaged in skirmishing with both Dutch and Portuguese forces over the following years, but were unable to make inroads. The VOC and Kandy returned to negotiations and reformed their alliance in 1649, albeit on different terms. Meanwhile, the Iberian Union had ended in 1640, depriving the Portuguese colonies of Spanish support. The Peace of M√ºnster in 1648 had ended the Dutch war with Spain (but not Portugal). These developments together acted to free up Dutch forces from other conflicts, allowing them to concentrate on their attacks on Portuguese colonies. The VOC-Kandy alliance went on the offensive in Sri Lanka from 1652. Whilst Kandy controlled the interior of the island, it was landlocked and the Dutch fleet were able to dominate the coast. Two naval actions were fought between the Dutch and Portuguese on 23 March near Colombo and 2 May 1654 near Goa; the Portuguese won the first battle but lost their entire Indian subcontinent fleet in the second. The Dutch placed the main Portuguese base of Colombo under siege in 1655. Rajasingha no longer trusted the Dutch and insisted that Colombo be ceded to Kandy as soon as it fell. However, when the city finally fell in 1656, the Dutch immediately closed the gates against their ally. Faced with a complete breakdown in relations with the Dutch, the Kandyan's broke off the alliance and pillaged the area around Colombo. They then retreated back inland and resumed their war with the Dutch, which would continue intermittently for the next century. The last Portuguese forces were expelled from Sri Lanka entirely in 1658. The VOC was left in control of Colombo and much of the surrounding coastline, forming Dutch Ceylon.  Aftermath  By the end of the war, the Portuguese had lost all of their possessions in Sri Lanka along with their trading rights. Portuguese Ceylon ceased to exist. The Dutch were left in control of numerous ports and fortifications along the coastline, along with the major population centres of Colombo and Galle. Their possessions on the island were organised into the colony of Dutch Ceylon. Over the following century the colony gradually expanded its holdings in Sri Lanka, and engaged in sporadic warfare with Kandy. Eventually the Kew Letters of 1795 led to the transfer of the Dutch possessions on the island to the British in 1796, forming British Ceylon. The Kingdom of Kandy retreated to the highlands in the interior and east of the island. They continued to resist European influence on Sri Lanka, engaging in skirmishing and guerilla warfare without making significant inroads into the lowlands. Kandy maintained its independence until 1815 when it ceded its power to the British. NotesReferences=CitationsBibliography  B. Gunasekara, The Rajavaliya. AES reprint.

Originally raised from the workers of Woolwich Arsenal, near London, it later became a London unit of the Territorial Force and served on the Western Front during World War I. Postwar it was merged with another London unit. Origins When an invasion scare in 1859 led to a flood of volunteers forming new military units to defend Great Britain, it was natural that men working at Woolwich Arsenal would organise themselves into an Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVC). (They also formed the 26th (Royal Arsenal) Rifle Volunteer Corps, which eventually became the 20th (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Blackheath and Woolwich).)Beckett Appendix VII.4th Kent (Royal Arsenal) Rifle Volunteers at Regiments.org Formally constituted on 28 February 1860, and designated the 10th (Royal Arsenal) Kent AVC from August that year, the unit was manned by artisans from the Shot and Shell Factory. The nearby Royal Dockyards at Deptford and Woolwich also raised an AVC, numbered 14th (Royal Dockyard) Kent AVC. However, the dockyards closed in 1869 and the 14th Kent AVC was disbanded the following year. Originally raised as eight batteries, the strength of the 10th Kent AVC declined to six batteries during the 1860s, but it also had the small 2nd and 3rd Essex AVCs attached to it. The 9th Kent AVC, formed in 1860 at Plumstead, near Woolwich, was also absorbed by the 10th in 1873.Beckett, p. 75 and Appendix VIII.Frederick, p. 661.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 98‚Äì102.3rd Kent Artillery Volunteers at Regiments.org In 1875, the 10th Kent Artillery Volunteers won the Queen's Prize at the National Artillery Association annual competition held at Shoeburyness Old Ranges.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 189. In July 1880 many of the AVCs were consolidated, and the 10th Kent became the 3rd Kent Volunteer Artillery (Royal Arsenal), with its HQ and eight batteries at Woolwich, and the Essex and Plumstead units subsequently resumed their independent identities as the 3rd Essex (September 1880) and 2nd Kent (March 1883). The 3rd Kent became part of the London Division of the Royal Artillery on 1 April 1882, changing to the Eastern Division on 1 July 1889. As well as manning fixed coast defence artillery, some of the early Artillery Volunteers manned semi-mobile 'position batteries' of smooth-bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. But the War Office refused to pay for the upkeep of field guns for Volunteers and they had largely died out in the 1870s. In 1888 the 'position artillery' concept was revived and some Volunteer companies were reorganised as position batteries to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades. On 14 July 1892 the 3rd Kent was converted to position artillery with four batteries. The unit did well in this role, winning the Queen's Prize for position artillery at Shoeburyness for 1895, 1897 and 1898.Beckett, p. 178.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 6. On 1 June 1899 all the Volunteer artillery units became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) and with the abolition of the RA's divisional organisation on 1 January 1902, the unit was redesignated 3rd Kent Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers). Territorial Force By the time that the Territorial Force was formed under the Haldane reforms of 1908, Woolwich had been transferred from Kent to the new County of London, and henceforth the unit was administered by the London TF Association. It became II London Brigade of the Royal Field Artillery (RFA), assigned to the TF's 1st London Division with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 678.London Gazette, 20 March 1908Litchfield, p. 151. II London Brigade RFA * 4th County of London Battery * 5th County of London Battery * 6th County of London Battery * II London Ammunition Column World War I=Mobilisation and organisation Annual training for 1st London Division had just started when war was declared on 4 August 1914, and the II London Brigade promptly mustered at Woolwich for mobilisation.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 141‚Äì7. The infantry of the division were soon posted away to relieve Regular Army garrisons in the Mediterranean or to supplement the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. By January 1915, only the artillery and other support elements of the division remained in England, and these were attached to the Second Line TF division (58th (2/1st London) Division) that was being formed. The unit was numbered 1/II London Bde and formed a separate 2/II London Bde, which served with the 58th Division throughout the war.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 9‚Äì15.56th (1st London) Division at Long, Long Trail58th (2/1st London) Division at Long, Long Trail 1/II London Brigade 18-pounder Mk II field gun preserved at the Imperial War Museum. In August 1915 the 36th (Ulster) Division was being readied for service. Its infantry were largely drawn from the Ulster Volunteers and had already received weapons training before the war; the artillery however were newly raised Londoners, and the drivers were still being taught to mount and dismount from wooden horses. The 1st London Divisional Artillery were therefore attached to the Ulster Division until its own gunners were ready for active service. The London field brigades were re-equipped with 18-pounder guns and accompanied the Ulster Division to France, 1/I City of London Bde landing at Le Havre on 4 October 1915. It was in the Line by the middle of the month.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 61‚Äì9.Royal Field Artillery at Long, Long Trail36th (Ulster) Division at Long, Long Trail In December, the Ulster Division's artillery arrived from England, and the London Divisional Artillery was transferred to the 38th (Welsh) Division, which had also arrived in France minus its own artillery. 1/II London Bde served with the Welsh Division from 11 December 1915 to 1 January 1916. It was next attached to IV Corps Artillery until the end of February. By now, 1st London Division (now numbered 56th (London) Division) was being reformed in France and its divisional artillery was finally able to rejoin.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 61‚Äì9, 81‚Äì9. Preserved 4.5-inch howitzer In April 1916 a Regular battery (109th Battery, from XXIII Brigade Royal Field Artillery, which had been serving in 3rd Division), joined 1/II London Bde. In May, TF artillery brigades were numbered in sequence with the Royal Field Artillery: 1/II London became CCLXXXI Brigade (281 Brigade), and the batteries became A‚ÄìD. Shortly afterwards D (109th) Battery was exchanged with a battery (formerly 10th County of London Battery) from the divisional howitzer brigade, equipped with 4.5-inch howitzers. Brigade Ammunition Columns were also abolished at this time.Frederick, p. 690. =Gommecourt= The first major action for CCLXXXI (281) Bde came at the Battle of the Somme, and there are detailed accounts of its actions. 56th Division's task for the opening day of the Somme Offensive (the 'Big Push') was to attack the south side of the Gommecourt Salient as a diversion to support the main attack further south.Edmonds, pp. 252, 257, 308‚Äì11, 456‚Äì7.MacDonald, pp. 20‚Äì37, 59‚Äì66.Middlebrook, pp. 73‚Äì4.Ward, pp.19, 36. The divisional artillery was disposed in three groups. 281 Brigade under Lt-Col C.C. Macdowell, together with 109 Bty from 283 Bde, formed the Southern Group ('Macart'). During the preliminary bombardment Macart was under VII Corps control, but from Zero Hour it was assigned to support the assaulting infantry of 168th (2nd London) Brigade. The batteries began moving into position in late May 1916 and then began to register their targets during June, 281 Bde being the first to open fire.Edmonds, p. 460.MacDonald, pp. 207‚Äì11.Ward, pp. 32‚Äì4. The Macart Group's role was to 'search' the enemy trenches, villages, woods and hollows. B/281 Battery was in a fold of ground about 1500 yards west of the British-held village of H√©buterne, while C/281 and 109 Bty were beside the Sailly‚Äì H√©buterne road, about 500 yards from the latter village and just over 3000 yards from the German trenches. The howitzers of D (H)/281 Bty were dug into the gardens and orchards behind H√©buterne, and could range into the German rear areas.Edmonds, p. 299‚Äì300. Five days of intense bombardment were planned leading up to the attack, designated U,V, W, X and Y days, but the whole attack was delayed by two days, so there was seven days of bombardment culminating in Z Day on 1 July. The two additional days were used for Interdiction of enemy movement and repair parties, to complete the wire-cutting and counter-battery tasks, and to deceive the enemy. The wear on the guns and the unexpected ammunition expenditure meant that after the intended peak on Y Day (28 June) the Macart Group's firing actually fell away on the additional Y1 and Y2 Days, giving the defenders time to reorganise and repair their positions.Edmonds, p. 305.MacDonald, pp. 241, 51‚Äì2.Ward, p. 35. The division's batteries and observation posts (OPs) also suffered from German counter-battery fire. Lieutenant John Ball of 281 Bde was killed on 27 June when his OP was hit.MacDonald, pp. 225‚Äì30, 236. Each day of the firing programme had included an intense bombardment starting at 06.25, reaching a crescendo at 07.20 and lifting at 07.45; on Z Day (1 July) this lifted 15 minutes earlier than usual, in an attempt to deceive the enemy. 56th Divisional artillery was allocated 11,600 rounds for this final 65 minutes, amounting to three rounds per minute for each 18-pounder gun and 4.5-inch howitzer. A smoke screen was laid at 07.25, and under its cover the infantry went 'over the top' and assembled in No man's land. Then at Zero Hour, 07.30, the guns lifted to pre-arranged targets in the German support and reserve lines while the infantry began their assault.Edmonds, pp. 315, 463.MacDonald, pp. 258‚Äì62.Middlebrook, pp. 115‚Äì8, 122. Having reverted to divisional control at Zero Hour, the 18-pounders had a series of very short lifts, almost amounting to a creeping barrage. The first lift was onto the German reserve trench, on which they fired for four minutes, then they fired for six minutes just beyond it, and then swept the communication trenches for 12 minutes. Next they shifted to the infantry's second objective for eight minutes. This programme was intended to conform to the infantry's plan of attack.Edmonds, p. 461. At first this went well for 56th Division. Despite casualties from the German counter-bombardment on their jumping-off trenches, the smoke and morning mist helped the infantry, and they reached the German front line with little loss and moved on towards the second and reserve lines. The artillery OPs reported the signboards erected by the leading waves to mark their progress. On 168 Bde's front, the London Rifle Brigade found the wire well cut, except at Point 94 where the shelling had piled it into mounds that still presented an obstacle, and the battalion reached Gommecourt Park and began to consolidate. But the Queen Victoria's Rifles struggled to get through narrow gaps in uncut wire and met fierce resistance at the Cemetery, so that the following battalion, the Queen's Westminsters, got mixed up with them while trying to push through to the second objective, the Quadrilateral. The Germans began counter-attacking about an hour after Zero, and their heavy barrage on No man's land and their own front trenches made it almost impossible for reinforcements and supplies to be got forward to the assaulting battalions, who were now cut off. On the other side of the Gommecourt Salient, the assault of the 46th (North Midland) Division was a disaster, bogged down in mud and uncut wire, and the defenders could turn all their attention to the 56th Division.Edmonds, pp. 462‚Äì4, 471.MacDonald, pp. 264‚Äì7, 282-302, 310-21, 324-32, 336‚Äì9, 348‚Äì51.Middlebrook, pp. 148, 170‚Äì73, 185.Ward, pp. 36‚Äì44. Although VII Corps' heavy guns and 56th Division's howitzers tried to suppress the German artillery, the situation was too confused for the OPs and spotter aircraft to allow the divisional artillery to provide close support for the infantry. Several of the field guns were also out of action with broken spring. Even when repaired, the guns had to conserve ammunition later in the day.MacDonald, pp. 345, 359, 377‚Äì8. By 12.30 the counter-attacks were beginning to drive 168th Bde out of its gains and at about 13.00 the isolated battalions in the German lines began to crumble. At 13.30 men were leaving the German positions and returning to the British lines, while the reserve units trying to cross No man's land were virtually destroyed by the German barrage. By mid-afternoon 168th Bde held only a 400-yard stretch of the German front line trench and was cut off. The field batteries were ordered to conserve ammunition in case of a German attack. All remaining gains had to be abandoned after dark.Edmonds, pp. 472‚Äì3.MacDonald, pp. 355‚Äì8, 361‚Äì71, 373‚Äì6, 385, 392‚Äì405.Middlebrook, pp. 214‚Äì5.Ward, pp. 41‚Äì4. =Somme= The attack at Gommecourt had only been a diversion, so it was not continued after the first day., and 56th Division remained in position, holding its original line. On 13 July the divisional artillery made a demonstration to help the continuing Somme Offensive, and on 17 July all the brigades made raids in the enemy line, but otherwise the period was quiet. On 20 August it was relieved and moved south to rejoin the Somme Offensive and took part in the following actionsWard, pp. 46‚Äì8. * Battle of Ginchy, 9 September * Battle of Flers-Courcelette, 15‚Äì22 September * Battle of Morval, 25‚Äì27 September * Capture of Combles, 26 September * Battle of the Transloy Ridges, 1‚Äì9 October =Reorganisation= In the winter of 1916‚Äì17, TF field artillery batteries were reorganised from a four-gun to a six-gun establishment, so C Battery was split between A and B Batteries, and to make up the numbers 109th Battery rejoined together with a howitzer section from other London Field Brigades which were broken up. For the remainder of the war, therefore, CCLXXXI Brigade had the following organisation: * 109th Battery * A Battery * B Battery * D (Howitzer) Battery CCLXXXI Bde supported 56th Division in the following actions: =1917= * German Retreat to the Hindenburg Line, 14 March‚Äì5 April * Battles of Arras ** First Battle of the Scarpe, 9‚Äì14 April ** Third Battle of the Scarpe, 3‚Äì4 May * Third Battle of Ypres ** Battle of Langemarck, 16‚Äì17 August * Battle of Cambrai ** Capture of Tadpole Copse, 21 November ** Capture of Bourlon Wood, 23‚Äì28 November ** German Counter-attacks, 30 November‚Äì2 December =1918= * First Battles of the Somme ** First Battle of Arras, 28 March * Second Battle of the Somme ** Battle of Albert, 23 August * Second Battles of Arras ** Battle of the Scarpe, 26‚Äì30 August * Battles of the Hindenburg Line ** Battle of the Canal du Nord, 27 September‚Äì1 October ** Second Battle of Cambrai, 8‚Äì9 October ** Pursuit to the Selle, 9‚Äì12 October * Final Advance in Picardy ** Battle of the Sambre, 4 November ** Passage of the Grande Honnelle, 5‚Äì7 November Throughout this period, even when the infantry of the division were resting, the divisional artillery were frequently left in the Line supporting other formations. 56th Division was relieved and drawn back into support by midnight on 10 November 1918, but its artillery remained in action until 'Cease Fire' sounded at 11.00 on 11 November when the Armistice with Germany came into force. 2/II London Brigade After the First Line divisional artillery left for France, 2/II London Bde joined 58th Division on 27 September at Saxmundham with the following composition: 2/II London Brigade RFA * 2/4th London Battery * 2/5th London Battery * 2/6th London Battery * 2/II London Brigade Ammunition Column The division remained in East Anglia, digging trenches, manning coastal defences. and training, until July 1916, when it moved to Salisbury Plain for final training. By then the artillery had received their 18-pounders and 4.5-inch howitzers. As with the other TF artillery, the brigade was assigned a number and 2/II London became CCXCI Brigade (291 Brigade). The batteries were redesignated A‚ÄìC, a howitzer battery was added and became D Battery, and the brigade ammunition columns were abolished. The division began embarking for France on 20 January 1917 and by early February it was on the Western Front, where it remained for the rest of the war. CCXCI Bde supported 58th Division in the following actions: =1917= * German Retreat to the Hindenburg Line, 17‚Äì28 March * Battle of Bullecourt, 4‚Äì17 May * Actions on the Hindenburg Line, 20 May‚Äì16 June * Third Battle of Ypres ** Battle of the Menin Road Ridge, 20‚Äì25 September ** Battle of Polygon Wood, 26‚Äì27 September ** Second Battle of Passchendaele, 26 October‚Äì10 November =1918= * First Battles of the Somme ** Battle of St Quentin, 21 March‚Äì3 April ** Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, 24‚Äì25 April * Battle of Amiens 8‚Äì11 August * Second Battle of the Somme ** Battle of Albert, 22‚Äì23 August ** Second Battle of Bapaume, 31 August‚Äì1 September * Battles of the Hindenburg Line ** Battle of √âpehy, 18 September * Final Advance in Artois and Flanders, 2 October‚Äì11 November. After the Armistice came into force, skilled men began to return home. Full demobilisation got under way in March 1919 and the artillery left for England on 4 April. Postwar When the Territorial Army was reformed in 1920, the II Londons became 360 (4th City of London) Battery in the 1st (City of London) Brigade alongside which they had fought throughout the war. The battery was based with the rest of the brigade in Bloomsbury, and the link with Woolwich ended. Just before World War II, 360 Battery was split off to form a duplicate unit (138th Field Regiment), which fought in Tunisia and Italy. Memorials The London Troops Memorial.

Martens became known for his provocations, including Episode III: Enjoy Poverty (2008), a documentary that suggests that the Congo market their poverty as a natural resource. In 2010 Renzo Martens initiated the Institute for Human Activities (IHA) that postulates a gentrification program on a palm oil plantation in the Congolese rainforest. Biography Renzo Martens (1973, Terneuzen) studied Political Science at the University of Nijmegen and art at the Royal Academy of Ghent and the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam. In 2010 Martens got approved as an artist-in-residence at the ISCP program in New York.ISCP In 2013 the artist attended the Yale World Fellow Program, the leadership program of Yale University.Yale World Fellow Program Martens is currently working on a PhD in the arts at the School of Arts in Ghent.KASK Martens gave lectures on art, economy and representation at: University College London, London School of Economics, Yale University, Goldsmiths (University of London), St√§delschule Frankfurt, HEAD Gen√®ve, KASK and Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid. Work=Episode I In Chechnya's war zones Renzo Martens is in search of himself . With the camera self-centered, he questions the Chechens on what they think of him. Episode I is an atypical documentary in which footage of a war zone is mixed with a personal (love) story of the artist . Episode III: Enjoy Poverty This film opened the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) in 2009. Episode III: Enjoy Poverty articulates a comment on political claims of contemporary art by referring to its own strategy. The film was shown in art events and venues such as the Centre Pompidou, The Berlin Biennial, Manifesta 7, The Moscow Biennial, Tate Modern, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, 19th Biennale of Sydney and several prestigious film festivals. Azu Nwagbogu (curator Zeitz MOCAA) called the film \\"The Guernica of our age.\\" Institute for Human Activities Martens initiated The Institute for Human Activities (IHA) in 2010 and is commissioned as the artistic director of the institute. IHA's goal is to prove that artistic critique on economic inequality can redress it ‚Äì not symbolically, but in material terms.IHA The IHA attempt to improve the lives of people around the art center by effectuating a gentrification program. Since 2014, it works in close collaboration with the Cercle d‚ÄôArt des Travailleurs de Plantation Congolaise (CATPC), a cooperative of plantation workers that develops new ecological initiatives based on the production of art. = Opening Seminar = In 2012 IHA organised an Opening Seminar on a palm oil plantation in Boteka, DR Congo. Congolese and international speakers gathered at the plantation to discuss the history of the plantation, gentrification, and the possibilities for art to deal meaningfully with the conditions of its own existence. For two days, two-hundred people from the local community participated in a conference with art historian TJ Demos, philosopher Marcus Steinweg, activist Ren√© Ngongo, architect Eyal Weizman, economist J√©rome Mumbanza, curator Nina M√∂ntmann, anthropologist Katrien Pype, and artist Emmanuel Botalatala. Urban theorist Richard Florida delivered the keynote lecture via satellite. = Exhibitions = IHA has facilitated the global dissemination of works of CATPC in the art world, which resulted in exhibitions in places such as the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, Artes Mundi in Cardiff, and Kunst-Werke in Berlin. In January 2017, the cooperative opened its US debut at the SculptureCenter in New York. After earlier reviews in Artforum and The New York Times by amongst others Claire Bishop, Princeton professor Chika Okeke-Agulula heated the debate by questioning if this was \\"The latest frontier in the Western art world‚Äôs self-congratulatory and all-too-sporadic missionary work?\\" The final verdict was made by The New York Times, compiling the show as 'The Best Art of 2017' = The Matter of Critique = The IHA started the international conference series titled The Matter of Critique to address the material conditions of critical artistic engagement. Through these conferences, the IHA brings together academics, artists, and economists, as well as the Congolese plantations workers to discuss the artistic, social, and economic scope of the IHA's activities in Congo. The IHA initiated its first international conference in 2015 in KW Institute for Contemporary Art and in Lusanga. The third edition of The Matter of Critique took place in 2016‚Äîagain in Lusanga. The fourth edition took place in SculptureCenter, New York on January 29, 2017, with notably Ariella Azoulay, Simon Gikandi, David Joselit, Michael Taussig and CATPC artist Matthieu Kasiama. = The Repatriation of the White Cube = On April 21, 2017, IHA and CATPC opened a White Cube on the site of Unilever's first ever palm oil plantation, in Lusanga (formerly Leverville) in the Conglese interior. Designed by OMA, this White Cube is the cornerstone of the Lusanga International Research Centre for Art and Economic Inequality (LIRCAEI). During the opening, plantation workers held discussions on the benefits of a White Cube for a plantation with philosopher Suhail Malik, curator Cl√©mentine Deliss, curator Azu Nwagbogu, the president of CATPC Ren√© Ngongo, and the Indonesian plantation workers union Serbundo. In a discussion broadcast by ZDF with the artists Monica Bonvicini, Hans Haacke, and Renzo Martens, curator at large of dokumenta 14 Bonaventure Ndikung commented on this project that \\"Afrika does not need a White Cube\\". =Inaugural exhibition \\"The Repatriation of the White Cube\\" = CATPC has curated the inaugural exhibition of the White Cube in a network of Kisendus ‚Äì traditional huts, especially built for the show, dedicated to arts and social events ‚Äì linked to the White Cube. Different pieces referred to the D.R. Congo's rich history but had until then never been exhibited in the Congo. Participating artists included: Kader Attia, Sammy Baloji, Vitshois Mwilambwe Bondo, Marlene Dumas, Michel Ekeba, El√©onore Hellio, Carsten H√∂ller, Ir√®ne Kanga, Matthieu Kasiama, Jean Katambayi, Jean Kawata, Mbuku Kimpala, Thomas Leba, J√©r√©mie Mabiala, Daniel Manenga, Mega Mingiedi, Em√©ry Mohamba, C√©drick Tamasala, Pathy Thsindele and Luc Tuymans. = Post-Plantation = The opening of the museum marked the end of its first research programme on gentrification, to start a new research programme on the creation of the \\"post-plantation\\". Together with Commonland, it currently aims to create a new ecological and economic model based on art.

He served as an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Joliet in Illinois from 1968-1991. Early life and education Born in Cicero, Illinois, Raymond Vonesh was educated at St. Leonard School, St. Philip High School in Chicago, Quigley Preparatory Seminary, and St. Mary of the Lake Seminary. He was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Chicago by Archbishop Samuel Stritch on May 3, 1941. Priesthood After ordination, Vonesh served at Sacred Heart Church in Chicago until 1946 when he was assigned to Holy Name Cathedral. He studied canon law at the Gregorian University in Rome from 1947 to 1949. Vonesh became the notary and judge for the Archdiocesan Tribunal upon his return to Chicago. He was assigned as the procurator at St. Mary of the Lake Seminary in 1956. Bishop Romeo Blanchette of the Joliet diocese requested of Archbishop John Cody of Chicago a priest experienced in canon law to assist him at the Joliet chancery. Vonesh was sent to the Joliet diocese in 1967 and named vicar general. Auxiliary Bishop of Joliet On January 5, 1968 Pope Paul VI appointed Vonesh as the Titular Bishop of Vanariona and Auxiliary Bishop of Joliet in Illinois. He was consecrated by John Cardinal Cody of Chicago on April 3, 1968. The principal co-consecrators were Bishops Romeo Blanchette of Joliet and Cletus F. O'Donnell of Madison. He continued to serve as an auxiliary bishop until his resignation was accepted by Pope John Paul II on May 7, 1991. During those years he served as pastor of St. Patrick\`s Parish in Joliet and vicar for Hispanics and vicar for permanent deacons. He later moved to Holy Cross rectory in Joliet and then became temporary administrator of St. Walter\`s Parish in Roselle from 1981-1982. He became chaplain for the Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Heart in Mokena in June 1988. Vonesh died at the age of 75 on August 16, 1991.

The 207,000 m2 site has been redeveloped with a mixture of offices, housing and retail after DR inaugurated their new headquarters, DR Byen in 2007. History The Radio House (Radiohuset) in Frederiksberg was completed as a new home for DR in 1945. The building was designed by Vilhelm Lauritzen. In the 1950s, with the increasing role of the television media, the building became too small. A design competition for a new headquarters in Gladsaxe, northwest of Copenhagen, was won by Vilhelm Lauritzen's studio. Their winning proposal was designed by Mogens Boertmann. The first phase of the project was inaugurated by Frederik IX in 1966. The second phase, which included the 14-story office tower, was inaugurated in 1970. The last phase, which included the News Building, was completed a few years later. The TV-Byen was home to DR's administration, television and film studios, costume department, workshops and with space for other activities. Most of DR's radio broadcasting as well as the DR Concert Hall remained in the Radio Building. DR's television evening news programme, TV Avisen, was also broadcast from the Radio House until 7 October 1983. In 2006 and 2007, DR left TV-Byen, concentrating their activities in their new headquarters, DR Byen, in √òrestad, Copenhagen. The Doors performed a live version of \\"When the Music's Over\\" on September 18, 1968. This version is also present in the film, When You're Strange and its soundtrack. Redevelopment In 2000, the real estate developers Sj√¶ls√∏ Gruppen and Ejendomsselskabet St. Frederikslund purchased TV-Byen and Radiohuset from DR for DKK 780 million. The site in Gladsaxe covered an area of 207,000 m2 and comprised 30 buildings with a floor area of 100,000 m2. The local plan for TV-Byen was adopted in 2005. In 2009, Ernst & Young moved into the office tower.

Established in 1940 as WOCB, its format consists of Portuguese language programming. WBAS also operates FM translator station W268CP on 106.5 MHz. History WOCB first signed on October 2, 1940; the station was originally owned by the Cape Cod Broadcasting Company. It was the first radio station on Cape Cod since WJBX, which operated for several months in 1926. WOCB originally operated at 1210 kHz, but moved to 1240 in 1941 as a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement. WOCB shut down in May 1943 after running out of money, resulting in its license being canceled by the FCC on November 30. E. Anthony and Sons, owner of WNBH in New Bedford and publisher of the New Bedford Standard-Times and the Cape Cod Standard-Times, bought the station's equipment and relaunched WOCB under a new license on May 6, 1944 as an affiliate of the Blue Network, broadcasting mostly network programming (soap operas, radio drama, newscasts, etc.) with some local programming, remaining affiliated with that network after it became ABC. When ABC broke into four sub-networks in 1968, WOCB affiliated with ABC's American Entertainment Network. Its FM signal, for years a simulcast of its AM signal, signed on May 2, 1948 on 94.3 MHz, and in 1962, moved to 94.9 MHz. (The 94.3 frequency is now used on Cape Cod by WZAI, the Brewster repeater for WCAI.) By the 1970s, WOCB-FM broke away from simulcasting the AM during midday and evening hours to broadcast easy- listening music while still simulcasting the AM's format (then adult contemporary, with a heavy news commitment) during weekday drive times and hourly newscasts the rest of the broadcast day. In the summer through winter of 1981, the afternoon drive announcer on WOCB was Edd Hall, who subsequently did voice work for Late Night with David Letterman from 1982‚Äì1990 and was the announcer on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno from 1992‚Äì2004. In 1991, Hurricane Bob blew down WOCB's transmitter tower, and the damage suffered was so severe that the owners could not afford to rebuild. The station was then sold to Ernie Boch, Sr., an automobile dealer in the Boston suburb of Norwood, Massachusetts, who turned WOCB-FM into the flagship station for his new Boch Broadcasting company, WXTK. Concurrently, WOCB became WUOK, and under that callsign programmed CNN Headline News, sports radio, and finally a WXTK simulcast. By 1997, Boch Broadcasting, which by this point owned four FM radio stations, no longer needed WUOK and donated it to Boston University for use as a relay of WBUR-FM in Boston, under the call letters WBUR; the simulcast began March 3, 1997. The university's 2013 acquisition of WBUA (92.7 FM) in Tisbury (on Martha's Vineyard) to serve as a WBUR-FM satellite rendered the 1240 AM facility redundant; on August 5, 2013, BU announced that it would be sold to Alex Langer, with plans to program it with Portuguese-language programming similar to that of another Langer station, WSRO. The call letters were changed to WBAS on February 1, 2014, two days after BU and Langer agreed to a time brokerage agreement. Translator In February 2020, W268CP changed its frequency to 106.5 in order for WKFY in East Harwich to change its frequency to 101.5 and move its transmitter to Orleans.

The conference is free of charge and has hosted over 700 presenters, taking place in two countries over the past seven years. Since the first Open Engagement conference in 2007, the event has become a locus for people interested in socially engaged art. The conference offers a primary site where practitioners convene annually to take stock of the field, playing host to artists and activists. History=2007 The initial conference, born out of Delos Reyes' graduate studies at the University of Regina, was hosted by the University, the Dunlop Art Gallery, The Mackenzie Art Gallery and local Regina residents from October 11‚Äì13, 2007. Each of the three days focused on a unique theme of exploration; October 11, You are all that I see: Art and everyday experience; October 12, It takes two: Collaborations, collectives, other team relationships; October 13.

Featured keynote presenters were Mark Dion, Nils Norman, and Amy Franceschini. 2011 Open Engagement 2011 explored broadly art and social practice.

While driving to their next carnival performance, they are side tracked by picking up stranded Mr. Gardner (John Hamilton) and his daughter Joan Gardner (Jayne Hazard) whom Dave seems quite smitten with. Joan's father is convinced that someone is trying to kill him and the actions of his suspicious secretary, Mr. Williams (Tay Dunn) seem to confirm this. Gardner insists that the carnival trio take him and his entourage to one of his residences that is close by, though his daughter is upset by the idea. The Gardner's chauffeur (Max Rosenbloom) is left to stay with their broken down car. When they arrive at the Gardner estate, they are met by a mysterious and strange house servant Mrs. Benson (Minerva Urical) and an Electrician (Dan White) who is roaming about the house. Billy and Shemp are terrorized by ghostly voices, transforming pictures and figures dressed in sheets. Maxie finally arrives at the estate shortly after a suspicious character named Mr. Grogan (Tim Ryan) does. As things get stranger, Maxie teams up with Gilbert and Howard, Shemp dons the gorilla outfit and Barny the real gorilla gets free from his mobile cage trailer. Soon after a body is discovered and it is clearly a case of murder. The film is 63 minutes with the story wrapping up in the final two minutes.

Borten is best known for his Oscar- nominated script for the 2013 film Dallas Buyers Club. In addition to his nomination for Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, Borten also received a nomination for Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay. Biography Borten grew up in Pennsylvania, where he attended Plymouth Whitemarsh High School, then attended Syracuse University in New York and subsequently moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in filmmaking. After hearing about Ron Woodroof, the original founder of the \\"Dallas Buyers Club\\" for the distribution of unapproved HIV medications, in the early 1990s, and interviewing Woodroof in 1992, Borten decided to write a screenplay about Woodroof and his buyers club. He successfully sold the script‚Äîtitled Dallas Buyers Club‚Äîin 1996 with Woody Harrelson attached to play Ron and Dennis Hopper Directing, but shortly afterwards the production company that had bought it dissolved. In 2001, he rewrote the script with Melisa Wallack and they sold it to Universal Studios, with Marc Forster to direct the film and Brad Pitt to star. Again, the production fell through, which Borten described as \\"a death blow\\". In 2009, however, Borten and Wallack were able to reclaim their rights to the script and producer Robbie Brenner was able to cast Matthew McConaughey and secure funding for the film's production. The film was released in 2013, more than two decades after Borten met Woodroof, and more than 15 years after selling his first version of the script. Dallas Buyers Club received numerous accolades, including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. Borten's screenwriting credits since 2013 include other biopics such as the survival-drama The 33 and the Neflix film Sergio. His upcoming projects include The War and Treaty with John Legend and Gilbert Films, and Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, a biopic about the life of John D.

His acclaimed film 20 Feet from Stardom won him the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2014 as well as a Grammy Award for Best Music Film. His documentary Best of Enemies, on the debates between Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley, was shortlisted for the 2016 Academy Award and won an Emmy Award. His 2018 film Won't You Be My Neighbor?, a documentary about Fred Rogers, received critical acclaim and became the highest-grossing biographical documentary of all time. Neville has been nominated for five additional Grammys for films including Respect Yourself: The Stax Records Story, Muddy Waters: Can‚Äôt Be Satisfied, Johnny Cash‚Äôs America, and The Music of Strangers: Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble. Neville‚Äôs other films include The Cool School, Shotgun Freeway, Keith Richards: Under the Influence, and, as producer, Miss Americana, Beauty Is Embarrassing and Crossfire Hurricane. For television, Neville directed and executive produced the series Ugly Delicious, Abstract: The Art of Design, Chelsea Does and Shangri-La.  Biography and career  Neville was born in Los Angeles, California, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and originally worked as a journalist in New York City and San Francisco before moving into film production in 1993. He founded Tremolo Productions in 1999 and continues to run it today. Neville's films focus on culture, and especially on music. Speaking about his 2016 film The Music of Strangers, Neville said \\"The best thing about it for me as a filmmaker ... is that not only do I get to indulge my musical love, but that music is, to me, the most amazing Trojan horse to tell any other kind of story. The best music films are not about music ... Music is just the language we're speaking to tell a story about culture.\\" Since finding success with his music-related documentaries, Neville has focused on other aspects of culture, such as politics and media. In a 2014 blog post on the International Documentary Association's website, Neville wrote that he is drawn to \\"how a smaller story can be a perfect window into conflicts within the human condition.\\" His 2015 film Best of Enemies examines the televised debates between Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley and serves as a timely investigation into politics and media. His film Won't You Be My Neighbor, about legendary television host Fred Rogers, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival to rave reviews, and focuses on the power that kindness and understanding can have in a community, whether real or imagined.  Personal life  Neville lives in Pasadena, California with his wife and two children.  Filmography (as director) = Feature-length films  * Shotgun Freeway: Drives Through Lost L.A.

Coming to Rockford, Illinois to practice carpentry, Early rose to become an agent for the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company. A staunch abolitionist, Early was an early supporter of the Republican Party and was voted to the Illinois Senate on the ticket four times. During one of these terms, he was elected President of the Illinois Senate, thus acting Lieutenant Governor of Illinois. Early died before his fourth term was completed. Biography John Early was born in Essex County, Ontario on March 17, 1828. He attended public schools and helped his family on the farm. When he was eighteen, he came with his family to Caledonia, Illinois, United States. In 1852, he moved to Rockford to work as a carpenter. He became a noted architectural draftsman and the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company hired him as a general agent. Early became active in politics, led by his abolitionist views, supporting the Free Soil Party. He joined the Republican Party when it formed a few years later. Early was elected assessor of the City of Rockford three times. In 1869, Illinois Governor John M. Palmer appointed early one of the original trustees of the Reform School at Pontiac, a position he held for one year. In 1870, he was elected to the Illinois Senate for a two-year term. He was re-elected in the next three elections. Shortly after his election as governor in 1873, Richard J. Oglesby was appointed to the United States Senate, making Lieutenant Governor of Illinois John Lourie Beveridge the acting governor. Early was elected to replace Beveridge as acting lieutenant governor (thus President of the Illinois Senate), holding the position from January 23, 1873 to January 8, 1875. Early died from complications of tuberculosis on September 2, 1877 before his fourth Senate term ended. He was buried in Cedar Bluff Cemetery in Rockford.

He didn't stay at the Academy very long, preferring to teach himself draftsmanship and painting. He first became known through the illustrations he drew for the Fliegende Bl√§tter, a weekly satirical magazine. In 1871, he illustrated Schiller's History of the Thirty-Years War. He later turned to animal, landscape and genre painting. Earlier that same year, with the support of Wilhelm von Kaulbach, Diez became a teacher at the Academy and was soon elevated to Professor.

Darrenlas primary school was built in 1907 and is located in Kingcraft Street, the school is a feeder to Mountain Ash Comprehensive School. There was another primary school in the area known as Cynon Infants but it has now closed. The local public house in the area is the Napiers arms, named after General Charles James Napier. The pub is shaped like a coffin and the reason is believed that it was once owned by an undertaker. It is also believed that the street behind the pub is called Dover Street because a number of people came to the area in the 1800s from Dover to build the streets. There are also other streets that are named after the Bruce family which is the family of Lord Aberdare such as Eva Street, Knight Street, Pamela Street, Pryce Street and Clarence Street.  Facilities  There are two parks in the area - Gwernifor Park which is based near the Bryn Ifor estate and Victoria Park which is based in the forestry on the eastern side of the village. The village has 2 shops, both newsagents. The main shopping area located in the town is just a short walk away. There is also a community centre in the old Cynon Infants School building. There is also a rugby field in Darrenlas - The recreation ground which was home to Mountain Ash RFC for many years but is now used by the community for a range of other purposes.

Humanitarian Pursuits  In 2011, Ishaq co-founded the #SupportYemen Media Collective, an organizing and strategizing effort to advance social justice, build a democratic civic state, promote non-violence and break the silence on human rights violations in Yemen. At the headquarters in 2015, Ishaq co-devised and taught a two-week documentary-making film course called \\"Comra\\". Comra was targeted at young Yemini aspiring filmmakers. Adjacently, there was a 4-day Arts & Crafts workshop called 'Out of the Rubble' for children that had survived airstrikes.

Chemical Aesthetics, UK Royal Society of Chemistry, 2005Weintraub, Linda. In the Making: Creative Options for Artists, New York, NY DAP Press 2003 Laramee believes that, \\"by sharing innovations, art-and-science collaborations can energize action to initiate positive social change and promote awareness of environmental and health issues by directly involving communities, extending ways in which cultures imagine, create and understand.\\" Hannah, Dehlia. \\"Performative Experiments: Aesthetic Interventions in the Philosophy of Science\\" PhD Dissertation, Columbia University, 2012Polli, Andrea.

Six minute video (detail from installation, \\"Invisible Fire\\")Uranium Decay (2012), draws attention to the dark, inverse form of alchemy of the Atomic Age. Responding to the ongoing Fukushima meltdowns the video illuminates the 4.47 billion-year half-life decay cycle of uranium-238 superimposed onto thermographs and news footage. As uranium decays over geological time, it transmutes into ‚Äúuranium daughters‚Äù that cascade into other elements and finally to stable Lead-206. As we are learning post-Fukushima, when climate change occurs and vulnerability spectrums shift, nuclear sites and the life forms surrounding them are at increased risk. In her recent creative work, Laramee speculates on how human beings use and misuse the natural environment.Lippard, Lucy R. Weather Report: art and Climate Change, Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art 2007 Artworks that investigate the environmental and health impacts of atomic legacy sites track the invisible radioactive contamination, residues of the nuclear weapons complex and the nuclear energy industry. This multifaceted work cites uranium mining, milling, plutonium production that have resulted in the contamination of surface water, well water and deep aquifer water, soil and air pollution, social injustice, and the consequences upon forms of life. Her work on atomic legacy issues has been featured in the International Uranium Film Festival. Other forms of environmental degradation that she addresses are desertification, climate change, and dredging. The aspects of the history of science that she explores include alchemy, subjectivity in scientific research, such legendary figures as Charles Darwin and Johannes Kepler. The environmental/ecological issues that appear in her work include commodification of nature, the political and cultural history of the national parks in the US, and the correlation between human blood and ocean water. Social conditions that she addresses include the impact of radioactive waste and weapons testing upon indigenous peoples in the American West. Laramee's social-sculpture interventions activate community participation in environmental remediation efforts, encourage responsible behaviors, and invoke political critiques. She is currently the executive director of ART/MEDIA for a Nuclear Free Future, an offshoot from ART/MEDIA, a social sculpture founded in 1984 that supported public art works presented in the mass media and created by such invited artists as Jenny Holzer, Hans Haacke, Rachel Rosenthal, Terry Allen, and others. Their projects included artist-designed billboards, television, radio and print interventions, museum exhibitions, lectures, and performance art Durland, Steven (1986). \\"'Subersive Acts: ART/MEDIA\\" for example, introduced a radical alternative to media conventions by disseminating political, environmental, and social activist art works to people who were not members of the traditional art audience. Apparatus for the Distillation of Vague Intuitions, installation by Eve Andree Laramee, as exhibited at MASSMoCA, North Adams, MA Major works=Apparatus for the Distillation of Vague Intuitions Influenced by alchemy, this installation of hand blown glass vessels engraved with text refers to subjectivity, intuition, and guesswork in scientific inquiry. The art historian Ann Morris Reynolds describes this work as an \\"apparatus\\": a means by which a \\"distillation of vague intuitions\\" concerning art and science is performed. And true to the second meaning of the term, a political organization or an under ground political movement, Apparatus counters the business-as-usual experience of both. Science and art interrogate each other and the results are marvelous... and rare. Halfway to Invisible An installation comprising videos, kinetic sculpture, photography, and an archive of government documents, Halfway to the Invisible exposes the environmental legacy of uranium mining in the American Southwest. Between 1949 and 1980, these mines produced more than 225,000,000 tons of uranium ore. Epidemiological studies provide evidence of the effects upon the health of the predominantly Native American laborers and their families. Slouching Towards Yucca Mountain This photo and video installation is a post-atomic science fiction Western featuring twelve time travelers exploring the desert locations of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, the Nevada Test Site (NNSS), and Death Valley National Park. Luminous Darwin: The Lost Notebooks of Charles Darwin This installation of magic lantern styled video sculptures, faux historic devices, and didactic text referencing Darwin's late work on metaphysics. Laramee created three fictional notebooks she attributed to Darwin corresponding to the animal, vegetable, and mineral realms: \\"Notebook X: The Awareness of the Cells\\", \\"Notebook Y: The Dreams of the Plants\\", and \\"Notebook Z: The Memories of the Stones\\". This deviation from conventional scientific/historic exhibitions was installed within an actual historic exhibition, \\"Dialogues with Darwin\\" at the Museum of The American Philosophical Society, a repository for original Darwin materials. SugarMud This installation, installed in the drawing room of a Gilded Age mansion consisted of a room-sized mound of golden-colored sugar that referenced two local issues. One was the golden hue associated with the historic Hudson River School of painters and the accumulated toxic sediment from the sugar factory sludge located on the shore of the Hudson River. Collaborating with environmental scientists, Laramee created Sediment Profile Imagery using benthic disturbance mapping of the river bottom documenting the channels where 80,000 tons of sludge were dredged and relocated to the ocean floor. Exhibitions Laramee's art has been exhibited throughout the United States, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. She has participated in exhibitions at the Venice Biennale, Mass MOCA, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York; the High Museum of Art, Atlanta; the Contemporary Arts Museum, Houston; among other institutions. Collections 100 Years 100 Stones, public artwork by Eve Andree Laramee in the courtyard of SDSU Laramee's work is included in the collections of the MacArthur Foundation, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, The Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the UCLA Armand Hammer Museum, and other public and private collections. Her public art sculpture, 100 Years 100 Stones commemorates the centennial year of San Diego State University. Grants and fellowships Laramee has received two grants from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, an Andy Warhol Foundation Grant, two fellowships from the New York Foundation for Arts and grants from the Mid- Atlantic States Arts Foundation, National Endowment for the Arts, and the Guggenheim Museum Sculptor-in-Residence Program.

These proposals range from giving Aboriginal governments powers similar to that of local governments in Canada to demands that Indigenous governments be recognized as sovereign, and capable of \\"nation-to-nation\\" negotiations as legal equals to the Crown (i.e. the Canadian state), as well as many other variations.  Background  Aboriginal peoples in Canada are defined in the Constitution Act, 1982 as Indians, Inuit and M√©tis. Prior to the acquisition of the land by European empires or the Canadian state after 1867, First Nations (Indian), Inuit, and M√©tis peoples had a wide variety of polities within their countries, from band societies, to tribal chiefdoms, multinational confederacies, to representative democracies (in the case of the M√©tis-led Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia). These were ignored or suppressed by the Government of Canada (federal government).Wherrett, Section A For the M√©tis and Inuit, self-government was replaced by integration into the Canadian polity: these people could vote in the standard municipal, provincial, and federal elections as citizens of Canada. For the First Nations, the Government of Canada created the band system under the Indian Act, which allowed First Nations people to vote in band elections but they could not vote in federal elections before 1960 unless they renounced their status as Registered Indians (a process referred to as enfranchisement). Band governments had very little authority, however; they exercised only whatever power was delegated to them by the Minister of Indian Affairs, and only had authority on the Indian reserves which represented a tiny proportion of their traditional territories.Wherrett, Section B  Rationale  Indigenous people may claim an \\"inherent right to self-government\\" either because it is seen as a natural right emanating from prior occupation of the land or because of a gift or covenant with the Creator. In this case, Indigenous people do not seek to be \\"granted\\" self-government, but simply to have their pre-existing right recognized in law. As well an argument for self-government can be made on the basis of the right of self-determination as understood in international law generally or as specifically enumerated in the Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.Hurley Self-government has risen as a proposed solution to the constraints of the longstanding Indian Act. When a self-government treaty is implemented many of the restrictions of the Indian Act are lifted, allowing Indigenous communities different freedoms and forms of community-based control that were previously regulated. Treaty provisions may include control over education, healthcare institutions, administration, land development for revenue, and decision-making authority.  Evolution of government proposals  In 1969, the White Paper on Indian Policy proposed abolishing band governments and transferring the delivery of social programs on reserves to the provincial governments (as the provinces already run these services for non-Indigenous people). Opposition to this proposal helped to galvanize the creation of national political organizations among Aboriginal peoples, bringing the concept of Indigenous self-government to the national political consciousness for the first time. The constitutional amendments of 1982 included Section 35 of the Constitution Act which recognized Aboriginal rights and treaty rights but did not define these. In 1983, the Special Committee of the House of Commons on Indian Self-Government, released its report (also called the Penner Report after committee chair Keith Penner). It recommended that the federal government recognize First Nations as a distinct order of government within the Canadian federation and begin to negotiate self- government agreements with Indian bands. An attempt was made by Indigenous leaders to have the concept of Indigenous self-government enshrined via the 1987 Meech Lake package of constitutional amendments, but they failed to convince the first ministers to include such provisions This led to Aboriginal hostility to the agreement and saw Manitoban MLA Elija Harper, a Registered Cree Indian, help to defeat the accord. The follow-up Charlottetown Accord (1992) included recognition of an inherent Aboriginal right of self- government, but this package also failed though not because of Aboriginal resistance: in fact self-government was unpopular with many non-Aboriginal voters and may have been a factor in its defeat in the national referendum which followed. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples issued its final report in 1996, which recommended that Indigenous governments become recognized as the third order of government in Canada (alongside the federal government and the provinces) and that Indigenous peoples receive special representation in Parliament. After this time, however, the emphasis shifted away from constitutional entrenchment towards negotiations with individual communities. The Conservative government announced its Community-Based Self- Government (SBSG) policy in 1986, to \\"enable negotiation of new Crown - Aboriginal relationships outside of the Indian Act\\" on a community-by- community basis. In 1995 the Liberal government issued the Inherent Right of Self-Government Policy which recognized that self-government was an inherent right, but limited its implementation to a model which resembles delegation of authority from the Crown to the communities. It requires that individual bands or groups of bands sign modern treaties with the Government of Canada (and sometimes a provincial government) to be removed from the structures of the Indian Act.  Self-government agreements  , twenty-two comprehensive self- government agreements had been signed by the federal government. Of those, eighteen were part of a comprehensive land claim agreement or modern treaty. Those numbers included the Yale Final Agreement and the Sioux Valley Final Agreement which have been signed, but have not yet been brought into effect through legislation. In addition to the comprehensive agreements with Indian bands mentioned above, the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement of 1993 with the Inuit of the eastern Arctic, pursued a different model of governance. A new federal territory, Nunavut was created in 1999 where the Inuit were the majority, separate from the North West Territories where more First Nations, M√©tis, and non-Aboriginal people lived. Nunavut is not reserved exclusively for the Inuit, and any Canadian can move there and vote in its elections. However the strong Inuit majority is reflected in the governance of the territory and Inuktitut and Inuinnaq are two of the territory's official languages (alongside English and French). Another model is the Cree of northern Quebec. Since the passage of the Cree-Naskapi (of Quebec) Act in 1984, nine Cree communities are not subject to the Indian Act or the band system. Instead they are represented by the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee) or GCCEI and governed by the closely linked Cree Regional Authority. The GCCEI signed an agreement in 2012 with the province of Quebec that would abolish the municipalities in the region and merge them with the Cree Regional Authority in a new regional government called the Eeyou Istchee James Bay Territory. the GCCEI are in talks with the federal government on a Cree Nation Governance Agreement to refine the new structure's relationship to the federal authorities. The Anishinabek Education Agreement is another self-governance model. It occurred in 2017 and was the first case of an agreement regarding Indigenous self-governance over education in Ontario. As of 2017, it was also the largest number of First Nations included in an education self- governance agreement in Canada. The suggested purpose of this agreement was to further ‚Äúacademic excellence‚Äù and to push outside the bounds of the Indian Act by developing authority over their community's education. As of 2019, there have been twenty-five comprehensive self-government agreements signed by the federal government, involving forty-three Indigenous communities. There are a further 50 agreements being negotiated across Canada in 2019 as well.  Moves towards self-government  Some bands, rejecting the idea that they must negotiate with the Government of Canada in order to exercise their right to self-government, have acted unilaterally. In January 2014, the Nipissing First Nation adopted what is believed to be the first constitution for a First Nation in Ontario. It is supposed to replace the Indian Act as the supreme law which regulates the governance of the First Nation, but has not been tested in court.  Funding self-government  Funding for Indigenous self-governing communities is governed by a Financial Transfer Agreement. The agreement establishes a 5 year joint financial understanding between the Federal government, Provincial/Territorial government, and Indigenous government. These agreements are grounded in Canada‚Äôs collaborative self-government fiscal policy, which is said to try and promote a respectful, co-operative partnership with Indigenous governments and communities.  Laws and non- Indigenous rights on the land  Indigenous self-government treaties also establish which laws are under or shared between levels of governance (Federal, Provincial, or First Nations jurisdictions). A Government of Canada 2019 Indigenous Self-Government Report outlines, although specific laws may be split up differently depending on the Nation and the agreement, the ‚ÄúCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Human Rights Act and other general laws such as the Criminal Code continue to apply‚Äù. Since the Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to all peoples and governments in Canada, any person living on First Nations land, including non-Indigenous, can challenge First Nations Governance if they feel their rights are being infringed upon. The Federal Government has also taken steps to include non-Indigenous individuals who live on First Nations land in the decision making process. Treaties may include provisions to ensure non-members of the community have a voice by means of voting, candidacy, or appealing decisions. The rationale for this is that all individuals must be able to have an input over ‚Äúissues that affect them, such as service levels, taxation rates, and health‚Äù.

Life The son of the Rev. John Cunningham, minister of Cumnock in Ayrshire, and proprietor of the small estate Block, was born there between 1655 and 1660. He was probably educated both in the Netherlands and at Edinburgh, and was selected by William Douglas, 1st Duke of Queensberry to be tutor to his son, Lord George Douglas. Through the Queensberry influence he was appointed by the Crown to be professor of civil law in the university of Edinburgh about 1698. In 1710, when the Duke of Queensberry was out of favour with the other Whig leaders, the magistrates of Edinburgh asserted their ancient right and ousted Cunningham from the professorship to make way for their own nominee. He then left Scotland, and established himself at The Hague, where he lived on a pension granted him by the Duke of Queensberry, devoting himself to chess and the study of the classical authors and of civil law. Works Cunningham became a friend of Pieter Burman the Elder. In 1711 he discovered from Thomas Johnson, a Scottish bookseller and publisher at The Hague, that Richard Bentley was the author of the criticism inflicted on his friend Jean Leclerc for his edition of the fragments of Menander. In 1721 he published a malevolent Alexandri Cuninghamii Animadversiones in Richardi Bentleii Notas et Emendationes ad Q. Horatium Flaccum. In the same year he published his own critical edition of Horace, as Q. Horatii Flacci Poemata. He also worked at his editions of Virgil and Ph√¶drus, published at Edinburgh after his death, and projected books on the Pandects and the evidences of Christianity. His posthumous works, published in Edinburgh, were: *P. Virgilii Maronis Bucolica, Georgica et √Üneis, ex recensione Alexandri Cuninghamii Scoti, cujus emendationes subjiciuntur, 1743; and * Ph√¶dri Augusti, liberti, Fabularum √Üsopiarum libri quinque, ex emendatione Alexandri Cuninghamii Scoti, accedunt Publii Syri et aliorum veterum Sententi√¶, 1757.

This most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human experiences symbolically, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially. American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture: # biological anthropology # linguistic anthropology # cultural anthropology # archaeology Research in these fields has influenced anthropologists working in other countries to different degrees.  Biological anthropology  Discussion concerning culture among biological anthropologists centers around two debates. First, is culture uniquely human or shared by other species (most notably, other primates)? This is an important question, as the theory of evolution holds that humans are descended from (now extinct) non-human primates. Second, how did culture evolve among human beings? Gerald Weiss noted that although Tylor's classic definition of culture was restricted to humans, many anthropologists take this for granted and thus elide that important qualification from later definitions, merely equating culture with any learned behavior. This slippage is a problem because during the formative years of modern primatology, some primatologists were trained in anthropology (and understood that culture refers to learned behavior among humans), and others were not. Notable non-anthropologists, like Robert Yerkes and Jane Goodall thus argued that since chimpanzees have learned behaviors, they have culture.Robert Yerkes 1943 Chimpanzees: A Laboratory Colony. New Haven: Yale University Press. 51‚Äì52, 189, 193Jane Goodall 1963 \\"My Life Among Wild Chimpanzees\\" National Geographic 124: 308 Today, anthropological primatologists are divided, several arguing that non-human primates have culture, others arguing that they do not.R.

Andrew 1963 \\"Comment on The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture\\" Alan Bryan Current Anthropology 4: 301‚Äì303, p. 301Alan Bryan 1963 \\"The Essential Morphological basis for Human Culture\\" Current Anthropology 4: 297Keleman 1963 \\"Comment on The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture\\" Alan Bryan Current Anthropology 4: 301‚Äì303 p.304W. C. McGrew 1998 \\"Culture in nonhuman primates?\\" Annual Review of Anthropology 27: 301‚Äì328 This scientific debate is complicated by ethical concerns. The subjects of primatology are non-human primates, and whatever culture these primates have is threatened by human activity. After reviewing the research on primate culture, W. C. McGrew concluded, \\"[a] discipline requires subjects, and most species of nonhuman primates are endangered by their human cousins. Ultimately, whatever its merit, cultural primatology must be committed to cultural survival [i.e. to the survival of primate cultures].\\"W. C. McGrew 1998 \\"Culture in Nonhuman Primates?\\" Annual Review of Anthropology 27: 323 McGrew suggests a definition of culture that he finds scientifically useful for studying primate culture. He points out that scientists do not have access to the subjective thoughts or knowledge of non-human primates. Thus, if culture is defined in terms of knowledge, then scientists are severely limited in their attempts to study primate culture. Instead of defining culture as a kind of knowledge, McGrew suggests that we view culture as a process. He lists six steps in the process: # A new pattern of behavior is invented, or an existing one is modified. # The innovator transmits this pattern to another. # The form of the pattern is consistent within and across performers, perhaps even in terms of recognizable stylistic features. # The one who acquires the pattern retains the ability to perform it long after having acquired it. # The pattern spreads across social units in a population. These social units may be families, clans, troops, or bands. # The pattern endures across generations. McGrew admits that all six criteria may be strict, given the difficulties in observing primate behavior in the wild. But he also insists on the need to be as inclusive as possible, on the need for a definition of culture that \\"casts the net widely\\": As Charles Frederick Voegelin pointed out, if \\"culture\\" is reduced to \\"learned behavior,\\" then all animals have culture.C. F. Voegelin 1951 \\"Culture, Language and the Human Organism\\" Southwestern Journal of Anthropology 7: 370 Certainly all specialists agree that all primate species evidence common cognitive skills: knowledge of object-permanence, cognitive mapping, the ability to categorize objects, and creative problem solving. Moreover, all primate species show evidence of shared social skills: they recognize members of their social group; they form direct relationships based on degrees of kinship and rank; they recognize third-party social relationships; they predict future behavior; and they cooperate in problem-solving. Cast of the skeleton of Lucy, an Australopithecus afarensis hominid populations Nevertheless, the term \\"culture\\" applies to non-human animals only if we define culture as any or all learned behavior. Within mainstream physical anthropology, scholars tend to think that a more restrictive definition is necessary. These researchers are concerned with how human beings evolved to be different from other species. A more precise definition of culture, which excludes non-human social behavior, would allow physical anthropologists to study how humans evolved their unique capacity for \\"culture\\". Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus) are humans' (Homo sapiens) closest living relatives; both are descended from a common ancestor which lived around seven million years ago. Human evolution has been rapid with modern humans appearing about 340,000 years ago. During this time humanity evolved three distinctive features: :(a) the creation and use of conventional symbols, including linguistic symbols and their derivatives, such as written language and mathematical symbols and notations; (b) the creation and use of complex tools and other instrumental technologies; and (c) the creation and participation in complex social organization and institutions. According to developmental psychologist Michael Tomasello, \\"where these complex and species-unique behavioral practices, and the cognitive skills that underlie them, came from\\" is a fundamental anthropological question. Given that contemporary humans and chimpanzees are far more different from horses and zebras, or rats and mice, and that the evolution of this great difference occurred in such a short period of time, \\"our search must be for some small difference that made a big difference ‚Äì some adaptation, or small set of adaptations, that changed the process of primate cognitive evolution in fundamental ways.\\" According to Tomasello, the answer to this question must form the basis of a scientific definition of \\"human culture.\\" In a recent review of the major research on human and primate tool-use, communication, and learning strategies, Tomasello argues that the key human advances over primates (language, complex technologies, and complex social organization) are all the results of humans pooling cognitive resources. This is called \\"the ratchet effect:\\" innovations spread and are shared by a group, and mastered \\"by youngsters, which enables them to remain in their new and improved form within the group until something better comes along.\\" The key point is that children are born good at a particular kind of social learning; this creates a favored environment for social innovations, making them more likely to be maintained and transmitted to new generations than individual innovations. For Tomasello, human social learning‚Äîthe kind of learning that distinguishes humans from other primates and that played a decisive role in human evolution‚Äîis based on two elements: first, what he calls \\"imitative learning,\\" (as opposed to \\"emulative learning\\" characteristic of other primates) and second, the fact that humans represent their experiences symbolically (rather than iconically, as is characteristic of other primates). Together, these elements enable humans to be both inventive, and to preserve useful inventions. It is this combination that produces the ratchet effect. Chimpanzee mother and baby Chimpanzee extracting insects Jigokudani hot spring in Nagano The kind of learning found among other primates is \\"emulation learning,\\" which \\"focuses on the environmental events involved ‚Äì results or changes of state in the environment that the other produced ‚Äì rather than on the actions that produced those results.\\"Michael Tomasello 1990 \\"Cultural Transmission in the Tool Use and Communicatory Signaling of Chimpanzees?\\" in \\"Language\\" and Intelligence in Monkeys and Apes: Comparative Developmental Perspectives ed. S. Parker, K. Bibson. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 274‚Äì311Michael Tomasello 1996 \\"Do Apes Ape?\\" in Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture ed. C. Heyes and B. Galef. New York: Academic Press, pp. 319‚Äì346 Tomasello emphasizes that emulation learning is a highly adaptive strategy for apes because it focuses on the effects of an act. In laboratory experiments, chimpanzees were shown two different ways for using a rake-like tool to obtain an out-of-reach- object. Both methods were effective, but one was more efficient than the other. Chimpanzees consistently emulated the more efficient method.Nagell, K., Olguin, K. and Tomasello, M. 1993 \\"Processes of social learning in the tool use of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and human children (Homo sapiens)\\" in Journal of Comparative Psychology 107: 174‚Äì186 Examples of emulation learning are well documented among primates. Notable examples include Japanese macaque potato washing, chimpanzee tool use, and chimpanzee gestural communication. In 1953, an 18-month-old female macaque monkey was observed taking sandy pieces of sweet potato (given to the monkeys by observers) to a stream (and later, to the ocean) to wash off the sand. After three months, the same behavior was observed in her mother and two playmates, and then the playmates' mothers. Over the next two years seven other young macaques were observed washing their potatoes, and by the end of the third year 40% of the troop had adopted the practice.S. Kawamura 1959 \\"The process of subcultural propagation among Japanese macaques\\" Primates 2: 43‚Äì60M. Kawai 1965 \\"Newly acquired pre-cultural behavior of the natural troop of Japanese monkeys on Koshima Islet\\" Primates 6: 1‚Äì30 Although this story is popularly represented as a straightforward example of human-like learning, evidence suggests that it is not. Many monkeys naturally brush sand off food; this behavior had been observed in the macaque troop prior to the first observed washing. Moreover, potato washing was observed in four other separate macaque troops, suggesting that at least four other individual monkeys had learned to wash off sand on their own. Other monkey species in captivity quickly learn to wash off their food.E. Visalberghi and D. M. Fragaszy 1990 \\"Food washing behavior in tufted Capuchin monkeys, Cebusapella, and crabeating macaques, Macaca fasciculais\\" Animal Behavior 40: 829‚Äì836 Finally, the spread of learning among the Japanese macaques was fairly slow, and the rate at which new members of the troop learned did not keep pace with the growth of the troop. If the form of learning were imitation, the rate of learning should have been exponential. It is more likely that the monkeys' washing behavior is based on the common behavior of cleaning off food, and that monkeys that spent time by the water independently learned to wash, rather than wipe their food. This explains both why those monkeys that kept company with the original washer, and who thus spent a good deal of time by the water, also figured out how to wash their potatoes. It also explains why the rate at which this behavior spread was slow. Chimpanzees exhibit a variety of population-specific tool use: termite- fishing, ant-fishing, ant-dipping, nut-cracking, and leaf-sponging. Gombe Chimpanzees fish for termites using small, thin sticks, but chimpanzees in Western Africa use large sticks to break holes in mounds and use their hands to scoop up termites. Some of this variation may be the result of \\"environmental shaping\\" (there is more rainfall in western Africa, softening termite mounds and making them easier to break apart, than in the Gombe reserve in eastern Africa). Nevertheless, it is clear that chimpanzees are good at emulation learning. Chimpanzee children independently know how to roll over logs, and know how to eat insects. When children see their mothers rolling over logs to eat the insects beneath, they quickly learn to do the same. In other words, this form of learning builds on activities the children already know.Michael Tomasello 1996 \\"Do Apes Ape?\\" in Social Learning in Animals: The Roots of Culture ed. C. Heyes and B. Galef. New York: Academic Press. pp: 319‚Äì346 Mother and child Inuit family Girls in Xinjiang in northwestern China Children in Jerusalem The kind of learning characteristic of human children is imitative learning, which \\"means reproducing an instrumental act understood intentionally.\\" Human infants begin to display some evidence of this form of learning between the ages of nine and 12 months, when infants fix their attention not only on an object, but on the gaze of an adult which enables them to use adults as points of reference and thus \\"act on objects in the way adults are acting on them.\\" This dynamic is well documented and has also been termed \\"joint engagement\\" or \\"joint attention.\\"R.

Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Press, pp. 103‚Äì130 The development of skills in joint attention by the end of a human child's first year of life provides the basis for the development of imitative learning in the second year. In one study 14-month-old children imitated an adult's over-complex method of turning on a light, even when they could have used an easier and more natural motion to the same effect.W. C. Meltzoff 1988 \\"Infant imitation after a one-week delay: long term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli\\" in Developmental Psychology 24: 470‚Äì476 In another study, 16-month-old children interacted with adults who alternated between a complex series of motions that appeared intentional and a comparable set of motions that appeared accidental; they imitated only those motions that appeared intentional.M. Carpenter, N. Akhtar, M. Tomasello 1998 \\"Sixteen-month old infants differentially imitate intentional and accidental actions\\" in Infant Behavior & Development 21: 315‚Äì330 Another study of 18-month old children revealed that children imitate actions that adults intend, yet in some way fail, to perform.A. Meltzoff 1995 \\"Understanding the intentions of others: re- enactment of intended acts by 18-month-old children\\" in Developmental Psychology 31: 838‚Äì850 Tomasello emphasizes that this kind of imitative learning \\"relies fundamentally on infants' tendency to identify with adults, and on their ability to distinguish in the actions of others the underlying goal and the different means that might be used to achieve it.\\" He calls this kind of imitative learning \\"cultural learning because the child is not just learning about things from other persons, she is also learning things through them ‚Äî in the sense that she must know something of the adult's perspective on a situation to learn the active use of this same intentional act.\\"Tomasello, M., Kruger, A. & Ratner, H. 1993 \\"Cultural learning\\" Behavioral and Brain Sciences 16, 495‚Äì552 He concludes that the key feature of cultural learning is that it occurs only when an individual \\"understands others as intentional agents, like the self, who have a perspective on the world that can be followed into, directed and shared.\\" Emulation learning and imitative learning are two different adaptations that can only be assessed in their larger environmental and evolutionary contexts. In one experiment, chimpanzees and two-year-old children were separately presented with a rake-like-tool and an out-of-reach object. Adult humans then demonstrated two different ways to use the tool, one more efficient, one less efficient. Chimpanzees used the same efficient method following both demonstrations, regardless of what was demonstrated. Most of the human children, however, imitated whichever method the adult was demonstrating. If the chimps and humans were to be compared on the basis of these results, one might think that chimpanzees are more intelligent. From an evolutionary perspective they are equally intelligent, but with different kinds of intelligence adapted to different environments. Chimpanzee learning strategies are well-suited to a stable physical environment that requires little social cooperation (compared to humans). Human learning strategies are well-suited to a more complex social environment in which understanding the intentions of others may be more important than success at a specific task. Tomasello argues that this strategy has made possible the \\"ratchet effect\\" that enabled humans to evolve complex social systems that have enabled humans to adapt to virtually every physical environment on the surface of the earth. Tomasello further argues that cultural learning is essential for language-acquisition. Most children in any society, and all children in some, do not learn all words through the direct efforts of adults. \\"In general, for the vast majority of words in their language, children must find a way to learn in the ongoing flow of social interaction, sometimes from speech not even addressed to them.\\"Brown 1999 This finding has been confirmed by a variety of experiments in which children learned words even when the referent was not present, multiple referents were possible, and the adult was not directly trying to teach the word to the child.M. Tomasello and M. Barton 1994 \\"Learning Words in non-Ostensive Contexts\\" Developmental Psychology 30: 639‚Äì650N. Akhtar and M. Tomasello 1996 \\"Twenty-four month old children learn words for absent objects and actions\\" in British Journal of Developmental Psychology 14: 79‚Äì93M. Tomasello, R. Strosberg, N. Akhtar 1996 \\"Eighteen-month old children learn words in non- ostensive contexts\\" in Journal of Child Language; 23: 157‚Äì176 Tomasello concludes that \\"a linguistic symbol is nothing other than a marker for an intersubjectively shared understanding of a situation.\\" Tomasello's 1999 review of the research contrasting human and non-human primate learning strategies confirms biological anthropologist Ralph Holloway's 1969 argument that a specific kind of sociality linked to symbolic cognition were the keys to human evolution, and constitute the nature of culture. According to Holloway, the key issue in the evolution of H. sapiens, and the key to understanding \\"culture,\\" \\"is how man organizes his experience.\\" Culture is \\"the imposition of arbitrary form upon the environment.\\" This fact, Holloway argued, is primary to and explains what is distinctive about human learning strategies, tool-use, and language. Human tool-making and language express \\"similar, if not identical, cognitive processes\\" and provide important evidence for how humankind evolved. In other words, whereas McGrew argues that anthropologists must focus on behaviors like communication and tool-use because they have no access to the mind, Holloway argues that human language and tool-use, including the earliest stone tools in the fossil record 2.6 million years ago, are highly suggestive of cognitive differences between humans and non-humans, and that such cognitive differences in turn explain human evolution. For Holloway, the question is not whether other primates communicate, learn or make tools, but the way they do these things. \\"Washing potatoes in the ocean ... stripping branches of leaves to get termites,\\" and other examples of primate tool-use and learning \\"are iconic, and there is no feedback from the environment to the animal.\\" Human tools, however, express an independence from natural form that manifests symbolic thinking. \\"In the preparation of the stick for termite-eating, the relation between product and raw material is iconic. In the making of a stone tool, in contrast, there is no necessary relation between the form of the final product and the original material.\\" In Holloway's view, our non-human ancestors, like those of modern chimpanzees and other primates, shared motor and sensory skills, curiosity, memory, and intelligence, with perhaps differences in degree. He adds: \\"It is when these are integrated with the unique attributes of arbitrary production (symbolization) and imposition that man qua cultural man appears.\\" He also adds: This is comparable to the \\"ratcheting\\" aspect suggested by Tomasello and others that enabled human evolution to accelerate. Holloway concludes that the first instance of symbolic thought among humans provided a \\"kick-start\\" for brain development, tool complexity, social structure, and language to evolve through a constant dynamic of positive feedback. \\"This interaction between the propensity to structure the environment arbitrarily and the feedback from the environment to the organism is an emergent process, a process different in kind from anything that preceded it.\\" Arbitrariness Ancient stone tools Simple-edge chopper Chopping-tool Unretouched biface Linguists Charles Hockett and R. Ascher have identified thirteen design-features of language, some shared by other forms of animal communication. One feature that distinguishes human language is its tremendous productivity; in other words, competent speakers of a language are capable of producing an exponential number of original utterances. This productivity seems to be made possible by a few critical features unique to human language. One is \\"duality of patterning,\\" meaning that human language consists of the articulation of several distinct processes, each with its own set of rules: combining phonemes to produce morphemes, combining morphemes to produce words, and combining words to produce sentences. This means that a person can master a relatively limited number of signals and sets of rules, to create infinite combinations. Another crucial element is that human language is symbolic: the sound of words (or their shape, when written) typically bear no relation to what they represent.C. F. Hockett and R. Ascher 1964 \\"The Human Revolution\\" in Current Anthropology 4: 135‚Äì168. In other words, their meaning is arbitrary. That words have meaning is a matter of convention. Since the meaning of words are arbitrary, any word may have several meanings, and any object may be referred to using a variety of words; the actual word used to describe a particular object depends on the context, the intention of the speaker, and the ability of the listener to judge these appropriately. As Tomasello notes, Holloway argues that the stone tools associated with genus Homo have the same features of human language: He also adds: As Tomasello demonstrates, symbolic thought can operate only in a particular social environment: Biological anthropologist Terrence Deacon, in a synthesis of over twenty years of research on human evolution, human neurology, and primatology, describes this \\"ratcheting effect\\" as a form of \\"Baldwinian Evolution.\\" Named after psychologist James Baldwin, this describes a situation in which an animal's behavior has evolutionary consequences when it changes the natural environment and thus the selective forces acting on the animal. According to Deacon, this occurred between 2 and 2.5 million years ago, when we have the first fossil evidence of stone tool use and the beginning of a trend in an increase in brain size. But it is the evolution of symbolic language which is the cause‚Äîand not the effect‚Äîof these trends. More specifically, Deacon is suggesting that Australopithecines, like contemporary apes, used tools; it is possible that over the millions of years of Australopithecine history, many troops developed symbolic communication systems. All that was necessary was that one of these groups so altered their environment that \\"it introduced selection for very different learning abilities than affected prior species.\\" This troop or population kick-started the Baldwinian process (the \\"ratchet effect\\") that led to their evolution to genus Homo. The question for Deacon is what behavioral- environmental changes could have made the development of symbolic thinking adaptive? Here he emphasizes the importance of distinguishing humans from all other species, not to privilege human intelligence but to problematize it. Given that the evolution of H. sapiens began with ancestors who did not yet have \\"culture,\\" what led them to move away from cognitive, learning, communication, and tool-making strategies that were and continued to be adaptive for most other primates (and, some have suggested, most other species of animals)? Learning symbol systems is more time-consuming than other forms of communication, so symbolic thought made possible a different communication strategy, but not a more efficient one than other primates. Nevertheless, it must have offered some selective advantage to H. sapiens to have evolved. Deacon starts by looking at two key determinants in evolutionary history: foraging behavior, and patterns of sexual relations. As he observes competition for sexual access limits the possibilities for social cooperation in many species; yet, Deacon observes, there are three consistent patterns in human reproduction that distinguish them from other species: # Both males and females usually contribute effort towards the rearing of their offspring, though often to differing extents and in very different ways. # In all societies, the great majority of adult males and females are bound by long- term, exclusive sexual access rights and prohibitions to particular individuals of the opposite sex. # They maintain these exclusive sexual relations while living in modest to large-sized, multi-male, multi-female, cooperative social groups. Moreover, there is one feature common to all known human foraging societies (all humans prior to ten or fifteen thousand years ago), and markedly different from other primates: \\"the use of meat... . The appearance of the first stone tools nearly 2.5 million years ago almost certainly correlates with a radical shift in foraging behavior to gain access to meat.\\" Deacon does not believe that symbolic thought was necessary for hunting or tool-making (although tool-making may be a reliable index of symbolic thought); rather, it was necessary for the success of distinctive social relations. The key is that while men and women are equally effective foragers, mothers carrying dependent children are not effective hunters. They must thus depend on male hunters. This favors a system in which males have exclusive sexual access to females, and females can predict that their sexual partner will provide food for them and their children. In most mammalian species the result is a system of rank or sexual competition that results in either polygyny, or lifelong pair-bonding between two individuals who live relatively independent of other adults of their species; in both cases male aggression plays an important role in maintaining sexual access to mate(s). What is uniquely characteristic about human societies is what required symbolic cognition, which consequently leads to the evolution of culture: \\"cooperative, mixed-sex social groups, with significant male care and provisioning of offspring, and relatively stable patterns of reproductive exclusion.\\" This combination is relatively rare in other species because it is \\"highly susceptible to disintegration.\\" Language and culture provide the glue that holds it together. Chimpanzees also, on occasion, hunt meat; in most cases, however, males consume the meat immediately, and only on occasion share with females who happen to be nearby. Among chimpanzees, hunting for meat increases when other sources of food become scarce, but under these conditions sharing decreases. The first forms of symbolic thinking made stone tools possible, which in turn made hunting for meat a more dependable source of food for our nonhuman ancestors while making possible forms of social communication that make sharing between males and females, but also among males, decreasing sexual competition: Symbols and symbolic thinking thus make possible a central feature of social relations in every human population: reciprocity. Evolutionary scientists have developed a model to explain reciprocal altruism among closely related individuals. Symbolic thought makes possible reciprocity between distantly related individuals.  Archaeology  Excavated dwellings at Skara Brae, Europe's most complete Neolithic village Monte Alban archaeological site Excavations at the South Area of √áatal H√∂y√ºk In the 19th century archaeology was often a supplement to history, and the goal of archaeologists was to identify artifacts according to their typology and stratigraphy, thus marking their location in time and space. Franz Boas established that archaeology be one of American anthropology's four fields, and debates among archaeologists have often paralleled debates among cultural anthropologists. In the 1920s and 1930s, Australian-British archaeologist V. Gordon Childe and American archaeologist W. C. McKern independently began moving from asking about the date of an artifact, to asking about the people who produced it ‚Äî when archaeologists work alongside historians, historical materials generally help answer these questions, but when historical materials are unavailable, archaeologists had to develop new methods. Childe and McKern focused on analyzing the relationships among objects found together; their work established the foundation for a three-tiered model: # An individual artifact, which has surface, shape, and technological attributes (e.g. an arrowhead) # A sub-assemblage, consisting of artifacts that are found, and were likely used, together (e.g. an arrowhead, bow and knife) # An assemblage of sub-assemblages that together constitute the archaeological site (e.g. the arrowhead, bow and knife; a pot and the remains of a hearth; a shelter) Childe argued that a \\"constantly recurring assemblage of artifacts\\" is an \\"archaeological culture.\\"V. Gordon Childe 1929 The Danube in Prehistory Oxford: Clarendon PressBy R. Lee Lyman and Michael J. O'Brien, 2003 W.C. McKern and the Midwestern Taxonomic Method. University of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa Childe and others viewed \\"each archaeological culture ... the manifestation in material terms of a specific people.\\"Colin Renfrew and Paul Bahn, 2008 Archaeology: Theories, Methods and Practice Fifth edition. New York: Thames and Hudson. p. 470 In 1948, Walter Taylor systematized the methods and concepts that archaeologists had developed and proposed a general model for the archaeological contribution to knowledge of cultures. He began with the mainstream understanding of culture as the product of human cognitive activity, and the Boasian emphasis on the subjective meanings of objects as dependent on their cultural context. He defined culture as \\"a mental phenomenon, consisting of the contents of minds, not of material objects or observable behavior.\\" He then devised a three-tiered model linking cultural anthropology to archeology, which he called conjunctive archaeology: # Culture, which is unobservable (behavior) and nonmaterial # Behaviors resulting from culture, which are observable and nonmaterial # Objectifications, such as artifacts and architecture, which are the result of behavior and material That is, material artifacts were the material residue of culture, but not culture itself. Taylor's point was that the archaeological record could contribute to anthropological knowledge, but only if archaeologists reconceived their work not just as digging up artifacts and recording their location in time and space, but as inferring from material remains the behaviors through which they were produced and used, and inferring from these behaviors the mental activities of people. Although many archaeologists agreed that their research was integral to anthropology, Taylor's program was never fully implemented. One reason was that his three- tier model of inferences required too much fieldwork and laboratory analysis to be practical.Patty Jo Watson 1995 \\"Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept\\" in American Anthropologist 97(4) p.685 Moreover, his view that material remains were not themselves cultural, and in fact twice-removed from culture, in fact left archaeology marginal to cultural anthropology.Robert Dunnel 1986 \\"Five Decades of American Archaeology\\" in American Archaeology Past and Future: A Celebration of the Society for American Archaeology, 1935‚Äì1985. D. Meltzer and J. Sabloff, eds. Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press. p.36 In 1962, Leslie White's former student Lewis Binford proposed a new model for anthropological archaeology, called \\"the New Archaeology\\" or \\"Processual Archaeology,\\" based on White's definition of culture as \\"the extra-somatic means of adaptation for the human organism.\\"Lewis Binford 1962 \\"Archaeology as Anthropology\\" in American Antiquity 28(2):218; see White 1959 The Evolution of Culture New York: McGraw Hill p.8 This definition allowed Binford to establish archaeology as a crucial field for the pursuit of the methodology of Julian Steward's cultural ecology: In other words, Binford proposed an archaeology that would be central to the dominant project of cultural anthropologists at the time (culture as non- genetic adaptations to the environment); the \\"new archaeology\\" was the cultural anthropology (in the form of cultural ecology or ecological anthropology) of the past. In the 1980s, there was a movement in the United Kingdom and Europe against the view of archeology as a field of anthropology, echoing Radcliffe-Brown's earlier rejection of cultural anthropology.Patty Jo Watson 1995 \\"Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept\\" in American Anthropologist 97(4) p.684 During this same period, then-Cambridge archaeologist Ian Hodder developed \\"post-processual archaeology\\" as an alternative. Like Binford (and unlike Taylor) Hodder views artifacts not as objectifications of culture but as culture itself. Unlike Binford, however, Hodder does not view culture as an environmental adaptation. Instead, he \\"is committed to a fluid semiotic version of the traditional culture concept in which material items, artifacts, are full participants in the creation, deployment, alteration, and fading away of symbolic complexes.\\"Patty Jo Watson 1995 \\"Archeology, Anthropology, and the Culture Concept\\" in American Anthropologist 97(4) pp. 687‚Äì6874 His 1982 book, Symbols in Action, evokes the symbolic anthropology of Geertz, Schneider, with their focus on the context dependent meanings of cultural things, as an alternative to White and Steward's materialist view of culture.Ian Hodder 1982 Symbols in action: ethnoarchaeological studies of material culture Cambridge: Cambridge University Press In his 1991 textbook, Reading the Past: Current Approaches to Interpretation in Archaeology Hodder argued that archaeology is more closely aligned to history than to anthropology.Ian Hodder 1986 Reading the past: current approaches to interpretation in archaeology Cambridge: Cambridge University Press  Linguistic anthropology  The connection between culture and language has been noted as far back as the classical period and probably long before. The ancient Greeks, for example, distinguished between civilized peoples and b√°rbaroi \\"those who babble\\", i.e. those who speak unintelligible languages.Baepler, Paul. 2003. \\"White slaves, African masters.\\" The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 588(1): 90‚Äì111. p. 91 The fact that different groups speak different, unintelligible languages is often considered more tangible evidence for cultural differences than other less obvious cultural traits. The German romanticists of the 19th century such as Johann Gottfried Herder and Wilhelm von Humboldt, often saw language not just as one cultural trait among many but rather as the direct expression of a people's national character, and as such as culture in a kind of condensed form. Herder for example suggests, \\"Denn jedes Volk ist Volk; es hat seine National Bildung wie seine Sprache\\" (Since every people is a People, it has its own national culture expressed through its own language).Quoted in Anderson, Benedict R.O'G. 1983. Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism. London: Verso. Franz Boas, founder of American anthropology, like his German forerunners, maintained that the shared language of a community is the most essential carrier of their common culture. Boas was the first anthropologist who considered it unimaginable to study the culture of a foreign people without also becoming acquainted with their language. For Boas, the fact that the intellectual culture of a people was largely constructed, shared and maintained through the use of language, meant that understanding the language of a cultural group was the key to understanding its culture. At the same time, though, Boas and his students were aware that culture and language are not directly dependent on one another. That is, groups with widely different cultures may share a common language, and speakers of completely unrelated languages may share the same fundamental cultural traits.Sapir 1921:228Sapir 1995: 59 Numerous other scholars have suggested that the form of language determines specific cultural traits.e.g. Von Humboldt, Wilhelm. 1820. √úber das vergleichende Sprachstudium in Beziehung auf die verschiedenen Epochen der Sprachentwicklung. This is similar to the notion of linguistic determinism, which states that the form of language determines individual thought. While Boas himself rejected a causal link between language and culture, some of his intellectual heirs entertained the idea that habitual patterns of speaking and thinking in a particular language may influence the culture of the linguistic group. Such belief is related to the theory of linguistic relativity. Boas, like most modern anthropologists, however, was more inclined to relate the interconnectedness between language and culture to the fact that, as B.L. Whorf put it, \\"they have grown up together\\".See also e.g. Boas, Franz. 1911. \\"Introduction.\\" Handbook of American Indian Languages. Washington: Smithsonian Institution, Bureau of American Ethnology. Indeed, the origin of language, understood as the human capacity of complex symbolic communication, and the origin of complex culture is often thought to stem from the same evolutionary process in early man. Evolutionary anthropologist Robin I. Dunbar has proposed that language evolved as early humans began to live in large communities which required the use of complex communication to maintain social coherence. Language and culture then both emerged as a means of using symbols to construct social identity and maintain coherence within a social group too large to rely exclusively on pre-human ways of building community such as for example grooming. Since language and culture are both in essence symbolic systems, twentieth century cultural theorists have applied the methods of analyzing language developed in the science of linguistics to also analyze culture. Particularly the structural theory of Ferdinand de Saussure which describes symbolic systems as consisting of signs (a pairing of a particular form with a particular meaning) has come to be applied widely in the study of culture. But also post-structuralist theories that nonetheless still rely on the parallel between language and culture as systems of symbolic communication, have been applied in the field of semiotics. The parallel between language and culture can then be understood as analog to the parallel between a linguistic sign, consisting for example of the sound [kau] and the meaning \\"cow\\", and a cultural sign, consisting for example of the cultural form of \\"wearing a crown\\" and the cultural meaning of \\"being king\\". In this way it can be argued that culture is itself a kind of language. Another parallel between cultural and linguistic systems is that they are both systems of practice, that is, they are a set of special ways of doing things that is constructed and perpetuated through social interactions.(Duranti 1997: 49)(Mannheim & Tedlock 1995: 2) Children, for example, acquire language in the same way as they acquire the basic cultural norms of the society they grow up in ‚Äì through interaction with older members of their cultural group. However, languages, now understood as the particular set of speech norms of a particular community, are also a part of the larger culture of the community that speak them. Humans use language as a way of signalling identity with one cultural group and difference from others. Even among speakers of one language several different ways of using the language exist, and each is used to signal affiliation with particular subgroups within a larger culture. In linguistics such different ways of using the same language are called \\"varieties\\". For example, the English language is spoken differently in the US, the UK and Australia, and even within English-speaking countries there are hundreds of dialects of English that each signals a belonging to a particular region and/or subculture. For example, in the UK the cockney dialect signals its speakers' belonging to the group of lower class workers of east London. Differences between varieties of the same language often consist in different pronunciations and vocabulary, but also sometimes of different grammatical systems and very often in using different styles (e.g. cockney rhyming slang or lawyers' jargon). Linguists and anthropologists, particularly sociolinguists, ethnolinguists and linguistic anthropologists have specialized in studying how ways of speaking vary between speech communities. A community's ways of speaking or signing are a part of the community's culture, just as other shared practices are. Language use is a way of establishing and displaying group identity. Ways of speaking function not only to facilitate communication, but also to identify the social position of the speaker. Linguists call different ways of speaking language varieties, a term that encompasses geographically or socioculturally defined dialects as well as the jargons or styles of subcultures. Linguistic anthropologists and sociologists of language define communicative style as the ways that language is used and understood within a particular culture.Clancy, Patricia. (1986) \\"The acquisition of communicative style in Japanese.\\" In B. Schieffelin and E. Ochs (eds) Language Socialization across Cultures. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The difference between languages does not consist only in differences in pronunciation, vocabulary or grammar, but also in different \\"cultures of speaking\\". Some cultures for example have elaborate systems of \\"social deixis\\", systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means.Foley 1997 p?? In English, social deixis is shown mostly though distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, but also in titles such as \\"Mrs.\\", \\"boy\\", \\"Doctor\\" or \\"Your Honor\\", but in other languages such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. In several languages of east Asia, for example Thai, Burmese and Javanese, different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest. Other languages may use different forms of address when speaking to speakers of the opposite gender or in-law relatives and many languages have special ways of speaking to infants and children. Among other groups, the culture of speaking may entail not speaking to particular people, for example many indigenous cultures of Australia have a taboo against talking to one's in-law relatives, and in some cultures speech is not addressed directly to children. Some languages also require different ways of speaking for different social classes of speakers, and often such a system is based on gender differences, as in Japanese and Koasati.Men's and Women's Speech in Koasati, Mary R. Haas, Language, Vol. 20, No. 3 (Jul. ‚Äì Sep., 1944), pp. 142‚Äì149 (also summarized in Foley 1997)  Cultural anthropology = Universal versus particular  Franz Boas established modern American anthropology as the study of the sum total of human phenomena. c. 1915 The modern anthropological concept of culture has its origins in the 19th century with German anthropologist Adolf Bastian's theory of the \\"psychic unity of mankind,\\" which, influenced by Herder and von Humboldt, challenged the identification of \\"culture\\" with the way of life of European elites, and British anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor's attempt to define culture as inclusively as possible. Tylor in 1874 described culture in the following way: \\"Culture or civilization, taken in its wide ethnographic sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\"Tylor, E.B. 1874. Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom. Although Tylor was not aiming to propose a general theory of culture (he explained his understanding of culture in the course of a larger argument about the nature of religion), American anthropologists have generally presented their various definitions of culture as refinements of Tylor's. Franz Boas's student Alfred Kroeber (1876‚Äì1970) identified culture with the \\"superorganic,\\" that is, a domain with ordering principles and laws that could not be explained by or reduced to biology.A. L. Kroeber 1917 \\"The Superorganic\\" American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 19, No. 2 pp. 163‚Äì213. In 1973, Gerald Weiss reviewed various definitions of culture and debates as to their parsimony and power, and proposed as the most scientifically useful definition that \\"culture\\" be defined \\"as our generic term for all human nongenetic, or metabiological, phenomena\\" (italics in the original).Gerald Weiss 1973 \\"A Scientific Concept of Culture\\" in American Anthropologist 75(5): 1382 Ruth Benedict was instrumental in establishing the modern conception of distinct cultures being patterned. 1937 Franz Boas founded modern American anthropology with the establishment of the first graduate program in anthropology at Columbia University in 1896. At the time the dominant model of culture was that of cultural evolution, which posited that human societies progressed through stages of savagery to barbarism to civilization; thus, societies that for example are based on horticulture and Iroquois kinship terminology are less evolved than societies based on agriculture and Eskimo kinship terminology. One of Boas's greatest accomplishments was to demonstrate convincingly that this model is fundamentally flawed, empirically, methodologically, and theoretically. Moreover, he felt that our knowledge of different cultures was so incomplete, and often based on unsystematic or unscientific research, that it was impossible to develop any scientifically valid general model of human cultures. Instead, he established the principle of cultural relativism and trained students to conduct rigorous participant observation field research in different societies. Boas understood the capacity for culture to involve symbolic thought and social learning, and considered the evolution of a capacity for culture to coincide with the evolution of other, biological, features defining genus Homo. Nevertheless, he argued that culture could not be reduced to biology or other expressions of symbolic thought, such as language. Boas and his students understood culture inclusively and resisted developing a general definition of culture. Indeed, they resisted identifying \\"culture\\" as a thing, instead using culture as an adjective rather than a noun. Boas argued that cultural \\"types\\" or \\"forms\\" are always in a state of flux.Franz Boas 1940 [1920] \\"The Methods of Ethnology\\", in Race, Language and Culture ed. George Stocking.

Others, such as Ruth Benedict (1887‚Äì1948) and Margaret Mead (1901‚Äì1978), produced monographs or comparative studies analyzing the forms of creativity possible to individuals within specific cultural configurations..Benedict, Ruth. The Chrysanthemum and the Sword: Patterns of Japanese Culture. Rutland, VT and Tokyo, Japan: Charles E. Tuttle Co. 1954 orig. 1946.Margaret Mead 1928 Coming of Age in Samoa Essential to their research was the concept of \\"context\\": culture provided a context that made the behavior of individuals understandable; geography and history provided a context for understanding the differences between cultures. Thus, although Boasians were committed to the belief in the psychic unity of humankind and the universality of culture, their emphasis on local context and cultural diversity led them away from proposing cultural universals or universal theories of culture. There is a tension in cultural anthropology between the claim that culture is a universal (the fact that all human societies have culture), and that it is also particular (culture takes a tremendous variety of forms around the world). Since Boas, two debates have dominated cultural anthropology. The first has to do with ways of modeling particular cultures. Specifically, anthropologists have argued as to whether \\"culture\\" can be thought of as a bounded and integrated thing, or as a quality of a diverse collection of things, the numbers and meanings of which are in constant flux. Boas's student Ruth Benedict suggested that in any given society cultural traits may be more or less \\"integrated,\\" that is, constituting a pattern of action and thought that gives purpose to people's lives, and provides them with a basis from which to evaluate new actions and thoughts, although she implies that there are various degrees of integration; indeed, she observes that some cultures fail to integrate. pp.46‚Äì47 Boas, however, argued that complete integration is rare and that a given culture only appears to be integrated because of observer bias.Franz Boas 1940 [1932] \\"The Aims of Anthropological Research,\\" in Race, Language and Culture ed. George Stocking. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 256 For Boas, the appearance of such patterns‚Äîa national culture, for example‚Äîwas the effect of a particular point of view.Bashkow, Ira 2004 \\"A Neo-Boasian Conception of Cultural Boundaries\\" American Anthropologist 106(3): 446 The first debate was effectively suspended in 1934 when Ruth Benedict published Patterns of Culture, which has continuously been in print. Although this book is well known for popularizing the Boasian principle of cultural relativism, among anthropologists it constituted both an important summary of the discoveries of Boasians, and a decisive break from Boas's emphasis on the mobility of diverse cultural traits. \\"Anthropological work has been overwhelmingly devoted to the analysis of cultural traits,\\" she wrote \\"rather than to the study of cultures as articulated wholes.\\" p. 48 Influenced by Polish-British social anthropologist Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski, however, she argued that \\"The first essential, so it seems today, is to study the living culture, to know its habits of thought and the functions of its institutions\\" and that \\"the only way in which we can know the significance of the selected detail of behavior is against the background of the motives and emotions and values that are institutionalized in that culture.\\" p. 49 Influenced by German historians Wilhelm Dilthey and Oswald Spengler, as well as by gestalt psychology, she argued that \\"the whole determines its parts, not only their relation but their very nature,\\"Ruth Benedict 1934 Patterns of Culture Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company p. 52 and that \\"cultures, likewise, are more than the sum of their traits.\\" p. 47 She observed that \\"Just as each spoken language draws very selectively from an extensive, but finite, set of sounds any human mouth (free from defect) can make, she concluded that in each society people, over time and through both conscious and unconscious processes, selected from an extensive but finite set of cultural traits which then combine to form a unique and distinctive pattern.\\" pp. 23‚Äì24 Further, Benedict argues Although Benedict felt that virtually all cultures are patterned, she argued that these patterns change over time as a consequence of human creativity, and therefore different societies around the world had distinct characters. Patterns of Culture contrasts Zu≈ài, Dobu and Kwakiutl cultures as a way of highlighting different ways of being human. Benedict observed that many Westerners felt that this view forced them to abandon their \\"dreams of permanence and ideality and with the individual's illusions of autonomy\\" and that for many, this made existence \\"empty.\\" p.277 She argued however that once people accepted the results of scientific research, people would \\"arrive then at a more realistic social faith, accepting as grounds of hope and as new bases for tolerance the coexisting and equally valid patterns of life which mankind has created for itself from the raw materials of existence.\\" This view of culture has had a tremendous impact outside of anthropology, and dominated American anthropology until the Cold War, when anthropologists like Sidney Mintz and Eric Wolf rejected the validity and value of approaching \\"each culture\\" as \\"a world in itself\\" and \\"relatively stable.\\" p.271 They felt that, too often, this approach ignored the impact of imperialism, colonialism, and the world capitalist economy on the peoples Benedict and her followers studied (and thus re-opened the debate on the relationship between the universal and the particular, in the form of the relationship between the global and the local). In the meantime, its emphasis on metamorphosing patterns influenced French structuralism and made American anthropologists receptive to British structural-functionalism. Turkish nomad clan with the nodes as marriages Mexican village with the nodes as marriages Iroqois Kinship Structure The second debate has been over the ability to make universal claims about all cultures. Although Boas argued that anthropologists had yet to collect enough solid evidence from a diverse sample of societies to make any valid general or universal claims about culture, by the 1940s some felt ready. Whereas Kroeber and Benedict had argued that \\"culture\\"‚Äîwhich could refer to local, regional, or trans-regional scales‚Äîwas in some way \\"patterned\\" or \\"configured,\\" some anthropologists now felt that enough data had been collected to demonstrate that it often took highly structured forms. The question these anthropologists debated was, were these structures statistical artifacts, or where they expressions of mental models? This debate emerged full-fledged in 1949, with the publication of George Murdock's Social Structure, and Claude L√©vi- Strauss's Les Structures √âl√©mentaires de la Parent√©. Opposing Boas and his students was Yale anthropologist George Murdock, who compiled the Human Relations Area Files. These files code cultural variables found in different societies, so that anthropologists can use statistical methods to study correlations among different variables.Murdock, George, 1949 Social Structure New York: The Macmillan CompanyMurdock, G. P. 1967. Ethnographic Atlas: A Summary. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh PressMurdock, G. P. 1981. Atlas of World Cultures. Pittsburgh: The University of Pittsburgh Press. The ultimate aim of this project is to develop generalizations that apply to increasingly larger numbers of individual cultures. Later, Murdock and Douglas R. White developed the standard cross-cultural sample as a way to refine this method. French anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss's structuralist anthropology brought together ideas of Boas (especially Boas's belief in the mutability of cultural forms, and Bastian's belief in the psychic unity of humankind) and French sociologist's √âmile Durkheim's focus on social structures (institutionalized relationships among persons and groups of persons). Instead of making generalizations that applied to large numbers of societies, L√©vi- Strauss sought to derive from concrete cases increasingly abstract models of human nature. His method begins with the supposition that culture exists in two different forms: the many distinct structures that could be inferred from observing members of the same society interact (and of which members of a society are themselves aware), and abstract structures developed by analyzing shared ways (such as myths and rituals) members of a society represent their social life (and of which members of a society are not only not consciously aware, but which moreover typically stand in opposition to, or negate, the social structures of which people are aware). He then sought to develop one universal mental structure that could only be inferred through the systematic comparison of particular social and cultural structures. He argued that just as there are laws through which a finite and relatively small number of chemical elements could be combined to create a seemingly infinite variety of things, there were a finite and relatively small number of cultural elements which people combine to create the great variety of cultures anthropologists observe. The systematic comparison of societies would enable an anthropologist to develop this cultural \\"table of elements,\\" and once completed, this table of cultural elements would enable an anthropologist to analyze specific cultures and achieve insights hidden to the very people who produced and lived through these cultures.L√©vi-Strauss, Claude 1955 Tristes Tropiques Atheneum PressL√©vi-Strauss, Claude Mythologiques I-IV (trans. John Weightman and Doreen Weightman); Le Cru et le cuit (1964), The Raw and the Cooked (1969); Du miel aux cendres (1966), From Honey to Ashes (1973); L'Origine des mani√®res de table (1968) The Origin of Table Manners (1978); L'Homme nu (1971), The Naked Man (1981) Structuralism came to dominate French anthropology and, in the late 1960s and 1970s, came to have great influence on American and British anthropology. Murdock's HRAF and L√©vi-Strauss's structuralism provide two ambitious ways to seek the universal in the particular, and both approaches continue to appeal to different anthropologists. However, the differences between them reveal a tension implicit in the heritage of Tylor and Bastian. Is culture to be found in empirically observed behaviors that may form the basis of generalizations? Or does it consist of universal mental processes, which must be inferred and abstracted from observed behavior? This question has driven debates among biological anthropologists and archeologists as well.  Structural functionalism  In structural functionalism, as a social theory, society is viewed as \\"a reality of structural and cultural components or \\"facts\\" that can be investigated\\".Structural-functionalism in Michael Rosenberg, Introduction to Sociology, Routledge, 1983 Thus in the 1940s the Boasian understanding of culture was challenged by that new paradigm for anthropological and social science research. This paradigm developed independently but in parallel in both the United Kingdom and in the United States (In both cases it is sui generis: it has no direct relationship to \\"structuralism\\" except that both French structuralism and Anglo-American Structural-Functionalism were all influenced by Durkheim. It is also analogous, but unrelated to, other forms of \\"functionalism\\"). Whereas the Boasians viewed anthropology as that natural science dedicated to the study of humankind, structural functionalists viewed anthropology as one social science among many, dedicated to the study of one specific facet of humanity. This led structural-functionalists to redefine and minimize the scope of \\"culture.\\" In the United Kingdom, the creation of structural functionalism was anticipated by Raymond Firth's (1901‚Äì2002) We the Tikopia, published in 1936, and marked by the publication of African Political Systems, edited by Meyer Fortes (1906‚Äì1983) and E.E. Evans-Pritchard (1902‚Äì1973) in 1940.Raymond Firth 1936 We the Tikopia: A Sociological Study of Kinship in Primitive Polynesia London Allen and UnwinMeyer Fortes and E.E. Evans Pritchard 1940. African Political Systems. London and New York: International African Institute. In these works these anthropologists forwarded a synthesis of the ideas of their mentor, Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski (1884‚Äì1942), and his rival, A. R. Radcliffe-Brown (1881‚Äì1955). Both Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown viewed anthropology‚Äîwhat they call \\"social anthropology\\"‚Äîas that branch of sociology that studied so-called primitive societies. According to Malinowski's theory of functionalism, all human beings have certain biological needs, such as the need for food and shelter, and humankind has the biological need to reproduce. Every society develops its own institutions, which function to fulfill these needs. In order for these institutions to function, individuals take on particular social roles that regulate how they act and interact. Although members of any given society may not understand the ultimate functions of their roles and institutions, an ethnographer can develop a model of these functions through the careful observation of social life.Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski 1944 The Scientific Theory of Culture Radcliffe-Brown rejected Malinowski's notion of function, and believed that a general theory of primitive social life could only be built up through the careful comparison of different societies. Influenced by the work of French sociologist √âmile Durkheim (1858‚Äì1917), who argued that primitive and modern societies are distinguished by distinct social structures, Radcliffe-Brown argued that anthropologists first had to map out the social structure of any given society before comparing the structures of different societies.A.R. Radcliffe-Brown 1952 Structure and Function in Primitive Society Firth, Fortes, and Evans-Pritchard found it easy to combine Malinowski's attention to social roles and institutions with Radcliffe-Brown's concern with social structures. They distinguished between \\"social organization\\" (observable social interactions) and \\"social structure\\" (rule-governed patterns of social interaction), and shifted their attention from biological functions to social functions. For example, how different institutions are functionally integrated, and the extent to, and ways in, which institutions function to promote social solidarity and stability. In short, instead of culture (understood as all human non-genetic or extra- somatic phenomena) they made \\"sociality\\" (interactions and relationships among persons and groups of people) their object of study. (Indeed, Radcliffe-Brown once wrote \\"I should like to invoke a taboo on the word culture.\\")A.R. Radcliffe-Brown 1957 A Natural Science of Society Glencoe: The Free Press p. 53 Coincidentally, in 1946 sociologist Talcott Parsons (1902‚Äì1979) founded the Department of Social Relations at Harvard University. Influenced by such European sociologists as √âmile Durkheim and Max Weber, Parsons developed a theory of social action that was closer to British social anthropology than to Boas's American anthropology, and which he also called \\"structural functionalism.\\" Parson's intention was to develop a total theory of social action (why people act as they do), and to develop at Harvard an inter- disciplinary program that would direct research according to this theory. His model explained human action as the result of four systems: # the \\"behavioral system\\" of biological needs # the \\"personality system\\" of an individual's characteristics affecting their functioning in the social world # the \\"social system\\" of patterns of units of social interaction, especially social status and role # the \\"cultural system\\" of norms and values that regulate social action symbolically According to this theory, the second system was the proper object of study for psychologists; the third system for sociologists, and the fourth system for cultural anthropologists.Talcott Parsons 1937, The Structure of Social ActionTalcott Parsons 1951, The Social System Whereas the Boasians considered all of these systems to be objects of study by anthropologists, and \\"personality\\" and \\"status and role\\" to be as much a part of \\"culture\\" as \\"norms and values,\\" Parsons envisioned a much narrower role for anthropology and a much narrower definition of culture. Although Boasian cultural anthropologists were interested in norms and values, among many other things, it was only with the rise of structural functionalism that people came to identify \\"culture\\" with \\"norms and values.\\" Many American anthropologists rejected this view of culture (and by implication, anthropology). In 1980, anthropologist Eric Wolf wrote, Nevertheless, several of Talcott Parsons' students emerged as leading American anthropologists. At the same time, many American anthropologists had a high regard for the research produced by social anthropologists in the 1940s and 1950s, and found structural-functionalism to provide a very useful model for conducting ethnographic research. The combination of American cultural anthropology theory with British social anthropology methods has led to some confusion between the concepts of \\"society\\" and \\"culture.\\" For most anthropologists, these are distinct concepts. Society refers to a group of people; culture refers to a pan-human capacity and the totality of non-genetic human phenomena. Societies are often clearly bounded; cultural traits are often mobile, and cultural boundaries, such as they are, can be typically porous, permeable, and plural.Ira Bashkow, 2004 \\"A Neo-Boasian Conception of Cultural Boundaries,\\" American Anthropologist 106(3):445‚Äì446 During the 1950s, and 1960s anthropologists often worked in places where social and cultural boundaries coincided, thus obscuring the distinction. When disjunctures between these boundaries become highly salient, for example during the period of European de-colonization of Africa in the 1960s and 1970s, or during the post-Bretton Woods realignment of globalization, however, the difference often becomes central to anthropological debates.Appadurai, Arjun 1986 The Social Life of Things.

Symbolic versus adaptive  American kinship Huli Wigman from the Southern Highlands Cleveley's depiction of Captain Cook Parsons' students Clifford Geertz and David M. Schneider, and Schneider's student Roy Wagner, went on to important careers as cultural anthropologists and developed a school within American cultural anthropology called \\"symbolic anthropology,\\" the study of the social construction and social effects of symbols.Clifford Geertz 1973 The Interpretation of Cultures New York: Basic BooksDavid Schneider 1968 American Kinship: A Cultural Account Chicago: University of Chicago PressRoy Wagner 1980 American Kinship: A Cultural Account Chicago: University of Chicago PressJanet Dolgin, David Kemnitzer, and David Schneider, eds. Symbolic Anthropology: a Reader in the Study of Symbols and Meanings Since symbolic anthropology easily complemented social anthropologists' studies of social life and social structure, many British structural-functionalists (who rejected or were uninterested in Boasian cultural anthropology) accepted the Parsonian definition of \\"culture\\" and \\"cultural anthropology.\\" British anthropologist Victor Turner (who eventually left the United Kingdom to teach in the United States) was an important bridge between American and British symbolic anthropology.Victor Turner 1967 The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual Ithaca: Cornell University Press Attention to symbols, the meaning of which depended almost entirely on their historical and social context, appealed to many Boasians. Leslie White asked of cultural things, \\"What sort of objects are they? Are they physical objects? Mental objects? Both? Metaphors? Symbols? Reifications?\\" In Science of Culture (1949), he concluded that they are objects \\"sui generis\\"; that is, of their own kind. In trying to define that kind, he hit upon a previously unrealized aspect of symbolization, which he called \\"the symbolate\\"‚Äîan object created by the act of symbolization. He thus defined culture as \\"symbolates understood in an extra-somatic context.\\"White, L. 1949. The Science of Culture: A study of man and civilization. Nevertheless, by the 1930s White began turning away from the Boasian approach.Richard A. Barrett 1989, \\"The Paradoxical Anthropology of Leslie White,\\" American Anthropologist Vol. 91, No. 4 (Dec., 1989), pp. 986‚Äì999 He wrote, Although this view echoes that of Malinowski, the key concept for White was not \\"function\\" but \\"adaptation.\\" Whereas the Boasians were interested in the history of specific traits, White was interested in the cultural history of the human species, which he felt should be studied from an evolutionary perspective. Thus, the task of anthropology is to study \\"not only how culture evolves, but why as well.... In the case of man ... the power to invent and to discover, the ability to select and use the better of two tools or ways of doing something‚Äî these are the factors of cultural evolution.\\"Leslie White, 1943 \\"Energy and the Evolution of Culture.\\" American Anthropologist 45: 339 Unlike 19th century evolutionists, who were concerned with how civilized societies rose above primitive societies, White was interested in documenting how, over time, humankind as a whole has through cultural means discovered more and more ways for capturing and harnessing energy from the environment, in the process transforming culture. At the same time that White was developing his theory of cultural evolution, Kroeber's student Julian Steward was developing his theory of cultural ecology. In 1938, he published Basin-Plateau Aboriginal Socio-Political Groups in which he argued that diverse societies‚Äîfor example the indigenous Shoshone or White farmers on the Great Plains‚Äîwere not less or more evolved; rather, they had adapted to different environments in different ways.Julian Steward 1938 Basin Plateau Aboriginal Socio-political Groups (Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin, No 20) Whereas Leslie White was interested in culture understood holistically as a property of the human species, Julian Steward was interested in culture as the property of distinct societies. Like White he viewed culture as a means of adapting to the environment, but he criticized Whites \\"unilineal\\" (one direction) theory of cultural evolution and instead proposed a model of \\"multilineal\\" evolution in which (in the Boasian tradition) each society has its own cultural history.Julian Steward 1955 Theory of Culture Change: The Methodology of Multilinear Evolution University of Illinois Press When Julian Steward left a teaching position at the University of Michigan to work in Utah in 1930, Leslie White took his place; in 1946 Julian Steward was made Chair of the Columbia University Anthropology Department. In the 1940s and 1950s their students, most notably Marvin Harris, Sidney Mintz, Robert Murphy, Roy Rappaport, Marshall Sahlins, Elman Service, Andrew P. Vayda and Eric Wolf dominated American anthropology.Marvin Harris 1979 Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture New York: Random HouseMarvin Harris 1977 Cannibals and Kings: Origins of Cultures New York: VintageMarvin Harris 1974 Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches: The Riddles of Culture New York: VintageRoy A.

Harris, Rappaport, and Vayda were especially important for their contributions to cultural materialism and ecological anthropology, both of which argued that \\"culture\\" constituted an extra-somatic (or non-biological) means through which human beings could adapt to life in drastically differing physical environments. The debate between symbolic and materialist approaches to culture dominated American anthropologists in the 1960s and 1970s. The Vietnam War and the publication of Dell Hymes' Reinventing Anthropology, however, marked a growing dissatisfaction with the then dominant approaches to culture. Hymes argued that fundamental elements of the Boasian project such as holism and an interest in diversity were still worth pursuing: \\"interest in other peoples and their ways of life, and concern to explain them within a frame of reference that includes ourselves.\\" Moreover, he argued that cultural anthropologists are singularly well-equipped to lead this study (with an indirect rebuke to sociologists like Parsons who sought to subsume anthropology to their own project): It is these elements, Hymes argued, that justify a \\"general study of man,\\" that is, \\"anthropology\\". During this time notable anthropologists such as Mintz, Murphy, Sahlins, and Wolf eventually broke away; experimenting with structuralist and Marxist approaches to culture, they continued to promote cultural anthropology against structural functionalism.Sidney Mintz 1985 Sweetness and Power New York: Viking PressRobert Murphy 1971 The Dialectics of Social Life New York: Basic BooksMarshall Sahlins 1976 Culture and Practical Reason Chicago: University of Chicago PressEric Wolf 1971 Peasant Wars of the Twentieth CenturyEric Wolf, 1982 Europe and the People Without History Berkeley: University of California Press  Local versus global  Taiwanese aborigines dancing Boas and Malinowski established ethnographic research as a highly localized method for studying culture. Yet Boas emphasized that culture is dynamic, moving from one group of people to another, and that specific cultural forms have to be analyzed in a larger context. This has led anthropologists to explore different ways of understanding the global dimensions of culture. In the 1940s and 1950s, several key studies focused on how trade between indigenous peoples and the Europeans who had conquered and colonized the Americas influenced indigenous culture, either through change in the organization of labor, or change in critical technologies. Bernard Mishkin studied the effect of the introduction of horses on Kiowa political organization and warfare.Mishkin, Bernard 1940 Rank and Warfare in Plains Indian Culture. Monographs of the American Ethnological Society no. 3. New York: J.J. Augustin.

American Ethnological Society Monograph 21, New York: J.J. Augustin. Tepozteco mountain dominates views from Tepoztl√°n. In the 1950s, Robert Redfield and students of Julian Steward pioneered \\"community studies,\\" namely, the study of distinct communities (whether identified by race, ethnicity, or economic class) in Western or \\"Westernized\\" societies, especially cities. They thus encountered the antagonisms 19th century critics described using the terms \\"high culture\\" and \\"low culture.\\" These 20th-century anthropologists struggled to describe people who were politically and economically inferior but not, they believed, culturally inferior. Oscar Lewis proposed the concept of a \\"culture of poverty\\" to describe the cultural mechanisms through which people adapted to a life of economic poverty. Other anthropologists and sociologists began using the term \\"sub-culture\\" to describe culturally distinct communities that were part of larger societies. One important kind of subculture is that formed by an immigrant community. In dealing with immigrant groups and their cultures, there are various approaches: * Leitkultur (core culture): A model developed in Germany by Bassam Tibi. The idea is that minorities can have an identity of their own, but they should at least support the core concepts of the culture on which the society is based. * Melting pot: In the United States, the traditional view has been one of a melting pot where all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention. * Monoculturalism: In some European states, culture is very closely linked to nationalism, thus government policy is to assimilate immigrants, although recent increases in migration have led many European states to experiment with forms of multiculturalism. * Multiculturalism: A policy that immigrants and others should preserve their cultures with the different cultures interacting peacefully within one nation. The way nation states treat immigrant cultures rarely falls neatly into one or another of the above approaches. The degree of difference with the host culture (i.e., \\"foreignness\\"), the number of immigrants, attitudes of the resident population, the type of government policies that are enacted, and the effectiveness of those policies all make it difficult to generalize about the effects. Similarly with other subcultures within a society, attitudes of the mainstream population and communications between various cultural groups play a major role in determining outcomes. The study of cultures within a society is complex and research must take into account a myriad of variables.

The brecciated purple portions are quartzite, and the matrix is white quartz A sample of Baraboo Quartzite. Baraboo Quartzite is a Precambrian geological formationHanson, G. F., Geology of the Barabou District, Wisconsin , The University of Wisconsin Extension, 1970, Information Circular 14 of quartzite, found in the region of Baraboo, Wisconsin. While pure quartzite is usually white or gray, Baraboo Quartzite is typically dark purple to maroon in color, due to the presence of iron (hematite) and other impurities. Baraboo Quartzite may display strata created by progressive deposition of layers of sand in the original sandstone from which the quartzite was formed (through metamorphism). Specimens of Baraboo quartzite may also display ripple marks that appear visually similar to the patterns one might see in the sand at a beach. Ripples indicate that the sandstone from which the quartzite was metamorphosed was originally water-laid sediment. Sandstone is converted into quartzite through heating and pressure usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts. Uses Quartzite is a decorative stone and may be used to cover walls, as roofing tiles, as flooring, and stairsteps. Crushed quartzite is sometimes used in road construction.

He goes to see Mayme, exasperating secretary-girlfriend Phyllis Hamilton, who was counting on a vacation with Shayne and promptly quits. After learning from Mayme that something's amiss at Santa Rosita racetrack, Shayne is ambushed and beaten by a pair of thugs. Newspaper reporter Tim Rourke is sent by Shayne to see Mayme and finds her dead. Shayne learns of a counterfeit-ticket racket that is costing the racetrack a lot of money.

Edwards turns out to be an escaped convict from Joliet whose fellow former inmate Theodore Ross is now a fugitive as well. Hardeman is shot, as is Edwards. In the end, Shayne proves to Detective Pete Rafferty that it was Ross, now going by the alias Madden, who was behind the scheme. Phyllis forgives the private eye and begins planning their vacation.

Gameplay  The gameplay of Pyongyang Racer focuses largely on driving a North Korean car Hwiparam IIhttp://pyeonghwamotors.com through the streets of Pyongyang. Specifically, certain rules and regulations must be followed, such as the need to continually hit barrels of gasoline to maintain a depleting fuel meter. In addition, certain obstacles and objects must be avoided, or will result in points deducted. Other cars are present on the road but do not actually move. There are no people to be seen in the city with the exception of the North Korean traffic ladies who appear occasionally.  Development and release  Pyongyang Racer was developed in 2012 by a few Kim Chaek University of Technology students working with Nosotek, a North Korean venture capital company focusing on information technology. Nosotek was commissioned to create the game by Koryo Tours, a British-owned travel company specializing in arranging visits to North Korea, to promote tourism of the country to Western audiences. The game's graphics are not contemporary of its timeframe; one reviewer equated them to the Sega Saturn's and another to the 32-bit era in general. This quirk was not unintentional; Koryo stated that Pyongyang Racer was \\"not intended to be a high-end technological wonder hit game of the 21st century\\" but rather a retro arcade-style game. Unlike in most racing games, Nosotek and Koryo did not include AI or a multiplayer mode of any kind. The game was released before, but in late December 2012, it was released for Internet browsers.  Reception  Pyongyang Racer was panned by the video game press and other sources. Brian Ashcraft of Kotaku said that while it exceeded his expectations of a game produced by the country, it was \\"also not very good.\\" Fruzsina E√∂rd√∂gh of Slate stated that it \\"hasn‚Äôt made me want to visit North Korea any time soon.\\" Chris Welch of The Verge could not think of anything more positive to say about the game than that it was the first known one developed in North Korea. Fox News thought the game was \\"fascinatingly awful\\".  Impact and merchandising  The game gained popularity on the internet, as people who did not want to visit North Korea got to learn about the layout of Pyongyang. Sympathizers of former leader Kim Jong-il and North Korea in general took to the game as well. Its popularity was enough to take its site down for some users temporarily. Koryo Games has manufactured T-shirts based on the game and sells them on its official website.

Founder of the Lehem Erez (Erez's Bread) bakery and caf√© chain in the 1990s, he is considered the initiator of artisanal bread-making in Israel. Since 2007 he has led a cooking school in his home in Mitzpe Mattat in the Upper Galilee. He has authored several cookbooks. Biography Erez Komarovsky was born in Tel Aviv to Menachem and Ruth Komarovsky. He has one older brother and two sisters. He credits his early exposure to ethnic cuisine to his visits to his father's almond orchards in southern Israel in his youth; he would visit with the Druze families who harvested the almonds and sample their foods. At the age of 11 he moved with his family to Ramat Gan, and attended a high school outside Yehud. He served in the 1982 Lebanon War during his compulsory military service. Komarovsky informed his parents he was gay when he was 18. He met his current partner, Professor Mickey Gluzman, in 1986. They live in Mitzpe Mattat. Cooking career After the army, in 1983, he began working as a chef in Jaffa. He went to Paris to earn a graduate diploma in classical French cuisine at Le Cordon Bleu, and worked in restaurants and bakeries in that city before returning to Tel Aviv in 1985 to open his own catering business, Erez's Cooking Studio. For five years he also wrote a cooking column for the Tel Aviv weekly newspaper Ha'ir (The City). One of his catering clients invited him to Japan to take a course in kaiseki cuisine, and from there he traveled to San Francisco, California, in 1989. In California he discovered Japanese, Italian, and Mexican cuisine, organic food, and boutique bakeries. He worked as a stylist on a dessert cookbook by Wolfgang Puck and assisted Hugh Carpenter in Northern California with his fusion cookbook. He returned to Israel in 1994 realizing that, \\"despite all my training, I am above all an Israeli chef‚Äîthat couscous, olive oil, and goat cheese are the ingredients closest to my heart\\". Back in Israel, Komarovsky decided to enter the bread-making business and introduce San Francisco sourdough to his native country. He returned to Paris to study under Lionel Poil√¢ne and then returned to California to intern in the Acme Bread Company and Metropolis Bakery in Berkeley. In 1996 he and his business partner, Ilan Rom, founded the Lehem Erez (, Erez's Bread) bakery in Herzliya. The bakery is \\"widely considered the starting point of a bread revolution in Israel\\", as up to that time commercial bakeries sold traditional rather than gourmet breads. Less than a year after opening the bakery, Komarovsky opened an adjoining restaurant serving \\"light, seasonal food\\" influenced by ethnic cuisines. By 2008 the Lehem Erez chain had grown to more than 30 bakeries, many with adjoining caf√©s. Bakery selections included \\"about fifteen types of whole-grain and organic handcrafted breads, with seasonal offerings that might include fresh garlic in the spring, fig and Roquefort in the summer, and Jerusalem artichoke in the winter\\". Cakes, cookies, and boutique olives, cheeses, and Israeli wines were also sold in the bakery shops. In 2010 Komarovsky sold his share in Lehem Erez, continuing as an independent consultant to the chain. Cooking school In 2007 Komarovsky opened a cooking school in his home in Mitzpe Mattat in the Upper Galilee. His half-day workshop covers subjects such as bread-making and seafood preparation, and concludes with a \\"multicourse meal, paired with wine\\" in his dining room. Komarovsky planted an extensive organic garden of herbs and vegetables on his property, including \\"dozens of types of sage, exotic herbs, tomatoes from Sicily and Uzbekistan, Indian purple beans, Thai beans, apples and pears ‚Ä¶ and bay leaves growing on a tree\\", and installed a tabun (clay oven for bread-baking). Cooking style Komarovsky's dishes emphasize seasonal ingredients; organic herbs, vegetables, seeds, and fruits; and the meat and cheeses of locally raised lamb and goat. His recipes incorporate a limited number of ingredients and spices, but are known for their intense flavor. Komarovsky draws his inspiration from Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Palestinian, Syrian, Lebanese, and Druze cuisine. Views and opinions Komarovsky espouses secular, leftist views. In the 1980s, as a columnist for the Tel Aviv newspaper Ha'ir, he published a recipe for suckling pig on Yom Kippur. During the Second Intifada, he traveled to Nazareth to conduct a weeklong series of collaborative dinners with Arab chef Duhoul Sfadi of the Diana Restaurant, followed by a second week of collaborative dinners at his restaurant in Herzliya. He lobbied to cancel the government ban on bread sales during the Passover holiday. He was also a member of a group that successfully lobbied the government to ban the force-feeding of geese for the making of foie gras.

Education and CV Machleidt studied physics at the University of Bonn, Germany, where he received his master's degree (Diplom-Physiker) in 1971 and his doctorate in 1973. As a postdoc, he continued at the Institute for Theoretical Nuclear Physics at the University of Bonn until 1975. The years 1976 and 1977 he spent at the State University of New York at Stony Brook (SUNY) with the group of Gerry Brown. From 1978 to 1983 he was a research associate (Wissenschaftlicher Assistant) in Bonn. 1983 to 1985 he was a visiting scientist at TRIUMF, University of British Columbia, in Vancouver, Canada, and from 1986 to 1988 at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (at LAMPF), Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA. At the same time, he was an Adjunct Associate Professor at UCLA, Los Angeles. In 1988, he accepted the position of associate professor and in 1991 full professor at the University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho, USA. Work He is known as one of the developers of the Bonn potential to describe the nucleon‚Äìnucleon interaction based upon a comprehensive meson exchange model. Next he dealt with nuclear matter, taking into account meson degrees of freedom and relativistic effects (Dirac‚ÄìBrueckner‚ÄìHartree‚ÄìFock). Since about 2000, Machleidt's main focus has been the development of nuclear forces based upon chiral effective field theory.

Life Luarasi was born in Luaras of Kolonj√´ region (back then Ottoman Empire, today's Albania) on 19 January 1900. He was the son of Albanian patriot Petro Nini Luarasi, descendant of the Kostallari family of the Luaras village, and Lino Sevo. Though Luarasi was a Protestant, he named his son Sk√´nder to refer to the Albanian National Hero Scanderbeg. The poet Naim Frash√´ri was his godfather. Luarasi performed the first studies in Albanian language schools of Negovan and Kor√ß√´ (1909-1911). After the death of his father by poisoning, he was sent to Robert College of Istanbul (1912-1913). Luarasi would continue his studies at Easton Academy in US (1914-1916), International College in Springfield, MA in US (1916-1918), Classis Gymnsium in Freistadt, Austria, (1922-1926) and graduated from the Faculty of Philology at University of Vienna, Austria in 1930. During his return in Albania (1920-1922) he worked as a teacher in the schools opened by American Red Cross in Elbasan District. Luarasi started his literary activity since 1917. During the 30s he would distinguish himself as teacher, critic, journalist, translator, playwright, and director and cooperator of several press periodicals. He was editor-in-chief of the periodicals Studenti (\\"The Student\\"), 1920 in US, Djal√´ria (\\"Boyhood\\"), Austria, 1927-1928, and the magazine Vullnetari i Liris√´ (\\"Volunteer of Freedom\\"), Spain, 1937, together with Petro Marko. The last was a 20-page periodical of Albanian volunteers participating in the Spanish Civil War as anti-fascists. During the years 1930-1936 Luarasi taught at the Technical School of Tirana, Vlora, and Shkodra, until he left for Spain to join the International Brigades. He had been previously arrested and imprisoned three time by the Zogist regime. During the Italian and German Occupation he was arrested and interned in several concentration camps, including Vernet, Gurs, St.Cyprien, etc. After World War II, he was elected representative of Kolonje region in the Albanian Assembly (1945). Luarasi was one of the initiator of the foundation of Albanian League of Writers and Artists and member of the presidium until November 1949 when he was expelled for several years from the League due to his anti-conformist behavior. Until his retirement (1967), he worked as teacher and historian in the State Pedagogic Commission, Qemal Stafa High School, the Publishing Company of the Science Institute, Pedagogical School, \\"Jordan Misja\\" Artistic Lyceum, and Faculty e History-Linguistics of the University of Tirana ( where he established the English language major). Until 1992, his activity focused on publicistics, monographs, theatrical plays, historical and literary studies. Luarasi was awarded \\"Flag Order\\" (1960) and \\"Honor of the Nation\\" (1996) by the Albanian government with the motivation \\"For distinguished patriotic, anti-fascist, democratic, literary, and educative activity\\".

A subculture of frequently undocumented workers do the dirty, difficult, and potentially dangerous work shunned by regular employees. They are called in the vernacular Nuclear Nomads, Bio-Robots, Lumnizers, Glow Boys, Radium Girls, the Fukushima 50, Liquidators, Atomic Gypsies, Gamma Sponges, Nuclear Gypsies, Genpatsu Gypsies, Nuclear Samurai and Jumpers. When they exceed their allowable radiation exposure limit at a specific facility, they often migrate to a different nuclear facility. The industry implicitly accepts this conduct as it can not operate without these practices. The World Nuclear Association states that the transient workforce of \\"nuclear gypsies\\" ‚Äì casual workers employed by subcontractors ‚Äì has been \\"part of the nuclear scene for at least four decades.\\" Existent labor laws protecting worker's health rights are not always properly enforced. Records are required to be kept, but frequently they are not. Some personnel were not properly trained resulting in their own exposure to toxic amounts of radiation. At several facilities there are ongoing failures to perform required radiological screenings or to implement corrective actions. Many questions regarding these nuclear worker conditions go unanswered, and with the exception of a few whistleblowers, the vast majority of laborers ‚Äì unseen, underpaid, overworked and exploited ‚Äì have few incentives to share their stories. The median annual wage for hazardous radioactive materials removal workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is $37,590 in the U.S ‚Äì $18 per hour. A 15-country collaborative cohort study of cancer risks due to exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation, involving 407,391 nuclear industry workers showed significant increase in cancer mortality. The study evaluated 31 types of cancers, primary and secondary.  Uranium mining and milling = Canada  In 1942 thirty indigenous Den√© men were recruited to mine uranium, locally known as \\"the money rock\\" for three dollars per day at the Port Radium mine. By 1998, 14 of these workers had died of lung, colon and kidney cancers, according to the North West Territory's Cancer Registry. The Den√© were not told of the hazards of mining uranium, and breathed radioactive dust, slept on the ore, and ate fish from the tailings ponds. According to declassified U.S. documents, Ottawa was the world's largest supplier of uranium at that time, and the United States was the biggest buyer. In subsequent decades, thousands of First Nations miners were not warned of the risks.  Namibia  R√∂ssig open-pit uranium mine near Arandis, Namibia Namibia's R√∂ssing Uranium Mine is the longest-operating open-pit uranium mine, and one of the largest in the world. The company is owned and operated by Rio Tinto, one of the world's largest mining groups, and R√∂ssing Uranium Limited. The uranium mill tailings dam has been leaking for a number of years, and on January 17, 2014, a catastrophic structural failure of a leach tank caused a major spill. The France-based laboratory, Commission de Recherche et d'Information Independentantes sur la Radioactivite (CRIIAD) reported elevated levels of radioactive materials in the area surrounding the mine. There have been numerous reports published on labor and human rights conditions at the mine. Workers were not informed of the dangers of working with radioactive materials and the health effects thereof. The Director of Labor Resource and Research Institute (LaRRI), Hilma Shindondola-Mote, mine employees asserted that R√∂ssing did not provide them with explanation of health problems from exposure to uranium. Malawi At the open cut Kayelekera uranium mine near Karonga, Malawi (Africa), a mine employee, Khwima Phiri, was killed on July 20, 2013. He was struck in the chest and killed while inflating a wheel. There have been allegations of radiation-induced diseases among the mine workers and nearby residents. The Malawi government has been unable to verify these, stating that the absence of monitoring equipment. On June 19, 2011 a truck at the mine caught fire, killing the driver. On September 23, 2010, workers were ordered to work despite the fact that the mine could not provide them with dust masks to protect them against radioactive materials.  New Zealand and Australia  The American and British demand for large quantities of uranium to use in nuclear weapons initiated New Zealand's uranium survey during WWII. In 1944 in Wellington, geologists and physicists assembled two exploration teams to survey South Island, particularly the granite deposits and black beach sand areas. In 1945, Fiordland, Milford Sound, Nancy Sound and other locations were surveyed, resulting in the December 7, 1945 NZ Atomic Energy Act granting full ownership of any discovered radioactive elements - however not to the indigenous peoples whose ancestral lands contained these materials. In 1955, another rich uranium deposit was discovered by prospectors Frederick Cassin and Charles Jacobsen. In the following years prospectors traveled through rainforests and other terrain with Geiger counters, jackhammers and drills. These workers were exposed to unsafe levels of radiation through exposure to and inhalation of dust. In Australia, uranium mining was no less unrestrained than in New Zealand. At the Nabarlek, Rum Jungle, Hunter's Hill, Rockhole and Moline mines, gamma radiation exceeded safe levels by 50% causing chronic health problems for miners and workers. United States Shiprock, New Mexico uranium mill aerial photoBetween 1949 and 1989, over 4,000 uranium mines in the Four Corners region produced more than 225,000,000 tons of uranium ore. This activity impacted on a large number of Native American nations, including the Laguna, Navajo, Zuni, Southern Ute, Ute Mountain, Hopi, Acoma and other Pueblo cultures. Many of these peoples worked in the mines, mills and processing plants in New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. These workers were not only poorly paid, they were seldom informed of dangers nor were they given appropriate protective gear. The government, mine owners, scientific, and health communities were all well aware of the hazards of working with radioactive materials at this time. Due to the Cold War demand for increasingly destructive and powerful nuclear weapons, these laborers were both exposed to and brought home large amounts of radiation in the form of dust on their clothing and skin. Epidemiological studies of the families of these workers have shown increased incidents of radiation-induced cancers, miscarriages, cleft palates and other birth defects. The extent of these genetic effects on indigenous populations and the extent of DNA damage remains to be resolved. Uranium mining on the Navajo reservation continues to be a disputed issue as former Navajo mine workers and their families continue to suffer from health problems. Asian nuclear industry=India * In March 1993 at India's Narora reactor an accident occurred in which two blades broke off a steam turbine leading to a hydrogen leak, hydrogen fire and oil fire. At this time India's Atomic Energy Commission and Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) were not required to \\"reveal the health record of workers\\" nor did the DAE \\"monitor the health of temporary workers\\" nor \\"reveal the quantity of radioactive substances released into the environment by accidents.\\" * In May, 2014, six contract workers were injured at the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant in Tamil Nadu, India, and hospitalized for burns received during repair work. In March 2014, a contract worker was killed and two injured during the construction of a nuclear submarine at the ship building town of Visakhapatnam.  South Korea  * Twenty two workers were exposed to radiation at the Wolsung nuclear power plant, near Seoul, South Korea on October 5, 1999, when 45 liters of heavy water leaked. * On December 26, 2014, three workers at the new Shin Kori nuclear power plant died of a suspected nitrogen gas leak. The accident occurred after a series of threats by hackers claiming they can remotely control nuclear power plants.  Japan  Fukushima = Fukushima I NPP 1975Fukushima I reactor units 3 and 4 by Digital Globe Following a large earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011 three nuclear reactors melted-down at the TEPCO Fukushima Daiichi power station in Japan. Despite TEPCO's ongoing efforts to stabilize, decommission, decontaminate and contain the radioactive materials, many workers have been exposed to significant doses of radiation. Both skilled and unskilled laborers work on the extensive clean-up crew, many of those involved in the most dangerous work are on short contracts. These \\"nuclear gypsies\\" or \\"jumpers\\" are often recruited from day labor sites across Japan. Contract labor in the nuclear industry is not new. Years prior to the Fukushima accident, the Los Angeles Times reported in 1999 that nearly 90% of Japanese nuclear power plant workers were subcontracted to perform the most hazardous jobs. Included in the report is the incident at the Tokaimura JCO Co. nuclear plant, 80 miles north of Tokyo, where 150 workers were exposed to radiation, including one fatality, based on the Japan Nuclear Safety Commission report. In 1999, the Los Angeles Times reported that nearly 90% of Japanese nuclear power plant workers were subcontracted to perform the most hazardous jobs. In 2010, the year before the Fukushima accident, eight-eight percent of Japan's nuclear workforce of 83,000 workers were contracted, not full-time workers. The Tokyo-based Citizens' Nuclear Information Center reported that temporary workers absorbed 16 times higher levels of radiation than regular TEPCO employees. Other sources cite higher dose levels and alleged worker abuse. The first responders to the accident, the \\"Fukushima 50\\" have refused to be photographed, as TEPCO and the Japanese government has not released their names and faces, they remain unknowable and forgotten. Keeping the cleanup crew fully staffed, 24 hours per day, on 12-hour shifts, rotating every three days is a physical and logistical challenge to an emergency that will sustain for decades during which an ongoing stream of workers is required. In a lecture given May 3, 2011 to the All Freeter's Union in Tokyo by the photographer Kenji Higuchi, \\"The Truth of the Fukushima 50\\", he cites TEPCO's lack of responsible oversight. He is of the opinion that the Fukushima 50 are victims of unsafe working conditions, not heroes, as they are depicted in the media. The few workers who have come forward, such as Shingo Kanno, describe themselves as \\"nuclear samurai\\", helping to save Japan from the spread of radiation while doing menial labor at the Fukushima nuclear plant. Upon arriving onsite, some workers were told by their managers that the level of radiation was so high their annual exposure limit could be reached within an hour. The extent of the disaster has initiated searches for clean-up workers from other countries, including the U.S. Many clean-up workers at Fukushima have found that they are not eligible for free cancer screenings from TEPCO or the Japanese government. ONLY 3.7% OF FUKUSHIMA NUCLEAR PLANT WORKERS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREECANCER SCREENINGS As of November, 2012 only 3.7% have been granted screenings, although many have been exposed to high levels of radiation, and all work in highly contaminated zones. Japan's second largest construction company, Obayashi Corporation, was found to, perhaps illegally, assign homeless men from the Sendai train station to work as decontamination laborers at the crippled reactors. Several arrests were made of members of Japanese criminal syndicates, Yamaguchi-gumi, Inagawa- kai, and Sumiyoshi-sai, for arranging black-market labor recruitment operations for Obayashi. The day-labor gray markets in Tokyo and Osaka were also found to recruit homeless men, paying them $6 per hour after deductions for food and lodging. Other workers were paid as little as $10 per month after deductions. Some workers report they were simply left unpaid. Among the temporary clean-up workers who have come forward, Tetsuya Hayashi was told he would monitor worker exposures at Fukushima for two weeks during the summer of 2012. Upon arriving at the disaster site, he was deployed to an area with extremely high radiation levels, rather than the monitoring station. Although Hayashi was provided with protective gear, he thinks the agency engaged in \\"bait and switch\\" approaches to recruitment. Later he accepted a second contract job from another agency at TEPCO's Fukushima Daiichi plant, working on spent fuel rod tanks. He reported that the new contracting agency only paid him 2/3rds of his wages. In over 80 interviews of workers conducted by Reuter's journalists, a frequent complaint was the lack of proper training. They also cited alliances between the contractors, subcontractors and Yazuka organized crime group. While TEPCO does not make worker wages public, the interviewees stated their average earnings were between $6 and $12 per hour. Another worker to speak out, Ryo Goshima, claims his employment broker skimmed half his pay from his wages. The oversight is poorly managed by TEPCO and the Japanese government; as of mid-2013 several hundred small companies had been granted decontamination work. According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace global think tank report, complete remediation of the site is likely to take three or four decades. Between January 2015 and March 2015 there was a ten-fold increase of workers at the Fukushima Daiichi plant who received exposures in excess of 5 mSv, according to a TEPCO report. TEPCO's records show that 57 workers were exposed to 5 to 20 mSv in January, 2015; 327 workers exposed to that rate spectrum in February 2015: and in March 2015, 585 workers were exposed to the 5-20 mSv range. On January 19, 2015, a worker died at the Fukushima Daiichi NPS after falling into an empty water tank. The following day, January 20, at the Fukushima Daini plant, a worker's head was trapped between a 7000 kg piece of moving machinery and the scaffolding, killing him. At another TEPCO plant, Kashiwazaki Kariwa NPS, a worker was seriously injured on January 19, 2015. In response, work at the three nuclear power plants was suspended by TEPCO to analyze the accidents, and develop a safety plan. On October 20, 2015, the New York Times reported that Japan will begin to pay Fukushima accident disaster laborers recompense for cancers developed from participating in the clean up of the triple meltdowns and fuel pool clean-ups. = Tokaimura nuclear facility = The D≈çnen accident () occurred on March 11, 1997. A small explosion occurred at a nuclear reprocessing plant, exposing 37 workers to radiation. On September 30, 1999, a more serious accident occurred resulting in two deaths, at the JCO (formerly Japan Nuclear Fuel Conversion Company) facility in Tokai. Ibaraki Prefecture. While preparing enriched uranium fuel for use in the J≈çy≈ç experimental breeder reactor, a criticality occurred causing a criticality lasting 20 hours during which the nuclear fission chain reaction emitted intense gamma and neutron radiation. At least 667 workers, nearby residents and emergency response team members were exposed to excess radiation. Two technicians, Hisachi Ouchi and Masato Shinohara died from the accident. Radiation levels at the plant were 15,000 time higher than normal. European nuclear industry= France  France is an international leader in the nuclear power industry throughout the world. A study by the National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in France concluded that the largest and least visible population of chronic exposure to ionizing radiation are the nuclear industry's \\"thousands and even hundreds of thousands of workers who perform daily maintenance and upkeep operations and tasks in nuclear plants, nuclear testing facilities, research centers, reprocessing plants, and nuclear waste management centers.\\" France's 50-year long nuclear industry has not historically kept records of worker's internal and external exposure to radiation. The effects of risk to workers and the impact of subcontracting the most dangerous tasks within the industry is intensified by nuclear secrecy. On May 22, 1986, a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant at La Hague in Normandy, sustained a mechanical malfunction. Five workers were exposed to unsafe levels of radiation and hospitalized. On April 12, 1987, the Tricastin Nuclear Power Plant fast breeder reactor coolant leaked contaminating seven workers. In July 2008, approximately 100 workers were exposed to a radiation leak.  Soviet Union  Chernobyl (1986) = Chernobyl radiation 1996 The Chernobyl nuclear reactor meltdown occurred on April 26, 1986, in the Ukraine, during a test of the Unit 4 reactor systems. The explosion and fire caused by human error released massive amounts of radioactive material into the environment, irradiation a large area of Europe, in particular Belarus, Ukraine and the Russian Federation. The cleanup of the radioactive meltdown debris involved 600,000 laborers (NRC statistics), known as \\"jumpers\\" or liquidators\\". These cleanup workers received hundreds of times of the average annual radiation dose allowed in the United States. Statistics on the numbers of deaths, illnesses and genetically produced mutagenic diseases in the following generations remains in debate depending on the source of information. The statistics vary from 4,000 deaths to 93,000 deaths. According to the 2011 report of the German Affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW), \\"Health Effects of Chernobyl: 25 years after the reactor catastrophe\\" based on Yablokov's 2010 report, there were 830,000 clean-up workers; 350,000 evacuees from the 30 km highly contaminated zone; 8,300,000 people who were affected within the heavily irradiated area in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia; and six hundred million (600,000,000) European people who had exposures to radiation from the accident (Fairlie, 2007). It is estimated that 700,000 \\"liquidators\\" - clean up workers - received 100 millisieverts of radiation, and others received higher doses. =Mayak Production Association= The purpose of the Mayak Production Association facility was to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons. In its earlier years of operation, exposures to radiation were significantly higher than at other similar facilities. Mayak was one of the largest nuclear facilities in the Russian Federation, and was formerly known as Chelyabinsk-40 and later as Chelyabinsk-65. It was the site of the Kyshtym disaster (1957) when a storage tank explosion released 50-100 tons of high-level radioactive waste, contaminating a 290 square mile area in the eastern Ural mountains, causing radiation sickness and death. The event was rated 6 \\"serious accident\\" on the 7-level INES nuclear incident/accident scale. The incident received little attention, as it was kept secret for 30 years. Many laborers who worked at the plant during the 1950s and 1960s died from exposures to radiation. The accident was first reported in 1976by Zhores Medvedev in the journal New Scientist, it was in 1992 that the Russian government officially acknowledged the accident.  United Kingdom  Sellafield geograph-3503250-by-Ben- Brooksbank The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant, located on the coast of the Irish Sea, is built on the former site of the Windscale nuclear reactor and Calder Hall. The British government began developing the site in 1947 as the Windscale Piles plutonium production plant, its graphite reactor core was cooled by air, rather than water as the US reactors at the Hanford site. By 1952 the facility was separating plutonium from spent uranium fuel. In 1957 the Windscale fire destroyed the core of Pile #1, exposing workers to 150 times the \\"safe dose limit\\" of radioactivity and releasing approximately 750 terabecquerels of radioactive material into the environment. The incident is rated a \\"5\\" on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) of nuclear accidents and incidents. A 1990 study of childhood leukemia and other cancers in the offspring of Sellafield, Dounreay and Seascale nuclear workers show elevated levels of occurrence. There have been 21 significant accidents and incidents of radioactive material releases between 1950 and 2000. Tissue samples and organs were removed from 65 deceased former Sellafield workers, as announced by Trade Secretary, Alistair Darling in 2007, and confirmed by Peter Lutchwyche of the British Nuclear Group. On January 28, 1998, a damaged plutonium-contaminated filter in building B209, causing thirteen workers to be evacuated, necessitating two workers to undergo tests for internal as well as external contamination. Photographic documentation of equipment contaminated with plutonium, poor signage and substandard barriers were cited. Glow Boys, a 1999 film by Mark Ariel Waller, interprets this event and others in relation to energy, economy and power and labor. In January 2014, Sellafield issued an order for thousands of workers to not report to work due to elevated levels of radioactivity onsite.  American nuclear industry = Nuclear weapons production workers  In a report based on reviews of raw data on nuclear worker health drafted by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the White House National Economic Council (NEC), the U.S. government found that workers at 14 nuclear weapons plants were exposed to unsafe levels of radiation and other toxins, resulting in a wider range of cancers. The Applied-Industrial Chemical and Energy Workers Union states that workers had higher rates of leukemia, lung cancer, bladder cancer and other diseases. The DOE and NEC panel found that nearly 600,000 nuclear weapons workers developed other cancers as well: Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, kidney cancer, and salivary gland cancer. The Oak Ridge K-25 facility, Tennessee, Savannah River Site, the Hanford Site, Rocky Flats Plant, Fernald Feed Materials Production Center, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory are among the 14 sites studied. Statistics from the Department of Labor, Office of Workers Compensation Program (OWCP) Division of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation are found posted weekly. The U.S. Federal Register Executive Order 13179, of December 11, 2000 states that thousands of Americans who built the U.S. nuclear defense: > paid a high price for their service, developing disabling or fatal illnesses > as a result of exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, and other hazards > unique to nuclear weapons production and testing. Too often, these workers > were neither adequately protected from, nor informed of, the occupational > hazards to which they were exposed. The document goes on to state that existing worker's compensation programs have failed due to long latency periods of radiation-caused disease as well as inadequate record keeping of data. =Military workers and contractors= Trinity Test - Oppenheimer and Groves at Ground Zero 001 The exposure of military workers and contractors to radioactive materials that exceed safe doses is well documented. After the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, military workers were sent to these areas to examine and clean up the rubble. Many of these U.S. veterans developed bone marrow and blood abnormalities, multiple myeloma, leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, myelofibrosis and cancers. During the nuclear weapons testing in the Marshall Islands approximately 300,000 GIs were exposed to radiation, the U.S. Department of Defense estimates 210,000 servicemen, however the National Association of Atomic Veterans cite between 250,000 and 400,000. The 2008-9 National Cancer Institute/U.S. Department of Health reports that exposure to radiation from nuclear weapons testing is a worldwide issue of significant concern. > Hundreds of thousands of military personnel and civilians in the United > States received significant radiation doses as a result of their > participation in nuclear weapons testing and supporting occupations and > industries, including nuclear fuel and weapons production, and uranium > mining, milling, and ore transport.

Federal responses to the plight of affected individuals > have been unsatisfactory.  Nuclear weapons production facilities  Fernald Feed Plant ‚Äì Ohio, US = Fluor Fernald Workers For decades, radioactive isotopes of plutonium, uranium, radium, thorium and technetium were released from the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center in Ohio, entering into the air, land and water, including deep ground water of the Great Miami aquifer. Workers and area residents show higher rates of systemic lupus erythematosus, certain cancers, and low blood cell counts. A study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) determined that salaried workers had lower mortality rates than per-hour workers, despite both cohorts increased malignancies of blood, bone, spleen, lymph and thyroid cancers. While the plant was under construction in 1952, labor disputes broke out between carpenters and other laborers, in what was reported as \\"rioting\\" and \\"mob action\\". In 1954, a chemical explosion causes the death of two workers. In 1959, a strike ensues at the factory regarding the quota system. Machinists, steel workers and sheet metal workers strike. In 1974, employees voice their concerns over health hazards. In 1984, National Lead of Ohio, the manager of the site, admits that radioactive dust was released, and groundwater contaminated. In 1990, Fernald employees and/or their survivors filed a class action suit over health hazards. = Hanford Nuclear Reservation ‚Äì Washington, US = Hanford workers The Hanford Nuclear Reservation (HNR), also known as the Hanford Site, located in Washington State in the western United States adjacent to the Columbia River, is a nuclear materials production complex that is in the process of being decommissioned. HNR was founded in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project for large-scale production of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons, including the first nuclear bomb tested at the Trinity site in New Mexico, and the Fat Man nuclear bomb used at Nagasaki, Japan, during WWII. Hanford is considered the most contaminated nuclear waste site America. Much of the clean-up has focused on water and land contamination from leaking tanks, as well as airborne radioactive dusts. In 1976, a chemical reaction caused a glove box to explode at the Plutonium Finishing Plant, contaminating Harold McCluskey (aged 64). The site of the accident, (242-Z )was closed-off due to high levels of radioactivity, decontamination did not begin until 2014, thirty eight years after the accident. The \\"McCluskey Room\\" was used to separate americium from plutonium during the Cold War. McCluskey received the highest dosage of americium of any human being, 500 times the occupational standard, and was so radioactive, his body had to be removed by remote control and placed in a steel and concrete isolation tank where glass and metal were removed from his skin and tissues. He survived the accident. After five months of treatment, involving scrubbings and shots of zinc DTPA, he was permitted to return home, as his radiation count had fallen from 500 above standard to 200 times above safe occupational level. = Idaho National Laboratory ‚Äì Idaho, US = SL-1 - Dismantling of the foundation piers Idaho National Laboratory near Arco, Idaho was founded in 1949 as a nuclear reactor testing laboratory. Some consider it to be the site of the first fatal accident in the nuclear military/industrial sector when the SL-1 boiling water reactor melted down, killing two reactor operators, a third operator died shortly thereafter. When a control rod in the reactor was removed manually causing a power surge and ensuing criticality, a steam explosion occurred in the reactor vessel. The event caused the reactor lid to be blown nine feet into the air. The three operators were heavily irradiated and their remains were buried in lead coffins. There have been other accidents involving radioactive uranium and plutonium in later decades, including an incident in 2011 when seventeen workers were exposed to low-level radiation from plutonium. = Los Alamos National Laboratories ‚Äì New Mexico, US = Re-creation of Slotin's experiment with the \\"demon core\\" The occupational health studies of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and surrounding communities show elevated levels of certain disease rates among workers. A plutonium core for a nuclear weapon, nicknamed the \\"Demon Core\\" was involved in two accidents at LANL in 1945 and 1946, leading to the acute radiation poisoning and later the deaths of scientists Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin. The first criticality incident occurred on August 21, 1945 when physicist Harry Daghlian accidentally dropped the core, causing a burst of neutron radiation that contaminated him and a security guard, Private Robert J. Hemmerly. The second incident caused the death of physicist, Louis Slotin, and contaminated seven other employees. = Oak Ridge ‚Äì Tennessee, US = K-25 aerial view cropped The secret atomic city of Oak Ridge, Tennessee was part of the Manhattan Complex. Workers there were exposed to radioactive materials at plants X-10, K-25 and Y-12, and qualify for compensation from the 2011 Energy Employee Occupational Illness Compensation Act (RECA) for illnesses resulting from their work at the Oak Ridge Reservation. Workers there were exposed to highly enriched uranium and plutonium due to inadequate storage and security at the Oak Ridge plant. = Pantex Plant ‚Äì Texas, US = Pantex Aerial The Pantex Plant is a nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly plant located in the Texas Panhandle region. It also provides technology for manufacturing, evaluating and testing nuclear explosives. It is listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a Superfund Site. A 2014 report in the Global Security Newswire, reports that the contractor overseeing the Pantex nuclear weapons facility was cited for numerous safety hazard incidents. The U.S. Department of Energy cited B&W; Pantex (Bechtel and Babcock & Wilcox) for six safety incidents. The DOE Office of Health, Safety and Security's chief of enforcement and oversight, John Boulden, states these \\"events are significant in that they involved improper management, handling or labeling of highly hazardous materials, including explosives, which have the potential to cause serious injury or death.\\" B&W; Pantex did not receive any fines for this breach of worker's safety. As of 2015, the U.S. government plans to spend $1 trillion over the next thirty years to modernize its nuclear stockpile. Plans to cut spending include cutting health and retirement benefits for workers in the nuclear weapons industry. The Government Accountability office confirms the National Nuclear Safety Administration officer's statement: \\"reducing labor costs represents a large share of cost savings to be achieved.\\" Worker's benefits via the Consolidated Nuclear Security contract at Pantex, as well as at Oak Ridge, Tennessee's Y-12 National Security Complex, will be cut as per Department of Energy regulation Order 350.1. = Rocketdyne ‚Äì California, US = SNAP 8DR core assembly Between 1957-1964, Rocketdyne located at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, 30 miles north of Los Angeles, California operated ten experimental nuclear reactors. Numerous accidents occurred including a core meltdown. Experimental reactors of that era were not required to have the same type of containment structures that shield modern nuclear reactors. During the Cold War time in which the accidents that occurred at Rockedyne, these events were not publicly reported by the Department of Energy. * 1957: a fire raged out of control in the Hot Lab leading to \\"massive contamination.\\" * 1959: the AE6 reactor released fission gasses, later that year the SRE facility suffered a partial nuclear reactor core meltdown, releasing 459 times the radiation as the Three Mile Island accident. * 1964: 80% of the SNAP8-ER reactor's fuel was damaged. 1969: the SNAP8-DR reactor lost one third of its fuel. * 1971: a radioactive fire broke out from the combustion of sodium reactor coolant that had been contaminated with fission products. In 1979, Rocketdyne released to the public that these events occurred. In 1999 the site was remediated, although thousands of pounds of contaminated sodium coolant cannot be accounted for. Local residents, including former workers filed a class-action suit in 2005, and were awarded $30 million. Many of the workers and local residents were already deceased at the time of the settlement. =Rocky Flats Plant ‚Äì Colorado, US= Rocky Flats Plant ‚Äì 1954 aerial view The employees at Rocky Flats Plant near Denver Colorado made plutonium warhead triggers (known as pits) for the United States nuclear weapons arsenal. The area surrounding the plant is contaminated with radioactive plutonium. According to Marco Kaltofen, and engineer and president of the Boston Chemical Data Corporation, \\"The material is still there, it's still on the surface.\\" According to the EPA and the Colorado health department, former plant workers, as well as current construction workers might have greater exposure through inhaling radioactive dust than the average construction worker. The 1982 documentary film, Dark Circle, discloses worker safety issues at the Rocky Flats Plant, and lack of workplace regulations. Hazards at Rocky Flats included perforated (damaged) gloves for handling radioactive materials, and incidents when workers directly inhaled irradiated air.Dark Circle, DVD release date March 27, 2007, Directors: Judy Irving, Chris Beaver, Ruth Landy. . =Savannah River Plant= Savannah River Site demolition work On October 3, 1975, plutonium- laced sludge breached the office wall of health inspector, Byron Vaigneur at the South Carolina-based Savannah River nuclear Weapons Site. He later developed breast cancer and chronic beryllium disease. According to a 2015 report by the Tribune News Service, Vaigneur is one of 107,394 Americans who have developed cancer and other environmental diseases from working in the nuclear weapons industry over the past 70 years. Nuclear stockpile related disease has cost American taxpayers $12 billion in medical expense payouts to workers. Commercial nuclear workers Incidents of worker exposure to radioactive materials in the commercial nuclear energy industry is well documented. A recent report by PBS investigative reporter and a year-long investigation by McClatchy News showed that there are more than 33,000 male and female nuclear workers who have died from nuclear work related illnesses, and more than 100,000 people in the U.S. diagnosed with cancer and other radiologically induced diseases. = Short-term workers = Thousands of contracted nuclear power plant \\"jumpers\\", \\"nuclear janitors\\" or \\"Glow Boys\\" employed by Atlantic Nuclear Services, Inc. (ANC) and other agencies are recruited to quickly resolve breakdowns, plug leaks, and clean up spills before reaching the allowed dose of radiation exposure. Officially known as nozzle dam technicians, enter containment structures to work on the steam generators. They work swiftly as within five minutes a jumper can be exposed to 1 rem of radiation (equivalent to 50 chest X-rays). A 1982 report states that the NRC limits contract worker exposures to 5 rems per year, however a 1984 report states that the NRC allows jumpers to be exposed to 5 to 12 rems per year. In addition to the danger of external contamination, jumpers can be exposed to internal contamination from breathing or ingesting airborne radioactive particles. The archive of event notification reports from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, dated from 1999 - 2014, is located at NRC: Event Notification Reports Event reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency is located at: NEWS = Divers = Nuclear divers are laborers that work fully submerged in radiated water at nuclear reactors. There are three types of diver tasks: radioactive dives, non-radioactive dives, both of which occur inside reactors, and \\"mud-work\\" that involves cleaning out cooling-water intake systems in lakes, rivers and oceans. In 1986, two divers were killed while cleaning intake pipes at the Crystal River Plant in Florida. In 2006, diver Michael Pickart performed a dive inside an Arkansas nuclear reactor, and was exposed to 450 millirems of radiation. = Radium workers = Radium workers in the early 20th century, known as Radium Girls or Luminizers, incurred exposure doses that caused skeletal diseases including bone cancer. Radium was used as an alleged medical \\"cure\\" for a variety of ailments, as well as to create luminous clock and instrument dials. Radium-dial painters, mostly young women at production facilities in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois and other sites, succumbed to occupational injury and disease. Between the years of 1915 and 1959, there were 1,747 females and 161 males employed as \\"measured dial\\" Luminizers, and 1,910 unmeasured female workers, and 315 unmeasured male workers. The most common health issue was \\"radium jaw\\" (bone necrosis), anemia, epidermoid carcinomas, and sarcomas. The National Academy of Sciences Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation, BEIR VII Phase 2 report, shows that women and children are more susceptible to increased cancer mortality than men. (Page 311 of the report shows this data in a graph.) = Shipyard workers = The 1991 Final Report of the Nuclear Shipyard Worker Study (NSWS) analyzed the effects of radiation exposure in the U.S. to three cohort groups: 27,872 high-dose nuclear workers, 10348 low-dose nuclear workers, and a control group of 32,510 shipyard workers not exposed to radiation. Dose reconstruction for occupational radiation exposure used by the U.S. Department of Labor assumes that the probability of cancer is \\"at least as likely as not\\" rendering it complex for workers to claim compensation via The Act. =Kerr-McGee Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site= The most famous of U.S. case of on an incident involving a nuclear worker is that of Karen Silkwood, an employee of the Kerr-McGee Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site in Crescent, Oklahoma. Silkwood was a technician, whose job was to make plutonium fuel pellets for assembly into nuclear reactor fuel rods. She was also a labor union activist negotiating for higher health and safety standards. In 1974, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union stated that the Kerr-McGee plant had not only manufactured defective fuel rods, but that it had falsified records, and put employees' safety at risk. During the time that she was involved in these labor disputes, on November 5, 1974, she found that she had been contaminated with plutonium over 400 times the legal limit. On November 7, it was found that her internal lung contamination was dangerously high during breath tests, and urine samples. On November 13, 1974, Silkwood was driving to a union meeting with documents regarding her case. She died on the way to the meeting from a severe hit-and-run automobile crash that damaged both the rear end and front end of her vehicle. There is much speculation that her car was forced off the road by another vehicle. Her body was examined by Los Alamos Laboratory Tissue Analysis Program as requested by the Atomic Energy Commission and the State Medical Examiner. It was found that there were significant amounts of plutonium in her lungs, and even higher amounts in her gastrointestinal organs. In 2014, her Lawyer, Gerry Spence gave a two part interview, on the implications of her case in relation to compensation for radiation injury, and on proving strict liability and physical injury in nuclear facilities. = Three-mile Island (1979) = Three Mile Island nuclear power plant The Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania occurred on March 28, 1979 was rated a 5 on the 7-point International Nuclear Event Scale resulting in the meltdown of radioactive fuel in the Unit 2 reactor. =Sequoyah Fuels Corporation= On January 4, 1986, a tank containing uranium hexafluoride (UF6) ruptured, releasing 14.5 tons of gaseous UF6 into the environment and causing the death of James Harrison, a 25-year old African American/Cherokee worker, and the hospitalization of 37 workers at the plant. Approximately 100 downwinders were affected by the leak, and treated for inhalation of the toxic gas. The tank was overloaded with 2000 pounds beyond its capacity. =West Valley Nuclear Site= First fuel element placement at the West Valley site Located in Western upstate New York, the West Valley nuclear site operated as a commercial nuclear material reprocessing site from 1966 to 1972. In those years the plant processes high and low-level waste, and had a high incident rate of workers exposed to radiation; Science journal reported \\"almost without precedent in a major nuclear facility.\\" In 1980 the U.S. Congress approved an Act (P.L. 96-368) that required the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and other agencies to clean up contaminated water and land resources, at the cost of $5.2 billion. In 2006, New York State filed a lawsuit against the DOE to commit to a long-term clean up and stewardship plan, assigning Federal accountability, and reimbursement of costs to New York state.  Waste storage = Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)  DOE begins mining operations for salt disposal investigations at WIPP 2 The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, was designed as a pilot, test study site for deep geologic storage of radioactive waste. It is managed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and currently serves as the nation's only deep geological repository for transuranic (TRU) nuclear waste generated by the military and defense industry. It is located in Southern New Mexico near the border of Texas and Mexico. It has been disposing of waste 2,150 feet underground in the ancient Permian Sea salt formation since 1999, accepting waste from 22 national atomic legacy sites. Designed to last tens thousand years, the WIPP site had its first leak of airborne radioactive materials on February 1, 2014. 140 employees working underground at the time were sheltered indoors. 13 of these tested positive for internal radioactive contamination. Internal exposure to radioactive isotopes is more serious than external exposure, as these particles lodge in the body for decades, irradiating the surrounding tissues, thus increasing the risk of future cancers and other health effects. A second leak at the plant occurred shortly after the first, releasing plutonium and other radiotoxins, causing concern for communities living near the repository. Since opening in 1999, the WIPP \\"pilot site\\" has received over 11,000 shipments of TRU waste (transuranic waste). During the February 14, 2014 leak, 22 workers were exposed to radioactive materials. Don Hancock, Director of the Nuclear Waste Safety Program for the SouthWest Research and information Center describes the theory of how nitrate salts in the \\"kitty litter\\" absorbent interacted with plutonium causing the breach of one or more 55-gallon drums stored at WIPP through a chemical reaction that caused an inflagration. Fundamental questions remain regarding the Department of Energy's clean up standards for WIPP, as there is not a \\"clean-up\\" standard or regulation for the underground site, by either the DOE oversight or the company contracted to oversee the site, Nuclear Waste Partnership. Over the past 15 years, 91,000 cubic meters of radioactive waste, and more than 171,000 containers of radioactive waste have been placed at WIPP - more than any other site in the country.

The border runs lengthwise through the two buildings, passing just to the left of the mural. The mural and everything to the right of it lies in Switzerland; France lies to the left. The Treaty of Dappes was concluded on 8 December 1862 between France and the Swiss Confederation. Resolving a long-standing border dispute between the two countries, the accord awarded the Vallee des Dappes (which had been controlled by Switzerland since 1815) to France, in exchange for a comparable piece of territory just to the north. The treaty is noteworthy for dividing the tiny village of La Cure between the two countries, with the new border bisecting not just the town itself, but several structures within it. Background The Vallee des Dappes is a small valley about long and broad, located in the Swiss Canton of Vaud. Although the valley had little value as a territorial possession, it provided an accessible military route between France and Savoy.Vallee des Dappes Annexed by Napoleonic France in 1802, it was returned to Switzerland by the Congress of Vienna, though the French continued to call for its retrocession. After several attempts to reacquire the area were firmly rebuffed by the Swiss, France decided in 1862 to offer a nearby section of its own territory, comparable in size, in exchange. The Swiss agreed, and a treaty to effect the switch was accordingly negotiated in Bern. Slightly less than of territory changed hands.Treaty of Dappes A set of maps showing the boundary changes may be viewed here. La Cure Formerly located entirely on the French side of the border, the small village of La Cure found itself cut in two by the new boundary. The pact stipulated that any structures already in place at the time of its implementation were to be left undisturbed, even if the border passed directly through them.La Cure Photos and Maps Thus, at least three houses and a pub in the village were bisected by the new border, and remain divided, today.La Cure Photos and Maps Border changes as a result of the Treaty of Dappes. The old border is marked in green, the new one in red. Owing to the delay involved in ratification of the agreement by the Swiss Parliament, a local businessman named Ponthus decided to take advantage of the situation. He quickly erected a three-story structure right on the new boundary line, with about a third of the new building in what would become Swiss territory and the remainder in France.Hotel Arbez He operated a grocery in the Swiss portion, and a pub on the French side, hoping to capitalize on the cross-border trade.Hotel Arbez In 1921, Jules-Jean Arbeze purchased the building, and turned it into a hotel which he called the Hotel Arbez.Hotel Arbez Today, the Franco-Swiss border established by the Treaty of Dappes passes through the kitchen, dining room, hallway and several rooms of the Hotel Arbez; in two rooms (including the honeymoon suite) the beds themselves are bisected by the boundary, while in another, the bathroom is in France, while the rest of the room is in Switzerland.Hotel ArbezMy Switzerland: Hotel Arbez During the German occupation of France in World War II, their troops were allowed to enter the French side of the hotel, but were strictly prohibited from crossing to the Swiss side. Since the stairway to the upper floor started in French territory but ended in Switzerland, the Germans were not permitted to access any of the upper rooms, which became a refuge for refugees and French Resistance members.Hotel Arbez The hotel was chosen in 1962 for negotiation of the √âvian Accords between France and Algeria, which resulted in the independence of the latter.Hotel Arbez ReferencesExternal links *La Cure: Photos and Maps.

Now kept at the British Museum, the significance of the stela resides in the fact that it is inscribed with one of the longest known texts in the Meroitic script.British Museum Highlights Discovery The stela was found by the British archaeologist John Garstang in 1914 at the site of Hamadab, which is located a few kilometres south of Mero√´, the capital of the ancient Kingdom of Kush. One of a pair, the excavators discovered the stelae either side of the main doorway into a small temple. As part of the division of finds, the stela to the left of the doorway was given to the British Museum, while the other was left in situ. Description The stela is in good condition, although part of the top is missing. The upper part includes a frieze showing the Kushite rulers Queen Amanirenas and Prince Akinidad facing various Egyptian deities including Amun and Mut. Below this royal scene is a relief depicting bound prisoners. A 42-line inscription in Meroitic cursive script is engraved beneath this. Meroitic script Meroitic was the principle language of the Kingdom of Kush. Poorly understood by modern scholars, it remains untranslatable, although most letters of the Meroitic alphabet are now known (even though the meaning of most words remain obscure). In this inscription, the names of the two monarchs Amanirenas and Akinidad are clearly discernible. It has been proposed that the Hamabad Stela may commemorate a Kushite raid on Roman Egypt in 24 BC. One outcome of these raids could have been the looting of the Mero√´ Head from a city in Lower Egypt. Gallery Image:Hamadab Stela (1).JPG Detail of inscription ReferencesFurther reading *N.

Career = 12 Years a Slave  Baker served as set decorator on the film 12 Years a Slave, Steve McQueen's 2013 adaptation of Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir. As the historical drama was shot in New Orleans, but took place in Saratoga Springs, New York and on a ship as well as in Louisiana, Baker and Stockhausen used stereoscopic images and other historical documents to guide their development of sets that resembled the Northeast and steamships in the 1830s, in addition to using Louisiana plantations with some original buildings still in place. Faced with a limited budget as well as recently released films dealing with the same historical era that had just used many of the available sets (for example, Django Unchained and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), Baker and Stockenhausen were challenged to develop an aesthetic authentic to the period, but visually distinct from the other films. They collected original items from antique shops, museums, and personal homes, in Mississippi and Louisiana, to decorate the sets. In addition to the Academy Award nomination, Baker and Stockhausen were also nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Production Design, a Critics' Choice Movie Award Best Art Direction, and the Art Directors Guild Award for Excellence in Production Design for a Period Film, among other awards.  I Saw the Light  Baker also served as set decorator on the 2015 Hank Williams biopic, I Saw the Light, starring Tom Hiddleston.

During the post-Punk and New Romantic early to mid '80s, when street and club styles dominated the British fashion scene, BodyMap was described by the Chicago Tribune as: \\"perhaps the hottest, most visually arresting company in Britain's design renaissance\\". In 1986, Suzy Menkes noted in The Times that although some of its designs were too extreme to sell well, it was highly influential: \\"[Bodymap's] ideas on body conscious dressing were freely taken up and absorbed into mainstream fashion\\". In a 2010 retrospective in Dazed Digital, Al Mulhall said it remains: \\"a reference point in the world of ready-to-wear\\". History BodyMap was founded by Stevie Stewart and David Holah in 1982, both fashion graduates of Middlesex Polytechnic. Originally launched from a stall on Camden Market while they were students, it generated publicity quickly ‚Äì helped by the fact that Stewart and Holah's graduation collection was bought by the prestigious independent South Molton Street fashion store Browns. In an interview for the V&A;, Stewart and Holah also credit Swiss-born event producer Susanne Bartsch for their swift rise. After BodyMap was shown at a 'New London in New York' show designed to introduce young British design talent to American audiences, and garnered substantial publicity from the U.S. fashion press, it then attracted interest from the UK press. David Holah commented in the V&A; interview that, after the New York show, they became: \\"stars overnight\\". In common with other emerging designers of the 1980s, Stewart and Holah were strongly influenced by London's club scene and designed specifically for young people. BodyMap's early collaboration with textile designer Hilde Smith saw it use distinctive prints that were as much a part of its trademark look as the use of multiple layering and lines that were designed to remap the body's outline. Choice of fabrics was also key to the look ‚Äì in a 2013 interview, David Holah said: \\"We worked closely with a sportswear company in Sweden and experimented with high quality cotton and viscose fabrics...we pioneered viscose lycra\\". In 1984, BodyMap's place as one of London's most innovative fashion houses seemed assured when it won the Dress of the Year award with an outfit selected by Brenda Polan of The Guardian. Catwalk shows One of BodyMap's most distinctive (and publicity generating) elements was its catwalk shows, which included outfit changes on the side of the runway in view of the audience and the designers' mothers acting as models. The 1985 show for Barbie Takes a Trip Around Nature's Cosmic Curves ‚Äì featuring cross-dressing models of all ages and sizes, latex wigs and exposed flesh ‚Äì was reported to have left American buyers shocked. A contemporaneous U.S. newspaper report of a BodyMap fashion show in 1985 concluded that: \\"Some perceived in it a vaguely perverted tone that, although not downright sado-masochistic, was definitely kinky\\". The excitement surrounding its shows was added to by the celebrities who appeared on the catwalk, including Boy George, Helen Terry, Marilyn, Leigh Bowery and Michael Clark. Stewart and Holah were to reciprocate by designing costumes for Clark's 1986 ballet No Fire Escape in Hell. A 1984 review in The New York Times said the atmosphere at the catwalk show was: \\"as bizarre as any rock star's video\\", also noting that the arrival of Boy George and Marilyn caused a similar stir in London to Princess Caroline of Monaco arriving at Dior in Paris. The label's publicity imagery was largely generated in-house and BodyMap collaborated with up-and-coming photographers, notably Mario Testino and David LaChapelle. Expansion Bodymap's B-basic (diffusion) line helped to make the range more widely affordable. By 1985, it had expanded into men's and women's collections, Red Label, a B line of childrenswear and swimwear. Unable to expand the brand and attract enough financial backers, the company had begun to struggle by 1986. That year, it was reported in The Times that it had gone into liquidation, despite international acclaim and substantial orders on its books. Its last fashion show was in March that year. It continued to sell its B-basic line via the stall on Camden Market into the '90s. Most accounts place the brand's demise around 1991, although it still had a loyal following and talk of a revival ‚Äì with licensing in Japan and a range for Ministry of Sound ‚Äì continued for another few years. Later careers  Stevie Stewart moved on to design costumes for stars such as Britney Spears, Kylie Minogue and Girls Aloud, also continuing her association with Michael Clark's ballet company and other dance companies. She and David Holah still collaborate on projects, although he focuses on his art practice and teaching in the areas of fashion and print. Popular culture and retrospectives In 2011, BodyMap outfits featured in a 'Cavalcade of the 80s' fashion show curated by Sue Tilley (muse to Lucian Freud and friend of Leigh Bowery), organised by Wayne Hemingway and Gerardine Hemingway at London's Southbank Centre. In an Absolutely Fabulous reunion episode that aired on 1 January 2012, Edina (Jennifer Saunders) wore an outfit featuring oversized BodyMap logos on the T-shirt. BodyMap was an integral part of a major V&A; exhibition, From Club to Catwalk, in 2013, with the main publicity material featuring a photograph of model Scarlett Cannon in a BodyMap outfit from the label's The Cat in the Hat Takes a Rumble with a Techno Fish collection. A supporting video showed catwalk footage and photographs and featured an interview with Stewart and Holah about the rise of BodyMap. Other 1980s fashion names included in the exhibition included Workers for Freedom, Betty Jackson and Katharine Hamnett. In 2013, BodyMap also featured in the ICA's launch events for Iain R. Webb's book on 1980s style and culture We're Not Here To Sell Clothes: The Making of BLITZ Fashion, with Holah and Stewart appearing in a panel discussion.

Cobb (born 1967) is a historian of the medieval Islamic world. He is currently Professor of Islamic History at the University of Pennsylvania. His areas of interest include Islamic relations with the West, historiography, and the history of travel and exploration. He is, in particular, a recognized authority on the history of the Crusades in their Islamic context.  Career  Cobb was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, where he attended public schools. In 1989, he graduated from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst with a BA (cum laude) in Anthropology. In 1991, he received his MA in Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from the University of Chicago and then studied at CASA, the Center for Arabic Study Abroad, in Cairo, Egypt. He returned to Chicago and in 1997 he received his PhD in Islamic history from the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations. He has taught at Smith College (1996‚Äì97), Wake Forest University (1997-99), the University of Notre Dame (1999-2008), and the University of Pennsylvania (2008‚Äìpresent). He currently splits his time between Philadelphia and Amherst. His first book, White Banners: Contention in 'Abbasid Syria, 750-880 (2001), was one of the first attempts at providing a provincial history of early Islam, and to mine the vast amount of information on early Islam to be found in medieval local histories such as Ibn 'Asakir's Ta'rikh Madinat Dimashq. His interest in the history of Syria led him to the life and times of the adventurer and poet Usama ibn Munqidh (d. 1188). Cobb's biography of him, Usama ibn Munqidh: Warrior-Poet of the Age of Crusades (2006) is intended as a short and accessible sketch, based upon all of Usama's surviving works, some of which have been only recently discovered. This was followed (in 2008) with a translation of Usama's famous \\"memoirs\\" or Kitab al-I'tibar and other autobiographical writings as The Book of Contemplation: Islam and the Crusades. Cobb's exploration of Usama's world has in turn led him to pursue other problems in the history of the Crusades, most prominently in his The Race for Paradise: An Islamic History of the Crusades (2014), which is intended as an accessible narrative history of \\"the Frankish problem\\" on all shores of the Mediterranean, from the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries, based almost exclusively upon Islamic historical sources and rooted in the context of Islamic history.  Awards  Cobb has been awarded Fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Philosophical Society, the Fulbright Program, and the Guggenheim Foundation among others.

The \\"Old Plaza Church\\" is to the left, the brick reservoir on the right, in the center of the plaza, was the original terminus of the Zanja Madre. Mexican Americans have lived in Los Angeles since the original Pobladores, the 44 original settlers and 4 soldiers who founded the city in 1781. People of Mexican descent make up 31.9% of Los Angeles residents, and 32% of Los Angeles County residents. History Nuestra Se√±ora Reina de los Angeles Asistencia was founded in early 1784 within the burgeoning Pueblo de Los √Ångeles as an asistencia (or \\"sub- mission\\") to the nearby Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel. The assistant mission fell into disuse over time and a Catholic chapel, La Iglesia de Nuestra Se√±ora Reina de los √Ångeles, was constructed in its place a mere thirty years later. The city has witnessed a development of a Hispanic (mainly Mexican) cultural presence since its settlement as a city in 1769. Mexican-Americans have been one of the largest ethnic groups in Los Angeles since the 1910 census, as Mexican immigrants and US-born Mexicans from the Southwest states came to the booming industrial economy of the LA area between 1915 and 1960. This migration peaked in the 1920s and again in the World War II era (1941‚Äì45). In 1970, there were an estimated 815,000 Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles, sometimes they self-identity themselves as Chicano in the mid and late 20th century. The city's original barrios were located in the eastern half of the city and the unincorporated community of East Los Angeles. The trend of Hispanization began in 1970, then accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s with immigration from Mexico and Central America (especially El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala). These immigrants settled in the city's eastern and southern neighborhoods. By 2000, South Los Angeles was a majority Latino area, displacing most previous African-American and Asian-American residents. The city is often said to have the largest Mexican population outside Mexico and has the largest Spanish-speaking population outside Latin America or Spain. As of 2007, estimates of the number of residents originally from the Mexican state of Oaxaca ranged from 50,000 to 250,000. Montebello was the first Spanish settlement in California in Los Angeles County. Today Census Bureau map of Los Angeles County showing percentage of population self- identified as Mexican in ancestry or national origin by census tracts. Heaviest concentrations are in East Los Angeles, Echo Park/Silver Lake, South Los Angeles, and San Pedro/Harbor City/Wilmington. As of 2010, about 2.5 million residents of the Greater Los Angeles area are of Mexican American origin/heritage. As of 1996 Mexican-Americans make up about 80% of the Latino population in the Los Angeles area. As of 1996 the Los Angeles region had around 3,736,000 people of Mexican origins.Central Americans: At the Bottom: Struggling to Get Ahead, p. 281. There's a shift of second and third generation Mexican-Americans out of Los Angeles into nearby suburbs, such as Ventura County, Orange County, San Diego and the Inland Empire, California region. Mexican and other Hispanic immigrants moved in East and South sections of L.A. and sometimes, Asian immigrants moved into historic barrios to become mostly Asian-American areas. Starting in the late 1980s, Downey has become a renowned Latino majority community in Southern California, and the majority of residents moved in were middle or upper-middle class, and second and third generation Mexican-Americans. The Mexican population is increasing in the Antelope Valley such as Palmdale. Suburban cities in Los Angeles County like Azusa, Baldwin Park, City of Industry, Duarte, El Monte, Irwindale, La Puente, Montebello, Rosemead, San Gabriel, South Gate, South El Monte, West Covina, Whittier and especially Pomona have large a Mexican population. Culture Mexican Americans from Los Angeles have celebrated the Cinco de Mayo holiday since the 1860s. They, along with other Spanish-speaking peoples, celebrate the Day of the Three Wise Kings as a gift giving holiday. Another holiday that they celebrate would be Dia de Los Muetros (the day of the dead), which typically lasts 3 days. Zoot suits were a staple of Mexican-American attire in the 1940s and represented rebelling against the injustices of society. Los Angeles was an epicenter of the Chicano civil rights movement during the 1960s, along with the Chicano art movement that ensued. In the 1990s the quebradita dancing style was popular among Mexican-Americans in Greater Los Angeles.. The El Centro Cultural de Mexico is located in Santa Ana. Plaza Mexico is located in Lynwood. Two films, Tortilla Soup and Real Women Have Curves, portrays Mexican-American families in the Los Angeles area. Another great film that portrays the life of a Mexican-American in Los Angeles is Stand and Deliver, which demonstrates the life of Mexican-American high school students and how they get through their academic struggles, with the help of their teacher, Jaime Escalente (Edward James Olmos).

It features a middle-aged man wearing a black doublet with silver ornamentation. It also has a label affixed to the back which reads: :Shakespere :Born April 23=1564 :Died April 23-1616 :Aged 52 :This Likeness taken 1603 :Age at that time 39 ys This label was transcribed in 1909 by Marion Henry Spielmann; today, the original text is not legible. The Sanders portrait is one of the most researched portraits claimed to depict William Shakespeare (1564‚Äì1616). It is named for the man that owned (and perhaps painted) the portrait, John Sanders, whose family has owned the portrait for over 400 years ‚Äì including a transatlantic voyage that resulted in its presence in Canada. The portrait‚Äôs authenticity as a true likeness of Shakespeare continues to be questioned by critics though supporters point to scientific tests, genealogical research, and historical contexts which date this portrait not only to Shakespeare‚Äôs lifetime, but place it as originally painted and owned by a family who lived in the same neighbourhood as William Shakespeare and would have had connections through guild membership with the playwright. The portrait‚Äôs presence in Canada, its currently being in the private sphere, and its limited budget for more research and publicity are all factors in the lack of attention shown to the portrait. Partnering with current owner, Lloyd Sullivan, recent research from the Canadian Adaptations of Shakespeare Project (CASP)[http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/ Canadian Adaptations of Shakespeare Project (CASP) at the University of Guelph, has sought to return the portrait to the public eye and establish it as the only true likeness of Shakespeare painted in his lifetime. Genealogy and the Sanders family Extensive genealogical research has been undertaken by CASP researchers and Warwickshire and Worcestershire family historian Pamela Hinks to confirm the oral history of the Sanders family provided by the portrait's current owner, Lloyd Sullivan. This research suggests that the Sanders Portrait is the only likeness of Shakespeare which traces back directly to Shakespeare's lifetime. The family of Lloyd Sullivan was traced back directly to one John Sanders, Sullivan‚Äôs great-grandfather thirteen generations ago. It is believed that either John Sanders or his brother William painted the portrait of Shakespeare in 1603, when the family was living close to Shakespeare‚Äôs home in London, a house owned by Christopher and Mary Mountjoy on the corner of Silver Street and Monkwell Street (a. k. a. Muggle Street), in Cripplegate. The Sanders family and Shakespeare moved in circles that would have encouraged contact between the two: both families were intermarried with the Thockmorton, Catesby, and Arden families. For instance, in 1592, Phillipi Sanders (a brother of John Sanders) married Anna Heminges, a cousin of John Heminges ‚Äì one of Shakespeare's closest associates. Likewise, in 1613, a Joccossa Sanders married John Heminges's cousin Thomas Heminges. An oral tradition, documented in Stephanie Nolen's Shakespeare's Face (2002), holds that for 400 years the portrait was passed down in the family while knowledge of its existence remained private. Its ownership can be verified back as far as 1909 when M. H. Spielmann studied the painting - at which time it was in the possession of T. Hale Sanders, who had taken ownership of it from his uncle through his father. Thomas (T.) Hale Sanders is the great grandfather of Lloyd Sullivan. In early 1919 Agnes Hales Sanders, grandmother of Lloyd Sullivan, travelled from Montreal to London to reclaim the Sanders Portrait. Since then it has been held in Montreal and Ottawa. The portrait's existence was made public in May 2001 by Lloyd Sullivan. Since then has undergone multiple tests and been shown in art galleries, including the National Portrait Gallery in London. Sanders, Shakespeare, and Canada=Battle of Wills A 2008 documentary by Anne Henderson sought to tell the story of the Canadian-owned portrait of Shakespeare. The film both highlighted some of the technical and financial difficulties of caring for the painting, and showcased the controversy that surrounds the Sanders Portrait and other portraits claiming to be life likenesses of William Shakespeare. Interviews with descendants of the Sanders family; researchers Marie-Claude Corbeil, Daniel Fischlin and Pamela Hinks; actors Joseph Fiennes and Michael Pennington; as well as art experts Lily Koltun, David Loch, and Philip Mould offer an interdisciplinary inside look at the Shakespeare Portrait debates. As of November 2013 a second part of the documentary is in the works. \\"Look here upon this picture:\\" A Symposium on the Sanders Portrait of Shakespeare On November 28, 2013 all of the current information on the Sanders Portrait was made public by researchers from the University of Guelph and supplemented by discussions of the scientific studies done, the internal evidence (that is, a reading of the clothing of the sitter, the status of the sitter, the date on the portrait, and the artistic style), and a discussion of the media and cultural importance of the portrait. The day sought to renew interest in the portrait, establish it as the only portrait thought to be done in Shakespeare‚Äôs own lifetime, and to act as catalyst in a sale that would move the portrait from private to public domain. The Oxford University Press ‚Äì Shakespeare Made in Canada Series The Sanders Portrait has become the face of new editions of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays targeted as teaching tools for Canadian high school and undergraduate students. Oxford University Press commissioned the texts, which have been curated by General Editor Daniel Fischlin to provide a uniquely Canadian perspective on the works. Editions of The Tempest and Romeo and Juliet were released in November 2013, while new editions of Hamlet and A Midsummer Night‚Äôs Dream are in progress. All the plays feature the Sanders Portrait on the front cover and a brief summary of the portrait's provenance and research inside. Scientific testing In all, thirteen tests have been done over a fifteen-year period on the Sanders Portrait, more than any other reputed portrait of Shakespeare, performed by researchers across Canada and the world. These tests include: Dendrochronology Conducted by Dr. Peter Klein of the University of Hamburg, Germany in 1994. Using tree-ring dating, Dr. Klein determined that the oak panel was from the Baltic Region and that the earliest possible date of the painting was 1597. Radiography Conducted by Dr. Marie-Claude Corbeil, Senior Scientist at the Analytical Research Lab of the Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI), in order to determine that the likeness of Shakespeare was the first and only painting on the oak panel. The radiograph concluded there was not any other painting beneath the Sanders Portrait. Infrared and ultraviolet radiation Conducted by Dr. Corbeil of CCI to determine if there had been any retouching of the paint after it was finished. The result was that no retouching had occurred. Paint samples Conducted by Dr. Corbeil of CCI to determine that the paint and materials used were appropriate to the date of 1603. While this cannot definitively date the paint used, it can determine if the materials are too new. The results found that all of the paint materials and colours were consistent with those used in England in the early 17th century. The red paint of the date in the top corner was tested in the paint sample analysis and does not appear to be added after the portrait was finished. The label The label has been the source of much controversy. Many claim that the wording on the label ‚ÄúThis Likeness taken‚Äù is not consistent with 17th century practices. Others argue that the birthdate of Shakespeare (April 23) was an 18th century mistake and not to be trusted. However, scientific tests have proven that this date was, most probably, written in the 17th century and could definitively prove April the 23rd as Shakespeare‚Äôs date of birth. =Label analysis= Conducted by Dr. Corbeil of CCI which determined the label was made of rag paper from linen fibers, a product often used in the 17th century and predates pulp paper. =Glue= The glue used to affix the label was tested by Dr. Corbeil of CCI and determined to be a starch paste. =Radiocarbon dating of the paper= A sample of the rag paper label was sent to Roelf Beukens at the IsoTrace Laboratory associated with the University of Toronto. The radiocarbon dating concluded that the rag paper could date between 1475 and 1640. Dr. Marie Claude Corbeil suggests that the label was probably affixed within a few decades of Shakespeare‚Äôs death in 1616. =Ink= The analytical laboratory McCrone Associates Inc. in Chicago, Illinois conducted forensic ink tests on the label and concluded the following.: * The materials used in the ink are consistent with the 17th century ink manufacturing practices * A quill pen was used * The ink is well- integrated into the paper fibres of the label, in the same manner as iron gall ink, which was used in the 17th century * No dyes, binding mediums, or other alterations suggest any recent additions or changes to the ink on the label Internal evidence=Lloyd DeWitt Curator of European Art at the Art Gallery of Ontario, DeWitt examined the portrait‚Äôs style and oak panels, and determined them consistent with Elizabethan English Portraits. DeWitt also believes the Sanders to be a ‚Äúfriendship portrait,‚Äù painted by someone who knew the sitter. DeWitt also concluded that the construction of the oak panel is, in all likelihood, English. Jenny Tiramani The former director of theatre design at the Globe Theatre and foremost living expert on Elizabethan and Jacobean dress (among other accolades) inspected the clothing and hairstyles of the sitter in the Sanders Portrait and compared it with the biographical knowledge we have of William Shakespeare and his life in 1603 (when the picture was painted). Tiramani concluded: * Shakespeare‚Äôs elevation to a member of the King‚Äôs Men in 1603 was likely the reason for having the portraiture painted. * This elevation in status also allowed Shakespeare access to the silver thread and other elements of his dress that would have, the year earlier, been restricted from him by sumptuary laws. * The undercoat is similar to those worn in other early 17th century theatre portraits. * The hairstyle is consistent with those styles worn by young courtiers in the 17th century. Controversy The authenticity of the Sanders Portrait has not been widely accepted by scholars. As Adam Gopnik has written in The New Yorker, \\"...the portrait has, to its doubters, one overwhelming problem: it does not look much like Shakespeare.\\" Gopnik goes on to describe how the Sanders Portrait does not seem to resemble the Droeshout portrait or the Shakespeare funerary bust at Stratford-upon-Avon, both of which resemble each other, and are accepted by scholars as having been contemporary likenesses of Shakespeare. Gopnik does, however, refer to a comparison of the Sanders and Droeshout portraits that found 16 facial points in common, including the attached earlobe. The image has often been overlooked by scholars, with a host of subjective excuses, including that the man depicted seems too young; or that the birth date given is, or has been, used speculatively, and only after the 18th century. The label and its ink, however, has been tested and dated to within Shakespeare's life or shortly thereafter and could prove to be a final piece of evidence necessary to commit to April 23 as Shakespeare's date of birth and death. Ownership The portrait is currently in the possession of a private owner, Lloyd Sullivan of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. However, in December 2013 it was announced that a tentative deal was in the works for an unnamed Canadian family to purchase the portrait. The family is reported to be excited to keep the portrait in the Canadian public domain and is expected to donate the portrait to a public arts institution.

In the 18th century, the Hare and Billet was a coaching inn. The pub is now part of the Metropolitan Pub Company. The pub received media coverage in 2014 after a south London MP made a speech in the House of Commons claiming a condiment they served was a \\"parasitic copy\\" of another brand of Worcester Sauce, leading to a backlash that was nicknamed \\"Hendogate\\". History The Hare and Billet in 1780 when it was painted by Thomas Luny Watling Street, the Roman road to Dover, crossed the bleak and forbidding Blackheath and, in the 18th century, this stretch of the busy route was notorious for its highwaymen. At this time, the Hare and Billet was an isolated coaching inn on the heath. The establishment has been trading since the 1600s.\\"Hare and Billet\\". Time Out (London). 18 July 2011 Location The pub is on Hare & Billet Road, and across that road lies Hare and Billet Pond, considered to have the most natural appearance and probably the best wildlife habitat of the four ponds on Blackheath. The road is said to be haunted by the ghost of an 18th century woman who hanged herself from an elm tree when her lover failed to meet her there. The nearest railway station is Blackheath, approximately 0.25 miles away and the Lewisham DLR station is approximately 0.9 miles away. The A2 is 0.3 miles to the north of the pub. Hendogate On 20 January 2014, the pub was mentioned by Jim Dowd, MP for Lewisham West and Penge, during a debate in the House of Commons on the Intellectual Property Bill. The Hare and Billet was where Dowd was served Henderson's Relish when he asked for some Worcester Sauce during a meal. As Dowd was unfamiliar with Henderson's Relish he later cited the product as an example of \\"parasitic copying\\", namely of the anchovy-based condiment sold under the Lea & Perrins name. Due to the cult following enjoyed by Henderson's in Sheffield and South Yorkshire, Dowd faced a backlash in the media, which included an open letter rebuttal from the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Dowd's Labour Party colleague Paul Blomfield, MP for Sheffield Central. The pub noted that a number of Sheffielders living in London had visited the pub as a result of the media coverage that was generated.

The game was released on January 29, 2014 for all platforms and is available as public domain software on sourceforge. Set in the early 1990s, it pits players against one another as they invade others' houses and attempt to steal money from their vaults, while also setting up traps and other obstacles to keep their own vaults safe. In creating the game, Rohrer was influenced by his childhood fear of his house being robbed, numerous publicized shootings, and his own political views regarding gun rights and home invasions. During development and beta testing, the game went through several changes that increased its difficulty. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the design and creativity and others finding it hard to empathize with the game's intended message. Gameplay The player character reorganizes his house to protect his vault. His wife and children are visible in the top-center of the screen. The Castle Doctrine incorporates elements of puzzle, strategy, stealth, and roguelike games, viewed from a 2D perspective. It focuses on maintaining and protecting a vault of money stored in one's house from intruders. These intruders are actually other players of the game; likewise, the player can invade others' houses and steal their money‚Äîpresented in a list rather than found through exploration‚Äîin the same way. This list shows a pre-determined three-name pseudonym of each player, the number of dollars contained in their vault, how many others have tried to rob it, and how many have died in the process. All deaths in the game are permanent; upon dying, the player must create a new character. The player can protect their vault in a number of ways, such as building walls, keeping guard dogs, setting up traps such as electrified floors and bottomless pits, and giving guns to the player's family members so that they can defend the vault as well. The game does not punish the player for family members‚Äîby default, a wife and two children‚Äîbeing murdered by intruders; the player can even view footage of the incident afterwards. Rather, protecting the money is the goal the game emphasizes. The player starts off with $2,000 in cash and steals more from others' vaults; it can be used to purchase more objects to defend one's own vault. Additionally, a house is not accessible by thieves when its owner is retooling it for defense. When invading another's house, the player can attempt to deter these defenses in such ways as smashing windows, dismantling walls, short-circuiting machines, and even drugging guard dogs with tainted meat, in addition to killing any residents that are armed. Reaching a vault is always possible with enough skill; the game forces players to escape their own traps before other players can access them. Being caught in one's own traps has the same consequence as any other trap in the game: permadeath. Development=Conception and design The Castle Doctrine was created by indie developer Jason Rohrer; its ideas were drawn from Rohrer's childhood anxieties about his family's house being burgled, and his adult sense of responsibility over protecting his family. The game's central theme is the castle doctrine and includes the issue of gun rights; Rohrer created it partially as an \\"artistic statement\\" on defending one's family through violence. He summarized his goals with the game as creating something \\"that makes you feel violated and makes you want to protect stuff that‚Äôs yours, and puts you in the process of securing what‚Äôs yours.\\" However, he has remarked that the consequence of making players feel hypocritical‚Äîsince they are invading others' homes as well‚Äîwas partially intentional and an \\"elegant\\" idea. Rohrer noted in an interview his aversion to creating a \\"ridiculous caricature of some post-apocalyptic man‚Äôs world, where we‚Äôll all just robbing each other,\\" and instead called his game pre-apocalyptic in setting and style. In terms of aesthetics, Rohrer aimed for a \\"very clean, no frills, no fluff, no filler kind of design\\" that emphasized function in all of its objects. He has noted that some players have complained about not being able to decorate their houses non-functionally, but is unsympathetic, saying that the game is not FarmVille. The game was, however, influenced by Minecraft, which‚Äîwhile heavily tied to cosmetic decoration‚Äîinvolves similar themes of protecting one's creations from other players as in The Castle Doctrine. Rohrer thought of adding family members for the player's character early in the game's development, but scrapped it at first because of the extra complexity and not knowing how to make them more than inanimate objects. After a dream, however, he was inspired to see if there was a practical way to implement them that would further the game's \\"moral dimension.\\" Testing and releases The Castle Doctrine was first released as a paid alpha and sold at half-price from March 2013 until its official release on January 29, 2014. As was visible through its history of updates during beta testing, it went through several changes, primarily the increase of gameplay difficulty. One was the addition of dedicated \\"perma-perma-death\\" servers, where players could not even re- create characters after dying, in contrast to the game's generic \\"perma-death\\" servers. Another was \\"blueprints,\\" which allow players to get a general sense of a house's layout before entering and thus encourage setting up puzzle- based‚Äîrather than luck-based‚Äîvault defenses. Rohrer did not, however, want the game to be impossible, so he took the step of forcing players to evade their own traps before the houses would be accessible to others. The game has been placed in the public domain and is hosted on SourceForge. Upon release, the game's 50% discount was scaled back to 25% for one week. It has not gone on sale since, as Rohrer believes that \\"sales screw your fans\\" as they discourage buying games one wants during non-sale periods. Following the game's release, Rohrer used $3,000 USD of alpha release earnings to fund a competition in which players could win money, paintings, gift cards, and other prizes by having the highest worth in-game houses. The highest prize awarded was $316 USD. Reception The Castle Doctrine received mixed reviews from critics, with a score on review aggregator Metacritic of 58/100. Patrick Carlson of PC Gamer reviewed the game well, responding positively to the game rewarding experimentation and being easy to understand, describing it as thoughtfully designed. Game Informer's Daniel Tack also rated the game well, commenting particularly on its creativity, stating though that he did not think the game was \\"deep enough to stay interesting for long.\\" Writing for Destructoid, Patrick Hancock shared Tack's opinion that the game was a good experience, but said he would find it hard to recommend. The web-video series Extra Credits recommended it on one of their \\"Games you might not have tried\\" episodes, praising it for challenging the player to examine their beliefs, and commenting that being good at the game itself \\"requires the same sort of paranoid genius that the game itself is trying to warn against.\\" Polygon's Russ Pitts found the game a frustrating exercise, his experience determined by the arbitrary quality of player designed houses, and further obstructed by the harsh consequences of failure. Pitts felt the game valued its message over the player's time and yet found the message hard to take seriously; he would describe the game as the most disturbing he had ever played. Keza MacDonald, in her review at IGN, shared these frustrations, finding that tackling player- constructed houses made the game over-reliant on trial and error. She also found it hard to empathize with the small, pixelated characters, leading her to believe that the game failed in \\"communicating much of a message\\". Nick Capozzoli of GameSpot also gave the game a largely negative review, criticising the nihilistic feel, and saying that it did not bring out the emotions it was aimed to.

Perry Fellwock Perry Fellwock revealed the existence of then ultra secretive National Security Agency (NSA) and its global mass surveillance apparatus and activities, including domestic spying, in a 1971 Ramparts expos√©. This was the first wide exposure of the NSA, which had for decades prevented public knowledge of its abilities and activities. The revelations led the U.S. Senate Church Committee to introduce successful legislation intended to stop the NSA spying on American citizens. () Russ Tice In December 2005 Russ Tice helped spark a national controversy over claims that the NSA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) were engaged in unlawful and unconstitutional wiretaps on American citizens. He later acknowledged that he was one of the sources that were used in The New York Times reporting on the wiretap activity in December 2005. After speaking publicly about the need for legislation to protect whistleblowers, Tice received national attention as the first NSA-whistleblower in May 2005 before William Binney, Thomas Andrews Drake, Mark Klein, Thomas Tamm, and Edward Snowden came forward. Mark Klein Mark Klein is a former AT&T; technician who leaked knowledge of his company's cooperation with the NSA in installing network hardware to covertly monitor, capture, and process American telecommunications en masse. The subsequent media coverage became a major story in May 2006. In recognition of his actions, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) picked Klein as one of the winners of its 2008 Pioneer Awards. For over 22 years Mark Klein worked for AT&T.; Starting with the company as a Communications Technician in New York, where he remained from November 1981 until March 1991, he later continued in that capacity in California until 1998. From January 1998 to October 2003, Klein worked as a Computer Network Associate in San Francisco. From October 2003 to May 2004 he returned to the role of Communications Technician, after which he retired in May 2004. William Binney William Binney Video-Interview by is a former highly placed intelligence official with the NSA turned whistleblower who resigned on October 31, 2001, after more than 30 years with the agency. He was a high-profile critic of his former employers during the George W. Bush administration, and was the subject of FBI investigations, including a raid on his home in 2007. He came forward with NSA colleagues J. Kirk Wiebe and Edward Loomis, in cooperation with House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staffer Diane Roark. Thomas Tamm Thomas Tamm is a former attorney in the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR) during the period in 2004 when senior Justice officials fought against the widening scope of warrantless NSA surveillance that consisted of eavesdropping on U.S. citizens. He was an anonymous whistleblower to The New York Times, making the initial disclosure regarding the issue. Thomas Drake Thomas Andrews Drake is a former senior executive at the NSA, a decorated United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Navy (USN) veteran, and a whistleblower. In 2010 the government alleged that Drake \\"mishandled\\" documents, one of the few such Espionage Act cases in U.S. history. Drake's defenders claim that he was instead being persecuted for challenging the Trailblazer Project. \\"United States v Thomas A Drake.

The role of the museum is to collect and preserve the town's art collection and also to research and exhibit pieces in the collection regularly. The museum should strive to make the collection visible to the public so that the cultural heritage of the town can be enjoyed and become a part of the Icelandic history of culture and art. The museum operates according to its constitution and in accordance with the town's cultural policy, museum law and protocol of the International Council of Museums. Main objective / goals The museum's goals include the following: * That quality and boldness characterize the program of the museum, which will contribute to a positive image of the town and its resident's self-identity. * That exhibitions and events in the museum reflect diversity and change in contemporary art. * Art events should be well presented and a visit to the museum should be a part of the daily lives of the local residents where they can be educated, entertained and have an interesting experience of the arts. * Art education should be focused to reach students at all levels and a visit to Hafnarborg should be a desirable option that strengthens progress in education. * The museum should be in collaboration with artists, museums and other cultural institutions domestically and internationally. The museum is run as one of the town's institutions but has independent financing and its own board and art council. The director of Hafnarborg is √Åg√∫sta Krist√≥fersd√≥ttir Hafnarborg's board of directors are Almar Gr√≠msson, Gu√∞r√∫n √Åg√∫sta Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir and L√∫√∞v√≠k Geirsson.

The collection  Dr. Sverrir Magn√∫sson and his wife Ingibj√∂rg Sigurj√≥nsd√≥ttir laid the foundation of Hafnarborg when they donated their house and a considerable collection of 160 paintings. The museum was formally opened in May 1988 and the collection has grown considerably since then, both through purchases and through gifts from artists and collectors. One of Iceland's most respected painter, Eir√≠kur Smith donated over four hundred paintings by himself to the museum in 1990.Geirsson 2008, p. 9 The museum strives to strengthen and augment the collection with purchases so that it reflects important changes in history of art. The collection now consists of 1400 art works by various artists both Icelandic and foreign. Hafnarborg has the duty to catalogue its collection, foster research and the publication of books and catalogues based on such research of the art collection. Hafnarborg was the first museum in Iceland to complete a fully computerized catalogue of its collection.P√©tursd√≥ttir 2008, p.9 The collection is presently being listed online in the electronic museum collections database, www.sarpur.is, which was opened to the public in May 2013. Since the beginning in 1988, paintings from the collection have been placed in the public institutions of the town so that art is brought out to the peopleGeirsson 2008, p. 9 Selections from the art collection have been exhibited regularly. The latest exhibition displaying artwork from the collection opened on February 1, 2014 called ‚ÄúYour choice‚Äù where the public chooses objects from the museum's collection to be exhibited via the website www.sarpur.is where information on a large part of the museum's collection can be found visually online.http://hafnarborg.is  Education  Two museum educators work in Hafnarborg and guided tours are available upon request. In the museum's policy a great emphasis is placed on education and that it should host a dynamic educational program in connection with its exhibitions. The education in the museum involves developing critical, conceptual and analytical skills while engaging with art in the museum. The aim is to support education in schools by keeping the national curriculum in mind. Furthermore, the museum seeks to develop a base for discussion and debates where personal experience can be used as a starting point to interpret and analyze.  Community outreach and engagement activities  Hafnarborg has been an active center for art and cultural events and the museum is a popular venue for musicians and singers and the total number of concerts runs to many hundreds. Concerts have formed an important part of Hafnarborg's programme. The Museum cooperated in the years 1990 ‚Äì 2012 with Tr√≠√≥ Reykjav√≠kur, one of Iceland's most respected chamber groups which played in concerts in Hafnarborg multiple times every year during that period. Another important concert series is the Noon Concerts, which is a half an hour concert held once a month on a Tuesday at noon.

Active in the Romanian and French socialist movements before and during World War I, he left for Russia during the 1917 Revolutions. There, he became one of the organisers of Romanian volunteer detachments in support of the Soviets. Arrested shortly after returning to Romania in 1920, he left for Soviet Russia after a successful prison escape. During the later part of his life he held teaching positions at several Soviet universities, before falling victim to the Great Purge in 1937. His name was posthumously rehabilitated both in the Soviet Union and in his native Romania. Biography=Early life and activity Nicolau was born in Bucharest in 1889. As a student at the Saint Sava High School, he befriended Constantin Titel Petrescu and Mihail Cruceanu, both of whom would later become known as socialist militants. After finishing his secondary education, Nicolau trained as a lawyer, receiving a degree from the local University, a PhD in Paris, before being admitted to the Bucharest Bar. His first contacts with the Romanian socialist movement, still in disarray during that period, came through his membership in the Bucharest's Study Circle of the Socialist Students between 1908 and 1909. Soon after he began writing for Rom√¢nia Muncitoare, the main socialist press venue. One of his first notable contributions was his correspondence from Italy, criticising the reformist stance of the local socialist party. In 1911, Rom√¢nia Muncitoare published Nicolau's anti-militarist manifesto To the recruits. Recalling the army's contribution in suppressing the 1907 Peasants' revolt, the brochure called on the new recruits to choose a different path and refuse to support the government crackdown on the demands of the workers and the peasant. As a result, in May 1912 he was put under trial before the Court of the Ilfov County, where he reaffirmed the ideas expressed in the manifesto. Defended by fellow socialists Mihail Gh. Bujor, Toma Dragu and Titel Petrescu, and by socialist sympathizer Constantin Mille, Nicolau was eventually acquitted by the jury. In June 1912, along with Constantin Dobrogeanu Gherea, Ecaterina Arbore and others, he represented the Bucharest Socialist Club at the Fifth Congress of the Social Democratic Party of Romania (PSDR), being elected a member in the committee of the party's publishing house. In order to escape harassment from the authorities, Nicolau chose to leave Romania for Paris, where he continued his law studies at the Sorbonne, and joined the French Section of the Workers' International. World War I and Russian Revolution In 1916, Romania joined World War I on the side of the Entente and imposed an immediate ban on the local socialist movement, which had adopted a militant pacifist stance. Nicolau reacted by publishing in Paris a study highly critical of the Romanian ruling classes, titled The Crime of the Romanian Oligarchy. Returning to Romania later in the war, he was kept under constant surveillance by Siguran»õa, the secret police. Nicolau was present in Ia≈üi during the revolutionary agitation which emerged during the 1917 May Day celebrations and under the impression of the February Revolution. Along the other social-democrats, he supported the position of the PSD leader Christian Rakovsky, who believed the situation in Romania was not ripe for the overthrow of the monarchy. Romania volunteer regiment marching in Odessa in January 1918 Joining Christian Rakovsky and Bujor, Nicolau left in June 1917 for Russia, where he entered the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (bolsheviks). He settled in Odessa and, along with Bujor, Ion Dic Dicescu, and Alter Zalic, he was one of the organisers and afterwards leaders of the Romanian Committee for Social-Democratic Action established in the city. Nicolau also became the editor of Lupta (\\"The Struggle\\"), which presented itself as the successor of Rom√¢nia Muncitoare (renamed in 1914 to Lupta zilnicƒÉ, \\"The Daily Struggle\\"). After the October Revolution, the Romanian socialists in Odessa saluted the new developments. Becoming increasingly communist in outlook, they also began agitating for a revolution in their home country. Such views were publicly expressed by Nicolau during his speech at the 2nd Congress of Rumcherod. In order to help the Soviets secure power in Southern Russia, on December 28, 1917, the Committee established the Romanian Revolutionary Military Committee, which counted Nicolau, Bujor, and Dicescu among its leaders. The Revolutionary Committee worked in close cooperation with the Rumcherod, which provided it with material support. During the following period, two Romanian volunteer battalions were established by recruiting Romanian soldiers in Bessarabia and the Russian Black Sea ports, as well as workers who had been evacuated to Southern Russia. Between January and March 1918, the volunteers participated along the local Red Guards in battles against the troops of the Ukrainian People's Republic, the regular Romanian Army which had occupied Bessarabia, as well as against the Central Powers armies advancing from the Northwest. The occupation of Odessa by Austro-German troops in the aftermath of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk forced the volunteer battalions to retreat to Crimea and central Russia, with the members of the Action Committee either going underground or leaving for Russian areas still under Soviet control. In August 1918, Nicolau, Dicescu and the other former members of the Action Committee which had reached Moscow created the Romanian Communist Revolutionary Committee. The new committee, proclaimed the official representative of the PSDR in Russia, established contacts with the socialists in Bucharest and initiated an outreach campaign amongst the Romanian POWs in Russia. In late 1918, the Committee joined another Romanian group, the radical agrarian Romanian Revolutionary Peasants' Party, to form an unified Romanian Communist group of the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks). Nicolau was elected the group's chairman, with another PSDR member, Ion Pen≈£a, being elected secretary and representative to the Federation of Foreign Groups. Nicolau also began publishing regularly in Foaia »õƒÉranului, the former organ of the Revolutionary Peasants' Party. In 1919 the Publishing House of the Romanian Communist Groups in Soviet Russia published Nicolau's brochure The Socialist Revolution in Romania. The pamphlet acknowledged the Bolshevik support for the Romanian communists, and called on Romanians to follow the revolutionary path taken by the Russian communists under the leadership of Lenin. During August 1919, as the Soviets regained Odessa, Nicolau was one of the editors of the short-lived newspaper Sc√¢nteea. Later life and death Alexandru Nicolau returned to Romania in 1920, however he was soon apprehended by the authorities, and imprisoned in Jilava along with a larger group of communists, including Alecu Constantinescu. The group made a successful bid for escape on the night of December 2, 1920, and, following a short stay in Bulgaria, most escapees made their way to Moscow. On March 31, 1931, Nicolau was sentenced in absentia to death by the Romanian authorities. In Soviet Russia, he joined the local group of Romanian communists, and participated as a non-voting delegate in the Third World Congress of the Communist International, held in Moscow in June 1921. Nicolau also joined the Romanian section of the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West, where he lectured on topics such as history and social sciences, and worked as a teacher for the Moscow Institute of Foreign Languages. Nicolau was among the Romanian Communist refugees in Soviet Russia who in 1924 signed a memorandum calling for the creation of a Moldovan national territory inside the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, near the disputed border with Romania. Along with Dicescu, the main author of the document, Nicolau considered Moldovans to be Romanians, and saw the new polity primarily as a base for propaganda across the Dniester, in Bessarabia and Romania. Such views were however rejected by the Bessarabian Communists who, after gaining the support of the Ukrainian leadership, enforced a cultural policy emphasizing the distinctiveness of Moldovan identity in the newly created Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Arrested on August 14, 1937, during the Stalinist purges, Nicolau was sentenced to death on September 27, 1937, by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on fabricated charges of \\"espionage and involvement in counter-revolutionary terrorist organisations\\". He was executed on the same day, and buried in the Donskoy Cemetery in Moscow. He was posthumously rehabilitated on September 15, 1956, through a decision of the Soviet Supreme Court during the De- Stalinisation campaign. In a symbolic gesture, his name was also rehabilitated in Romania during the April 1968 Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party.
