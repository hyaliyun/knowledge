Aberystwyth-born Edwards was an author, having written a history of Wales and three biographies of David Lloyd George. He was a governor of University College of Wales, Aberystwyth and University College Cardiff. He was the editor of the magazines Young Wales, Welsh Review and Wales: a National Magazine, Liberal Welsh nationalist magazines. Prior to this, he served as a Congregationalist Minister in Montgomeryshire and London. Edwards was a supporter of the 'Cymru Fydd', or 'Young Wales' Movement of the 1890s, one of a number of South Walians who supported Lloyd George's attempt to create a united Welsh nationalist movement. He was present at the Newport Meeting of the South Wales Liberal Federation, in which the scheme for unity went down to defeat. Edwards was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid Glamorgan at the December 1910 general election, with a majority of more than 1,500 over a Labour Party candidate. In the years before the First World War, J. Hugh Edwards became well known for his anti-Socialist campaigning. In 1918, after extensive changes to the Glamorgan Parliamentary boundaries, J. Hugh Edwards was returned for Neath with a majority of more than 8,000 votes over the Labour candidate. At the 1922 general election, Edwards lost his seat to William Jenkins, a miners' leader and chairman of Glamorgan County Council who won a 6,235 majority over Edwards. Although a Welsh nationalist, J. Hugh Edwards would never sit for a Welsh Seat again, a sign of the weakening Liberal grip of Wales. Edwards was elected Member of Parliament for Accrington in 1923. In 1924 he was one of a small number of Liberals, including Winston Churchill and Hamar Greenwood, to contest the General Election as Constitutionalist candidates. These Liberals advocated closer ties between Liberals and Conservatives. Edwards' candidature in Accrington was supported by both parties' local associations. After the elections when it appeared that there was no prospect of formal closer ties between the two parties, Edwards re-took the Liberal whip. At the 1929 general election, Edwards stood as the Liberal candidate and was again not opposed by the local Conservatives; however he was narrowly defeated by Labour. He died in a nursing home at Virginia Water, Surrey, aged 76, having suffered senile dementia in his last years. Selected works * From Village Green to Downing Street - the Life of the Rt Hon D.

It provides a layer of abstraction between physical and logical data, and serves to allocate storage for all DBMS managed segments. (A database segment is a database object which occupies physical space such as table data and indexes.) Once created, a tablespace can be referred to by name when creating database segments. Tablespaces specify only the database storage locations, not the logical database structure, or database schema. For instance, different objects in the same schema may have different underlying tablespaces. Similarly, a tablespace may service segments for more than one schema. Sometimes it can be used to specify schema so as to form a bond between logical and physical data. By using tablespaces, an administrator also can control the disk layout of an installation. A common use of tablespaces is to optimize performance. For example, a heavily used index can be placed on a fast SSD. On the other hand, a database table which contains archived data that is rarely accessed could be stored on a less expensive but slower magnetic hard drive. While it is common for tablespaces to store their data in a filesystem file, a single file must be part of a single tablespace. Some database management systems allow tablespaces to be configured directly over operating-system device entries, called raw devices, providing better performance by avoiding the OS filesystem overheads. Oracle stores data logically in tablespaces and physically in datafiles associated with the corresponding tablespace.

In rugby league Sailor was a member of the successful Brisbane Broncos team of the 1990s, with whom he won Premierships in 1993, 1997, 1998 and 2000. A , his large frame and bullocking style made him a formidable opponent and prolific try-scorer. He represented Queensland in State of Origin and played for Australia (the Kangaroos) 16 times, including winning the 2000 Rugby League World Cup, where he was the top try-scorer and player of the tournament. He also played 3 times for the Super League Australia side. In 2001 he moved to the Queensland Reds in rugby union, and later to the New South Wales Waratahs after the 2005 Super 12 season. He made his debut for Australia (the Wallabies) in 2003 and won 37 caps, including at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, where Australia lost in the final. In 2006 he failed a drugs test and received a two-year suspension from all forms of rugby. His contract with the ARU was terminated, ending his rugby union career. He returned to rugby league in May 2008 with NRL club the St George Illawarra Dragons after his ban expired, playing for two seasons (the second of which was under his old Brisbane coach, Wayne Bennett), before retiring. Since retiring, Sailor has worked in television presenting and has appeared in reality TV shows. Background Sailor was born in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. He is South Sea Islander and West Indies descendant.  Early life  Sailor grew up with his adoptive parents in Sarina, Queensland. He never knew his father and knew nothing of him apart from his West Indian heritage. His adoptive father is Torres Strait Islander.  Playing career  = 1993‚Äì2001: Rugby league = In his inaugural year for the Brisbane Broncos, Sailor played in a handful of games, scoring three tries in his first season, though Sailor had limited involvement that year, the club won the premiership, defeating the St. George Dragons 14‚Äì6. After his impressive debut season, he won the Rookie of the Year award at the Broncos club. The following season Sailor took part in more games, scoring 14 tries. Such a rapid improvement over the course of two seasons saw Sailor become a regular in the Broncos ranks. He quickly became a home crowd favourite in Brisbane because of his speed and power and would soon become a household name in the rugby league world. During the 1994 NSWRL season, Sailor played on the wing for the defending premiers Brisbane when they hosted British champions Wigan for the 1994 World Club Challenge. At the end of the 1994 season he was selected for the 1994 Kangaroo Tour of Europe. He played in the opening fixture against a Cumbrian side where he scored two tries. He then started off the bench in a warm up match against Leeds, before earning a starting wing spot in the next match against Wigan and then playing off the bench again against Castleford. Sailor was again promoted to a starting wing position for the match against Halifax, scoring two tries. He then earned his first Test cap against Great Britain, as a starting wing in their loss at Wembley Stadium in late October. At the outbreak of the Super League war in 1995, Sailor along with the rest of his Broncos teammates and players of several other clubs, was aligned with Super League and so ineligible for selection in the 1995 State of Origin series or the end of season 1995 Rugby League World Cup. The following year, when all players were again allowed to be selected for representative football, Sailor's debut for the Queensland Maroons came in Game I of the 1996 State of Origin series. In Game II he played at fullback. Following the 1997 defection Super League and all its clubs, Wendell had a stellar year in the rebel competition. He was the top try-scorer for the Broncos and helped them win Super League's expanded 1997 World Club Championship tournament and then the premiership, defeating the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks 26‚Äì8 in the grand final. In the 1997 post season, Sailor was selected to play for Australia on the wing in all three matches of the Super League Test series against Great Britain. After the Super League war ended, the Broncos won the inaugural competition of the National Rugby League, defeating the Canterbury Bulldogs 38‚Äì12 in the 1998 NRL grand final, in which Sailor scored a try. He then spent the Australian summer in England, playing rugby union for Leeds Tykes and scoring 15 tries in 13 games. Sailor also appeared in two of the Leeds Rhinos trial games, including the 'Festive Challenge' on Boxing Day in 1998. Playing Halifax, he had had a torrid time until the closing stages of the game when he inspired Leeds to grab a draw. England's Wigan club had tried to sign Sailor for a large amount, but he decided to stay with the Broncos. In 1999 Sailor put in a man-of-the-match performance in the deciding match of the 1999 State of Origin series which saw Queensland retain the shield. At the end of the year he scored the match-winning try against New Zealand to clench the 1999 Tri-nations title for Australia. The following year Sailor was again the Broncos' top try-scorer (along with Lote Tuqiri). At the conclusion of the 1999 season, while on and end of season trip in Darwin, Sailor made a pact with his long time friend Kevin Walters to win the 2000 NRL Grand Final. He played for the Broncos on the wing and scored a try in their 2000 NRL grand final win over the Sydney Roosters, gaining himself another premiership ring. He was named the 2000 Brisbane Broncos season's Player of the Year and Best Back. In addition he received the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league. More success followed for Sailor as he traveled to Europe to compete in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup for Australia. He finished as the tournament's top try- scorer as well as boasting two tries in the victory over the Kiwis in the final. He was named best player of the tournament. Following the victory, Kangaroo coach Chris Anderson stated that \\"he's up there with Eric Grothe among the best of all time\\". Following the World Cup, many speculated that Sailor, who was off contract with the Broncos after the 2001 NRL season, would sign for a club in the Super League competition, as many Australian rugby league stars do. Shortly before travelling to England with Brisbane for the 2001 World Club Challenge, Sailor declared he was \\"leaning towards\\" switching codes following advice from rugby union convert and former Broncos teammate Peter Ryan. Talks also apparently began with leading English Super League clubs Wigan, Leeds and Bradford. Having won the 2000 NRL Premiership, the Broncos traveled to England to play against 2000's Super League V Champions, St Helens R.F.C. for the 2001 World Club Challenge, with Sailor playing on the wing in Brisbane's loss. The Australian Rugby Union were able to put up the funds to lure Sailor to rugby union, making him the first incumbent Australian test rugby league player to change to the 15-man game after decades of the opposite trend. Sailor ran 4,452 metres with the ball over the 2001 NRL season, more than any other player in the competition. Sailor is one of a handful of elite players to score over 100 tries for the club. He became the record co-holder of most tries in a Broncos match, with four. During the 2007 season at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them over the two decades since their inception in 1988 which included Sailor. = 2001‚Äì06: Rugby union = On 7 February 2001, it was announced by the Australian Rugby Union that they had reached an agreement with Sailor regarding a switch to Rugby union. Sailor signed a letter of intent with the ARU in February as well as signing with the Queensland Reds. The deal, worth approximately $700,000 per year, was formally completed in July, with Sailor set to leave League on the first day of November. He scored his first try in the Super 12 in his seventh match, where he scored twice and narrowly missed out on a hat-trick. Sailor made his Wallaby debut with former Queensland Maroons teammate and league convert Mat Rogers in a Test match against France in June 2002. Collectively at that point they became the 41st and 42nd Australian dual code internationals. Sailor then released his book, Crossing Over which details the troubles he had in changing codes and describes the differences between the two. The following season he thrived and showed that he had made some good adaptations to his new game. In 2003, Sailor was selected for the Wallabies to participate in that year's World Cup. He played in the opening match between Australia and Argentina, where he scored the first try of the tournament. Sailor played several games during the World Cup including the final. Sailor came off contract with the Reds after the 2005 Super 12 season, the media speculated that he would either move to Japan or sign with new franchise Western Force. However, he signed with the New South Wales Waratahs to play in the 2006 season. The Waratahs won the opening game of the 2006 season at Suncorp Stadium against Queensland.  Cocaine controversy  During a trip to South Africa, while injured he had a confrontation with a patron in a pub. He was suspended for a number of matches, but returned in round six, scoring two tries in the win over fellow Australian team, the Western Force. On 13 May 2006, hours before the final pool match of the Super 14 competition, it was announced that Sailor was to be suspended indefinitely from representing either the NSW Waratahs or Australian Rugby Team after returning a positive drug test for cocaine. Sailor's manager confirmed in a statement it was a doping offence.http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/200605/s1637974.htm After the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) tests confirmed that Sailor's urine 'A' sample from the pre-match test had contained indicators of cocaine, Sailor chose to have the second half of his sample retested. The second test results were not published to the media within the timeframe expected, leading to speculation that Sailor's 'B' sample had proved inconclusive or been mishandled, thereby providing an opportunity for appeal. Eventually the 'B' sample results were announced, and proved to be positive. The ARU immediately imposed a provisional suspension. When the matter was heard in the ARU Judicial Body, his legal team argued that he had not ingested cocaine within the 96 hours prior to the urine sample being taken. He further argued that he received no performance-enhancing benefits from cocaine, and that the clear scientific evidence is that cocaine is a short-acting stimulant that has effect for no more than two hours at most and that neither it nor its metabolites could have any performance enhancing benefit if taken more than 96 hours before a match. When quizzed by counsel for the ARU, Sailor admitted that during previous drug tests he had received anti-doping information cards which carry the warning that all elite athletes are responsible for any banned substance in their system. When asked whether he was aware that cocaine is a banned substance, he confirmed that he did. The ARU upheld that whether Sailor considered the substance performance-enhancing or not, Sailor was aware that cocaine was a banned substance at the time of ingestion, and refused to reduce or overturn the ban.http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,19861706-5001021,00.html On 23 July, Sailor penned a column in the Sunday Telegraph explaining his actions and apologising to his fans and family. This was the first of many occasions on which he made a public confession or apology.http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,,19877825-5001023,00.html Sailor in 2008 = 2008‚Äì09: Rugby league comeback = Since his exit from rugby union, several new streams of income have emerged for Sailor. He appeared on the television series, Dancing with the Stars. In addition, he provided NRL commentary for Channel Nine. Speaking to a Sydney radio station in March 2007, Wendell stated he did not intend to let his career end in drug shame and that a number of NRL clubs had approached him in talks for his services once his ban ended in April 2008. He would not disclose which clubs had approached him. At the time, media speculation linked Sailor to the South Sydney Rabbitohs but in June 2007, it was announced that Sailor would be joining the St George Illawarra Dragons on a two-year incentive based contract when his ban expired in April 2008. Many former NRL players supported the move, believing that Sailor would have a positive impact on the young Dragons squad. On Monday, 12 May 2008, Sailor officially commenced his contract with the St. George Illawarra Dragons. Sailor returned to rugby league playing initially for the Shellharbour Marlins (Dragons feeder team) in the New South Wales Cup. On 17 May, he scored two tries playing on the wing for Shellharbour at Ron Costello Oval. He played there for a further two weeks before moving up to the Dragons' NRL team. On 6 June, on the weekend preceding State of Origin game two, Sailor made his NRL comeback in a depleted St. George Illawarra lineup against his former club, the Brisbane Broncos. Sailor played a few more games for the Dragons as well as the Burleigh Bears in the Queensland Cup whenever he did not make the St. George Illawarra NRL side. He scored his first NRL try since he left the League in 2001 against his former team the Brisbane Broncos in round 23. He later scored a hat-trick in the Dragons' 40‚Äì14 victory over the Eels in round 25. Sailor was named in the 70-man Indigenous Australia squad alongside fellow Dragon Jamie Soward for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. The Celtic Crusaders and French Rugby Union were looking to sign him for 2009, despite him having one more year on his contract with the Dragons. For the 2009 season Sailor was re-united with the coach whom he began his professional career and won three premierships with, Wayne Bennett who had left the Brisbane broncos to coach the St. George Illawarra Dragons. Sailor was an influential figure in the Dragons side as he helped his side finish first in the regular season to gain the Minor Premiership. Sailor was recognised for his efforts as one of four nominees for the Dally M Winger of the year. Sailor's 16-year career in professional sport came to an end when he announced his retirement at a press conference on 12 November 2009 at the age of 35. His final game for the Dragons was, fittingly, at Suncorp Stadium against his old side, the Broncos, in a match the Dragons lost 24‚Äì10. Ironically, his first game for the Dragons was also against the Broncos in a match won by the Dragons, but Sailor was injured in that match. Sailor's final match was the 2010 All Stars game for the Indigenous team played at Skilled Park on the Gold Coast on 13 February 2010. He scored the opening try for the inaugural match and celebrated the try by picking up the corner post and played it like a didgeridoo with teammates dancing in the way of a corroboree. Sailor in 2012 Television career Sailor was a contestant on Dancing with the Stars in 2006. In 2010, Sailor became a regular panelist on Channel Nine's The NRL Footy Show and was contestant on Australia's Greatest Athlete. He came last out of eight sporting competitors. In 2011, he became the co-host of Channel Seven's Australia's Greatest Athlete, alongside Mark Beretta, and was a panelist on Foxtel's NRL on FOX. In 2011 Sailor participated in The Celebrity Apprentice Australia. In 2012, Sailor appeared Monday and Friday mornings on Channel Ten Breakfast to preview and review all the NRL action. On 11 June 2015, Sailor appeared on an episode of The NRL Footy Show, where he competed in an 'Iron Arm Challenge' to raise money for charity, against former NRL player Ben Ross. During the proceedings, an accident occurred and Ross broke his arm before being immediately rushed to hospital. In 2018, Sailor is to be sideline reporter on sports entertainment series Australian Spartan.. In 2019, Sailor appeared as 'the Rhino' in the first season of Network 10's The Masked Singer Australia.

At the 2016 census, Denmark had a population of 2,558; however, the population can be several times the base population during tourist seasons. History 't Landt van de Leeuwin (Leeuwin's Land) was the original Dutch name for the area from King George Sound to the Swan River. It was named after the Dutch East Indiaman Leeuwin, which sighted the coast from Hamelin Bay to Point D'Entrecasteaux in 1622. The coastline of the Denmark area was observed in 1627 by the Dutchman Fran√ßois Thijssen, captain of the ship 't Gulden Zeepaert (The Golden Seahorse), who sailed to the east as far as Ceduna in South Australia and back. Captain Thijssen had seen the south coast of Australia and charted about of it between Cape Leeuwin and the Nuyts Archipelago. Two centuries later, when the first Europeans entered the lands around the present Denmark, the area was inhabited by the Noongar. Aborigines called the river and the inlet Kwoorabup, which means \\"place of the black wallaby\\" (kwoor). The Denmark River was given its modern name in December 1829 by naval ship's surgeon Thomas Braidwood Wilson after his mentor, naval surgeon Alexander Denmark, Physician of the Fleet, Resident Physician at the Royal Hospital Haslar, and past-Physician to the Mediterranean Fleet. Wilson found the river while exploring the area in company with the Noongar Mokare from King George Sound, John Kent (officer in charge of the Commissariat at Frederick Town, King George Sound), two convicts and Private William Gough of the 39th Regiment, while his ship the Governor Phillip was being repaired at King George Sound. In August 1895 C & E Millar completed the purchase of 20,000 acres of freehold timber country at Denmark River, known as the Denmark Estate, and in October 1895, after a stock exchange listing in London to raise the capital, Millars Karri and Jarrah Forests Limited commenced a railway extension from Torbay to Denmark River. The formation was completed and the first timber mill constructed at Denmark timber station in December 1895. A post office and savings bank was opened on 30 August 1897. Millars built its third mill in 1898 and by 1900 there were 800 workers and their families resident at Denmark, for a total population of 2,000. Resource depletion soon resulted in a total collapse of the local karri timber industry. By May 1903, with the closure of No 1 Mill, the Denmark milling industry was in decline. On 30 September 1904 Millars' Denmark operation was closed down. In 1908 Millars sold the Denmark Estate and the Elleker-Denmark railway to the state government. A townsite was surveyed and provision made for a school site, recreation reserves and town hall site. In 1911 the Denmark Ward of the Albany Roads Board was excised to form the Denmark Roads Board. The population declined dramatically, and revived only with the introduction of the Group Settlement Scheme in the 1920s. Small farms of 40 ha (100 acres) were cleared from woodland to create pasture for cattle, dairying and orcharding, mainly apples. Conditions were often poor and some of the small farmers could hardly survive. They worked in one of the timber mills operating around the middle of the 20th century. Tourism started when American soldiers, stationed in Albany during World War II, made outings to Denmark. After the war, Denmark became a popular holiday destination for Western Australians. By the 1960s the population had increased to 1,500 and Denmark was becoming attractive to alternative life-stylers and early retirees. Intensive agriculturists such as wine growers had discovered the value of the rich karri loam for their vineyards. Riesling and Chardonnay were the first grapes grown on Denmark soil, soon followed by other varieties. Within 50 years the area became a wine subregion of critical acclaim, as part of the Great Southern Wine Region.John Gladstones, Viticulture and Environment, Winetitles 1992 The first winery, Tinglewood, opened in 1976, and by 2008, over twenty vineyards had been established around Denmark. =WAGR rail service= Millars' Elleker-Torbay-Denmark railway line closed on 31 May 1905. During negotiations over the sale of the railway line the State leased the line and WAGR rail services began on 3 May 1907. In 1908 Millars sold the railway to the state government. Line extension works beyond Denmark were started in 1926 and on 11 June 1929 the first passenger service ran to Nornalup. The Nornalup-Denmark-Torbay-Elleker rail service was permanently shut down on 30 September 1957 and the rails were lifted in 1963. Climate Denmark has a Mediterranean climate (Csb) with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Demographics Australia Day in the Berridge Park on the Denmark River bank According to the 2016 census, Denmark had a population of 2,558. Of these, 67.9% were Australian-born, 11.8% were born in England or Scotland, 2.3% were born in New Zealand and 1.2% were born in South Africa. 2.1% identified as Aboriginal. The demography fluctuates depending on tourism; with the town at full capacity during school holidays and throughout the summer. The many holiday houses kept in Denmark usually belong to wealthy Perth-based families. During the census (Tuesday 9 August) 19.6% of dwellings were unoccupied (national average 11.2%). Facilities Denmark Visitor Centre Denmark River and Berridge Park Denmark is a rural town with timber milling, orcharding, beef cattle and dairy farming as its primary industries. Soil and climate attract wine growers, with tourism being the fastest growing business in Denmark. There is limited commercial fishing in Wilson Inlet. Denmark has no harbour. The town is home to the Western Australian College of Agriculture ‚Äì Denmark, a working farm and educational facility for Year 10, 11 and 12 students providing specialist education in farming and farm-related studies. It is also home to Denmark Senior High School. Denmark was awarded the title of Australia's Tidiest Town in 1998. On the Denmark River near Wilson Inlet there is a wooden Heritage Railway bridge where several walking trails come together including the Bibbulmun Track, which runs from the Perth region to Albany, and the \\"Denmark‚ÄìNornalup Heritage Trail\\". Denmark is on the South Coast Highway, and is serviced by the TransWA public transport system. The town has an airstrip for small planes. Flora and fauna Denmark is surrounded by native woodland with a large variety of trees, including the eucalypts marri, karri, jarrah and red tingle. The latter can reach a height of . A distinctive local tree is the red-flowering gum. There are many indigenous bird species, including splendid fairy-wrens, emus, Australian white ibis, Australian magpies and Australian ringnecks. Many species of reptiles including snakes and skinks can be found. Marsupials such as the western grey kangaroo, the southern brown bandicoot and the common brushtail possum also live in the area. The abundance of fish, squid and other marine life in the Denmark estuaries and along the coastline attracts bottlenose dolphins and seals; seasonally southern right whales rest there during their long migrations to the north. Greens Pool (located between Denmark and Walpole) is a sandy white beach ringed by large granite boulders. It is part of William Bay National Park and a main tourist attraction in summer. Denmark is a well-known recreational fishing location with a variety of catch including snapper, salmon, bream, King George whiting and abalone.

Burroughs, published by Olympia Press and later by Grove Press in 1967. Together with The Soft Machine and Nova Express it is part of a trilogy, referred to as The Nova Trilogy, created using the cut-up technique, although for this book Burroughs used a variant called 'the fold-in' method. The novel is an anarchic tale concerning mind control by psychic, electronic, sexual, pharmaceutical, subliminal, and other means. Passages from the other two books and even from this book show up in rearranged form and are often repeated. This work is significant for fans of Burroughs, in that it describes his idea of language as a virus and his philosophy of the cut-up technique. Also, it features the cut-up technique being used by characters within the story. The Ticket That Exploded lays the groundwork for Burroughs' ideas of social revolution through technology, which he would later detail in his book-length essay The Electronic Revolution. The revised edition published in 1967 was 50% longer than the original, as Burroughs added more material and an appendix. In 2014, a 'Restored' edition was published by Grove Press, edited by Oliver Harris, which made a number of corrections and added an introduction and extensive notes. Establishing the text's manuscript history, the introduction showed that Burroughs wrote The Ticket after The Soft Machine and before Nova Express, and argued that the Trilogy defied any fixed sequence. Plot introduction The Ticket That Exploded continues the adventures of Agent Lee in his mission to investigate and subvert the methods of mind control being used by The Nova Mob, a gang of intergalactic criminals intent on destroying Earth. From the book: \\"The basic nova technique is very simple: Always create as many insoluble conflicts as possible and always aggravate existing conflicts‚ÄîThis is done by dumping on the same planet life forms with incompatible conditions of existence‚ÄîThere is of course nothing \\"wrong\\" about any given life form since \\"wrong\\" only has reference to conflicts with other life forms‚ÄîThe point is these life forms should not be on the same planet‚ÄîTheir conditions of life are basically incompatible in present time form and it is precisely the work of the nova mob to see that they remain in present time form, to create and aggravate the conflicts that lead to the explosion of a planet, that is to nova‚Äî\\" Category:1962 American novels Category:Novels by William S.

Graves of Muslim soldiers of Tsarist army, fallen in 1st World War at Lithuanian soil. Antakalnis Cemetery Islam in Lithuania, unlike many other northern and western European countries, has a long history starting from 14th century. The medieval Grand Duchy of Lithuania of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, stretching from Baltic to Black seas, included several Muslim lands in the south inhabited by Crimean Tatars.Islamic peoples of the Soviet Union, by Shirin Akiner, pg. 85 A few Muslims migrated to ethnically Lithuanian lands, now the current Republic of Lithuania, mainly under rule of Grand Duke Vytautas (early 15th century). The Tatars, now referred to as Lithuanian Tatars, lost their language over time and now speak Lithuanian; however, they maintained Islam as their religion. Due to the long isolation from all the greater Islamic world, the practices of the Lithuanian Tatars differ somewhat from the rest of Sunni Muslims; they are not considered a separate sect, however, although some of the Lithuanian Tatars practice what could be called Folk Islam. One anonymous Lithuanian Tatar who made Hajj to Mecca acknowledged in his work the Ris»Éle that the Lithuanian Tatars had unorthodox customs and rituals so that they could possibly be viewed as infidel (kafir) from the perspective of orthodox Muslims. In Lithuania, unlike many other European societies at the time, there was religious freedom. Lithuanian Tatars settled in certain places, such as around Rai≈æiai (in Alytus district municipality). Much of the Lithuanian Tatar culture, mosques, graveyards and such were destroyed by the Soviet Union after it annexed Lithuania. After restoration of Lithuanian independence however the government supported the promotion of Lithuanian Tatar culture among those Lithuanian tatars who lost it. Three original wooden mosques remain now (in villages of Nemƒó≈æis, Keturiasde≈°imt Totori≈≥ (both in Vilnius district municipality) and Rai≈æiai (Alytus district municipality), typically having relatively large Muslim populations), as well as a new brick mosque built in Kaunas during the period of interwar independence of Lithuania (in the 1930s) to commemorate the anniversary of Vytautas, the duke who brought Tatars and Islam to Lithuania. That mosque is called Vytautas Didysis Mosque after the Grand Duke Vytautas. In the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, however, no mosque remains, as Russians destroyed the Luki≈°kƒós Mosque which was there. The Lithuanian Tatar community is trying to rebuild the mosque, but faces various problems, including lack of funds as well as certain actions by the government of Vilnius city municipality. Currently, only several thousand Lithuanian Tatars remain, making up an estimated 0.1% of the country's population;Raƒçius, E. (2013).

It has a permanent population in the low hundreds, which swells to over a thousand during the New Year holiday period. It has a convenience store, a library and a volunteer fire department. The local Surf lifesaving club has a close relationship with the community of regularly holidaying families. At the north end of the 1.5 km beach is a small lagoon and past this is a short walk to Waimama bay. The lagoon has a cycle of being blocked by sand then being dug out by the council digger or enthusiastic members of the public. At the south end a short bush walk crosses through privately owned land to a blowhole. The beach itself is popular for surfers as it often features a roaming sandbar or two. The shore is often quite steep meaning the waves are sometimes breaking directly on the sand making it difficult for casual swimmers.  History Whiritoa beach is typical of many beaches along the eastern Coromandel Peninsula, starting its formation around 6,000 to 7,000 years ago. Early MƒÅori communities removed most of the original coastal forest and dune plants. Farmers then introduced stock to the dune area, disturbing the native sand-binding grasses and causing severe wind erosion. Most of the sand reserves eroded, reducing the height of the dunes and caused sheets of sand to move more than 200m inland. The sand at Whiritoa Beach was mined for over 50 years; in total more than 180,000 m¬≥ of sand has been removed.

He was for many years a professor and head of departments for linguistics at the University of Texas at Austin, and served as president of both the Linguistic Society of America and the Modern Language Association. Lehmann was also a pioneer in machine translation. He lectured a large number of future scholars at Austin, and was the author of several influential works on linguistics. Early life and education Winfred P. Lehmann was born in Surprise, Nebraska on June 23, 1916, the son of the Lutheran minister Philipp Ludwig Lehmann and Elenore Friederike Grosnick. The family was German American and spoke German at home. They moved to Wisconsin while Lehmann was a boy. After graduating from high school, Lehmann studied German and classical philology at Northwestern College, where he received his BA in humanities in 1936. He subsequently enrolled at the University of Wisconsin. At Wisconsin, Lehmann specialized in phonetics and Indo-European and Germanic philology. He studied a variety of topics, including the works of John Milton and Homer, German literature, and became proficient in a diverse number of languages, including Old Church Slavonic, Lithuanian, Old Irish, Sanskrit and Old Persian. His command of languages would eventually extend to Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese, Turkish, and several branches of the Indo-European languages, including Celtic, Germanic, Italic, Balto-Slavic, Hellenic, Anatolian and Indo-Iranian. Among his teachers at the University of Wisconsin were the Indo- Europeanist and Balticist Alfred E. Senn, Celticist Myles Dillon, Scandinavist Einar Haugen, and Morris Swadesh, William Freeman Twaddell and Roe-Merrill S. Heffner. Haugen's fieldwork among Scandinavian Americans would prove highly influential for Lehmann's later work on sociolinguistics. With Swadesh, Lehmann carried out studies on the Ho-Chunk people. It was Twaddell and Heffner who was to have the strongest influence on him. He spent much time working with Heffner on phonetics, and the two co-wrote several articles on dialectology and sociophonetics for the journal American Speech, which are still of importance to scholars today. Lehmann gained his MA in 1938, and his PhD in 1941, both in Germanic linguistics at Wisconsin. His PhD thesis on verbs in Germanic languages was co-directed by Twaddell and Heffner. Early career From 1942 to 1946, Lehmann served in the Signal Corps of the United States Army. During World War II he was an instructor in Japanese for the United States Army, and eventually became officer-in-charge of the Japanese Language School. The administrative experience and knowledge of non-Indo- European languages that he acquired during the war would have a major impact on his later career. Since 1946, Lehmann taught at Washington University in St. Louis, where served as Instructor (1946) and Assistant Professor (1946-1949) in German. Wishing to focus more on linguistics and philology rather than only the German language, he arranged with Leonard Bloomfield to spend the summer at Yale University to catch up with advanced in linguistics during the war, but these plans came to nothing after Bloomfield suffered a debilitating stroke. Career Animated map of Indo-European migrations in accordance with the Kurgan hypothesis. Much of Lehmann's research centered on the Proto-Indo-European language. In 1949, Lehmann transferred to the University of Texas at Austin, which at the time had about 12,000 students and was known for its strength in philology and for its university library. He subsequently served as Associate Professor (1949-1951) and Professor (1951-1962) of Germanic Languages at University of Texas at Austin. During this time Lehmann published his influential work Proto-Indo-European Phonology (1952). Since 1953, Lehmann served as Chairman of the Department of Germanic Languages (1953-1964), Acting Chairman of the Department of Slavic Languages (1960-1965). In 1963 he was made Ashbel Smith Professor of Linguistics and Germanic Linguistics (1963-1983). The Ashbel Smith professorship accorded him twice the salary of an ordinary professor. In 1964, Lehmann became the founding Chairman of the Department of Linguistics (1964-1972). As the chairman of both the Germanic and linguistics departments, Lehmann oversaw the development of highly successful first-rate programs in German and linguistics. Knowledge of languages, and linguistics in particular, was in great demand after the launching of Sputnik 1, and his programs received generous funding through the National Defense Education Act and from the National Science Foundation. His efforts were greatly aided by the strong support he received from university president Harry Ransom. Lehmann arranged world-class conferences in both linguistics and German literature, established several linguistic institutes, a Visiting Writer's Program, and hired numerous distinguished professors in German and linguistics. Scholars hired by him during this time include Emmon Bach, Robert T. Harms, Edgar C. Polom√© and Werner Winter. In 1961, Lehmann established the Linguistics Research Center (LRC), of which he was Director until his death. Through the LRC, he secured millions in funding to the field of machine translation and historical linguistics. Lehmann was also instrumental in the establishment of the Arabic Center (later the Center for Middle Eastern Studies) and the Hindi-Telugu Center (later the Center for South Asian Studies). He notably cooperated with Gardner Lindzey on developing studies in psycholinguistics. Runic inscription in Gothic on the Ring of Pietroassa. Lehmann was a known authority on the Gothic language. Lehmann was well known for his teaching style, and notably encouraged his students to seek to understand his lectures rather than just simply writing them down. Instead of only grading his students' papers and exams, he would give them detailed evaluations of their performance, and encouraged them to pursue and develop ideas. Lehmann strongly encouraged his students to seek having their works published in academic journals. Under the leadership of Lehmann, the departments for Germanic languages and linguistics at University of Texas at Austin both became among the top five graduate programs in North America, which they remained for 25 years. Almost ten percent of all PhDs awarded in linguistics in the United States during this time came from the University of Texas at Austin. He supervised more than fifty PhDs and mentored hundreds of students, many of whom would acquire prominent positions in their respective fields. Lehmann was President of the Linguistic Society of America in 1973, and President of the Modern Language Association of America in 1987. He remains the only person to have led both of these organizations, which are the two most important and prestigious professional organizations for linguistics in the United States. Throughout his career, Lehmann was also Member of the Association for Computational Linguistics (President in 1964), the Society for the Advancement of Scandinavian Study, the American Oriental Society, Soci√©t√© de Linguistique de Paris, Indogermanische Gesellschaft, Linguistic Society of India, Societas Linguistica Europaea, Early English Text Society, the Board of Directors of the American Council of Learned Societies, Corresponding Member of the Institut f√ºr Deutsche Sprache, Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Center for Applied Linguistics (1974-), and Corresponding Fellow of the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. He was also a Fulbright and Guggenheim Fellow. Combined with his teaching and administrative duties, Lehmann was engaged with research and writing. His Historical Linguistics: An Introduction (1962) has been translated into Japanese, German, Spanish and Italian, and remains a standard work on historical linguistics. He edited the Reader in Ninetenth Century Historical Indo-European Linguistics (1967), which remains a standard work on both Indo-European, historical, and comparative linguistics. His Proto-Indo-European Syntax (1974) was hailed as breakthrough by linguist Robert J. Jeffers, who reviewed it in the journal Language. Studies in Descriptive and Historical Linguistics , a festschrift in Lehmann's honor, was published in 1977 under the editorship of Paul Hopper. His influential Syntactic Typology was published in 1981. In 1983, Lehmann was made Louann and Larry Temple Centennial Professor in the Humanities at University of Texas at Austin. He received the Harry H. Ransom Award for Teaching Excellence in the Liberal Arts in 1983, which he would describe as the greatest honor of his career. In 1984, together with fellow researcher Jonathan Slocum, Lehmann developed a groundbreaking prototype computer program for language translation, which the LRC put into commercial production for Siemens. Retirement Lehmann retired as Louann and Larry Temple Centennial Professor Emeritus in the Humanities in 1986. Although having retired from teaching, he was still very active as a researcher at the Linguistics Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and continued to write books and articles. In 1986 Lehmann founded the journal Computers and Translation, now Machine Translation, of which he was the founding editor. His Gothic Etymological Dictionary (1986) has been described as the best work ever published on Germanic etymology. He received the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1987. Notable works authored by Lehmann during his final years include the third edition of Historical Linguistics (1992) and Theoretical Bases of Indo-European Linguistics (1993). Language Change and Typological Variation , a second festschrift in his honor, was published by the Institute for the Study of Man in 1999 under the editorship of Edgar C. Polom√© and Carol F. Justus. Lehmann completed his final monograph, Pre-Indo-European (2002), at the age of 86. Death and legacy Lehmann was preceded in death by his wife Ruth and his son Terry, and died in Austin, Texas on August 1, 2007. Throughout his career, Lehmann wrote more than fifty books and special issues of journals, and over 250 articles and more than 140 reviews. These works covered a diverse set of topics, including Middle High German literature, Japanese grammar, Old Irish, Biblical Hebrew, and textbooks on the German language. His contributions to the fields of Indo-European, Germanic and historical linguistics, and machine translation, have been significant, and several of his works on these subjects have remained standard texts up to the present day. He is remembered for his crucial role in establishing the University of Texas at Austin as one of America's leading institutions in linguistics, and for the large numbers of students that he taught and mentored, many of whom have made major contributions to scholarship. Personal life Sunset at Lake Travis, where the Lehmann family lived. Lehmann married Ruth Preston Miller on October 12, 1940, whom he met while studying at the University of Wisconsin. A specialist in Celtic linguistics and Old English, Ruth was Professor of English at the University of Texas at Austin. Winfred and Ruth had two children, Terry Jon and Sandra Jean. Winfred and Ruth were both environmentalists and loved animals. They donated of land in the northwest of Travis County, Texas to create the Ruth Lehmann Memorial Tract. The family inhabited a spacious house on Lake Travis, where they cared for rescued animals. Aside from linguistics and the environment, Lehmann's great passion was literature, particularly early Germanic literature and the novels of his friend Raja Rao and James Joyce. He was also a skilled pianist. Lehmann was a close friend of John Archibald Wheeler, with whom he shared an interest for literature. Despite his wide circle of friends, Lehmann was nevertheless a very private man.

The park is named after the floral emblem of New South Wales, also known as the Waratah. Griffin planned that the state capital city avenues were terminated with a park named after the generic botanical name for a native plant from that particular state. The park covers 0.079 km¬≤. The park was established in 1922 and is very long and thin, with many large native and introduced trees. A stormwater drain runs along the middle of the park, which is crossed by several bridges. The park has barbecue areas and playground equipment, and is a popular destination. It was listed by the ACT Heritage Council in 2012. The park is bounded by Telopea Park West (street) and Telopea Park East (street) on either side, with Manuka Oval at the southern end, across New South Wales crescent, and Bowen drive on the Northern End, near Lake Burley Griffin.

After the failed rebellion by Shamash-shum-ukin against Ashurbanipal, Kandalanu was proclaimed as the new vassal king of Babylon. His background is uncertain; it is possible that he was one of Ashurbanipal's younger brothers, a Babylonian noble who had sided with him in Shamash-shum-ukin's revolt, or a simple-minded or deformed man appointed as king to ensure he did not gain the support of the Babylonians for further actions against Assyrian rule. A mysterious figure, Kandalanu's reign is poorly attested, with historical evidence from his time as ruler being limited to date formulae and chronological texts. Some historians believe that Kandalanu was the same person as Ashurbanipal, Kandalanu simply being the name used by the king in Babylon, but this idea is considered unlikely by modern researchers.  Historical background  Babylonia had been conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire by Tiglath-Pileser III (745‚Äì727 BC) less than a century before Kandalanu became its king.' For most of the period since this conquest, the Assyrian king had simultaneously reigned as the king of Babylon, though the Babylonians often resented their rule. In an attempt to possibly mitigate the animosity of the Babylonians, Esarhaddon (681‚Äì669 BC) upon his death granted the kingships of Assyria and Babylonia to two different sons. The elder son Shamash-shum-ukin was granted Babylonia while the younger Ashurbanipal was to become the King of Assyria.' Though this arrangement of two kings worked for some time, Shamash-shum-ukin was in a subordinate position to Ashurbanipal. Inscriptions suggest that any orders Shamash-shum- ukin gave to his subjects first had to be verified and approved by his brother. Ashurbanipal had a permanent garrison stationed at Borsippa, a city deep inside Shamash-shum-ukin's domain. There are also preserved petitions sent by officials in Babylon directly to Ashurbanipal‚Äîhad Shamash-shum-ukin been the universally respected sovereign of Babylon, he would probably have been the receiver of such letters. Royal records from Babylonia during the time of peaceful coexistence between Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin mention both their names, but contemporary documents from Assyria only mention Ashurbanipal, reinforcing that the two kings were not equal in status. Shamash-shum-ukin grew resentful and in 652 BC he rebelled, assembling a coalition of Assyria's enemies to aid him in his effort to rid himself of Ashurbanipal's yoke. The revolt was unsuccessful and by 650 BC, most of the cities under Shamash-shum-ukin's control had been besieged, including Babylon itself. Having endured starvation and disease over the course of the siege, Babylon fell in 648 BC and was plundered. The circumstances of Shamash-shum- ukin's death after the siege are unclear; though popular legend has it that he committed suicide by setting himself on fire in his palace,' contemporary texts (chiefly Ashurbanipal's own annals) only say that he \\"met a cruel death\\" and that the gods \\"consigned him to a fire and destroyed his life\\". In addition to suicide though self-immolation or other means, he might have been executed or killed accidentally.  Reign and role  With Shamash-shum-ukin's defeat, Ashurbanipal had once more incorporated the region into the Neo- Assyrian Empire. Instead of assuming the kingship himself, he appointed a new vassal king, Kandalanu. Kandalanu's background is uncertain, he might have been a younger brother of the king or a Babylonian noble who had allied with him in the civil war. His name appears to mean some sort of physical deformity, possibly a clubfoot. Alternatively, he might even have been simple- minded, and because of either deformity of simple-mindedness unlikely to gain support for any action towards Assyria. He might also have been perfectly healthy as the appointment of a deformed or simple-minded king might have been seen as a grave offence by the Babylonians and could thus have instigated more unrest in the region. The only surviving authentic contemporary records of Kandalanu's reign are date formulae in documents referring to his rule and chronological texts (a chronicle and later king lists). His kingdom he ruled was the same as Shamash-shum-ukin's with the exception of the city of Nippur, which Ashurbanipal converted into a powerful Assyrian fortress. His authority is likely to have been very limited and nothing is known of his actions and activities. He probably lacked any true political and military power, which was instead firmly in the hands of the Assyrians.  Identification with Ashurbanipal  Traditionally, the final year of Ashurbanipal was assumed to have been 627 BC as per an inscription at Harran made by the mother of the Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus nearly a century later. The final contemporary evidence for Ashurbanipal being alive and reigning as king is a contract from the city of Nippur made in 631 BC. To get the attested lengths of the reigns of his successors Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun to match, his rule must have ended in 631 BC, the year of his death. If it had ended in 627 BC, the inscriptions of his successors Ashur-etil-ilani and Sinsharishkun in Babylon would have been impossible, as the city was seized by Nabopolassar in 626 BC, and never again fell into Assyrian hands. A once popular theory to explain the discrepancy between the 42-year reign claimed in the Harran inscription and the more likely 38-year reign, for instance defended by Polish historian Stefan Zawadski in his book The Fall of Assyria (1988), is that Ashubanipal and Kandalanu were the same person, Kandalanu simply being the name the king used in Babylon. This is considered unlikely for several reasons. No previous Assyrian king is known to have used an alternate name in Babylon. Inscriptions from Babylonia also show a difference in the lengths of the reigns of Ashurbanipal and Kandalanu; Ashurbanipal's reign is counted from his first full year as king (668 BC) and Kandalanu's is counted from his first full year as king (647 BC). All Assyrian kings who personally ruled Babylon used the title \\"King of Babylon\\" in their own inscriptions, but it is not used in Ashurbanipal's inscriptions, even those made after 648 BC. Babylonian documents treat them as two different people, with no contemporary Babylonian sources describing Ashurbanipal as king of Babylon.

It is situated along the Lower Denmark Road; the main tourist route from Albany to Denmark. The town was planned by the Western Australian Land Company, who built the Great Southern Railway in 1886‚Äì1889. It was originally known as Lakeside, due to its proximity to Lake Powell, but did not develop initially. The Government purchased the railway in 1896, redesigned the town and gazetted it as Lakeside in 1899. The town emerged as a railway junction between the Torbay line, which served timber sawmills in the area, and the Great Southern railway, and it was renamed Torbay Junction in 1908. In 1921, it was renamed Elleker on the recommendation of a former member of the Albany Road Board who lived in the area, after Ellerker in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The reasons for the omission of the first \\"r\\" are not known. The townsite includes several houses, a general store, oval, town hall, railway siding as mentioned and a telephone booth. Its close proximity to Mutton Bird Beach and the Elleker-Grasmere Road see the townsite experience tourism fluctuations over the summer months.

It was formerly a ferry port, until an undersea tunnel, the V√°gatunnilin, was built from V√°gar to Kv√≠v√≠k and Stykki√∞ further south on Streymoy. The cliffs west of Vestmanna, Vestmannabj√∏rgini, are very popular for excursions by boat. A 'Vestmann' was a \\"Westman\\", or Gael in Old Norse. The original name was Vestmannahavn, i.e. \\"Westmen's/Irishmen's harbour\\". History In December 1759, during the Seven Years' War, Fran√ßois Thurot's squadron sheltered from stormy conditions at Vestmanna. The lack of supplies available from the islanders motivated the subsequent raids by the squadron on the north Irish coast. Geography It is surrounded by the mountains of H√¶gstafjall (), √òkslin (), Loysingafjall (), and Moskurfjall (). Local power plant Tourism Vestmanna is often called the tourist village on the Faroe Islands. The main tourist attraction is Vestmannabj√∏rgini. In 2012 a camping site was established at Inni √° Fj√∏r√∞ with a capacity of 120 caravans in addition to tents.

It describes the respect of the ordinary British soldier for the bravery of the Hadendoa warriors who fought the British army in the Sudan and Eritrea. Background \\"Fuzzy-Wuzzy\\" was the term used by British soldiers for Beja warriors who were supporting the Mahdi of Sudan in the Mahdist War. The Beja people were one of several broad multi-tribal groupings supporting the Mahdi, and were divided into three tribes, Haddendowa, Halanga , Amarar beni Aamer Habab tribe and Bishariyyin. All of these are semi-nomadic and inhabit the Sudan's Red Sea Hills, Libyan Desert, and southern Egypt. The Beja provided a large number of warriors to the Mahdist forces. They were armed with swords and spears and some of them carried breech-loaded rifles which had been captured from the Egyptian forces, and some of them had acquired military experience in the Egyptian army. The poem Kipling's poem \\"Fuzzy-Wuzzy\\" praises the Hadendoa for their martial prowess, because \\"for all the odds agin' you, Fuzzy-Wuz, you broke the square\\". This could refer to either or both historical battles between the British and Mahdist forces where British infantry squares were broken. The first was at the Battle of Tamai, on 13 March 1884, and the second was on 17 January 1885 during the Battle of Abu Klea. Kipling's narrator, an infantry soldier, speaks in admiring terms of the \\"Fuzzy-Wuzzies\\", praising their bravery which, although insufficient to defeat the British, did at least enable them to boast of having \\"broken the square\\"‚Äîan achievement which few other British foes could claim. Writing in The Atlantic in June 2002, Christopher Hitchens noted \\"[Yet] where Kipling excelled‚Äîand where he most deserves praise and respect‚Äîwas in enjoining the British to avoid the very hubris that he had helped to inspire in them. His 'Recessional' is only the best-known and most hauntingly written of many such second thoughts. ... There is also 'The Lesson', a poem designed to rub in the experience of defeat in Africa, and (though it is abysmal as poetry) 'Fuzzy- Wuzzy', a tribute to the fighting qualities of the Sudanese.\\" Other references T. S. Eliot included the poem in his 1941 collection A Choice of Kipling's Verse. In the Tintin book The Crab with the Golden Claws, \\"Fuzzy- Wuzzy\\" is one of the epithets Captain Haddock shouts at his enemies. In the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Caractacus Potts' father refers to the \\"Fuzzy- Wuzzys\\" when speaking of his time in the army. Additionally, in the BBC situation comedy Dad's Army, Lance Corporal Jones (Clive Dunn) continually refers to the Fuzzy-Wuzzies in his reminiscences about his days fighting in the Sudan under General Kitchener. In the film The Four Feathers (1939), when the camp of the Mahdi supporters is shown (at 49.35 min.) a title appears: THE KALIPHA'S ARMY OF DERVISHES AND FUZZY WUZZIES ON THE NILE. Also, towards the end of the film (1:52.40 min.) the old General states: \\"All you boys had to do was deal with Fuzzy-Wuzzy.\\" In the 1964 film Zulu, Michael Caine's character states before the Battle of Rorke's Drift that \\"If the Fuzzies moved out from Isandlwana immediately, they could be here, well, now\\". Did British soldiers use the term 'Fuzzies' before 1883? During the hard fought Kokoda Track campaign during World War II, Australian soldiers called the local Papuan stretcher bearers \\"Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels\\".

Formerly part of the historic Duchy of Savoy, it was annexed by the French Republic in 1792. By the Treaty of Vienna 1815, it combined with the island of Sardinia to form a state officially known as the Kingdom of Sardinia. However, Turin was the capital and Piedmont, one of the most dynamic nations of 19th century Europe, is the name generally used by historians. The island of Sardinia was very much the junior partner. Piedmont's most prominent figure was Count Camillo Cavour (1810‚Äì61), the statesman who inspired and forged the unification of Italy under Piedmont's leadership. Stamps were issued in Turin on 1 January 1851 but do not show the country's name. The first stamps of unified Italy, issued in 1862, were also printed in Turin. In the catalogues, Gibbons list the Piedmont/Sardinia stamps under Sardinia. This is strictly correct but, in view of the historical prominence of Piedmont, this work follows the accepted practice of most historians. The relative insignificance of the island of Sardinia is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that Cavour, although a noted traveller, never actually visited it! ;Dates : 1851 ‚Äì 1862 ;Capital : Turin ;Currency : 100 centesimi = 1 lira ;Refer : Italian States ;See also : Sardinia  Pietersburg  ;Dates : 1901 only ;Currency : 12 pence = 1 shilling; 20 shillings = 1 pound ;Refer : Transvaal  Pirate Coast  ;Refer : Trucial States  Piscopi  ;Refer : Telos  Pitcairn Islands  ;Dates : 1940 ‚Äì ;Capital : Adamstown ;Currency : (1940) 12 pence = 1 shilling; 20 shillings = 1 pound : (1968) 100 cents = 1 dollar ;Main Article Needed :  Plebiscite Issues  ;Main Article Needed : ;Includes : Allenstein; : Carinthia; : East Silesia; : Marienwerder; : Slesvig, 1920, issued by Commission Interalli√©e Slesvig; : Upper Silesia References Bibliography * Stanley Gibbons Ltd, Europe and Colonies 1970, Stanley Gibbons Ltd, 1969 * Stanley Gibbons Ltd, various catalogues * Stuart Rossiter & John Flower, The Stamp Atlas, W H Smith, 1989 * XLCR Stamp Finder and Collector's Dictionary, Thomas Cliffe Ltd, c.1960 External links * AskPhil ‚Äì Glossary of Stamp Collecting Terms * Encyclopaedia of Postal History Packhoi ","title":"Compendium of postage stamp issuers (Pa‚ÄìPl)"},{"id":"2519380","text":"Radiator is the second studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Super Furry Animals.

The three enclaves of Goa (1505), Damao (1531) and Diu (1534) were annexed to collectively form the colony of Portuguese India. Goa, including the capital Pangim (now Panaji), is on the Malabar Coast of SW India, roughly midway between Bombay and Bangalore. Damao (now called Daman) is on the west coast, at the entrance to the Gulf of Cambay, about 100 miles north of Bombay. Diu, which includes the towns of Diu and Simbor, is a small island (15 sq. miles) off the south coast of Kathiawar peninsula in western India. The first stamps were issued 1 October 1871. Stamps of British India were also valid until 1877. Standard Portuguese types such as the Ceres issue were used until 1925 when specific types began to be produced. All stamps were inscribed INDIA in some way; from 1946, the inscription was usually ESTADO DA INDIA. In 1950, newly independent India demanded the transfer of the Portuguese territories but Portugal refused. India set up a land blockade in 1954 and then annexed the territories on 17 December 1961. Stamps of India were introduced on 29 December 1961.

The university existed for a few decades, then split into two schools, one of jurisprudence and one of theology in the course of the 15th century. The university was completely discontinued during Ottoman occupation, then restarted in 1785 by Joseph II moving the Royal Academy from Gy≈ër to Pecs. In 1802 the Royal Academy was moved back to Gy≈ër by the order of Francis I, and higher education was discontinued in Pecs until 1833, when the bishop of Pecs in conjunction with the city senate founded the Pecs Academy, comprising a legal and a philosophical faculty. The modern University of P√©cs was founded in 1912, and was originally located in Pozsony (now Bratislava, Slovakia). Following World War I Pozsony became part of the newly formed Czechoslovakia. In 1921, the university moved to P√©cs, where it remained to this day. In 1951 the medical faculty was separated from the university, and till 2000 was a separate institution. The university was renamed Janus Pannnonius University in 1982.

The Elisabeth University of Sciences had four faculties (Arts, Law, Medicine and Theology) with several outstanding professors teaching in the Medical School (P√°l Heim, B√©la Entz, G√©za Mansfeld, just to mention a few of them). In 1951 the Medical School became a separate, independent institution under the name of the Medical University of P√©cs. It underwent substantial infrastructural development in the 1960s and 1970s: the new clinical and basic science blocks were built during this period. Besides the general medicine program, training in dentistry and pharmacy were launched in 1973 and 2001. Meanwhile, the English Program in General Medicine was implemented in 1984, the first medical education program of its kind in Central Europe. A similar German Program was initiated in 2004.  School shooting  A shooting occurred at the University of P√©cs in November 2009. A student died in the shooting and three were wounded. The perpetrator was a first year pharmacy student.

Widely regarded as one of Australian football's finest centre half-backs, despite suffering numerous injuries, Knights was recognized for his contribution to the game when he was among the inaugural inductees into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996Players in the Australian Football Hall of Fame and later in the Hawthorn Team of the Century.Hawthorn Team of the Century  Playing career  Knights was raised on a dairy farm in Longwarry, where he played for the local football club and attended school in neighbouring Drouin. In his first two seasons at , Knights would get a taxi to training, then on the weekends would be driven to games by his parents. To make it easier for him to play without having to make long commutes to and from home, Knights was billeted with a family in Melbourne and finished his education at Camberwell High School. He was in his own words a \\"quiet and shy\\" country kid when he arrived at Hawthorn, and it would be champion rover Peter Crimmins who helped Knights settle in at the club. He became easily identifiable on the field with his blond hair and his ability to frequently take spectacular high marks. He was also a great exponent of the drop kick and the torpedo punt kick. After playing only five games in his debut season, Knights established himself in the first team in 1970. The following year he did so well in that position that he was chosen for Victoria, winning the Simpson Medal for the best on ground in the match against Western Australia in Perth. However, he missed out on Hawthorn's 1971 premiership success due to a knee injury. Knights was moved briefly to full-forward in 1972 after a serious knee injury to Peter Hudson forced Hawthorn to experiment in the position before finally settling on Michael Moncrieff. He actually finished as Hawthorn's leading goal-kicking with 46 goals, but was moved back to defence before the season was over. After injury problems restricted his 1973 season, for the next three years Knights was rated the best centre half-back in the game. In 1975, Knights finally had the chance to participate in the first of four Grand Finals. North Melbourne were too good on the day, winning their first-ever Premiership. Knights was Hawthorn's best player on the day, and capped off a fine personal year by winning the club Best and Fairest award. Knights' stellar form continued into 1976 before he suffered a broken collarbone early in the match against in Round 14, which ruled him out for the next seven matches. Despite this, Knights still managed to come second in the 1976 Brownlow Medal count, polling an astonishing 45 votes to finish three votes behind Essendon's Graham Moss. He shrugged off that disappointment to be one of Hawthorn's best players in the 1976 VFL Grand Final triumph, later joining some of his teammates at Peter Crimmins' bedside. From 1977 onwards Knights was frequently rested up forward to reduce the risk of injuries, but still did enough great work at centre half-back to finish one vote behind Malcolm Blight in the 1978 Brownlow Medal count. He would shrug off the disappointment of finishing runner-up in the Brownlow by starring in the 1978 VFL Grand Final. After being knocked out while playing in defence, Knights was moved forward in the last quarter, where he took a series of fine marks and kicked two goals to help secure Hawthorn's fourth Premiership. During his stellar 1978 season Knights also claimed his second Simpson Medal with a dominant display for Victoria against WA in Perth. The litany of injuries that Knights had suffered through his career began to catch up with him, and from 1979 to 1981, he played in only 26 out of a possible 66 games. Amid rumours of retirement, Knights rebounded to play impressive football in his final years. In 1983, he booted six goals in the Qualifying Final to guide Hawthorn to a thrilling four-point win against Fitzroy, and was again among the best players on the field as the Hawks crushed in the Grand Final. Knights reached the 250-game milestone the following season against , gathering 23 possessions and kicking two goals, but a knee injury restricted him to just three further games. In 1985, Knights showed traces of brilliant form ‚Äì kicking nine goals against in Round 10. The Preliminary Final against would turn out to be his final VFL game. He had just four disposals, and was dropped for the Grand Final, a surprising decision for some people, given his reputation as a performer on the VFL's biggest stage. Yet again, Knights would bounce back from the disappointment to finish his career in a semblance of style, kicking a bag of goals to help Hawthorn defeat Carlton in the reserves Grand Final.  Coaching career  Although Knights enjoyed spectacular success on the field, it was a different story as a coach. However, it should also be remembered that he was in charge of teams that were either relatively new and inexperienced (Brisbane), or undergoing restructuring (Hawthorn). In 1986, the VFL decided to expand and include one team each from Western Australia and Queensland. The Brisbane Bears, based on the Gold Coast in South East Queensland, recruited Knights as their inaugural coach, despite his lack of coaching experience. The club won their first game, and although expectations of the new side were low, it was considered a significant achievement that the team was able to avoid finishing last in their first season. Despite this, the Bears' results in 1988 and 1989 failed to improve, with the club suffering regular thrashings. Besides the substandard quality of the training and playing facilities, lack of assistance from the VFL, and squad disharmony, Knights also had limited control over team selection; part way through the 1988 VFL season, he wanted star signing Warwick Capper dropped from the senior team due to poor form, but was overruled by club president Paul Cronin. Knights was dismissed as coach with seven games remaining in the 1989 seasonShock and tears at golden boy's demise and replaced with team psychologist, Paul Feltham. Knights was considered to have been unlucky, as ineffective club management and poor relationships amongst his underperforming players seen as major contributing factors in the club's performance. After a brief coaching stint at Tasmanian club Devonport from 1990 to 1993, Knights returned to Hawthorn as senior coach for the 1994 AFL season. He managed to lead the team into the finals series, but were knocked out by in the first final. The following year the team finished second last, however, and Knights was again sacked. In 2009, Knights was appointed senior representative coach of the Victorian Country Football League and held the position until 2016.

He divorced and remarried Angela, a schoolteacher, and had two daughters, Sarah (born 1993) and Rebecca. In February 2015, Knights publicly revealed that Sarah had been struggling with a mystery illness that left her confined to a wheelchair. Sarah and her mother flew to Germany for specialist treatment, where a diagnosis of Lyme disease was confirmed. They returned to Melbourne later in the year to commence intensive rehabilitation.

Brachiosaurids had long necks that enabled them to access the leaves of tall trees that other sauropods would have been unable to reach. In addition, they possessed thick spoon-shaped teeth which helped them to consume tough plants more efficiently than other sauropods. They have also been characterized by a few unique traits or synapomorphies; dorsal vertebrae with 'rod-like' transverse processes and an ischium with an abbreviated pubic peduncle. Brachiosaurus is one of the best-known members of the Brachiosauridae, and was once thought to be the largest land animal to ever live. Brachiosaurids thrived in the regions which are now North and South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. They first appear in the fossil record in the Late Jurassic Period and disappear in the late Early Cretaceous Period. The broad distribution of Brachiosauridae in both northern and southern continents suggests that the group originated prior to the breakup of Pangaea. In the Early Cretaceous the distribution of the group is dramatically reduced. It is still unclear whether this reduction is due to local extinctions or to the limited nature of the Early Cretaceous fossil record. Brachiosauridae has been defined as all titanosauriforms that are more closely related to Brachiosaurus than to Saltasaurus. It is one of the three main groups of the clade Titanosauriformes, which also includes the Euhelopodidae and the Titanosauria. Description The Brachiosauridae are composed of quadrupedal dinosaurs that are generally very large, with the exception of the possible insular dwarf Europasaurus. The brachiosaurids can be distinguished from other macronarian taxa by their broad, thick and spoon-shaped teeth. Their maxillary teeth were twisted apically, at the top, and the shape of these teeth was optimal for biting off resistant vegetation. While brachiosaurids, like other sauropods, did not perform significant food processing in their mouths, their teeth enabled them to slice through food instead of having to pull it off of tree branches. Evidence for this precision shearing consists of apical wear facets on the teeth and distinctive bone structure that suggests orthal, vertical, jaw action. Typical brachiosaurid teeth, i.c. those of Vouivria In addition, the characteristic long necks of brachiosaurids are distinct from those of other long-necked dinosaur taxa. They possessed a narrow neck composed of twelve to thirteen extremely long cervical vertebrae that was laterally inflexible and dorsoventrally, vertically, flexible. This meant that brachiosaurids could angle their necks up and lift their heads, enabling them to graze from treetops up to a height of about fourteen meters. It has been argued that other sauropods lacked this dorsoventral flexibility and that their necks stretched outwards in front of them instead of upwards. Brachiosaurids have more often been found in the conifer-rich sites, like the Tendaguru, than in the Morrison deposits, suggesting that their fitness was increased by the presence of taller conifer food sources. However, the giant size and long necks of brachiosaurids meant that they required tremendous pressure to bring oxygenated blood to their brains. It has been proposed that sauropods possessed a four-chambered double pump heart, with one pump for oxygenated and one pump for deoxygenated blood. As in all Macronaria, the forelimbs of brachiosaurids are long relative to the hindlimbs, but this trait is more pronounced in brachiosaurids. The forelimbs were very slender for a sauropod and the metacarpal bones of the forelimb were elongated. These adaptations overall increased the stride length of the forelimbs, arguably resulting in an uneven gait. However, it was previously argued that they were hindlimb dominant like other sauropods, and thus had the ability to rear up on their hindlimbs. Based on the structure of their legs, making it impossible for them to run, it is likely that they moved about in a low walking speed (20‚Äì40 km/day), but were capable of moving faster when necessary, up to 20‚Äì30 km/hour, depending on leg length. Brachiosaurids shared synapomorphies, new traits typical for the group. They possessed middle and rear back vertebrae with long, 'rod-like' transverse processes. In the pelvis, the ischium had a shortened pubic peduncle, the contact surface with the pubic bone. Their humeri, upper arm bones, had a large deltopectoral crest. Their skull roofs showed wide supratemporal fenestrae, openings for the muscles. They had neural arches placed more on front of the vertebrae, shoulder blades that were expanded at the top end, irregularly shaped coracoids in the shoulder girdle, and triangular projections on the underside of the front branch of their quadratojugal bones at the lower rear corner of the skull.  History of findings  = Changing classifications = Brachiosaurus humerus bone In 1903, Elmer Samuel Riggs described and named Brachiosaurus. In 1904, he created a new sauropod family, the Brachiosauridae.Riggs, E.S. 1904. \\"Structure and relationships of opisthocoelian dinosaurs. Part II, the Brachiosauridae\\". Field Columbian Museum, Geological Series 2 6: 229-247 He published a complete description of the phenotype after examining the humerus, femur, coracoid, and sacrum of the Brachiosaurus holotype that had been prepared at the Field Columbian Museum. Since then, the classification of these sauropods has been through many changes. Marsh's multifamily theory of sauropod classification prevailed until 1929, when Werner Janensch proposed a two-family theory based on differences in sauropod teeth. Macronarians with broad, spatulate teeth, were placed in the family Brachiosauridae, while sauropods with more slender and peg-shaped teeth were considered titanosaurids. This put diplodocids and titanosaurids together in one group based on their similar teeth, despite the many other differences between the taxa. Today, about four to five groups within the Macronaria are considered families (with names ending in ~). In 1997, Salgado, Coria and Calvo studied the traits that had been used to set the Brachiosauridae apart and determined that they were in fact plesiomorphic, original, for all basal Titanosauriformes. They proposed that some characteristics that had been used to differentiate Brachiosaurus were synapomorphies for the Titanosauriformes as a whole. They concluded that the family Brachiosauridae was actually a \\"grade\\" of not specially related primitive titanosauriforms, and not a stable separate clade. They partly based this conclusion on similar humerus:femur length ratios known for titanosauriforms, basal titanosaurs, and more basal sauropods. However, in 1998 Sereno & Wilson published data contrary to the conclusions in Salgado et al.'s article, indicating that the Brachiosauridae were a separate clade in the Titanosauriformes. After 1998, new brachiosaurid species have been named, generally confirming that the Brachiosauridae were a natural group. = Important findings = In 1943, de Lapparent described the \\"French Bothriospondylus\\" from the Oxfordian of France which dates to the Late Jurassic, which was identified in 2013 by Philip Mannion as a brachiosaurid and named Vouivria damparisensis in 2017. This specimen represents the oldest undisputed record of the brachiosaurid group. The following diagram is a timeline of important brachiosaurid discoveries, the date given being that of the naming of the genus. The actual excavation was often much earlier, in the case of Vouivria eighty-three years and of Duriatitan at least 136 years.

from the Late Jurassic Period to the Early Cretaceous, from about 157 to 93 million years ago. In addition, Macronaria in general first appear in the Late Jurassic. However, the almost simultaneous appearance of Camarasaurus, Brachiosaurus, and a possible titanosaur suggest that they originated earlier, closer to the Mid-Jurassic. Trackway evidence also supports a Middle Jurassic origin for titanosaurs, which implies the same for all neosauropods. Brachiosaurids in particular have a broad distribution dating to the Late Jurassic. Late Jurassic specimens have been discovered in the northern and southern Hemispheres, including North America, Africa, Europe, and South America. This suggests that brachiosaurids originated in the Middle Jurassic, prior to the breakup of Pangaea, followed by diversification and dispersal that resulted in the global spread present in the Late Jurassic. This conclusion is further supported by paleogeographic data. While many Late Jurassic dinosaur remains have been found in China, no brachiosaurid remains have been uncovered in East Asia. This would support the Middle Jurassic origin theory since East Asia was separated from the rest of Pangaea by water from the late Middle Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous. While brachiosaurids were widely dispersed in the Late Jurassic, their geographic distribution narrowed in the Early Cretaceous. So far, brachiosaurid specimens have only been found in the Aptian-Albian region of North America. This reduction in distribution occurs immediately following the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary. The brachiosaurid distribution in the Early Cretaceous has been interpreted as a result of regional extinctions in Europe, Africa, and South America. Overall, the Early Cretaceous seems to be a time of reduced sauropod diversity worldwide. It has been argued that this change may be due to an extinction event at the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary. A second hypothesis is that the apparent lack of geographical diversity is due to sampling bias in the generally poor Early Cretaceous fossil record. Recently discovered evidence supports the conclusion that brachiosaurids existed outside of North America in lower latitudes of Gondwana in the Early Cretaceous. In 2013, Mannion et al. reported on the discovery of two isolated teeth found in Lebanon from the Early Cretaceous that possess posteriorly twisted crowns, which are characteristic of the brachiosaurids Giraffatitan and Abydosaurus. In addition, a brachiosaurid named Padillasaurus leivaensis was discovered in Colombia from the Early Cretaceous and placed in the Brachiosauridae taxon, which suggests that Brachiosauridae survived in northwestern Gondwana after the Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary. In the Early Cretaceous, Colombia was located close to the equator in northwestern Gondwana while Lebanon was in the northeast of Gondwana. This suggests that brachiosaurids were in fact present outside of North America in the Early Cretaceous, and supports the theory that the apparent lack of specimens is due to an incomplete record. However, the rarity of these dinosaur specimens may also reflect a decrease in abundance of brachiosaurids acting in combination with the poor fossil record. Also, in 2017 a study indicated that Padillasaurus was not a brachiosaurid but a basal member of the Somphospondyli. Classification Brachiosauridae is one of the two major clades of Titanosauriformes, a diverse group of sauropods that existed in the Late Jurassic and Cretaceous in Laurasia and Gondwana. Europasaurus is considered the most basal brachiosaurid. Titanosauriformes was a globally distributed, long-lived clade of dinosaurs that contained both the largest and smallest known sauropods. This clade was composed of three distinct groups: Brachiosauridae, a mix of Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous sauropods, Euhelopodidae, a group of mid-Cretaceous East Asian sauropods, and Titanosauria, a large Cretaceous clade located mostly in Gondwana. Traditionally, Brachiosauridae included Brachiosaurus and some other suggestively assigned genera. Following the generic separation of Brachiosaurus species into B. altithorax and Giraffatitan brancai these have sometimes been the only members supported by cladistic analysis.

The band has been influenced by many musical groups along with folk units Garmarna, Stille Volk and Estonian folk/classical music composer Veljo Tormis. Much of their material, featuring flutes and other traditional Estonian instruments, is based on the wars for independence of the 13th and 14th centuries.  History  Metsat√∂ll started playing together on 24 February 1999 as a three-piece (Markus ‚Äì vocals and guitar, Factor ‚Äì drums, Andrus ‚Äì bass), playing epic heavy metal with small influences from ancient Estonian folklore. The debut album called \\"Terast mis hangund me hinge\\" (\\"Steel frozen in our souls\\") was released at that time. In the end of 1999, a good friend Varulven joined the band. So far he had observed the activities of the band and had from time to time joined them on stage. Varulven had self- taught himself a number of ancient Estonian folk instruments and together it was realized that metal and old Estonian folk fit together perfectly. Since then, the music of Metsat√∂ll has intertwined more and more with old Estonian runo-singing and traditional melodies. 2001 was a difficult year for the band, since their bass player Andrus left the band, deciding to attend more to his personal affairs, and considering the band too much of a burden. A new bass player, KuriRaivo, was found after a couple of months. In 2002 Metsat√∂ll released the single \\"Hundi loomine\\" ('The Creation of the Wolf'), for which a video was also shot (directed by Liina Paakspuu). Hundi loomine received numerous exceptionally positive reviews and commentaries in the local media, there was talk of the true mind of the Estonians, the destruction of the negative effects of the English language and the rebirth of folklore through contemporary means and people. In the beginning of 2004 drummer Factor dedicated himself completely to science and he was replaced by Atso. In late 2004, Metsat√∂ll released their second album, called Hiiekoda (My Home, My Sacred Grove), which was critically acclaimed by both metal and non-metal fans from all over Estonia. It is a heavy metal album strongly combined with old Estonian traditional instruments. In 2005, Metsat√∂ll released a remake of their old album Terast mis hangund me hinge called Terast mis hangunud me hinge 10218. The number stands for the world's age according to Estonian chronology. It is much more influenced by folk music and done in a much more professional way in general. They have also released a live album called Lahinguv√§ljal n√§eme, raisk! (See you on the battlefield, sod/bastard!). In 2009, Metsat√∂ll signed the Finnish record label Spinefarm Records. A new album, titled √Ñio was released on 3 March in Estonia and Finland. An Internet single, along with the video to a song from the album, called \\"Vaid Vaprust\\" was released on 13 January. The video used fragments of the 1980 animated film Suur T√µll by J√ºri Arrak. In 2011, Metsat√∂ll released another album called Ulg. The first song released was Kivine Maa and a video was made for K√º√º. The album was nominated for the Estonian Music Awards in the \\"Metal Album of the Year\\" category. In 2012, Metsat√∂ll played on the main stage of the Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in Helsinki. They later released a concert album called Tuska from the same performance.

For example, a Hiiekoda is a type of (usually wooden) sacral building constructed near or in a forest considered holy in the pre-Christianisation customs of Estonians. While the word Suteksk√§ija does mean Werewolf, the Estonian werewolf legends are considerably different from those known in Anglophone countries, and this particular word has an emphasis on the human aspect of the person involved, so a better (although not as catchy) translation might be One who regularly engages in werewolf business. The name Raua needmine is a reference to a work of the same name by Veljo Tormis. The latter's name is sometimes translated as Curse Upon Iron in English. =Timeline=  References   External links  * Official Site * Category:Estonian folk metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1998 Category:Musical quartets ","title":"Metsat√∂ll"},{"id":"2519487","text":"The main visitors' building of the Lagoon The Blue Lagoon pools in front of the geothermal plant. The Blue Lagoon () is a geothermal spa in southwestern Iceland. The spa is located in a lava field near Grindav√≠k and in front of Mount √ûorbj√∂rn on Reykjanes Peninsula, in a location favourable for geothermal power, and is supplied by water used in the nearby Svartsengi geothermal power station. The Blue Lagoon is approximately from Keflav√≠k International Airport, and is one of the most visited attractions in Iceland. Description The water's milky blue shade is due to its high silica content. The silica forms soft white mud on the bottom of the lake which bathers rub on themselves. The water is also rich in salts and algae. The water temperature in the bathing and swimming area of the lagoon averages . Guests are required to shower prior to using the geothermal spa. The communal showers are split up by gender. Children age 8 and under are only allowed entry with the use of arm floaters, provided free of charge. The lagoon is not suitable for children under the age of 2 years. The lagoon is accessible for wheelchair users with a ramp that extends into the water and a shower chair. There is also a private changing room available for those with special needs.  History  =Water source= The lagoon is man-made. The water is a byproduct from the nearby geothermal power plant Svartsengi where superheated water is vented from the ground near a lava flow and used to run turbines that generate electricity. After going through the turbines, the steam and hot water passes through a heat exchanger to provide heat for a municipal water heating system. Then the water is fed into the lagoon. The rich mineral content is provided by the underground geological layers and pushed up to the surface by the hot water (at about pressure and temperature) used by the plant. Because of its mineral concentration, water cannot be recycled and must be disposed of in the nearby landscape, a permeable lava field that varies in thickness from to . After the minerals have formed a deposit, the water reinfiltrates the ground, but the deposits render the ground impermeable over time, so the plant needs to continuously dig new ponds in the nearby lava field. The water renews every 2 days. The average pH is 7.5 and the salt content is 2.5%. Very few organisms live in the water apart from some blue-green algae, despite the water not being artificially disinfected it contains no fecal bacteria, environmental bacteria, fungi, or plants. = Baths = Shortly after the opening of the Svartsengi power plant in 1976, the runoff water had made pools. In 1981, a psoriasis patient bathed in the water and noted that the water alleviated his symptoms and the lagoon subsequently became popular. Bathing facilities opened in 1987 and in 1992 the Blue Lagoon company was established. Studies made in the 1990s confirmed that the lagoon had a beneficial effect on the skin disease psoriasis. A psoriasis clinic was opened in 1994 and in 1995, the Blue Lagoon company began marketing skin products containing silica, algae, and salt. The lagoon recorded 1.3 million visitors in 2017, up from 919,000 visitors in 2015. The company had a revenue of ‚Ç¨102 million and a profit of ‚Ç¨31 million in 2017. It has over 600 employees. The entry fee is from $64.  In popular culture  The Blue Lagoon was used as the Pit Stop for the first leg of The Amazing Race 6. The Blue Lagoon was used for the thermal spa scenes in the filming of Hostel: Part II. It was also shown in the Incubus documentary Look Alive, when the band visited Iceland, in the fifth cycle of Britain's Next Top Model which used as photoshoot location as well as Keeping Up with the Kardashians. In 2020 the Blue Lagoon was included in an episode of the Netflix show ‚ÄòDown to Earth with Zac Efron‚Äô.

Edithburgh is about west of Adelaide across Gulf St Vincent, but away by road. At the 2016 census, the locality had a population of 516 of which 454 lived in its town centre. Edithburgh is in the Yorke Peninsula Council, the South Australian House of Assembly electoral district of Narungga and the Australian House of Representatives Division of Grey. History In the Narangga language of the indigenous Narungga people, Edithburgh was known by the place name Pararmarati.Tindale, Norman B., 1936. Notes on the Natives of Southern portion of Yorke Peninsula, S.A.. Proc. of Royal Soc. of Aust., vol 60., pp 55-70. Some sources give the pronunciation 'Barram-marrat-tee'. The first European pioneers arrived in the 1840s and were sheep graziers and pastoralists. With closer settlement, in 1869 the Marine Board fixed a site for a jetty to service the developing farming district. An adjacent town was then surveyed, the layout closely emulating (on a smaller scale) that of Adelaide, with a belt of parklands. Edithburgh was named by Governor Sir James Fergusson after his wife Edith. The new jetty opened in 1873.Collins, Neville: The Jetties of South Australia, (Adelaide 2010) 2019 November Fires November 2019, the authorities have confirmed at least 11 homes have been destroyed or damaged in the fires burning in the Yorke Peninsula. It was reported by 9 News (Australia) that the rapid spread of the dangerous blaze has been halted. However authorities warn the blaze was yet to be contained as of the date of the 21st. It was that in mind that with a stubble fire threatened Edithburgh, Coobowie and Wool Bay early today as it burnt towards the coast, fanned by strong south-westerly winds. At the height of the emergency, Yorke Peninsula Council Mayor Darren Braund said many residents had taken shelter overnight in the Edithburgh Town Hall but had been told to leave. Industries Edithburgh originally developed as a port for servicing the pastoralist pioneers. In the 1870s grain farming became a mainstay of the local economy, which it still is. At the turn of the 20th Century additional industries were established in the form of gypsum mining and salt refining. There are vast salt lakes in the area, from which salt was scraped and exported as far as Russia. Among those refineries was the Standard Salt Company, operated by C.T. McGlew. The jetty became a busy hub for exporting these commodities, as well as unloading supplies. Nowadays the jetty is used mostly for recreational fishing and is a popular scuba diving site. There is also a small fishing and prawning fleet based there. The town is now overshadowed by the 55 wind turbines of the Wattle Point Wind Farm, located southwest of the town and opened in April 2005. Tourism Occupying a commanding position on the coastline at semi-circular Salt Creek Bay, Edithburgh is noted for its magnificent seascapes which include steep rocky cliffs and sandy beaches. Troubridge Island can be seen offshore. As a result, tourism is now a growth industry. It is a popular holiday destination with a variety of accommodation types available including a caravan park. The Troubridge Hotel and the Edithburgh Hotel sit diagonally opposite each other at the intersection of Blanche and Edith Streets, both named after Governor Fergusson's daughters. For those who prefer not to swim in the open sea, the town has a unique seawater swimming pool constructed at the shoreline. Its sheltered waters are refreshed with each rising tide.\\"Edithburgh\\" Country Getaways (accessed 2013-12-14)  Diving and snorkelling  leftthumb276x276px Edithburgh Jetty, Gulf St Vincent, South Australia Many divers, scientists and marine conservationists list Edithburgh jetty as one of South Australia's premier shore-dive locations.

While it is considered distinct from hydrotherapy, there are some overlaps in practice and in underlying principles. Balneotherapy may involve hot or cold water, massage through moving water, relaxation, or stimulation. Many mineral waters at spas are rich in particular minerals such as silica, sulfur, selenium, and radium. Medicinal clays are also widely used, a practice known as 'fangotherapy'. Definition and characteristics The statue of \\"A man breaking a walking crutch\\" in the spa town Pie≈°≈•any (Slovakia) - an eloquent symbol of balneotherapy. \\"Balneotherapy\\" is the practice of immersing a subject in mineral water or mineral-laden mud; it is part of the traditional medicine of many cultures and originated in hot springs, cold water springs, or other sources of such water, like the Dead Sea. Presumed effect on diseases Treatment bath at a spa in Hot Springs, Arkansas, United States Balneotherapy may be recommended for a wide range of illnesses, including arthritis, skin conditions and fibromyalgia. Balneotherapy should be discussed in advance with a physician before beginning treatment, since a number of conditions, like heart disease and pregnancy, can result in a serious adverse effect. Scientific studies into the effectiveness of balneotherapy do not show that balneotherapy is effective for treating rheumatoid arthritis. There is also no evidence indicating a more effective type of bath, or to indicate that bathing is more effective than exercise, relaxation therapy, or mudpacks. Most of the studies on balneotherapy have methodological flaws and are not reliable. A 2009 review of all published clinical evidence concluded that existing research is not sufficiently strong to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of balneotherapy. \\"Balneophototherapy\\" combines salt bathing (balneotherapy) and exposure to ultraviolet B-light (UVB) as a potential treatment for severe, chronic plaque psoriasis. A Cochrane review found low- quality evidence that salt bathing combined with UVB may relieve psoriasis severity compared to UVB treatment only.

It was fought between Croatian police and armed forces from the Croatian Serb-established SAO Krajina at the Plitvice Lakes in Croatia, on 31 March 1991. The fighting followed the SAO Krajina's takeover of the Plitvice Lakes National Park and resulted in Croatia recapturing the area. The clash resulted in one killed on each side and contributed to the worsening ethnic tensions. The fighting prompted the Presidency of Yugoslavia to order the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) to step in and create a buffer zone between the opposing forces. The JNA arrived at the scene the following day and presented Croatia with an ultimatum requesting the police to withdraw. Even though the special police units which captured the Plitvice Lakes area did pull out on 2 April, a newly established Croatian police station, staffed by 90 officers, remained in place. The police station was blockaded by the JNA three months later, and captured in late August 1991. Background In 1990, following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija ‚Äì JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana ‚Äì TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina regions and eastern Croatia. They established a Serbian National Council in July 1990, to coordinate opposition to Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman's policy of pursuing independence for Croatia. Milan Babiƒá, a dentist from the southern town of Knin, was elected president. Knin's police chief, Milan Martiƒá, established paramilitary militias. The two men eventually became the political and military leaders of the SAO Krajina, a self-declared state incorporating the Serb-inhabited areas of Croatia. In the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, Croatia doubled the size of its police force to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000-strong special police that were deployed in 12 battalions adopting military organisation. In addition there were 9,000‚Äì10,000 regionally organised reserve police. The reserve police were set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but they lacked weapons. In an effort to consolidate territory under their control, Croatian Serb leaders organised a political rally at the Plitvice Lakes on 25 March 1991, demanding the area be annexed to the SAO Krajina. Three days later, on 28 March, SAO Krajina special police seized the area, and with the help of armed civilians, removed the Croatian management of the Plitvice Lakes National Park. The force deployed by the SAO Krajina to the Plitvice Lakes was estimated to be approximately 100-strong. The region was relatively sparsely populated and there was no obvious threat to Serbs there. Journalist Tim Judah suggests that the move may have been motivated by a desire to control a strategic road that ran north‚Äìsouth through the park, linking the Serb communities in the Lika and Banovina regions. Timeline Croatian police convoy after the ambush at the Plitvice Lakes, 31 March 1991 Croatia deployed special police forces, specifically the Luƒçko, Rakitje and Sljeme special police units based in and around Zagreb, supported by additional police forces drawn from Karlovac and Gospiƒá to retake the Plitvice Lakes area. The Croatian police force, commanded by Josip Luciƒá, used several buses and passenger cars, as well as an armoured personnel carrier, to approach the Plitvice Lakes area. The main 180-strong group of the Rakitje Special Police Unit (SPU), directly commanded by Luciƒá, arrived in dense fog, along the main road from Zagreb via the Korana River bridge. The bridge was secured by the Luƒçko unit shortly before midnight on 30/31 March 1991. An auxiliary force approached the Plitvice Lakes via Liƒçko Petrovo Selo, while the Kumrovec SPU was deployed in the area between the lakes and Gospiƒá, where it captured the Ljubovo Pass to secure the right flank of the main effort. The total attacking force comprised approximately 300 troops. The approaching convoy was ambushed at a barricade set up by the SAO Krajina force near Plitvice Lakes before 7:00 in the morning of Easter Sunday, 31 March 1991. The SAO Krajina force attacked the vehicles carrying the Croatian police and held their position until they fell back to the national park post office two and a half hours later. The Croatian advance, additionally hindered by deep snow, was achieved at a cost of six wounded. The attacking force secured its objectives by 11:00 am. As the attacking operation reached its completion, the Croatian military sustained its first combat fatality of the Croatian War of Independence, when Josip Joviƒá was killed by a machine gun covering retreating SAO Krajina troops. Shortly afterwards, the Yugoslav Air Force dispatched a Mil Mi-8 helicopter to attend to wounded on both sides, and it left the area after an hour and a half. The helicopter was dispatched by Colonel General Anton Tus, head of the Yugoslav Air Force at the time, following a request by Josip Boljkovac, Interior Minister of Croatia. As the fighting around Plitvice ended, sporadic gunfire was reported near Titova Korenica, to the south. The same afternoon, a Croatian police station was established at the Plitvice Lakes and Tomislav Iljiƒá was appointed its commanding officer. The station was staffed by approximately 90 police officers who were redeployed from Gospiƒá. The Presidency of Yugoslavia met in an emergency session the same evening to discuss the clash. At the insistence of Serbia's representative on the Presidency, Borisav Joviƒá, the JNA was ordered to intervene, gain control in the area and prevent further combat. The Serbian parliament also met in an emergency session, treating the clashes as a virtual casus belli and voting to offer the Krajina Serbs \\"all necessary help\\" in their conflict with Zagreb. The following day, the SAO Krajina adopted a resolution to the effect that the territory was incorporated into Serbia, whose constitution and laws were adopted for use in the Serb-held areas of Croatia. Croatian authorities accused Serbia's president, Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, of stage-managing the unrest in order to break Croatia's resolve to declare independence unless Yugoslavia was transformed into a loose confederation. They also accused him of attempting to coax the JNA to overthrow Croatian government. =JNA intervention= On 1 April, the JNA established a buffer zone to separate the belligerents at Plitvice Lakes, deploying elements of the 1st and the 5th Military Districts. Those were an armoured battalion of the 329th Armoured Brigade based in Banja Luka, a battalion of the 6th Mountain Brigade based in Delnice, a reconnaissance company and a mechanised battalion of the 4th Armoured Brigade based in Jastrebarsko and Karlovac, a battalion of the 306th Light Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment based in Zagreb, a signals company of the 367th Signals Regiment based in Samobor, a company of the 13th Military Police Battalion based in Rijeka and an anti-aircraft artillery battery drawn from the 13th Proletarian Motorised Brigade based in Rijeka. Finally, the 5th Military District set up a forward command post at the Plitvice Lakes. The JNA force at the Plitvice Lakes was commanded by Colonel Ivan ≈†timac. The commanding officer of the 5th Military District, Major General Andrija Ra≈°eta, in overall command of the JNA intervention, told the media that his men were not protecting either side and were there only to prevent ethnic confrontations for an indeterminate period. However, the Croatian government reacted furiously to the JNA move. Tuƒëman's aide, Mario Nobilo, claimed that the JNA had told Croatian officials that it would engage the police if they did not leave Plitvice. In a radio address, Tuƒëman said that the JNA would be regarded as a hostile army of occupation if its course of action remained unchanged. On 2 April, the JNA handed the Croatian authorities an ultimatum, requesting the police leave Plitvice. The special police left Plitvice the same day, but the 90 officers staffing the newly established police station remained in place. Aftermath Memorial to Josip Joviƒá, the first Croatian policeman killed in action Police officer Josip Joviƒá was the only Croatian fatality in the incident. The SAO Krajina force also suffered one killed in the fighting‚ÄîRajko Vukadinoviƒá, who was the first Croatian Serb combat fatality in the war. A total of 20 people were wounded, seven of whom were the Croatian police. The Croatian forces captured 29 SAO Krajina troops, 18 of whom were formally charged with insurgency. Among the prisoners was Goran Had≈æiƒá, later to become the President of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, although he was quickly released. Had≈æiƒá's release was explained as a goodwill gesture by the authorities, but Boljkovac claims he was released because he was collaborating with the Croatian authorities in 1991. Approximately 400 tourists, most of them Italian, were evacuated from the Plitvice Lakes after the fighting. The clash at the Plitvice Lakes worsened the overall situation in Croatia and led to an escalation of the conflict. Even though the Croatian and Serb forces were separated by the JNA at the Plitvice Lakes, the situation in the area continued to deteriorate following the clash. In nearby Pla≈°ki, Croatian police personnel left the local police station and were replaced by Serb officers. Both SAO Krajina and Croatian forces set up several roadblocks on the Saborsko‚ÄìLiƒçka Jasenica‚ÄìOgulin road. By summer, the blockades were extended to the north of Pla≈°ki and south of Saborsko, where Croatian authorities established another 30-strong police station on 2 April. Only JNA vehicles were permitted to pass the roadblocks, and that brought about a shortage of food, medicine and electricity in the area. On 2 May, the Serb Democratic Party, the ruling party in the SAO Krajina, organised a protest march to the Plitvice Lakes and a political rally demanding the Croatian police withdraw from Plitvice. The march, led by Babiƒá and Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj, was prevented from reaching the Plitvice Lakes by the JNA and forced to return to Titova Korenica. The JNA imposed a blockade of the Plitvice Lakes police station on 1 July, on the pretext that the Croatian police had abducted and imprisoned two JNA officers. By 6 July, the SAO Krajina forces and the JNA commenced attacks on the Ljubovo Pass southeast of the Plitvice Lakes, on the Titova Korenica‚ÄìGospiƒá road, driving the Croatian National Guard back and capturing the pass by the end of the month. Throughout the summer, the JNA continued to engage Croatian forces in Lika using the units deployed to the Plitvice Lakes in April. The fighting escalated further on 30 August, when the JNA captured the Plitvice Lakes police station and the following day when the Battle of Gospiƒá began. Joviƒá is largely viewed in Croatia as the first casualty of the Croatian War of Independence. A monument dedicated to him was erected in his birthplace of Ar≈æano in 1994. After the war, a monument was erected at the site of his death, where annual commemorations of the clash are held. The clash and Joviƒá's death are commemorated annually at the Plitvice Lakes.

The city was founded on the copper trade in the 3rd millennium BC. Its name in the 8th century BC was \\"Ed-di-al\\" as it appears on the Sargon Stele of 707 BC, and a little later on the nl:Prism of Esarhaddon. Recent excavations have uncovered major buildings on the site which are open to visitors. A new museum is also near to the site. History =The ancient city= Terracotta statue from Idalion, 7th or 6th century BC. Neues Museum, Berlin Idalion, Cup with mythological scenes, a sphinx frieze and the representation of a king vanquishing his enemies. Electrum, Cypro-Archaic I (8th‚Äì7th centuries BC). Louvre Museum The original inhabitants were natives of the island, known to scholars as the \\"Eteocypriotes\\". The original city lay on the northern side of the Gialias River in modern \\"Ayios Sozomenos\\". During the 13th century BC the people of Ed-di-al began manufacturing operations on the south side of the river in what is now modern Dhali. From there the city grew to the major urban and copper-trading centre founded by the Neo-Assyrians at the end of the 8th century BC. The city was the centre of the worship of the Great Goddess of Cyprus, the \\"Wanassa\\" or Queen of Heaven, known as Aphrodite and her consort the \\"Master of Animals\\". This worship appears to have begun in the 11th century BC and continued down through the Roman Period. The ancient city was located in the fertile Gialias valley and flourished there as an economic centre due to its location close to the mines in the eastern foothills of the Troodos Mountains and its proximity to the cities and ports on the south and east coast. Idalion prospered and became so wealthy that it was among the 11 cities of Cyprus listed on the Sargon Stele (707 BC) and first among the ten Cypriot kingdoms listed on the prism (many-sided tablet) of the Assyrian king Esarhaddon (680‚Äì669 BC). The city included two acropolises while houses were in the lower city. The fortified palace was built in 750-600 BC on Ampileri Hill, the west acropolis of the city, and rebuilt in 600-475 BC against attacks by Kition. The Temple of Athena was also located there. The east acropolis on Moutti tou Arvili Hill functioned as a sacred centre and included the Temples of Apollo, Aphrodite and of other gods. The lower city was also fortified, at least during the 5th c. BC. The first evidence of non-Cypriot presence (Greek, Phoenician, and others) appears in the Archaic Period (c. 550 BC) in Phoenician inscriptions found in the Adonis Temenos on the East Acropolis. Limestone head of a bearded worshiper, 475 and 450BC (British Museum) Idalion Tablet, (Cabinet des M√©dailles, Paris) Production by the mint dating from 535 BC shows the city's authority and prosperity. The fortified palace was also a sign of this prosperity as it is one of the few, and the largest known, in Cyprus. Column capital from palace The first Kings of Idalion were Greek as shown from coin inscriptions and the important Idalion Tablet. The tablet also shows that the last king, Stakyspros, was democratic in governing by decisions taken with a council of citizens and the resulting documented laws discovered in the temple of Athena. It also shows that there was a social welfare system during the sieges of the city by the Persians and Kitions of 478-470 BC. The king was the biggest landowner and borders of plots were registered. The city was conquered by Kition, a Phoenician city at that time, in about 450 BC. The palace became their administrative centre; the archive of tax payments was discovered here. Under Kition the city became the centre of a cult of Aphrodite and of the Helleno-Phoenician deity Resheph-Apollo. From 300 BC the palace and west acropolis were abandoned and the city became centered on the east acropolis, around the special sanctuaries for Aphrodite and Adonis which continued their importance. The city existed in Hellenistic and Roman times but its extent is not yet known. \\"Rosemary scented Idalium\\" appears in the poetry of Propertius and others as the place where Venus (or Aphrodite, the original pre-Greek Queen of Heaven) met Adonis (the original pre-Greek consort of the Queen of Heaven, or 'Lord'). =Cypro-Syllabic script= Cypro-Syllabic script (11th to 2nd century BC) was deciphered based on the Cypriot-Phoenician bilingual text of Idalion. Starting with the Cypriot-Phoenician bilingual text of Idalion (a dedication to the god Reshef Mikal ‚Äì identified as Apollo Amyklos ‚Äì 4th century BC), George Smith carried out a first attempt at interpretation in 1871, later developed and improved, thanks also to the Idalion Tablet, by the Egyptologist Samuel Birch (1872), the numismatist Johannes Brandis (1873), the philologists Moritz Schmidt, Wilhelm Deeke, Justus Siegismund (1874) and the dialectologist H.L. Ahrens (1876).Cypro-Syllabic script Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa Archaeology Fortified palace Young man from Idalion, Cypro-Archaic II (middle of the 6th century)(Louvre) The site is one of the few that was left undisturbed for centuries and therefore is ideal for archaeological investigation. In the 19th century Luigi Palma di Cesnola, U.S. consul, was brought ancient pots and limestone statuettes by residents of Dhali. He went there and claimed to have ‚Äúcleared‚Äù some 3,000 tombs after which three ships were loaded with antiquities, one of which sank in the Mediterranean, while the others reached New York to help found the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1868 R. Hamilton Lang, the British Consul, found an open-air sanctuary which he called the \\"Temple of Apollo\\" containing 142 limestone sculptures, now in the British Museum. From 1927, the Swedish Cyprus Expedition started its work on the island and did a lot of work at Idalium. On the western acropolis they excavated the remains of a fortification wall. They identified six different building periods. Periods 1‚Äì3 were dated to the Late Cypriote III, when the city kingdom of Idalion seems to have been formed. Periods 4‚Äì6 were considered to belong from Cypro- Geometric III to Cypro-Archaic II. Based on these assumptions, the earliest settlement on the acropolis could have begun around 1200 BC.Marie-Louise Winbladh, Idalion ‚Äì abode for the goddess of love and war.

Boundaries and formation Christiana Hundred is that portion of New Castle County that lies north of the Christina River and White Clay Creek, west of the Brandywine Creek and east of the Red Clay Creek, excepting that portion in the southeast included in Wilmington Hundred. Its northern boundary follows a portion of the 12 mile arc drawn around the town of New Castle. It was one of the original hundreds in Delaware created in 1682 and was named for the Christina River that flows along its southern boundary. When created it included some of the area now in Mill Creek Hundred, White Clay Hundred, and Pencader Hundred, all of which were split off in 1710. It also included much of the area now in Wilmington Hundred, which was split off 1833. Development While the northern half of the hundred remains the wooded and semi-rural ‚ÄúChateaux country‚Äù of country estates and expensive developments, the southern half is completely urban and suburban with almost continuous industrial, commercial and residential development. The southeastern portion was built out early in the twentieth century with the remainder in the decades following World War II. The towns of Elsmere and Newport, and Greenville Census Designated Places (CDP), and the community of Centreville are in Christiana Hundred. Geography Important geographical features, in addition to the Christiana River, White Clay Creek, Red Clay Creek, and Brandywine Creek, include the Hoopes Reservoir. It is mostly in the piedmont region, but the southern portion is below the eastern Fall Line and on the coastal plain. Transportation Important roads include portions of Interstate 95, Centre Road (Delaware Route 141), Kennett Pike (Delaware Route 52), Montchanin Road (Delaware Route 100), Lancaster Pike (Delaware Route 48), the Kirkwood Highway (Delaware Route 2), and the old main highway between Wilmington and Baltimore, now Maryland Avenue and its extension, Newport- Stanton Pike (Delaware Route 4). A portion of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, subsequently the main north-south line of the Pennsylvania Railroad, now Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, crosses through Newport, and a portion of the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, now CSX Transportation's Philadelphia Subdivision crosses through Elsmere. The East Penn Railroad runs from Elsmere generally along Montchanin Road and the Wilmington and Western Railroad runs along Red Clay Creek.

Marinus Vertregt reading in his home at Sliedrecht, Netherlands. Taken approximately 1972. Early life Vertregt was born in Dordrecht, Netherlands. After elementary school he attended the Higher Technical school there and took a course in sugar technology. In 1917 he departed for the Dutch East Indies (now called Indonesia) and was employed at several sugar factories of the Handels Vereeniging Amsterdam (H.V.A.) as a chemist, becoming a head chemist after three years. Afterwards he was employed in the plantations of the same company‚Äôs factories and became a director of the sugar estate of Minggiran in Java in 1935. In 1923 he married Hillegonda Hendrika van Donkelaar and in 1928 their daughter Angenita was born. In 1943, during the Second World War, Vertregt, his wife and his daughter were put in a Japanese internment camp, until their liberation in 1945. During this time he was separated from his family as Japanese camps were segregated between men and women. In 1947 he returned to Indonesia to take on the job of director of the biggest sugar factory in Java, Djatiroto. In 1950 he retired on a pension and repatriated. In 1951 he was asked by the H.V.A. to direct the founding of a sugar estate in Wonji, Ethiopia. After a year he was forced, to his regret, to retire owing to ill-health. Career in astronomy Returning to Holland, Vertregt sought other employment and in 1952 became director of the newly founded Institute for Technical Courses, a sister organisation of the Bond voor Materialenkennis (Society for the Knowledge of Materials). Beginning with 25 pupils, the Institute flourished and after a few years it had 2,600 pupils. From early youth Vertregt had been interested in astronomy and other sciences and soon after his repatriation he became interested in astronautics. In 1953 he became a member of the British Interplanetary Society (B.I.S.) and the Nederlandse Vereniging voor Ruimtevaart (Dutch Astronautical Society). In 1953 the American prof. dr. S.F. Singer released the idea of the Mouse (Minimum Orbital Unmanned Satellite Earth). Vertregt studied the design on request of the NVR. This lead in 1954 to a much improved design that was capable to circumvent the earth for a year! The new design, called Muis (Dutch for Mouse) would be using a four-step rocket and would stay in an orbit at a height of 500 km. In 1958 he was appointed Fellow of the BIS on account of several original scientific articles in the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society . In 1959 his book Grondbeginselen van de Ruimtevaart De Erven F. Bohn N.V., Haarlem, 1959, LC Control No.: 61023485 appeared, followed in 1960 by an English translation: Principles of AstronauticsElsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, New York, 1960, LC Control No.: 65013903 and in 1965 by a much enlarged second edition. At the date of the first edition, this book was the first to treat the whole field of astronautics in a succinct though scientific manner. A Russian(!) edition was also issued. In 1961 he was invited to attend the First International Symposium on Analytical Astrodynamics, which was held at the University of California. After the symposium he held a lecture on Interplanetary Orbits for personnel of Douglas Aircraft. In 1964, after 12 years as director of the institute, he retired permanently. In 1970 he was elected an Honorary Member of the Dutch Astronautical Society and in the same year an Honorary Member of the Bond voor Materialenkennis. He published many articles in the Journal of the B.I.S. and in the British periodical Spaceflight, as well as in Astronautica Acta and several Dutch periodicals. Furthermore he read papers for several international Astronautical Congresses. Through his education and career, Vertregt gained an incentive to take an interest in many sciences and arts. During his study at the Technical School at Dordrecht, where he learned mathematics, chemistry, physics and mechanical and chemical engineering, he studied Greek and Latin for himself in order to get a better understanding of the special features of these civilisations. From early youth he had learned English, French and German, and later in life he added Italian and Spanish. Moreover, from youth he had an absorbing interest in history and read widely in it and the history of art. In this manner he got a broad viewpoint on a vast terrain of human endeavour. Wanting to make this accumulated knowledge useful, he described the history of the civilisation of the countries of the Mediterranean and Western Europe in his book The Threefold Way. He also designed a Martian Calendar. Marinus Vertregt died in 1973 at Sliedrecht, Netherlands. In 1979 a lunar crater was named after him on request of the Dutch Astronautical Society.

It is located on the Loire river, upriver (northeast) from Blois and downriver from Orl√©ans. History 11 March 1152 the council of Beaugency annulled the marriage between Eleanor of Aquitaine and Louis VII. Aaron ben Joseph of Beaugency was a French Bible commentator and rabbinical scholar, who flourished in the twelfth century in the city. The lords of Beaugency attained considerable importance in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries; at the end of the 13th century they sold the fiefdom to the Crown. Afterward it passed to the house of Orl√©ans, then to those of Dunois and Longueville, and ultimately again to that of Orl√©ans. The city of Beaugency has been the site of numerous military conflicts. It was occupied on four separate occasions by the English. On June 16-17, 1429, it was the site of the famous Battle of Beaugency, when it was freed by Joan of Arc. Beaugency also played an important strategic role in the Hundred Years' War. It was burned by the Protestants in 1567 and suffered extensive damage to the walls, the castle, and the church. On the 8th, 9th and 10 December 1870, the Prussian army, commanded by the grand-duke of Mecklenburg, defeated the French army of the Loire, under General Chanzy, in the second battle of Beaugency (or Villorceau-Josnes). It was fought on the right bank of the Loire to the northwest of Beaugency. In 1940 and again in 1944, the city was bombed by Nazi Germany. On 16 September 1944, German Major General Botho Henning Elster and his 18 850 men and 754 officers surrendered at the Loire bridge of Beaugency to French r√©sistance. Population Economy Until 1846 Beaugency was an important commercial center due to trade along the Loire. After trade moved from the river to rail traffic, the city's role changed. Beaugency became a market center for the surrounding agricultural district. Today Beaugency's economy depends largely on tourism.

Because the vast majority of Chinese Malaysians are descendants of immigrants from southern China, Malaysian Chinese cuisine is predominantly based on an eclectic repertoire of dishes with roots from Fujian, Cantonese, Hakka and Teochew cuisines. As these early immigrants settled in different regions throughout what was then British Malaya and Borneo, they carried with them traditions of foods and recipes that were particularly identified with their origins in China, which gradually became infused with the characteristics of their new home locale in Malaysia while remaining distinctively Chinese. For example, Hainanese chicken rice is usually flavoured with tropical pandan leaves and served with chilli sauce for dipping, and tastes unlike the typical chicken dishes found in Hainan Island itself. Some of these foods and recipes became closely associated with a specific city, town or village, eventually developing iconic status and culminating in a proliferation of nationwide popularity in the present day. Chinese food is especially prominent in areas with concentrated Chinese communities, at roadside stalls, hawker centres and kopitiam, as well as smart cafes and upmarket restaurants throughout the nation. Many Chinese dishes have pork as a component ingredient, but chicken is available as a substitution for Muslim customers from the wider community, and some Chinese restaurants are even halal-certified. List of dishes found in Malaysian Chinese cuisine Fish ball with rice vermicelli * Bak Kut Teh () (pork ribs soup). The root meaning for the dish, \\"Bak Kut\\" (Hokkien dialect) is the term for meaty ribs, at its simplest cooked with garlic, dark soy sauce and a specific combination of herbs and spices which have been boiled for many hours. Popularly regarded as a health tonic, this soup is historically eaten by hard working Chinese coolies working on the wharfs at Port Swettenham (now Port Klang) and clearing estates, accompaniment with strong tea (\\"Teh\\") on the side. There are some differences in seasoning amongst other Chinese communities; the Teochew prefer a clear broth which is heavier on garlic and pepper, while the Cantonese may include additional varieties of medicinal herbs and spices. Variations include the so-called chik kut teh (made with chicken and a version that is gaining popularity with Muslim diners), seafood bak kut teh, and a \\"dry\\" (reduced gravy) version which originated from the town of Klang. * Bakkwa () - literally \\"dried meat\\", bakkwa is better understood as barbequed meat jerky. While this delicacy is especially popular during the Chinese New Year celebration period, it is available everywhere and eaten year round as a popular snack. * Bean Sprouts Chicken () - Ipoh's most well known dish, Bean Sprouts Chicken consists of poached or steamed chicken accompanied with a plate of blanched locally grown bean sprouts in a simple dressing of soy sauce and sesame oil. The crunchy and stout texture of Ipoh-grown bean sprouts is attributed to the mineral-rich properties of local water supplies. The dish is usually served with hor fun noodles in a chicken broth, or plain rice. * Beaufort Mee () is a speciality of Beaufort town. Handmade noodles are smoked, then wok-tossed with meat (usually slices of char siu and marinated pork) or seafood and plenty of choy sum, and finished off with a thick viscous gravy. * Cantonese fried noodles () refers to a preparation of noodles which are shallow or deep fried to a crisp, then served as the base for a thick egg and cornstarch white sauce cooked with sliced lean pork, seafood, and green vegetables like choy sum. A related dish called wa tan hor () uses hor fun noodles, but the noodles are not deep fried, merely charred. Another variation called yuen yong () involves mixing both crisp-fried rice vermicelli as well as hor fun to form a base for the sauce. * Chai tow kway () - a common dish in Malaysia made of rice flour. It also known as fried radish cake, although no radish is included within the rice cakes, save perhaps the occasional addition of preserved radish () during the cooking process. Seasonings and additives vary from region, and may include bean sprouts and eggs. Penang-style char kway teow Penang-style chee cheong fun * Char kway teow (). Stir fried rice noodles with bean sprouts, prawns, eggs (duck or chicken), chives and thin slices of preserved Chinese sausages. Cockles and lardons were once standard offerings, but mostly relegated to optional additions these days due to changing taste preferences and growing health concerns. Penang-style char kway teow is the most highly regarded variant both in Malaysia as well as abroad. * Chee cheong fun () is square rice sheets made from a viscous mixture of rice flour and water. This liquid is poured onto a specially made flat pan in which it is steamed to produce the square rice sheets. The steamed rice sheets is rolled or folded for ease in serving. It is usually served with tofu stuffed with fish paste. The dish is eaten with accompaniment of semi sweet fermented bean paste sauce, chilli paste or light vegetable curry gravy. Ipoh and Penang have different versions of the dish as well; certain stalls in Ipoh serve the dish with a red sweet sauce, thinly sliced pickled green chillies and fried shallots, while in Penang, a type of sweet, black shrimp sauce called hae ko is the main condiment. * Chun gen (Chinese : Êò•Âç∑) is an oblong roll of seasoned ground pork or beef wrapped with a thin omelette and steamed. The name is derived from the Hakka word for the spring season, which is pronounced as \\"chun\\". (Another explanation is that \\"chun\\" is for \\"egg\\" instead.) It is said to have been around since Chunqiu period with a rumor of Duke Huan of Qi and since then it's been a custom in Fujian. Today it is available beyond Tenom, and found throughout Sabah's Chinese communities. It may be eaten on its own, cooked in broth or soup, and stir-fried with noodles or vegetables. * Chicken rice (Chinese : ÈõûÈ£Ø) - chicken rice is one of the most popular Chinese-inspired dishes in Malaysia. Hainanese chicken rice (Chinese : Êµ∑ÂçóÈõûÈ£Ø) is the best known version: it is prepared with the same traditional method used for cooking Wenchang chicken, which involve steeping the entire chicken at sub-boiling temperatures within a master stock until cooked, to ensure the chicken meat becomes moist and tender. The chicken is then chopped up, and served with a bowl or plate of rice cooked in chicken fat and chicken stock, along with another bowl of clear chicken broth and a set of dips and condiments. Sometimes the chicken is dipped in ice to produce a jelly-like skin finishing upon the completion of the poaching process. In Malacca, the chicken rice is served shaped into balls. Curry mee. * Curry Mee (Chinese : ÂíñÂñ±È∫µ). A bowl of thin yellow noodles mixed with bihun in a spicy curry soup enriched with coconut milk, and topped with tofu puffs, prawns, cuttlefish, chicken, long beans, cockles and mint leaves, with sambal served on the side. It is often referred to as curry laksa. * Fish ball () are fish paste shaped into a spherical shape. Usually fish ball is served as a condiment together with rice vermicelli or yellow noodles in a clear soup base. Bean sprouts and spring onions are also commonly added, complemented by a small plate of chilli padi soaked in soy sauce. Fishcake is also a common addition. * Fish head bihun (Chinese : È≠öÈ†≠Á±≥Á≤â). A noodle soup in which the main ingredients are rice vermicelli and a deep fried fish head cut into chunks. The soup itself is somewhat creamy, which is usually achieved using a mixture of rich fish stock and milk. Tomatoes and pickled vegetables are sometimes added to cut the richness and provide a tangy foil for the noodle soup. * Fuzhou cuisine can be found in the Sitiawan area, as well as several cities and towns in Sarawak where the Hookchiu diaspora have formed settlements. Well known specialities include ang zhao mee sua (Chinese : Á∫¢ÊßΩÈù¢Á∫ø), and kompyang or kompia (Chinese : ÂÖâÈ§Ö). * Hakka mee (Chinese : ÂÆ¢ÂÆ∂È∫µ) - Hakka Mee is a simple dish of noodles topped with a ground meat gravy. A popular hawker dish with Hakka cultural roots, it is based on an older recipe called Dabumian (Chinese : Â§ßÂüîÈ∫µ); the name indicates its place of origin as Dabu County (), the center of Hakka culture in mainland China. * Heong Peng (Chinese : È¶ôÈ§Ö) - these fragrant pastries, which resemble slightly flattened balls, are a famed speciality of Ipoh. It contains a sweet sticky filling made from malt and shallots, covered by a flaky baked crust and garnished with sesame seeds on the surface. A bowl of Penang Hokkien mee * Hokkien Mee () actually has two variants, with each being ubiquitous to a particular region of Peninsular Malaysia. ** Penang Hokkien mee, colloquially referred to in Penang as Hokkien mee, is also known as hae mee (Chinese : Ëù¶È∫µ) in other parts of Malaysia. One of Penang's most famous specialties, it is a noodle soup with yellow and rice noodles immersed in a spicy stock made from prawns and pork (chicken for halal versions), and garnished with a boiled egg, poached prawns, chopped kangkung and a dollop of sambal. ** Hokkien char mee, a dish of thick yellow noodles braised, fried with thick black soy sauce and added with crispy lardons, is more commonly served in the Klang Valley. It was originally developed in Kuala Lumpur. Thus, within central Peninsular Malaysia, the term Hokkien mee refers to this particular version. * Ipoh white coffee (Chinese : ÊÄ°‰øùÁôΩÂíñÂï°). A popular coffee drink which originated in Ipoh. Unlike the robust dark roast used for typical Malaysian-style black coffee (\\"Kopi-O\\"), \\"white\\" coffee is produced with only palm oil margarine and without any sugar and wheat, resulting in a significantly lighter roast. It is typically enriched with condensed milk prior to serving. * Kam Heong (Chinese : ÈáëÈ¶ô) - literally \\"golden fragrance\\" in English, Kam Heong is a method of cooking developed in Malaysia, and is a good example of the country's culinary style of mixing cultures. The tempering of aromatics with bird‚Äôs eye chilies, curry leaves, crushed dried shrimp, curry powder, oyster sauce and various other seasonings yields a versatile stir-fry sauce that goes well with chicken, clams, crabs, prawns, and squid. * Kolo mee or mee kolok (Chinese : ‰πæÊíàÈ∫µ) is a dish of springy egg noodles tossed in a sweet and savoury shallot, lard and vinegar dressing, and topped with seasoned minced pork and char siu. It is similar to Peninsular-style Hakka mee or wonton mee in concept, but differs significantly in taste profile. A popular variant uses rendered oil from cooking char siu to flavour kolo mee instead of plain lard, which gives the noodles a reddish hue. Halal versions of kolo mee replace the pork components with beef (earning the moniker of mee sapi) or chicken, and lard with peanut or vegetable oil. Additional toppings may include mushrooms, chicken and crab meat. Kampua mee () is a similar dish from Sibu of Fuzhou origin. * Kuching Laksa or Laksa Sarawak (Chinese : Âè§ÊôâÂèªÊ≤ô) is noodles (usually rice vermicelli) served in an aromatic spiced coconut milk soup, topped with shredded chicken, shredded omelette, bean sprouts, prawns, and garnished with coriander.This famous Sarawak dish looks like curry laksa however the Sarawak‚Äôs version is subtler and more flavorful. It is made using a laksa paste consisting of sambal belacan, tamarind, lemongrass, herbs and spices with a little coconut milk thus giving it a fine balance of aromatic herbs and spices with a kind hint of sour and spicy note while presenting a soft but not overly rich creamy broth. * Kway chap (Chinese : Á≤øÊ±Å). Teochew dish of rice noodle sheets in a dark soy sauce gravy, served with pork pieces, pig offal, tofu products and boiled eggs. * Lor Bak(Chinese : Êª∑ËÇâ) - a fried meat roll made from spiced minced pork and chopped water chestnuts rolled up in soya bean curd sheets, and deep fried. It is usually served with small bowl of Lor (a thick broth thickened with corn starch and beaten eggs) and chili sauce. The term also extends to other items sold alongside the meat rolls, like tao kwa (hard tofu), pork sausages, tofu skin sheets etc. * Lor Mee (Chinese : Êª∑È∫µ). A bowl of thick yellow noodles served in a thickened gravy made from eggs, starch and pork stock. * Marmite chicken (Chinese : Â™ΩËúúÈõû) - a unique dish of marinated fried chicken pieces glazed in a syrupy sauce made from marmite, soy sauce, maltose and honey. This dish may also be prepared with other ingredients like pork ribs and prawns. Claypot chicken rice * Mee Hailam (Chinese : Êµ∑ÂçóÈ∫µ) - stir-fried egg noodles with meat or seafood and copious amounts of vegetables, bathed in a gravy seasoned with dark soy sauce and calamansi lime. It is an ubiquitous menu item in Hainanese-run eateries and restaurants. * Ngah Po Fan or Sha Po Fan (Chinese : Áì¶ÁÖ≤È£Ø or Ê≤ôÁÖ≤È£Ø) - seasoned rice cooked in a claypot with secondary ingredients, and finished with soy sauce. A typical example is rice cooked with chicken, salted fish, Chinese sausage, and vegetables. Claypots are also used for braising noodles, meat dishes and reducing soups. Pan Mee as served in Malaysia. * Ngiu chap (Áâõ‰ªÄ) is a Chinese-influenced dish of beef broth served with noodles, usually dunked in the soup with poached beef slices, meatballs, stewed brisket, tendon, liver and various offal parts. An iconic Sabahan dish, ngiu chap has many different variations, from the lighter Hainanese style to heartier Hakka-influenced flavours, and even village-style ngiu chap adapted for indigenous Sabahan tastes. * Oyster omelette or O-chian () - a medley of small oysters is sauteed on a hot plate before being folded into an egg batter, which then has moistened starch mixed in for thickening, and finally fried to a crisp finish. Unlike other versions of oyster omelettes found throughout the Hokkien and Teochew diaspora, a thick savoury gravy is never poured onto Malaysian-style oyster omelettes; a chilli sauce is provided on the side for dipping instead. * Pan mee () - noodle soup with hand-kneaded and torn pieces of noodles or regular strips of machine-pressed noodles, with a toothsome texture not unlike Italian pasta. A variant popular in the Klang Valley is known as \\"Chilli Pan Mee\\", and which of cooked noodles served with minced pork, a poached egg, fried anchovies and fried chilli flakes which are added to taste. Chilli Pan Mee is accompanied with a bowl of clear soup with leafy vegetables. * Popiah () - Hokkien/Teochew-style crepe stuffed and rolled up with cooked shredded tofu and vegetables like turnip and carrots. The Peranakan version contains julienned bangkuang (jicama) and bamboo shoots, and the filling is seasoned with tauchu (fermented soybean paste) and meat stock. Another variation consists of popiah doused in a spicy sauce. Popiah can also be deep fried and served in a manner similar to the mainstream Chinese spring roll. * Sang nyuk mian () is a dish of noodles served with pork broth, originating from Tawau. Very popular with the non-Muslim communities of Sabah, it is named after the poached-to-order slices of tender marinated pork served in pork broth which is flavoured with fried lard bits. The noodles (usually thick yellow noodles) are either dressed in dark soy and lard, or dunked into the soup along with the aforementioned pork slices, vegetables, meatballs and offal. * Seremban Siew Pau (). The town of Seremban, the state capital of Negeri Sembilan, is famous for its siew pau, a flaky oven-baked pastry bun with a treacly BBQ pork and green pea filling. Chicken fillings are available as a halal option. * Teochew porridge - Teochew porridge or muay () is a type of rice porridge or soup. Unlike congee, Teochew porridge is thin and watery in texture, with visible rice grains sitting loosely at the bottom of the bowl. Eaten as a substitute for plain cooked rice instead of a complete meal by itself, it is served with an assortment of side dishes like vegetables, meat and salted egg. At eateries specialising in Teochew porridge, one can find a buffet spread of at least a dozen different dishes to choose from. Some variant recipes add sweet potatoes or even shark meat to the porridge during the cooking process. Tau sar pneah, also known as Tambun pneah, from Penang * Tau sar pneah () - A famous Penang delicacy, this round-shaped Chinese pastry is made of wheat flour, sugar, green bean paste, fried onions, lard and salt. It is also known as Tambun biscuits as the pastry was believed to be invented in Bukit Tambun, Penang. Its popularity as a delicacy has made this biscuit one of the must-buy souvenirs from Penang. * Tomato kway teow () - kway teow noodles stir-fried with sweet tomato gravy, meat (usually chicken pieces), eggs and vegetables. A popular dish in Chinese restaurants throughout Sarawak, another variant () utilises egg noodles which have been fried to a crisp, and then immersed with the gravy and ingredients. * Tuaran mee () is a speciality of Tuaran town. This dish of wok fried fresh handmade noodles is well known in the nearby city of Kota Kinabalu as well as in neighbouring Tamparuli town, where the localised adaptation is called Tamparuli mee (). The noodles must first be toasted with oil in the wok to prevent it from clumping together, then blanched to reduce the stiff crunchy texture from toasting. The final step involves stir frying the noodles to a dry finish with eggs, vegetables, and meat or seafood. Wonton Mee * Wonton Mee () - thin egg noodles with wonton dumplings (), choy sum and char siu. The dumplings are usually made of pork or prawns and typically boiled or deep fried. The noodles may be served in a bowl of broth with dumplings as in the traditional Cantonese manner, but in Malaysia it is more commonly dressed with a dark soy sauce dressing, with boiled or deep-fried wonton dumplings as a topping or served on the side in a bowl of broth. Variations of this dish are usually in the meat accompaniments with the noodles. These may include roast pork (ÁÉßËÇâ), braised chicken feet, and roast duck (ÁáíÈ¥®). The tossing of yee sang * Yam rice () - savoury rice dish cooked with taro, Chinese sausage, chicken, dried prawns and mushrooms. It is often served as an accompaniment for dishes like bak kut teh or yong tau foo. * Yau Zha Gwai or Eu Char Kway or You Tiao ( or ) - a version of the traditional Chinese crueller, which is a breakfast favourite. It can be eaten plain with a beverage like coffee and soy milk, spread with butter or kaya, or dipped into congee. It is shaped like a pair of chopsticks, stuck together. The name itself amusingly translates into \\"greasy fried ghosts\\". * Yong tau foo () - tofu products and vegetables like brinjals, lady's fingers, bitter gourd and chillies stuffed with fish or pork paste. Originally developed in Ampang, Selangor, it is a localised adaptation of a Hakka dish called ngiong tew foo (stuffed tofu with ground pork paste) and is usually served in a clear broth. * Yusheng () - a festive raw fish salad, also pronounced yee sang in the Cantonese manner. While raw fish preparations are thought to have existed in China during antiquity and can be found in the Chaoshan region of Guangdong province in modern times, yusheng was created and developed in Singapore in 1964 when the republic was still a member state of the Federation of Malaysia.[Ref : i-weekly issue 669 26 Min Daily 15 February 2003 Page 24 Lian He Wan Bao 17 February 1996 Page 34 YUAN publisher = Singapore Federation of Chinese Clan Associations date = 1 February 2003] It consists of strips of raw fish tossed at the dining table with shredded vegetables, crispy tidbits and a combination of sauces and condiments. Yusheng literally means \\"raw fish\\" but since \\"fish (È≠ö)\\" is commonly conflated with its homophone \\"abundance (È§ò)\\", Y√∫shƒìng (È≠öÁîü) is interpreted as a homophone for Y√∫shƒìng (‰ΩôÂçá) meaning an increase in abundance. Therefore, yusheng is considered a symbol of abundance, prosperity and vigor. As a result, the mixing and tossing of yusheng with chopsticks and the subsequent consumption of the salad has become ritualised as part of the commemoration of Chinese New Year festivities in Malaysia and Singapore. * Zongzi () - a traditional Chinese food made of glutinous rice stuffed with savoury or sweet fillings and wrapped in bamboo, reed, or other large flat leaves. They are cooked by steaming or boiling, and are a feature of the Duanwu festival, which is still celebrated by the Chinese communities in Malaysia. Chinese guo Chinese kuih, written as \\"guo\\" (Á≤ø) or sometimes as \\"gao\\" (Á≥ï), are usually made from ground rice flours. Many of the kue are made especially for important festivities such as the Qingming Festival or Chinese New Year, however many others are consumed as main meals or snack on a daily basis. Example of these kue include: * Nian gao (Âπ¥Á≥ï): Known in the Hokkien language as \\"Ti Kueh\\" (ÁîúÁ≤ø) * Caozai Guo (Ëçâ‰ªîÁ≤ø): Pronounced in Hokkien as \\"Tsao wa kueh\\" (chh√°u-√°-k√©). Also known as \\"Tsukak kueh\\" (Èº†È∫¥Á≤ø, chh√∫-khak- k√©) from the herb it is made from. * Turnip cake (ËèúÈ†≠Á≤ø, ËèúÈ†≠Á≥ï): Eaten straight, panfried, or stir-fried with egg as Chai tow kway. * Taro cake (ËäãÁ≤ø, ËäãÁ≥ï) * Chwee kueh (Ê∞¥Á≤ø): Teochew term which literally translates as \\"water rice cake\\". * Fun guo (Á≤âÁ≤ø) * Red Tortoise Cake (Á¥ÖÈæúÁ≤ø) (Pronounced as Ang Ku Kueh) Many Chinese kue require the use of a Kue mould similar to that use in mooncakes, which is either carved out of wood or made of plastics. Kue moulds with turtles are ubiquitous, though moulds of peaches are usually quite common. Red coloured turtle kue are known especially as \\"Ang ku kueh\\"/\\"Red Tortoise Cake\\" (Á¥ÖÈæúÁ≤ø). Since many Chinese no longer make kue at home, these moulds have become less common in many kitchens. Desserts and sweets * Bubur cha cha - a Nyonya dessert of bananas, sweet potatoes, taro, black eyed beans and sago pearls cooked in pandan-flavoured coconut milk. May be served hot or cold. * Leng Chee Kang - a mixture of cooked ingredients immersed in a sweet soup. Ingredients vary greatly depending on the cook, but lotus seed is always the primary ingredient, and the soup may include dried longan, white fungus, barley, kembang semangkuk jelly and rock sugar as secondary ingredients. Leng Chee Kang may be served warm or cold. * Mooncake (Chinese : ÊúàÈ•º) - round or rectangular pastries with a rich thick filling, traditionally eaten during the Mid-Autumn Festival and accompanied with Chinese tea. Both the traditional baked mooncake and the snow skin version are popular and widely available in Malaysia during the festival season. * Muar Chee (Chinese : È∫ªÁ≥ç) - glutinous rice ball lumps coated in a sweetened mixture of pulverised peanuts and sesame seeds, and served with toothpicks. * Tangyuan (Chinese : Ê±§ÂúÜ or ÊπØÂúì) - plain white or coloured sweet dumplings made from glutinous rice flour. Traditionally homemade and eaten during Yuanxiao (Chinese : ÂÖÉÂÆµ) as well as the Dongzhi Festival (Chinese : ÂÜ¨Ëá≥), tangyuan is now available year around sold as dessert. Tangyuan dumplings with filling are usually served in a lightly sweetened clear syrup, while unfilled ones are served as part of a sweet dessert soup. * Tau foo fah or Dau Huay (Chinese : Ë±ÜËÖêËä± or Ë±ÜËä±) - a velvety pudding of very soft silken tofu, traditionally flavoured with a brown sugar syrup. * UFO tart (Chinese : ÁâõÂ±éÂ†Ü) - this consists of a flat, thin base of baked mini butter sponge cake topped with a creamy egg custard, which is in turn crowned with a meringue slurry. Its name in Chinese has a literal means \\"cow pile dung\\", which alludes to the piped shape of the cake base's toppings and the meringue's darker shade as a result of caramelisation. Popularized by a Hainanese bakery in Sandakan in the 1950s, the popularity of these treats has spread to Kota Kinabalu and several other towns in Sabah. Vegetarian cuisine Over 80% of Malaysian Chinese identify themselves as Buddhists, and some follow a vegetarian diet at least some of the time. Some Chinese restaurants offer an exclusively vegetarian menu (Chinese : Á¥†È£ü, Êñé) featuring Chinese dishes which resemble meat dishes in look and even taste, like \\"roast pork\\", fried \\"fish\\" with \\"skin\\" and \\"bones\\", and \\"chicken drumsticks\\" complete with a \\"bone\\". These vegetarian restaurants are run by proprietors who abstain from consumption of animal products as well as strong tasting vegetables and spices as way of life for religious reasons, and are essentially vegan. The meat analogues used are often locally produced as opposed to imported, and are made solely from ingredients like soy, gluten, mushrooms and tuber vegetables. Buddhist vegetarian restaurants are likely to be found in areas with a high concentration of Chinese, and tend to be especially busy on certain festive days where many Buddhists temporarily adopt a strict vegetarian diet for at least a day.

Built in 1936, it lasted as a venue until 1958. Construction Harringay Arena was built and owned by Brigadier-General Alfred Critchley under the auspices of his private company, the Greyhound Racing Association Trust Ltd (GRA). A new company, Harringay Arena Limited, whose directors were also directors of the GRA, was incorporated in 1929 to build and manage the venue. The company raised funds for the venture via a stock and share issue in January 1936.The Guardian, 19 January 1936. Designed by Dr. Oscar Faber, the arena was a stark modernist octagonal-shaped building which borrowed heavily from the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto. It was erected adjacent to the Harringay Stadium in just eight months between February and October 1936. Its vast steel roof was constructed by Dorman Long & Co, who had recently been responsible for the Sydney Harbour Bridge and completed the new Wembley Stadium in 2007. It had a seating capacity of almost 10,000 for ice hockey and slightly more for boxing. The actual arena was long by wide.Horse of the Year Show Programme, 1957, page 67. A removable maple floor could be laid over the ice for non-sporting events. This arrangement clearly proved troublesome. At an event shortly after its opening the Daily Herald reported that \\"claims that Harringay had solved its cold-feet problem were not quite substantiated. Cold air from the ice below the boards filtered through\\".. Sports venue Specifically designed as an ice hockey venue, it quickly became famous as a venue for both ice hockey and boxing. Up to the Second World War, ice hockey enjoyed its most popular era in the UK until a revival in the 1990s. Two local teams were formed for the Arena's opening, Harringay Racers and Harringay Greyhounds. On 26 October 1938, the first ice hockey game to be televised anywhere in the world was played at Harringay between the Racers and Streatham. A year later, WWII started and ice hockey matches were suspended. This interruption proved very damaging to the sport's popularity and post-war audiences remained thin for the remainder of the Arena's life. Boxing became firmly established at the Arena prior to the war. On 7 April 1938 Harringay was the venue for the first boxing match to be televised live when the full 15 rounds between Len Harvey v Jock McAvoy were broadcast. Following the war Harringay was a very successful boxing venue. During its 22-year life, it was home to five world title fights, a record for any British venue by the time the Arena ceased operating as a venue in 1958.A list of all fights held at Harringay from BoxerRec.com However famous the Arena became for boxing, commercial necessity led to a diversification into a wider range of events including: *The basketballKentucky's Harringay Arena RecordMalcolm Finlay (1919‚Äì2007), Great Britain‚Äôs First Basketball Captain and wrestlingOfficial 1948 Olympic Souvenir Booklet events for the 1948 Summer Olympics.1948 Summer Olympics official report. pp. 42, 50. *All England Open Badminton Championships from 1947 to 1949.badminton-information.com *Home of the Horse of the Year Show for its first ten years, from 1949 to 1958.

The success of these performances led to the formation of the English National Ballet.English National Ballet history on the English National Ballet websiteExcerpts from Ballet Magazine on line =Circuses= The arena was well known as a venue for circuses. It was home to Tom Arnold's annual Harringay Circus for eleven seasons from Christmas 1947 to Christmas 1957. For the first circus show in 1947 Arnold hired twenty baby elephants specially imported from Ceylon by the Chipperfield family. They arrived at the George V Dock in London's Docklands in October 1947 on SS Arbratus. Billy Smart occasionally appeared in these shows. At one of the Mammoth Christmas Circuses, he spray-painted five of his elephants white, yellow, blue, cream and pink.Billy Smart Junior ‚Äì Obituary, The Independent, 24 May 2005 The 1952 circus included an elephant act with Sabu, the young Indian actor made famous by his appearance in films such as The Thief of Baghdad.Sabu, Philip Leibfried, Films in Review, October 1989 The resident band for the circuses was led by Charles Shadwell; the signature tune \\"Down with the Curtain\\" always introduced the proceedings.

The festival included eight brass bands, three pipe bands and nine male voice choirs, all from collieries around the UK. There were also displays of clog dancing and sword dancing by colliery groups.

The concert was called the Starlight Dance and it has been referred to as the start of what is thought of today as the full-scale arena concert.Disc Magazine, Issue 18, 7 June 1958 *In April 1949, Paul Robeson gave a short series of concerts at the Arena. He returned the following year to sing at the 20th Daily Worker rally. Decline and fall Despite running an impressive and broad ranging calendar of events from 1947 to 1958, the change in the fortunes of ice hockey in the UK and the straitened post-war circumstances meant limited commercial success for the Arena after the Second World War. The arena hosted its final event on Tuesday, 28 October 1958. It was a sentimental occasion and promoter Jack Solomons headlined with a world-class lightweight fight between Dave Charnley and Carlos Ortiz (who was to go on to become world champion). The Times quoted part of the speech at that event in its paper the following day: Behind the scenes moves for the Arena's disposal had been going on for some time. International food retailer and manufacturer, Home & Colonial Stores Ltd were offered the site in 1957. They took possession of the building and the adjacent market hall in 1958. Works to convert the Arena to its new use were complete by February 1960.The Times, The Home & Colonial Stores Ltd, 11 May 1960 It was henceforth put to use as a food storage facility for the next 20 years until its demolition in 1978. Through the early 1980s an open air Sunday market was held on the site up until the site was developed for shopping. The initial development included principally warehouse style shopping including DIY, bathroom and food wholesale outlets. A Royal Mail sorting facility was also built which survived the later redevelopment. Early in the 21st century the whole site was redeveloped for retail shopping as the Arena Shopping Park, hosting mid-market brands such as Next, Carphone Warehouse, Homebase and a Fitness First gym.

As of 2019 the Techint Group is composed of six main companies in the following areas of business: engineering, construction, steel, mining, oil & gas, industrial plants, healthcare. Techint, with its subsidiaries, is the largest steel making company in Argentina. Techint claims to be the world's largest manufacturer of seamless steel tubes, mainly used in the oil industry.  History  Agostino Rocca, an executive at Ansaldo and later at Dalmine and Siac (steel and iron industries) founded Compagnia Tecnica Internazionale (Italian for \\"Technical International Company\\") in Milan in September 1945, but developed its main activity worldwide. The original company name was changed after to Techint, its abbreviated telex code.http://www.techint.com/~/media/TechintCom/Brochures/techint bilancio.ashx The company began providing engineering services to a growing number of clients in Latin America -to where Agostino Rocca had traveled after World War II- and Europe. Construction activities soon followed: the first major Techint Engineering and Construction (E&C;) project was a network of large diameter pipelines in Argentina and Brazil. Awarded a contract to build a 1,600 km (1,000 mi) gas pipeline from Comodoro Rivadavia to Buenos Aires in 1949 by President Juan Per√≥n, Techint became a leading government contractor during Per√≥n's ambitious infrastructure program in Argentina. Creating subsidiaries in Brazil (1947), Chile (1951), and Mexico (1954), the company opened its first seamless steel tube plant in Campana, in 1954; in 1969, Techint's Ensenada plant became the only Argentine manufacturer of cold rolled steel. In the 1980s important projects were undertaken in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador and Mexico, and the company diversified into new fields of activity, building the first nuclear facilities and offshore platforms. In the early 1990s Techint purchased a stake in Argentina's then-leading steel manufacturer, the state- owned SOMISA. A significant part of Techint's core manufacturing strength has since been concentrated in the San Nicol√°s-Villa Constituci√≥n oil-and-steel corridor, where the company is involved in the production of cold rolled steel. In those years, the Techint Group invested in oil and gas blocks in Argentina through exploration and production company Tecpetrol. In Italy, the Techint Group entered the health services sector by building and managing Instituto Clinico Humanitas (ICH), a hospital and medical research institute near Milan. Tenaris, the company under which all the manufacturing and service activities in the steel pipe business are grouped today, went public at the end of 2002 quoting in the Buenos Aires, Mexico City and Milan stock exchanges, and its American Depositary Securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. On August 23, 2005, the Techint group bought 99.3% of Mexican Hylsamex for US $2.2 billion. In press release, Techint informed that the Mexican steel manufacturer, and its previous steel manufacturers Siderar (Argentina) and Sidor (Venezuela) would be under a new subsidiary called Ternium, headquartered in Luxembourg. On April 30, 2007, Ternium, a division of Techint, announced that it had entered into an agreement in which it expects to gain control of Grupo IMSA, a major player in the Mexican steel industry.Ternium to Obtain Control of Mexico-Based Grupo Imsa (April 30, 2007) The decision of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez to nationalize Sidor came on the heels of a series of industrial disputes over the previous year. Compensation of around US$1.97 billion was agreed for the nationalisation of Ternium's 60% stake in Sidor, with the former keeping a 10% stake in the company, but frictions emerged with the Kirchner administration in Argentina over their reported refusal to raise objections to the nationalization with President Ch√°vez. The Techint Group invested US$2.3 billion in its Argentine operations from 2003 to 2008, and its local Siderca unit's steel output rose from 2.5 million tons in 2003 to 4.5 million in 2008. In 2016 the Techint Group entered the mining industry through the Tenova's acquisition of several companies operating in this field. Today, the Techint Group has a workforce of 51,200 permanent employees. See history of Techint Group since 1945.  Divisions  *Tenaris: A global supplier of tubular products and services used in drilling, completion and production of oil and gas, in process and power plants, and in specialized industrial and automotive applications.

Description The road is a former cattle route that stretches in an east-west direction almost through the Kimberley between the towns of Derby and the Kununurra and Wyndham junction of the Great Northern Highway. Like its namesake, which does not actually cross the road but runs nearby at ,Bonzle map showing Gibb River it is named after geologist and explorer Andrew Gibb Maitland. The Gibb River Road is one of the two major roads which dissect the Kimberley region‚Äîthe other being the extreme northern section of Great Northern Highway which runs further to the south. The road is often closed due to flooding during the wet season, which is typically November through March, although delayed openings have been known to happen, frustrating the tourism industry as well as locals who rely on the road. Since the mid-2000s, the road has been upgraded to a formed gravel two-lane road including a few short bitumenised sections, but 4WD vehicles are still recommended due to the water crossings and numerous heavily corrugated sections. The Gibb River Road has scenic views of geological formations and natural scenery, Aboriginal and pastoral history, as well as rare and unique fauna and flora. Attractions along the Road include Windjana Gorge National Park, Tunnel Creek National Park, Adcock Gorge, Manning Gorge, Galvans Gorge, Lennard Gorge, Bell Gorge, and Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges. Accommodation is offered by several cattle stations in the area including Mount Hart Wilderness Lodge, Mount Barnett Station, Mount Elizabeth Station, Drysdale River Station, the El Questro Station, Ellenbrae and Charnley River Station. History From 1948, an Air Beef Scheme operated between Glenroy Station and Wyndham. An abattoir, freezing works, and airstrip were built on the station and the meat airfreighted twice a day to the coast before being shipped to the southern cities. To develop the beef industry further, a Commonwealth Government grant to build a road was given in 1949 and the following year construction of a road to Derby commenced, one of a number of roads built as part of the so- called \\"Beef Roads Scheme\\". This southern section, which is sometimes referred to as the Derby-Gibb River Road, was completed in 1956 at a cost of ¬£713,677 and was used for trucking live cattle. The northern section of the road was under the control of the Shire of Wyndham-East Kimberley until 1996 when Main Roads Western Australia took over control and upgraded the full length of the highway.

It came as a response to the inadequacy of regional geography to explain general spatial dynamics. The main claim for the quantitative revolution is that it led to a shift from a descriptive (idiographic) geography to an empirical law-making (nomothetic) geography. The quantitative revolution occurred during the 1950s and 1960s and marked a rapid change in the method behind geographical research, from regional geography into a spatial science. \\"The ‚ÄòQuantitative Revolution‚Äô\\", GG3012(NS) Lecture 4, University of Aberdeen, 2011, webpage: AB12. In the history of geography, the quantitative revolution was one of the four major turning-points of modern geography ‚Äì the other three being environmental determinism, regional geography and critical geography). The quantitative revolution had occurred earlier in economics and psychology and contemporaneously in political science and other social sciences and to a lesser extent in history. Antecedents During the late 1940s and early 1950s: * The closing of many geography departments and courses in universities took place, e.g. the abolition of the geography program at Harvard University (a highly prestigious institution) in 1948. * There was continuing division between human and physical geography ‚Äì general talk of human geography becoming an autonomous subject. *Geography was regarded as overly descriptive and unscientific ‚Äì it was claimed that there was no explanation of why processes or phenomena occurred. *Geography was seen as exclusively educational ‚Äì there were few if any applications of contemporary geography. *Continuing debates regarding what geography is ‚Äì science, art, humanity or social science ‚Äì took place. *After World War II, technology became increasingly important in society, and as a result, nomothetic-based sciences gained popularity and prominence. All of these events presented a threat to geography's position as an academic subject, and thus geographers began seeking new methods to counter critique. The Revolution The quantitative revolution responded to the regional geography paradigm that was dominant at the time. Debates raged predominantly (although not exclusively) in the U.S., where regional geography was the major philosophical school. In the early 1950s, there was a growing sense that the existing paradigm for geographical research was not adequate in explaining how physical, economic, social, and political processes are spatially organized, ecologically related, or how outcomes generated by them are evidence for a given time and place. A growing number of geographers started to express their dissatisfaction with the traditional paradigm of the discipline and its focus on regional geography, deeming the work as too descriptive, fragmented, and non-generalizable. To address these concerns, early critics such as Ackerman\\\\--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge. suggested the systematization of the discipline. Soon thereafter, a series of debates regarding methodological approaches in geography took place. One of the first illustrations of this was the Schaefer vs. Hartshorne debate. In 1953 Exceptionalism in geography: A Methodological Examination was published. In this work, Schaefer rejected Hartshorne‚Äôs exceptionalist interpretations about the discipline of geography and having the region as its central object of study. Instead, Schaefer envisioned as the discipline‚Äôs main objective the establishment of morphological laws through scientific inquiry, i.e. incorporating laws and methods from other disciplines in the social sciences that place a greater emphasis on processes. Hartshorne, on the other hand, addressed Schaefer‚Äôs criticism in a series of publications,\\\\--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo- American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge.\\\\--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo- American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge.\\\\--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo- American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge.\\\\--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo- American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge. where he dismissed Schaefer‚Äôs views as subjective and contradictory. He also stressed the importance of describing and classifying places and phenomena, yet admitted that there was room for employing laws of generic relationships in order to maximize scientific understanding. In his view, however, there should be no hierarchy between these two approaches. While debates about methods carried on, the institutionalization of systematic geography was taking place in the U.S. academy. The geography programs at the University of Iowa, Wisconsin, and Washington were pioneering programs in that respect. At the University of Iowa, Harold McCarty led efforts to establish laws of association between geographical patterns. At the University of Wisconsin, Arthur H. Robinson led efforts to develop statistical methods for map comparison. And at the University of Washington, Edward Ullman and William Garrison worked on developing the field of economic and urban geography, and central place theory. These institutions engendered a generation of geographers that established spatial analysis as part of the research agenda at other institutions including University of Chicago, Northwestern University, Loyola University, The Ohio State University, the University of Michigan, among others. The changes introduced during the 1950s and 1960s under the banner of bringing 'scientific thinking' to geography led to an increased use of technique-based practices, including an array of mathematical techniques and computerized statistics that improved precision, and theory- based practices to conceptualize location and space in geographical research. Some of the techniques that epitomize the quantitative revolution include: * Descriptive statistics; * Inferential statistics; * Basic mathematical equations and models, such as gravity model of social physics, or the Coulomb equation; * Stochastic models using concepts of probability, such as spatial diffusion processes; * Deterministic models, e.g. Von Th√ºnen's and Weber's location models. The common factor, linking the above techniques, was a preference for numbers over words and a belief that numerical work had a superior scientific pedigree. Ron Johnston and colleagues at the University of Bristol have published a history of the revolution that stresses changes in substantive focus and philosophical underpinnings as well as methods.Quantitative methods I: The world we have lost ‚Äì or where we started from; https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0309132518774967 ; Quantitative methods II: How we moved on ‚Äì Decades of change in philosophy, focus and methods; https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0309132519869451 Epistemological underpinnings The new method of inquiry led to the development of generalizations about spatial aspects in a wide range of natural and cultural settings. Generalizations may take the form of tested hypotheses, models, or theories, and the research is judged on its scientific validity, turning geography into a nomothetic science. One of the most significant works to provide a legitimate theoretical and philosophical foundation for the reorientation of geography into a spatial science was David Harvey‚Äôs book, Explanation in Geography, published in 1969. In this work, Harvey laid out two possible methodologies to explain geographical phenomena: an inductive route where generalizations are made from observation; and a deductive one where, through empirical observation, testable models and hypothesis are formulated and later verified to become scientific laws.Harvey, David (1969). Explanation in Geography. London: Edward Arnold --as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo- American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge. He placed preference on the latter method. This positivist approach was countered by critical rationalism, a philosophy advanced by Karl Popper who rejected the idea of verification and maintained that hypothesis can only be falsified. Both epistemological philosophies, however, sought to achieve the same objective: to produce scientific laws and theories. The paradigm shift had its strongest repercussions in the sub-field of economic and urban geography, especially as it pertains to location theory. However, some geographers‚Äìsuch as Ian Burton‚Äìexpressed their dissatisfaction with quantification\\\\--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo- American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge. while others ‚Äì such as Emrys Jones, Peter Lewis, and Golledge and Amedeo ‚Äì debated the feasibility of law-making.\\\\--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge.\\\\--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge.\\\\--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge. Others, such as F. Luckermann, criticized the scientific explanations offered in geography as conjectural and lacking empirical basis. As a result, even models that were tested failed to accurately depict reality.\\\\--as cited in Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge. By the mid-1960s the quantitative revolution had successfully displaced regional geography from its dominant position and the paradigm shift was evident by the myriad of publications in geographical academic journals and geography textbooks. The adoption of the new paradigm allowed the discipline to be more serviceable to the public and private sectors. Post-revolution geography The quantitative revolution had enormous implications in shaping the discipline of geography into what it looks like today given that its effects led to the spread of positivist (post- positivist) thinking and counter-positivist responses.Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge. Ch. 3-8 The rising interest in the study of distance as a critical factor in understanding the spatial arrangement of phenomena during the revolution led to formulation of the first law of geography by Waldo Tobler. The development of spatial analysis in geography led to more applications in planning process and the further development of theoretical geography offered to geographical research a necessary theoretical background. The greater use of computers in geography also led to many new developments in geomatics, such as the creation and application of GIS and remote sensing. These new developments allowed geographers for the first time to assess complex models on a full-scale model and over space and time and the relationship between spatial entities. To some extent, the development of geomatics helped obscure the binary between physical and human geography, as the complexities of the human and natural environments could be assessed on new computable models.Johnston, Ron and Sideway James (2016). Geography and Geographers: Anglo-American Human Geography since 1945 (7th ed). New York: Routledge. P.84 The overwhelming focus on statistical modelling would, eventually, be the undoing of the quantitative revolution. Many geographers became increasingly concerned that these techniques simply put a highly sophisticated technical gloss on an approach to study that was barren of fundamental theory. Other critics argued that it removed the 'human dimension' from a discipline that always prided itself on studying the human and natural world alike. As the 1970s dawned, the quantitative revolution came under direct challenge. The counter-positivist response came as geographers began to expose the inadequacy of quantitative methods to explain and address issues regarding race, gender, class and war. On that regard, David Harvey disregarded earlier works where he advocated for the quantitative revolution and adopted a Marxist theoretical framework. Soon new subfields would emerge in human geography to contribute a new vocabulary for addressing these issues, most notably critical geography and feminist geography. Ron Johnston Ron Johnston (geographer) and Bristol colleagues have argued and documented how quantitative methods can be used in a critical geography.Johnston, R, et al.

Trelawny is best known for his role in the events leading up to the Glorious Revolution which are sometimes believed to be referenced in the Cornish anthem The Song of the Western Men. Life He was born at Trelawne in the parish of Pelynt, Cornwall, the eldest surviving son of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 2nd Baronet. He was educated at Westminster School and then went to Christ Church, Oxford at the start of the Michaelmas term of 1668 where he distinguished himself as a scholar. A staunch royalist, he was ordained in 1673 and became a beneficed clergyman. He was appointed rector of South Hill on 4 October and of St. Ives on 12 December 1677, becoming Bishop of Bristol in 1685. He was one of the Seven Bishops tried for seditious libel under James II. Trelawny and the other bishops petitioned against James II's Declaration of Indulgence in 1687 and 1688, (granting religious tolerance to Catholics) and as a result he was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London on charges of seditious libel. The bishops said that whilst they were loyal to King James II, their consciences would not agree to allowing freedom of worship to Catholics even if it were to be within the privacy of their own homes as the Declaration proposed; thus they could not sign. Trelawny was held for three weeks before trial, then tried and acquitted; this led to great celebrations, with bells being rung in his home parish of Pelynt. Trelawny was rewarded in 1689 by being appointed Bishop of Exeter (whilst still, until 1694, Archdeacon of Totnes) after the military defeat of James II and the accession of the Protestant William of Orange to the British throne. He was further rewarded by being appointed Bishop of Winchester in 1707, although his promotion was a matter of some controversy, as Queen Anne, who was determined to keep all important Church appointments within her own gift, overruled the advice of her ministers and of Thomas Tenison, the Archbishop of Canterbury in appointing him, thus provoking the so-called Bishoprics Crisis. He died in 1721, in Chelsea, Middlesex; his body was taken back to Pelynt for burial.

PVP was founded in 1931 as the Workers and Farmers Party, but was soon renamed to the Communist Party of Costa Rica (Partido Comunista de Costa Rica). From 1931 to 1947, the party published Trabajo as a communist newspaper. The PVP's current publication is El Popular.

In 1984, a severe internal crisis appeared in the party. At the 14th party congress, two of the party MPs, Arnoldo Ferreto Segura and Humberto Vargas Carbonell took over the party leadership and deposed Mora (who had led the party since 1934). Mora's followers continued to use the name PVP, thus there were two parties with the same name. In 1984 Mora's party took the name Costa Rican People's Party.

She returns to Coronation Street and moves in with Janice (Vicky Entwistle), but soon causes trouble for ex-husband, Nick, and his girlfriend, Maria Sutherland (Samia Ghadie); after learning about Maria's affair with Toyah's ex-boyfriend John. Leanne and Maria's sparring culminates in a brawl in The Rovers Return and Nick leaves Weatherfield. Leanne dates Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill) and despite briefly dumping her for Maria, they reunite.

Danny evicts Leanne and she leaves Weatherfield. Leanne returns eight months later, secretly working as an escort. Her stepmother, Janice, is disgusted. When Leanne starts dating Liam Connor (Rob James-Collier), Janice insists she choose between a loving relationship and her new career. Leanne is shocked to find a new client is Liam's brother, Paul (Sean Gallagher) and he threatens to tell Liam so she threatens to tell his wife, Carla Connor (Alison King). Following the incident with Paul, Leanne chooses to buy a restaurant with Carla, who pulls out after learning that Leanne is an escort and met Paul once. Refusing to believe that they did not sleep together, Carla leaves Leanne ¬£10,000 in debt and dumps Paul.

On 17 December 2008, a drunken Peter tries to kiss Leanne but she rejects him. However, she forgives him when he promises to give up alcohol and they start dating. In early 2009, Peter struggles to stay sober and starts a rehabilitation programme which Leanne supports, running the betting shop in his absence. Leanne thinks that he is having an affair and confronts him in the Rovers but is mortified to learn that he was planning to propose. The reappearance of Leanne's ex-fianc√©, Nick (now played by Ben Price), is another challenge to her relationship with Peter. After an explosion at the bar and a tram derailment, Nick, Peter, and Ashley are trapped in the office. Peter is seriously hurt and taken to hospital where he and Leanne marry but moments later, Peter goes into cardiac arrest brought on by a pericardial effusion and has to be resuscitated. To Leanne's relief, he survives and successfully comes through surgery to stop internal bleeding but it is later revealed that he has damaged his spine and it could be some time before he can walk again. Noticing that Carla has romantic feelings for Peter, Leanne warns her to stay away from them and takes Peter on an impromptu honeymoon on New Year's Eve. Upon their return, they move back to their flat but Peter is depressed about his injuries and hates being treated like an invalid. Leanne finds herself under great stress, having to look after both Simon and Peter and run the bookies with Nick, who continues to pressure her to leave Peter. Leanne later suspects that Peter and Carla had been having an affair but they were, in fact, supporting each other as alcoholics. Leanne and Peter argue and Peter refuses to forgive Leanne because she did not trust him. Leanne plans to leave Weatherfield for London but Peter stops her at the station. After a weekend spent talking through their problems, the couple agrees to give their marriage another try and head off, with Simon, on the honeymoon Peter had booked. The new landlady at The Rovers, Stella Price (Michelle Collins), is revealed to be Leanne's biological mother but Leanne rejects her. Leanne is overjoyed to find that she is pregnant but although Peter seems happy, he admits to Ken that he is not sure that they are ready. Peter and Leanne celebrate in the Rovers and Carla overhears Deirdre and Ken congratulating them and forces Peter to confirm that Leanne is pregnant. Leanne is furious when she realises Carla knows about her pregnancy, especially when Carla drops hints to Simon about it. She confronts Peter and they argue about it, which ends with Leanne hurling vicious insults at Peter about his alcoholism and him storming out of the flat. Feeling guilty, Leanne runs after him but trips and falls down the stairs, where she is later found by Stella. Leanne miscarries and reconciles with Stella. Dr Carter (Oliver Mellor) tells her she is unlikely to get pregnant again without IVF treatment and while she is discussing this, Peter begins an affair with Carla. When Leanne learns of this, she leaves Weatherfield, despite Stella begging her to stay. She stays with her sister in Liverpool, but when she returns, Leanne decides to go for custody of Simon after she believes Peter and Carla cannot take care of him. Simon ends up in hospital after drinking a bottle of wine, and Peter hands Simon over to Leanne. Leanne later reconciles with Nick, and she and Simon move in with him after Peter and Carla leave Weatherfield. Leanne receives her decree absolute, but manipulation from Leanne's jealous half-sister, Eva, leads Nick to propose to Leanne, which she initially rejects but later accepts. Peter and Carla return from Los Angeles and Simon insists that he stay with his father, forcing them to cancel the wedding. Nick re-books the wedding but calls it off when Eva tells the congregation that Leanne visited Peter.

Nick behaves harshly towards Leanne and informs Kal's family about Leanne's prostitution past.

After Nick's departure, Leanne stays in his Victoria Court flat until Nick decides to sell it. Due to Michelle intercepting the post informing Leanne of the new tenants, Leanne is forced to make a quick move with Simon and baby Oliver which prompts Peter to offer her space at the Rovers. At the same time, Toyah is emotionally suffering from her failed IVF attempts and having baby Oliver around after learning she would never have her own child proves too hard for Toyah. After Nick sends Leanne a cheque for ¬£25,000 from the sale of the flat which Leanne tries to give to Toyah for IVF. After learning Toyah's news, Leanne offers to move out to make life easier for her sister. This causes her to move into Steve's flat after Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Peters sister and enemy of Leanne has a conversation with Steve in response to his concerns of a stable environment for Oliver. Moving into the flat with Steve brings the pair closer together as they try to co-parent leading to Steve proposing to Leanne which she initially rejects but after drinking with her sisters; she decided to return home and accept the proposal. Leanne wakes up the next day unsure of the night before and tries to find Steve to clear everything up. Amy overhears Leanne and Liz talking about the engagement and confronts Leanne and also sends a text letting Simon know of the engagement. Leanne then leaves Oliver with Liz to look for Simon to clear the ordeal up and is met with Simon, Eva, Toyah, Amy and Peter on the cobbles when Steve pulls up with Liz and Oliver in a babygrow that says \\"Marry my Daddy\\". After an awkward proposal, Leanne accepts and they celebrate in the Rovers.

In September 2017, Leanne finds out Michelle's ex-boyfriend Will Chatterton (Leon Ockenden) is stalking her and plans to take him down with Michelle. When they arrive at his house, Will grabs Leanne's ankle and she falls down the stairs hitting her head leaving Michelle in danger. Shortly after, Steve sneaks in the house and punches Will after he attempts to rape Michelle and calls Leanne an ambulance. Leanne leaves the street for a while but returns in December 2017. In August 2018, she has a brief fling with Imran Habeeb (Charlie De Melo) unaware he is also seeing her sister, Toyah. When Sally informs them that he is dating them both, they very publicly pretend they want to be in a polygamous relationship with him and have a threesome. A few weeks before Steve's wedding to Tracy, Leanne has sex with him after they get drunk together. They both insist it was a drunken mistake and Steve goes on to marry Tracy, however just before Tracy marries Steve she threatens Leanne, which causes Leanne to think she knows about her sleeping with Steve. When Leanne tries to apologize to Tracy about the one-night stand, Tracy says she was talking about Oliver's outfit (as she wanted him to wear a kilt), meaning Leanne has accidentally revealed that she slept with Steve to Tracy. After Tracy punches Steve in front of the wedding guests she insults Leanne and her past relationships, causing a fight between the two of them. On the way back from the wedding Leanne comes across Ryan Connor's (Ryan Prescott) bloodied body after he was hit by Ronan Truman's (Alan McKenna) car following a car chase between him, Michelle and Ali Neeson (James Burrows), Leanne gets out of her taxi but Ronan reverses his car in the process knocking down Leanne. She is admitted to hospital in need of heart surgery and when Toyah arrives Nick is by her bedside, having been called as her emergency contact. He wants to get back together with her, but she can't bring herself to forgive him. Character creation =Casting= Leanne as she appeared in 1997. In February 1997, Rolf Myller from The People reported that a \\"family from hell\\" would be introduced to Coronation Street. Customers at the Rovers Return were said to be \\"horrified when a gruff newcomer with a jailbird wife and two tearaway teenage sons\\" (later changed to two daughters) arrive in Weatherfield. A Coronation Street insider said that the new family were the \\"real neighbours from hell\\", explaining that it was \\"a taste of things to come\\" from new executive producer, Brian Park, who thought the family would increase ratings. The previous \\"new guns\\" in the show were the McDonald's, however, this was over a few years ago. The insider hinted that the new family would have a \\"big impact\\". The writers introduced Leanne's mother by releasing her from jail, which the insider thought would shock viewers. They added that fans would be pleasantly surprised by some of the new twists in plots. Actress Jane Danson was cast in the role of Leanne. After the introduction of the family, Danson said that the family came in with a bang and said that they are very different to anyone else on the show. She did not believe she had got the part until she filmed a scene in the Rovers Return Inn. Danson said she has always been a big fan of Coronation Street. Her favourite characters are the Duckworths and the Malletts. Everyone has been really welcoming and keep asking how she is doing. After joining Coronation Street, Danson started to become drained, tired and put on weight after playing Leanne for just six months. Danson took a short break from the show after being diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Danson stated in March 2008 that she would stay with Coronation Street for as long as producers wanted the character. She explained that she has managed to create a perfect timing for filming and spending time at home with her family. She told the Sunday Mirror that being an actor with children is the perfect job. Danson said she could never imagine getting bored with Leanne and said if it was up to her, she could quite easily imagine still being there in 20 or 30 years time. Talking about her character, Danson added: \\"She's a loose cannon and she's destined to end up in a really bad way. I wonder how long she can keep picking herself up and dusting herself down - she's probably had six of her nine lives by now!\\" =Characterisation= Leanne has been described as loud, cheeky and holds an \\"in your face\\" attitude. She is very cocky, does not care and does what she wants. She's just a lout coming in at three o'clock in the morning all the time. She disrupts the Street with her loud music and she's always smoking and getting on everybody's nerves.\\" She continued: \\"She's like a second-hand Spice Girl, who can't afford to go the whole way. But she wouldn't think twice about nicking clothes if she had the chance.\\" Danson also added that she has \\"always been a good girl\\" and wouldn't dare shoplift like Leanne. Danson told the Daily Mirror that she would never put her own family life at risk like Leanne has done. After Leanne has an affair with Nick Tilsey, and keeps it a secret from her fianc√© Peter. Danson said that Leanne is feeling a bit trapped with Peter and believes things have got a bit predictable and boring. She said that she is different and a very family- orientated person and although she enjoys work, she likes being with her family. Danson added that she likes the idea of being a party girl like Leanne but the reality is quite different and that Leanne seems to like drama and danger in her life. She added that she loves the fact that her character and herself are opposites, because Leanne gives her a chance to do things that she wouldn't do in reality. Development =Relationship with Nick Tilsley= Danson said she was \\"intrigued\\" by the decision to re-introduce Nick Tilsley played by a different actor, Ben Price. Leanne was married to Nick from 1998 until 1999. Leanne and Nick split in 1999 and Nick started dating Maria Connor (Samia Smith). Speaking about Nick's re-introduction, Danson said it's interesting when an old character is re-introduced because even though it's a different actor, the previous baggage remains. Danson said that Nick has been involved with both Leanne and Maria and said obviously his family are there too so there is potential scope for that character. Danson said she doesn't know whether they will make anything of Leanne and him or not because she seems quite settled where she is. Danson revealed that there's always a possibility of revisiting it but Leanne would just wind up Nick. In an interview with Soaplife, the new actor of Nick, Ben Price said that even though Nick has told Leanne that he still loves her, Leanne wants to be with Peter. Price added that there is always a chance with Leanne and Nick to get back together. Speaking to The Sun, Price commented: \\"Nick started with Tina, then he moved to Kelly. I'm getting through the whole of the Street, I'll be on to Rita by the end of the year!\\" Price added that he is expecting a storyline to develop between Nick and Leanne. He added: \\"You'll see him bump into Leanne soon. I'm sure stuff will come out of that - there's a story there.\\" Asked whether if he wants to see Leanne and Nick to get back together, Price said: \\"There'd have to be a big journey to get to that point, but yeah, I would. But who knows? I don't know how it's going to go! But I think that would be great. But I think it could also be great if there's someone else on the Street who could come into his life. It's nice to keep spicing things up, really.\\" =Return= On 5 February 2004, it was confirmed that Danson would be reprising the role of Leanne. It was revealed that Danson would be returning to the show full-time. Danson commented on her return: \\"They're having a ball in this really seedy bar, eyeing up the ladies. Les spots Leanne from behind and says, 'Wow look at that'. She turns round and he realises to his horror it's his daughter. Les shouts, 'What are you doing here?' But Leanne is wondering exactly the same about him. Of course, Patrick doesn't realise it's Les's daughter. He gropes Leanne's bum and she gives him a good wallop. It causes such a commotion they all get chucked out and Leanne is sacked. She also lived in a room above the bar and suddenly has nowhere to stay. So Les offers to take her home to No.5.\\" Upon hearing that Leanne would be returning as a hooker, Danson told the Daily Mirror: \\"Even for Leanne it's quite a radical storyline,\\" she says. \\"But I've been pleasantly surprised. There hasn't been any adverse reaction.\\" Danson said she found it hard to work on Coronation Street as her 10-month-old son Harry was asleep before she left and was in bed upon finishing filming. Danson commented: \\"As much as I love my job I miss Harry incredibly,\\" she admits. \\"He's happy, he's with his dad and he's absolutely fine, but I feel I'm being pulled in two directions and not giving 100 percent to anybody. I feel completely torn. I need to work and to provide for Harry, but I also feel terribly guilty that I'm not there. I pine for him and feel this need to be with him constantly. With Leanne's current storyline I'm working long days. Harry wakes up at 7am but I leave the house about 6.30am and when I get home he's usually gone to bed. But I'm not on my own - a lot of the cast have got kids and they tell me it does get easier. I ache for him sometimes, but I think I would be forever kicking myself if I hadn't come back to work. I love being in Coronation Street. I've worked really hard to get this far and this is Harry's future too.\\" When Danson was presented with her return scripts, she was shocked to see that she was returning as an escort girl. Danson added: \\"I'm not going to pretend that initially thought it was great. Coronation Street has never done a story like that before and I was worried people wouldn't like it. When I read the scripts I thought it just was a funny storyline - Leanne was charging people for her company while they took her out for a slap-up dinner. But when it turned out she carried on after dinner, I thought, 'Oh God!' \\"Thankfully it's not been seedy and I think she will redeem herself in the end.\\" A Coronation Street insider added: \\"Soon after arriving back Leanne wonders what the hell she has come back to. There are some cracking storylines lined up for her.\\" =Prostitution= In February 2007, it was reported that Leanne would become Coronation Street's first ever prostitute following Danson's on-screen return from maternity leave. The Daily Mirror reported that Leanne would reveal that she became a prostitute to make money while holidaying in Spain. A source told the newspaper: \\"It‚Äôs one of our racier storylines and we believe it will be a ratings winner, sparking much debate.\\" Leanne cannot see anything wrong in being a prostitute because \\"if the money‚Äôs there she‚Äôs up for it\\". Danson was told about the storyline after returning from maternity leave and she initially disapproved. She said \\"Coronation Street has never done a story like that before and I was worried people wouldn't like it.\\" However, upon reading the scripts, Danson thought it was \\"just a funny storyline\\". Discussing her initial hesitation, Danson explained \\"Leanne was charging people for her company while they took her out for a slap-up dinner. But when it turned out she carried on after dinner, I thought, 'Oh God!'\\" The actress added that she was thankful that the storyline was not \\"seedy\\" and opined that Leanne would \\"redeem herself in the end\\". Leanne adopts an alter-ego of \\"Rachel\\" with a \\"posh voice\\", and \\"plies her trade to bored businessmen in top Manchester hotels\\" as a high class escort. To explain her income Leanne tells Les and Janice that she is selling property for an estate agent. The actress stated that humour was added to the storyline in \\"true [Coronation Street] fashion\\". Leanne uses a hotel to meet her clients, but the hotel manager discovers this and throws her out, humiliating her. =Relationship with Dan Mason= Leanne began a relationship with Dan Mason (Matthew Crompton) in 2008. It was later confirmed that Dan would be leaving the show after he tries to burn down Leanne's restaurant in an insurance scam. =Relationship with Peter Barlow= Peter returns to Weatherfield with his recently discovered son, Simon Barlow (Alex Bain), and Leanne helps Peter as he struggles with fatherhood. Peter returns to Weatherfield and finds fatherhood difficult. Gascoyne told Digital Spy that Peter has not thought about how his relationship with Leanne is progressing. Gascoyne explained that Peter is taking it \\"step by step\\", saying \\"Peter knows that Leanne gets on really well with Simon and I think Peter's nicely surprised by that. Leanne kind of has the upper hand on him and in a strange way, Leanne's a moral voice.\\" Leanne tells Peter's family that she is going to reconcile with him rather than accept a job offer from her friends in Leeds. However, a woman named Christina (Sarah-Jayne Steed) arrives and claims that she met Peter on her father's yacht recently and decided to visit him. Leanne discovers that Peter left rehab early and she decides to leave. This story arc was implemented to facilitate Danson's temporary departure from the show to take maternity leave. Digital Spy reported that Leanne becomes \\"fed up\\" with Peter taking her for granted and finds employment in a restaurant in Leeds.t Peter attempts to prevent Leanne from leaving by getting Simon to beg her to stay. Despite this, Leanne leaves for Leeds. Leanne's departure was broadcast on 9 March 2009. In September 2009, it was revealed that Danson had recently returned to work with the show. Danson admitted that was \\"terrified\\" about returning, saying \\"I felt like I‚Äôd been in Babyworld for ages and I was panicking about whether I could learn my lines. There didn‚Äôt seem to be enough hours in the day with two kids, but you somehow find the time.\\" Leanne made her full-time return on 11 September 2009 when Peter finds her in Leeds. Danson said that Leanne is getting on with her life and tells Peter that she has moved on from their relationship. However, Leanne \\"has a change of heart and comes back [to Weatherfield]\\". She tells Janice that she has split up with her boyfriend and Peter invites her for dinner. Peter admits to a \\"few meaningless flings\\" and Leanne spends the night with him. However, Leanne becomes suspicious about remark that Simon makes about Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). Leanne tricks Michelle, who reveals her one-night stand with Peter. Leanne then refuses to reconcile with Peter. When Peter apologises to Leanne, she throws eggs at him and refuses to forgive him. Leanne and Peter later reconcile. Leanne and Peter's relationship hits rock bottom. Leanne proposes to Peter. In an interview with What's on TV, Danson said that Peter and Leanne make a good couple and expressed her desire for the couple to marry at some point. After Peter accepts Leanne's proposal, asked if Leanne wants to be a real mum to Simon, Danson said: \\"She'd like to. Her mum left when she was little and Janice came to her rescue. Leanne wants to be as good at being a mum and she is. All she's ever wanted is the family set-up she has with Peter and Simon.\\" In November 2010, Carla Connor (Alison King) falls for Peter. Asked what is attracting Carla to Peter, king replied: \\"In Peter she has found someone who understands what she is going through.\\" After Peter becomes disabled, Gascoyne said that Peter will be unable to be a proper husband to Leanne. Leanne and Peter's wedding day is coming closer, and Leanne is still having an affair with Nick. Asked whether Leanne will stop the affair, Danson replied: \\"She does love Peter. She feels safe and secure with him. They've created this family unit with Simon ‚Äì and Leanne has the home life she craves. But when she's with Nick she gets a taste of the fast life and she‚Äôs the Leanne of old.\\" After Carla calls her wedding off to Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel), Leanne cannot understand why Peter is being so protective of Carla. When asked to sum up Peter and Leanne's twelve months of marriage, Gascoyne said: \\"It's been very rocky to say the least. There was the stuff with Nick, Peter was very ill and had to get back on his feet, and there was all the guilt of Ashley dying, so it started off badly and carried on badly. And Peter says he's forgiven Leanne for Nick, but in his heart, it still niggles him.\\" Danson said: \\"It's not been the best, has it! They had the blessing, where Peter found out about Nick, and then her mother turned up and they argued over that, then she got pregnant and had about half an episode of happiness, and then she lost her baby. And in the middle of all this, Carla's been hovering in the wings...\\" It was announced in September 2010 that Peter's father, Ken, will catch Leanne in bed with Nick. An insider commented: \\"Leanne is wracked with guilt over the affair,\\" a source told the paper. \\"She loves Peter, she loves his son Simon and they've been through a lot together - but Nick was her first love and she never got over that.\\" It was later revealed that Peter will find out from his sister Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) that Leanne is sleeping with Nick. Danson has said that Leanne's actions has changed her views on cheating. =Stella Price= Michelle Collins was cast as Stella Price in 2011 and was later revealed to be Leanne's biological mother.In May 2011, Danson teased an \\"exciting\\" upcoming storyline involving Leanne. Danson revealed that she was surprised by the storyline, saying \\"I thought now that [Leanne and Peter are] married they'll probably have a baby and do the expected thing. But I think I'm alright to say that it's not that. I would love to tell you [what it is]! Keep watching.\\" It was later reported that new character, Stella Price (Michelle Collins), would be revealed to be Leanne's biological mother. The storyline was confirmed in June 2011. Collins told Soaplife magazine that Stella has moved to Weatherfield as she has decided that it is the time to finally make herself known to Leanne. Stella was in a relationship with Les Battersby (Bruce Jones) and gave birth to Leanne when she was seventeen. Les started drinking and left her alone with Leanne and she struggled to cope. Stella left with every intention of coming back for Leanne once she was settled. When she did, Les would not let her near Leanne and Collins said that Stella \\"didn't stand a chance\\". Leanne discovers Stella's true identity as she celebrates her 30th birthday. Speaking to Inside Soap magazine about the storyline, Danson explained: \\"Leanne has never really given her birth mother a second thought because she's not been in her life. Her dad Les and step mum Janice [Battersby] (Vicky Entwistle) were together for a long time, so Janice always took on that mother role. Having said that, Leanne's always known Janice by her first name, so she hasn't called anyone 'Mummy'.\\" Discussing having Collins as her on-screen mother, Danson said that she was looking forward to the \\"really meaty\\" scenes between Stella and Leanne. Danson added that people have said that she and Collins have similar face shapes and the same mannerisms. She thought it would be interesting to see if viewers pick up on the resemblance between herself and Collins. Danson said that Leanne will be \\"furious\\" upon discovering that Stella is her mother. Speaking to Inside Soap about the plot, Danson commented: \\"Leanne has never really given her birth mother a second thought because she's not been in her life. Her dad Les and stepmum Janice were together for a long time, so Janice always took on that mother role. Having said that, Leanne's always known Janice by her first name, so she hasn't called anyone 'Mummy'.\\" Asked how Leanne reacts to the discovery, Danson added: \\"You'll have to wait and see! She'll either be over the moon to have her real mother in her life, or she'll be absolutely furious that she's been absent all these years.\\" Speaking to Soaplife, Catherine Tyldesley who plays Stella's daughter Eva Price explains Eva's motions when Stella starts to show a significant amount of interest in Leanne. Tyldedley commented that Eva is Jealous that Leanne is married with a family because she split up from her fianc√© just weeks before finding out Leanne is her half- sister. She also added that Stella is Eva's \\"territory\\". =Domestic violence= In March 2015, it was announced that the character of Simon would be involved in a domestic abuse storyline, with it being where Simon is the perpetrator and his stepmother Leanne would be the victim. Executive producer Kieran Roberts said \\"It's a really interesting story. It's come from character, as Simon is a child who has obviously been through a very difficult few years with the death of his mother, his dad's alcoholism and then being passed around by the adults in his life. He's seen a lot of difficult things and he's got some more difficult things to go through this year in the next few months. I can't give much away, but there is at least one other major trauma that Simon is going to have to go through. I think it's fair to say that he's going to come through all of this a little bit damaged. We're going to explore how that impacts on his relationship with Leanne, and we‚Äôre going to touch on this issue of domestic violence from a child against a parent.\\" Danson said of the storyline that she had doubts when she heard about the domestic abuse plot. She admits she didn't buy the storyline when it was pitched as Leanne is \\"quite tough and she's always been a bit gobby\\" and wondered whether the character would \\"really take it from a teenager\\". =Pregnancy= In June 2016, it was announced Leanne would fall pregnant following a one-night stand. Of the storyline, Danson said she was \\"really chuffed\\" for Leanne as Leanne \\"thinks this could be her last chance\\". Danson says her character wants to give Simon and the baby a life she never had and with Simon, Leanne \\"makes the point she won't love him any less\\". The father was revealed as Steve McDonald and Leanne and Michelle will also be \\"forced\\" to be friends after Michelle finds out she is pregnant and that \\"it's just really awkward\\". Danson also stated that Leanne wants to forget the McDonald's and raise the child with Nick. Liz also finds out, and Gail is \\"thrilled when she finds out\\" and that the situation, \\"It's like a little pressure cooker, it's all waiting to blow\\". Danson also says the storyline \\"provokes a lot of stories for a lot of other characters and it's how they will deal with the repercussions\\". Steve being the father will have implications on Leanne and Nick's relationship. Producer Kate Oates said, \\"Nick is persistent and Nick adores her\\" and the storyline will see if they can overcome Leanne being pregnant with another man's child. Reception A writer for the Sunday Mirror called Leanne \\"tough\\" while another writer called her \\"loud-mouthed\\" and a \\"mouthy Manc\\". A Coronation Street insider said: \\"Leanne packs a mean punch. It's no holds barred.\\" Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy described Leanne as \\"love-torn\\". Danson won the award for the \\"Best Dramatic Performance\\" at the British Soap Awards 2011. Danson was additionally nominated for \\"Best Dramatic Performance\\" at the Inside Soap awards for marriage to Peter at his deathbed but lost out to Emmerdale's Danny Miller. She was also nominated for \\"Best Actress\\". In December 2010, following the show's critically acclaimed live episode, Jane Danson's performance was singled out by many Digital Spy forum members. The Guardian columnist Grace Dent commented on Danson's decision to return to the show in 2007 saying that viewers knew Leanne would come back. She described Leanne as \\"one of those rare thesps who knows which side her bread's buttered on\\".

Gr√∂nvik, previously Sumpviken, is a village and part of the village of Iskmo in the municipality of Korsholm, western Finland. The village lies on a stretch of coast, approximately 3 km long, stretching a few hundred metres up country, and around 500 metres along the Jungsundv√§gen road, with about a hundred metres of area around the road being inhabited. Road 724, Alskatv√§gen, passes through the village. The third named road found in Gr√∂nvik is L√•ngk√§rrv√§gen. The companies Kent H√§ggdahl, TMI Antti Vaaranmaa, H√§stbacka Invest, Easywash S-E Herrg√•rd and Alandia Easy Wash are based in Gr√∂nvik. Boathouses near the public beach. History It has been suggested that the hill of Haltija in Gr√∂nvik was in old Finnish belief the place of a local tutelary deity, Haltija, who answered for the unthreatened living of the inhabitants in the area. The area has been substantial for the communications from Finland to Sweden, shown for instance by the fact that, as early as in the 17th century, mail delivery from Finland to Sweden went through the lands of Gr√∂nvik. At the end of the 18th century shipbuilding took place in the village. From 1812 to 1907 the Glassworks of Gr√∂nvik, which became the largest glassworks in the Nordic countries, existed here. Tradesman Johan Gr√∂nberg from Vaasa founded the company and it was run for three generations by the Gr√∂nberg family. The main building of the glassworks was the mansion of Gr√∂nvik, assumed to have been built around 1780. The shipbuilding also expanded into a large-scale activity, and during a period of time one third of the merchant ships in Vaasa were made in Gr√∂nvik. At the bank of the factory an ancient monument law protected stone bridge deck of ship yard structures remains. The glassworks had employees from Belgium, France, Germany and Sweden and the village harboured many European cultures during its functioning. In September 1980 Alskatv√§gen was opened, stretching from Vaasa to Replot- Bj√∂rk√∂by, through Gr√∂nvik. This reduced the driving distance and time from the village to Vaasa, contributing to a lively immigration to the village from 1983 to 1993. At the glassworks bank there have been a harbour place, and a bit north along Alskatv√§gen, another one. A public beach, maintained by the municipality, and some old boat houses, are now found on the former place of the latter. As Gr√∂nvik lies on land affected by post-glacial rebound, the Gr√∂nvik flad, which borders the shore of the village, will in the future will become a gloe lake. This means that the bank areas of Gr√∂nvik can no longer be reached by larger boats. The origin of the name Gr√∂nvik is not known, but it may have been given as the name of the bay off and the coast area of present- day Gr√∂nvik by the Gr√∂nberg family as a constructed name.

Definitions of the middle market are generally derived by dividing the United States economy into three categories: small business, middle-market, and big business. According to figures collected by the U.S. Census Bureau, the total revenue of all U.S. businesses in 2012 was roughly $32.6 trillion.http://www2.census.gov/econ/susb/data/2012/us_6digitnaics_r_2012.xlsx The largest of these companies, which are big businesses with revenue of over $3 billion,http://fortune.com/fortune500/2012 make up roughly one-third of that total, and businesses with a revenue of under $100 million made up about another third of the total revenue. The middle market can thus be defined as the companies larger than small businesses but smaller than big businesses that account for the middle third of the U.S. economy‚Äôs revenue. Each of these companies earns an annual revenue of between $100 million and $3 billion. CEO Connection Mid-Market Definition Other authorities define middle-market firms differently. The National Center for the Middle Market at the Ohio State University Fisher College of Business as well as Dun & Bradstreet‚Äôs proprietary database of commercially-active U.S. firms define middle market businesses as those companies with revenues between $10 million and $1 billion per year. The definition is defined in reference to small businesses, which earn less than $10 million in annual revenue, and big business, which earn at least $1 billion in revenues and are generally the smallest eligible for a credit rating by one of the \\"major\\" credit-rating agencies. Investopedia considers middle market firms to be those with sizable annual revenues, ranging from $50 million to $1 billion,http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/middle-market-firms.asp which straddle the market between smaller companies and billion-dollar giants.  In the United States  The 200,000 plus US-based mid-market companies are essential to America‚Äôs economic success. They account for $10 trillion annually of the $30 trillion U.S. private sector gross receipts and 30 million jobs. NASDAQ Mid-Market Definition If the U.S. middle market were a country, its GDP would rank it as the fourth-largest economy in the world. National Center for the Middle Market While there are good sources of information about CEOs of large companies and small businesses; there is relatively little information about mid-size companies and their CEOs. As a consequence their issues and needs are underrepresented in policy and economic discussions.  In Europe  Mid-market companies‚Äîcompanies that are too big to be considered SMEs, but smaller than big, exchange listed businesses‚Äîplay a key role in the UK and in the other top European economies. According to an in depth report by ESSEC Business School and GE Capital, across the UK, Germany, France and Italy (the EU-4), the mid-market represents a relatively small number of companies (ranging from a low of 1.2% in Germany to 1.7% in France) and yet it generates about one third of private sector revenue and employs about a third of each country‚Äôs workforce. Combined, the middle market in the four European countries contributes ‚Ç¨1.11 trillion ($1.48 trillion) to the EU-4 GDP. This makes the middle market in the EU-4 one of the top 10 economies in the world, ahead of India and Russia. In the study, Professor Ashwin Malshe of ESSEC defined the middle market differently for each country. For example, Italy has 3.7 million firms with revenue of less than‚Ç¨5 million, while Germany has only 1.7 million companies this size this means that applying a single European or global definition of a mid-market firm is difficult. In the UK, mid-market firms are those with between ¬£15m and ¬£800m of annual revenues. The average UK middle market firm has revenue of ¬£78 million (‚Ç¨98 million) and employs 500 people, similar in size to its German counterparts but larger than the typical mid-market firm in France or Italy. Middle-market organizations Entities have evolved to serve businesses in the middle market, including for-profit and institutions of higher learning. In the latter category, the Graziadio School of Private Capital Markets at Pepperdine University produces quarterly and annual data on the middle market via their Private Capital Markets Project. Other entities include the Association for Corporate Growth (ACG), which provides a global community for mergers, acquisitions, and corporate growth professionals. ACG's stated objective is to drive middle-market growth. ACG publishes Middle Market Growth online. Middle Market Growth International alliances such as Alliott Group bring together independent local practices that offer professional services (accounting, tax and legal) to middle market companies targeting growth through expansion to the international marketplace.

The series takes place in Tokyo, Japan, where the members of Deimon Devil Bats have the ambition to compete at the Christmas Bowl, the most important high school American football championship of the country. The main character of the series is Sena Kobayakawa, a wimpy boy who was a gofer to avoid being bullied during his childhood; he enters Deimon High School. While he runs away from the Ha-Ha Brothers his running ability is witnessed by Yoichi Hiruma, the captain of the Deimon Devil Bats, the school's American football team. After this, Hiruma coerces Sena to join the club under the alias \\"Eyeshield 21\\" to keep him from being recruited by other teams. Sena and Hiruma along with the other member of the club, Ryokan Kurita, try to recruit new players to compete at the Christmas Bowl. While developing the characters, Murata intended to create characters who have unique qualities and that could stand out amidst the teams they are included. He focused his work on the characters' outfits since he thought it was the thing that would be most noted during the matches. Inagaki also used real-world influence for the teams. Most reviewers have praised the characters of the series, declaring that the characters are one of the best elements of the Eyeshield 21 series as they are distinguishable. Creation and conception When Riichiro Inagaki and Yusuke Murata were creating the Eyeshield 21 series, Murata was concerned that each character had a stand-out quality because many of them are in groups. Murata said that \\"due to their heavy protective gear, it would be very difficult to identify personal characteristics in games\\" and because of this he decided to become more engaged in detailing their clothes, \\"so the most work on character designs are on their uniforms\\". Inagaki conceived the teams knowing that \\"each team has its own style\\", and designed the characters prior to assigning them a team. Main characters The main characters of the Eyeshield 21 series are part of an American football team based on The Deimon Devil Bats were founded by Yoichi Hiruma, Ryokan Kurita, and Musashi under the name of After its inaugural year, they need to refound the team in Deimon. However, its membership was further reduced with the departure of Musashi. This remains the case until Hiruma discovers Sena Kobayakawa and his amazing running ability. For the creation of Deimon Devil Bats' uniform, Murata was inspired by the Philadelphia Eagles' gear and helmets, and for its logo he created six prototypes, saying he \\"spent a lot of work on designing the logo\\". =Sena Kobayakawa= : is one of the main characters in the Eyeshield 21 series. During his childhood, he was a shy boy who was bullied and needed to be protected by Mamori Anezaki. Seeing this, Riku Kaitani, a young friend of Sena, taught him a running technique he referred to as the \\"explosive run\\" so Sena could defend himself. However, Sena used this to become a gofer for others instead of getting rid of bullies. In his first day at Deimon High School, he is chased by three bullies known as the Ha-Ha Brothers and his speed is discovered by Hiruma. Under the alias \\"Eyeshield 21\\" because of the green eyeshield he wears to conceal his identity, Sena joins Deimon's football team as a running back. =Yoichi Hiruma= : is the captain and the quarterback of the Deimon Devil Bats. When he was a child, Hiruma learned about American football after crawling through a hole in a fence of an American military base. He befriended Ryokan Kurita and Musashi, and with them, founded the Mao Devil Bats. After completing middle school he intended to join the Shinryuji Naga, but as Kurita failed the entrance exam, he entered Deimon. Along with Kurita and Musashi, he re-established their former club, Mao Devil Bats, but renamed the team the Deimon Devil Bats.

Scott Green of Ain't It Cool News described the characters \\"recognizable as people\\" and praised Eyeshield 21, for \\"taking the personal relationships a little less serious, but going a bit overboard with the motion and personalities\\". Mania.com's Jarred Pine classified the characters as \\"very likeable\\", and said that because they have \\"their own personalities\\" they \\"are instantly memorable\\". Chris Zimmerman from Comic Book Bin praised the development of the characters through the manga series. Chris Homer of The Fandom Post also commended the characters' development in the anime series and said that some of them, such as Ikkyu and Ishimaru, were better developed in comparison to the manga.

Santos commented, \\"Just as thrilling as the game highlights are the individual stories and rivalries behind each player\\". On the other hand, Eyeshield 21 has a lot of teams with different themes and according to Chris Beveridge from Mania.com some times \\"the theme is used more than it should\\" and that \\"it just feels very forced\\".

Life He was the great-grandson of Sir William Ayloffe, 1st Baronet, through his third wife (Alice, daughter of James Stokes of Stoke near Coventry), their first son was Joseph Ayloffe, of Gray's inn. His has a son, Joseph Ayloffe, barrister-at-law of Gray's Inn and sometime recorder of Kingston upon Thames, who died in 1726 and was this man's father. Joseph was born in Sussex, and became 6th Baronet Ayloffe, of Braxted Magna; on his death, his baronetcy became extinct. Ayloffe was educated at Westminster School, was admitted a student of Lincoln's Inn in 1724, and spent some time at St John's College, Oxford, before 1728. In December 1730 he succeeded, as sixth in succession, to the family baronetcy on the death of his unmarried cousin, the Rev. Sir John Ayloffe, a descendant of the first family of the original holder of the title. Sir Joseph seems very early in life to have manifested an interest in antiquities, which received at once the recognition of the learned, although for many years he was merely collecting information and published nothing. On 10 February 1731-2 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and on 27 May of the same year a fellow of the Royal Society. Seven years later he became a member of the well-known literary club‚Äî'the Gentlemen's Society at Spalding.' But he did not confine himself altogether to antiquarian research. In 1736-7 he was appointed secretary to the commission superintending the erection of Westminster Bridge; in 1750 he was auditor-general of the hospitals of Bethlehem and Bridewell; and in 1763, on the removal of the state archives from Whitehall and the establishment of a State Paper Office at the Treasury, he was nominated one of its three keepers. In 1751 Ayloffe took a prominent part in procuring a charter of incorporation for the Society of Antiquaries, of which he was for many years a vice- president, and at its meetings he very frequently read papers. He died at Kensington on 19 April 1781, and with him the baronetcy became extinct. He married, about 1734, Margaret, daughter of Charles Railton of Carlisle, by whom he had one son, who died of smallpox at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1766. Both father and son were buried in Hendon churchyard. Sir Joseph was the intimate friend of his colleague at the State Paper Office, Thomas Astle, and of Richard Gough; the latter described Ayloffe as the English Montfaucon. Works Ayloffe's published writings belong to his later life, and were never very successful with the general public. In 1751 he circulated proposals for printing by subscription the debates in parliament prior to the Restoration, in eight octavo volumes. But little favour was apparently extended to the scheme; although in 1773 it was advertised that the first volumes would soon be sent to press, none appear to have been published (cf. Rawlinson MSS. in the Bodleian, s. v. 'Ayloffe'). It was also in 1751 that Sir Joseph issued a prospectus inviting subscribers for a translation of Diderot's and D'Alembert's Encyclop√©die, with additional or expanded articles on subjects of English interest. But the first number, which was published on 11 June 1752, obtained such scanty support, and was so severely handled in the Gentleman's Magazine (xxii. 46), that the project was immediately abandoned. Some years previously Ayloffe had induced Joshua Kirby, a well-known draughtsman of Ipswich, to prepare a number of engravings of the chief buildings and monuments in Suffolk, and twelve of them were published with descriptive letterpress by Ayloffe in 1748. It was Ayloffe's intention to introduce Kirby's drawings into an elaborate history of the county upon which he was apparently engaged for the succeeding fifteen years. In 1764 he had made so much progress in collecting and arranging his materials that he published a lengthy prospectus for the publication of an exhaustive Topographical and Historical Description of Suffolk, but unfortunately he here again received too little encouragement to warrant him in pursuing his elaborate plan. Subsequently, he contributed several memoirs to Arch√¶ologia, the journal of the Society of Antiquaries, which were highly valued at the time. On 25 February 1763 he 'communicated' an interesting Copy of a Proclamation (1563) relating to Persons making Portraits of Queen Elizabeth (ii. 169-170). In 1773 and 1774 there appeared in Arch√¶ologia (iii. 185-229,2.39-272, 376-413) three papers by Ayloffe, describing, * a picture at Windsor of the famous interview in 1520 between Henry VIII and Francis I; *four pictures at Cowdray near Midhurst, the property of Lord Montague, illustrating Henry VIII's wars in France in the latter part of his reign; and *the opening of the tomb of Edward I at Westminster in 1774, an exhumation that Ayloffe with Daines Barrington superintended. Another paper prepared for the Society of Antiquaries, On Five Monuments in Westminster Abbey, was published separately, with engravings, in 1780. An account of the chapel on London Bridge, by Ayloffe, was published with a drawing by George Vertue in 1777. In 1772 Ayloffe published the work by which he is still known to historical students. It is entitled 'Calendars of the Ancient Charters, and of the Welsh and Scottish Rolls, Now Remaining in the Tower of London . . . to Which are Added Memoranda Concerning the Affairs of Ireland [and an] Account of the State of The Public Records [etc.]. London, 1774. This work, with an introduction (attributed principally to Thomas Astle) traces at length the history and neglect of the Public Records. In a lengthy introduction the author impresses on historians the necessity of scholarly research among the state papers. The book was begun by the Rev. Philip Morant, who was at one time employed at the State Paper Office, and was published at first anonymously. But in 1774 a new issue gave Sir Joseph Ayloffe's name on the title-page. Ayloffe also revised for the press new editions of John Leland's Collectanea (1771) and of the Liber Niger Scaccarii (1771), and added valuable appendices of original illustrative documents. He saw through the press John Thorpe's Registrum Roffense, which was published in 1769 by the compiler's son. Ayloffe's Collections relative to Saxon and English Laws and Antiquities remain in manuscript at the British Museum (Addit. MS. 9051). We have been unable to trace the whereabouts of his other manuscript collections, which were clearly very numerous, and are stated by contemporaries to have been invaluable so far as they related to the abbey and city of Westminster. His library was sold by Leigh and Sotheby soon after his death. Notes References * ;Attribution: sources: [Annual Register for 1781; Gent.

The History of Sir Charles Grandison, commonly called Sir Charles Grandison, is an epistolary novel by English writer Samuel Richardson first published in February 1753. The book was a response to Henry Fielding's The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, which parodied the morals presented in Richardson's previous novels. The novel follows the story of Harriet Byron who is pursued by Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. After she rejects Pollexfen, he kidnaps her, and she is only freed when Sir Charles Grandison comes to her rescue. After his appearance, the novel focuses on his history and life, and he becomes its central figure. The novel incorporates an epistolary format similar to Richardson's previous novels, Clarissa and Pamela. Unlike those novels, Charles Grandison, the leading male character, is a morally good man and lacks the villainous intent that is manifested by the Lovelace or Mr. B (characters of Clarissa and Pamela respectively). Richardson was motivated to create such a male figure because of the prompting of his many female friends who wanted a counterpart to the virtues exhibited by Richardson's female characters. Background The exact relationship between Fielding's The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling and Richardson's The History of Sir Charles Grandison cannot be known, but the character Charles Grandison was designed as a morally \\"better\\" hero than the character Tom Jones. In 1749, a friend asked Richardson \\"to give the world his idea of a good man and fine gentleman combined\\". Richardson hesitated to begin such a project, and he did not work on it until he was prompted the next year (June 1750) by Mrs. Donnelland and Miss Sutton, who were \\"both very intimate with one Clarissa Harlowe: and both extremely earnest with him to give them a good man\\". Near the end of 1751, Richardson sent a draft of the novel to Mrs. Donnellan, and the novel was being finalised in the middle of 1752. While Thomas Killingbeck, a compositor, and Peter Bishop, a proofreader, were working for Richardson in his print shop during 1753, Richardson discovered that printers in Dublin had copies of The History of Sir Charles Grandison and began printing the novel before the English edition was to be published. Richardson suspected that they were involved with the unauthorized distribution of the novel and promptly fired them. Immediately following the firing, Richardson wrote to Lady Bradshaigh, 19 October 1753: \\"the Want of the same Ornaments, or Initial Letters [factotums], in each Vol. will help to discover them [if exported into England], although they should put the Booksellers Names that I have affixed. I have got some Friends to write down to Scotland, to endeavour to seize their Edition, if offered to be imported\\". There were four Dublin presses used to make unauthorized copies the novel, but none of them were able to add the ornaments that could effectively mimic Richardson's own. However, there were still worries about the unlicensed copies, and Richardson relied on seven additional printers to speed up the production of Grandison. In November 1753, Richardson ran an ad in The Gentleman's Magazine to announce the \\"History of Sir Charles Grandison: in a Series of Letters published from the Originals, ‚Äî By the Editor of Pamela and Clarissa, London: Printed for S. Richardson, and sold by Dodsley in Pall Mall and others.\\" The first four volumes were published on 13 November 1753 and the next two volumes appeared in December. The final volume was published in March to complete a seven volume series while a six volume set was simultaneously published. Richardson held the sole copyright to Grandison, and, after his death, twenty-fourth shares of Grandison were sold for 20 pounds each. Posthumous editions were published in 1762 (including revisions by Richardson) and 1810. Plot summary As with his previous novels, Richardson prefaced the novel by claiming to be merely the editor, saying, \\"How such remarkable collections of private letters fell into the editor's hand he hopes the reader will not think it very necessary to enquire\\". However, Richardson did not keep his authorship secret and, on the prompting of his friends like Samuel Johnson, dropped this framing device from the second edition. The novel begins with the character of Harriet Byron leaving the house of her uncle, George Selby, to visit Mr. and Mrs. Reeves, her cousins, in London. She is an orphan who was educated by her grandparents, and, though she lacks parents, she is heir to a fortune of fifteen thousand pounds, which causes many suitors to pursue her. In London, she is pursued by three suitors, Mr. Greville, Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Orme. This courtship is followed by more suitors: Mr. Fowler, Sir Rowland Meredith and Sir Hargrave Pollexfen. The final one, Pollexfen, pursues Byron vigorously, which causes her to criticise him over a lack of morals and decency of character. However, Pollexfen does not end his pursuits of Byron until she explains that she could never receive his visits again. Pollexfen, unwilling to be without Byron, decides to kidnap her while she attended a masquerade at the Haymarket. She is then imprisoned at Lisson Grove with the support of a widow and two daughters. While he keeps her prisoner, Pollexfen makes it clear to her that she shall be his wife, and that anyone who challenges that will die by his hand. Byron attempts to escape from the house, but this fails. To prevent her from trying to escape again, Pollexfen transports Byron to his home at Windsor. However, he is stopped at Hounslow Heath, where Charles Grandison hears Byron's pleas for help and immediately attacks Pollexfen. After this rescue, Grandison takes Byron to Colnebrook, the home of Grandison's brother-in-law, the \\"Earl of L.\\". After Pollexfen recovers from the attack, he sets out to duel Grandison. However, Grandison refuses on the grounds that dueling is harmful to society. After explaining why obedience to God and society are important, Grandison wins Pollexfen over and obtains his apology to Byron for his actions. She accepts his apology, and he follows with a proposal to marriage. She declines because she, as she admits, is in love with Grandison. However, a new suitor, the Earl of D, appears, and it emerges that Grandison promised himself to an Italian woman, Signorina Clementina della Porretta. As Grandison explains, he was in Italy years before and rescued the Barone della Porretta and a relationship developed between himself and Clementina, the baron's only daughter. However, Grandison could not marry her, as she demanded that he, an Anglican Protestant, become a Catholic, and he was unwilling to do so. After he left, she grew ill out of despair, and the Porrettas were willing to accept his religion, if he would return and make Clementina happy once more. Grandison, feeling obligated to do what he can to restore Clementina's happiness, returns to Italy; however, Clementina determines she can never marry a \\"heretic\\", and so Grandison returns to England and Harriet who accepts him. They are married; and everyone is accorded their just deserts. In a \\"Concluding Note\\" to Grandison, Richardson writes: \\"It has been said, in behalf of many modern fictitious pieces, in which authors have given success (and happiness, as it is called) to their heroes of vicious if not profligate characters, that they have exhibited Human Nature as it is. Its corruption may, indeed, be exhibited in the faulty character; but need pictures of this be held out in books? Is not vice crowned with success, triumphant, and rewarded, and perhaps set off with wit and spirit, a dangerous representation?\\" In particular, Richardson is referring to novels of Fielding, his literary rival. This note was published with the final volume of Grandison in March 1754, a few months before Fielding left for Lisbon. Before Fielding died in Lisbon, he included a response to Richardson in his preface to Journal of a Voyage to Lisbon. Structure Samuel Richardson reading aloud the manuscript of Sir Charles Grandison to a group of friends in 1751. Coloured Engraving by Miss Highmore. National Portrait Gallery, Westminster, England. The epistolary form unites The History of Sir Charles Grandison with Richardson's Pamela and Clarissa, but Richardson uses the form in a different way for his final work. In Clarissa, the letters emphasise the plot's drama, especially when Lovelace alters Clarissa's letters. However, the dramatic mood is replaced in Grandison with a celebration of Grandison's moral character. In addition to this lack of dramatic emphasis, the letters of Grandison do not serve to develop character, as the moral core of each character is already complete at the outset. In Richardson's previous novels, the letters operated as a way to express internal feelings and describe the private lives of characters; however, the letters of Grandison serve a public function. The letters are not kept to individuals, but forwarded to others to inform a larger community of the novel's action. In return, letters share the recipients' responses to the events detailed within the letters. This sharing of personal feelings transforms the individual responders into a chorus that praises the actions of Grandison, Harriet, and Clementina. Furthermore, this chorus of characters emphasises the importance of the written word over the merely subjective, even saying that \\"Love declared on paper means far more than love declared orally\\". Themes 20th century literary critic Carol Flynn characterises Sir Charles Grandison as a \\"man of feeling who truly cannot be said to feel\\". Flynn claims that Grandison is filled with sexual passions that never come to light, and he represents a perfect moral character in regards to respecting others. Unlike Richardson's previous novel Clarissa, there is an emphasis on society and how moral characteristics are viewed by the public. As such, Grandison stresses characters acting in the socially accepted ways instead of following their emotional impulses. The psychological realism of Richardson's earlier work gives way to the expression of exemplars. In essence, Grandison promises \\"spiritual health and happiness to all who follow the good man's exemplary pattern\\". This can be taken as a sort of \\"political model of the wise ruler\\", especially with Charles's somewhat pacifist methods of achieving his goals. Although Flynn believes that Grandison represents a moral character, she finds Grandison's \\"goodness\\" \\"repellent\\". Richardson's other characters, like Clarissa, also exhibit high moral characters, but they are capable of changing over time. However, Grandison is never challenged in the way that Clarissa is, and he is a static, passive character. Grandison, in all situations, obeys the dictates of society and religion, fulfilling obligations rather than expressing personality. However, a character like Harriet is able to express herself fully, and it is possible that Grandison is prohibited from doing likewise because of his epistolary audience, the public. In terms of religious responsibility, Grandison, is unwilling to change his faith, and Clementina initially refuses to marry him over his religion. Grandison attempts to convince her to reconsider by claiming that \\"her faith would not be at risk\\". Besides his dedication to his own religion, and his unwillingness to prevent Clementina from being dedicated to her own, he says that he is bound to helping the Porretta family. Although potentially controversial to the 18th century British public, Grandison and Clementina compromise by agreeing that their sons would be raised as Protestants and their daughters raised as Catholics. In addition to the religious aspects, the work gives \\"the portrait of how a good marriage should be created and sustained\\". To complement the role of marriage, Grandison opposes \\"sexual deviance\\" in the 18th century. Critical response Samuel Johnson was one of the first to respond to the novel, but he focused primarily on the preface: \\"If you were to require my opinion which part [in the preface] should be changed, I should be inclined to the supression of that part which seems to disclaim the composition. What is modesty, if it deserts from truth? Of what use is the disguise by which nothing is concealed? You must forgive this, because it is meant well.\\" Sarah Fielding, in her introduction to The Lives of Cleopatra and Octavia, claims that people have an \\"insatiable Curiosity for Novels or Romances\\" that tell of the \\"rural Innocence of a Joseph Andrews, or the inimitable Virtues of Sir Charles Grandison\\". Andrew Murphy, in the Gray's Inn Journal, emphasised the history of the production when he wrote: Sir Walter Scott, who favoured the bildungsroman and open plots, wrote in his \\"Prefatory Memoir to Richardson\\" to The Novels of Samuel Richardson (1824): Although Scott is antipathetic towards Richardson's final novel, not everyone was of the same opinion; Jane Austen was a devotee of the novel, which was part of her mental furniture to the point where she could claim to describe \\"all that was ever said or done in the cedar parlour\\". She would for example casually compare a flower in a new cap she got to the white feather described by Harriet Byron as being in hers. Nevertheless, throughout her life she also subjected Grandison to much affectionate, even satirical mockery \\\\- adapting it into a dramatic lampoon (not published until 1980) around 1800. Her juvenilia also included a heroine who guyed Harriet Byron's frequent fainting, through being \\"in such a hurry to have a succession of fainting fits, that she had scarcely patience enough to recover from one before she fell into another\\". As late as 1813, she would respond to a long letter from her sister Cassandra by exclaiming \\"Dear me!...Like Harriet Byron I ask, what am I to do with my Gratitude\\". Later critics believed that it is possible that Richardson's work failed because the story deals with a \\"good man\\" instead of a \\"rake\\", which prompted Richardson's biographers Thomas Eaves and Ben Kimpel to claim, this \\"might account for the rather uneasy relationship between the story of the novel and the character of its hero, who is never credible in his double love ‚Äì or in any love.\\" Flynn agrees that this possibility is an \\"attractive one\\", and conditions it to say that \\"it is at least certain that the deadly weighted character of Sir Charles stifles the dramatic action of the book.\\" John Mullan suggests that the problem stems from Grandison's role as a hero when he says, \\"his hero is able to display his virtue in action; as a consequence, Sir Charles Grandison presents its protagonist without the minutely analyzed reflexes of emotion that brought his heroines to life.\\" Some critics, such as Mark Kinkead-Weekes and Margaret Doody, like the novel and emphasise the importance of the moral themes that Richardson takes up. In a 1987 article, Kinkead-Weekes admits that the \\"novel fails at the [moral] crisis\\" and \\"it must be doubtful whether it could hope for much life in the concluding volumes\\". However, critics such as Jean Howard Hagstrum believe that \\"Richardson's last novel is considerably better than can be easily imagined by those who have only heard about it. But admittedly it represents a falling off after Clarissa\\". Morris Golden simply claims that the novel is a book for old men.

The site of the treaty was a historic meeting place along the Delaware River used by the Lenape (Delaware) Indians in North America. It was located within what are now the borders of the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. From the Lenape term \\"Sakimauchheen Ing\\" (pronounced Sak-i- mauch-heen Ing) which means \\"to make a chief or king place\\"; called \\"Shackamaxon\\" by the English, Dutch, and Swedes. It was where the Lenapi \\"crowned\\" their many family \\"sakima\\" (chief) or their three clan \\"kitakima\\" (big or clan chief) of the Lenape Nation. Others have interpreted the name to mean \\"the place of eels\\", which refers to it as being an important summer fishing spot for the Native Americans. The area is the modern neighborhoods of Fishtown, Kensington, and Port Richmond in Philadelphia. Purportedly, in late 1682,Penn did not arrive in North America until late in October of that year. William Penn made a treaty with the Lenni Lenape under an ancient elm tree. Francis Jennings argues that William Penn very likely signed a treaty, but that his less scrupulous sons, William Jr., John, and Thomas, destroyed the original document. Through such means, according to Jennings, the younger Penns sought to renege on the treaty to which their father had agreed. Curators of the Philadelphia History Museum at Atwater Kent claim that a wampum belt in their possession serves as authentication that such a meeting did indeed take place. However, the wampum belt cannot prove or disprove whether the Lenni Lenape and the colony came to a formal agreement, and if so, what the provisions of such an agreement entailed. The wampum belt given to William Penn by the Indians at the \\"Great Treaty\\" under the Shackamaxon elm tree, 1682 The legend of such a treaty was immortalized in several works of art (in particular, Benjamin West's paintings) and was mentioned by the French author Voltaire. The legendary elm tree marking the spot blew down in a storm on March 5, 1810. Its location was memorialized by the placing of an obelisk in 1827 by the Penn Society. The legendary event was further memorialized by the founding of a park in 1893, known as Penn Treaty Park. Six Swedish families were recorded as living in this area before Penn's arrival. The Swedes sold out to the new English settlers. In the 18th century, the territory of Shackamaxon was developed as part of the Port Richmond, Fishtown, and Kensington sections of Philadelphia. Today there is a Shackamaxon Street in Philadelphia which runs several blocks through Fishtown. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission refers to the Shackamaxon treaty on its website.

It uses the aforementioned appellation in order to distinguish itself from its better known splinter group, the Communist Party of the Philippines.  History  The founding members of the PKP came from members of the Partido Obrero de Filipinas, a labor-centered party formed in opposition to the leading Nacionalista and the Democrata parties at the time. Most of the members of the Partido Obrero were also leading figures in the labor movement, including PKP founders Crisanto Evangelista, Antonio Ora, Jacinto Manahan, and Domingo Ponce. Evangelista and his group were increasingly being radicalized towards left-wing politics through their increasing involvement with the Comintern, Profintern, and the CPUSA. Particularly, in 1928, Evanglista, Manahan, and Cirilo Bognot went to the Soviet Union to attend the Profintern's Fourth Congress. These people were also leading figures in the Congreso Obrero de Filipinas, the leading trade federation at the time. In 1928, conservative elements of the COF were alarmed by the increasing radicalization of Evangelista and his group, and took advantage of their absence by calling a national convention on May 1 of that year. The incumbent president, Francisco Varona was ousted along with Evangelista, and were replaced by Hilario Barroga and Domingo Ponce, respectively. Some authors claim the move was orchestrated by Evangelista's enemies in the COF: Ruperto Cristobal, Isabelo Tejada, and Antonio Paguia, however others dispute the nature of this election and point out that Ponce and Ora being elected to positions in the COF points to its increasing radicalization. In the previous year, the Partido Obrero almost received official backing from the COF, the resolution only being shot down by a single vote. Evangelista had plans for radical reorganization of the trade union movement, which would lay the groundwork for the communist movement in the Philippines. These plans were almost thwarted in 1928, but Evangelista chose to bide his time for the following year's conference. The next year, Evangelista and his group submitted a draft thesis which called for measures such as the adoption of a collective leadership, establishment of a workers' party, the promotion of class struggle, and so on. The thesis was allowed to pass to the May convention, where the conservative group allegedly used dummy labor delegates to ensure that the radical measure was blocked. Evangelista and his group walked out of the convention, and the COF was split. Twelve days later on May 12, 1929, a new labor federation known as the Katipunan ng mga Anakpawis sa Pilipinas (KAP) was formed, consisting of 27 of the 35 unions of the COF. On August 26 of the next year, a new political party was organized from members of the KAP, the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas.. The party itself was formalized as an official entity on November 7 of the same year. These two dates correspond with the Cry of Pugad Lawin and the Russian Revolution, respectively, symbolically linking the PKP with the nationalist and the communist revolutions. The newly formed PKP immediately set out with its propaganda effort. The PKP launched an aggressive organizational and propaganda drive among the peasants of Central Luzon and Manila, holding public meetings almost daily. In January 1931, the PKP opened its national headquarters in Quiapo, Manila, and also launched its official organ, the Titis (Spark), reminiscent of Lenin's Iskra. During this time, multiple incidents were attributed to the communists. On January 10, 1931, a peasant uprising occurred in Tayug, Pangasinan. This was blamed on the communists, although the PKP itself was castigated by a foreign critic of not coordinating with the peasant rebels. Besides the Tayug revolt, other peasant uprisings that occurred during the time were attributed to the PKP, and at time the PKP took credit for them, although the truth was that at the time the PKP was weak organizationally. Most members, including Evangelista, believed that the root of the revolution should come from the urban centers, while people like Manahan, Feleo, Guillermo Capadocia, and Mateo del Castillo believed that a strong peasant base was important in achieving the communist revolution. Nevertheless, the PKP had no strong base in Central Luzon at the time. In 1931, Antonio Ora died in an automobile accident in Nueva Ecija. Ora was a high-ranking member of the PKP politburo and central committee, widely regarded to be second only to Evangelista. Ora's funeral became the site of widespread demonstration, with as many as 50,000 workers marching through Manila. A wake was held in Ora's hometown and was attended by 3,000 peasants. The most major incident concerning the first PKP was on May 1, 1931, when the communists were barred from holding their traditional Labor Day demonstration in Manila. The PKP instead transferred their celebration to Caloocan, under the auspices of the KAP. This permit, however, was also revoked hours before the start of the scheduled start of the parade. A contingent of the Philippine Constabulary, under Captain Rafael Jalandoni arrived to order Evangelista to cancel the parade. Evangelista instead raised his clenched fist and began an incendiary speech, and said: > Comrades or brethren, the municipal president, Mr. Aquino, has allowed us to > hold the parade, but for reasons unknown to me the permit has been revoked. > This shows that the big ones are persecuting and oppressing us, who are > small, which they have no right to do. After this, Abelardo Ramos cried out, \\"Let us die fighting them!\\" Evangelista attempted to continue his speech when the PC arrested him and Ramos. The assembled crowd then tried to advance on the constabulary but were forcibly dispersed by peace officers. Based on these events, the Manila Court of First Instance, on September 14, 1931, passed a decision declaring both the PKP and KAP as illegal organization, and sentencing twenty communist leaders of eight years and one day of banishment to the provinces. Evangelista was additionally sentenced with six months' imprisonment and a fine of 400 pesos for sedition. The convicted communists brought an appeal to the Supreme Court, which affirmed the Manila CFI decision on October 26, 1932. The American administration in the Philippines acknowledged and recognized that the convicted communists such as Evangelista, Manahan, Capadocia, and Balgos were leaders in their trades and their cooperation would have been most beneficial. These men were given offers for executive clemency but were adamant in their refusal. Eventually Manahan would accept pardon from Gov. Frank Murphy in 1935, partly due to ideological differences between him and Evangelista, and partly due to the intervention of Manuel Quezon. This, combined with Quezon assuming the presidency of the Commonwealth with his liberalism and genuine desire to garner the support of labor groups, allowed for an opening in rapprochement between him and Evangelista. The adoption of a United Front against fascism by the Comintern also played a part in their release. In 1936, James S. Allen, a high-ranking official of the CPUSA came to the Philippines to persuade Evangelista's group of accepting even a conditional pardon, under the argument that a united front must be maintained against world fascism. Allen then went to Quezon to successfully request the release of the communist leaders on December 31, 1936. He then returned in 1938 to secure an absolute pardon for the communist leaders, which was granted on December 24 of that same year. Given their full political rights, they were now able to act and implement the Comintern's call for a united-front movement against fascism. Allen then mediated between Abad Santos' SPP and Evangelista's PKP to form a merger, despite their ideological differences. The new party was officially called the Communist Party of the Philippines (merger of the Communist and Socialist parties), but was simply referred to as the Communist Party of the Philippines for short. The three top officers of the new PKP were Evangelista, Abad Santos and Capadocia, who were national chairman, vice-chairman, and general secretary, respectively. In 1935, PKP was accepted into the Comintern. In 1937 the PKP was legalized again, under the Commonwealth in response to the growing threat of fascism in Germany and militarist Japan. And in 1938 the Socialist Party was merged into the PKP. The PKP participated in a Popular Front for municipal elections in 1940, which did well on the island of Luzon, where six communist mayors were elected. = Resistance against Japan and the United States = During World War II, the PKP helped organize the fight against the Japanese invasion. Under PKP leadership, the Hukbalahap (People's Army against Japan) was created in 1942 under the leadership of Luis Taruc and Vicente Lava. The Hukbalahap carried on a struggle against the Japanese occupation for the next three years. After the end of Japanese occupation, the PKP found itself in a considerably strengthened position in the working class and peasant movements. The Congress of Labor Organizations was created in July 1945 under PKP management. In 1946 PKP participated in the presidential elections within the Democratic Alliance. In 1948, the PKP began an armed struggle against the government. The party was banned that year. In early 1950, the PKP created the People's Liberation Army (Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan) which was made up of about 10,000 soldiers. On October 18, 1950, the entire secretariat of the Central Committee of the PKP was arrested, including General Secretary Jose Lava, following the earlier capture of the Politburo in ManilaTaruc, L., 1967, He Who Rides the Tiger, London: Geoffrey Chapman Ltd. (and would remain in prison for the next two decades). Jose had taken over the leadership when his brother Vicente died, and another brother, Jesus, took over after Jose's capture. In the course of the armed struggle, PKP and the People's Liberation Army sustained large losses. By the end of 1954 the armed struggle was effectively over, although it took a few more years to die out, after which the PKP pursued a course of peaceful (legal and illegal) action. Although they created another guerilla force similar to the Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan, known as the Bagong Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan; more commonly known as the Army ng Bayan (or Ermeng Bayan according to the CPP), under Pedro Taruc and Sumulong. = Split = Remnants of the PKP worked from the underground to rebuild the organisations and affiliated groups. In 1964, Jose Maria Sison co-founded the Kabataang Makabayan (Patriotic Youth) with Nilo Tayag. This organization rallied the Filipino youth against the Vietnam War, against the Marcos presidency, and corrupt politicians. On December 26, 1968, he formed and chaired the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), an organisation within the Communist Party founded on Marxist‚ÄìLeninist-Mao Zedong Thought, stemming from his own experiences as a youth leader, labour, and land reform activist. This is known as the First Great Rectification Movement where Sison and other radical youths criticised the existing Party's leadership and failure. The reformed CPP included Maoism within the political line as well as the struggle for a National Democratic Revolution in two-stages, consisting of a protracted \\"People's War\\" as its first part to be followed by a Socialist Revolution. Soon after this, the leadership of the PKP sought to eliminate and marginalise Sison. However, the reorganised CPP had a larger base and renewed political line that attracted thousands to join its ranks. The old leadership and its followers was pro- Soviet, while the other, mostly younger faction was oriented towards Maoism. On December 26, 1968, the Maoist faction announced it was re-establishing the Communist Party of the Philippines. Over time the Maoist party eclipsed the pro-Soviet faction, which is now commonly referred to as PKP-1930. The PKP-1930 survived the martial law era as pro-government supporters, after being pardoned by President Ferdinand Marcos. They supported the government in its land reform programme, attempt for Land Collectivisation, and the \\"Democratic Revolution from the centre\\" envisioned by Marcos. The Maoist faction, led by Jose Maria Sison, continues to fight to this day. As of now, the PKP-1930 is a minor party and was lately led by Pedro P. Baguisa, and issues the publication Ang Komunista and being led by Antonio Paris.

Taffy is made by stretching or pulling a sticky mass of boiled sugar, butter or vegetable oil, flavorings, and colorings until it becomes aerated (meaning that tiny air bubbles are produced, resulting in a light, fluffy and chewy candy). When this process is complete, the taffy is rolled, cut into small pastel-colored pieces and wrapped in wax paper to keep it soft. It is usually fruit-flavored, but other flavors are common as well, including molasses and the \\"classic\\" (unflavored) taffy. US A recipe for the candy appeared in the 1887 White House cook book. Its ingredients are corn syrup, sugar, blackstrap molasses, coconut oil, salt, cotton stearine, mono and diglycerides, soy lecithin and artificial flavour. =Salt water taffy= Salt water taffy in a candy store in Portland, Oregon Salt water taffy is a variety of soft taffy originally produced and marketed in the Atlantic City, New Jersey area of the Jersey Shore starting in the 1880s.Genovese, Peter. \\"Chew on this: 125 years later, Jersey Shore still daffy over salt water taffy\\", The Newark Star Ledger, August 19, 2013. Its late 19th century appellation most likely originated in New Jersey, United States. Salt water taffy is still sold widely on the boardwalks in Atlantic City (including shops in existence since the 19th century), nearby Ocean City, and other popular beaches throughout the United States like Cape Cod. It is also popular in Atlantic Canada, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Modern commercial taffy is made primarily from corn syrup, glycerin and butter. The pulling process, which makes the candy lighter and chewier, consists of stretching out the mixture, folding it over and stretching it out again. Although it is called \\"salt water\\" taffy, it does not include any seawater but does contain both salt and water in its manufacture.\\"Recipe: Saltwater Taffy\\". Exploratorium, San Francisco, California, USA. In the local Philadelphia dialect, the term \\"taffy\\" without \\"salt water\\" refers to a lollipop. The original invention of the candy has several different stories circulating, likely all apocryphal. One relates to an assistant who substituted fresh water with sea water‚Äîeither through laziness or accident. Another cites a storm which caused ocean water to wash over the candy, which was consequently (and successfully) marketed with the appropriate name. Joseph Fralinger popularized the candy by boxing it and selling it in Atlantic City. Fralinger's first major competition came from candy maker Enoch James, who refined the recipe, making it less sticky and easier to unwrap. James also cut the candy into bite-sized pieces, and is credited with mechanizing the \\"pulling\\" process. The candy was also sold mail order; in 1926 sheet music was commissioned by James with the title \\"Send Home Some Taffy Today!\\" Both Fralinger's and James's stores still operate on the Atlantic City boardwalk. Both companies have been owned and operated by the Glaser family since 1947. On August 21, 1923, John Edmiston obtained a trademark for the name \\"salt water taffy\\" (number 172,016), then demanded royalties from companies using his newly acquired name. He was sued over this demand, and in 1925, the trademark was invalidated as being in common use. Caramel candies are sometimes referred to as taffy (taffy apples), but are very different from common salt water taffy. Ingredients Salt water taffy stretching and wrapping machines Salt water taffy is composed of sugar, cornstarch, corn syrup, glycerine, water, butter, salt, natural and/or artificial flavor, and food color. Some examples of flavoring include vanilla, lemon, maple, banana, red licorice, watermelon, raspberry or mint extracts. Despite its name, the taffy contains no salt water (seawater), but does contain both salt and water. UK In the United Kingdom, taffy pieces are known as \\"chews\\" or \\"fruit chews\\"‚Äîthe term \\"taffy\\" is practically unknown. Popular brands of chew include Chewits and Starburst (Opal Fruits). Canada In Canada, a form of molasses taffy candy, known as \\"hallowe'en kisses\\", is produced in time for the Hallowe'en occasion. The candy was first offered by the Kerr's Canadian candy company in the 1940s. At the time, a molasses candy was made by Stewart and Young in Glasgow.

He wrote several books, including A Fresh Start; Know and Tell the Gospel; Setting Hearts on Fire, A Sinner's Guide to Holiness; and Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life, all published by Matthias Media. The Australian edition of A Fresh Start has sold nearly 40,000 copies since 1999. Having begun his career as a teacher, Chapman shifted to Anglican ministry, his first curacy being at Moree. There he organised the Billy Graham Crusade landline services for the whole of Moree there. He started an interchurch prayer meeting in the Warriors Chapel of Moree's Anglican church in 1959 which is still going today. This is where he met Preston Walker, Aborigines Welfare District Officer and member of the Moree Methodist Church who later joined the British and Foreign Bible Society. Chapman valued the Christian fellowship of Preston and Kath Walker as they were former United Aborigines Mission missionaries from Western Australia and were evangelical Christians. Chapman taught woodwork in Moree before becoming a curate at Moree. For 25 years he was the Director of the Anglican Department of Evangelism in Sydney, after beginning his career as a school teacher prior to theological training. In his retirement he continued to teach at Bible colleges, to speak at conventions around the world and to find time for the occasional game of tennis and golf. Thousands heard his \\"persuasive, sane and happy preaching\\" presentations of the Gospel. But it was his shaping of young preachers, from Phillip Jensen to Steve Chong that brought him a lasting legacy. The single men's accommodation at Moore Theological College was renamed John Chapman House in Chapman's honour. A biography, written by Michael Orpwood, was published in 1995 entitled Chappo: For the Sake of the Gospel. The foreword was provided by Dick Lucas - formerly rector of St Helen's Bishopsgate - a long-standing friend of Chapman.

He specialized in phase transitions, such as those occurring when an insulator suddenly becomes a conductor or when water freezes. In that context, he also did important work on complicated spatially modulated (magnetic) structures in solids. This research led him to the more general question of how organization emerges from disorder. In 1987, he and two postdoctoral researchers, Chao Tang and Kurt Wiesenfeld, published an article in Physical Review Letters setting a new concept they called self-organized criticality. The first discovered example of a dynamical system displaying such self-organized criticality, the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model, was named after them. Faced with many skeptics, Bak pursued the implications of his theory at a number of institutions, including the Brookhaven National Laboratory, the Santa Fe Institute, the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, and Imperial College London, where he became a professor in 2000. In 1996, he took his ideas to a broader audience with his ambitiously entitled book, How Nature Works. In 2001, Bak learned that he had myelodysplastic syndrome and died from it the following year.

He was bred for the bar, was a member of the Long Parliament and left notes on its transactions. D'Ewes took the Puritan side in the Civil War. His Journal of all the Parliaments of Elizabeth is of value; he left an Autobiography and Correspondence. Early life Simonds d'Ewes was born on 18 December 1602 in Milden, Suffolk, the eldest son of Paul d'Ewes and Cecelia, the heiress of Sir Richard Simonds. He inherited a fortune from his maternal grandfather while still young; his other grandfather was a printer, Gerard d'Ewes. After some early private teaching, including time at the school of Henry Reynolds (father of Bathsua Makin, who impressed d'Ewes much more), he was sent to the grammar school at Bury St Edmunds. At Bury St Edmunds, he wrote 2,850 verses of poetry in Greek and Latin.Simmons, Tracy Lee. Climbing Parnassus:pg. 122. ISI Books, 2002. D'Ewes then went to St John's College, Cambridge, and studied under Richard Holdsworth. At St John's, he was exposed to and influenced by a strong college tradition of Puritanism. He was admitted to the Middle Temple in 1611, and in 1623 was called to the Bar. He did not pursue a legal career, preferring instead to follow up antiquarian interests, which took him to the records in the Tower of London. He met Sir Robert Cotton, who introduced him to John Selden, the outstanding lawyer-scholar of the time; but D'Ewes found him conceited. In 1626 he married Anne Clopton, heiress to Sir William Clopton, of Luton's Hall (also known as Kentwell Hall) near Long Melford, Suffolk. The marriage brought him a considerable addition to his wealth. He was knighted by Charles I on 6 December. Political career In 1639, d'Ewes was High Sheriff of Suffolk, and 1640, he was elected as member for Sudbury, sitting in the Long Parliament.Halliwell 1845, Preface, p. 7. Although he opposed the King's arbitrary rule, his views were moderate; he was given a baronetcy by the king in 1641, possibly as an attempt to buy allegiance, in July. Since his beloved younger brother was an officer in the King's army, this is plausible. But it cannot be confirmed because the King's desperate need for money had led to a resumption of the sale of honors such as baronetcies at this time. On the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642, d'Ewes joined the Parliamentarians. He remained in Parliament until 1648, when he was expelled in Pride's Purge. After 1648, d'Ewes took no further part in politics, and devoted himself to literary studies. He died on 18 April 1650, having married again, to Elizabeth Willoughby, daughter of Sir Henry Willoughby, Bt. Antiquarian Simonds d'Ewes is perhaps best known for his work as an antiquarian, and particularly for his transcriptions of important historical documents, originals of which do not survive today, and the Journals of all the Parliaments during the Reign of Queen Elizabeth. Although d'Ewes was ambitious in this field, he lacked the ability to generalise or construct effectively, and died without publishing any major work, except The Primitive Practice for Preserving Truth (1645) and a few speeches. The Journals were published posthumously in 1682 by his nephew, the lawyer and antiquary Paul Bowes. Legacy Simonds d'Ewes, although known for the events in parliament during the 1640s, is best known for his contribution to the antiquarian world. His chief scholarly legacy is the collection of his transcriptions of primary documents that are now lost. He also kept a diary, which gives an insight into the events in Parliament, as well as glimpses of his own character.

In the mid-1980s, British Telecom decided to use the AXE10 digital switch to end its reliance on System X from Plessey and General Electric Company (GEC) (companies later combined as GPT). This kept Plessey/GEC from using a position of dominance to charge BT unfair costs of provisioning System X equipment parts. Although System X is more abundant in BT's network, AXE10 is still widespread in Britain. AXE10 covers two main types of digital telephony switching equipment: the remote subscriber switch (RSS) and the AXE10 local switch. RSS acts as a remote concentrator and deals with the conversion of analogue telephony signals used in the access network, which is the copper pairs between exchange buildings and customer premises, also called local loop, and the multiplexing of customer lines over cabling to the AXE10 local switching unit.

The editions are identical in content with the exception of occasional reviews of German-language books or German translations of IUPAC recommendations.  Business model  Angewandte Chemie is available online and in print. It is a hybrid open access journal and authors may choose to pay a fee to make articles available free of charge. Angewandte Chemie provides free access to supporting information.  Publication history  In 1887, Ferdinand Fischer founded the Zeitschrift f√ºr die Chemische Industrie (Journal for the Chemical Industry). In 1888, the title was changed to Zeitschrift f√ºr Angewandte Chemie (Journal of Applied Chemistry), and volume numbering started over. This title was kept until the end of 1941 when it was changed to Die Chemie. Until 1920, the journal was published by Springer Verlag and by Verlag Chemie starting in 1921. Due to World War II, the journal did not publish from April 1945 to December 1946. In 1947, publication was resumed under the current title, Angewandte Chemie. ; In 1962, the English-language edition was launched as Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English (, CODEN ACIEAY, abbreviated as Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl.), which has a separate volume counting. With the beginning of Vol. 37 (1998) \\"in English\\" was dropped from the journal name.

Impact factor  While it has been suggested that Angewandte's impact factor is as high as it is in comparison to other chemistry journals because the journal contains reviews, the editors claim this effect is too small to explain the difference or affect the ranking of the journal in its subject group. ;  References  Category:Chemistry journals Category:German-language journals Category:Multilingual journals Category:Publications established in 1887 Category:Wiley-Blackwell academic journals ","title":"Angewandte Chemie"},{"id":"2519873","text":"Cabrera may refer to: Places =Colombia = * Cabrera, Cundinamarca * Cabrera, Santander =Dominican Republic= * Cabrera, Mar√≠a Trinidad S√°nchez * Loma de Cabrera, Dajab√≥n =Mexico= * Tlalixtac de Cabrera, Oaxaca =Spain= * Cabrera, Balearic Islands, an uninhabited islet * Cabrera d'Anoia, Catalonia * Cabrera de Mar, Catalonia * Castrillo de Cabrera, Castile and Le√≥n * La Cabrera, Madrid Other uses * Cabrera (surname) * Cabrera (Santa Maria de Corc√≥) * Cabrera Nunatak * Cabrera River, a river of Colombia * Cabrera, a synonym of the grass genus Axonopus * House of Cabrera, Counts of Urgell between 1236 and 1314 * Jos√© Cabrera Nuclear Power Station, in Almonacid de Zorita, near Madrid, Spain See also * Cabrero (disambiguation) * Caprera (disambiguation) * Torre Cabrera (disambiguation) ","title":"Cabrera"},{"id":"2519878","text":"The town of Hyden is located east-southeast of Perth, Western Australia in the Shire of Kondinin. Hyden is home to Wave Rock, Mulka's Cave and Hippos Yawn, all popular local tourist attractions. The traditional owners of the area are the Indigenous Australian group the Njakinjaki peoples who have inhabited the region for thousands of years. The many granite outcrops, land formations, waterways as well as flora and fauna are still culturally significant to them. Sandalwood cutters were thought to be the earliest European visitors in the area. The land in the surrounding area was opened up for agriculture in the 1920s. A railway was built between Kondinin and Hyden Rock in 1930. The townsite was gazetted in 1932 following demand for land around the railway terminus. The first wheat crop was harvested in Hyden in 1927. The Hyden Progress Association was established prior to 1931 when the town was home to about 100 settlers. In 1931 the town had another large wheat crop which was transported from the railway terminus at Lake Grace. The town was being surveyed and already had an oil depot, tea rooms and an agency with a store being constructed. A large catchment of water had also been built at Hyden Rock. By 1933 the railway line from Lake Grace to Hyden was also completed. Also in 1933 the Progress Association built a pavilion at the existing sports ground and plans were made to construct a town hall. The hall was completed prior to 1935. The town's economy continues to rely on agriculture but mostly in the form of cattle and sheep production that has a current value of approximately $35 million. The town also benefits from mining and tourism. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town is a grain receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling. Around 100,000 tourists visit the town throughout the year while travelling to Wave Rock which is found to the east of the townsite. Other visitors arrive during the wildflower season between September and December to see the many wildflower species that bloom at the time and the birds that feed on the blossom.

Read to the Newcomen Society at the Science Museum, London, 12 October 2005. Humphrey Gainsborough was pastor to the Independent Church in Henley-on-Thames, England. He was the brother of the artist Thomas Gainsborough. He invented the drill plough (1766), winning a prize of ¬£60 from the Royal Society for his efforts. He also invented the tide mill (1761), which allowed a mill wheel to rotate in either direction, winning a ¬£50 prize from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts in London. In addition, he designed a self-ventilating fish wagon (1762). Conway's Bridge, designed by Humphrey Gainsborough and built in 1763 at Park Place, named after Henry Seymour Conway (1721‚Äì1795) Gainsborough designed Conway's Bridge, built in 1763 at Park Place close to Henley, an interesting rustic arched stone structure that still carries traffic on the road between Wargrave and Henley today. In 1768, he improved the slope on the road up the steep White Hill to the east of Henley, straightening it in the process. James Watt perhaps included some of ‚Äì and at least built on ‚Äì Gainsborough's ideas on his steam engine. Watt had been working independently on improvements to the Newcomen \\"atmospheric engine\\" and subsequently patented these in 1769. Gainsborough is thus probably less well-known than he might have been. The lock, weir and footbridge at Marsh Lock, just upstream from Henley on the River Thames, were designed by Gainsborough, together with other early locks from Sonning to Maidenhead (1772‚Äì73). A blue plaque in Gainsborough's honour can be found in the town of Henley itself on the gates of the Manse, the house where he lived next to the Christ Church United Reformed Church. Inside he designed an early security chain and plate on one of the outside doors, allowing the door to be partially opened, that is still there now. Similar designs are used on many people's front doors today.

Estate variants, the Renault Domaine and the Renault Manoir, were introduced in 1956 and 1958 respectively. Origins The Fr√©gate was conceived in the years immediately following World War II. Renault, which then had recently been brought under control of the French state, needed a new modern, upmarket model both to improve its image and to cater to the needs of middle class consumers in the hoped for economic recovery. Several prototypes were produced before the Fr√©gate design was put into production. Initially, the car was to have had a rear-engined layout as in the recently launched 4CV, but Renault abandoned the rear-engined \\"Project 108\\" and in 1949, although it was late in the design process, decided to go with an engine mounted ahead of the driver. The engineering was rushed because of the switch to a front-engined configuration. Launch The Fr√©gate was unveiled at the 1950 Paris Motor Show, but the first model was not delivered until November 1951. The assembly plant at Flins where the car was assembled, which was to be renamed after Pierre Lefaucheux after his death, was formally opened in October 1952. Production built up only slowly. Even in 1953 it was reported that the Fr√©gate, with approximately 25,000 units sold on the French market, was comfortably outpaced by the standard wheelbase versions of Citro√´n's '11 Normale' model, with approximately 35,000 sold that year, despite the Citro√´n being little changed since its unveiling fifteen years earlier and, since the war, available from the manufacturer's French factory only in black. Evolution Renault Fr√©gate (1953) Renault Domaine saloon Interior of a 1959 Fr√©gate From its appearance late in 1950 until 1953 the car was branded simply as the Fr√©gate, but the nomenclature became more complicated at the Paris Motor Show in October 1952, and from early 1953 the Fr√©gate was available in two trim levels, as the \\"Fr√©gate Affaires\\" and the \\"Fr√©gate Amiral\\", advertised at 799,300 francs and 899,000 francs respectively. The \\"Fr√©gate Amiral\\" was little changed from the previous year's Fr√©gate, although the interior was slightly reworked and it did feature twin fog lights at the front whereas the previous year's model came with just a single fog light. Further minor external modifications for the October 1953 Motor Show included updated door handles and a change to the badge on the car's nose. The motif on the little shield was still diamond-shaped, but within the diamond the image of a three-masted frigate (\\"fr√©gate\\") had been replaced by a tiny outline map of mainland France containing the inscription \\"RNUR-France\\".\\"RNUR-France\\" = \\"R√©gie Nationale des Usines Renault\\" The \\"Fr√©gate Affaires\\" offered a price saving of approximately 100,000 francs in return for a reduced specification that involved a simplified dashboard, reduced interior trim, the removal of exterior chrome over-riders from the bumpers as well as the loss of the twin fog lights and windscreen washer which remained a standard feature on the \\"Fr√©gate Amiral\\" The launch of a cut-price Fr√©gate was presumably part of the same strategy that was behind the launch of the cut-price 4CV Service. Neither of these stripped down versions were well received by customers: in the Fr√©gate's case, this was one of several attempts to make the model more competitive that failed to shake Citro√´n's dominance of the French market for large family cars. In 1956 Renault addressed the complaints about the lack of power from the 2-litre engine by introducing the bored out 2141 cc √âtendard engine, which produced . A new, luxurious Grand Pavois trim package was launched the same year. In 1957 a three-speed 'Transfluide' semi-automatic transmission, incorporating a fluid coupling, became an option along with a slightly more powerful version of the 2141 cc engine producing due to a compression ratio increase from 7.0:1 to 7,5:1. The 1958 models saw another modified front grille. The prominent wide chrome oval and horizontal bars were removed to leave only the row of thin bars over which, since 1955, they had been placed.  Domaine and Manoir  An estate variant, the Renault Domaine was launched in 1956 and was powered by the 2141 cc √âtendard engine. A luxury estate, the Renault Manoir was introduced in October 1958, featuring \\"Transfluide\\" automatic transmission included in the price. Commercial Citro√´n reinforced their domination of the market for larger saloon cars in 1955 with the introduction of the futuristic DS, followed in 1957 by its more aggressively priced ID variant. Sales of the Fr√©gate peaked in 1955 with 37,717 cars sold before slumping to 24,608 in 1956 and collapsing to 9,772 in 1957:The data cover the \\"berline\\" (saloon) versions of the car but do not include the estate versions, nor the very small number of cabriolet conversions from coach builders Letourneur et Marchand. volumes failed to recover as competition from Simca and Citro√´n intensified in the large car sector through the later 1950s. On 18 April 1960 the final Fr√©gate emerged from the plant, after just 1,158 cars had been built during that year to date. In total, 163,383 Fr√©gates were made in the Flins-sur-Seine factory. The sales performance of the car was regarded as disappointing. Some were content to blame the excessive number of teething troubles in the early models, the car's lack of power and, especially during the second half of the decade, the superior attractions of the Citro√´n offerings: but some commentators also draw attention to a very French political dimension. The manufacturer was nationalised directly after the war and the death in 1944 of Louis Renault took place under circumstances which were and have remained controversial. Many members of the (still relatively small) haute-bourgeoisie class able to afford such a car were simply more comfortable buying from a private manufacturer, especially after the Peugeot 403 was added to the Fr√©gate's competitors. At the end of the decade Charles de Gaulle returned to power as president in 1958, and he was an unapologetically partisan fan of the Citro√´n DS, as newsreels of the period attest. Only a single long wheel base \\"presidential special\\" Renault Fr√©gate exists. Epilogue Under an agreement concluded with American Motors Corporation (AMC) on 22 November 1961, Renault began selling the Rambler Classic Six (starting with model year 1962) as the Rambler Renault to replace the Fr√©gate. Starting on 11 April 1962, the Rambler Classics were assembled from CKD (Completely Knocked Down) kits at Renault's factory in Haren, Belgium,As part of a programme of municipal boundary changes in 1921 Haren was officially abolished, and although older generations still used the name Haren when the Renault plant was set up in the early 1930s, by 1997 when this plant stopped producing cars, few people used the name Haren and the plant was generally referred to as Renault's Vilvoorde factory. and these executive cars were marketed by Renault in Algeria, Austria, Benelux and France.

Formally invested in 1848, his rule benefited a kingdom that suffered from several centuries of royal dissent and decline. His politics focused on sustained national unity and identity and the minimization of foreign interference. He issued the first substantial revision of the legal codex in centuries and he encouraged and supervised religious and cultural reforms. Confronted with increasing Siamese and Vietnamese encroachment he attempted to establish an alliance with colonial France on a sovereign basis. Although this alliance ultimately culminated in the ninety-year period of the French Protectorate of Cambodia, King Ang Duong's actions were the foundation for the modern united state of Cambodia. Ang Duong ascended the throne with the title: Preah Karuna Preah Bat Samdach Preah Harireak Reamea Issarathipadei Ang Duong (). He was the progenitor of the two main royal houses of Cambodia- the Houses of Norodom and Sisowath. Family Ang Duong was the son of King Ang Eng, who ruled Cambodia from 1779 to 1797 and resided at the then capital Oudong. His mother was Ros, a royal consort since 1793 and later Queen Vara. who was of Thai origin (died around 1869). Ang Duong was the father of his successor King Norodom (1834‚Äì1904), King Sisowath (1840‚Äì1927) and was the great-great-grandfather of King Norodom Sihanouk (1941-2004). Dedicated to extend the royal family line Ang Duong had numerous wives and produced 18 legitimate children - 11 sons and 7 daughters. History King Ang Duong is acclaimed as a promoter of national unity after centuries of regress and venerated among modern Cambodians for his efforts to revitalize the nation and protect the kingdom from foreign invasion. However, limited power, poverty and internal dissension prevented lasting success. He spent 27 years in Bangkok from the age of 16 until aged 43. During his residence in Thailand Ang Duong composed poetry, authored and published classical Cambodian literature and historical works and later promoted the enactment of a comprehensive reformed legal codex and participated in the artistic development of Khmer classical dance. He translated the Cambodian folktale Vorvong & Sorvong into the Thai language as a birthday present for Thai Crown prince Mongkut. He was appointed governor of the then Thai Mongkol Borey District in 1834. In 1843 Ang Duong was crowned King of Cambodia in Bangkok and returned to Oudong. =Political background= Stupa of Ang Duong. Siam (modern day Thailand) which since the late eighteenth century royal investiture of General Chakri was governed by a well established dynasty and Vietnam united since 1802 under Emperor Gia Long increasingly fought over control of the fertile Mekong basin, the Cambodian heartland. Siam had after the 1594 conquest of Cambodia's capital Longvek and the permanent annexation of Cambodia's Battambang and Siem Reap provinces introduced a tradition of taking Cambodian royalty hostage and relocate them at the court of Ayutthaya. Thus, Siam effectively controlled Cambodian national policies and royal succession. After initially conquering all of Cambodia during the Siamese‚ÄìVietnamese War of 1831 to 1834, Siam, attempting to conquer Southern Vietnam was defeated by Vietnamese troops and pushed back. Vietnam subsequently gained military control of Cambodia and restored King Ang Chan, who had been dethroned by Siam. Only a decade later Khmer discontent with increasing Vietnamese dominance among demands to adopt Vietnamese customs encouraged Siam to intervene and invade again during the Siamese‚ÄìVietnamese War of 1841 to 1845. Again Vietnam proved to be superior on the battlefield, however Siam was able to negotiate an agreeable peace treaty, by which Cambodia was placed under joint Siamese-Vietnamese suzerainty, a final act of complete disregard for Khmer national and royal authority. Author Justin Corfield wrote in \\"French Indochina\\": \\"[1807] the Vietnamese expanded their lands by establishing a protectorate over Cambodia. However king [‚Ä¶] Ang Duong was keen on Cambodia becoming independent of [...] Thailand [...] and Vietnam [...] and sought help from the British in Singapore. When that failed, he enlisted the help of the French.\\" British agent John Crawfurd states: \\"...the King of that ancient Kingdom is ready to throw himself under the protection of any European nation...\\" King Ang Duong's policies paved the way for France to establish a Protectorate in 1863 which lasted for 90 years. In order to preserve the kingdom's national identity and integrity, King Ang Duong initiated secret negotiations in a letter to Napoleon III proposing some form of cooperation with France. King Ang Duong died in 1860, three years before negotiations had concluded. King Norodom Prohmbarirak signed and officially recognized the French protectorate on 11 August 1863, that was effectively incorporated into the Indochinese Union in 1867. There has been considerable debate over the wisdom of Duong's policies. Nonetheless, the idea that he actively sought to subject his kingdom to colonial serfdom has been contested. Contrary to the assertions of some 19th century French authors, Duong did not seek the imposition of a French protectorate over his country, he rather pondered the feasibility of some ill-defined, unequal relationship with France. He certainly was aware, that the French main objective for a protectorate was the containment of the British and the creation of a secure flank for Cochinchina. The historic reality of 19th century Asia reminded any local ruler to seek alignment of some form or the other with at least one of the then technological more advanced Western powers. Ang Duong's death in October 1860 and accumulating foreign pressure convinced his son King Norodom Prohmbarirak to agree to the initially rather moderate French terms. Cambodia was capable to preserve its identity, culture and traditions during the French colonial period, which might otherwise have diffused into the modern Vietnamese and Siamese nations, that could have absorbed all Cambodian territory as their modern border most likely would be the Mekong river.

It is published by Future.  History  Founded in 1959 as Record Retailer, it relaunched on 18 March 1972 as Music Week. On 17 January 1981, the title again changed, owing to the increasing importance of sell-through videos, to Music & Video Week. The rival Record Business, founded in 1978 by Brian Mulligan and Norman Garrod, was absorbed into Music Week in February 1983. Later that year, the offshoot Video Week launched and the title of the parent publication reverted to Music Week. Since April 1991, Music Week has incorporated Record Mirror, initially as a 4 or 8-page chart supplement, later as a dance supplement of articles, reviews and charts. In the 1990s, several magazines and newsletters become part of the Music Week family: Music Business International (MBI), Promo, MIRO Future Hits, Tours Report, Fono, Green Sheet, Charts+Plus (published from May 1991 to November 1994), and Hit Music (September 1992 to May 2001). By May 2001, all newsletters (except Promo) closed. In 2003, Music Week relaunched its website of daily news, features, record release listings and UK sales, airplay and club charts. In early 2006, a separate free-to- access site for the Music Week Directory listed 10,000 contacts in the UK music industry. In mid-2007, the magazine was redesigned by London company This Is Real Art. In October 2008, another redesign led to major changes. In June 2011, Music Week was sold to Intent Media. The package was sold for ¬£2.4m and also contained titles Television Broadcast Europe, Pro Sound News, Installation Europe, and additional websites, newsletters, conferences, show dailies and awards events, which generated ¬£5.4m of revenue in 2010. As of issue 30 July 2011, UBM is still named as publisher, as the new publisher Intent Media took over on 1 August 2011. In the first edition under new ownership it was announced that the title would switch its day of publication Monday to Thursday with immediate effect. NewBay Media acquired Intent Media in 2012. Future acquired NewBay Media in 2018.  Charts  Music Week features these British charts: Top 75 Singles, Top 75 Artist Albums, Top 20 Downloads, Top 20 Ringtones, Top 20 Compilation Albums, Top 50 Radio Airplay, Top 40 TV airplay, and a number of format and genre charts (Music DVD, Rock, Indie, etc.). It also includes background on sales and airplay analysis from Alan Jones. Following a redesign in October 2008, the magazine introduced live charts based on Tixdaq data, a Box Office chart and predictive charts based on information from Amazon, Rakuten.co.uk, Shazam, HMV.com and Last.fm. Music Week compiles and publishes weekly club charts from chart returns supplied by DJs in nightclubs Upfront Club Top 40, Commercial Pop Top 30 and Urban Top 30.

It is the strongest member of a family of principles, including hard determinism, each of which deny libertarian free will, reasoning that human actions are predetermined by external or internal antecedents. Necessitarianism is stronger than hard determinism, because even the hard determinist would grant that the causal chain constituting the world might have been different as a whole, even though each member of that series could not have been different, given its antecedent causes. The most famous defender of necessitarianism in the history of philosophy is Spinoza. Anthony Collins was also knownn for his defense of necessitarianism. His brief Inquiry Concerning Human Liberty (1715) was a key statement of the necessitarianist standpoint.

Warfield - and has been developing it ever since. OPMS springs naturally from Interactive Management (IM), the powerful system methodologies that derive from Professor John N. Warfield‚Äôs ‚Äústructural approach to system design‚Äù. The application of the method also has been carried forward and codified by other entrepreneurial practitioners in worldwide applications, and an illustration of the scope of penetration of the method has recently been summarized Harness Collective Wisdom by Alexander Christakis, a long-standing collaborator of Dr. John N. Warfield. Interactive Management consists of tools to: * Help users 'generate ideas' ‚Äì through systematically developed methods of brainstorming; * ‚ÄòStructure‚Äô (or organize) ideas generated as needed for effective resolution of problems identified. OPMS now enables all of the above to be done by 'people-at-large' as well as by experts to create and implement truly usable systems of all kinds - individual, organisational or societal. In brief, OPMS enables individual and group users to: 1\\\\. Choose an appropriate 'Mission' depending on problem-situation confronted; 2\\\\. Identify the issue or problem confronted ‚Äì this naturally provides a simple 'Mission statement'; 3\\\\. *Integrate* all the good ideas available to tackle the problem or issue at hand ‚Äì with a view to enable accomplishment of the chosen Mission. (Integrating 'good ideas' includes getting rid of the bad ideas that are always cluttering up the 'mindspace' ‚Äì think about it and this will be obvious to you). That's it! And that's what the OPMS all about! Just 'integrating' your available good ideas (AND getting rid of your bad ideas)!! [Of course, it often is quite a job to decide which are the 'good' ideas and which are the 'bad' ideas ‚Äì but OPMS helps users arrive at sound decisions, via effective debate between stakeholders to the chosen issue/Mission]. The structuring tools of OPMS have developed from the powerful 'systems modeling' tools invented by Warfield in a three-decade long study of ‚Äúcomplexity in systems and how to enable people to cope with it‚Äù - made easy to use for the 'people- at-large'. These tools are: * Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM); and * Field Representation & Profiling Method (FRP). (Now rendered understandable by any high-school student within a couple of hours, and practically applicable by him/her/them to issues of practical concern within a couple of weeks [at most]). More information about the OPMS can be sent if desired as attachments to an email message if you'll send an inquiry to gs_chandy_AT_yahoo.com - this information will include: \\\\-- brief description of the OPMS; \\\\-- 'provenance'; \\\\-- 'Missions' to which OPMS has been successfully employed (and also some Missions where OPMS has not been successful yet; \\\\-- a sizable listing of possible Missions); \\\\-- an illustration of the kind of a systems model (and Interpretive Structural Model [ISM]), which can readily be developed into Action Planning along with all needed subsystems to help accomplish any chosen Mission. (Limited) guidance can also be provided to help interested users initiate Action Planning on any chosen Mission - and copies of the prototype OPMS software would be freely provided - no fees or charges of any kind whatsoever.

He studied for the bar and became advocate in 1811. Having been elected Member of Parliament for the Ayr Burghs in 1818, he devoted the greater part of his life to the promotion of liberal reforms. In 1820 he married the only daughter of Sir Samuel Romilly. He was greatly assisted by Lord Cockburn, then Mr. Henry Cockburn, and a volume of correspondence published by Kennedy in 1874 forms a curious and interesting record of the consultations of the two friends on measures which they regarded as requisite for the political regeneration of their native country. One of the first measures to which he directed his attention was the withdrawal of the power of nominating juries from the judges, and the imparting of a right of peremptory challenge to prisoners. Among other subjects were the improvement of the parish schools, of pauper administration, and of several of the corrupt forms of legal procedure which then prevailed. Kennedy took a prominent part in the construction of the Scottish Reform Act 1832; indeed he and Lord Cockburn may almost be regarded as its authors. After the accession of the Whigs to office in 1832 he held office in the ministry as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1832 and as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1832 to 1834, and most of the measures of reform for Scotland, such as burgh reform, the improvements in the law of entail, and the reform of the sheriff courts, owed much to his sagacity and energy. In 1837 he went to Ireland as pay master of civil services, and set himself to the promotion of various measures of reform. Kennedy retired from office in 1854, but continued to take keen interest in political affairs and up to his death in 1879 took a great part in both county and parish business. He had a stern love of justice, and a determined hatred of everything savouring of corruption or dishonesty.

The type species, Antarctosaurus wichmannianus, and a second species, Antarctosaurus giganteus, were described by prolific German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene in 1929. Three additional species of Antarctosaurus have been named since then but later studies have considered them dubious or unlikely to pertain to the genus. The type species, A. wichmannianus, is controversial because there is uncertainty as to whether all the described remains belong to the same individual or even genus. The second species, A. giganteus, is considered dubious, but the fragmentary remains represent one of the largest dinosaurs known.  Discovery and species  leftRemains of this dinosaur were first mentioned in print in 1916, although they were not fully described and named until a 1929 monograph written by paleontologist Friedrich von Huene.von Huene, F. 1929. Los saurisquios y ornitisquios del Cretac√©o Argentino. Anales del Museo de La Plata (series 3) 3: 1‚Äì196. [In Spanish] Antarctosaurus does not refer to the continent of Antarctica since it was first found in Argentina, although it does have the same derivation, from the Greek words Œ±ŒΩœÑŒπ-, anti- meaning 'opposite of', Œ±œÅŒ∫œÑœåœÇ, arktos meaning 'north' and œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ, sauros meaning 'lizard'. The generic name refers to the animal's reptilian nature and its geographical location on a southern continent. Antarctosaurus wichmannianus is the type species of the genus, named in 1929 after the discoverer of its remains in 1912, geologist Ricardo Wichmann. Von Huene used the name A. wichmannianus to describe a large assemblage of bones, which are considered to come from the Anacleto Formation in R√≠o Negro Province of Argentina, which is probably early Campanian in age. Two additional limb bones, found in the Chubut Province in 1924, were also referred to A. wichmannianus by von Huene in 1929. Later studies, however, have doubted their referral to the species. Von Huene also named a fragmentary second species of Antarctosaurus in the same 1929 monograph, which he tentatively called cf. Antarctosaurus giganteus because of its enormous size. These fossils were recovered in Neuqu√©n Province of Argentina, from the Plottier Formation, which dates to the Coniacian-Santonian stages of the Late Cretaceous Period. The Plottier, like the younger Anacleto, is a member of the Neuqu√©n Group. Very few remains are known of this species and it is regarded as a nomen dubium by some.Upchurch, P., Barrett, P.M, & Dodson, P. 2004. Sauropoda. In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., & Osmolska, H. (Eds.). The Dinosauria (2nd Edition). Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 259-322. Other researchers regard A. giganteus as a likely valid species but probably belonging to a new genus. In 1969, Leigh Van Valen considered A. wichmannianus and A. giganteus to be growth stages of the same species and favored the name A. giganteus. This idea is problematic because A. wichmannianus was named earlier in the same paper and it is known from more material, it should, therefore, get priority over A. giganteus. The two species are also not from the same geological formation which suggests they did not belong to the same time period. In 1933, Von Huene and Charles Matley described another species, Antarctosaurus septentrionalis, meaning \\"northern\\". The remains were found in the Lameta Formation of Madhya Pradesh State in India. This species does preserve important anatomical information but has been assigned to its own genus in 1994; Jainosaurus.Hunt, A.P., Lockley M., Lucas S. & Meyer C., 1995, \\"The global sauropod fossil record\\", In: M.G. Lockley, V.F. dos Santos, C.A. Meyer, and A.P. Hunt, (eds.) Aspects of sauropod paleobiology, GAIA 10: 261-279 Antarctosaurus jaxarticus from Kazakhstan is known from a single femur. It was named by Soviet paleontologist Anatoly Riabinin in 1938, and was the first sauropod species from Kazakhstan. It was reported from a certain locality in the Kyzylkum Desert, but the exact location is unknown. It may have come from the Syuksyuk Formation (originally described as Dabrazinskaya Svita) which dates to the Santonian stage of the Late Cretaceous. Other researchers have considered it as either, Titanosauridae incertae sedis, as a nomen dubium, or as a nomen nudem. In 1970, two fragmentary limb bones and a partial vertebra were found in the Adamantina Formation (originally described as Bauru Formation; has also been reported as the S√£o Jos√© do Rio Preto Formation) of the northern Paran√° Basin in Brazil. The remains were described by their discoverers Fahad Moys√©s Arid and Luiz Dino Vizotto in 1971 as A. brasiliensis.Arid, F.M. & Vizotto, L.D. 1971. Antarctosaurus brasiliensis, um novo saur√≥pode do Cr√©taceo superior do sul do Brasil. An. Cong. Bras. Geol. 1971: 297-305. [In Portuguese] Other researchers have considered this species as either, a nomen dubium, or an indeterminate titanosaur.  Description  Antarctosaurus is a problematic genus because none of the species described are known from complete remains and the type species consists of elements that are of questionable association which has caused a confused taxonomy. Of the four additional species that have been assigned to Antarctosaurus over the years, three have been considered dubious and \\"Antarctosaurus\\" septentrionalis, was given its own genus, Jainosaurus. The remains that have been described belong to sauropods, most probably titanosaurs, a group of large-bodied, quadrupedal herbivores, usually possessing a long neck and tail, with a small head. =Antarctosaurus wichmannianus= The assemblage of fossil remains that became known as A. wichmannianus were given the specimen number MACN 6904. The known material includes several skull fragments, including a braincase and an incomplete mandible (lower jaw), a cervical (neck) vertebra, a caudal (tail) vertebra, rib fragments, and numerous limb bones including a femur which measures tall. None of the individual fossils were designated the holotype specimen so MACN 6904 is considered to be an assemblage of syntypes. The total length of A. wichmannianus has been estimated at around . A hypothetical size chart of A.wichmannianus. It's not certain that all the described remains are associated with one individual. An additional femur and tibia were also referred by von Huene to A. wichmannianus; the femur, FMNH P13019, is over tall. In one study the dimensions of this femur were used in a regression analysis to estimate the mass of A. wichmannianus at about . The referral of the additional femur and tibia has been questioned by later researchers. In 2003 Jaime Eduardo Powell tentatively referred them to cf. Argyrosaurus and in 2012 Philip Mannion and Alejandro Otero considered it an indeterminate titanosaur. The incomplete mandible attributed to A. wichmannianus is squared off at the front with each dentary bone being L shaped. The teeth were restricted to the front of the lower jaw and were small and slender. The squared off jaws suggest specialised feeding habits, such as feeding near a surface plane like low vegetation on the ground or floating plants in water. alt=These bones were, for the most part, not associated with each other but scattered throughout the formation. Consequently, many scientists believe that they may not all belong to the same type of animal. In particular, the very square lower jaw has frequently been suggested to belong to a rebbachisaurid sauropod similar to Nigersaurus. However, the jaw of Bonitasaura, described in 2004, is similar in overall shape and is clearly associated with titanosaur skeletal remains, indicating that the lower jaw may belong to A. wichmannianus after all. In 2013 and 2019 respectively, Brasilotitan and Baalsaurus were described which also possessed squared off jaws. It was noted that Brazilotitan, Bonitasaura, Antarctosaurus, and other titanosaurs show up three teeth per alveolus (tooth socket) whereas the rebbachisaurid Nigersaurus shows up to seven teeth. Brazilotitan and Baalsaurus were described as a titanosaurs, closely related to A. wichmannianus. The back of the skull and the remainder of the skeleton are usually regarded as titanosaurian by researchers, although they do not necessarily belong to the same type of titanosaur. In 2005, Jeffrey Wilson considered the braincase as being referable to Nemegtosauridae but noted that other skull remains require further study. A study, published in 2012 by Ariana Paulina Carabajal, CT scanned the A. wichmannianus braincase which revealed the complete brain endocast and the inner ear structures. The brain endocast and inner ear share several features with other titanosaurids such as short olfactory tracts and olfactory bulbs that are horizontally projected. Powell compared the width of the cranium to the length of the limb bones of both A. wichmannianus and Saltasaurus; this led him to conclude that the skull was proportionally small in A. wichmannianus, this might imply that the skull and limb elements could belong to different individuals or a different taxa. He noted, however, that the comparison was potentially misleading because the overall anatomy of Saltasaurus is shorter and stouter which might facilitate a bigger skull. Von Huene assigned two tarsal (ankle) bones to A. wichmannianus, which he described as an astragalus and a calcanium. Powell suggested it's possible that the calcanium described by von Huene is actually the astragalus of a smaller individual. He also noted that the astragalus seems too small to belong to the same individual as the tibia, being only about half the width. Von Huene described a caudal vertebra which was found close to the skull material. This vertebra was the first caudal, belonging to the base of the tail just after the sacrum (vertebrae attached to the hip). The vertebra features a biconvex centrum, a feature shared with other titanosaurs. Von Huene noted that the first caudal could possibly belong to Laplatasaurus. With the exception of an incomplete cervical vertebra and the questionable first caudal, there are no vertebrae that link the skull to the limb material. There is a lack of field documentation to aid in the referral of all the material to one individual. Powell thought it was probable that von Huene correctly assigned the material to A. wichmannianus, arguing that von Huene would have been able to communicate with the discoverers and would have had access to photographs of the discovery site. = \\"Antarctosaurus\\" giganteus = Antarctosaurus giganteus femora in 222x222pxThe type specimen of A. giganteus, MLP 26-316, includes a left and right femur, a partial left and right pubis, the distal end of a damaged tibia, numerous rib and distal caudal vertebrae fragments, and six large and unidentifiable bones. The two gigantic femora measure in length, which are among the largest of any known sauropod. Even though the femurs are large, they are also somewhat gracile in construction. alt=A reconstruction of A. giganteus, published in 1956 by Carlos Rusconi, was given a length around . In 1969, van Valen considered it as similar in size to Giraffatitan brancai (then called Brachiosaurus brancai). Based on an earlier mass estimate of G. brancai by Edwin Harris Colbert in 1962, van Valen gave A. giganteus an estimated mass of about . In 1994, Gregory S. Paul estimated the weight of both A. giganteus and Argentinosaurus at between and lengths of long.G.S. Paul, 1994, \\"Big sauropods ‚Äì really, really big sauropods\\", The Dinosaur Report, The Dinosaur Society, Fall, p. 12‚Äì13 Extrapolating from the femur's parameters, a 2004 study by Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues estimated the mass of A. giganteus at approximately ; slightly smaller than Argentinosaurus which in the same study was estimated at nearly . This would make A. giganteus among the heaviest known land animals. In 2006, Kenneth Carpenter used the short-necked Saltasaurus as a guide and estimated a shorter length of long.Carpenter, K. (2006). \\"Biggest of the big: a critical re- evaluation of the mega-sauropod Amphicoelias fragillimus.\\" In Foster, J.R. and Lucas, S.G., eds., 2006, Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 36: 131‚Äì138. In 2012 Thomas holtz gave a length of 33 meters and an estimated weight of 58-65 metric tons (64-72 short tons). In 2016, using equations that estimate body mass based on the circumference of the humerus and femur of quadrupedal animals, it was estimated to be in weight. In 2019, Gregory S. Paul estimated the mass of A. giganteus in the range, based on newer titanosaur reconstructions. In 2020 Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi estimated its length at and its weight similar to Paul's estimation at . Due to the incompleteness of the remains, any size estimates are subject to a large amount of error. = \\"Antarctosaurus\\" jaxarticus and \\"Antarctosaurus\\" brasiliensis = \\"Antarctosaurus\\" jaxarticus and \\"Antarctosaurus\\" brasiliensis are both known from very fragmentary remains. \\"Antarctosaurus\\" jaxarticus is known from a single femur which was briefly reported as resembling a femur attributed to Jainosaurus (then called \\"Antarctosaurus\\" septentrionalis). Paleontologist Teresa Marya≈Ñska noted that, whilst A. jaxarticus was named, it was not properly described or diagnosed. The femur possibly belongs to the titanosaur clade Lithostrotia. The type specimen of \\"Antarctosaurus\\" brasiliensis is only known from three fragmentary bones that are titanosaurian in nature; a partial left femur GP-RD-2, a partial right humerus GP-RD-3, and an incomplete dorsal vertebra (backbone) GP-RD-4. The femur is preserved and was estimated at if it were completed. The humerus is preserved and estimated at completed. The dorsal vertebra centrum is long. Classification Antarctosaurus has been included in few phylogenetic analyses, only being added to the matrix of Philip Mannion et al. in 2019. It was coded along with Vahiny, Jainosaurus, Normanniasaurus and additional non-titanosaurs. Antarctosaurus placed as sister taxon to a clade of Vahiny and Jainosaurus, consistently close to taxa of the clade Lognkosauria.

Scruby and L.E. Drain, Laser Ultrasonics, (Adam Hilger: Bristol), 1990. It is a non-contact technique used to measure materials thickness, detect flaws and carry out materials characterization. The basic components of a laser- ultrasonic system are a generation laser, a detection laser and a detector. Ultrasound generation by laser The generation lasers are short pulse (from tens of nanoseconds to femtoseconds) and high peak power lasers. Common lasers used for ultrasound generation are solid state Q-Switched Nd:YAG and gas lasers (CO2 or Excimers). The physical principle is of thermal expansion (also called thermoelastic regime) or ablation. In the thermoelastic regime, the ultrasound is generated by the sudden thermal expansion due to the heating of a tiny surface of the material by the laser pulse. If the laser power is sufficient to heat the surface above the material boiling point, some material is evaporated (typically some nanometres) and ultrasound is generated by the recoil effect of the expanding material evaporated. In the ablation regime, a plasma is often formed above the material surface and its expansion can make a substantial contribution to the ultrasonic generation. consequently the emissivity patterns and modal content are different for the two different mechanisms. The frequency content of the generated ultrasound is partially determined by the frequency content of the laser pulses with shorter pulses giving higher frequencies. For very high frequency generation (up to 100sGHz) femtosecond lasers are used often in a pump-probe configuration with the detection system (see picosecond ultrasonics). Historically, fundamental research into the nature of laser-ultrasonics was started in 1979, by Richard J Dewhurst and Stuart B Palmer. They set up a new laboratory in the Department of Applied Physics, University of Hull. Dewhurst provided the laser-matter expertise and Palmer the ultrasound expertise. Investigations were directed towards the development of a scientific insight into physical processes converting laser-matter interaction into ultrasound. The studies were also aimed at assessing the characteristics of the ultrasound propagating from the near field into the far field. Importantly, quantitative measurements were performed between 1979 and 1982.C.B. Scruby, R.J. Dewhurst, D.A. Hutchins and S.B. Palmer, \\"Quantitative studies of thermally-generated elastic waves in laser-irradiated metals\\", J. Appl. Phys., 51, 6210-6216, 1980.D.A. Hutchins, R.J. Dewhurst and S.B.

Scruby, \\"Quantitative measurements of laser- generated acoustic waveforms\\", J. Appl. Phys., 53, 4064-4071, 1982. In solids, the measurements included amplitudes of longitudinal and shear waves in absolute terms. Ultrasound generation by a laser pulse for both the thermoelastic regime and the transition to the plasma regime was examined. By comparing measurements with theoretical predictions, a description of the magnitude and direction of stresses leading to ultrasonic generation was presented for the first time. It led to the proposition that laser-generated ultrasound could be regarded as a standard acoustic source.A.M. Aindow, R.J. Dewhurst, D.A. Hutchins and S.B.

Their research also included the first quantitative studies of laser induced Rayleigh waves, which can dominate ultrasonic surface waves. In studies beyond 1982, surface waves were shown to have a potential use in non-destructive testing. One type of investigation included surface‚Äìbreaking crack depth estimations in metals, using artificial cracks. Crack sizing was demonstrated, using wideband laser-ultrasonics. Findings were first reported at a Royal Society meeting in LondonJ.A. Cooper, R.J. Dewhurst and S.B.

Ultrasound detection by laser For scientific investigations in the early 1980s, Michelson interferometers were exploited. They were capable of measuring ultrasonic signals quantitatively, in typical ranges of 20nm down to 5pm. They possessed a broadband frequency response, up to about 50MHz. Unfortunately, for good signals, they required samples that had polished surfaces. They suffered from serious sensitivity loss when used on rough industrial surfaces. A significant breakthrough for the application of laser ultrasonics came in 1986, when the first optical interferometer capable of reasonable detection sensitivity on rough industrial surfaces was demonstrated. Monchalin et al.J.-P Monchalin, \\"Optical detection of ultrasound\\", IEEE Trans. Sonics, Ultrasonics, Freq. Control, UFFC-33, 485-499, 1986.J.-P. Monchalin and R. He'on, 'Laser Generation and Optical Detection with a Confocal Fabry-Perot Interferometer,' Materials Evaluation, Vol. 44, 1986, p. 1232 at the National Research Council of Canada in Boucherville showed that a Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot interferometer system could assess optical speckle returning from rough surfaces. It provided the impetus for the translation of laser ultrasonics into industrial applications. Today, ultrasound waves may be detected optically by a variety of techniques. Most techniques use continuous or long pulse (typically of tens of microseconds) lasers but some use short pulses to down convert very high frequencies to DC in a classic pump-probe configuration with the generation. Some techniques (notably conventional Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot detectors) require high frequency stability and this usually implies long coherence length. Common detection techniques include: interferometry (homodyne or heterodyneJ.W. Wagner and J.B. Spicer, 'Theoretical Noise-Limited Sensitivity of Classical Interferometry,' Journal of the Optical Society of America B, Vol. 4, no. 8, p. 1316, 1987. or Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot)J.-P. Monchalin and R.

Noui and R.J. Dewhurst, \\"A beam deflection technique for photoacoustic Lamb wave measurements\\", Photoacoustic and Photothermal Phenomena II, Ed. J.C. Murphy et. al., Springer Series in Optical Sciences, Springer-Verlag, 62, 278-281, 1990. With GCLAD,J.N. Caron, Y. Yang, J.B. Mehl, and K.V. Steiner, \`\`Gas coupled laser acoustic detection for ultrasound inspection of composite materials\\", Materials Evaluation, Vol. 58, No. 5, 2001, p. 667. (Gas-coupled laser acoustic detection), a laser beam is passed through a region where one wants to measure or record the acoustic changes. The ultrasound waves create changes in the air's index of refraction. When the laser encounters these changes, the beam slightly deflects and displaces to a new course. This change is detected and converted to an electric signal by a custom-built photodetector. This enables high sensitivity detection of ultrasound on rough surfaces for frequencies up to 10 MHz. In practice the choice of technique is often determined by the physical optics and the sample (surface) condition. Many techniques fail to work well on rough surfaces (e.g. simple interferometers) and there are many different schemes to overcome this problem. For instance, photorefractive crystals and four wave mixing are used in an interferometer to compensate for the effects of surface roughness. These techniques are usually expensive in terms of monetary cost and in terms of light budget (thus requiring more laser power to achieve the same signal to noise under ideal conditions). At low to moderate frequencies (say < 1 GHz), the mechanism for detection is the movement of the surface of the sample. At high frequencies (say >1 GHz), other mechanisms may come into play (for instance modulation of the sample refractive index with stress). Under ideal circumstances most detection techniques can be considered theoretically as interferometers and, as such, their ultimate sensitivities are all roughly equal. This is because, in all these techniques, interferometry is used to linearize the detection transfer function and when linearized, maximum sensitivity is achieved. Under these conditions, photon shot noise dominates the sensitivity and this is fundamental to all the optical detection techniques. However, the ultimate limit is determined by the phonon shot noise. Since the phonon frequency is many orders of magnitude lower than the photon frequency, the ultimate sensitivity of ultrasonic detection can be much higher. The usual method for increasing the sensitivity of optical detection is to use more optical power. However, the shot noise limited SNR is proportional to the square root of the total detection power. Thus, increasing optical power has limited effect, and damaging power levels are easily reached before achieving an adequate SNR. Consequently, optical detection frequent has lower SNR than non-optical contacting techniques. Optical generation (at least in the firmly thermodynamic regime) is proportional to the optical power used and it is generally more efficient to improve the generation rather than the detection (again the limit is the damage threshold). Techniques like CHOTs (cheap optical transducers) can overcome the limit of optical detection sensitivity by passively amplifying the amplitude of vibration before optical detection and can result in an increase in sensitivity by several orders of magnitude. Ultrasonic laser technique operation Ultrasonic laser set-up The \\"Laser Ultrasonic\\" technique is part of those measurement techniques known as \\"non-destructive techniques or NDT\\", that is, methods which do not change the state of measurand itself. Laser ultrasonics is a contactless ultrasonic inspection technique based on excitation and ultrasound measurement using two lasers. A laser pulse is directed onto the sample under test and the interaction with the surface generates an ultrasonic pulse that propagates through the material. The reading of the vibrations produced by the ultrasounds can be subsequently measured by the self-mixing vibrometer : the high performance of the instrument makes it suitable for an accurate measurement of the ultrasonic wave and therefore for a modeling of the characteristics of the sample. When the laser beam hits the surface of the material, its behavior may vary according to the power of the laser used. In the case of high power, there is a real \\"ablation\\" or \\"vaporization\\" of the material at the point of incidence between the laser and the surface: this causes the disappearance of a small portion of material and a small recall force, due to compression longitudinal, which would be the origin of the ultrasonic wave. This longitudinal wave tends to propagate in the normal direction to the surface of the material, regardless of the angle of incidence of the laser: this would allow to accurately estimate the thickness of the material, knowing the speed of propagation of the wave, without worrying about the angle of incidence. The use of a high power laser, with consequent vaporization of the material, is the optimal way to obtain an ultrasonic response from the object. However, to fall within the scope of non-destructive measurements, it is preferred to avoid this phenomenon by using low power lasers. In this case, the generation of ultrasound takes place thanks to the local overheating of the point of incidence of the laser: the cause of wave generation is now the thermal expansion of the material. In this way there is both the generation of waves longitudinal, similarly to the previous case, and the generation of transverse waves, whose angle with the normal direction to the surface depends on the material. After a few moments the thermal energy dissipates, leaving the surface intact: in this way the measurement is repeatable an infinite number of times (assuming the use of a material sufficiently resistant to thermal stresses) and non-destructive, as required in almost all areas of application of this technology. The movement of the object causes a shift in the phase of the signal, which cannot be identified directly by an optical receiver: to do this it is first necessary to transform the phase modulation into an amplitude modulation (in this case, in a modulation of luminous intensity ). Ultrasound detection can therefore be divided into 3 steps: the conversion from ultrasound to phase-modulated optical signal, the transition from phase modulation to amplitude and finally the reading of the amplitude modulated signal with consequent conversion into an electrical signal. Industrial applications Well established applications of laser-ultrasonics are composite inspections for the aerospace industry and on-line hot tube thickness measurements for the metallurgical industry.J.P. Monchalin, \\"Laser-ultrasonics: from the laboratory to industry,\\" Review of Progress in Quantitative Nondestructive Evaluation, 23A, eds. D. O. Thompson and D. E. Chimenti, AIP Conference Proceedings, vol. 700, American Institute of Physics, Melville, NY, pp. 3‚Äì31 (2004). Optical generation and detection of ultrasound offers scanning techniques to produce ultrasonic images known as B- and C-scans, and for TOFD (time-of-flight-diffraction) studies. One of the first demonstrations on small defects (as small as 3mm x 3mm) in composites was demonstrated by Dewhurst and Shan in 1993,R.J. Dewhurst, R. He and Q. Shan, \\"Defect visualisation in carbon fibre composite using laser-ultrasound\\", Materials Evaluation, 51, 935-940, 1993. for which they were awarded an outstanding paper award by the American Society for Non- Destructive Testing in 1994.

It appears to be the case that he never used the surname Knickerbocker, as we know it, during his own lifetime; that he went by a variety of surnames including Van Bommel, and the variety of forms that would evolve into Knickerbacker towards the end of his life, and Knickerbocker after his death. There is no evidence that either Knickerbacker or Knickerbocker are Dutch surnames, and it's possible that the Knickerbocker name may have been a nickname, or that it evolved out of one. Very occasionally the name Van Wye or Van Wijhe appears as part of the evolving name, or in addition to it, and Van Alstyne says this indicates he came from Wijhe. Knickerbocker 'probably arrived in New Netherland/New York sometime in 1674 during the brief re-occupation of the colony by the Dutch in the third Dutch-Anglo War. First addressed as Van Bommel in Albany City records, it is fairly certain that he came from the general region called Bomlerswardt, lying between the Dutch fortified towns of Bommel-Zoutbommel and Maas Bommel.' If, indeed, Knickerbocker did come to the colony from the Bommel area, then it is much less clear why he's twice identified as being 'Van Wijhe\\"; perhaps, he'd lived in the tiny village of Wijhe, in Overijssel province, as well; perhaps, as some family historians claim, his family roots are associated with the village and a family of minor nobility originating there. Historians associated with Castle Wijenburg, a Wijhe family holding in Echteld, Netherlands, have observed, \\"In the USA, the family Knickerbocker circulates a pedigree in which they (possibly) descend from Roelof van Wijhe of the Arnhem van Wijhe branch. We have not found any evidence for this. In this Knickerbocker family tree Roelof van Wijhe has a son Johannes van Wijhe (van Bommel) who married Jannetje Jansen from Masterlandt. Their son was Harmen Jansen van Wye (or Wijhe) who arrived in the USA in 1674 and in 1682 signed a contract with the name \\"van Wyekycback\\". This name then became Knickerbocker in America.\\" In 2016 castle historians indicated they've been researching the history of both the castle and the family for more than a decade and state: \\" Roelof had two daughters but we've never found any proof for a son\\" and \\"We have never found any proof for a link between the Knickerbocker family and the Van Wijhes from Echteld.\\"emails dated 28/04/2016 from Friends of Wijhenburg Castle to C.J. Knickerbocker Harmen married Elizabeth Bogaert, the daughter of Jan Bogaert and Cornelia Everts of Harlem, New York. Before 1682, Harmen settled near what is now Albany, New York, and there in 1704 he bought through Harnie Gansevoort one-fourth of the land in Dutchess County near Red Hook, New York, which had been patented in 1688 to Pieter Schuyler. In 1722, Schuyler deeded seven (of thirteen) lots in the upper fourth of his patent to the seven children of Knickerbacker. The eldest of these children, Johannes Harmensen, received from the common council of the city of Albany a grant of of meadow and some acres of upland on the south side of Schaghticoke Creek. This Schaghticoke estate was held by Johannes Harmensen's son Johannes (1723‚Äì1802), a colonel in the Continental Army in the War of Independence, and by his son Herman, (1779‚Äì1855), a lawyer, a Federalist Party (United States) representative in Congress in 1809-1811, a member of the New York Assembly in 1816, and a famous gentleman of the old school, who for his courtly hospitality in his manor was called the \\"prince of Schaghticoke,\\" and whose name was borrowed by Washington Irving for use in his (Diedrich) Knickerbocker's History of New York (1809). Largely owing to Irving's book, the name Knickerbacker/Knickerbocker has passed into current use as a designation of the early Dutch settlers in New York and their descendants. Herman's son David Buel Knickerbacker (1833‚Äì1894), who maintained the original spelling of the family name, graduated at Trinity College in 1853 and at the General Theological Seminary in 1856. He was a rector for many years at Minneapolis, Minnesota, and in 1883 was consecrated Protestant Episcopal bishop of Indiana.

Bourgeois's innovations in design and voicing techniques have earned him worldwide acclaim for his acoustic guitars from professional players, hobbyists and collectors alike. Some notable musicians playing Bourgeois guitars include Luke Bryan, Ricky Skaggs, Bryan Smith, Ry Cooder, Scott Fore, Bryan Sutton, Vince Gill, Lee Roy Parnell, James Taylor and Guy Clark, Background Dana Bourgeois was born and raised in Westbrook, Maine. As a child, his interest in guitars developed after seeing The Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show in 1964. Bourgeois attended Bowdoin College, where he studied art history, and graduated in 1975. While at college, Bourgeois read a book called Classic Guitar Construction by Irving Stone, whose method in the book was, purportedly, \\"totally impossible.\\" After that, Bourgeois, working from his room on campus and using a machine shop owned by his grandfather, made a guitar of his own. His father helped with the wood working. Bourgeois opened a shop repairing guitars in Brunswick, Maine in 1976 and continued honing his craft as a luthier. He also worked at the Bowdoin College Museum of Art. By the late 1970s to 1980s Bourgeois worked in collaboration with Eric Schoenberg and Martin Guitars to design and build an OM style Guitar. Schoenberg Guitars In 1986, Bourgeois teamed up with guitarist Eric Schoenberg and established Schoenberg Guitars. The company manufactured flattop acoustic guitars. Bourgeois stayed with the company several years. Bourgeois Guitars Bourgeois started his own company, Bourgeois Guitars, which opened in 1993 and was located at Roy Continental Mill in Lewiston, Maine. His use of premium materials, such as Brazilian rosewood, Adirondack Spruce and Indian Rosewood, as well as his ability to \\"voice\\" his instruments earned Bourgeois a reputation within the music world as an expert luthier. Using a tapping method, he fine tunes individual pieces at key times throughout the manufacturing process. This high-quality sound distinguished Bourgeois from other luthiers and began attracting the attention of top musicians. In 1996, Bryan Sutton, then guitarist in Ricky Skaggs' band, purchased a Bourgeois guitar in Nashville music store. A year later, at the Thomas Point Beach Bluegrass Festival in Brunswick, ME, Sutton contacted Bourgeois to set up a meeting. \\"This guy calls me and says he's playing in Maine,\\" Bourgeois told Ray Routhier of the Portland Press Herald, \\"so I figure it could be anybody. But then he says he plays with Ricky Skaggs.\\" The meeting resulted in an endorsement deal, a collaboration with Skaggs', to make and sell the Ricky Skaggs Signature Model and Ricky Skaggs Country Boy Model guitars. \\"At a casual glance, making guitars seems glamorous, but really we're just making sawdust,\\" Bourgeois said, \\"But when we build one for a famous person, it's something everyone gets excited about.\\" In 1999, Bourgeois signed a distribution deal with Akai, a Japanese music and electronics company. With 16 employees and the prospect of growing his business internationally, Bourgeois expected to grow his business further. For a time, Akai marketed the Bourgeois Artisan Series guitars: the DR-A dreadnought and JR-A jumbo orchestra model. Along with the two guitars for international distribution, Bourgeois also made Martin Simpson and Ricky Skaggs signature guitars, though in limited editions. However, the distributor stopped ordering new guitars, leaving Bourgeois without the backing necessary to meet operating expenses. Despite attempts to find new investors and to sell directly to his customers online, Bourgeois was forced to liquidate the business, filing bankruptcy and auctioning off the guitar-making equipment. Pantheon Guitars After Bourgeois Guitars closed its doors, guitar hobbyist, collector and investment banker Patrick Theimer approached Bourgeois with another business venture. With Theimer, three other investors, and Bourgeois, who would oversee guitar production, Pantheon Guitars was formed in 2000. The business model employed at Pantheon allowed Bourgeois to focus on making the guitars he was known for while sharing marketing and manufacturing resources with other independent luthiers. Bourgeois continues to offer custom-designed guitars, including the BK/Slope D, which earned an Editor's Pick Award from Guitar Player Magazine. Among Bourgeois' current offerings are also guitars (his Aged Tone Series) made with a wood-aging process called torrefaction. While not \\"vintage\\", these guitars tend to replicate the look and sound of quality of instruments that are older, more \\"broken in\\". He commemorated the building of his 5,000th guitar with the Bourgeois Victoria that was described in an Acoustic Guitar Magazine article as a \\"one-of-a-kind, sub-parlor-size custom 12-fret instrument inspired by American guitars made during the Victorian era (1837-1901), matched with a period-style wooden 'coffin' case.\\" He also spends time training luthiers to carry on the trade.

Among its holdings was the famous Epic of Gilgamesh. Ashurbanipal's Library gives modern historians information regarding people of the ancient Near East. In his Outline of History, H. G. Wells calls the library \\"the most precious source of historical material in the world.\\" The materials were found in the archaeological site of Kouyunjik (ancient Nineveh, capital of Assyria) in northern Mesopotamia. The site is in modern-day northern Iraq, near the city of Mosul.Polastron, Lucien X.: \\"Books On Fire: The Tumultuous Story Of The World's Great Libraries\\" 2007, pp. 2‚Äì3, Thames & Hudson Ltd, LondonMenant, Joachim: \\"La biblioth√®que du palais de Ninive\\" 1880, Paris: E. Leroux Discovery The library is an archaeological discovery credited to Austen Henry Layard; most tablets were taken to England and can now be found in the British Museum, but a first discovery was made in late 1849 in the so-called South-West Palace, which was the Royal Palace of king Sennacherib (705‚Äì681 BC). Three years later, Hormuzd Rassam, Layard's assistant, discovered a similar \\"library\\" in the palace of King Ashurbanipal (668‚Äì627 BC), on the opposite side of the mound. Unfortunately, no record was made of the findings, and soon after reaching Europe, the tablets appeared to have been irreparably mixed with each other and with tablets originating from other sites. Thus, it is almost impossible today to reconstruct the original contents of each of the two main \\"libraries\\". Contents Ashurbanipal was known as a tenacious martial commander; however, he was also a recognized intellectual who was literate, and a passionate collector of texts and tablets.Roaf, M. (1990). Cultural atlas of Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East. New York: Facts on File. As an apprentice scribe he mastered both the Akkadian and the Sumerian languages He sent scribes into every region of the Neo-Assyrian Empire to collect ancient texts. He hired scholars and scribes to copy texts, mainly from Babylonian sources. Account of Ashurbanipal's campaign in Egypt against Taharqua (translation of the cuneiform, from the Rassam cylinder of Ashurbanipal). Ashurbanipal used war loot as a means of stocking his library. Because he was known for being cruel to his enemies, Ashurbanipal was able to use threats to gain materials from Babylonia and surrounding areas.\\"Assurbanipal's Library\\" , Knowledge and Power in the Neo-Assyrian Empire, British Museum Ashurbanipal's intense interest in collecting divination texts was one of his driving motivations in collecting works for his library. His original motive may have been to \\"gain possession of rituals and incantations that were vital to maintain his royal power.\\" The royal library consists of approximately 30,000 tablets and writing boards with the majority of them being severely fragmented.Parpola, S. (1983). \\"Assyrian Library Records\\". Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 42(1), 1‚Äì29. It can be gleaned from the conservation of the fragments that the number of tablets that existed in the library at the time of destruction was close to two thousand and the number of writing boards within the library can be placed at a total of three hundred. The majority of the tablet corpus (about 6,000) included colloquial compositions in the form of legislation, foreign correspondences and engagements, aristocratic declarations, and financial matters. The remaining texts contained divinations, omens, incantations and hymns to various gods, while others were concerned with medicine, astronomy, and literature. For all these texts in the library only ten contain expressive rhythmic literary works such as epics and myths. The Babylonian texts of the Ashurbanipal libraries can be separated into two different groups: the literary compositions such as divination, religious, lexical, medical, mathematical and historical texts as well as epics and myths, on the one hand, and the legal documents on the other hand. The group of the legal documents covers letters, contracts and administrative texts and consists of 1128 Babylonian tablets and fragments. Within the group of the literary compositions, of which 1331 tablets and fragments are classified so far, the divination texts can further be differentiated between 759 so-called library texts, such as tablets of the various omen series and their commentaries, and 636 so-called archival texts such as omen reports, oracle enquiries and the like.Jeanette C., Fincke. \\"The British Museum's Ashurbanipal Library Project.\\" Iraq, 2004, p. 55. The Epic of Gilgamesh, a masterpiece of ancient Babylonian poetry, was found in the library, as was the En√ªma Eli≈° creation story, the myth of Adapa, the first man, and stories such as the Poor Man of Nippur.Polastron, Lucien X.: \\"Books On Fire: The Tumultuous Story Of The World's Great Libraries\\" 2007, p. 3, Thames & Hudson Ltd, LondonMenant, Joachim: \\"La biblioth√®que du palais de Ninive\\" 1880, p. 33, Paris: E. Leroux, \\"Quels sont maintenant ces livres qui √©taient recueillis et conserv√©s avec tant de soin par les rois d'Assyrie dans ce pr√©cieux d√©p√¥t ? Nous y trouvons des livres sur l'histoire, la religion, les sciences naturelles, les math√©matiques, l'astronomie, la grammaire, les lois et les coutumes; ...\\" Another group of literary texts is the lexical texts and sign lists. There are twenty fragments of different tablets with archaic cuneiform signs arranged according to the syllabary A, whereas one is arranged according to the syllabary B. The Assyrian scribes of the Ashurbanipal Libraries needed sign lists to be able to read the old inscriptions and most of these lists were written by Babylonian scribes. The other groups of Babylonian written texts in Nineveh are the epics and myths and the historical texts with 1.4% each. There is only one mathematical text that is said to be excavated at Nineveh. The texts were principally written in Akkadian in the cuneiform script; however many of the tablets do not have an exact derivation and it is often difficult to ascertain their original homeland. Many of the tablets are indeed composed in the Neo-Babylonian script, but many were also known to be written in Assyrian as well. The tablets were often organized according to shape: four- sided tablets were for financial transactions, while round tablets recorded agricultural information.(In this era, some written documents were also on wood and others on wax tablets.) Tablets were separated according to their contents and placed in different rooms: government, history, law, astronomy, geography, and so on. The contents were identified by colored marks or brief written descriptions, and sometimes by the \\"incipit,\\" or the first few words that began the text.Murray, Stuart A.P. (2009) The Library: An Illustrated History. Chicago, IL: Skyhorse Publishing (p. 9) Nineveh was destroyed in 612 BC by a coalition of Babylonians, Scythians and Medes, an ancient Iranian people. It is believed that during the burning of the palace, a great fire must have ravaged the library, causing the clay cuneiform tablets to become partially baked. This potentially destructive event helped preserve the tablets. As well as texts on clay tablets, some of the texts may have been inscribed onto wax boards which, because of their organic nature, have been lost. The British Museum‚Äôs collections database counts 30,943 \\"tablets\\" in the entire Nineveh library collection, and the Trustees of the Museum propose to issue an updated catalogue as part of the Ashurbanipal Library Project. If all smaller fragments that actually belong to the same text are deducted, it is likely that the \\"library\\" originally included some 10,000 texts in all. The original library documents however, which would have included leather scrolls, wax boards, and possibly papyri, contained perhaps a much broader spectrum of knowledge than that known from the surviving clay tablet cuneiform texts. A large share of Ashurbanipal's libraries consisted of writing-boards and not clay tablets.

In 1844 he was nominated to the Academy of Inscriptions, and in 1847 he became professor of Persian at the Coll√®ge de France. But his knowledge and interest extended to all departments of Oriental learning. He served for many years as secretary, and then as president of the Soci√©t√© Asiatique. He died in Paris on 3 January 1876. Grave at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery (56th division)  Works  In 1826 he was charged by the French government with the preparation of an edition of the Shah Nameh (Livre des rois) (Kings Letter by Ferdoasi Tusi, the Persian epic poet), the first volume of which appeared in 1838, while the seventh and last was left unfinished at his death, being completed by Barbier de Meynard. His annual reports on Oriental science, presented to the society from 1840 to 1867, and collected after his death under the title Vingt-sept ans d'histoire des √©tudes orientales (Paris, 1879), are a history of the progress of Eastern learning during these years. Concerning the discoveries at Nineveh he wrote Lettres de M. Botta sur les d√©couvertes √† Khorsabad (1845). He also published anonymously, in conjunction with Justus Olshausen (1800‚Äì1882), Fragments relatifs √† la religion de Zoroastre (Paris, 1829); Confucii Chi-king sive liber carminum, ex latina P. Lacharmi interpretatione (Stuttgart, 1830); and an edition of Y-King, Antiquissimus Sinarum liber, ex interpretatione P. Regis (Stuttgart, 1834‚Äì1839).  Family  His wife Mary (1793‚Äì1883), daughter of Charles Clarke, had passed a great part of her early life in Paris, where she was very intimate with Madame R√©camier, before their marriage in 1847, and for nearly forty years her house was one of the most popular intellectual centers in Paris. Madame Mohl's friends included a large number of Englishmen and Englishwomen, including Florence Nightingale and her family. She died in Paris on 14 May 1883. Madame Mohl wrote Madame R√©camier, with a Sketch of the History of Society in France (London, 1862). Mohl's elder brother, Robert von Mohl (1799‚Äì1875), was a well-known jurist and statesman. Another brother, Moritz von Mohl (1802‚Äì1888), entered official life at an early age and was a member of the Frankfort parliament, and later of the parliament of W√ºrttemberg and of the imperial Reichstag. He was a voluminous writer on economic and political questions. References Further reading *Kathleen O'Meara, Madame Mohl, her Salon and Friends (1885) * M. C. M.

In the prime of his career, as a general manager, the executive who is responsible for all baseball operations, Devine was a major architect of four National League champions and three World Series champions in the six years from through . Specifically, Devine served as general manager of the St. Louis Cardinals from November 12, 1957, through August 17, 1964, and was directly responsible for putting the 1964 world champion Cardinals on the field - even though he had been fired with seven weeks remaining in the season, one of the most bizarre events in baseball annals. Many of the players Devine acquired led the Cardinals to the 1967 world title and the 1968 NL championship, the latter occurring during Devine's second tour (1968‚Äì78) as the Cardinals' general manager. In between those terms, from 1965‚Äì67, Devine was assistant to the president and then president (and de facto general manager) of the New York Mets, where he helped put together the organization that turned the franchise from baseball's laughingstocks into 1969's world champions as the \\"Miracle Mets.\\" During the 1980s, he also served as president of the St. Louis football Cardinals of the National Football League. Early baseball career Devine was born in St. Louis, and attended University City High School and Washington University in St. Louis. He played college basketball and semiprofessional baseball, then joined the Cardinals in 1939 as an office boy and batting practice pitcher. In 1941, he became business manager of the Class D Johnson City Cardinals. During a roster shortage, Devine activated himself as a second baseman for 27 games and 93 at bats, but he garnered only 11 hits for a .118 batting average. Thereafter he hung up his uniform and concentrated on his work in the front office. As pioneers of the farm system concept, the Cardinals had as many as 40 affiliated or owned teams in their minor league system before World War II. With time out for U.S. Navy service during the war, Devine rose rapidly through the ranks as a business manager of Cardinal farm teams, finally becoming the general manager of the Rochester Red Wings of the Triple-A International League in 1949. After six seasons at the helm of the Redbirds' top farm team, he joined the St. Louis front office in the autumn of 1954. The Cardinals, recently purchased by brewery magnate August A. Busch Jr., were in rebuilding mode under trade-happy general manager \\"Frantic\\" Frank Lane. The team finished second in the NL in , but Lane had worn out his welcome; he moved on to run the Cleveland Indians and was replaced in St. Louis by the steadier hand of Devine. First term as Cardinals' general manager Devine began to add talent and depth to the St. Louis roster, including African American and Latin American players. He was seen as being very progressive when it came to signing or trading for black and Latin ballplayers, whereas other teams (most notably the New York Yankees) showed a great deal of reluctance in this area. In the first five years of his reign, he promoted or traded for players such as Bob Gibson, Bill White, Curt Flood and Juli√°n Javier. But the Cardinals were mired in the middle of the pack of a very powerful National League. In ‚Äîa season also marked by the final campaign of the Cardinals' longtime superstar, Stan Musial‚Äîthe Redbirds surged into contention, sparked by the acquisition of shortstop Dick Groat from the Pittsburgh Pirates, 18-win seasons from pitchers Gibson and Ernie Broglio, the comeback of left-handed starter Curt Simmons (who had been signed off the scrap heap by Devine), and the strong campaign of young catcher Tim McCarver. The Cardinals challenged the eventual world champion Los Angeles Dodgers into mid-September before finishing second, the club's highest showing since 1957. Devine was chosen as Major League Executive of the Year by The Sporting News for his efforts in returning the Cards to contending status. 1964: Premature firing and a world championship However, when the season began, the Philadelphia Phillies took a stranglehold on first place. The Cardinals were trying a variety of young players in Musial's old left-field position, and none were taking hold. At the June 15 trading deadline, Devine sprang. Lou Brock, a 25-year-old outfielder with great speed (and deceptive power as a hitter) in his third year with the second-division Chicago Cubs, was not living up to his projected potential. Devine offered the Cubs Broglio, his 18-game winner from the previous year, plus outfielder Doug Clemens and pitcher Bobby Shantz for Brock and two marginal pitchers. The Cubs agreed, and one of the most significant (and one-sided) trades in baseball history was made. Brock hit .348 for the remainder of the season, and led the Cardinals to their three pennants and two world titles over the next five years. He played the rest of his career with St. Louis (retiring in 1979), and steal 938 bases (breaking Ty Cobb's record, and currently second all-time to Rickey Henderson), exceed the 3,000 hit mark (with 3,023), bat .424 with 34 hits and 14 stolen bases in 21 World Series games, and become a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. Ironically, Brock's impact on the Cardinals' won-lost mark or position in the standings was not felt immediately. The team continued to trail the Phillies by a large margin and it looked to all as though the club's pennant drought would extend to 18 years; by August 17, the Redbirds were mired in fifth place, nine games behind the Phillies. Owner Busch was bitterly disappointed, and decided to clean out his front office. On the advice of his special assistant, legendary Branch Rickey, Busch fired Devine and business manager Art Routzong, and accepted the resignation of assistant general manager Eddie Stanky. Manager Johnny Keane was temporarily spared, but Dodgers' coach Leo Durocher was secretly negotiating with Busch to take over for 1965.The Associated Press, October 17, 1964 Meanwhile, Devine's old job went to Rickey prot√©g√© Bob Howsam. As events unfolded, Busch had acted in haste. The Cardinals began to win, while the Phillies suffered an epic September collapse, losing a -game lead with a dozen games to play, sparking a wild, four-team, 11th hour scramble for the pennant. On the final day of the season, after sweeping the Phillies to take first place, the Cardinals prevailed, clinching the NL championship for the first time since 1946 by beating the lowly Mets after losing the first two games of the series. Led by Gibson, the undisputed ace of the staff since Broglio's trade, and McCarver, the Cardinals then defeated the New York Yankees in a seven-game World Series. Even though he had been on the sidelines since August 17, Devine again was cited as the top executive in baseball by The Sporting News. Meanwhile, Keane resigned after the World Series triumph (and became skipper of the Yankees). Instead of Durocher, Cardinal coach Red Schoendienst was named as manager for 1965. Building the Miracle Mets Devine's departure was a cause-celebre in St. Louis, but the damage had been done. Although he landed on his feet as the successor to George Weiss, president of the Mets, Devine was forced to leave his hometown and the only team he had ever worked for at the pinnacle of his career. But, while Devine never moved his family to New York, he tackled his new job with gusto. On his watch, the Mets began to strengthen their farm system, signing and developing young pitching talent that formed the core of the 1969 world champions: Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman, Nolan Ryan, Gary Gentry and Jim McAndrew. Meanwhile, Howsam left the Cardinals in January 1967 to become general manager of the Cincinnati Reds and Musial was named his successor. In , the Cardinals won 101 games and ran away with the National League race, winning the pennant by games, then bested the Boston Red Sox in a seven-game World Series. The core of the team was Devine's, but Howsam had contributed significantly to the roster with his 1966 acquisitions of NL Most Valuable Player first baseman Orlando Cepeda and right fielder Roger Maris. At the other extreme, the Mets, with most of their young pitching talent still ripening in the minors, lost 101 games and finished dead last. Baseball people took note of Devine's accomplishments in New York, however, and when Musial, a world champion general manager in his maiden season, decided he did not want to continue in the role, Busch was able to secure Devine's release from the Mets, and brought him back to the Cardinals as executive vice president and general manager on December 2, 1967. Second term as Cardinals' general manager In 1968, led by Gibson's all-time record 1.12 earned run average, the Cardinals repeated as NL champions and held a three games to one lead in the World Series against the Detroit Tigers, but lost the final three contests to be denied back-to-back world titles. Suddenly, Devine was faced with retooling an aging roster. Brock and Gibson remained Cardinal mainstays, but Devine traded Cepeda to the Atlanta Braves after the 1968 season, then dealt Flood and McCarver to Philadelphia following the 1969 campaign. In the Cepeda deal, Devine acquired Joe Torre, who won the NL batting average championship and the league's Most Valuable Player award. But the Cardinals suffered long- term damage when Busch ordered Devine to trade star left-handed pitcher Steve Carlton in after a salary dispute. Carlton, coming off his first 20-win season, was sent to the Phillies for pitcher Rick Wise, an uneven swap that helped to turn the last-place Phillies into contenders. Meanwhile, the Cardinals became NL East also-rans. In 1978, Devine was again replaced as Cardinals' general manager (this time by John Claiborne) and again he departed the organization, working for the San Francisco Giants as assistant general manager, the Montreal Expos as a player development official, and the Phillies as a scout. From 1981 to 1986, he was club president of the St. Louis football Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals) of the National Football League. But eventually he returned to baseball and the baseball Cardinals, where he served as a special scout and advisor to the general manager Walt Jocketty. Devine died in St. Louis at the age of 90.

It follows a young woman at a preparatory school in 1980s New York City and her ingratiation with a group of elite peers. It was released by Lionsgate in 2001. Plot Cat Storm is a teenager attending an elite preparatory school in 1980s Manhattan. Cat begins to fall in with the popular crowd at her prep school, abandoning her longtime friend, Delilah, who is expelled from the school. Cat surrounds herself with some of the school's most popular students, befriending Grace, an English exchange student, and attending holiday parties held by Peg which are often frequented by Kenny, an ephebophile who supplies cocaine to the teenagers and tries to have sex with the young men. Amidst struggles at home between her divorced parents, Cat becomes attracted to William Sellers, a delinquent who comes from an abusive household, and who also is significantly less wealthy than his peers. William and Cat pursue a brief relationship, which he ends, leaving Cat distraught. After some of Cat's anti-semitic friends find out her father is Jewish, she is ostracized, and only accepted by the prim Eloise, who befriends her. Hearing about a party hosted by Delilah on the beach in The Hamptons, Cat goes to stay the night with Eloise at her house, using it as an opportunity to attend the party. There, she confronts Delilah, and the two argue about Cat abandoning her, but make up. Delilah walks to a nearby gay bar operated by Kenny, where she tries to find a ride back to the city for her and Cat. While there, she stumbles upon William receiving oral sex from a male drug dealer. William chases after Delilah and confronts her in the woods on her way back to the beach, and the two get into an argument. He pushes her, causing her to hit her head on a rock. Delilah screams at him and threatens to press charges, and, in a panic, he beats her to death. The following morning, after searching for Delilah, Cat discovers that Delilah's body has been found and William arrested. After school that afternoon, the paparazzi and reporters interview the students with questions about Delilah, and they all deem her \\"reckless\\" and have little to say of her. The film ends with Cat and her mother resolving their own familial conflict and her mother apologizing to her in Central Park. Cast Reception The reviewer for AllMovie wrote that \\"Tart is a straightforward depiction of self-possessed, spoiled teens, is the best argument yet for getting an after-school job in the late high school years\\". The reviewer for PopMatters wrote that \\"Tart is another in a long line of unoriginal attempts to explore one girl‚Äôs desire to fit in.\\" The reviewer for Cinema.com wrote that \\"The end really isn't an ending. It makes the audience wonder, that's it. There is no real plot, focus, direction or point. It is really not worth seeing.\\" In contrast, the reviewer for the website Through the Shattered Lens actually liked the film even though she called it a \\"massively flawed film\\". Robert Pardi of TV Guide gave the film a middling review, writing: \\"In this blast at the privileged classes, yet another young social climber discovers the bitter accuracy of F. Scott Fitzgerald's observation about the very rich: \\"They are different from you and me\\"... But this expose doesn't elicit much sympathy for characters whose big dreams amount to little more than lust for a better grade of cashmere.\\" Contactmusic.com gave the film a negative review, writing: \\"Not only does the provocative title of Tart mislead us, but the packaging features a lithe Dominique Swain on its covers, her schoolgirl skirt blowing up to expose her panties... The structure of the film is nonexistent (and in other words, there's little plot to hold together a series of oddball scenes), and the acting is perfunctory -- Mischa Barton's horrendous British accent a grating exercise in poor voice coaching and a director too in love with her own material to even notice.\\" A review published in The Massachusetts Daily Collegian was critical of the film, noting: \\"Writer-director Christina Wayne has so little clue about how to make a film that none of the relationships between seems remotely understandable. Characters float in and out with little connection to each; every scene the viewer needs to reestablish who everyone is in relation to one another.\\" References External links  Category:2000s coming-of-age drama films Category:2000s high school films Category:2001 independent films Category:2001 LGBT-related films Category:2000s romantic drama films Category:2000s teen drama films Category:2001 films Category:American coming-of-age drama films Category:American films Category:American high school films Category:American independent films Category:American romantic drama films Category:American teen drama films Category:American teen LGBT-related films Category:English- language films Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:2001 directorial debut films Category:2001 drama films ","title":"Tart (film)"},{"id":"2520278","title":"Massachusetts's 4th congressional district"},{"id":"2520286","title":"P-Model"},{"id":"2520296","text":"The naval Battle of Playa Honda (Spanish: La Batalla Naval de Playa Honda; Filipino: Labanan sa Playa Honda), was the first of three known minor conflicts during the Eighty Years' War between the United Provinces and Spain held in Playa Honda (present-day Botolan) in the Philippines.

It was formed in 2014 by the merger of multinational law firm Squire Sanders with Washington, D.C. based Patton Boggs. It is one of the 30 largest law firms in the world by total headcount and gross revenue, twelfth largest firm in the UK by revenue, and one of the top 15 by number of countries occupied. It is also one of the largest US-headquartered law firms in Asia. Its largest offices are in Washington, London and Cleveland, each having more than 100 lawyers. The firm serves a diverse base of legal clients ranging from Fortune 100 and FTSE Index 100 corporations to newly emerging companies, private clients and local and national governmental entities. Squire Patton Boggs is currently the third-largest lobbying firm in the U.S. after Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck. The lobbying arm, long managed by Thomas Hale Boggs Jr., is currently managed by Edward Newberry and Robert Kapla. History =Squire, Sanders & Dempsey= The firm was founded in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1890 as Squire, Sanders & Dempsey by Cleveland attorneys Andrew Squire and James H. Dempsey, and Judge William B. Sanders. Until the 1990s, it was primarily an Ohio law firm, with the exception of Washington, DC and offices in several other US cities and Brussels It was one of the first US law firms to expand into Eastern Europe in the wake of the Cold War, under the leadership of firm chairman Thomas J. Quigley. It opened several offices in the former Soviet bloc region during the 1990s, taking on a key role in the privatization of state enterprises in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Ukraine and Poland. It subsequently absorbed a number of other legal practices including several Pacific Rim offices of Graham & James and the Florida-based law firm of Steel Hector & Davis.Squire Sanders (2011). Squire Sanders partners approve Western Australia combination . Retrieved 27 September 2011. The firm also made overtures toward mergers with Denton Wilde Sapte, Seyfarth Shaw and Bryan Cave under Stanton's leadership. =Hammonds= Hammonds was an international law firm headquartered in Leeds, United Kingdom, with offices in Beijing, Berlin, Birmingham, BRADFORD, Brussels, Hong Kong, Leeds, Madrid, Manchester, Munich and Paris. Hammonds' origins dated back to the founding of a legal practice in Yorkshire in 1887. Although it was a major firm in Yorkshire and the West Midlands region, it did not open a London office until 1991. In 2000, Hammond Suddards and Edge Ellison merged, forming Hammond Suddards Edge, at that time the 11th-largest law firm in the UK. The firm's rapid expansion left it ¬£30 million in debt in the early 2000s and led to a downsizing through 2005. The firm was ranked 20th in the UK by turnover in The Lawyer UK 100 2006, with a turnover of ¬£132 million. Throughout 2005-2009, the firm underwent significant restructuring under the stewardship of Managing Partner Peter Crossley. As of 2009, the partnership consisted of approximately 180 partners and more than 1,000 employees. Hammonds converted to a Limited Liability Partnership in May 2008. Hammonds and Squire, Sanders & Dempsey announced that they were in merger talks in August 2010. The partnerships of both firms voted in favor of a merger in November 2010, and it was completed on January 1, 2011, forming the Squire Sanders Swiss association. The merger with Hammonds added offices in Madrid, Berlin, Paris and Munich to the Squire Sanders network, in addition to significantly boosting its presence in the UK where it previously had only 30 lawyers. London overtook Cleveland as the largest office of the combined firm. The American Lawyer estimated Squire Sanders to be the 24th largest law firm in the world by number of lawyers and 41st by annual revenue as of 2012. =Patton Boggs= The firm of Patton Boggs was founded in 1962 by James R. Patton, Jr. and joined soon after by George Blow and Thomas Hale Boggs, Jr. It has \\"participated in the formation of every major multilateral trade agreement considered by Congress.\\"\\"About Us\\", Patton Boggs Boggs joined the firm in 1966 after serving as an economist for the Joint Economic Committee and in the executive office of President Lyndon B.

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Patton Boggs was one of the top law firms contributing to federal candidates during the 2012 election cycle, donating US$1.7 million, 67% to Democrats. By comparison, during that same period Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld donated US$2.56, 66% to Democrats, while oil conglomerate ExxonMobil donated US$2.66 million, 88% to Republicans. Since 1990, Squire Patton Boggs contributed US$14.12 million to federal campaigns, and since 1998 spent US$2.72 million on lobbying. The 2014 Vault.com survey of more than 18,800 associates ranked Patton Boggs as having the best record for pro bono work in the country, and the firm was among the prestigious white-shoe law firms. Following its involvement in a lawsuit with Chevron in Ecuador, Patton Boggs underwent layoffs and partner exits in 2013 amid a 12% drop in revenue, and entered merger talks with Squire Sanders in 2014. The firms announced that they would merge on June 1, 2014 under the name Squire Patton Boggs, adding 330 lawyers to the firm's existing headcount. Squire Patton Boggs now maintains one of the largest lobbying practices in Washington, D.C., gaining extensively from the merger with Patton Boggs, which was the largest US lobbying firm by revenue between 2003 and 2013. =Squire Patton Boggs= Chart displaying top 25 lobbying firms, (rank for Jan-Jun 2010.) Squire Patton Boggs is on top of the list. As a result of the merger, Patton Boggs closed its Anchorage, Alaska office, and a number of high-profile attorneys left the firm, including Benjamin Ginsberg and two other prominent Republican lawyers who joined Jones Day, and a number of healthcare-policy lawyers who joined Akin Gump. The combined firm adopted Squire Sanders' existing merit pay system for partners over Patton Boggs' more traditional \\"eat what you kill\\" system. Partner compensation under the merit system ranges from US$300,000 for some non-equity partners to US$3 million for the three most highly compensated partners. The firm currently posts an abnormally high leverage ratio, with almost eight lawyers to every partner, according to its 2014-end-of-the-year numbers for full-time lawyers. The D.C. offices of Squire Sanders and Patton Boggs recently moved into the same building, previously the long-standing home of legacy Patton Boggs. The combined firm kept separate revenue pools for its two legacy partnerships from the June merger until the end of 2014, but these are now unified. In 2016, the firm announced a merger with San Francisco-based disputes and compliance boutique Carroll, Burdick & McDonough, adding 50 lawyers in California, China, Hong Kong, and Germany, including a new office near Stuttgart, in B√∂blingen. In July 2016, the firm opened an office in Darwin, NT, Australia as part of its Asia-Pacific practice group. The firm announced that effective 1 January 2017, Fred Nance would become Global Managing Partner of Squire Patton Boggs, U.S. LLP, managing 955 attorneys in 36 offices in 16 countries, including U.S., Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe.

It replaced the older Junior Secondary Certificate (JSC) and the Scottish Leaving Certificate (SLC), and it was the Scottish equivalent of the General Certificate of Education (or GCE), used in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. One primary distinction between the Scottish Leaving Certificate and the Scottish Certificate of Education was that the latter had less strict regulations in terms of compulsory subjects and workload of the individual curricula. Levels of Award The SCE was intended to cater for the increased range of subjects available to pupils since the raising of the school leaving age from 14 to 15. It initially included examinations and awards at both Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher'). The Ordinary Grade award was replaced with the Standard Grade award, and the Higher Grade award was revised, during second half of the 1980s. These changes placed increased emphasis on coursework and the application of knowledge within tests. The now- obsolete Certificate of Sixth Year Studies (a qualification taken by many in their final year after passing the subject at Higher Grade) was not a part of the Scottish Certificate of Education. However, both were awarded by the Scottish Examination Board (and its successor, the Scottish Qualifications Authority). Successors The Scottish Certificate of Education was replaced by the Scottish Qualifications Certificate (SQC) which was first issued from January 2000, after the last examinations of the Scottish Certificate of Education in 1999. The SQC also incorporated the CSYS (although this was in the final stages of being replaced with the Advanced Higher) and the Record of Education and Training (RET). The SQC certifies the new qualifications that were introduced in 2014. These include the new National 3, 4 and 5 qualifications, revised Higher and Advanced Higher qualifications as part of the Curriculum for Excellence.

Marketing intelligence is necessary when entering a foreign market.  Concept  Marketing intelligence determines the intelligence needed, collects it by searching the environment and delivers it to marketing managers who need it. Marketing intelligence software can be deployed using an on-premises or software as a service (SaaS, or cloud-based) model. These systems take data from disparate data sources, like web analytics, business intelligence, call center and sales data, which often come separate reports, and put them into a single environment. In order to collect marketing intelligence, marketing managers must be in constant touch with relevant books, newspapers and trade publications. They must talk to various stakeholders like customers, distributors, and suppliers. In addition to this, they must also monitor social media and carry out online discussions. Marketing managers can design reports that correlate and visualize data coming from a variety of departments and sources (even, in some cases, external data). This allows them to see current key performance indicators in real-time (or as quickly as sources provide data) and analyze trends, rather than wait for analysts to deliver periodic reports. Marketing intelligence systems are designed to be used by marketing managers and often viewed by employees throughout an organization. Notable systems on the market include Contify, Leadtime, Pardot, Marketo, and Hubspot. They may have user interfaces that closely resemble consumer software than the software around individual data sources, which are designed for use by analysts. Business intelligence, for example, can collect highly accurate, timely, granular data, but often requires IT support to build and edit custom reports. Organizationally, marketing intelligence can be the name of the department that performs both the market intelligence and competitor analysis roles. Business intelligence of any kind may also be their responsibility, in tandem with (or solely performed by) the Finance department, for measuring market share and setting growth targets, the mergers and acquisitions group for exploring acquisition opportunities, the legal department to protect the organization's assets or research and development for cross-company comparison of innovation trends and the discovery of opportunities through innovative differentiation.  Steps  With the following steps being applied, a company's marketing intelligence system will prove to be beneficial to its effective functioning. #Train and Motivate Sales Force: A company's sales force can be an excellent source of information about the current trends in the market. They are the \\"intelligence gatherers\\" for the company. The acquired facts can be regarding the company's market offerings, whether any improvements are required or not or is there any opportunity for new products, etc. It can also provide a credible source to know about competitor activities, consumers, distributors, and retailers. # Motivate Distributors, retailers, and other intermediaries to pass along important intelligence: Specialists are hired by companies to gather marketing intelligence. In order to measure the quality of production, the way the employees are behaving with customers, quality of facilities being provided; retailers and service providers send mystery shoppers. Firms can also assess the quality of customer experience with the shops with the use of mystery shoppers. # Network Externally: Every firm must keep a tab on its competitors. Competitive intelligence describes the broader discipline of researching, analyzing and formulating data and information from the entire competitive environment of any organization. This can be done by purchasing the competitor's products, checking the advertising campaigns, the press media coverage, reading their published reports, etc. Competitive intelligence must be legal and ethical. # Set up a customer advisory panel: Companies can set up panels consisting of customers. They can be the company's largest customers or representatives of customers or the most outspoken customers. Many business schools set up panels consisting of alumni who provide their knowledge and expertise and help in constituting the course curriculum. # Optimal usage of Government data resources: Governments of almost all countries publish reports regarding the population trends, demographic characteristics, agricultural production and a lot of other such data. All this data must be or can be referred to as base data. It can help in planning and formulating policies for the companies. # Information bought from external suppliers: Certain agencies sell data that can be useful to other companies. For example, television channels will require information on the number of viewership, ratings of TV programs, etc. An agency that calculates this information and generates this data will provide it to companies that need it. # Collect Competitive Intelligence through online customer feedback: The customer's view of a product is essential for any company. Ultimately it's the customer who's buying the product. Hence customer feedback must be taken. Online platforms like chat rooms, blogs, discussion forums, customer review boards can be used to generate customer feedback. This enables the firm to understand customer experiences and impressions. It becomes easier for companies to apply a structured system to do so as it can then scan out the relevant messages without much of a trouble.

It was AOL's primary video game blog, with sister blogs dealing with MMORPG gaming in general and the popular MMORPG World of Warcraft in particular. After declining readership, it was announced that Joystiq would be shut down on February 3, 2015, as part of moves to downsize AOL's operations by shuttering its \\"underperforming\\" properties. History E3 2006 crew =Predecessors= As of early 2004, Weblogs, Inc. was seeking to add a blog to its repertoire for the sole purpose of covering news related to video games, as evidenced by the now-defunct The Video Games Weblog, founded February 27, 2004. On March 12, Weblogs, Inc. CEO Jason Calacanis announced two spinoff projects: The Unofficial Playstation 3 Weblog and The Unofficial Xbox 2, both of which are now similarly retired, though they would set a precedent for the launching of Joystiq's Fanboy blogs in 2005. However, none of these three initial weblogs were ever aggressively marketed, and The Video Games Weblog made its final post on May 18, 2005, amassing 175 blog entries in total (a rather scant amount by Weblogs, Inc. standards). All three blogs are now listed as \\"On Hiatus/Retired\\" in the Weblogs, Inc. directory. David Touve, the primary contributor to these early blogs, would later act as Joystiqs features editor for a short time in late 2005 before resigning due to the birth of his child. =Formation= Later that year, following 2004's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Peter Rojas, the founder of and lead contributor to the company's flagship blog Engadget, formally introduced Joystiq to the masses, positioning the blog as an extension to Engadget's Gaming subdomain. However, being a separate and wholly video game-related entity, Joystiq allowed for much more in-depth analysis of the video game industry than the primarily consumer electronics-oriented Engadget. While Joystiq had featured content as early as April 2, the blog is not officially considered to have been launched until Rojas's public revelation on Engadget on Wednesday, June 16, 2004. =Changes in site format= The first major shakeup in Joystiqs history occurred in June 2005, when senior editor Ben Zackheim, after being offered a position at America Online's Games division, announced his resignation due to a conflict of interest. He was succeeded by Vladimir Cole, a blogger who had been hired February 2005 and who held the position of Editor-in-Chief until February 2007, when Christopher Grant took over after Cole took a job with Microsoft's Xbox division. Weblogs, Inc. was acquired in October 2005 by America Online. On November 21, 2005, coinciding with the North American launch of the Xbox 360, Joystiq welcomed its first spinoff project: Xbox 360 Fanboy, a blog devoted solely to the in-depth coverage of its namesake hardware. For the next three weeks this trend would continue, with PSP Fanboy launching on November 28, WoW Insider on December 6, and DS Fanboy on December 12. On February 15, 2006, a sixth blog was introduced: Revolution Fanboy, (which was later renamed to Nintendo Wii Fanboy), while March 29 heralded the arrival of PS3 Fanboy, completing Joystiqs trifecta of specialized next-gen coverage. While some have criticized the practice of splintering off Joystiqs primary areas of expertise as nothing more than a thinly veiled bid to increase traffic, Jason Calacanis has justified these actions by asserting that as Joystiq grows so too does its potential audience, and thus separate blogs are necessary to fulfill these specialized niches.Jason Calacanis, December 21, 2005, The Joystiq Network calacanis.com On January 26, 2006, Joystiq coined the phrase \\"DS phat\\", a nickname for the old-style Nintendo DS that helps differentiate between the old DS and the DS Lite. On November 2, 2007, Massively was launched to cover MMOs in general. On January 27, 2009, the Fanboy sites were rebranded and integrated directly into the main Joystiq site. DS and Wii Fanboy were merged into Joystiq Nintendo, as were PSP and PS3 Fanboy merged into Joystiq PlayStation, and Xbox 360 Fanboy became Joystiq Xbox. Until 2010, these sites continued to feature specialized posts in addition to relevant content from the main Joystiq site. On June 11, 2010, as part of the new \\"Futurestiq\\" iteration of the site, the three platform-specific sites shut down, with staff folded into Joystiq full-time. In January 2012, Ludwig Kietzmann became the editor-in-chief after Grant left to form a new video game news website with Vox Media, owners of The Verge, known as Polygon. = Shutdown = In January 2015, co-owned blog TechCrunch reported that AOL was planning to shutter underperforming content properties, particularly in the technology and lifestyle verticals, to focus on its stronger properties, video, and advertising sales. On January 27, 2015, Re/code reported that Joystiq was among the sites that were \\"likely\\" to be shut down as part of this restructuring plan. Readership of Joystiq had seen sharp declines, falling by at least 18% over the previous year. On January 30, 2015, various Joystiq staff members, and eventually the site itself, confirmed that the site, along with its spin-offs Massively and WoW Insider, and fellow AOL property TUAW, would cease operations after February 3, 2015. It is expected that future gaming-oriented coverage will be assumed by Engadget. After the shutdown, on February 10, 2015, the staff of Massively launched a successor site, Massively Overpowered, dedicated to the continuation of their MMO coverage. Editors The Joystiq staff before the closure included editor-in-chief Ludwig Kietzmann, managing editor Susan Arendt, feature content director Xav de Matos, reviews content director Richard Mitchell, news content director Alexander Sliwinski, senior reporter Jess Conditt, and contributing editors Sinan Kubba, Danny Cowan, Mike Suszek and Earnest Cavalli. Thomas Schulenberg and Sam Prell maintained the blog on the weekends as the weekend editors and Anthony John Agnello served as community manager. Previous Joystiq staff members include editor-in-chief Chris Grant, managing editor James Ransom- Wiley, features editor Kevin Kelly, reviews editor Justin McElroy, editors Griffin McElroy, J.C. Fletcher, and Mike Schramm, East Coast Editor Andrew Yoon, and West Coast Editor Randy Nelson. Podcast The original format for the Joystiq Podcast was hosted by Chris Grant, Ludwig Kietzmann and Justin McElroy. The three would discuss various gaming-related news stories. Segments included, 'What Have you Been Playing?', 'Brush With Fame', 'The Big Three', 'The Do It Line!' and 'Reader Mail'. Various podcasts have included guests from other gaming websites such as CheapyD, Chris Remo, Stephen Totilo, Rocco Botte, Tom Chick and Shawn Andrich but they stopped doing them. The first episode of the subsequent Joystiq Show, posted on June 17, 2011, promised a more serious, academic format, with a multifaceted examination of Duke Nukem Forever including an interview with voice actor Jon St. John and a review roundtable. Over time, the show's format evolved to include more off-the-cuff discussion, while maintaining the topical nature. The latest iteration of the podcast, the Super Joystiq Podcast, was announced at Joystiqs PAX East 2012 panel and officially released on May 4, 2012. This podcast features every editor, grouped together in a different configuration every week, each participating in an intro, news, preview, or \\"Joystiq Research Institute\\" segment. Awards While Joystiq has been nominated for several awards in the category of technology-related weblogs, it has consistently been overshadowed in this regard by blogs representing a far wider spectrum of technology, including Slashdot, Gizmodo, and its ubiquitous sibling Engadget. Joystiq has, however, been included in a number of listings of outstanding weblogs, including Forbes.com's Best of the Web and the Feedster 500.

Gold signet ring belonging to Jean III de Grailly in the British Museum, late 14th century.British Museum Collection Jean III de Grailly (aka. John De Grailly, died 7 September 1376), Captal de Buch, , was a Gascon nobleman and a military leader in the Hundred Years' War, who was praised by the chronicler Jean Froissart as an ideal of chivalry.  Biography  He was the son of Jean II de Grailly, Captal de Buch, Vicomte de Benauges, and of Blanch de Foix, a cousin of the counts of Foix. Attached to the English side in the conflict, he was made Count of Bigorre by Edward III of England, and was also a founder and the fourth Knight of the Garter in 1348. He played a decisive role as a cavalry leader under Edward, the Black Prince in the Battle of Poitiers (1356), with de Buch leading a flanking move against the French that resulted in the capture of the king of France (John II), as well as many of his nobles. John was taken to London by the Black Prince and held to ransom. In 1364, he commanded the forces of Charles II of Navarre in Normandy, where he was defeated and captured by Bertrand du Guesclin at Cocherel. After his release the following year, he defected to the French side and was made lord of Nemours by Charles V of France. However, he soon re-established his loyalty to the English, and in 1367 he went to Spain with the Black Prince, fighting at the Battle of N√°jera. Here he again faced Bertrand du Guesclin, but this time it was du Guesclin who was captured, and the Captal was put in charge of the prisoner. He was rewarded for his service by being made the Constable of Aquitaine in 1371. Again fighting for the English, he commanded an English relief force when the French attacked La Rochelle in 1372. While attempting to lift the siege of Soubise, his force was surprised by a French force led by Owain Lawgoch, a Welsh soldier of fortune in the French service. The Captal and Sir Thomas Percy, seneschal of Poitou, were captured. The Captal spent the remainder of his life as a prisoner at the Temple in Paris, because Charles V believed him too dangerous to ransom back to the English. Froissart gives an account of the Captal de Buch's chivalry and courage at the time of the peasant uprising in 1358 called the Jacquerie (see link). Jean de Grailly was a prisoner of the French from 1372 onwards. He had refused his freedom as it would have meant taking up arms against the king of England, which he swore never to do. His personal allegiance to the Black Prince was so strong that, upon hearing of the prince's death, he lost all resolve, refused food and died a few days later in Paris. Since he left no heirs from his marriage to Rose d' Albret, his uncle, Archambaud, Count of Foix and of Bigorre took the title Captal de Buch, which passed to his descendants the Counts of Foix.

Part of the civil parish of Shardlow and Great Wilne, and the district of South Derbyshire, it is also very close to the border with Leicestershire, defined by route of the River Trent which passes close to the south. Just across the Trent is the Castle Donington parish of North West Leicestershire. An important late 18th-century river port for the trans- shipment of goods to and from the River Trent to the Trent and Mersey Canal, during its heyday from the 1770s to the 1840s it became referred to as \\"Rural Rotterdam\\" and \\"Little Liverpool\\". Today Shardlow is considered Britain's most complete surviving example of a canal village, with over 50 Grade II listed buildings and many surviving public houses within the designated Shardlow Wharf Conservation Area. History Due to its location on the River Trent, which up to this point is easily navigable, there is much early evidence of human activity in the area, dating back to 1500 BC. In 1999 the 1300 BC Hanson Log Boat, a Bronze Age log boat was discovered at the nearby Hanson plc gravel pit. Sawn into sections so that it could be transported and conserved, the boat is now in Derby Museum and Art Gallery.Hanson Log Boat , Derby.gov.uk, accessed May 2011 Five years later, a JCB in the quarry unearthed a bronze sword embedded in a vertical position in the gravel. There is also a Stone Age tumulus at Lockington, an Iron Age settlement between Shardlow/Wilne and the river, and later Roman finds at Great Wilne. In 1009 √Ü√æelr√¶d Unr√¶d (King Ethelred the Unready) signed a charter at the Great Council which recognised the position and boundaries of Westune.Aston on Trent Conservation Area History , South Derbyshire, accessed 25 November 2008 The land described in that charter included the lands now known as Shardlow, Great Wilne, Church Wilne, Crich, Smalley, Morley, Weston and Aston-on-Trent. Under this charter √Ü√æelr√¶d gave his minister a number of rights that made him free from tax and to his own rule within the manor.Charter of √Üthelred, The Great Council, 1009, accessible at Derby records The manor of Shardlowe was the subject of a land deal in 1413.http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT4/H5/CP40no609/bCP40no609dorses/IMG_0752.htm The village is listed as Serdelau in the Domesday Book \\\\- translated as a settlement near a mound with a notch or indentation ‚Äì but there have been up to 20 different spellings noted by historians. The oldest surviving building today in the village is believed to be the \\"Dog & Duck\\" public house, located in the upper end of the village. =Transport hub= An old barn, built for storing grain before the arrival of the canal The River Trent below Shardlow is navigable all the way to the Humber Estuary, as is the River Soar which joins further down stream. Resultantly Shardlow was always an important transport hub and trading point, as wide-beam ships and boats traded cargo commercially with the packhorse trails going across the region. The tariffs charged for goods proceeding through the port enabled industrialist Leonard Fosbrooke to build Shardlow Hall, and later led to skirmishes being fought locally during the English Civil War for control of the strategic transport hub. The original London to Manchester road (formerly an important turnpike road, authorised in 1738, and now the A6), passes through the village, having crossed the Trent at Cavendish Bridge, designed by the Duke of Devonshire's architect, James Paine. By 1310 a rope-hauled ferry boat had replaced the last of a series of medieval bridges that crossed the Trent at what was known as Wilden Ferry. Later archaeological investigations in the Hemington Fields quarry revealed that the three wooden bridges were destroyed by floods between 1140 and 1309. During this period the unstable gravel bed of the Trent was affected by a succession of large floods, which meant that the river shifted its course significantly during this time, demolishing the bridges and an adjacent Norman mill weir. The charge to cross Paine's original 1758‚Äì1761 bridge during the years when it was subject to tolls was 2s 6d (12.5p) for carriages. It survived in service until 1947, when the Trent, swollen by a rapid thaw, swept its supports away. The British Army provided a temporary Bailey bridge, which was replaced by the present structure in 1957. Today the pediment of Paine's bridge survives as a preserved structure, with the toll charges engraved into it. =Port= The oldest surviving warehouse in Shardlow, formerly the old Salt warehouse, built in the 1770s. Today owned by the Mansfield Brewery, they completely refurbished and equipped it at their own expense as the Shardlow Heritage Centre Due to the discovery in 1720 of heated flint being able to turn the North Staffordshire reddish-clay into a lustrous white-sheen ware, from the 18th Century volumes of cargo shipped through Shardlow accelerated, supplying product and shipping ware internationally from the Stoke-on-Trent potteries. James Brindley built the Trent and Mersey Canal from 1766 to 1777. With a vision to connect all four of England's main rivers together ‚Äì the Mersey, Trent, Severn and Thames ‚Äì he created the only other comparative canal port to Shardlow in the town of Stourport-on-Severn. Brindley developed his canal through Shardlow in 1770, to join the River Trent at Great Wilne further down stream at the junction with the River Derwent, which was also up to that point navigable. As a result, Shardlow quickly developed as an important UK river port, a transshipment point between the broad river barges and ships, and the canal's narrow boats. Shardlow later became the head office site of the Trent and Mersey Canal. The port outline as exists today was formed by 1816, when the 12 canal basins had been excavated. But the warehouses around them were extensively reconstructed as trade developed, so that by 1820 the larger structures with the sunburst windows which exist today, had replaced the earlier buildings. The wharfs and associated warehouses each had designated functions, which included: coal; timber; iron; cheese; corn; and salt. Other business which developed alongside the port included: boat builders; ropewalks; stables; offices, including the head office site of the Trent and Mersey Canal; plus workers cottages and owner's houses. Two families particularly made their fortunes: the Soresburys with rapid horse-drawn 'fly boats' on the Trent; and the Suttons with their barges and narrow boats. The importance and vitality of the port resulted in the town becoming referred to as \\"Rural Rotterdam\\" and \\"Little Liverpool\\", with the population rising from 200 in 1780 to a peak of 1,306 in 1841. =1840s-1950s= Former warehouses in Shardlow, now used as a boatyard However, the subsequent arrival of the Midland Railway and associated railway branches to the area in the 1840s signalled the beginning of the end; by 1861 the population had fallen to 945, of whom 136 were in the workhouse. By 1886 the port was virtually abandoned, yet the end only came with the formation of the nationalised British Waterways in 1947, which quickly resulted in the removal of the formal designation of Shardlow as a port. In 1816, a large group of parishes from Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire erected a joint workhouse to the west of Shardlow, which had required the UK Parliament to approve the \\"Shardlow and Wilne Poor Relief Act\\". But with an expanding number of poor people to cope with, the Union negotiated from 1834 to expand to 46 parishes encompassing a population of 29,812, ranging in population scale from Hopwell (23) to Castle Donington (3,182). The \\"Shardlow Poor Law Union\\" formally came into existence on 30 March 1837, governed by an elected board of 57 guardians. The building was enlarged by Derby-based architect Henry Isaac Stevens at a cost of ¬£2,800 in 1838‚Äì1839, to increase its capacity to 230. Shardlow and Great Wilne had been included in the parish of Aston-on-Trent until 1838. But with the formation of the poor union, the combined parishes agreed to fund a parish church for the town, resulting in the opening of St James's Church designed by H.I. Stevens, so that in the following year Shardlow became a parish in its own right. In 1905, the workhouse started its conversion to a hospital, with new buildings to its south. Post World War II under the National Health Service it formally became \\"The Grove\\" hospital, which was closed in 2005 and subsequently demolished in 2007. Present Originally Mill No.2 dating from 1780, today it is known as The Clock Warehouse The last grain-carrying narrow boat delivered its cargo to Shardlow in the early 1950s. In 1957 the stable block which had housed over 100 towing horses was demolished, latterly followed by some of the smaller warehouses and buildings over the next twenty years. A campaign led by the newly-formed Trent & Mersey Canal Society resulted in the designation in 1975 of the Shardlow Wharf Conservation Area, which today encompasses over 50 Grade II listed buildings. During the 1970s, the men-only \\"Pavilion Club\\" flourished in the old cricket club. Then uniquely owned and operated by its gay members, it burnt down in the late 1980s. The subsequent insurance payout went into a local trust, which supported LGBT causes in the area for many years. Today, the relatively small village is considered Britain's most complete surviving example of a canal village. Most of the warehouses and other port buildings have been converted to other commercial uses, or as private dwellings.

Raised on a sugar plantation, Figueredo earned his law degree from the University of Madrid in 1844, but did not practice until he settled in Havana in 1856, during which time he contributed pieces of music and articles to the newspaper La Piragua. When his father died, Figueredo returned to Bayamo to administer the family property. He rejected the heavy taxation upon landowners from local authorities representing Spanish interests, and this earned him 14 months of house arrest. During this time, Figueredo composed arduously, home-schooled his children, and secretly conspired to overthrow the Spanish-backed Cuban government. Figueredo and his co-conspirators began to organize in earnest in 1867, and they asked Figueredo to compose something that would serve as \\"our 'Marseillaise'.\\" Figueredo composed the song \\"La Bayamesa\\" and first delivered it before the Comit√© Revolucionario de Bayamo on August 15, 1867. Repeated during the Corpus Christi celebrations in Bayamo of June 1868, \\"La Bayamesa\\" quickly caught the attention of local Spanish authorities. It would be too little, too late, as an army of rebels under the leadership of Figueredo took the town of Bayamo on October 20. However, by January 1869 a Spanish force, 2,000 strong, arrived to take it back, prompting Figueredo to burn all of his property, including his music manuscripts, in a massive bonfire set atop the two pianos in his manor house. For nearly two years, Figueredo and his fellow refugees managed to elude capture, but on August 15, 1870, soldiers discovered Figueredo hiding in a forest. Convicted of treason, he was executed two days later. Weakened and ill from his long months as a fugitive, Figueredo requested a carriage to be taken to his execution, as he was unable to march. The authorities allowed him to ride a donkey instead, prompting a quotation from Figueredo now famous in Cuba: \\"No es el primer redentor que cabalga sobre un asno\\" (\\"I will not have been the first redeemer who has had to ride on an ass\\"). Since its official adoption in 1902, \\"La Bayamesa\\" has served as the National Anthem of the Republic of Cuba. As far as is known, scholars have never investigated other music of Figueredo, as little of it as might still be extant. Pedro Felipe Figueredo, (born 18 February 1818, Bayamo, Cuba ‚Äì 17 August 1870 Santiago de Cuba) mostly known as Perucho was a Cuban poet, musician, and freedom fighter of the 19th century. In the 1860s, he was active in the planning of the Cuban uprising against the Spanish known as the Ten Years' War. He wrote the Cuban national anthem, El Himno de Bayamo, in 1867. He was captured during the war and executed on 17 August 1870. His daughter Candelaria Figueredo became a hero of the uprising by carrying the new independent Cuban flag into battle at Bayamo in 1868.

Greene is noted for having successfully conducted litigation against the Church of Scientology and the Unification Church of the United States. Greene is serving his fourth-term as an elected San Anselmo town council member. He was voted to the position of Mayor in 2010, 2015 and 2019. Litigating against Scientology Greene has represented a number of clients against the Church of Scientology. In Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology of California, he was part of a team that represented former Scientologist Lawrence A. Wollersheim and successfully sued for emotional distress. Wollersheim had been a member of the Church of Scientology for over a decade, leaving in 1979, and sued the church the following year. The court case was heard in 1986. Wollersheim had been a supervisor in Scientology's elite SeaOrg group, and his duties included recruiting celebrities to Scientology. The case resulted in a $2.5 million judgment that grew into an $8.7 million payout due to accumulated interest after over 20 years of litigation. In New York City's Village Voice newspaper in June 2008, Greene commented: \\"If it had been shown in court that the 350 organizations of the church of Scientology were all controlled by [Scientology leader] David Miscavige, it doesn‚Äôt look like a legitimate religion but the authoritative cult that it is. It would have been terrible public relations, and they still would have had to pay the money. And that‚Äôs why they paid the money when they did, to avoid the bad PR.\\" Some of Scientology's highest-ranking members have disagreed with Greene in print interviews: Kurt Weiland, Director of external affairs for the Church of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs, Scientology's vice president of communications and a member of the organization's Board of Directors, has stated \\"We don't react kindly to attempts to extort money from the church, especially if it's done through lies and allegations by people like Ford Greene.\\" Kendrick Moxon, Scientology's lead counsel gathered information on Greene as part of what he termed a \\"simple, standard check\\". Greene also successfully represented client Raul Lopez against the church; Lopez had suffered partial brain damage in an auto accident and turned to Scientology, subsequently donating or 'investing' most of his 1.7 million-dollar accident settlement money to the church. Unification Church, law studies and California State Bar admission Greene joined the Unification Church in late 1974 in an attempt to convince his sister Catherine to renounce her membership in the organization. Unable to do so, he walked out in July 1975.San Francisco Weekly October 5, 2005 From 1976 to 1978, he deprogrammed about 130 members of the Unification Church.Cult Busters , Deutschlandfunk, June 19, 2007 The deprogrammer character in the film Ticket to Heaven was based on his work.Who Is Rev. Moon? 'Returning Lord,' 'Messiah,' Publisher of the Washington Times, AlterNet, March 15, 2008, by John Gorenfeld Greene began studying law at the New College of California Law School in 1978. He was admitted to the State Bar of California in 1983.Calbar.ca.gov Additional successful litigation In Molko v. Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity, Greene represented two former members of the Unification Church, David Molko and Tracy Leal, before the California Supreme Court. (Paul Morantz, an amicus curiae on behalf of the Cult Awareness Network, also briefed and argued the case.) In 1988, the state high court held that religious organizations may be sued for fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress when they use deception to cause candidates for recruitment to unwittingly expose themselves to brainwashing techniques. The members of the Unification Church who recruited Molko had lied by denying any religious connection to their recruitment pitch, and then when he trusted them, brainwashing him. In a legal opinion written by Justice Stanley Mosk regarding tactics religious groups use to attract followers, the court found that any burden on the free exercise of religion was outweighed by the state's interest in protecting against \\"fraudulent induction of unconsenting individuals into an atmosphere of coercive persuasion\\" because many people exposed to brainwashing techniques without their knowledge or consent would develop serious and sometimes irreversible physical and psychiatric disorders, up to and including schizophrenia, self-mutilation, and suicide.Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn. The defendants appealed to the United States Supreme Court which refused to review the decision of the California Supreme Court, and the case was settled out of court. In 1998, in Bertolucci v. Ananda Church of Self Realization, Greene won a $1.625 million jury verdict for fraud, coercion and sexual exploitation of a female devotee. Free speech activism From 2003 to 2005, Greene was involved in a controversy about a changeable 'Freedom' sign with political messages on the side of his San Anselmo law office, facing eastbound traffic on busy Sir Francis Drake Blvd. Greene was vehement regarding his opposition to the policies of President George W. Bush, one example being Greene's recommendation for his readers to \\"defy evil Bushism\\". After San Anselmo police removed his sign in 2003, Greene sued the city. After a new sign ordinance was passed limiting the size of signs to , Greene put up 16 small signs together to form a large one. A court declined to stop this, deciding that the town could only limit the size, not the number of signs. Greene settled the dispute in October 2005 by agreeing to use only half the space for messages, and was reimbursed by the town for nearly a thousand dollars in expenses. Publicly elected service In November 2005, Greene ran for a seat on the San Anselmo Town Council against Ian Roth, but came 300 votes short of being elected. Roth resigned in September 2006. Greene interviewed to be appointed to the Council seat he had nearly won, but former Ross Hospital CEO Judy House was chosen by the Council in a 4‚Äì0 vote. Greene said \\"It was a done deal. I'm not going anywhere. There's an election in a year.\\" Greene was elected to the San Anselmo Town Council in November 2007. \\"There was a compost pile that needed to be turned,\\" Greene said when the election results became known. \\"The government in this town was so embedded, so self-absorbed, that a substantial number of the population didn't like it. That was the issue.\\" Greene was elected by the council to the position of mayor in December, 2010. He was re-elected to the council on November 8, 2011. Greene stated he would \\"continue on the same path, emphasizing open and responsive government and looking at planning and regulatory codes to make them more accessible and friendly to residents of San Anselmo.\\" Greene won a third term on the San Anselmo Town Council on November 3, 2015. He was the only seated councilman to speak against the proposal to turn a San Anselmo park into a flood basin, and a citizen-emplaced ballot measure supported by Greene that was designed to prevent the flood-basin proposal also won, despite opposition by Marin County political figures. Regarding his opponents, Greene said: \\"I‚Äôm very grateful for the intelligence and good judgment of the San Anselmo voters, who were able to see through a very well orchestrated, unified and negative campaign.\\" A few weeks later Greene was voted by the council to his second term as mayor.http://www.townofsananselmo.org/index.aspx?nid=88 On November 5, 2019 Green was again re-elected to the Town Council. He had included in his platform storefront sales of recreational cannabis, to be taxed by San Anselmo. As the sole candidate of four to take a stand against a ballot proposal, Measure M, designed to fund park renovations with a thirty-year parcel tax, Greene was vindicated when the town voters turned down the proposal overwhelmingly. Greene credited his return for a fourth term to his playing fair with his constituents, saying it was ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm straight. I‚Äôm stand-up. I‚Äôm accountable, open, honest and responsive and make the right decisions. Being the only candidate to oppose Measure M is illustrative of that. It‚Äôs sensitivity to what local people want.

The College is headed by the Lord President of the Court of Session, who also holds the title of Lord Justice General in relation to the High Court of Justiciary, and judges of the Court of Session and High Court are titled Senators of the College of Justice. History The College was founded in 1532 by King James V following a bull issued by Pope Clement VII on 15 September 1531. It provided for 10,000 gold ducats to be contributed by the Scottish bishoprics and monastic institutions for the maintenance of its members, one half of whom would be members of the \\"ecclesiastical dignity\\".The 1531 bull stipulated that of the senators \\"\\"; a March 1534 bull of Pope Paul III added \\"\\". The Parliament of Scotland passed an Act on 17 May 1532 authorising the creation of the college with 14 members, half spiritual, half temporal, plus a president and the Lord Chancellor. The college convened for the first time on 27 May 1532, in the royal presence. Supplementing the 14 ordinary lords, who were called Senators, were an indefinite number of supernumerary judges called extraordinary lords. The founding members of the College of Justice were: * The Lord Chancellor, Gavin Dunbar, Archbishop of Glasgow * The Lord President, Alexander Myln, Abbot of Cambuskenneth * Richard Bothwell, Rector of Ashkirk * John Dingwell, Provost of Trinity College * Henry White, Rector of Finevin * William Gibson, Dean of Restalrig * Thomas Hay, Dean of Dunbar * Robert Reid, Abbot of Kinloss * George Ker, Provost of Dunglass * Sir William Scott of Balweary * Sir John Campbell of Lundy * Sir James Colville of Easter Wemyss * Sir Adam Otterburn of Auldhame and Redhall, King's Advocate * Nicholas Crawford of Oxengangs * Francis Bothwell of Edinburgh (brother of Richard) * James Lawson of Edinburgh * Sir James Foulis of Colinton, who was added at the first meeting of the court when the king made him a \\"Lord of the Session\\". The College at its foundation dealt with underdeveloped civil law. It did not dispense justice in criminal matters as that was an area of the law reserved to the King's justice, through the justiciars (hence the High Court of the Justiciary), the Barony Courts and the Commission of Justiciary. The High Court of Justiciary was only incorporated into the College of Justice in 1672. Initially, there was little legal literature. Acts of the Parliament of Scotland and the books of the Old Law as well as Roman Law and Canon law texts were about all to which the pursuer and defender could refer. It was only after the establishment of the court that this situation improved, with judges noting their decisions in . The Treaty of Union 1707 with England preserved the Scottish Legal System.

The foreword is followed by a preface by historian Jean Blain. The substance of the essay consists of three parts and a short conclusion. The book ends with an epilogue by Quebec documentary film director Pierre Perrault. = Part one = The first part (17 pages), is entitled A Country That Must be Made and contains six small chapters advancing the reasons for Quebecers to make the double choice of independence for Quebec and a new economic union with Canada. Chapter I (\\"Belonging\\") treats of the collective personality of Quebecers. Chapter II (The Acceleration of History) discuses the challenge that modernity poses to the preservation of the collective personality of the Quebec people and suggests that the only way to dissipate the danger of the assimilation of its francophone majority is \\"to face up to this trying and thoughtless age and make it accept us as we are\\". Chapter III (The Quiet Revolution) discuses the catch up and progress accomplished by the Quebec nation since the Quiet Revolution. In chapter IV (The Basic Minimums), L√©vesque points out the limitations of the centenary Canadian federal framework (1867‚Äì1967) if Quebec is to enjoy the basic amount of internal autonomy it needs to continue on the way of progress as it has been doing since 1960. In chapter V (The Blind Alley), L√©vesque remarks that the vital minimum for Quebec is a \\"frightening maximum, completely unacceptable\\" for English Canada which needs the central State of Canada \\"for its own security and progress as much as we need our own State of Quebec\\". Chapter VI (The Way of the Future) presents the alternative of Ren√© L√©vesque to what he describes as the blind alley of maintaining or adapting the political status quo. He invites his readers to reject Canadian federalism entirely and proposes a sovereign Quebec (\\"complete liberty in Quebec\\") that would be associated to the rest of Canada as part of a new Canadian Union modelled on the precedents of the European Economic Community, Scandinavia or Benelux. = Part two = The second part (25 pages), entitled A Country that Is \\"Feasible\\", is made of two chapters describing the \\"Option for Quebec\\" in more details. This part is introduced by a short text of Bernard Chenot (From Politics to Economics) treating of the economic organization of the State. The first chapter (The Association) presents the association that Quebec would propose to Canada, that is to say a monetary union and a common market. The monetary union would be carried out on the basis of an accord renewable every five years. The second chapter (The Transition Period) deals with the question of the steps Quebec would have to go through to reach the status of a sovereign State. It discuses the financing of the state and the means of retaining investments in Quebec. = Part three = The third part (68 pages) consists of seven appendices which serve as documentation of the first two parts of the essay. Appendix 1 (Some Varieties of Special Status) cites authors who wrote on the special status which Quebec would in their opinion need to ensure the future of its development and the conservation of its particular collective personality within the framework of a reformed Canadian federalism. The works cited are Equality or Independence by Daniel Johnson, Sr. (published in 1965), Le Qu√©bec dans le Canada de demain (published in 1967) and comprising texts by Marcel Faribault, Jean-Guy Cardinal and Claude Ryan, as well as an excerpt of the report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of the Quebec Liberal Federation presided by Paul G√©rin-Lajoie and prepared for the Congress of October 1967. Appendix 2 (Neo-Centralization) contains the point of view of senator Maurice Lamontagne, who, in two articles published in Le Devoir on September 23 and 25, 1967, rejected the special status thesis of Claude Ryan and proposed a \\"cooperative federalism\\" in which Ren√© L√©vesque saw nothing but a way to re-centralize powers in Ottawa. Appendix 3 (Qu√©bec-Canada: A Blind Alley) reproduces a talk given by economist and former Premier of Quebec Jacques Parizeau in Banff, Alberta, on October 17, 1967. Appendix 4 (The Snare of Biculturalism) gives the statistics available at the time concerning the assimilation of out-of-Quebec francophone minorities and argues that it is not possible to reanimate the cultural life of these minority groups simply by offering them the status the Anglophone \\"minority\\" of Quebec enjoys, as proposed by the report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. The report, in addition, does not propose an answer to the question of the integration of immigrants to Quebec society. The appendix reproduces a text by Ren√© L√©vesque dated December 3, 1967, and an excerpt of an essay by Richard Ar√®s published in the November issue of the Relations review. Appendix 5 (Association of Sovereign States) is a dossier on the functioning of the European Union and Scandinavia. The appendix includes an excerpt of the Treaty of Rome of March 25, 1957, which is at the origin of the Common Market of Europe. Appendix 6 (Other Testimony) reprints two texts: Sovereignty, Condition of Salvation by Jean-Marc L√©ger (writer) (not to be confused with the pollster of the same name), initially published in Le Devoir on October 23, 24 and 25, 1967, and Quebec's Independence: Condition of Quebec's Salvation, Guarantee of Peace for Canada by Doris Lussier, excerpted from an interview he gave to √âchos-Vedettes on November 11, 1967. Appendix 7 (Operation Panic) analyzes the flight of capital from Quebec which made the news soon after October 18, 1967, which is to say just after Ren√© L√©vesque released the manifesto that forms the first part of An Option for Quebec.  Reception  More than 50,000 copies of Option Qu√©bec, the French-language original, were sold in the weeks after its release.Graham Fraser, p. 366.Andr√© Bernard, p. 23. Even before its publication, the Liberal Party of Quebec gave a flat refusal to the constitutional option promoted by Ren√© L√©vesque in his essay. The party instead resolved on a special status for Quebec in a reformed Canadian federation, as recommended in Paul G√©rin-Lajoie's October 1967 report. The Union Nationale, as well as the main federal political parties of Canada equally opposed it.  Editions  The first French-language edition was published in 1968 at √âditions de l'Homme in Montreal and Laffont in Paris. The work was reprinted in Montreal in 1988, preceded by an essay of political scientist Andr√© Bernard entitled Option Qu√©bec 1968-1988. Another edition was published in 1997 by TYPO, preceded by an updated version of Andr√© Bernard's essay. In English translation, the book was published by McClelland & Stewart in 1968 and again in 1977, after the election of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois.\\"An Option for Quebec\\", in Google Books, retrieved June 28, 2010  Notes   References  * Graham Fraser (2001).

It is the tallest all-steel residential building in the United Kingdom, and one of the most expensive addresses in Manchester. The building was completed in 2002, and is situated at the north end of Deansgate close to Manchester Cathedral. Background The building, characterised by a distinctive glass frontage and sloping roof, was built as part of the major redevelopment project that took place in the years following the 1996 IRA bombing. No. 1 was designed by SimpsonHaugh and Partners, with engineers Martin Stockley Associates (now Stockley). Simpson's designs now dominate either end of Deansgate, with No. 1 and the equally imposing Beetham Tower forming prominent glass 'bookends' to the thoroughfare. Design and construction The 60 m high building consists of 14 floors which provide 84 apartments, including eight penthouses. The apartments are above a retail level, 16 metres high, and are supported by raking steel tubular columns in a manner reminiscent of Rotterdam's De Brug building. The raking columns allow the small close centred columns of the apartments to be channelled into large, widely spaced, columns of the retail section. This is due to apartments tolerating many closely spaced columns whereas retail areas cannot.Martin Stockley Associates (2006). The Reluctant Engineer and other Manchester stories: Martin Stockley Associates. The comparatively lightweight structure is principally constructed of steel, the skeleton balanced by precise weight ratios to ensure its stability. The external treatment is juxtaposed to the concrete Brutalist architecture of the late 20th century. On the upper floors an almost cubist form of architecture is suggested. The 20th-century appearance is further offset by louvred glass sloping walls. Critics of the design have suggested the building has the air of a municipal, public, civil building. This same charge, though, could be levelled at any 18th-century Palladian building. Four penthouse suites were sold for ¬£1.5m each in 2002, the most expensive residences sold in Manchester at the time.

Benefits include pest control, pollination, and maintenance of soil health. The opposite of beneficial organisms are pests, which are organisms deemed detrimental to the growing process. There are many different types of beneficial organisms as well as beneficial microorganisms. Also, microorganisms have things like salt and sugar in them. Beneficial organisms include but are not limited to: Birds, Bears, Nematodes, Insects, Arachnids, and fungi. The ways that birds and bears are considered beneficial is mainly because they consume seeds from plant and spread them through feces. Birds also prey on certain insects that eat plants and hinder them from growing these insects are known as non beneficial organisms. Nematodes are considered beneficial because they will help compost and provide nutrients for the soil the plants are growing in. Insects and arachnids help the growing process because they prey on non beneficial organisms that consume plants for food. Fungi help the growing process by using long threads of mycelium that can reach very long distances away from the tree or plant and bring water and nutrients back to the tree or plant roots. Beneficial or pest The distinction between beneficial and pest is arbitrary, subjectively determined by examining the effect of a particular organism in a specific growing situation. There are many different types of beneficial organisms as well as beneficial microorganisms. Beneficial organisms include but are not limited to: Birds, Bears, Nematodes, Insects, Arachnids, and fungi. The ways that birds and bears are considered beneficial is mainly because they consume seeds from plant and spread them through feces. Birds also prey on certain insects that eat plants and hinder them from growing these insects are known as non beneficial organisms. Nematodes are considered beneficial because they will help compost and provide nutrients for the soil the plants are growing in. Insects and arachnids help the growing process because they prey on non beneficial organisms that consume plants for food. Fungi help the growing process by using long threads of mycelium that can reach very long distances away from the tree or plant and bring water and nutrients back to the tree or plant roots. With beneficial organisms there is a flip side to these helpful organisms and that's the non beneficial organisms. These organisms hinder or stop the growing process or prey on beneficial organisms. Examples of these are Aphids, Assassin Bugs, and Japanese beetles. Aphids are attracted by pollen which is bad for plants because the aphids feed on the plants after they are located from spreading their pollen. Assassin Bugs are non beneficial because they feed on many beneficial insects by stabbing them with a horn on their head repeated times living up to its name \\"Assassin bug\\". Japanese beetles are especially a pest to gardeners and plants because the larva feed on the stems and roots while full grown beetles feed on leaves and flowers killing the plant. =Insects= Beneficial insects can include predators (such as ladybugs) of pest insects, and pollinators (such as bees, which are an integral part of the growth cycle of many crops). Increasingly certain species of insects are managed and used to intervene where natural pollination or biological control is insufficient, usually due to human disturbance of the balance of established ecosystems. =Nematodes= Certain microscopic nematodes (worms) are beneficial in destroying and controlling populations of larvae that are damaging or deadly to crops and other plants. They are commonly used in organic gardening for their ability to kill various kinds of harmful larvae (fungus gnats, flea larvae, spidermites, weevils, grubs, rootworms, cutworms, etc.) =Animals= Birds and other animals may, by their actions, improve conditions in various growing situations, and in such cases are also beneficials. Birds assist in the spread of seeds by ingesting the fruits and berries of plants, then depositing the seeds in their droppings. Other animals, such as raccoons, bears, etc. provide similar benefits. =Plants= Plants that perform positive functions can also be considered beneficials (companion planting is one technique based on principle of beneficial plants). Issues In agriculture, controversy surrounds the concept of beneficial insects. Much of this has to do with the effect of agrichemicals, like insecticides, herbicides and large quantities of synthetic fertilizers, on what are considered beneficials. Citing the reduction or elimination of various organisms as a side effect of agrichemical-based farming, some argue that critical damage is being done to various ecosystems, to the point where conventional agriculture is unsustainable in long term societal planning. For example, if bee populations are continued to be reduced by insecticides aimed at other pests, pollination will be further inhibited and crops don't fruit. If soil microorganisms are killed off, natural soil regeneration is inhibited, and reliance on mechanical and chemical inputs to keep the soil viable is increased, along with the fuel required to power these machines. The longer term impact of these conditions has not yet been determined. Commercial ventures currently exist to provide pollinators and biological pest control, such as beekeepers bringing their hives cross-country to any number of farms in spring to pollinate their crops, or purchasing ladybirds from garden centers in small containers.

Fritz von Petersdorf, assist and German military attach√© in Tokyo, received some information from Japanese Intelligence Services, in accord with Axis Powers agreements. Such information was related to military strength, transportation, reserves, troop dispositions, and movements of Soviet Far East units sent to the West European front (Barbarossa Operation), as well as data concerning the war industry in the Soviet Union. This report was supported by Admiral Wenneker, the German naval attach√©, under German official Ambassador Eugen Ott in Tokyo. *Hiroshi Akita ‚Äì Chief of German Section of Japanese Military Intelligence. *Imperial Japanese Army ‚Äì sent a secret mission to Germany via Siberia, leaving Tokyo on March 1, 1943. This operation was led by Major General Okamoto, who had been chief of the Second Bureau (Intelligence) at the time of the outbreak of the Pacific War. His staff consisted of Colonel Kotani, Navy officer Captain Onoda, and Mr.Yosano, Foreign Office chancellor. Objectives of the mission were to investigate German ability to carry on the war; and to clarify Japan's real situation to the Germans. A third objective (concerning the arrangement of a separate peace between Germany and the Soviet Union) was eliminated just prior to the mission's departure. The Okamoto Mission reported its findings in a cable dated July 5. Many reservations were attached to the report, which concluded that German national power was lower than had been foreseen by the mission before it left Japan. Germany would accordingly encounter many difficulties in emerging triumphant without first overcoming the critical problems that were fast approaching: shortage of manpower, lowering of industrial war potential, insufficiency of liquid fuel, etc. *On October 15, 1943, IGHQ incorporated its Second Bureau's 16th Section (German and Italian Intelligence) into the 5th Section (U.S.S.R. intelligence), just as the German Army was failing in its early summer offensive against Orel. The Soviet Army, on the other hand, had seized the operational initiative. The feeling of the Imperial Japanese Army High Command was somewhat inclined to pessimism vis-a vis Germany. The Imperial Japanese Army committed a great error by placing excessive confidence in Germany. After the Allies had established a Second Front in northern France (June 1944) and a recent attempt on Hitler's (July 20 plot, 1944) - only then did the Japanese Army intelligence services and High Command conclude that Germany possessed scant prospects for victory. *Patrick Heenan (July 1910-February 13, 1942) was a Captain in the British Indian Army, who was convicted of treason, after spying for Japanese military intelligence during the Malayan campaign of World War II.Peter Elphick, 2001, \\"Cover-ups and the Singapore Traitor Affair\\".

Small doses taken internally cause diarrhea. Externally, the oil can cause irritation and swelling. Croton oil is used in Phenol-croton oil chemical peels, due to its caustic exfoliating effects it has on the skin. Used in conjunction with phenol solutions, it results in an intense reaction which leads to initial skin sloughing. Since croton oil is very irritating and painful, it is used in laboratory animals to study how pain works, pain-relieving and anti- inflammatory drugs, and immunology. Because croton tiglium oil is cocarcinogenic, it has been used in tumor research. Croton oil is the source of the chemical compound phorbol. Tumor promotion activity was traced to phorbol esters present in croton oil. Pure phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate which is found in croton oil is now used widely in laboratory research to induce tumor development. History During World War II, the United States Navy added a small amount of croton oil to the neutral grain spirits which powered torpedoes. The oil was intended to prevent sailors from drinking the alcohol fuel. Sailors devised crude stills to separate the alcohol from the croton oil, as alcohol evaporates at a lower temperature than croton oil.Ostlund, Mike. Find 'em, chase 'em, sink 'em, Globe Pequot, 2006, p. 88. Norwegian partisans, ordered by the Quisling government to turn over a catch of sardines to the Nazi German government for shipment to Saint-Nazaire (a U-boat base of operations) arranged with the British for a large shipment of croton oil to poison the sardines, whose fishy taste was expected to conceal the tampering. Croton oil is also more effective for production of biodiesel than Jatropha. One can obtain 0.35 litres of biofuel from a kilo of croton nuts. In \\"The Bulletin\\" (9 Dowry Square, Hot Wells, May 29, 1845) by the Reverend Richard Harris Barham, a medically inspired poem to relieve the anxiety of a very dear friend, and written a month before Barham's death on June 17, 1845, the attending doctor to his patient advises amongst other treatments for a sore throat that is producing barely a sound: \\"... Please put out your tongue again! / Now the blister! / Ay, the blister! / Let your son, or else his sister, / Warm it well, then clap it here, sir, / All across from ear to ear, sir; / That suffices, / When it rises, / Snip it, sir, and then your throat on / Rub a little oil of Croton: / Never mind a little pain! / Please put out your tongue again! ...\\" The patient was Barham, who had accidentally swallowed a piece of pear core that got into his windpipe on October 28, 1844. Despite the \\"professional\\" advice and the very painful and \\"highest quality\\" treatments of the time being given freely to him by Doctors Roberts and Scott, and the eminent surgeon Mr. Coulson, for \\"violent vomiting\\", \\"inflamed throat\\", and then catching \\"a cold\\" in April 1845, Barham died. In popular culture In John Steinbeck's novel East of Eden, Kate uses it to murder Faye and inherit her whorehouse. Faye is poisoned with a combination of first strychnine (unsuccessfully) and then two drops of croton oil, on a salad of home-canned beans, mimicking accidental botulism poisoning. To allay suspicion, Kate also poisons herself with c√°scara sagrada which gives the same cathartic symptoms, but to a non-fatal degree. Steinbeck also alludes to croton oil in In Dubious Battle, chapter 7. In El Dorado starring John Wayne, cayenne pepper, hot mustard, ipecac, asafoetida, croton oil, and gunpowder are the ingredients in an emetic administered to the drunken sheriff J. P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum) to sober him up and prevent him from drinking for the foreseeable future. Arthur Hunnicutt's character Bull expresses great surprise that the extract's use will be risked. In They Rode West starring Robert Francis, the use of croton oil by an Army post's previous physician is used to explain why he was disliked by the troops. In Bernard Cornwell's novel Copperhead, the second book of The Starbuck Chronicles, Nate Starbuck is force fed croton oil over a number of days whilst being interrogated by the Confederate authorities after he was accused of being involved in the attempted passing of sensitive military information to the Union.

He served as a Member of Parliament for Portsmouth from 1776 to 1778. Origins Maurice was born on 4 May 1726 at Barsham Rectory in Suffolk, the second of the four children of Rev.

Maurice's sister Catherine Suckling (1725‚Äì95) was the wife of Rev. Edmund Nelson of Burnham Thorpe in Norfolk, and mother of the great Admiral Horatio Nelson (1758‚Äì1805). Maurice's nephew, Lieutenant Maurice William Suckling (1761‚Äì1820), also served under him with Horatio Nelson. Career His father died in 1730 and the family relocated to Beccles. At the age of thirteen Maurice left home for Sheerness where on 25 November 1739 he enlisted as an ordinary seaman aboard the elderly 54-gun warship . Suckling was the commander of Dreadnought in action in the Battle of Cap-Fran√ßais off Saint-Domingue on 21 October 1757, during the Seven Years War. It was Suckling who was responsible for the early training of his nephew Horatio Nelson. Young Nelson was entered on the books of the newly commissioned Raisonnable, commanded by Suckling, and joined the crew several months later, in early 1771. Suckling was transferred to the Nore guardship and arranged for his nephew to sail to the West Indies in a Hibbert, Purrier and Horton merchantman, the Mary Ann captained by John Rathbone, gaining experience of seamanship and life at sea (he sailed from Medway, Kent, on 25 July 1771 sailing to Jamaica and Tobago, returning to Plymouth on 7 July 1772). Suckling also used his influence to have Nelson appointed to the for a 1773 expedition in search of the Northwest Passage. Suckling became Comptroller of the Navy in 1775 and was able to speed Nelson's career. He continued to use his influence on Nelson's behalf until his death in 1778. Suckling had a brief career in Parliament, presumably with Admiralty support. He was returned unopposed to represent Portsmouth on 18 May 1776, replacing Sir Edward Hawke who had been created Baron Hawke and called to the House of Lords, but there is no record of Suckling having voted or spoken.

Studies of genetic association aim to test whether single-locus alleles or genotype frequencies (or more generally, multilocus haplotype frequencies) differ between two groups of individuals (usually diseased subjects and healthy controls). Genetic association studies today are based on the principle that genotypes can be compared \\"directly\\", i.e. with the sequences of the actual genomes or exomes via whole genome sequencing or whole exome sequencing. Before 2010, DNA sequencing methods were used. Description Genetic association can be between phenotypes, such as visible characteristics such as flower colour or height, between a phenotype and a genetic polymorphism, such as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), or between two genetic polymorphisms. Association between genetic polymorphisms occurs when there is non-random association of their alleles as a result of their proximity on the same chromosome; this is known as genetic linkage. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is a term used in the study of population genetics for the non-random association of alleles at two or more loci, not necessarily on the same chromosome. It is not the same as linkage, which is the phenomenon whereby two or more loci on a chromosome have reduced recombination between them because of their physical proximity to each other. LD describes a situation in which some combinations of alleles or genetic markers occur more or less frequently in a population than would be expected from a random formation of haplotypes from alleles based on their frequencies. Genetic association studies are performed to determine whether a genetic variant is associated with a disease or trait: if association is present, a particular allele, genotype or haplotype of a polymorphism or polymorphisms will be seen more often than expected by chance in an individual carrying the trait. Thus, a person carrying one or two copies of a high-risk variant is at increased risk of developing the associated disease or having the associated trait. Studies =Case-control designs= Case control studies are a classical epidemiological tool. Case-control studies use subjects who already have a disease, trait or other condition and determine if there are characteristics of these patients that differ from those who do not have the disease or trait. In genetic case-control studies, the frequency of alleles or genotypes is compared between the cases and controls. The cases will have been diagnosed with the disease under study, or have the trait under test; the controls, who are either known to be unaffected, or who have been randomly selected from the population. A difference in the frequency of an allele or genotype of the polymorphism under test between the two groups indicates that the genetic marker may increase risk of the disease or likelihood of the trait, or be in linkage disequilibrium with a polymorphism which does. Haplotypes can also show association with a disease or trait. One of the earliest successes in this field was finding a single base mutation in the non-coding region of the APOC3 gene (apolipoprotein C3 gene) that associated with higher risks of hypertriglyceridemia and atherosclerosis using a case-control design. One problem with the case-control design is that genotype and haplotype frequencies vary between ethnic or geographic populations. If the case and control populations are not well matched for ethnicity or geographic origin then false positive association can occur because of the confounding effects of population stratification. =Family based designs= Family based association designs aim to avoid the potential confounding effects of population stratification by using the parents or unaffected siblings as controls for the case (the affected offspring/sibling). Two similar tests are most commonly used, the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) and haploid- relative-risk (HRR). Both measure association of genetic markers in nuclear families by transmission from parent to offspring. If an allele increases the risk of having a disease then that allele is expected to be transmitted from parent to offspring more often in populations with the disease. =Quantitative trait association= A quantitative trait (see quantitative trait locus) is a measurable trait that shows continuous variation, such as height or weight. Quantitative traits often have a 'normal' distribution in the population. In addition to the case control design, quantitative trait association can also be performed using an unrelated population sample or family trios in which the quantitative trait is measured in the offspring.

The book is considered an important work about art. Commentators have compared Bachelard's views to those of the philosopher Martin Heidegger. Summary Bachelard applies the method of phenomenology to architecture, basing his analysis not on purported origins (as was the trend in Enlightenment thinking about architecture) but on lived experience in architectural places and their contexts in nature. He focuses especially on the personal, emotional response to buildings both in life and in literary works, both in prose and in poetry. He is thus led to consider spatial types such as the attic, the cellar, drawers and the like. Bachelard implicitly urges architects to base their work on the experiences it will engender rather than on abstract rationales that may or may not affect viewers and users of architecture. Bachelard also discusses psychoanalysis and the work of the psychiatrist Carl Jung. Comparing the psychoanalytic and phenomenological approaches to his subject matter, he sees merit in both, but finds the phenomenological approach preferable. Publication history The Poetics of Space was first published by Presses Universitaires de France in 1958. In 1964, the Orion Press, Inc. published the book, with a foreword by the philosopher √âtienne Gilson, in an English translation by the writer Maria Jolas. Beacon Press republished the work in English in 1969. In 1994, it republished it in a new edition with an added foreword by the historian John R. Stilgoe. In 2014, Penguin Books published an edition with a foreword by the novelist Mark Z. Danielewski and an introduction by the philosopher Richard Kearney. Reception The Poetics of Space has influenced the philosophers Paul Ric≈ìur and Edward S. Casey, and the critic Camille Paglia. Ric≈ìur was influenced by Bachelard's understanding of the imagination. Casey identified The Poetics of Space as an influence on his work Getting Back into Place (1993). He wrote that Bachelard shared Heidegger's \\"emphasis on the importance of dwelling places.\\" However, he added that neither Heidegger nor Bachelard \\"adequately assessed the role of the human body in the experience of significant places.\\" Paglia identified The Poetics of Space as an influence on her work of literary criticism Sexual Personae (1990). She has commented of Bachelard's \\"dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method\\" that it \\"seemed to me ideal for art\\", and described Bachelard as \\"the last modern French writer I took seriously.\\" Joan Ockman gave The Poetics of Space a positive review in Harvard Design Magazine. She compared Bachelard's views to Heidegger's, and wrote that, alongside works such as Heidegger's Being and Time (1927) and his essay \\"Building Dwelling Thinking\\", The Poetics of Space was a key text for the architect Christian Norberg-Schulz. She also compared Bachelard's views on epistemology to those of the philosopher Thomas Kuhn and described him as an influence on the philosopher Michel Foucault, finding it apparent in Foucault's The Archaeology of Knowledge (1969). Danielewski compared The Poetics of Space to the critic Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Influence (1973), the essayist Lewis Hyde's The Gift: Imagination and the Erotic Life of Property (1983), Steve Erickson's novel Days Between Stations (1985), and Thomas Pynchon's novel Against the Day (2003). Other authors who have praised The Poetics of Space include Gilson, Stilgoe, Kearney, and the philosopher Gary Gutting. Gilson credited Bachelard with making \\"one of the major modern contributions to the philosophy of art\\". Stilgoe praised his discussion of \\"the meaning of domestic space\\". Kearney described The Poetics of Space as \\"the most concise and consummate expression of Bachelard's philosophy of imagination.\\" Gutting credited Bachelard with subtly explaining the meaning of archetypal images.

Best known for his work as a character actor, he appeared in over 150 film and television productions.  Early life  Salmi was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Finnish immigrant parents. He attended Haaren High School in Manhattan. Following a stint in the United States Army during World War II, Salmi took up acting as a career, studying method acting at the Actors Studio in Manhattan with Lee Strasberg.  Career  In 1955, Salmi starred as Bo Decker in the play Bus Stop on Broadway, and also performed in the touring production of the play. His performance was praised by critics and Salmi was offered the chance to reprise the role in the film Bus Stop (1956) starring Marilyn Monroe. Salmi turned down the offer because he did not enjoy film work. (Don Murray was later cast as Bo and earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance.) Salmi turned down several other offers to make films before he finally accepted a role as Smerdjakov in the film The Brothers Karamazov (1958), with Yul Brynner, Lee J. Cobb, William Shatner, and Richard Basehart. Salmi's next film was The Bravados (1958), in which he played one of the villains who is hunted down by hero Gregory Peck. The National Board of Review presented Salmi with the NBR Award for Best Supporting Actor for his work in both of these films. Despite his numerous appearances in the medium, Salmi shared the opinion of many Actors Studio alumni that roles in film and television were \\"inferior\\" to stage work. One of his first television appearances was in the live, televised adaptation of the novel Bang the Drum Slowly (1956), featured on the anthology series The United States Steel Hour opposite Paul Newman and George Peppard. He also had several memorable roles on CBS's The Twilight Zone, including \\"Of Late I Think of Cliffordville\\", \\"A Quality of Mercy\\", and \\"Execution\\". In 1963, he portrayed John Day and Rivers in the episode \\"Incident of the Pale Rider\\" on the CBS series Rawhide. In 1964‚Äì65, he appeared with Fess Parker as \\"Yadkin\\" in the first season of the Daniel Boone TV series. He later appeared twice as the incorrigible pirate \\"Alonzo P. Tucker\\" on Lost in Space. As well as a 1966 episisode titled Death Watch, as a bounty hunter, he appeared in a 1967 episode of Gunsmoke as a killer who comes to an ironic end. For that performance, Salmi was awarded a Western Heritage Award. Salmi also had guest starring roles in numerous television series including The Virginian, Have Gun ‚Äî Will Travel, Naked City, The Investigators, Combat!, Stoney Burke, Bonanza, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, Redigo, The Big Valley, Twelve O'clock High, The Legend of Jesse James, Custer, The Eleventh Hour, Hawaii Five O, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Road West, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, Route 66, Lost in Space, \\"That Girl\\", Land of the Giants, The Fugitive, Night Gallery, Kung Fu, The A-Team, and Knight Rider, as well as TV miniseries such as Once an Eagle and 79 Park Avenue. From 1974 to 1976, Salmi co-starred in the NBC legal drama Petrocelli as local investigator Pete Ritter. A high point of Salmi's career came in 1968, when he was cast in the Arthur Miller play The Price. He played the lead on Broadway and in London. Salmi's film career included roles in The Unforgiven (1960), The Outrage (1964), Lawman (1971), Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971), Viva Knievel! (1977), Empire of the Ants (1977), Love and Bullets (1979), Caddyshack (1980), and the Robert Redford prison film Brubaker (1980). He played Greil in Dragonslayer (1981), Geraldine Page's husband in I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can (1982), and the hard drinking but loving father of character Diana Lawson in Hard to Hold (1984). His final role in a theatrical film was in Breaking In (1989), starring Burt Reynolds.  Personal life  Salmi met actress Peggy Ann Garner while the two were performing in the National Company touring production of Bus Stop in 1955. They were married on May 18, 1956, in New York City. Their only child, Catherine Ann \\"Cas\\" Salmi, was born on March 30, 1957; Catherine died in 1995 of heart disease at the age of 38. Salmi and Garner separated in 1961 and divorced on March 13, 1963. Salmi married Roberta Pollock Taper in 1964. The couple had two daughters, Elizabeth and Jennifer. The family moved from Los Angeles to Spokane, Washington in 1983, where Salmi went into semi-retirement, only occasionally taking acting roles. He later taught acting and appeared in regional theater. In early February 1990, Albert and Roberta Salmi separated. He moved into their Idaho condominium, while Roberta Salmi remained in the family home. She filed for divorce on February 6, 1990. According to court documents, Roberta Salmi claimed that her husband was an alcoholic who physically abused her when he drank. She also claimed that Salmi threatened her on several occasions and she was fearful that he might kill her. Roberta Salmi later took out a restraining order against her husband. In response to her claims in the court documents, Salmi denied physically abusing Roberta and blamed their split on her emotional issues. However, on April 22, 1990, he fatally shot her at her home.  Death  On April 23, 1990, Salmi and his estranged wife Roberta were found dead in their Spokane, Washington home by a friend who stopped by to check on her. According to newspaper accounts, Salmi fatally shot his estranged wife in the kitchen of her home on the morning of April 22. Salmi then shot himself later that day in the den. While the police reports state that Roberta's death happened on Sunday morning (April 22), the coroner could not determine when Albert's death occurred. On April 26, 1990, three days later, Salmi's funeral was held at the Hennessey-Smith Funeral Home, after which he was cremated and placed in a niche at Greenwood Memorial Terrace cemetery in Spokane.

At one point, the network had as many as 90 blogs, although the vast majority of its traffic could be attributed to a smaller number of breakout titles, as was typical of most large-scale successful blog networks of the mid-2000s. Popular blogs included: Engadget, Autoblog, TUAW, Joystiq, Luxist, Slashfood, Cinematical, TV Squad, Download Squad, Blogging Baby, Gadling, AdJab, and Blogging Stocks. Today, Engadget and Autoblog are the only remaining brands from the company, now existing as part of Verizon Media division. History The company was founded in September 2003 by Jason Calacanis and Brian Alvey, in the wake of Calacanis' Silicon Alley Reporter magazine, with backing from investor Mark Cuban. By early 2004, Weblogs, Inc. and Gawker Media were establishing the two most notable templates for networked blog empires. Initially, Weblogs, Inc. consisted of a few dozen blogs, all residing as subdomains of weblogsinc.com. The exception was Engadget, a stand-alone site covering new technology in blog format. Engadget was co-founded by Peter Rojas, the former editor of Gizmodo in the Gawker Media network. Eventually a plethora of independent brands were established, including 26 stand-alone sites and over 50 sub-blogs. A few of the company principals also maintained personal blogs on the network, including Mark Cuban. Weblogs Inc was sold to AOL for a reported $25 million in October 2005. The move came as AOL was preparing to become an independent division within Time Warner. Weblogs Inc continued to operate independently from AOL's other content websites for many years, until AOL began phasing out the Weblogs Inc branding in favor of its own, consolidating to a few of the strongest titles, and integrating more closely with its namesake media division, which included AOL News, AOL Autos, AOL Tech, etc. The emphasis on AOL branding was increased following the spin- off of AOL from Time Warner in 2009. Up until mid-2010, Weblogs Inc branding remained subtly alongside AOL's, on titles like Engadget and Autoblog, but in late 2010 the name was dropped and the official website was redirected to AOL.com, approximately coinciding with a major redesign of AOL branded properties. Around the same time, AOL also acquired tech industry blog TechCrunch. At this time, AOL had less than a dozen remaining blog brands. Following AOL's $315 million acquisition of The Huffington Post in February 2011, the former Weblogs Inc blogs, along with TechCrunch and many of AOL's other content brands, were reorganized under a new division called the \\"Huffington Post Media Group\\". Under the arrangement, the Huffington Post editorial team took responsibility for editorial oversight of AOL's other blogs and news sites. Months after the acquisition, AOL further consolidated its total count of content websites to just 20 brands, of which Engadget, Autoblog, Joystiq, and TUAW were the only remaining former Weblogs Inc titles. The Huffington Post Media Group branding was never used in any significant public-facing capacity, but the Huffington editorial team was put firmly in control of AOL's news websites. This led to numerous controversies over editorial direction, including the departure of TechCrunch editor and founder Michael Arrington. Joystiq and TUAW were shut down and folded into Engadget in February 2015. Around the same time, AOL Autos and AOL Tech were shut down and redirected to Autoblog and Engadget, respectively. In 2015, AOL was acquired by Verizon. In 2017, AOL's content business, along with that of Yahoo Inc, which was also acquired by Verizon, were combined into a new online media subsidiary called Oath Inc. As of 2018, Engadget and Autoblog are the only remaining former Weblogs Inc titles, with TechCrunch and HuffPost rounding out Oath Inc's content/news properties.

By 2006, it was one of the most popular on the internet. TV Squad was originally conceptualized to allow any Weblogs, Inc. blogger to write about the television shows they watch. Eventually, a core group of bloggers for the site was realized, with several other Weblogs, Inc. bloggers contributing on an irregular basis. TV Squad had about 20 regularly contributing bloggers. Writers include Adam Finley, Keith McDuffee, Bob Sassone, Jay Black, Wil Wheaton and Paul Goebel, and the site's main television critic is former Chicago Tribune critic Maureen Ryan, who came to the site in 2010. During the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike, while some industry blogs stopped or wrote articles in support of the strike, TV Squad continued to publish material normally. TV Squad operated as separate, independent site until 2011, when AOL merged TV Squad with AOL. This meant all of the old TV Squad content can now be found on AOL TV. Originally, if a person went to TVSquad.com, it automatically redirected them to AOLTV.com.Faith Merino, AOL relaunches AOL TV, TV Squad is no more, Vator News, (May 26, 2011) = The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) = right TUAW covers tips, reviews, news, analysis, and opinion on everything Apple.

Plant milks are vegan beverages consumed as plant-based alternatives to dairy milk, and often provide a creamy mouthfeel. For commerce, plant-based liquids are typically packaged in containers similar and competitive to those used for animal lactations, but cannot be labeled as \\"milk\\" within the European Union. In 2018, among the roughly 20 plants used to manufacture plant milk, almond, soy, and coconut were the highest-selling plant milks worldwide. The global plant milk market was estimated at 16 billion in 2018. Plant-based beverages have been consumed for centuries, with the term \\"milk-like plant juices\\" used since the 13th century. Across various cultures, plant milk has been both a traditional beverage and a flavourful ingredient in sweet and savory dishes, such as the use of coconut milk in curries. Plant milks are also used to make \\"ice cream\\", plant cream, vegan cheese, and \\"yogurt\\", such as soy yogurt. A 2018 study found that 54% of U.S. consumers \\"would like to eat more plant-based foods and beverages\\". History Horchata, a beverage originally made in North Africa from soaked, ground, and sweetened tiger nuts, spread to Iberia (now Spain) before the year 1000. In English, the word \\"milk\\" has been used to refer to \\"milk-like plant juices\\" since 1200 AD. Recipes from the 13th-century Levant exist which describe the first plant milk: almond milk. Soy was a plant milk used in China during the 14th century. In Medieval England, almond milk was used in dishes such as ris alkere (a type of rice pudding) and appears in the recipe collection, The Forme of Cury. Coconut milk (and coconut cream) are traditional ingredients in many cuisines such as in South and Southeast Asia, and are often used in curries.Powell V. A brief history of plant milks. Vegan Food & Living. Accessed 11/30/2019 Plant milks may be regarded as milk substitutes in Western countries, but have traditionally been consumed in other parts of the world, especially ones where there are higher rates of lactose intolerance (see especially lactose intolerance: epidemiology section). Types Common plant milks are almond milk, coconut milk, rice milk, and soy milk. Other plant milks include hemp milk, oat milk, pea milk, and peanut milk. Plant milks can be made from: *Grains: barley, fonio, maize, millet, oat, rice, rye, sorghum, teff, triticale, spelt, wheat *Pseudocereals: amaranth, buckwheat, quinoa *Legumes: lupin, pea, peanut, soy *Nuts: almond, brazil, cashew, hazelnut, macadamia, pecan, pistachio, walnut *Seeds: chia seed, flax seed, hemp seed, pumpkin seed, sesame seed, sunflower seed *Other: coconut (fruit; drupe), potato (tuber), tiger nut (tuber) A blend is a plant milk created by mixing two or more types together. Common examples of blends are almond-coconut milk and almond-cashew milk. Pacific Foods' 7 Grain plant milk consists of oat, rice, triticale, wheat, barley, spelt, and millet. Other traditional plant milk recipes include: *Kunu, a Nigerian beverage made from sprouted millet, sorghum, or maize *Sikhye, a traditional sweet Korean rice beverage *Amazake, a Japanese rice milk Manufacturing Although there are variations in the manufacturing of plant milks according to the starting plant material, as an example, the general technique for soy milk involves several steps, including: * cleaning, soaking and dehulling the beans * grinding of the starting material to produce a slurry, powder or emulsion * heating the processed plant material to denature lipoxidase enzymes to minimize their effects on flavor * removing sedimentable solids by filtration * adding water, sugar (or sugar substitutes) and other ingredients to improve flavour, aroma, and micronutrient content * pasteurizing the pre-final liquid * homogenizing the liquid to break down fat globules and particles for a smooth mouthfeel * packaging, labeling and storage at The actual content of the highlighted plant in commercial plant milks may be only around 2%. Other ingredients commonly added to plant milks during manufacturing include guar gum, xanthan gum, or sunflower lecithin for texture and mouthfeel, select micronutrients (such as calcium, B vitamins, and vitamin D), salt, and natural or artificial ingredients‚Äîsuch as flavours characteristic of the featured plant‚Äîfor aroma, color, and taste. Plant milks are also used to make ice cream, plant cream, vegan cheese, and yogurt, such as soy yogurt. The production of almond-based dairy substitutes has been criticized on environmental grounds as large amounts of water and pesticides are used. The emissions, land, and water footprints of plant milks vary, due to differences in crop water needs, farming practices, region of production, production processes, and transportation. Nutritional comparison with cow's milk Generally, because plant milks are manufactured using processed extracts of the starting plant, plant milks are lower in nutrient density than dairy milk and are fortified during manufacturing to add precise levels of micronutrients. Packaging and commerce To improve competition, plant milks are typically packaged in containers similar to those of dairy milks. Advertising for plant milks may contrast the intensive farming effort to produce dairy milk with the relative ease of harvesting vegan sources, such as oats, rice or soybeans. In the United States, plant milk sales grew steadily by 61% over the period 2012 to 2018. Among plant milks, almond (64% market share), soy (13% market share), and coconut (12% market share) were category leaders in the United States during 2018. Oat milk sales increased by 250% in Canada during 2019, and its growing consumption in the United States and United Kingdom led to production shortages from unprecedented consumer demand. In 2020, one major coffee retailer - Starbucks - added oat milk, coconut milk, and almond milk beverages to its menus in the United States and Canada. During 2020, oat milk sales in the United States increased to $213 million, becoming the second most consumed plant milk after almond milk ($1.5 billion in 2020 sales). Labeling and terminology  Plants milks may be labeled to highlight their nutrient contents, or with terms reflecting their composition or absence of ingredients, such as \\"dairy-free\\", \\"gluten-free\\" or \\"GMO-free\\". Traditionally a variety of non-dairy products have been described with the word milk, including the traditional digestive remedies milk of magnesiaWhen was Phillips' Milk of Magnesia introduced? FAQ, phillipsrelief.com, accessed 4 July 2016 and milk of bismuth.Park & Davis Co catalog entry for milk of bismuth Latex, the complex inedible emulsion that exudes from the stems of certain plants, is generally described as milky and is often sold as \\"rubber milk\\" because of its white appearance. The word latex itself is deducted from the Spanish word for milk.Raulf, Monika. The Latex Story. In: History of Allergy, K.-C. Bergmann and J. Ring, editors. Karger Medical and Scientific Publishers, 2014. pp. 248-255. In December 2013, European Union regulations stated that the terms \\"milk\\", \\"butter\\", \\"cheese\\", \\"cream\\" and \\"yoghurt\\" can only be used to market and advertise products derived from animal milk, with a small number of exceptions including coconut milk, peanut butter and ice cream. In 2017, the Landgericht Trier (Trier regional court), Germany, asked the Court of Justice of the European Union, to clarify European food-labeling law (Case C-422/16), with the court stating that plant-based products cannot be marketed as milk, cream, butter, cheese or yoghurt within the European Union because these are reserved for animal products; exceptions to this do not include tofu and soy. In the United Kingdom, strict standards are applied to food labeling for terms such as milk, cheese, cream, yogurt, which are protected to describe dairy products and may not be misused to describe non- dairy produce. In the United States, the dairy industry petitioned the FDA to ban the use of terms like \\"milk\\", \\"cheese\\", \\"cream\\" and \\"butter\\" on plant- based analogues (except for peanut butter). FDA commissioner, Scott Gottlieb, stated on July 17, 2018 that the term \\"milk\\" is used imprecisely in the labeling of non-dairy beverages, such as soy milk, oat milk and almond milk: \\"An almond doesn't lactate\\", he said. In 2019, the US National Milk Producers Federation petitioned the FDA to restrict labeling of plant-based milks, claiming they should be described as \\"imitation\\". In response, the Plant-Based Foods Association stated the word \\"imitation\\" was disparaging, and there was no evidence that consumers were misled or confused about plant-based milks. A 2018 survey by the International Food Information Council Foundation found that consumers in the United States do not typically confuse plant-based analogues with animal milk or dairy products. Labeling regulations for plant- based products with names such as \\"milk\\" or \\"yoghurt\\" were under review, as of 2018.

The English word \\"Calendar\\" also has its root in this word. Celebrations in Cardiff The capital of Wales, Cardiff, holds Calennig celebrations at the Cardiff Civic Centre to welcome in the New Year, including free live music, fairground rides, a midnight fireworks display and an opportunity to ice-skate into the new year at Cardiff's Winter Wonderland. Gift giving The tradition of giving gifts and money on New Year's Day is an ancient custom that survives even in modern-day Wales, though nowadays it is customary to give bread and cheese. Many people give gifts on New Year's morning, with children having skewered apples stuck with raisins and fruit. In some parts of Wales, people must visit all their relatives by midday to collect their Calennig, and celebrations and traditions can vary from area to area. In Stations of the Sun, Ronald Hutton gives the following example of Calennig rhyme from 1950s Aberystwyth, > Dydd calan yw hi heddiw, > Rwy'n dyfod ar eich traws > I 'mofyn am y geiniog, > Neu grwst, a bara a chaws. > O dewch i'r drws yn siriol > Heb newid dim o'ch gwedd; > Cyn daw dydd calan eto > Bydd llawer yn y bedd. > (\\"Today is the start of the new year, and I have come to you to ask for > coins, or a crust, and bread and cheese. O come to the door cheerfully > without changing your appearance; Before the next arrival of the new year > many will be dead.\\") Ronald Hutton also notes that in the south-east of Wales and in the Forest of Dean area, the skewered apple itself was known as the Calennig, and in its most elaborate form consisted of \\"an apple or orange, resting on three sticks like a tripod, smeared with flour, stuck with nuts, oats or wheat, topped with thyme or another fragrant herb and held by a skewer.\\" Similarly, Fred Hando in his 1944 book \\"The Pleasant Land of Gwent\\", reproduces an illustration of a Calennig seen at Devauden and quotes his friend Arthur Machen: > When I was a boy in Caerleon-on-Usk, the town children got the biggest and > bravest and gayest apple they could find in the loft, deep in the dry > bracken. They put bits of gold leaf upon it. They stuck raisins into it. > They inserted into the apple little sprigs of box, and they delicately slit > the ends of hazel-nuts, and so worked that the nuts appeared to grow from > the ends of the holly leaves ... At last, three bits of stick were fixed > into the base of the apple tripod-wise; and so it borne round from house to > house; and the children got cakes and sweets, and-those were wild days, > remember-small cups of ale. Machen traces the Calennig to the Roman Saturnalia and suggests that the custom was brought to Caerleon by the Romans.Hando, F.J., (1944) \\"The Pleasant Land of Gwent\\" - Chapter Ten, Trellech and the Virtuous Well, R.

Blacklers was founded by partners Richard John Blackler and A.B. Wallis in the early twentieth century. Blackler died in 1919 and was succeeded as a partner in the business by his wife Margaret. Despite the building being severely damaged in The Blitz of May 1941 during World War II, the business survived. Temporary outlets were created in Bold Street and Church Street and the first part of the new store opened on 29 March 1953. Margaret Blackler died in 1957 without children, at which point the store became the property of several individuals, of which the major shareholder was the sportswoman Vera Kingston (Margaret's god-daughter).

He was the manager of three Major League Baseball (MLB) teams: the Philadelphia Phillies (‚Äì); Texas Rangers (‚Äì); and Chicago Cubs (, on an interim basis). Overall, Lucchesi posted a career win‚Äìloss record of 316‚Äì399 (.442). Minor league career A native of San Francisco, Lucchesi had a long career as an outfielder and manager in minor league baseball. As a player (1945‚Äì1957), he toiled largely in the mid- and lower minors, in the Class B Western International League and Class C California League. He batted .276 in 1,149 games with 56 home runs. Lucchesi batted and threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed . His managerial career began in 1951 in the Class D Far West League as a player- manager. After a brief, early-1950s stint in the St. Louis Browns' organization, Lucchesi joined the Phillies' farm system in 1956. He logged 14 seasons as a manager there, including Triple-A assignments with the Arkansas Travelers, San Diego Padres and Eugene Emeralds, winning two championships; Eugene's 1969 Pacific Coast League regular-season division title earned Lucchesi promotion to the manager's job in Philadelphia the following season. In the 1970s and 1980s, Lucchesi also managed in the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds organizations. Manager of Phillies, Rangers and Cubs Lucchesi took over the Phillies at the beginning of the season as the team was rebuilding with young players. Although his initial squad showed a ten-game improvement from 1969's club, the 1971 Phillies fell into the basement of the National League East Division, and when the Phils started only 26‚Äì50 in 1972, Lucchesi was fired on July 9 by the club's new general manager, Paul Owens, who took over as manager himself. Lucchesi during his tenure with the Philadelphia Phillies, circa 1972 After returning to Triple-A to manage Cleveland's Oklahoma City 89ers affiliate in 1973, Lucchesi was appointed third-base coach of the Texas Rangers of the American League for 1974. The following season, on July 21, 1975, Lucchesi succeeded the fired Billy Martin as manager of the 1975 Rangers, who were a disappointing 44‚Äì51 in Martin's second season at the helm. Lucchesi led them to a 35‚Äì32 mark for the remainder of the year, and was rehired for 1976, when the Rangers continued to struggle at 76‚Äì86, tied for fourth in the AL West. Lucchesi was invited to return as manager for 1977, but a violent incident in spring training with second baseman Lenny Randle marred the season. Lucchesi was auditioning rookie Bump Wills to take over Randle's second base job. When Randle complained publicly about being benched, Lucchesi was quoted as responding: \\"I'm sick and tired of punks making $80,000 a year moaning and groaning about their situation.\\"The Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and American Culture, 1999, page 199 A few days later, before an exhibition game against the Minnesota Twins in Orlando, Randle and Lucchesi became embroiled in an argument.

Cuckmere Haven (also known as the Cuckmere estuary) is an area of flood plains in Sussex, England where the river Cuckmere meets the English Channel between Eastbourne and Seaford. The river is an example of a meandering river, and contains several oxbow lakes. It is a popular tourist destination with an estimated 350,000 visitors per year, where they can engage in long walks, or water activities on the river. The beach at Cuckmere Haven is next to the famous chalk cliffs, the Seven Sisters. The wreck of the Polynesia, a German sailing ship that ran aground in April 1890 west of Beachy Head laden with a cargo of sodium nitrate, is exposed at low tide. History World War II defences at Cuckmere Haven The beach was commonly used by smugglers in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. For example, in 1783 two gangs of smugglers (each numbering 200 or 300) overcame officers of the law by weight of numbers and carried away a large quantity of goods.Parry, John Docwra, An Historical and Descriptive Account of the Coast of Sussex: Brighton, Eastbourn, Hastings, St. Leonards, Rye, &c.; &c.; &c.; Worthing, Arundel, Goodwood, Chichester, &c.; &c.; &c.; Battle, Hurstmonceaux, Lewes & Tonbridge Wells.

As a result, the British constructed a series of counter-landing defences, of which numerous pillboxes, anti-tank obstacles, ditches and tank traps survive. Admiralty scaffolding blocked the inlet, but is now gone. Cuckmere Haven featured heavily in the war effort: at night lights were placed to confuse bombers into thinking they were above Newhaven and an airfield was set up further inland.Richard Moss, WWII Coastal Defences at Cuckmere Haven, Culture24, 5 June 2005, accessed 28 February 2018 In addition to the permanent land-based constructions, the river was heavily mined. The East Sussex Transport and Trading Company extracted gravel from the beach at Cuckmere Haven. It transported the material to the road at Exceat on a 2-foot (610 mm) gauge tramway a mile (1.6 km) long, established in the early 1930s and closed in 1964. The tramway began in what is now the car park on the southern side of the main road. The footpath to Cuckmere Haven (east of the river) follows the line of the tramway. Settlements within the park Two hamlets, Exceat and Foxhole, are in the park, along with a small group of cottages on the cliff edge (known as the coastguard cottages) ‚Äì these are mostly kept as holiday homes. Next to the Friston Forest car park, Exceat is a group of farm buildings with facilities and a caf√©. There is also a tiny old shepherd's caravan. The name Exceat derives from the old English word for \\"exit\\"; the hamlet was an exit for people sailing out to the Channel. Foxhole is made up of another group of agricultural buildings, with a large pond at the centre. The two houses are home to the Seven Sisters Country Park rangers, and one barn has been converted to a camping barn, with an adjacent field for camping.

Coastguard cottages BBC Interview with a Cuckmere Haven SOS representative in February 2016 The coastguard cottages at Cuckmere Haven were built shortly after the National Coastguard Service was founded in 1822. Prior to this Cuckmere Haven was an important place for smuggling. The cliff face in front of the cottages has since retreated by more than 30 metres due to coastal erosion. This combined with the loss of shingle from the beach below the cottages due to wave action in storms has put the cottages in danger. A fundraising campaign has been created to protect these iconic buildings. Wildlife and ecosystem Anglers, in the sea where the River Cuckmere reaches its destination. To the left is the headland at Belle Tout. Cuckmere Haven is home to a large variety of wildlife, and has a rich ecosystem. Sheep and cattle graze, keeping the fields at a constant vegetation level. Woodpigeons and rooks pick at the stubble, and aquatic birds such as oystercatchers forage in the water meadows. The result is a fertile area of land providing varied habitats. The beaches are made up of shingle and there are rock pools along the shoreline at low tide.

It currently plays in the Belgian First Amateur Division. Its matricule is 4, meaning that it was the fourth club to register with the country's national federation, and the club was the first Belgian champion in history (5 Championships & 1 Cup). The club was also known for being 'homeless' between 1995 and 2015, but is now playing on its own ground in Rocourt. FC Li√®ge management also made the club sadly famous for its refusal to release Jean-Marc Bosman after his contract ran out in 1990, which in turn led to the Bosman ruling, a European Court of Justice decision that caused major changes to the structure of European football. The 'philosophy' of the club is based on integration of local young players and on popular and faithful support.  History  RFC Li√®ge Club, the first Belgian Champion in 1896. Alfred Wahl, (), \\"D√©couvertes Gallimard\\" collection (). It was founded in 1892 as \\"Li√®ge Football Club\\" and became a member of the Belgian Football Association as \\"Football Club Li√©geois\\" when it was founded in 1895. The club is the first Belgian Champion (1896) and is still the only club that has played all seasons at a national level (106 seasons in 2008‚Äì09). In 1920 the prefix Royal was added to the name of the club that already had won 3 championships (1896, 1898, 1899). In 1952 and 1953, the RFC Li√®ge won two more championships, being at that time the only team which was able to contest the undisputed domination of Anderlecht. In 1964 Football Club Li√©geois reached the Fairs Cup 1/2 finals, losing in 3 games against the winner of the Cup, Real Zaragoza. Between 1965 and 1985, there were poor results, and the club survived with the help of its own tradition: young players coming from inside the club, and faithful supporters. At the end of the 1980s, the RFC Li√®ge played in European competitions (notably against Benfica, Juventus, Rapid Vienna, Hibernian, Werder Bremen and Athletic Bilbao) and also won a Belgian Cup in 1990. Unfortunately, after that, bankruptcy was inevitable, and the stadium was sold and destroyed to build a movie theatre. The team joined with R.F.C. Tilleur-Saint-Nicolas, (a team from the suburb of Li√®ge) in 1995, to become R. Tilleur F.C. de Li√®ge. The club went down from the First Division (which it had not left since 1945) to the Third Division. The word Tilleur was finally excluded from the team name in 2000, coming back to \\"RFC de Li√®ge\\". Since 1995, the club has moved between the Second and Fourth Divisions, with two 3rd Division titles in 1996 and 2008. In 2008‚Äì09 the club played in the Belgian Second Division, but after just 2 seasons the club suffered back to back relegations: they eventually dropped to the Belgian Fourth Division in April 2011. In the 2015‚Äì16 season RFC Li√®ge plays in Division 3.  Stadium  Not having its own stadium after Stade V√©lodrome de Rocourt (Li√®ge) was destroyed in 1995 is the biggest problem for the RFC Li√®ge, also well known as 'homeless'. Between 1995 and 2015 the RFC Li√®ge played in Tilleur (1995‚Äì2000), Seraing (2000‚Äì2004), Ans (2004‚Äì2008), Seraing (Pairay Stadium, 2008‚Äì2015).

By the time of the Council of Trent (1543‚Äì1563) there were sequences for many feasts in the Church's year. The sequence has always been sung directly before the Gospel, after the Alleluia.To be precise, the sequence came between the second and third sections of the \\"alleluia.\\" See Rubric√¶ Generales Missalis Romani (1960) n.470, Retrieved 14 June 2006. The 2002 edition of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal, however, reversed the order and places the sequence before the Alleluia. See Institutio Generalis Missalis Romani (2002) n.64, Retrieved 14 June 2006. The form of this chant inspired a genre of Latin poetry written in a non-classical metre, often on a sacred Christian subject, which is also called a sequence. The Latin sequence in literature and liturgy The Rex caeli sequence from the Bamberg Manuscript of the treatise Musica enchiriadis, (2nd half of the 9th century, Germany) The Latin sequence has its beginnings, as an artistic form, in early Christian hymns such as the Vexilla Regis of Venantius Fortunatus. Venantius modified the classical metres based on syllable quantity to an accentual metre more easily suitable to be chanted to music in Christian worship. In the ninth century, Hrabanus Maurus also moved away from classical metres to produce Christian hymns such as Veni Creator Spiritus. The name sequentia, on the other hand, came to be bestowed upon these hymns as a result of the works of Notker Balbulus, who popularized the genre in the ninth century by publishing a collection of sequentiae in his Liber Hymnorum. Since early sequences were written in rhythmical prose, they were also called proses (Latin: prosae). Notker's texts were meant to be sung. In the Latin Mass of the Middle Ages, it became customary to prolong the last syllable of the Alleluia, while the deacon was ascending from the altar to the ambo, to sing or chant the Gospel. This prolonged melisma was called the jubilus, jubilatio, or laudes, because of its jubilant tone. It was also called sequentia, \\"sequence,\\" because it followed (Latin: sequi) the Alleluia. Notker set words to this melisma in rhythmic prose for chanting as a trope. The name sequence thus came to be applied to these texts; and by extension, to hymns containing rhyme and accentual metre. A collection of sequences was called the Sequentiale. One well-known sequence, falsely attributed to Notker during the Middle Ages, is the prose text Media vita in morte sumus (\\"In the midst of life we are in death\\"), which was translated by Cranmer and became a part of the burial service in the funeral rites of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. Other well-known sequences include the ninth-century Swan Sequence, Tommaso da Celano's Dies Irae, St. Thomas Aquinas' Pange lingua in praise of the Eucharist, the anonymous medieval hymn Ave maris stella (\\"Hail, star of the sea!\\"), and the Marian sequence Stabat Mater by Jacopone da Todi. During the Middle Ages, secular or semi-secular sequences, such as Peter of Blois' Olim sudor HerculisThe Later Cambridge Songs: An English Song Collection of the Twelfth Century, edited by John E. Stevens, see p. 107 (\\"The labours of Hercules\\") were written; the Goliards, a group of Latin poets who wrote mostly satirical verse, used the form extensively. The Carmina Burana is a collection of these sequences.  Many sequences abolished  In the Missal of Pius V (1570) the number of sequences for the entire Roman Rite was reduced to four: Victimae paschali laudes (11th century) for Easter, Veni Sancte Spiritus for Pentecost (12th century), Lauda Sion Salvatorem (c.1264) for Corpus Christi, and Dies Irae (13th century) for All Souls and in Masses for the Dead. In 1727, the 13th century Stabat Mater for Our Lady of Sorrows was added to this list.\\"Stabat Mater\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia (1917), Retrieved 14 June 2006. In 1970 the Dies Irae was removed from the Requiem Mass of the revised, new Roman Missal and was transferred to the Liturgy of the Hours to be sung ad libitum in the 34th week of the Ordinary Time before the beginning of Advent, dividing into three parts: Office of Readings, Lauds and Vespers. Currently, the Dies Irae is sung in churches where the Tridentine Mass is celebrated.Liturgia Horarum IV, (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2000), p.489. The Christmas sequence Laetabundus, not present in the Roman Missal, is found in the Dominican Missal. This sequence is permitted for the Third Mass of Christmas, the Epiphany, and Candlemas. The Third Edition of the Roman Missal, which was implemented in the United States in 2010, states that the Sequence is optional except on Easter Sunday and Pentecost Day, and it sung before the Alleluia. The sequence as a musical genre Sequences are distinguished by a structure dominated by couplets, in forms of AA'BB'CC'... and ABB'CC'DD'...Z. Although it is commonly understood that sequences fall into early, middle, and late periods, the history of developments in the genre is better thought of as unfolding in layers that overlap. In the early period, sequences such as Notker's often included single lines that were not part of a couplet. These single lines most often appeared at the beginning or end of the sequence, but could also appear in the middle. Sequences from the middle period, starting around the 11th century, such as the sequence for the Mass of Easter Day, Victimae paschali laudes, are less likely to have single lines outside of couplets, and their couplets are more likely to rhyme. By the 12th century, later sequences, such as the sequence for Pentecost, Veni Sancte Spiritus, showed increasing regularity of structure, with rhyming couplets throughout. Medieval sequences are usually modal melodies. While primarily syllabic, sequences can occasionally have short neumatic moments, but they almost never contain melismas. The two verses of each couplet are sung to the same musical line, usually ending on a tonally stabilizing pitch, with variety being created by couplets of different lengths and with different musical arches. Although sequences are vocal and monophonic, certain sequence texts suggest possible vocal harmonization in organum or instrumental accompaniment. The composition of sequences became less frequent when Humanist Latin replaced medieval Latin as the preferred literary style in Latin. New sequences continued to be written in Latin; one of the best known later sequences is the Christmas carol Adeste Fideles, known in English as \\"O Come, All Ye Faithful\\".

Life He was born at Orl√©ans in February 1634 and died at Paris on 8 December 1706. Little is known of his personal history beyond the fact that he was secretary to an embassy from the French court to the Republic of Venice. Works In his Histoire du gouvernement de Venise, he undertook to explain, and above all to criticize, the administration of that republic, and to expose the causes of its decadence. The work was printed by the king's printer and dedicated to Louvois, which suggests that the government did not disapprove of it. It appeared in March 1676 and drew a heated protest from the Venetian ambassador, Marcantonio Giustinian, later the doge of Venice. The author was sent to the Bastille, where he remained for six weeks.Archives de la Bastille, vol. viii. pp. 93 and 94 A second edition with a supplement, published immediately after, drew fresh protestations, and the edition was suppressed. This persecution gave the book such notoriety that it passed through twenty-two editions in three years and was translated into several languages; there is an English translation by Lord Falconbridge, son-in-law of Oliver Cromwell. Amelot next published in 1683 a translation of Paolo Sarpi's History of the Council of Trent. This work, and especially certain notes added by the translator, so offended advocates of the unlimited authority of the Pope that three memorials were presented asking for its repression. Under the pseudonym of La Motte Josseval, Amelot later published Discours politique sur Tacite, in which he analysed the character of Tiberius. A 21st-century interpretation of Amelot's role argues that Amelot, having been jailed for his political criticism expressed in his History of the Government of Venice, turned to annotated editions of classic and renaissance texts in order to continue his critique of the absolutist government of Louis XIV by indirect means. Amelot's versions of Tacitus' account of Tiberius and other sections of the Annales, along with his influential translation of Machiavelli's The Prince, became crucial elements in the development and expansion of critical political analysis during the Ancien R√©gime. To function under conditions of censorship, Amelot thinly veiled his political views as comments on other writers. In doing so, he exposed the absolutist claims of monarchy to examination by the literate bourgeoisie.Jacob Soll, Publishing The Prince: History, Reading & the Birth of Political Criticism (Ann Arbor 2005) References Category:1634 births Category:1706 deaths Category:People from Orl√©ans Category:French historians Category:French male writers ","title":"Abraham Nicolas Amelot de la Houssaye"},{"id":"2520669","text":"Ingebrigt H√•ker Flaten (born 23 September 1971 in Oppdal, Norway) is a Norwegian bassist active in the jazz and free jazz genres.

Smith presented The Wright Stuff in place of Matthew Wright on Channel 5 30 July 2012. In July 2010, Smith presented BBC Radio 2's Kiri Prize, a nationwide hunt to find an opera star. Smith has also covered the Friday Night Arts Show on BBC Radio 2 when Claudia Winkleman was away. From January 2013 to January 2016, Smith co- presented the weekday breakfast show on BBC London 94.9.Presenter Penny Smith to join BBC London 94.9 FM BBC, 10 December 2012 Smith joined new digital radio station Talkradio in 2016 presenting her first show on 26 March 2016. She currently present's the weekend breakfast show. =GMTV= 1993 ‚Äì 2009 On 19 April 1993, Smith began her career on GMTV as the show's main newsreader, as well as becoming the main presenter of the Reuters News Hour alongside Anne Davies, Matthew Lorenzo and Ross Kelly. In 1998, John Stapleton joined GMTV and then joined Penny as her co-presenter of the Reuters News Hour. In 2000, GMTV rebranded all of their programmes. With the loss of Matt Lorenzo and Ross Kelly, Smith and John Stapleton became the main presenters of the GMTV Newshour, as well as becoming the main newsreaders and relief presenters for GMTV Today. During this period Smith was sent to do travelogues in Jamaica, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Florida and the Greek Islands. 2009 ‚Äì 2010 In 2009, GMTV had a major relaunch, with all of their programmes rebranding and new studio. This meant that the GMTV Newshour and GMTV Today became GMTV, with Penny and John presenting the first hour of the show. Smith and Stapleton were the first faces and voices of the relaunch. Smith continued to be the main News Reader of GMTV. In July 2009, Kate Garraway went on maternity leave. This meant that Smith would become the show's main presenter alongside Ben Shephard until Garraway's return in October. During this time, Smith was the main relief presenter for GMTV. In 2010, Smith presented the 9:00 news update from the GMTV newsroom for GMTV with Lorraine. In the Spring of 2010, Smith began to share presenting duties with Helen Fospero until her departure in June. On 3 March 2010, it had emerged from Smith's Twitter account that she had decided to leave the programme after 17 years of being the main face of the show. This was said to be part of a cost-cutting exercise by ITV. On 4 June 2010, Smith presented her last show.

The housing act of 1919 promised ‚ÄúHomes for Heroes‚Äù and an improvement on the overcrowded and inadequate living conditions that existed in early twentieth century Britain. Swilly was Plymouth‚Äôs response to this Act. Swilly House had been at the centre of a prosperous country estate. Much of the former mansion was transferred from Swilly, being reconstructed at a site known as Woodtown on the edge of Dartmoor. The original word may have derived from the Anglo-Saxon word meaning ‚Äúfarmland‚Äù, but also it may have a Celtic derivation associated to water (refer to the Irish \\"Lough Swilly\\" and \\"River Swilly\\") as the earliest reference in Plymouth to \\"Swilly creek\\" in 1578 http://www.northprospecthistory.co.uk/information.php?s=History&section;=4 pre-dates the subsequent farm. Before the Second World War much of the locality of what is now North Prospect and the western edge of Beacon Park was known as Swilly. Swilly Post Office was at the corner of South Down Road and West Down Road. Swilly Hospital (later renamed Scott Hospital after Robert Falcon Scott, who lived at the nearby Outland House and was later leader of ill-fated Antarctic Expedition in 1912) was first a sanatorium and later an isolation hospital and was situated at the heart of the estate (the junction of Swilly Road, renamed North Prospect Road, and Beacon Park). Not far from here (at 142 Swilly Road) the first bombs of the Blitz fell. For a time, Ron Goodwin, whose orchestral compositions include 633 Squadron, lived at Swilly Crescent which, having been later renamed North Prospect Crescent, is now known as Goodwin Crescent. The council estate, designed with plenty of open space and trees, was prosperous up until the 1950s when the area began to get a reputation due to the economic and social problems of its residents. The officer class who originally lived in the area began to be superseded by poorer families from the most deprived areas of Plymouth, particularly Devonport, in the 1930s. Due to severe underinvestment by subsequent council administrations, Swilly, its housing stock and the community at large became increasingly vulnerable to criticism and even contempt. At this point, the name ‚ÄúSwilly‚Äù became a derogatory term for any economically deprived residents of Plymouth, and efforts were made initially to apply the name Swilly only to the council estate and later to get rid of the name altogether. In the 1970s the name was changed to North Prospect and the area has since seen some urban regeneration. North Prospect consists in many residential streets connected with North Prospect Road where the local shops are located. Its name is still synonymous with economic depression and petty crime in Devon and Cornwall, though the widespread use of ASBOs and a new police station have gone some way to treat the minority who continue to foster the area's negative reputation. Its reputation often belies the warm regard in which the estate is held by many of its residents, a significant number of whom grew up and continue to live on the estate. North Prospect provides decent homes for many families, is close to Plymouth city centre, and is generally leafy and quiet. North Prospect has given rise to a strong sense of community, and several agencies and associations (including the North Prospect Partnership) work hard to improve the estate. In July (19-20) The Swillynation and the City Social Club held Swillyfest! a weekend of live bands, sports and other fun and games. It was a community event for all the family.http://www.facebook.com/TheSwillynation In March 2006, Plymouth City Council announced that it was considering replacing the oldest housing stock on the estate with new housing. An intensive building survey found a good proportion of the houses to suffer from untreatable damp and significant structural problems. A consensus continues to grow that it would be cheaper to replace, rather than simply patch-up, a great many houses on the estate. An investment of over ¬£30 million is needed to improve the estate's housing stock and any large-scale re-development is likely to take many years and much public consultation. In autumn 2010 Plymouth Community Homes (PCH) selected Barratt Homes as the development partner to redevelop the estate.http://www.barrattdevelopments.co.uk/showcase/pl2-plymouth Barratt Homes demolished the majority of the existing houses and redeveloped the area by building 574 new 'modern energy efficient' homes. In addition to new homes Barratts constructed a community hub named Beacon Community Hub http://www.plymouthcommunityhomes.co.uk/2014/03/north-prospect-beacon- prepares-to-open-its-doors/ which includes a shop, library (which is run by Plymouth City Council), North Prospect‚Äôs Sure Start nursery, office space and flats. It also hosts North Prospect Community Choir which launched in November 2016.http://www.northprospectcommunitychoir.org.uk/ The hub was completed and opened in early 2014. The overall redevelopment scheme has provided local residents with affordable private homes which buyers were able to take advantage of the government's controversial Help to Buy scheme.https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/house-building-surges-as- controversial-help-to-buy-scheme-kicks-in/8649238.article A number of the new homes were also made available to Plymouth Community Homes tenants. The scheme is due to be completed in May 2017 and has been selected for numerous awards including the RICS 'Regeneration project of The Year (South West & Wales) Award 2013'.

Founded in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin as a library, the Library Company of Philadelphia has accumulated one of the most significant collections of historically valuable manuscripts and printed material in the United States. The current collection size is about 500,000 books and 70,000 other items, including 2,150 items that once belonged to Franklin, the Mayflower Compact, major collections of 17th-century and Revolution-era pamphlets and ephemera, maps, and whole libraries assembled in the 18th and 19th centuries. The collection also includes first editions of Moby-Dick and Leaves of Grass. Early history The Library Company was an offshoot of the Junto, a discussion group in colonial Philadelphia, that gravitated around Benjamin Franklin. On July 1, 1731, Franklin and a number of his fellow members among the Junto drew up articles of agreement to found a library, for they had discovered that their far-ranging conversations on intellectual and political themes floundered at times on a point of fact that might be found in a decent library. In colonial Pennsylvania at the time there were not many books; Books from London booksellers were expensive to purchase and slow to arrive. Franklin and his friends were mostly of moderate means, and none alone could have afforded a representative library such as a gentleman of leisure might expect to assemble. By pooling their resources in pragmatic Franklinian fashion, as the Library Company's historian wrote, \\"the contribution of each created the book capital of all.\\" Many of the first books in the collection focused on religion and education. It is notable that the first texts of the collection were written in English, when during the period most books held in academic and private libraries were only found in Latin.https://dp.la/exhibitions/history-us-public-libraries/beginnings/the- library-company The first librarian they hired was Louis Timothee, America's first. He only held the position for a brief time. Until another librarian was found to replace him, Benjamin Franklin took over his duties. Franklin's stint as librarian ended in 1734. He was replaced by William Parsons. He was the librarian for 12 years. Robert Greenway was the fourth librarian, and his tenure lasted until 1763. The articles of association specified that each member after the first fifty must be approved by the directors, sign the articles, and pay the subscription. Admitting new members and selecting new books were the directors' ordinary duties. In the back of the library's catalog from 1741, Franklin mentioned that the library was accessible to people who were not members. Those who were not members were allowed to borrow books. However, they had to leave enough money to cover the cost of the book. Apparently, their money was given back upon returning the book. The privilege of being a member meant that books could be borrowed for free. Franklin also mentioned that the library was only open on Saturdays, for four hours in the afternoon. On November 10, 1731, at Nicholas Scull's Bear Tavern ten persons paid their forty shillings: Robert Grace (share no. 1), Thomas Hopkinson (share no. 2),2 Benjamin Franklin (share no. 3), John Jones, Jr. (4), Joseph Breintnall (5), Anthony Nicholas (6), Thomas Godfrey (7), Joseph Stretch (8), Philip Syng, Jr. (9), and John Sober (10). It was a disappointing turnout: all but John Sober and the hatter Joseph Stretch (son of Peter Stretch), who later became a Pennsylvania assemblyman, were officers. The library now had eleven paid-up members. Joseph Stretch and his brothers provided half of the original capital to build Pennsylvania Hospital, another of Benjamin Franklin's projects. Over time, fifty subscribers invested 40 shillings each and promised to pay ten shillings a year thereafter to buy books and maintain a shareholder's library. Therefore, \\"the Mother of all American subscription libraries\\" was established, and a list of desired books compiled in part by James Logan, \\"the best Judge of Books in these parts,\\" was sent to London and by autumn the first books were on the shelves. Earlier libraries in the Thirteen Colonies belonged to gentlemen, members of the clergy, and colleges. Members of the Library Company soon opened their own book presses to make donations: A Collection of Several Pieces, by John Locke; Logic: or, the Art of Thinking, by the Port Royalists Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, which Franklin in his autobiography said he had read at the age of 16; Plutarch's Moralia translated by Philemon Holland; Lewis Roberts' Merchants Mappe of Commerce, and others. A bit later William Rawle added a set of Spenser's Works to the collection and Francis Richardson gave several volumes, among them Francis Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum, but on the whole books in Latin were few. Overtures to the proprietor of Pennsylvania, John Penn at Pennsbury at first elicited no more than a polite response, but an unsolicited gift of 34 pound sterling arrived in the summer of 1738 from Walter Sydserfe, a Scottish-born physician and planter of Antigua. The earliest surviving printed catalogue of 1741 gives the range of readers' tastes, for the members' requirements shaped the collection. Excluding gifts, a third of the holdings of 375 titles were historical works, geographies and accounts of voyages and travels, a category the Library Company has collected energetically throughout its history. A fifth of the titles were literature, mostly in the form of poetry and plays, for the prose novel was still in its infancy: as late as 1783, in the first orders from London after the war years, the directors thought \\"we should not think it expedient to add to our present stock, anything in the novel way.\\" Another fifth of the titles were devoted to works of science. Theology and sermons, however, accounted for only a tenth of the titles, which set the Free Library apart from collegiate libraries at Harvard and Yale. The Company's agent in London was Peter Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society, the Quaker mercer-naturalist of London, who corresponded with John Bartram. The Library Company's example was soon imitated in other cities along the Atlantic coast, from Salem to Charleston. The Library soon became a repository of other curiosities: antique coins, including a gift of Roman coins from a Tory Member of Parliament, fossils, natural history specimens, minerals. When John Penn, making up for his slow start, sent an air-pump to the learned society in 1739, the directors, to house it commissioned a glazed cabinet, the earliest extant example of American-made Palladian architectural furniture. Rooms on the second floor of the newly finished west wing of the State House (now Independence Hall) housed the Library and its collections: there Franklin and his associates performed their first experiments in electricity during the 1740s. Later Benjamin West sent the mummified hand of an Egyptian princess. Library and Surgeon's Hall, Fifth-street Engraving, 1800, by William Russell Birch A charter was issued for the Company from the Penn proprietors, March 24, 1742, that included a plot of land, issued in their name by Governor George Thomas. Collinson, who had faithfully executed the Company's requests for books over the years, sent windfalls in 1755 and in 1758 in the form of boxes of his own copies of a score of 17th-century accounts of the newly established British colonies in America, among them such classics as Strachey's Lawes, Mourt's Relation and John Smith's Generall Historie of Virginia. The Library Company's microscope and telescope were frequently borrowed and from time to time, needed to undergo repairs. There is also evidence that many of the library's curiosities were available to borrow if permission was obtained from any two directors. In 1769 Owen Biddle used the telescope to observe the transit of Venus from Cape Henlopen. On May 9 of that year Sarah Wistar became the first woman to be voted a library share. Expansion The Library absorbed smaller lending libraries and outgrew its rooms, renting larger space on the second floor of the new Carpenters' Company hall in 1773. \\"The Books (inclosed within Wire Lattices) are kept in one large Room,\\" Franklin was informed in London, \\"and in another handsome Apartment the [scientific] Apparatus is deposited and the Directors meet.\\" On September 5, 1774, the First Continental Congress met on the first floor of Carpenters' Hall, and the Library Company extended members' privileges to all the delegates. The offer was renewed when the Second Continental Congress met the following spring, and again when the delegates to the Constitutional Convention met in 1787. Nine signers of the Declaration of Independence ‚Äî Benjamin Franklin, Benjamin Rush, Francis Hopkinson, Robert Morris, George Clymer, John Morton, James Wilson, Thomas McKean, and George Ross ‚Äî owned shares, some of them serving as directors. The Library Company served virtually as the Library of Congress until the national capital was established in 1800. > Virtually every significant work on political theory, history, law, and > statecraft (and much else besides) could be found on the Library Company's > shelves, as well as numerous tracts and polemical writings by American as > well as European authors. And virtually all of those works that were > influential in framing the minds of the Framers of the nation are still on > the Library Company's shelves. The former Ridgway Library at 901 S. Broad Street, built in 1873‚Äì78, is now occupied since 1997 by the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts In 1785 the Company purchased a collection of Revolutionary broadsheets pamphlets and other ephemera that had been assiduously collected by Pierre Eug√®ne Du Simiti√®re, of which no other copies have survived. Permanent quarters were established for the Library Company in 1789 with the purchase of a lot on Fifth Street near Chestnut across from State House Square. A competition for the design of a building was won by an amateur of architecture, Dr. William Thornton, with a plan for a Palladian red-brick structure with white pilasters and a pediment interrupting a balustraded roof. A curving double flight of steps led up to the arched door under an arched niche containing a gift from William Bingham ‚Äî a marble statue of Franklin in a classical toga sculpted in Italy by Francesco Lazzarini. Member's shares were extended to carpenters and bricklayers in partial payment for work on the new building. The new quarters were opened on New Year's Day, 1791. For the new library Samuel Jennings, an expatriate Philadelphian living in London, painted a large picture, \\"Liberty Displaying the Arts and Sciences.\\" In 1792 the Loganian Library, which had been housed across the square, was transferred to the Library Company, complementing its collection with the 2600 books (chiefly in Latin and Greek) that had been collected by James Logan. This collection was supplemented by the medical library of James Logan's younger brother, a physician in Bristol, England, the best medical library then in North America. Thornton's new building immediately required a new wing. 19th century The collections went from strength to strength in the 19th century. In mid-century it was considered one of the \\"five great libraries\\" in the United States, along with the Harvard University Library, Yale University Library, Library of Congress, and Boston Athen√¶um. The Ridgway Library, opened in 1966, home of the Library Company of Philadelphia, at 1314 Locust Street in Philadelphia The Library Company's collections were physically split in the mid-19th century. A large bequest from Dr. James Rush resulted in a new building at Broad and Christian streets in South Philadelphia. The Ridgway Library, as it was called, was controversial because it was both physically and socially removed from the homes and businesses of the members. A new, more centrally located, library designed by Frank Furness opened its doors in 1880 at Juniper and Locust Street. 20th century The Library Company suffered financial troubles during the Great Depression and was forced to sell the Locust Street building and consolidate the collections in the Ridgway Library on South Broad Street. As its fortunes improved after the war, the institution focused on its mission as a scholarly research library. In the second half of the 20th century, under the direction of Edwin Wolf, an energetic program of renewal brought the Library Company once more into a busy and vital center of national importance for research and education. The Library Company completed a new building on Locust Street, also named the Ridgway Library, in 1965, and opened it to the public in April 1966.

They speak an Apiac√° language that is a subgroup part of the Tupi-Guarani languages, though many today speak Portuguese. Prior to the 19th century, the Apiac√° were a warlike tribe with a heavily agricultural culture. Around the mid 19th century, their numbers began to decline. This decrease coincided with the contact of European settlers in Brazil. Though thought to be extinct, their numbers, today, are increasing. In 2001, there were only 192 Apiak√°. As of 2009, there are a thousand Apiak√° people. Language The Apiak√° language belongs to subgroup VI of the Tupi- Guarani languages. After coming into contact with the Neo-Brazilians, the Apiaca language changed with combined elements of the Lingua Geral, A Tupi- based trade jargon. Today, Portuguese or Munduruku are more widely spoken as opposed to the Apiaca language, though these people have always been known by the name \\"Apiaca.\\" Today there are only four people aged over 50 who speak and understand the Apiaca language, one person speaks the language fully, another two possess less proficiency and the fourth has yet to be evaluated in close detail. Therefore, the language is at grave risk of becoming extinct. All the Apiaca speak Portuguese and those married to members of the Munduruku and Kaiabi tribes speak their spouse‚Äôs language fluently or have the ability to understand them fully. Although the Munduruku and Kaiabi languages and idioms are spoken on a day-to-day basis in the Apiaca villages, they are, however, limited to domestic spaces and informal conversations. The language used in formal conversations is Portuguese, due to contact with the Neo-Brazilians and Portuguese settlers. Although they cannot impose their own language on the co- resident Munduruku and Kaiabi people, due to such a small number of them who actually speak the Apiaca language, the Apiaca manage to impede the languages of these peoples from becoming the official languages in their villages. This allows Portuguese to function as an instrument of resistance employed by the Apiaca to prevent their cultural absorption by the Munduruku and Kaiabi tribes. Despite the linguistic proximity, the Apiak√° do not allow Kaiabi to be taught in their villages‚Äô schools: this stems from historically bad relations with this tribe. However, due to the better relationship the Apiaca have with the Munduruku people, they permit Munduruku teachers to give lessons in their own language. For many years the Apiaca have been attempting to revive their language through the schools in their villages but have so far been unsuccessful. In recent years there has been an initiative to create a book known as the \\"Apiaca Word\\" in order to catalog the language. Name They are also known as Apiac√° or Apiake people. Apiak√° is said to have come from the Tupi word apiapa which means \\"people\\" or \\"man\\". Contrary to this origin, \\"the Apiak√° leaders explain that their people's name refers to a wasp that when attacked travels long distances to exact revenge on the aggressor with an extremely painful sting.\\" The name of the Apiac√° people explains their beliefs in war and a warrior attitude. Location Until 1848, the Apiac√° mainly were found between the left bank of the Arinos River and the right bank of the Juruena River. However, pressure from the Neo-Brazilians caused a large portion of the Apiac√° tribe to migrate towards the S√£o Manoel River. During the early late 1800s however, the Apiac√° disappeared from S√£o Manoel. In 1895, the remnants of 100 people of this tribe were found between Salto S√£o Sim√£o and S√£o Florencio. Currently, because of the growing recovery of the tribe, there are 7 villages that are located in the states of Mato Grosso and Par√°. These 7 villages include: Mayrob, Figueirinha, Mairowy, Bom Futuro, Vista Alegre, Minhocu√ßu, and Pontal. History The earliest records concerning the Apiac√° date from 1791 to 1805, although it is possible that these Indians may have encountered Europeans as early as 1747. In the beginning of the 19th century, the Apiac√° tribe consisted of nearly 16,000 people. In 1812, one settlement consisted of around 500 people in which half were warriors. They were once a large tribe until the rubber boom took over Amazonia. The rubber boom also pushed and scattered the Apiac√° away from their historical territory. The Apiac√° had a strong fighting culture. They often fought with their nearby competitors, such as the Tapanyuna tribe, located on the rightward side of the Arinos River. However, the Apiac√° did not fight for materials, but instead to avenge past conflicts. With around 200 to 300 warriors, every year they would march to battle against another tribe. Apiac√° would also practice cannibalism to their prisoners. Throughout the existence of the Apiac√°, their numbers have declined dramatically. Because of the establishment of the \\"Collectoria estadol do Mato Grosso\\" in 1912, many were killed and 32 remained. They were killed in compensation from an attack they made at the collector‚Äôs office. In 1916 there was evidence of some Negroes having been assimilated into the tribe. In 1957, two ethnologists, undertaking a study of indigenous groups in Brazil, mistakenly declared the Apiac√° extinct. They posited a number of possible causes for this supposed extinction: disease epidemics, massacres stemming from resistance to colonization, warfare with neighboring native people, and assimilation into other indigenous groups. In fact, during this entire time the tribe was still very much alive, living amongst the Kaiabi and Munduruku peoples but preserving many aspects of their own distinct culture. Culture and customs The earliest records of the Apiaca people suggest that they had large plots of cultivated fields, and grew a great array of crops. Crops harvested include sweet cassava (manioc), cara, yams, peanuts, sweet potatoes, maize, beans, lima beans, pumpkins, cotton, and as of 1848, watermelons. Planting and harvesting were typically communal activities, although typically performed by women. Although early sources do not make mention of any domestic animals, by the mid-19th century the Apiaca came to have pigs, dogs, chickens, ducks, and several other birds. They hunted peccaries, tapirs, and capybaras, and used baskets set at the bottom of weirs across the mouths of streams in order to catch fish.Dictionary of Indian Tribes of the Americas (2 ed.). Newport Beach, California: American Indian Publishers Incorporated. 1993. . Apiaca settlements were formerly beside the river and typically consisted of a single, large house surrounded by a clearing. The huts were rectangular and covered with thatched roofs, and the walls were made of bark or palm. Inside the homes, cotton hammocks, made of either coarse fabric or net, were hung along the walls. Large bark canoes provided transportation across the waterways. Baskets, trays, sieves, and supports for various vessels were woven with strips of creeper, and ceramic pots, pans, and dishes were manufactured. Musical instruments were a part of their culture as well, as they had drums, rattles, and bamboo trumpets. Weapons and ornaments were the only forms of private property. Iron tools obtained from Europeans were of great value, although the Apiaca occasionally stole them from the Europeans. Each Apiaca communal hut constituted a settlement and had at least one chief. The title of chief was passed from father to son or, in the absence of an heir apparent, to the nearest relative. The chief was unique in that he was allowed as many as three wives, although typically his authority was exercised \\"unobtrusively\\". However, in times of war and in encounters with foreigners, the chief assumed great authority. This was evidenced by his distinctive ornaments, which included a large, white shell collar, a feather diadem, and a large belt of black beads and human teeth. After childbirth, a mother was confined for only one day, and children were raised in an atmosphere of love and affection. Boys were tattooed by women using thorns in a process completed at the age of 14. In this ritual, boys had a rectangle tattooed around the mouth, symbolizing that the boy could eat human flesh. Facial tattoos consisted of marks form each ear to the nose, chin, and mouth, while designs on the body displayed war and hunting accomplishments. Women were tattooed after marriage with a design consisting of a rectangle on the chin, with a band running to the ears. With the exception of the chief, the Apiaca were monogamous and married at the age of 14. Divorce was allowed, with custody of children going to the father in these cases. The dead were buried in shallow graves under their hammocks in the house, and their bones were exhumed after a year to be buried in the original grave. The Apiaca fought and warred regularly with their neighbors, who included the Nambicuara, the Parintintin, the Tapanyuna, and others, for the purpose of avenging former issues. War expeditions of 200 to 300 warriors were embarked upon after the harvest, but only in the event of the shamans predicting victory. Several villages might cooperate under the leadership of a chief in times of war, and cannibalism ‚Äì eating of prisoners and those killed in battle ‚Äì was practiced with elaborate ceremonies as late as 1848. Religion The Apiaca believed in a god who created the sky and earth and who showed his anger and displeasure in the form of thunder and lightning. Shamans were greatly respected and told the future through trances and speaking with the spirits. They treated the ill by blowing on the patient, sucking the afflicted part of the body, and washing the patient in an herbal bath.

Life  Lekeu was born in Heusy, a village near Verviers, Belgium. He originally studied piano and music theory under Alphonse Voss, the director of the brass band at the local conservatory. In 1879, his parents moved to Poitiers, France. He continued to pursue his music studies independently while at school, composing his first piece at the age of 15. From 1885 onwards, he regularly composed new music, especially chamber music, and studied harmony and violin from 1887 under Octave Grisard. In June 1888, his family moved to Paris where he began to study philosophy. He was introduced to the works of T√©odor de Wyzewa and continued his studies under Gaston Vallin. In August 1889, he traveled to Bayreuth to see the operas of Richard Wagner. On his return, he studied counterpoint and fugue privately with C√©sar Franck. Franck encouraged him to continue composing; after Franck's death in the autumn of 1890, Wyzewa introduced him to Vincent d'Indy, who taught him orchestration and encouraged him to compete for the Belgian Prix de Rome, awarded in Brussels. In 1891, he won second prize in the competition for the cantata Androm√®de. In 1892, d'Indy introduced Lekeu to Octave Maus, then secretary of Brussels-based Le Cercle des XX. Eug√®ne Ysa√øe commissioned a work from him, the Violin Sonata in G major, which premiered in March 1893, and is his most famous and most often recorded work. Lekeu contracted typhoid fever from a contaminated sorbet in October 1893. He died in his parents' home in Angers on 21 January 1894, the day after his 24th birthday. On 26 January 1894, he was buried in a small cemetery in Heusy.  Musical style and influences  Lekeu's personal style was present in his earliest compositions. In 1887, he said \\"Bien plus, ce sera bizarre, d√©traqu√©, horrible, tout ce qu'on voudra; mais, du moins, ce sera original\\" (\\"Even more, it will be weird, mad, horrible, anything you like, but at least it will be original\\"). Lekeu's string quartets were inspired by Beethoven, and exposure to Wagner's operas at Bayreuth influenced his approaches to melody. He described this as \\"des m√©lodies de telle longueur qu'un seul expos√© suffisait √† parfaire ... un morceau de musique\\" (\\"melodies of such length that a single presentation was sufficient to complete ... a piece of music\\"). His primary influence was Franck. Many of his works are characterized by a certain melancholy: in his own words, \\"la joie [est] mille fois plus difficile √† peindre que la souffrance\\" (\\"joy is a thousand times harder to paint than suffering\\"). His larger compositions are cyclic in structure; that is, themes in his works will often recur from movement to movement, something no doubt inherited from a long tradition of nineteenth- century European composers, as well as from many works of Franck and d'Indy. The recurring themes in the violin sonata have led some scholars to suggest that it was an inspiration for the Vinteuil Sonata, an imaginary work described by Marcel Proust in In Search of Lost Time. However, the structure imagined by Proust is also similar to the violin sonata by Franck. His style, prophetic of early-twentieth-century avant-garde French composers like Satie and Milhaud, was influenced by Franck, Wagner and (especially in the Trio) Beethoven, though these influences did not manifest themselves as mere imitation. In general, Lekeu is regarded as a highly talented composer whose death cut short a promising musical career.  Compositions  Lekeu composed about 50 works, and left a number of unfinished compositions at the time of his death. Two of these, a Cello Sonata and his Piano Quartet, were completed by D'Indy.Christopher Palmer/Luc Verdebout, Grove Music Online. All have been recorded at least once, and several of them more than once, notably the Violin Sonata in G Major and the Piano Trio in C minor. The first time Piano Sonata in G minor had been completely performed on live by pianist Pawe≈Ç Albi≈Ñski in Krak√≥w, Poland on 20 August 2014.PAP, Forgotten Composers on Pawe≈Ç Albi≈Ñski's Piano Recital, \\"Gazeta Wyborcza\\", 20 VIII 2014.

Early life and education He was born in Simla, British India, (since 1947 known as Shimla), the summer capital of India in the days of the British Raj. The family, like many others living in India at the time, had moved there to escape the heat and disease of India's lower altitudes during the summer months. His father, John Patrick Cronin (1889‚Äì1952), a director of Lever Brothers', was Lord Leverhulme's representative in India and later Chairman of Horlicks, Australia. Cronin spent the first three years of his life in India until the family returned to their home in Hornsey Lane, Highgate, London in 1919. In 1929, the family moved to Woodside Park near Totteridge in North East Finchley. Cronin was educated at St Aloysius' College in Highgate from 1923 to 1924, then at Hodder House, the preparatory school for Stonyhurst College in Clitheroe, Lancashire, from 1924 to 1930 before going on to Stonyhurst where he studied until 1933. Cronin wanted to join the Royal Navy, but his father decided he was to have a career in medicine, and sent him to St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College. He became a Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1939, and received a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery in 1940. He was the Resident Surgeon at Grimsby and District Hospital from 1940 to 1941. Wartime and medical career Cronin became surgical registrar and surgeon in the Emergency Medical Service at the Royal Free Hospital. He joined the army in 1942, serving as a lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps and was made a graded surgeon after a few months spent as a general duty officer. He commanded 50 pioneers in the Normandy landings in 1944 and later worked as a surgeon just outside Caen. He was posted to India at the end of 1944 and was promoted in 1945 to major and then to acting lieutenant colonel. He then served in Burma, working with the forward troops before returning to England in 1946 to live in Regents Park Road near Regent's Park, London; he had at that time a consulting room in Harley Street. In 1947, he passed the examinations to become a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and was appointed as assistant orthopaedic surgeon at the Prince of Wales Hospital later that year. In 1948, he was appointed orthopaedic surgeon at the French Hospital. By this time Cronin had a home and his own consulting room in Wimpole Street. A fluent speaker of French, Cronin was first made an Officier of the L√©gion d'honneur and, in 1967, a Chevalier in recognition of his services. He also became an expert in industrial injuries and from the 1950s he was regularly an expert witness in personal injury cases. He was a founding Director of Racal Electronics Ltd from 1965 until his death in 1986. Political career In 1948, Cronin joined the Labour Party. He became vice chairman of the North St Pancras Labour Party in 1950, and was a member of London County Council, representing Fulham East, from 1952‚Äì1955. In 1955 he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Loughborough, representing the Labour Party. He was an Opposition Whip in the House of Commons from 1959 to 1962. A man believing in socialist principles, Cronin was a close friend of Hugh Gaitskell and Roy Jenkins. He rose to become the Shadow Minister of State for Aviation in 1962. On 18 November, while taking part in a scheme for Parliamentarians to visit Royal Navy ship at sea, he was one of three survivors from a Wessex helicopter belonging to HMS Hermes which crashed off St David's Head. In 1965, he was offered a peerage; Harold Wilson used George Brown as his intermediary, but Cronin declined, telling Brown that the House of Commons was the best club in the country, and he was reluctant to leave it. He went on to hold his Loughborough seat until 1979 when he was beaten by the Conservative Stephen Dorrell. Personal life and family Cronin became a member of Brooks's, a political club in St James's Street, in 1984 having been proposed as a member by Roy Jenkins. A keen sportsman who hunted when young and regularly rode Household Cavalry horses in Hyde Park, he also played polo, squash and tennis. Cronin was an enthusiastic yachtsman ‚Äî a member of the Royal Lymington Yacht Club, based in Hampshire, he sailed regularly and was Commodore of the House of Commons Yacht Club. His yacht, named Hardie after the founder of the Labour party, was a 17 ton Bermudian rigged sloop and won the Cowes to Cherbourg yacht race with Cronin at the helm. He married Cora Mumby-Croft in 1941 and they had three children: Anne Olivia born in 1942, who married Piers Dixon, Conservative MP for Truro 1970‚Äì1974, and son of Sir Pierson Dixon, GCMG, Ambassador to France 1960‚Äì1964. Pauline Margaret Cronin was born in 1944, and married Stephen Clarke, the son of Bernard and Doris Clarke. Charles John Cronin was born in 1961 and married Jane Hockey; Charles served on Westminster City Council as a Conservative from 1998 to 2002. Cronin died on 3 January 1986, aged 69, whilst out riding in the New Forest in Hampshire. In the late afternoon his horse returned home without him: it was feared he might have been thrown and that he could be lying badly injured in freezing weather conditions. The Forest Verderers were sent out and found him dead on a forest path, not far from his home at Stoney Cross. A post mortem later found that he had died of a massive heart attack and stroke. His funeral was held at Minstead Church and Sir Ernie Harrison, Chairman of Racal and a close friend, made a valedictory speech from the pulpit during the service. Cronin lies buried in Minstead Church graveyard.

According to the Church, the OSA is responsible for directing legal affairs, public relations, pursuing investigations, publicizing the Church's \\"social betterment works,\\" and \\"oversee[ing its] social reform programs\\". Some observers outside the Church have characterized the department as an intelligence agency, comparing it variously to the CIA or the KGB.Wakefield, Margery Understanding ScientologyCisar, Joe (translator) The Guardian Office (GO)Hamburg Regional Office of the German Constitutional Security Agency Der Geheimdienst der Scientology-Organisation - Grundlagen, Aufgaben, Strukturen, Methoden und Ziele - Zweite Auflage, Stand 06.05.1998\\" The department has targeted critics of the Church with dead agent operations and character assassination.Scientologists pay for libel, Clare Dyer, The Guardian, 9 June 1999.

The most recent head of OSA International was Mike Rinder, who has since departed from the organization and criticizes it severely, appearing as a co-host on Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.  Structure and personnel  At local Scientology organizations, directors (Special Affairs, Legal, Public Affairs) are OSA staff members. Local Directors of Special Affairs are known as DSAs. Members of the Office of Special Affairs are drawn from the Sea Org. In addition to regular staff, some church members also act as volunteer collaborators for the office, which cuts down on private investigation and legal research expenses.Ortega, Tony (Sept. 9, 2001). \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\" New Times Los Angeles.How the OSA trap really works Tory Christman ex-OSA volunteer Some volunteers participate under the notion that they receive special \\"ethics protection\\".Pieniadz, Patty Pattie Pieniadz In one case a volunteer who read critical information about Scientology on the internet was led to believe that he would be unable to continue receiving services unless he performed a series of investigations for OSA. Gerry Armstrong Scientology's 1023 Submission (Bates Nos. 152016-152073)  History  The Guardian's Office was established in 1966, and its initial mission was to protect the interests of the Church of Scientology, and gather information on agencies and individuals deemed enemies of the organization. The Guardian's Office was also charged with internal monitoring of current Scientologists, in particular heretics and notable defectors. L. Ron Hubbard put his wife Mary Sue Hubbard in charge of the Guardian's Office, and it was initially headquartered at Saint Hill Manor, in England. The Guardian's Office functioned effectively as an Intelligence Bureau of the Church of Scientology, and planted members in key positions within federal government agencies, in order to obtain confidential material. Most branches of the Church of Scientology soon had at least one member from the Guardian's Office on its staff, and the Guardian's Office itself had its own secret Intelligence Bureau at the top of its organizational structure. The Guardian's Office was disbanded in 1983, and the bulk of its previous functions were then assigned to the Office of Special Affairs.  Methods  Garry Scarff has said that he used to be an OSA operative. He has made a number of statements about the inner workings of OSA, many of which are disputed by the Church. In a sworn deposition taken between July and August 1993 and submitted in Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz, Scarff testified, \\"...I was directed, one, to go to Chicago, Illinois and to murder Cynthia Kisser, Cynthia Kisser being the Executive Director of the Cult Awareness Network, by a staged car accident.\\" Kisser was not killed, and Scarff said: \\"I could not bring myself to harm or kill anybody.\\" Tory Christman, a former volunteer for OSA has stated that the organization hired private investigators, fabricated criminal charges and harassed their targets, including at their place of employment, as well as their family members.Christman, Tory How the OSA trap really works March 2001 Bonnie Woods, a former member who began counselling people involved with Scientology and their families, became a target along with her husband in 1993 when the Church of Scientology started a leaflet operation denouncing her as a \\"hate campaigner\\" with demonstrators outside their home and around East Grinstead. She and her family were followed by a private investigator, and a creditor of theirs was located and provided free legal assistance to sue them into bankruptcy. After a long battle of libel suits, in 1999 the church agreed to issue an apologyApology to Bonnie Woods from the Church of Scientology and other defendants, 8 June 1999 and pay ¬£55,000 damages and ¬£100,000 costs to the Woods. Nancy Many was a high-level GO operative during Operation Freakout, and in a 2013 television interview for Dangerous Persuasions on the Discovery Channel, described intimate details of the operation to harass Paulette Cooper, including her own personal involvement. In the documentary she also explicitly confirmed the existence of \\"The Messianic Program\\", a GO interrogation program designed specifically to test the subjects reaction to the teaching that L. Ron Hubbard was \\"on level with Jesus and Buddha\\".

He plays as a lock or flanker for Yorkshire Carnegie in the RFU Championship. His rugby union career blossomed at Stockport Grammar School. He went on to take a Business Studies course at Sheffield Hallam University and was two years into it when the Sale Sharks invited him to join them. He played for Cheshire at U18 and U20 level, then briefly with Fylde before joining Sale Sharks. He made a startling rise to the England Sevens squad, and was nominated for the 2003 PRA Young Player of the Year Award. He was part of the England A team that beat France A, Scotland A and Italy A in their 2003 Six Nations and also went on the unbeaten England tour to North America and Japan that year. He played for England in the uncapped match against the Barbarians at Twickenham in May 2003. His outstanding Line-out jumping has made him a constant threat to other Premiership teams, while a series of long range tries for Sale Sharks has underlined his athletic capabilities. The year 2004 marked another leap forward. He was called up to the senior team by then head coach Clive Woodward from the start of the Six Nations. He came off the bench against Italy for his debut cap and promptly scored a try. This earned him a starting position against Scotland as a flanker and again against Wales from where he continued to impress. He was selected for the 2004 Summer tour, starting against the All Blacks in Dunedin in the first Test. Sale Sharks director of rugby Kingsley Jones referred to him as 'the most hard done-by player in England' after he was hardly used during the 2005 Autumn test series. Jones went on to collect more caps on the 2006 Summer tour of Australia and 2007 Summer tour of South Africa. In the 2005‚Äì2006 season, Jones started the final as Sale Sharks won their first ever Premiership title. He was also voted Sale's player of the year in 2006 and again in 2008. On 22 May 2014, Jones officially joined Yorkshire Carnegie in the RFU Championship on a two-year contract from the 2014-15 season.

The story centres on Lord Fancourt Babberley, an undergraduate whose friends Jack and Charley persuade him to impersonate the latter's aunt. The complications of the plot include the arrival of the real aunt and the attempts of an elderly fortune hunter to woo the bogus aunt. The play concludes with three pairs of young lovers united, along with an older pair ‚Äì Charley's real aunt and Jack's widowed father. The play was first performed at the Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds in February 1892. It then opened in London at the Royalty Theatre on 21 December 1892 and quickly transferred to the larger Globe Theatre on 30 January 1893. The production broke the historic record for longest-running play worldwide, running for 1,466 performances. It was produced by the actor W. S. Penley, a friend of Thomas, who appeared as Babberley. The play was also a success on Broadway in 1893, and in Paris, where it had further long runs. It toured internationally and has been revived continually and adapted for films and musicals. Synopsis Programme for the original London production =Act I= Jack Chesney and Charley Wykeham are undergraduates at Oxford University in love, respectively, with Kitty Verdun and Amy Spettigue. Charley receives word that his aunt, Donna Lucia d'Alvadorez, a rich widow from Brazil whom he has never met, is coming to visit him. The boys invite Amy and Kitty to lunch to meet her, also intending to declare their love to the girls, who are being sent away to Scotland with Amy's uncle, Stephen Spettigue, who is also Kitty's guardian. They seek out another Oxford undergraduate, Lord Fancourt Babberley (known as \\"Babbs\\"), to distract Donna Lucia while they romance their girls. While they are out, Babbs breaks into Jack's room to steal all his champagne, but Jack and Charley intercept him and persuade him to stay for lunch. Babbs tells the boys about his own love, the daughter of an English officer called Delahay, whom he met in Monte Carlo, although he does not remember her name. Babbs also uses Jack's room to try on his costume for an amateur play in which he is taking part. Amy and Kitty arrive to meet Jack and Charley, but Donna Lucia has not arrived yet, and so the girls leave to go shopping until she shows up. Annoyed, Jack orders Charley to go to the railway station to wait for Donna Lucia. Jack soon receives an unexpected visit from his father, Sir Francis Chesney, a retired colonel who served in India. Sir Francis reveals that he has inherited debts that have wiped out the family's fortunes; instead of going into politics as he had intended, Jack will have to accept a position in Bengal. Horrified, Jack suggests that Sir Francis should marry Donna Lucia, a widow and a millionaire, in order to clear the family debts. Sir Francis is hesitant but agrees to meet Donna Lucia before he makes a decision. W. S. Penley as the first Charley's Aunt Charley receives a telegram saying that Donna Lucia will not be arriving for a few days. The boys panic: the girls are coming, and they won't stay without a chaperone. Fortunately Babbs's costume happens to be that of an old lady. Jack and Charley introduce Babbs as Charley's aunt. His strange appearance and unchanged voice (he had never acted before) do not raise any suspicions. Babbs annoys the boys by accepting kisses from Amy and Kitty; the boys respond to his flirtations with violence. Sir Francis soon enters to meet Donna Lucia. He takes one look at Babbs and tries to leave, but Jack retrieves him. Spettigue arrives, angered that Kitty and Amy are lunching with the boys without his permission. However the penniless Spettigue soon learns that Charley's aunt is Donna Lucia D'Alvadorez, the celebrated millionaire. He decides to stay for lunch to attempt to woo \\"Donna Lucia\\". =Act II= Outside Jack's rooms, in the grounds of St Olde's College, the boys are trying to get their girls alone so that they can confess their love. However, Babbs is in the way, charming the girls as Donna Lucia. Jack's father, Sir Francis, has decided to propose marriage to Donna Lucia, purely for money. Jack urgently corners Babbs and orders him to let his father down gently. Babbs does so, which Sir Francis finds to be a relief. Spettigue still wants to marry \\"Donna Lucia\\" for her money. Meanwhile, the real Donna Lucia, who turns out to be an attractive woman of middle age, arrives with her adopted niece, Miss Ela Delahay, an orphan. The money left to Ela by her father is enough to make her independent for life. Ela reveals that her father had won a lot of money at cards from Fancourt Babberley, for whom Ela still holds a great deal of affection. Donna Lucia recounts the story of a colonel named Frank who she once met more than twenty years ago, of whom she was similarly fond. However, he was too shy to propose, and he left for India before he could tell her how he felt. Sir Francis enters, Donna Lucia recognizes him, and the two rekindle their affection. However, before she can introduce herself, she discovers that someone is impersonating her. To investigate, she introduces herself as \\"Mrs Beverly-Smythe\\", a penniless widow. Jack and Charley finally make their declarations of love to their girls. However, they discover that they need Spettigue's consent to marry. The girls enlist Babbs to get the consent from the greedy Spettigue. Spettigue invites the entire party, including the real Donna Lucia and Ela, to his house, so that he can talk to \\"Donna Lucia\\" in private. Babbs, recognizing Ela as the girl he fell in love with in Monte Carlo, tries to escape, but he is caught by Spettigue. =Act III= Babbs is upset by being in the same room as the girl he loves without being able to talk to her. Jack and Charley try to calm him down. Babbs spends time with the real Donna Lucia, Ela, Amy and Kitty, during which the real Donna Lucia embarrasses Babbs by showing how little he really knows about Donna Lucia. Ela takes a liking to the fake Donna Lucia, who sounds like the man she loves, and pours her heart out to Babbs, telling him of the anguish of losing her father and of the man who cared for him in his dying days, Lord Fancourt Babberley. She admits that she loves him and longs to see him again. Penley as Babbs in his normal clothes Babbs tricks Spettigue into giving the letter of consent for the marriages of Charley to Amy and Jack to Kitty by accepting marriage to Spettigue. (Kitty's father's will specified that if she marries without Spettigue's consent, Spettigue would inherit all of the money.) Charley can no longer keep up the lie and admits that \\"Donna Lucia\\" is not really his aunt. Babbs, now dressed in a suit, confirms that he had been playing the part of Charley's aunt. As he is about to return to Spettigue the letter of consent, the real Donna Lucia reveals her identity and takes the letter, stating that it \\"is addressed to and has been delivered to Donna Lucia d‚ÄôAlvadorez\\". Spettigue storms off, threatening to dispute the letter. Amy is upset at everyone for making a fool of her uncle. Donna Lucia reassures her and gives the girls the letter. Sir Francis and Donna Lucia are engaged (he made the proposal before he realized her identity); the young couples can marry; and Babbs confesses his feelings to Ela.

ViCAP was created in 1985 by the FBI out of Quantico, Virginia. Pierce Brooks was appointed as the first director, primarily because as a homicide detective in Los Angeles he had been the first to propose the idea. Brooks was inspired by the Harvey Glatman case he had worked on in which he realized serial homicides could be linked by their signature aspects. Brooks would later obtain a $35,000 government grant in an attempt to realize his idea. In 1982, he met with Robert Ressler to discuss the idea and was convinced by Ressler that VICAP should be located at Quantico, as opposed to Lakewood where Brooks originally planned to have it housed. It is designed to track and correlate information on violent crime, especially murder. The FBI provides the software for the database which is widely used by state and local law enforcement agencies to compile information on: * sexual assault cases * solved and unsolved homicides, especially those involving a kidnapping or if they are apparently motiveless, sexual or random or suspected to be part of a series * missing persons, where foul play is suspected * unidentified persons, where foul play is suspected Cases fitting these categories can be entered into the system by law enforcement officials and compared to other cases in an attempt to correlate and match possible connections. ViCAP has been a tool in solving many cases, including cases decades old and cases in widely separated states. ViCAP is particularly valuable in identifying and tracking serial killers, where separate victims might not otherwise be connected as part of the same pattern. The aforementioned pattern that links serial homicides is what is commonly referred to as \\"signature\\". ViCAP operates under the knowledge that serial homicides are almost always sexually- and control-driven with a consistent evolving signature present in each murder. In the summer of 2008, the ViCAP program made its database available to all law enforcement agencies through a secure internet link. This allows for real time access to the database and allows agencies to enter and update cases directly into the database.

At it had the largest-displacement engine of any production motorcycle until the release of the Triumph Rocket 3. The name \\"Rocket III\\" is derived from the 1968 BSA 750cc pushrod triple, the Rocket 3, which was a badge-engineered version of the original \\"Triumph Trident.\\" History The Rocket III Project started in 1998 led by Triumph Product Range Manager Ross Clifford and started with a lot of research ‚Äì especially in the US, where big cruisers were selling well.Motorcycle Industry Council 1998 The main competitors were the Harley-Davidson Ultraglide and the Honda Gold Wing so the initial idea was to develop a 1,600 cc performance cruiser. The in-house designer was John Mockett,moto-sprocket-gp (john mockett design and illustration) designer of the Hesketh V1000, the Tiger and the new \\"retro\\" Bonneville. He started work with David Stride, Gareth Davies and Rod Scivyer working around an in-line three cylinder engine. At the start of the project an in-line four and V6 engine configurations were looked at but the longitudinally mounted triple design led to the design concept code named C15XB Series S1. Mockett experimented with 'futuristic' styling that included \\"raygun\\" mufflers and a large chrome rear mudguard, but consumer focus groups did not like it. The S2 model was a simplified version with a more traditional rear mudguard and several features that were to make it through to the final design. Once again, the feedback from market research was that it was still too radical so the lines were simplified and smoothed out to create the Series S3. Part of the reason for the secrecy was competition from other manufacturers. Yamaha had launched the Road Star Warrior in 2002, and Honda had launched the VTX1800, so Triumph decided to up the ante and go for a displacement of 2,294 cc. The first engine was built in summer 2002 and tested in the autumn. Twin butterfly valves for each throttle body were used to increase control and allow the ECU to vary the mixture flow and ignition map according to the gear selected and speed. The specification of twin spark plugs per cylinder and multi-hole fuel injectors by Mark Jenner (fuelling, ignition and emission design engineer) allowed the Rocket III to meet the Euro IV emissions limits at launch. The torque curve is modified for each gear ratio, enabling over 90% of the engine‚Äôs torque output at 2,000 rpm, giving the high levels of flexibility that the designers needed. The 1,500 W starter motor on the Rocket III puts out as much power as the engine on the very first Triumph motorcycle, Siegfried Bettmann's 1902 single. The final design of the S3 prototype had a large tubular steel twin-spine frame, designed by James Colbrook. Andy Earnshaw was responsible for designing the gearbox and shaft drive to a 240/50ZR16 bike specific rear tyre. High specification front brakes were Daytona 955i twin four-piston callipers with 320 mm floating discs and the rear brake, developed specifically for the purpose, was a single twin piston calliper and 316 mm disc. Ride handling is controlled by purpose built rear shocks and a Triumph first, 43 mm 'inverted' front forks. 2004 NEC Motorcycle show launch In 2003, the prototype was renamed the 'Rocket', following market research, continuing the heritage of the BSA Rocket 3/Triumph Trident motorcycles. It was unveiled in the US on 20 August 2003, in San Antonio, Texas.Triumph 2004 Rocket III Announced The Rocket's European launch was at the International Motorcycle Show in Milan, Italy on 16 September 2003. Sold in the UK from the spring of 2004, it was awarded 'Machine of the Year' by Motor Cycle News at the 2004 NEC Motorcycle Show. The Australian launch was in Sydney in August 2004, with 230 deposits taken before any had been shipped into the country.Triumph Rocket III - Motorbike Review - BikePoint Reception Despite extensive market research, the Rocket III has had difficulty finding its niche. Originally intended to break into the US's lucrative cruiser market, the Triumph struggled to find acceptance among Harley-Davidson's ultra-traditional riders, who have barely come to terms with Harley-Davidson's own V-Rod. The 2009 Thunderbird competes more successfully with Harley-Davidson bikes. Triumph is spreading its focus: the Rocket III is now in the \\"musclebike\\" and \\"streetfighter\\" market, where the Yamaha V-Max has found success, while the Rocket III Touring is making inroads to the market for large touring machines. \\"Motor Cycle News\\" said of the Rocket III: \\"It is the biggest, most bad-ass motorcycle money can buy. The Triumph Rocket III is an incredible experience and bravo to Triumph for making it. Compared to a Harley, the Rocket III is a steal. It‚Äôs better braked, faster, handles better and it‚Äôs British. Secondhand values remain high and providing you keep to 3-4000 miles a year it won‚Äôt depreciate faster than a Harley, either\\". Models =Rocket III= The original model was released in 2004. This model trim is no longer available. The Rocket III Roadster is now the only version available. This model was awarded Motorcycle Cruiser magazine's 2004 Bike of the Year, Motorcyclist's 2004 Cruiser of the Year, and Cruising Rider magazine 2005 Bike of the Year. This model is the newest exhibit at the UK National Motorcycle Museum. =Rocket III Classic= Introduced in 2006, the Classic version has rider floorboards, different shaped silencers (mufflers) and 'pullback' handlebars. More colour choices were added and the pillion seat was modified to improve comfort. In June 2007, Triumph used 'viral marketing' to promote the Rocket III Classic by posting a well-made spoof production video to YouTube and bike enthusiast websites, , the video had more than 1.2 million views., viral marketing video produced by Triumph, last accessed 5 September 2012 =Rocket III Roadster= Rocket III Roadster The 2010 Roadster is the most powerful bike in the Rocket III line-up, with a claimed torque and power, as well as a dual exhaust, one per side, instead of the previous 2 and 1 layout. Triumph calls it \\"the ultimate muscle streetfighter\\". =Rocket III Tourer= The short-lived 2007 Tourer Limited Edition Model was just a Classic Model with the addition of a windscreen, panniers (saddlebags), backrest and luggage rack from the factory, and a choice of two-tone paint schemes =Rocket III Touring= Rocket III Touring (2008) Triumph began developing the Rocket III Touring version in February 2004 following the launch of the original model, to target the large cruiser market which represents 50% of all US motorcycle sales. As well as a new design for the steel frame and swinging arm, the Touring model has more torque at lower revs ‚Äì 150 lb-ft at 2500 rpm, but less horsepower at the top end @ 6,000 rpm (claimed). New features include tank mounted instruments and a scrolling switch on the handlebar to set the clock and indicate fuel ranges. The five-spoke design used on the Rocket III was replaced with billet aluminium slotted wheels and narrower tyres were specified to improve steering with a 180/70 x 16 rear tyre to make it easier to fit detachable panniers that come as standard, together with a removable windscreen and Kayaba rear shock absorbers. The Rocket III Touring was discontinued in 2017.

History SDRC was formed by engineers, led by then associate professor Dr. Jason R. Lemon, from the University of Cincinnati in 1967, as a consulting company specializing in structural dynamics, or how mechanical parts vibrate. US Steel was a primary customer and early investor, until selling their shares to General Electric in the early 80's. To aid in its consulting, the company wrote software to simulate and predict vibration. Companies began asking for rights to use this software, and thus SDRC entered the software market. In the 70s, SDRC became known as a Finite Element and Modelling company, and during the 80s and 90s became one of the leading companies in solid modeling and analysis. SDRC (Lemon) is well known globally as one of the first to coin the term \\"MCAE\\" (Mechanical Computer Aided Engineering) in the 70's. Dr. Lemon left SDRC in 1982 to form a new start up in 1983, International TechneGroup Incorporated; focused on applying CAE early in product development to lead design, a methodology known as CP/PD (Concurrent Product and Process Development). Among several technologies pioneered by SDRC, it was one of the first companies to introduce a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solution, as a result of its joint venture with Control Data. The product, Metaphase, eventually became the sole property of SDRC. Financial Scandal On September 14, 1994, SDRC announced that it would be forced to restate its previously-announced earnings. Months later, it was revealed that the Company had overstated its revenue over the three previous years by a combined total of $68 million, citing improprieties in its Far East reseller operations. After the scheme was disclosed, $30 million in SDRC software was discovered in a warehouse at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. = Company executives fined = On April 11, 1997, the former chairman of SDRC and four other former company executives agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle charges that the Milford software company artificially inflated earnings and revenues from 1992 to 1994. Vice president Tony Tolani paid the government $1 million; Chairman/CEO Ron Friedsam was fined $100,000; CFO Ron Hoffman paid $200,000, VP Robert Fischer, $157,000; and Controller Dick LaJoie, $25,000. The resulting class-action shareholder lawsuit was settled on November 21, 1997, with SDRC agreeing to pay $37.5 million in payouts to affected shareholders. = Auditors sanctioned = The SEC also sanctioned the KPMG audit partners responsible for independent audits of company financials at the time. Philip Present and William Scanlon were sanctioned by the SEC, with restrictions on their accounting practice and ability to represent public companies imposed by SEC action. \\" Present and Scanlon were also aware that audit differences, representing 22% of the net income originally reported by SDRC for 1993, were not reflected in SDRC's 1993 financial statements\\"SEC citation Acquisition SDRC was purchased by EDS in 2001 for a reported $950 million. SDRC was merged with EDS subsidiary UGS Corp.. The new combined company operated as EDS PLM Solutions from 2001 through 2004. EDS sold off its CAD/PLM software business to a group of private equity firms in 2004. The new UGS Corp. operated as an independent, privately held company before being purchased by Siemens AG in 2007. Products I-DEAS was SDRC's computer-aided design software package. SDRC was bought by Electronic Data Systems in 2001. Unigraphics and I-DEAS were merged into one product, NX. I-DEAS is still published by Siemens PLM Software (formerly known as UGS Corp). Metaphase was SDRC's product lifecycle management product. It was designed and best suited for managing CAD data.

The composition which has gained him most recognition is his orchestral Symphony No. 5¬Ω, A Symphony for Fun. Biography Gillis was born in Cameron, Missouri. His family moved to Fort Worth, Texas, and he studied at Texas Christian University, playing trombone and acting as assistant director of the university band. He graduated in 1935, and obtained a master's degree from North Texas State University in 1943. He became production director for the radio station WBAP, later moving to NBC where he became producer for the NBC Symphony Orchestra during the tenure of its conductor Arturo Toscanini. He held several teaching posts at academic institutions in the southern United States during his career, and also helped to found the Symphony of the Air orchestra. Gillis produced several NBC radio programs, including \\"Serenade to America\\" and \\"NBC Concert Hour.\\" After Toscanini retired in 1954 Gillis, serving as president of the Symphony Foundation of America, was instrumental in helping to form the Symphony of the Air, using members of the old NBC Symphony. Gillis also produced the radio program \\"Toscanini: The Man Behind the Legend,\\" which ran for several years on NBC after the Italian conductor's death. In 1973 he joined the faculty of the University of South Carolina where he founded, and was chairman of the Institute for Media Arts and was instrumental in establishing the Instructional Services Center. Dr. Gillis also served as USC's Composer-in-residence until his death. He died in Columbia, South Carolina, on January 10, 1978. His papers and an extensive collection of recorded material are housed at the University of North Texas in Denton. Music Despite his administrative responsibilities, Gillis was a prolific composer, writing ten orchestral symphonies, tone poems like Portrait of a Frontier Town, piano concertos, rhapsodies for harp and orchestra, and six string quartets. He also composed a wide variety of band music. Gillis is best remembered as the composer of his Symphony No. 5¬Ω, A Symphony for Fun, originally performed by Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra during a September 21, 1947, broadcast concert that Gillis also produced; it was preserved on transcription discs but not commercially issued. Since 2005, his symphonies have been recorded on the Albany Records label. Gillis sought to interpret contemporary American culture musically. His music drew upon popular material, particularly emphasizing jazz, which he considered a revitalizing element in American music. He assimilated popular influences in a simple and straightforward style aimed at communicating with his audiences through an emphasis on clear, accessible, melodic writing. Many of his works are best characterized as fun and full of humor.

It travels along the Pacific Coast between two junctions with U.S. Route 101 (US 101) in Raymond to the south and Aberdeen in the north. The highway also has two spur routes: a road serving the city of Westport on Grays Harbor and a short connector in Aberdeen. Route description SR 105 begins at an intersection with US 101 on the north bank of the Willapa River in Raymond, about north of the western terminus of SR 6\\\\. The highway follows Park Avenue through Raymond's northern residential neighborhoods and turns southwest to follow the Willapa River downstream and opposite from US 101\\\\. It turns northwest to follow the river as it approaches its mouth at the east end of Willapa Bay and passes Willapa Harbor Airport. SR 105 continues west along the Willapa Bay estuary, crossing over North River near the Smith Creek State Wildlife Recreation Area and following the foothills of the Willapa Hills. The highway continues west through the Shoalwater Bay Indian Reservation, located northwest of Tokeland and Dexter by the Sea, and turns north at North Cove on the Pacific Coast. The highway continues along the coast and passes through Grayland Beach State Park and the beachside community of Grayland in Grays Harbor County. It turns east at Cohassett Beach near Twin Harbors State Park while a spur route continues north to the city of Westport at the mouth of Grays Harbor. SR 105 travels east along the South Bay of Grays Harbor, crossing over the Elk River and the Johns River at Markham. The highway then passes through Ocosta and near the Stafford Creek Corrections Center before entering the city limits of Aberdeen. SR 105 turns north onto Boone Street near the Grays Harbor College campus and the Shoppes at Riverside shopping mall. The road expands to five lanes as it passes through the commercial and residential areas of southern Aberdeen and turns northwest after Marion Street, continuing for one block until reaching the terminus of SR 105 at a junction with US 101 on the southern bank of the Chehalis River. SR 105 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on state highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. The highway's daily vehicle counts in 2016 ranges from a minimum of 970 vehicles near Tokeland to a maximum of 17,000 in southern Aberdeen. SR 105 is designated by the state government as the Cranberry Coast Scenic Byway, recognizing the area's cranberry industry. The highway is also a signed tsunami evacuation route for Westport and Grayland. Spur routes State Route 105 Spur (more specifically referred to by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) as \\"State Route 105 Spur Westport\\") is a spur of State Route 105 that goes north into the town of Westport, USA. It snakes through the city streets, initially as Forrest Street, finally ending at the harbor. The SR 105/105 Spur junction is about 5 miles (8 km) north of Grayland, Washington, immediately adjacent to Twin Harbors State Park. The spur is long. WSDOT estimates that daily traffic on the spur route ranges from 1,000 vehicles at its northern terminus to 5,400 at Montesano Street. State Route 105 Spur can also refer to a section of the Aberdeen-area SR 105/U.S. Route 101 junction specifically referred to by WSDOT as \\"State Route 105 Spur Boone\\". WSDOT estimates that traffic counts on the Boone spur range from 1,200 to 1,700 vehicles. History A section of SR 105 near Cape Shoalwater that was abandoned and bypassed in the 1990s due to coastline erosion SR 105 follows the Aberdeen‚ÄìTokeland Highway, which was constructed in the 1920s to connect Tokeland and Westport to Aberdeen. It was added to the state highway system in 1937 as Secondary State Highway 13A (SSH 13A), the lone branch of Primary State Highway 13, with a spur route serving Westport and plans to extend the main road from Tokeland to Raymond. Construction of the Tokeland‚ÄìRaymond highway was delayed until the early 1950s despite lobbying from local interests. The rugged terrain, difficult soil conditions, and weather issues delayed completion until the 1960s. The final section of SSH 13A, between Tokeland and Raymond, was opened in 1962. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, SSH 13A was assigned the designation of SR 105. Part of the new coastal highway was eroded away in the late 1960s, leading to the first of several re-location projects. Between Grayland and Tokeland, SR 105 had to be re-routed inland in the 1990s from Cape Shoalwater, due to currents coming out of Willapa Bay causing severe erosion, taking many acres of land out to sea.

It covers of land, and looks after of water. Strategically located as North America's first inbound and last outbound gateway, the port of Halifax is a naturally deep, wide, ice-free harbour with minimal tides and is two days closer to Europe and one day closer to Southeast Asia (via the Suez Canal) than any other North American East Coast port. In addition, it is one of just a few eastern seaboard ports able to accommodate and service fully laden post-Panamax container ships using the latest technology. With 17 of the world's top shipping lines calling the port, including transshipment, feeder ship services and direct access to Canadian National Railway (CN) inland network, the port of Halifax is connected virtually to every market in North America and over 150 countries worldwide supporting the delivery of all types of cargoes. Annually the port handles over 1,500 vessels, generates 15,000 jobs and $2 billion in economic impact. Halifax is one of Canada's top four container ports in terms of the volume of cargo handled. History After the Royal Navy withdrew from Halifax in 1905, the dockyards were handed over to the Government of Canada. Prior to World War I, the government began the Ocean Terminals project. A new railway was built through the city's South End to service the modern piers, the first of which opened in the early 1920s. Shipping grew sharply during World War II. With the containerisation revolution of shipping, it was decided to build a container terminal in Halifax. The South End Container Terminal opened in the South End in 1969 at the site of the former Seaward Defence Base. A specialised vehicular processing facility, the Autoport, was opened in 1971. It provides various pre-distribution services in addition to basic loading and off- loading. The number of vehicles handled annually by the Autoport has grown from 100,000 in 1979 to about 185,000 today. By the late 1970s the South End Container Terminal was operating at capacity, handling more tonnage than any other container terminal in Canada. A second container terminal at Fairview Cove was therefore built at a cost of $47 million and opened in 1982. It was originally a single-berth facility, and operations were contracted out to Cerescorp Inc. The terminal has since been expanded. In 2003, Ceres (now a subsidiary of Nippon Yusen) successfully bid on a continued operations contract, effective January 1, 2003 for 20 years. In 2005 the Fairview Cove Container Terminal berth depth was deepened to (as deep as the New Panama Canal). In 2012 a major expansion of the South End Container Terminal was completed. The depth of the berth was increased from and the pier was extended. In June 2017 it welcomed its first Neopanamax vessel, the ZIM Antwerp.Brett Bundale, Port of Halifax to welcome massive container ship the length of Canada‚Äôs tallest skyscraper, The Canadian Press (via Toronto Star), June 27, 2017 Administration Many major port facilities are owned by the Halifax Port Authority (HPA), a port authority operating as a federally regulated Crown corporation of the Government of Canada. HPA has responsibility of managing 260 acres federally owned marine industrial land in Halifax Harbour. The HPA was created on March 1, 1999 and succeeds the Halifax Port Corporation (HPC). HPC was the successor to the National Harbours Board, which operated all federally owned ports in Canada.

It is the first album to feature Matt DeVries on rhythm guitar. The album is a noted for its groove metal-oriented sound, especially when compared to the band's previous releases which were considered closer to the nu metal genre.Chimaira the Impossibility of Reason Lambgoat Upon release, it debuted No. 117 on the Billboard 200 charts. To date the album has sold around 200,000 copies in the US. A limited edition version of The Impossibility of Reason was released in 2004, which included a bonus disc called Reasoning the Impossible. The song \\"Army of Me\\" appeared on the Freddy vs. Jason soundtrack. Production The Impossibility of Reason was recorded with six-string guitars in drop C tuning, a standard that future albums would follow, and deemphasizes electronic effects. Rob Arnold later explained that the higher tuning allows \\"much more clarity and power to the attack\\" in comparison to the murky drop A tuning used on Pass Out of Existence.Holland, Brian D. Rob Arnold Interview Modern Guitars Magazine (August 21, 2007). Retrieved on 12-04-10. Thus, the album has been considered heavier than Chimaira's 2001 debut, yet still bears a melodic side. Vocalist Mark Hunter noted the album's musical growth and credited the influence of band's they toured with. He also elaborated that while the sampling featured in their previous album was \\"ear candy,\\" it would be more focused to \\"enhance the music\\" on their 2003 effort. Chimaira would continue their progression of heaviness with future albums. In an interview, Hunter described The Impossibility of Reason and compared it with the band's prior release: :\\"With the new album we give the listener a feeling like they can‚Äôt breathe, the songs pound you continuous.

Early days At the age of ten, he broke his arm falling from a tree. Because of this injury he had a jerky bowling action, which some considered suspicious.Gideon Haigh, The Summer Game, Text, Melbourne, 1997, p. 132. He bowled off-cutters more than conventional off breaks. He was particularly dangerous on matting wickets where he got prodigious turn. He began his first- class career in 1943-44, and played occasionally for Gujarat before establishing his place in the 1950-51 season, when he took 5 for 43 and 6 for 61 against Baroda, and 8 for 53 and 5 for 28 against Services. His batting was usually negligible, but in the Ranji Trophy final in 1950-51 against Holkar, he came in at 167 for 8 in the second innings and hit 152 in two hours, adding 136 in 90 minutes for the tenth wicket with Hasan Nakhuda. It was his only century. He played once for India against the Commonwealth XI in 1953-54, and toured Pakistan the following season, taking 35 wickets at an average of 10.71, including 4 for 22 and 8 for 25 against Pakistan Universities. He made his Test debut in the Fifth Test, taking three wickets. He played another Test against New Zealand in 1955-56, then two against Australia in 1956-57. These four Tests yielded 10 wickets at 31.00. He was 35 and on the verge of retirement when he enjoyed his one great success against Australia at Kanpur in 1959-60. Australia came to India on the back of convincing wins over England and Pakistan. For India, the loss in the first Test of the series was their fifth innings defeat of the year. Kanpur had a newly laid pitch. Patel was picked as a gamble, on the insistence of the chairman of selectors, Lala Amarnath. \\"Patel's Test\\" India was out for 152 before close on the first day. Patel got his first wicket on the second morning when he caught Gavin Stevens left-handed off an attempted big hit. At lunch, Australia were well on top at 128 for 1. Till that point of time, Patel had bowled from the city end, where he had not been able to exploit the footmarks created by the left arm bowlers Alan Davidson and Ian Meckiff. Amarnath presumably had a word with the captain, Ramchand, during lunch. Patel switched to the pavilion end after the break. Patel's first ball after lunch went between the bat and pad to bowl Colin McDonald. Norman O'Neill who replaced him was all at sea and offered an easy chance to Bapu Nadkarni at midwicket, who missed it. This was to deprive Patel of a chance to take all ten wickets. Neil Harvey completed fifty before he was bowled. Patel pitched one well outside left-handed Harvey's off-stump. Harvey raised the bat and left it but the ball cut back and hit the stumps. Once Harvey was out, the others followed quickly. Davidson hit out at the end to take the score to 219. O'Neill, bowled by a full-toss from Chandu Borde, was the only wicket that Patel missed. His figures were 9 for 69. India batted much better in the second innings to set Australia 225 to win in 400 minutes. Patel dismissed Stevens, and Polly Umrigar took the important wicket of Harvey before the close of the fourth day. Umrigar took two more wickets on the final morning to reduce Australia to 61 for 4. Patel took four of the remaining five wickets, Gordon Rorke being unable to bat. Australia was all out for 105 and India won by 119 runs. It was India's first win over Australia. Patel's 14 for 124 remained the best Test bowling figures by an Indian bowler for nearly thirty years until they were bettered by Narendra Hirwani. Patel's 9 for 69 stood as the best bowling in a Test innings by an Indian bowler till Anil Kumble took 10 for 74 forty years later. Remaining career The Kanpur Test stayed as the lone bright spot in Patel's Test career. He played two more Tests in the series for five wickets. They were his last Test matches. He played two more years of first class cricket and ended up with 140 wickets for Gujarat in the Ranji Trophy. He and Vijay Hazare were the first cricketers to be honoured with the Padma Shri.

The goal of this mechanism is to ensure zero packet loss in the presence of network congestion. The first flow control mechanism, the pause frame, was defined by the IEEE 802.3x standard. The follow-on priority-based flow control, as defined in the IEEE 802.1Qbb standard, provides a link-level flow control mechanism that can be controlled independently for each class of service (CoS), as defined by IEEE P802.1p and is applicable to data center bridging (DCB) networks, and to allow for prioritization of voice over IP (VoIP), video over IP, and database synchronization traffic over default data traffic and bulk file transfers. Description A sending station (computer or network switch) may be transmitting data faster than the other end of the link can accept it. Using flow control, the receiving station can signal the sender requesting suspension of transmissions until the receiver catches up. Flow control on Ethernet can be implemented at the data link layer. The first flow control mechanism, the pause frame, was defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) task force that defined full duplex Ethernet link segments. The IEEE standard 802.3x was issued in 1997. =Pause frame= An overwhelmed network node can send a pause frame, which halts the transmission of the sender for a specified period of time. A media access control (MAC) frame (EtherType 0x8808) is used to carry the pause command, with the Control opcode set to 0x0001 (hexadecimal). Only stations configured for full-duplex operation may send PAUSE frames. When a station wishes to pause the other end of a link, it sends a pause frame to either the unique 48-bit destination address of this link or to the 48-bit reserved multicast address of . The use of a well-known address makes it unnecessary for a station to discover and store the address of the station at the other end of the link. Another advantage of using this multicast address arises from the use of flow control between network switches. The particular multicast address used is selected from a range of address which have been reserved by the IEEE 802.1D standard which specifies the operation of switches used for bridging. Normally, a frame with a multicast destination sent to a switch will be forwarded out to all other ports of the switch. However, this range of multicast address is special and will not be forwarded by an 802.1D-compliant switch. Instead, frames sent to this range are understood to be frames meant to be acted upon only within the switch. A pause frame includes the period of pause time being requested, in the form of a two-byte (16-bit), unsigned integer (0 through 65535). This number is the requested duration of the pause. The pause time is measured in units of pause \\"quanta\\", where each unit is equal to 512 bit times. By 1999, several vendors supported receiving pause frames, but fewer implemented sending them. Vendor comments on flow control in the 1999 test. =Issues= One original motivation for the pause frame was to handle network interface controllers (NICs) that did not have enough buffering to handle full-speed reception. This problem is not as common with advances in bus speeds and memory sizes. A more likely scenario is network congestion within a switch. For example, a flow can come into a switch on a higher speed link than the one it goes out, or several flows can come in over two or more links that total more than an output link's bandwidth. These will eventually exhaust any amount of buffering in the switch. However, blocking the sending link will cause all flows over that link to be delayed, even those that are not causing any congestion. This situation is a case of head-of-line blocking (HOL), and can happen more often in core network switches due to the large numbers of flows generally being aggregated. Many switches use a technique called virtual output queues to eliminate the HOL blocking internally, so will never send pause frames. Subsequent efforts =Congestion management= Another effort began in March 2004, and in May 2004 it became the IEEE P802.3ar Congestion Management Task Force. In May 2006 the objectives of the task force were revised to specify a mechanism to limit the transmitted data rate at about 1% granularity. The request was withdrawn and the task force was disbanded in 2008. =Priority flow control= Ethernet flow control disturbs the Ethernet class of service (defined in IEEE 802.1p), as the data of all priorities are stopped to clear the existing buffers which might also consist of low priority data. As a remedy to this problem, Cisco Systems defined their own priority flow control extension to the standard protocol. This mechanism uses 14 bytes of the 42-byte padding in a regular pause frame. The MAC control opcode for a Priority pause frame is 0x0101. Unlike the original pause, Priority pause indicates the pause time in quanta for each of eight priority classes separately. The extension was subsequently standardized by the Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) project authorized on March 27, 2008 as IEEE 802.1Qbb. Draft 2.3 was proposed on June 7, 2010. Claudio DeSanti of Cisco was editor. The effort was part of the data center bridging task group, which developed Fibre Channel over Ethernet.

President George Washington spent the night of May 17, 1791, in Waynesboro. A stone monument on Liberty Street marks the historical site; it stands in front of the Golden Pantry (formerly Kwik Stop).http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/tdgh-may/may17.htm On December 4, 1864, the Civil War Battle of Waynesboro was fought just south of the town. Forces under Union General Judson Kilpatrick prevented troops led by Confederate General Joseph Wheeler from interfering with Union General William T. Sherman's campaign to destroy a wide swathe of the South on his march to Savannah, Georgia, and the Atlantic Ocean. Geography Waynesboro is located in the center of Burke County at (33.090482, -82.015404). U.S. Route 25 bypasses the city on the east side, while State Route 121 passes through the center as Liberty Street. To the north it is to downtown Augusta, and to the south it is to Statesboro. According to the United States Census Bureau, Waynesboro has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.96%, is water. The city's elevation is above sea level. Pine, oak, dogwood, and other trees found in the South are in Waynesboro. Demographics As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 5,766 people living in the city.

Economy =Nuclear power plant= On February 2, 2010, President Obama was expected to announce a total of $8.3 billion in federal loan guarantees to build and operate a pair of nuclear reactors in Burke County by Southern Company, an Atlanta-based energy company. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) offered Southern Company's subsidiary, Georgia Power, a conditional commitment for loan guarantees for the construction of the nation's first nuclear power units in more than 30 years. The new units will be located at Plant Vogtle along the Savannah River east of Waynesboro, where the company already owns and operates two nuclear units. The conditional commitment is for loan guarantees that would apply to future borrowings related to the construction of Vogtle units 3 and 4.http://newsblaze.com/story/2010021608210200002.pnw/topstory.html Arts and culture The Burke County Museum traces the area's history, from plantation life to the establishment of agribusiness.

Often these tags are removable by chemical agents or by enzymatic means, such as proteolysis or intein splicing. Tags are attached to proteins for various purposes. Affinity tags are appended to proteins so that they can be purified from their crude biological source using an affinity technique. These include chitin binding protein (CBP), maltose binding protein (MBP), Strep-tag and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The poly(His) tag is a widely used protein tag, which binds to metal matrices. Solubilization tags are used, especially for recombinant proteins expressed in chaperone-deficient species such as E. coli, to assist in the proper folding in proteins and keep them from precipitating. These include thioredoxin (TRX) and poly(NANP). Some affinity tags have a dual role as a solubilization agent, such as MBP, and GST. Chromatography tags are used to alter chromatographic properties of the protein to afford different resolution across a particular separation technique. Often, these consist of polyanionic amino acids, such as FLAG-tag. Epitope tags are short peptide sequences which are chosen because high- affinity antibodies can be reliably produced in many different species. These are usually derived from viral genes, which explain their high immunoreactivity. Epitope tags include ALFA-tag, V5-tag, Myc-tag, HA-tag, Spot-tag, T7-tag and NE-tag. These tags are particularly useful for western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation experiments, although they also find use in antibody purification. Fluorescence tags are used to give visual readout on a protein. GFP and its variants are the most commonly used fluorescence tags. More advanced applications of GFP include using it as a folding reporter (fluorescent if folded, colorless if not). Protein tags may allow specific enzymatic modification (such as biotinylation by biotin ligase) or chemical modification (such as reaction with FlAsH-EDT2 for fluorescence imaging). Often tags are combined, in order to connect proteins to multiple other components. However, with the addition of each tag comes the risk that the native function of the protein may be abolished or compromised by interactions with the tag. Therefore, after purification, tags are sometimes removed by specific proteolysis (e.g. by TEV protease, Thrombin, Factor Xa or Enteropeptidase).

PAPA is currently a brand owned and operated by the Replay Foundation and is based in Scott Township, Pennsylvania, just outside Pittsburgh. The main activity of the organization is hosting the annual World Pinball Championships and Pinburgh Match-Play Championship. Each event brings hundreds of serious pinball players from around the world to compete for a number of large cash prizes. The World Pinball Championships run for four days and allow competitors to register in different divisions which accommodate beginners and skilled players alike. Each occurrence of the World Pinball Championships has been denoted by a number; for example, the 2010 tournament is known as PAPA 13. The Pinburgh Match-Play Championship resurrects the name given to a previous Pittsburgh-area pinball tournament, and has a different structure. Players pay one entry fee and compete in multiple rounds directly against other players for two days, before a day of finals is played in three divisions, along with a consolation tournament for players who do not make the finals. History PAPA was originally created by Steve Epstein, owner of the former Broadway Arcade in Manhattan.All About PAPA PAPA 6 was the last tournament organized under his tenure. The PAPA organization was transferred to Kevin Martin in January 2004 and its moniker applied to the pinball tournaments formerly held under the name of Pinburgh; PAPA 7 was the first of these, held in 2004. In September 2004, shortly after PAPA 7, the remnants of Hurricane Ivan flooded the tournament area, ruining more than 200 games. However, the organizers managed to restock and rebuild in time to host PAPA 8 in 2005. Tournament format The format of the World Pinball Championships has changed over time. In the current format, players declare a division (A, B, or C, with A being the most skilled) and may enter as many times as they like, paying entry fees each time they choose to play. During an entry, a player will choose and play a certain number of games from a predetermined bank of machines (for example, five out of a possible nine machines). Each game score is assigned a point value based on how it compares to all of the other entries on that same machine: 100 points for the highest score, down to 1 point for 88th place, and 0 points for all lower scores. This point value may decrease over time as more games are played by everyone. An entry's overall score is the sum of these point values; thus, it too can decrease over time. A player's best entry over the course of the qualifying period determines the player's qualifying score, and the qualifying scores are used to determine the rank of each player. A player's rank may go up or down, even without continuing to play more entries. There is a fair amount of strategy that can be employed to deal with this. At the end of the qualifying period (typically several days), the top-ranked players in each division (the actual number varies) compete in a head-to-head, bracketed format to determine the winners. The tournament also includes a Juniors division (16 years or younger), a Seniors division (50 years or older), and a Classics division that runs on multiple days of the event. In 2014, the Juniors division was changed to be three tournaments run on consecutive days, similar to the Classics division. In 2015 a D division was added, specifically targeting very new players who had only played a limited amount of competitive pinball. In order to qualify for D division, a player needed to have a world ranking of 7500 or lower.  Tournament machine configurations  If possible, the game software of each machine is put into tournament mode. Typically, this means that the rules will avoid giving random awards, so that scores reflect mostly skill and not luck. Also, extra balls are disabled if the software supports it. The physical setup of the machines is also configured to make things as challenging as possible. This can be done in a number of ways, for example: * Adjusting or removing outlane posts, which make the side drain gaps larger. * Increasing the playfield angle (by adjusting the legs on the cabinet). This increases ball speed and makes it more difficult to make shots in the back of the playfield. * Making the \\"tilt\\" mechanism more strict, allowing less nudging and shaking of the machine.

Association"},{"id":"2521005","text":"The Dallas Mavericks (also known as the Mavs) are a professional basketball team based in Dallas, Texas, USA, belonging to the NBA. In their history, the Mavericks have won one NBA championship, three division titles, and two conference championships.  History  = 1979-1981: Beginnings = In 1979, businessman Don Carter and partner Norm Sonju requested the right to bring an NBA franchise to Dallas. The last professional basketball team in Dallas had been the Dallas Chaparrals of the American Basketball Association, which moved to San Antonio in 1973 to become the San Antonio Spurs. At the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, league owners voted to admit the new team, with the team's name coming from the 1957-1962 television western Maverick. The name was chosen by the fans with 4600 postcards received beating Wranglers and Express. James Garner, who played the namesake character, was a member of the ownership group. There was some controversy at the time since the University of Texas at Arlington also uses the Mavericks nickname. The Dallas Mavericks joined the Midwest Division of the Western Conference, where they would stay until the league went to six divisions for the 2004-05 season. Dick Motta, who had guided the Washington Bullets to the NBA Championship in 1977-78, was hired as the team's first head coach. He had a well-earned reputation of being a stern disciplinarian, but was also a great teacher of the game. Kiki Vandeweghe of UCLA was drafted by the Mavs with the 11th pick of the 1980 NBA draft, but Vandeweghe refused to play for the expansion Mavericks and staged a holdout that lasted a month into the team's inaugural season. Vandeweghe was traded to the Denver Nuggets, along with a first-round pick in 1981, in exchange for two future first-round picks that eventually materialized into Rolando Blackman in 1981 and Sam Vincent in 1985. Mavs' founder Don Carter. In the Mavericks' debut game, taking place in the brand-new Reunion Arena, the Mavericks stunned the Spurs, 103-92\\\\. But the Mavs started the season with a discouraging 6-40 record on their way to finishing 15-67\\\\. However, the Mavericks did make a player acquisition that, while it seemed minor at the time, turned out to play a very important role in the early years of their franchise. Journeyman 6'3\\" guard Brad Davis, who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, was tracked down and signed by the Mavs in December. At the time, there was absolutely no reason to expect that Davis would be any better than the expansion-level talent the Mavs had. But he started the Mavs' final 26 games, led the team in assists, and his career soared. He spent the next twelve years with the Mavericks, and eventually his #15 jersey was retired. The 1981 NBA Draft brought three players who would become vital parts of the team. The Mavs selected 6'6\\" forward Mark Aguirre with the first pick, 6'6\\" guard Rolando Blackman 9th, and 6'7\\" forward Jay Vincent 24th. By the end of his seven-year Mavs career, Aguirre would average 24.6 points per game. Blackman contributed 19.2 points over his 11-year career in Dallas. But it was Jay Vincent who made the biggest difference for the Mavs in their second season, leading the team in scoring with 21.4 points per game and earning NBA All-Rookie Team honors. The Mavericks improved to 28-54, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished on top of the Utah Jazz. = 1982-1985: Rise to power = In 1982-83, the Mavericks were serious contenders for the first time. At the All- Star break, they were 25-24 and had won 12 of their last 15 games. They could not sustain this momentum, and finishing seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference. But the Mavs' 38‚Äì44 record signified a 10-game improvement from the previous season, and the fact that a third-year expansion team had even been in playoff contention at all was quite remarkable. Mark Aguirre led the 1982-83 Mavericks with 24.4 points per game, finishing sixth in the NBA. Jay Vincent and Rolando Blackman contributed 18.7 and 17.7 ppg, respectively. Brad Davis was 10th in the NBA in assists with 7.2 per game, and shot .845 from the line, 6th in the league. Derek Harper was drafted by the Mavs with the 11th pick of the 1983 NBA draft. The 6'4\\" guard would spend the next decade with the organization, averaging 15 points and 6.1 assists. The Mavericks' hard work paid off in 1983-84 as they posted a winning record for the first time in franchise history, finishing 43-39 and second in the Midwest Division. The Mavs also earned the first playoff berth in franchise history. Mark Aguirre was named the team's first NBA All-Star, as he finished with an average of 29.5 points per game‚Äîsecond in the league only to Utah's Adrian Dantley. Dallas finished with the fourth seed in the Western Conference playoffs, and their first playoff trip was modestly successful as they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in five games. The fifth and deciding game of that series was played at Moody Coliseum, as Reunion Arena, then the home court for the Mavericks, was hosting a tennis tournament. The Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles Lakers were next for the Mavs, and the young club fell short, losing four games to one. But a trade the Mavericks made in their inaugural season of 1980 paid off for them in 1984, because they owned Cleveland's first-round pick, which ended up being the fourth pick overall. The Mavs used it to select forward/center Sam Perkins, a former North Carolina Tar Heel with surprising range from the three-point line who would average 14.4 points and 8.0 rebounds in six seasons with Dallas. About this time, the Dallas Cowboys, once one of the NFL's elite teams, began a slow decline that eventually saw them fall to 1‚Äì15 in 1989. The Mavs were hitting their stride at about the same time, and replaced the Cowboys as the Metroplex' team. The 1984‚Äì85 team finished a game better than the previous year at 44‚Äì38. Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, Sam Perkins made the All- Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1985 NBA All-Star Game. The Mavs returned to the playoffs in 1985, but were not as successful as they had been the previous year. They won Game 1 in double- overtime against the Portland Trail Blazers in their first-round playoff series, but lost the next three games in a row, ending their season. = 1985-1988: A true contender = Dallas had the eighth pick in the 1985 NBA draft‚Äîagain due to a trade with the Cavaliers‚Äîand drafted German-born forward Detlef Schrempf out of Washington. He would show flashes of brilliance in his three-plus seasons with the team, but it was not until he was traded to the Indiana Pacers that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center Kurt Nimphius to the Los Angeles Clippers for center James Donaldson, who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the 1991-92 season. This allowed the Mavericks to have the steady hand at center that had been lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson would represent the only All-Star center in Dallas Maverick history. Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1986 NBA All-Star Game, hosted by Dallas at Reunion Arena. The 1985-86 Mavericks were second in scoring at 115.3 points per game, gaining them their third straight playoff appearance. They defeated Utah three games to one in the first round. In the conference semi- finals, they ran into the Lakers again, and L.A. defeated Dallas in six games. But four of those games were decided by four points or less, and Dallas won half of those, leaving Mavericks fans room to hope that they could finally top the Lakers in the following season. The Mavs drafted Michigan center Roy Tarpley with the seventh overall pick, who would go on to become a very talented‚Äîbut troubled‚Äîmember of the roster. The 1986-87 Mavericks team had their most successful regular-season to date, going 55-27 and winning their first Midwest Division title. But despite the great expectations surrounding the team, they self-destructed in the playoffs. After hammering the Seattle SuperSonics by 22 points in Game 1, the bottom dropped out for the Mavs, as they lost Games 2 and 3 in close fashion before succumbing in Game 4 in Seattle. Following the unexpected early playoff exit, Motta, who had been with the team since its inception, shockingly resigned as head coach. John MacLeod, who had led the Phoenix Suns to nine playoff berths in 11 seasons including an NBA Finals run in 1976, was hired as his replacement. The 1987‚Äì88 NBA season saw the Mavericks dip just a little bit in the regular season‚Äîfinishing 53-29 and losing their Midwest Division title to the Denver Nuggets‚Äîbut it was another successful year for the team. Mark Aguirre and James Donaldson both played in the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, the Mavericks rattled off a franchise- best 11-game winning streak, and Rolando Blackman scored his 10,000th career point. Aguirre led the team in scoring for the sixth consecutive year with 25.1 points per game, and Roy Tarpley won the NBA Sixth Man Award with averages of 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. The season saw the Mavs' deepest playoff run to date. They dispatched the Houston Rockets in four games and the Nuggets in six, leaving only the defending NBA Champion Lakers between them and their first-ever trip to the NBA Finals. The Mavericks gave the Lakers everything they could handle, but in the end the more experienced Lakers prevailed, defeating Dallas in seven games on the way to eventually winning their second consecutive NBA Championship. = 1988-1990: Injuries sting Mavs = Despite all the changes, the Mavs remained in contention. However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson went down with a ruptured patella tendon on March 10, 1989 and missed the rest of the season as a result. The Mavericks were left undermanned, demoralized and disheartened as they finished with a 38-44 record, losing the eighth and final playoff seed in the Western Conference via tiebreaker to the Denver Nuggets. It was their first losing season since 1982-83‚Äîwhich was also the last time they missed the playoffs. The Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 1989‚Äì90 with a 47‚Äì35 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos. On November 15, only six games into the Mavs' season, Tarpley was arrested for driving while intoxicated and resisting arrest. The team started 5‚Äì6 and MacLeod was fired, replaced by assistant coach Richie Adubato. The Mavs finished the season with four straight victories to surge into the playoffs, but went down rather meekly to the Portland Trail Blazers in three games. It would be the team's last winning season and last playoff appearance until 2001. = 1990-1993: Free-falling = The team endured numerous changes in 1990, losing Sam Perkins to the Lakers via free agency and suffering injuries to practically their entire 1990‚Äì91 starting lineup. The players they managed to acquire‚ÄîRodney McCray, Fat Lever and Alex English‚Äîwere all in the twilight of their careers. On March 9 it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own which ended his season. The Mavericks' season only got worse from there, and they finished with a record of 28‚Äì54, the worst in the NBA, falling behind even the second-year Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic. In March 1991, Tarpley was charged with suspicion of driving while intoxicated and was suspended again by the NBA. It got even worse in 1991‚Äì92. Before the season even began, Tarpley violated the league's substance abuse policy for the third time and was banned from the NBA for life. The former Sixth Man Award winner's fall from grace was complete. The few talented players the Mavericks had remaining to them were lost to injury. Brad Davis' back problems forced him to retire in mid-January, and Fat Lever had knee surgery again on January 29, missing the remainder of the season‚Äîhardly worth the cost of losing two first- round draft picks. The team finished with a 22‚Äì60 record. In 1992-93 the rebuilding began in earnest, with the Mavs trading Rolando Blackman‚Äîwho by that point had surpassed Mark Aguirre as the team's all-time leading scorer‚Äîto the New York Knicks for a first-round draft pick. Blackman had made four All- Star Game appearances in his Mavericks career. Herb Williams joined the Knicks as a free agent. Fat Lever underwent more surgery and missed the entire 1992‚Äì93 season. Derek Harper was the team's sole bright spot, leading the team with 18.3 points per game. = 1992-1994: Flirting with futility = The Mavericks selected Ohio State guard Jim Jackson with the fourth overall pick of the 1992 NBA draft, but he and owner Donald Carter could not come to terms on a contract for half of his rookie season. Jackson only played 28 games in 1992‚Äì93, a year that was also ruined by trades, a coaching change and injuries. The Mavericks started 2-27 and fired Adubato on January 13, replacing him with Gar Heard. The Mavericks came dangerously close to setting the all-time worst record in NBA history (at the time, 9-73 by the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers). But when Jackson was signed on March 3, the Mavs managed to rally, closing the season with a 7‚Äì14 mark, including two straight wins to end the season. That year the Mavericks finished 11‚Äì71 which was the 2nd worst record in NBA history. Dallas selected Kentucky forward Jamal Mashburn with the fourth overall pick of the 1993 NBA draft and hired Quinn Buckner as coach, but the team's progress was minimal. Part of the problem was that Buckner decided from the start to be a disciplinarian on the model of his college coach, Bobby Knight. The mostly young roster did not respond very well to Buckner's stern coaching style, and started 1‚Äì23. By the end of January they were 3‚Äì40, and it was once again possible that they could tie the 1973 Sixers for the all-time worst record in the league. But 5‚Äì9 records in February and April, coupled with Buckner loosening the reins a little bit, helped the Mavs finish 13‚Äì69. It was still by far the worst record in the league, but the Mavericks again avoided setting an all-time futility record. They did, however manage to tie the NBA's single-season record for consecutive losses at 20 games (since broken). Buckner was fired after garnering the worst full-season record for a rookie head coach‚Äîa record that only lasted two years, until Bill Hanzlik broke it with the Denver Nuggets. The Mavericks brought back Dick Motta, who had led the franchise to some of its most successful seasons. The Mavericks also wound up with the #2 pick in the 1994 NBA draft, and picked up Cal point guard Jason Kidd, giving them a solid tandem of Jackson, Mashburn and Kidd which would become known as \\"The Three Js\\". = 1994-1996: Three Js give Dallas hope = The addition of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with new life in 1994‚Äì95. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists in his rookie season, and even led the league in triple-doubles. Roy Tarpley was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points, but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February which caused him to miss the remainder of the regular season. Second-year forward Popeye Jones had a great year as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds. The Mavericks' improvement was dramatic. They jumped to 36‚Äì46, 10th in the Western Conference and only five games behind the Denver Nuggets for the eighth and final playoff spot. It was the biggest one-year improvement in the team's history, and the highest in the NBA that season. Many expected the Mavericks' improvement to continue with the franchise's first foray into the NBA Playoffs since 1990. But despite a 4‚Äì0 start, the 1995‚Äì96 season was a disappointment in about every conceivable way. For the second time in his career, Roy Tarpley was given a lifelong ban from the NBA for repeated violations of the anti-drug policy‚Äîhe never played in the NBA again. Jamal Mashburn had season-ending surgery to repair his sore right knee only 18 games into the Mavericks' schedule. The team's two remaining stars, Jason Kidd and Jim Jackson, bickered throughout the season, though neither of them had any trouble establishing his individual stardom. Jackson led the team in scoring with 19.6 ppg, made 121 three-pointers and was the only Mav to start in all 82 games. Kidd became the first Maverick to be elected a starter in the NBA All-Star Game, and finished second in the league in assists and fourth in steals while averaging 16.6 ppg. George McCloud, who averaged 9.6 ppg in his previous year, blew away his career-high scoring average as the Mavs resorted to the outside shot time and again due to their lack of an inside scoring threat. McCloud averaged 18.9 ppg and made 257 three-pointers, equaling the second-highest individual season total in league history. Overall, the Mavericks connected on 735 of their 2,039 three-point attempts, both new league records. But that particular statistic is more indicative of the Mavs' desperation to get points from somewhere than of how well they did as a team. The Mavs finished 26‚Äì56, fifth in the Midwest Division and 33 games out of first place. At season's end, Motta was relieved of his head coaching responsibilities and replaced by former Bulls assistant coach Jim Cleamons. And Don Carter, the only owner the Mavericks had ever had, sold the team to a group of investors led by H. Ross Perot, Jr. = 1996-2001: Dirk/Cuban comes to town = The 1996‚Äì97 season was a year of transition for the Mavericks, as they basically redesigned their entire team; 27 different players saw action for this Dallas team, setting an all-time NBA record. By the time the season was over, only rookie forward Samaki Walker remained from the opening-day roster. The first big move came in December, as Jason Kidd, Loren Meyer and Tony Dumas were traded to the Phoenix Suns for guards Michael Finley and Sam Cassell and forward A. C. Green. By far the most important of these acquisitions was Finley who, after his first half-season in Dallas, would go on to average over or near 20 ppg for at least the next seven years of his Mavericks career. He made two visits to the NBA All-Star Game, and even played in each of the Mavs' games until the 2004‚Äì05 season. Don Nelson was hired as Dallas' general manager on February 7, and it didn't take him long to leave his own mark on the team. Within a week of his hiring, the Mavs had released Fred Roberts and Oliver Miller and traded Jamal Mashburn to the Miami Heat for forwards Kurt Thomas and Martin M√º√ºrsepp and guard Sasha Daniloviƒá. This particular trade didn't really pan out for the Mavs. Thomas did not play in 1996‚Äì97, and only ended up playing in five games as a Maverick before signing as a free agent with the New York Knicks. Daniloviƒá played in 13 games for the Mavs before opting out of his contract and signing with Bucker Bologna of the Italian League, and M√º√ºrsepp played in 73 games for the Mavericks over the next two years before leaving the NBA. Chris Gatling was the Mavericks' sole representative in the NBA All-Star Game, but he did not last much longer in Dallas. In one of the largest two-team trades in NBA history, the Mavericks traded Chris Gatling, Jim Jackson, Sam Cassell, George McCloud and Eric Montross to the New Jersey Nets for 7'6\\" center Shawn Bradley, forward Ed O'Bannon and guards Khalid Reeves and Robert Pack. Nelson claimed the trades were necessary because the situation in the locker room was unacceptable. However, whereas Cassell went on to become a consistent floor leader and Jackson, Gatling and McCloud all continued to be solid contributors to their teams for several more years, only Bradley lasted any sort of time in Dallas and would spend part of the next eight years putting up modest contributions for the Mavs and giving them solid numbers in terms of blocked shots. Undrafted rookie guard Erick Strickland was a pleasant surprise for the Mavs as he averaged 10.6 ppg. He, along with Finley and Bradley, were expected to be the core of this new Mavericks team. The constant changes made it impossible to establish any sort of team chemistry in 1996‚Äì97, and the Mavericks finished 24‚Äì58. But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come. In 1997‚Äì98, despite a poor record of 20‚Äì62, Dallas had a knack for giving some of the NBA's elite teams a hard time, as they beat the Seattle SuperSonics, New York Knicks, Indiana Pacers and Chicago Bulls. Against the Bulls, Dallas went on a 17‚Äì2 run to force overtime, where they won 104‚Äì97. Midway through that season, Nelson fired Cleamons and named himself head coach. In the lockout-shortened 1998‚Äì99 season, the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19‚Äì31 record, but Michael Finley and Gary Trent put up solid numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15‚Äì10) since 1989‚Äì90. Notable were the acquisitions of power forward Dirk Nowitzki and point guard Steve Nash, two seemingly unspectacular moves which would make a great impact in the future. In the following season the team finally \\"clicked\\" and started to win on a consistent basis. Led by Finley, the Mavericks earned their first 40-win season since 1989‚Äì90. He was greatly helped by Nowitzki, who finally \\"arrived\\" in the NBA and established himself as a potent offensive threat. On January 14, 2000, Ross Perot's group sold the Dallas Mavericks to internet entrepreneur and season ticket-holder Mark Cuban for $285 million. Cuban immediately set out to revitalize the Mavericks and increase the team's popularity in Dallas and nationwide. His controversial moves (he allowed Dennis Rodman to live in his house for a week before temporarily signing him) and outspoken personality quickly made him a fan favorite in Dallas and garnered the team much press in the national media. He has also been fined millions of dollars for violating NBA rules. In 2000‚Äì01, the Mavericks improved further and finished with an impressive 53‚Äì29 record, fueled by an impressive offensive triangle of Nowitzki, Finley and Nash. The Mavs made a blockbuster trade minutes before the trade deadline that sent Hubert Davis, Christian Laettner, Courtney Alexander, Loy Vaught, and Etan Thomas to the Washington Wizards for Juwan Howard, Calvin Booth and Obinna Ekezie. This move brought in fresh blood that secured the club's first playoff visit in 11 years. Also, Wang Zhizhi became the first Chinese player to play in the NBA, signing with the Mavs in January, along with the Eduardo N√°jera, bringing Dallas a decent international cast that included Canada's Nash and Germany's Nowitzki. In the playoffs, the Mavericks won the first round against the Utah Jazz, advancing to the second round for the first time since 1988. Even though they would be eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games, it marked a sense of optimism for Dallas in seriously contending for an NBA title. This was also the last season in the old Reunion Arena before making the move to the modern American Airlines Center. = 2001-2004: \\"Big Three\\" of Nash, Nowitzki, and Finley = These years also saw Nowitzki win the first two of his five consecutive Euroscar Awards as the top player in Europe, in 2002 and 2003. (Note that this award is presented at the end of a calendar year, as opposed to the end of the season as in the NBA awards.)  2001‚Äì02  The 2001-02 season was a great season for the Mavericks, with a 57‚Äì25 record and many sellout crowds in the American Airlines Center. This season also saw a change in logo and colors, changing from the cowboy hat logo and green to a new horse logo. In addition, the team gained sleeker uniforms. Another blockbuster trade sent Juwan Howard, Tim Hardaway and Donnell Harvey to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Raef LaFrentz, Nick Van Exel, Tariq Abdul-Wahad and Avery Johnson, the Mavericks also made several attempts to sign the Utah Jazz's star Karl Malone. The Mavericks swept the Kevin Garnett- led Minnesota Timberwolves in the playoffs but lost again in the second round, this time to the Chris Webber-led Sacramento Kings.  2002‚Äì03  But it was only in the next season when the Mavericks finally broke through. They started the 2002‚Äì03 season with a 14‚Äì0 record which was 1 shy of tying the NBA record set by the 1993‚Äì94 Houston Rockets (15‚Äì0). The Mavericks finished with a 60‚Äì22 record in the regular season, astonishing fans and critics with their sparkling offense. The \\"Big Three\\" Nowitzki, Finley, and Nash were a 100-point-game waiting to happen and led the Mavericks into the Conference Finals against the Tim Duncan-led San Antonio Spurs. However, with the series tied 1‚Äì1 Dirk Nowitzki, the team's leading scorer, suffered a knee injury in game three that kept him out of the rest of the series. This worsened the Mavs depth problem in the front court (both of their backup centers were injured for the entire series) and the Spurs took the series in 6 games.  2003‚Äì04  In 2003‚Äì04, two blockbuster trades were announced. The Mavericks acquired Antawn Jamison, Danny Fortson, Ji≈ô√≠ Welsch and Chris Mills from Golden State in exchange for Nick Van Exel, Evan Eschmeyer, Popeye Jones, Avery Johnson and Antoine Rigaudeau. Another high-profile trade sent Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills and Ji≈ô√≠ Welsch to Boston for Antoine Walker and Tony Delk. Although the team struggled with chemistry, the Mavericks easily qualified for the playoffs. With the trio Nowitzki-Finley-Nash and NBA Sixth Man of the Year Jamison, the Mavericks continued their reputation as the best offensive team in the NBA. Notable were two rookies, Josh Howard and Marquis Daniels, who made an immediate impact. However, the Mavericks were eliminated quickly in the playoffs, losing in the first round to the Chris Webber-led Sacramento Kings, a team which clearly played better defense. The Mavericks management had to re-evaluate their strategy. = 2004-2006: Roster changes =  2004‚Äì05  The 2004-05 season brought in blockbuster trades which (among others) brought in burly center Erick Dampier, combo guard Jason Terry, speedy rookie point guard Devin Harris, scoring machine Jerry Stackhouse, and defensive stalwart Alan Henderson. Although the loss of All-Star Steve Nash via free agency visibly hurt the Mavericks' offense, the new acquisitions strengthened the team defense. The run-and-gun style of former times changed into a more balanced style of play. At the All-Star break, the Mavericks acquired Keith Van Horn for Calvin Booth and Henderson, the latter resigning only days later. Nowitzki added his third consecutive Euroscar during this season as well. On March 19, longtime coach Don Nelson resigned and his assistant Avery Johnson succeeded him. Under Johnson's tutelage, the defense of the Mavericks became stronger and they easily qualified for the playoffs with an impressive 58‚Äì24 record. The Mavericks defeated the Houston Rockets in Round 1 of the playoffs in 7 games but then lost to the Phoenix Suns 4‚Äì2, led by former Maverick star Steve Nash.  2005‚Äì06: First finals appearance  Prior to the 2005 NBA draft, the Mavericks had traded all their picks away and were left empty- handed. On August 15, 2005, veteran guard Michael Finley was waived under the new \\"Allan Houston Rule\\". Under this rule, the Orlando Magic waived Doug Christie, who then signed with the Mavericks. On August 19, the Mavericks held a press conference announcing they had re-signed Darrell Armstrong, and introduced Christie, DeSagana Diop, Rawle Marshall, and Josh Powell as new Mavericks. Christie's playing time was very limited amidst a surgically repaired ankle still hampering his play. He was waived on November 25, 2005. At the end of calendar 2005, Nowitzki achieved a rare double by winning both the Euroscar and Mr. Europa, a second prestigious award for the top European player. He additionally was named the inaugural FIBA Europe Player of the Year. Up until the very end of the season, the Mavericks would be toe-to-toe with the San Antonio Spurs for the crown of the Southwest Division as well as the #1 spot in the Western Conference. However, they fell short of the title and had to settle for a fourth seed. Nonetheless, they once again achieved a 60‚Äì22 record, with Avery Johnson winning NBA Coach of the Year honors. In the playoffs, they swept the Memphis Grizzlies, leading to a titanic series against their state rivals and the reigning NBA champions the San Antonio Spurs. Five out of the seven games were decided in the last minute, including a Game 7 that had to go into overtime, with the Mavs prevailing under the guidance of Dirk Nowitzki and an incredibly deep bench. The Mavericks were able to advance to the Conference Finals against former teammate Steve Nash and the Phoenix Suns. The Mavs' defense and depth enabled them to take the series, as they defeated the Phoenix Suns in game 6 of the Western Conference Finals on June 3, 2006 in the US Airways Center in Phoenix, and the Mavs advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history. In the NBA Finals, the Mavericks faced the Miami Heat, held home-court advantage and scored two convincing wins. After game 2, Dallas city officials had already planned the victory parade. However, in Game 3, the Mavs blew a late double-digit lead, courtesy of Heat guard Dwyane Wade. He carried the Heat to the win, with Nowitzki missing a potentially game-tying free throw in the last seconds. After getting blown out in Game 4, the Mavericks suffered another loss in Game 5 when Wade scored the game-tying basket in the last possession of regular time, putting the Heat ahead with last-second free throws in overtime. The tragic figure was Josh Howard, who missed a pair of clutch free throws in overtime and mistakenly called an early timeout, so the Mavs had to bring in the ball at backcourt rather than halfcourt for the last possession. In Game 6, the Mavericks took an early double digit lead, but again, Wade poured in 36 points, helped by Alonzo Mourning's five blocked shots, and the Mavericks lost their fourth game and the title after a string of botched three-pointers. Many Mavericks fans were stunned by the defeat. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was fined a total of $250,000 for \\"several acts of misconduct\\" during the series, and Nowitzki was fined $5,000 for kicking a ball into the stands after Game 5. Nowitzki was also caught by TV cameras attacking a stationary bicycle in the hallway outside of the Mavericks locker room. Jerry Stackhouse was suspended for Game 5 after fouling Shaquille O'Neal on a breakaway dunk attempt. The latter marked the third time a Mavericks player was suspended in the 2006 playoffs. The Mavericks became only the third team in NBA history (the first since 1977) to lose in the Finals after taking a 2‚Äì0 lead. In Game 3, the Mavs held a 13-point lead with under seven minutes remaining but were outscored 22‚Äì7 in the momentum-changing 98‚Äì96 defeat. The Heat's performance in the last seven minutes represented the team's greatest postseason comeback in team history. = 2006-2010: First round exits = After a disappointing end to their magnificent playoff run in 2006, the Mavericks sought retribution in the new season. After a rocky 0‚Äì4 start, the Mavericks then went on a historic run and posted a 52‚Äì5 record over their next 57 games. They finished out the regular season with a record of 67‚Äì15, good enough to be tied for 6th place all-time, 1st in the league and the #1 seed in the Western Conference playoffs. Dirk Nowitzki had a dominant season, further cementing his place as one of the game's elite players; he won his fifth consecutive Euroscar during the season, and was named the NBA MVP at its end. Josh Howard was named to the all-star team. However, the first place Mavericks were defeated in 6 games by the 8th seeded Golden State Warriors, which is regarded by some as one of the biggest upsets in NBA history, while others don't consider it an upset at all. The Mavs were exposed defensively, and the Warriors systematically dismantled the Mavericks by exploiting matchups and preying on Dirk Nowitzki's weaknesses. Former NBA champion and All-Star legend Bill Russell stated in his NBA.com blog that he didn't consider it to be an upset, since Golden State was 3-0 vs. the Mavericks in the regular season. On the year, the Mavericks went 67‚Äì12 against the rest of the league and 0‚Äì3 against Golden State, giving credibility to Russell's belief that the Warriors' win shouldn't have surprised NBA fans. Ironically, the Warriors were coached by Don Nelson, the immediate past manager/coach of the Mavericks until he stepped down at the end of 2005‚Äì06, and he had been appointed head coach of the Warriors in the 2006‚Äì07 midseason Nowitzki's winning of regular season MVP honors and his team's stunning first-round exit created an awkward dilemma regarding the MVP trophy ceremony. Traditionally, the MVP award is given to the winner in a ceremony between the first and second round of the playoffs. But it has been believed that the league opted to put some distance between the MVP presentation and the Mavericks' elimination against the Warriors. By the time Nowitzki collected his MVP award, nearly two weeks had elapsed since the Mavs were ousted in the playoffs.  2007‚Äì08  Kidd drives to the basket during a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Mavericks dealt Devin Harris, two first round picks and others in a blockbuster trade to the New Jersey Nets for veteran all-star Jason Kidd and other role players, Cuban also tried to sign the free agent Kevin Garnett unsuccessfully. The Mavericks were 3 and 11 against winning teams since the trade and lost Nowitzki for a little over a week due to a high ankle sprain injury. He returned April 2 in a crucial game against the Golden State Warriors in a 111‚Äì86 Mavericks victory and helped defeat the Phoenix Suns in a 105‚Äì98 win on April 6. This win in Phoenix was especially significant because the Mavs had been nearly unable to defeat a contending team on the road the entire season. Continuing their playoff push, Dirk hit a crucial three-pointer with 0.9 seconds left, defeating the Utah Jazz 97-94 on April 10. This victory guaranteed them a playoff spot and their 8th consecutive 50-win season. The Mavericks ended the season with a record of 51‚Äì31. In the first round of the playoffs, the Mavericks were eliminated once again, by the New Orleans Hornets 4-1 on the road, 99-94\\\\. Just one day after a disappointing season ended, Avery Johnson was dismissed as Head Coach of the Dallas Mavericks. On May 9, 2008, Rick Carlisle was hired as the head coach.Dallas Mavericks, Carlisle seem to like potential match  Dallas Mavericks News  Sports News  Dallas Morning NewsDeal with Dallas Mavericks, Carlisle could come today  WFAA.com  Sports: Basketball: Mavericks ESPN ‚Äì Sources: Carlisle, Mavs reach agreement on 4-year deal ‚Äì NBAAFP: Mavericks reach four-year coaching deal with Carlisle  2008‚Äì09  After getting off to a rocky start at 2‚Äì7, the Mavericks eventually found themselves with the sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for 2009. This was after going 50-32 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season) and about three to four weeks earlier, weren't even sure if they were going to make the eighth and final spot. A run of 5‚Äì1 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. Dirk Nowitzki also entered the postseason with a streak of 25 consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in the first game of the quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, San Antonio Spurs. The Mavericks surprised many people by winning Game 1, 105‚Äì97 in San Antonio. The Spurs quickly won game two in a rout. As the series shifted to Dallas, who had only lost one game there after the All-Star Break, won both Games 3 and 4. San Antonio was just trying to win Game 5 to extend the series, but they couldn't do it as the Mavericks closed out the series with a 13-point-victory, 106‚Äì93. With the Victory, the Mavericks advanced to the Conference Semi-finals for the first time since 2006. In the semifinals, they would face the two-seeded Denver Nuggets, who were fresh off an easy 4‚Äì1 series win against the New Orleans Hornets, including a 58-point win in New Orleans. The Mavericks would stay close with the Nuggets in the first three quarters of Games 1 and 2, but it was the fourth quarter where Carmelo Anthony and the Nuggets would finally wake up, as they took the first two games by double-digit figures. Game 3 in Dallas was close the whole way, and Dallas seemed to be going on to win, leading by five points with less than a minute to go. But Carmelo Anthony hit a cold-blooded three-pointer to give the Nuggets a 106‚Äì105 victory. The play generated quite a bit of controversy, because Maverick guard Antoine Wright clearly fouled Anthony, but since there is no replay used in the NBA, the Mavericks suffered a heart breaking game 3 loss. It was later announced by the league that the referees made the wrong call, but despite this the Mavericks still faced a 3‚Äì0 deficit in the series. 44 points in Game 4 from Dirk Nowitzki would save the Mavericks season, sending the series back to Denver for a Game 5, the series in Denver's favor, 3‚Äì1. Game 5 would prove to be the final game for the Mavericks of the 2009 season, as they would be ousted by a score of 124‚Äì110. The elimination led to an off-season facing many questions about the future construction of the team.  2009‚Äì10: Return to the elites  After a disappointing loss to the Nuggets in the playoffs, the Mavericks entered the off-season with many questions about the future construction of the team. They began by re-signing Jason Kidd to a three-year contract extension, which took care of their pending point guard issue. The Mavericks also made a move to compound their age problem, by trading for former all-star small forward Shawn Marion. In a three-team deal with the Grizzlies and Raptors, the Mavericks sent swing-man Antoine Wright along with defensive stalwart Devean George to Toronto, while aging guard Jerry Stackhouse landed in Memphis. Dallas also acquired burly center Nathan Jawai, and Kris Humphries. Many analysts viewed this as a beneficial trade for the Mavericks, being that it countered their age issues, while simultaneously providing them with more depth on the bench. The Mavericks also added veteran forwards Tim Thomas, Drew Gooden, and Quinton Ross. Jason Terry. These moves proved successful, because after dropping the season opener to the Wizards, the Mavericks went on to beat many contenders such as the Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Houston Rockets, and the Phoenix Suns which was something that the Mavericks had been unable to do the last two seasons. A day before the trade deadline, the Mavericks instigated a block-buster deal. The trade sent Josh Howard, James Singleton, and Drew Gooden to the Washington Wizards in exchange for Caron Butler, Brendan Haywood, and Deshawn Stevenson. The Mavericks felt that this trade was necessary due to Howard's declining performance and apparent unhappiness with the Mavericks organization. Many NBA analysts felt that this was a good move, because not only did it remove a disgruntled Howard from the line-up, it simultaneously brought Dirk Nowitzki a quality supporting cast, with many believing that the Mavs could contend for a title after the trade went through. The trade clearly worked, because the new- look Mavericks came out of the all-star break with a vengeance. On January 24, 2010, the Dallas Mavericks routed The New York Knicks 128‚Äì78. This was the third largest margin of victory in NBA history. The previous largest margin of victory for the Mavericks was 45 points. After dropping the second-half opener to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Mavericks went on to win 13-straight games before losing to the New York Knicks. On April 10, the Mavericks clinched the Southwest division after defeating the Portland Trail Blazers 83‚Äì77. The Mavericks finished the season with an impressive 55‚Äì27 record, good enough for the second seed in the Western Conference. The Mavericks then entered the post-season with quite a bit of optimism and an assurance that they could seriously contend for a title. During the playoffs though, this optimism proved to be short lived, because after winning game one 100‚Äì94, behind Nowitzki's 36-point performance, the Mavericks dropped the next three games to their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, before winning game five. Dallas would eventually lose against San Antonio in six games 97‚Äì87, leading to yet another off-season full of speculation, mostly centering on franchise player Dirk Nowitzki's pending free agent status.  2010 Offseason  After yet another first round melt-down, the Mavericks began an unexpectedly early offseason. The first order of business for Mark Cuban and the Mavericks was to re-sign Dirk Nowitzki, and did so on July 4, 2010, when the Mavericks and Dirk agreed to a 4-year deal worth $80M. On July 13, the Dallas Mavericks after losing the opportunity to sign LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Amar'e Stoudemire acquired centers Tyson Chandler and Alexis Ajinca from the Charlotte Bobcats for center Erick Dampier, forward Eduardo N√°jera and guard Matt Carroll. = 2010‚Äì2011 season: Championship season = The 2010‚Äì11 campaign saw the Mavericks fly out of the gate, winning 24 out of their first 29 games. However, on December 27, Dirk Nowitzki sustained a knee injury that derailed the Mavericks momentum, combined with the team's second-leading scorer Caron Butler suffering a season-ending knee injury himself only four nights later, raising questions of if the Mavericks could make it 11 straight 50-win seasons. The Mavericks then went on to drop their next seven games, causing serious concern as to who would lead the offense in Nowitzki's absence. This however would prove to only be a temporary setback because Nowitzki only missed nine games, and admittedly rushed back to assist the Mavericks' reeling offense, and consequently they quickly returned to their winning ways. The Mavericks re-invented their defensive reputation around the league during the 2010‚Äì11 campaign, mostly in part to off-season acquisition Tyson Chandler (who was later named to the All-Defensive Second Team). The Mavericks battled the San Antonio Spurs all season long for the division title, but instead settled for the 3rd seed, with a 57‚Äì25 record. However, due to the Mavericks reputation as playoff chokers, many predicted them to be ousted in the first round against the six-seeded Portland Trail Blazers. Yahoo! Sports analyst Adrian Wojnarowski even went so far as to predict a sweep for the Trail Blazers. The Mavs entered the post-season as the 3rd seed and despite toting a 57‚Äì25 record, were predicted by the media to be ousted by the injury-riddled Trail Blazers. The Mavericks won games 1 and 2 on their home floor in convincing fashion, however upon their arrival to the Rose Garden in Portland, problems began to arise. After dropping game three to Portland, the Mavericks blew a 23-point fourth-quarter lead in game four to allow Portland to tie the series at two games apiece. The whispers then began to re-surface that the Mavericks were going to allow another impressive regular season to go down the drain. The Mavericks then responded, posting back-to-back wins to oust the Blazers in six games. They then met the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference Semifinals. This series was the first time that Kobe Bryant had met Dirk Nowitzki in a playoff series and was expected to be extremely competitive; that however did not prove to be the case. The Mavericks shocked the NBA world by winning the first two games in Los Angeles, and took a two games to none lead heading back to Dallas. They then won a thrilling game three in Dallas, courtesy of 32 points from Nowitzki in a 98‚Äì92 victory. The Mavericks then provided the perfect exclamation mark, crushing the Lakers in game 4 by a score of 122‚Äì86. In that game, Jason Terry set an NBA playoff record with nine three-pointers with just one miss, ousting the Lakers in a four-game sweep. The Mavericks then met the upstart Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals. Dirk Nowitzki set the tone in the series in game one with a 48-point performance, with the Mavericks taking game 1 by a score of 121‚Äì112. The Thunder then responded with 106‚Äì100 victory in game 2. The Mavericks then won the next three games, including a 15-point comeback in game 4, to take the series in five games. The Mavericks claimed their second Western Conference Championship in franchise history, and met the team that defeated them in the 2006 NBA Finals, the Miami Heat. The Mavs entered the 2010‚Äì2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miami's \\"Big Three\\" coming together during the course of the 2010‚Äì11 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92‚Äì84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88‚Äì73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0‚Äì2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22‚Äì5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88‚Äì86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat with a 112‚Äì103 victory, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105‚Äì95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \\"soft\\", and putting an end to the Mavericks post-season futility. = 2011-2018: Post-championship decline = The following season was cut to 66 games due to a lockout, which meant the Mavericks had to wait until Christmas Day to raise their first championship banner. During the brief offseason owner Mark Cuban decided to maintain financial flexibility by letting key contributors Tyson Chandler, DeShawn Stevenson, J.J. Barea and Caron Butler go. Chandler signed with the New York Knicks, Stevenson joined the New Jersey Nets, Barea went to the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Butler joined the Los Angeles Clippers. Meanwhile, they acquired incumbent NBA Sixth Man of the Year Lamar Odom via a trade with the Lakers, while signing veterans Vince Carter and Delonte West. The Mavericks raised their championship banner prior to their Finals rematch with the Heat on Christmas Day, but in what would soon become a mirror image of the 2006‚Äì07 Heat's eventual failed title defense, Miami blew them out in a 105‚Äì94 loss, marking Dallas's first regular season loss to Miami in eight seasons. Things didn't get better for Dallas after starting the season 0‚Äì3, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks started off on a high note, winning 13 of 18 games in January, but they limped to a 22‚Äì22 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing 7th with a 36‚Äì30 record, their lowest finish since the 2007‚Äì08 season. Nowitzki normed just 21.6 points, 6 rebounds and 45.7% shooting, his lowest numbers since the 2000‚Äì01 season. Meanwhile, Odom proved to be a bad fit for the Mavericks, and they decided to sit him out for the final two months of the season. In a rematch from last year, the Mavericks faced the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the 2012 NBA Playoffs. Games 1 and 2 went down the wire, but the Mavericks' fell short on both occasions as Kevin Durant bailed the Thunder out with a game-winning jumper in Game 1, and late-game free throws in Game 2. Back in Dallas for Game 3, the Mavericks fell flat throughout the game and suffered a humiliating 95‚Äì79 defeat to fall behind 0‚Äì3. With their backs behind the wall in Game 4, the Mavericks led for much of the second half, but James Harden's 15-point fourth quarter rallied the Thunder to a 103‚Äì97 win and eliminated the Mavericks from contention. It marked the first time Dallas was swept in a seven-game series, and became the third defending champion to be swept in the first round after the aforementioned 2006‚Äì07 Heat and the 1956‚Äì57 Philadelphia Warriors. = 2018-present: The Luka Donƒçiƒá era = The Mavericks finished the 2017-18 season with a 24-58 record, their worst in twenty years. In the 2018 NBA draft, the Mavericks were awarded the fifth pick. With their eyes on Slovenian guard Luka Donƒçiƒá, a projected top-three pick, the Mavericks worked out a deal with the Atlanta Hawks, who owned the third pick. The Hawks agreed to draft Donƒçiƒá for Dallas, while the Mavericks drafted point guard Trae Young for Atlanta. The two teams traded the draft rights to their selections, with the Mavericks packaging in a top-5 protected 2019 first round pick.

In Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, free induction decay (FID) is the observable NMR signal generated by non-equilibrium nuclear spin magnetization precessing about the magnetic field (conventionally along z). This non-equilibrium magnetization can be created generally by applying a pulse of radio-frequency close to the Larmor frequency of the nuclear spins. If the magnetization vector has a non- zero component in the xy plane, then the precessing magnetisation will induce a corresponding oscillating voltage in a detection coil surrounding the sample. This time-domain signal is typically digitised and then Fourier transformed in order to obtain a frequency spectrum of the NMR signal i.e. the NMR spectrum. The duration of the NMR signal is ultimately limited by T2 relaxation, but mutual interference of the different NMR frequencies present also causes the signal to be damped more quickly. When NMR frequencies are well-resolved, as is typically the case in the NMR of samples in solution, the overall decay of the FID is relaxation-limited and the FID is approximately exponential (with the time constant T2 changed, indicated by T2*). FID durations will then be of the order of seconds for nuclei such as 1H. Particularly if a limited number of frequency components are present, the FID may be analysed directly for quantitative determinations of physical properties, such as hydrogen content in aviation fuel, solid and liquid ratio in dairy products (time-domain NMR). Advances in the development of quantum- scale sensors, particularly NV centres, have enabled the observation of the FID of single nuclei. When measuring the precession of a single nucleus, quantum mechanical measurement back action has to be considered. In this special case, also the measurement itself contributes to the decay as predicted by quantum mechanics.

J. utahensis) is a shrub or small tree reaching 3‚Äì6 m (rarely to 9 m) tall. It is native to the southwestern United States, in Utah, Nevada, Arizona, western New Mexico, western Colorado, Wyoming, southern Montana, southern Idaho and eastern California. It grows at moderate altitudes of , on dry soils, often together with Pinus monophylla. Utah Juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) leaves, female cones and male cones, and (center) galls The shoots are fairly thick compared to most junipers, 1.5‚Äì2 mm diameter. The leaves are arranged in opposite decussate pairs or whorls of three; the adult leaves are scale-like, 1‚Äì2 mm long (to 5 mm on lead shoots) and broad. The juvenile leaves (on young seedlings only) are needle-like, 5‚Äì10 mm long. The cones are berry-like, in diameter, blue-brown with a whitish waxy bloom, and contain a single seed (rarely two); they mature in about 18 months and are eaten by birds and small mammals. The male cones are long, and shed their pollen in early spring. It is largely dioecious with both sexes on the same plant, but around 10% of plants are monoecious, producing cones of only one sex. Utah Juniper gallsThe plants frequently bear numerous galls caused by the Juniper Tip Midge Oligotrophus betheli (Bibionomorpha: Cecidomyiidae); these are conspicuous pale violet-purple, produced in clusters of 5‚Äì20 together, each gall diameter, with dense modified spreading scale-leaves long and broad at the base. Seeds are dispersed by a variety of mammals and birds. Mammals include jackrabbits (mostly the black-tailed jackrabbit Lepus californicus spp.) rodents and to a lesser extent by coyotes (Canis latrans). Most notable among the birds that disperse juniper berries is the Townsend's Solitaire (Myadestes townsendi). Juniperus osteosperma seedling along I-80 in northeastern Nevada Native Americans such as the Havasupai used the bark for a variety of purposes, including beds, and ate the cones both fresh and in cakes. The Havasupai used the gum to make a protective covering over wounds. Additionally, the Yavapai gave their women a tea made from the leaves to calm their contractions after giving birth, and fumigated them with smoke from the leaves placed over hot coals. The Navajo sweep their tracks with boughs from the trees so death will not follow them. Utah juniper is an aromatic plant. Essential oil extracted from the trunk and limb is prominent in Œ±-pinene, Œ¥-3-carene, and cis-thujopsene. Essential oil extracted from the leaf is prominent in camphor and bornyl acetate.

The Marian exiles were English Protestants who fled to Continental Europe during the 1553‚Äì1558 reign of the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I and King Philip.Leo F. Solt (1990) Church and State in Early Modern England, 1509-1640, Oxford University Press, USA George Edwin Horr (1910) \\"The Marian Exiles\\", Papers of the American Society of Church History, 2nd series, Vol.2, p.201, Putnam's, New York and London (Digitized by Google Books)Christina Hallowell Garrett (1938) Marian Exiles: A Study in the Origins of Elizabethan Puritanism, Cambridge University Press They settled chiefly in Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany, and also in France, Italy and Poland. Exile communities According to English historian John Strype, more than 800 Protestants fled to the continent, mainly to the Low Countries, Germany, and Switzerland, and joined with reformed churches there or formed their own congregations. A few exiles went to Scotland, Denmark, and other Scandinavian countries. Notable English exile communities were located in the cities of Aarau, Basel, Cologne, Duisburg, Emden, Frankfurt, Geneva, Padua, Strasbourg, Venice, Wesel, Worms, and Z√ºrich. The exiles did not plan to remain on the continent any longer than was necessary; there was considerable controversy and anxiety among them and those who remained in England over the legitimacy of fleeing, rather than facing, religious persecution. This concern contributed to the attention and authority given to those who remained in England and were martyred, as in the writings of one of the most famous exiles, John Foxe. During their continental sojourn, few of the exiles became well integrated economically or politically into their new communities. With the exception of the exile community in Aarau, the majority of exiles were clergy (67) or theological students (119). The next largest group was composed of gentry (166) who, with others back in England, financed the exiles. This group included Elizabeth Berkeley (Countess of Ormond), Sir Peter Carew, William Cecil, Sir John Cheke, Sir Anthony Cooke, Sir Francis Knollys, Sir Richard Morrison, Dame Dorothy Stafford, and Sir Thomas Wroth. Of about 500 known English exiles, there were 40 merchants, 32 artisans, 7 printers, 3 lawyers, 3 physicians, 3 yeomen, 13 servants, and 19 men with no profession. Of the artisans 12‚Äì17 were weavers who settled in Aarau. Strype names London merchant and exile Thomas Heton (or Heyton, Eaton) as the host-general of all the exiles. Financial backers for the exiles included London merchants Richard Springham and John Abel. Support also came from the King of Denmark, the Prince Palatine of the Rhine, the Duke of W√ºrttemberg, the Duke of Bipont, and many continental leaders of the reformed movement: Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pelikan, Bibliander, Josias Simmler, Wolphius, and Ludwig Lavater. The Marian exiles included many important or soon-to-be important English Protestant leaders. Former and future bishops among them included John Aylmer, Miles Coverdale, John Ponet, John Scory, Richard Cox, Edmund Grindal (future archbishop of York, then Canterbury), Edwin Sandys (future archbishop of York), John Bale, John Jewel, James Pilkington, and Thomas Bentham. The conflicts that broke out between the exiles over church organization, discipline, and forms of worship presaged the religious politics of the reign of Elizabeth I and the emergence of Puritanism and Presbyterianism.Patrick Collinson (1979) Archbishop Grindal, 1519-1583: the struggle for a reformed Church, University of California Press, Strasbourg The English congregation in Strasbourg organised its services in conformity with the 1552 Book of Common Prayer. Its leaders and membership included at times the former and future bishops John Ponet, John Scory, Richard Cox, Edmund Grindal, Edwin Sandys, John Aylmer, and John Bale. Others there included Cheke, Morison, Cook, Carew, Wroth, James Haddon, John Huntington, John Geoffrey, John Pedder, Michael Renniger, Augustin Bradbridge, Thomas Steward, Humphrey Alcockson, Thomas Lakin, Thomas Crafton, Guido and Thomas Eton, Alexander Nowell, Arthur Saule, William Cole, Christopher Goodman, Richard Hilles, Richard Chambers, and one or both of the Hales brothers. Myles Coverdale apparently made several visits to the Strasbourg community. Frankfurt The first English exile group in Frankfurt arrived on 27 June 1554. With the help of a local magistrate, they secured the use of a vacant church building. They held their first service on 29 July using a reformed liturgy drawn up by William Whittingham. The congregation adopted a semi-presbyterian system where deacons were expected to preach. At the request of local authorities in this Lutheran city, the English church order had been made to conform to the newly established French reformed church in Frankfurt. The French church included a number of Walloon weavers who had been brought to England by Protector Somerset. Since then they had been under the supervision of Valerand Poullain, formerly John Calvin's successor as minister of the French congregation in Strasbourg. In England, Poullain's congregation had as much autonomy as the London Stranger churches and, like them, based their church order on the models of Zwingli and Calvin. Following this continental reformed precedent, the English exiles in Frankfurt offered themselves as the model church for all the English in exile and put out a call for ministers from the other congregations. However, they had gone further than many of their countrymen would follow, particularly those in Strasbourg and Z√ºrich who wanted to retain use of the second (1552) Edwardian Book of Common Prayer. For that reason the English Church at Frankfurt became preoccupied with disputes over the use of the prayerbook and church order in general. The chief members of the Frankfurt congregation during its existence were David Whitehead, Sandys, Nowell, Foxe, Bale, Horne, Whittingham, Knox, Aylmer, Bentham, Sampson, Roger Kelke, Chambers, Isaac, both Knollyses, John and Christopher Hales, Richard Hilles, Bartholomew Traheron, Robert Crowley, Thomas Cole, William Turner, Robert Wisdome. An informal university established by the congregation had Horne teaching Hebrew, John Mullins (who came from Zurich after Knox left) teaching Greek, and Traheron teaching theology. Thomas Beccon came from Strasbourg to Frankfurt; he taught at Marburg University around 1556‚Äì1559 All records of the group were destroyed in World War II with the Frankfurt city archives, and only partial transcripts from prior scholarship remain. These records disclose that native Frankfurters distrusted the English and suspected they were being used by members of the nobility to diminish the privileges of the burghers. The English were also accused of unfair commercial practices and of competing with local artisans‚Äîaccusations which led to detailed censuses of the immigrants. =Troubles at Frankfurt= The organizational and liturgical differences between the English churches in exile soon led to protracted conflicts concentrated in Frankfurt. A particular clash between Richard Cox and John Knox came in time to stand for the general struggle between the Church of England and Presbyterian views. Geneva Led mainly by Knox, the largest, most politically and theologically radical concentration of English exiles was at Geneva, reaching a peak of 233 people or about 140 households. (This was approximately 2% of the city's population.) Names, dates of arrival, and other information is preserved in the Livre des Anglais (facsimile edition by Alexander Ferrier Mitchell), a folio manuscript kept at the Hotel de Ville of Geneva. New members admitted to the church numbered 48 in 1555, 50 in 1556, 67 in 1557, ten in 1558, and two in 1559. Seven marriages, four baptisms, and 18 deaths are recorded.Dan G. Danner (1999) Pilgrimage to Puritanism: History and Theology of the Marian Exiles at Geneva, 1555-1560, (Studies in Church History, 9.) New York: Peter Lang This was the first English congregation to adopt the wholly presbyterian form of discipline and worship that was resisted in Frankfurt. These forms and standards were printed in 1556 as the Book of Geneva which went through several editions after 1556 in Geneva and was in official use in the Church of Scotland from 1564 to 1645. Sometimes titled Book of Our Common Order, it is the basis for the modern Book of Common Order used by Presbyterian churches. The English church in Geneva was also the scene of the Geneva Bible's production, which was to be the most popular English version of the era and the most notorious for its annotations that supported Reformed theology and resistance theory. At Geneva Knox wrote his infamous First Blast of the Trumpet Blowen Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women during the winter of 1557‚Äì58. Published in Geneva in the spring 1558, it denounced all female rulers in the most strident language. This was opposed by many other English exiles, especially those seeking favor with Elizabeth I, such as John Aylmer, who published a retort to Knox called Harborowe for Faithful and True Subjects in 1559. Christopher Goodman took a more circumspect approach in a How superior powers ought to be obeyd of their subjects & wherein they may lawfully by Gods Worde be disobeyed & resisted for which Whittingham wrote the preface. Laurence Humphrey, working out of Strasbourg, claimed to be clarifying what Knox, Ponet, and Goodman really meant when he defended passive resistance only and supported the legitimacy of female rule in De religionis conservatione et reformatione vera (1559). John Calvin proposed that the English exiles should hold their own services in the building where he delivered lectures, later known as the Calvin Auditory. This worship in English continues in the building to the present day, under the Church of Scotland. Members of the English church in Geneva included Sir William Stafford, Sir John Burtwick, John Bodley and the eldest of his five sons (Laurence, Thomas, and Josias who was later knighted), James Pilkington, John Scory, Thomas Bentham, William Cole, William Kethe, Thomas Sampson, Anthony Gilby, John Pullein, Perceval Wiburne, and Robert Fills. * Ministers: Christopher Goodman (1555‚Äì58), Anthony Gilby (1555), and John Knox (1556‚Äì58) * Elders: William Williams (1555‚Äì58), William Whittingham (1555‚Äì56), Gilby (1556‚Äì58), William Fuller (1556), Thomas Wood (1557), Miles Coverdale (1558), and John Bodley (1557‚Äì58) * Deacons: John Staunton (1555‚Äì56), Christopher Seburne (1555), Francis Withers (1556‚Äì57), William Beauvoir (1556‚Äì58), John Staunton (1556), John Pullein (1557), William Fuller (1557), Francis Willias (1558), Peter Willis (1558), and Whittingham (1558) See also *Puritanism *Anglicanism *Protestantism *Vestments controversy *Elizabethan Religious Settlement *The Protestant Reformation References Sources Primary *A Briefe Discourse of the Troubles begun at Frankeford in Germany (1575) *John Knox, Of the Proceedings of the English Congregation at Frankfurt, in March 1555. *John Strype, Annals of the Reformation. *John Brett, A Narrative of the Pursuit of English Refugees in Germany Under Queen Mary.

The Kaw√©sqar, also known as the Alacalufe, Kaweskar, Alacaluf or Halakwulup, are an indigenous people who live in Chilean Patagonia, specifically in the Brunswick Peninsula, and Wellington, Santa In√©s, and Desolaci√≥n islands of the western area of Tierra del Fuego. Their traditional language is known as Kaw√©sqar; it is endangered as few native speakers survive. Etymology The English and other Europeans initially adopted the name that the Yahgan, a competing indigenous tribe whom they met first in central and southern Tierra del Fuego, used for these people: Alacaluf or Halakwulup (meaning \\"mussel eater\\" in the Yahgan language). Their own name for themselves (autonym) is Kaw√©sqar.  Economy  Like the Yahgan in southern Chile and Argentina, the Kaw√©sqar were a nomadic seafaring people, called canoe-people by some anthropologists. They made canoes that were eight to nine meters long and one meter wide, which would hold a family and its dog.Patricia Messier Loncuante, \\"Kaw√©sqar Community\\" , National Museum of the American Indian, Smithsonian Institution, accessed 12 October 2013 They continued this fishing, nomadic practice until the twentieth century, when they were moved into settlements on land. Because of their maritime culture, the Kaw√©sqar have never farmed the land.  Population  Distribution of the pre-Hispanic people of Chile, north is to the right The total population of the Kaw√©sqar was estimated not to exceed 5,000. They ranged from the area between the Gulf of Penas (Golfo de Penas) to the north and the Brecknock Peninsula (Pen√≠nsula de Brecknock) to the south. Like other indigenous peoples, they suffered high fatalities from endemic European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity. Their environment was disrupted as Europeans began to settle in the area in the late 1880s. In the 1930s many remaining Alacaluf were relocated to Wellington Island, in the town of Puerto Ed√©n, to shield them from pressures from the majority culture. Later they moved further south, to Puerto Natales and Punta Arenas. In the 21st century, few Kaw√©sqar remain. The 2002 census found 2,622 people identifying as Kaw√©sqar (defined as those who still practiced their native culture or spoke their native language). In 2006, only 15 full-blooded members remained, but numerous mestizo have Kaw√©sqar ancestry. Lessons in the Kaw√©sqar language are part of the local curriculum, but few native speakers remain to encourage daily use of their traditional language. =Tribes and languages= Adwipliin, Aks√°nas, Alacaluf, C√°len (C√°lenches, Calenes), Caucahu√©, Enoo, Lecheyel, Ta√≠jataf (Tayataf), Yequinahuere (Yequinahue, Yekinauer). By 1884 Thomas Bridges, an Anglican missionary based in Ushuaia who had been serving and studying the indigenous peoples of Tierra del Fuego since the late 1860s, and his son Despard compiled a 1200-word vocabulary for the Kaw√©sqar language. It was in the form of a manuscript. Through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, numerous missionaries and anthropologists moved among the indigenous peoples to aid, record and study them.

He was a founding member of the string department in the Detmold music conservatory. Early life Varga was born in Gy≈ër, Hungary, in the same region that witnessed the birth of Joseph Joachim, Leopold Auer, Carl Flesch as well as of the famous conductor Hans Richter. Young Varga took his first lessons at the age of two and a half with his father Lajos Varga, who was also a violinist. Due to an injury during the War, Lajos Varga had to abandon his projects to be a concert artist and became a violin maker. Studies Coming to the attention of Jen≈ë Hubay, Varga was enrolled at the Budapest Franz Liszt Academy when only ten years old. There he studied with Franz Gabriel, with members of the Waldbauer Quartet, with Zolt√°n Kod√°ly and notably with Le√≥ Weiner. After Hubay's death (1937), Varga was chosen to be the soloist in the memorial concert, playing the 3rd Violin Concerto op. 99 by Hubay under the direction of Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi, who in 1934 had become Hubay's successor as the Rector of the Liszt Academy. On completion of his musical studies at the Liszt Music Academy, Varga devoted himself throughout the war years to studying philosophy at the Budapest University. Career Varga was six years old when he made his first public appearance. At ten, he took on his first solo role with an orchestra, performing the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto op. 64. At the age of 13, he made his first recordings. At 14, he took on his first concert tours abroad, until his career had abruptly been interrupted by World War II. After the War he continued his concert activities, becoming one of the most prominent soloists. Varga collaborated with eminent conductors such as Ernest Ansermet, Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez, Ferenc Fricsay, Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, Igor Markevitch, Hans Rosbaud, Georg Solti and others. He performed with the greatest orchestras such as the Philharmonia Orchestra London and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and recorded for labels such as Deutsche Grammophon and EMI. A recording of the Bartok Violin Concerto no. 2 with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra under Ferenc Fricsay as well as his versions of the Violin Concertos by Max Bruch, Mozart, Carl Nielsen, Paganini, Tchaikovsky etc. have become major references of musical interpretation. Varga's classical repertory included the great Violin Concertos as well as the important Violin Sonatas and Concert Pieces. In addition, from the beginning of his career, Tibor Varga devoted himself to contemporary music, of which he became a pioneer. In particular, his interpretations (premi√®res) and recordings of the Violin Concertos and other compositions by B√©la Bart√≥k, Alban Berg and Arnold Sch√∂nberg have raised these works to the status of \\"classics\\" of the repertoire and given them a prime position in international musical life. Among others, Varga played the Australian Premi√®re of Alban Berg's Violin Concerto and in 1949, the Violin Concerto by Arnold Sch√∂nberg. The composer himself paid tribute to his enthusiasm by a letter which has become famous: \\"I wished to be younger to write more music of this kind for you.\\" (Sch√∂nberg, Letters). The Sch√∂nberg Violin Concerto, like the Violin Concertos by Berg, Shostakovich and other works, were also interpreted by Tibor Varga at the BBC Promenade Concerts in the London Royal Albert Hall. Furthermore, he gave the Austrian Premi√®re of the Violin Concerto by Strawinsky as well as the World Premi√®res of numerous compositions partly also dedicated to him, such as the Violin Concertos by Boris Blacher, Ernst Krenek, G√∂sta Nystr√∂m, Almeida Prado, Matyas Seiber and Winfried Zillig. From the beginning of the 1950s, Varga enjoyed equal success as a conductor. His conducting career led to the establishment, in 1954, of a chamber orchestra bearing his name (Kammerorchester Tibor Varga) at Detmold, Germany, as well as to that of the Tibor Varga Festival Orchestra (1964-2001) at Sion. He was chief conductor and artistic director of these ensembles as well as - from 1989 to 1993 - of the Orchestre des Pays de Savoie (France). In addition, Tibor Varga had regularly been invited as a guest conductor to orchestras of international renown. Pedagogic activities After World War II, Varga in his home town Gy≈ër was co-founder and first professor of a Music Academy associated to the Budapest Franz Liszt Academy. In 1947, he established himself in London. In 1949, he became professor at the newly founded Detmold High School of Music (Hochschule f√ºr Musik Detmold). Charged to establish the String Department, for which he was asked to become the Head, Varga, with cellist Andr√© Navarra and violists Bruno Giuranna and Nobuko Imai, created a string school of world renown. Since the 1950s, Varga has equally been jury member or president in the leading international Violin and Chamber Music Competitions. Regularly he also directed master classes at Darmstadt (Internationale Ferienkurse f√ºr Neue Musik), London, Paris, Salzburg (Mozarteum), Siena (Accademia Chigiana) and other musical centres in Europe and the USA, giving furthermore public lectures on musical themes. In 1956, Tibor Varga settled in Switzerland, though maintaining his position in Detmold. In 1963, at Sion, the capital of the Canton of Valais in Switzerland, he created an International Academy of Music (Acad√©mie de Musique Tibor Varga), specializing in interpretation (or \\"master\\") classes for accomplished young players conducted by leading soloists during the summer. In a typical year, the International Academy draws around 400 students to attend about 25 master classes. In 1964, he founded the Festival Tibor Varga (1964-2001), which during nearly four decades was one of the leading international music festivals with concerts broadcast all over the world. In addition, in 1967, he added the annual International Tibor Varga Violin Competition, one of the most prestigious competitions of its genre, including prize-winners like Jean- Jacques Kantorow, Nam Yun Kim, Mirijam Contzen and Vadim Repin. In 1988, the High School of Music (Ecole Sup√©rieure de Musique) exclusively dedicated to the training of professional string players was born at Sion, with the founder Varga responsible as both artistic and teaching director. Within one year of the founding of the school, a leading music educator proclaimed the Varga school as \\"one of the three best professional violin academies in Europe\\", with highly gifted students of all continents. In 2002, the √âcole Sup√©rieure de Musique became the Conservatoire Sup√©rieur et Acad√©mie de Musique Tibor Varga. Today, it is part of the Lausanne High School of Music (HEMU Lausanne- Fribourg-Sion). In addition, Varga was an artistic and pedagogic adviser in the services of the ministries of culture in France and Portugal. Since October 2002, he held a chair for violin at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Graz (Universit√§t f√ºr Musik und Darstellende Kunst, Graz, Austria). Graduates of Varga's school are soloists, concertmasters, professors and members of leading orchestras all over the world, including the Berlin Philharmonic, Orchestra del Teatro alla Scala, Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks, Staatskapelle Dresden, Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, New Japan Philharmonic and others. Madeleine Carruzzo, Varga's student for many years, was the first female member to be admitted to the Berlin Philharmonic. Distinctions Varga was an honorary citizen of different towns in France and in Switzerland. France, Germany, Hungary and Switzerland have awarded him high honours, among others the National Prize for Culture (Switzerland), the Cross of Merit (Germany), the Cross of Merit (Hungary), the medals of the Arts et Lettres and of the L√©gion d'Honneur (Legion of Honour, France). The Budapest University respectively the Budapest Franz Liszt Academy appointed him honorary professor, a rare distinction awarded, for example, to Edward Elgar, Emil Gilels, Richard Strauss and Arturo Toscanini. Varga's Etude-Caprice for 4 violins composed on the occasion of the European Rector's Conference in Graz, Cultural Capital of Europe, in 2003 has been designated after his death to be the official hymn of the European University Association. Death Varga died at his home in Grimisuat, near Sion, Switzerland, on 4 September 2003. With his first wife Judith, he had a son, Gilbert Varga, a noted conductor. His daughter Susan Rybicki-Varga is a cellist and teacher. His second wife Dr. Angelika Varga-Behrer is a musicologist and musician. References Additional Sources *J.

Michael Fay to spend 465 days on the expedition hike of 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) across the Congo Basin of Africa to survey the ecological and environmental status of the region. A transect is a term in ecology that denotes a survey of the natural vegetation through a particular area. The concept of a megatransect was conceived as a vegetation transect on a large scale that could be used to take an ecological census of the natural vegetation and ecosystems. Shortly after the hike, Fay successfully lobbied alongside the President of Gabon to create 13 new national parks. In 2002, US Secretary of State Colin Powell and other Bush Administration members gave 53 million dollars to help preserve the Congo Basin. Mike Fay later went on to carry out the MegaFlyover in 2004. Madagascar megatransect Also in 2004, an international team conducted a \\"Megatransect\\" of the island of Madagascar. Dubbed \\"Hike Madagascar\\", the journey covered the entire island. Members met with rural farmers to help them improve their agricultural techniques and discuss their impact on the environment. History of USA megatransects One of the first mega transects in the United States, was conducted by Dr. Robert R. Humphrey when he rephotographed 535 miles of the natural vegetation along with the United States and Mexico border at the 1890s permanent border monument locations, spaced about five miles apart, and published the work in \\"90 Years and 535 miles: Vegetation Changes along the Mexican Border\\" (1987, pub. Univ. of NM Press, 448 pages). Craig C. Dremann, in 1997, conducted a mega transect surveying over 3,000 miles and at each mile-marker, noting the roadside vegetation, the perennial native grass, and exotic grass status, through the Great Basin ecosystem. The route was from Reno, Nevada eastward to Hot Springs, South Dakota, and from South Dakota, through Wyoming, Idaho, Nevada and returning westward to Bishop, California, and then north to Reno. In 2005, Dremann conducted another vegetation mega transect, this time of the California portion of the Mojave desert, mapping over 1,000 miles on a mile- by-mile basis, for a fast-spreading exotic mustard species, Brassica tournefortii, noting the locations and density of the Mojave desert Mustard infestation in California. Dremann suggests that a method of remotely conducting a large-scale vegetation mega transect is with photographs. Photographs that have been taken at ground-level at intervals from known locations, can be stitched together, to create large-scale to Continent-scale mega transect pictures of the ecosystems. In 2006, Dr. Michael C. McGrann, and his wife Amy M. McGrann, hiked the length of the California section of Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail (PCT) in the western United States from Mexico to the Oregon border (2,736 km) while systematically collecting avian-habitat data on 3,578 survey plots separated by 10-minute hiking intervals. This work was completed in a single field season from 2 April to 8 September. From this data, Dr. McGrann and his collaborators described the elevation and latitudinal distributions of birds along the PCT and statistically modeled avian species richness relationships with elevation, climate, and environmental factors, including temperature, precipitation, and primary productivity. The results from this work show that birds can exhibit heterogeneous relationships to temperature, precipitation, and productivity, depending on the distinct environmental and climate conditions of each of the ecological regions traversed by the PCT. The PCT Mega-transect is an ongoing research project for Dr. McGrann in collaboration with several other researchers. He has continued his biodiversity surveys along sections of the PCT in 2007, 2010, and 2015, and he is working to expand taxa surveyed along the PCT and to involve his undergraduate students at William Jessup University in the PCT Mega-Transect. In 2007-2008 J. Michael Fay and Lindsey Holm completed a 1300 mile Redwood Transect of 333 days. This was a transect that spanned from the southernmost to the northernmost redwood tree in California and Oregon. They walked extensively on private timberland and public land recording data on historical exploitation, current forest stand characteristics, silviculture, and many other aspects of the redwood ecosystem. The results will be published in National Geographic in 2009. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy and the National Park Service are adopting the idea of a mega transect for the Appalachian Trail (A.T.) Like other mega transects, the A.T. MEGA-Transect aims to monitor the natural resources along the trail, understand the status and trends of these resources, and inform and engage the public and stakeholders. The 2,178-mile-long trail crosses 14 states, from Georgia to Maine, and is visited by one to two million people, and completed by about 400 people each year. Volunteer citizen scientists are beginning to implement monitoring protocols to track natural resources such as wildlife presence, water quality, forest health, invasive plants, endangered species, mountain birds, phenology, and air quality. Professional scientists are also using the transect for independent research. Because the A.T. is oriented along the predicted migratory direction of species responding to climate change, it is a particularly important mega transect to establish and maintain. MegaTransect future For a rapidly changing planet, megatransects establish baseline data from which to draw future trends, and they can focus attention on particular ecosystems which are disappearing faster than others. Establishing standard megatransects on specific regions or through various ecosystems of each continent, and periodic re-measurement of the ecological conditions along routes, every five to ten years, would provide very valuable measured data on environmental trends.

It was the first specialized pulp magazine with stories and articles about railroads. The magazine merged with Railfan to form the new Railfan & Railroad, published by Carstens Publications beginning after the final Railroad issue in 1979. Early years and development Frank Munsey (b. Maine, 1854) moved to New York City in 1892, where he authored a few books and published periodicals and newspapers in many cities. At the time that Munsey founded The Railroad Man's Magazine, the first offices were located in the Flatiron Building in New York City and there was no organized railroad enthusiast movement. Initially the magazine was targeted towards railroaders and retirees. Fictionalized stories of working on the railroad became the cornerstone of the new magazine, along with profiles of current and historic railroad operations around the country. As a boy, the author H.P. Lovecraft is known to have read the entire run of the magazine, from cover to cover. The magazine was published under different names and formats throughout its history. In 1919, it merged with Argosy which became Argosy and Railroad Man's Magazine for a brief period before reverting to Argosy, thus killing Railroad Man's Magazine. In 1925, magazine founder Frank Munsey had died, leaving a $25 million gift to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1929, when freelance author William Edward Hayes announced he was bringing out a new railroad-oriented pulp, the Munsey Company recruited him to edit a revival of Railroad Man's Magazine. Upon the abrupt departure of the editor in chief in 1930, Freeman H. Hubbard took over the post, yet was uncredited on the masthead for many years. In 1932, the title was simplified to Railroad Stories, then changed to Railroad Magazine in 1937. Through the 1930s, the magazine helped grow the organized railfan movement by encouraging communication between enthusiasts, organizing special \\"fan trip\\" excursions with the railroads, and reporting on the activities of various clubs and museums around the country. Popular Publications era After December 1942, Railroad Magazine was published by Popular Publications, which purchased the Munsey Company. It dropped railroad fiction after January 1979. At mid- century, the magazine staff consisted of editor Henry B. Comstock, associate editors K.M. Campbell and Ted Sanchargin, art editor George H. Mabie, and \\"Electric Lines\\" editor Stephen B. Maguire. By the 1970s, the magazine staff consisted of editor Freeman Hubbard, associate editor Gordon T. Wilbur, assistant editor Nancy Nicolelis, \\"Steam Locomotives\\" editor Michael A. Eagleson, \\"Diesel Locomotives\\" editor Jim Edmonston, \\"Transit Topics\\" editor Steve Maguire, \\"Passenger Trains\\" editor Ramona K. McGuire, \\"Technical Editor\\" Sy Reich, and \\"Information Booth\\" editor Barbara Kreimer (although, in truth, Kreimer had left the publication long before, her column featuring a dated photo of her). By this time, the magazine was known more for its photos featuring conveniently-posed attractive women around trains than any editorial content. Decline and acquisition by Carstens Publications After years of declining revenue and readership, the magazine abruptly ceased publication with the January 1979 edition, with no mention of the situation. In a deal worked out with Carstens Publications, the venerable title would be merged with their Railfan magazine, and existing subscribers would have their obligation fulfilled with the new title. For the first few years, Steve Maguire continued his \\"Transit Topics\\" column, as did Mike Eagleson with \\"In Search of Steam.\\" The combined publication continued as a part of Railfan & Railroad until 2015. Railroad Magazine is no longer listed in the masthead of the combined publication. As successor, White River Productions retains the copyright on all Railroad Magazine content and trademarks. Modern reprints In 2015, Bold Venture Press began issuing authorized reprints of stories selected from Railroad Stories. These editions collect stories according to themes such as authors, series characters, or serialized novels. These volumes also reprint illustrated features such as Joe Easley's \\"Along the Iron Pike\\" and Stookie Allen's \\"Who's Who in the Crew\\". The copyright for all Railroad Magazine content remains with Railfan and Railroad publisher White River Productions.

A noted patron of the arts and buildings, Maria's personal wealth rivaled that of her half-brother, King John III of Portugal, making her the richest woman in Portugal and one of the wealthiest princesses in Europe.  Youth  Infanta Maria of Portugal by Francisco de Holanda; c. 1540s. She was a renowned beauty of a pale complexion and clear blue eyes. Maria de Av√≠z was born on 18 June 1521, in Lisbon, Portugal. She was the only daughter of King Manuel I of Portugal and Archiduchess Eleanor of Austria. Six months after her birth, her father died of the plague and was succeded by her half- brother, John III of Portugal. Shortly afterwards, her mother returned to Vienna with Maria until 1530, when Eleanor was married King Francis I of France and moved to France. Maria wouldn't see her mother for nearly 28 years and was sent to live in Portugal at her half-brother's court. In 1525, her maternal aunt Catherine of Austria, was married John III of Portugal. The Queen took care of the upbringing and education of Maria, who was loved like one of her own daughters. Their education was astounding for a woman of their time since their teaches included female scholars, such as humanists Joana Vaz and P√∫blia Hort√™nsia de Castro. Lessons included finances, architecture, literature, and several languages. One of the most educated of the Portuguese infantas, Maria became a famed humanist and protector of the arts.Paulo Pereira, Enciclop√©dia dos Lugares M√°gicos de Portugal, volume IX Her household was made into a sort of female university, where the greatest minds would converge. It was rumored that she fell in love with Portugal's greatest poet, Lu√≠s de Cam√µes. Although she did not lack suitors and had several marriage proposals, Maria never married. Her engagament with Dauphin Francis was negotiated with the support of her mother Eleanor, but the prince died in 1536. In 1537, Maria and her cousin Christina, Dowager Duchess of Milan, were briefly considered as possible brides for Henry VIII of England. However, England soon dropped any pursuit. Maria was considered as a second wife for her cousin and half-nephew, the future Philip II of Spain,Juan de Mariana: Historia general de Espa√±a, vol. XIV son of her uncle, Emperor Charles V, and her half-sister Isabella, The matter was taken to serious consideration from 1549 onward, when her mother settled in Brussels, but these plans were discontinued when Mary Tudor succeeded to the English throne in 1553 and Charles V decided to marry his son Philip to a monarch.Julia Cartwright: Christina of Denmark. Duchess of Milan and Lorraine. 1522‚Äì1590, New York, 1913 Other candidates for her hand were Archduke Maximilian of Austria; his father Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor; and the Duke of Savoy. Duchess of Viseu Maria, Duchess of Viseu, by Hieronymus Cock, c. 1554‚Äì1556. Viseu's historic center Eventually, King John III gave Maria her own household and the duchy of Viseu, the state their father owned before he became King. Under her rule, the city continued and prospered its several industries of pottery, embroidery and copper. Her personal wealth eventually rivaled that of the king, making her the richest woman in Portugal and one of the wealthiest princesses in Europe. Receiving such incomes, Maria sponsored several building projects, particularly in Carnide and the Lisbon countryside. She financed and supervised the construction of the Church of Nossa Senhora da Luz and the Hospital of Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres, which currently houses the Col√©gio Militar, both of which still boast large reliefs of her personal coat of arms. In Lisbon, she sponsored the construction of the Church of Santa Engr√°cia, in S√£o Vicente. The original structure she ordered to be built would be completely destroyed in 1681, which would lead to the construction of the new current church, which now serves as the National Pantheon of Portugal. Later life After her half-brother John‚Äôs death in 1558, Maria went to Spain to meet her widowed mother for the first time in 28 years. Eleanor asked her unwed daughter to come and live with her and her aunt Mary, but Maria refused the request and only remained there for three weeks before returning to Lisbon. Eleanor died very shortly afterwards on her return journey to Jarandilla de la Vera from Badajoz. During the tumultuous period of the minority of young King Sebastian, a faction of the Portuguese nobility wanted that the Duchess of Viseu would replace Queen Dowager Catherine as regent, but these plans came to nothing. Maria died in Lisbon on October 10, 1577, at the age of 56. She was buried in the Church of Nossa Senhora da Luz.

As the economic and commercial center of Trujillo state, Valera is a leading distribution centre for the agricultural products in Venezuela, in which sugarcane, cacao, coffee, fruit, and grains are cultivated. Flour milling is a principal industry. The area has traditionally supplied about one-fourth of the nation's wheat. In recent years the city grew with the construction of many new buildings and new malls such as the Plaza Center (centro Comercial Plaza) which has 5 movie theaters from Cinex and other smaller malls. History Valera has its name from Marcos Valera. The date of its founding is not certain, although several historians agree that it was founded on 25 August 1811.

He was the inventor of the spirit level and is also famous for his popular 1696 book The Art of Swimming, one of the first books on the subject and widely read during the 18th century (Benjamin Franklin, an avid swimmer in his youth, is known to have read it). The book popularized the breaststroke (see History of swimming) ; he was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1990.ISHOF.org MONFIEUR THEVENOT (FRA) He also influenced the founding of the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences (the French Academy of Sciences). Life Th√©venot came from a family of royal office holders (nobles of the robe), which partly explains his wealth. He was reputed to speak English, Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and several oriental languages, including Arabic and Turkish. Th√©venot's baptismal name was Nicolas, Melchis√©dech being added as the second (confirmation) name, almost certainly in honour of his maternal grandfather, Melchis√©dech Garnier (d. 1637), an avocat at the Parlement of Paris, and probably a Huguenot (given the Old Testament name). Th√©venot was an amateur scientist and a patron of many scientists and mathematicians, maintaining correspondence with figures like Jan Swammerdam, whom he encouraged to tackle the origin of organisms. He was wealthy and well-connected, in 1684 becoming the Royal Librarian to King Louis XIV of France. He also served as ambassador to Genoa in 1647 and then to Rome in the 1650s. After the death of Pope Innocent X, he participated in the subsequent conclave. He died at Issy. Scientific studies Th√©venot studied astronomy, physics, medicine, and magnetism, and demonstrated in the 1660s the possibility that atmospheric pulsations had something to do with human and animal respiration. Between 1658 and 1661 Th√©venot conducted experiments on capillarity and the siphon. He proposed the use of lemon juice as a cure for various maladies, as well as ipecac as a remedy for dysentery. Th√©venot can be credited in sponsoring a scientific study that contributed to the discovery of the nature and mechanism of fertilization both in humans and in animals in general. In April 1665, he wrote to his friend Christiaan Huygens (1629‚Äì95), a Dutch mathematician and astronomer: \\"We took the opportunity provided by the cold of recent months and applied ourselves to dissections and to investigating the Generation of animals\\" (Th√©venot 1665). The \\"we\\" referred to two of Th√©venot's prot√©g√©s, the Dutchman Jan Swammerdam (1637‚Äì1680) and the Dane Niels Stensen (\\"Steno\\") (1638‚Äì86). Th√©venot invented the spirit level (or bubble level) some time before 2 February 1661, which he filled with alcohol and mounted on a stone ruler fitted with a viewing lens. This date can be established from Th√©venot's correspondence with scientist Christiaan Huygens. Within a year of this date, the inventor circulated details of his invention to others, including Robert Hooke in London and Vincenzo Viviani in Florence. It is occasionally argued that these bubble levels did not come into widespread use until the beginning of the 18th centurythe earliest surviving examples being from that timebut Adrien Auzout had recommended that the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences take \\"levels of the Th√©venot type\\" on its expedition to Madagascar in 1666. It is very likely that these levels were in use in France and elsewhere long before the beginning of the 18th century. Other works Photo of the marble floor inlaid into the Amsterdam Town Hall showing Nova Hollandia and Terra Dimensis ‚Äì the inlayer incorrectly connected the two, while the original Blaeu map shows the gap. Many of Th√©venot's maps of the Middle East were published in his Relations de Divers Voyages Curieux (Paris, 1663), a collection of translations of voyages of discovery (such as that of Cosmas Indicopleustes). One of these was one of the earliest and most detailed depictions of southern Iraq (his nephew Jean de Th√©venot later visited this region). Th√©venot makes reference to the Mandaeans of the Basra region, and includes a printed page from one of this sect's holy books, one of the first printed appearances of the Mandaean language in Europe. Hollandia Nova, 1659 map prepared by Joan Blaeu Nova archipelagi orientalis tabula, 1663 by Johannes Blaeu. ‚ÄúPapas landt or Nova Guinea, Nova Hollandia, discovered in the year 1644, Nova Zeelandia or New Zealand reached in 1642, Antoni van Diemens land found in the same year, Carpentaria, thus named after General Carpentier, and still other lands, partly discovered, are shown on this map.‚Äù Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula (J.Blaeu, 1664). The map by Th√©venot, Hollandia Nova‚ÄîTerre Australe in Relation de divers voyages et curieux, is a French version of the chart of Abel Tasman's discoveries using information from Dutch sources, notably Joan Blaeu's world map published in 1659. Although Th√©venot said that he had taken his chart from the one inlaid into the floor of the Amsterdam Town Hall, in fact it appears to be an almost exact copy of that of Joan Blaeu in his Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus published in 1659 in the Kurf√ºrsten Atlas (Atlas of the Great Elector).National Library of Australia, Maura O'Connor, Terry Birtles, Martin Woods and John Clark, Australia in Maps: Great Maps in Australia's History from the National Library's Collection, Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2007, p.32; this map is reproduced in Gunter Schilder, Australia Unveiled, Amsterdam, Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, 1976, p.402; and in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore, Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp. 67-84, p.81. image at: home The map of the world set into the floor of the great hall of the Amsterdam Town Hall was drawn from Blaeu's world map of 1648. Once Blaeu's map of the world appeared other mapmakers, such as Th√©venot, copied his depiction of New Holland. Hollandia Nova in the Kurf√ºrsten Atlas is shown as it appears in Blaeu's world map of 1648, Nova et Accuratissima Terrarum Orbis Tabula.Kees Zandvliet, \\"Golden Opportunities in Geopolitics: Cartography and the Dutch East India Company during the Lifetime of Abel Tasman\\", in William Eisler and Bernard Smith, Terra Australis: The Furthest Shore, Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australis, 1988, pp.67-84, p.80. Th√©venot divided the continent in two, between Nova Hollandia to the west and Terre Australe to the east of a latitude staff running down the meridian equivalent to longitude 135 degrees East of Greenwich.Sir Joseph Banks, 'Draft of proposed Introduction to Captn Flinders Voyages', November 1811; State Library of New South Wales, The Papers of Sir Joseph Banks, Series 70.16; quoted in Robert J. King, \\"Terra Australis, New Holland and New South Wales: the Treaty of Tordesillas and Australia\\", The Globe',' no.47, 1998, pp.35-55, p.35. The differentiation between Nova Hollandia to the west and Terre Australe to the east of the meridian corresponding to 135¬∞ East of Greenwich, emphasized by the latitude staff running down that meridian, appears to have been an initiative of Thevenot's, as there is no such division on Blaeu's map or on the Amsterdam Town Hall map.Margaret Cameron Ash, \\"French Mischief: A Foxy Map of New Holland\\", The Globe, no.68, 2011, pp.1-14. This apparent division may have been fortuitous, as on other Dutch maps of this period Terra Australis or t'Zuid Landt (\\"the South Land\\") appears with the name, Hollandia Nova as an alternative name for the whole country.See, for example, the 1650 globe of Arnold Florent van Langren, in Gunter Schilder, Australia Unveiled, Amsterdam, Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, 1976, pp.382-383. The meridian staff dividing Nova Hollandia from Terre Australe on Th√©venot's map fell along the meridian that represented the western limit of Spain's imperial claim in the South Pacific arising from the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494 and act of possession of the South Land made by Pedro Fern√°ndez de Quir√≥s in 1606. This western limit of Spain's claim is shown on the 1761 map of the Spanish Empire by Vicente de Memije, Aspecto Symbolico del Mundo Hispanico.British Library K. Top. cxviii, 19 and Servicio Geogr√°fico del Ejercito, Madrid ; O.H.K. Spate, Monopolists and Freebooters, Canberra, Australian National University Press, 1983, pp.279-280. Emanuel Bowen reproduced Th√©venot's map in his Complete System of Geography (London, 1747), re-titling it A Complete Map of the Southern Continent and adding three inscriptions promoting the benefits of exploring and colonizing the country. One inscription said: \\"It is impossible to conceive a Country that promises fairer from its Situation than this of TERRA AUSTRALIS, no longer incognita, as this Map demonstrates, but the Southern Continent Discovered. It lies precisely in the richest climates of the World... and therefore whoever perfectly discovers and settles it will become infalliably possessed of Territories as Rich, as fruitful, and as capable of Improvement, as any that have hitherto been found out, either in the East Indies or the West.\\" Bowen's map was re-published in John Campbell's editions of John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels (1744-1748, and 1764).A Complete Map of the Southern Continent survey'd by Capt. Abel Tasman & depicted by order of the East India Company in Holland in the Stadt House at Amsterdam; E. Bowen, Sculp. When drawing up the territorial boundaries of the colony of New South Wales, established in 1788, the British government set its western boundary at the meridian of 135¬∞ East of Greenwich, as it appeared on Th√©venot's chart.Sir Joseph Banks, 'Draft of proposed Introduction to Captn Flinders Voyages', November 1811; State Library of New South Wales, The Papers of Sir Joseph Banks, Series 70.16; quoted in Robert J. King, \\"Terra Australis, New Holland and New South Wales: the Treaty of Tordesillas and Australia\\", The Globe, no. 47, 1998, pp. 35-55, p. 35; Martin Woods, \\"'Terre Australe, east coast of New Holland'\\", National Library of Australia, Mapping our World: Terra Incognita to Australia, Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2013, p.143. Th√©venot is often confused with his nephew, the traveller Jean de Th√©venot. There is evidence to suggest that both Huygens and Hooke later laid claim to the invention of the spirit level, although only within their own countries. There is no surviving portrait of Th√©venot, and an alleged portrait of him (such as can be seen in Gerrit Lindeboom's edition of Th√©venot's letters to Swammerdam) is actually of his nephew Jean.

For a brief period, Marcel also played with the band Europe. Biography In 1978, Jacob formed the band Rising Force together with guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen. Three years later Jacob joined the band Force, which later changed its name to Europe, replacing John Lev√©n, who took Jacob's place in Rising Force. During his time in Force, Jacob wrote the song \\"Black Journey Through My Soul\\" together with vocalist Joey Tempest. The song was eventually included on Europe's second album Wings of Tomorrow, retitled \\"Scream of Anger\\". After spending three months in Force, Jacob traded places with John Lev√©n again, who apparently had issues with Malmsteen. In 1985, Jacob returned to Malmsteen's band to play on the album Marching Out and parts of the following US tour. In 1987, Jacob played on the album Total Control, the first solo album released by Europe guitarist John Norum. Jacob also re-used demo tracks from his pre- Yngwie band Power for several of the songs included on that album. Two years later he formed the band Talisman together with vocalist Jeff Scott Soto. Throughout the years Talisman was Jacob's major effort and the band released several studio and live albums until 2007. In 1992, Jacob played on a song with Lion's Share, \\"Nothing's Free\\", which was included on a Belgian compilation and in 1993 he was guest musician on Thomas Vikstr√∂m's solo album If I Could Fly. Vikstr√∂m and Jacob had played together with guitar player Tommy Denander and drummer Jake Samuel (The Poodles) in the cover band Horny Strings. Later Vikstr√∂m (Therion) took the lead singer role. The same year Jacob was guest musician on the album Something Wicked Comes by Billionaires Boys Club. In 1994, he played on The Johansson Brothers' self-titled album. Another band Jacob formed was Human Clay, together with Jeff Scott Soto. They recorded two albums. In 1996, Jacob played on Inspiration, a cover album recorded by Yngwie J. Malmsteen. In the early 2000s, Jacob studied psychology at Stockholm University for a few years. In 2005 Jacob was one of three new players to participate in the Swedish/German hard rock band Last Autumn's Dream for its second studio album, along with drummer Jamie Borger and keyboarder Thomas Lassar. They were hired to replace John Lev√©n, Ian Haugland and Mic Michaeli, who played on the debut album, but who could not make it this time due to taking part in the Europe reunion. Jacob also recorded Last Autumn's Dream five further studio albums, the latest being Dreamcatcher, which was released on 26 January 2009. Jacob made his last appearance on record with the Swedish studio band Impulsia, on the album Expressions which was released on 24 September 2009 via Impulsia Music and under Riverside Records. Death Jacob was found dead from suicide in his home in Kristineberg, Stockholm on 21 July 2009. He was 45 years old. Talisman vocalist Jeff Scott Soto issued the following statement: \\"It is with deep regret and remorse I, along with fellow members of Talisman, am announcing our brother, longtime colleague and overall greatest musician we've ever played with, Marcel Jacob, is no longer with us as of today, Tuesday July 21, 2009.

When referring to traditions from Tawrat, Muslims did not only identify it with the Pentateuch, but also with the other books of the Hebrew Bible, Talmudic- and Midrashim writings.Isabel Lang Intertextualit√§t als hermeneutischer Zugang zur Auslegung des Korans: Eine Betrachtung am Beispiel der Verwendung von Israiliyyat in der Rezeption der Davidserz√§hlung in Sure 38: 21-25 Logos Verlag Berlin GmbH, 31.12.2015 p. 98 (German) In the Quran The word Tawrat occurs eighteen times in the Quran and the name of Musa is mentioned 136 times in the Quran, nowhere in the Quran is written that Moses alone has been given Tawrat, but at the contrary it is written in Quran that the prophets governed with Tawrat. As per Quran the governing ayats containing an order of God are Tawrat. The Law mentioned in Quran (5:45) Similarly it is mentioned in the Exodus According to 7:157, Muhammad is written about in both the Injil (Gospel), revelations to Jesus (Isa) and the Tawrat, The Tawrat is mentioned as being known by Isa in 5:110. Some quotations are repeated from other books of the Hebrew Bible. An example of this is 48:29, This could be repeated from Psalms: In the hadith Because he believed the Quran replaced it, Muhammad did not teach from the Torah but referenced it heavily. He did say that Moses was one of the few prophets to receive a revelation directly from God, that is, without an intervening angel. On one occasion, it is recorded that some Jews wanted Muhammad to decide how to deal with their brethren who had committed adultery. Abu Dawood recorded: Semantics There is some ambiguity among English speaking Muslims on the use of Tawrat versus Torah. The Arabic of the Quran and hadith have only one word, Tawrat. Generally, in English, they are used interchangeably. However, some Muslims prefer to reserve Tawrat to refer only to the original revelation of God to Moses which some Muslims believe was later corrupted maybe through the Babylonian captivity, and the rewriting of Ezra (Uzair) (and the men of the Great Assembly). However it is not possible to state without any authentic sources as to where, when and by whom the Torah was changed since the Quran mentions Uzair by name in chapter 9 verse 30 and does not say that he corrupted the Torah in this verse it cannot be said that Uzair did so. There is also ambiguity as to whether the Quran uses Tawrat only referring to the five books of Moses, the entire Tanakh, or both, as in Hebrew. This comes because the Quran often lists the holy books as the Tawrat, Zabur, Injil, and Quran. Zabur (the Psalms) is sometimes excluded, possibly because the Psalms are part of the Tanakh. This meaning is uncommon, as most Muslims think it only refers to the five books of Moses. Importance of the Torah The word Torah occurs eighteen times and the name of Moses is mentioned 136 times in the Quran. Nowhere in the Quran is it written that Moses alone taught by the Torah as all succeeding Hebrew prophets and seers, including Aaron (Harun), used the Law for preaching. The Quran states that the Torah did have words of wisdom in it, and all subsequent prophets, priest, rabbis and sages in Israel used its Law for guidance for prophets in plural and not only for Moses alone. The Quran mentions that the basic aspects of Islamic law are evident in the earliest scriptures, including that of Moses. He mentions that it contains the information about the Last Day and about the concepts of Paradise (Jannah) and Hell (Jahannam). The Torah is also mentioned as being known by Jesus.

Products supporting XTND placed an additional popup menu in the open and save dialogs, allowing users to read and write documents of any supported format. The name is a four-letter contraction of extend, the Mac using four-letter identifiers in its system resource files. XTND was first introduced on some of Claris' \\"II\\" releases -- MacWrite II, FileMaker II and MacDraw II. The system proved popular and became a major selling point for Claris products, which were otherwise considered somewhat \\"low end\\". The system was soon used by a number of other products as well, and became fairly common during the early 1990s. Around 1990/91 Claris gave the system to Apple, who eventually re-branded it as a basic part of the Mac OS known as the Translation Manager. They also added Macintosh Easy Open which offered to open unknown documents using software installed on the machine and converting it using XTND. A developer's guide, XTND Programmer's Guide, was published in 1991 along with the XTND Developer's Kit 1.3, which was placed on their FTP site. XTND broke on the Power Macs, but an extension-to-the- extension released in 1993 fixed that for a time. By the 1995/96 time frame it appears Apple had already abandoned the entire system. XTND consisted of a simple runtime engine that listed, loaded and managed a series of \\"translators\\". The translators were stored in resource files placed in the Mac's System folder, allowing them to be found and used by any program supporting the XTND system. Almost all of the actual logic was located in the translators, the runtime simply handed off filenames and parameters to code stored inside. A major technical problem with XTND was that the conversion process was \\"opaque\\". The system ran code in the translators which had no way to provide feedback to the user or ask questions. This made it difficult to distinguish if a long conversion was still processing or if the process locked. Program freezes were a common occurrence as the code base aged. The converters themselves varied widely in quality. For example, the Microsoft Word extension was particularly prone to errors.  References  * Apple Computer Inc., XTND Programmer's Guide, 1991.

The book follows a series of articles published by Diamond, a physiologist, examining the evidence and its interpretation in earlier treatments of the related species, including cultural characteristics or features often regarded as particularly unique to humans. Diamond explores the question of how Homo sapiens came to dominate its closest relatives, such as chimpanzees, and why one group of humans (Eurasians) came to dominate others (indigenous peoples of the Americas, for example). In answering these questions, Diamond (a professor in the fields of physiology and geography) applies a variety of biological and anthropological arguments to reject traditional hegemonic views that the dominant peoples came from \\"superior\\" genetic stock and argues instead that those peoples who came to dominate others did so because of advantages found in their local environment which allowed them to develop larger populations, wider immunities to disease, and superior technologies for agriculture and warfare. The Third Chimpanzee also examines how asymmetry in male and female mating behaviour is resolved through differing social structures across cultures, and how first contact between unequal civilizations almost always results in genocide. The book ends by noting that technological progress may cause environmental degradation on a scale leading to extinction. The original title of the book in its initial 1991 publication was The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee: How Our Animal Heritage Affects the Way We Live; the current title was adopted with the third edition in 2006. In between, the second edition of 2004 was titled The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee: Evolution and Human Life. In 2014, Diamond published an adapted version for young people with Seven Stories Press titled, The Third Chimpanzee for Young People. Organization and summary Despite the broad canvas, the book manages to link together a coherent argument, much of which was novel at the time of publication. Borrowing insights from fields ranging from the humanities (history, linguistics, anthropology), to evolutionary biology, The Third Chimpanzee compiles a portrait of humanity's success and also its potential for disaster. The book is divided into five parts. Part one deals with the similarity between humans and chimpanzees. =The chimpanzee's closest relatives (part one)= Evolutionary tree of the Hominoidea (emphasis on family Hominidae): after an initial separation from the main line by the Hylobatidae (gibbons) some 18 million years ago, the line of Ponginae broke away, leading to the orangutan; later, the Hominidae split into the tribes Gorillini and Hominini. The Hominini species include humans, common chimpanzees and bonobos. The title of the book refers to how similar taxonomically chimps and humans are, as their genes differ by just 1.6%, whereas chimps and gorillas differ by 2.3% (p. 19). Thus the chimp's closest relatives are not the other apes with which it is classed, but the human (see Homininae). In fact, the chimpanzee-human difference is smaller than some within-species distances: e.g. even closely related birds such as the red-eyed and white-eyed vireos differ by 2.9%. Going by genetic differences, humans should be treated as a third species of chimpanzee (after the common chimpanzee and the bonobo). Or possibly the chimpanzee's scientific name should be Homo troglodytes instead of Pan troglodytes. Diamond observes in his book that this would provide food for thought to people passing this side of the bars of a cage with the label Homo. =Sexual selection (parts two and three)= Part two considers sexual dimorphism in mammals, and particularly humans, and the mechanics of sexual selection. It considers how across species, females are more careful in selecting their mates than males (they invest far more energy into each offspring). This determines much of human behaviour: how we pick our mates, and how we organize society and child nurturing systems, leading to differing social structures in cultures such as Papua New Guinea, Kerala, and the Christian West. It also considers questions of longevity ‚Äì the previous generation dies because its biological clock shuts down metabolism and repair as to divert investment from the parent individual to that of the offspring. Part three extends the effects of sexual selection into language, art, hunting and agriculture, through the idea of honest signaling ‚Äì sexual signals that also cost the signer. This is extrapolated to explain the appeal of drugs. Finally, the possibility of contact with extraterrestrial intelligence is discussed (Diamond thinks that would be a disaster). =World conquest (part four)= Part four considers conquest. Why is it that the Eurasians came to dominate other cultures? Diamond's answer is that, in part, this was due to the East‚ÄìWest layout of the Eurasian continent, due to which successful agricultural and animal domestication packages (combinations of certain domesticated plants and animals) could easily be adopted in regions farther east or west. On the other hand, extension of domestication packages along the North‚ÄìSouth axis ‚Äì as required in the case of the American and African continents ‚Äì was much more difficult owing to severe imbalances of climate. Also, long-lasting contact with domesticated animals of agricultural populations permits greater resistance to disease, which is another reason why contact among geographically separated cultures ‚Äì mostly agricultural versus hunter-gatherer societies ‚Äì often leads to extinction of the latter through devastating infections. The process of first contact between differing civilizations is examined through the descriptions of Papua New Guinea highlanders, who were first visited half a century back. Historically, Diamond argues such contacts between widely differing populations have very frequently culminated in the extinction of the disadvantaged groups like many Native American tribes, the Tasmanians, etc. There is a long list of genocides in history.Book excerptise: extended excerpts and genocide tables. The question of why some civilisations conquered others is the main theme of Diamond's later book Guns, Germs and Steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years (1997). =Environmental impact and extinction (part five)= Here the argument is that civilizations sometimes get caught up in internal superiority contests, and deplete the environment to such an extent that they may never recover. Examples include Easter Island and the ruins of Petra, both of which were the result of deforestation resulting in desertification, according to Diamond. The question of why some civilizations collapse and others survive is the main theme of Diamond's Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed (2005).

He notes there is an emphasis on linguistic diversity by the author, and endorses the virtue of his inclusion and comparison of historic or far-fetched speculation on origins in hominids.

It is now a wealthy suburb of Paris. Name The name Montmorency was recorded for the first time in Medieval Latin as Mons Maurentiacus (attested in 993). Mons Maurentiacus, literally \\"Mount Maurentiacus\\", was the name given to the promontory over which a castle was built in the Early Middle Ages. Maurentiacus, the name of the area surrounding the promontory, meant \\"estate of Maurentius\\", probably a Gallo-Roman landowner. In 1689 Montmorency was officially renamed Enghien (read history section below), but the village on the slopes of the promontory was still referred to as \\"Montmorency\\" by most people. Indeed, during the French Revolution, at the creation of French communes in 1790, the newly born commune was named Montmorency. Three years later in 1793, at the peak of the French Revolution, the name of the commune, which was probably thought of as too reminiscent of the overthrown Ancien R√©gime, was changed into √âmile, in honor of French philosopher and writer Jean-Jacques Rousseau who had composed his educational treaty √âmile a few decades earlier while in residence at Montmorency. In 1813 the commune was renamed Montmorency. In 1815, at the Restoration of monarchy, the commune was renamed Enghien. Throughout these troubled years, however, the village was always referred to as \\"Montmorency\\" by the locals, regardless of what the official name was in all its changes. Lac d'Enghien with a view of Montmorency The name \\"Enghien\\", on the other hand, was used for the lake and marshland in the valley beneath Montmorency, an area that was withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the commune of Montmorency/Enghien in 1790, and was divided between the jurisdictions of several neighboring communes. In other words, the place called \\"Enghien\\" was not located within the commune of Enghien. This confusing situation was ended on 27 November 1832, when the commune of Enghien was definitely renamed Montmorency. In 1850, the area of Enghien, which had developed as a spa resort, was incorporated as a commune (named Enghien-les- Bains) by detaching its territory from the territory of four communes neighboring Montmorency. The commune of Montmorency did not lose territory and as such was not affected by the incorporation of the commune of Enghien-les- Bains. History Montmorency was the fief of the Montmorency family, one of the oldest and most distinguished families of the French nobility, who owed their name to the location of their ancestral castle on the promontory of Montmorency. The castle of Montmorency was destroyed by the English during the Hundred Years' War and was not rebuilt. After the Hundred Years' War, the Montmorency moved their residence to the Ch√¢teau d'√âcouen in √âcouen, to the northeast of Montmorency. In 1632 the last Montmorency, Henri II de Montmorency, was executed for treason in Toulouse and the duchy of Montmorency was inherited by the Princes of Cond√©, a cadet branch of the French royal family who, like the Montmorency, did not reside in Montmorency, choosing instead the Ch√¢teau de Chantilly as their residence. In 1689 King Louis XIV allowed the duchy of Montmorency to be renamed duchy of Enghien, in memory of the duchy of Enghien (modern-day Belgium) which the Princes of Cond√© had lost in 1569 at the death of Louis I de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√©. Montmorency/Enghien was the fief of the Princes of Cond√© until the French Revolution. The art collector Pierre Crozat had a country retreat here in the first half of the 18th century, the fashionable Ch√¢teau de Montmorency, which was at the centre of social gatherings. It contained a chapel decorated in 1715-16 by Pierre Le Gros the YoungerGerhard Bissell, Pierre le Gros, 1666-1719, Reading, Berkshire 1997, pp. 16-17, 119. and paintings by Charles de La Fosse.Germaid Ruck, Lafosse, Charles de, in: Allgemeines K√ºnstlerlexikon, vol. 82, de Gruyter, Berlin 2014, p. 475. The building was demolished in 1817. In addition, the Montmorency cherry, a popular sour cherry variety, derives its name from the town. Transport The closest station to Montmorency is Enghien-les-Bains station on the Transilien Paris - Nord suburban rail line and it takes 15 minutes from Paris Gare du Nord to get there. This station is located in the neighboring commune of Enghien-les- Bains, from the town center of Montmorency. From there you can take the buses 15M or 13 to get into the city center.

It is the largest community in Swansea county. Morriston is sometimes referred to as a distinct townMorriston Ward Profile September 2008 (e.g. the local football club is named Morriston Town A.F.C.), however it has never had a town charter,Archives Network Wales and is now part of the continuous urban sprawl around Swansea, the centre of which lies three miles to the south-west. It is the most populous of Swansea's electoral divisions and is situated close to other communities including Plasmarl, Treboeth, Llansamlet, Cwmrhydyceirw, Clase, Ynystawe and Ynysforgan. Landscape and geography Morriston is in the Lower Swansea Valley, adjoining the River Tawe, on terrain sloping gently downwards to the east and steeply upwards to the west. It is centred on Woodfield Street, a shopping area that runs in a north-south axis. The street features two of Morriston's most notable structures, the Church of St John and Tabernacle Chapel. In its original design, St John, locally known as \\"Church in the Middle of the Road\\", was the centre piece of Morriston. It has fallen into disrepair and is no longer used as a church. Tabernacle Chapel is a Grade I listed building designed by architect John Humphrey and built between 1870 and 1872. Tabernacle has sometimes been called \\"the Cathedral of Welsh non-conformity\\". The two buildings remain the town's main landmarks along with Morriston Hospital and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), both major employers in the area. The hospital, the largest in Swansea, is located in Cwmrhydyceirw, about one mile north of Morriston town centre. The DVLA is in Clase, a suburb west of Morriston; it processes all British driver and vehicle registrations. The remainder of Morriston can be divided into three areas: * an area of early 19th century two-storey terraced houses around the main area of shops; * areas further north, close to the M4 motorway, largely composed of semi-detached housing built from the 1940s to the 1960s; * a mix of 19th- century and more recently built houses along Clydach Road in Ynystawe. Retail The heart of the town retail community is at Woodfield Street, which consists of many small shops and pubs. Once a month the street is closed to traffic for Morriston Market, a monthly street market selling Welsh produce from hand-made items to fresh food. The nearby Swansea Enterprise Park comprises national chains. Transport Morriston was originally located next to the Swansea Canal, which, along with the River Tawe, was essential for the transport of goods in the Swansea Valley. The canal was superseded by rail and roads with Morriston now conveniently located just off Junction 45 of the M4 motorway and adjacent to the A4067. The nearest railway stations are at Llansamlet and Swansea High Street. Until the 1960s, Morriston had two railway stations, Morriston East and Morriston West on the Morriston Branch of the Swansea District line and the Swansea Vale Railway. Both stations no longer exist. The Swansea District line is still in use, transporting freight traffic and also for the Fishguard to Cardiff/Cheltenham Spa passenger service. It runs through northern Morriston with a viaduct at Clydach Road. The centre of Morriston contains a large car park and has bus routes from Morriston Hospital into Swansea City Centre and on to Swansea University with services provided by First (South & West Wales). The area has two taxi offices with a taxi lane in Woodfield Street. Tabernacle Chapel 220x220px Tabernacle Chapel is the outstanding building in the centre of Morriston and visually dominates the area. It has been described as the \\"Non-Conformist Cathedral of Wales\\" while Anthony Jones, in his 1996 definitive book \\"Welsh Chapels\\" described the chapel as \\"The largest, grandest and most expensive chapel built in Wales\\". The book features the iconic Grade 1-listed building as its cover-photograph. Victorian industrialisation brought rapid population growth to the Lower Swansea Valley, close to the port of Swansea, as rural workers sought new employment opportunities in many tinplate and copper works established in the area. Welsh Nonconformity enjoyed great popularity; a dozen chapels were built in the Morriston area alone in the latter half of the 19th century and Tabernacle, planned as the ultimate evocation of a Welsh chapel in terms of architecture, space and facilities, was completed in 1872 at a staggering cost of ¬£18,000. The design was evolved by three prominent figures in the area: the minister, Emlyn Jones, the architect, John Humphrey and the contractor Daniel Edwards. The Cambrian national newspaper described it as \\"the one great redeeming feature in that manufacturing district, an oasis in a desert\\". Morriston Park Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet of Clasemont, built a mansion in 1775 called Clasemont at Pengwern on the western slopes of the Lower Swansea valley. The mansion had a garden of extensive open grassland giving way to a wooded wilderness and panoramic vista. In 1911, Swansea Corporation purchased 47 acres of Clasemont which became Morriston Park in 1912. For several years the park received investment and new facilities, hosting many activities, carnivals and musical performances. It once incorporated a large ornate bandstand, swimming baths, lido, aviary, cricket pitch, changing rooms, shop and even a 9-hole golf course. But in recent years all of these assets, and more, have disappeared. Over the years the significance of Morriston Park has slipped from the collective consciousness. It now suffers from severe drainage problems with many paths and borders overgrown and in poor condition. Despite this neglect, the park still maintains the structure of an 18th century landscape garden with magnificent views over the Lower Swansea valley. Industrial heritage Morris Castle Morriston is part of the Lower Swansea Valley. Over a period of about 150 years up until the 1920s, the valley was one of the most heavily industrialised areas of the developed world. Morriston was constructed as \\"Wales' earliest planned industrial village\\" and was laid out on a grid pattern designed by William Edwards The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008 and named after its founder, Sir John Morris, Bt. The grid pattern remains in evidence today. Morris originally named the town \\"Morris Town\\", but this was shortened into the single word \\"Morriston\\" with the Welsh language translation being Treforys. Morriston was initially constructed for the workers of the tinplate and copper industries that built up along the banks of the River Tawe in the 18th century. The Swansea Canal also ran through the area transporting coal, limestone and other products along the valley but it was drained from Clydach to Swansea in the 1970s. Some small remains, including a footbridge, are still present in Morriston. Tin-plating had almost vanished from the area by the end of the Second World War, with production in South West Wales concentrated at new works in Felindre and Port Talbot.Introduction: Historical Background Morriston - Treboeth History Group Sir John Morris was also responsible for the construction between 1768 and 1774 of Morris Castle, considered to have been the world's first accommodation built specifically for workers by their employer. Little of the structure remains today, although its ruins are visible on high ground above the nearby Landore district. Arts Morriston has two choirs. Morriston Orpheus Choir was formed in 1935 and performs around 25 engagements annually and undertakes performances on television and at national events. Morriston RFC Male Choir was formed in 1979 by members of the local rugby club. It is one of the foremost Welsh choirs. Sport Morriston R.F.C. is a rugby clubMorriston R.F.C. founded in 1876 and based at Maes Collen. It is one of the founder clubs of the current Welsh Rugby Union and feeder club to the Ospreys region. The club caters for all age group rugby from age 6 to youth & senior sides and has produced many players who have achieved international honours including Ross Moriarty. Morriston has several amateur association football clubs, most of which play in the Swansea Senior League: Morriston A.F.C. is a former Welsh Football League team based at The Dingle. Morriston Athletic, Morriston Olympic and C.R.C. Rangers are also based in Morriston. Games between Morriston Olympic and C.R.C (Cwmrhydyceirw) Rangers are fiercely contested, with scores of supporters lining the pitch at Tir Canol whenever the two sides meet. Morriston Cricket Club was formed in 1865 and is the oldest sporting organisation in Morriston. The club plays its home matches at Tircanol adjacent to the Rugby Club and is affiliated to the South Wales Cricket Association.

Early life and work Born in Porto Alegre, at the age of 2, Tizuka moved back with her Japanese immigrants parents to the city of Atibaia, in the state of S√£o Paulo. In her teenage years, Yamasaki moved to S√£o Paulo city for an undergraduate course in architecture, though she changed her mind before her admission and moved to Bras√≠lia to study cinema instead. Yamasaki finished college in Rio de Janeiro, where she started her professional career. Yamasaki was one of the first women filmmakers in Brazil who achieved a successful and longstanding career. She and her peers learned filmmaking by working on the sets of well- established Cinema Novo directors. Yamasaki worked as director assistant with Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Glauber Rocha. Yamasaki challenged the norms of Cinema Novo by increasing both the representation of women and the awareness of issues affecting women in Brazilian society. Her film style focuses on historical subjects and she uses the genre of melodrama to reconstruct Brazilian politics, history and culture. Yamasaki established herself as one of the most important film directors of the 1980s. Her films discussed sexuality and traditional gender roles more openly within Brazilian cultural identity. Yamasaki initiated a ‚Äúcinema of emotion‚Äù to comment on Brazil's past and rework female figures‚Äô experiences in Brazil's history. She's also a director of telenovelas and TV series. Yamasaki began her work with auteur- style films, then transitioned to work in television. Yamaski continued to reference auteur cinema within her TV series productions. Yamasaki's work challenged glamorous Brazilian television by focusing on natural and realistic images. During her career, especially during the final years of the dictatorship, Yamasaki has suffered censorship and funding issues with her films. In response to these challenges, Yamasaki established her own production company in 1976, Centro de Produ√ß√£o e Comunica√ß√£o (Production and Communication Center). This enabled her to bypass government regulations and become eligible for production funding from Embrafilme. Tizuka gained some critical acclaim with her 1980 film Gaijin, Os Caminhos da Liberdade (aka Gaijin, a Brazilian Odyssey), a story about Japanese immigration to Brazil. She has, however, been criticized for directing overly commercial movies with the children TV show hostess Xuxa. In 2003, she completed Gaijin 2 as a sequel to her debut film.

Biography  Krieger was born on 4 February 1865 in the Kingdom of Bavaria, the son of a master brewer. At an early age he gained an interest in astronomy. He only received school education up to the age of 15, when he departed. However he gained an inheritance, and used the money to build an observatory in the suburbs of Munich. He had been inspired by the director of the Cologne Observatory, Hermann Klein, to make the study and observation of the Moon his life's work. Krieger decided to create a definitive map of the Moon. For this purpose he obtained a series of low-resolution negatives of the lunar surface that had been taken at the Lick and Paris observatories. He enlarged these images and used them to provide positional accuracy for his subsequent drawings. His illustrations of the Moon were made in charcoal, graphite pencil, and ink, and were considered superior to any previously produced lunar maps in their accuracy and level of detail, and continue to be considered works of art. He lived long enough to see his first 28 plates published as volume 1 of his \\"Mond Atlas\\". However his health had suffered, possibly due to his long nightly labors at his telescope. About 10 years following his death, his remaining drawings and sketches were published in a second volume by the Austrian selenographer Rudolf K√∂nig.

In addition to GTTV, Keighley has been involved in many other video game-related projects on television. On Comcast's G4 network, he appeared as the network's lead anchor for its E3 press conference coverage, interviewing CEOs from companies like Sony and Electronic Arts. For MTV he created the concept and produced (with LivePlanet) \\"Gears of War: Race to E3\\" and \\"Gears of War: Race to Launch\\", two specials that took viewers inside the development of the hit Xbox 360 game from Microsoft. And in 2007, the Discovery Channel aired a five-hour documentary on releases including those of such companies as World of Wonder Productions, based on a treatment by Keighley, who also served as consulting producer. Geoff has also hosted and co-produced a number of video game launch specials for Spike TV, including \\"Madden NFL 08 Kickoff\\" featuring a performance by Ozzy Osbourne and \\"Halo 3: Launched!\\" featuring a performance by Linkin Park. He was also interviewed on what became a controversial Fox News' segment on Mass Effect, and was later praised by gamers online for being the only one on the show who had actually played the game. Keighley was invited by the producers of Spike's Video Game Awards program to help with the programming from 2006 onward. In 2013, Spike changed the format of the show and rebranded the awards as the VGX Awards. To Keighley, the format became more commercial and promotional rather than a celebration of video game achievements, and subsequently left the show. Through 2014, he funded his own efforts to put together a new awards show, gaining the support of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo as well as major publications and industry leaders. Keighley thus established The Game Awards which were first presented in December 2014, and which Keighley remains the primary host. Keighley is known for writing reviews and previews and going behind the scenes of the game industry for in-depth business profiles and lengthy feature pieces. While initially a writer at GameSpot from around 1998, Keighley wrote the site's column \\"Behind the Games\\". This column evolved into a series of articles \\"The Final Hours\\", where he has in-depth access to the various studios near the end of a development period and write in depth about the process as the game is nearing completion. In more recent years, these articles are released as mobile apps. In a July 2008 interview on The Jace Hall Show, Keighley spoke about the importance of this process, stating \\"There's such a lack of investigative journalism. I wish I had more time to do more, sort of, investigation. Really dig into some of these bigger issues, so I could look at like, the 'Red Ring of Death' problem. That's never really been properly reported about, like what really happens.\\" However, he has faced criticism from some quarters for his willingness to positively present games to maintain exclusives, regardless of their actual quality, and to accept industry PR at face value in an October 2012 column published in Eurogamer. In December 2016, Keighley was picked as a judge for the Viveport Developer Awards (VDAs). Keighley had been a participant of E3, the annual video game trade show, since its start, and starting in E3 2017, Keighley had arranged and hosted the E3 Coliseum, a live-streaming event running over the course of E3 that brought in developers and publishers at E3 for interviews and other discussions. However, with the Entertainment Software Association making significant changes to the format of E3 2020 (prior to its cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Keighley stated he will not be organizing an E3 Coliseum event nor attending the show for the first time in 25 years. With E3's cancellation among other several other trade shows and events like Gamescom from the pandemic, Keighley worked with several major publishers and video game industry leaders to launch the Summer Game Fest from May to August 2020. During this period, Keighley helped developers and publishers present game announcements and other presentations, along with Steam and Xbox to provide game demos during this period. Other appearances Keighley appeared as a holographic character in the game Death Stranding. Controversy In a column on Eurogamer, former journalist Robert Florence accused Keighley and others of often being \\"in bed\\" with the video game industry. The controversial piece was met with both praise and criticism with several changes made by its editor Tom Bramwell due to legal action.

From 1976 to his death, he was Professor in the department of philosophy of the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research in New York City. He wrote all his major published work in French.  Biography  Born in Amsterdam in 1941 of German parents, Reiner Sch√ºrmann studied philosophy and theology with the Dominicans of Le Centre d'√©tudes du Saulchoir near Paris, between 1962 and 1969, and received a Doctorate in Philosophy from the University of Sorbonne in Paris in 1981. It was as a Dominican priest that he first came to the United States in 1971, teaching first at The Catholic University of America in Washington DC, then at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. In 1976, he left the priesthood and began teaching philosophy at the New School for Social Research as a prot√©g√© of Hannah Arendt and Hans Jonas. Reiner Sch√ºrmann died of complications caused by AIDS on August 20, 1993 in New York City.  Work  One of Sch√ºrmann's best- known works is Heidegger on Being and Acting: From Principles to Anarchy (1990 reprint ). In this work, Sch√ºrmann reflects on the difference between the findings of Heidegger the thinker and the beliefs of Heidegger the man, and incidentally shows Heidegger's intellectual honesty in following these thoughts in spite of his personal upbringing and beliefs. In his only literary work, Les Origines, which was awarded the Prix Broquette-Gonin by the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise in 1977, he provides an autobiographical account of a pilgrimage of errancy, a search for redemption from the inauthentic thrownness of a past filled with memories of guilt and despair, of being born German during World War II, \\"too late to see the war, too early to forget it.\\" In 1996, the French philosopher G√©rard Granel published posthumously the French original of Sch√ºrmann's monumental work Broken Hegemonies (\\"Des H√©g√©monies bris√©es\\", Mauvezin, T.E.R., 1996).

Its ramparts and gateworks remain fully intact. History The town's history dates back to 1500 B.C., when Phoenicians occupied a site called Silis, Zili, Zilis, or Zilil (, , or , ) which is being excavated at Dchar Jdid, some NE of present Asilah; that place was once considered to be the Roman stronghold Ad Mercuri, but is now accepted to be Zilil. The town of Asilah itself was partly constructed by the Idrisid dynasty, and Cordoban caliph Al-Hakam II rebuilt the town in 966. The Portuguese conquered the city in 1471 and built its fortifications, but it was abandoned it because of an economic debt crisis in 1549. In 1578, Sebastian of Portugal used Asilah as a base for his troops during a planned crusade that resulted in Sebastian's death, which in turn caused the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580. In 1589 the Moroccans briefly regained control of Asilah, but then lost it to the Spanish. In 1692, the town was again taken by the Moroccans under the leadership of Moulay Ismail. Asilah served then as a base for pirates in the 19th and 20th centuries, and in 1829, the Austrians punitively bombarded the city due to Moroccan piracy. From 1912 to 1956, it was part of Spanish Morocco. A major plan to restore the town was undertaken in 1978 by its mayor, Mohamed Benaissa. Benaissa and painter Mohamed Melehi were instrumental in organizing an art festival, the International Cultural Moussem of Asilah, that starting in 1978 began generating tourism income. It is credited with having promoted urban renewal in Asilah, and is one of the most important art festivals in the country. It played a role in raising the average monthly income from $50 in 1978 to $140 in 2014. The festival features local artwork and music and continues to attract large numbers of tourists. Asilah is now a popular seaside resort, with modern holiday apartment complexes on the coast road leading to the town from Tangier. The old neighborhoods are restored and painted white, and the wealthy from Casablanca have their weekend getaways here. Culture While tourism dominates, Asilah is said to offer a good introduction to Morocco. It hosts annual music and arts festivals, including a mural-painting festival. Thursday is market day. The International Cultural Festival, held in August, features jazz and Moroccan music as well as art exhibitions. The festival is also the occasion for mural painting in which the medina's houses are painted with new murals every year. Many of the houses of Asilah feature mashrabiya (oriel windows). The main cultural center is the Centre Hassan II des Rencontres Internationales (housed in a former Spanish barracks), which hosts festivals in the summer. Due to its proximity to Spain, the cuisine in Asilah is described as Ibero-Moroccan with notable delicacies including paella, anchovies, and other seafood with both Moroccan and Valencian flavor influences.  Notable landmarks  = The medina = The old walled town (medina) of Asilah is well-preserved and dates mostly from the Portuguese occupation (15th-16th century) and afterwards. The medina has been heavily restored and its buildings are typically painted white, with occasionally blue or green, in addition to which can be found many of the murals created during the International Cultural Festival. Though the Portuguese rebuilt its outline of walls, it has the typical maze-like layout and alleys of an old Moroccan city. File:Assilah.jpgView of the medina from the sea pier. File:Asilah.jpgStreet in the medina. File:Asilah marabout.jpgStreet and marabout's tomb in the medina. File:Assilah Waterfront1.jpgPromenade/street along the sea walls.

File:Asilah (36890237955).jpgMural featuring Arabic calligraphy.  Walls and towers  The walls of Asilah were first built by the Almohads and then restored and reinforced by the Marinids and the Wattasids. However, after the Portuguese took the city in 1471 they rebuilt the walls, making them more resistant to artillery, and modified the outline of the city, shrinking its perimeter for easier control. The current walls thus date almost entirely from the Portuguese occupation, with the possible exception of some parts of the seaside walls. There are two main gates in the walls, Bab Homar, in the mid-southern part of the walls, and Bab al-Qasaba, at the eastern end of the walls where the kasbah was once located. A rectangular tower in distinct Portuguese style, known as Borj al-Hamra (\\"Red Tower\\") or the Al-Qamra Tower, stands near the kasbah and overlooks an open square.

Grand Mosque of Asilah  The Grand Mosque of Asilah is located inside the former kasbah (citadel), at the eastern end of the medina. It was built under Moulay Ismail soon after the city was retaken for Morocco at the end of the 17th century. Moulay Ismail charged the new governor of Tangier, Ali ibn Abdallah Errifi, with building the mosque; however, it's possible that it was his son, Ahmed Errifi, who actually carried out the construction. It has an octagonal minaret, a feature common to some parts of northern Morocco but not in the rest of the country. With its whitewashed walls and minaret, its decoration is quite plain compared to other mosques built by the Errifis at the same time (such as the Kasbah Mosque in Tangier). Like other Moroccan mosques, it is open to Muslims only. File:Assilah 05.jpgGrand Mosque and minaret. File:Mesquita em Asilah (2).jpgEntrance of the Grand Mosque.  Raisuli Palace (Palais Raissouli)  Raisuli Palace exterior. This restored palace is in the mid-northern part of the medina, alongside the sea walls. It was built in 1909 by Moulay Ahmed er-Raisuni (also known as Raisuli), a local rogue and pirate who rose to power and declared himself pasha of the region. He rose to notoriety and wealth partly through kidnappings and ransoms, including of several Westerners who wrote about him afterwards. The palace has been restored and reveals some of the luxury in which Raisuli lived. It includes a lavish reception room with zellij tilework, carved stucco, and painted wood like in other Moroccan palaces. The reception room also gives access to a large loggia and terrace overlooking the sea. Raisuli infamously claimed that he executed convicted murderers by forcing them to jump from this terrace onto the sea rocks below.  Sidi Mansour cemetery (seaside cemetery)  At the far western end of the medina is a Portuguese bastion extending out to sea, which is a popular spot for locals and tourists at sunset. In the angle between the bastion and the sea walls is a platform upon which is a small enclosed cemetery. It includes two small structures, the domed Marabout (mausoleum) of Sidi Ahmed ibn Moussa (also known as Sidi Ahmed el-Mansour and Sidi Mansour) and, across from it, the mausoleum of his sister, Lalla Mennana. Between these structures, the ground is covered with other graves which are covered in colourful ceramic tiles. File:Asilah sea cemetery2.jpgView of the cemetery's platform on the shore. File:Cemetery in Asilah.jpgView of the graves. = Church of San Bartolome = Located in the new city outside the medina, this Roman Catholic Church was built by Spanish Franciscans in 1925. It is still used as a convent today and is one of the only churches in Morocco allowed to ring in public for Sunday mass. Its architecture is a mix of Spanish Colonial and Moorish styles.

Sometimes neology is seen as related to the development of new isms, since a new word can mean a new idea.  Neology in theology  Neology (\\"study of new [things]\\") was the name given to the rationalist theology of Germany or the rationalisation of the Christian religionNuttall.

In Greek mythology, the Old Man of the Sea (; ) was a primordial figure who could be identified as any of several water-gods, generally Nereus or Proteus, but also Triton, Pontus, Phorcys or Glaucus. He is the father of Thetis (the mother of Achilles).Iliad, Book I, line 588 (Stanley Lombardo's notation)  Mythology  In book 4 of Homer's Odyssey, Menelaus recounts to Telemachus his journey home, and how he had to seek the advice of the Old Man of the Sea. The Old Man can answer any questions if captured, but capturing him means holding on as he changes from one form to another. Menelaus captured him, and during the course of questioning, asked if Telemachus' father Odysseus was still alive.  Sinbad  Sinbad the Sailor encountered the monstrous Old Man of the Sea () on his fifth voyage. The Old Man of the Sea in the Sinbad tales was said to trick a traveller into letting him ride on his shoulders while the traveller transported him across a stream. However, the Old Man would then not release his grip, forcing his victim to transport him wherever he pleased and allowing his victim little rest. The Old Man's victims all eventually died of this miserable treatment,With the old man either eating them or else robbing them. Sinbad, however, after getting the Old Man drunk with wine, was able to shake him off and kill him. References in poetry The Old Man of the Sea is alluded to in Edwin Arlington Robinson's book-length narrative poem King Jasper.Robinson, Edwin Arlington. King Jasper, New York, The Macmillan Company, 1935. In part 3 of the poem, King Jasper dreams of his deceased friend Hebron (whom Jasper betrayed) riding on his back. \\"You cannot fall yet, and I'm riding nicely,\\" Hebron tells Jasper. \\"If only we might have the sight of water, / We'd say that I'm the Old Man of the Sea, / And you Sinbad the Sailor.\\" Hebron then turns to gold (a symbol of Jasper's motivation for betraying him) and coaxes Jasper to leap across a ravine with the heavy, golden Hebron on his back. The Old Man of the Sea also figures in the poetry of West Indian poet Derek Walcott. In a 1965 paper, \\"The Figure of Crusoe\\", writing about the poem \\"Crusoe's Journal\\", Walcott notes: > It is not the Crusoe you recognize. I have compared him to Proteus, that > mythological figure who changes shapes according to what we need him to be. > Perhaps my mythology is wrong. I am, however, also summoning, in the > combination of Crusoe and Proteus, the Old Man of the Sea with whom a > mythological hero wrestled. The commercial Crusoe gives his name to our > brochures and hotels. He has become the property of the Trinidad and Tobago > Tourist board, and although it is the same symbol that I use, you must allow > me to make him various, contradictory and as changeable as the Old Man of > the Sea. (...) My Crusoe, then, is Adam. Christopher Columbus, God, a > missionary, a beachcomber, and his interpreter, Daniel Defoe. Referencing the figures of Adam, Christofer (Columbus) and Friday in succession, the poem's narrator remarks, \\"All shapes, all objects multiplied from his,/our ocean's Proteus;/in childhood, his derelict's old age/was like a god's.\\" References in other works The Old Man of the Sea is briefly mentioned in Michael Scott's The Sorceress: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel to prevent Perenelle Flamel from escaping Alcatraz.

It is based out of a roundhouse on Cleveland Ave. in St. Paul just blocks south of the former Amtrak station and its main yard is just to the north of the station. Its lines consist of one to Fridley, with an interchange with Canadian National Railway and a small yard in New Brighton. The railroad also runs to Hugo and Bayport on trackage rights. It interchanges with BNSF Railway at Northtown yard. It also serves east Minneapolis' grain elevators by the University of Minnesota as well as the grain elevators on Minnesota State Highway 55 adjacent to the METRO Blue Line. The Minnesota Commercial connects with all major railroads in the Twin Cities including: Canadian National Railway, BNSF Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, Union Pacific Railway, Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad, and Twin Cities and Western Railroad. The MNNR's roster consists of mainly Alco and GE locomotives. With over two dozen locomotives, including one from Hamersley Iron in Australia, the roster is diverse and meets the switching and road freight needs. Most units wear a red paint scheme much like that of the Green Bay and Western Railroad. The line was formerly known as the Minnesota Transfer Railroad. It was privately owned by the major railroads serving the Twin Cities area. The Minnesota Transfer was purchased by the Minnesota Commercial on February 1, 1987. At the time Minnesota Commercial purchased Minnesota Transfer, the railroad was down to 8,000 revenue units a year. By 2008, the Minnesota Commercial was handling over 46,000 revenue units.

Etymology  The word Azemmour comes from the Berber word Azemmur (\\"wild olive tree\\"). History Azemmour is generally identified as the Punic Azama, latinized as Asama. Before 1486, it was a dependency of the King of Fez. In 1486 its inhabitants became vassals and tributaries of Jo√£o II of Portugal. In 1513 Azemmour's governor Moulay Zayam refused to pay the tribute and mustered a powerful, well-equipped army. Manuel responded to this challenge by sending a massive fleet of 500 ships and 15 thousand soldiers (Bergreen, 19). James, Duke of Braganza led this army and on September 1st he conquered the city with no resistance from its inhabitants. Ferdinand Magellan, the man famed for leading the first-ever circumnavigation of the earth, was among the Portuguese soldiers there; he lost his horse in skirmishes outside the city. Portuguese control of the city lasted only for a short period; it was abandoned by Jo√£o III of Portugal in 1541 due to his court's economic difficulties. Geography Azemmour is located on the Oum Er-Rbia River west of Casablanca. Azemmour's beach is a place for surfing and kitesurfing. Also called Haouzia, the area's flora includes eucalyptus and pine. Culture A spring festival used to be held annually in Azemmour in March. It was first held in 2007. The patron saint of Azemmour is Abu Shuayb. His mausoleum was built on the order of Mohammed ben Abdallah. Each year, a moussem is celebrated to honour him. The Old City's walls are decorated by several local artists.Travel guide of Lonely Planet: Morocco, 9th Edition Feb 2009, p. 149. The city features a Portuguese medina, which has three parts, a Jewish mellah, a kasbah, and the old medina. A historic lighthouse called Sidi Boubeker is located north of Azemmour. Notable natives or residents *Estevanico, also known as Esteban the Moor, was enslaved and traveled with a Spanish expedition to North America in 1527. He is the first African to travel with explorers in North America and was one of four men out of several hundred to survive shipwrecks on the Florida and Texas coasts, Native American slavery and attacks, and other setbacks over a six-year period before he and his party reached safety in a Spanish colonial town. *Abdallah Laroui, Moroccan historian, novelist and philosopher Images Image:20090807_Azemmour_Morocco_2.jpg  Azemmour old city.

Before settling on the Wrathchild America name in 1988, the band had performed under the names Atlantis, Tyrant, and Wrathchild. They released two studio albums through Atlantic Records, and gained charting success through the Billboard 200. In 1992, they changed their name to Souls at Zero. The band is also notable for including one-time Kix member Brad Divens, and a then-unknown Shannon Larkin, who went on to become the drummer for many bands such as Ugly Kid Joe, Candlebox, and Godsmack. History Wrathchild was formed in 1978 by high school friends, Shannon Larkin, Kevin Keller, and Terry Carter. Keller met Carter after school in band class and was asked to join up with his friend Larkin. They had a band at the time named \\"Atlantis\\". Ralph \\"Rat\\" Tillman and Max \\"Tuck\\" McDonald soon joined and changed the name to Tyrant and then later to Wrathchild. Brad was recruited by Kevin Keller by throwing business cards at him while he was performing with his band \\"Ratzalad\\". John Turner was soon hired from his band \\"The Shift\\". Wrathchild was a renowned live act in the mid to late 1980s all across the U.S. when they were known simply as Wrathchild. After years of touring, playing gigs, and hard work, the band finally was signed to a major label in 1988 thanks in large part to the dedicated work of Chip Seligman. However, a British glam metal band with the same name, Wrathchild, sued and forced the delay of the debut release. The band amended their name by adding America, and their debut album Climbin' the Walls peaked at No. 190 on the Billboard 200. Though only given a half of a songwriting credit for the song \\"London After Midnight\\", Keller also co-wrote the songs: \\"No Deposit, No Return\\" and \\"Day of the Thunder\\". Their second album, 3-D (1991), coincided with the decline of the thrash metal scene and did not chart. During its existence, the band toured or played selected shows with such bands as Slayer, Exodus, Testament, Annihilator, Pantera, Nuclear Assault, Armored Saint, Gang Green, Voivod, Vio-lence and Dark Angel, among others. Around 1992, Wrathchild America was dropped from Atlantic Records and changed their name to Souls at Zero and revamped their stylistic approach. According to a posting on Tartarean Desire, former Toxik drummer Tad Leger has launched a brand new project called Lucertola (Italian for \\"lizard\\"). The group's musical style is said to be a blend of Leger's biggest influences: doom, old Voivod and Italian horror soundtracks (Goblin, Fabio Frizzi). Tad started out recording both guitar and drums himself, but was joined by his old Blackened Sky bandmate Andy Abbene and his brother Jay Abbene (Wrathchild America, Souls at Zero) in early December 2005. Kevin Keller went on to perform with Salem with former members of Sabotage, formed his current band Vulgar Bullet in 2000. Terry Carter became involved in country music and is currently touring. Brad Divens has become one of the best FOH sound engineers. Shannon Larkin went on to be the driving force in Godsmack. By December 2016, rumors were circulating that a Wrathchild America reunion was in the works. Frontman Brad Divens posted video clips of rehearsal videos on Facebook in mid-2017.

It is located at 3600 Hennepin Avenue at the southern end of the Uptown area. It is noted for its chapel which is on the National Register of Historic Places and was modeled after the Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey. History About 250 acres in size, Lakewood memorializes the dead with more than 100,000 monuments and markers. Long considered one of the most beautiful cemeteries in the country, it was modeled after the rural cemeteries of 19th-century France, such as P√®re-Lachaise in Paris. When Lakewood was established in 1871 rural cemeteries were becoming more popular as part of a growing trend away from churchyard burials in the heart of the city. Tiny Tim's tomb can be seen at left In July 1871 Colonel William S. King, local businessman and newspaper publisher, proposed to community leaders of the city that they work together to establish a cemetery \\"on some of the beautiful locations out near the lakes, where the encroachments of the city would never seriously interfere.\\" In August of the same year a meeting was held for establishing the Lyndale Cemetery Association (Changed to Lakewood in Feb of 1872). According to the minutes of the original meeting recorded by Thomas Lowry, \\"that after an examination of various localities they had chosen the land owned by William S. King lying between Lakes Calhoun and Harriet.\\" Colonel King agreed to sell his land for the purpose at a cost of $21,000, \\"to be paid back over a year at 7 percent interest.\\" The first trustees voted to raise $25,000 to purchase the land and make improvements at a time when the cost of a home in Minneapolis was about $500. The money was raised by selling 250 shares of stock at $100 a piece, two-thirds of which was purchased by the trustees themselves. The remaining balance was solicited by a committee and sold to other local investors. In April 1872 Superintendent A.B. Barton and the board of trustees employed C. W. Folsom, Superintendent of Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts to develop plans for the new cemetery. In October 1872 the Association reacquired all stocks that had been sold to the public. The public dedication of Lakewood was held on September 16, 1872, with \\"a large number of lots being selected at the close of the exercise by the citizens present.\\" Many of the earliest lots sold in the 1870s-1880s remained unused until 1972 when they were reclaimed for resale to the public. The first person buried in Lakewood Cemetery was Maggie Menzel who died on January 24, 1872 at the age of nineteen. Interior of the Memorial Chapel dome Architect Harry Wild Jones designed the cemetery's chapel which began construction in August 1908. Built of the finest materials, the chapel seats about 200 and is renowned for its beauty and superb acoustics. The dome is 65 feet high with 24 stained glass windows inset its full circumference. Charles R. Lamb of New York orchestrated the design of the chapel's interior mosaic artwork. Six highly skilled artists of Italy were enlisted to create 10 million tessellae in Venice, which were then shipped to Lakewood where those same artists performed the arduous task of assembling them in the chapel's interior. Completed in 1910, the chapel's total cost of construction was $150,000. Lakewood Chapel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 20, 1983. Cremation services were begun in 1910 and have continued to the present day. In 1965-67 a community mausoleum and columbarium was built with enough space for over 5000 crypts and niches. One of the building's more notable features are the 24 eight-foot stained glass windows by Willet Stained Glass Studios of Philadelphia. A large reflecting pool just outside the mausoleum's east side extends toward the garden crypt area and Lakewood's historic chapel nearby. The Garden Mausoleum In 2012, a new Garden Mausoleum, designed by HGA Architects of Minneapolis, was opened alongside the reflecting pool, adding a further 879 crypts and 4,620 cremation niches. Since its inception in 1872 Lakewood has continued to operate as a non-profit, non-denominational cemetery providing funeral services to the public. Many Minneapolis streets, parks, and monuments bear the names of the Lakewood's original founders -- Thomas Lowry, William D. Washburn, and Charles M. Loring, to name a few. The cemetery itself memorializes many notable persons, including former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, Civil War General Lewis A. Grant, and Senator Paul Wellstone who was killed in a plane crash in 2002. McMullen monument by sculptor Nellie Walker Fridley Monument Notable burials Monument for the family of T. B.

McKee is the author of Story: Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting, Dialogue: the Art of Verbal Action for Stage, Page and Screen and Storynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World. McKee also has the blog and online writers' resource \\"Storylogue\\". Robert McKee‚Äôs \\"Story Seminars\\" have been held around the globe including Boston, Moscow, Amsterdam, Beijing, Mumbai, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney and yearly in New York City, Los Angeles, and London. The 3-day seminar teaches writers the principles of storytelling. McKee's one-day \\"Genre Seminars\\" teach writers the conventions of different styles of storytelling including thriller, comedy, horror, love story, action story, and writing for television. Rather than teaching story as a \\"mechanical\\" form, McKee gained notoriety for teaching story principles, allowing writers for theater, novels, film and television freedom to apply them as they wish provided the story ultimately \\"works\\". After consulting on business storytelling for various multinational companies including Microsoft, Nike, Hewlett-Packard, Time Warner, and Siemens, in 2013 McKee launched a seminar for the business community in Los Angeles, New York City, Beijing, and Malta. In 2018, McKee partnered with digital marketer and Skyword CEO Tom Gerace to write Storynomics: Story-Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World. Storynomics, and the accompanying seminar, instructs leaders, managers and marketers how to use story in strategic management, brand management, and business communications.  Early life in the theater  Robert McKee began his theater career at the age of 9, playing the title role in a community theater production of 'Martin the Shoemaker'. He continued acting as a teenager in theater productions in his hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Upon receiving the Evans Scholarship, he attended the University of Michigan and earned a bachelor's degree in English Literature. While an undergraduate, he acted in and directed over thirty productions. McKee's creative writing professor was the noted Kenneth Thorpe Rowe. After completing his Bachelor of Arts degree, McKee toured with the APA (Association of Producing Artists) Repertory Company, appearing on Broadway alongside Helen Hayes, Rosemary Harris and Will Geer. He then received the Professional Theater Fellowship and returned to Ann Arbor, Michigan to earn his Master's degree in Theater Arts. Upon graduating, McKee directed the Toledo Repertory Company, acted with the American Drama Festival, and became artistic director of the Aaron Deroy Theater. From there he traveled to London to accept the position of artist-in-residence at the National Theatre where he studied Shakespearean production at the Old Vic theatre. He then returned to New York City and spent the next seven years as an actor/director in Broadway.  Mid-life in the film industry  After deciding to move his career to film, McKee attended Cinema School at the University of Michigan. While there, he directed two short films: A Day Off, which he also wrote, and Talk To Me Like The Rain, adapted from a one-act play by Tennessee Williams. These two films won the Cine Eagle Award, awards at the Brussels and Grenoble Film Festivals, and various prizes at the Delta, Rochester, Chicago and Baltimore Film Festivals. In 1979, McKee moved to Los Angeles, where he began to write screenplays and work as a story analyst for United Artists and NBC. He sold his first screenplay Dead Files to AVCO/Embassy Films, after which he joined the WGA (Writers Guild of America). His next screenplay, Hard Knocks, won the National Screenwriting Contest, and since then McKee has had eight feature film screenplays purchased or optioned, including the feature film script Trophy for Warner Bros. (Only one of these films, however, was produced). In addition to his screenplays, McKee has had a number of scripts produced for television series such as Quincy, M.E. (starring Jack Klugman), Mrs. Columbo (starring Kate Mulgrew), Spenser: for Hire and Kojak (starring Telly Savalas). McKee was also an early instructor at the pioneering Los Angeles film school the Sherwood Oaks Experimental College.  Starting the STORY seminar  In 1983, as Fulbright Scholar, McKee joined the faculty of the School of Cinema- Television at the University of Southern California (USC), where he began offering his famous STORY Seminar class. A year later, McKee opened the course to the public, giving a 3-day, 30-hour intensive class to sold-out audiences around the world. Since 1984, more than 50,000 students have taken McKee's course, at various cities around the world: Los Angeles, New York, London, Paris, Sydney, Toronto, Boston, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Tel Aviv, Auckland, Singapore, Barcelona, Stockholm, S√£o Paulo and more. In March 2011 and again in 2012, he taught a four-day seminar in Bogot√°, Colombia. In February 2012 he taught another four-day seminar in the Ramoji film city of Hyderabad in India. He did the same in Amsterdam, March 2014. McKee's current lecture series includes the 3-day \\"Story Seminar\\", 1-day \\"Genre Seminars\\" (teaching the conventions of love Story, thriller, comedy, horror, action and writing for television) and the 1-day ‚ÄúStorynomics Seminar‚Äù, teaching the application of storytelling principles in the business and marketing world (co-lectured with CEO of Skyword Tom Gerace). McKee continues to be a project consultant to major film and television production companies, corporations and governments around the world, as well major software firms such as Microsoft. In addition, several companies such as ABC, Disney, Miramax, PBS, Nickelodeon and Paramount regularly send their creative and writing staffs to his lectures.  Life and awards  Robert McKee is among the most widely known screenwriting lecturers. McKee's former students include over 65 Academy Award winners, 200 Emmy Award winners, 100 WGA (Writers Guild of America) Award winners and 50 DGA (Directors Guild of America) Award winners (all participated in McKee's course before or after winning their award; not all were awarded for writing), the British Book of the Year Award and the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. Some recent notable former students to win or be nominated for Oscars include Akiva Goldsman for his screenplay \\"A Beautiful Mind,\\" Peter Jackson (writer/director of \\"Lord of the Rings I, II and III‚Äù), Andrew Stanton (‚ÄúWall-E,‚Äù ‚ÄúFinding Nemo‚Äù) and Paul Haggis (‚ÄúMillion Dollar Baby,‚Äù ‚ÄúQuantum of Solace‚Äù). He was profiled by Bob Simon of 60 Minutes for CBS News, and by CNN who also reviewed the Story Seminar. Notable writers and actors such as Geoffrey Rush, Paul Haggis, Akiva Goldsman, William Goldman, Joan Rivers, David Bowie, Kirk Douglas, John Cleese, Tony Kaye, Steven Pressfield, among many others have taken his seminar. In 1990, Robert McKee was brought to New Zealand by the NZ Film Commission, and delivered a three-day seminar on screenplay and story structure in Auckland and Wellington. In the audience were Jane Campion and Peter Jackson, the latter of which went on to write and direct Heavenly Creatures, The Lord of the Rings, and King Kong. In 2000, McKee won the 1999 International Moving Image Book Award for his book Story (Regan Books/HarperCollins). The book, currently in its 19th printing in the United States and its 14th printing in the United Kingdom, has become required reading for film and cinema schools at Harvard, Yale, UCLA, USC and Tulane universities.[2][3] The book was on the Los Angeles Times best-seller list for 20 weeks. It is translated into over 20 languages. In 2017 McKee was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Final Draft Awards, an honor that recognizes professionals who have had a \\"profound influence on the industry\\" joining peers such as Lawrence Kasdan and Steven Zaillian. McKee's other credits include writing and presenting the BBC series Filmworks, the Channel Four series Reel Secrets, the BAFTA Award-winning J'accuse Citizen Kane television program which he wrote and presented, and the writing of Abraham, the four- hour mini-series on Turner Network Television (TNT) that starred Richard Harris, Barbara Hershey and Maximilian Schell. Books * Story: Substance, Structure, Style and the Principles of Screenwriting (1997) * Dialogue: the Art of Verbal Action for Stage, Page and Screen (2016) * Storynomics: Story- Driven Marketing in the Post-Advertising World (2018) Criticism McKee has been criticized by writer Joe Eszterhas, for teaching screenwriting without ever having a script of his made into a film.'Basic Instinct' ‚Äî New York Times article by Joe Queenan, September 17, 2006 (However, McKee is credited as writer of the 1994 TV movie Abraham.) McKee has responded to such criticisms, saying, \\"The world is full of people who teach things they themselves cannot do\\", while admitting that even though he sold all of his written screenplays, he still lacks their screen credit since they were only optioned and not ever produced by the studios.Michigan Today ‚Äì June 1995 ‚Äî interview with Brett Forrest Many of the ideas he discusses have been around since Aristotle and notably appear in the work of William Archer, John Howard Lawson and Alexander Mackendrick. Nevertheless, McKee himself tells his students that Aristotle is the basis for much of what he teaches, credits much of his writing on conflict and drama to the teaching of Kenneth Thorpe Rowe, and he often distributes some of John Howard Lawson's writings at his seminar: he acknowledges his forebears and never claims that he is inventing a brand new approach to storytelling. Furthermore, he claims that much of what he teaches was common knowledge 50 or 60 years ago, but that screenwriters have lost touch with the fundamentals of storytelling. In a CBC interview he said that to give his lecture in the 1930s, '40s or '50s \\"would have been ludicrous\\". McKee also appears and is criticized in several works, for example, Missionnaire by French author Joann Sfar. In popular culture In the Charlie Kaufman-penned film Adaptation., McKee's character was portrayed by the Emmy Award-winning actor Brian Cox. In the Oscar-winning movie, the desperate screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (played by Nicolas Cage) reluctantly goes to McKee's course, but then ‚Äì after being \\"shaken\\" by McKee's tough-style response to his claim that \\"nothing happens in the real world\\" ‚Äì Kaufman asks McKee to meet in person to discuss his failure to write the film adaptation he is working on. Though the story depicts McKee as little more than an amalgam of hack clich√©s on the subject of screen writing, Charlie's slacker brother Donald (also played by Cage) uses the knowledge obtained attending the famous seminar to write a spec script he then sells for a large amount of money through his brother's agent. The film then concludes with the very ending which McKee had ridiculed (Deus ex machina), as well as a voice-over epilogue in which ‚Äî by means of voice-over narration ‚Äî Cage's Kaufman character admonishes himself for disobeying a cardinal rule of McKee's to avoid voice-over narration. McKee appeared on the Simpsons episode \\"Caper Chase\\" as himself.http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/yale-harvard-war-bogs-down-overstuffed- simpsons-253107  Anecdotes  * McKee claims in his seminars that he does not say not to use voice-over narration. There is some truth to the scene in Adaptation however, as he vehemently teaches that using voice-over to substitute for telling the story via action and dialogue is weak, whereas he teaches that voice-over used to counterpoint and enrich the story can be wonderful. * McKee is known to object to the French-originated \\"auteur theory\\", which states that the director is the de facto author of a movie. McKee states otherwise, that the writer/screenwriter is in fact the most important creator of the movie. * In a Haaretz article, McKee was quoted as saying in front of a Tel Aviv audience that Israelis have a rough sense of humor, completely different from the known worldwide Jewish one, since Israelis are living in a harsh reality which leads them to lose their sense of humor.

She is noted for her starring roles in then controversial stage plays and films produced during Germany's Weimar Republic and the early years of the Third Reich. After the post-war partition of Germany, Thiele became a television star in East Germany. She is best remembered for her portrayal of Manuela in the lesbian- themed film M√§dchen in Uniform (1931). Career in Weimar and Nazi Germany One of her early drama teachers told Thiele \\"Either you'll have a great stage career or nothing at all. You have a Botticelli face but one which suggests depravity\\". Thiele began her professional acting career in 1928 as a stage actress in Leipzig. In 1931, she was given the lead role in Gestern und heute, the film adaptation of a play she had done there, but now called M√§dchen in Uniform, a tale set in a Prussian boarding school for girls. The film had an all-female cast, and Thiele played Manuela, a 14-year-old schoolgirl deeply infatuated with her teacher Fr√§ulein von Bernburg, played by Dorothea Wieck. M√§dchen in Uniform was distributed internationally and briefly made Thiele a star. She received thousands of fan letters, mostly from women. In 1932, she starred with Ernst Busch in Bertolt Brecht's Kuhle Wampe. In 1933, Thiele had a leading role in Kleiner Mann, was nun? and reunited with Dorothea Wieck in Anna and Elizabeth, another lesbian-themed film that was banned by the Nazis soon after it opened and which she later said was the most important work of her career. She also continued to work in theatre during the early 1930s, including productions with Max Reinhardt (Harmonie, 1932) and Veit Harlan (Veronika, 1935). Her career was thwarted when the Nazi government approached her with repeated requests to assist in the production of National Socialist propaganda. During one meeting with propaganda minister Dr. Joseph Goebbels, who advised Thiele to \\"familiarise\\" herself with National Socialism, she replied \\"I don't blow with the wind each time it changes directions\\". Although she made efforts to reach a workable understanding with Goebbels, the Nazis had come to view her work as mostly subversive, and she was excluded from the Reichstheater and Reichsfilmkammer. In 1937, she left Germany for Switzerland. It was another five years before she was able to find acting work in Bern. Later fame in East Germany Hertha Thiele returned to East Germany after the war but was unsuccessful in her efforts to begin a theatre. She returned to Switzerland and worked as a psychiatric nursing assistant during most of the 1950s and 1960s. In 1966, Thiele again returned to the GDR, working in stage productions in Magdeburg and Leipzig. During the 1970s, she was often seen on East German television acting in sundry series and television films which were virtually unknown in West Germany, including the popular Polizeiruf 110. In 1975, Thiele's work was featured in the television documentary Das Herz auf der linken Seite and in 1983 a monograph on her life and work was published by Deutsche Kinemathek. Thiele reportedly married more than once. One of her husbands was actor Heinz Klingenberg. Toward the end of her life, Western feminists researching the history of M√§dchen in Uniform sought her out, and she enjoyed a small measure of renewed cult celebrity before she died in 1984. In 1998 German film historians Heide Schl√ºpmann and Karola Gramman noted \\"her acting success may well have been based upon her image which met the homo-erotic desires of both men and women, though perhaps more those of women\\", and that Hertha Thiele \\"told us she would have liked to have played a 'proper love scene' with a man, once in her life: her image, moulded by men, didn't allow her the expression of this desire\\".

Around 1260 he came to the religious foundation of St. Gangolf in the Bamberg suburb of Theuerstadt, where surviving documents mention him as a teacher .Emmerson,R.Key Figures in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia-Pg 336 He later became Rector, which he remained until 1300 or so. He was noted in his own day, and is now remembered for his didactic writing, much of which was primarily aimed at his own students.  Works  Hugo composed, by his own account, five works in Latin and seven in German, of which there survive only three and one respectively (a second German work, now lost, was entitled Der Sammler (The Collector): * Registrum multorum auctorum: a Latin verse summary of 100 school Latin authors, with summaries of their lives and works * Laurea sanctorum: a Latin poem on the saints of the calendar and their feast days * Solsequium: also in Latin, this work was intended not for schoolboys but for preachers, and consists of 166 \\"exempla\\", or anecdotes, intended to be used as illustrations in sermons * Der Renner: the epic poem Der Renner (\\"The Runner\\" or \\"The Courier\\", so called because the author intended that it should run the length and breadth of Germany), comprising 24,600 verses, is the most comprehensive didactic poem in the German language. It has been transmitted in several manuscripts and many revisions, most of them by Hugo himself: although the poem first appeared in c1300, he continued to work on it until his death. The allegorical framework holding the encyclopaedic content together is based on the Seven Deadly Sins and contains much social comment, most of it critical of the burgher, noble and clerical estates.

Clinical ecologists are people that support and promote this offshoot of conventional medicine. They often have a background in the field of allergy or otorhinolaryngology, and the theoretical approach is derived in part from classic concepts of allergic responses, first articulated by Theron Randolph. Clinical ecologists support a cause-and-effect relationships for non-specific symptoms reported by some people after low-dose exposure to chemical, biologic, or physical agents. This pattern of low-dose reaction is not generally accepted by toxicologists. Although some of the mainstream medical community continue to reject these claims, the concept is gaining some recognition under the modern and more clearly articulated classification of environmental medicine.Biological Factors that Underlie Individual Susceptibility to Environmental Stressors and Their Implications for Decision-Making. The National Academies. Washington D.C. April 18‚Äì19, 2012. http://nas- sites.org/emergingscience/meetings/individual-variability/ Training and qualifications \\"Clinical Ecologist\\" is an environmental approach that is consistent with the practice of holistic medicine. Practitioners with this orientation do not use the term \\"Clinical Ecologist,\\" although those opposed to this complementary medicine approach to illness often still do. Unlike terms such as physician or nurse, the term clinical ecologist is not legally regulated in any jurisdiction, which means that any person may legally claim to be a clinical ecologist. If wanted, they may obtain an extralegal certification or membership from the unregulated private organization American Academy of Environmental Medicine upon payment of a fee.Federal Judicial Center, Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence, second edition , pages 30, 416-17, 432 (2000).Membership requirements of the American Academy of Environmental Medicine. Accessed 27 October 2009. Many clinical ecologists are traditionally licensed healthcare professionals who hold advanced traditional medical certifications. Others may have a more alternative training. History Randolph published a number of books to promote clinical ecology and environmental medicine, including:  In 1965, Randolph founded the Society for Clinical Ecology as an organization to promote his theories based on the symptoms of his patients, known as multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS). During the 1980s the movement was rejected by some medical organizations and judges, and health insurance companies often refused to pay their bills. The society's name was changed from the Society for Clinical Ecology, according to its opponents, in order to flee from its bad reputation. Despite the confusion in the traditional medical establishment regarding the classification and treatment of MCS, MCS has achieved credibility in workers compensation claims, tort liability, and regulatory actions. The pragmatic determination of MCS includes four elements: (1) the syndrome is acquired after a documentable environmental exposure that may have caused objective evidence of health effects; (2) the symptoms are referable to multiple organ systems and vary predictably in response to environmental stimuli; (3) the symptoms occur in relation to measurable levels of chemicals, but the levels are below those known to harm health; and (4) no objective evidence of organ damage can be found.Cullen MR. The worker with multiple chemical sensitivities: an overview. Occup Med. 1987;2:655‚Äì61. Controversy Randolph's theories about chemical effects have been criticized by toxicologists. His broader interpretation of \\"allergies\\" beyond that of IgE antibodies in true allergy conflicted with traditional allergists of his time. Of course, Randolph did not claim that environmental sensitivities were \\"true allergies\\" mediated by IgE, claiming this fine point was irrelevant to people suffering from non-allergic sensitivities. The turf war waged by allergists and defense expert witnesses during those years also has less relevance today than it once did. Several National Academy of Sciences workshops and Research Councils into Gulf War syndrome have validated the idiosyncratic effect low chemical exposure on sensitized individuals. Clinical ecology is not a recognized medical specialty.ACOEM position statement. Multiple chemical sensitivities: idiopathic environmental intolerance. College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. J Occup Environ Med. 1999 Nov;41(11):940-2. Practitioners have been criticized for tricking mentally ill and suggestible patients into thinking that they were chemically sensitive. Twentieth century critics of clinical ecology charged that multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) had never been clearly defined, no scientifically plausible mechanism has been proposed for it, no diagnostic tests have been substantiated, and not a single case has been scientifically proven. Well-conducted studies establishing the theories and practices of clinical ecology were not found in reviews of evidence supporting its practices by the American Medical Association in 1992,AMA Council on Scientific Affairs.

American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, April 26, 1999 The development of GMO food and the increased use of herbicides on food crops has resulted in an increased interest in the area of environmental sensitivities. A polarized debate has grown between supporters of the new agri-technology who characterize themselves as rational scientists and opponents as ignorant alarmists. On the other hand, the opponents characterize the supporters as dogmatic industry shills and themselves as critical thinkers and environmentalists. Both groups claim to be the majority opinion, although the only consensus that has weight is within the government organizations that rule on safety. At issue is the non-industry science that characterizes herbicides and the genetically engineered pesticides of GMO crops as endocrine disruptors. That disruption also triggers autoimmune system responses consistent with those observed by clinical ecologists.

It was also produced in Brazil from 1960 to 1971. US production The father of the Aero was Clyde Paton, former engineer for Packard Motor Car Company. The Eagle and Lark models were built from 1952 to 1954. A Wing model was available only in 1952, a Falcon model in 1953, and a taxicab in very limited production in 1953 and 1954. The Ace was the only model built through all U. S. production. 1955 saw two new models, the two- and four-door Ace sedans (renamed Custom shortly into the production run) and two-door hardtop Bermuda. Production in the U.S.A. ended that year as Henry J. Kaiser decided to give up the Kaiser and Willys Aero lines and concentrate solely on Jeeps. A total of 91,377 Aeros were built in Toledo. Toledo-built models were available with four engine options: the F4-134 Hurricane, the L6-161 Lightning, the F6-161 Hurricane; and, after the Kaiser firm purchased the Willys firm, the L6-226 Super Hurricane from the Kaiser car line. The four-cylinder was used only in Aero Lark and was only exported. For 1952, the model names Eagle, Wing and Ace were used for cars that had the six-cylinder F-head Hurricane engine and the Aero- Lark had the six-cylinder flathead Lightning engine. All 1952's had a two- piece split windshield. Eagles and Aces had a three-piece wraparound rear window, while the Larks and Wings had a smaller one-piece rear window. Owners of the 1952 model tended to buy the cars for their good fuel economy. They tended to find acceleration to be 'very good', unsurprising given the cars had the best power-to-weight ratio among US production cars. The primary complaint from two-door owners was the difficulty of access to the rear seat. Many felt the cars cost too much, even if they were a bargain on performance for cost grounds. Floyd Clymer noted the car was quite capable of comfortably cruising at highway speeds of 80‚Äì90 miles per hour. This continued for 1953 except the Wing was dropped and replaced by the Aero-Falcon, which had the six-cylinder Lightning engine. All 1953s were available as two-door or four-door sedans except the Eagle, which was a two-door hardtop. One-piece windshields were given to the Aces and the Eagles, but the Lark and Falcon retained the split windshield. Rear windows remained the same. Export Larks were available with the four-cylinder F-head engine. Dual-range Hydramatic transmissions were bought from GM and were optional in Aces and Eagles beginning in August 1953. 1954 was the most involved year when it came to models: Only the Lark, Ace and Eagle survived. There were some of each model that were re-serialed 1953s with 1954 trim hung on them and then there was the regular run in which some of the Aces and Eagles received the Kaiser Super-Hurricane engine. On the regular run, all Aeros received wraparound one piece windshields and rear windows and a new instrument panel, even the Lark. All 1954s received larger taillights, \\"hooded\\" headlight and parking light bezels, and different bumper guards. Nameplates were shuffled slightly on the regular run cars. After 1955, the model was discontinued, though the tooling was kept in case it could be used overseas. This eventuated when production restarted in Brazil in 1960. The Brazilian government of the time had been interested in encouraging a domestic auto industry. A 1979 newspaper article in the Toledo Blade commented on an Aero-Lark DeLuxe on a 3,500 mile tour of America, noting that it would make \\"a perfect 1979 model, with 108-inch wheelbase, all-welded unit body, and 28 mpg combination city and highway. And it meets present federal pollution standards without modification.\\" With their engine bays sized to fit the Continental straight six, the Aeros have plenty of room for small-block V8 swaps.

It is dark with yellow-green olivine phenocrysts (20-50%) and black to dark brown pyroxene, mostly augite. The olivine-rich picrite basalts that occur with the more common tholeiitic basalts of Kƒ´lauea and other volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands are the result of accumulation of olivine crystals either in a portion of the magma chamber or in a caldera lava lake. The compositions of these rocks are well represented by mixes of olivine and more typical tholeiitic basalt. The name \\"picrite\\" can also be applied to an olivine-rich alkali basalt: such picrite consists largely of phenocrysts of olivine and titanium-rich augite pyroxene with minor plagioclase set in a groundmass of augite and more sodic plagioclase and perhaps analcite and biotite. Picrites and komatiites are somewhat similar chemically, but differ in that komatiite lavas are products of more magnesium-rich melts, and good examples exhibit the spinifex texture. In contrast, picrites are magnesium- rich because crystals of olivine have accumulated in more normal melts by magmatic processes. Komatiites are largely restricted to the Archean. When the term oceanite was apparently first proposed by Antoine Lacroix, he used the term to apply only to basalts with more than 50% olivine content (an extremely rare occurrence). Picrite basalt is found in the lavas of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa in Hawaii, Cura√ßao, in the Piton de la Fournaise volcano on R√©union Island and various other oceanic island volcanoes. *Picrite basalt has erupted in historical times from Mauna Loa during the eruptions of 1852 and 1868 (from different flanks of Mauna Loa). *Picrite basalt with 30% olivine commonly erupts from the Piton de la Fournaise. Oceanite Oceanite is the name of variety of picritic basalt characterized by its large amounts of olivine phenocrysts and lesser amounts of augite and by having a groundmass of olivine, plagioclase and augite. The term was coined by Antoine Lacroix in 1923. Common uses Olivine basalt is commonly used by foundries, boilermakers and boiler users to protect the area around a burner tip or to protect a floor from molten metal and other slag. Its use in this fashion is appropriate since olivine is a highly refractory, high-melting-temperature mineral.

In a wider sense, any ship intended to gather information could be considered a spy ship. Spy ships are usually controlled by a nation's government, due to the high costs and advanced equipment required. They tend to be parts of the nation's navy, though they may also be operated by secret services. Naval trawlers masquerade as civilian ships such as fishing trawlers, which could be reasonably expected to remain in a certain area for a long time. Ships which are used to infiltrate spies or special forces are sometimes also called \\"spy ships\\". History An early version of what would become known as a spy ship is the United States civilian cargo ship , which made frequent voyages to Japan, China, and the Philippines with cargo and passengers during the 1920s and 1930s. Starting in 1933 as a station ship she was assigned to monitor internal Japanese Fleet frequencies and direction finder azimuths. She had three intercept operators and one chief radioman supervised by an officer. Gold Star and ground stations provided significant intelligence before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. DOCID: 3362395 - Approved for Release by NSA. on 06-16-2008, FOIA Case #51505 - UNCLASSIFIED See pages 31 & 32. Spy ships in the modern sense of being specially built and entirely dedicated to intelligence tasks came into being during the early Cold War, and they are in use by all major powers. Their uses, in addition to listening in on communications and spy on enemy fleet movements, were to monitor nuclear tests and missile launches (especially of potential ICBMs). One of the most important functions for both Cold War spy ship fleets, especially in the 1960s, was the gathering of submarine \\"signatures\\"the patterns of noise that could often identify the specific type of submarine and were thus valuable in anti-submarine warfare. During that era, the United States fielded about 80 vessels, usually classified as \\"environmental research\\" craft, while the Soviet Union had around 60 ships, often converted trawlers or hydrographic research ships. In the late 1980s, the Soviet fisheries fleet was known for having equipped many of their thousands of ships with sophisticated SIGINT and ELINT equipment, thus functioning as auxiliary spy ships tracking western naval vessels and electronic communications (though their main function remained commercial fishing). Operation USNS Vanguard was not strictly a spy ship, being used for space tracking, there is some overlap between her capabilities and those of a spy ship. A spy ship usually stays in international waters (or at least outside territorial waters), so as to not violate territorial borders. From there, it will use its electronic equipment to monitor sea and air traffic, radio and radar frequencies and also try to intercept and decrypt coded radio or phone communications. This is mostly done via passive means such as radio receivers or passive sonar. Sometimes however, active measures such as radar or sonar may also be used to detect the movement of aircraft, missiles, ships or other vehicles or troops. However, this risks revealing the ship's purpose. As it is located much closer to the surveilled area than a fixed installation (given a close by shoreline), the monitoring is usually much more efficient and in some respects better than even that of spy satellites. Tracking vessels also have some of the capabilities of spy ships, and as they are controlled by their national governments, they are also intermittently used for similar purposes, such as tracking enemy missile tests. Soviet AGI trawlers As the United States Navy began deploying ballistic missile submarines in 1960, the Soviet Union attempted to obtain more information about the capabilities of the UGM-27 Polaris missile and the locations of the submarines capable of launching them. While the Soviet Navy requested more sophisticated ships, they were allocated trawlers (called tral‚Äôshchiki) from the fishing fleet equipped with more sophisticated sensors and communication equipment. Very capable crews were assigned to these trawlers of unremarkable appearance. They were assigned to patrol stations off United States naval bases to photograph and report arrival and departure of United States warships and auxiliaries. Other trawlers of similar appearance would patrol weapons firing ranges used by the United States Navy to observe practice firings of modern weapons and record the acoustic and/or electromagnetic signature of the sonar, search radar, fire-control radar, guidance, and/or command electronics of each weapons system. The United States Navy officially designated these trawlers as Auxiliary, General Intelligence or AGI, and they were informally known as \\"tattletales\\". An AGI might be assigned to a single patrol station for as long as six months. These ships were not fast enough to keep up with most warships, but they sometimes congregated around aircraft carriers conducting air operations of the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean or United States Seventh Fleet in the western Pacific Ocean, or in suspected patrol areas of ballistic missile submarines. After the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Joint Chiefs of Staff authorized a counter AGI program for United States destroyers to come alongside the AGIs to push against them, foul their screws with steel nets, and focus high power electromagnetic transmitters to burn out the amplifying circuitry of their electronic sensors. The AGI crews then revealed their ship-handling skills using superior maneuverability to evade the destroyers' intentions. This jousting in international waters continued until signing of the U.S.‚ÄìSoviet Incidents at Sea agreement in 1972.

The long- eared hedgehog lives in burrows that it either makes or finds and is distinguished by its long ears. It is considered one of the smallest Middle Eastern hedgehogs.Qumsiyeh, M. B.. (1996) Mammals of the Holy Land. Texas Tech University Press, Lubbock Texas. pp. 64‚Äì66 . This hedgehog is insectivorous but may also feed on small vertebrates and plants. In captivity they can live for over 7 years. Since the long-eared hedgehog is naturally parasite prone and can carry diseases as bad as plague, it is highly recommended that, if kept as a pet, it should be purchased from a respected dealer. Wild hedgehogs have been found to carry Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the brown dog tick, which can transmit Boutonneuse fever. Description Long-eared hedgehogs in Leningrad Zoo Pet hedgehogs eating The length of the head and body of the long-eared hedgehog is approximately 120‚Äì270 mm, and the tail is 10‚Äì50 mm long.Ballenger, L. (1999). \\"Hemiechinus auritus\\", Animal Diversity Web. Accessed November 28, 2011 The skull is about 38‚Äì48 mm long. Unlike other species the pterygoids of the skull do not inflate and they do not relay information to the tympanic membrane. The ears of this hedgehog are 30‚Äì45 mm longer than the closest spine. They are used for heat radiation in the desert. Long-eared hedgehogs have great senses of hearing and smell that they use to hunt out food and detect predators. The long-eared hedgehog's spines are embedded in a unique muscle sheath that forms a bag-like structure which acts as protection for the hedgehog. They can withdraw into this pouch and erect their spines out to fend off predators if need be. The dorsal spines are white on the tip with darker banding below. They do not have dark and light areas on their faces. Also they do not have a gap of spines on the back of their necks that is common to other species of hedgehogs. The long-eared hedgehog has a light-colored underside along with whitish hairs on the tips of their ears. The tops and heels of their feet are covered with hair but the soles are bare.Colak, E., Yigit, N., Sozen, M. & Ozkurt, S. (1998). A study on the long- eared hedgehog, Hemiechinus auritus (Gmelin, 1770) (Mammalia: Insectivora) in Turkey . Tr. J. of Zoology. 22, 131‚Äì136. The long-eared hedgehog is smaller than the West European hedgehog; it weighs between 250‚Äì400 grams, and is much faster. It is less likely to curl up in a ball when approached by predators and will rather try and outrun or leap at predators with their relatively short needles. Diet The long-eared hedgehog is an insectivore;70% of its diet consists of insects, with some worms and a tiny amount of slugs and snails. The idea that these animals eat only slugs and snails is a myth; this type of food makes up only about 5% of their natural diet. The breakdown of a wild hedgehog's diet is as follows: 30% beetles, 25% caterpillars, 11% earthworms, 10% bird eggs, 5% mammal meat, 5% slugs and snails, 3% millipedes, 3% earwigs, 2% bees, 1% bird meat and 5% that has been undefined by researchers. This diet breakdown is not specific to Hemiechinus auritus but a generalization about most hedgehog species.Feeding Hedgehogs and the Hedgehog Diet . thehedgehog.co.uk More specific to this species, Hemiechinus auritus is an insectivore that forages in the early evening looking for insects, myriapods, gastropods, batrachians (amphibians), small vertebrates and plants. It may even eat snakes or other vertebrates by curling up to protect its underside as it eats the struggling prey. They prefer to live near a water source. However, if this is not available they depend on their food source for their water intake The long-eared hedgehog is active throughout much of the year and hibernates for shorter periods of time. The longest reported hibernation is 40 days. This hibernation may come in the summer or the winter. Also this hedgehog will travel up to 9 km during the night in search of food. Predators The long-eared hedgehog is hunted by the Eurasian eagle owl and makes up about 14% of the predatory birds' diet. It has been reported as prey for the Pharaoh eagle owl in the Azraq Nature Reserve in Jordan. The Long- eared hedgehog is a host of the Acanthocephalan intestinal parasite Moniliformis cryptosaudi. Distribution and habitat Hemiechinus auritus has a range that extends from the eastern Mediterranean region, through the arid and steppe areas of Asia to western Pakistan in the south; and from eastern Ukraine through Mongolia (Gobi desert), to China (Xinjiang). This species is native to the following countries: Afghanistan, China, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Libya, Mongolia, Pakistan, Russia, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The long-eared hedgehog prefers to stay in intermediate climates, avoiding the hot desert and the northern colder mountain areas. They also prefer areas with moderate rainfall of 100‚Äì400 mm. The long-eared hedgehog inhabits a few different types of dry steppes, semi-deserts, and deserts. It prefers dry river valleys, gullies, forest shelter belts, abandoned irrigation ditches and shrubby areas, and often settles in oases and around human settlements (sometimes in cultivated habitats). They live in burrows that they dig under bushed with a length of 45 cm long with only one opening. They may also inhabit abandoned burrows of other small mammals. They are nocturnal solitary hedgehogs. During the day they are found resting under rocks, hollows or rock piles. Reproduction The long-eared hedgehog only breeds once a year in the summer months of July through September. The presence of spines does not inhibit this species ability to reproduce. Long-eared hedgehogs gestation period is 35‚Äì42 days. The female has 8‚Äì10 nipples and often has 2‚Äì3 babies. After just one week the babies start eating solid food. They are born with very few spines and within five hours after birth the spines have doubled in size. After two weeks the babies are fully covered with their new spines. Impact Long eared hedgehogs can be agriculturally beneficial since they eat harmful organisms like termites and scorpions. They are not found to damage crops since they live in areas that are mostly waste land and desert.

It can be viewed as the medical branch of the broader field of environmental health. The scope of this field involves studying the interactions between environment and human health, and the role of the environment in causing or mediating disease. This specialist field of study developed after the realisation that health is more widely and dramatically affected by environmental factors than previously recognized. Environmental factors in the causation of environmental diseases can be classified into: *Physical *Chemical *Biological *Social (including Psychological and Culture variables) *Ergonomic *Safety *Any combination of the above In the United States, the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (OCOEM) oversees board certification of physicians in environmental (and occupational) medicine. This board certification isn't recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties.  Current focuses of environmental medicine  While environmental medicine is a broad field, some of the currently prominent issues include: *The effects of ozone depletion and the resulting increase in UV radiation on humans with regards to skin cancer. *The effects of nuclear accidents or the effects of a terrorist dirty bomb attack and the resulting effects of radioactive material and radiation on humans. *The effects of chemicals on humans, such as dioxin, especially with regards to developmental effects and cancer. *Radon gas exposure in individuals' homes. *Air and water pollution on the health of individuals. *Mercury poisoning and exposure to humans though including fish and sea life in their diet. *Lead poisoning from leaded gasoline, paint, and plumbing. *Water-borne diseases *Food poisoning *Indoor air quality According to recent estimates about 5 to 10% of disease adjusted life years (DALY) lost are due to environmental causes. By far the most important factor is fine particulate matter pollution in urban air.EEA. National and regional story (Netherlands) - Environmental burden of disease in Europe: the EBoDE project.  Scope of environmental medicine  Environmental medicine is concerned primarily with prevention. Food-borne infections or infections that are water-borne (e.g. cholera and gastroenteritis caused by norovirus or campylobacteria) are typical concerns of environmental medicine, but some opinions in the fields of microbiology hold that the viruses, bacteria and fungi that they study are not within the scope of environmental medicine if the spread of infection is directly from human to human. Much of epidemiology, which studies patterns of disease and injury, is not within the scope of environmental medicine, but e.g. air pollution epidemiology is a highly active branch of environmental health and environmental medicine. Any disease with a large genetic component usually falls outside the scope of environmental medicine, but in diseases like asthma or allergies both environmental and genetic approaches are needed. Military \\"environmental medicine\\" The U.S. Army has, since at least 1961, used the term \\"environmental medicine\\" in a sense different from the above. Its U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, at Natick, Massachusetts, conducts basic and applied research to determine how exposure to extreme heat, severe cold, high terrestrial altitude, military occupational tasks, physical training, deployment operations, and nutritional factors affect the health and performance of military personnel. Research on the effect of environmental pollutants on military personnel is not part of USARIEM's mission, but is within the purview of the U.S. Army Center for Environmental Health Research at Fort Detrick, Maryland.

The Green, which has been described as \\"one of the most beautiful urban greens surviving anywhere in England\\", is essentially square in shape and its open grassland, framed with broadleaf trees, extends to roughly twelve acres. On the north-east side there is also a smaller open space called Little Green. Richmond Green and Little Green are overlooked by a mixture of period townhouses, historic buildings and municipal and commercial establishments including the Richmond Lending Library and Richmond Theatre. On summer weekends and public holidays the Green attracts many residents and visitors. It has a long history of hosting sporting events; from the 16th century onwards tournaments and archery contests have taken place on the Green, while cricket matches have occurred since the mid 18th century, continuing to the present day.

For over 400 years, Richmond Green has been edged by houses and commercial premises ‚Äì built to provide accommodation for people serving or visiting Richmond Palace. In 1625 Charles I brought his court here to escape the plague in London and by the early 18th century these had become the homes of \\"minor nobility, diplomats, and court hangers-on\\". The construction of the railway in the mid-19th century cut the Green off from Old Deer Park, and led to the building of Victorian villas for the more prosperous commuters to London. The A316 road, built in the early 20th century, worsened this separation. Today the northern, western and southern sides of the Green are residential while the eastern side, linking with Richmond's high street, George Street, is largely retail and commercial. Public buildings line the eastern side of Little Green and pubs and caf√©s cluster in the corner by Paved and Golden Courts ‚Äì two of a number of alleys that lead from the Green to George Street.

The late 19th-century drinking fountain at the south corner of Richmond Green and a pair of K6 red telephone boxes are Grade II listed, as is a lamp standard outside 1, Richmond Green. The houses on the south-western side of the Green include Maids of Honour Row. The houses, and their gates and railings, at numbers 1‚Äì4 Maids of Honour Row are Grade I listed. The Wardrobe and the Gate House, both Grade I listed, are surviving structures from Henry VII's Richmond Palace. The Gate House was built in 1501, and was let on a 65-year lease by the Crown Estate Commissioners in 1986. The Trumpeters' House, which is also Grade I listed, is an early 18th-century house built on the site of Richmond Palace's Middle Gate. The street bounding Richmond Green on the north-west is called Pembroke Villas, comprising 5 pairs of large semi- detached Victorian villas, formerly the site of the house of the Dutchman Sir Matthew Decker, 1st Baronet (1679‚Äì1749). It descended to his grandson Richard FitzWilliam, 7th Viscount FitzWilliam (1745‚Äì1816) of Mount Merrion, Dublin, Ireland, who named it \\"FitzWilliam House\\" and there formed his famous art collection and by his will founded the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. The monument to Sir Matthew Decker and Richard FitzWilliam survives against the external wall of St Mary Magdalene's Church, Richmond. FitzWilliam's heir was his cousin George Herbert, 11th Earl of Pembroke (1759‚Äì1827), of Wilton House in Wiltshire, who renamed the house \\"Pembroke House\\". It was demolished in 1840. Numbers 1 to 10, Pembroke Villas are Grade II listed. The street running along the north east of the Green, where it joins Pembroke Villas, is called Portland Terrace. Numbers 1 to 4, Portland Terrace are Grade II listed. Between Pembroke Villas and Portland Terrace is a gate that used to be the entrance to Old Deer Park and is now open only to pedestrians. Just a few yards beyond the gate, a footbridge crosses the railway to lead to Old Deer Park Car Park. Portland Terrace runs past Little Green to become Duke Street, where Duke Street Church is located. Cricket on the Green The Cricketers pub The Green was a popular venue for cricket matches during the 18th century and before. The earliest reference to cricket on Richmond Green is from a 1666 letter by Sir Robert Paston, a resident of Richmond. The Green is presently home to two village cricket teams each affiliated to two of Richmond's pubs, The Prince's Head and The Cricketers. Midweek matches are contested in the modern limited overs format of Twenty20 usually on a Tuesday or Thursdays, where surrounding village teams compete for the Len Smith Charity Shield. Richmond Green in art Two watercolours by Edward Walker, made in 1942, showing nos 10, 11 and 12 Richmond Green and the south side of the Green, are in the Recording Britain collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

Prosopis nigra (synonym Prosopis algarrobilla) is a South American leguminous tree species that inhabits the Gran Chaco ecoregion (in particular, the transition zone between the Wet Chaco and the Southern Chaco), in Argentina and Paraguay. It is known as algarrobo negro in Spanish, which means \\"black carob tree\\" (the Spanish settlers gave it that name, as they did with many other species of genus Prosopis, because of its similarity to the European carob tree). It is also variously called algarrobo dulce, algarrobo morado and algarrobo amarillo (\\"sweet\\", \\"purple\\" and \\"yellow\\" carob tree, respectively). The tree blossoms in September and October, and gives fruit from November to March. It grows together with the vinalillo tree (Prosopis vinalillo) and under the tops of the palm tree Copernicia alba. Like the other species of this genus, it tolerates arid climate, but can also survive in flooded ground for a long time. The heartwood is dark brown and very heavy, considered noble by local carpenters, also weather resistant, it presents streaks. Usage Algarrobo negro wood is used in making furniture and barrels. High in tannin, it has been employed for leather tanning since the colonial era. Its fruit, called an algarroba, is a dehiscent-type pod, with a sweet, starchy paste inside, milled to make flour, and fermented to make an alcoholic beverage.

He appears in A Dame to Kill For, The Big Fat Kill, Family Values, The Babe Wore Red and That Yellow Bastard. He is the character that appears the most in all the Sin City yarns. He was portrayed by Clive Owen in the 2005 film, and by Josh Brolin in the 2014 sequel. Appearance In Dwight's first appearance in A Dame to Kill For, his head is shaved and he is nearing middle age. During the events of A Dame to Kill For, the Old Town girls perform facial reconstruction on him at Gail's behest after he suffers horrendous injuries. They change his facial appearance dramatically, and he allows his hair to grow again as well. By his next appearances in The Big Fat Kill and Family Values, he sports a more natural look. In terms of clothing, in the first half of A Dame to Kill For he wears just a shirt and pants. Afterwards, he takes to wearing a black shirt and a trench coat. He wears red Converse sneakers both before and after his transformation; shown in color on the cover of The Big Fat Kill #1 and in the movie adaptation. Character history Three years before A Dame to Kill For, Dwight rescues Miho from two Tong gangsters. In the time span of That Yellow Bastard, Ava Lord leaves Dwight and marries another man. In That Yellow Bastard, it is on the night John Hartigan enters Kadie's that a drunk Dwight, after whining about Ava leaving him a month ago, goes home with Shellie and sleeps with her. Prior to his first chronological appearance in A Dame to Kill For, Dwight worked for a time as a talented photographer for a Basin City newspaper. However, he was prone to reckless and violent behavior, further aggravated by alcoholism, which cost him his job. After getting sober and curbing his aggressive tendencies, he found work as a seedy private investigator, often taking pictures of adulterous men. Dwight as he first appears in A Dame To Kill For. Dwight sporting a new face courtesy of the Old Town girls later on in A Dame To Kill For. =A Dame to Kill For= As the story begins, Dwight is struggling with maintaining a clean and safe lifestyle, as he is constantly enticed to revert to his previous, reckless ways. Ava Lord contacts Dwight and asks to meet at a seedy bar. Though it has been about four years since they last saw each other, Dwight is still embittered by her leaving him. Manute interrupts their meeting just as Ava mentions she might die soon. The next night, Dwight goes to Damien Lord's estate to check on her; however, Manute attacks and beats Dwight brutally. By the time Dwight makes it back to his apartment, Ava is there, where they sleep together after a nasty argument. Just as Manute shows up, Ava tells him she's being tortured by Manute and Damien. Dwight tries to fight him off, but gets thrown out of his apartment's window. On the street, Dwight sees Ava's frightened face as Manute's car drives past and Dwight finally snaps, reverting to his previously dangerous and violent behavior. Fearing for Ava's safety, he goes to Kadie's and recruits help from Marv, the neighborhood bruiser. Shellie lectures Dwight at having not seen nor heard from him in six months. Upon arriving at Damien's estate, Marv causes a commotion and distracts the security while Dwight looks for Damien. Marv fights Manute and takes out his right eye. Dwight kills Damien in a struggle, and learns that Ava tricked him into doing so; she shoots him in the face and he falls out yet another window. Marv hears the gunshots, picks up Dwight's body and leaves the estate. In their getaway car, Dwight, barely alive, tells Marv to take him to Old Town. When an old flame, Gail, hears Dwight's voice and sees what has happened to his face, she begins to rehabilitate Dwight. After he has healed, Gail, Dwight, Miho and Shellie develop a plan to get revenge on Ava Lord. Gail and the others tell Shellie that Dwight is still alive, and brief her on what she should tell the cops. Ava, having inherited her late husband's fortune, joins forces with mob boss Wallenquist. Dwight, Miho, and Gail get into Ava Lord‚Äôs estate. They encounter Manute, who, despite being shot six times by Dwight and crucified by Miho, manages to stay alive. Dwight, after listening to Ava's last, desperate lie, finally kills her. =The Big Fat Kill= Dwight in The Big Fat Kill. His face is now completely redone. Dwight, sporting an improved face, is at Shellie's place when Jack Rafferty (otherwise known as Jackie-Boy) and his friends arrive to harass Shellie. Dwight 'talks' with Jackie-Boy in the bathroom -- he threatens him with a razor and plunges his head into the toilet that Jackie-Boy has just urinated in -- and scares him off. They leave Shellie's apartment, but Dwight follows them for fear that they might hurt another woman that night. Dwight follows them straight to Old Town, where Miho slaughters Jackie-Boy and his friends for threatening one of the Old Town girls. Dwight then discovers that Jack was in fact a Detective Lieutenant whom the papers call \\"Iron Jack\\". Dwight, in an attempt to prevent a costly war between the Old Town girls and the police, tries to dispose of Jackie-Boy‚Äôs body in the tar pits. However, some Irish mercenaries that Wallenquist has sent shoot him. Dwight survives only because Jackie Boy's badge blocked a bullet. He kills the assassins, but is attacked by more of them. He lands in the tar pits while the others cut off Jackie Boy's head. Dwight sinks into the tar and prays to God not to let him die. Miraculously, he sees Miho swimming towards him. He pleas with her silently to save herself. However, Miho pulls him with her foot attached to a chain at the back of a car and she drags him just in time from the pits. Dallas, who was driving the car, announces that Gail has been kidnapped. Though the other mercenaries have left with Jackie-Boy's head, Miho has left one member of the gang alive, and Dwight tortures him for information. The Old Town girl that Jackie-Boy had his eyes on, Becky, sells them out to Wallenquist in an attempt to make money and get out of the prostitution game ‚Äî this is how the Irish assassins knew where to ambush Dwight. We learn that Manute has captured Gail, when suddenly Miho fires an arrow with a deal attached: Jackie-Boy's head for Gail's life. The trade takes place in a narrow alley, and Dwight takes advantage of this to ambush Manute and his entourage. The Old Town girls, firing from the rooftops, leave no one alive. =Family Values= Dwight is on a mission from Gail to dig up information about a recent mob hit at a small diner. He goes into a bar near where the hit happened and tries to charm one of the local drinkers there named Peggy. Dwight also spots Fat Man and Little Boy, which makes his job easier later on. As Dwight keeps charming Peggy, she realizes he's not interested in any company that night and only looking for information behind the recent hit. It's revealed that Bruno, the target, was killed by Vito, one of Don Magliozzi's nephews and also one of his hitmen. This was done in retaliation on Don Magliozzi's part as Bruno had killed his beloved niece years ago. Going against his family's treaty with Mob Boss Wallenquist, Magliozzi orders Vito to kill Bruno, who is on Wallenquist's payroll, immediately. Afterwards, everyone's nervous about what Wallenquist will do and if there will be a mob war. With that information, Dwight leaves the bar and is confronted by Vito and some other hitmen who came when Fat Man and Little Boy alerted them someone was digging around for information. Dwight is kidnapped by them and driven toward the Projects, but Dwight is more interested in their car, which he claims he will take possession of once they're all dead; none of them believe him. Unknown to the hitmen is that Miho has been following Dwight for protection. On the way, Vito tells his side of the story as to how he killed every living thing he saw, including a stray dog. Dwight is satisfied with this and orders Miho to make her appearance. She kills Spinelli, one of the goons, and they park in a hilltop rest area, overlooking the Projects. There, Miho toys with one of the hitmen as Dwight tells Vito to kill the other hitman, Vito's own brother Luca. After Miho and Dwight are through, they head straight to Sacred Oaks to confront Don Magliozzi, driven by Vito. Miho cuts through the guards and Dwight makes his appearance. He tells the Don he is going to die along with Vito for the accidental death of Carmen, one of the Old Town girls. Dwight tells them Vito shouldn't have shot at the stray dog, since the angles were in a straight line to where Carmen was calling for a ride when Vito shot her. Carmen's lesbian lover, Daisy, arrives as Dwight walks away from the Don and his associates. Daisy guns them down as Dwight remarks there's going to be a mob war because of this, but that neither he nor the girls of Old Town will have cause to worry about it. Finally, he takes possession of Vito's car and drives off into the night. =Hell and Back= On page 165 of Hell and Back, Dwight is clearly seen driving his car next to Wallace and Delia. Personality Dwight is first introduced as a man who lives in total abstinence in order to keep out of trouble. Having a history of bad tempers, wild drinking, and wild love affairs (as well as a mysterious, but seemingly significant, incident involving his father, briefly mentioned in A Dame to Kill For) he lives completely denying himself even a taste of what he refers to as \\"the fire\\". During this time he appears to be a tortured soul who is afraid even to rev the engine of his Mustang or grow his hair, all the while trying to not 'let the monster out.' After being duped and betrayed by Ava Lord in A Dame to Kill For, he develops a new, nihilistic outlook on life. After killing Damien Lord, he constantly refers to himself as a dead man, hinting that he no longer lives the life he had prior to Ava's reappearance. The new Dwight, possibly the 'monster' he had tried to restrain, is far more confident in his self-worth and more at ease with allowing himself to indulge in pleasures and whims. There are times when this new Dwight is shown as being insane or at least not all there, most likely a result of Ava's influence and betrayal, it is most notable during the conversation between himself and the recently deceased Jackie Boy. Dwight also appears completely aware of his problems. At all times Dwight is a model of chivalry, treating all women, especially the prostitutes of Old Town, with the utmost respect and offering them his protection. His passion for romance runs deep and a woman in need of help is the trigger for his involvement in all the stories in which he stars. Miller, on the special 2-Disc Sin City DVD has stated he is the story's \\"everyman\\": Rather than an anti-hero like Marv or a folk hero like John Hartigan, Dwight is simply someone who tries to do the right thing and find his place in the world. He also, in explaining the character to actor Clive Owen, described Dwight as a modern iteration of Philip Marlowe.

At his height, he reigned as king over Dublin, the Isles, and perhaps the Rhinns of Galloway. The precise identity of Echmarcach's father, Ragnall, is uncertain. One possibility is that this man was one of two eleventh-century rulers of Waterford. Another possibility is that Echmarcach's father was an early eleventh-century ruler of the Isles. If any of these identifications are correct, Echmarcach may have been a member of the U√≠ √çmair kindred. Echmarcach first appears on record in about 1031, when he was one of three kings in northern Britain who submitted to Kn√∫tr Sveinnsson, ruler of the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire. Echmarcach is recorded to have ruled over Dublin in 1036‚Äì1038 and 1046‚Äì1052. After losing Dublin for the final time, he appears to have been seated in the Isles on Mann. In 1061, about a decade after his final defeat in Dublin, Echmarcach appears to have been expelled from the Isles, and may have then fallen back into Galloway. Echmarcach appears to have forged an alliance with the powerful U√≠ Briain. A leading member of this kindred, Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster, was married to Cacht ingen Ragnaill, a woman who could have been closely related to Echmarcach. Certainly, Echmarcach's daughter, M√≥r, married one of Donnchad's U√≠ Briain close kinsmen. Echmarcach's violent career brought him into bitter conflict with a particular branch of the U√≠ √çmair who had held Dublin periodically from the early eleventh century. This branch was supported by the rising U√≠ Cheinnselaig, an Irish kindred responsible for Echmarcach's final expulsion from Dublin and apparently Mann as well. In about 1064, having witnessed much of his formerly expansive sea-kingdom fall into the hands of the U√≠ Cheinnselaig, Echmarcach accompanied Donnchad‚Äîa man who was himself deposed‚Äîupon a pilgrimage to Rome. Possibly aged about sixty-five at this point in his life, it was here that Echmarcach died, in either 1064 or 1065. In the decades following his demise, the U√≠ Briain used Echmarcach's descendants as a means to dominate and control Dublin and the Isles. One of his grandsons eventually ruled as king. Uncertain parentage Locations relating to Echmarcach and his contemporaries in Britain and Ireland. Echmarcach was the son of a man named Ragnall. Whilst Echmarcach bore a Gaelic name, the name of his father is ultimately derived from Old Norse, a fact that serves to exemplify the hybrid nature of the eleventh-century Irish Sea region,Clancy, TO (2011) pp. 374‚Äì375; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 128. The identity of Echmarcach's father is uncertain.Woolf (2007) p. 246. One possibility is that Ragnall was a member of the dynasty that ruled the Norse-Gaelic enclave of Waterford in tenth- and eleventh centuries. If so, Echmarcach may have been the son of one of two Waterfordian rulers: Ragnall mac √çmair, King of Waterford, or this man's apparent son, Ragnall ua √çmair, King of Waterford.Downham (2013b) p. 147; Woolf (2007) p. 246; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 228; Connon (2005); Hudson, BT (2005) p. 129; Etchingham (2001) pp. 158 n. 35, 181‚Äì182, 197; Oram (2000) p. 16; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 104; Duffy (1992) pp. 96, 97; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 355. Another possibility is that Echmarcach belonged to a family from the Isles, and that his father was Ragnall mac Gofraid, King of the Isles, son and possible successor of Gofraid mac Arailt, King of the Isles.Charles-Edwards (2013) pp. 528, 564, 564 n. 140, 573; Downham (2013b) p. 147; McGuigan (2015) p. 107; Clancy, TO (2008) p. 29; Downham (2007) p. 193 fig. 12; Woolf (2007) p. 246; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 129, 130 fig. 4; Etchingham (2001) pp. 158 n. 35, 181‚Äì182; Williams, DGE (1997) pp. 104, 145; Hudson, BT (1992) pp. 355‚Äì356. As a descendant of either of the aforesaid families, Echmarcach would appear to have been a member of the U√≠ √çmair, a royal dynasty descended from the Scandinavian sea-king √çmar.Woolf (2001). Echmarcach and the imperium of Kn√∫tr Sveinnsson =Kn√∫tr and the three kings= Echmarcach's name as it appears on folio 67r of British Library Cotton Domitian A VIII (the \\"F\\" version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle): \\"Iehmarc\\".Baker (2000) p. 114; Cotton MS Domitian A VIII (n.d.). Echmarcach appears to first emerge in the historical record in the first half of the eleventh century, when he was one of the three kings who met with Kn√∫tr Sveinnsson,Hudson, BT (2005) p. 132. ruler of the Anglo-Scandinavian Empire comprising the kingdoms of Denmark, England, and Norway.Bolton (2009) p. 307. The event itself is noted by Kn√∫tsdr√°pa, a contemporary dr√°pa composed by Sigvatr √û√≥r√∞arson, an eleventh-century Icelandic skald. Although Sigvatr's composition fails to identify the three kings by name, it does reveal that Kn√∫tr met them in Fife.Lawson (2013); Walker, IW (2013) ch. 5; Hollander (2011) p. 401 ch. 131; Bolton (2009) p. 149; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 132; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 350, 350 n. 1; Anderson (1922a) pp. 546‚Äì547 n. 1. The ninth- to twelfth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also notes the meeting.Clarkson (2014) p. 8; Crawford (2013); Walker, IW (2013) ch. 5; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 132. The \\"D\\" version of the chronicle records that Kn√∫tr went to Rome in 1031, and soon after travelled to Scotland where he received the submission of an unnamed Scottish king. The later \\"E\\" version provides more information, stating that, after his return from Rome in 1031, Kn√∫tr went to Scotland and received the submission of three kings named: \\"M√¶lcolm\\", \\"M√¶lb√¶√æe\\", and \\"Iehmarc\\".Firth (2018) p. 49, 49 n. 86; McGuigan (2015) p. 161; Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 574; Lawson (2013); Molyneaux (2011) p. 76; Bolton (2009) pp. 136, 149; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 197‚Äì198; Downham (2004) p. 64; Irvine (2004) p. 76; Oram (2000) p. 16; Swanton (1998) pp. 156, 157, 159; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 104; Whitelock (1996) p. 255; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 350, 350 n. 2; Anderson (1922a) pp. 546‚Äì547 n. 1, 590‚Äì592 n. 2; Thorpe (1861) pp. 290‚Äì291; Stevenson (1853) p. 94. The latter name appears to be a phonetic form of the Gaelic Echmarcach, a relatively uncommon name.Oram (2000) p. 16; Hudson, BT (1992) pp. 355, 360. The three men almost certainly refer to: M√°el Coluim mac Cin√°eda, King of Scotland, Mac Bethad mac Findla√≠ch, and Echmarcach himself.Clarkson (2014) p. 8; Lawson (2013); Walker, IW (2013) ch. 5; Clancy, TO (2008) p. 29; Woolf (2007) p. 245; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 132‚Äì133; Broun (2004b); Downham (2004) p. 64; Etchingham (2001) p. 161; Hudson, BT (1992). Kn√∫tr as it appears on folio 6r of British Library Stowe 944.Lawson (2013); Stowe MS 944 (n.d.). Of the three kings, M√°el Coluim appears to have been the most powerful, and it is possible that Mac Bethad and Echmarcach were underkings or clientkings of his.Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 132‚Äì134. Mac Bethad appears to have become Mormaer of Moray in 1032 after the slaying of his kinsman, Gilla Comg√°in mac M√°el Brigti, Mormaer of Moray.Broun (2004a); Hudson, BT (1992) p. 354. Previous rulers of Moray are sometimes styled as kings by various Irish annals,The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1020.6; The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1029.5; McGuigan (2015) p. 161, n. 522; Bolton (2009) p. 145; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1020.6; Woolf (2007) p. 228; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1029.5; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 354, 354 n. 1. a fact which may explain why Mac Bethad was called a king when he met Kn√∫tr.Hudson, BT (1992) p. 354. Although the apparent date of Mac Bethad's accession to the mormaership (1032) appears to contradict the date of the kings' meeting (1031), this discrepancy can be accounted for in two ways. One possibility is that Gilla Comg√°in was actually slain in 1031 but only recorded in 1032. Another possibility is that Kn√∫tr merely returned from Rome in 1031, but actually met with the kings in 1032, after Gilla Comg√°in's demise and Mac Bethad's accession.Woolf (2007) pp. 246‚Äì247. There is further evidence that could cast doubt on the date of the meeting. Although the aforesaid versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle date Kn√∫tr's pilgrimage to 1031, he is otherwise known to have visited Rome in 1027. Whilst it is possible he undertook two pilgrimages during his career, it is more likely that the chronicle has misdated his journey. In fact, it possible that the chronicle failed to account for the time in which Kn√∫tr spent on the continent and Scandinavia after having visited Rome.Bolton (2009) p. 136 n. 117; Hudson, BT (1992) pp. 356‚Äì358. The name of M√°el Coluim mac Cin√°eda as it appears on folio 16v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: \\"Mael Colaim mac C√≠naetha\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1034.1; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1034.1; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 488 (n.d.). M√°el Coluim reigned as King of Scotland from 1005 to 1034,Broun (2004b). and may have been an overlord or opponent of Echmarcach. Further confusion about Kn√∫tr in Scottish affairs comes from a continental source. At some point before about 1030, the eleventh-century Historiarum libri quinque, by Rodulfus Glaber, records that Kn√∫tr fought a long campaign against M√°el Coluim, and that hostilities were finally brought to a close by the intervention of Kn√∫tr's wife, Emma, and her brother, Richard II, Duke of Normandy.Wadden (2015) p. 26; Lawson (2013); Bolton (2009) pp. 136‚Äì137; Woolf (2007) pp. 239‚Äì240; Lawson (1993) pp. 104‚Äì105; Prou (1886) pp. 29‚Äì30. If Rodulfus' account is to be believed, this conflict must have taken place before Richard's death in 1026, and could refer to events surrounding M√°el Coluim's violent annexation of Lothian early in Kn√∫tr's reign.Lawson (2013); Lawson (1993) pp. 104‚Äì105. Despite uncertainties surrounding the reliability of Rodulfus' version of events,Bolton (2009) pp. 136‚Äì137. unless the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle has misdated Kn√∫tr's meeting in Scotland, Rodulfus' account could be evidence that Kn√∫tr involved himself with Scottish affairs before and after 1026. The name of Suibne mac Cin√°eda as it appears on folio 16v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: \\"Suibne mac Cinaetha\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1034.3; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1034.3; Anderson (1922a) p. 578; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 488 (n.d.). Suibne was a neighbouring contemporary of Echmarcach. The latter's dealings with the three kings could indicate he and Suibne were rivals along the western seaboard of Scotland.Downham (2007) p. 171. The record of Echmarcach in company with M√°el Coluim and Mac Bethad could indicate that he was in some sense a 'Scottish' ruler, and that his powerbase was located in the Isles. Such an orientation could add weight to the possibility that Echmarcach was descended from Ragnall mac Gofraid.Etchingham (2001) pp. 161, 181‚Äì182. As for M√°el Coluim, his influence in the Isles may be evidenced by the twelfth- century Prophecy of Berch√°n, which could indicate that he resided or exerted power in the Hebrides, specifically on the Inner Hebridean islands of Arran and Islay.Wadden (2016) p. 180; Duffy (2013) ch. 3; Woolf (2007) pp. 225‚Äì226, 253; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 133; Woolf (2004); Hudson, BT (1996) pp. 52 ¬ß 183, 90 ¬ß 183, 221; Anderson (1930) p. 51 ¬ß 181; Skene (1867) p. 99. Further evidence of M√°el Coluim's influence in the Isles may be preserved by the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster and the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach which record the death of a certain Suibne mac Cin√°eda in 1034. These particular sources style Suibne \\"ri Gall-Gaidhel\\" and \\"r√≠ Gall- G√°edel\\".The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1034.10; The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1034.3; Jennings; Kruse (2009) p. 125; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1034.10; Woolf (2007) p. 253; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1034.3; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 133. The Gaelic Gaidheal (plural Gaidheil) is primarily a linguistic term referring to speakers of Gaelic.Jennings (1996) p. 68. The Gaelic term Gall Gaidheil, literally meaning \\"Stranger-Gaidheil\\", was attributed to the population of mixed Scandinavian and Gaelic ethnicity in the Hebrides.Jennings (2015); Jennings; Kruse (2009) p. 124; Woolf (2007) p. 253 n. 45; Jennings (1996) p. 66. The fact that M√°el Coluim and Suibne died the same year and share patronyms could be evidence that they were brothers. If the two were indeed closely related, Suibne may have been set up by M√°el Coluim as a subordinate in an area of Scandinavian settlement.Woolf (2007) p. 253; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 133. One possibility is that the account of M√°el Coluim preserved by the Prophecy of Berch√°n could be evidence that this region encompassed the lands surrounding Kintyre and the Outer Clyde.Woolf (2007) p. 253. This source, combined with the other accounts of Kn√∫tr's meeting, could indicate that M√°el Coluim was then overlord of the Isles.Hudson, BT (1996) p. 223. =Context of the concordat with Kn√∫tr= The name of Mac Bethad mac Findla√≠ch as it appears on folio 41v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489 (the Annals of Ulster).The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1058.6; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1058.6; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). Mac Bethad was a powerful figure in north-eastern Scotland. The rationale behind the meeting of the four kings is uncertain. One possibility is that it was related to M√°el Coluim's annexation of Lothian,Oram (2011b) ch. 5; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 133; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 358. a region that likely encompassed an area roughly similar to the modern boundaries of Berwickshire, East Lothian, and possibly parts of Mid Lothian.Woolf (2007) pp. 234‚Äì235. The considerable span of years between this conquest and Kn√∫tr's meeting, however, could suggest that there were other factors.Hudson, BT (1992) p. 358. There appears to be evidence that the violent regime change in Moray (which enabled Mac Bethad to assume the mormaership) prompted Kn√∫tr to meet with the kings. Echmarcach and M√°el Coluim may thus have been bound to keep the peace with Mac Bethad's troubled lordship. Certainly, the accounts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle record that Kn√∫tr met the kings in \\"Scotland\\", a region that likely refers to land north of Firth of Forth.Woolf (2007) pp. 247‚Äì248. Another possibility is that M√°el Coluim aimed to gain Kn√∫tr's neutrality in a Scottish campaign against Mac Bethad, and sought naval support from Echmarcach himself.Walker, IW (2013) ch. 5. The absence of the King of Strathclyde from the assembled kings, and the possibility that Echmarcach's powerbase was situated somewhere in the Isles beyond Kintyre, could indicate that Kn√∫tr's main focus was on the troubled region of Moray, and the rulers whose lands it bordered. Another possibility is that the nonappearance of a Strathclyde representative is evidence that this Cumbrian realm had been recently annexed by the Scots which in turn drew a response from Kn√∫tr.Hicks (2003) p. 44 n. 107. Kn√∫tr may have sought the submission of the assembled kings in an attempt to protect his northern borders.Oram (2011b) ch. 5; Aird (2009) p. 310; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 134; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 104; Hudson, BT (1992) pp. 358‚Äì359. Additionally, he may have sought to prevent these kings from allowing military aid to reach potential challengers to his authority.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 134; Oram (2000) p. 31; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 359. If Echmarcach's father was indeed a son of Ragnall mac Gofraid, it would have meant that he was a nephew of Lagmann mac Gofraid. The latter was closely associated with √ìl√°fr Haraldsson, and together both lent military assistance to Richard II in the early eleventh century.Wadden (2015) pp. 31‚Äì32; Downham (2004) p. 65. There is also evidence to suggest that the predecessors of Ragnall mac Gofraid and Lagmann possessed connections with the Normans.Wadden (2015) pp. 27‚Äì28. In consequence, there is reason to suspect that Kn√∫tr sought to counter a potential association between Echmarcach and Richard II. Kn√∫tr and √ìl√°fr were certainly at odds. In 1028, only a few years before the meeting of kings, Kn√∫tr seized control of Norway after defeating √ìl√°fr. Kn√∫tr proceeded to appoint his own nephew, H√°kon Eir√≠ksson, as regent in Norway. Unfortunately for Kn√∫tr, H√°kon perished at sea in late 1029 or early 1030.Lawson (2013); Bolton (2009) p. 147; Woolf (2007) p. 246; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 196‚Äì197; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 131‚Äì132; Krag (2003) p. 194; Oram (2000) p. 31. About three years later, Kn√∫tr's overlordship in Norway was challenged by a certain Tryggvi √ìl√°fsson.Hollander (2011) pp. 535‚Äì536 ch. 249; Bolton (2009) p. 147; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 124‚Äì125; Hudson, B (1994) pp. 333‚Äì334; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 359; J√≥nsson (1908a) p. 247; J√≥nsson (1908b) p. 231. This man seemingly possessed connections with Dublin and the Isles, as saga-tradition appears to reveal that his mother, Gy√∞a, was a daughter of Amla√≠b Cuar√°n.Finlay; Faulkes (2016) pp. 166‚Äì167 ch. 32; Downham (2014) p. 25; Finlay; Faulkes (2014) p. 275 ch. 248; Hollander (2011) pp. 171‚Äì172 ch. 32, 538 ch. 248; Bolton (2009) p. 147; Edmonds (2008); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 221; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 84, 124‚Äì125, 223 n. 16; Oram (2000) p. 11; Hudson, B (1994) p. 323, 323 n. 16; Anderson (1922a) pp. 487 n. 2, 506, 506‚Äì507 n. 2; J√≥nsson (1911) pp. 126‚Äì127 ch. 32, 417 ch. 248; Storm (1899) p. 428 ch. 248; Vigfusson (1887) p. 15 ch. 12; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 359; Unger (1868) pp. 149‚Äì150 chs. 33‚Äì34, 511‚Äì512 ch. 262; Laing (1844a) pp. 399‚Äì400 chs. 33‚Äì34; Laing (1844b) p. 355 ch. 262. Although Tryggvi apparently enjoyed considerable local support when he landed in Norway in about 1033, he was nonetheless overwhelmed by forces loyal to Kn√∫tr and killed. Tryggvi is unlikely to have been Kn√∫tr's only challenger,Bolton (2009) p. 147. and the episode itself evinces the way in which potential threats to Kn√∫tr could emerge from the Scandinavian settlements in Britain and Ireland.Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 124‚Äì125; Hudson, B (1994) pp. 333‚Äì334; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 359. Close connections between the rulers of Orkney and the family of √ìl√°fr may well have posed a potential threat to Kn√∫tr.Bolton (2009) p. 148. The concordat between Kn√∫tr and the three kings could, therefore, have been a calculated attempt to disrupt the spread of Orcadian power, and an attempt to block possible Orcadian intervention into Norway.Bolton (2009) p. 150. Specifically, Kn√∫tr may have wished to curb the principal Orcadian, √û√≥rfinnr Sigur√∞arson, Earl of Orkney. In fact, √û√≥rfinnr appears to have been in open conflict with Mac Bethad.Bolton (2009) pp. 142‚Äì146. This violence may be evidenced by (chronologically- suspect) saga-tradition, which appears to indicate that Mac Bethad and his father warred with Orcadian earls.Bolton (2009) pp. 143‚Äì146; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) pp. 209‚Äì210. Saga-tradition may also reveal that Echmarcach suffered from √û√≥rfinnr's military advances.Bolton (2009) p. 146; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 135. For example, the thirteenth-century Orkneyinga saga states that, after √û√≥rfinnr's consolidation of Orkney and Caithness‚Äîan action that likely took place after the death of his brother Br√∫si‚Äî√û√≥rfinnr was active in the Isles, parts of Galloway and Scotland, and even Dublin.Bolton (2009) p. 146; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 135; Vigfusson (1887) pp. 40‚Äì41 ch. 27; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) pp. 27‚Äì28 ch. 11. The saga also reveals that Br√∫si's son, R«´gnvaldr, arrived in Orkney at a time when √û√≥rfinnr was preoccupied with the after-effects of such campaigns, as it states that he was \\"much occupied\\" with men from the Isles and Ireland.Bolton (2009) p. 146, 146 n. 153; Crawford (2004); Williams, DGE (1997) p. 130; Anderson (1922a) p. 584 n. 4; Vigfusson (1887) pp. 39‚Äì40 ch. 26; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) pp. 26‚Äì27 ch. 10. Another source, √ìl√°fs saga helga, preserved within the thirteenth-century saga-compilation Heimskringla, claims that √û√≥rfinnr exerted power in Scotland and Ireland, and that he controlled a far-flung lordship which encompassed Orkney, Shetland, and the Hebrides.Hollander (2011) pp. 361‚Äì362 ch. 103; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 273; Unger (1868) pp. 334‚Äì335 ch. 109. Further evidence of √û√≥rfinnr's activities in the region may be preserved by √û√≥rfinnsdr√°pa, composed by the contemporary Icelandic skald Arn√≥rr √û√≥r√∞arson, which declares that √û√≥rfinnr raided throughout the Irish Sea region as far south as Dublin.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 135; Whaley (2003) p. 27; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 130; J√≥nsson (1908a) pp. 343‚Äì348; Vigfusson (1887) pp. 42‚Äì44 ch. 29; Anderson; Hjaltalin; Goudie (1873) pp. 29‚Äì30 ch. 13. The name of H√°kon Eir√≠ksson as it appears on folio 11v of AM 325 II 4to (√Ågrip af N√≥regskonungas«´gum): \\"H«´ÃÅkon\\".Driscoll (2008) pp. 36‚Äì37; AM 325 II 4to (n.d.). It is possible that Kn√∫tr took other actions to contain Orkney. Evidence that Kn√∫tr installed H√°kon as overlord of the Isles may be preserved by the twelfth-century √Ågrip af N√≥regskonungas«´gum.Abrams (2007) p. 181 n. 7; Woolf (2007) p. 246; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 196‚Äì198; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 130‚Äì131; Williams, DGE (1997) pp. 101‚Äì102. The historicity of this event is uncertain, however, and H√°kon's authority in the Isles is not attested by any other source.Driscoll (2008) p. 97 n. 78; Woolf (2007) p. 246; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 130‚Äì131. Be that as it may, this twelfth-century text states that H√°kon had been sent into the Isles by √ìl√°fr, and that H√°kon ruled the region for the rest of his life.Driscoll (2008) pp. 36‚Äì37; Woolf (2007) p. 246; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 129‚Äì131; Williams, DGE (1997) pp. 101‚Äì102. The chronology outlined by this source suggests that H√°kon left Norway at about the time √ìl√°fr assumed the kingship in 1016.Woolf (2007) p. 246; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 129‚Äì130. The former is certainly known to have been in Kn√∫tr's service soon afterwards in England.Woolf (2007) p. 246; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 131. One possibility is that Kn√∫tr installed H√°kon as overlord of Orkney and the Isles in about 1016/1017, before handing him possession of the Earldom of Worcester in about 1017. If this was the case, H√°kon would have been responsible for not only a strategic part of the Anglo-Welsh frontier, but also accountable for the far-reaching sea-lanes that stretched from the Irish Sea region to Norway.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 197. It seems likely that Kn√∫tr was more concerned about Orkney and the Isles, and the security of the sea-lanes around Scotland, than surviving sources let on.Crawford (2013). H√°kon's death at sea would have certainly been a cause of concern for Kn√∫tr's regime, and could have been directly responsible to the meeting between him and the three kings.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 196‚Äì198. If H√°kon had indeed possessed overlordship of the Isles, his demise could well have paved the way for Echmarcach's own rise to power. Having come to terms with the three kings, it is possible that Kn√∫tr relied upon Echmarcach to counter the ambitions of the Orcadians, who could have attempted to seize upon H√°kon's fall and renew their influence in the Isles.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 197‚Äì198. U√≠ Briain alliance and the conquest of Dublin The name of Donnchad mac Briain as it appears on folio 18r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: \\"Dondchod mac Briain\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1059.11; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1059.11; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 488 (n.d.). Following his meeting with Kn√∫tr, Echmarcach appears to have allied himself with the U√≠ Briain,Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 232; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 134. the descendants of Brian B√≥ruma mac Cenn√©tig, High King of Ireland.Jefferies (2005). In 1032, the eleventh- to fourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen states that Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster married the daughter of a certain Ragnall, adding: \\"hence the saying: 'the spring of Ragnall's daughter'\\".Wadden (2015) p. 32; Downham (2013a) p. 171, 171 n. 77; Downham (2013b) p. 147; Annals of Inisfallen (2010) ¬ß 1032.6; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) ¬ß 1032.6; Bracken (2004a); Etchingham (2001) p. 182; Duffy (1992) p. 97. This woman is elsewhere identified as Cacht ingen Ragnaill.The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1054.4; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1054.4; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 134; Etchingham (2001) p. 183. Like Echmarcach himself, Cacht's patronym could be evidence that she was a near relation of the Ragnalls who ruled Waterford, or else a descendant of Ragnall mac Gofraid.Downham (2013a) p. 171, 171 n. 77; Downham (2013b) p. 147. She could have therefore been a sisterWadden (2015) p. 32; Duffy (2014b); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 232; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 130 fig. 4, 134; Clancy, T (2001); Oram (2000) p. 18. or niece of Echmarcach himself.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 232; Oram (2000) p. 18. The name and title of Cacht ingen Ragnaill as they appear on folio 18r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: (\\"Cacht ingen Ragnaill, r√≠gan Erenn\\"). This source styles Cacht \\"Queen of Ireland\\",The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1054.4; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1054.4; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 488 (n.d.). which could reveal the affection that her husband, Donnchad, felt for her.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 134. At about the time of his union with Cacht, Donnchad aspired to become High King of Ireland. With powerful maritime forces at his command, Echmarcach would have certainly been regarded as an important potential ally. Clear evidence of an alliance between Echmarcach and the U√≠ Briain exists in the record of a marriage between Echmarcach's daughter, M√≥r, and Toirdelbach Ua Briain's son, Tadc,Downham (2017) p. 100 n. 62; Downham (2013b) p. 147; Candon (2006) p. 116; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 232; Candon (1988) p. 403. preserved by the twelfth-century Banshenchas, a text which records the marriage of Echmarcach's daughter, M√≥r, to Tadc, son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain.Downham (2017) p. 100 n. 62; Downham (2013b) p. 147; Duffy (2002) p. 55, 55 n. 7; Duffy (1993a) p. 34, 34 n. 16; Duffy (1992) p. 105, 105 n. 59; Candon (1988) p. 403; Dobbs (1931) pp. 196, 229. Annalistic evidence of such an alliance is found well into the late eleventh century. In fact, kinship between Echmarcach's descendants and the U√≠ Briain even led to the accession of one of Echmarcach's maternal grandsons, Domnall mac Taidc, to the kingship of the Isles at about the turn of the twelfth century. If Echmarcach was a son of Ragnall mac Gofraid, this alliance with the U√≠ Briain would have been a continuation of amiable relations between the two families. For example, the father of Ragnall mac Gofraid appears to have combined forces with Brian B√≥ruma in 984,Wadden (2015) pp. 28‚Äì29; Annals of Inisfallen (2010) ¬ß 984.2; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) ¬ß 984.2; Downham (2007) pp. 191, 195, 253; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 134. and Ragnall mac Gofraid himself is recorded to have died in Munster, the heartland of the U√≠ Briain.The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1005.1; Wadden (2015) p. 28; Chronicon Scotorum (2012) ¬ß 1005; Annals of Inisfallen (2010) ¬ß 1004.5; Chronicon Scotorum (2010) ¬ß 1005; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) ¬ß 1004.5; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1005.1; Downham (2007) pp. 193 fig. 12, 197; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 130 fig. 4, 134. If, on the other hand, Echmarcach and Cacht were descended from the Waterford dynasty, an alliance between the U√≠ Briain and this family may have been undertaken in the context of a struggle between the U√≠ Briain and the U√≠ Cheinnselaig. The contemporary leader of the latter kindred was Donnchad's principal opponent, Diarmait mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥, King of Leinster. Whilst the U√≠ Briain certainly allied themselves to Cacht and Echmarcach, Diarmait appears to have backed the descendants of Amla√≠b Cuar√°n, a man whose family appear to have opposed Echmarcach at a latter date.Duffy (1992) pp. 96‚Äì97. The name of Sitriuc mac Amla√≠b as it appears on folio 16v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: \\"Sitriuic mac Amlaim\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1028.2; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1028.2; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 488 (n.d.). In 1036, Echmarcach replaced Amla√≠b Cuar√°n's son, Sitriuc mac Amla√≠b, as King of Dublin.Wadden (2015) p. 31; Duffy (2006) p. 55; Connon (2005); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 227; Insley (2005); Hudson, BT (2004b); Etchingham (2001) pp. 181‚Äì182; Oram (2000) pp. 16, 34; Thornton (1996) p. 89; Duffy (1992) p. 96. The Annals of Tigernach specifies that Sitriuc fled overseas as Echmarcach took control.Wadden (2015) p. 31; The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1036.8; Duffy (2006) p. 55; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1036.8; Etchingham (2001) pp. 181‚Äì182; Oram (2000) p. 16; Thornton (1996) p. 89; Duffy (1992) p. 96; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. An alliance with Donnchad could explain Echmarcach's success in seizing the kingship from Sitriuc. Although Donnchad and Sitriuc were maternal half-brothers‚Äîas both descended from Gormlaith ingen MurchadaHudson, BT (2005) pp. 49 fig. 2, 83 fig. 3; Insley (2005); Bracken (2004a); Hudson, BT (2004b).‚ÄîDonnchad's hostility towards Sitriuc is demonstrated by the record of a successful attack he led upon the Dubliners in 1026.Annals of Inisfallen (2010) ¬ß 1026.2; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) ¬ß 1026.2; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 134; Duffy (1998) p. 76. Another factor behind Echmarcach's actions against Sitriuc could concern Kn√∫tr. Echmarcach's seizure of Dublin occurred only a year after the latter's death in 1035.Downham (2004) pp. 63‚Äì65. There appears to be numismatic evidence, annalistic evidence, and charter evidence indicating that Kn√∫tr and Sitriuc had cooperated together in terms of trade and military operations in Wales.Downham (2018) p. 112; Wadden (2015) p. 31; Downham (2014) p. 25; Lawson (2013); Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 120‚Äì125; Downham (2004) pp. 63‚Äì64; Hudson, BT (2004b); Oram (2000) pp. 31, 34; Abrams (1998) p. 27; Hudson, B (1994); Lawson (1993) pp. 106, 185. In contrast to this apparent congeniality, the relationship between Kn√∫tr and Echmarcach appears to have been less amiable. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach's meeting with Kn√∫tr may have bound him from taking action against Sitriuc, and that the confusion caused by Kn√∫tr's demise may have enabled Echmarcach to exploit the situation by seizing control of the Irish Sea region. According to a poetic verse composed by the contemporary Icelandic skald √ìttarr svarti, Kn√∫tr's subjects included Danes, Englishmen, Irishmen, and Islesmen.N√≠ Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 137; Jesch (2016) p. 314; Downham (2014) p. 25; Lawson (2013); Bolton (2009) pp. 131‚Äì132, 131‚Äì132 n. 99; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 119; Townend (2001) pp. 157‚Äì159, 158 n. 70, 159 n. 77; Abrams (1998) p. 27; Hudson, B (1994); Lawson (1993) p. 106; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 355 n. 3; J√≥nsson (1908a) p. 299; J√≥nsson (1908b) p. 275; Vigfusson; Powell (1883) p. 157. These Islanders could refer to either the folk of the IslesHudson, B (1994) p. 320. or Orkney,N√≠ Mhaonaigh (2018) p. 137; Townend (2001) p. 159 n. 77; Hudson, B (1994) p. 320. whilst the Irish seems to refer to the Dubliners.Hudson, B (1994). Although the poet's implication that Kn√∫tr possessed authority over Sitriuc is not corroborated by any other source, and may therefore be poetic hyperbole,Downham (2014) p. 25. the fact that Sitriuc had been able to undertake a pilgrimage and return home to an intact kingdom in 1028 may demonstrate the extent of influence that Kn√∫tr held over the Irish Sea region. This authority, and Sitriuc's apparent close connections with Kn√∫tr, could account for the security Sitriuc enjoyed during Kn√∫tr's reign.Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 119‚Äì127; Insley (2005). Ragnall ua √çmair, a member of the Waterford dynasty slain in 1035, as it appears on folio 39r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489.The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1035.5; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1035.5; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). If Echmarcach was a member of the Waterford dynasty, his action against Sitriuc may have been undertaken in the context of continuous dynastic strife between Dublin and Waterford in the tenth- and eleventh centuries. This could mean that Echmarcach's expulsion of Sitriuc was a direct act of vengeance for the latter's slaying of Ragnall ua √çmair (then King of Waterford) the year before.The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1035.5; Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1035.3; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1035.3; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1035.5; Duffy (2006) p. 55; Connon (2005); Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 227‚Äì228; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 129; Etchingham (2001) pp. 181‚Äì182; Duffy (1992) p. 96. Little is known of Echmarcach's short reign in Dublin other than an attack on Skryne and Duleek, recorded by the seventeenth- century Annals of the Four Masters in 1037.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1037.10; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1037.10; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 135; √ì Mura√≠le (1997) p. 202. This strike could have been undertaken in the context of the Dubliner's gradual loss of power in Brega, and an attempt to regain authority of Skryne.Bhreathnach (1999) p. 13. Although there is no direct evidence that Echmarcach controlled Mann at this point in his career, Sitriuc does not appear to have taken refuge on the island after his expulsion from Dublin. This seems to suggest that the island was outwith Sitriuc's possession, and may indicate that Mann had fallen into the hands of Echmarcach sometime before.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 229‚Äì231. In fact, it is possible that Echmarcach may have used the island to launch his takeover of Dublin.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 229‚Äì231; Oram (2000) pp. 16‚Äì17. Strife in the Isles, Ireland, and Wales Silver coin hoards and mixed hoards found in regions of Scandinavian Scotland and Mann.Williams, G (2004) p. 74 fig. 2. The third highest peak, during the 1030s‚Äì1050s, may illustrate intense conflict in the Irish Sea region.Williams, G (2004) p. 75. The evidence of √û√≥rfinnr's power in the Isles could suggest that he possessed an active interest in the ongoing struggle over the Dublin kingship.Byrne (2008) p. 897. √û√≥rfinnr's predatory operations in the Irish Sea region may have contributed to Echmarcach's loss of Dublin in 1038.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 135. Just as Echmarcach may have seized upon Kn√∫tr's demise to expand, it is possible that the vacuum caused by Kn√∫tr's death allowed √û√≥rfinnr to prey upon the Irish Sea region. Certainly, the corresponding annal-entry of the Annals of Tigernach‚Äîstating that √çmar mac Arailt succeeded Echmarcach as King of Dublin that year‚Äîappears to indicate that Echmarcach had been forced from the kingship.The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1038.1; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1038.1; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 228; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 135; Oram (2000) p. 16; Duffy (1992) p. 96; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. √çmar appears have been a descendant (possibly a grandson) of Amla√≠b Cuar√°n, and thus a close relative of the latter's son, Sitriuc, whom Echmarcach drove from the kingship only two years before.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 228, 228 n. 29; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 83 fig. 3, 135, 171; Oram (2000) pp. 16, 46 n. 81; Duffy (1992) pp. 96, 96 n. 14, 106. It is possible that √çmar received some form of support from Kn√∫tr's son and successor in England, Haraldr Kn√∫tsson, King of England. The latter was certainly in power when √çmar replaced Echmarcach, and an association between √çmar and Haraldr Kn√∫tsson could explain why the Annals of Ulster reports the latter's death two years later.The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1040.6; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1040.6; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 135‚Äì136. The fact that √çmar proceeded to campaign in the North Channel could indicate that Echmarcach had held power in this region before his acquisition of Mann and Dublin.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 229; Oram (2000) p. 16. Whatever the case, √çmar's reign lasted only eight years. In 1046, the Annals of the Four Masters records that he was expelled by Echmarcach, who was then elected king by the Dubliners.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1046.8; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1046.8; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 228; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 137; Duffy (1992) p. 96; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. The Annals of Tigernach, on the other-hand, simply state that Echmarcach succeeded √çmar.The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1046.6; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1046.6; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 228; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 137; Oram (2000) p. 16; Duffy (1992) p. 96; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. Echmarcach may well have controlled Mann throughout his second reign in Dublin.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 228; Oram (2000) p. 16. Silver hoards uncovered on Mann, dated by their coins to the years 1030s‚Äì1050s, may well be the by-product of the intense conflict over control of the island.Williams, G (2004) p. 74 fig. 2, 75. There is evidence indicating that, at some point in the early eleventh centuryHudson, BT (2005) pp. 137‚Äì138.‚Äîperhaps in the 1020s‚Äì1030s‚Äîa mint may have developed and functioned on Mann.Naismith (2017) p. 319; Barrett (2016) p. 4; Williams, G (2007) pp. 204‚Äì205; Williams, G (2004) p. 77; Williams, DGE (1997) p. 202. Coins that appear to have been minted on the island roughly coincide with Echmarcach's rule. These coins are very similar to those produced in Dublin, and may be evidence that Echmarcach attempted to harmonise the coinage utilised within his realm. The production of coins on Mann appears to be evidence of a sophisticated economy in the Isles. In fact, the wealth and sophistication of commerce in Echmarcach's realm could in part explain why the constant struggle for control of Dublin and the Isles was so bitter, and could account for √û√≥rfinnr's apparent presence in the region.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 140. The name and title of Echmarcach's opponent √çmar mac Arailt as they appear on folio 41r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 489.The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1054.1; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1054.1; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). During his second reign, Echmarcach may have been involved in military activities in Wales with Gruffudd ap Rhydderch.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 137. For instance in the year 1049, English and Welsh sources record that Norse-Gaelic forces were utilised by Gruffudd ap Rhydderch against his Welsh rivals and English neighbours. Specifically, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Brut y Tywysogyon, and the twelfth- century Chronicon ex chronicis record that a Norse-Gaelic fleet sailed up the River Usk, and ravaged the surrounding region. These sources further reveal that Gruffudd ap Rhydderch and his Norse-Gaelic allies later surprised and routed the English forces of Ealdred, Bishop of Worcester.Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 564; Walker, D (2006); Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 121, 137; Lawson; King (2004); DeVries (1999) pp. 90‚Äì91, 91 n. 63; Swanton (1998) pp. 170, 171; Maund (1993) p. 164; Barlow (1970) pp. 99, 204; Lloyd (1912) p. 362, 362 nn. 11‚Äì12; Thorpe (1908) p. 203; Thorpe (1861) p. 310; Williams Ab Ithel (1860b) pp. 42‚Äì43; Forester (1854) p. 149; Stevenson (1853) pp. 105, 281‚Äì282. Since Echmarcach's extensive imperium appears to have spanned the Irish Sea region, it is possible that he was regarded as a threat by Siward, Earl of Northumbria.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 206‚Äì207; Oram (2000) p. 34. There is reason to suspect that, by the mid eleventh century, this Anglo-Danish magnate extended his authority into what had previously been the Kingdom of Strathclyde.McGuigan (2015a) pp. 124‚Äì125, 134; Edmonds (2014) pp. 209‚Äì210; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 206‚Äì207; Oram (2000) p. 34. Echmarcach's apparent descent from the U√≠ √çmair‚Äîa dynasty that once reigned over York as kings‚Äîcombined with Echmarcach's accumulation of power after Kn√∫tr's demise, could well have been a cause of concern to the York-based earl. Such unease could partly account for Siward's extension of power into the Solway region, a sphere of insecure territory which may have been regarded as vulnerable by Echmarcach. Downfall in Dublin and Mann The name of Diarmait mac Ma√≠l na mB√≥ as it appears on folio 18r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: \\"Diarmuit mac Mail na m-Bo\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1059.2; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1059.2; Bodleian Library MS.

These annalistic accounts indicate that, although Diarmait's conquest evidently began with a mere raid upon Fine Gall, this action further escalated into the seizure of Dublin itself. Following several skirmishes fought around the town's central fortress, the aforesaid accounts report that Echmarcach fled overseas, whereupon Diarmait assumed the kingship. With Diarmait's conquest, Norse-Gaelic Dublin ceased to be an independent power in Ireland;Byrne (2008) p. 863. and when Diarmait and his son, Murchad, died about twenty years later, Irish rule had been exercised over Fine Gall and Dublin in a degree unheard of before.Duffy (1993b). In consequence of Echmarcach's expulsion, Dublin effectively became the provincial capital of Leinster,Duffy (2009) p. 291. with the town's remarkable wealth and military power at Diarmait's disposal.Duffy (2009) pp. 291‚Äì292; Byrne (2008) p. 863; Hudson, B (2005); Duffy (1993b). Ruinous Cruggleton Castle from a distance. The fortress was likely a power centre of later Lords of Galloway,Oram (2008) pp. 171, 181; Oram (2000) p. 148. and could have been a seat of Echmarcach himself.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 139. The fact that in 1054, √çmar mac Arailt is styled on his death \\"r√≠ Gall\\", a title meaning \\"king of the foreigners\\", could indicate that Diarmait reinserted him as King of Dublin after Echmarcach's expulsion.Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1054.1; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1054.1; Duffy (1992) p. 97. Murchad appears to have been granted the kingship by 1059, as evidenced by the title tigherna Gall, meaning \\"lord of the foreigners\\", accorded to him that year.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1059.20; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1059.20; Duffy (2002) p. 54, 54 n. 3; Duffy (1993a) p. 32, 32 n. 5; Duffy (1992) pp. 99‚Äì100, 100 n. 34. Murchad was evidently an energetic figure, and in 1061 he launched a successful seaborne invasion of Mann.Wadden (2015) p. 32; Charles-Edwards (2013) pp. 528, 564; Duffy (2009) p. 291; Duffy (2006) pp. 55‚Äì56; Hudson, B (2005); Duffy (2002) p. 54; Oram (2000) pp. 16‚Äì18, 166‚Äì167; Duffy (1993a) pp. 32‚Äì33; Duffy (1993b); Duffy (1992) p. 100; Candon (1988) pp. 401‚Äì402.

The gathering of c√°in or tribute was a mediaeval right of kingship in Ireland.Duffy (2006) p. 56; Duffy (2002) p. 54; Duffy (1993a) p. 33; Duffy (1993b); Duffy (1992) p. 100. In fact, Murchad's collection of such tribute from the Manx could be evidence that, as the King of Dublin, Murchad regarded himself as the rightful overlord of Mann.Duffy (2006) p. 56. If the vanquished son of Ragnall was Echmarcach himself, as seems most likely,Hudson, B (2005); Duffy (2002) p. 54; Duffy (1997) p. 37; Duffy (1993a) pp. 32‚Äì33; Duffy (1992) p. 100; Candon (1988) p. 402; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. the record of Murchad's actions against him would appear to indicate that Echmarcach had seated himself on the island after his expulsion from Dublin.Byrne (2008) pp. 864, 892; Duffy (2006) pp. 55‚Äì56; Etchingham (2001) p. 154; Duffy (1993a) pp. 32‚Äì33; Duffy (1992) p. 100. Another possibility is that Echmarcach had only been reestablished himself as king in the Isles after √çmar mac Arailt's death in 1054. Magn√∫s Haraldsson and √Ülfgar Leofricson The name of √Ülfgar Leofricson as it appears on folio 161v of British Library Cotton Tiberius B I (the \\"C\\" version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle): \\"√Ülfgar eorl\\".O'Keeffe (2001) p. 115; Swanton (1998) p. 184; Thorpe (1861) p. 324; Stevenson (1853) p. 111; Cotton MS Tiberius B I (n.d.). In 1055, after being outlawed for treason in the course of a comital power-struggle, English nobleman √Ülfgar Leofricson fled from England to Ireland. √Ülfgar evidently received considerable military aid from the Irish to form a fleet of eighteen ships, and together with Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, King of Gwynedd and Deheubarth invaded Herefordshire.Barlow (2013) pp. 74‚Äì75; Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 565; Moore (2013) ch. 3; Woolf (2007) p. 266; Redknap (2006) p. 8; Hudson, B (2005); Downham (2004) p. 67; Irvine (2004) pp. 84‚Äì85; Walker, D (2004); Williams, A (2004); Snyder (2003) p. 183; O'Keeffe (2001) pp. 115‚Äì116; DeVries (1999) pp. 134‚Äì136; Swanton (1998) pp. 184‚Äì187; Maund (1993) p. 165; Hudson, BT (1991) pp. 332, 345; Barlow (1970) p. 206, 206 n. 3; Walker, D (1960) pp. 85, 90‚Äì91; Thorpe (1861) pp. 324‚Äì325; Stevenson (1853) pp. 111‚Äì112. Although this campaign ultimately secured √Ülfgar's reinstatement, √Ülfgar (then Earl of Mercia) was again exiled from England in 1058, and proceeded to ally himself with Gruffudd ap Llywelyn and a Norse fleet.Gough-Cooper (2015a) p. 49 ¬ß b1078.1; Gough-Cooper (2015b) p. 27 ¬ß c380.1; Barlow (2013) p. 87; Charles- Edwards (2013) p. 566; Moore (2013) ch. 3; Hudson, B (2005); Downham (2004) p. 67; Snyder (2003) p. 183; DeVries (1999) pp. 67, 67 n. 195, 140‚Äì142; Maund (1993) pp. 125, 165; Hudson, BT (1991) pp. 332, 345; Barlow (1970) pp. 208‚Äì209; Walker, D (1960) p. 92; Thorpe (1908) p. 217; Lloyd (1899‚Äì1900) pp. 170‚Äì171; Jones; Williams; Pughe (1870) p. 663; Williams Ab Ithel (1860b) pp. 44‚Äì45; Forester (1854) p. 160; Stevenson (1853) p. 289. Notwithstanding the fact that Scandinavian sources fail to report this operation,Woolf (2007) p. 267. the Annals of Tigernach reveals that the leader of the fleet was Magn√∫s, son of Haraldr Sigur√∞arson, King of Norway, and further reports that Magn√∫s' forces were composed of Orcadians, Islesmen, and Dubliners.Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 566; The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1058.4; Etchingham (2007) pp. 162‚Äì164; Woolf (2007) p. 266; Duffy (2006) p. 61; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1058.4; Downham (2004) p. 67; Etchingham (2001) pp. 152‚Äì158; DeVries (1999) p. 67, 67 n. 195; Maund (1993) p. 165; Hudson, BT (1991) p. 332, 332 n. 10; Barlow (1970) pp. 208‚Äì209; Anderson (1922b) p. 1. Exactly who √Ülfgar received aid from in the Irish Sea region is uncertain. It is conceivable that, after his flight from England in 1055, √Ülfgar was outfitted in Dublin, then ruled by Murchad (with Diarmait as overlord).Woolf (2007) pp. 266‚Äì267; Hudson, B (2005); Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 152, 157; Downham (2004) p. 67; Maund (1993) p. 165. Likewise, since Diarmait's forces had previously driven Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, and apparently from Mann in 1061, the joint campaign of √Ülfgar and Magn√∫s in 1058‚Äîwhich utilised Islesmen and Dubliners‚Äîcould well have involved Diarmait's cooperation as well.Hudson, B (2005); Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 152, 157; Hudson, BT (2004a); Etchingham (2001) p. 154. That being said, there are several reasons to doubt a part played by Diarmait in √Ülfgar's military undertakings. For instance, Diarmait seems to have lent assistance to √Ülfgar's enemies‚Äîthe Godwinsons‚Äîin the 1050s and 1060s.Downham (2018) p. 112; Wyatt (2018) p. 791 n. 196; Barlow (2013) pp. 58, 165‚Äì166, 168‚Äì169; Wyatt (2009) p. 385, 385 n. 196; Downham (2004) pp. 66‚Äì67; Hudson, BT (2004a); Etchingham (2001) p. 155; Hudson, BT (1991) pp. 348‚Äì349. Diarmait also appears to have previously backed Cynan ab Iago, a man who was a bitter rival and seemingly the eventual slayer of √Ülfgar's ally and son-in-law, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 151; Downham (2004) p. 67; Etchingham (2001) p. 155; DeVries (1999) p. 143 n. 66; Hudson, BT (1991) pp. 340‚Äì344, 348. The name of Magn√∫s Haraldsson as it appears on folio 22r of AM 47 fol (Eirspennill): \\"Magnus son Ha Äalldz konvngs\\".J√≥nsson (1916) p. 78; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). √Ülfgar's Irish confederate of 1055 is not identified in any source, and it is not clear that Diarmait had a part to play in the aforesaid events of that year.Etchingham (2001) p. 154. In fact, it is possible that √Ülfgar received aid not from Diarmait, but from Donnchad‚ÄîDiarmait's enemy and Echmarcach's associate‚Äîa man who then controlled the Norse-Gaelic enclaves of Limerick and possibly Waterford. Furthermore, although Diarmait appears to have gained overlordship of Mann by 1061, Echmarcach presumably enjoyed overlordship of at least part of the Hebrides in 1058. Since Magn√∫s utilised Islesmen during his English campaign of that year, it is conceivable that Echmarcach may have played a prominent part in these operations. If Echmarcach was indeed involved in the campaign, the enmity between him and Diarmait could indicate that these two were unlikely to have cooperated as allies.Downham (2004) p. 67; Etchingham (2001) pp. 154‚Äì155. The prime motivation behind Magn√∫s' cooperation with √Ülfgar is uncertain. One possibility is that he was attempting to establish Norwegian authority in the west as a means to prepare an invasion of England. In so doing, Magn√∫s may have backed the cause of a local faction that opposed Echmarcach. Certainly, the thirteenth- to fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann records that √çmar's apparent son, Gofraid Crob√°n‚Äîa future ruler of Dublin and the Isles‚Äîbacked the Norwegian invasion of England led by Magn√∫s' father in 1066.Downham (2004) pp. 67‚Äì68; Anderson (1922b) pp. 18 n. 1, 43‚Äì44 n. 6; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 50‚Äì51. Pilgrimage and death in Rome Interior of Santo Stefano Rotondo, an ancient Italian basilica in which Echmarcach and Donnchad may have spent their final days. In 1064, Echmarcach seems to have accompanied by Donnchad upon a pilgrimage to Rome.Wadden (2015) p. 32; Duffy (2014b); Duffy (2013) ch. 3; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 143; Bracken (2004b); Clancy, TO (2002) pp. 24‚Äì25; Clancy, T (2001); Etchingham (2001) p. 182, 182 n. 108; Duffy (1992) p. 97; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 356; Candon (1988) p. 402; Gwynn (1953) pp. 196‚Äì197; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. By this time the two may well have been of an advanced age,Duffy (2014b); Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 143‚Äì144. and both appear to have died in the city soon afterwards.Duffy (2014a) p. 11; Duffy (2014b); Flanagan (2010) p. 231, 231 n. 196; Bracken (2004a); Etchingham (2001) p. 182, 182 n. 108; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 356; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2.

The eleventh-century Chronicon of Marianus Scotus records that Echmarcach died in 1065,McGuigan (2015) p. 107; Wadden (2015) p. 32; Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 573, 573 n. 182; N√≠ √ördail (2012) p. 170; Flanagan (2010) p. 231 n. 196; Clancy, TO (2008) p. 28; Downham (2007) p. 171; Woolf (2007) p. 245; Clancy, TO (2006) p. 51; Duffy (2006) pp. 56‚Äì57; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 229; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 70, 129, 138; Duffy (2002) pp. 53‚Äì54; Etchingham (2001) pp. 160, 182 n. 108; Oram (2000) p. 17; Duffy (1993a) p. 32; Duffy (1992) pp. 98‚Äì99; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 356, 356 n. 1; Candon (1988) p. 402; Byrne (1982); Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2; Waitz (1844) p. 559. in a statement which implies that Echmarcach and Donnchad travelled to Rome together.Flanagan (2010) p. 231 n. 196; Etchingham (2001) p. 182 n. 108; Gwynn (1953) pp. 196‚Äì197. Donnchad himself seems to have died in 1064,Duffy (2014a) p. 11; Wadden (2015) p. 32; Flanagan (2010) p. 231; Bracken (2004a); N√≠ Mhaonaigh (1995) p. 360. as a multitude of sources report his pilgrimage to Rome and demise that year.Duffy (2014b). Several of these sources appear to indicate that Donnchad died at Santo Stefano Rotondo, an ancient basilica on the Caelian Hill.Duffy (2014b); Flanagan (2010) p. 231 n. 196; Etchingham (2001) p. 182 n. 108. This building was an important place of pilgrimage to contemporaries, and apparently housed both Echmarcach and Donnchad before they died. Pilgrimages such as those of Echmarcach and Donnchad were not unheard of amongst high-ranking Gaelic and Norse-Gaelic contemporaries, and several such high-status figures are known to have perished undertaking pilgrimages of their own to Rome.Duffy (2014b); Flanagan (2010) p. 231; Clancy, TO (2006) pp. 50‚Äì52. If Echmarcach's father was indeed Ragnall mac Gofraid, and if Echmarcach had been born only a few years before his father's death, Echmarcach would have thus been about sixty- five when he himself was laid to rest. The name of Amla√≠b mac Sitriuc as it appears on folio 16v of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: \\"Amlaim mac Sitriuca\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2016) ¬ß 1034.2; Annals of Tigernach (2005) ¬ß 1034.2; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 488 (n.d.). Amla√≠b was the son of Echmarcach's Dublin opponent, Sitriuc, and may have been a neighbouring ruler in Galloway. Marianus Scotus' account of Echmarcach accords him the Latin title \\"rex Innarenn\\". On one hand, this may be a garbled form of the Latin \\"rex insularum\\", meaning \\"King of the Isles\\".Flanagan (2010) p. 231 n. 196; Duffy (2006) pp. 56‚Äì57. If so, the titles \\"ri Gall\\" and \\"r√≠ Gall\\" accorded to him by the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of Inisfallen in 1064 could indicate that he was still regarded as ruler of Mann.The Annals of Ulster (2017) ¬ß 1064.4; Annals of Inisfallen (2010) ¬ß 1064.5; Flanagan (2010) p. 231 n. 196; Annals of Inisfallen (2008) ¬ß 1064.5; The Annals of Ulster (2008) ¬ß 1064.4; Duffy (2006) p. 56; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. On the other hand, \\"rex Innarenn\\" could instead mean \\"King of the Rhinns\\", in reference to the Rhinns of Galloway.McGuigan (2015) p. 107; Wadden (2015) p. 32; Charles- Edwards (2013) p. 573, 573 n. 182; Clancy, TO (2008) p. 28; Downham (2007) p. 171; Woolf (2007) p. 245; Clancy, TO (2006) p. 51; Duffy (2006) pp. 56‚Äì57; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 229; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 70, 129, 138; Duffy (2002) pp. 53‚Äì54; Etchingham (2001) pp. 160, 182 n. 108; Oram (2000) p. 17; Duffy (1993a) p. 32; Duffy (1992) pp. 98‚Äì99; Hudson, BT (1992) p. 356; Candon (1988) p. 402. During Echmarcach's floruit, the Rhinns appears have also included what is today known as the Machars. The entire region would have thus stretched from the North Channel to Wigtown Bay, and would have likely encompassed an area similar to the modern boundaries of Wigtownshire.Clancy, TO (2008) pp. 28, 32; Woolf (2007) pp. 245, 254; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 138. Earlier in the century, the entire region may have formed part of Sitriuc's realm,Woolf (2007) p. 254. and various Irish and Welsh sources indicate that it may have been held by one of the latter's two sons named Amla√≠b.McGuigan (2015) pp. 107‚Äì108; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 229‚Äì230; Duffy (1992) p. 99. If Echmarcach was indeed the son of Ragnall mac Gofraid, and succeeded his father sometime in the 1030s, Echmarcach may well have first gained control of the Rhinns when he apparently began his domination of the Irish Sea region in 1036 (the year he first seized Dublin). Even if such a chronology is correct it does not necessarily mean that Echmarcach owed his rule in the Rhinns to ancestral connections in the Isles‚Äîit could have instead derived from his new- found position in Dublin.Charles-Edwards (2013) p. 574. Although in practice, the collection of c√°in could be undertaken without the displacement of an underking, if \\"rex Innarenn\\" indeed refers to the Rhinns it could reveal that, after having been defeated by Murchad on Mann, the defeated Echmarcach fled to this mainland region.Duffy (2002) p. 54; Duffy (1992) p. 100. Furthermore, if Echmarcach was a native of what is today the south-west of Scotland, the title could be evidence that, on the collapse of Echmarcach's once expansive kingdom, Echmarcach proceeded to entrench himself in the protection of his native home.Hudson, BT (2005) p. 138. Marga√∞r and Guthormr Gunnhildarson Marga√∞r's name as it appears on folio 19v of AM 47 fol: \\"Marga√∞r\\".J√≥nsson (1916) p. 69; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). This name has erroneously been regarded as an Old Norse form of Echmarcach. Echmarcach has sometimes been identified as a certain Marga√∞r who appears in various mediaeval sources documenting the contemporary Irish Sea adventures of Marga√∞r and Guthormr Gunnhildarson. One such source is Haralds saga Sigur√∞arsonar, within Heimskringla. According to this source, Marga√∞r was King of Dublin, and a close friend of Guthormr, an accomplished man who was a nephew of the Norwegian kings √ìl√°fr and Haraldr Sigur√∞arson.Finlay; Faulkes (2015) chs. 54‚Äì55; Hollander (2011) pp. 618‚Äì619 chs. 54‚Äì55; Byrne (2008) pp. 889‚Äì890; Kunin; Phelpstead (2008) p. 110; Hudson, B (2006) p. 75; Barlow (1970) pp. 200‚Äì201; Sellar (1966) p. 132; Dickens (1945) p. 72; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590, 590‚Äì592 n. 2; J√≥nsson (1911) pp. 480‚Äì481 chs. 54‚Äì55; Storm (1899) pp. 493‚Äì494 chs. 54‚Äì55; Unger (1868) pp. 587‚Äì588 chs. 56‚Äì57; Laing (1844c) pp. 50‚Äì52 chs. 56‚Äì57. Late one summer, the saga relates that Marga√∞r and Guthormr took part in particularly successful raid in Wales. As their loot of silver was being assessed, Marga√∞r demanded Guthormr's share, forcing the latter to fight for his portion of the plunder. Although outnumbered sixteen ships to five, the saga relates that, through the miraculous intervention of God and Guthormr's saintly uncle (√ìl√°fr), Guthormr was able to defeat and slay Marga√∞r and all his followers in the ensuing battle. Guthormr's name as it appears on folio 18r of AM 47 fol: \\"Guthormr Gunnhilldarson\\".J√≥nsson (1916) p. 63; AM 47 Fol (n.d.). The fateful encounter between Marga√∞r and Guthormr is sometimes dated to 1052 on the presumption that Marga√∞r is identical to Echmarcach, and that the event must have taken place at the conclusion of Echmarcach's second reign in Dublin.Byrne (2008) pp. 889‚Äì890; Anderson (1922a) pp. 590‚Äì592 n. 2. In fact, the Old Norse personal name Marga√∞r is a form of the Gaelic personal name Murchad,Byrne (2008) p. 890; Kunin; Phelpstead (2008) p. 110; Woolf (2007) p. 244 n. 29; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 143; Woolf (2005) p. 4; Hudson, B (2002) p. 246; √ì Corr√°in (1998) p. 448; √ì Cu√≠v (1998) p. 80; Poole (1991) p. 131; Sayers (1991) p. 172; Sellar (1966) p. 132. and the aforesaid accounts of Marga√∞r likely refer to Echmarcach's nemesis Murchad, rather than Echmarcach himself.Byrne (2008) p. 890; Kunin; Phelpstead (2008) p. 110; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 8‚Äì9, 143. Although the saga claims that a thankful Guthormr donated a portion of his looted silver to the shrine of his saintly uncle at Ni√∞ar√≥ss,Finlay; Faulkes (2015) ch. 55; Crawford (2013); Hollander (2011) p. 619 ch. 55; Byrne (2008) pp. 889‚Äì890; Hudson, BT (2005) pp. 8‚Äì9, 143; J√≥nsson (1911) pp. 480‚Äì481 ch. 55; Storm (1899) pp. 493‚Äì494 ch. 55; Unger (1868) pp. 587‚Äì588 ch. 57; Laing (1844c) pp. 51‚Äì52 ch. 57. it is unlikely that any church would have accepted property known to have been looted from Christians. Instead, it is possible that Guthormr's hoard of silver was actually the tax that Murchad which had collected from Mann in 1061 during the expulsion of Echmarcach.Kunin; Phelpstead (2008) p. 110; Hudson, BT (2005) p. 143. Such a date corresponds to the implied date of about 1061 given by Heimskringla.Kunin; Phelpstead (2008) p. 110.

It is the British section of the International Commission of Jurists, the international human rights organisation of lawyers devoted to the legal protection of human rights worldwide. Consequently, members of JUSTICE are predominantly barristers and solicitors, judges, legal academics, and law students. JUSTICE is independent and all-party, having representatives of the three major political parties on its ruling Council. It is a registered charity under English law. JUSTICE's director is Andrea Coomber, and the chair of JUSTICE Council is Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws QC.  History  JUSTICE was founded in 1957, following the visit of a group of British lawyers to observe the treason trials of members of the African National Congress (ANC) in apartheid South Africa and the show-trials in communist Hungary. Its first chairman was Hartley Shawcross, the chief British prosecutor at Nuremberg, and another founder was Peter Benenson who would later establish Amnesty International. Indeed, when AI first started in 1961, it shared its offices with JUSTICE. In 1958, it became the British section of the International Commission of Jurists ('ICJ'). The original terms of JUSTICE's constitution committed it \`to uphold and strengthen the principles of the Rule of Law in the territories for which the British Parliament is directly or ultimately responsible: in particular, to assist in the administration of justice and in the preservation of the fundamental liberties of the individual'. Indeed, JUSTICE itself gave birth to a number of subordinate branches in what were then still British colonies and dependent territories. As each of these countries moved towards independence in the 1960s, the branches reconstituted themselves as national sections of the ICJ. This, in turn, shifted the emphasis of JUSTICE's own work towards the UK itself. Thus, although founded with an international orientation, JUSTICE quickly established a specific focus on the rule of law and protection of fundamental rights in the UK. Through the work of its first secretary, Tom Sargant OBE, JUSTICE rapidly developed expertise in cases involving miscarriages of justice, and secured the release of many prisoners who had been wrongly imprisoned. Sargant was instrumental in the establishment of the BBC series Rough Justice, which led to the release from prison of eighteen victims of miscarriages of justice. At the same time JUSTICE developed as a policy organisation, producing reports that helped establish the UK's Ombudsman system, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, the Data Protection Act 1998, and the Criminal Cases Review Commission. Similarly, many of the measures contained in the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 were previously put forward by JUSTICE. Through the 1990s it established and developed programmes on human rights legislation, criminal justice, asylum and immigration, discrimination and privacy. It campaigned for the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law by way of the Human Rights Act 1998. Dame Anne Owers CBE, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, was previously the Director of JUSTICE until 2001. Previous Chairs of JUSTICE include Lord Alexander of Weedon QC, Lord Goodhart QC, and the former Law Lord, Lord Steyn.  Current work  The main areas of JUSTICE's work are: * Human rights * Criminal justice * EU law * The rule of law JUSTICE's focus is on UK law but its work involves highlighting the importance of international human rights law as well as bringing to bear the insights of comparative analysis of other jurisdictions. European law plays an increasingly large role in this work. It works primarily by briefing parliamentarians and policy-makers on the human rights implications of legislation. As a policy organisation it is less involved in overt campaigning and individual casework and more on providing independent, expert legal analysis on matters of fundamental rights. It also works at the European and international levels, lobbying the European Union institutions, the Council of Europe and the various United Nations treaty bodies. Each of JUSTICE's areas of work in turn covers a broad range of issues, including asylum and immigration, counter-terrorism, equality and discrimination, privacy, EU Freedom Justice and Security issues, legal aid and access to justice, as well as constitutional issues tied to the role of the judiciary and Parliamentary scrutiny of legislation. JUSTICE also has a long history of intervening in cases of public importance involving the protection of fundamental rights. To this end, it has intervened before in cases before the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords, the Privy Council, the European Court of Human Rights, and the European Court of Justice. In October 2009, it became the first NGO to intervene in a case before the UK Supreme Court.

Pelly Crossing is a community in Yukon, Canada. It lies where the Klondike Highway crosses the Pelly River. Population in 2008 was 291. It is the home of the Selkirk First Nation, and home to the Northern Tutchone culture. Cultural displays and artifacts are housed in a replica of Big Jonathan House. Visitors can make the journey from Minto by boat to visit the original structure down the Yukon River at Fort Selkirk, an important historic and cultural site for the Northern Tutchone people. History The Selkirk First Nation community was established as a ferry crossing and a highway construction camp when the Klondike Highway from Whitehorse to Dawson City was built in 1950. With the completion of the Pelly River bridge and the road to Dawson City, sternwheeler traffic on the Yukon River came to a halt. Fort Selkirk, located near the confluence of Pelly and Yukon Rivers, was virtually abandoned. The Government of Canada forced members of Selkirk First Nation to move from Fort Selkirk to Minto Landing before settling at Pelly Crossing. Today, the restored Fort Selkirk is a common stop for Yukon River travelers. Geography Pelly Crossing is located on the Pelly River, 155 miles south of Dawson City on the Klondike Highway. =Climate= Pelly Crossing has a severely continental subarctic climate (Dfc) with short but warm summers, but with the vast majority of the year being dominated by the bitterly cold winters. During cold snaps temperatures approaching has been recorded. The weather is rather dry and summer nights remain cool.

The Aqueduct was decommissioned on 7 February 1972, but the high costs of purchase and filling caused Lillydale Council to repeatedly defer negotiations to purchase the land from the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW). History In 1974‚Äì75, the Shire of Lillydale offered to buy land for a central park in Mount Evelyn for a low price ($10,000) on the grounds that the people of Mount Evelyn had been disadvantaged in the past by the aqueduct splitting the town and residents being unable to connect to the water supply, but the Board was unresponsive. In 1974, the Board sold a portion of the land at the junction of the old O'Shannassy Aqueduct and the Silvan Outlet channel for the Melba Centre, but the $120,000 set for the whole Aqueduct was too high for Council. In May 1979, a series of chance encounters alerted David and Jean Edwards to the possibility that the aqueduct land might be sold off for development or to adjacent landowners. The Property Officer of the Board of Works confirmed that offers had been invited from adjoining landowners in the \\"rural\\" section (from Hazel Street to Hunter Road), with replies due 10‚Äì16 July. Enquiries to the Lillydale Council indicated that the Board had applied for re-zoning, but response from the Shire was extremely guarded. A stay of action was sought after volunteers took a hurriedly framed petition to the Shopping Centre and schools, and presented 230 signatures to Mr A. R. Patterson, the Board member representing eastern municipalities. At the Board meeting, immediate sales proposals were stalled, but the real work of raising the level of awareness of the aqueduct land as potential linear parkland had only begun. Many newcomers to Mount Evelyn were unaware that the aqueduct existed. Protection association The Mount Evelyn Environment Protection and Progress Association (MEEPPA) held a Public Meeting at Morrison House chaired by John Muys. Those residents from the Hazel Street/Priestly Crescent section were reassured that their properties (bisected by pipeline) would not be included in the Aqueduct Park. Meanwhile, East Riding resident and MEEPPA Vice-President Neil Pope was elected to the Lillydale Shire Council, giving the aqueduct park a voice inside Council, and a petition was presented to the Legislative Assembly with 1500 signatures asking for a full-scale investigation of the proposal for a linear park. During 1979‚Äì80, the Board of Works continued breaking up the concrete lining of the channel and filling with clay dug to install the sewer in Mount Evelyn. Only the section beyond Nekla Street still possesses the original open channel. In early 1980 Council recommended subdividing or transferring to adjacent landowners most of the aqueduct reserve as we now know it. From Wedderburn Crescent to York Road was to be retained by Council as \\"linear reserve\\", that opposite the Clegg Road intersection was proposed for \\"an institutional purpose or transferred to Council as a public reserve or site for municipal development\\" and the section south of Priestley Crescent was to be public open space, but not by managed by Council. Mount Evelyn Environment Protection and Progress Association (MEEPPA) members, especially Vin Mishkinis and Jan Simmons, doorknocked homes in all streets close to the aqueduct, informing people of the threat, and inviting them to join the \\"Friends of the Aqueduct Park\\". Of the 359 who joined, 222 lived in Mount Evelyn and 128 offered to attend working bees. In addition to copies of the 359 \\"Friends\\" forms, 37 submissions, plus 19 signatures on joint letters or petitions, were made to the Council. Approximately 5 of these supported private use of the land. The remainder supported retaining the aqueduct as linear park. The decision in open Council, moved by Graham Colling, to purchase three kilometres \\"in principle\\", satisfied nobody. The MMBW then announced that their price was $261,000. Lillydale Shire, divided into four ridings with the aqueduct in East Riding, had East Riding Councillors Colling and Gersch in favour of selling the land. State politics came into play with the 1982 State election. Neil Pope and Bill Borthwick, opposing candidates, both supported the linear park proposal. Neil Pope, now the member for Monbulk, addressed Parliament in May 1982. Considerable efforts were made to resolve the ownership, financial and management issues. In 1983‚Äì84, Lillydale Shire Council built the Joy Avenue kindergarten on aqueduct land which it did not own. Largely through the efforts of Neil Pope, negotiations on a price of $80,000 between the Shire and the MMBW began in 1984. By 1989 the issue of sale was \\"clarified by the restriction that the majority of the land had to be purchased as a whole by a public authority, and not sold off privately\\". Partnership The Friends of the Mount Evelyn Aqueduct works in partnership with the Shire to fulfil the details of the Management Plan prepared in 1991 by Green and Dale.

It is the first volume of Capitalism and Schizophrenia, the second being A Thousand Plateaus (1980). Deleuze and Guattari analyse the relationship of desire to reality especially through schizophrenia and psychosis, and to capitalist society; they address human psychology, economics, society, the creative arts, literature, civilization, psychiatry and history.Foucault (1977, 14). They outline a \\"materialist psychiatry\\" modeled on the unconscious in its relationship with its productive processes built on the concept of desiring-production (which interrelates \\"desiring machines\\" and a \\"body without organs\\"), offer a critique of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis that focuses on its theory of the Oedipus complex, and repurpose Karl Marx's materialist account of the history of society's modes of production as a development through \\"primitive, despotic and capitalist\\" societies which ultimately oedipalizes. They also detail their different organisations of production, \\"inscription\\" (an act inflicted on all social bodies which corresponds to Marx's \\"distribution\\" and \\"exchange\\") and consumption, and they develop a critical practice that they called schizoanalysis which the book proposes. Other thinkers the authors draw on and criticize include Baruch Spinoza, Immanuel Kant, Charles Fourier, Friedrich Nietzsche, Charles Sanders Peirce, Carl Jung, Melanie Klein, Karl Jaspers, Lewis Mumford, Karl August Wittfogel, Wilhelm Reich, Georges Bataille, Louis Hjelmslev, Jacques Lacan, Gregory Bateson, Pierre Klossowski, Claude L√©vi- Strauss, Jacques Monod, Louis Althusser, Victor Turner, Jean Oury, Jean- Fran√ßois Lyotard, Michel Foucault, Frantz Fanon, R. D. Laing, David Cooper, and Pierre Clastres.Deleuze and Guattari (1980, 423‚Äì427). They also draw on creative writers and artists such as Antonin Artaud, Samuel Beckett, Georg B√ºchner, Samuel Butler, D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, Marcel Proust, Arthur Rimbaud, Daniel Paul Schreber, Adolf W√∂lfli, Vaslav Nijinsky, G√©rard de Nerval and J. M. W. Turner. Anti-Oedipus has been seen as a sequel to Nietzsche's book The Antichrist.Seem (1977, xviii, xx). Anti-Oedipus became a sensation upon publication and a widely celebrated work that shifted contemporary philosophy. It is seen as a key text in the micropolitics of desire, alongside Lyotard's Libidinal Economy (1974). It has been credited with having devastated the French Lacanian movement, although \\"schizoanalysis\\" has been regarded as flawed for multiple reasons, including the emancipatory claims Deleuze and Guattari make for schizophrenia. Summary =Schizoanalysis= Richard Lindner's painting \\"Boy with Machine\\" (1954) demonstrates the schizoanalytic thesis of the primacy of desire's social investments over its familial ones: \\"the turgid little boy has already plugged a desiring-machine into a social machine, short-circuiting the parents.\\"Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 8, 51, 392). The painting forms the frontispiece of Anti-Oedipus. Deleuze and Guattari's \\"schizoanalysis\\" is a militant social and political analysis that responds to what they see as the reactionary tendencies of psychoanalysis.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 54, 108, 127‚Äì128, 325-xx). Deleuze and Guattari argue that there was no specific \\"turning point\\" in the theoretical development of Freudianism at which it became reactionary; instead, it contained \\"revolutionary, reformist, and reactionary elements\\" from the start. \\"We refuse to play 'take it or leave it',\\" they write. This politically ambiguous mixture of tendencies in psychoanalysis arises, they argue, from its ambiguous relationship with its discoveries: \\"As if every great doctrine were not a combined formation, constructed from bits and pieces, various intermingled codes and flux, partial elements and derivatives, that constitute its very life or becoming. As if we could reproach someone for having an ambiguous relationship with psychoanalysis, without first mentioning that psychoanalysis owes its existence to a relationship, theoretically and practically ambiguous, with what it discovers and the forces that it wields\\" (1972, 128). Despite the militancy of the analyses proposed within Deleuze and Guattari's project, they insist that \\"no political program will be elaborated within the framework of schizoanalysis\\" (1972, 415). Guattari developed the implications of their theory for a concrete political project in his book with the Italian autonomist marxist philosopher Antonio Negri, Communists Like Us (1985). For the variable relations between the socius of capital and revolutionary autonomous territorialities, see Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 410). It proposes a functional evaluation of the direct investments of desire‚Äîwhether revolutionary or reactionary‚Äîin a field that is social, biological, historical, and geographical.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 93, 115, 322‚Äì333, 354, 400). Deleuze and Guattari develop four theses of schizoanalysis: # Every unconscious libidinal investment is social and bears upon a socio-historical field. # Unconscious libidinal investments of group or desire are distinct from preconscious investments of class or interest. # Non- familial libidinal investments of the social field are primary in relation to familial investments. # Social libidinal investments are distinguished according to two poles: a paranoiac, reactionary, fascisizing pole and a schizoid revolutionary pole.First thesis (1972, 375); second thesis (1972, 377); third thesis (1972, 390); fourth thesis (1972, 401). In contrast to the psychoanalytic conception, schizoanalysis assumes that the libido does not need to be de-sexualised, sublimated, or to go by way of metamorphoses in order to invest economic or political factors. \\"The truth is,\\" Deleuze and Guattari explain, \\"sexuality is everywhere: the way a bureaucrat fondles his records, a judge administers justice, a businessman causes money to circulate; the way the bourgeoisie fucks the proletariat; and so on. [...] Flags, nations, armies, banks get a lot of people aroused.\\"Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 322‚Äì333). In the terms of classical Marxism, desire is part of the economic, infrastructural \\"base\\" of society, they argue, not an ideological, subjective \\"superstructure.\\"Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 114, 378). In failing to recognise this, Deleuze and Guattari argue, Wilhelm Reich fell short of the materialist psychiatry towards which he aimed and was unable to provide an adequate answer to his question \\"Why did the masses desire fascism?\\" Unconscious libidinal investments of desire coexist without necessarily coinciding with preconscious investments made according to the needs or ideological interests of the subject (individual or collective) who desires.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 114, 322). Deleuze and Guattari qualify this distinction between unconscious desire and preconscious need or interest when they write: \\"It is doubtless true that interests predispose us to a given libidinal investment\\"; however, they go on to insist once again that the interests \\"are not identical with this investment\\" (1972, 379). > A form of social production and reproduction, along with its economic and > financial mechanisms, its political formations, and so on, can be desired as > such, in whole or in part, independently of the interests of the desiring- > subject. It was not by means of a metaphor, even a paternal metaphor, that > Hitler was able to sexually arouse the fascists. It is not by means of a > metaphor that a banking or stock-market transaction, a claim, a coupon, a > credit, is able to arouse people who are not necessarily bankers. And what > about the effects of money that grows, money that produces more money? There > are socioeconomic \\"complexes\\" that are also veritable complexes of the > unconscious, and that communicate a voluptuous wave from the top to the > bottom of their hierarchy (the military‚Äìindustrial complex). And ideology, > Oedipus, and the phallus have nothing to do with this, because they depend > on it rather than being its impetus.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 114‚Äì115). Schizoanalysis seeks to show how \\"in the subject who desires, desire can be made to desire its own repression‚Äîwhence the role of the death instinct in the circuit connecting desire to the social sphere.\\"Section 2.5 The Conjunctive Synthesis of Consumption-Consummation, pp. 98, 105 Desire produces \\"even the most repressive and the most deadly forms of social reproduction.\\"Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 31). Desiring machines and social production The traditional understanding of desire assumes an exclusive distinction between \\"production\\" and \\"acquisition.\\"Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 26). This line of thought‚Äîwhich has dominated Western philosophy throughout its history and stretches from Plato to Freud and Lacan‚Äîunderstands desire through the concept of acquisition, insofar as desire seeks to acquire something that it lacks. This dominant conception, Deleuze and Guattari argue, is a form of philosophical idealism.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 26). Alternative conceptions, which treat desire as a positive, productive force, have received far less attention; the ideas of the small number of philosophers who have developed them, however, are of crucial importance to Deleuze and Guattari's project: principally Nietzsche's will to power and Spinoza's conatus.Kant's analysis of superstitious beliefs, hallucinations, and fantasies in his Critique of Judgment treats desire as a creative, productive force, Deleuze and Guattari explain, although his analysis limits its effects to the production of a psychic reality and thereby retains the validity of desire-as- lack; (1972, 26‚Äì27). Deleuze and Guattari argue that desire is a positive process of production that produces reality.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 28). On the basis of three \\"passive syntheses\\" (partly modelled on Kant's syntheses of apperception from his Critique of Pure Reason), desire engineers \\"partial objects, flows, and bodies\\" in the service of the autopoiesis of the unconscious.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 28), Guattari (1992, 15), and Holland (1999, 25). In this model, desire does not \\"lack\\" its object; instead, desire \\"is a machine, and the object of desire is another machine connected to it.\\" On this basis, Deleuze and Guattari develop their notion of desiring- production.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 1‚Äì9). Since desire produces reality, social production, with its forces and relations, is \\"purely and simply desiring-production itself under determinate conditions.\\" Like their contemporary, R. D. Laing, and like Reich before them, Deleuze and Guattari make a connection between psychological repression and social oppression. By means of their concept of desiring-production, however, their manner of doing so is radically different. They describe a universe composed of desiring- machines, all of which are connected to one another: \\"There are no desiring- machines that exist outside the social machines that they form on a large scale; and no social machines without the desiring machines that inhabit them on a small scale.\\"Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 373). When they insist that a social field may be invested by desire directly, they oppose Freud's concept of sublimation, which posits an inherent dualism between desiring-machines and social production. This dualism, they argue, limited and trapped the revolutionary potential of the theories of Laing and Reich. Deleuze and Guattari develop a critique of Freud and Lacan's psychoanalysis, anti- psychiatry, and Freudo-Marxism (with its insistence on a necessary mediation between the two realms of desire and the social). Deleuze and Guattari's concept of sexuality is not limited to the interaction of male and female gender roles, but instead posits a multiplicity of flows that a \\"hundred thousand\\" desiring-machines create within their connected universe; Deleuze and Guattari contrast this \\"non-human, molecular sexuality\\" to \\"molar\\" binary sexuality: \\"making love is not just becoming as one, or even two, but becoming as a hundred thousand,\\" they write, adding that \\"we always make love with worlds.\\"Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 323, 325). Reframing the Oedipal complex The \\"anti-\\" part of their critique of the Freudian Oedipal complex begins with that original model's articulation of society based on the family triangle of father, mother and child. Criticizing psychoanalysis \\"familialism\\", they want to show that the oedipal model of the family is a kind of organization that must colonize its members, repress their desires, and give them complexes if it is to function as an organizing principle of society. Instead of conceiving the \\"family\\" as a sphere contained by a larger \\"social\\" sphere, and giving a logical preeminence to the family triangle, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the family should be opened onto the social, as in Bergson's conception of the Open, and that underneath the pseudo- opposition between family (composed of personal subjects) and social, lies the relationship between pre-individual desire and social production. Furthermore, they argue that schizophrenia is an extreme mental state co-existent with the capitalist system itselfDeleuze and Guattari (1972, 34‚Äì35) and capitalism keeps enforcing neurosis as a way of maintaining normality. However, they oppose a non-clinical concept of \\"schizophrenia\\" as deterritorialization to the clinical end-result \\"schizophrenic\\" (i.e. they do not intend to romanticize \\"mental disorders\\"; instead, they show, like Foucault, that \\"psychiatric disorders\\" are always second to something else). Body without organs BwO as an egg: \\"it is crisscrossed with axes and thresholds, with latitudes and longitudes and geodesic lines, traversed by gradients marking the transitions and the becomings, the destinations of the subject developing along these particular vectors.\\"Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 21). Deleuze and Guattari develop their concept of the \\"body without organs\\" (often rendered as BwO) from Antonin Artaud's text \\"To Have Done With the Judgment of God\\". Since desire can take on as many forms as there are persons to implement it, it must seek new channels and different combinations to realize itself, forming a body without organs for every instance. Desire is not limited to the affections of a subject, nor the material state of the subject. Bodies without organs cannot be forced or willed into existence, however, and they are essentially the product of a zero-intensity condition that Deleuze and Guattari link to catatonic schizophrenia that also becomes \\"the model of death\\". Criticism of psychoanalysts Deleuze and Guattari address the case of G√©rard Mendel, Bela Grunberger and Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel, who were prominent members of the most respected psychoanalytic association (the International Psychoanalytical Association). They argue that this case demonstrates that psychoanalysis enthusiastically embraces a police state:section 2.4 The disjunctive synthesis of recording p. 89 > As to those who refuse to be oedipalized in one form or another, at one end > or the other in the treatment, the psychoanalyst is there to call the asylum > or the police for help. The police on our side!‚Äînever did psychoanalysis > better display its taste for supporting the movement of social repression, > and for participating in it with enthusiasm. [...] notice of the dominant > tone in the most respected associations: consider Dr. Mendel and the Drs > St√©phane, the state of fury that is theirs, and their literally police-like > appeal at the thought that someone might try to escape the Oedipal dragnet. > Oedipus is one of those things that becomes all the more dangerous the less > people believe in it; then the cops are there to replace the high priests. Bela Grunberger and Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel were two psychoanalysts from the Paris section of the International Psychoanalytical Association. In November 1968 they disguised themselves under the pseudonym Andr√© St√©phane and published L‚Äôunivers Contestationnaire, in which they argued that the left-wing rioters of May 68 were totalitarian stalinists, and proceeded to psychoanalyze them as suffering from a sordid infantilism caught up in an Oedipal revolt against the Father.Jean-Michel Rabat√© (2009) 68 + 1: Lacan's ann√©e √©rotique published in Parrhesia, Number 6 ‚Ä¢ 2009 pp. 28‚Äì45Andr√© St√©phane [Bela Grunberger and Janine Chasselet-Smirguel], L‚ÄôUnivers Contestationnaire (Paris: Payot, 1969). Jacques Lacan regarded Grunberger and Chasseguet-Smirgel's book with great disdain; while they were still disguised under the pseudonym, Lacan remarked that he was certain that neither author belonged to his school, as none would abase themselves to such low drivel.Jacques Lacan, The Seminars of Jacques Lacan, Seminar XVI D'un Autre √† l'autre, 1968‚Äì9, p. 266 The IPa analysts responded with an accusation against the Lacan school of \\"intellectual terrorism.\\" G√©rard Mendel published La r√©volte contre le p√®re (1968) and Pour d√©coloniser l‚Äôenfant (1971). =Fascism, the family, and the desire for oppression= Desiring self-repression Deleuze and Guattari address a fundamental problem of political philosophy: the contradictory phenomenon whereby an individual or a group comes to desire their own oppression.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 31); see also Deleuze and Foucault (1972, 212). This contradiction had been mentioned briefly by the 17th-century philosopher Spinoza: \\"Why do men fight for their servitude as stubbornly as though it were their salvation?\\"In Theologico-Political Treatise, Preface. The original Latin text reads: \\"ut pro servido, tanquam pro salute pugnent\\". That is, how is it possible that people cry for \\"More taxes! Less bread!\\"? Wilhelm Reich discussed the phenomenon in his 1933 book The Mass Psychology of Fascism:Anti-Oedipus, section I.4 A Materialist PsychiatryWilhelm Reich (1946) The Mass Psychology of Fascism, section I.3 The Problem of Mass Psychology, originally published in 1933 > The astonishing thing is not that some people steal or that others > occasionally go out on strike, but rather that all those who are starving do > not steal as a regular practice, and all those who are exploited are not > continually out on strike: after centuries of exploitation, why do people > still tolerate being humiliated and enslaved, to such a point, indeed, that > they actually want humiliation and slavery not only for others but for > themselves?\\" To address this question, Deleuze and Guattari examine the relationships between social organisation, power, and desire, particularly in relation to the Freudian \\"Oedipus complex\\" and its familial mechanisms of subjectivation (\\"daddy-mommy-me\\"). They argue that the nuclear family is the most powerful agent of psychological repression, under which the desires of the child and the adolescent are repressed and perverted.Section II.7 Social Repression and Psychic repression, pp. 123‚Äì32Holland (1999) p. 57 Such psychological repression forms docile individuals that are easy targets for social repression.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 396). By using this powerful mechanism, the dominant class, \\"making cuts (coupures) and segregations pass over into a social field\\", can ultimately control individuals or groups, ensuring general submission. This explains the contradictory phenomenon in which people \\"act manifestly counter to their class interests‚Äîwhen they rally to the interests and ideals of a class that their own objective situation should lead them to combat\\".Anti-Oedipus, section 2.5 The Conjunctive Synthesis of Consumption- Consummation, Desire and the infrastructure, p.104 Deleuze and Guattari's critique of these mechanisms seeks to promote a revolutionary liberation of desire: > If desire is repressed, it is because every position of desire, no matter > how small, is capable of calling into question the established order of a > society: not that desire is asocial, on the contrary. But it is explosive; > there is no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing > entire social sectors. Despite what some revolutionaries think about this, > desire is revolutionary in its essence ‚Äî desire, not left-wing holidays! ‚Äî > and no society can tolerate a position of real desire without its structures > of exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy being compromised.Deleuze and > Guattari (1972, 126‚Äì127). The family under capitalism as an agent of repression The family is the agent to which capitalist production delegates the psychological repression of the desires of the child.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 130‚Äì131). Psychological repression is distinguished from social oppression insofar as it works unconsciously.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 130). Through it, Deleuze and Guattari argue, parents transmit their angst and irrational fears to their child and bind the child's sexual desires to feelings of shame and guilt. Psychological repression is strongly linked with social oppression, which levers on it. It is thanks to psychological repression that individuals are transformed into docile servants of social repression who come to desire self- repression and who accept a miserable life as employees for capitalism.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 396). A capitalist society needs a powerful tool to counteract the explosive force of desire, which has the potential to threaten its structures of exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy; the nuclear family is precisely the powerful tool able to counteract those forces.pp.115, 119‚Äì20 The action of the family not only performs a psychological repression of desire, but it disfigures it, giving rise to a consequent neurotic desire, the perversion of incestuous drives and desiring self-repression. The Oedipus complex arises from this double operation: \\"It is in one and the same movement that the repressive social production is replaced by the repressing family, and that the latter offers a displaced image of desiring-production that represents the repressed as incestuous familial drives.\\" =Capitalism and the political economy of desire= Territorialisation, deterritorialisation, and reterritorialisation Although (like most Deleuzo-Guattarian terms) deterritorialization has a purposeful variance in meaning throughout their oeuvre, it can be roughly described as a move away from a rigidly imposed hierarchical, arborescent context, which seeks to package things (concepts, objects, etc.) into discrete categorised units with singular coded meanings or identities, towards a rhizomatic zone of multiplicity and fluctuant identity, where meanings and operations flow freely between said things, resulting in a dynamic, constantly changing set of interconnected entities with fuzzy individual boundaries. Importantly, the concept implies a continuum, not a simple binary ‚Äì every actual assemblage (a flexible term alluding to the heterogeneous composition of any complex system, individual, social, geological) is marked by simultaneous movements of territorialization (maintenance) and of deterritorialization (dissipation). Various means of deterritorializing are alluded to by the authors in their chapter \\"How to Make Yourself A Body Without Organs\\" in A Thousand Plateaus, including psychoactives such as peyote. Experientially, the effects of such substances can include a loosening (relative deterritorialization) of the worldview of the user (i.e. his/her beliefs, models, etc.), subsequently leading to an antiredeterritorialization (remapping of beliefs, models, etc.) that is not necessarily identical to the prior territory. Deterritorialization is closely related to Deleuzo-Guattarian concepts such as line of flight, destratification and the body without organs/BwO (a term borrowed from Artaud), and is sometimes defined in such a way as to be partly interchangeable with these terms (most specifically in the second part of Capitalism and Schizophrenia, A Thousand Plateaus). Deleuze and Guattari posit that dramatic reterritorialization often follows relative deterritorialization, while absolute deterritorialization is just that... absolute deterritorialization without any reterritorialization. =Terminology borrowed from science= A vector field on a sphere. During the course of their argument, Deleuze and Guattari borrow a number of concepts from different scientific fields. To describe the process of desire, they draw on fluid dynamics, the branch of physics that studies how a fluid flows through space. They describe society in terms of forces acting in a vector field. They also relate processes of their \\"body without organs\\" to the embryology of an egg, from which they borrow the concept of an inductor.Deleuze and Guattari (1972, 92‚Äì93, 100‚Äì101). Deleuze and Guattari develop this relation further in the chapter \\"November 28, 1947: How Do You Make Yourself a Body Without Organs?\\" in their sequel to Anti-Oedipus, A Thousand Plateaus (1980, 165‚Äì184). Reception and influence The philosopher Michel Foucault wrote that Anti- Oedipus can best be read as an \\"art\\", in the sense that is conveyed by the term \\"erotic art.\\" Foucault considered the book's three \\"adversaries\\" as the \\"bureaucrats of the revolution\\", the \\"poor technicians of desire\\" (psychoanalysts and semiologists), and \\"the major enemy\\", fascism. Foucault used the term \\"fascism\\" to refer \\"not only historical fascism, the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini...but also the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us.\\" Foucault added that Anti-Oedipus is \\"a book of ethics, the first book of ethics to be written in France in quite a long time\\", and suggested that this explains its popular success. Foucault proposed that the book could be called Introduction to the Non- Fascist Life. Foucault argued that putting the principles espoused in Anti- Oedipus into practice involves freeing political action from \\"unitary and totalizing paranoia\\" and withdrawing allegiance \\"from the old categories of the Negative (law, limit, castration, lack, lacuna), which western thought has so long held sacred as a form of power and an access to reality.\\" Inspired by Foucault and Deleuze, the political journalist Natasha Lennard in her book Being Numerous: Essays on a Non-Fascist Life used the term ‚Äúnon-fascist‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúanti-fascist.‚Äù Lennard argues that the term ‚Äúnon-fascist‚Äù also appealed as a gesture to the complications of ‚Äúanti-fascist‚Äù as a label widely used in communist countries in the decades since World War II. Specifically, Lennard argues that asserting one‚Äôs position as ‚Äúanti-fascist‚Äù became, in many ways, meaningless when even the most far-right, fascistic political groups disavowed the moniker ‚Äúfascist.‚Äù The psychiatrist David Cooper described Anti- Oedipus as \\"a magnificent vision of madness as a revolutionary force\\", crediting its authors with using \\"the psychoanalytic language and the discourse of Saussure (and his successors)\\" to pit \\"linguistics against itself in what is already proving to be an historic act of depassment.\\" The critic Frederick Crews wrote that when Deleuze and Guattari \\"indicted Lacanian psychoanalysis as a capitalist disorder\\" and \\"pilloried analysts as the most sinister priest-manipulators of a psychotic society\\", their \\"demonstration was widely regarded as unanswerable\\" and \\"devastated the already shrinking Lacanian camp in Paris.\\" The philosopher Douglas Kellner described Anti- Oedipus as its era's publishing sensation, and, along with Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard's Libidinal Economy (1974), a key text in \\"the micropolitics of desire.\\" The psychoanalyst Joel Kovel wrote that Deleuze and Guattari provided a definitive challenge to the mystique of the family, but that they did so in the spirit of nihilism, commenting, \\"Immersion in their world of 'schizoculture' and desiring machines is enough to make a person yearn for the secure madness of the nuclear family.\\" Anthony Elliott described Anti-Oedipus as a \\"celebrated\\" work that \\"scandalized French psychoanalysis and generated heated dispute among intellectuals\\" and \\"offered a timely critique of psychoanalysis and Lacanianism at the time of its publication in France\\". However, he added that most commentators would now agree that \\"schizoanalysis\\" is fatally flawed, and that there are several major objections that can be made against Anti-Oedipus. In his view, even if \\"subjectivity may be usefully decentred and deconstructed\\", it is wrong to assume that \\"desire is naturally rebellious and subversive.\\" He believed that Deleuze and Guattari see the individual as \\"no more than various organs, intensities and flows, rather than a complex, contradictory identity\\" and make false emancipatory claims for schizophrenia. He also argued that Deleuze and Guattari's work produces difficulties for the interpretation of contemporary culture, because of their \\"rejection of institutionality as such\\", which obscures the difference between liberal democracy and fascism and leaves Deleuze and Guattari with \\"little more than a romantic, idealized fantasy of the 'schizoid hero'\\". He wrote that Anti-Oedipus follows a similar theoretical direction to Lyotard's Libidinal Economy, though he sees several significant differences between Deleuze and Guattari on the one hand and Lyotard on the other. Some of Guattari's diary entries, correspondence with Deleuze, and notes on the development of the book were published posthumously as The Anti-Oedipus Papers (2004).Guattari (2004). The philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani wrote that rather than having their confidence shaken by the \\"provocations and magnificent rhetorical violence\\" of Anti-Oedipus, the psychoanalytic profession felt that the debates raised by the book legitimated their discipline. Joshua Ramey wrote that while the passage into Deleuze and Guattari's \\"body without organs\\" is \\"fraught with danger and even pain ... the point of Anti-Oedipus is not to make glamorous that violence or that suffering. Rather, the point is to show that there is a viable level of Dinoysian [sic] experience.\\" The philosopher Alan D. Schrift wrote in The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy (2015) that Anti-Oedipus was \\"read as a major articulation of the philosophy of desire and a profound critique of psychoanalysis.\\" See also * Antipsychiatry * Feminism and the Oedipus complex * Id, ego, and super-ego * La Borde clinic * Madness and Civilization * Nietzsche and Philosophy * Objet petit a * Plane of immanence * Psychoanalytic conceptions of language * Psychological repression * Castration anxiety Notes Sources * Deleuze, Gilles. 2004.

It is the inspiration for \\"Bear Down, Arizona!,\\" the unofficial fight song of the school's Arizona Wildcats. The official fight song is \\"Fight! Wildcats! Fight!\\" written by Douglas Holsclaw. History John B. Salmon (Button Salmon) was the student body president, as well as the starting quarterback for the Wildcat football team and the catcher for the Wildcat baseball team, and member of Sigma Nu fraternity and Chain Gang Junior Honorary. The day after the first game of the 1926 football season, Salmon and two others were involved in an automobile accident, in which their vehicle flipped over in a ravine. Although Salmon's friends were not injured, Salmon suffered a severe spinal cord injury. In the aftermath of the accident, football coach Pop McKale visited him in the hospital every day. During McKale's last visit, Salmon's last message to his teammates was, \\"Tell them.. tell the team to bear down.\\" John Salmon died on October 18, 1926. Following Salmon's funeral, McKale reportedly told the team what he had said in a Las Cruces, N.M., locker room before a football game against the Aggies of New Mexico State, and U of A won a hard-fought victory, 7-0. The following year, the University of Arizona student body adopted the slogan for use with all Wildcat athletic teams. That year, the Chain Gang, a junior honorary organization at the UA, held a dance in the newly constructed university gymnasium to raise funds to paint the slogan on the roof of the building at coordinates . The words are still featured on the roof of the gymnasium, now known as Bear Down Gym. In 1939, the Arizona state legislature issued a decree that \\"Bear Down\\" would be the exclusive property of The University of Arizona. Research at the State Archives does not find any record of such a decree: :archives@azlibrary.gov : I'm not sure where those citations originated, but I don't believe we have official documentation here at the state archives giving exclusive rights to the University for the phrase \\"Bear Down.\\" I was initially a bit dubious about this citation due to the verbiage referring to a \\"decree\\" issued by the Arizona Legislature - the legislature does not actually issue decrees, so I checked some alternate sources. I had one of our agency's law librarian check the session laws to see if this was put through as a bill - no luck. I checked Memorials and Resolutions, which is probably the closest we would have to something called a decree, and found nothing. Finally, I even checked in the Governor's records to see if this was issued as a proclamation, and found nothing. :Doing a bit of googling, I see that this \\"decree\\" is mentioned several times, but no one provides any substantive evidence of such a thing existing. My suggestion to you is that you may want to spend a bit of time searching through newspapers to see if you can find information about an event happening in 1939 recognizing the phrase. Could it have, rather than the legislature, been the Arizona Board of Regents? Or a different governing body? Might it be a different kind of document altogether? Unfortunately, we do not have the staff to do this kind of research, but you are welcome to visit us to look at reels of microfilm or borrow them through Interlibrary Loan. You may also want to contact the University of Arizona Special Collections to see if they can clarify this reference, if you haven't already. November 26, 2013 Arizona History and Archives Division, Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records, 1901 W Madison St., Phoenix, AZ 85009 http://www.azlibrary.gov/archives/ In 2013 Arizona's football stadium installed a new artificial surface with \\"Bear Down\\" etched in the center of the field and running from end to end between the 15-yard lines. Previously the phrase was painted on the field in two separate areas. Fight song The song \\"Bear Down, Arizona!\\" was written by Jack K. Lee, the university's future band director, in 1952. As related by Lee himself in later years, Lee was one of several applicants for the position of Director of Bands at the U of A. During his visit to the university for his job interview, he was given a tour of the campus and was told the story of the Bear Down slogan. As his flight home to Michigan left from the Tucson airport, it banked over the university campus, and Lee saw the slogan painted on the roof of the university gymnasium. He was struck by inspiration, took an airsickness bag from the seat pocket of the plane and wrote, in pencil, the lyrics to \\"Bear Down, Arizona.\\" Lee was offered the band director job. The song was publicly performed in September 1952 for the first time by U of A band at a pep rally in downtown Tucson. A replica of the original manuscript, created by Lee on a paper sack, is displayed in the Alumni Heritage Lounge on the main floor of the Student Union Memorial Center on the university campus. =Lyrics= Although the following coda is not actually a part of the song, the band (along with the crowd) sometimes chants it immediately after they have played \\"Bear Down\\". Part of the chant originates in a 1988 rap song about the Arizona basketball team, written by Harvey Mason, Jr. The verse of the song is rarely sung. At most athletic events, the chorus is sung twice, followed by the chant.

He was a key figure in the mobilization of American support for the founding of the State of Israel. Abba Hillel Silver website Biography Born Abraham Silver in Naumiestis, in the Suwa≈Çki Governorate of Congress Poland, a part of the Russian Empire (present-day Lithuania), son and grandson of Orthodox rabbis, he was brought to the US at the age of nine. A Zionist from his youth, he made his first speech at a Zionist meeting at age fourteen. Educated in the public schools and after- school Jewish schools of New York City's Lower East Side, he left after high school to attend the Hebrew Union College (HUC) and the University of Cincinnati.Mark A. Raider, Jonathan D. Sarna, Ronald W. Zweig, Abba Hillel Silver and American Zionism (1997) Routledge, p 88 After graduation as valedictorian of his HUC class and ordination in 1915‚Äîand now known as Abba Hillel Silver‚Äîhe served as rabbi of a small congregation, Leshem Shomayim, now Temple Shalom (Wheeling, West Virginia). In 1917, at age twenty-four, he became rabbi of The Temple - Tifereth Israel in Cleveland, Ohio, one of the nation's largest and best-known Reform congregations, where he served for forty-six years. Abba Hillel Silver was an early champion of rights for labor, for worker's compensation and civil liberties, though his highest priorities were to advance respect for and support of Zionism. He canvassed first Reform Jewish congregations, then American Jewry, then the American public and politicians, and last the international community, the United Nations in particular. Silver was a keynote speaker in the Allied Jewish Campaign to raise funds jointly for Zionist projects in Palestine and for European Jewry.Moses Rischin, The Jews of North America (1987) Wayne State University Press, p 220. At a meeting of the American Zionist Emergency Council in May 1944, Silver argued that ‚Äòour overemphasizing the refugee issue has enabled our opponents to state that that, if it is rescue you are concerned about, why don‚Äôt you concentrate on that and put the politics aside‚Ä¶It is possible for the Diaspora to undermine the Jewish state, because the urgency of the rescue issue could lead the world to accept a temporary solution‚Ä¶We should place increased emphasis on fundamental Zionist ideology‚Äô.Novick, Peter. The Holocaust and Collective Memory: The American Experience. London: Bloomsbury, 2001, p.43 Silver was one of the chief Zionist spokesmen appearing before the United Nations in the Palestine hearings of 2 October 1947 in what the Israeli government says was the future nation's acceptance speech,Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Highlights of Main Events 1947-1974 two weeks before Moshe Shertok made the case for Israel on 17 October 1947.Mr. Moshe Shertok, as head of Political Department of the Jewish Agency, statement to Ad Hoc Committee on Palestine. Silver expressed reservations about the UN partition plan. A practical man, Silver did ultimately accept partition of Palestine as the best means to rapidly create a homeland for the Jewish people. Abba Hillel Silver was a leading proponent of Zionism in America and met with President Truman several times to discuss his views until his uncompromising manner caused friction with the White House, leading to estrangement from the Truman White House,Michelle Mart (2006) Eye on Israel: how America came to view the Jewish state as an ally, SUNY Press, p 127. including Truman's appearance on national television to announce the formation of the State of Israel. The story of his pounding on Harry Truman's desk at the White House, however, after much research by Rafael Medoff, has been shown to be untrue. By mobilizing Jewish and non-Jewish support and through a relationship with the Republican party that resulted in 1948 in a pro-Israel plank in their platform, Silver left Truman no choice but to support Israel and recognize it immediately after it declared its independence. A nationally-known orator and author of many scholarly works, including important studies of the history of Jewish- Christian relations, Silver also served as head of many Jewish and Zionist organizations. He died on November 28, 1963, and was interred at Mayfield Cemetery in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

A remake of the 1958 film of the same name, it stars Shawnee Smith, Kevin Dillon, Donovan Leitch, Jeffrey DeMunn, Paul McCrane, Art LaFleur, Robert Axelrod, Joe Seneca, and Del Close. The plot follows an acidic, amoeba-like organism that crashes down to Earth from a meteorite, which devours and dissolves anything in its path as it grows. Filmed in Abbeville, Louisiana, The Blob was theatrically released in August 1988 by Tri-Star Pictures and was a box office bomb, grossing $8.2 million against its budget of approximately $10 million. Though it received a mixed response from critics, the film has accrued a cult following in the years since its release. Plot A meteorite crashes near Arborville, California. An elderly transient discovers, within the sphere, a massive slime mold-like substance that adheres to his hand. Three high school students, Brian, Meg and Paul, take him to a hospital. After Brian leaves, Paul witnesses the lower half of the transient melting from exposure to the Blob. As he calls for help, the Blob drops on top of him. Meg walks in to see Paul being consumed by the growing Blob. While she tries freeing him, his arm dissolves off, Meg is thrown against a wall and knocked unconscious, the Blob fully dissolves Paul, and the Blob oozes out of the hospital, where it devours Scott, Paul's friend and his date Vicki nearby. After Brian and Meg have unsatisfactory encounters with the police, they meet at a diner where Meg tells Brian about the Blob. Brian's disbelief is shattered when a diner worker is violently pulled through a sink drain by the Blob. It pursues them to the diner's walk-in freezer, but the Blob retreats after entering the freezer. After consuming Sheriff Geller and the diner's owner Fran Hewitt, the Blob reenters the sewers. Meg and Brian return to the police station, where the dispatcher tells them Deputy Briggs is near the meteor-landing site. They discover a military operation led by a scientist, Dr. Meddows, who orders the town and the two teens quarantined. While Brian escapes, Meg is taken to town where she learns her younger brother, Kevin, is missing. Meg learns he and his friend, Eddie, sneaked into the movie theater. The Blob enters the theater though the ventilation shaft, where it begins to feed on the staff and audience. Meg arrives as the audience flees the theater, rescuing Eddie and Kevin, but the trio are cornered in an alleyway when trying to escape and are forced to flee into the sewers. Brian eavesdrops on Meddows and Jennings talking and learns that the Blob is a biological warfare experiment created during the Cold War, launched into space because it was so dangerous. Learning that the Blob has entered the sewers, Meddows decide to trap it there, even if that means allowing Meg, Kevin, and Eddie to die. Brian is discovered listening in and evades military personnel by driving his motorcycle into the sewers. Meanwhile, Meg and Kevin flee from the Blob when it emerges and consumes Eddie. Kevin escapes by scaling a pipe to the surface, and Meg is saved by Brian. They escape the sewers to the town square, where Brian confronts Meddows in front of the townsfolk and Briggs. When Brian begins to win over Briggs with his arguments, Meddows attempts to shoot Brian, but is killed by the Blob when it drags him into the sewer. The military unload their weapons in the sewer entrance in hopes of killing the creature, but only succeed in making it enraged. The Blob suddenly bursts out of the sewer, rampaging down the street and feasting on the town's population. The town's Reverend Meeker proclaims the scene to be the prophesied end of the world, after which a failed flamethrower attack on the Blob sets him ablaze. Meg saves him with a fire extinguisher, and in the process blasts the Blob with it. When the monster backs off, she realizes that the Blob cannot tolerate cold. The survivors retreat to the town hall and hold the Blob off with furniture-barricades and fire extinguishers, but it is a losing battle; the Blob engulfs half the building and devours Briggs. Brian goes to the town's garage and gets a snow maker truck that has canisters of liquid nitrogen attached. Brian shoots snow at the creature, angering it, and it leaves its attack on the town hall and rams the truck, knocking the canisters onto the street. As the Blob attempts to break into the overturned truck with Brian inside, Meg lures it away from him toward the canisters, which she has rigged with an explosive charge taken from a dying soldier. She tries getting clear, but snags her foot between two pieces of metal, trapping her. Brian frees himself from the truck and rescues Meg. The Blob is about to overrun them when the charge goes off, blowing up the canisters and covering the Blob in liquid nitrogen. The creature is flash-frozen into a mass of crystallized pieces. Moss Woodley has its remains stored in the town ice house. Later, at a tent-meeting church service in a field, Meeker, disfigured by his burns, preaches a doomsday sermon resembling the Blob's attack. He has a still-living piece of the Blob, trapped inside a glass jar, and hints at planning to unleash it back upon the world when God gives him a sign.

The threat of the original film was an alien entity from outer space. The remake differs in making the threat a biological weapon, created by a secret government agency. The Blob is closely followed by soldiers and scientists in protective suits. The change reflects the mentality of a more cynical era.O'Neill (2007), unnumbered pages The sinister government agents are opposed by rebellious teenager Brian Flagg (Kevin Dillon). His depiction as a rebel and a \\"tough guy punk\\" includes wearing a leather jacket, sporting long hair, riding a motorcycle, and distrusting authority figures.Donovan (2011), p. 129 Production Screenwriter Frank Darabont first met director Chuck Russell in 1981, while working as a production assistant on the film Hell Night.Emery, Robert J. The Directors - Take Four. Allworth Communications, Inc., 2003, p. 201. Before working together on The Blob, the two also collaborated on the script for A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. Actor Del Close had been scheduled to direct a \\"mock opera\\" about Ronald Reagan at New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts during the filming of The Blob;Johnson, Kim \\"Howard.\\" The Funniest One in the Room: The Lives and Legends of Del Close. Chicago Review Press, 2008, p. 300. however, the production was cancelled and he was unexpectedly available to audition for The Blob.Johnson, p. 303. Production began on January 11, with the cast and crew of approximately 150 staying at a Travelodge in Abbeville, Louisiana.Johnson, p. 304-305. Due to the large amount of night shooting, the cast often slept during the day.Johnson, p. 305. On their off days, they watched videos at the hotel and ate crawfish, a popular item of local cuisine. Special effects in the film were handled by Tony Gardner.Timpone, Anthony. \\"Men, makeup, and monsters.\\" Macmillan, 1996, p. 187. Gardner was originally supposed to provide only a few small effects, with special effects artist Lyle Conway originally being in charge of the effects. However, after personnel changes he ended up running a crew of 33, including artist Chet Zar and mechanical effects designer Bill Sturgeon. In creating the titular Blob creature, the special effects team used silk injected with Methacil, a food additive, creating what the team described as a \\"Blob Quilt\\". For the few minutes of screen time, near the end of the film, where Reverend Meeker has a scene with fresh burns and another with healed burns, actor Del Close required five-and-a-half hours of makeup preparation for fresh burns, and seven-and-a- half hours for healed burns. Release The Blob opened in New York and Los Angeles, California on August 5, 1988. It grossed $8,247,943 at the box office. An article in the 27 May 1989 Screen International reported that the film‚Äôs domestic box-office gross was ‚Äúdisastrous.‚Äù =Critical response= On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Blob holds a 62% approval rating based on 26 critic reviews, with an average rating of 5.82/10. The consensus reads: \\"The Blob can't replicate the B-movie charms of the original, though its fast pace and gory thrills pack enough of a punch to make it a worthwhile update.\\" Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film two out of a possible four stars, calling it a \\"Needless, if undeniably gooey, remake\\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"is more violent than the original, more spectacular, more cynical, more patently commercial and more attentive to detail\\", but noted that \\"for reasons having nothing to do with merit, the 1958 film earned a place in history. The remake, enterprising as it is, won't do the same\\". Retrospective reviews have typically been more favorable. Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine wrote that the film \\"improves on the original cult classic with inventive, gracefully repulsive special effects and an agreeable post-Watergate anti-authoritarian message\\". HorrorNews.net gave the film a score of \\"4 1/2 out of 5\\", writing that \\"the twists that this film takes that differ from the original make it all the more terrifying and oddly enough... plausible\\". TV Guide gave the film 3/5 stars, calling it \\"a fine, multilayered effort from a director who understands the genre and appreciates its traditions\\". Discussing the poor critical and commercial performance of the film in an interview with Starlog, director Chuck Russell stated, \\"Maybe it was a mistake to do a remake of The Blob with a sense of humor. I thought that would be an entertaining interpretation. ‚Ä¶ Unfortunately, it was released late in a very hectic summer filled with big films and it didn't have a particularly good ad campaign.\\" =Home media= The film was released on DVD in the United States by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on September 11, 2001. Sony again released The Blob in September 2013 as part of its \\"The 4-Movie Horror Unleashed Collection\\", along with Fright Night, Christine and The Seventh Sign. The film was first released on Blu-ray in the United States by Twilight Time on October 14, 2014. On October 29, 2019, Shout!

She was the younger surviving daughter of Philip II of Spain and Elisabeth of Valois. Early life Catalina Micaela was the daughter of Philip II, ruler of the vast Spanish Empire, and his third wife, the French princess Elisabeth of Valois. She was described as beautiful, intelligent, arrogant and well aware of her high social status. Though her father did not attend her christening and was not as rejoiced at the birth of a daughter as he had been with her elder sister, Isabella Clara Eugenia, she had a good relationship with him. Philip and Catherine Michelle exchanged letters throughout her life. She had a close relationship with her sister. They were raised together under the care of Margarita de Cardona, the lady-in- waiting of their stepmother, Anna of Austria, and some of her mother's own ladies such as Claude de Vineulx. Her Grandmother Catherine de Medici got regular reports of Catherine and her sister and she had their portraits sent and put in her book of hours. She was probably named after Catherine de Medici. Catherine and her elder sister Isabella Duchess consort of Savoy Duke Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy suggested that he should marry Catalina Micaela as a way of gaining Spanish support for his plans to expand Savoy on the coast of the then weakened France. The wedding took place in Zaragoza on 11 March 1585 and the couple made their entrance to Turin in Savoy 10 August 1585. Catalina Micaela was initially unpopular because of her arrogance and attempts to introduce Spanish pomp, ceremony and way of dress to the court in Turin. However, she soon gained respect because of her political and diplomatic skill, which she used to defend the autonomy of Savoy against Spain. She refused the Spanish offer to install a Spanish garrison in Turin from Milan with the excuse of giving her a life guard. She is reported to have had great influence on Charles Emmanuel I and to have reformed him for the better. She also served as regent several times during the absence of the duke on military campaigns, such as during the Lyon campaign in 1594. Catherine Michelle also benefited cultural life in Savoy, founded many new buildings including an art gallery. Due to her influence, her sons were educated in Spain. Catherine as Duchess of Savoy Catalina Micaela died near the end of 1597; she had miscarried earlier that year. Her father died the following year. Children In 1584, she married Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy. This marriage produced ten children: *Philip Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont (1586‚Äì1605) * Victor Amadeus (1587‚Äì1637) * Emanuel Filibert of Savoy, (1588‚Äì1624), Spanish Viceroy of Sicily, (1622‚Äì24). * Margaret (1589‚Äì1655), married Francesco IV Gonzaga of Mantua * Isabella (1591‚Äì1626), married Alfonso III d'Este, duke of Modena * Maurice, a cardinal (1593‚Äì1657) *Maria Apollonia, a nun in Rome (1594‚Äì1656) *Francesca Caterina, a nun in Biella (1595‚Äì1640) *Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano (1596‚Äì1656), Founder of the House of Savoy-Carignano and ancestor of the erstwhile ruling Family of Italy *Giovanna (born 1597) References Sources  Category:1567 births Category:1597 deaths Category:16th-century House of Habsburg Category:Nobility from Madrid Category:Austrian princesses Category:Spanish infantas Category:Duchesses of Savoy Category:Deaths in childbirth Category:Portuguese infantas Category:16th-century women rulers ","title":"Catalina Micaela of Spain"},{"id":"2521830","text":"Doug Peacock is an American naturalist, outdoorsman, and author. He is best known for his book Grizzly Years: In Search of the American Wilderness, a memoir of his experiences in the 1970s and 1980s, much of which was spent alone in the wilderness of the western United States observing grizzly bears.  Biography  Doug Peacock was born in Alma, Michigan, and attended the University of Michigan. He served as a Green Beret combat medic during the Vietnam War and, upon returning, felt so disillusioned with human society that he sought solace in the beauty of the wilderness. Although he had little scientific background, his passion for and firsthand experience with bears soon brought him recognition as an expert in grizzly behavior. He was a friend of author Edward Abbey, and served as the model for the character George Hayduke in Abbey's famous novel The Monkey Wrench Gang. Peacock's 2005 book, Walking it Off: A Veteran's Chronicle of War And Wilderness, continues his memoirs, in the wake of Ed Abbey's death. He ventured into the southwest deserts to walk off the scars left by his friend's death. In the process, he revisited Vietnam in flashbacks, remembering the cantankerous friendship with Abbey, and almost died in his journey to recover from \\"this terminal disease called life\\" in Nepal with his friends Alan Burgess and Dennis Sizemore. Peacock is also friend of American author Rick Bass. In Bass's book The Lost Grizzlies: A Search for Survivors in the Wilderness of Colorado Peacock is a key element in the search for evidence that there are still grizzlies in the San Juan Mountains. Peacock was a 2007 Guggenheim fellow, and currently lives in Montana with his wife Andrea, author of Libby, Montana: Asbestos and the Deadly Silence of an American Corporation. Peacock speaks in schools about wilderness, conservation, and the need to preserve our wilderness. Doug is the chairman of the board of trustees for Round River Conservation Studies.

The tail rotor's position and distance from the helicopter's center of mass allow it to develop enough thrust leverage to counter the reactional torque exerted on the fuselage by the spinning of the main rotor. Without the tail rotor or other anti-torque mechansims (e.g. NOTAR), the helicopter would be constantly spinning in the opposite direction of the main rotor when flying. Tail rotors are simpler than main rotors since they require only collective changes in pitch to vary thrust. The pitch of the tail rotor blades is adjustable by the pilot via the anti-torque pedals, which also provide directional control by allowing the pilot to rotate the helicopter around its vertical axis. Its drive system consists of a shaft powered from the main transmission and a gearbox mounted at the end of the tail boom. The drive shaft may consist of one long shaft or a series of shorter shafts connected at both ends with flexible couplings, that allow the drive shaft to flex with the tail boom. The gearbox at the end of the tail boom provides an angled drive for the tail rotor and may also include gearing to adjust the output to the optimum rotational speed for the tail rotor, measured in rotations per minute (RPM). On larger helicopters with a tail pylon, intermediate gearboxes are used to transition the tail rotor drive shaft from along the tailboom to the top of the pylon. The tail rotor pylon may also serve as a vertical stabilizing airfoil, to alleviate the power requirement for the tail rotor in forward flight. The tail rotor pylon may also serve to provide limited antitorque within certain airspeed ranges, in the event that the tail rotor or its flight controls fail. About 10% of the engine power goes to the tail rotor.Dave Jackson. \\"Flight Dynamics - Definitions & Algorithms\\" UniCopter, 29 January 2013. Accessed: 19 November 2013. Design The tail rotor system rotates airfoils, small wings called blades, that vary in pitch in order to vary the amount of thrust they produce. The blades most often utilize a composite material construction, such as a core made of aluminum honeycomb or plasticized paper honeycomb, covered in a skin made of aluminum or carbon fiber composite. Tail rotor blades are made with both symmetrical and asymmetrical airfoil construction. The pitch change mechanism uses a cable control system or control tubes that run from the anti-torque pedals in the cockpit to a mechanism mounted on the tail rotor gearbox. In larger helicopters, the pitch change mechanism is augmented by a hydraulic power control servo. In the event of a hydraulic system failure, the mechanical system is still able to control the tail rotor pitch, though the control resistance felt by the pilot will be considerably greater. The tail rotor is powered by the helicopter's main power plant, and rotates at a speed proportional to that of the main rotor. In both piston and turbine powered helicopters, the main rotor and the tail rotor are mechanically connected through a freewheeling clutch system, which allows the rotors to keep turning in the event of an engine failure by mechanically de-linking the engine from both the main and tail rotors. During autorotation, the momentum of the main rotor continues to power the tail rotor and allow directional control. To optimize its function for forward flight, the blades of a tail rotor have no twist to reduce the profile drag, because the tail rotor is mounted with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction of flight. Reliability and safety Many tail rotors are protected from ground strikes by a skid plate or by a steel guard, such as on this Bell 47. The tail rotor and the systems that provide power and control for it are considered critically important for safe flight. As with many parts on a helicopter, the tail rotor, its transmission, and many parts in the drive system are often life-limited, meaning they are arbitrarily replaced after a certain number of flight hours, regardless of condition. Between replacements, parts are subject to frequent inspections utilizing visual as well as chemical methods such as fluorescent penetrant inspection to detect weak parts before they fail completely. Despite the emphasis on reducing failures, they do occasionally occur, most often due to hard landings and tailstrikes, or foreign object damage. Though the tail rotor is considered essential for safe flight, the loss of tail rotor function does not necessarily result in a fatal crash. In cases where the failure occurs due to contact with the ground, the aircraft is already at low altitude and the pilot may be able to reduce collective and land the helicopter before it spins completely out of control. Should the tail rotor fail randomly during cruise flight, forward momentum will often provide some directional stability, as many helicopters are equipped with a vertical stabilizer. The pilot would then be forced to autorotate and make an emergency landing with significant forward airspeed, which is known as a running landing or roll-on landing. The tail rotor itself is a hazard to ground crews working near a running helicopter. For this reason, tail rotors are painted with stripes of alternating colors to increase their visibility to ground crews while the tail rotor is spinning. Alternative technologies Eurocopter EC 135, with a fantail assembly tail rotor. There have been three major alternative designs which attempt to solve the shortcomings of the tail rotor system. The first is to use an enclosured ducted fan rather than openly exposed rotor blades. This design is referred to as a fantail or \\"Fenestron\\", a trademark of Eurocopter (now Airbus Helicopters) for its Dauphin-series utility helicopters. The enclosure around the fan reduces tip vortex losses, shields the blades from foreign object damage, protects ground crews from potential hazard of an openly spinning rotor, and produces a much quieter and less turbulent noise profile than a conventional tail rotor. The ducted fan uses more numerous shorter blades, but otherwise works in very similar thrust principles to a conventional tail rotor. McDonnell Douglas developed the NOTAR (NO TAil Rotor) system, which eliminates having any rotating parts out in the open. The NOTAR system uses a variable pitch ducted fan driven by the helicopter's powerplant, but the ducted fan is mounted inside the fuselage ahead of the tail boom, and the exhaust passes through the tail boom to the end, where it is expelled out one side. This creates a boundary layer which causes the downwash from the main rotor to hug the tail boom according to the CoandƒÉ effect. This creates a force which cancels out the main rotor torque and provides directional control. The advantages of the system are similar to the Fenestron system discussed above. There are at least four ways to eliminate the necessity of a tail rotor altogether : * Tandem/transverse rotors: to use two non-overlapping main rotors which rotate in opposite directions, so that the torque created by one rotor cancels out the torque created by the other. Such configurations are commonly seen on heavy-lift helicopters like the tandem-rotored CH-47 Chinook. :The tiltrotor design, as seen on the V-22 Osprey, is a variation of the transverse rotor design, where the rotors are installed in tiltable nacelles at the ends of fixed wings. This allows the rotors to serve instead as propellers when flying forward at full speed. * Coaxial. Other designs such as the Kamov Ka-50 and Sikorsky X2 use coaxial counter-rotating main rotors, which means that both rotors spin around the same axis but in opposite directions. The complexity of any dual main rotor system almost invariably requires the addition of a fly-by-wire flight control system, which increases costs drastically. * Intermeshing rotors also turn in opposite directions, but the blades rotate into the gaps between the opposing blades so the rotors can intersect each other's path without colliding. Invented by Anton Flettner and used in Flettner Fl 282, Kaman HH-43 Huskie, and Kaman K-MAX. * Tip jet. Another way to eliminate the effect of torque created by the rotorwing is by mounting the engine on the tips of the rotorwing rather than inside the helicopter itself; this is called a tip jet. One example of a helicopter using such a system is the NHI H-3 Kolibrie, which had a ramjet on each of the two wingtips, and an auxiliary power unit to spin up the rotor before starting the ramjets. Another example would be the Fairey Rotodyne. Also, unpowered rotors used in autogyro, gyrodyne, and derived concepts do not need a tail rotor either, although nearly all models that utilize this concept of propulsion do need a second propeller in one way or another to drive them forward to begin with.

Files put in quarantine were then no longer capable of infecting their hosting system. Development and release In December, 1988, shortly after the Morris Worm, work started on Quarantine, an anti-malware and file reliability product. Released in April, 1989, Quarantine was the first such product to use file signature instead of viral signature methods. The original Quarantine used Hunt's B-tree database of files with both their CRC16 and CRC-CCITT signatures. Doubling the signatures rendered useless, or at least immoderately difficult, attacks based on CRC invariant modifications. Release 2, April 1990, used a CRC-32 signature and one based on CRC-32 but with a few bits in each word shuffled. The subsequent MS-AV from Microsoft, designed by Check Point, apparently relied on only an eight bit checksum‚Äîat least out of a few thousand files there were hundreds with identical signatures. Functionality Quarantine * allowed suspect files to be ** Deleted ** Moved to a quarantine area ** Flagged in a report * Standard executable were scanned, or one could use up to twenty file matching patterns * Twenty exclusion patterns were available * Twenty directory paths could be included, or twenty excluded The 1990 version also allowed * Background processing * Checking of executables and libraries as a file is opened ** Timing of checks, e.g. if one opened a word file, WORD and all its libraries could be checked: ** Immediately ** Every half an hour ** Once a day or every ten days, etc. Quarantine allowed system managers to track all modifications of a selected files or file structures, hence Quarantine users also got early warnings of failing disks or disk interface cards. Achievements In 1990 Quarantine received the LAN Magazine, Best of Year, Security award. In that year \\"Quarantine\\" was reportedly responsible for finding the first stealth virus at the University of Toronto, when all pattern matching virus detectors had failed. Legacy The efforts and expenses to convert Quarantine to other platforms went unrewarded as Tripwire's 1991 copy of Quarantine for *nix was better funded and publicized than OnDisk could afford to match. Later efforts include modularized reliability and intrusion approaches that include either SHA-1 or MD5 signatures, or both if you like. Quarantine stopped shipping in 1994.

This family was formerly believed to be the sole living representative of the superfamily Siricoidea, a group well represented in Paleogene and Mesozoic times, but the family Anaxyelidae has been linked to this group as well. Siricidae has two sub families, Siricinae and Tremecinae. Siricinae infest needle-leaved trees and Tremecinae infest broad-leaved trees. There are ten living genera placed in the family, and an additional three genera described from fossils. The last tergite of the abdomen has a strong, projecting spike, thus giving the group its common name (the ovipositor is typically longer and also projects posteriorly, but it is not the source of the name). A typical adult horntail is brown, blue, or black with yellow parts, and may often reach up to long. The pigeon horntail (Tremex columba) can grow up to long (not counting the ovipositor), among the longest of all Hymenoptera. Female horntails lay their eggs in trees. The larvae bore into the wood and live in the tree for up to two years, possibly more. They typically migrate to just under the bark before pupation. The spiral groove on the ovipositor is visible on the photograph but not easily to the naked eye. Description Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio) from New Zealand, on Pinus radiata Giant horntail (Urocerus gigas) The smaller horntail (Sirex noctilio) is only about half the size of the greater horntail, with pale brown legs and the rest metallic blue-black. It pierces the bark of pines to lay eggs. The smaller horntail ovipositor is very similar to the greater horntail, which is described as: \\"as stiff and straight as a needle, polished black, with slight notches in the pointed half. It is hinged, to permit of its being turned at right angles to the body. . . the female selects a tree that is not too healthy, and settles on the bole; then, turning down her boring instrument on its hinge, she drives it through the thick bark to the solid wood.\\" When we consider the small size of the insect, it seems remarkable that she should have muscular power sufficient to force that slight auger through such resistant material; but that the boring imposes no strain upon her is shown by the fact that she may make several experimental punctures without an egg passing; apparently the wood reached is not quite suited for her purpose, so she tries another spot. Often her operations are upon a tree that has been felled for the builder's use; and by this means the new generation finds its way at times into our homes. Having satisfied herself that at last she has found the proper conditions under which a larva could exist, she passes an egg into the wood; then she repeats the process at some other spot on the same tree or log.Bees, Wasps, Ants and Allied Insects of the British Isles, Edward Step (1932) Members of 3 genera of horntail Siricidae attack dying or recently killed balsam fir and spruce (Rose and Lindquist 1985).Rose, A.H.; Lindquist, O.H. 1985. Insects of eastern spruces, fir and, hemlock, revised edition. Gov't Can., Can. For. Serv., Ottawa, For. Tech. Rep. 23. 159 p. (cited in Coates et al. 1994, cited orig ed 1977) The common name derives from the stout, spine-like structure at the end of the adult's body, which is used to pierce the host's bark to allow the eggs to be inserted into the wood. Populations increase rapidly only where brood material is abundant. The life cycle usually requires 2 years, and the adults are usually in flight from late July to early September. Full-grown larvae may be up to 215 mm long. Wood- rotting fungi found in horntail tunnels cause very rapid deterioration of the wood and quickly reduce opportunities for salvage. =Growth of the egg= The right conditions having been found and an egg discharged through the boring instrument, from this in due course issues a six-legged, whitish larva, which sets to work with capable jaws on the solid wood, beginning the excavation of a long tunnel that will occupy several years before the larva is full-grown. That stage reached, it spins a silken cocoon, and changes into a pupa which has all its limbs of maturity formed and folded beside its body. Before making its cocoon, however, it takes the precautionary measure of advancing its tunnel close up to the inner bark, so that in its winged state it will have only to bite a way through this softer impediment to its liberty; not that it is now incapable of dealing with anything firmer. Like the caterpillar of the Goat-moth, it does not hesitate, if necessary, to make a way even through soft metal. There is a record of a Sirex-infested tree having been cut into rafters which were used in building a roof and covered with sheet-lead an eighth of an inch thick . One of the rafters contained a Sirex in either the larval or pupal stage; and when the adult insect sought its freedom, it found the way obstructed by the lead. It went right through, apparently finding lead not much more difficult to deal with than bark. It adds that an ichneumon wasp (Rhyssa persuasoria) lays parasitic grubs in Sirex, which kill them. Technological inspiration The female wood wasp lays eggs inside trees, and its methods of doing so have inspired scientists to come up with new and safer surgical probes that are said to be more efficient. The wood wasp ovipositor itself contains two interlocking valves. Each valve is covered with teeth that are backward-facing, with the teeth of one valve catching onto the wood to provide resistance, and the other valve moving forward and taking a slight step. The second valve then catches the wood to provide continued resistance as the first valve moves forward. Thus by quick oscillation, the valves alternate in providing resistance and moving forward, the process itself leads in the ovipositor drilling almost an inch into the sapwood with minimal force being applied. Buckling or breaking does not take place during the process. Researchers and scientists have been inspired by the ovipositor of the female wood wasp, and have created a prototype neurosurgical probe that works on the same principle. Its needle is made of silicon, with two oscillating valves that are covered with micron-sized teeth that, too, face backward This enables it to penetrate deep into the brain causing little damage. According to the New Scientist magazine, \\"Unlike existing rigid surgical probes, the device will be flexible enough to move along the safest possible route, bypassing high-risk area of the brain during surgery, for example\\". A probe like this would considerably reduce the number of incisions necessary to access areas that are difficult to reach.

Biography Rui (or Ruy) de Pina was a native of Guarda. He acted as secretary of the embassy sent by King John II of Portugal to Castile in the spring of 1482, and in the following September returned there as sole envoy. He was present at the execution of Fernando II, Duke of Braganza at √âvora in 1483, and in 1484 went to Rome as secretary of an embassy to Pope Innocent VIII. Upon his return, the king charged him to write a history of his reign and gave him a pension for his support. Following the return of Christopher Columbus from his first voyage in 1493, Pina was one of the commissaries dispatched to Barcelona by John II to negotiate with the Catholic sovereigns respecting the limits of their respective jurisdictions, that would culminate in the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. In September 1495 he attested the will of John II in his capacity as a notary public, and on 25 October of the same year he was present at his master's death at Alvor and opened and read his testament. The new king, Manuel I, confirmed his pension and in 1497 appointed him high chronicler (cronista-mor) of the kingdom, keeper of the archives of Torre do Tombo and royal librarian, with a suitable salary. By 1504 Rui de Pina had completed his chronicles of Afonso V and John II. In 1521, King John III charged him with a history of his father, Manuel, and at his death Pina had carried it down to the capture of Azamor, as we know from Dami√£o de G√≥is, who used it in preparing his own chronicle of that monarch. Chronicles It is probable that the chronicles of the early kings of Portugal from Sancho I to Afonso IV which were published under Pina's name in the 18th century were written by Fern√£o Lopes and edited by Pina, while that of King Duarte seems to have been the joint production of Lopes and Gomes Eanes de Zurara, with Pina again as the editor only. Pina was a favorite of fortune during his life, for, apart from royal benefactions, he received presents from public men who wished to figure well in his books, and after his death he obtained the credit for work that was not his. His authority as an historian is considerable, and his frankness is said to have provoked remark from contemporaries. Pinas' chronicle of King AFonso IV was first published in Lisbon in 1853; those of King Duarte and King Afonso V in vol. i of the Colec√ß√£o de livros in√©ditos da historia portugueza (Lisbon, 1790), and his chronicle of John II in vol. ii of the same collection (Lisbon, 1792). Ruy de Pina was immensely influential in his day. Afonso de Albuquerque, governor of Portuguese India, is said to have sent a set of jewels to Ruy de Pina, in an effort to ensure that he would not be overlooked in his chronicles.Alexandre Herculano, in preface to Ruy de Pina Chronica d'el-rei Dom Duarte, 1901, Lisbon: Escriptoria, p.10 The introduction to the chronicle of King Duarte contains the fullest account of Pinas' life.

A universal code is asymptotically optimal if the ratio between actual and optimal expected lengths is bounded by a function of the information entropy of the code that, in addition to being bounded, approaches 1 as entropy approaches infinity. In general, most prefix codes for integers assign longer codewords to larger integers. Such a code can be used to efficiently communicate a message drawn from a set of possible messages, by simply ordering the set of messages by decreasing probability and then sending the index of the intended message. Universal codes are generally not used for precisely known probability distributions, and no universal code is known to be optimal for any distribution used in practice. A universal code should not be confused with universal source coding, in which the data compression method need not be a fixed prefix code and the ratio between actual and optimal expected lengths must approach one. However, note that an asymptotically optimal universal code can be used on independent identically- distributed sources, by using increasingly large blocks, as a method of universal source coding.  Universal and non-universal codes  These are some universal codes for integers; an asterisk (*) indicates a code that can be trivially restated in lexicographical order, while a double dagger (‚Ä°) indicates a code that is asymptotically optimal: * Elias gamma coding * * Elias delta coding * ‚Ä° * Elias omega coding * ‚Ä° * Exp-Golomb coding *, which has Elias gamma coding as a special case. (Used in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC) * Fibonacci coding * Levenshtein coding * ‚Ä°, the original universal coding technique * Byte coding where a special bit pattern (with at least two bits) is used to mark the end of the code ‚Äî for example, if an integer is encoded as a sequence of nibbles representing digits in base 15 instead of the more natural base 16, then the highest nibble value (i.e., a sequence of four ones in binary) can be used to indicate the end of the integer. * Variable-length quantity These are non-universal ones: * Unary coding, which is used in Elias codes * Rice coding, which is used in the FLAC audio codec and which has unary coding as a special case * Golomb coding, which has Rice coding and unary coding as special cases. Their nonuniversality can be observed by noticing that, if any of these are used to code the Gauss‚ÄìKuzmin distribution or the Zeta distribution with parameter s=2, expected codeword length is infinite. For example, using unary coding on the Zeta distribution yields an expected length of : E(l) = \\\\frac{6}{\\\\pi^2} \\\\sum_{l=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{l} = \\\\infty . \\\\, On the other hand, using the universal Elias gamma coding for the Gauss‚ÄìKuzmin distribution results in an expected codeword length (about 3.51 bits) near entropy (about 3.43 bits). Relationship to practical compression Huffman coding and arithmetic coding (when they can be used) give at least as good, and often better compression than any universal code. However, universal codes are useful when Huffman coding cannot be used ‚Äî for example, when one does not know the exact probability of each message, but only knows the rankings of their probabilities. Universal codes are also useful when Huffman codes are inconvenient. For example, when the transmitter but not the receiver knows the probabilities of the messages, Huffman coding requires an overhead of transmitting those probabilities to the receiver. Using a universal code does not have that overhead. Each universal code, like each other self-delimiting (prefix) binary code, has its own \\"implied probability distribution\\" given by p(i)=2‚àíl(i) where l(i) is the length of the ith codeword and p(i) is the corresponding symbol's probability. If the actual message probabilities are q(i) and Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence DKL(qp) is minimized by the code with l(i), then the optimal Huffman code for that set of messages will be equivalent to that code. Likewise, how close a code is to optimal can be measured by this divergence. Since universal codes are simpler and faster to encode and decode than Huffman codes (which is, in turn, simpler and faster than arithmetic encoding), the universal code would be preferable in cases where DKL(qp) is sufficiently small. For any geometric distribution (an exponential distribution on integers), a Golomb code is optimal. With universal codes, the implicit distribution is approximately a power law such as 1/n^2 (more precisely, a Zipf distribution). For the Fibonacci code, the implicit distribution is approximately 1/n^q, with :q = 1/\\\\log_2(\\\\varphi) \\\\simeq 1.44, where \\\\varphi is the golden ratio. For the ternary comma code (i.e., encoding in base 3, represented with 2 bits per symbol), the implicit distribution is a power law with q=1+\\\\log_3(4/3) \\\\simeq 1.26. These distributions thus have near-optimal codes with their respective power laws. External links * Data Compression, by Debra A. Lelewer and Daniel S.

Career  Working as a schoolteacher in Barnaul, Radlov became interested in the native peoples of Siberia and published his ethnographic findings in the influential monograph From Siberia (1884). From 1866 to 1907, he translated and released a number of monuments of Turkic folklore. Most importantly, he was the first to publish the Orhon inscriptions. Four volumes of his comparative dictionary of Turkic languages followed in 1893 to 1911. Radlov helped establish the Russian Museum of Ethnography and was in charge of the Asiatic Museum in St. Petersburg from 1884 to 1894. Radlov assisted Grigory Potanin on his glossary of Salar language, Western Yugur language, and Eastern Yugur language in Potanin's 1893 Russian language book The Tangut-Tibetan Borderlands of China and Central Mongolia. During the Stalinist repressions of the late 1930s, the NKVD and state science apparatus accused the late (ethnically German) Radloff of Panturkism. A perceived connection with the long-dead Radloff was treated as incriminating evidence against Orientalists and Turkologists, some of whom - including Alexander Samoylovich, in 1938 - were executed.

Caused by human cytomegalovirus, it occurs predominantly in people whose immune system has been compromised, 15-40% of those with AIDS. There are different types of retinitis, such as retinitis pigmentosa (causes tunnel vision). Signs and symptoms The symptoms of cytomegalovirus retinitis have it usually starting in one eye (and also have the possibility of retinal detachment), presenting as: * Blurred vision * Blind spots * Specks in your vision Cause Leukemia Cytomegalovirus (a type of herpes virus) is what causes cytomegalovirus retinitis. Other types of herpes viruses include herpes simplex viruses and Epstein-Barr virus. Once an individual is infected with these viruses they stay in the body for life. What triggers the virus to reactivate are the following (though CMV can also be congenital). * Leukemia * AIDS * Immunosuppressive chemotherapy Mechanism Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV or CMV) is a DNA virus in the family Herpesviridae known for producing large cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions, CMV infects around 40% of the population worldwide. Those areas infected by cytomegalovirus have cells evolve to necrosis, though inflammation within the retina is not great. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments can occur following the development of holes in areas of healed retinitis (retina may be atrophic). Proliferative vitreoretinopathy has been observed in cases of retinal detachment. Diagnosis PCR result, Gel electrophoresis The diagnosis of CMV retinitis can be done via the following: * Ophthalmic screening frequency is based on CD4 count,(CD4 < 50 cells/mL, 0- 35% possibility of CMV retinitis) * BUN * CD8+ T-lymphocyte count * CMV DNA capture ( polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) * DNA PCR ( ocular fluids) * Viral load * Complete blood count Treatment Ganciclovir In terms of the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis, oral valganciclovir, intravenous ganciclovir, IV foscarnet, and IV cidofovir are all efficient in the treatment of this condition. Also intravitreal injections, an injection of medicine into the vitreous near the retina, of foscarnet in concomitance with oral valganciclovir can be used for treatment as well. Often individuals with CMV retinitis will need surgery for either retinal detachment or intravitreal instillation of ganciclovir. Retinal detachment occurs in up to 29% of affected eyes, repair being most effective with endolaser and silicone oil endotamponade. Intravitreal ganciclovir implant has the benefit of less systemic toxicity. An adverse effect of this is retinal detachment (and vitreous hemorrhage), also there is no systemic beneficial effect for cytomegalovirus organ disease.

Playing career Betts was a part of the hugely successful Wigan team of the 1980s, and 90's, his own medal haul including six Championships, seven Rugby League Challenge Cups, three Premierships, four John Player/Regal Trophies, and two Lancashire County Cup. He also received the Lance Todd Trophy (1991) and the coveted Man of Steel Award (1995). He featured in three World Club Challenge matches for Wigan, winning two, against Penrith Panthers in 1991 and Brisbane Broncos in 1994. In 1995, at the height of the Super League War he signed a lucrative deal with the Auckland Warriors, one of the new clubs, coached by former Wigan coach John Monie. Later that year Betts became the first player to win both England and Great Britain caps while not playing in the English leagues. With former Wigan team-mate Shaun Edwards ruled out by injury, Betts captained England from the second row in the 1995 Rugby League World Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, but Australia won the match 16‚Äì8 and retained the World Cup. Betts' selection as captain of England meant he was the first player given the honour while not playing in the English leagues. During the 1996 Auckland Warriors season Betts captained the club. He was selected as vice captain for the 1996 Great Britain Lions tour of Papua New Guinea, Fiji and New Zealand, playing in all Tests against host nations at . The 1997 season was Betts' last with the Auckland Warriors as he returned to England to continue playing for Wigan. Betts returned to play in the 1998 Wigan Warriors season in Europe's Super League competition, and played in the side which lost the 1998 Challenge Cup Final to Sheffield Eagles. He missed Wigan's 1998 Super League Grand Final victory that year through injury. Betts scored Wigan's opening try in the last game at Central Park, and their first try at the JJB Stadium. At the end of 1999's Super League IV, Betts was selected to play for Great Britain in the 1999 Tri- Nations tournament in both of their matches against New Zealand and Australia. Betts played for Wigan in their 2000 Super League Grand Final loss to St. Helens, and their 2001 Grand Final loss to the Bradford Bulls. He was persuaded to retire from playing at the age of 32, to help Wigan get under the salary cap.http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/rugby_league/s/182/182081_wigan_blow_as_betts_off.html In total Betts made 32 appearances for Great Britain, the joint highest ever for a forward, and toured three times, in 1990, 1992 and 1996. He also captained England in the 1995 World Cup Final, which they lost to Australia at Wembley in front of 66,540 fans. Coaching career At the end of 2001, Betts moved into coaching as Under-18s coach at the Wigan Warriors, and progressed to under-21s, which he led to victory in the 2003 U21 Grand Final.http://www.wiganwarriorsfans.com/wigan/?s=Player&o;=9953 In July 2003, Stuart Raper was sacked as the Wigan Warriors coach, and he was replaced by Mike Gregory. Gregory then appointed Betts as his assistant. the Wigan Warriors' results improved and they went on reach the Grand Final, only to lose to Bradford Bulls. The following season, the Wigan Warriors reached another final, losing this time to St. Helens in the Challenge Cup Final. Betts then took temporary charge in May 2004 when Gregory stepped down due to illness. He held the position for a year before he was moved sideways by the club to make way for the appointment of new head coach Ian Millward, who had left St. Helens just two weeks earlier and was recruited for his experience. Betts continued to work under Millward until the end of the 2005's Super League X but left in November after refusing to take a post as coach of the academy Under-21 team. In January 2006 he took up a post as skills and development coach with Guinness Premiership rugby union club Gloucester, a position which he left during June 2010, despite having another year on his contract. Speaking about his time at Gloucester, he said \\"It's a really passionate place and I hope they can get the success they deserve. I really enjoyed the place, especially the match-day atmosphere and the Shed.\\"http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/Gloucester-Rugby-s-skills-coach- Denis-Betts-hails-soul-Kingsholm/story-11892755-detail/story.html While at Gloucester, Betts emerged as a surprise contender for the vacant England coaching job, which he applied for in March 2010, ultimately losing out to Bradford Bulls' Steve McNamara. In November 2010, Betts was appointed coach of Championship club; the Widnes Vikings. In May 2011, he was reappointed to manage the Widnes Vikings into the Super League in 2012.

It is the French-language version of the Dutch show Kuifje ‚Äì De Zonnetempel that premiered in 2001. It premi√®red in Charleroi in 2002 and was scheduled for Paris in 2003 but was cancelled.  Synopsis  = Act 1 = An expedition of seven scientists, the Sanders- Hardiman expedition, discovers the tomb of the Incan mummy Rascar Capac and provokes the anger of the Sun God. A curse descends upon them. Meanwhile, Tintin and Snowy arrive on the train at Marlinspike, and Tintin talks to another traveller about the recent return of the expedition from Peru. He says that all will end badly, desecrating the burial chambers of the Incas like Tutankhamen's ‚Äì five members of the expedition have already been mysteriously struck down. Tintin and Snowy go to Marlinspike Hall where Captain Haddock lives, and they meet Nestor the butler. He says that Haddock is currently horse riding, but he shortly returns minus the horse. Haddock introduces their old friend Professor Calculus, and then tries to show Tintin a magic trick to turn water into whisky, which fails. Angry at not being able to do it, he takes Tintin to the music hall to see Bruno the magician perform the trick. That evening at the music hall, Tintin and Haddock watch a performance by the opera singer Bianca Castafiore, which Snowy turns into an impromptu duet. Haddock storms out from the show because of Castafiore's singing. Ragdalam the fakir and Yamilah the clairvoyant perform after Castafiore; after a few novelty predictions, Ragdalam asks Yamilah to tell him about a woman in the audience, Mrs Clarkson. She says that her husband, Clarkson, is a photographer, and that he has been struck down by the curse of Rascar Capac. Mrs Clarkson must leave the show with her daughter, Fleur, when she receives a message that her husband is indeed ill. The magician's act is on, and Haddock stumbles onto the stage with a stage prop of a cow's head on his, after having got lost backstage trying to find his way out. Tintin, Haddock, and Calculus go to the home of Professor Hercules Tarragon to protect him, as he and Calculus were students together. The police detectives Thomson and Thompson have also been sent to protect Tarragon. Tarragon reveals the mummy of Rascar Capac, and Tintin reads the prophecy that the expedition found in his tomb. A storm comes, a ball of lightning comes down the chimney, destroys the mummy, and Bergamotte realises that the prophecy is true. He is then struck down by the curse like the others. At the hospital, Fleur and her mother sit by the bed of Clarkson. Tintin arrives following Bergamotte's attack, and Fleur asks him to help her father. Tintin says he will, and leaves the hospital, whilst Fleur reassures her mother that everything will be alright because Tintin will help them. In the garden, Calculus mysteriously disappears following his donning the bracelet. Later at Marlinspike, Haddock is depressed because of Calculus's disappearance. Castafiore, her accompanist Igor Wagner, and her maid Irma arrive; Castafiore announcing she will be staying for a period. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy manage to escape and head to the docks, where they discover that Calculus has been spotted on the ship ¬´Pachacamac¬ª and is going to Peru. They catch a flying boat to Peru, and as it flies into the distance, the curtain closes on Act One. = Act 2 = In Peru, Tintin and Haddock ask whether anyone has seen Calculus, but are met with \\"No s√©\\" (\\"I don't know\\") from everyone. Tintin and Snowy intervene to stop two men bullying a child. The child, Zorrino, reveals that he is an orphan living on the streets. Tintin cheers him up by making him a little boat out of newspaper. Zorrino reveals that he knows where Calculus is ‚Äì he has been taken to the Temple of the Sun. Zorrino leads them on a trek to the temple, with many perils against them. Snowy is taken by a condor, and Tintin climbs to the top of a cliff to look for him. He is attacked by the condor and, hanging onto its legs, is carried to the ground where he discovers Snowy. Meanwhile, Thomson and Thompson have found Calculus's pendulum and attempt to use it to locate him. They mistake the indications given by the pendulum, and travel to the North Pole and meet an eskimo, to the Far East, and to Scotland. Eventually they realise that the pendulum is pointing to Peru, where Tintin and Haddock are, and head off in pursuit. Tintin, Haddock and Zorrino reach a waterfall. Zorrino and Haddock cross without incident, but as Tintin crosses, with Snowy in his rucksack, the rope snaps and they fall through the waterfall. He survives the fall and Haddock and Zorrino join him on the other side of the waterfall, in a cavern. At the same time, an Incan ceremony is taking place. Suddenly, Tintin, Snowy, Haddock and Zorrino crash through a hidden door in the wall. They are blindfolded, and the Grand Inca declares that their punishment for profaning the temple is to die at the stake, but grants them one last wish: they are allowed to choose the day and hour of their deaths. Zorrino is separated from the others as they are imprisoned, visits them in their cell, and unfolds the little boat that Tintin had made for him. Tintin reads the newspaper and finds their salvation. He tells the Incan guard that they wish to die in eighteen days' time. When the day comes, they are bound to the stake on the funeral pyre whilst a ceremony takes place. Thomson and Thompson arrive, having finally found Calculus; they are also tied up. As they are about to be sacrificed, Tintin \\"commands\\" the Sun; everything goes dark as the Moon moves in front of the Sun's face. Tintin reveals to a startled Haddock what he read in the newspaper: the impending solar eclipse! The Grand Inca begs Tintin to make the Sun show its light again, and he does so. The Inca sets them free, as they have the favour of the Sun. Tintin asks for the curse of Rascar Capac to be lifted, and in Europe, the expedition members awake, to the delight of Mrs Clarkson and Fleur, who thank Tintin. Back in Peru, the Grand Inca adopts Zorrino, and as everyone comes home in Brussels together, the cast takes their bows. The curtain falls.

There are around twenty different songs in the show, and a few reprises. The two main themes that run throughout the show are Haddock's (first heard when he performs the trick with the whisky, later heard in full at Moulinsart and the port) and Soleil, or Tintin's theme, sung first after his leaving the hospital and as a finale. A CD release, containing 18 studio- recorded songs sung by the original cast, appeared in 2002. Most songs were present in their full versions as heard in the show. Some songs were not featured, partly because they were variations on others already present (for example, Rien dans les manches being a pared-down version of Mille millions de mille sabords). A notable omission was Promenade avec Tournesol, a cheerful tune that would have appeared between tracks 9 and 10 on the CD. Staging & Effects The show features an incredible array of special effects and imaginative staging, including : * A cliff parting to reveal the mummy of Rascar Capac * A train steaming into the station * The seven explorers trapped inside revolving crystal balls * Ball lightning lifting Tournesol into the air on his chair * A flying boat taking off * A condor in flight, with Tintin hanging from the legs * A waterfall drawn from a 6.5 tonne reservoir * A total solar eclipse The Paris affair After the resounding success of the show in Belgium, the show was scheduled to be performed in Paris at the Hippodrome d'Auteil in 2003 as the highlight of the Christmas playbill. The cast was to remain the same as for Charleroi, with the exception of Frayne McCarthy (Haddock) being replaced by Patrick Rocca. It was a hotly anticipated performance, with a theatre being renovated to house the ambitious special effects. Tickets were sold in advance and a CD was produced (featuring the Belgian cast), a stripped-down version of the Charleroi release. A DVD was scheduled for release in January 2004. Divisions began to appear between the investors and the producers. Although it was not clear who was to blame ‚Äì a main investor was rumoured to have pulled out, or hadn't the proposed capital ‚Äì events came to a head in October 2003 and a press release issued on 20 October declared that the show was cancelled. It was a major blow to everyone involved : thousands of ticket-buyers had to be refunded, the CD had already been launched and a huge media campaign had to be cancelled (which would have incorporated amongst others France 2, RTL and T√©l√©rama). Owing to the risk taken ‚Äì and arguably demonstrating foresight on behalf of the management ‚Äì the actors' contracts stipulated they would not be paid until the show had been performed. The future Tabas&Co; and Moulinsart had chosen the wrong business partners, yet the Paris affair did not spell the permanent end of the show. Moulinsart is reportedly examining the feasibility of launching the show in other countries, with the Dutch city of Rotterdam apparently being considered.

History Kant believed that what created the problem of ethical behavior is the duality of human nature. Since humans are both sensible and intellectual, and at the same time motivated by impulse, they must be guided by rules of conduct to balance the two. He believed that everyone could decide right or wrong based on the will behind the action, rather than the action itself. In deciding whether one's actions were moral, he said it should be considered what the universal benefit would be if everyone behaved in such a fashion. For example, if everyone stole, the result would be chaos and violence. Therefore, a moral person would consider it unethical to steal. In abiding by these laws, it is possible to see how a universal code of ethics could be built up. However, men like Marx and Engels believed that there could be no universal code of ethics because all ethics and philosophy are relative to the economic situations of each individual society. Therefore, each society would create its own system of ethics based on its economic status and history, and the current system of ethics would soon give way to a new one. Thus all morals and ethics are relative. Later codes of ethics, such as that of Max Stirner, stated that the only ethics that existed were those that benefited the self. The common good and the love of one's fellow man, he claimed, were only illusory. Men who were exceptional in some way (intelligence or rank) were always the exception to moral standards. Nietzsche founded his ethical principles on this basis; he believed that everything powerful men did was defined as moral.History of Ethics. Universal ethics There are several ethical standards that are considered to be self-evident, and seem to apply to all people throughout all of history, regardless of cultural, political, social, or economic context. The non- aggression principle, which prohibits aggression, or the initiation of force or violence against another person, is a universal ethical principle. Examples of aggression include murder, rape, kidnapping, assault, robbery, theft, and vandalism. On the other hand, the commission of any of such acts in response to aggression does not necessarily violate universal ethics. Reasons There are obvious reasons why universal ethics are beneficial to society. For example, if people were allowed to kill or steal, this would lead to widespread chaos and violence, and would be detrimental to the well-being of society. Most people agree that it's better to prohibit aggression than to allow everyone to commit it. Therefore, aggression is intrinsically immoral. Although nearly all societies have laws prohibiting aggression, this does not mean that universal ethics are necessarily reflected by that society's government or its dominant ideology.

He was the coach of the Indiana Hoosiers men's soccer team from 1973 to 2003. His teams won six NCAA Championships and a Division I record 544 games. He is considered the most successful collegiate soccer coach in the history of the sport. His overall career record was 544-101-45 (.828). He never had a losing season as a head coach. Yeagley was also an NCAA Champion in soccer as a player, winning the national championship with West Chester in 1961. Coaching career After earning a Master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1963, Yeagley went to Indiana University as a Physical Education instructor and men's soccer coach. The team had been a club since 1947, but Yeagley's goal was to develop it into a varsity program. For ten years, with no money from the University for Yeagley's salary, team travel expenses, recruiting or uniforms, Yeagley, his wife Marilyn and the players lined the field, hung signs on campus and washed the players' uniforms. Once the program gained varsity status and the full support of the University in 1973, Yeagley's teams quickly became a national power. Indiana reached the NCAA final in just its fourth season as a varsity program in 1976. In fact, through his 31-year career, Yeagley took every one of his four-year players to the NCAA College Cup, soccer's version of the Final Four. His teams made 28 NCAA tournament appearances, 16 appearances in the College Cup, and 12 appearances in the national final, while winning 10 Big Ten championships and 6 National championships -- 1982, 1983, 1988, 1998, 1999, 2003 -- the last one in his final season. From 1973 through 2003 no team won more NCAA Championships or appeared in more College Cups than Indiana. The Hoosiers' longest stint away from the national semifinal was three years (1985‚Äì87) and they followed that brief drought by winning the 1988 NCAA crown. Yeagley led the Hoosiers to 28 NCAA Tournament berths, the third-most in NCAA history, including one in each of his final 17 seasons. His Hoosier teams owned a 68-22 (.756) record in tournament play, the best winning percentage of any school. Yeagley's career came to a fitting and magical end in 2003 as his Hoosiers went unbeaten over their final 18 games and winning the NCAA Championship. The title was the sixth for the program under Yeagley and in the process, he became the all-time winningest coach in collegiate soccer history with 544 wins. Legacy =Honors and recognition= Yeagley won NSCAA National Coach of the Year honors an unprecedented six times (1976, 1980, 1994, 1998, 1999, 2003). He was named Big Ten Coach of the Year an unmatched eight times (1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003). In 1989, he earned the highest honor a college coach can receive when he was inducted into the United States Soccer Federation Hall of Fame. Yeagley received the prestigious Bill Jeffrey Award in 1987, given for his unique contributions to intercollegiate soccer. In 1997, he received the NSCAA's Honor Award, the organization's highest tribute. In 2008, he was inducted into the NSCAA Hall of Fame. Upon his retirement in 2003, the soccer field at Indiana was renamed \\"Jerry Yeagley Field at Bill Armstrong Stadium\\". In 2005, NSCAA honored him with an award in his namesake, the Jerry Yeagley Award. =Coaching tree= Yeagley has helped inspire a number of his players to become coaches. There are more than 20 former IU players or coaches in the collegiate coaching ranks, while professional coaches who played under Yeagley include Caleb Porter, Mike Anhaeuser and Juergen Sommer. Yeagley's son Todd played for him at Indiana from 1991 to 1994, winning the 1994 Hermann Trophy from the Missouri Athletic Club and being named a First-Team All-American. After playing for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer from 1996 to 2002, Todd returned to Indiana as a volunteer assistant coach during his father's last season. On December 18, 2009, Todd Yeagley was named Head Coach at Indiana. References * Jerry Yeagley - Class of 1989. National Soccer Hall of Fame * Jerry Yeagley.

Geography  Namtso was born in the Paleogene age, as a result of Himalayan tectonic plate movements. The lake lies at an elevation of , and has a surface area of . This salt lake is the largest lake in the Tibet Autonomous Region. However, it is not the largest lake on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. That title belongs to Qinghai Lake (more than twice the size of Namtso); which lies more than to the north-east in Qinghai. Namtso has five uninhabited islands of reasonable size, in addition to one or two rocky outcrops. The islands have been used for spiritual retreat by pilgrims who walk over the lake's frozen surface at the end of winter, carrying their food with them. They spend the summer there, unable to return to shore again until the water freezes the following winter. This practice is no longer permitted by Chinese authorities. The largest of the islands is in the northwest corner of the lake, and is about long and wide, rising to just over in the middle. At its closest point it is about from the shore. The most remote island is, at its closest, from the shore. At summer time birds like Ruddy shelduck and cormorants (Phalacrocorax sp.) migrate to the lake area, besides the fields of Astragalus, Roegneria nutans and Marram grass. Climate The weather at Namtso is subject to abrupt, sudden change and snowstorms are very common across the Nyainq√™ntanglha range. Namtso has a K√∂ppen climate classification of alpine or tundra climate (Koppen ET).  Other Features  NH-46-5 Nam Tso China Namtso is renowned as one of the most beautiful places in the Nyainq√™ntanglha mountain range. Its cave hermitages have for centuries been the destination of Tibetan pilgrims. A surfaced road across Laken Pass at 5186 m was completed to the lake in 2005, enabling easy access from Lhasa and the development of tourism at the lake. Settlements in the area include Dobjoi, Donggar and Cha'gyungoinba. The Tashi Dor monastery is located at the southeastern corner of the lake. Around the area's natural elements, historical and anthropological background, a 2010 romantic drama Shangri-La, starring China's popular actor Hu Ge, was broadcast at CCTV1 and received positive reviews. Some scenes in the 2002 Hong Kong film The Touch were filmed at the lake. Namtso Lake was featured in Episode 4, The Roof of the World, of BBC TV series: Himalaya with Michael Palin.

December 1917Dates given in the Gregorian calendar) was a Russian general, the last commander-in-chief of the Imperial Russian Army. Biography Dukhonin was born in the Smolensk Governorate. He served in the Kiev Military District before the start of the First World War. There he gained some experience in intelligence work. At the outset of the War, Dukhonin was given command of a Russian regiment. He was then assigned to the Third Army in Dubno under General Ruzsky as senior adjutant of the intelligence department. In the spring of 1917 he was the chief of staff of the Southwestern Front, In August 1917, Dukhonin was Quartermaster General of the Southwestern Front, and was plucked from this relative obscurity by Kerensky to replace Alexeyev as Chief of Staff at GHQ in Mogilev, as Alexeyev had resigned as a result of Kornilov's failed coup. It was Alexeyev who had suggested Dukhonin as his successor so that he could continue to influence affairs at Stavka in Mogilev. When Kerensky fled Petrograd and then Russia following the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution, Dukhonin became de facto Supreme Commander, albeit of an army that was rapidly disintegrating, and over which he exercised very little control. During the initial stages of the Bolshevik seizure of power the Council of People's Commissars instructed Dukhonin to cease wartime hostilities and open negotiations with the Central Powers. Lenin and Krylenko visited Dukhonin in Petrograd to discuss an armistice proposal. Dukhonin's response was adamant: on 22 November he categorically declined the directive of the Council of People's Commissars. He had discussed such a development with diplomats from the Entente governments. Dukhonin told Lenin that such an order could only be issued by \\"a government sustained by the army and the country\\". Lenin immediately proceeded to a wireless station and broadcast news of Dukhonin's dismissal as Commander-in-Chief and Krylenko's replacement in his stead. The following day a joint note was issued by the military missions of Britain, France, Italy, Japan and Romania, citing the Treaty of 23 August 1914 by which the allies agreed not to conclude an armistice except by common consent. These missions were based at the General Headquarters in Mogilev.Soviet Foreign Policy Vol. 1 1917 - 1945, ed Andrei Gromyko and Boris Ponomarev, Progress Publishers, 1980 However, Dukhonin opened negotiations with General Kaledin, and asked for units from Kornilov's 'shock battalions' to be rushed to defend Mogilev against the units of the Red Army that were due to arrive by rail with Krylenko. Thanks to the efforts of the local Mogilev soviet and the garrison commander Mikhail Dmitriyevich Bonch-Bruyevich, these troops were sent south to the Don or west against the Poles at Zhlobin, and conflict was avoided. Dukhonin then decided to escape with Kerensky's commissar Stankovich, but was persuaded to stay by General Diterikhs. His last action was to order the release of the officers being held prisoner at Bikhov, most notably Kornilov and Denikin. Dukhonin subsequently surrendered to Krylenko in Mogilev, but was murdered by Krylenko's Bolshevik military escort near the railway station on 3 December 1917.Precl√≠k, Vratislav.

A left-arm fast-medium pace bowler, he appeared for England in two Test matches in 1889. Fothergill began his career as a club professional in the north east of England. He joined Somerset as one of their first professionals in 1880, but was forced to miss most of 1881 while he qualified for the county. He was the most productive bowler for the county in their first two years of first- class cricket, but the emergence of E. W. Bastard, and later Ted Tyler and Sammy Woods, limited his opportunities with the club. He joined the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground in 1882, and played for the MCC until 1892, also appearing at Lord's for representative sides. In the English winter of 1888‚Äì89, he was chosen to tour South Africa with the MCC, and played in two matches which were later designated as Test matches, though Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described them as being \\"arguably not even first-class.\\" He took 119 first-class wickets during his career, of which eight came in his two Tests. Early life and career Arnold James Fothergill was born on 26 August 1854 in Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland. He began his cricket career with Northumberland Cricket Club, a private club which was a precursor to the county team. He appeared as a professional for the side from 1870 until 1879, during which time he was also employed by Benwell High Cross Cricket Club in 1870 and 1871, and Manchester Cricket Club in 1879, before moving to Somerset in 1880. Somerset professional =Second-class cricket= Somerset County Cricket Club was founded in 1875, and although they initially struggled financially, Fothergill and Alfred Brooks were employed as the club's first professionals in 1880.Roebuck (1991), p. 23. Fothergill played his first recorded match for the county in July of that year, facing a team of sixteen men from Weston-super-Mare, taking thirteen wickets in the match. Throughout 1880, he was regularly Somerset's leading wicket-taker in their matches; he collected five wickets in an innings against the Marylebone Cricket Club twice, Hertfordshire, and Leicestershire. In 1881, Fothergill was included in the Somerset team to face Kent in Bath. The Kent captain, Richard Thornton objected to Fothergill's presence, correctly pointing out that he was not qualified to play for Somerset. As a result, Fothergill was removed from the side, and did not appear for the side in county cricket again that season, while he served his qualification. He did appear once for the county, against the MCC, taking four wickets in the first innings, and scoring 47 runs as an opening batsman. =First-class cricket= In 1882, Fothergill joined the ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground, and made his first-class debut for the MCC against Derbyshire in May. Bowling unchanged in the first innings, he claimed five wickets for 31 runs, and then scored the highest score of his first-class career, 74 runs, in a large victory for his side. The following month, he featured for Somerset in what is generally considered to be their first match of the first-class cricket, against Lancashire. Somerset were heavily beaten in the match, during which Fothergill took three wickets and scored three runs. That summer, he was selected to appear for the professional \\"Players\\" against the amateur \\"Gentlemen\\" in the prestigious annual fixture at Lord's, in which he had little impact as the Gentlemen won by eight wickets. In all, Fothergill played fourteen first-class matches in 1882, claiming 44 wickets at an average of 22.02, and taking five wickets in an innings twice. He was Somerset's leading wicket-taker during the season, taking twice as many wickets as the next most effective bowler, Charles Winter. Fothergill's first match in 1883 was in a representative match, playing for the South against the North. The South, for whom Fothergill was the only player to score double figures in each innings, lost the match. He then played exclusively with the MCC until the end of July, when Somerset's fixtures began. Having collected five wickets in an innings for the MCC against Oxford University, Fothergill repeated the feat twice that season for Somerset, taking five for 23 against Gloucestershire, and then achieving his best first-class bowling figures of six for 43 against Hampshire. In the latter match, he also took four wickets in the second innings, giving him ten wickets in the match, the only occasion he achieved the feat in first-class cricket. He played one further match towards the end of the 1883 season, against that year's \\"Champion County\\", Nottinghamshire. The MCC won the game by 121 runs; in the first innings, Fothergill was not required to bowl as Nottinghamshire were bowled out for 23, with six players scoring ducks, and he took five for 30 in the second innings. Fothergill was once more Somerset's leading wicket-taker during 1883, taking 27 of his 37 first-class wickets for the county that year. His bowling average of 14.72 was his best during an English season. During the following season, Fothergill only appeared once for Somerset, in a match against Kent early in the season. He took four for 87 in the match, which was his final first-class appearance for the county. Fothergill was again selected to play for the South against the North, but bowled just three overs in the match, without taking a wicket. The remainder of his notable appearances that season were made for the MCC, though few were considered first-class. He performed well in matches against Wiltshire and Leicestershire, taking eleven wickets in each match, including seven for 62 in the second innings against Leicestershire, but neither match had first-class status. In 1885, he enjoyed his best match for the South, taking four wickets in each innings as the North were defeated by nine wickets. The majority of his cricket from 1884 until 1886 was made for the MCC, although he did appear four times in 1886 for Somerset, which had been stripped of its first-class status.Foot (1986), pp. 23‚Äì28. In contrast, in 1887 and 1888, he played almost exclusively for the county, appearing just three times for the MCC. Somerset, who had relied on the bowling of Fothergill in the early 1880s, were spearheaded by E. W. Bastard, Ted Tyler and Sammy Woods in the late 1880s, and Fothergill was rarely needed to bowl many overs. Despite this, he was presented with a bat during 1888, a reward usually given to batsmen who had scored a century.Roebuck (1991), pp. 43‚Äì45. Test cricketer alt=A black and white poster, all text, advertising two cricket matches During the English winter of 1888‚Äì89, the MCC sent a touring team to South Africa. Organised by Major Gardner Warton, the original itinerary only featured \\"odds\\" matches, in which an 11-player MCC team faced opposition sides including 15, 18 or 22 players, depending on their perceived strength. In his book, A History of Cricket, Harry Altham describes that the quality of the touring party \\"was about that of a weak county.\\" Fothergill was selected as part of the side, despite not having played a first-class match since May 1887. The majority of the wickets during the tour were taken by Lancashire's spinner, Johnny Briggs, who took almost 300, but Fothergill was heavily used as a bowler, and claimed 119 wickets at an average of 6.89. Altham suggests that the ease of the touring side's victories justifies the selection of a comparatively weak side. As the tour continued, there were calls for an even- strength contest, with the English side facing an 11-player South African side. Two such matches were arranged, but were considered no different from the other matches during the tour, being advertised as Major Warton's XI v South Africa XI. The matches were later granted Test match status, although Wisden Cricketers' Almanack commented that, \\"it was never intended, or considered necessary, to take out a representative English team for a first trip to the Cape.\\" In the first Test, Fothergill opened the bowling with Briggs, and bowled economically, conceding 15 runs from his 24 four-ball overs. He only took one wicket in the innings, and was noted more for his batting later in the day. Having bowled South Africa out for 84, England rallied from 103 for nine due to a 45-run partnership for the tenth wicket between Fothergill and Basil Grieve. Batting at number eleven, Fothergill scored 32 runs, second only to opening batsman Bobby Abel. In South Africa's second innings, Fothergill was used as first-change bowler, and took four wickets for 19, his best figures in the two Test matches. South Africa scored 129 runs before being bowled out, and England scored the 67 runs required for victory with a day of the match remaining. England dominated the second Test, largely due to the bowling of Briggs. Batting first, England scored 292 runs, of which Abel contributed 120. Fothergill claimed the first South African wicket, Albert Rose-Innes at the end of the first day, but only claimed two more in the match, as Briggs took fifteen wickets on the second day to help England to an innings and 202-run victory. Fothergill's two Test appearances were the only ones of his career, and were also his final first-class matches. In all, he took 119 first-class wickets at an average of 18.18. His highest score was the 74 runs he scored on his debut. Later life and career After returning from South Africa, Fothergill played occasionally for the MCC, and three further times for Somerset, but with little merit. He made his final appearance for Somerset in 1889, against Staffordshire; he took 157 wickets for the county in total, of which 57 came in first-class matches. His last match for the MCC was three years later, against Llandudno Cricket Club. In his obituary, Wisden suggest that he returned to Tyneside at the end of his professional cricket career. He died in Sunderland on 1 August 1932.

Originally a southern suburb of Cairo, it served as the capital of the now defunct Helwan Governorate from April 2008 to April 2011, after which it was re-incorporated into the Cairo Governorate. The kism of Helwan had a population of 643,327 in the 2006 census.Central Agency for Public Mobilisation and Statistics, Population and Housing Census 2006, Population distribution by sex, gov: Cairo Retrieved on 2008-04-01.  History  The Helwan and Isnian cultures of the late Epipalaeolithic, and their Ouchata retouch methods for creating microlithic tools may have contributed to the development of the Harifian cultural assemblage of the Sinai, which may have introduced Proto-Semitic languages into the Middle East. Around 3000 to 2600 BC, there was a cemetery near Helwan serving the city of Memphis. The city of Helwan was founded in 689 CE as Fustat's temporary replacement as the capital of Umayyad Egypt by its governor Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan, who died in the new city. The Khedivial Astronomical Observatory was built here 1903‚Äì1904, and was used to observe Halley's comet. Egypt's oldest and largest private psychiatric clinic, the Behman Hospital, was constructed here in 1939. During the early part of the 20th century, the city was the site of RAF Helwan, a major British airfield, which was later used by the Egyptian Air Force. In 1959 Helwan was chosen to serve as a site of a major industrial city, as part of President Gamal Abdel Nasser's attempts to industrialize Egypt. Throughout the 1960s, it developed into a massive steelworks zone, with numerous automobile factories being built. The site continues to use electricity from the Aswan Dam and iron ore from Egypt's western deserts. Helwan was gradually transformed into a mass suburb of Cairo for the working class.Beattie, Andrew. (2005) Cairo: A Cultural and Literary History. Signal Books. p. 196. In April 2008, the Helwan Governorate was split from the Cairo Governorate. It encompassed most of the suburbs, new compounds and villages located in the southern part of Cairo. The city of Helwan became the capital of the new governorate. Following the dissolution of the Helwan Governorate in April 2011, the city of Helwan was reincorporated into the Cairo Governorate.

Administrative divisions  The now defunct Helwan Governorate encompassed the following cities or districts: Maadi, Helwan, 15th of May, El Shorouk, New Cairo, Madinaty. The city of Helwan itself includes districts such as Wadi Hof, Hadayek Helwan, and Maasara.  Economy  President Gamal Abdel Nasser inaugurating the Al Nasr automobile factory in Helwan, 1963 Local industry includes iron, steel, textiles and cement. The area has hot sulphur springs, an astronomical observatory, the Helwan University and a burial chamber (discovered in 1946). It is the terminus of Cairo's light rail Metro Line 1.

His performances are showcased on two songs on the band's second album, Fun House (1970). The Stooges In 1970, Mackay was familiar to the Stooges from his work with the Detroit avant-rock pioneers Carnal Kitchen. After sitting in with the Stooges on several occasions, he formally joined the group at the behest of lead singer Iggy Pop two days before they left Detroit for Los Angeles to record Fun House in May 1970. Mackay remained with the Stooges for five months before being fired by Pop in October 1970. As the band had been deteriorating from drug abuse and a dearth of professional opportunities, Mackay later recalled that he was \\"somewhat grateful\\" for being dismissed. In 2003, Mackay rejoined the Stooges when they played their first show in twenty-nine years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. He remained with the group until his death in 2015. During this period, he appeared on the live Stooges releases Live in Detroit (DVD) and Telluric Chaos (a live album; 2005), and two studio albums, The Weirdness (2007) and Ready to Die (2013). He also contributed to James Williamson's solo studio debut, Re-Licked (2014). Other collaborations Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Mackay played and recorded with a highly diverse cross-section of underground musicians, including Violent Femmes, Snakefinger, Commander Cody, Smegma, Zu, Andre Williams, the Moonlighters, Clubfoot Orchestra, and Van Rozay from San Jose, California. He was based in Ann Arbor (where he continued to work at Discount Records and perform with Carnal Kitchen and the Mojo Boogie Band, a blues rock ensemble) until 1976, when he initially relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area. During this period, he supported his musical endeavors by working as a stationary engineer at various San Francisco sewage treatment plants. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mackay performed in a reconstituted lineup of Carnal Kitchen with then-wife Annie Garcia-Mackay, a blues singer and bassist. In 2001, they divorced due to mutual differences; later that year, he was remarried to Patricia Smith. By the 1990s, Mackay's profile had gradually lowered as he took up residence in Pacifica, California (following a sojourn in Amsterdam) and began work as an electrician. The wider perception was that Mackay was dead. In 2000, Stooges biography pages on websites for MTV, VH1, and Rolling Stone included an item indicating that Mackay had died as a result of a heroin overdose in the 1970s. The origin of this story is unknown, but music journalist Nick Kent reported the \\"fact\\" in a piece on Pop in the mid-1970s. According to Alexis Petridis, \\"Kent had apparently misheard the lyrics of Iggy Pop‚Äôs 'Dum Dum Boys,' which mentioned the death of Stooges roadie and bassist Thomas 'Zeke' Zettner.\\" A second rumor circulated following the AIDS-related death of a San Francisco-based marathon runner and author who shared Mackay's name. Scott Nydegger from the small record label and noise collective Radon disproved the rumors by contacting Mackay and arranging to release his first solo recordings. Radon released the \\"Death City\\" single in 1999, and Mackay began to perform and record regularly with a revolving line-up of musicians associated with Radon. The first full-scale tour of Steve Mackay and the Radon Ensemble was mounted in July 2003; with a percussion-heavy lineup that featured bassist Marlon Kasberg (Liquorball), drummer Sam Lohman (Nimrod 36), multi-instrumentalist Travis McAlister (Nequaquam Vacuum), scrap percussionist and vocalist Noah Mickens (also Nequaquam Vacuum), and drummer and band leader Scott Nydegger (Sikhara). Other musicians who have performed and recorded with the Radon Ensemble since then included the multi-instrumentalist Tyler Armstrong, projectionist Ed Cooper, bassist Giovanni Donadini, Nyko Esterle, multi-instrumentalists Kamil Kruta of Koonda Holaa and Dan Kauffman, bassist Jason LaFarge, saxophonist Vinnie Paternostro, Fabrizio Modonese-Polumbo, saxophonist Shane Pringle, Frank Pullen, Suzanne Thorpe (Mercury Rev), John Wiese (Bastard Noise), and drummer Ed Wilcox. Mackay performing in 2007 Mackay also appeared at live shows by Violent Femmes, with whom he played off and on for over two decades after appearing on their album The Blind Leading the Naked. Radon released the Smegma‚ÄìMackay collaboration album 30 Years of Service in 2005, his full-length album Michigan and Arcturus (2006), a vinyl- only release with the Radon Ensemble entitled \\"Tunnel Diner\\", and in 2008 Resipiscent released Smegma's Live 2004 featuring Mackay and Jello Biafra. Mackay's solo discography included a self-released collection of solo and group demos from the 1980s called En Voyage, and such compilation albums as Popular Electronic Uzak, You've Got Your Orders 3, and Multiball Magazine Issue 2. The Steve Mackay Ensemble continued to perform live and on radio, and embarked on a tour of the US and Europe in 2006. In December 2007, Mackay recorded two day sessions at the Big Baldy's Toe studio in Claremont CA ,home to Amps for Man Is the Bastard founder Henry Barnes. This session yielded among others the single \\"Prisoner\\" which was written by Steve Mackay around 1984 and produced and arranged in 2007 by Kamilsky of Koonda Holaa. In 2009 Iggy Pop contributed his version of vocals to the track and subsequently it was used in a french movie L'√âtoile du jour (Morning Star) directed by Sophie Blondy. Another track from this session \\"Kristallnacht\\" was released on Sometimes Like This I Talk. Both tracks feature bassist Mike Watt and drummer Randy Scarberry. Musical friendship between Steve Mackay and Kamilsky lasted from 2000 till his death and spawned hours of unreleased recordings and countless tours. Mackay continued to collaborate with the Clubfoot Orchestra members, sitting in occasionally at the Bay Area Boat Club's parties. In 2011 Radon and SOOPA released Mackay's new album Sometimes Like This I Talk which features other members of the Stooges, and also the album Machine Gun from U.S.S. with Mackay on sax. Also in 2011, Mackay released North Beach Jazz featuring punk bassist Mike Watt, a member of the reunited Stooges. Mackay was also featured on the record Titans, released in 2012 by the Portuguese stoner- psychedelic rock band Black Bombaim, playing sax on track 'C'. In 2014, he played on the song \\"A Higher Price To Pay\\", by the French heavy rock band the Meredith Hunters. He also toured with Bunktilt. In 2015, Mackay, lo-fi pioneer R. Stevie Moore and Scott Nydegger (Sikhara) were featured on Shanghai-based experimental punk band Round Eye's eponymous LP, which was released by Florida label Ripping Records. In 2017, they released their 2nd LP ‚Äò‚ÄôMonstervision‚Äô‚Äô on Sudden Death Records which contained Mackay‚Äôs final recordings. Death Mackay died in October 2015 from sepsis at a hospital in Daly City, California at the age of 66. A Tribute for Steve Mackay was held at Winter's Tavern in Pacifica, California on February 27, 2016. The musicians who participated included Jello Biafra and Mike Watt, who performed Side 2 of the Stooges' Fun House album. Iggy Pop contributed a short poem that Watt played for the audience through an iPhone.

It stars Kyle MacLachlan and Michael Nouri, along with Clu Gulager, Chris Mulkey, Ed O'Ross, Clarence Felder, Claudia Christian and Larry Cedar, and received mostly positive reviews. A sequel, The Hidden II, was directed by Seth Pinsker and released in 1993. Plot Jack DeVries (Chris Mulkey), a quiet citizen with no criminal past, robs a Los Angeles Wells Fargo bank, kills all of the security guards inside, and leads the Los Angeles Police Department on a high-speed chase. The chase ends when DeVries encounters a police blockade overseen by Detective Thomas Beck (Michael Nouri). DeVries is shot several times, smashes through the blockade and crashes the Ferrari he is driving. DeVries is taken to a hospital, where a doctor informs Beck and his partner, Det. Cliff Willis (Ed O'Ross) that DeVries is not expected to survive the night. Upon his return to LAPD headquarters, Beck and his supervisor, Lt. John Masterson (Clarence Felder), meet FBI Special Agent Lloyd Gallagher (Kyle MacLachlan), who informs them that Beck has been assigned to work with Gallagher to track down DeVries. When told of DeVries's condition, Gallagher rushes off to the hospital. Meanwhile, at the hospital, DeVries suddenly awakens. Disconnecting his life-support equipment, he approaches the comatose man in the next bed, Jonathan P. Miller (William Boyett). After DeVries forces Miller's mouth open, a slug-like alien emerges from DeVries' mouth and transfers itself into Miller's body. Gallagher arrives to find DeVries dead on the floor and Miller's bed abandoned. Gallagher tells Beck to put out an alert on Miller, but Beck refuses, because Miller has no criminal record. Miller goes to a record store where he beats the store's owner to death. He then goes to a car dealership, where he kills three men and steals a red Ferrari. He then visits a strip club, where the alien leaves Miller's body and takes over the body of a stripper named Brenda (Claudia Christian). Gallagher asks police to track Brenda when he sees her picture next to Miller's body. Brenda is then propositioned by a cat-caller, she accepts and follows him to his car. They proceed to have vehicular sex in a parking lot which results in his death. She then takes his car. Gallagher and Beck pursue her to a rooftop, where they mortally wound her in a gun battle. As Brenda dies, Gallagher points a strangely-shaped, alien weapon at her; however, she leaps from the roof. As Masterson arrives from his house to take charge of the scene, the alien transfers itself from Brenda's dying body to Masterson's dog. Frustrated by Gallagher's continuing refusal to explain the strange phenomenon of ordinary citizens turning into crazed killers, Beck arrests him and puts him in a jail cell. Beck soon learns that \\"Gallagher\\" is an imposter, impersonating the real agent Gallagher, who is dead. When Beck confronts \\"Gallagher\\" with this information, \\"Gallagher\\" tells him that he (\\"Gallagher\\") is an extraterrestrial lawman and that they are in fact pursuing an alien thrill killer who has the ability to take over human bodies. Beck dismisses the story as insane and leaves \\"Gallagher\\" incarcerated in a jail cell at the police station. Back at Masterson's house, the alien leaves the dog's body and enters Masterson. In the morning, Masterson goes to the police station and seizes a number of weapons, sparking a shootout between himself and the station's police officers as he attempts to track down \\"Gallagher\\". Convinced of \\"Gallaghers story due to Masterson's immunity to excessive bullet wounds, Beck releases him from his cell, and the two confront Masterson. During the resulting shootout, Masterson confirms that \\"Gallagher\\" is an alien law enforcer named Alhague who has been pursuing the alien ever since it murdered his family and his partner on another planet. (When Alhague first came to Earth, he inhabited the body of Robert Stone‚Äîa park ranger‚Äîthen assumed the identity of Lloyd Gallagher after the real Gallagher was killed in a fire.) Though Beck manages to stop Masterson, Alhague/Gallagher reveals that his weapon cannot kill the alien when it is inside a human body as the weapon does not work on human skin, thus requiring him to be present when it is transferring hosts. They are unable to stop the alien from abandoning Masterson's body for that of Beck's partner Willis, who then escapes the station. Using Willis' credentials, the alien tries to gain access to Senator Holt (John McCann), a likely presidential candidate, at the hotel where the senator is staying. Alhague/Gallagher and Beck follow Willis, and a shootout ensues between Beck and Willis, during which Beck is severely wounded. As Willis, the alien corners Senator Holt and enters his body before Alhague/Gallagher can stop him. \\"Holt\\" then calls a press conference and announces his candidacy for the presidency. Alhague/Gallagher is forced to attack Holt in the middle of the press conference; though shot several times by the police and the senator's bodyguards, Alhague/Gallagher is able to get close enough to use a flamethrower on Holt. As the alien emerges from Holt's charred body shocking everybody, Alhague/Gallagher kills it with his weapon before himself collapsing. Taken to the hospital where Beck is being treated, Alhague/Gallagher discovers that Beck is close to death. Witnessing the emotional suffering of Beck's wife and daughter, Alhague/Gallagher transfers his life force from Gallagher to Beck as Beck dies. When she sees her miraculously \\"recovered\\" father, Beck's daughter initially hesitates when he reaches out to her, but then smiles and takes his hand.

Writer Jim Kouf has originally expressed interest in directing, but when the studios refused, he lost interest in the script. Sholder, who saw the potential to turn it into more than an action film, did a rewrite to heighten the themes of what it means to be human. Casting for the film was difficult; they used auditions and could not cast Agent Gallagher until several days before shooting began. Sholder later called MacLachlan \\"an inspired choice\\", though he clashed with Nouri. Nouri and McLachlan both liked the script, and, during auditions, agreed to do the film if the other was involved.

The film was re-released in a set including the sequel The Hidden II in 2005. In August 2017, Warner Archive announced a special edition release of the film on Blu-Ray format. It was released on September 12, 2017. Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 78% of 27 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.91/10. Variety wrote, \\"The Hidden is a well- constructed thriller, directed with swift assurance by Jack Sholder, brought down by an utterly conventional sci-fi ending.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated it 3/4 stars and called it \\"a surprisingly effective film\\". Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, \\"The movie is mostly a series of automobile chases through Los Angeles, but there is also some humor.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times, called it \\"as unstintingly violent as it is crudely ingenious\\". Hal Hinson of The Washington Post wrote, \\"The Hidden is one of the most satisfying genre movies to hit the streets in a while.\\" In a 1992 retrospective, James M. Silver of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film did not have a long enough release to attract a proper audience but is \\"outstanding\\". It has since become a cult film. =Awards= * Jack Sholder won the Grand Prize at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in 1988. * Jack Sholder won Best Director at Fantasporto in 1988.

In commission from 1944 until 2003 she saw service in Pacific, Caribbean and Atlantic waters as well as the Great Lakes. In 1947 Bramble was present at the Nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll and in 1957 a circumnavigation of North America involved a forced traverse of the Northwest Passage. After decommissioning in 2003 Bramble became a museum ship in Port Huron, Michigan. In 2018 she was sold to a private owner, who is preparing MV Bramble to repeat her historic 1957 circumnavigation of North America. Design and construction The ship was built by the Zenith Dredge Company in Duluth, Minnesota. Brambles preliminary design was completed by the United States Lighthouse Service and the final design was produced by Marine Iron and Shipbuilding Corporation in Duluth. On 2 August 1943 the keel was laid, she was launched on 23 October 1943 and commissioned on 22 April 1944. The original cost for the hull and machinery was $925,464. Service history =1944‚Äì1957= In the spring on 1945, she departed the Great Lakes to her first homeport of San Pedro, California, to perform aids to navigation duties. Later that year, Bramble was transferred to Juneau, Alaska, for supply and aids to navigation work around the Aleutian Islands. After World War II, Brambles homeport was changed to San Francisco. Except for a brief stay in Hawaii in 1946, she remained assigned to San Francisco until 1949. From July to October 1947, Bramble participated in \\"Operation Crossroads\\", the first test of an atomic bomb's effect on surface ships, at Bikini Island. In 1949 Bramble was reassigned to San Juan, Puerto Rico and moved again in 1953 to Miami, Florida. About this time renewed interest in the Northwest Passage brought about another mission for Bramble. =Northwest Passage, 1957= The Coast Guard Cutters Bramble, and were selected to attempt a forced passage along the northern shore of Canada from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. Preparations for the difficult voyage included fitting Bramble with a stainless steel propeller and strengthening her bow to withstand tremendous pressures created by the Arctic ice pack. Bramble departed for this historic adventure from Miami on 24 May 1957 en route Seattle, Washington via the Panama Canal. On 1 July 1957 the task force departed Seattle for the Atlantic via the Bering Strait and Arctic Ocean. The ships traveled through of semi-charted water in 64 days to recross the Arctic Circle into the Atlantic. The success of the mission distinguished the three cutters as the first American surface ships to circumnavigate the North American continent. On 2 December 1957 Bramble returned to Miami. =1957‚Äì1985= In 1962 Bramble transferred to Detroit, Michigan to perform the missions of aids to navigation, search and rescue, icebreaking and law enforcement throughout the Great Lakes. Bramble completed a major renovation and overhaul in 1974, during which her engines were removed and rebuilt and her berthing areas were expanded and modernized. A new hydraulic boom was also installed. Upon completion of the major renovation in September 1975, Bramble reported to Port Huron, Michigan. In addition to her normal duties, Bramble was involved in some unique missions. She frequently served as the Patrol Commander for the Port Huron-to-Mackinac sailboat race. This race started in 1925 and is one of the largest freshwater sailboat races in the country, with an average of 300 boats competing each year. Bramble also set buoys for the International Freedom Festival in the Detroit River. =1986‚Äì1998= From December 1986 to April 1987, Bramble performed law enforcement duties in the Caribbean. Bramble was involved in six cases during which one vessel was seized, three persons arrested and 50 tons of marijuana confiscated. From June to November 1989, Bramble again underwent major renovations in Toledo, Ohio. Her original engines were replaced with General Motors electromotive Division EMD-645 V-8 diesel engines. New 200 kW ship's service generators, boilers, associated plumbing and electrical cable were also part of the project. 1994 marked the Golden (50th) Anniversary of Brambles commissioning, along with her Great Lakes sister ships , homeported in Charlevoix, Michigan, and , homeported in Duluth, Minnesota. From December 1997 to April 1998 the Bramble was involved in \\"Operation Snowbird.\\" This took the cutter to the Caribbean, where the main mission was to help train marine police of ten eastern Caribbean nations. While there, the crew also performed work on aids to navigation and participated with Venezuela in a joint law enforcement operation. During this operation Bramble steamed over 12,165 miles. =1998‚Äì2003= Aids to navigation was Brambles primary mission; aids to navigation assist the merchant fleet and private vessels in safely navigating waterways. Bramble's area of responsibility included eastern Lake Erie, southern Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay. Bramble was responsible for maintaining 187 buoys, 1 NOAA weather buoy, and three fog signals. During winter months Brambles capabilities as an icebreaker enabled her to escort ships through the ice, assist ships in distress and break ice for relief. Bramble primarily deployed twice a year for buoy operations. In late fall or early winter, Bramble spent between eight-ten weeks \\"buoy decommissioning\\" ‚Äì removing buoys and installing temporary winter marks (small buoys not normally damaged by ice). During this period approximately 101 lighted buoys would be decommissioned. Then, starting in early spring as the lake ice season began to subside, Bramble started the eight-ten week \\"buoy commissioning\\" season to replace winter marks with regular buoys. Along with commissioning the buoys, there were approximately 86 unlighted aids that had to be serviced and inspected in the spring. Her winter months were normally spent, when not icebreaking, undergoing maintenance and training; her summer months were usually spent in regularly scheduled drydock or dockside availabilities, training conferences and festival celebrations throughout the lakes. With new technology evolving, the new Juniper-class cutters began to replace the 180s'. The new cutters have the primary mission of buoy tending, but also are able to perform multiple missions like their predecessor. The 225's also are able to help with environmental cleanups, search and rescue, law enforcement and icebreaking. On 22 May 2003, Bramble was decommissioned. Her replacement was the Juniper-class cutter . =Awards= Throughout Brambles service it was awarded many awards and ribbons. She received the Department of Transportation Gold Medal, CG Unit Commendation, CG Meritorious Unit Commendation, CG \\"E\\" Ribbon, CG Bicentennial Unit Commendation, American Campaign Medal, WWII Victory Ribbon, National Defense Service Medal, Arctic Service Medal and the Special Operations Service Ribbon. Museum ship After decommissioning, Bramble became a museum ship, docked at the Seaway Terminal, donated to the Port Huron Museum, but closed to the public in 2011 due to lack of funding. In August 2012 she was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In January 2013 the ship was purchased by Robert B Klingler of Marine City, Michigan, who created the company USCGC Bramble LLC. Some restoration was carried out and the ship continued as a museum, also making occasional short voyages. Bramble was used as the basis for the White Portuguese ship featured in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Future expedition In December 2018 Bramble was sold to Tom Clarke of Roanoke, Virginia. He announced plans to send the vessel to a Mobile, Alabama shipyard in Spring 2019 to prepare her for a voyage from Miami, replicating the circumnavigation of North America in 1957, including traverse of the North West Passage.But this plan was cancelled as Bramble's new owner ran out of funds, and the ship was taken from him to be auctioned off in Mobile, Alabama. On December 4, 2019 the Bramble was sold at public auction by United States Marshals Service for $80,000 to M.A.R.S., Modern American Recycling Services, Inc.

He is best remembered for creating the character of Detective Inspector Jack Frost, who was later played by Sir David Jason in A Touch of Frost. Early life Rodney David Wingfield was born in Hackney, east London in 1928. He was educated at the Coopers' Company School and during the Second World War was evacuated to Frome, Somerset. Wingfield was exempted from National Service due to poor eyesight and had various office jobs in the East End before joining the Petrofina oil company. His first radio play, Our West Ladyton Branch was accepted by the BBC in 1968 and two more were then commissioned, at which point Wingfield resigned from his job. Inspector Frost In 1972, Macmillan Publishers invited him to write a book, and he wrote Frost at Christmas. This was rejected and not published until the early 1980s in Canada. Wingfield had originally planned to kill Frost in the first book, but he was persuaded instead to leave it as an open ending. Following this, two more Frost books were written: A Touch of Frost and Night Frost. In 1977 Frost appeared in a radio play called Three Days of Frost, in which Frost was played by Leslie Sands, a friend of Wingfield's. The books were first published in the United Kingdom in early 1989, and in 1992 Frost first appeared on television in A Touch of Frost, played by David Jason. Wingfield was never enthusiastic about the TV adaptation of his detective, once saying he had nothing against David Jason but \\"he just isn't my Frost\\". Hard Frost was published in 1995, followed by Winter Frost in 1999. Wingfield did not enjoy writing books, and much preferred writing radio scripts. In 20 years he wrote over 40 radio mystery plays, but stopped in 1988, with Hate Mail, due to the decline of radio and the success of his Frost books. As well as the many mystery plays, Wingfield also penned a comedy radio series, The Secret Life of Kenneth Williams, starring Kenneth Williams as a secret agent. Wingfield was a very private man, always avoiding book launches and publishing parties, and being rarely photographed. Other In 1982 Leslie Sands played Sergeant Fowler in Wingfield's BBC radio thriller Outbreak of Fear, a murder mystery set in the West Country. In 1987 Bob Peck starred in the Wingfield BBC radio drama Deadfall, about a demolition man whose past catches up with him. The 'winkle' postcard (sent by Inspector Frost) is most probably based on a Donald McGill seaside postcard. After a dispute with the BBC in 1984 he submitted a number of radio plays under the pseudonym \\"Arthur Jefferson\\", (the real name of Stan Laurel) one such play being The Killing Season broadcast in six-parts that same year and starring Sean Barrett, Michael Jenner, John Hollis, and Allan Cuthbertson; the serial was essentially a palimpsest of his earlier serial Outbreak of Fear. The final of his non-Inspector Frost radio plays was Hate Mail broadcast in 1988. Later years In 2002, R. D. Wingfield was diagnosed with prostate cancer. At about the same time he started writing the sixth, and final, Frost book, A Killing Frost. His wife, Phyllis Patten, whom he married in 1952, died in 2004. They had a son, Phillip. The cancer killed Wingfield in 2007, and A Killing Frost was published on 7 April 2008. All the books are now available in E-book format. In 2011, the first of four new Frost books was published with the approval of the Wingfield family. The books ‚Äî First Frost, Fatal Frost, Morning Frost, and Frost at Midnight ‚Äî are published under the name James Henry. In the case of First Frost, this pseudonym refers to James Gurbutt and Henry Sutton, but for the others it refers to Gurbutt only.

They are named for Wei-Liang Chow. A Chow variety is a variety whose points correspond to all cycles of a given projective space of given dimension and degree. Definition To define the Chow coordinates, take the intersection of an algebraic variety Z, inside a projective space, of degree d and dimension m by linear subspaces U of codimension m. When U is in general position, the intersection will be a finite set of d distinct points. Then the coordinates of the d points of intersection are algebraic functions of the Pl√ºcker coordinates of U, and by taking a symmetric function of the algebraic functions, a homogeneous polynomial known as the Chow form (or Cayley form) of Z is obtained. The Chow coordinates are then the coefficients of the Chow form. Chow coordinates can generate the smallest field of definition of a divisor. The Chow coordinates define a point in the projective space corresponding to all forms. The closure of the possible Chow coordinates is called the Chow variety.  Relation to Hilbert scheme  The Hilbert scheme is a variant of the Chow varieties. There is always a map (called the cycle map) :\\\\mathbf{Hilb} \\\\to \\\\mathbf{Cycl}, \\\\, Z \\\\mapsto [Z] from the Hilbert scheme to the Chow variety.  Chow quotient  A Chow quotient parametrizes closures of generic orbits. It is constructed as a closed subvariety of a Chow variety. Kapranov's theorem says that the moduli space \\\\overline{M}_{0, n} of stable genus-zero curves with n marked points is the Chow quotient of Grassmannian \\\\operatorname{Gr}(2, \\\\C^n) by the standard maximal torus.

Later he served as president of the Transcaucasian Sejm (February 1918 to May 1918), and he held office in the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic (April‚ÄìMay 1918). Later he became president of parliamentary assemblies of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, National Council, Constituent Assembly and Parliament (May 1918 to March 1921).. Early life and family Chkheidze was born to an aristocratic family in Puti, Kutais Governorate (in the present-day Zestafoni Municipality of the Imereti province of Georgia).

Chkheidze, Irakly Tsereteli, Datiko Sharashidze, and Kale Kavtaradze formed a group called Oppozitsia. In their mind, the Red Army and Cheka were too strong, and the unarmed Georgian people too weak. After the August Uprising of 1924, 10,000 Georgians were executed, and between 50,000 and 100,000 Georgians were deported to Siberia or to Central Asia.

Founded in 1851, it was located near the former eastern German city of Stettin, today Polish Szczecin. Because of the limited facilities in Stettin, in 1907 an additional yard was built in Hamburg. The now named Vulcan-Werke Hamburg und Stettin Actiengesellschaft constructed some of the most famous civilian German ships and it played a significant role in both World Wars, building warships for the Kaiserliche Marine and the Kriegsmarine later. Both yards became members of the Deschimag in the 1920s. The Stettin shipyard was closed in 1928, opened again in 1939. During World War II it exploited slave workers, and after the war, was taken over by the Polish government, while the Hamburg yard was sold to Howaldtswerke AG in 1930 and the Locomotive Department was sold to Borsig in Berlin History Chinese Imperial Beiyang Fleet A.G. Vulcan Stettin was founded 1851 as Schiffswerft und Maschinenfabrik Fr√ºchtenicht & Brock by the two young engineers Franz F. D. Fr√ºchtenicht and Franz W. Brock in the little village Bredow, which later became suburb of the eastern German city of Stettin. Its first ship was the small iron paddle steamer, named Die Dievenow for the service between the cities of Stettin and Swinem√ºnde. Several small vessels followed, while the yard continuously was enlarged. When the yard went into financial problems, in 1857 the company was taken over by some entrepreneurs and politicians from Stettin and Berlin which founded the new company Stettiner Maschinenbau Actien-Gesellschaft Vulcan. Ship construction was continued, but the solution of the financial trouble was expected by additionally constructing locomotives. A subsidiary company was founded, called Abteilung Locomotivbau in Bredow bei Stettin. In 1859 the first locomotive was delivered; all together the company built about 4,000 units in Stettin until it was sold to the Berlin company Borsig. In the future larger and larger ships were built, the facilities in Stettin could no longer sustain the scale of the operations. The yard built the s. Thus a new shipyard was built in Hamburg between 1907 and 1909. From 1911, it was named Vulcan-Werke Hamburg und Stettin Actiengesellschaft. The Hamburg yard was the scene of a week-long strike in 1918 which was only brought to a close through the reading of the War Clauses.A Life =Automatic transmissions for motor vehicles= Gustav Bauer, director of the marine engine section, supervised the work of Hermann F√∂ttinger on the Fottinger hydraulic transmitter known as Vulcan Coupling and Vulcan Drive or fluid coupling. In 1924, Vulcan's Hermann Rieseler invented one of the first automatic transmissions, which had a two- speed planetary gearbox, torque converter, and lockup clutch; it never entered production., p. 62. (The less-sophisticated Hydra-Matic, which used a simple fluid coupling, was an available option on Oldsmobiles in 1940.) The original coupling further developed in collaboration with Harold Sinclair of Fluidrive Engineering of Isleworth for Daimler of Coventry and matched with a manually controlled epicyclic gearbox went into production in England in 1929.page 76, Smith, Brian E.

The AG Vulcan Stettin had been closed. =New enterprise= 1939 a new company - also named Vulcan - was founded on the site of the former Stettin-shipyard. All together 34 construction numbers were started in the following years, including 18 type-VII C submarines. But because of the war only a few ships could be launched and completed. Among these were two submarines, but only one of them () was ever in service while the second one () was destroyed by allied air attacks before. During the war the yard exploited slave workers and had its own prisoner camp, part of the prisoner population engaged in anti-Nazi resistance, successfully sabotaging several constructed shipsRepatriacje i migracje ludno≈õci pogranicza w XX wieku: stan bada≈Ñ oraz ≈∫r√≥d≈Ça do dziej√≥w pogranicza polsko-litewsko- bia≈Çoruskiego Henryk Majecki,page 79, Archiwum Pa≈Ñstwowe,2004Wojskowy Przeglad Historyczny, page 210, 1967 After World War II the slave workers were freed and the shipyard was finally taken over by the Polish government and the new Szczecin Shipyard was started at this site.

Washington (August 31, 1918 ‚Äì June 24, 1971) was an American professional football player who was the first African-American to sign a contract with a National Football League (NFL) team in the modern (post-World War II) era. He played college football for the UCLA Bruins. Early life Kenneth S. Washington was born in Los Angeles and grew up in the city's Lincoln Heights neighborhood, the son of Edgar \\"Blue\\" Washington, who played Negro league baseball, but he was raised by his grandmother Susie and his uncle Rocky, the first black uniformed lieutenant in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). He was a star at both baseball and football at Abraham Lincoln High School, where he was nicknamed \\"Kingfish\\" after a character in the radio show Amos 'n' Andy, and led both teams to city championships in the same calendar year. College career Washington attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he was a member of both the Bruins' baseball and football teams. As a baseball player, Washington was rated better than his teammate Jackie Robinson. One story has it that Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher wanted to offer Washington a contract to play for the team, but only if he went to Puerto Rico first, which Washington refused to do. In football, his position was tailback, and he often passed as much as he rushed. Washington rushed for 9,975 yards in his college career, a school record for 56 years. He was one of four African American players on the 1939 UCLA Bruins football team, the others being Woody Strode, Robinson, and Ray Bartlett. Washington, Strode, and Robinson made up three of the four backfield players that year. This was a rarity to have so many African Americans when only a few dozen at all played on college football teams. The Bruins played eventual conference and national champion USC to a 0-0 tie with the 1940 Rose Bowl on the line. It was the first UCLA‚ÄìUSC rivalry football game with national implications. UCLA teammates have commented how strong Washington was when confronted with racial slurs and discrimination. Washington was the first Bruin to lead the nation in total offense and became the first consensus All- American in the history of the school's football program in 1939. Despite these achievements and the fact that he also doubled as a defensive back, he was named to second-team All-America selection instead of the first and was omitted from the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game that year. These slights were the source of much outrage among media outlets which blamed them on racial discrimination. According to Time magazine's coverage of the 1940 College All- Star Game, Washington was \\"considered by West Coast fans the most brilliant player in the US last year.\\" Professional football After graduation, George Halas, who coached the College All-Star Game, indicated interest in Washington for his Chicago Bears team, but was unable to convince the league to permit integration. Instead, Washington coached football at UCLA and joined the LAPD. From 1940 to 1945, Washington played for the Hollywood Bears of the Pacific Coast Professional Football League, where he was the league's highest- paid player. He earned all-league recognition each year, including his first year when he suffered a knee injury that prevented him from being conscripted for the war. Ezzrett Anderson and Washington's UCLA teammate Strode were also on that team. In 1945, he did serve in the military on the USO tour as a type of sports ambassador, visiting with troops and playing in exhibition games. When the Cleveland Rams moved to Los Angeles, the team sought to play in the publicly owned Los Angeles Memorial Coliseuma decision which created immediate pressure that the team be racially integrated, since black taxpayers as well as white had paid for construction of the facility. The Los Angeles Tribune was especially outspoken, thanks to its African-American sports editor, William Claire \\"Halley\\" Harding, a former professional athlete and member of the debate team at Wiley College. As a result, the team signed Washington on 1946, followed by Strode on . Prior to his first NFL season Washington underwent surgery in both knees (his fifth knee surgery overallas a child he contracted rickets and was once hit by car), having torn cartilage removed from his left knee and what was characterized in the press as \\"a growth\\" from his right. He played for the Rams for three years, but although his injuries had taken their toll, he was still able to lead the league in yards per carry in his second season, and even scored a 92-yard touchdown, which remains the Rams team record for the longest run from scrimmage. When he retired in 1948, 80,000 people attended his final game and the entire stadium gave him a standing ovation. Later years Washington was a staunch Republican in his younger years and strongly supported Richard Nixon's 1950 U.S. Senate campaign. The night before Nixon's crushing victory over Congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, the candidatea great football fanspent the evening at Washington's south Los Angeles home playing music and trying to relax. However, in the 1960 presidential election, Washington voted for John F. Kennedy instead of Nixon and tended to vote for Democrats for the rest of his life, but he never declared a political party affiliation. After retirement from football, Washington returned to the LAPD. He also worked for a grocery store chain and a whiskey distributor, and was a part-time scout for the Los Angeles Dodgers, where his son Kenny Jr. played. Thanks to his connections from when he had worked at movie studios during his undergraduate years, he was also chosen for a few film roles, including Rope of Sand (1949), Pinky (1949), and The Jackie Robinson Story (1950). Death and legacy Washington died of polyarteritis nodosa on June 24, 1971, at the age of 52 in Los Angeles, California. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery. For his contribution to sports in Los Angeles, he was honored with a Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum \\"Court of Honor\\" plaque by the Coliseum commissioners.\\"Los Angeles Coliseum Court of Honor Plaques\\" on the Coliseum website He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1956 and his number 13 jersey was the first to be retired at UCLA. He was posthumously inducted into the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame. His alma mater Lincoln High School has annually awarded the Kenny Washington Trophy to the school's best football player since 1949. One legacy of Washington's and Strode's experience in the NFL ‚Äì paralleled in 1946 by racial trailblazers Marion Motley and Bill Willis in the rival All-America Football Conference ‚Äì was that Branch Rickey, president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, saw that blacks and whites could coexist in a violent sport without much disruption, and decided that Major League Baseball could be integrated as well. He signed Washington's and Strode's UCLA teammate Jackie Robinson to the Dodgers in 1947. However, for many years, Washington was ignored by the NFL and the story of professional football's postwar integration received little attention. One reason is because for most of the 20th century, baseball was by far the top sport in the U.S., and another was that his NFL career was a short three years. Neither Washington nor Strode has been inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, although both Marion Motley and Bill Willis of the AAFC's and NFL's Cleveland Browns have received that honor. Every year since 2011, Abraham Lincoln High School holds a memorial football game on the anniversary of Washington's death.

He was voted in by 35 leaders representing seven political parties and eleven interest groups. Biography Amos Claudius Sawyer was born in 1945 to Abel and Sarah Sawyer; his siblings include Joe Sawyer. The Sawyers were a prominent family in Sinoe County, with free African-American ancestors who came as colonists to what was called \\"Maryland in Africa\\", founded by the Maryland Colonization Society. The colony became independent as the Republic of Maryland before joining Liberia in 1857. Sawyer was educated in local schools and was a 1966 graduate of Liberia College (now the University of Liberia) He traveled to the United States for graduate work, earning M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in political science from Northwestern University in metropolitan Chicago, Illinois. After his return, Dr. Sawyer worked as an academic, but also became an activist and politician. He ran for the position of Mayor of Monrovia, the capital, as an independent rather than within the True Whig Party.\\"Sawyer Appointed Acting Dean,\\" The Sunday People 1979-12-02: 1. The latter had dominated the country for more than 100 years. After the 1980 coup d'√©tat, Sawyer returned to academia for a time, taking a position as a professor of political science at the University of Liberia. In December 1980, he was appointed Dean of the College of Social Sciences and acting director of the University.\\"Dr. Amos Sawyer Get [sic] Top Academic Post,\\" New Liberian 1980-12-05: 8. He was a founding member of the Movement for Justice in Africa (MOJA) and in 1983 founded the Liberian People's Party. In the period after the abduction (and eventual murder) of president Samuel Doe, from 9 September 1990 until 22 November 1990, principal mutineer Prince Johnson and co-conspirator Charles Taylor both made claims on the presidency. In late August an emergency conference was held in The Gambia by a delegation of 35 Liberians representing seven political parties and eleven interest groups. They voted Sawyer as interim president and Bishop Roland Diggs as vice-president, to establish a government. In 1992, Sawyer wrote The Emergence of Autocracy in Liberia: Tragedy and Challenge, in this book, he depicts how dictatorial control rose up out of a custom of patrimonial power, with the privileges of administration tirelessly brought together and amassed in the possession of progressive presidents. This example of absolutism, which was not in itself oppressive, finished in the military tyranny. Such leaders extended Sawyer's one-year appointment for four years during the civil war fought against rebels led largely by Taylor, Johnson, and David Nimley. In 1994, Sawyer was forced to step down as a part of the peace process, and subsequently the role of official leader of Liberia was held not by the president, but by the Chairmen of the Council of State. Fighting sparked again in 1996, and continued during Charles Taylor's presidency from 1997 to 2003. Sawyer returned to the US for a period, invited to serve as Associate Director and Research Scholar, Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis in the Department of Political Science at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana. Sawyer is Chairman of the Governance Reform Commission in Liberia, which has recently become the Governance Commission. His book, Beyond Plunder: Toward Democratic Governance in Liberia (2005), explored the development of multi-party democracy in the country. He supported Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in the October 2005 and 2011 elections. Legacy and honors *Sawyer was awarded the Gusi Peace Prize in 2011.

He was arrested for cocaine possession in his native Dominican Republic between the 1983 and 1984 seasons and did not rejoin the Braves until May 1984. He often drew the ire of his opponents, using an imaginary finger gun to shoot opponents and would pound the baseball into the ground. While it is customary for pitchers to walk back to the bench after completing an inning, he would run full speed to the dugout (gold chains and long, curly locks bouncing) after an inning- ending strikeout. He eventually added the \\"Pascual pitch\\" (his version of the \\"eephus\\") to his repertoire. He was also involved in more than one beanball incident, most notably an August 12, 1984 brawl with the San Diego Padres where he hit the Padres' Alan Wiggins with his first pitch leading off the game, inciting each San Diego pitcher in the game to throw at him each time he came to bat. He had just received his drivers license and earned the nicknames 'Perimeter Pascual' and 'Wrong-Way Perez' after missing a start on August 19, 1982, while circling Atlanta's Interstate 285 (a ring road/beltway) 3 times looking for Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium, he ran out of gas and arrived at the ballpark 10 minutes late. Released by the Braves on April 1, 1986, he missed the entire 1986 season. After signing a minor league contract with the Expos in 1987, he joined them in August and finished the 1987 season 7‚Äì0 with an outstanding 2.30 ERA. His last winning season came the following year when he went 12‚Äì8 and posted a 2.44 ERA with the Expos. P√©rez threw a five-inning rain-shortened no-hitter against the Phillies on September 24, 1988. It was the first no-hitter in Veterans Stadium history. P√©rez allowed one walk, and another Phillies baserunner reached on an error. Umpire Harry Wendelstedt waved off the game after a 90-minute rain delay after the game was stopped by rain with one out in the top of the sixth. However, due to a statistical rule change in 1991, no-hitters must last at least nine innings to count. As a result of the retroactive application of the new rule, this game and thirty- five others are no longer considered no-hitters. He was granted free agency in November 1989 and signed with the Yankees. Through 1990 and 1991, he started only 17 games for the Yankees and compiled records of 1‚Äì2 and 2‚Äì4 respectively. Prior to the 1992 season, he was suspended by Major League Baseball for one year for violating the league's drug policy, a suspension that ended his career. His career record was 67‚Äì68. Two of his brothers, M√©lido and Carlos, were also major league pitchers, as was a cousin, Yorkis. He also was married for 16 years and has two daughters. Pascual first made his trademark peek through the legs to check the runner on first in 1979 in the Dominican League.

It was created in response to Nintendo's Super Scope and as Sega's successor to the Master System Light Phaser. The gun is built from three detachable parts (pistol, shoulder stock, sights), and communicates with the television via an infrared sensor. The Menacer was announced at the May 1992 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago and was released later that year. The gun was bundled with a pack-in six-game cartridge of mostly shooting gallery games. Sega also released a Menacer bundle with Terminator 2: The Arcade Game. Sega producer Mac Senour was responsible for the Menacer project and designed the six-game pack. He originally proposed non-shooting minigames based on existing Sega licenses like Joe Montana, David Robinson, and ToeJam & Earl, but most of the prototypes were abandoned due to high cost in favor of more shooting-type games. Sega did not plan another first-party release for the Menacer apart from the included multicart. Compatible games were published through 1995. The Menacer is remembered as a critical and commercial flop. Critics found the six-game pack subpar and repetitive, and criticized the peripheral's lack of games. The ToeJam & Earl spinoff game was held in the highest regard, and reviewers recommended the Menacer-compatible Terminator 2 game. A direct-to-TV light gun that includes the six-game Menacer pack was released in 2005.  Description  alt=Black video game console with top-loading slot and single, wired controller with directional pad and four buttons The gray, white, and red Menacer is a light gun peripheral for the Sega Genesis. The Menacer is built of three separable parts: a pistol, twin sights, and shoulder stock. (In the peripheral's branding, these parts were called the Master Module, Binocular Module, and Stabilizer Module, respectively.) The pistol has a double grip and fires the infrared beam with a trigger on the back grip. There are three buttons on the pistol's front grip: one pauses the game and the other two provide game-specific functions. Unlike the Super Scope, the Menacer has two infrared transmitters. The optional skeletal shoulder stock and binocular twin sights were designed to improve the aim. Digital Spy reported that the twin sights never worked as intended, and Sega Force wrote that the gun must be recalibrated when adding or removing the sights. Calibration is performed by aiming at a bullseye target to adjust the gun's sensitivity. The gun was designed to be reassembled to suit the player. The light gun's shots are controlled by its aim towards the television. It operates on batteries and works in conjunction with a sensor plugged into the second controller port and placed atop the television display. The sensor counts CRT television scan lines to detect the player's shots. Sega Force noticed that the controller acts erratically when used under fluorescent lighting. Sega recommended of distance from the receiver, though the peripheral works between from the television. Sega Force reported that the controller lasts about 18 hours on new batteries, though Will Smith of The Hawk Eye estimated fewer (\\"a matter of hours\\"). The Toronto Star wrote that the Menacer lasts 20 hours as opposed to the Super Scope's 50 to 140 hours. The Menacer has no power switch: it automatically activates when aimed at the television and turns off after 30 seconds without input. The Super Scope fully drains its batteries when left on. Menacer's Accu-Sight option puts crosshairs on the screen to eliminate the need to aim manually through the sights. The gun does not have a \\"turbo\\" mode for continuous fire, unlike the Super Scope.  History  alt=Bazooka-shaped, gray light gun with built-in shoulder support and orange accents, gray scope attached and forward grip alt=Chunky, bright orange light gun with black RCA cables attached The Menacer was produced in response to the Nintendo Super Scope released several months earlier, though Sega intended to support the peripheral as more than a clone. These two peripherals brought arcade light gun game ports to home consoles. The Menacer is the successor to the Master System's Light Phaser. Mac Senour, a producer at Sega, was responsible for the peripheral and its six-game cartridge as the company's \\"hardware boy\\". He designed the six minigames based on Sega's previous intellectual property and licenses‚Äîsuch as ToeJam & Earl‚Äîunder the instruction to avoid shooting games. His prototypes included games based on Joe Montana (Joe Montana Wide Receiver Training Camp) and David Robinson, but when presented, the company asked for more shooting games and scrapped all license-based games (besides ToeJam & Earl, whose license was free) due to their added cost. His \\"reverse Blockout game\\" prototype was the only other title carried to the final cartridge. Senour recalled that upon his cubicle presentation to Sega Japan's president, the executive did not say anything besides \\"very good\\" before leaving. Sega did not plan any other first-party releases for the Menacer‚ÄîSenour recollected that \\"they laughed when I proposed more.\\" Sega announced the Menacer alongside the Sega CD at the May 1992 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago and the peripheral was released towards the end of that year. By December 1992, the Menacer began shipping with Terminator 2: The Arcade Game as a bundle. Goodby, Silverstein & Partners produced Menacer television advertisements directed by Danny Boyle. Playthings reported that Chicago toy retailers promoted Sega electronics including the Menacer over Nintendo's during their 1992 Thanksgiving promotions. Sega's sales exceeded Nintendo's during the 1992 Christmas season, and gained cultural cachet for the Menacer among other peripherals. Electronic Gaming Monthly reported in March 1993 that the Menacer would not have a new game for six months. Compatible games were published through 1995. Mac Senour left Sega in 1993 for Atari, where he received an increase in pay and status. He later worked at Konami and Electronic Arts. In his first days at Atari, Senour was sent to Paris, where he remembered an excess of unsold Menacers in a Virgin Megastore display. His translators told the clerk that Senour was responsible for the Menacer, and when Senour offered to autograph their stock, the clerk replied in slow English that Senour could autograph the items he purchased. In 2005, Radica created a Menacer-based direct-to-TV dedicated console with the original six-game cartridge built into a light gun controller as part of their Play TV Legends line of Sega Genesis dedicated consoles. Retro Gamer wrote that Radica's gun is based on the Sega Saturn light gun's design and not the Menacer's.  Games  alt=Screenshots of six minigames (clockwise): a black screen with visible circle showing bugs eating a pizza; a purple, blue, and green space setting with craters and coffin-shaped pods reveal aliens; two-tone rectangles form a rectangle around a puck and a controllable mallet against a psychedelic backdrop; a street scene shows a brownstone apartment building with a \\"BANG\\" explosion in a window; a desert setting with mountain backdrop has green tanks and armored vehicles in the foreground; a tomato hurtles towards characters in a vivid and colorful field Games include the pack-in single-player Menacer 6-game cartridge, which consists of mostly shooting gallery games: * Ready, Aim, Tomatoes! is a spin-off of the original ToeJam & Earl where the player (as ToeJam) fires tomatoes at ToeJam & Earl series enemies for points as the screen scrolls. The scroll speed increases with game duration. The enemies‚Äîdentists, devils, and cupids‚Äîreturn fire throughout the ten levels. The game also features power-ups and lock-on targeting, to aid in player accuracy. * In Rockmans Zone, the screen scrolls through streets of houses as the player shoots criminals and refrains from shooting innocent bystanders, for which the player loses a life. In later levels, the criminals return fire faster. * Space Station Defender is similar to Tomatoes! with added memory aspects. In each level, players shoot enemy-filled pods as up to eight drop in a memorizable sequence. There are 999 levels, a Power Zone to charge shots, and power-ups including extra shields. * Whack Ball is comparable to Breakout: the player controls a large ball with the Menacer to push a smaller on-screen ball into color-changing bricks that line the wall. One all of the bricks change color, the player moves to the next level. Some bricks are power-ups that change the larger ball's size or add extra small balls into play. Players who hit flashing bricks are punished. Inadvertently guiding the ball through a hole in the wall ends the game. * In Front Line, the player defends against tanks and airplanes with a machine gun and missiles with unlimited ammo. * In Pest Control, the player's vision is limited to a small area of the screen around the Accu-Sight crosshairs while looking for cockroaches that attempt to eat an on-screen pizza. Two different power-ups briefly illuminate the screen and clear all bugs onscreen. Later levels feature larger insects that contain bombs and small, fast bugs. Digital Spy mentioned Body Count, Terminator 2: The Arcade Game, and Mad Dog McCree as Menacer's other notable games. Terminator 2 was the first external game to work with the Menacer, the only one confirmed as of December 1992. Terminator programmers, Probe Software, later began work on another Menacer-compatible game. Terminator 2 has a two- player mode that uses one Menacer light gun and one controller. Sega Force reported that Menacer gameplay registered faster than the Genesis controller. Mad Dog McCree, a live action Wild West shoot 'em up for the Sega CD, used either a controller or a choice of several light guns: the Menacer, the Konami Justifier, or the game developer's own compatible light gun. In the 1994 Body Count, the player defends Earth from an alien invasion. The Irish Times wrote that the game is \\"ideally suited for the ... Menacer\\" and is \\"to be avoided\\" otherwise. The Menacer is also compatible with Corpse Killer and American Laser Games' other titles, such as Who Shot Johnny Rock? The light gun does not work with Konami's Lethal Enforcers games or Snatcher, which use the Konami Justifier. {class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders collapsible uncollapsed\\" style=\\"width: 500px\\" +List of Menacer-compatible games by release date !scope=\\"column\\"Title !scope=\\"column\\"Release date (console) - !scope=\\"row\\"Menacer 6-game cartridge June 1, 1992 (Genesis) - !scope=\\"row\\"Terminator 2: The Arcade Game June 6, 1992 (Genesis) - !scope=\\"row\\"Mad Dog McCree April 22, 1993 (Sega CD) - !scope=\\"row\\"Body Count 1994 (Mega Drive, Sega Channel) - !scope=\\"row\\"Who Shot Johnny Rock?

Reynolds added that the Menacer was hurt by the poor quality of the pack-in six-game cartridge and a lack of titles in support of the peripheral. Will Smith of The Hawk Eye concurred, calling the peripheral \\"a commercial and critical flop\\". The Menacer's original reviewers pinned the device's success on the strength of its developer support, and multiple reviewers cited the Menacer's lack of good games as the cause for its decline. Writing for the Chicago Tribune on the 1992 Consumer Electronics Show, Dennis Lynch saw the Super Scope and Menacer as a continuation of a Nintendo‚ÄìSega arms race and wrote that the peripheral's \\"Uzi attachment\\" was \\"just what every kid needs\\". The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Andy Pargh said the Menacer was \\"definitely a winner\\" in comparison to the Super Scope. Toronto Star William Burrill wrote that the \\"Great Zapper War\\" would be decided by the strength of the light guns' supporting games. Multiple reviewers ultimately recommended that players wait for more games to be released before purchasing the Menacer. William Burrill of the Toronto Star said not to bother unless the player \\"absolutely love[s] target shooter games\\". Mean Machines called the Menacer \\"an expensive novelty\\" until it had more games. The Herald Sun wrote in August 1993 that the Menacer looked to be \\"an expensive, limited-use fad\\". GamePro considered the gun \\"well-designed\\" and \\"fairly good-looking\\", though they wrote that the gun's options buttons were inconvenient and that the Menacer's lengthy recalibrations before play sessions without Accu-Sight were tedious. Mean Machines wrote that the gun's shades of gray clashed with the glossy black console. Several reviewers called the binocular scope addition unhelpful. Paul Mellerick of Mega found the manual sights an eyestrain and the gun \\"deadly accurate\\" as long as players used the Accu-Sight mode. Still, as of January 1993, Mega felt that the Menacer's future success was doubtless. Jaz of Mean Machines had low expectations for the Menacer, which he compared to the shortcomings of previous light guns: high price, short-lived novelty, and dearth of games. Gus of Mean Machines wrote that \\"Sega hasn't learned the lessons\\" from the Super Scope's \\"fairly naff\\" release in the magazine's January 1993 Menacer review, calling the light gun a \\"samey-looking, samey- playing piece of hardware, with some redundant add-ons\\" with mediocre launch titles. He added that the Menacer was less tiring to use than the Super Scope, praised the Menacer's infrared, and criticized the gun's lack of available software. Multiple reviewers found the pack-in six-game cartridge games subpar and repetitive. Mean Machines Gus wrote that the games were all too simple and easy. Of the pack, reviewers held Ready, Aim, Tomatoes! in the highest regard. Ray Barnholt of 1UP.com wrote that the Menacer's games were \\"duller\\" than its competitor Super Scope's already dull games, but Tomatoes! gave Sega's cartridge \\"some pittance of value\\". Mega rated the ToeJam & Earl spin-off at 62%, calling it \\"fun and strange\\" though \\"rather repetitive\\". Sega Force thought the game's graphics were the pack's best, and its audio to be of high quality, though the magazine also considered the game repetitive. GamePro thought the game's colors were oversaturated. As for the other six-pack titles, Mega called Rockmans Zone \\"not a very inspiring game\\" for its slow pacing and \\"bland\\" graphics. Reviewers compared the game to Hogan's Alley and Empire City: 1931. Mega called Space Station Defender concept \\"incredibly daft\\". GamePro criticized Space Station Defender \\"washed-out and ugly\\" graphics and \\"obnoxious\\" audio. The magazine thought poorly of most of the cartridge's audio. Mega found Whack Ball easy and did not expect players to maintain interest in it for longer than an hour. Sega Visions compared Whack Ball to Arkanoid. Mega wrote that Front Line was programmed poorly with \\"the appearance of having never met up with a gamestester\\", calling it \\"truly awful\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly and GamePro compared the game to Operation Wolf. Sega Force rated Front Line lowest within the six-pack, with a score of 22%. The magazine wrote that the bug game, Pest Control, would make players bored after ten minutes, and Mega said the game was not worth loading even once, giving it their lowest rating of the bunch: 12%. Sega Force wrote in February that the games were only fun for an hour and that the peripheral's success would depend on its future games, adding, \\"Without that [developer] support, it will die as surely as all other attempts at light guns have done.\\" The magazine ultimately recommended against purchase until more games were released. Sega Force Paul Wooding considered Terminator 2 a \\"must\\" for Menacer owners, adding that it far surpassed the quality of the six-pack games. The magazine added that the gun registered shots faster than the controller, was more accurate, and worked well from a distance. Neil West of Mega wrote the Menacer works well with Terminator 2 in his review of the game. The Hawk Eye Will Smith wrote in 2010 that the six-game pack and Terminator 2 were the only Menacer games readily accessible. Ken Horowitz of Sega-16 wrote that none of the Menacer-compatible titles were exceptional, though Terminator and Body Count were standouts. He added that the Menacer's small library made collecting easier. Edward Fox of The Centre for Computing History has said that the museum's Menacer is his favorite piece in the collection when used with the Aura Interactor haptic suit.

He was the son of Pierre Camus, a lawyer in the Parlement of Paris. Camus is considered the founder of the Archives Nationales, as in 1789 he was appointed as archivist of its predecessor, the Commission des archives of the Assembly (Estates-General). He served in this role until his death. French Revolution In 1789 Camus was elected by the Third Estate of Paris to the Estates-General; he attracted attention by his speeches against social inequalities. He was one of the National Assembly's earliest presidents (28 October11 November 1789), and he was the most frequent speaker: no one addressed the Assembly more times than he did (more than 600 times); d'Andr√© is second at 497, and le Chapelier third at 447. Camus was so frequently called upon to speak mostly because of his expertise in canon law. Camus was appointed on 14 August 1789 as archivist to the Commission des archives of the Assembly; the commission was the immediate precursor to the Archives Nationales. He would retain these functions until his death. He helped to write and voted for the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, worked to end the practice of paying annates to the papacy, and promoted the annexation of the Vaucluse by France. On 30 July 1791, he obtained the abolition of titles of nobility. Elected to the National Convention by the d√©partement of Haute- Loire, he was on a mission outside Paris during the judgment of Louis XVI. But, he wrote on 13 January 1793 that he voted for \\"death without appeal and without reprieve\\". On his return, Camus was sent to Belgium as one of five commissioners of the Convention, to the Arm√©e du Nord commanded by General C. F. Dumouriez. The general was in an extremely precarious position, and was suspected of plotting to betray the Revolution. The suspicions were confirmed when Dumouriez delivered Camus with his colleagues to the Austrians (3 April 1793). After thirty-three months of captivity, Camus was exchanged for Marie Th√©r√®se of France in November 1795. He played an inconspicuous role in the Council of Five Hundred, refusing positions in the Ministry of Finance or of Police. He was restored to the office of archivist in 1796 and became absorbed in literary work. He remained an austere republican, refusing to take part in the Napoleonic r√©gime.

The song originated from \\"John the Revelator,\\" a song written by Dave Matthews with the help from Carlos Santana. Matthews and Santana wrote \\"John the Revelator\\" as a love song about someone calling out to their unattainable lover. The \\"John the Revelator\\" lines that originally appeared in the song were suggested by Santana who got the idea from the traditional gospel song of the same name. History \\"JTR\\" began as \\"John the Revelator,\\" which first appeared live as a tease played twice during a show on November 30, 1998. Afterwards, the song was played in full a total five times ‚Äì twice in acoustic set by Matthews and Tim Reynolds, and three times with the full band and various guests, such as The Lovely Ladies, B√©la Fleck, and the band Santana. After its final performance in May 1999, the song was taken to the recording studio with producer Steve Lillywhite in the beginning of 2000. The band reworked \\"John the Revelator\\" by changing a few chords, and most notably, dropping a portion of the chorus, which contained the following verse: Since the title's line was dropped from the lyrics, the band renamed the song to \\"JTR\\" and recorded it for the album which eventually became leaked on the internet as The Lillywhite Sessions. Although the band never officially released the song, \\"JTR\\" began showing in live setlists on the band's summer tour in 2000. The song became popular among fans and was played live during many shows up until the end of the summer tour in 2001, following the release of Everyday. A performance of the song was recorded for the live album and video, Live at Folsom Field, Boulder, Colorado, along with many songs from Everyday. In 2002, Dave Matthews Band went back into the recording studio to rerecord the songs for their album Busted Stuff, which previously leaked out as The Lillywhite Sessions. According to producer Stephen Harris, \\"JTR\\" was abandoned very early in the studio, and therefore did not appear on the album. Following the recording sessions, the song was no longer played live, except for a small tease during a show in 2003. In an interview in July 2004, bassist Stefan Lessard claimed that the band agreed that they did not like \\"JTR,\\" and that it would probably never be played again. Despite Lessard's comment about the band's feeling towards the song in 2004, \\"JTR\\" was once again played live for the first time in over five years during an encore at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, about one month before the band's summer tour in 2006. The performance was a surprise to many fans who thought the song would never again be played, especially after the comment made by Lessard two years earlier. The song was once again brought back to setlists and was played 17 times during the tour with guest Rashawn Ross, including one performance where it was the opening song. In response to many fans' comments about how Lessard claimed the song was dead, Lessard posted a bulletin on his MySpace page saying that he didn't recall saying so, and he was most likely being sarcastic if he did. After another absence of three years from setlists, \\"JTR\\" was once again played live to open the 2010 summer tour at the Comcast Theatre in Hartford, CT, and was part of setlist rotation for the rest of the tour. After being absent in from setlists in 2011 and 2012, JTR returned on May 26, 2013. After a few more plays in 2013, the song went away again until 2018, where it was played twice. \\"JTR\\" was played once during the 2019 Europe tour, marking the first time since 2000 and 2001 that the song had been played in consecutive years. On May 18, 2019 in Dallas, due to the ongoing thunderstorm and fan requests, the song was played despite not being on the planned setlist. JTR was again played in Charlotte, NC on July 19, 2019, immediately after a prolonged lightning delay. Live releases In addition to the performance from the live album and video, Live at Folsom Field, Boulder, Colorado, live versions of \\"JTR\\" also appears on 2004's exclusive release for members of the Warehouse Fan Association, as well as the live albums, Live Trax Vol. 3, Live Trax Vol. 11, Live Trax Vol. 16, Live Trax Vol. 31, and Live Trax Vol. 45.

During World War II, he was the Italian Viceroy of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI). Biography Amedeo was born in Turin, Piedmont, to Prince Emanuele Filiberto, 2nd Duke of Aosta (son of Amadeo I of Spain and Princess Maria Vittoria), and Princess H√©l√®ne (daughter of Prince Philippe of Orl√©ans and Princess Marie Isabelle of Orl√©ans). As his patrilinal great-grandfather was King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, he was a member of the House of Savoy. He was known from birth by the courtesy title of Duke of Apulia. Amedeo was a very tall man. According to Amedeo Guillet, he was once referred to by a journalist as \\"Your Highness\\" (which in Italian could also be interpreted to mean \\"your height\\"). The Duke replied in jest: \\"198 centimetres\\" (6 feet, 6 inches). =Education and early military career= Amedeo was educated at St David's College, Reigate, Surrey, in England.Hanson, The Wandering Princess, 161. The school is often mis- identified as St Andrew's College. He cultivated British mannerisms, spoke Oxford English, and even enjoyed the pastimes of fox hunting and polo. Amedeo entered the Nunziatella, the military academy in Naples, joined the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) and fought with distinction in the artillery during World War I. He left the army in 1921 and traveled widely in Africa. Amedeo subsequently rejoined the Italian armed forces and became a pilot. In 1932, he joined the Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica). Amedeo served under Marshall Rodolfo Graziani and Libyan Governor Pietro Badoglio during later stages of the pacification of Libya (1911 to 1932). Amedeo and his fellow airmen harried the Senussi forces of Omar Mukhtar from the sky.Time Magazine, Muktar When hostilities in Libya came to an end in early 1932, much was made of the participation of the \\"Duke of Apulia\\" as the commander of the airmen who forced the Senussi to flee Libya and seek relief in Egypt.Time Magazine, Peace in Libya Amedeo, portrayed by the tall actor Sky du Mont, appears in several non-flying scenes with Graziani in the movie The Lion of the Desert,Lion of the Desert - Wikipedia Lion of the Desert about the Italian conquest of Libya. On 4 July 1931, upon the death of his father, Amedeo became the Duke of Aosta. =Viceroy and governor-general= In 1937, after the Italian conquest of Ethiopia during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, the Duke of Aosta replaced Marshal Graziani as Viceroy and as Governor-General of Italian East Africa. It was generally conceded that he was a vast improvement over Graziani. As Viceroy and Governor-General, the Duke of Aosta was also the Commander-in-Chief of all Italian military forces in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Italian Somaliland. =World War II= The Duke of Aosta surrenders to British officials. When Italy declared war on the United Kingdom and France on 10 June 1940, the Duke of Aosta became the commander of the Italian forces in what is known as the East African Campaign of World War II. He oversaw the initial Italian advances into the Sudan and Kenya and, in August, he oversaw the Italian invasion of British Somaliland.Time Magazine, War Without Water In January 1941, the British launched a counter-invasion and the Italians went on the defensive in East Africa. The Italians fought throughout February. But, after fierce resistance, the Battle of Keren ended in Italian defeat,Time Magazine, Last Act in East Africa after which the rest of Eritrea, including the port of Massawa, fell quickly. On 31 January, the Duke of Aosta reported that the Italian military forces in East Africa were down to 67 operational aircraft with limited fuel stocks. With supplies running low and with no chance of re-supply, the Duke of Aosta opted to concentrate the remaining Italian forces into several strongholds: Gondar, Amba Alagi, Dessie, and Gimma. He himself commanded the 7,000 Italians at the mountain fortress of Amba Alagi. With his water supply compromised, surrounded, and besieged by 9,000 British and Commonwealth troops and more than 20,000 Ethiopian irregulars, the Duke of Aosta surrendered Amba Alagi on 18 May 1941. Due to the gallant resistance of the Italian garrison, the British allowed them to surrender with honours of war.Time Magazine Aosta on Alag? =Death= Shortly after his surrender, the Duke of Aosta was interned in a prisoner-of-war camp in Nairobi, Kenya. He was placed in command of his fellow prisoners, but never saw the end of World War II. On 3 March 1942, shortly after his internment, he died at the prison camp, reportedly as a result of complications from both tuberculosis and malaria.Time Magazine, Died. Prince Amedeo di Savoia, Duke of Aosta Amedeo was succeeded by his brother, Aimone, 4th Duke of Aosta. From 18 May 1941, the same day Amedeo surrendered Amba Alagi, Aimone was proclaimed King of Croatia under the regal name Tomislav II. =Aftermath= Amedeo was well known and highly regarded for being a gentleman. In one instance, before he fled his headquarters at Addis Ababa, he wrote a note to the British to thank them in advance for protecting the women and children in the cities. Count Galeazzo Ciano, Italian Foreign Minister under his father-in-law Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, paid Amedeo a high compliment in his famous diaries. Upon being given the news of the Duke's death Ciano wrote, \\"So dies the image of a Prince and an Italian. Simple in his ways, broad in outlook, and humane in spirit.\\" Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia was also impressed by the respect and care that the Duke of Aosta showed to the exiled Emperor's personal property left behind in Addis Ababa. In a gesture of thanks, the Emperor during his state visit to Italy in 1953 invited the widowed Duchess of Aosta to tea during his stay in Milan, but was then informed by the Italian government that receiving the Duchess would cause offense to the Italian Republic, and so the Emperor sadly canceled the visit. Instead he invited the 5th Duke of Aosta to Ethiopia in the mid-60s, and accorded him all the protocol due to visiting royalty. Family Amedeo was married 5 November 1927, in Naples, to his first cousin Princess Anne of Orl√©ans (1906‚Äì1986), daughter of Prince Jean, Duke of Guise, and his wife, Princess Isabelle of Orl√©ans. They had two daughters: * Princess Margherita of Savoy-Aosta (7 April 1930 Capodimonte Palace); married Robert, Archduke of Austria-Este (son of the last Austrian emperor, Charles I) on 28 December 1953. They have five children. * Princess Maria Cristina of Savoy-Aosta (12 September 1933 at Miramare Castle); married Prince Casimir of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, son of Prince Gabriel of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and his second wife, Princess Cecylia Lubomirska, on 29 January 1967.

Annaei Lucani Pharsalia, sive De bello civili C√¶saris et Pompeji lib X, corrections by Farnaby. Thomas Farnaby (or Farnabie) (c. 1575 ‚Äì 12 June 1647) was an English schoolmaster and scholar. Early life He was the son of a London carpenter. His grandfather, it is said, had been mayor of Truro, his great-grandfather an Italian musician. He may have been related to Giles Farnaby (1563‚Äì1640), the musician and composer, whose father was a joiner. Between 1590 and 1595 he appears successively as a student of Merton College, Oxford, a pupil in a Jesuit college in Spain, a student at Cambridge, and a follower of Francis Drake and John Hawkins. After some military service in the Low Countries he made shift, says Anthony Wood, to be set on shore in the western part of England; where, after some wandering to and fro under the name of Thomas Bainrafe, the anagram of his surname, he settled at Martock, in Somersetshire, and taught the grammar school there for some time with success. Schoolmaster He opened his own school in Goldsmiths Rents, Cripplegate, London at the beginning of the seventeenth century. This school was a success, in terms of reputation and also financially, and had many pupils, drawing on the sons of nobility. He had boarders as well as day scholars, held his classes in a large garden-house, and joined several houses and gardens together to meet the needs of his establishment. He had a small staff at work with him; in 1630 William Burton (1609‚Äì1657), a well-known antiquarian scholar, was one of his assistants. Sir John Bramston the younger, with his brothers, Mountfort and Francis, were among his boarders, and he described the school in his autobiography. Sir Richard Fanshawe, Alexander Gill, and Henry Birkhead were also Farnaby's pupils. From this school, which had as many as 300 pupils, there issued, says Wood, more churchmen and statesmen than from any school taught by one man in England. In the course of his London career he was made master of arts of Cambridge, and soon after was incorporated at Oxford. Such was his success that he was enabled to buy an estate at Otford near Sevenoaks, Kent, to which he retired from London in 1636, while carrying on as schoolmaster. In course of time he added to his Otford estate and bought another near Horsham in Sussex. Later life In politics he was a royalist; and, suspected of participation in the rising near Tunbridge, 1643, he was arrested by the parliamentarians, and was committed to Newgate Prison. He was placed on board ship with a view to his transportation to America, but was ultimately sent to Ely House, Holborn, where he was detained for a year. He was allowed to return to Sevenoaks in 1645, and he died there 12 June 1647, being buried in the chancel of the church. The details of his life were derived by Anthony Wood from Francis, Farnaby's son by a second marriage.Wood, Athenae Oxonienses, ed. Bliss, iii. 213. Works Farnaby was a leading classical scholar as well as the outstanding schoolmaster of his time. His works chiefly consisted of annotated editions of Latin authors Juvenal, Persius, Seneca, Martial, Lucan, Virgil, Ovid and Terence, which enjoyed extraordinary popularity. He is also the author of textbooks on rhetoric and Latin grammar. His editions of the classics, with elaborate Latin notes, were very popular throughout the seventeenth century. He edited Juvenal's and Persius's satires (Lond. 1612, dedicated to Henry, prince of Wales, 1620, 1633, 1685 tenth ed.); Seneca's tragedies (Lond. 1613, 1624, 1678 ninth ed., 1713, 1728); Martial's 'Epigrams' (Lond. 1615, Geneva, 1623, Lond. 1624, 1633, 1670, seventh ed.); Lucan's 'Pharsalia' (Lond. 1618, 1624, 1659, seventh ed.); Virgil's works (1634, dedicated to William Craven, Earl of Craven of Hamsted, and 1661); Ovid's 'Metamorphoses' (Lond. 1637, 1650, 1677, 1739); Terence's comedies, ed. Farnaby and Meric Casaubon (Amsterdam, 1651, 1669, 1686, 1728, Saumur, 1671). Farnaby's other works are: *Index Rhetoricus Scholis et Institutioni tenerioris √¶tatis accommodatus, London, 1625; 2nd ed. 1633; 3rd ed. 1640; 4th ed. 1646; 15th ed. 1767; reissued in 1640 as Index Rhetoricus et Oratoricus cum Formulis Oratoriis et Indice Poetico, and epitomised by T.

A patent dated 6 April 1632 granted Farnaby exclusive rights in all his books for twenty-one years, and on the back of the title-page of the 1633 edition of the ‚ÄòIndex Rhetoricus‚Äô penalties are threatened against any infringement of Farnaby's copyright. Letters from G. J. Vossius to Farnaby appear in Vossius's 'Epistol√¶'; and four of Farnaby's letters to Vossius are printed in Vossius's 'Epistol√¶ Clarorum Virorum'. Other letters appear in John Borough's 'Impetus Juveniles' (1643), and in Barten Holyday's 'Juvenal.' Farnaby prefixed verses in Greek with an English translation to Thomas Coryat's 'Crudities,' and he wrote commendatory lines for William Camden's 'Annales.' Ben Jonson was a friend of Farnaby, and contributed commendatory Latin elegiacs to his edition of Juvenal and Persius. John Owen praises Farnaby's Seneca in his 'Epigrams.' He is highly commended in Dunbar's 'Epigrammata,' 1616, and in Richard Bruch's 'Epigrammatum Hecatontades du√¶,' 1627. Family Farnaby married, first, Susan, daughter of John Pierce of Lancells, Cornwall; and secondly, Anne, daughter of John Howson, bishop of Oxford, afterwards of Durham. By his first wife he had (besides a daughter Judith, wife to William Bladwell, a London merchant) a son, John, captain in the king's army, who inherited his father's Horsham property, and died there early in 1673. By his second wife he had, among other children, a son Francis, born about 1630, who inherited the Kippington estate, Sevenoaks, and was a widower on 26 January 1663, when he obtained a license to marry Mrs. Judith Nicholl of St. James, Clerkenwell.

History  The old astronomical observatory of Vilnius University, opened in 1753, and the new University observatory near Vingis Park, built in 1921, gradually appeared inside the city of Vilnius where conditions turned out to be unsatisfactory for astronomical observations.

It was released by Electronic Arts and Ingram Entertainment for the Sega Genesis. The player controls one aircraft, the F-22 Raptor, throughout the game. At that time, the real aircraft was known as the YF-22 Lightning II, and had only first flown in 1990. Like LHX Attack Chopper, another flight simulator by EA, the playable aircraft had not yet been developed. Gameplay Destroying enemy aircraft results in a great explosion and no survivors. The player has three skill levels to choose from: Cadet, Training, and Combat. The player must then pick one of four campaigns called; 'US', 'Korea' (North Korea), 'Iraq', and 'Russia' (Soviet Union). In each level, the player's F-22 is targeted by surface-to-air missiles, enemy aircraft, and artillery. The mission is to destroy the targets and complete the objectives using a wide range of missiles, from heat seeking missiles, precision-guided bombs, and chaffs. The aircraft is also given two cannons for engaging enemy targets. At the end of each mission, the player is required to either land on a runway or an aircraft carrier. Sometimes in-flight refueling is needed to prevent the F-22 from crashing. As the game progresses, the player will be able to unlock an Aces campaign, where they will face off with advanced pilots from North Korea, Iraq, the Soviet Union, and the United States, the four countries the player visits while playing through the first four campaigns. The game also had a rudimentary mission editor. Although there is not conventional multiplayer, two players can fly as pilot and copilot; a second controller allows a second player to target while the first player flies. Reception MegaTech magazine said the game was \\"absolutely fantastic. The graphics, presentation and playability are all spot on\\".

Arroyo (born 1948) is the current Register of Probate for Suffolk County, Massachusetts, and a former at-large member of the Boston City Council. Early years Arroyo was raised in a public housing project in Puerto Rico by his late father, Felicito Arroyo, a World War II veteran and police detective, and his late mother, Elisa Arroyo, a garment seamstress and an ILGWU member. Arroyo completed his undergraduate studies and received a Masters in Secondary Education at the University of Puerto Rico. He was the first member of his family to earn a college degree; he continued with his graduate studies at Harvard University, MIT, and the University of Puerto Rico. A long-time resident of Boston, Arroyo taught at Springfield College, UMass Boston, Roxbury Community College, Boston University, and Emmanuel College. Political career Arroyo ran for the Boston School Committee in 1981 and 1983, becoming the first Latino to run citywide, and the first Latino to pass a primary. In 1984, Arroyo founded the Latino Democratic Committee, the first statewide Latino political organization in Massachusetts, and served as the Latin American Affairs Director for United States Senator John Kerry. Arroyo served in the cabinet of Mayor of Boston Raymond Flynn from 1985 until 1992. In 1992, Arroyo resigned his salaried position as the Director of Personnel for the City of Boston, in order to take an unpaid position as a member of the Boston School Committee. He would later serve as Vice President and President of the Boston School Committee, where he served from 1992 until 1999. =Boston City Council= Arroyo joined the Boston City Council as one of its four at-large members in January 2003, after placing fifth for an at- large seat in the November 2001 election; he was seated after Francis Roache resigned.Yvonne Abraham, \\"'I arrived here, and the whole city was judging people by their color'\\", The Boston Globe, 26 October 2005 (accessed 22 July 2008). Arroyo was re-elected in November 2003 and November 2005. He narrowly lost in November 2007, placing fifth in a field of nine candidates‚Äîhis loss was attributed to low turnout among nonwhite communities, coupled with disproportionately strong turnout in traditionally white, Irish enclaves; overall turnout was only 13.6%.Donovan Slack and Matt Viser, \\"Turnout at polls lowest in decades\\", The Boston Globe, 7 November 2007 (accessed 9 November 2007). =Register of Probate= Arroyo announced he was running for Register of Probate for Suffolk County on February 11, 2014. He won the Democratic nomination with over 53% of the vote on September 9, 2014, and won an uncontested general election in November 2014. He was the first Latino to win a county-wide political race in Massachusetts. Arroyo was suspended from his job in February 2017, reportedly due to questions about his performance; he returned to work in October 2017, as has deemed the suspension \\"unjust\\". Anti-War Activism For more than 25 years, Arroyo has worked to promote peace and justice on a local and global level. Locally, he has sought to curtail domestic violence, gang violence, and hate crimes and was a vocal advocate against the War in Iraq. Working globally for peace, he has traveled to Nicaragua with Witness for Peace and to El Salvador with Sister Cities Program. He has traveled to Haiti and visited Israel as a peace delegate, and went to the Dominican Republic in 1999 to distribute supplies with a hurricane relief delegation. Legacy The City of Boston proclaimed October 28, 2011, as \\"Felix D. Arroyo Day\\", in honor of his lifelong commitment to social and economic justice and the many racial barriers that he has broken. His son, Felix G.

Life Mikhail Chernyaev was born in 1828 in Bender, in the Bessarabia Governorate of the Russian Empire. He belonged to a Russian noble family descended from Novgorodian boyars.–≠–π–ª–µ—Ä –ê.–ê. –ì.–ù. –ß–ï–†–ù–Ø–ï–í ‚Äì –û–§–ò–¶–ï–† –†–£–°–°–ö–û–ô –ê–†–ú–ò–ò –ò –ü–û–†–¢–û–í–´–ô –ù–ê–ß–ê–õ–¨–ù–ò–ö. –°. 116. His father was Grigory Nikitich Chernyaev (1787 ‚Äì 1868), an officer, a participant of the Battle on Borodino. His father was a commandant of a number of French towns after the defeat of Napoleon. During 1841, he was appointed the city governor of Berdiansk. He was educated at the Nicholas Staff College, enlisted in the army in 1847, and distinguished himself in the Crimean War and in the Caucasus Mountains region. After serving as divisional Chief of Staff in Poland, he went to Orenburg in 1858 as assistant to the commander of the line of the Syr- Darya, and the next year commanded an expedition to assist the Kazakh tribes on the borders of the Aral Sea against the Khanate of Khiva. He did duty on the staff of the Army of the Caucasus for a time, and returned to Orenburg as Chief of Staff. During 1864, having gained the rank of Major-General, Chernyayev made his famous march with 1000 men across the steppes of Turkestan to Chimkent (Shymkent) in the Khanate of Kokand, to meet another Russian column from Semipalatinsk (Semey), in Siberia, in conjunction with which he successfully captured Chimkent, and then unsuccessfully attacked Tashkent, 130 km farther south. Wintering at Chimkent, he captured Tashkent the next year. This was contrary to his instructions, and although he was received in St. Petersburg with enthusiasm, and presented with a sword of honor by the emperor, he was not again employed by the Russian military service, and retired from it in July 1874. He bought, and edited with great success, the publication Russkiy Mir, devoting himself to Pan-Slavism. During the summer of 1876 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Serbian army, but on entering Turkey in Europe was driven back by Osman Pasha, who followed him into Serbia, defeating him at Zajeƒçar and Javor in July, and the campaign in Serbia proved disastrous. He rashly proclaimed Milan Obrenoviƒá IV as King Milan I of Serbia during September's (Deligrad Event), and in October Aleksinac and Deligrad were occupied by the Turks, and the road to Belgrade little defended. An armistice was concluded, and Chernyayev resigned his command. In 1877 he visited Austria-Hungary in relation to his propaganda, but was expelled, and lived for a time in France. In 1879 he organized a Bulgarian rebellion, but was arrested at Adrianople (Edirne) and sent back to Russia. He succeeded Kaufmann as Governor of Turkestan in 1882, but his bellicose plans for the Great Game with the British Empire resulted in his replacement two years later, when he was appointed a member of the council of war at St. Petersburg. In 1886 his opposition to the Central Asian Military railway caused him to be dismissed from the council. Chernyayev died in 1898 at his country estate in Mogilev Governorate. Chernyayev was awarded the highest Serbian order of the time, Order of the Cross of Takovo.

He twice won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor; for Crown Matrimonial in 1975 and for Professional Foul and The Country Party in 1978. He also starred in the ITV series Manhunt (1970) and the BBC series Telford's Change (1979). His film appearances included Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), International Velvet (1978) and Champions (1984). Early life Peter Barkworth was born at Margate, Kent. Soon after his birth, the family moved to Bramhall in Cheshire and Barkworth was educated at Stockport School. His headmaster wanted him to go to university but Barkworth had set his heart on a career in acting. In 1946 he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). He spent the next few years in repertory in Folkestone, with the Arthur Brough company, and also in Sheffield. From the mid-1950s to the early 1960s he taught acting technique at RADA. Acting career Television and film appearances followed over four decades. He is perhaps best remembered for playing Mark Telford in the TV series Telford's Change (1979), watched every week by seven million viewers. This series followed the life of a senior banking executive as he downsized to Dover to start his life over again, leaving his wife in London. Barkworth co-starred with Hannah Gordon, with Keith Barron as her seducer. =Television= Barkworth twice won the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor, in 1975 for Crown Matrimonial (1974) and in 1978 for his roles in Professional Foul and The Country Party (both 1977). His character in the 1965 boardroom drama The Power Game was a recurring role. He also appeared in the 1970s series ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Rivals of Sherlock Holmes‚Äô‚Äô as Martin Hewitt. In the late 1960s, he appeared in a leading role as Vincent in the World War II drama series Manhunt on LWT and various episodes of The Avengers. He also had a part in the Doctor Who serial The Ice Warriors as Leader Clent. He featured in an episode of sci-fi drama Undermind (1965), and the dystopian The Guardians (1971), and starred in the mystery mini-series Melissa (1974) as an out of work writer whose wife goes missing. Barkworth also played the expatriate British novelist Hugh Neville in the episodes Guilt and Lost Sheep of Secret Army (1977). Later TV included the part of Stanley Baldwin in Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), and the serials The Price (1985) and Late Starter (also 1985) in both of which he played angst-filled, middle-aged, middle class characters beset by marital problems in the context respectively of a kidnapping and the early retirement of an academic. Both these series and Telford's Change were based on Barkworth's original ideas. In 1988 Barkworth had a leading guest role in the fourth season Sherlock Holmes adaptation of the Arthur Conan Doyle story \\"Silver Blaze.\\" In one of his last roles, he starred opposite his former RADA student Michael Gambon in the 1993 episode \\"Maigret and the Minister\\" of ITV's Maigret series. =Theatre= Back on the stage, Barkworth appeared in numerous plays in the West End, notably as Edward VIII in Royce Ryton's Crown Matrimonial starring alongside Wendy Hiller at the Haymarket Theatre in 1972, a role which he repeated on TV two years later.

He had subsequent roles in No Love for Johnnie (1961), Two a Penny (1967), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), Escape from the Dark (1976), International Velvet (1978) and Champions (1983). His last appearance was in the film Wilde in 1997. He then retired from acting. The arts Barkworth was a member of the Council at RADA for 16 years during the 1980s and 1990s. His book About Acting - formerly titled The Complete About Acting - is often recommended reading for students and professional actors alike. He also edited For All Occasions: A Selection of Poems, Prose and Party Pieces (1997). He was an avid collector of mainly British art. He left his collection of paintings to the National Trust and they are displayed at Fenton House in Hampstead. The works include two small Constables, several paintings by artists from the Camden Town Group, and many watercolours.

It was used as a flying field; primary flying school; school for adjutants, supply officers, engineers; mechanics school, and as an aviation general supply depot.World War I Group, Historical Division, Special Staff, United States Army, Order of Battle of the United States Land Forces in the World War (1917‚Äì1919) Kelly Air Force Base and its associated San Antonio Air Logistics Center of the Air Force Materiel Command (formerly Air Force Logistics Command) was closed as an independent installation and its assets realigned by the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. Current status Kelly Field supports flight operations of two tenant commands, the Air Force Reserve Command's 433d Airlift Wing, operating the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy and the Texas Air National Guard's 149th Fighter Wing, operating the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. The remaining 1,873 acres (7.58 ha) of land, including hangars and industrial facilities previously known as the San Antonio Air Logistics Center, is operated by the Greater Kelly Development Authority (a political subdivision of the State of Texas, now renamed the Port Authority of San Antonio) as the Port San Antonio business park. As of 2006, there are still some isolated USAF activities on Port San Antonio subordinate to Lackland, as well as a substantial tract of military family housing. Several large warehouses on the grounds of Port San Antonio were cleared, cleaned and equipped with large mobile air conditioning units to house evacuees from Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. The first evacuees began to arrive on September 2, 2005. History Kelly Field is named in honor of 2d Lieutenant George Edward Maurice Kelly. Lt. Kelly, who after a course of training at the Curtiss Aviation School, Rockwell Field, California, was ordered to Fort Sam Houston, near San Antonio. While attempting to land on 10 May 1911 in order to avoid running into a tent and thereby possibly injuring several others, Kelly died in a crash, falling into the ground.San Antonio Air Logistics Center Office of History, Kelly AFB, Texas. A Brief History of Kelly Air Force Base. San Antonio, June 1993.Location of U.S. Aviation Fields, The New York Times, 21 July 1918 =Origins= In August 1913, U.S. Army Chief Signal Officer Brigadier General George P. Scriven testified before the U.S. House of Representatives concerning the establishment of a military aeronautical center in San Antonio, Texas. The center was to be built for the Aviation Section of the U.S. Army Signal Corps. General Scriven described San Antonio as ‚Äúthe most important strategic position of the South,‚Äù in response to the unrest resulting from the Mexican Revolution. In 1916, when Fort Sam Houston was the primary site of the Corps‚Äô aerial equipment and personnel, The San Antonio Light predicted that the city would be ‚Äúthe most important military aviation center in the U.S.‚ÄùKelly Field history, 1916-1941 In November 1915, the newly created 1st Aero Squadron arrived at Fort Sam Houston after a cross-country flight from Fort Sill, Oklahoma. However, the squadron remained at the post only until March 1916, whereupon it left to join Brigadier General John J. Pershing‚Äôs Punitive Expedition against Pancho Villa on the U.S.-Mexico border. Problems experienced by the 1st Aero Squadron on that expedition and the ongoing war in Europe persuaded Congress to improve and expand the nation's air arm. It was quickly apparent that Fort Sam Houston had inadequate space for additional flying operations, especially with newer and more powerful aircraft. Major Benjamin Foulois, with the support of the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, selected a site five miles southwest of the city for a new aviation airfield on 21 November 1916. Bordered by the Frio City Road on the northwest, the site was also adjacent to the Southern Pacific Railroad, providing easy access by road and rail. In addition, the new site was relatively flat, and thus suitable for flying operations. Initially, the site was called the South San Antonio Aviation Camp. =World War I= Kelly Field, 1920 On 5 April 1917, four aircraft took off from Fort Sam Houston, flew across San Antonio and landed on the new airfield, which at the time was a cleared cotton field. Tents had been erected as hangars, however a permanent presence at the airfield was not established until 7 May when 700 men arrived. A week later, the population had grown to 4,000. Construction of the facility was rapid, with the United States now at war and the mission of the new airfield was to train aviators to be sent to the Western Front in France. The ground was cleared and scores of buildings - hangars, barracks, mess halls, a street system, electrical and plumbing systems, warehouses, machine shops were all constructed during the summer. Curtiss JN-4 Jennys training at Kelly Field 1918 By the end of June, it was clear that Foulois' original site, known unofficially as Kelly Field #1, was too small to train both new recruits and aviation cadets. A committee of the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce provided the necessary land and presented the proposition to the Aviation Production Board in Washington, D.C. in June 1917. A contract was signed in July 1917, comprising all of what was Kelly Field #2. Two additional tracts of land, planned to be Kelly Field #3 and #4 were released in the fall of 1917 at the suggestion of British and French aviators who were of the opinion that being so close together, would result in accidents and collisions.Kroll, H. D. (1919), Kelly field in the great world war, San Antonio Printing Company Kelly soldiers organized approximately 250,000 men into \\"Aero Squadrons\\" during the hectic months of 1917 and 1918. Eventually, 326 squadrons were formed at Kelly during World War I, with all but twenty of these moving to other installations in the U.S. or overseas. The majority of Aero Squadrons were combat support squadrons. Kelly Field served as the first reception and classification center, testing thousands of recruits before assigning them to specific jobs and squadrons for training. The Air Service Mechanics School Enlisted Mechanics Training Department turned out an average of 2,000 mechanics and chauffeurs a month. Kelly also trained bakers and cooks, and the Aviation General Supply Depot moved to the field from its old location in downtown San Antonio. Many of the American-trained World War I aviators learned to fly at Kelly field, with 1,459 pilots and 398 flying instructors graduating from the Kelly aviation schools during the course of the war.

In addition to the flying school at Kelly Field, Selfridge Field, Michigan was also used for pilot training, and the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC), operated flying schools for American pilots in Toronto, Ontario and several fields at Camp Taliaferro, Texas. The thousands of enlistees who came to Kelly devised numerous ways to entertain themselves during their infrequent time off. Among these organizations were a glee club, a minstrel show, and the \\"Famous Kelly Field Players,\\" a club of professional vaudeville entertainers in uniform. Many clubs traveled around the South Texas area and gained fame for the morale-building shows. =Between the wars= Kelly and Duncan Fields, 1935 At the end of the war, the Army Air Service, along with the rest of the Army, faced crucial reductions. Thousands of officers and enlisted men were released, leaving only 10,000 men to fly and repair the planes and engines left over from the war. Hundreds of small flying fields closed, forcing consolidation of supply and aviation repair depots. Kelly, however, was one of the few that remained open. On 13 December 1919, the United States House of Representatives passed an appropriations bill for $9.6 million for the purchase of additional land at military camps ‚Äúwhich are to be made part of the permanent military establishment.‚Äù Kelly Field No. 2 was allocated $349,600 of this amount.United Press, ‚ÄúHouse Passes Bill To Buy March Field,‚Äù Riverside Daily Press, Riverside, California, Saturday evening, 13 December 1919, Volume XXXIV, Number 269, page 8. In 1921, the aviation repair depot in Dallas moved to Kelly to join with the supply depot, forming the San Antonio Intermediate Air Depot. Brooks Field became the center for primary training and Kelly for advanced training. Each phase of instruction lasted about six months initially, with advanced training later divided into three months each of basic and advanced instruction The 10th School Group (later the Advanced Flying Training Wing and the Advanced Flying School) was formed at Kelly Field #2 in 1922. There, student pilots mastered the advanced skills of pursuit, bombardment, attack, and observation. Most of the Army aviators trained between the two World Wars attended this school. Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly solo nonstop across the Atlantic, graduated from the Advanced Flying School in 1925. Other graduates included former Air Force Chiefs of Staff Generals Thomas D. White, Curtis E. LeMay, John P. McConnell, Hoyt Vandenberg, and John Dale Ryan. Major General Claire Chennault of World War II \\"Flying Tiger\\" fame taught at the school. In 1925, Kelly Field #1 was renamed Duncan Field in honor of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Duncan. Formerly stationed at Kelly Field, Duncan died in an airplane accident at Bolling Field in Washington, D.C.. Kelly Field #2 became simply, Kelly Field. Both fields conducted their training, maintenance, command, and supply functions separately for the next 18 years. Low pay and worn-out planes and equipment did not halt the small band of mechanics and fliers from proving their professional dedication. Army personnel pushed forward the frontiers of aeronautics in the 1920s. The aircraft used for Jimmy Doolittle's 1922 transcontinental flight received preflight servicing at Kelly #1. Kelly #2 was Doolittle's sole refueling stop during the flight itself. In 1926, Kelly was the starting point of the Pan American Goodwill Flight. Their air excursion was a 175-day adventure to \\"show the flag\\", with five planes and 10 pilots landing at 23 Central and South American countries. Captain Ira C. Eaker, Commander of the 8th Air Force during World War II and a Kelly graduate, was one of the pilots of that enterprise. Much of the pioneering work of Major William Ocker and Captain Charles Crane in the field of instrument flying took place at Kelly. Their efforts resulted in the development of the first \\"blind flying\\" curriculum at the Advanced Flying School and won Crane the Mackay Trophy. Public enthusiasm for \\"those daring young men in their flying machines\\" encouraged Army pilots to display their skill in an effort to gain public acceptance of the airplane as an ever-capable instrument for American's expanding society. Air circuses and balloon races were exciting events in the Roaring Twenties, and the pilots at Kelly were happy to provide the thrills and air spectacles the public loved. Kelly hosted the National Elimination Balloon Race in 1924 and welcomed thousands of San Antonians to see the lift- off, aerial demonstrations, and other exploits of \\"derring-do.\\" But perhaps no event matched the production of the Hollywood film \\"Wings\\" in 1926. Kelly hoped to make motion picture history by providing pilots, aircraft, extras, and technicians to assist in the filming of this World War I epic. Clara Bow (the famous \\"It Girl\\"), Buddy Rogers, and Richard Arlen starred in this silent movie classic which was filmed in and around San Antonio. A young newcomer, Gary Cooper, had a bit part in the film. \\"Wings\\" received the first Academy Award for \\"Best Production of the Year\\" for 1927‚Äì1928, the first (and until 2011, the only) silent film ever to win this honor. In 1927 basic moved out of the advanced phase and combined with primary. At that point, primary-basic changed to eight months in length and advanced to four months. In June 1927 General Lahm suggested the construction of a single large field outside of the city to house all flying training. Congress funded the new field's construction but not the purchase of the land, so the city of San Antonio borrowed the $546,000 needed to purchase the site selected for what became Randolph Field. By the fall of 1931, construction was essentially completed, so the Air Corps Training Center at Duncan Field, adjacent to Kelly, and the primary schools at Brooks and March moved to the new installation, while advanced training remained at Kelly. Suffering from a chronic lack of funds, the Air Corps' struggle for better aircraft continued until the 1938 crisis over Czechoslovakia. Adolf Hitler and the Luftwaffe (the German Air Force) demonstrated that air power had become an important factor in international relations. President Franklin D. Roosevelt recognized the significance of the Luftwaffe's role and took the first steps toward United States rearmament. In 1939, Congress authorized $300 million for the Air Corps. Hundreds of new planes, officers, and enlisted men made their way to Kelly. Besides money for new equipment and more personnel, funds became available for construction of sorely needed barracks, offices, classrooms, and warehouses. Many of the facilities built during this period remain in use today. The present Officer's Club (originally built for cadet housing) and the Air Logistics Center headquarters building (originally used for classrooms) were constructed to meet the increased demand for facilities during this period of expansion. Other facilities built during the construction boom included the unique Miniature Range building, then used for aerial observation training, and the \\"Palace\\", a huge complex of enlisted quarters, dining halls and offices. Originally called \\"Buckingham Palace\\", the building received its nickname because it was so much more \\"palatial\\" than the tents and crude wooden barracks the men had been living in. =World War II= Kelly Field 1942 USAAF Classbook Kelly Field - 1946 After the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the need for more pilots, bombardiers, and navigators resulted in the rapid expansion of the United States Army's air arm and the Advanced Flying School. Night flying was added to the school program and the amount of training time doubled. Between January 1939 and March 1943, over 6,800 men graduated from Kelly's Advanced Flying School and approximately 1,700 additional pilots graduated from various other courses in the Instructor's School. In order to house the rapidly growing pilot trainee population, a \\"tent city\\" sprang up as it had in World War I. By the summer of 1942, congestion caused by the close proximity of four flying fields - Duncan, Kelly, Brooks, and Stinson - had become dangerous. Consequently, in March 1943, Kelly and Duncan were reunited under the name of Kelly Field. Kelly Field's primary functions became that of maintenance and supply. This was a major change in mission for Kelly as flying training moved elsewhere. Kelly's World War II mission turned the base into a huge industrial complex. A new organization, the San Antonio Air Service Command, managed the increased supply and maintenance workload at would become the San Antonio Air Logistics Center in later years. Kelly workers overhauled, repaired, and modified aircraft, engines, and related equipment. = Post-war years = When World War II ended in August 1945, America demobilized as rapidly as it had after the First World War. Over 3,000 Kelly civilians resigned or retired within weeks of V-J Day. Nevertheless, more and more AT-6, P-51, and B-29 aircraft were delivered to Kelly for maintenance and storage. Disposal and aircraft storage programs took up more and more of Kelly's time and space. Kelly's maintenance workers stopped repairing very heavy bombers and began supporting the occupational forces in Europe and Japan with air transportation, communications, and weather systems. In 1946, the San Antonio Air Technical Services Command became the San Antonio Air Materiel Area (SAAMA). In July 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed the National Security Act, which, among other things, created an independent United States Air Force. Over the next few years, the youngest of the armed services separated itself from the Army way of doing things. In January 1948, Kelly Field became Kelly Air Force Base. =Berlin airlift and Korean War= The C-54 Skymaster was propelled by the R2000 engine, which was serviced exclusively at Kelly AFB By June 1948, the Soviet Union, in a move to push the Allies out of Berlin, closed all water, rail, and highway links to the western part of the city. Forced to choose between abandoning West Berlin or supplying all goods by air, the western powers began around-the-clock airlift of vital supplies and material into the beleaguered city. The airlift, nicknamed \\"Operation Vittles\\", became the largest air cargo operation of all time. The prime workhorse of the Berlin Airlift was the C-54 Skymaster cargo aircraft, and Kelly was the only depot in the country repairing and overhauling replacement Pratt and Whitney R2000 engines used on the aircraft. By December 31, the Supply Division had shipped 1,317 R2000 engines worth $1.7 million for the airlift. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 found Kelly once again responding almost overnight. The Kelly maintenance line went into full-steam production to recondition Boeing B-29 Superfortresses that had been in storage for overseas service. Work continued into the night by use of special outdoor lighting. The aircraft production line earned the nickname of the \\"Great White Way\\" as the glow of lights reflected on the aluminum skin of the bombers and lit up the evening sky. When the fighting subsided in Korea in July 1953, Kelly workers had once again proven their commitment to meet whatever challenges faced them.  1950s  Convair XC-99 attached to the MATS 1700th Air Transport Group, Kelly AFB, Texas, 1954. Note San Antonio Air Materiel Area (SAAMA) tail marking, indicating the aircraft was assigned to the Air Materiel Command. As the Air Force moved through its first decade of independence, its aircraft, engines, accessories, and support equipment became increasingly sophisticated and complex, requiring use of new technologies and innovative programs to meet the challenges of the future. By 1951, the Convair Convair B-36 Peacemaker intercontinental bomber began arriving in ever-increasing numbers at Kelly. With its powerful R4360 engines, the B-36 rapidly took the place of the B-29. The B-36 was radical in its design; its six pusher engines gave it a top speed of over 400 miles per hour, and it was the first American bomber capable of reaching any target on the globe. R4360 engines also powered the Convair XC-99. Convair built this one-and-only transport in 1947 to use the technology of the B-36 more effectively. As the largest cargo plane to-date, the XC-99 set many world records between 1953 and 1955, before the Air Force decided it did not need large transport planes. The longest flight ‚Äî 12,000 miles to Rhein-Main Air Base in West Germany ‚Äî began on 13 August 1953. Carrying 61,000 pounds of vital cargo, it flew to West Germany via Kindley Air Force Base, Bermuda and Lajes Field, Azores and returned a week later carrying another 62,000 pounds. Every place the XC-99 landed, newspaper, radio, and television reporters were there to convey to the public the excitement of the spectacular flight. The B-47 was the first all-jet bomber supported by Kelly Kelly AFB provided depot-level support for the B-52 from its introduction in 1955 until 1993 Another record-breaking flight took place during May 1955. The XC-99 was put to the test in support of PROJECT DEWLINE. In conjunction with the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), the XC-99 airlifted 380,000 pounds of cargo to Keflavik Airport, Iceland from Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, a distance of 2,500 miles. The plane was airborne 210 hours and 41 minutes. Some trouble was experienced, but the 31 civilian technicians from the San Antonio depot successfully repaired the XC-99 at Dover AFB. Jet engines had become extremely important to the Air Force by 1955. The Boeing B-47 Stratojet bomber was the first full weapons system bomber. Designed in 1945, the B-47 was powered by six General Electric J47 turbojet engines and featured swept-back wings and tail surfaces. Its mission was to deliver conventional or nuclear ordnance to enemy targets. On 30 November 1959, a B-47 bomber set a world endurance record, remaining airborne for three days, eight hours, and eight minutes, and covering a distance of 32,900 miles. After relegating the bomber to reconnaissance and training missions, the last Stratojets were taken out of the active United States Air Force inventory in 1966. The Convair B-58 Hustler was yet another important addition to the Air Force inventory. As America's first supersonic bomber, it could range higher and faster than any other bomber aircraft in the world, flying at twice the speed of sound. Its four J79 engines produced over 41,000 pounds of thrust that could push the sleek bomber at more than 1,300 mph. The first B-58 arrived at Kelly on 15 March 1960 to be used for training maintenance personnel for the new overhaul workload. On May 26, 1958, SAAMA opened the B-58 Logistics Support Management Office. It became the forerunner of a major area organizational realignment whereby worldwide weapons management functions would be separated organizationally from the internal depot operations. Responsibilities outlined for the weapon system manager included budgeting, funding, computing requirements, and arranging for maintenance. The B-58 was serviced by Kelly workers Kelly repaired and overhauled B-52s for over 30 years. In the early 1960s, the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress was the major depot-level maintenance workload for SAAMA. Modifications to the B-52s performed at Kelly increased the load capability of each plane and increased the aircraft's range. In addition, the San Antonio shops camouflage-painted the B-52Gs for Southeast Asia Arc Light operations. This era in Kelly's history ended when the Air Force shifted the B-52 workload to Oklahoma City AMA at Tinker Air Force Base in the spring of 1993. The 36-year-old relationship between Kelly and the big bomber was the longest association between any Air Force weapons system and a single ALC to that point. Americans have always looked to the future, but the future of Kelly's involvement in space have been a \\"now\\" responsibility for more than 25 years. In August 1962, SAAMA \\"loaned\\" the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) six aircraft - two F-102s, two TF102s and two T33s - so the astronauts at Houston's Manned Spacecraft Center could maintain their flying proficiency. Two years later, Directorate of Maintenance workers built three Apollo capsule trainers for NASA. And Kelly's Directorate of Aerospace Fuels supplied NASA with the required liquid propellants from the very beginning of the Space Administration's push into space. Vietnam War Kelly's workload remained relatively stable until the mid-1960s, when American efforts to prevent the fall of the South Vietnamese government led to direct American involvement. Following the Gulf of Tonkin incident in August 1964, all air materiel areas began supporting Southeast Asia on a 24-hour basis. For the next 11 years, Kelly employees were deeply involved in supplying parts and expertise for the conflict in Southeast Asia, working both within the United States and overseas. B-52G Stratofortress, modified by Kelly AFB for Arc Light bombing missions in Southeast Asia, landing at Andersen AFB during Linebacker II 1972. In May 1965, during the build-up of American forces in Vietnam, the Logistics Command started sending teams of supply personnel to the Pacific Air Forces. Kelly had a lot of volunteers. By 31 December 1965, SAAMA had sent 11 supply teams, totaling 89 personnel, on temporary duty to Southeast Asia to establish supply centers throughout the western Pacific, including South Vietnam. Kelly also sent maintenance teams to Southeast Asia. The first team consisted of six jet engine mechanics that worked at Clark Air Base, Philippines on J57 engines for North American F-100 Super Sabres. Other Kelly workers served in South Vietnam on special Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter modification teams, helped reassemble newly shipped F-5A/C aircraft at Bien Hoa Air Base, and assisted in the creation of an engine repair facility at Bien Hoa. Some workers served on rapid area maintenance supply support or area transportation teams while others served as weapon system logistic officers. Those who remained in San Antonio also strove to meet the demands for materiel and aircraft maintenance. On 1 July 1965, Kelly opened as an aerial port of embarkation to provide though-plane cargo service to Southeast Asia. Kelly Air Force Base personnel processed and routed vital war material earmarked for South Vietnam to the Southeast Asian Theater. By 1967, the pace of the United States build-up intensified. The Lockheed C-141A Starlifter cargo aircraft began to enter the Air Force inventory in sufficient numbers to replace the aging Douglas C-124 Globemaster II. With air terminal modernization and the increased use of C-141 aircraft, Military Airlift Command (MAC) aircrews seldom experienced any delays at Kelly's aerial port. Northrop F-5B Freedom Fighter (s/n 65-13074) of the 602th Fighter Squadron at Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam, in 1966. It was part of the project \\"Skoshi Tiger\\" to evaluate the F-5. On 1 November 1965, SAAMA assumed responsibility for the Air Force's entire watercraft program. This included all landing-type vessels, spares, engines, and combat ships. Other items included cargo tanks, special service vessels, barges, small craft, dredges, rigging, and marine hardware. Earlier that year, on 3 August, Kelly became responsible for assembly and shipment of the necessary airfield lighting equipment to establish four semi-fixed installations in Southeast Asia. The early 1970s witnessed the establishment of the Vietnamization Program, also known as the Nixon Doctrine. This new policy was the key to planned reductions in the United States military forces in South Vietnam. As part of this effort, SAAMA personnel were deeply involved in the planning and construction of an engine facility at Bien Hoa Air Base. This assignment began in February 1971 when the Air Force Logistics Command gave the SAAMA the responsibility for developing complete plans and specifications for converting an existing building at Bien Hoa Air Base into an engine overhaul facility. One month later, the San Antonio Air Materiel Area\\\\ became involved with yet another project to provide logistics support. On 20 October 1972, SAAMA initiated PROJECT ENHANCE PLUS, to transfer A-37, Northrop F-5E Tiger II, and Northrop T-38 Talon aircraft, engines, and support spares to the Republic of Vietnam to carry on the war after American withdrawal. Nearly every directorate at Kelly contributed to this effort. C-5A Galaxy in the 1970s The C-5A Galaxy, the Air Force's largest aircraft, entered the inventory in June 1970. San Antonio Air Materiel Area had both management and repair responsibility for the giant transport and its TF39 engine. Weighing about 350 tons, the aircraft can transport 98 percent of equipment issued to an Army division, including the 100,000 pound M-1 tank, self- propelled artillery equipment, missiles, and helicopters. On its initial visit to Kelly on 31 January 1970, prominent figures as well as public spectators greeted the C-5A. A year before the United States ended its involvement in Southeast Asian hostilities; the military services began to prepare for the return of North Vietnam-held Prisoners of War. With the signing of the Paris Peace Accords on 27 January 1973, \\"Operation Homecoming\\" was on. The prisoners were flown from North Vietnam to the Joint Homecoming Reception Center at Clark Air Base, Philippines. Once at Clark, the former POWs were given medical checkups, issued uniforms and personal items, and made those very important phone calls home. After a minimum time at Clark, the POWs flew to the United States to be reunited with their families and to receive complete medical and psychological evaluation and treatment. Lackland Air Force Base and Fort Sam Houston were designated as reception areas in San Antonio because each had hospital facilities to handle the needs of the returning prisoners of war. Kelly became the reception area. Flights bringing the former POWs to Kelly began on 15 February 1973. Although crowds were deliberately kept small, the occasion was full of joy. The 11 flights that arrived at Kelly carried 20 Air Force and 12 Army men. Kelly Air Force Base took great pride in welcoming home the brave men who had spent years in captivity.  Post-Vietnam era In 1974, San Antonio Air Materiel Area changed its name to the San Antonio Air Logistics Center, but the dedication and support to the Air Force mission remained the same. Pratt & Whitney F100 turbofan engine The first F100 engine arrived at the SA-ALC on 9 August 1974. Primarily used as a trainer, this first engine was also used as a prototype repair engine to determine the adequacy of planning documents, technical data, tools and equipment. Management and maintenance of the F100 is complicated by the unique design of the engine. The engine is divided into five modules. Defective modules could be removed and replaced with spares to return the engine to service more rapidly. Another unique aspect of the F100 engine is the \\"on-condition\\" maintenance feature. This occurs if an inspection team determines that the rest of the modules are in good working order. Only the affected part would be overhauled and the rest of the engine would be left alone. In addition, time between overhauls is measured in terms of cycles, or throttling up and down action, rather than flight hours. As good as the C-5A was, Lockheed and the Air Force began plans to incorporate reliability and maintainability factors into the large cargo plane, producing the C-5B during the early 1980s. The Galaxy \\"B\\" fleet added 7.5 million cargo tons per day to the United States military strategic airlift capability. On 16 November 1973, the Directorate of Aerospace Fuels provided propellants support to the last of the Skylab space program launches. In March 1979, the Space Shuttle \\"Columbia\\" perched atop a Boeing 747 arrived at Kelly Air Force Base for the first time for a refueling stop on its way to Kennedy Space Center in Florida. This was Kelly's most dramatic and visible participation in support of the space programm but not its last. NASA flights continued to land with parts and equipment for multiple Space Shuttle missions en route to Kennedy Space Center as late as June 2009.Space shuttle visits Lackland C-17 Globemaster III The San Antonio Air Logistics Center also managed the new Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, developed by McDonnell Douglas in the late 1980s. This advanced aircraft is a rugged, reliable, modern airlifter designed to meet requirements established jointly by the Army, Marines, and the Air Force. The C-17 provides the United States combat commanders with the increased mobility to get to the battle sooner-and to win. Kelly's involvement in the C-17 program was further strengthened when Air Force Logistics Command named it the source of repair for the airframe. Logistics support responsibility for the aircraft was made virtually complete in March 1985 when AFLC gave SA-ALC management and repair responsibility for the C-17 engines, the Pratt & Whitney F117-PW-100 turbofans. With the transfer of B-52 repair and overhaul to Oklahoma City in 1993, Kelly's workers shifted their attention to keeping the T-38 jet trainers of Air Education and Training Command ready to fly. This workload moved to Kelly in the spring of 1993. =Closure= Kelly AFB document, 1993 During Operation Just Cause, Kelly served as a transit point for more than 8,200 troops deploying to Panama and as a reception site for some 250 incoming wounded service members. Later, the base moved more than 10,000 short tons of material and 4,700 passengers and deployed 17 million pounds of munitions to Southwest Asia for Operation Desert Storm. During the 1990s, it supported US operations in Kosovo. In 1992, a major defense reorganization had shifted ownership of most of Kelly's warehouse space from the Air Force to the new Defense Logistics Agency. The following year, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission added Kelly and three other logistics centers to the list of installations marked for closure. Local officials convinced the commissioners to spare the base, but it was only a temporary stay. Kelly Air Force Base was closed because the Base Realignment and Closure Commission round of 1995 decided the base's workload should be consolidated with that of other Air Force depots. At the same time McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, California, was also closed. Instead of shifting all workloads, some were outsourced or privatized by the Clinton administration. Parts of the installation were shifted to Lackland Air Force Base, with a significant portion becoming Port San Antonio. Prior to the shutdown it was still a vital part of San Antonio, including but not limited to providing host to Air Force One's backup airplane in 1998. The 37th Training Wing at Lackland AFB, Texas, assumed responsibility for the Kelly AFB flightline area and the area west of the runway on 1 April 2001, the area being designated Kelly Field Annex. Port San Antonio (formerly known as KellyUSA) has now renamed the logistics center Port San Antonio in line with its business strategy of becoming the largest inland port in South Texas. =Facility names= * Aviation Camp (a.k.a.

Mikhail Matveyevich Kheraskov (; ‚Äì ) was Russian poet and playwright. A leading figure of the Russian Enlightenment, Kheraskov was regarded as the most important Russian poet by Catherine the Great and her contemporaries. Kheraskov's father was a Moldavian boyar who settled in the Ukraine. Patronized by his Freemason friends, Mikhail furthered his education abroad and was appointed dean of the Moscow University in 1763 at the age of 30. In 1771‚Äì1779, he wrote the Rossiad (, Rossiada), the first Russian epic in the tradition of Homer and Virgil, about Ivan the Terrible's taking of Kazan in 1552. The Rossiad's only rival for the title of the longest poem in the Russian language is Kheraskov's Vladimir Reborn (1785), concerned with the baptism of Kievan Rus. Somewhat more popular is his oriental tale Bakhariana (1803). Kheraskov also wrote 20 plays but, like the rest of his writings, they have been largely neglected by posterity. He spent much of his time in Grebnevo, his manorial estate near Moscow. Mikhail Timofeyevich Vysotsky (1791‚Äì1837, Russian guitarist-virtuoso and guitar composer) was a godson of Mikhail Kheraskov.  Biography  = Early life = Princess Anna Danilovna Trubetskaya‚ÄîKheraskov's mother. A miniature portrait by an unknown artist, painted sometime in the 1760s. Mikhail Kheraskov was born in 1733 in the city of Pereiaslav. His father, Matei Herescu, was a stolnik (a minor Wallachian nobleman) and a descendant of Wallachian boyars. He was also the brother-in-law of General Toma Cantacuzino (1665-1720), a Wallachian cavalry commander who served under Peter the Great. Herescu and other members of the Wallachian and Moldavian nobility had moved to the Russian Empire and entered the service of Peter following the unsuccessful Pruth River Campaign, a Russian offensive which sought to expel the Ottoman Empire from Moldavia and establish Russian garrisons in Moldavian fortress towns. Matei Herescu changed his name to Matvei Andreevich Kheraskov and received an estate near Pereiaslav in Left-bank Ukraine (along with 5,000 serfs, by some accounts). He attained the rank of major in the newly formed Chevalier Guard Regiment and eventually became commandant of the Pereiaslav fortress. He was married to Anna Danilovna Druckie-Sokolinskie, and died in 1734, leaving Anna to raise their three children, of which Mikhail was the youngest.–ö—É–ª–∞–∫–æ–≤–∞, 1947, —Å. 320. In November 1735, Anna married Prince Nikita Yurievich Trubetskoy, a seasoned officer who was then serving as the general- krigs-komissar in the Ukrainian fortress town Izium, where Mikhail spent his earliest years. Because of his ancestry and the connections his stepfather afforded him, Kheraskov enjoyed the privileges of the highest ranks of the Russian nobility. In September 1740, Trubetskoy was appointed Prosecutor General of the Governing Senate and moved to St. Petersburg with his family. In September 1743, he reported to the Office of Heraldry that his biological children and stepchildren were able to \\"read and write Russian, and are being taught the French and German languages, geography, arithmetic and geometry.\\" In December, Trubetskoy wrote to the Senate of his wish to place his ten-year- old stepson in the First Cadet Corps. The request was granted, and at Mikhail was enrolled on 30 December. Modeled on the \\"Knight academies\\" of West European states, Kheraskov received an excellent education in the humanities. In addition to active literary circles, theatrical performances were staged by students with the assistance of figures such as Alexander Sumarokov, who is credited with introducing classical theater to Russia. While some sources suggest that Kheraskov was already writing poetry during this period, other sources indicate that before the age of twenty he had not demonstrated any particular talents. In the Cadet Corps he studied the same subjects that he had studied at home, and judging by surviving documents, his academic performance was assessed as \\"mediocre.\\" In 1749 he was promoted to corporal. Kheraskov completed his course of studies in 1751, and on 15 September he was commissioned as a podporuchik in the Ingrian Regiment. = Moscow University = Portrait of M. M. Kheraskov in the gallery of rectors of Moscow University. Having served as an officer for about four years, Mikhail Kheraskov entered state service in 1755, and was enrolled in the Collegium of Commerce. However, in early 1756 he transferred to the recently founded Moscow University, where he was appointed collegiate assessor. In some way or another, he would remain affiliated with the university for the rest of his life. As collegiate assessor, Kheraskov was tasked with the supervision (and surveillance) of university students. In 1756, Kheraskov took on additional responsibilities as head of the university library and director of the university theater. On 24 February 1757, he was admitted to the University Conference (analogous to the modern academic council), and became a trustee of the university printing house. In order to increase the number of publications, Kheraskov contacted the academician Gerhard Friedrich M√ºller, who in 1754 founded the periodical Monthly Essays, the first monthly popular science and literary journal in Russia. Kheraskov became a regular contributor to Monthly Essays, and he and Miller exchanged publications and frequently corresponded. As a form of encouragement, the curator and founder of Moscow University, Ivan Shuvalov, appointed Kheraskov to supervise the Moscow Synodal Printing Office. Kheraskov's activities were extremely diverse: in 1759 he became a supervisor of the a mineralogical cabinet, and in 1761 he was made head director over Russian actors in Moscow. He was also responsible for contracting Italian singers. Kheraskov not only directed, but also played a role in the successful debut of his tragedy, The Venetian Nun, reviews of which appeared even in German journals. In 1761 he was awarded the rank of Court Councillor. In June 1761 he served as acting director of the university because of a leave of absence by the appointed director, Ivan Ivanovich Melissino. Later that year, Kheraskov staged a heroic comedy in verse entitled The Infidel, in which he showcased his religious zeal. This production was the last for the university theater. Kheraskov also organized and managed a number of publications that were published by the university printing house. This included Useful Entertainment (1760-1762), Free Time (1763), Harmless Exercises (1763), and Good Intentions (1764). Kheraskov's circle included a number of young writers (the majority poets) whose writings were featured in these and other university publications. Among them was Ippolit Fyodorovich Bogdanovich, whom Kheraskov enrolled in the university gymnasium invited to lodge with him. In 1762 he published Collection of the Best Works for the Dissemination of Knowledge and to the Work of Pleasure, or a Mixed Library of Various Physical, Economic, and Even Manufactured and Commercial Things. Professor Johann Gotfried Reichel edited Collection, whose material consisted of translations made by students, including those by the future Russian playwright Denis Ivanovich Fonvizin. In 1760 Kheraskov married Elizabeth Vasilevna Nerovnaya, who also wrote poetry; their home became a recognized center for literature in Moscow. = Career in Moscow and St. Petersburg = In January 1762, Kheraskov composed an ode in honor of the newly crowned Emperor Peter III. Six months later, after the Palace Coup of July 1762, he composed one for Catherine the Great. For the rest of his life, on behalf of either himself or Moscow University, Kheraskov would compose poems almost annually dedicated to the empress. He also wrote poems dedicated to Catherine's favorites. A year earlier, in 1761, he published \\"On Humanity,\\" which he dedicated to Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova. In 1762, he dedicated a collection entitled New Odes to her. At the end of 1762, Kheraskov was appointed to a committee to organize a celebration to mark the anniversary of Catherine's coronation. Along with Fyodor Volkov, a celebrated Russian actor, and Sumarokov, he prepared \\"Triumphant Minerva,\\" a three-day pageant in the style of the Carnival of Venice that took place in the summer of 1763. Additionally, he wrote \\"Poems for the Great Masquerade\\" to mark the occasion. On 13 June 1763 Mikhail was named Director of Moscow University and promoted to the civil rank of Collegiate Councillor. At that time, the situation at the university was growing tense as a result of a dispute between the curator and Kheraskov. As Reichel wrote to Miller in St. Petersburg: > The new director is at odds with the curator, with whom it appears the > Chancellery holds the final word. Scholarship, it seems, is something > insignificant. Over the years, the conflict between the curator (Vasily Adodurov), Kheraskov and the university professors reached a boiling point. In May 1765, Adodurov, while examining the affairs of the university gymnasium, questioned the competency and teaching ability of a German law professor named Philipp Dilthey. Dilthey was known for his heavy drinking, crude language, and frequent absences. Without consulting Kheraskov, Adodurov wrote to Catherine and arranged for his dismissal. Kheraskov insisted that as director, he was in charge of the hiring and dismissal of professors. Dilthey was reinstated a year later. Adding to the rift between Kheraskov and Adodurov were the latter's attempts to establish a new university framework, which called for greater censorship of professors and strict discipline of students. Another problem the university faced was related to the language of instruction. Almost the entire faculty consisted of Germans who spoke Russian only with difficulty, if at all. Most lectures were delivered in German, French, and especially Latin, the mastery of which the German professors considered the \\"goal of the university and basis of all the Sciences.\\" One of the Russian professors, Nikolay Popovsky, was even reprimanded in 1758 for delivering lectures in Russian. In May and June 1767, while traveling with Catherine and her court on the Volga River, Kheraskov appealed directly to Catherine, and in 1768, professors were permitted to speak Russian in the classroom. Catherine considered it especially important that jurisprudence should be taught in Russian. Later in 1767, the Russian edition of the Encyclop√©die was issued in three parts, for which Kheraskov had translated three articles, \\"Magic,\\" \\"Narration,\\" and \\"Nature.\\" In 1768, Kheraskov introduced the preliminary censorship of public university speeches and lectures after the speeches of Ivan Andreyevich Tretyakov were deemed to contain \\"dubious and daring expressions.\\" Tretyakov was a graduate of the University of Glasgow, where, along with fellow Moscow University professor Semyon Efimovich Desnitsky, he had studied directly under Adam Smith. His lectures and books were considered to be largely verbatim transcriptions of Smith's lectures, and thus disseminated ideas of the Scottish Enlightenment. In February 1770 Kheraskov traveled to St. Petersburg and in that summer was named the vice president of the Collegium of Mining and promoted to the civil rank of State Councillor. Like in Moscow, his residence in the capital became popular among literary circles. From 1772‚Äì1773 he published the journal Evening, in which the majority of material was published anonymously. Kheraskov also joined the court circle of Grigory Orlov, and maintained friendly relations with him even after Orlov's disgrace. Struggling to balance his civil duties with his literary and theatrical activities, Kheraskov wrote a letter of resignation to Grigory Potemkin, but requested that he keep his salary in order to enter into \\"...a new kind of service to Her Majesty.\\" However, the request was not granted, and in March 1775 Kheraskov resigned without pension at the rank of State Councillor. Soviet scholar Alexander Zapadov considered the resignation a disgrace; he suggests that the Empress denied his request because of his enthusiasm for Freemasonry. Kheraskov had been affiliated with Russian Freemasonry since 1773. In St. Petersburg, he belonged to the \\"Harpocrates\\" lodge. In 1776, he became the Orator of the Osiris lodge, and in 1781 became its honorary member. Kheraskov's return to Moscow in 1775 was connected with the unification of the lodges of Ivan Yelagin, a disgraced Russian historian and poet, and Johann Reichel, a German professor at Moscow University, with whom Kheraskov had quarreled when he was the university's director. In St. Petersburg, the childless Kheraskovs sheltered Anna Karamysheva, and raised her as a daughter. At the age of 13, she married one of Kheraskov's subordinates. She later married the famous Masonic figure Alexander Labzin and became a noted memoirist. After his resignation, Kheraskov actively participated in the Free Russian Assembly and the Free Economic Society, literary and economic societies that promoted advanced methods of farming and estate management modeled on the practices of foreign countries. He was also a member of the editorial board for Nikolay Novikov's philosophical journal Morning Light, the first of its kind. In 1778 Kheraskov completed his epic poem Rossiad, which had taken him eight years to compose. Apparently, the \\"heroic poem\\" was brought to Catherine in manuscript form; the empress appreciated the political significance of the text and Kheraskov was brought back into favor. He received a large cash prize and in June 1778 was named curator of Moscow University. Nicholas Mikhailovich Romanov¬ª, 1905‚Äî1909. = Curator of Moscow University and Freemasonry = Upon his return to the university, Kheraskov immediately undertook several ambitious projects. In December 1778, he established a boarding school for young noblemen. The boarding school produced some of the most prominent Russian literary figures of the early nineteenth-century, such as Vasily Zhukovsky, Mikhail Lermontov, and Fyodor Tyutchev. In 1779, Kheraskov leased the university printing house to Nikolay Novikov for a period of ten years, which allowed him to greatly increase his publishing activity. Specifically, Novikov published Rossiad and began to publish the first edition of Kheraskov's collected works. At the suggestion of Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova, Kheraskov became a member of the recently created Russian Academy, and quotations from his works were included in the Dictionary of the Russian Academy. In 1786, Kheraskov was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir, Second Class. Kheraskov and his wife lived in Moscow at the estate of his half-brother, Nikolai Trubetskoy, or in a country estate Ochakovo, which they owned jointly. At that estate, the couple sometimes entertained the memoirist and agriculturalist Andrey Bolotov. There was an in- house theater in both of Kheraskov's estates, where he would stage his plays. He never abandoned his interest in Freemasonry, and along with the mystic and translator Alexei Kutuzov became one of the founders of the \\"Latona\\" chapter. In 1782 he was initiated into the theoretical degree of the Rosicrucian Society and for two years was a member of his local chapter. Kheraskov's educational projects were connected with his Masonic activities. In 1779, Kheraskov hired Johann Georg Schwarz as the university's Professor of German. Schwarz was a member of Trubetskoy's Masonic lodge in Moscow. On the initiative of Schwarz and with the support of Kheraskov, an open Freemasons Pedagogical (1779) and Translation (1782) Seminary was founded. The latter was established at the expense of members of the so-called \\"Friendly Scientific Society,\\" which included many prominent Masons. The works of novice members of the Friendly Scientific Society and other university students comprised a significant part of the works and translations published in the journals Moscow Monthly Edition (1781), Evening Dawn (1782), and The Resting Industrialist (1784). In 1789, the start of the French Revolution soured Catherine's attitude toward Enlightenment philosophy. As a result, Kheraskov and other Masons were threatened with imperial disgrace. The Moscow commander- in-chief, Alexander Prozorovsky, informed the Empress that Kheraskov arranged secret Masonic rituals and gatherings at Ochakovo. Despite the seriousness of these charges and Catherine's intention to remove him from office, Kheraskov managed to remain as curator thanks to the intercession of the famous poet Gavrila Derzhavin and Platon Zubov, the last of Catherine's lovers. However, after Novikov was arrested in 1792 and his printing house was confiscated, a report written by Prozorovsky informed the Empress that Nikolai Trubetskoy and Kheraskov had destroyed incriminating papers and other materials at Ochakovo. In August 1792, when an imperial decree for Novikov and his accomplices was issued, Kheraskov's name was not mentioned. However, he was now in \\"unofficial\\" disgrace and could not attend to affairs at the university. Nevertheless, he still continued to compose his annual address to the Empress. = Final Years = Unlike his mother, Emperor Paul I was sympathetic to the Masons. As he had for the two previous rulers, Kheraskov addressed an ode to Paul upon the new emperor's coronation in 1796. Later that year, Kheraskov was made Privy Councillor and awarded 600 serfs. In February 1798 an imperial rescript recognized Kheraskov for his poetry. In March 1799 he was awarded the Order of St. Anna, 1st class. Kheraskov dedicated a new poem to the emperor entitled \\"Tsar, or the Savior of Novgorod,\\" for which he was again recognized by imperial rescript. Following Paul's murder in 1801, Kheraskov was briefly dismissed as curator due to a misunderstanding, but he was restored to his position shortly thereafter by Alexander I. For the fourth time, Kheraskov wrote an ode celebrating a new sovereign's reign. In November 1802, the 70-year-old Kheraskov was dismissed from service with a pension \\"by request and due to old age.\\" The elderly poet spent the last years of his life in Moscow engaged in literary work. Up until his death he worked with the journals Herald of Europe, Patriot and Friend of Enlightenment. Kheraskov died on 27 September (9 October), 1807 in Moscow. He was buried at the Donskoy Monastery Cemetery. His tragedy Zareida and Rostislav was published posthumously under a pseudonym. It received an award by the Russian Academy for 500 rubles, which his widow left at the Academy's disposal.  Personality  No comprehensive library of Kheraskov was preserved. His documents personal letters, and correspondence with government officials and literary figures are spread across various Russian collections. Practically all of his contemporaries, both older and younger, commented on his \\"gentle\\" nature and noble character. Kheraskov avoided social events, and even when in the country sought solitude. At Ochakovo, he especially enjoyed sitting in a limewood grove. He usually rose early in the morning and immediately engaged in reading or writing. He had a habit of walking around his office while working and spoke the written texts allowed to himself. The Russian memoirist Yuri Nikitich Bartenev noted that Kheraskov was modest in dress and diet, and abstained from most luxuries. For example, he never wore boots made to order, but bought them at the market. He also did not enjoy card games, which were popular among the eighteenth century aristocracy. Bartenev describes a \\"sullenness\\" that Kheraskov was known for when there were newcomers to his literary circle, but around those he knew well he was admired for his eloquence, and \\"his jokes were always very amusing and reflected his ingenuity and wittiness.\\" References Category:18th-century Russian poets Category:Russian male poets Category:Imperial Russian dramatists and playwrights Category:Russian male dramatists and playwrights Category:Members of the Russian Academy Category:Russian people of Romanian descent Category:Russian nobility Category:Russian Freemasons Category:1733 births Category:1807 deaths Category:19th-century Russian poets Category:18th-century male writers ","title":"Mikhail Kheraskov"},{"id":"2522539","text":"Boy Commandos is a fictional organization from DC Comics first appearing in Detective Comics #64 (June 1942) by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. A combination of \\"kid gang\\" characters, an international cast of young boys fighting Nazis ‚Äî or in their own parlance, \\"the Ratzies\\". Creation Simon & Kirby were hired away from Timely Comics by DC towards the end of 1941, primarily due to their success on Captain America, but without there being a clear purpose to the decision, nor title to work on.Ro, Ronin. Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution (Bloomsbury, 2004) Finding themselves initially embroiled in the Captain Marvel lawsuit, Jack Liebowitz gave them free rein to create or revamp DC heroes. Initially, the duo created new versions of The Sandman, and Manhunter (both of whom bore strong resemblance to their Captain America work), before deciding that \\"kid gangs seemed to be the way to go\\". Teenage sidekicks (Batman's Robin, Captain America's Bucky, etc.) were fast becoming a comics staple, intended to provide young characters with whom youthful readers could identify.Doubt has been cast of the veracity of this - ostensibly editorial - opinion (that child readers desired or required a child character with whom to identify). Notable comics commentators including Jules Feiffer have noted: :\\"The super grownups were the ones I identified with. There was still time to prepare. But Robin the Boy Wonder was my own age. One need only look at him to see he could fight better, swing from a rope better, play ball better, eat better and live better - for while I lived in the East Bronx, Robin lived in a mansion...\\", Feiffer, Jules The Great Comic Book Heroes (Crown, 1964) as quoted in Van Hise, James, Batmania (Pioneer Books, 1989), p. 10 Simon & Kirby's own Sentinels of Liberty (later the Young Allies) had already succeeded in this mold, and had an influence on their subsequent creation. Detective Comics #65 (July 1942). Art by Jack Kirby, Jerry Robinson and Joe Simon. Having already created the \\"Sentinels of Liberty\\" for Timely, they now created for DC the Newsboy Legion (\\"a Dead End Kids-style group led by a police officer in a Captain America- like blue-and-yellow costume, toting a shield\\"). Although America had not yet entered the war, headlines and news stories highlighted the role of British commandos, so Simon and Kirby fused the kid gang with the commando, and created The Boy Commandos. The international group included the French Andre Chavard, the English Alfie Twidgett, the Dutch Jan Haasan and an American only known as \\"Brooklyn\\". Debuting in the pages of Detective ComicsAlthough that title had previously stuck largely to characters who were, as the title implied, detectives of some kind, the onset of war (and America's subsequent involvement in it) both inspired and was requested of comics companies to create patriotic heroes, such as Simon and Kirby's Captain America a year earlier. #64 (the issue #65's cover (left) shows Batman presenting the gang but they appeared first in the issue before) cover-dated June 1942, the team became extremely popular, also appearing in World's Finest Comics (#8-41, 1942-1949) and were then soon spun off into their own title, launching with a 'Winter 1942' date. The title sold \\"over a million copies each month\\", and was one of DC's \\"three biggest hits\\" alongside Superman and Batman. Kirby drew around five pages a day of the title, but Liebowitz requested an even faster turn-around - fearing (as happened) that the two would be drafted, as had many other industry professionals. Simon & Kirby hired \\"inkers, [letterers], colorists, and writers, striving to create a year's worth of tales\\" (Boy Commandos was also a quarterly title until Winter, 1945). Among those hired was a young Gil Kane, who recalls being: :\\"hired to do as many Boy Commandos, Newsboy Legion, and Sandman stories as I could... they gave me scripts and they would do the splashes and they would have it inked\\". Boy Commandos #1 (December 1942). Their first featured anthology series. Penciled by Jack Kirby, inked by Joe Simon. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"most of their criminals are ordinary, either Germans and Japanese or merely human criminals, but there are also exotics like Crazy Quilt, Diamond Hand, and Mr. Bleak, he of the devilish shadow\\". Boy Commandos ran until issue #36 (Nov/Dec 1949), and was edited throughout by Jack Schiff. Among the individuals who assisted Simon and Kirby on the title (and its covers) were future-Superman legend Curt Swan, as well as Steve Brodie, Louis Cazeneuve and Carmine Infantino. Fictional team biography The eponymous characters were Andr√© Chavard from France; Alfie Twidgett from England, Jan Haasan from the Netherlands, and \\"Brooklyn\\" from the United States. An elite commando squad of orphaned children, led by grown-up Captain Rip Carter, they fought on all fronts of the Second World War. In September 1944, the Newsboy Legion teamed up with the Boy Commandos to stop armed and armored traitors based out of New York City.The Newsboy Legion Boy Commandos Special (Oct. 2017) The team's adventures continued well past the war, even though there were many roster changes. Jan left first, having found relatives in his homeland to stay with. Alfie was replaced by a Texan named Tex. Percy Clearweather, a glasses-wearing genius, replaced Andr√©. It was revealed years later that Brooklyn was Dan Turpin, that Andr√© Chavard had become the head of the French Intelligence D√©partement Gamma, and that Alfie Twidgett was now the head of the firm Statistical Occurrences Ltd. (SOL), with his daughter Twiggie. In addition to the aligning of Metropolis Special Crimes Unit's Detective Dan Turpin with \\"Brooklyn\\", the team have seen print in a couple of titles since the late 1940s. In the 1970s, during Kirby's involvement at DC, several of their stories were reprinted in various books, particularly those written and drawn by Kirby himself (e.g. Mister Miracle #6 in February 1972. A reprint Boy Commandos title was published in Sep/Oct 1973 under editor E. Nelson Bridwell, but lasted only two issues before disappearing. The four original members, minus Brooklyn, reappeared late during the run of Len Wein's Blue Beetle, which reintroduced Alfie as the founder and president of Statistical Occurrences Ltd., an insurance company specializing in properties which may attract the activities of superhumans. Using his daughter \\"Twiggie\\" as a mediator, Alfie hires Murray Takamoto, an ex-S.T.A.R. Labs administrator (and college roommate of Ted Kord) who'd worked on a \\"Star Wars\\" satellite program, which S.O.L. had received a contract concerning its protection. Joining Alfie in this venture are his old teammates Andre, now head of the fictional Department Gamma of the French Secret Service, Jan, now a professor working for the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, and their former mentor \\"Rip\\" Carter, now a general. It was implied that they would eventually come into conflict, along with the Blue Beetle, with corrupt European industrialist Klaus Cornelius, who had already used his influence to disband Europe's lead super-hero agency, the Global Guardians, and was working to resurrect the Boy Commandos' old enemy Agent Axis. However, the series ended before the storyline could reach fruition, and no further developments have been mentioned since then, although Cornelius did make a brief cameo during Kurt Busiek's Power Company miniseries. They made an appearance in the most recent incarnation of The Brave and the Bold (issue #9, February 2008), in which they teamed up with fellow World War II heroes, the Blackhawks.

A subspecies, J. excelsa subsp. polycarpos, known as the Persian juniper, occurs in the Alborz and other mountains of Iran east to northwestern Pakistan, and an isolated population in the Jebal Akhdar mountains of Oman; some botanists treat this as a distinct species, J. macropoda. Description Juniperus excelsa is a large shrub or tree reaching tall (rarely ). It has a trunk up to in diameter, and a broadly conical to rounded or irregular crown. The leaves are of two forms, juvenile needle-like leaves 8‚Äì10 mm long on seedlings, and adult scale-leaves 0.6‚Äì3 mm long on older plants. It is largely dioecious with separate male and female plants, but some individual plants produce both sexes. The cones are berry-like, 6‚Äì11 mm in diameter, blue-black with a whitish waxy bloom, and contain 3-6 seeds; they are mature in about 18 months. The male cones are 3‚Äì4 mm long, and shed their pollen in early spring. It often occurs together with Juniperus foetidissima, being distinguished from it by its slenderer shoots 0.7-1.3 mm diameter (1.2‚Äì2 mm diameter in J. foetidissima), and grey-green, rather than mid green, leaves. The Algum wood mentioned in the Bible may be from this species, but is not definitely so. References * *Adams, R. P. (2004). Junipers of the World: The genus Juniperus.

It is the political and cultural capital of the Annang ethnic group in Nigeria (Nair, 1972). The town is located on the A342 highway that parallels the coast, between Calabar to the south east and Aba to the west, with the state capital, Uyo, on this road just to the east. Umuahia is the next major town to the north. Kannan Nair, the noted historian described the town as a cultural and political capital of the Annangs and the Ibibios. The Ibibios live to the east and most of the Annangs live to the south of the town. Ikot Ekpene is known as a regional centre of commerce, with notable exports of palm products, especially palm oil, kernels, raffia products including raffia fibers and its wine, and ground crops of yams, cassava, taro, and corn. The population is made up primarily of the Annang people with a small number of Igbo traders and Hausa Suya vendors. Significant exports also include basket weaving, sculpture, and, most notably, raffia cane furniture (hence the colloquial name of the town). Ikot Ekpene is also known for its technological innovations due to the emergence of Raffia City Hub. Raffia city Hub is an inclusive technological community that supports collaboration, resource sharing, talent hunting and early stage entrepreneurs. History Oral history indicated The Annangs first settled the area in the 16th century. =British Era= Though most inhabitants of the area did not have direct contact with European traders who they called Mbakara until early in the twentieth century, it is believed that European articles of trade reached the people beginning in the 17th century. In November 1903, British troops arrived in the area from Calabar and the following year established a garrison there in January 1904, putting Umoren Eyenobong (known as swordwearer by the Europeans) from Ukana in charge of the immediate Annang people. From Ikot Ekpene the troops marched to Uyo and from there to Abak and Opobo (now Ikot Abasi). Between 1904 and 1910, Ikot Ekpene became part of the Enyong District. In 1914 Enyong District was broken up into two: Enyong and Ikot Ekpene Districts. The new Ikot Ekpene District included Uyo and Abak with the headquarters in Ikot Ekpene town (Akpan, 1967). By 1919 trade with Europeans opened up as the town became an administrative center. The following companies had posts and stores in the town: John Holt's, Cooperative Wholesale Society, Paterson Zochonis (PZ), G. B. Ollivant and the Compagnie Francaise de L'Afrique Occidentale. The establishment of these companies resulted in an exodus from the surrounding areas and made Ikot Ekpene a vibrant metropolis. In 1937, the colonial administration built the main market and separated those who sold imported European goods from indigenous articles. A slaughter house was added to allow for the inspection of meat (Ette, 2020). In 1903, the British sent in troops and a garrison was stationed there at the main entrance to the town known as Control Post. The town was so important to the British that when a proposed road linking Owerri and Calabar in the late 1920s was to bypass the town, the British administrators abandoned the idea in favor of one linking Eket and Owerri in order to bring the town into the loop (Nair, 1972). It became the site of the experiment in local self governance by the British in 1951. It was also the birthplace of the famous Ibibio Welfare Union when James Udo Eka teamed up with Udosen Obot at Methodist school in Ikot Obong Edong (Noah, 1988). Under the British the town became the seat of both the (Annang), Division and (Ikot Ekpene) County Council. Today it is a municipal center in the state of Akwa Ibom. =Independence Era= Ikot Ekpene, probably more than any other town, was seriously impacted in the Biafrian civil war. It had strategic military and political importance to both the Biafrians and Nigerians. The town and the area changed hands at least 3 times in this bitter conflict. Following the war, the new reorganization and state structure led to policies that did not recognize the historic importance of the town as most of the Annang leaders were massacred during the war. Section of Ikot Ekpene craft market showing woven raffia products for sale Like most Annang communities, Ikot Ekpene has a tradition of self-improvement from its sons and daughters, both near and far. Several groups are working together to recapture and rebuild what they fondly call \\"The Raffia City\\". Ikot Ekpene has a long history of transforming the raffia fibre into cloth used in shoes, hats, handbags, mats and with distinctive cultural carvings made out of wood. These unique arts and crafts trades have continued alongside traditional agriculture. Many foreign organizations and churches are present in the area. Four institutions of higher learning have added a richness to the town: the Akwa Ibom state polytechnic, Ikot Osurua, the School of Nursing, the St Joseph Major Theological Seminary and Ritman University.  Sports  The Ikot Ekpene Township Stadium is located in Ikot Ekpene. It is the home of football club Vandrezzer FC, in 2020 the 37th most popular African football club on social mediahttps://scontent- amt2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s960x960/118124640_214773976657556_3804198971384294005_o.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=6RGHQSEK5GMAX- srrj1&_nc_ht=scontent- amt2-1.xx&tp;=7&oh;=8e0a452166008f77f885f1e14125cc54&oe;=5F7EF931.

One of the earliest Valadares recorded was the nobleman Soeiro Aires de Valadares, son of Arias N√∫√±ez de Valadares and Ximena N√∫√±ez, both from Galicia. Soeiro was a member of the curia regis of King Alfonso Henriques and appears confirming royal charters from 1169 to 1179. Because of the proximity of northern Portugal and Galicia, the early Valadares can be found on both sides of the border. Soeiro's first wife was Elvira Nunes Velho. He later married Maria Alfonso, an illegitimate daughter of King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n and his mistress Teresa Gil de Soverosa who had first married √Ålvaro Fern√°ndez de Lara, was later the concubine of her nephew King Alfonso X of Castile and then married as her second husband Suero Arias de Valladares. Also a member of this family was Aldon√ßa Louren√ßo de Valadares, the mother of Ines de Castro. Valladares nobility of Galicia The Valladares noble families aided the Catholic Monarchs of Spain in 1492, in the Reconquista in which Christian troops under orders of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella reconquered Spain and expelled the invading Muslims in the year 1492. The Valladares family are of Spaniards and Portuguess ancestry, and are very popular in Central America specifically in Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico and in Brazil as well (although the surname as valadares in Portuguese). Here are some of their origins from Europe; The Valladares family originated in the ancient kingdom of spain in the northwestern province of Galicia, and the north most municipality of Portugal, and so we can find members of the Valladares family on both sides of the Minho river that divides Spain & Portugal. The family was able to establish themselves in other regions of Spain and become influential members of their communities. They were granted nobility by the Order of Santiago in 1624, and by the Order of Alcantara in 1659. Early Notables Among prominent bearers of the family name in this era was Antonio Gaspar Valladares, Maria Tomasa Valladares and Ana Jacoba Valladares Sarmiento, who were listed in the records of the noble Order of Carlos III. Jos√© Sarmiento de Valladares y Arines-Troncoso Romay, 1st Duke of Atrisco, Grandee of Spain, jure uxoris Count of Moctezuma (1643-1708) was viceroy of New Spain( meaning Mexico, Central America and the southern part of the USA) from December 18, 1696 to November 3, 1701. Diego Sarmiento de Valladares (1615-1695) was a Spanish bishop who was Grand Inquisitor of Spain from 1669 to 1695.(https://www.houseofnames.com/Valladares+-family-crest) The first titled member of the Valladares nobility in Galicia was Luis Sarmiento de Valladares, the first viscount of Meira in 1669 and first marquis de Valladares 1673, the latter title granted by King Charles II of Spain in the second half of the 17th-century.

There are 14 genera in the family, in two subfamilies, Nepinae and Ranatrinae. Members of the genus Ranatra, the most widespread and speciose genus, are sometimes called needle bugs or water stick insects as they are slenderer than Nepa. While water scorpions do not sting with their tail,https://www3.northern.edu/natsource/INVERT1/Waters1.htm they do have a painful bite (strictly speaking a sting by their pointed proboscis), but this is much less harmful to humans than a true scorpion's sting.https://www.britannica.com/animal/water-scorpion Range and habitat Nepidae are found on all continents except Antarctica. They mostly inhabit stagnant or slow-moving freshwater habitats like ponds, marshes, canals and streams. Exceptionally they have also been recorded from hypersaline lakes and brackish lagoons, the Australian genus Goondnomdanepa is restricted to flowing waters, and Nepa anophthalma is adapted to life in caves in Romania. Appearance and ecology Nepa cinerea with open forewings, revealing its usually hidden hindwings and red abdomen siphon or breathing tube, which in some species like this Laccotrephes can be even longer than the body Nepidae are brown insects, but some species have a bright red abdomen that can be seen when the wings are open. Their body is broad and flat (subfamily Nepinae) or long and thin (subfamily Ranatrinae). They are rather poor swimmers and typically crawl about on aquatic vegetation. They can fly, but this is infrequently seen. In most species the body is between long, although the largest such as the East Asian Ranatra chinensis and South American R. magna can approach . Respiration in the adult is achieved by means of the caudal process, which consists of a pair of half-tubes capable of being locked together to form a siphon. Air is conducted through it to the tracheae at the apex of the abdomen when the tip of the tube is thrust above the surface of the water (similar to a snorkel). In some species the siphon is longer than the body, but in others it is shorter, in a few even less than one-tenth of the body length. In immature forms the siphon is often underdeveloped and respiration takes place through six pairs of abdominal spiracles. Their frontal legs are modified into raptorial appendages that are used to grab their prey. They feed primarily on aquatic invertebrates such as other insects, but occasionally take small fish or tadpoles. The eggs, which are laid above the waterline in mud, decomposing vegetation, the stems of plants or rotting wood, are supplied with air by filamentous processes which vary in number among the genera. Subfamilies and genera With about 100 species, Ranatra is the most diverse genus Nepidae has around 250 species in 14 genera divided into two subfamilies, Nepinae and Ranatrinae. Among these the most diverse are the widespread Ranatra (about 100 species) and Laccotrephes (about 60), but the family also includes species-poor genera, like the Ethiopian Borborophilus, Nepella, Nepitella and Paranepa (each with one species), Indian Montonepa (one species), Philippine Borborophyes (one species), and Australian Austronepa (one species) and Goondnomdanepa (three species).

CPE is the primary method of training hospital and hospice chaplains and spiritual care providers in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare, 2012, p. 417. CPE is both a multicultural and interfaith experience that uses real-life ministry encounters of students to improve the ministry and pastoral care provided by caregivers. Theory An underpinning theory of education that structures clinical pastoral education is the \\"Action-Reflection\\" mode of learning. CPE students typically compose \\"verbatims\\" of their pastoral care encounters in which they are invited to reflect upon what occurred and draw insight from these reflections that can be implemented in future pastoral care events.Cobb, Puchalski and Rumbold (eds.), Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare, 2012, p. 294. History Although the practice of pastoral care has a long tradition in Christianity and to some extent in other faith traditions, the systematic analysis of pastoral practice associated with clinical pastoral education had its beginnings in the early 20th century. In 1925, Richard Cabot, a physician and adjunct lecturer at the Harvard Divinity School, published an article in Survey Graphic suggesting that every candidate for ministry receive clinical training for pastoral work similar to the clinical training offered to medical students. The reprint is available as part of the project: In the 1930s, the Rev. Anton Boisen placed theological students at the Chicago Theological Seminary in supervised contact with patients in mental hospitals, a flagship program that later resulted in the forming of the ACPE. Accrediting bodies CPE in Australia and New Zealand is conducted by six CPE accrediting associations that consult together for common curricula and standards of practice under an umbrella association, the Australia New Zealand Association of Clinical Pastoral Education (ANZACPE). The six constituent associations are: New South Wales College of Clinical Pastoral Education (New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory); Queensland Institute of Clinical Pastoral Education; Association for Supervised Pastoral Education in Australia (Victoria and Tasmania); Association for Clinical Pastoral Education in Western Australia; South Australia and Northern Territory Association for Clinical Pastoral Education; and New Zealand Association for Clinical Pastoral Education. In the United States there are currently two organizations who are recognized by the United States Department of Education. The Association for Clinical Pastoral Education is recognized as an accrediting agency for CPE programs by the U.S. Department of Education. The Institute for Clinical Pastoral Training is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education & Training (ACCET). ACCET is listed by the U.S. Department of Education as a nationally recognized accrediting agency.

V√≠deo Show was a long-running Brazilian television program on Rede Globo that aired from 20 March 1983 to 11 January 2019. From its debut in 1983 to 1994, the show aired weekly. From 1994 to 2019, it aired from Monday to Friday at 2p.m. Brasilia Time following Jornal Hoje and was one of the network's most-watched afternoon shows. On 8 January 2019, Rede Globo announced the program's cancellation due to declining viewership; the show's final episode aired three days later. Format This format was that of a daily \\"electronic magazine\\", where the network's backstages are shown, with on-set and behind- the-scenes footage on Globo's series and telenovelas, including bloopers, interviews with the actors, actresses, directors and authors, funny segments with scenes from the telenovelas, and old videos from the network's archives through Memoria Globo. V√≠deo Show relaunched as a hybrid game show/variety show on 18 November 2013 with the debut of Zeca Camargo (former host of Fant√°stico) and Ricardo Waddington. However, in conjunction of Globo's 50th anniversary, V√≠deo Show reverted to its original format and the studio audience was removed. This relaunch marked the return of Miguel Falabella (the longest-serving presenter; 1987‚Äì2002), as one of the hosts and Cissa Guimar√£es, the show's reporter. Otaviano Costa became a permanent host and Monica Iozzi became Costa's co-host, replacing Zeca Camargo. The show's final presenters were Joaquim Lopes and Sophia Abrah√£o. Initially, it was presented by T√°ssia Camargo in its inception, years later by Marcelo Tas (current member of CQC Brazil), the actors Miguel Falabella, Andr√© Marques, the host Ang√©lica, Fernanda Lima and Ana Furtado. Otaviano Costa, Marcela Monteiro and Dani Monteiro later served as presenters. This version presented a summary of current views and ancient views on TV. From 2001 to 2011, there was a \\"V√≠deo Game\\" segment, consisting of a week-long game show hosted by Ang√©lica, where actors, divided into two teams, must answer questions and complete funny tasks related to the network's current and/or past shows. The winner was announced on Friday, and donated the prize to a charity of their choice. The opening theme was based on \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" by Michael Jackson; an instrumental version of the song composed by Maynard Ferguson was used for most of the show's run. V√≠deo Show Walk of Fame \\"V√≠deo Show Walk of Fame\\" was a segment where artists were invited to make their mark in a block of cement, following the same modes of ceremonies of TCL Chinese Theatre. Each concrete block was to be part of a future Hall of Fame at the studios of Globo (Est√∫dios Globo) in Rio de Janeiro.

Plot The film features two parallel stories. The first one is set in an unknown past time and is about a young man (Cl√©menti) who wanders in a volcanic landscape (shot around Etna) and turns into a cannibal. The man joins forces with a thug (Citti) and ravages the countryside. At the end, his company gets arrested and during his execution, he recites the famous tagline of the film: \\"I killed my father, I ate human flesh and I quiver with joy.\\" The story is about the human capacity of destruction and a rebellion against the social prerequisites implied against it. The second story is about Herr Klotz (Lionelli), a German industrialist and his young son Julian (L√©aud) who live in 1960s Germany. Julian, instead of passing time with his radically politicised fianc√©e Ida (Wiazemsky), prefers to build relationships with pigs. Herr Klotz, on the other hand, with his loyal aide Hans Guenther (Ferreri), tries to solve his rivalry with fellow industrialist Herdhitze (Tognazzi). The two industrialists join forces while Julian gets eaten by pigs in the sty. Herdhitze intends to conceal the event. The story attempts to provide a link between the Third Reich and Wirtschaftswunder Germany.

For almost 48 years, it was the B&O;'s flagship passenger train, noted for personalized service and innovation. At the time of its discontinuation on May 1, 1971, when Amtrak took over most rail passenger service in the U.S., the Capitol Limited operated between Washington and Chicago. History The Capitol Limited in its early years The Capitol Limited was inaugurated on May 12, 1923, as an all-Pullman sleeping car train running from Pennsylvania Station in New York City to Chicago, via Washington, D.C. Once west of the Pennsy's Newark station in New Jersey, the train used the Lehigh Valley and Reading Railroad as far as Philadelphia, where it reached B&O;'s own rails to Chicago. It was designed to compete against the luxury trains of the rival Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad. Although the B&O;'s longer route put it at a competitive disadvantage in New York for time- sensitive travelers, the B&O; offered such luxuries in the 1920s as onboard secretaries, barbers, manicures, and valets.Harry Stegmaier, Baltimore & Ohio Passenger Service, Vol. 2 - Route of the Capitol Limited. Lynchburg, Va.: TLC Publishing, 1997 (). The Capitol's \\"Martha Washington\\"-series dining cars were particularly noted for their Chesapeake Bay cuisine, served in ornate cars with leaded glass windows, glass chandeliers, and colonial-style furnishings. The Capitol Limited derived much of its passenger traffic from businessmen and government officials traveling between Washington and the midwest. Brand-new diesel equipment in 1937 On September 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania Railroad terminated its contract with the B&O;, which had permitted the latter to use the \\"Pennsy's\\" Hudson River tunnels and Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.John F. Stover, History of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. W. Lafayette, Ind.: Purdue University Press, 1987. () Thereafter, the Capitol Limited, along with all other B&O; passenger trains to New York, operated over the Jersey Central's main line from the connection with the Reading in Bound Brook into its Jersey City terminal, where passengers were then transferred to buses that met the train right on the platform. These buses were ferried across the Hudson River into Manhattan, where they proceeded to various \\"stations\\" including the Vanderbilt Hotel, Wanamaker's, Columbus Circle, and Rockefeller Center, as well as Brooklyn.Herbert H. Harwood, Jr., Royal Blue Line. Sykesville, Md.: Greenberg Publishing, 1990. () In 1938, the B&O; dieselized the train after purchasing two sets of the new EA and EB locomotives from General Motors' Electro-Motive Corporation. The B&O; was heavily in debt during the Depression and could not afford to buy new equipment, so it rebuilt its old heavyweight passenger cars into streamlined ones when the diesels were introduced in 1938, making the Capitol Limited the first dieselized streamlined train in the eastern U.S. By September 1940, the through sleeping cars operating to New York were all streamlined. For the aesthetic features of the train, the B&O; turned to renowned industrial designer Otto Kuhler, who turned the Cap, as it was affectionately known, into a regal operation complete with a stunning royal blue, silver, and gold pin-striping livery (a paint scheme that would become one of the classics of the streamliner era).

In February, 1956, the Capitol Limited departed Jersey City at 12:45 p.m. as train # 5\\\\. As an express, all-Pullman sleeping car train, the Capitol Limited made limited stops along its route to Chicago. See the table at right for a list of all station stops (major cities are highlighted in blue and Jersey City bus/ferry connections are in yellow). This all-Pullman configuration allowed passengers to avoid the process of transferring between the B&O;'s Grand Central Station and Dearborn Station, where the Santa Fe's trains departed from. Eastbound, the train departed Chicago at 4:30 p.m. as train # 6\\\\. This scheduled departure was timed so that travelers riding western railroads such as the Santa Fe, Chicago and North Western Railway, or the Burlington could readily connect for an eastward journey on B&O;'s deluxe train. During the height of train travel in the 1920s, the Capitol Limited occasionally ran in multiple sections, although never as frequently or extensively as the competing Pennsylvania Railroad's Broadway Limited and New York Central Railroad's 20th Century Limited. The B&O; was the first railroad to introduce air conditioning on its trains, beginning with the Columbian in 1931, followed by the Capitol Limited on May 22, 1932, well ahead of its competitors. This innovation received favorable comment nationwide by the news media. The Capitol Limited received streamlined heavyweight sleeping and dining cars in 1938. A typical consist included the following: baggage-dormitory, 8-section 1-drawing room 1-compartment sleeping car, dining car, three to four 8-section 5-double bedroom sleeping cars, 14-section sleeping car, two 12-section 1-drawing room sleeping cars, and a sleeper-buffet-lounge with a drawing room and three compartments. In 1941 these cars were augmented by several lightweight 10-roomette 5-bedroom sleeping cars. By the early 1950s, the B&O; had combined through cars for the Capitol Limited, the Columbian (# 25), and the Ambassador (# 19) into one train between New York and Washington. Beyond Washington, the three trains then operated separately, with several additional Washington-to- Chicago Pullman sleeping cars added to the Capitol Limited, along with a twin- unit dining car, two Strata-Dome dome cars, club car, and a flat-end observation car. The B&O; re-equipped the Capitol Limited with new, streamlined sleeping cars in 1950 and 1954, including the new duplex-roomette type. The Pullmans were named after rivers and lakes along the train's route, such as \\"Cacapon\\" and \\"Wawasee\\". Dome cars \\"Moonlight Dome\\" and \\"Starlight Dome\\", having sleeping compartments on their lower levels, were added on January 8, 1951. A twin-unit dining car seating 64 passengers at a time was obtained from the New York Central in 1957. Discontinuance The Capitol Limited in October 1970 The Capitol Limited, in common with most name trains in the U.S. by the mid-1950s, suffered steadily declining patronage as the traveling public abandoned trains in favor of airplanes and the automobile. The B&O; gave up on competing with the Pennsylvania Railroad into New York, discontinuing all passenger service north of Baltimore on April 26, 1958. Thereafter, the Capitol Limited operated between Washington and Chicago as a through train, with a few cars originating in Baltimore until 1966. Other B&O; passenger trains were combined with the Capitol Limited: the Ambassador to Detroit and the formerly all-coach Columbian to Chicago. The combined train in the early 1960s had as many as 22 cars pulled by five locomotives. To stem the loss of passengers and resulting deficits, the B&O; in the early 1960s offered reduced mid-week fares, auto shipment for passengers (similar in concept to the Auto Train), and onboard movies, to attract more passengers. The train was marginally profitable, when mail and express revenue was included. The loss in 1967 of mail and express contracts, which by then accounted for almost 70 percent of passenger train revenue for the B&O;, severely affected the B&O;'s passenger service. The Post Office Department's cancellation of its mail contract for the Capitol Limited and other trains on October 28, 1967, was the death knell. Many passenger trains were dropped and the consist of the Capitol Limited was considerably reduced. B&O; discontinued all long-distance train service to Baltimore's Camden Station. Between October 1966, and April 1971, a connecting RDC operated between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., as train # 105.Stephen J. Salamon etal., Baltimore and Ohio - Reflections of the Capitol Dome. Silver Spring, Md.: Old Line Graphics, 1993. () By June, 1969, two E diesel electric engines pulled a train consisting of one baggage car, sleeper (10/6), one diner / lounge, one dome coach, and four coaches.Kevin McKinney, \\"Chicago Afternoon\\", Passenger Train Journal, Summer, 1969, Flossmoor, Il., pg 14. With the advent of Amtrak on May 1, 1971, the Capitol Limited was discontinued by the B&O;, along with all of its other passenger trains save local commuter services. For the final run of the old Capitol Limited on April 29, 1971, the B&O; ran the entire trainset from Baltimore's Camden Station, including the dome car. The B&O; printed special commemorative tickets and returned its bottled Deer Park spring water and B&O;'s signature, \\"all-you- can-eat\\" giant salad bowls to the final run's dining car, some of the Capitol Limited 's amenities from more prosperous times. A 31-year veteran dining car waiter on the last run of the Capitol Limited recalled to a reporter for The Baltimore Sun that, \\"all the vegetables we served were freshly cooked on board‚Äîno frozen or canned food at all.\\"Michael J. Clark, \\"Capitol Limited Now Page In Rail History\\", The Baltimore Sun, May 1, 1971. At its inception, Amtrak did not continue any of the B&O;'s former passenger train routes, and the Capitol Limited ended its 48-year run on the B&O.; After a lapse of ten years, Amtrak revived Washington‚ÄìChicago service using the same B&O; tracks (now CSX Transportation) between Washington and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the Amtrak Capitol Limited.

Keane participated in one of the strangest turns of events in baseball history in , his final season at the helm of the St. Louis Cardinals. Playing and managing career Keane never played in the major leagues; beginning in 1930, he was a shortstop in the Cardinals' minor league system but suffered a head injury in 1935 after being hit by a pitch and lay in a coma for weeks. He began his managing career in 1938 in the Cardinals' organization, working his way from Class D (then the lowest rung on the ladder) to Triple-A, where he spent a decade as manager of top St. Louis farm clubs. His career win-loss record as a manager in the minor leagues was over 17 seasons. Keane finally reached the majors in 1959, when he was named the Cardinals' third-base coach. He replaced Solly Hemus as manager on July 6, 1961. In his 3¬Ω seasons as Cardinal pilot, he compiled a record of and his crucial, positive role in mentoring young Cardinal players, especially star pitcher Bob Gibson, is chronicled in the David Halberstam book October 1964. =1964: Triumph amid turmoil= In August 1964, with Cardinals seemingly out of the race, team owner August \\"Gussie\\" Busch became convinced (possibly by Branch Rickey, whom he had hired as a consultant) that only a thorough housecleaning of Cardinal management would bring him the pennant he had craved since he bought the team in 1953. On August 17, he fired (or accepted the resignations of) almost every senior St. Louis front office executive. Keane was temporarily spared, but Busch was secretly negotiating with Leo Durocher (then a coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers) to become manager at the close of the 1964 season. However, in the last two weeks of the season, the front- running Philadelphia Phillies ‚Äî who had seemed a lock for the pennant ‚Äî unexpectedly began to unravel while both the Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds got hot. The Phillies lost ten straight games, creating a four-team scramble for the National League pennant, involving the Phils, Cards, Reds and San Francisco Giants. Philadelphia came to St. Louis after losing seven straight at home and were swept by the Cardinals, who notched their eighth straight win and moved into first place at 92‚Äì67, with a three-game series at home with the lowly New York Mets (51‚Äì108) remaining. The Cardinals lost the first two, which dropped them into a tie with Cincinnati, one ahead of Philadelphia. On the final day of the regular season on Sunday, October 4, the Phillies blanked the Reds 10‚Äì0 and the Cardinals took the Mets 11‚Äì5 to avoid a three-way playoff and clinched their first NL pennant since 1946; they then defeated the New York Yankees in a seven-game World Series. After winning the World Series on October 15, the Cardinals held a press conference the next day. Most expected that the team would formally announce a contract extension for Keane. Instead, Keane handed owner Busch and new general manager Bob Howsam (Bing Devine had been fired as GM on August 17) a surprise letter of resignation that he had written late in September, at the height of the pennant chase. The Cardinals then bypassed Durocher entirely and instead hired longtime fan favorite Red Schoendienst, a Hall of Fame second baseman and one of Keane's coaches, as the club's new manager. =Manager of 1965 Yankees= Shortly after his resignation, Keane became the surprise new manager of the Yankees on October 20, who reassigned first-year manager Yogi Berra on October 16, the day after the World Series. It was later revealed that the Yankees had made an informal inquiry about Keane's interest in the job during the 1964 season.Halberstam, David. October 1964. The Keane-Yankees pairing was not a good match; while the Yankees were coming off five straight American League pennants and 15 league championships in 18 years, the 1965 team was on a downhill slide. The circumstances of Keane's hiring caused a significant credibility gap with the players, and his aloof, distant manner did little to help. Keane's first team finished in sixth place at , their first losing season in forty years, and 25 games behind the Minnesota Twins. When the 1966 version won only four of their first 20 games, Keane became the first Yankee manager to be fired in midseason since 1910. Prior to their game at California on Saturday, May 7, he was replaced by Ralph Houk, the team's general manager, who had managed the team from 1961 to 1963. The Yankees did not respond to Houk either and finished in tenth (last) place, the first time in the cellar since 1912. Keane's record with New York gave him a career managerial mark of over six seasons. Post-managerial career Keane is described in Jim Bouton's Ball Four as being prone to panic, and someone who was \\"willing to sacrifice a season to win a game\\" by putting injured stars into the lineup before their injuries had fully healed. Bouton tells a humorous anecdote of Keane pressuring Mickey Mantle to play on a bad leg. But in Keane's defense, Bouton also noted that general manager Houk and the team unfairly used Keane as the excuse for their losing records in 1965 and 1966, which were actually the result of an aging team with a depleted farm system. Death In December 1966, Keane accepted a scouting post with the California Angels. He suffered a fatal heart attack one month later at age 55 at his home in Houston, Texas. Keane had lived in Houston since his days as player and (later) manager for the Cardinals' longtime Texas League farm team, the Houston Buffaloes.The New York Times, January 7, 1966 In Bouton's book, I Managed Good, But Boy Did They Play Bad, a collection of essays and stories about past Major League managers, he wrote that Keane seemed to be in awe of the Yankees, and that he underestimated the problems the team faced. Bouton felt that the immense pressure and stress of managing the Yankees through their inevitable collapse likely led to his death.

FILM Ferrania had been founded in 1923 as a maker of photographic film, papers, and photographic equipment, including cameras. The company was purchased in 1964 by the 3M company to become Ferrania 3M, until it was spun off in 1996 to 3M's Imation division. In 1999, Ferrania was acquired by Schroder Ventures and then spun off as a separate company. Subsequently, it was acquired by a Genoese shipping company, Gruppo Messina (Ignazio Messina & Co. S.p.A) who ceased photographic activities in 2009. The company was re-founded in 2013 to build a new film manufacturing base using small portions of the historic campus.  History  = Original Ferrania = The roots to the Ferrania company lie with the 1882-founded explosives manufacturer SIPE (Societ√† Italiana Prodotti Esplodenti, \\"Italian Society of Explosive Products\\"). World War I saw a wide extension of business for SIPE, including the establishment of a new plant situated in the Ferrania hamlet of Cairo Montenotte. With the production and chemical properties of explosives and early film being very similar, towards the end of the war in 1917 SIPE founded a subsidiary called FILM (Fabbrica Italiana Lamine Milano, \\"Italian Lamination Factory, Milan\\") co-owned by the French Path√© Brothers, which effectively became the film company Ferrania, founded in 1923. In 1932, Ferrania acquired the Milanese photographic plate manufacturer Cappelli, to temporarily become Cappelli-Ferrania, and soon after also Tensi, the city's other large photographic plate manufacturer, before renaming itself back to just Ferrania in 1938. Ferrania's widest expansion and peak in popularity came in the post-World War II era after 1945, producing films such as Ferraniacolor or the black-and-white Pancro 30 (P30) used by famous Italian directors such as Pier Paolo Pasolini, Vittorio De Sica or Federico Fellini for many of their films. In the later years following the 1964 acquisition by 3M and as part of Imation, the company manufactured and sold photographic film under the Solaris, Dynachrome, and Scotch Chrome brands, as well as hundreds of private label products. Up until 2007, Ferrania remained the only manufacturer of 126 ‚ÄúInstamatic‚Äù films after Kodak discontinued them in 1999. In July 2008, the company's President announced to its unions that manufacture of color film products would cease in December 2008, although as late as March 2009, Ferrania customer service stated that they were still producing 135 format color film in 200 and 400 ASA. However, all manufacture of photographic film had ceased by the end of that year, and the last building was locked down in 2010. In October 2012, Ferrania laid off 198 out of 230 employees formerly working in the manufacture and processing of film. = FILM Ferrania = In 2013, the photographic film production line was acquired by the new company FILM Ferrania s.r.l. which took over some of Ferrania's manufacturing equipment and buildings, as well as a number of those Ferrania technicians laid off in 2012. FILM Ferrania inherited the historic brand Ferrania to launch analog products suitable for the actual needs of the cine/photo market. In 2013, FILM Ferrania announced an intention to produce new versions of the historic Solaris FG-100 Plus color negative film and Scotch Chrome 100 color slide film in a variety of formats, with a potential emphasis on cine film. In an interview, Nicola Baldini, chief of the new company, stated his intention of also bringing back black-and-white films, especially the historical Ferrania P30. On November 19, 2013 Film Ferrania presented the main core of production and R&D;, formed by eight people with years of experience in the field, who are listed by their names, biography, and photos, on the company's website. On September 2014, Film Ferrania, after an online survey, announced a crowdfounding on the platform Kickstarter to obtain $250,000 from the founders to buy some machines from the old plant of Ferrania. On October 29, 2014 Film Ferrania terminated the fundraising campaign reaching $322,420 (128% of the original target), and announced that as a prize for the donations, they will send films of the first batch of 35mm, 120, super8 and 16mm test rolls based on the original Scotch Chrome 100. However, Film Ferrania suffered numerous production delays due to asbestos discoveries, and numerous infrastructural issues. In late 2015, FILM Ferrania CEO Baldini told German magazine Cine 8-16 that the new time schedule was to start the first test batch to send to donators by spring 2016, which will include a line of color reversal films based on ScotchChrome in the ISO speeds and color balances of 64D, 100D, 200D, 400D, 640T, and 800/3200T, in the formats of 135 and 120 for still photography, as well as Super8 and 16mm. Later, a negative line based on the Solaris stock will follow in speeds of 100, 200 and 400 ISO. A box of P30 alpha On February 1, 2017 FILM Ferrania presented a new black and white film ‚Äì P30 Alpha.Announcing FERRANIA P30¬Æ ALPHA 35mm film It is a panchromatic, 80 ASA speed film with a very high silver content, based on the old formula used to produce cinematographic films. Although the first film produced by FILM Ferrania was supposed to be a color reversal film, company decided to produce a test batch of black and white film to test the restored machines used to produce film. After seeing the results from the test batch company owners decided to release the P302017: The year that film returned as an alpha version, to be improved upon based on user feedback. In early December 2019, Film Ferrania announced the availability of the final version of P30 to customers from North America.

They are specialized smooth muscle cells mainly in the walls of the afferent arterioles (and some in the efferent arterioles) that deliver blood to the glomerulus. In synthesizing renin, they play a critical role in the renin‚Äìangiotensin system and thus in autoregulation of the kidney. Juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin in response to a drop in pressure detected by stretch receptors in the vascular walls, or when stimulated by macula densa cells. Macula densa cells are located in the distal convoluted tubule, and stimulate juxtaglomerular cells to release renin when they detect a drop in sodium concentration in tubular fluid. Together, juxtaglomerular cells, extraglomerular mesangial cells and macula densa cells comprise the juxtaglomerular apparatus. In appropriately stained tissue sections, juxtaglomerular cells are distinguished by their granulated cytoplasm. The juxtaglomerular cell is a cell that is located near the glomerulus, hence its name. Similar to cardiac tissue, juxtaglomerular cells harbor Œ≤1 adrenergic receptors. When stimulated by epinephrine or norepinephrine, these receptors induce the secretion of renin. These cells also respond directly to a decrease in systemic blood pressure which is manifested as a lower renal perfusion pressure.

It is the southernmost of the Garvellachs archipelago and lies in the Firth of Lorne between Mull and Argyll. The name is Gaelic for \\"rocky place of the saint\\". About 542, St. Brendan the Navigator founded a monastery on Eilach, presumed to be the island, possibly because of the combination of its isolation and good grazing. Columba is believed to have visited the island and it is one of the proposed locations of the Columban retreat isle of Hinba. Eileach an Naoimh may be the burial site of Columba's mother Eithne.Pallister, Marian (2005) Lost Argyll: Argyll's Lost Heritage. Edinburgh. Birlinn.

Remains of a chapel on Eileach an Naoimh The monastery was destroyed by ‚Äì or, at least, may have become excessively vulnerable to ‚Äì Viking raiders, from about 800. The island has probably seen only intermittent occupation since, which has contributed to the survival of the ruins of many of the monastic buildings, including two chapels, beehive cells, and a graveyard with three crosses and another circular grave. The cells are contained in a pentagonal enclosure overlooking the rocky landing place on the south, which is guarded by various skerries. Beyond the enclosure there is another cell with two rooms. The oldest chapel is rectangular and may date from the 11th or 12th centuries.Pallister (2005) op cit pages 133-4.

SNH Commissioned Report No.374. Scottish Natural Heritage. Retrieved 13 Feb 2011. If the ruins date from the time of Brendan this would potentially make them the oldest extant church buildings in Britain, although the earliest written record of their existence dates from the late 9th century. There is no ferry service, and transport to the island and its neighbours must be arranged privately.

As a footballer, Sherwin played in goal for County from 10 November 1883 until 10 November 1888 and was, according to the sportswriter \\"Tityrus\\" (the pseudonym of J.A.H. Catton, editor of the Athletic News), the idol of the crowd despite his unpromising physique: :\\"Although only 5ft. 9ins, and bordering on 17 stone, he was a kind of forerunner to the mighty Foulke... very nimble, as quick a custodian as he was a wicket-keeper. In one match, when the Blackburn Rovers were playing at the Trent Bridge ground, that sturdy and skilful outside right, Joseph Morris Lofthouse, thought he would have a tilt with Sherwin. :\\"He charged him, and rebounded. Sherwin said: \\"Young man, you'll hurt yourself if you do that again.\\" Undeterred, Lofthouse returned to the attack, but Sherwin stepped aside with the alacrity of a dancer, and the Lancashire lad found out how hard was the goalpost and how sharp its edge. :\\"Sherwin was a wonder. It was the custom in those days for teams to entertain each other to dinner after a match... At one banquet Sherwin \\"obliged\\" with Oh, Dem Golden Slippers, and surprised the gathering with a jig and a somersault. At seventeen stones!\\" Another source states that ‚ÄòMordy Sherwin‚Äô was an agile and reliable goalkeeper, if somewhat eccentric. Proving that today‚Äôs over-exuberant celebrations on scoring are nothing new, ‚ÄòMordy‚Äô was given to treating the spectators behind his goal to a cartwheeling performance when the Magpies scored! Mordecai Sherwin played just the one League match. The venue was Trent Bridge, Nottingham. The date was 10 November 1888 and the opposition was Accrington. For a November‚Äôs day the weather was pleasant and the 8,000 crowd saw some fine attacking football. Accrington forward Billy Barbour put his side ahead but not long after Harry Daft leveled the scores and Sherwin entertained the crowd with one of his cartwheels. The match renewed the rivalry between Accrington forward Joe Lofthouse (see above for details) but Lofthouse got the better in this match by restoring Accrington‚Äô lead. 2-1 to Accrington at half-time. The second-half saw Notts County get the better of the play, Charles Shelton equalizing for County and then Bob Jardine putting County ahead for the first time in the match. As the match wore on County had two defenders injured so it was no surprise when Billy Barbour got his brace and the match finished a draw, 3-3, a point each. In 1888-1889 season Sherwin also played in three F.A. Cup ties with Notts County winning all three. The victory at Recreation Ground, Staveley, against Staveley on 8 December 1888 was Sherwin‚Äô last game for Notts County. County won 3-1. (registration & fee required) As a cricketer, Sherwin captained Nottinghamshire in 1887 and 1888. He also played three Test matches for England on the tour to Australia in 1886/7. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1891. After he retired as a cricketer, he umpired until 1901, and even stood in one Test in 1899. By trade, Sherwin was a publican. Sherwin had a wife, Emma, and at least six children, Mary, William, Emma, Ellen, Mordecai and Frederick. The name of Arthur Conan Doyle's most famous character, Sherlock Holmes, is said to have been inspired partially by Sherwin, and partially by Frank Shacklock. References *Catton, J.A.H.

Koontz. The plot centers on five pivotal moments in the life of a self-proclaimed \\"lummox\\" named James \\"Jimmy\\" Tock. Plot summary James Tock was born in Snow County Hospital in Colorado and at the exact moment his grandfather, Josef Tock, a pastry chef, dies of a stroke. Though crippled by a stroke earlier in the week, moments before his death, Josef recovers miraculously to impart on his son Rudy ten cryptic predictions: among them that his grandchild will be named James‚Äîbut that everyone will call him Jimmy. Josef also predicts five terrible days to come in his grandson's life. Coherent though his bizarre speech may be, Josef Tock does not recover from this event, but expires just as the baby is born. Earlier in the evening, Rudy Tock made the acquaintance of a strange man, Konrad Beezo. Beezo is a clown for the very circus Tock's pass is for, and is a fitful, spiteful, creepy, chain-smoking individual half in his clown costume. His wife Natalie, a trapeze artist of some renown and born of a good family, is lying in childbirth, says he, and her relatives have virtually disowned her for marrying him. He speaks glowingly of his soon-to-be-born son, who is to be named \\"Punchinello\\", and will carry on the fine tradition of clowning. He speaks venomously of his father-in-law, using many colorful epithets. Tock is only too grateful to leave Beezo. However, the grief for his father's death was short-lived. Beezo, upon learning Natalie died in childbirth, goes insane ranting about her family sending assassins to kill her and begins shooting, killing a doctor and a nurse. Tock, in perhaps the one moment of heroism in his meek baker's life, convinces the mad clown his enemies have left, and momentarily quells his anger. Jimmy Tock writes the book, a loose autobiography of personal experience, reminisces, and second- or even third-hand accounts of events, transcribing it from a series of tapes on the eve of his fifth and final terrible day. The narrative is given in an often self-deprecating, comically understated manner. However, certain experiences stand out starkly, most noticeably blundering into a harrowing, yet almost surreal, bank robbery by a trio of plastique-wielding crazed history buff clowns led by none other than Punchinello Beezo‚Äîin which Jimmy gradually realizes he's falling for a comely fellow hostage and a dangerous game of chicken with a severely disturbed stalker on an icy road the night his wife Lorrie, the former fellow hostage is about to deliver their first child (on the second predicted date). The man after the Tocks is none other than Konrad Beezo himself, looking for retribution for his imprisoned, and accidentally-gelded son. His mad obsession with the family frames both this terrible day and the next predicted day for Beezo desires a male Tock child as his prize, a new son to raise in the fine clown tradition. The lunatic will do whatever he must to collect what he believes due him, including numerous facial reconstructive surgeries to assume new identities and escape the grasp of the law. Jimmy believes that everyone in the world is tenebrously yet inexorably connected to one another, just as his toes were at birth. This phenomenon is often called \\"Six degrees of separation\\". Punchinello, who is currently imprisoned, is asked by Jimmy and Lorrie, who aided in his conviction and sentencing, to donate one of his kidneys to help save the life of Annie Tock, the daughter of Jimmy and Lorrie. Punchinello only agrees to the donation in return for multiple favors that are frivolous by comparison to the precious kidney. As the deal is about to be complete, Punchinello asks that Jimmy kills Virgilio Vivacemente as one last favor. As the prophecies are fulfilled one by one, and he survives each, Jimmy learns many things about himself‚Äîas well as Konrad, Natalie, Punchinello, and Konrad's father-in-law, Virgilio Vivacemente, the vain, sadistic patriarch of the world-famous acrobatic clan who casts his long shadow over the lives of both the Tocks and the Beezos. Some of Jimmy's revelations are beautiful; others fearsome; still others shake his meek, lumbering pastry chef's life to the foundation and cause him to reflect on the true meaning of syndactyly‚Äîas both an ailment and a life's philosophy.

The School offers a unique research-based education with a strong international standing within the fields of architecture, urbanism, design and landscape architecture AHO offers three full-time master's programmes: Master of Architecture, Master of Design and Master of Landscape Architecture - the last programme is offered in Oslo and at the Arctic University in Troms√∏. The school also offers post- professional Master‚Äôs courses in Urbanism and Architectural Conservation. AHO offers a single type of doctoral degree, the Doctor of Philosophy. History The school was established directly after World War II as a ¬´crisis course¬ª for students of architecture who were unable to finish their degree due to the outbreak of the war. Prior to this, the only Norwegian option for obtaining an architectural degree was at Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) in Trondheim. All through the first half of the twentieth century, a group of architects had worked hard towards the establishment of an architectural school that was more aesthetically and academically oriented than a polytechnic education. The school was finally located in Oslo, since it was generally felt that the capital had access to many of the nation‚Äôs best practicing architects. In the beginning, the architectural course was part of the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry. In 1961 The Oslo School of Architecture was established as an independent school, and, from 1968, located in St. Olavs gate. In 1979, the first formal education in industrial design in Norway was offered as a two-year postgraduate study. A full degree program was established in 1983, and in 1989 this was placed under the direction of The Norwegian Arts and Crafts School. Then, in 1996, the Institute of Industrial Design became part of the Oslo School of Architecture. Master of Landscape Architecture became part of AHO‚Äôs master‚Äôs programmes in 2004. In 2005, The Oslo School of Architecture changed name to The Oslo School of Architecture and Design. In 2009, the Institute of Industrial Design changed its name to the Institute of Design. In 2001 the school moved to new facilities at Vulkan, a revitalised industrial area near the Aker River. In a central, innovative, creative and cultural part of the city. The school lays adjacent to the Oslo National Academy of the Arts and the recently opened Food Hall. In 2005 the school changed its name to The Oslo School of Architecture and Design.

History Valley Forge Council shoulder patch Philadelphia Council shoulder patch The present council is the result of the 1996 merger of Philadelphia and Valley Forge councils. Philadelphia Council was founded in 1911. In 1913, the Council opened one of the earliest Scout camps in the United States, Treasure Island Scout Reservation, near Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania. Two years later, Dr. E. Urner Goodman and Carrol Edson founded the Order of the Arrow there, inducting the first members on July 16, 1915. Philadelphia Council opened Camp Hart (later Hart Scout Reservation) in Green Lane, Pennsylvania in 1930. The Valley Forge Council began operation in the 1910s as Delaware and Montgomery County Council, although the council office was never within the council boundaries (in Center City Philadelphia until the 1960s when it was moved to Valley Forge in Chester County.) The council was renamed \\"Valley Forge Council\\" in the late 1930s. The council was named for the George Washington's historic winter encampment of 1777-78 at Valley Forge. The council opened Camp Delmont (later called \\"Delmont Scout Reservation\\" as of the early 1960s) in 1916 in Green Lane, Pennsylvania. Camp Hart and Camp Delmont were adjacent properties. In 1955, some 4,600 acres became available in Marshall's Creek. Site of a hunting facility, it was found admirably suited for Scouting purposes and purchased jointly by the \\"Federation\\" of Philadelphia and Valley Forge Councils to create Resica Falls Scout Reservation. Joint development and use occurred until 1965, when Valley Forge Council bought out Philadelphia Council's interest and the federation was dissolved. When the two councils merged in 1996 to create Cradle of Liberty Council, Scouts from Philadelphia, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties once again camp together. Since February 22, 1913, Valley Forge Council, and its predecessor had hosted an annual Scouting event, the Valley Forge Pilgrimage and Encampment, which is sponsored by the Cradle of Liberty Council. During the 1980s and 1990s, a large percentage of Philadelphia's population moved to the suburbs. Accordingly, the two councils' executive boards began the merger process in 1993, which was finalized in 1996. When councils merge, so do their Order of the Arrow lodges. Philadelphia's OA lodge, Unami One, was founded in 1915 on Treasure Island, and recognized as the first lodge nationally. Valley Forge Council's OA lodge, Delmont Lodge 43, the much larger of the two lodges, was founded in 1929 at Camp Delmont. When the councils merged, Delmont decided to merge with Unami Lodge and retain Unami's name.

Marks Scout Resource Center in Philadelphia =Council offices= The council headquarters is at the Roger S. Firestone Scout Resource Center, in Wayne, Pennsylvania. The Bruce Marks Scout Resource Center in Philadelphia was built in 1929 and served as the council headquarters until 2013. The Beaux Arts style building was designed by architect Charles Klauder. At the time city fathers invited the Scouts to move their offices to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The building was built and paid for by the Scouts, and turned over to the city with the understanding that the Scouts would be allowed to remain in it rent-free \\"in perpetuity.\\" The building is located at 22nd and Winter Streets. The first copy of the R. Tait McKenzie sculpture The Ideal Scout stood outside the building. Headquarters controversy The City of Philadelphia tried to evict the Council from their city-owned service center building on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. The Historic Landmark building laden with Scouting symbols was built and paid for by the Scouts on city land at the city's request in 1929 and the cost of maintenance and renovation has been borne by the Boy Scout council ever since. This resulted in the Cradle of Liberty Council, Inc., Boy Scouts of America, v. City of Philadelphia also known as Cradle of Liberty Council v. City of Philadelphia, [2:08-cv-02429RB] which was a U.S. Court case involving the Cradle of Liberty Council versus the City of Philadelphia. The case was filed on May 23, 2008 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter presided over the case. The Boy Scouts were represented by Drinker Biddle. The case ended with the court ruling in favor of the Boy Scouts of America that the City of Philadelphia illegally attempted to abrogate the Council's federally protected civil rights. Under federal Civil Rights Law, the Cradle of Liberty Council is also entitled to collect its legal costs (estimated at one million dollars) from the city's unlawful action. While the Boy Scouts offered to then settle the dispute by having the City pay half of the legal fees in return for title to the building and the city accepted, the city council reneged. On March 2, 2012, the Federal judge formally ordered the city pay all of the Boy Scouts legal fees and denied the motion for an appeal. The Boy Scouts may also continue reside in the building rent free as they have done since they had paid for construction of the building in 1929. =Camps= Cradle of Liberty Council operates two camps: the Musser Scout Reservation and the Resica Falls Scout Reservation. The former was formed from the merger of Delmont Scout Reservation and Hart Scout Reservation, which are located near Green Lane, Pennsylvania. Hart and Delmont had been operated by the Philadelphia and Valley Forge councils, respectively, before their merger. Their consolidation under the name Musser Scout Reservation was a tribute to Pete Musser and the Musser family, longtime Scouting supporters. Resica Falls is composed of Camp Firestone and Camp Big Springs, north of East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania on the edge of the Poconos, near the controversial Tocks Island Dam project of the 1960s, now the present- day Delaware Water Gap National Recreational Area. Big Springs is still an active summer camp, but the declining attendance and enrollment of Firestone's summer program has caused its closure. Until recently, the council also operated Treasure Island Scout Reservation, sometimes called TI. The camp was damaged by Delaware River flooding in 2005 and again in 2006, forcing its closure for the 2005 and 2006 summer camp seasons. In September 2008, the Council Executive Board ratified the recommendation of the Camping Committee and the executive committee to close Treasure Island effective October 1, 2008. =Other facilities= The council no longer owns any properties in or near Philadelphia. In 1929, Henry W. Breyer, Jr., purchased the abandoned Lindenhurst property once owned by John Wanamaker in Cheltenham on York Road, below Washington Lane. Breyer donated the former Wanamaker land to the Boy Scouts of America for use as a wildlife preserve. The camp was accessible from the city by train to the Jenkintown station. Camp Henry W. Breyer () was sold by the Philadelphia Council in 1990 and is now the site of the Pennsylvania College of Optometry. At one time, the Philadelphia Council was also given a tract near the Roxborough Reservoir at Port Royal Avenue and Eva Street (). and was called the \\"Boy Scout Tract.\\" This land was eventually sold and is now part of the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education. Also, the Philadelphia council also owned Camp Biddle on the Darby Creek (Pennsylvania) in Marple Township. (). The camp was named after Anthony J. Drexel Biddle. The Dale Sea Scout Base was in Eddington, Bensalem Township, Pennsylvania on the Delaware River. The property was purchased from Major Charles Smith, a Philadelphia banker, and was established as Sea Scout Headquarters in 1935. It was named in honor of Commodore Edward C. Dale, who helped organize the area Sea Scouts.

Chavusy serves as an administrative center of Chavusy Raion. As of 2009, its population was 10,692. Jewish history It once was a substantial Jewish shtetl, which dated from the 17th century, as appears from a charter granted to the Jews January 11, 1667, by Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Pac, castellan of Wilno, and confirmed by King Augustus III of Poland. March 9, 1739. In 1780, at the time of a visit of Catherine II, there was a Jewish population of 355, in 1,057; and the town possessed one synagogue. In 1803 the Jewish population was 453, in 1,185; in 1870 it was 2,433, in 4,167; and in 1897, 2,775, in about 6,000. Some of the Jewish artisans were employed in the tanneries and in silk and woolen factories. The Jewish population in the district of Chaussy (including the town) in 1897 was 7,444, or 8.42 per cent of the total population. Chaussy was occupied during World War II by the Germans beginning in July 1941. Though a portion of the Jewish population was able to escape before the Germans arrived, the remaining Jews were registered, marked and subjected to forced labor under the German occupation. The first two round-ups of Jews occurred in August 1941, in which approximately 50 Jews were killed. Overall, approximately 675 Jews were executed in Chaussy. In 1952-53, thanks to funds collected from the relatives of victims, the remains of the victims were reburied at the Jewish cemetery. A total of 127 bags of remains were reburied, and the first memorial was erected in 1958, which was later replaced by a second one.

Biography Ernst Cramer learned the profession of a gardener at a renowned firm in Z√ºrich, where he was instructed by the landscape architect Gustav Ammann, a close friend of Richard Neutra and one of the most important Swiss garden architects at the time. When Cramer started his own business in 1929, he mostly designed private gardens for wealthy clients and perfected a romantic, rather picturesque style. He was especially interested in the rustic gardens that were built in the southern part of Switzerland in the canton of Ticino. Cramer was a member of the Z√ºrich section of the Werkbund, headed by the Bauhaus member Johannes Itten and the Swiss sculptor Max Bill, and became more and more interested in a modern method of garden design. About 1950 Cramer dramatically changed his style and started designing modern architectural gardens. His friendship and cooperation with many modern Swiss artists and his strong interest in modern architecture reinforced his will to find a new language in garden architecture. In particular, the temporary exhibition projects of Cramer are among the most remarkable creations of modern garden architecture in Europe. Most impressive were his contributions to national and international garden exhibitions, for example, the first national garden show in Z√ºrich G59 (1959) and the IGA international garden exhibition in Hamburg (1963). The abstract basic conception of his gardens, the renunciation of superfluous decoration, and the use of concrete and geometrically shaped elements caused considerable irritation among his professional colleagues and added to his international reputation. Cramer's Garten des Poeten (Poet's Garden), built 1959 for the G59 - 1st Swiss Horticulture Exhibition shown in Z√ºrich, was portrayed by Elizabeth B. Kassler in her classic book Modern Gardens and the Landscape, (MOMA 1964). This garden was probably the most important work in Cramer's professional career. At the age of 61 the garden architect had been asked to design a poet's garden for the first national garden show in Switzerland. He worked with minimal means and maximum abstraction instead of imitating nature. Kassler described the design: ‚ÄùTriangular earth mounds and a stepped cone were precisely edged, grass- sheathed, and doubled by a still pool. The garden was not so much a garden as a sculpture to walk through, abstract earth shapes independent of place, with sharp arises foreign to the nature of their material.‚Äù Just a few years later a new radical form of art called Land Art or Earthworks came on the U.S. art scene, creating impressive, almost archaic geometrical earth sculptures, which are among the most important sources of inspiration for present-day landscape architects. Many other remarkable projects by Ernst Cramer built in close cooperation with some of the most important Swiss modern architects and two gardens designed for houses by Richard Neutra do still exist. Among Cramer's clients were some of the most influential Swiss families, as well as companies such as Roche Chemicals and Ciba Chemical Industries. With his remarkable life's work Cramer not only prepared the ground for an intensive discussion about the contemporary influence of minimalist art and Land Art on landscape architecture. With his courageous gardens he also helped shape the profile of modern Swiss landscape architecture and strongly influenced the work of young successors such as Willi Neukom, Fred Eicher, and Dieter Kienast from Switzerland.

Early history Early discussions about Liberty Tree occurred in 1999, in the buildup to the protests against the World Trade Organization in Seattle. Liberty Tree's founders formed a fellowship which proceeded to coordinate three projects: Cities for People! was a national coalition of twenty seven community, youth, labor, religious, political, and other civic organizations dedicated to offering an alternative, democratic agenda for the nation's largest cities. Cities for People! organized mass demonstrations protesting corporate involvement in setting the priorities of the June, 2002, annual national meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Cities for People! also organized a conference on progressive municipal policy as an alternative to the official mayors' meeting. Community Power 2002: First International Conference on Local Democracy. Held over three days in October 2002, this conference drew participants from 25 U.S. states and six countries. Panelists described the lessons of experiments in local democracy conducted in Montevideo, Uruguay, Porto Alegre, Brazil, Manchester, England, San Francisco, California, Arcata, California, rural Pennsylvania, Hartford, Connecticut, and Madison, Wisconsin. In the Summer of 2004, Liberty Tree initiated the No Stolen Elections! campaign and the Nov3.US website (no longer active), a broad-based mobilization to defend voting rights and protest attempts to manipulate the outcome of the 2004 presidential elections. After election day, the No Stolen Elections! campaign coordinated protests in scores of cities across the United States, and lent support to the Cobb/Badnarik recount in Ohio. The campaign succeeded, among other things, in seeding local voting rights groups across the United States. The Liberty Tree Fellows formally incorporated the Liberty Tree Foundation for the Democratic Revolution as a non-stock corporation in the state of Wisconsin in October 2004.

In 2018, it became the scene of a deadly mass shooting carried out by a 19-year-old former student.  History  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was named after the Everglades environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas. The school opened in 1990, the year of her centennial with students in grades 9 through 11, most of whom transferred from nearby schools Coral Springs High School and J. P. Taravella High School. The first senior class graduated in 1992. = Shooting = On February 14, 2018, the school gained national attention when a shooting occurred at the campus, leaving 17 dead and 17 more wounded. The alleged gunman, who was a former student at the school, was apprehended hours later. Authorities have charged the gunman with first-degree murder in response to the shooting, and legal proceedings were ongoing as of January 2019. Students from Stoneman Douglas were instrumental in changing Florida law, on March 4, 2018, to raise the legal rifle-owner age from 18 to 21, with a three-day wait, after they had helped to organize nationwide student protests, following the shooting.  Athletics  The MSD athletics department operates programs in football, volleyball, lacrosse, softball, tennis, track, water polo, basketball, cheerleading, soccer, wrestling, swimming, cross country, and golf. The cheerleading squad at the school received international attention in 2012 when its coach was fired in response to complaints from parents. Parents complained about being charged thousands of dollars for their children to participate in the program, and alleged that the coach mishandled the team's finances and encouraged bullying.  Academics  Newsweek's 2009 national ranking of high schools rated Douglas as No. 208 in the U.S., and No. 38 in Florida, which was the highest ranking of any school in Broward County.

Other sports The then Viscount Petersham also took part in tilting competitions at the Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games in 1881, when he came a joint second in flat tilting. He was invited by the games' founder, William Penny Brookes, to be President of the games for 1882, by which time he had succeeded to his Earldom. In the same games he was the only President to also participate; he competed in the flat tilting, but did not take a ring, and took part in a tent-pegging demonstration. In 1883 he donated a prize to the Society for flat tilting.

Scripps in 1903 James Edmund Scripps (March 19, 1835 ‚Äì May 28, 1906) was an American newspaper publisher and philanthropist. Early life and education Scripps was born in 1835 in London to James Mogg Scripps and Ellen Mary (Saunders) Scripps. His father was a bookbinder who came to America in 1844 with six motherless children. Scripps grew up on a Rushville, Illinois, farm. Career Portrait of James E. Scripps, 1907 Scripps was employed at the Chicago Tribune in 1857 but moved to Detroit in 1859. By 1862 he had become manager of the Detroit Tribune, and he later became part owner and manager of the Detroit Daily Advertiser. When the Advertiser's premises burned in 1873, Scripps took his $20,000 insurance money and with it started his own newspaper. Scripps decided to tap the growing literate class of working men and women by launching a newspaper, The Evening News (later, The Detroit News). Running with an idea new for its time, he filled the paper with inexpensive advertising and instructed his reporters to write \\"like people talk\\". His competitors called the News \\"a cheap rag\\" and labeled his reporters \\"pirates\\", but Detroiters loved it. Scripps later had an interest in E. W. Scripps Company with his younger half-brother, E. W. Scripps and they controlled newspapers located in Cleveland, St. Louis, Cincinnati and Chicago. After a lengthy European acquisition tour, Scripps aided prominently in founding the Detroit Museum of Art (later, the Detroit Institute of Arts), in 1889 presenting it with a collection of old masters costing $75,000 (in 1889 dollars), among the first major accessions of early paintings for any American museum.The only earlier collection, James Jackson Jarves' collection of Italian paintings, was purchased by Yale in 1871. A catalogue of the collection was published in 1889 and has been digitized by the Research Library & Archives of the Detroit Institute of Arts. In 1900, Scripps wrote a letter for the Detroit Century Box time capsule. Family life Scripps's sister and one-time partner Ellen Browning Scripps was instrumental in helping establish their younger brother E. W. Scripps in the newspaper industry, resulting in the E.W. Scripps Company media conglomerate. She later became the founding donor of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography located in La Jolla, California and was the founder of Scripps College, located in Claremont. Scripps's eldest daughter, Ellen Warren Scripps (1863‚Äì1948), married George Gough Booth, who subsequently became the publisher of the Evening News Association and independently founded Michigan's Booth Newspapers chain (acquired by S.I. Newhouse's Advance Publications in 1976). Together, George and \\"Nellie\\" also founded the world-renowned Cranbrook Educational Community in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

TANs are a second layer of security above and beyond the traditional single-password authentication. TANs provide additional security because they act as a form of two-factor authentication (2FA). If the physical document or token containing the TANs is stolen, it will be useless without the password. Conversely, if the login data are obtained, no transactions can be performed without a valid TAN. Classic TAN An outline of how TANs function: # The bank creates a set of unique TANs for the user. Typically, there are 50 TANs printed on a list, enough to last half a year for a normal user; each TAN being six or eight characters long. # The user picks up the list from the nearest bank branch (presenting a passport, an ID card or similar document) or is sent the TAN list through mail. # The password (PIN) is mailed separately. # To log on to his/her account, the user must enter user name (often the account number) and password (PIN). This may give access to account information but the ability to process transactions is disabled. # To perform a transaction, the user enters the request and authorizes the transaction by entering an unused TAN. The bank verifies the TAN submitted against the list of TANs they issued to the user. If it is a match, the transaction is processed. If it is not a match, the transaction is rejected. # The TAN has now been used and will not be recognized for any further transactions. # If the TAN list is compromised, the user may cancel it by notifying the bank. However, as any TAN can be used for any transaction, TANs are still prone to phishing attacks where the victim is tricked into providing both password/PIN and one or several TANs. Further, they provide no protection against man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker intercepts the transmission of the TAN and uses it for a forged transaction. Especially when the client system becomes compromised by some form of malware that enables a malicious user, the possibility of an unauthorized transaction is high. Although the remaining TANs are uncompromised and can be used safely, the user should take an appropriate action as soon as possible.  Indexed TAN (iTAN)  Indexed TANs reduce the risk of phishing. To authorize a transaction, the user is not asked to use an arbitrary TAN from the list but to enter a specific TAN as identified by a sequence number (index). As the index is randomly chosen by the bank, an arbitrary TAN acquired by an attacker is usually worthless. However, iTANs are still susceptible to man-in-the- middle attacks, including phishing attacks where the attacker tricks the user into logging into a forged copy of the bank's website and man-in-the-browser attacksCandid W√ºest, Symantec Global Security Response Team Current Advances in Banking Trojans? iriss.ie, Irish Reporting and Information Security Service, December 2, 2012 (PDF; 1,9 MB) which allow the attacker to secretly swap the transaction details in the background of the PC as well as to conceal the actual transactions carried out by the attacker in the online account overview.Katusha: LKA zerschl√§gt Ring von Online-Betr√ºgern WinFuture.de, October 29, 2010 Therefore, in 2012 the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security advised all banks to consider the PC systems of their users being infected by malware by default and use security processes where the user can cross-check the transaction data against manipulations like for example (provided the security of the mobile phone holds up) mTAN or smartcard readers with their own screen including the transaction data into the TAN generation process while displaying it beforehand to the user (chipTAN).‚ÄúHigh Roller‚Äù online bank robberies reveal security gaps European Union Agency for Network and Information Security, July 5, 2012  Indexed TAN with CAPTCHA (iTANplus)  Prior to entering the iTAN, the user is presented a CAPTCHA, which in the background also shows the transaction data and data deemed unknown to a potential attacker, such as the user's birthdate. This is intended to make it hard (but not impossible) for an attacker to forge the CAPTCHA. This variant of the iTAN is method used by some German banks adds a CAPTCHA to reduce the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Some Chinese banks have also deployed a TAN method similar to iTANplus. A recent study shows that these CAPTCHA-based TAN schemes are not secure against more advanced automated attacks.  Mobile TAN (mTAN)  mTANs are used by banks in Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and some in New Zealand, Australia and Ukraine. When the user initiates a transaction, a TAN is generated by the bank and sent to the user's mobile phone by SMS. The SMS may also include transaction data, allowing the user to verify that the transaction has not been modified in transmission to the bank. However, the security of this scheme depends on the security of the mobile phone system. In South Africa, where SMS-delivered TAN codes are common, a new attack has appeared: SIM Swap Fraud. A common attack vector is for the attacker to impersonate the victim, and obtain a replacement SIM card for the victim's phone from the mobile network operator. The victim's user name and password are obtained by other means (such as keylogging or phishing). In-between obtaining the cloned/replacement SIM and the victim noticing their phone no longer works, the attacker can transfer/extract the victim's funds from their accounts.Victim's SIM swop fraud nightmare iol.co.za, Independent Online, January 12, 2008 In 2016 a study was conducted on SIM Swap Fraud by a social engineer, revealing weaknesses in issuing porting numbers. In 2014, a weakness in the Signalling System No. 7 used for SMS transmission was published, which allows interception of messages. It was demonstrated by Tobias Engel during the 31st Chaos Communication Congress. At the beginning of 2017, this weakness was used successfully in Germany to intercept SMS and fraudulently redirect fund transfers . Also the rise of smartphones led to malware attacks trying to simultaneously infect the PC and the mobile phone as well to break the mTAN scheme.Eurograbber SMS Trojan steals ‚Ç¨36 million from online banks techworld.com, December 5, 2012  pushTAN  pushTAN is an app-based TAN scheme by German Sparkassen banking group reducing some of the shortcomings of the mTAN scheme. It eliminates the cost of SMS messages and is not susceptible to SIM card fraud, since the messages are sent via a special text-messaging application to the user's smartphone using an encrypted Internet connection. Just like mTAN, the scheme allows the user to cross-check the transaction details against hidden manipulations carried out by Trojans on the user's PC by including the actual transaction details the bank received in the pushTAN message. Although analogous to using mTAN with a smartphone, there is the risk of a parallel malware infection of PC and smartphone. To reduce this risk the pushTAN app ceases to function if the mobile device is rooted or jailbroken.Online-Banking mit pushTAN - FAQ berliner-sparkasse.de, Berliner Sparkasse (A√∂R), Retrieved on August 27, 2014. In late 2014 the Deutsche Kreditbank (DKB) also adopted the pushTAN scheme.Informationen zu pushTAN dkb.de, Deutsche Kreditbank AG, Retrieved on March 12, 2015.  TAN generators  = Simple TAN generators = The risk of compromising the whole TAN list can be reduced by using security tokens that generate TANs on-the-fly, based on a secret known by the bank and stored in the token or a smartcard inserted into the token. However, the TAN generated is not tied to the details of a specific transaction. Because the TAN is valid for any transaction submitted with it, it does not protect against phishing attacks where the TAN is directly used by the attacker, or against man-in-the-middle attacks. = ChipTAN / Sm@rt-TAN / CardTAN = ChipTAN generator (optical version) with bank card attached. The two white arrows mark the borders of the barcode on the computer screen. ChipTAN is a TAN scheme used by many German and Austrian banks.Postbank chipTAN comfort official page of Postbank, Retrieved on April 10, 2014.chipTAN: Listen werden √ºberfl√ºssig official page of Sparkasse, Retrieved on April 10, 2014.Die cardTAN official page of Raiffeisen Bankengruppe √ñsterreich, Retrieved on April 10, 2014. It is known as ChipTAN or Sm@rt-TAN in Germany and as CardTAN in Austria, whereas cardTAN is a technically independent standard.Die neue cardTAN ebankingsicherheit.at, Gemalto N.V., Retrieved on October 22, 2014. A ChipTAN generator is not tied to a particular account; instead, the user must insert their bank card during use. The TAN generated is specific to the bank card as well as to the current transaction details. There are two variants: In the older variant, the transaction details (at least amount and account number) must be entered manually. In the modern variant, the user enters the transaction online, then the TAN generator reads the transaction details via a flickering barcode on the computer screen (using photodetectors). It then shows the transaction details on its own screen to the user for confirmation before generating the TAN. As it is independent hardware, coupled only by a simple communication channel, the TAN generator is not susceptible to attack from the user's computer. Even if the computer is subverted by a Trojan, or if a man-in-the- middle attack occurs, the TAN generated is only valid for the transaction confirmed by the user on the screen of the TAN generator, therefore modifying a transaction retroactively would cause the TAN to be invalid. An additional advantage of this scheme is that because the TAN generator is generic, requiring a card to be inserted, it can be used with multiple accounts across different banks, and losing the generator is not a security risk because the security-critical data is stored on the bank card. While it offers protection from technical manipulation, the ChipTAN scheme is still vulnerable to social engineering. Attackers have tried to persuade the users themselves to authorize a transfer under a pretext, for example by claiming that the bank required a \\"test transfer\\" or that a company had falsely transferred money to the user's account and they should \\"send it back\\".Tatanga Attack Exposes chipTAN Weaknesses trusteer.com, September 4, 2012 Users should therefore never confirm bank transfers they have not initiated themselves. ChipTAN is also used to secure batch transfers (Sammel√ºberweisungen). However, this method offers significantly less security than the one for individual transfers. In case of a batch transfer the TAN generator will only show the number and total amount of all transfers combined ‚Äì thus for batch transfers there is little protection from manipulation by a Trojan. This vulnerability was reported by RedTeam Pentesting in November 2009. In response, as a mitigation, some banks changed their batch transfer handling so that batch transfers containing only a single record are treated as individual transfers.

AMSA is a student-governed, national organization. They have a membership of 68,000 medical students, premedical students, interns, medical residents and practicing physicians from across the country. AMSA's action committees and interest groups help expose medical students to information on subjects not generally covered in traditional curricula, and is the only major national medical organization in the US that accepts no sponsorship or funding from any pharmaceutical company. Strategic priorities In November 2007, AMSA leaders decided upon four strategic priorities: * Quality, Affordable Health Care for All through advocacy for health care reform and a single-payer universal health care system * Global Health Equity through education about our responsibility for rational and proportional assistance for all people * Enriching Medicine Through Diversity by improving recruitment and retention into medicine of under-reperesented minorities, while increasing the diversity of its own leadership * Professional Integrity, Development and Student Well-Being that creates a humane and cooperative learning environment, one that will develop physicians worthy of the public trust, through work hour reform, revitalization of professionalism in the medical field, and through AMSA's PharmFree campaign History The American Medical Student Association (AMSA) was founded in 1950, as the Student American Medical Association (SAMA), under the auspices of the American Medical Association (AMA). The main purpose of the organization was to provide medical students a chance to participate in organized medicine. The late 1960s saw dramatic changes in the organization's objectives and philosophy. In 1967, AMSA established its independence from the AMA, became student-governed, and began to raise its own voice on a variety of socio-medical issues, including civil rights, abortion rights, universal health care and Vietnam. In a collaboration with medical educators that began in 1968, AMSA proposed numerous reforms and model curricula, to transform medical education in order to make the profession more responsive to community and societal needs. AMSA was also instrumental in the introduction of the original Family Practice Act of 1970, and supported legislation establishing the National Health Service Corps. AMSA has led a campaign to reform medical resident work hours, long a controversial issue in the field. In 2001 AMSA joined the Committee of Interns & Residents and Public Citizen in filing a petition with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration asking for federal oversight of resident work hours as a matter of workplace safety. AMSA authored the Patient and Physician Safety and Protection Act of 2005, introduced by Senator Jon Corzine (S. 1297) and Representative John Conyers (H.R.1228). AMSA and the Committee of Interns & Residents also jointly maintain a website advocating for work hours reform called Hours Watch that presents the latest scientific research on the topic. In addition to sponsoring events highlighting prospects for universal health care, medical technology and HIV/AIDS, AMSA also has organized the PharmFree Campaign to educate and train its members to interact professionally and ethically with the pharmaceutical industry. In September, 2005, AMSA led the National Conference on the Financing of Undergraduate Medical Education, an event that brought together legislators, medical organizations, medical students and others to address skyrocketing medical debt. Annual convention right Each spring, AMSA's Annual Convention brings together nearly 1,500 physicians-in- training and leaders in medical education and health policy. The location of the convention alternates from year to year between the DC metro area and other locations. At the Convention, are renowned Keynote Speakers and many healthcare related exhibitors. Also, at convention the House Of Delegates (HOD) meets. The HOD is where AMSA's members take ownership of the Association. As AMSA's official policy-making body, the HOD is a delegation of AMSA members from each local medical chapter who meet once a year at the Annual Convention to vote on AMSA's policies and to elect our national officers. The HOD is open to all members of AMSA to speak and vote. The members debate the issues, make the amendments and cast the votes that shape AMSA's policies. Any member of AMSA has the ability to write and submit resolutions to the HOD. Action committees AMSA has nine Action Committees (AC's). While the Board of Trustees governs the organization, the Action Committees produce ideas and projects. They promote these areas of interest and associated projects to AMSA members on national, regional and local levels and are integral in helping AMSA maintain its view of medicine. * Community and Public Health Committee * Health Policy Committee * Medical Education Committee * Professionalism and Ethics Committee * Professional Development Committee * Wellness and Student Life Committee * Gender and Sexuality Committee * Global Health Committee(COM) * Race, Ethnicity and Culture in Health Committee IFMSA partnership In 2008, IFMSA-USA merged with AMSA. IFMSA-USA used to be the US representative to the International Federation of Medical Students' Associations (IFMSA). Since the merger, AMSA now is able to offer international exchanges for research and clinical electives to nearly 70 countries through SCORE and SCOPE respectively. The exchanges are available to medical student members. Research exchanges are also available to select pre- med members. AMSA also now sends a delegation of students to the semi-annual IFMSA General Assemblies (GA) of IFMSA. Programs =PharmFree= left The PharmFree project, established by the AMSA in 2002, was created from the belief that the medical profession needs more detachment from pharmaceutical firms. Spending on marketing to physicians, which includes gifts to med students, rose from $12.1 billion in 1999 to $22 billion in 2003. Based on the premise that taking gifts from pharmaceutical companies creates a conflict of interest for doctors, AMSA now urges both students and practising physicians to 'just say no' to all personal gifts from Pharmaceutical companies. The PharmFree campaign has included a march on Pfizer offices in New York City, where members assembled at the firm's front doors and dumped thousands of pens marked with the company's logo on the doorstep. Additionally, under the leadership of then-President Leana Wen, AMSA started the Counterdetailing Campaign in 2005 to encourage physicians-in-training to educate practicing physicians about alternative sources of information regarding pharmaceuticals. As \\"detailing\\" is the concept of drug representatives selling biased information to physicians, AMSA came up with the concept of \\"counterdetailing\\" as an opposing concept, for students to bring physicians evidence-based sources of information. In May 2007, AMSA released the PharmFree Scorecard, the first to evaluate medical schools according to their pharmaceutical interaction policies. Of all the medical schools in the United States, five received a grade of ‚ÄúA,‚Äù which translates into comprehensive school policy that restricts pharmaceutical representatives to both the medical school campus and its academic medical centers. Forty schools received an ‚ÄúF‚Äù for their lack of policies or encouraging physicians-in-training to obtain information from drug representatives. Allies and supporters of this campaign include No Free Lunch, AARP, Consumers Union, the Medical Letter, and the National Physicians Alliance. =AMSA Academy= right AMSA Academy is a training ground for physician leaders, established by and for students. The Academy strives to empower medical students to effect change in medicine. Combining didactic with experiential learning, AMSA Academy courses take medical students through the core competencies of leadership and project implementation, while building on key principles of important topics in medicine. Each program fosters the value of health care must be patient- centered, effective, efficient, safe, equitable, and timely, as identified by the Institute of Medicine. AMSA identifies their mission as training physician leaders in order to transform the face of medicine. =AMSA Foundation= The Foundation was established by AMSA in 1964 as a means to address issues in medical education and to provide low cost small emergency loans to medical students in need. In 1974, the Board of Trustees of the Association and the Board of Directors of the Foundation decided to broaden its role. Since then, the Foundation has functioned as the programming arm of AMSA. During its history, the AMSA Foundation has developed a national reputation for designing and conducting quality and innovative programming. It has managed over $75,000,000 of grant and contract funds during this period. Much of the organization's early work was performed under contract with the U.S. Public Health Service. From 1971 through 1980, the AMSA Foundation was the primary recruiter of physicians for the National Health Service Corps, Bureau of Medical Services and the Indian Health Service. The AMSA Foundation has also worked extensively with private foundations and corporations on programs designed to augment physician development and innovations in medical education. The organization was one of the original innovators of interdisciplinary health team training for medical and health professions students-an initiative that has continued to this day. AMSA has also launched programs in primary care, complementary and alternative medicine, international health, health policy, HIV/AIDS education, substance abuse prevention, breast cancer prevention, health services management and end of life care for medical and other health professions students. Leadership AMSA has always been led by students. The National President is elected by members to serve a one-year term during which he/she is based in AMSA's Reston offices. The President takes a year's leave from medical school in order to serve AMSA and its mission. AMSA also has staff that work in its Sterling offices, including an executive director. In 2006, AMSA's long-time executive director, Paul R. Wright, retired. Past AMSA presidents have gone on to many leadership positions in the government and in academia. Logo shield featuring the Rod of Asclepius and \\"AMSA\\" in text reminiscent of the older logo The older AMSA logo, no longer used, in effect from 1950-2009 To celebrate AMSA's 60th anniversary, a new logo was designed to commemorate the occasion. Importantly, the Rod of Asclepius has been incorporated into a shield, beside which \\"AMSA\\" is spelled out (using a custom font which differs from the original logo). The letters AMSA rest upon the fully spelled out name of the organization, using the font \\"Today.\\" The crest contains four colours; from top right clockwise, they are and represent: *Blue - (although it is not explicitly explained why the blue is in the shield, the colour blue in general represents AMSA's history and tradition, since its logo has always been blue) *Purple - Purple illustrates the advocacy efforts on behalf of LGBT medical students and those discriminated against based on gender and sexuality *Red - Red was incorporated into the new logo to reflect the organization‚Äôs dedication to fighting the global AIDS pandemic *Green - Green exemplifies AMSA‚Äôs commitment to a better environment and environmental health and the organization‚Äôs commitment to reducing its carbon footprint There is also a blazon as to the usage of the logo, including size, dimensions and colours.
