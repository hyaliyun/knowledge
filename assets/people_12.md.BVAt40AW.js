He probably belonged to the class of small lords who were tied to the Kastrioti family and possibly belonged to a common lineage (fis) with them. In his youth, he fought as a mercenary in the armies of Alfonso the Magnanimous. The term conte (\\"count\\") with which he became known in historical accounts didn't refer to an actual title he held, but to his status as a figure of importance. After his return to Albania, Vrana connected himself with Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg and participated in all of his major battles until his death in 1458. He is particularly praised for his resistance as the commander of the defense of Kruj√´ during its first siege. He was offered a great deal of money and a high-ranking post in the Ottoman administration by Sultan Murad II in order to surrender the castle but he firmly held the defense with a maximum number of 4,000 troops against tens of thousands of Ottoman soldiers. His son Bernardo left Albania when the Ottomans conquered the country and settled in the Kingdom of Naples and became duke of Ferrandina in 1505. His descendants, known as the Granai-Castriota held large estates in southern Italy and were distinguished in the internal and external affairs of the kingdom. Life Bust in the museum of Kruj√´ As a result of the scarcity of primary sources, Brana's date of birth and his family have been a subject of debate. In early sources, he is usually referred to as Vrana and Vranaconte or Branaconte which correspond to the original patronymic surname of his descendants Branai in archival material. The literary form Uran is also observed in bibliography. There is no attested form of his surname. Vrana was probably one of those regional, small lords who were tied to the Kastrioti family - possibly via a common ancestral lineage - and were trusted by Kastrioti leaders. This belonging to a common fis may have influenced the decision of his descendants to adopt the surname Castriota in addition to Granai. In the folkore of the Albanians of Upper Reka, Vrana was from their region. In their stories, he is described as 2m (6'5ft) in height and a great warrior. In his youth he fought in the armies of Alfonso the Magnanimous as a mercenary. The status of conte (\\"count\\") which is used to refer to him in contemporary historical accounts doesn't refer to an actual title with which he was bestowed but referred to his status as a man of importance.  Military activity  Vrana had returned to Albania in the years prior to the beginning of the Albanian-Turkish wars under the leadership of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg in 1443. Vrana was one the figures which were his closest and most trusted allies. He may be the Urana who is mentioned in a document of Ottoman Kruj√´ in relation to events as a result of which Skanderbeg was given direct control of the village of Mamurras. In the Albanian-Turkish wars, Kruj√´ was the center of the Albanian war effort. The Ottomans besieged Kruj√´ four times between 1450 and 1478, when it fell ten years after Skanderbeg's death. In May 1450, two years after the Ottomans had captured Svetigrad, they organized a mass campaign and laid siege to Kruj√´ with an army numbering approximately 100,000 men and led again by Sultan Murad II himself and his son, Mehmed. Christian volunteers from all over Europe had arrived in Kruj√´ to assist the defense against the upcoming Ottoman siege - Slavs, Italians, Germans and others. Skanderbeg left a protective garrison of 1,500 to 4,000 under Vrana in the town, while he harassed the Ottoman camps around Kruj√´ by continuously attacking Sultan Murad II's supply caravans from Mount Tumenishta. Vrana had under his command several Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen, to whom he emphasized the importance of the siege and also ordered them to their positions. Kruj√´ had enough supplies for a sixteen-month siege. The women and children of Kruj√´ were sent for protection to Venetian possessed areas, whereas the others were ordered to burn their crops and move into the mountains and fortresses. Vrana addressed the army with encouraging speeches in order to raise morale, in Albanian and Italian, and through interpreters. The garrison repelled three major direct assaults on the city walls by the Ottomans, causing great losses to the besieging forces and forced the Ottomans to retreat. Ottoman attempts at finding and cutting the water sources failed, as did a sapped tunnel, which collapsed suddenly. An offer of 300,000 aspra (Turkish silver coins) and a promise of a high rank as an officer in the Ottoman army made to Vrana Konti, were both rejected by him. Vrana's stance in the siege of Kruj√´ is remembered in many folk songs and their variants in the region that Skanderbeg held. Vrana was one of the commanders in the Siege of Berat in 1455. The purpose of the siege was to recover the city of Berat for the Muzaka family and establish a firm stronghold for the League of Lezh√´ in southern Albania. Skanderbeg's army had 15,000 men including a 1,000 man strong Neapolitan contingent of siege warfare engineers which Alfonso had sent to deal with the fortification of the Berat Castle. The siege was at first successful and the fortifications were breached. An armistice was signed and the Albanian army expected that the Ottomans would surrender. Skanderbeg moved with a contingent to another area. In mid July, however, the Ottomans sent an army of 20,000 troops led by Evrenosoglu Isa Bey, which surprised Skanderbeg's army. Only one commander, Vrana, managed to resist the initial Ottoman onslaught and pushed back several attacking waves. When Skanderbeg returned, the Ottoman relief force was repulsed and defeated. But the Albanians were exhausted and their numbers had dwindled to the point where the siege could not be continued. More than 5,000 of Skanderbeg's men died, including 800 men of the 1,000 Neapolitans. The commander of the siege, Muzaka Thopia, was also killed during the conflict. Vrana died in 1458. He died in the same year as Alfonso the Magnanimous and Pope Callixtus III who died on June 27 and on August 6, 1458 respectively. His death was a major blow to Skanderbeg who in a short period lost his most trusted commander Vrana and his most important political allies. In the folkore of the Albanians of Upper Reka, Vrana is buried in that region with possible locations given near the village of Rimnica. In one of the variants of the story, when he returned to the village he was sick and disappointed by the possible outcome of the war. He climbed Skerteci, a mountain near Tanusha and gathered two large stone slabs which he told the villagers to use to make his tombstone.  Historiography and literature  Historical accounts about Vrana's life and deeds are scarce beyond some references about him in official correspondence of the time and works which focus mainly on his role in the Albanian-Turkish Wars. Marin Barleti, who was a contemporary of Vrana, is one of the first authors who mention Vrana in his History of Scanderbeg in 1510. Paolo Giovio and Paolo Angelo examined Vrana's role in Gjergj Kastrioti's wars in their works in the first half of the 16th century. Giammaria Biemmi in his 1742 Istoria di Giorgio Castrioto some more details about his background - like a parental lineage to an Altisferi family which he links to the Zaharia family. His work, which Biemmi claimed to be based on an unknown manuscript is considered a forgery in modern scholarship like many of his other works. In oral literature - epic poetry and tales - he is well-remembered for his involvement in the Skanderbeg's battles. Much of the corpus of these oral tales focus on the siege of Kruj√´. Geographically, in Albania these tales are found in an area from Kruj√´ to the Kuk√´s region in the north and the Upper Reka to the west. In written literature, Vrana inspired the character Vran in the epic poem Scanderbeide by Margherita Sarrocchi. The definitive edition of Scanderbeide was published in 1623. Among the Arb√´reshe, the community of Albanian refugees that settled in Italy after Ottoman conquest, Vrana has been a particularly popular subject. In the 19th century, Gavril Dara the Younger in K√´nga e Sprasme e Bal√´s portrays Vrana with much affection as a high lord (zot i math). In 1967, a year dedicated to the memory of Scanderbeg in literature and visual arts in the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, a bust of Vrana was created by local sculptor from Kruj√´, Sabri Tu√ßi. In the same year, he was the subject of the painting Vrana Konti n√´ k√´shtjell√´n e Kruj√´s (Vrana Konti in the fortress of Kruj√´) by Skender Kamberi. Descendants Palazzo Castriota in Parabita was built by Alfonso, grandson of Vrana His son, Bernardo took the surname Branai in Italy. His original name may also have been Vrana/Brana, which was italianized as Bernardo after his arrival in Italy. Gjon Muzaka wrote at the same time the Breve memoria de li discendenti de nostra casa Musachi, in which details emerge about Bernardo's family links to Albanian noble families through his marriage to Maria Zardari, daughter of Paul Zardari and a member of the Muzaka family. Muzaka's account and specifically its land claims are considered unreliable, but the link to Maria Zardari is confirmed in other works. Bernardo's son married a relative of Skanderbeg's wife, Donika Arianiti and their son Alfonso adopted the surname Castriota to honor that connection with the Kastrioti family with which their ancestor Vrana probably belonged to a common fis. The surname Branai was altered to Granai, so the family became known as Castriota-Granai. Vrana may also have had another son who is recorded as a scribe Zaganos in Ottoman Kruj√´. The Granai-Castriota held large estates in the Kingdom of Naples and distinguished themselves in the internal and external affairs of the kingdom. They were part of the military feudal class and were loyalists of the Aragonese and the Spanish crown. Bernardo Branai became duke of Ferrandina for his services to Ferdinand the Catholic in 1505. His son Alfonso further gained Mignano Monte Lungo and became governor of Terra d'Otranto and was a representative of the feudal nobility in the Imperial Cortes. To the family's assets were added the county of Copertino and the marquisate of Atripalda and other feudal grants. In this period, they began to add to their titles that of signori di Corinto and produced a copy of a document which purportedly proved that Manuel Palaiologos had granted to one of their ancestors Corinth as part of his \\"Albanian castles\\" in 1399. The document was a fabrication, typical of the land claims of the era. The Granai wanted the fortress of Corinth because it was an important regional fortress and had been settled by Albanians in the Middle Ages. Antonio Granai in the 16th century consolidated and concentrated the family's holdings. He is the ancestor of all members (via patrilineal descent) of the Granai family today. In the chronicles of their era, the Granai of the Kingdom of Naples are remembered for their valor in the battlegrounds as condotierri. They were also patrons of art in southern Italy. Jacopo Sannazaro was very critical of the family, while Antonio de Ferraris dedicated two epistles to them. The Granai kept their connections with Albania well into the 16th century. Alfonso Granai had an active spy network in Albania and maintained a force of local stradiots and his brother Giovanni (1468-1514), Duke of Ferrandina was known to have spoken Albanian. In 1551, a relative of the family in Albania, Dimitro Massi was part of an assembly in the cape of Rodon for the organization of anti-Ottoman revolt in the country.

Crotalaria cunninghamii, also known as green birdflower or regal birdflower, is a plant of the legume family Fabaceae, named after early 19th century botanist Allan Cunningham. It is native to, and widespread, in inland northern Australia. It is a coloniser of unstable sand dunes, along beaches and in Mulga communities. It is pollinated by large bees and by honeyeaters . Description Green birdflower is a perennial shrub that grows to about 1‚Äì3 m in height. It has hairy or woolly branches and dull green foliage. The oval leaves are about 30 mm long, the large and greenish pea flowers are streaked with fine black lines, and the club-shaped seed pods are up to 50 mm long. The plant's flowers grow on long spikes at the ends of its branches. The flower greatly resembles a bird attached by its beak to the central stalk of the flowerhead. Uses and cultivation The sap from the leaves was used by Aboriginal people to treat eye infections. Green birdflower can be grown in warm areas. It needs well-drained soils and a position in full sun. It is not suited to cold climates or where there are frosts. Propagation is from seed, which readily germinates after boiling water treatment, or from cuttings. This plant has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen fixing bacteria, which helps improve nitrogen levels in the soil. This nitrogen is used by the Green birdflower and other plants in the vicinity.

The market was a success from the start and was held as a trial each week until approvals from the City and State were finalised. The initial market, consisting of about 12 stalls, was located at the Silos end of Salamanca Place and held 7 months after the council's resolution on 22 January 1972. Salamanca Market operated just in the summer for the first few years of its life. It started 4 weeks before Christmas and ran until Easter. It proved to be so popular and successful that the Tasmanian Puppet Theatre, in 1975, established a Winter Market. In 1977 they were joined and aided in their market's operation by the Salamanca Arts Centre. Salamanca Market had grown quite considerably by 1977, with many stallholders attending regularly and so an informal Stallholders' Association, chaired by Philip Broughton, was established. He negotiated the concept of 'Permanent Stallholders' with the Council. This resulted in regular stallholders being identified, assigned fixed sites and paying rent in advance. 1980s By this time the Market had grown to about 150 stalls and now encompassed most of the lower part of Salamanca Place stretching from its origins near the Silos up to Montpellier Retreat. The Salamanca Stallholders Association was officially established on 19 February 1987. Later that year the Council took over the running of the Winter Market from the Arts Centre. Over the next year or so the Summer Market's opening hours were changed from 9am-1pm to 9am-2pm. 1990s In April 1992 the Southern Star reported that Salamanca Market was attended by between 10,000 and 12,000 people every week. Later in the year the Market was extended up to Gladstone St in order to increase the number of sites available to Casual Stallholders. During 1993 the operating hours of the Market were increased from 9 am-2pm to 9am-3pm. The council gave away 10 stalls to individuals free of charge, while at the same time it annexed at least one stall from a permanent stall holder without compensation.Mercury Saturday 20 May 2005 (Public Notices) In 1995, more stalls were created in the car park area by the side of the Market near Montpellier Retreat and the sites were allocated to members of the Hmong Community. The following year, the Market was extended from Gladstone St to Davey St. In 1998/9 a detailed feasibility study on the issue of a Sunday Market in Salamanca Place was undertaken and 3 Sunday Markets were trialed. They were not very successful and ongoing Sunday Markets in Salamanca Place were opposed by both the Stallholders Association and the Sullivans Cove Merchant's Association. Since 2000 A series of Sunday Markets were run in Mawson Place during January and February 2001. In September 2009 the Hobart City Council created a subsidiary that would manage the Salamanca Market as its sole shareholder. As the structure was being developed, the council sought input from stallholders who were pushing for a review of the licensing agreement. Salamanca Market grew from 12 stalls in 1972 to 300 in 2010, becoming Tasmania's most visited tourist venue attracting up to 25,000-40,000 visitors every Saturday.

Her father was of Norwegian and Swedish heritage. In 1920 her family moved to Mountain View, California. Shooting of Harold Galloway Granstedt first gained notoriety and widespread media attention in April 1922 after she shot her 17-year-old boyfriend, Harold Galloway, with a pistol she borrowed from a friend. Granstedt, then only 14 years old, claimed in interviews that the shooting was accidental, a claim that coincided with Galloway's own story of the incident.

Among other ways of making a living, she modeled at San Francisco Art Association in the summer of 1926. In 1927 she and a companion travelled from San Francisco to Los Angeles. There is some confusion about who the companion was, or the way the pair got to Hollywood. She and Bessie Hyde reportedly took a steamer from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Bessie met Glen Hyde on that trip, falling in love and sealing her fate as a lost river runner. Greta, it is said, disembarked from the trip with the desire to become a movie star and the choice of a new name. She boarded as Eraine, a name she'd adopted in San Francisco, and departed as Greta. She boarded as a Kansas born Californian, disembarked as a Swedish born starlet in waiting.Dimock, Brad. Sunk Without a Sound. Flagstaff: Fretwater Press Another source maintains that Greta, barely surviving the hardships of living on her own in San Francisco, hitch-hiked from northern to southern California in the company of Geraldine Andrews By 1929 Greta had reconciled with her parents. They embarked from San Francisco aboard the aging passenger steamer, the San Juan. On September 2 the San Juan collided with oil tanker S. C. T. Dodd off Pigeon Point, California, near the location of the Pigeon Point lighthouse. Her father survived, but her mother was among the 77 drowned in the incident. The tragedy played out for several months in Los Angeles, with the crew being found negligent. Career By the mid-1920s, Greta had appeared opposite Joseph Schildkraut in a Los Angeles production of From Hell Came a Lady.1920 Federal Census, Fruitvale, Sunnyvale Township, Santa Clara, California One of her early film appearances was in a small role in Buck Privates (1928), with Hungarian film actress Lya de Putti, and made her sound debut in The Last Performance (1929). She continued to play mainly bit parts some of which were memorable. She appeared as Beulah Bondi's daughter in the crime drama Street Scene (1931) and as Margo's friend in Crime Without Passion (1934).Hollywood Friends website While in New York City, Greta appeared in three Broadway plays, the short-lived Tomorrow's Harvest (four performances, opened December 4, 1934 at the 49th St. Theatre), and the longer-running If a Body (45 performances, opening April 30, 1935 at the Biltmore Theatre). In the 1936-37 season, she was in the drama Thirsty Soil at the 48th St. Theatre (opening February 3, 1937, 13 performances).Greta Granstedt Internet Broadway Data Base She returned to Hollywood for perhaps her best-remembered role, that of Anna Wahl, playing opposite Alan Ladd as the only female in an underground resistance cell in Hitler, Beast of Berlin (1939). She plays the flirtatious wife looking to stray in her brief appearance in Telephone Operator (1937). She appeared in the comedy There Goes My Heart as Thulda, the Swedish maid who comes to New York to visit her uncle Bj√∂rn Bj√∂rnsson. Her 1940s roles were minor. She appeared as Mrs. Lars Faraassen in Our Vines Have Tender Grapes (1945), appearing in the Christmas party and barn-burning scenes. In 1958, she played a California housewife welcoming Francis Lederer's Count Dracula into her suburban home in The Return of Dracula. During the 1960s, she appeared in television shows, including Perry Mason, Peter Gunn, The Millionaire, Lassie and Dragnet. She retired in 1970.Greta Granstedt IMDb profile Personal life Granstedt was married eight times, four of which were annulled. Her first marriage, in 1923, to Robert Blieber, was annulled because Greta was a minor. Her second marriage, to Robert Lowenthal, a California artist, in 1926, was also annulled. Her third marriage, to Ramon Ramos, in 1933, was celebrated by the one year, one term Mayor of New York, John P. O'Brien. The marriage lasted only eighteen months. Ramos was a Latin band leader, and tango dancer. Granstedt joined him at the Miami Biltmore in the fall of 1933 Miami News, November 17, 1933 In 1935 Granstedt married French World War I veteran, designer and photographer Marcel Olis, in Greenwich, Connecticut. It is unclear how long this marriage lasted, but it also ended in divorce. Her fifth husband was Max de Vega, a matte painter Matte Shot - a tribute Matte painting is a motion picture special effects technique involving the painting of movie backgrounds on glass. Married in Mexico, she was considering divorce when she discovered that de Vega was still married to a previous wife, and thus she sought annulment rather than divorce. It was with de Vega that Granstedt had a house designed for her by the California Architect Harwell Harris.Southern California Architectural History The Hollywood home is still extant, and Greta lived in the house through the 1950s. In 1944 Granstedt wed for a sixth time, this time to Major Lawrence Wright. The marriage was annulled, when Wright, like de Vega proved to still be married to another woman. In 1947 she married for a seventh time. Because four of the previous marriages had been annulled, newspaper reports of the time described this as \\"her second wedding, his first.\\" She and husband Arthur G. Forbes (1947‚Äì1951) adopted a son from Tennessee in 1948. In the 1951 Greta was awarded custody of the child she and Forbes had adopted three years earlier. They named the child Christopher Michael.Los Angeles Times, October 5, 1951 Her final marriage, in 1965, was to Howard Thomas. By this time Greta had been treated for throat cancer and recovered. She and Thomas purchased ranch land in British Columbia.

Though an English-language game, it was developed by Motion-Twin, a French online game provider. My Brute originated as a free browser-based Flash game. It was later ported to the iPhone and iPod Touch, with enhanced graphics and added features, by the video game developer Bulkypix. Gameplay=Character creation The player begins by creating an avatar called a Brute. Players may create as many Brutes as they wish. The Brutes of new users are, by default, public and can be used by anyone to battle. However, a password can be added in the Brute's cell page so that only the person who created the Brute can use it. The player may customize his or her Brute by giving it a name and tweaking variables such as gender, clothing, hairstyle, accessories, and skin color. The Brute is then randomly assigned ability points (health, strength, agility, and speed), skills, weapons, and pets. There are 26 weapons in the game, 28 skills to learn, and 3 pets: dogs, wolves, and bears. Battle arena and leveling The player gains experience points from fighting in the arena and expanding his or her dojo by recruiting other players to be pupils. Each time a player levels up, one of the Brute's three statistics (strength, agility, and speed) is increased. There is also a chance that the Brute will gain a new weapon, a new skill, or a new pet. The arena fights are completely automatic and require no input from the user. Brutes with higher levels and skills tend to be more successful. Though the player cannot control his or her Brute in a fight, the player can control who the Brute challenges. Other than fights that result when a pupil is recruited, a Brute is limited to three or five (depending on the version of the game) fights per day. Six fights are allowed on the first day when the character is created. However, as players are allowed to create as many Brutes as they wish, players may continue to engage in fights using other Brute characters. Skills There are a total of 42 skills a Brute can gain each time it levels up: {  * 6th Sense * Armour * Bolt of Lightning * Bomb * Cry of the Damned * Determination * Deluge * Extra-Thick Skin  * Feline Agility * Fierce Brute * Fist of fury * Hammer * Herculean Strength * Hypnosis * Immortal * Impact  * Implacable * Lead skeleton * Lightning bolt * Martial Arts * Master of Arms * Net * Pugnacious * Reconescence * Sabotage * Shield  * Survival * Strong Arm * Tamer * Thief * Tragic Potion * Tornado of Blows * Untouchable * Vitality } Reviews Reviewers praised the game's sound effects, cute presentation, and cartoonish graphics. Reviewers found the game simple and easy to get into and appreciated that it required little time investment from the player. Reviewers also found that the game mechanic of pupil-recruitment contributed to the game by making it a social experience. Negative criticism focused on the inability to control the Brutes during the fights, which served to limit the game's depth and replayability. Reviewers also criticized the cap on the number of fights each Brute could engage in daily.

The Op√©ra-Comique presented 32 premieres during its time at the Salle Ventadour, including one of Fran√ßois-Adrien Boieldieu's last operas Les deux nuits on 20 May 1829, Auber's Fra Diavolo (as L'h√¥tellerie de Terracine) on 28 January 1830, and Ferdinand H√©rold's Zampa on 3 May 1831.Wild and Charlton (2005), pp. 77‚Äì78.Simeone (2000), p. 196. After 22 March 1832 the Op√©ra-Comique left the Salle Ventadour and moved to the Salle de la Bourse, where it opened on 24 September 1832.Charlton, David. \\"Paris. 4. 1789‚Äì1870.\\" in Sadie (1992) 3: 867, 869, 871. Th√©√¢tre Nautique The Salle Ventadour was reopened on 10 June 1834 as the Th√©√¢tre Nautique ‚Äî \\"nautique\\" since some of the main attractions were works performed in a basin of water on the stage. The programs included the ballet-pantomime Les ondines, which was based on Fouqu√©'s novella Undine, about a water sprite who marries a knight in order to save her soul, and used music from E. T. A. Hoffmann's opera of the same name; a full-length ballet William Tell with music by the German composer Jacques Strunz; a one-act ballet Le nouveau Robinson which also utilized the water; and a chinoiserie entitled Chao-Kang. These were interspersed with choruses by Carl Maria von Weber and others, sung by the members of a German company that was being formed in Paris at that time. The entr'acte was the overture to Weber's opera Oberon. The reviews were not good, and the size of the audience decreased over time. Harriet Smithson, the Irish actress who had married the French composer Hector Berlioz on 3 October 1833,Cairns (1999), p. 11. appeared with the Th√©√¢tre Nautique, opening on 22 November 1834 in a one-act pantomime put together by the resident choreographer Louis Henry. He called the concoction La derni√©re heure d'un condamn√©, and it used music by Cesare Pugni. The scenario took advantage of her talent for mad scenes: she had previously performed Ophelia in an English-language production of Shakespeare's Hamlet at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Od√©on to great acclaim in 1827. The new piece was a pantomime, since Smithson's French was far from perfect (and remained so for the rest of her life).Cairns (1969), pp. 619‚Äì620; Barzun (1969) 1: 264; 2: 29. Unfortunately, this new performance was not as favorably received. Jules Janin, writing in the Journal des d√©bats described it as consisting of \\"the two or three dozen contortions that are known as the art of mime\\" and complained that \\"they have cut Miss Smithson's tongue out\\".Cairns (1999), pp. 36‚Äì40. Berlioz anonymously wrote a positive review that appeared in the Gazette musicale but spent half of its time describing her previous appearance as Ophelia and the important influence it had had on the French style of acting. Not all the reviews were entirely negative: the English- language Galignani's Messenger praised Smithson, saying that the \\"single feature worth naming of this piece is the performance of Madame Berlioz, as the wife of the condamn√©, in which the agony and despair of such a situation is depicted with the fidelity and painful truth only within the reach of a perfect artiste.\\" But apparently her performances were not enough to rescue the enterprise, and the Th√©√¢tre Nautique closed in 1835. A short visit by the Th√©√¢tre-Italien The Salle Ventadour was used for a brief time by the Th√©√¢tre-Italien (30 January 1838 to 31 March 1838) after the destruction of the company's previous home, the Salle Favart, by fire on 15 January 1838. Only one opera new to Paris was presented, Gaetano Donizetti's Parisina. The company moved to the Od√©on for three years before returning to the Salle Ventadour in 1841.Levin, Alicia C. \\"A documentary overview of musical theaters in Paris, 1830‚Äì1900\\" in Fauser (2009), pp. 379‚Äì402. Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance While the Th√©√¢tre-Italien company was at the Od√©on, the Salle Ventadour was rented by Ant√©nor Joly, who with the encouragement of the two great French romantic dramatists Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, remodeled the theatre and renamed it the Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance. Their aim was to bring together in one theatre the elitist and popular audiences of Paris.Londr√© 1991, p. 235. The new company opened on 8 November 1838 with the premiere of Hugo's drama Ruy Blas with Fr√©d√©rick Lema√Ætre in the title role. It ran for 48 performances. Two new plays by Dumas were also presented, Bathilde (14 January 1839) and L'alchimiste (10 April 1839), although these were less successful.Hochman 1984, p. 53. The repertoire of the company was not limited to plays: Joly also mounted three new operas by Friedrich von Flotow, including Lady Melvil on 15 November 1838 (with some music also written by Albert GrisarBoyd, Malcolm; Lindgren, Lowell. \\"Grisar, Albert\\" in Sadie (1992) 2: 546‚Äì547. and Sophie Anne Thillon as Lady MelvilAnonymous. \\"Thillon [n√©e Hunt], Sophie Anne\\" in Sadie (1992) 4: 725.), L'eau merveilleuse on 30 January 1839, and Le naufrage de la M√©duse on 31 May 1839;Cohen, Peter. \\"Flotow, Friedrich (Adolph Ferdinand)\\" in Sadie (1992) 2: 242‚Äì246. and on 6 August 1839 the premiere of Donizetti's Lucie de Lammermoor, a French version of his Lucia di Lammermoor, with Thillon as Lucia and Achille Ricciardi as Edgardo.Ashbrook, William. \\"Lucia di Laamermoor\\" in Sadie (1992) 3: 69‚Äì72. Joly's venture was short-lived however, closing on 16 May 1841. The Th√©√¢tre- Italien settles in A performance by the Th√©√¢tre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour (). After the Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance closed in 1841 the theater was expanded to a capacity of 1,294 and was again used by the Th√©√¢tre-Italien company from 2 October 1841 to 28 June 1878. During this time the company presented the premiere of Donizetti's Don Pasquale (3 January 1843) and the Paris premieres of 15 of Verdi's operas, including Nabucco (1845), Ernani (1846, as Il Proscritto),Budden, Julian (1973).

Among the important singers appearing in Verdi's operas were Giorgio Ronconi, Adelaide Borghi-Mamo, and Gaetano Fraschini. Verdi is reported to have referred to the Salle Ventadour as his favorite opera house in Paris. Besides opera, the Salle Ventadour was also sometimes used for concerts.

The Th√©√¢tre-Italien shared the theater briefly, from 26 June to 4 July 1853, with the Op√©ra-Comique,Wild and Charlton (2005), p. 85. and from 16 March 1868 to 5 May 1868 the theater was shared with a new company directed by L√©on Carvalho, which was an extension of his Th√©√¢tre Lyrique on the Place du Ch√¢telet. The name Th√©√¢tre de la Renaissance was revived for the use of Carvalho's venture, in order to distinguish it from the Th√©√¢tre-Italien. Carvalho had overextended himself, however, and soon went bankrupt.Walsh 1981, pp. 235‚Äì238. The Th√©√¢tre-Italien also shared the theater with the Paris Op√©ra from 19 January to December 1874 (in the period after the Op√©ra's Salle Le Peletier burned down on 28 October 1873 and before the opening of the Op√©ra's new Palais Garnier on 5 January 1875).Langham Smith, Richard. \\"Paris. 5. 1870‚Äì1902.\\" in Sadie (1992) 3: 874.

At the instigation of the French tenor Victor Capoul the first professional public performance of the opera Les amants de V√©rone with text and music by the was mounted at the Salle Ventadour on 12 October 1878. The libretto follows Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet more closely than that of the opera by Gounod, but the marquis d'Ivry's opera suffered in comparison. Capoul sang Romeo, and the Belgian soprano Marie Heilbronn sang Juliet. The same singers later appeared in a production at Covent Garden which was performed three times beginning on 24 May 1879. The text was considered \\"coarse\\", and the music received a lukewarm response.Forbes, Elizabeth. \\"Ivry, Paul Xavier D√©sir√©, Marquis d' [Yrvid, Richard]\\" in Sadie (1992) 2: 862‚Äì863. After the Th√©√¢tre-Italien company went out of business in 1878, the Salle Ventadour was sold on 20 January 1879 and transformed into offices. The building has been primarily occupied by the Banque de France since 1893. Gustave Chouquet, writing in the 1900 edition of George Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, described the renovated building as follows: \\"its pediment, still decorated with statues of the Muses, now bears the words 'Banque d'escompte de Paris,' a truly exasperating sight\\".

In music theory, the flamenco mode (also Major-Phrygian) is a harmonized mode or scale abstracted from its use in flamenco music. In other words the collection of pitches in ascending order accompanied by chords represents the pitches and chords used together in flamenco songs and pieces. The key signature is the same as that of the Phrygian mode (on E: no accidentals; on C: four flats), with the raised third and seventh being written in as necessary with accidentals. Its modal/tonal characteristics are prominent in the Andalusian cadence.

DVC overview Damodar Basin As a result of the catastrophic flood of 1943, the Governor of Bengal appointed the Damodar Flood enquiry committee to suggest remedial measures. It suggested the creation of an authority similar to that of the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States. W.L. Voorduin, senior engineer of TVA, prepared a preliminary report wherein he submitted an outline of a plan designed for achieving flood control, irrigation, power generation and navigation. As a result, Damodar Valley Corporation came into existence in 1948 for development and management of the basin as a whole. Voorduin envisaged the construction of eight dams and a barrage, but it was later decided to have only four dams, at Tilaiya, Konar, Maithon and Panchet, and Durgapur Barrage. The first dam was built across the Barakar River at Tilaiya and inaugurated in 1953. The second dam across the Konar River was inaugurated in 1955.

Their uniform used as a symbol the swastika, which before World War II was a common religious symbol, and especially a sun sign. In 1923, the Swastikas won the Alpine Cup at the Banff Winter Carnival women's ice hockey championship. There were two other teams called the Swastikas, one in Edmonton, Alberta, and another the Windsor Swastikas of Windsor, Nova Scotia. History The first recorded women's ice hockey game in Fernie took place in January 1918. The game was played between teams composed of school teachers and bank clerks.Norton, Wayne (2009). Women on Ice: The Early Years of Women's Hockey in Western Canada (2009 ed.). p.127. Ronsdale Press. . Another game was held on January 1, 1919. The teams were organized by Mary Dragon and Edith Biggs. Several days later, the best players from both teams became the Fernie Ladies Hockey Team. Due to the limited number of opponents in the Kootenay region, the Fernie team played only one game in 1920. It was played in January against the Calgary Regents, at the Victoria Park arena. Fernie was defeated by a 1‚Äì0 score. Despite the loss, the Fernie team was invited to participate in the first ever Calgary Winter Carnival in 1921. At the Carnival, Fernie played the Regents once more. The Regents triumphed by a 3‚Äì0 score and a rivalry was born between the two. In February 1921, the Regents visited Fernie and won by a 1‚Äì0 score. In January 1922, the Fernie Ladies Hockey Team was named the Fernie Swastikas. The uniform was composed of white knickers and red sweaters. The Swastikas would appear at the 1922 Calgary Winter Carnival and play the Calgary Regents. The Swastikas won by a 4‚Äì0 score.Norton, Wayne (2009). Women on Ice: The Early Years of Women's Hockey in Western Canada (2009 ed.). p. 129. Ronsdale Press. . 1923 Championship In the 1920s and 1930s, there was a women's hockey tournament called the Alpine Cup at the Banff Winter Carnival. In 1923, the Fernie Swastikas defeated the Calgary Regents and the Vancouver Amazons to become champions. The city of Fernie welcomed back the team on March 7, 1923, as the club returned from Banff by train. When the Fernie team returned home, schools were let out early so that the children could cheer their champion team. Also, they were escorted to the Fernie City Hall celebration party by a RCMP honor guard and Fernie pipe band. Of note, Dahlia Schagel was captain of the team, and team member Dorothy Henderson was the daughter of the mayor of Fernie.Norton, Wayne (2009). Women on Ice: The Early Years of Women's Hockey in Western Canada (2009 ed.). p. 131. Ronsdale Press. . Banff Winter Carnival history On January 24, 1923, the Swastikas beat the Regents by a 3‚Äì0 score. After the victory, the Swastikas were invited to play for the Alpine Cup at the Banff Winter Carnival. At the Carnival, the Swastikas beat the Vancouver Amazons by a 2‚Äì0 score, and were named Alpine Cup champions as they had defeated the defending champions.Norton, Wayne (2009). Women on Ice: The Early Years of Women's Hockey in Western Canada (2009 ed.). p. 130. Ronsdale Press. . During the Carnival the Swastikas also played two scoreless games against the Calgary Regents, who attempted to win the Cup from them. The Swastikas returned to the Banff Carnival in 1924 to defend their title. In the quarterfinals, the Swastikas defeated the Calgary Patricias by a 4‚Äì1 tally. Their opposition in the semifinals was a newly formed team called the Canmore Minnewankas. Team founder Edith Biggs cracked her rib in the first period of the game against Canmore. Canmore was ahead 1‚Äì0 by the third period and upset the Swastikas. Despite the loss, Fernie team captain Dahlia Schagel was elected as Carnival Queen for the upcoming year.Norton, Wayne (2009). Women on Ice: The Early Years of Women's Hockey in Western Canada (2009 ed.). p.132. Ronsdale Press. . Disband After the loss to Canmore, the composition of the Swastikas team changed. Dorothy Henderson had died on May 24. Elaine Ross moved to Edmonton, where she later played for the Edmonton Monarchs, while team founder Mary Dragon moved to the United States. With the formation of the Alberta Amateur Hockey Federation, the Swastikas could only play teams from Alberta at the Banff Winter Carnival. This limited the level of competition for them; their only opposition in British Columbia was the newly formed Cranbrook Canucks. The Swastikas did not play a game in 1925, although Dahlia Schagel fulfilled her obligations as Carnival Queen at the 1925 Banff Winter Carnival. Their last appearance at the Banff Winter Carnival was in 1926, when they were defeated by the Edmonton Monarchs for the Alpine Cup.

Around 1845, King founded the Victoria Flour Mill in Gawler, \\"opposite Miss Calton's Old Spot Inn\\", named for his daughter not the monarch. Finding it unable to cope with demand, he had it converted to steam power and renamed it the Victoria Steam Flour Mill. He sold the business to Walter Duffield in 1847; the mill was destroyed by fire in 1867. He purchased many of the allotments offered in the first sales of the Town of Gawler. He also had extensive squatting leases or rights near Sheaoak Log, Templers, and on the River Wakefield. near Rhynie, and stocked them with sheep and cattle from Tasmania and South Africa. Then came the Victorian gold rush, when most able-bodied men were moving east in search of the precious metal. Around 1851 King fitted out a small party of men from his station with horses and dray to try their luck. They travelled overland via Wentworth and Swan Hill to the diggings with six months' provisions. They had some success, and divided the gold as arranged, and were all able to go farming on their own land, purchased from the proceeds of their journey. Nor did they forget the generosity of Mr. King. With increasing value of his (leasehold) land, it had become too valuable for grazing, and King was obliged to send his stock further north to Baldina, then to Outalpa, and spent large sums of money in sinking wells. Then came a dreadful drought, when many pastoralists had heavy stock losses, and King was forced to sell up in a buyer's market, losing all his rural properties including Kingsford. He found employment in 1865 as Special Magistrate for the Government at Port Augusta and Melrose, but lost that position in a series of retrenchments. His last Government appointment was as inspector of timber, located in Western Australia, being responsible for jarrah imports for the South Australian Railways. He retired in poor health to his home on Kensingston Terrace, where he died aged 76 years. Recognition King Street, Gawler, was named for him, and Victoria Terrace and Victoria Place may have referred to the Mill, destroyed by fire in 1867, or its successor, demolished before 1900. Stephen King Jr. Stephen King Jr. ca. 1885 Stephen King Jr. was born on the family property \\"Kingsford\\" on the North Para River near Gawler,http://johnmcdouallstuart.org.au/companions the third (at least) in a line of eldest sons to be named \\"Stephen\\". He was educated by private tutors A. K. Varley, James Fawsett, and Dr. W. M. Dickenson, then at the Adelaide Educational Institution. He also received training from Canon Coombs and Dean Russell, presumably with a view to joining the Anglican clergy, Stuart expedition He left his father's station in 1861, and joined Stuart's transcontinental party, enduring great hardships on the journey, which lasted from 1 October 1861 to February 1863, and on 25 July 1862 reached the north coast of Australia and hoisted the Union Jack on the shores of Adam Bay, from Darwin. Apart from his duties as explorer and surveyor, he made sketches of the expedition for the leader, and it was King who marked the letters \\"J. McD. S\\" on the tree later discovered G. R. McMinn. A sister constructed a flag used to welcome the returning party. In 1863, he was employed by C. B. Fisher and Benjamin Rochfort droving cattle from Pekina Station to Gunnawarrah, near Swan Hill, Victoria. The Top End In 1864, King joined B. T. Finniss's expedition to the Northern Territory, and was put in charge of stock being carried by the steamer South Australian for the projected settlement at Adam Bay. The sheep were landed at Escape Cliffs, and then he had charge of the horse party, with F. H. Litchfield's expedition to the head of the Adelaide River and back. During that journey King contracted malaria, and in a high fever was perilously ill. He was carried back to the depot in a litter, a week's march, and Dr. Ninnis sent for. The doctor arrived after a ride of two days, and ordered the patient's return to Adelaide. :Litchield discovered the Finniss and Reynolds Rivers, and found gold in the gorge of an ancient stream at the base of Mount Bennett (lat. 12.55 S.). On his return to Adelaide in February 1860, King was employed by the Government Survey Department in various surveying projects around the colony. The Overland Telegraph Line From December 1868 to March 1870, King worked for George Goyder in the survey of Darwin township, then from August 1870 was employed as surveyor by Darwent & Dalwood, who had contracted to construct the northernmost of the Overland Telegraph Line. The contract over, King joined the Government service under (later Sir) Charles Todd, and R. C. Patterson. He led the advance party as far as Powells Creek. During this period he opened the first track for teams from Elsie Creek to the Roper River landing, and constructed a jetty near Leichhardts Bar. He also opened up the first track to Daly Waters. It was about this time that the overdue return to base station of work parties under Walter Rutt and R. C. Burton was causing concern. They were presumed stranded north of Elsie Creek, and short of stores, but their exact whereabouts was unknown. King and Giles were despatched with teams and packhorses, and arrived in time to relieve them, but not before they had been driven to the expedient of killing some of their draught cattle. Return to Adelaide In 1874, King returned to the Survey Department, and until 1893 was employed in a range of projects around the colony, but with health failing, less arduous work was found for him in Adelaide. In 1912 he retired to his home \\"Calta Wurlie\\", on Kensington terrace, Kensington. He died on 8 October 1915 at the age of 74, and was buried in North Road Cemetery, Nailsworth, South Australia, leaving a widow, three sons, and five daughters. Prior to his death, King and his cousin and brother-in-law J. W. Billiatt (then living in Devonshire, England) were the last survivors of the John McDouall Stuart exploration party, which successfully crossed Australia from south to north.

During her tenure, the U.S. secured more than $500 million in annual peacekeeping budget reductions through the right-sizing of missions; the elimination of hundreds of UN back-office positions through automation; the first revision to the compensation package for UN staff, resulting in annual savings of more than $100 million; and significant efficiencies in the use of UN real estate. Coleman was also a leader on the U.S. efforts to combat sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers, helping to secure watershed resolutions that increased transparency through the naming of those countries with troops accused of abuses, and increased penalties through the repatriation of entire military contingents in the case of unaddressed or repeated abuse.

Established in 1902, its principal aim is to increase the public awareness and understanding of science, engineering and technology, and their role in society, by means of various awards and by communicating the nature, processes, ethics, and excitement of science. Membership is open to all. History The South African Association for the Advancement of Science was founded in 1902 and modelled on the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BA), now known as the British Science Association. One of the most prominent scientists involved in the movement to establish S2A3 was Dr (later Sir) David Gill (1843‚Äì1914), director of the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, who was elected its first president. All scientific disciplines were accommodated, with the result that membership rose to over 1000. For many years S2A3 was the largest and most influential scientific society in southern Africa. Members met once a year in different southern African cities to present papers and tend to the business of the Association. The first annual meeting was held in Cape Town in 1903. Two years later the Association met jointly with the British Science Association in South Africa. A second joint meeting was held in South Africa in 1929. The annual meetings were discontinued in the nineteen-seventies, whereupon the Association's membership declined to its present level of around 100.

In 1826, the city of Nice, encouraged by King Charles F√©lix, bought it from its owners and had it demolished and rebuilt. It was inaugurated in 1828 with Giovanni Pacini's Il Barone di Bolsheim. In 1856, a great ball was organized in the honour of King Victor Emmanuel II. In 1860, Napoleon III was invited to attend an evening at the Th√©√¢tre Royal. For this special occasion, Johann Strauss led the orchestra. The same year, the theatre became the ‚ÄúTh√©√¢tre Imp√©rial‚Äù. In 1864, Napoleon III returned, accompanied by Tsar Alexander II of Russia. In 1868, Louis II, Duke of Bavaria attended a performance of Cendrillon. The Th√©√¢tre Royal was renamed ‚ÄúTh√©√¢tre Municipal‚Äù in 1870. On Wednesday, March 23rd 1881, as the opera Lucia di Lammermoor began, a gas leak started a huge fire. The fire was controlled the next day but there was nothing left of the theatre. Three siblings of Marjory Kennedy-Fraser died in the fire: Lizzie, Kate and James (soprano, contralto and baritone respectively). The city of Nice immediately decided to rebuild another theatre on the same site. It was designed by architect Fran√ßois Aune with the apparent approval of Charles Garnier, the architect of the Paris Opera. On February 7th 1885, the Th√©√¢tre Municipal re-opened with Verdi‚Äôs Aida.Alexandre. Ivan A. Nice pour m√©moire. Diapason 649, September 2016, p9.

Artistic directors included Edoardo Sonzogno (1887-88), Raoul Gunsbourg (1889-91) and Ferdinand Aym√© (1950-82). Musical directors included Alexandre Luigini (1888-89 and 1897-98), Albert Wolff (1930-32 and 1934-37), Antonio de Almeida (1976-78) and Pierre Dervaux (1978-82). In 1902, it was named Op√©ra de Nice and is today referred to as Op√©ra Nice C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur. With the support of the M√©decin family of Nice, the house flourished, attracting major singers and directors in opera, but despite the efforts of Jean-Albert Cartier from 1994‚Äì1997, the importance of the house declined. 21st century From 2001 to 2009 the director-general was the Belgian producer Paul-√âmile Fourny. He was succeeded by Jacques H√©douin, with a policy of closer working with the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo, as well as closer collaboration with the two regional orchestras, the Orchestre philharmonique de Nice and the Orchestre r√©gional de Cannes-Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur.Fauchet B.

The 700 Interceptor introduced in 1960 was a modified version of the company's 692 cc Constellation model. In 1962, the company introduced the 750 Interceptor which evolved constantly until the end of production in 1970. In 2018, the Interceptor model was reintroduced as a 648 cc parallel twin. 700 Interceptor In 1960, Royal Enfield introduced the first motorcycle bearing the name Interceptor. It had a tuned version of the company's biggest engine, the 692 cc vertical-twin and was only sold in the US and Canada. All engines had the engine prefix letters \\"VAX\\" and so these are often referred as \\"VAX Interceptors\\". It may be noted that the then flagship 692 cc Constellation had the VA engine prefix(on the US export model) and \\"X\\" was added to denote that Interceptor had an experimental engine. They had twin carburettors, except for some early bikes, a factory lightened and balanced crankshaft, hot \\"R\\" cams, Lucas racing magneto with manual advance and a few other weight saving modifications compared to other Royal Enfield models. There was also an Interceptor \\"S\\" (Sports) model with \\"highway trim\\"‚Äîquick detachable (QD) lights etc., offered when Enfield failed to sell sufficient quantities of bikes in the standard scrambler trim. A total of 158 692 cc Interceptors were made as per the Redditch factory despatch ledgers held by the Royal Enfield Owners Club in the UK. All of these machines should have been stamped with the VAX prefixed engine numbers. The maximum possible quantity of 692 cc VAX Interceptors is 170. The first bikes left the factory in December 1959, and the last ones were despatched in July 1961. Series 1 Interceptor Royal Enfield introduced their all new 736 cc twin cylinder engine in 1962 on the 750 Interceptor. Bore and stroke was . The new engine was similar to the 692 cc engine; but there was hardly any part that was not modified or improved. The engine cases were beefed up to withstand the increased torque. What sets this engine apart from other contemporary British twins is that the crankshaft was dynamically balanced from the factory which made these bikes one of the smoothest British twin engines ever. The Series 1 bikes had an automatic advance magneto, coil ignition and a new seat. There was a rare single carburettor model as well. It was manufactured until 1966. Series 1A Interceptor The Series 1A Interceptor was introduced in 1967, with two sub models GP7 and TT7. The major change was the introduction of coil ignition, eliminating the magneto. The US models received a new chrome tank, a new seat, instrument mounts, handlebar, and mudguards. All S1A interceptors had twin Mark 1 Amal carburettors. Series 2 Interceptor The Series 2 Interceptor engine was a major redesign of the Series 1A engine. It included a wet sump engine to improve oil flow to the crankshaft. The CB points were moved to the end of exhaust camshaft and the timing cover was redesigned accordingly. This engine was used on the Interceptor until the end of production in 1970. This engine was later used on Rickman Interceptor and Clymer Enfields. Series 3 prototype Royal Enfield made a prototype Series 3 Interceptor to replace the Series 2. The bore was enlarged to to increase the engine capacity to 778 cc; it was called the 800 Interceptor. However, the factory closed down before mass production was realised. 2018 Interceptor 650 Parallel Twin In November 2017 at EICMA, Royal Enfield debuted a new parallel twin, the Interceptor 650. The modern bike was unveiled by Royal Enfield CEO, Siddhartha Lal and President, Rudratej Singh. Powered by a new air-oil cooled 650 cc parallel twin engine, the new Interceptor draws heavily on its '60s design heritage.. Like the original Interceptor, the new motorcycle has a tubular cradle frame. The teardrop tank features traditional Royal Enfield badges and a Monza-style fuel cap. Potential Royal Enfield V-twin The UK weekly Motor Cycle News reported in November 2018 that Royal Enfield has just produced a \\"concept bike\\" that echoes a much earlier model. The new bike was called the \\"Concept KX 838 V-twin\\", and has the appearance of a \\"bagger\\". Painted entirely in black and presumably 838cc, it features girder forks, softail suspension, and a single-sided swingarm. Royal Enfield has claimed that the bike is no more than a \\"concept\\", but according to MCN the bike appears to be \\"production-ready\\".

Her half-sisters were Aisha and Umm Kulthum bint Abi Bakr, and her half-brothers were Abdul-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr.

When Muhammad and Abu Bakr sought refuge in the cave of Thawr outside Mecca on their migration to Medina in 622, Asma used to carry food to them under cover of dark. When the two men left the cave, Asma tied the goods with the two belts of her cover, and for this ingenuity she received from Muhammad the title Dhat an-Nitaqayn, meaning \\"She of the Two Belts\\". She was married to Al-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam shortly before the Hijra. She joined him in Medina a few months later.Bewley/Saad p. 177. Medina: 623 onwards Asma found her new neighbours to be \\"sincere women\\". She was a poor baker, and they used to make bread for her. She and Al-Zubayr arrived in Medina with \\"neither property nor slave nor any possession in the earth other than his horse.\\" Asma used to feed the horse, taking it out to graze and grinding date-stones for it. Muhammad gave Al-Zubayr some date-palms in Medina, and Asma used to carry date-stones on her head from the garden to their home, a journey of about two miles. One day she passed Muhammad, who offered her a lift home on his camel, but fearing her husband's jealousy, she modestly refused. Al-Zubayr told her, however, that she should have accepted rather than carry such a heavy load on foot. When Abu Bakr eventually gave them a slave, Asma said that \\"it was as if he had set me free.\\" Her mother Qutayla bint Abduluzza came to visit her in Medina, bringing gifts of dates, ghee and mimosa leaves. Asma would not admit her to the house or accept the gifts until she had sent her sister Aisha to consult with Muhammad. Muhammad advised that it was correct for Asma to show hospitality to her mother‚Äù Asma and Al-Zubayr had eight children. # Abdullah # Al-Munzir. # Asim. # Al-Muhajir. # Khadija. # Umm al-Hasan. # A‚Äôisha. # Urwa, a major transmitter of ahadith.Bewley/Saad p. 176.

The Battle of Yarmouk The Battle of Yarmouk in 636 is regarded as one of the most decisive battles in military history.

The earliest histories pay great tribute to AsmƒÅ's bravery there. Al-Waqidi wrote that the Quraysh women fought harder than the men. Every time the men ran away, the women fought, fearing that if they lost, the Romans would enslave them.Islamic Conquest of Syria: A translation of Fatuhusham by al-Imam al-Waqidi Translated by Mawlana Sulayman al-Kindi Page 331-332 Asma's opposition to Yazid Asma's son, Abdullah, and his cousin, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, were both grandsons of Abu Bakr and nephews of Aisha. When Hussein ibn Ali was killed in Karbala, Abdullah, who had been Hussein's friend, collected the people of Mecca and rose up against Yazid. When he heard about this, Yazid had a silver chain made and sent to Mecca with the intention of having Walid ibn Utbah arrest Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr with it.Najeebabadi, Akbar Shah (2001). The History of Islam vol. 2, p. 110. Riyadh: Darussalam. . In Mecca and Medina Hussein's family had a strong support base, and the people were willing to stand up for them. Hussein's remaining family moved back to Madina. Eventually Abdullah consolidated his power by sending a governor to Kufa. Soon Abdullah established his power in Iraq, southern Arabia, the greater part of Syria and parts of Egypt. Yazid tried to end Abdullah's rebellion by invading the Hejaz, and he took Medina after the Battle of al-Harrah followed by the siege of Mecca. His sudden death ended the campaign and threw the Umayyads into disarray, with civil war eventually breaking out. After the Umayyad civil war ended, Abdullah lost Egypt and whatever he had of Syria to Marwan I. This, coupled with the Kharijite rebellions in Iraq, reduced his domain to only the Hejaz. Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr was finally defeated by Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, who sent Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. Hajjaj was from Ta‚Äôif, as were those who had killed Hussein. Abdullah asked his mother Asma what he should do, then left to take on Hajjaj. Hajjaj's army defeated and Abdullah died on the battlefield in 692. The defeat of Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr re-established Umayyad control over the Empire. A few years later in 740ad the people of Kufa called Zayd ibn Ali, the grandson of Hussein, over to Kufa. Zaydis believe that in Zayd's last hour, he was also betrayed by the people of Kufa,.\\"Islam re-defined: an intelligent man‚Äôs guide towards understanding Islam, p. 54 Rebellion and Violence in Islamic Law By Khaled Abou El Fadl page 72Al-Tabari, The waning of the Umayyad Caliphate, Carole Hillenbrand, 1989, pp. 37, 38.The Encyclopedia of Religion Vol.16, Mircea Eliade, Charles J.

The second element, gorica, means 'hill' in Slovene, and so the name literally means 'Pijavec hill' (or 'hill near the place where water sinks into the ground').

This compound is one of the most stable \\"first-row\\" transition metal hydrides. Preparation It was first reported in 1931. Of the several ways to produce this compound, is the protonation of the pentacarbonyl manganate anion. The latter is formed from reduction of dimanganese decacarbonyl, (Mn(CO)5)2. The reaction is shown below. :LiHB(C2H5)3 (Superhydride) + ¬Ω Mn2(CO)10 ‚Üí Li[Mn(CO)5] + ¬Ω H2 \\\\+ (C2H5)3B :Li[Mn(CO)5] + CF3SO3H ‚Üí HMn(CO)5 \\\\+ Salts of can be isolated as crystalline (Œº-nitrido‚Äîbis-(triphenylphosphorus)) salt, which is smoothly protonated by CF3SO3H. :PPN[Mn(CO)5] + CF3SO3H ‚Üí HMn(CO)5 \\\\+ This compound can also be formed by the reaction of a solution of pentacarbonyl(trimethylsilyl)manganese with water. The reaction is shown below. :2 (CO)5MnSiMe3 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí HMn(CO)5 \\\\+ Me3SiOSiMe3 Structure and properties The compound has octahedral symmetry and its molecular point group is C4v. The H-Mn bond length is 1.44 ¬± 0.03 √Ö. A gas phase electron diffraction study confirms this data. The structure of HMn(CO)5 has been studied by many methods including X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction, and electron diffraction. HMn(CO)5 can be related to the structure of a hexacarbonyl complex such as , and therefore has the following similar properties. The occupied molecular orbitals on the top are the 2 t2g orbitals. They are characterized as metal 3dœÄ orbitals. Since the antibonding 2œÄ orbitals interact with the carbonyl groups, (or in this case, ) the t2g orbital is stabilized compared to the 3dœÄ orbital, which in turn will cause changes in the sigma and pi interactions. Main reactions The pKa of HMn(CO)5 in water is 7.1. It is thus comparable to hydrogen sulfide, a common inorganic acid, in its acidity. A common reaction involving the HMn(CO)5 species is substitution of the CO ligands by organophosphines, as occurs both thermally and photochemically. In this way the following derivatives form MnH(CO)3P2, MnH(CO)2P3, and MnH(CO)P4, (where P = P(OEt)3, PPh(OEt)2, PPh2OEt, PPh(OiPr)2). The compound HMn(CO)5 can be used to reduce olefins and other organic compounds, as well as metal halides.

It is one of the first Telugu novels written in modern Telugu and considered among the classic works of all times. Title Ganapathi is the name of the main protagonist. This novel portrays the lives of Ganapathi and his two previous generations (Grandfather and Father). Social Backdrop The story revolves around various villages in the East Godavari District of Andhra Pradesh, India in the backdrop of social setting in 1910-1920 and satirically criticises the practice of kanyasulkam (Now abandoned/banned practice of groom paying money to the bride's father). Though it sounds comic to read, the underlying truth reflects the acute poverty in Brahmin families. Story/Plot The story starts with the narrator attending a marriage and waiting to be served dinner. As it is quite late already, while waiting for the rasam to be served, he dozes off and has a dream. In the dream he sees a short, fat man who narrates his story and exhorts the narrator to bring it out into the world. It starts with a village in EastGodavari called Mandapalli where Papayya Sastry, the grand father of Ganapathi lives. Papayya faces many difficulties in his village so he go to Pune in Maharashtra, worked in the kingdom of Peshwas and earned some money. He comes back to his native village and married a girl by paying Kanyasulkam. After having a son (Gangadharudu), Papayya dies due to old age. Gangadharudu (literally means bearer of water in Telugu/Sanskrit) along with his mother migrates to Kakinada, District headquarters of Godavari District. After attaining young age, Gangadharudu starts earning by bringing drinking water to the households from the pond. Though he works all the day, it was difficult for the family to make ends meet. Later Gangaharudu's mother dies. Eventually he was married and soon dies after his son Ganapathi's birth. Since there is no one to help/take care of them, Ganapathi's mother moves to her brother's village with her kid. In the brother's house though they were given food and shelter they are treated as an additional burden by the brother's wife. Since his childhood Ganapathi amuses the whole village with his bizarre and comic acts like riding donkeys. He left the school in the preliminary level itself. Due to his acts he had to leave the village along with his mother. Then they settled in another village where Ganapathi opens a school for children (Though he himself never got educated properly). The ensuing sequences are full of comedy with village people trying to look for a suitable bride to Ganapathi. Ganapathi's mother goes to a pilgrimage to faraway places along with other village ladies and dies there. Ganapathi marries a girl by paying kanyasulkam to the bride's father (who actually not the father of the girl) with the help of donations from villagers. But it turns out that the girl was already married earlier. The first husband files a case on Ganapathi along with the self-proclaimed girl's father. To avade the arrest Ganapathi escapes from that village. This novel ends on a funny note with the author comes out of his dream by server pouring hot Rasam on his hand in the marriage dinner. Characters Important characters of the novel are : * Papayya * Gangadharudu * Ganapathi * Ganapathi's mother * Ganapathi's uncle * Ganapathi's uncle's wife Radio Adaptation Sthanam Narasimha Rao produced this novel into a radio play with the same name Ganapathi. It was broadcast in the All India Radio in Telugu language during the 1960s and 1970s. It is highly successful in those days with people gathering in groups near the radio sets to listen to this comic play.

He is also the former chief executive of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Education Elderfield graduated from Cambridge University in 1988 with a master's degree in International relations, and earned a bachelor's degree in foreign service, cum laude, from the School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University in 1987. He was at asked at a parliamentary committee \\"In regard to baseline qualifications, if your staff is regulating the financial sector, should it not be the case where they should have the bare minimum required in the market as well, a qualified financial adviser status, or they've gone through certain industry exams. It's obviously important to have.\\" But Mr Elderfield disagreed: \\"I don't agree with that. But I think I'm conflicted because I've never taken a professional exam in my life.\\" Career Elderfield was chief executive of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA, the financial services sector in Bermuda) from July 2007. During his two years as head of the financial regulator in Bermuda, Elderfield introduced reforms to strengthen the island's reputation for international insurance, banking and fund management. He strengthened regulation in Bermuda by significantly increasing staff numbers, expanding the BMA's learning and development programme, and introducing a scoring system for management. Prior to joining the BMA, Elderfield spent eight years at the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) as a head of a number of departments responsible for exchange and clearing-house supervision of secondary markets, listing policy and for banking supervision. He was the official responsible for supervising Northern Rock in the months before the collapsed bank applied for its first bailout. He represented the FSA on the Basel Accord Implementation Group and chaired the FSA panel responsible for economic capital model review. Before joining the FSA, Elderfield established the European operation of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) and held position at the London Investment Banking Association, the British Bankers Association and a Washington DC-based consultancy firm, the Institute for Strategy Development. Elderfield earned an annual salary of ‚Ç¨340,000 a year at the Central Bank of Ireland compared to a salary of $730,000 (‚Ç¨533,000) in Bermuda and was said to be at his desk from 7.30am to 7pm on weekdays while working a half-day on Sundays.http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/old-practices-at-central- bank-are-holding-back-new-ireland-2634785.html> Appointment as financial regulator in Ireland Elderfield was appointed in October 2009 by the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan. He succeeded Patrick Neary, who retired early over the handling of the regulator's investigation into the ‚Ç¨87 million in secret directors' loans at Anglo Irish Bank. Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan welcomed his appointment, saying: \\"The appointment of Mr Elderfield, particularly given his extensive international regulatory experience, is a key step in the restructuring of financial services regulation in Ireland.\\" He took up his position in January 2010. He has been tasked with the rebuilding of the financial regulators function and restoring its reputation, overseeing the recapitalisation of the banks, helping to wean them off the funding support of Government guarantees, match Ireland's regulatory changes with the raft of measures coming internationally, and strike a measured balance in his approach to maintain a competitive position for the Irish financial services sector at a global level. Mr Elderfield said he intended to pursue a policy of 'assertive' regulation, backed up by the credible threat of enforcement. An Irish Times poll suggests that he is meeting success in restoring credibility to the Financial Regulators office with 68% responding positively. In April 2010 he said that there was \\"critical absence of intellectual firepower within his staff Notable decisions madeCapital requirements for banks= Following the transfer of loans to NAMA at the end of March 2010, the regulator's office announced under the Government's guarantee scheme must now meet a core equity ratio of 8 per cent by the end of 2010. This is to ensure that they can withstand future losses. =Appointment of administrator to Quinn Insurance= On 30 March 2010, following an application by the Financial Regulator's office, the High Court appointed joint provisional administrators to Quinn Insurance Limited, part of the Quinn Group of companies. According to the Irish Independent, eight subsidiaries of Quinn Insurance provided guarantees of ‚Ç¨1.2bn to cover Quinn Group's debts, prompting the regulator to seek the appointment of provisional administrators in the High Court. The Quinn Group took action to counter the moves by the Financial Regulator, mobilising its employees into street protests, financial discussions with its creditors, in an effort to seek a resolution to the uncertainty created by the appointment of provisional administrators to Quinn Insurance. On 15 April 2010, the Irish Times reported that Quinn Insurance decided not to fight the appointment of a permanent administrator. This was following a direct challenge by Elderfield to the groups owner, Irelands former richest man, Sean Quinn, to \\"Show me the money\\" that would have solved the financial difficulties.

Born on 10 July 1948 in Parikula in Puri in the Indian state of Odisha, he died in Bhubaneswar on 11 October 2010. He had several leading dancer-disciples, besides earning top national and international honours. Early life Pradhan was born on 10 July 1948 to Muralidahr Pradhan and Dwitika Devi, of Parikul. Initially, he neither cried nor moved, giving the impression that he was stillborn. The father vowed that if the child survived, he would send him to serve their deity Lord Balunkeshwar for 5 years. At age 3, while travelling in a bullock cart, the boy fell and was injured severely. The father vowed to send him for 10 years instead of 5. From age 5 to 15, the boy worked in a temple as a devotee of Lord Shiva. While there he did chores, help and obey the seniors, look after the harvest, study and take lessons of dance as a Gotipua dancer. In this dance form, boys dress like girls to perform. The boy was fair in colour. He had handsome features and grew his hair long. He was a quick learner. Though only senior boys were allowed to learn Mardal, a musical instrument, he furtively taught himself to play the instrument while the older boys worked at the paddy fields. In July 1966, he arrived in Bhubaneswar and entered Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya. His talent as a Mardal player made his teachers depend on him as an accompanist. Parents of female students started inviting him for accompanying their daughters for practice. Gradually he started teaching students privately. In his third year, he played Mardal for noted dancer Rita Devi and went to Mumbai. There, he started participating in many programmes. He won 1st prize in all Orissa Dance Competition held at Puri. Then came opportunities in Oriya films, opera and theatres where he directed dance sequences in their plays and productions. He completed his Nrityacharya degree course in 1971.  Career  He received a National Scholarship from 1971 to 1973 under Padmabibhusan Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra. He got extensive theory from Dhirendranath Pattnaik. Pradhan married Smt. Sulochana Pradhan in 1972. By the time he had finished college, he had established himself among the art lovers of Bhubaneswar. After the scholarship he took two years additional training in Odissi dance and trained himself in mastering the Mardal. He was actively associated with many organisations such as Bhubaneswar Kalakendra, Sangeeta of Jatni, Chilika Sangeet Parishad and Balugaon. He directed and choreographed many dance items for the annual day events of schools and colleges. He got involved in Ekamra theatres from 1969. He found a patron in Kamala Lochana Mohanty of Ekamra theatres. From 1979‚Äì96 he travelled with Padmashree Late Sanjukta Panigrahi.  Orissa Dance Academy  In 1973, he started an organisation called Natyaloka, drawing help and inspiration from Pt. Raghunath Panigrahi and Late Smt Sanjukta Panigrahi. He renamed it Sunati and in 1975 renamed it again, to Orissa Dance Academy. The initial 35 students included Krushnapriya Pattjoshi, Saratpriya Pattjoshi, Susmita Mitra, Dipti Sahoo, Digbala Sahoo, Aruna Mohanty, Archana Mohanty, Annapurna Panda, Jaba Dey and Ananya Das. Classes were held three times a week. With the help of journalist B.K. Kanungo, he held classes at Sambadika Bhawan, which belonged to the Journalist Association.

It is also used as a training mill. The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 20842. (click on \\"Technische gegevens\\" to view) History The mill was originally built in 1692 at Westzaan, Noord Holland by millwright Jelis Hendricksz. At Westzaan, it was originally a paper mill known as De Jong Dolfijn ( or De Koperen Berg (. In 1819, the mill was converted to a barley mill, (click on \\"Geschiedenis\\" to view) later also being used for milling rice. In 1900, the mill was sold for demolition. It was dismantled and shipped across the Zuiderzee to Joure by millwright Jelmer Visser of Heerenveen. The mill had been bought by miller Auke Sietzes Penninga to replace the smock mill De Westenberg, which had burnt down on 13 April 1900. The new mill was named De Jonge Wester but was known locally as Penninga's Molen. It worked until 1936, or 1938. It is said to have been worked occasionally during the Second World War, but was otherwise used as stables. By the 1960s, the mill was derelict. The Stichting de Penninga's Molen () was established in 1966. It purchased Penninga's Molen in 1970 for ∆í1. In 1970-71, the mill was restored by millwright Y Schakel of Exmorra. During the restoration, the windshaft from the Rijperpoldermolen, Ryptsjerk was fitted. This mill had burnt down on 2 June 1968. The windshaft originally in Penninga's Molen is now fitted to Sint Annamolen, Nijmegen, Gelderland. The mill was officially opened on 10 May 1972 by Commissioner to the Queen H Rijpstra. The mill serves as a training mill for the Gild Fryske Mounders (. On 7 July 2000, the mill was dressed overall in the Zaanse style, in celebration of its Zaan origins and the centenary of its erection in Joure. A further restoration of the mill was undertaken in 2007. The stage was rebuilt, and the cap removed from the mill to allow it to be completely rethatched. Description Penninga's Molen is what the Dutch describe as a \\"stellingmolen\\" . It is a three-storey smock mill on a three- storey base. The bottom storey of the base is of brick, with the upper two storeys being a wood-framed structure. The stage is at second-floor level, above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of . The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by De Munck Keizer of Martenshoek, Groningen. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel, which has 53 cogs. This drives the wallower (30 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel, which has 133 cogs. The great spur wheel drives two pairs of diameter Cullen millstones via lantern pinion stone nuts which has 29 staves each. A pair of diameter French Burr millstones is driven via a lantern pinion stone nut which has 29 staves.

He was born in Chelmsford, Essex. In the 1930s his family moved to Nottingham, where he attended the Mundella Grammar School from 1934 to 1939. From 1949 to 1952 he attended Royal College of Art, where his teachers were Ruskin Spear, Carel Weight and John Minton. His fellow students included Derrick Greaves and Jack Smith. Middleditch associated early on with the so-called 'Kitchen Sink' school of realist painters in the 1950s. He held teaching posts at Chelsea School of Art, St Martins School of Art, and Norwich School of Art (where he became head of fine art). He was elected a member of the Royal Academy in 1973, later as Keeper of the Royal Academy (in charge of the schools). Middleditch exhibited widely and is represented in major and regional collections in UK, US, Canada, and Australia. Style Middleditch was a painter, draughtsman and printmaker. He drew his motifs from the natural world: grasses, water, feathers, opening petals, reflections etc. Gradually shifting observed patterns became fleeting abstracted movements often caught from water currents and light effects. His later work became much more abstracted, concerned with repeating patterns as if seen from above and filling the picture-frame; drawing influence from kilims and Persian carpets. Middleditch died in 1987 in Chelmsford, Essex.

Biography Wankel was raised by wealthy parents at the Kambo estate outside Moss, in √òstfold county, Norway. Her father Georg Reinholdt Wankel was a Norwegian politician for the Conservative Party. Her mother was the noted author Sigrid Ring (1870‚Äì1955), who was a granddaughter of Norwegian politician Paul Vinsnes.Sigrid Ring (Store norske leksikon)Kambo (Store norske leksikon) After his father died in 1907, the family moved to Christiania. For three years, she was a student at the art school of Norwegian painter Harriet Backer (1906‚Äì09). Upon the advice of Henrik S√∏rensen, she became a pupil of Henri Matisse from 1910. She spent long periods in Paris and attended the Pedro Araujo art school (1922‚Äì23). She also studied under Fernand L√©ger and Am√©d√©e Ozenfant at the Acad√©mie Moderne (1925‚Äì29).Charlotte Wankel (Store norske leksikon) At the Acad√©mie Moderne, Wankel was introduced to a type of avant-garde architecture and painting which was inspired by Swiss architect and designer, Le Corbusier. Wankel participated in many important exhibitions in Paris, including L'art d'aujord'hui at the Exposition Internationale des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes in 1925. Here she exhibited along with many famous artists, including Piet Mondrian, Pablo Picasso, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi, Juan Gris, Sonia Terk and Robert Delaunay. The exhibition received much press coverage and was the first major international exhibition of avant- garde art after the First World War.Norske Kunstnerbiografier: Charlotte Wankel (Moderna kvinnor) However the time was not right for avant-garde art in Norway. She was on the summer exhibition at Kunstnernes Hus in Oslo in 1933. Her solo exhibition at the Artists' Association in 1930 and Blomqvist in 1934 and a major exhibition was her retrospective exhibition at the National Gallery in Oslo in 1940 generally received negative criticism. Charlotte Wankel was a restrained and sober artist. She gave her pictures a tight, clear and cool form of treatment, mixed with a purist design. The formats were often modest and palette dominated by blue-gray, brown, yellow, ocher and pink. Her production in late 1930 - and 1950-years are characterized by a stronger palette and compositions are non-figurative, often with some abstract figurative elements.

Its members included Aleksandr Sardan (Barabanov) (1901‚Äì1974), Boris Smirnov-Rusetsky (1905‚Äì1993), (1891‚Äì1971), (1895‚Äì1942?), (1900‚Äì1972) and (1879‚Äì1945/46). In 1922, the artists group was founded by Fateyev, a painter who was then 32 years old. The name Amaravella, however, was introduced in 1928 when Sardan coined it based from a Sanskrit word that means \\"bearing light\\" or \\"creative energy\\". Ideologically the group belonged to the Russian cosmism movement. It embraced a range of ideas and artistic approaches that explored cosmic harmony. The artists, who lived in a commune, were heavily influenced by the ancient East's works, as well as those of Helena Blavatsky, Nicholas Roerich, Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis, and Victor Borisov-Musatov. Like the M. Sokolov and V. Komarovskiy, members of the Amaravella were persecuted because their work did not conform to the \\"socialist realism\\" style prescribed for Soviet art. Particularly, their works were categorized as \\"formalism\\" through the 1932 decree On Restructuring Literary and Artistic Organizations, which repressed creative freedom. Several paintings of the Amaravella artists were collected by Iury Linnik, who claimed to be a cosmist poet and philosopher, and I.V. Savitsky.

Simon Ramo had known Trevor Gardner since before World War II, when both had worked for General Electric at Schenectady, New York. After the war, Ramo joined Hughes Aircraft as head of electronics research and eventually rose to the position of Director of Guided Missile Research and Development; both Ramo and Dean Wooldridge had gained acclaim for their work on the Air Force's Falcon missile. Ramo had become Director of Operations and Executive Vice President when he and Wooldridge, in September 1953, left Hughes to form their own company. Other members of the Teapot Committee were Clark Blanchard Millikan, Charles C. Lauritsen, and Louis Dunn (all of Caltech); Hendrik Wade Bode (Bell Telephone Labs); Allen E. Puckett (Hughes Aircraft); George Kistiakowsky (Harvard); Jerome B. Wiesner (MIT); and Lawrence A. Hyland (Bendix Aviation). The committee's military liaison was Colonel Bernard A. Schriever, the Air Staff's Assistant for Development Planning and a brigadier general selectee.Ltr, Gardener to von Neumann et al, Oct 31, 1953, in RG 340, 471.6, 557-50, vol 6, NA. Deliberations Meeting first in November and twice more afterward, the Teapot Committee rendered its report on February 10, 1954. Originally, the Teapot Committee had favored eliminating the Snark, but in its report recommended only that the Snark's guidance system be simplified and that development continue. Members contended that Snark's primary usefulness was as a decoy for the manned bomber force. Similarly, the Teapot Committee was not enthusiastic about the Navaho as a strategic weapon because of the inadequacies of ramjets. Nonetheless, the committee supported continued research in certain technological areas, especially in the propulsion systems, in which the Navaho project provided direct benefit for ICBM development.Ltr, Simon Ramo to Trevor Gardner, no subj, Feb 10, 1954, w/atch:Recommendation of the SMEC, Feb 10, 1954, in AFSC/HO, Alfred Rockefeller Documents, 1951-1954. The Teapot Committee centered its attention on the feasibility of developing the major subsystems for the Atlas-that is, propulsion, guidance, airframe, and warhead. Given the reported Soviet lead in intercontinental ballistic missiles and the countervailing advantage offered by the American nuclear breakthrough, the committee concluded that it was imperative to accelerate Atlas development. However, the speed up and early delivery of the Atlas ICBM could be accomplished only by embarking on a \\"crash program\\" that would include changing drastically the missile's specifications and creating an entirely new management organization. In its summary, the Teapot Committee called for a \\"radical reorganization of the . . . project considerably transcending the [existing] Convair framework.\\" Foremost among the committee's recommendations to accelerate the ICBM program, was the call to revise the Atlas's requirements in conformity with the new realities created as a result of the thermonuclear breakthrough. The promise of lighter, higher-yield weapons was later confirmed during the Operation Castle nuclear test series, that began in March 1954. As a result, the stringent accuracy requirement for Atlas was reduced to between 2 and . This revision would also permit slashing the missile's weight and diameter. As a further benefit, the lower accuracy requirement eased the Atlas's guidance problem and prompted an investigation of an advanced, on board, all-inertial guidance system. In the management area, Committee had questioned the contractor's ability to complete the Atlas work, based on Convair's current development approach and the competence of its scientific and engineering staff. Further, members recommended that the Air Force undertake a thorough review of up to a year, if necessary, to determine how best to achieve the earliest possible operational capability. Pending such a review, the Air Force should curtail all production of full- scale flight test vehicles and detailed design of the guidance system. On the other hand, the committee members encouraged continuing basic research in guidance systems, North American Aviation's rocket propulsion work, and the preparation of instrument flight test facilities. At last, the Report concluded that the Atlas program could be accelerated only if it was entrusted to \\"an unusually competent group of scientists and engineers capable of making systems analyses, supervising the research phases and completely controlling the experimental and hardware phases of the program.\\" Unfortunately, no single company currently employed persons of that caliber; they would have to be recruited from among several industry, university, and government organizations. Looking ahead, the committee also noted that this proposed new development-management group would have to be free \\"of excessive detailed regulation by government agencies.\\" Finally, the Committee believed that, if it was assigned such a crash basis priority, the Air Force could obtain an operational Atlas ICBM in 6 to 8 years-that is, sometime between 1960 and 1962. The Committee recommendations nearly duplicated those of a Rand Corporation study issued two days earlier, on February 8, 1954. The Rand study, headed by Dr. Bruno W. Augustein, was begun in September 1953 for the purpose of finding ways to accelerate ICBM development. Not surprisingly, then, the Teapot Committee used and based much of its findings on Rand data. In connection with these studies, Trevor Gardner advised Assistant Secretary Donald A. Quarles that an emergency operational capability could be attained as early as 1958, if enough money and priority were provided. Gardner meant that, in an emergency, contractor engineers in lieu of Air Force personnel could launch the Atlas. Gardner's claim was facetiously dubbed a \\"PhD\\" type capability.Memo, Gardner to Quarles, Feb 16, 1954.

Henllan is situated along minor roads off the A484 Cardigan to Carmarthen road, some 3 miles (5 km) east of Newcastle Emlyn and now merges as a result of infill development with the small settlement of Trebedw. The settlement lies to the south of the Teifi Valley Railway amidst steep, attractive woodland areas (many of which are subject to Tree Preservation Orders) in the Teifi Valley. The name is Old Welsh, H√™n-llan, meaning \\"old church-enclosure\\". Henllan comprises over 90 dwellings. It has a post office and local community facilities, is served by the new 'Super School' at Llandysul and by Newcastle Emlyn for other shops and services. The Welsh language is in every day use. Henllan is served by a bus route between Carmarthen and Newcastle Emlyn, serviced on a daily basis. Several enterprises are located in the settlement, including the old railway station at Henllan, which is the centre for the Vale of Teifi Railway Preservation Society, and an important tourist facility for the area. There used to be auction rooms where there is now a garden centre; and there is an artist's studio (Diane Matthias).

He wrote extensively on a range of medical and scientific subjects. Career Born in Swansea, Wales in 1924, Davies attended Swansea Grammar School (now known as Bishop Gore School) and gained a Meyricke Exhibition in chemistry at Jesus College, Oxford. He interrupted his studies in 1943 to join the Royal Engineers, in which regiment he was commissioned and served in Italy, India and Malaya. Upon returning to Oxford in 1946, he changed his degree and started reading medicine. Davies undertook his clinical studies at Westminster Hospital, London, where he gained the Sturges Prize in clinical medicine and a BMA prize for his essay on Clinical Teaching in Relation to the Practice of Medicine. He qualified BM, BCh in 1952. After various appointments in paediatrics and general medicine, Davies specialised in cardiology and took up a residency at the University of Colorado Medical Center in Denver. After a year he was appointed by Dr Paul Wood as registrar at the National Heart Hospital and Institute of Cardiology in London. Subsequently he was senior registrar and senior lecturer at Guy's Hospital and was awarded the Carey-Coombs prize of the University of Bristol. Dr Davies graduated with a D.Phil. from Jesus College, Oxford in 1965 with a thesis entitled Respiratory disturbances in congenital heart disease. In 1967 he was invited to join the faculty of the University of Colorado, Denver, and was Chief of Cardiology at the VA Hospital in Denver . Personal life Davies married his wife Lucette in 1955. The couple had one daughter, who lives in London. Dr Davies lived in Sion, Switzerland and devoted most of his time to writing. He died in December 2016. Medical interests=The Hywel Davies chest deformity Dr Davies gave the first comprehensive description in 1959 of the chest deformities which accompany congenital heart disease and their relationship to disturbed lung function.Davies H : Chest Deformities in Congenital Heart Disease, Brit J Dis Chest 53, 151‚Äì155, 1959 and Davies H, Williams JV, Wood P : Lung Stiffness in States of Abnormal Pulmonary Blood Flow and Pressure, Brit Heart J 24, 129‚Äì138, 1962. The typical barrel-shaped deformity accompanying the large ventricular septal defect was called the \\"Hywel Davies chest deformity\\" by Dr Paul Wood and was known as such for some years, and as the \\"Thorax of Davies\\" on the continent . He showed that it was the result of increased stiffness of the lungs due to high flow and pressure of blood in them. These observations of the relationship of the circulation to lung function were followed by a more general study of the causes of breathlessness in heart disease, which led to a series of papers in the 1960s and 70's analysing the interplay of chemical changes in the blood (acidity, oxygenation and carbon dioxide level), mechanical factors in the control of breathing in various forms of heart disease as well as in normal people. He was associated closely in those years with active and pioneering cardiac surgical programmes (Drs Henry Swan, George Pappas and Thomas Starzl in Denver, Sir Russell Brock and Mr Donald Ross at Guy's Hospital). Cholesterol, heart disease and modern medicine In the 1970s and 80's Dr. Davies became increasingly interested in coronary artery disease and its causes, for that now constituted the majority of his practice. He believes that medicine took a wrong turning when it elected to devote the bulk of its resources to studying cholesterol and to largely inconclusive clinical trials based on flawed statistical manipulation. He did not accept that elevated cholesterol levels were the main cause of coronary disease, nor that eating margarine or not eating eggs would have any beneficial effects.Davies H : \\"On the Therapy of Coronary Artery Disease\\" (Editorial). Am J Med Sci 258, 371‚Äì373, 1969 He emphasised that the beginnings of coronary disease could occur in childhood and that the first changes consisted of undue multiplication of cells in the inner lining of the coronary arteries, and that these had little to do with fats and cholesterol. He was given the opportunity to study these further in an accelerated human form when he was asked by Mr (now Sir) Terence English to join him at Papworth Hospital, where he worked from 1986 to 1988 as consultant cardiologist to the heart transplant programme. Vitamin D During these years he became increasingly interested in the role of ionic calcium in the control of cell division, and the environmental causes of disturbance of calcium metabolism, especially excessive intakes of calcium, vitamin D and phosphorus. He has pointed out in recent publications such as \\"The Child, The Environment and Coronary Heart Disease\\",The Child, its Environment, and the Development of Coronary Arterial Disease (in press) the subtle inter-relationships that exist in the genesis of coronary disease, including pre-natal influences, infant feeding patterns, and the particular role of calcium and inflammation. The failure to recognise these, he believes, has been responsible for the lack of real progress in the understanding of heart disease as well as cancer, which is also an aberration of cell multiplication. He is much opposed to current attempts, mostly by non- clinicians, to increase the intake of Vitamin D without any consideration of its deleterious cardiovascular effects, which he sees as unwise and even dangerous. His singular views have recently been expressed in a self-published monograph entitled \\"Vitamin D in Disarray\\"\\"Vitamin D in Disarray\\" self- published monograph, 2010 where he calls into serious question the existence of widespread Vitamin D deficiency as well as the associations claimed between geographic latitude and various diseases such as multiple sclerosis and cancer. Homeopathy In the chapter \\"New Year's Aspirations and Alternative Medicine\\" from Uncle Ebe and Other Stories, Davies asserts that much criticism of alternative medicine in general and homoeopathy in particular is faulty. He suggests that large scale statistical analysis of the benefits of such treatments are impossible because \\"in homeopathy each individual is treated as unique, and no two patients receive the same medications for the same complaint\\" and so \\"the number of factors involved the decision making becomes so great that statistical comparisons are worthless\\". He goes onto argue that many homoeopathic sceptics ignore evidence from the field of materials science, stating that \\"the assumption that great dilutions of active principles imply the ultimate absence of useful properties is intuitively reasonable but is only an assumption and is probably wrong\\".Uncle Ebe and Other Stories, The Memoir Club, Durham 2010 Other views Davies disagrees that global warming is the result of human activity and argues that the most pressing threat to humanity's future consists of pollution caused by the growth in the number of new chemical products that have found their way into the human food chain over the last half-century. Orthodox medical advice about diet has been wrong he believes, pointing to the increase in obesity and diabetes rates as evidence for this claim.

Multiyork was a member of the Worshipful Company of Furniture Makers and carried the Manufacturing Guild Mark. The company entered administration on 22 November 2017, followed by its sister company Feather & Black on 27 November. History Multiyork was founded in 1978 and initially operated in the Old Mill site in Mellis, a small village in Suffolk. Multiyork was purchased out of receivership by the Wade Furniture Group in February 1995. At that time there were 28 stores. The factory and Head Office have been based at Thetford in Norfolk since 1992 and in 2000 Multiyork expanded its site increasing factory capacity to the production of over 1,000 pieces of furniture a week. Multiyork's 60th store opened in Lakeside Shopping Centre in Thurrock in October 2008 and was the first to follow a new lifestyle led in- store format. Administration Multiyork entered administration on 22 November 2017, with around 550 jobs said to be at risk. An administrator cited a fall in consumer confidence. In December 2017, DFS Furniture (DFS) reached an agreement to purchase the eight store leases, product designs, marketing databases and the Multiyork brand for ¬£1.2 million. The deal also specified that as of 18 February, administrators will stop using the Multiyork brand. Six of the stores will reopen under the Sofa Workshop brand; the remaining two will open as branches of DFS. Craftsmanship All Multiyork sofas were made at its Thetford factory. The company employed a team of 60 seamstresses who stitched the upholstery fabrics. Multiyork operated a sewing apprenticeship school to ensure that these skills were passed down from one generation to the next and to preserve the craft within the local region. Not only did Multiyork use their own fabrics but also offered designer fabrics such as Mulberry, Designers Guild, Arthur Sanderson, Romo and Jane Churchill. The Factory Store Multiyork's Factory outlet was run out of its original site in Mellis. The store had over dedicated to clearance stock, including ex display and end of line stock, as well as cancelled customer orders and customer returns. Fundraising In 2009 Multiyork raised ¬£25,000 for BBC Children in Need. The company's in-house design team created six limited edition Pudsey sofas, five of which toured its stores and travelled a total of between them to raise funds. The sofas, which incorporated Pudsey Bear and the ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre Supporting BBC Children in Need‚Äô banner, were also featured on BBC One on the appeal night programme and were auctioned off through the BBC's Children in Need eBay auction to raise further cash.

Shock tube is used to convey a detonation signal to a detonator. Shock tube is a hollow extruded tube containing a thin layer of energetic material upon its inner diameter. Once it is initiated, the shock tube transfers a signal to a detonating output charge. It was invented by Per Anders Persson of Nitro Nobel AB, patented, and sold by them under the registered trademark Nonel,James T. Thurman, ‚Äò‚ÄôPractical bomb scene investigation‚Äô‚Äò, p104 containing a small quantity of high explosive, but safer and more reliable than detonating cord with the same quantity of explosive. Another early product contained an enclosed combusting, non- detonating fiber. The most common product is 3 mm outer diameter and 1 mm inner diameter, with a tiny dusting of HMX/aluminum explosive powder on the tubing's inner surface, which detonates down the tube at a speed greater than 6500 feet per second but does not burst the tube. Being non-electrical and non-metallic, shock tubes are less sensitive to static electricity and radio frequency energy and thus have replaced many uses of electric detonators and are safer to handle and store than detonating cord. A version containing an explosive gas mixture has the additional advantage of being entirely inert until the tubing is charged with the gas. One manufacturer estimates that over 2 billion feet of shock tube are used each year worldwide, in commercial blasting, military demolition, theatrical special effects, automobile airbags, aircraft ejection seats, IED initiation and professional fireworks.

During Kenya's colonization by the British, much of the province was regarded as part of the 'White Highlands', for the exclusive use of the settler community. Therefore it saw political activity from the local communities who felt that they had an ancestral right to the land. This tension culminated in the 1950s with the Mau Mau rebellion; it saw the region placed under a state of emergency and the arrest of many prominent political leaders.  Climate  The climate of Central Province is generally cooler than that of the rest of Kenya, due to the region's higher altitude.

Bailey was diagnosed with a Glioblastoma brain tumor and given six months to live. For the next two years they would play primarily Christian music, with Bailey's experience as a cancer survivor strongly influencing their lyrics and message.  History = David Bailey  Bailey (1966‚Äì2010) was raised in Beirut, Lebanon, the son of Presbyterian missionaries. He spent some of his youth in Germany where he learned to play the guitar, and attended Grove City College in the United States. Bailey married and began work in data entry. Upon being diagnosed with a Glioblastoma brain tumor in 1996, which was to have killed him in six months, Bailey quit his job to concentrate on songwriting and touring. Recording over 20 cds with performances in 21 countries and 45 U.S. states, bailey led a vigorous schedule for the 14 years after diagnosis. He performed in a wide variety of venues including churches, cancer celebration days, support groups, patient/ caregiver groups, conferences, retreats, & corporate events. In May 2003, he won the prestigious Kerrville NewFolk songwriting competition and shared the stage with many others. From Beirut to Budapest, from Pittsburgh to Portland, and on hundreds of stages in between, he inspired and entertained thousands of listeners and maintained a relentless tour schedule year round. In Nov 2008, david's tumor returned. He underwent surgeries and chemotherapy while still maintaining his tour schedule. He had more surgery in the late spring of 2010 and still made a final tour in July 2010. david died on October 2, 2010, fighting to the very end with his tenacious hope, 14 years and 3 months post diagnosis.  Douglas Ebert  Born and raised in West Virginia, Douglas Ebert (b. 1963) is a self-taught guitar player. He attended West Virginia University for two years, but dropped out to move to Fairfax, Virginia with his young wife and child. Like his partner, Ebert left the corporate sector in exchange for a guitar and a touring schedule. In 1996, as Bailey struggled to come to terms with his terminal diagnosis, he teamed up with friend and fellow church-goer Ebert. The two performed at local churches, among other venues including a prison.\\"Cancer fight brings people together\\", Pittsburgh Post- Gazette, 1997-06-29 In a short amount of time, their combined talents provided enough material for a first album, Second Chance. When it became clear that Bailey's treatments were working, news of his inspirational story spread across the nation. The band's touring schedule exploded; \\"48 Hours\\" producers did a short segment on David, and in 1997 the band sang the national anthem at a Pittsburgh Pirates game, splitting the bill with fellow cancer survivor Sue Sarver.\\"Cancer fight brings people together\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 1997-06-29 While touring in California the duo assembled material for a second album, Vista Point.  Breakup: 1998  In 1997, Bailey released Peace, his first solo album. The decision came after creative differences began to drive Ebert and Bailey apart, with Ebert quitting in the following year to support his three growing children. Since then, Bailey, who never left the business, has recorded eighteen albums, occasionally drawing on material written during Not By Chance. On November 20, 2008, Bailey had surgery to remove a cyst and new tumor. As he did twelve years before, he toured between treatments. He lived in Earlysville, Virginia until his death in 2010. Ebert resides in Fredericksburg, Virginia. 2009 marked his emergence back into music, collaborating with high-school friend Kathy Fisher.

His half-brother was Weahwewa (Wolf Dog). Military service On June 7, 1878, during the leadup to what became known as the Bannock War, Malheur Reservation Indian agent William V. Rinehart reported to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs that Wahweveh, with 55 braves, had picked up supplies and was heading east. On Saturday, June 22, 1878, Black Eagle rescued the severely injured Pony Blanket (Egan) from the battlefield‚Äîsaving his life, but signaling the end of Egan's tenure as war chief. By July, news of a new Tukadika (Mountain Sheep Eater) Snake outbreak in Idaho drew Wahweveh and his Hunipui (Bear Killer) Snake dog-soldiers onto the battlefront. On their way, on July 4 Black Eagle and his warriors attacked four heavily laden supply wagons at La Grande on their way to Pendleton. They destroyed the wagons, killed and mutilated their drivers, and scattered the freight. On August 13, 1878, more than 60 warriors rode into the Malheur Indian Agency and were arrested after they surrendered to American troops. Among the warriors were Cheegibah (Leggins), son of Natchez (Boy) and grandson of Chief Winnemucca the Younger; Otiz (Left Hand), grandson of Owitze (Twisted Hand) and Ochiho (Red Willow), son of Chochoco (Has No Horse). Under intense interrogation, Leggins identified the ranking war chiefs: Oytes (Left Hand), Bannock Joe Pohave (Racehorse), Captain Bearskin (Honalelo (Little Bearskin Dick)), Big John Ponce (Three Coyotes), Eagle Eye Wahweveh (Black Eagle), Charley Chongyo (Pipe), D.E. Johnson, Beads, and Surger Wahi (Fox). Most of the leaders whom Leggins named were shot in 1878. Lieutenant Colonel James Forsyth reported that his troops had killed Wahweveh (Black Eagle) on July 31, 1878; however, in spring 1879 Wahweveh and medicine chief Tamanmo (Black Spirit), with a few Snake dog soldiers, raided a mining camp on the Oregon- Idaho border and killed several Chinese laborers.

In 1587 Faza was destroyed by the Portuguese as the local Sheikh had supported Mir Ali Beg, a notorious privateer who had earlier played a key role in ousting the Portuguese from Muscat. The Portuguese arrived from Goa with some 650 men on their punitive expedition, and unleashed their fury on Faza. Everybody they could find was killed, including the local Sheikh. The Portuguese preserved his head in a barrel of salt for display in India. After 4 days of looting they invited Fazas arch-rivals from Pate town to take away anything that they liked from Faza.Martin, 1973, p.6 Faza was later resettled. The Portuguese in Faza constructed a chapel there, however, nothing remains of it. In the 18th century Faza again fell into decline due to the rise of Pate. The English Consul Holmwood visited the place in 1873 and found it \\"dirty and infected with diseases\\".Martin, 1973, p.22 On 5 September 2009, a tragic fire took place, destroying 430 houses leaving 2500 homeless. The Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) have provided housing and thousands of items of emergency needs, including blankets, sanitation equipment, tanker loads of water etc., to some of those affected. The French government has funded a hospital, complete with theatre. This has removed the need for the 4 hour boat trip to Lamu in emergencies. The cost was KSh9.5m for the construction and a further KSh3.9m for theatre equipment. The KRCS have spent a further KSh23m on wells and food supplies.

Funzi consists of four mangrove covered islands where Funzi Island is the main island and the only one with permanent inhabitants. There is one village on the island with approximately 1500 members of the Shirazi Tribe. The absolute majority are Muslims and sustain on fishing and agriculture. The archipelago is located in Kwale district and is less known to tourists than the nearby Diani Beach.  Environment  Funzi Island is known for its pristine beaches and as Kenya's best nesting site for a variety of sea turtles, such as green turtle, Chelonia mydas, hawksbill, Eretmochelys imbricata and leatherback, Dermochelys coriacea. These species are classified as either endangered or critically endangered by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) but are found on Funzi due to a low degree of human disturbance on the natural sandy beaches. However, the turtles are becoming increasingly threatened in Funzi due to the expansion of non-environmental tourism and a heavy pressure from destructive fishing methods and various pollution sources.  Tourism  Popular excursions for visitors in Funzi are the crocodile safari in the nearby Ramisi River or to going on a cultural tour in the village and enjoy a traditionally cooked lunch. The best swimming experience in the area will undoubtedly be on the naturally formed sandbank just offshore from Funzi village. Its fine sand ripples appear only during low tide and it stretches well over a kilometer in length. A locally formed group called Funzi Turtle Club has started an ecotourism project with the support of Kenya Sea Turtle Conservation Trust to increase the protection and awareness about the local environment.  Transport  It is possible to go to Funzi without an organized travel agency. A matatu will take you to Ramisi junction in one hour from the Likoni terminal south of Mombasa.

Together with Bernard Schriever, the Air Staff's Assistant for Development Planning, Gardner was one of the prime movers of the U.S. ICBM program and was also involved in the U-2 program.https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4404/ch7-2.htm  Early life and career  Gardner was born in Cardiff, Wales, on 24 August 1915. He moved to the United States in 1928 and became a naturalized citizen in 1937. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the University of Southern California in 1937. He returned to the University of Southern California to teach freshman mathematics while obtaining his master's degree in business administration which he was awarded in 1939.  World War II  During World War II Gardner's work at the California Institute of Technology focused on rocket and atomic bomb projects for the Office of Scientific Research and Development. With the end of World War II, Gardner became associated with General Tire and Rubber Company of California as general manager and executive vice president. Three years later he left to found Hycon Manufacturing Co., an electronics manufacturer. He was president of Hycon until February 1953 when he became the Secretary of the Air Force's Special Assistant for Research and Development.  Involvement with ICBM program  U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower began his first term by initiating a defense policy that sought to significantly reduce spending. Gardner was asked to lead a committee and implement an economy program to reduce missile development activities. Its final report recommended that promising missile projects should be continued. The Atlas, under development since 1951, was America's best hope, however its development had been constrained by the Air Force due to the belief that missiles required too great an investment in systems that seemed \\"impossible' \\"Impatient, Gardner requested a scientific review of all Air Force missile programs in April 1953. The impetus came from two directions. First, he was concerned over the growing Soviet threat and, in August 1953, they exploded a hydrogen bomb. The other trend was the development of lighter nuclear weapons. The \\"impossible\\" ICBM was now much more possible. In October 1953 Gardner established a second committee ‚Äî the Teapot Committee ‚Äî to review the Air Force's strategic missiles ‚Äî the Snark, Navaho, and Atlas. He directed the committee to find ways to accelerate the development of the Atlas. The committee issued its report on 10 February 1954. Its thrust called for a \\"radical reorganization of the ...[Atlas] project considerably transcending the Convair framework\\" Gardner developed a five-year plan to accelerate the Atlas which would yield a \\"preliminary capability\\" by June 1958. In early 1955 most of the Eisenhower administration assumed that America had a strong lead over the Soviet Union in strategic technology and felt no particular urgency for the ICBM programs. The Killian Report indicated that America was becoming vulnerable and that the ICBM should be given the \\"highest priority.\\" While an Air Force priority, he believed that ICBMs must also be a national priority. He indicated that the U. S. could have a rudimentary ICBM by mid-1958 if the program was conducted on a crash basis. Eisenhower requested a briefing and, on 28 July 1955, Gardner, von Neumann, and Schriever made a presentation to the President and the National Security Council. As a result, the National Security Council recommended the ICBM be designated a \\"research program of the highest priority\\" which the President approved on 13 September 1955. Gardner had achieved his goal. In January 1955 the Scientific Advisory Committee urged the Air Force to develop a tactical ballistic missile. All three services developed plans and the interservice rivalry led to a compromise with the Air Force building the Thor and the Army and Navy in charge of the Jupiter. Gardner viewed this approach as dangerous since the IRBM could drain resources from the ICBM and threaten its early delivery. His fears were realized when President Eisenhower assigned the ICBM and the IRBM \\"joint\\" highest national priority. The ICBM program no longer had a unique status. Trevor Gardner felt betrayed and resigned his position in protest on 10 February 1956.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,808145,00.html  Return to public life  After the election in 1960 Gardner again became active in public life. He served on the President's Space Task Force Commission to review the nation's space program and also chaired the U.S. Air Force Space Task Force. He also became involved in preventing the use of weapons. Gardner played a major role in establishing the U. S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and was named to its General Advisory Commission on 1 March 1962\\\\. At the time of his death on 28 September 1963 in his home in Washington, D.C., Gardner was actively participating in Project Forecast, which was to chart the future course of the Air Force for the next decade. Gardner died on 28 September 1963.

Location The station is situated on the Western Australian coast south of Broome. It lies in the Shire of Broome in the Kimberley region and in the Dampierland bioregion. It is in area and runs over 20,000 head of cattle.Anna Plains Cattle Co. Anna Plains is operating under the Crown Lease number CL56-1982 and has the Land Act number LA3114/1154. Ecology The property adjoins Eighty Mile Beach, which is one of Australia's most important sites for migratory waders, and is listed under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international importance. That part of the station subject to periodic flooding forms part of the Mandora Marsh and Anna Plains Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for supporting large numbers of waders and waterbirds.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Mandora Marsh and Anna Plains. Downloaded from on 10 August 2011 History The traditional owners of the area is the Kardjari peoples to the north and the Njangamarda Kundal and Njangamarda Uparuka peoples to the south. In 1903 the station was owned by the partners, Percy and Felde, who then went to court over selling the station in 1905. The MacRobertson Expedition visited the area in June 1928, who described the station of being over 1 million acres in extent and famed for its shorthorn cattle. It was also noted that the expedition wireless was a source of great curiosity to the station's indigenous employees. Mr F. S. McMullen was the station owner in 1933. He petitioned the minister of agriculture to dispose of 10,000 head of cattle with a view to changing over to sheep. The request was made as the owner was unable to move his stock north through country infested with bush tick and new restrictions meant he was unable to move his cattle south because of pleuro- pneumonia and buffalo fly infestations. The station was subject to heavy rains in 1934 with of rain falling during the course of a storm, leaving the country under water for hundreds of miles. A passenger aeroplane flying from Port Hedland to Broome that was caught in the storm was forced to land at the station. At least 800 head were overlanded to the Meekatharra sales yeard later the same year and were the first cattle in the state to be subject to the Turner test for pleuro-pneumonia prior to sale. The station was stocked with approximately 10,000 head of cattle at this time. In 1935 a trapper, Daniel Joseph O'Brien, was found murdered near the station property. His body was exhumed from a shallow grave, as was the body of an Aboriginal man and both were taken back to the homestead. Following a cyclone in 1936, the station manager found the carcasses of 7 mules, 49 horses and 102 head of cattle that had been swept into the sea and drowned. During the storm it was estimated that of rain fell, damage included several windmills being blown over and a part of the homestead being destroyed. A drought in 1945 left the cattle in very bad condition with many dying. 1,100 head of cattle were taken overland from the station to the railway at Meekatharra in 1948 by the drover Georg Solvay. 1,200 head of cattle were loaded at Eighty Mile Beach, from the station in 1954 onto the LST landing craft Wan Kuo in the first shipment of its kind from Western Australia. The cattle were penned in batches of 15 along with about 10 tons of feed in readiness to be shipped to Manila. In 1959 the Talgarno village was built on land excised from the station. Talgarno was a British government project to test the accuracy of Blue Streak Rockets fired from Woomera. The village included housing, a hospital, swimming pools and a cinema. In 2010 the station was leased by the Anna Plains Cattle Company Pty Ltd. under the management of John Stoate. On 28 December 2017, Cyclone Hilda made landfall at Anna Plains as a category 1 cyclone.

The festival features a mix of jazz, classical music, experimental music, and world music. Its program is divided into three distinct categories, each with a particular musical focus: Inspiration, Crossover, and Luminaries. Strings of Autumn has been running since 1996.  Early years  Strings of Autumn was founded by Marek Vrabec in 1996 at the instigation of President Vaclav Havel, who hoped to start up a regular program of concerts at Prague Castle. These concerts often took place in parts of the castle previously inaccessible to the public. The first year featured mostly Czech artists, but in 1997 the festival showcased its first international artists, among them Jan Garbarek and the Hilliard Ensemble, who were making their first appearance in the Czech Republic. As the festival gained stature, it was able to attract an increasing number of high profile artists, including Michael Nyman, Magdalena Kozena and Oleg Maisenberg.  Removal of state funding  In 2004 a new president, Vaclav Klaus, was sworn in. The change of president led to a change in cultural policy at the castle, and the new administration announced it would no longer support Strings of Autumn. This was a major blow for the festival, which had by that point become a popular and established annual event. Klaus' decision received vigorous criticism, and a music magazine, Harmonie, nominated the castle administration for an 'anti-award,' suggesting that they had \\"decided to cancel one of the most interesting projects ‚Äì in terms of artistic programming and performance ‚Äì that exist in this country.\\"Harmonie magazine, May 2004 A lack of financial support or venues presented a substantial threat to the festival, but eventually new sponsors were found, and the festival took place again in 2004 in a reduced form, featuring performances by the Kronos Quartet and the Uri Caine ensemble.  2005 - present  Strings of Autumn subsequently established partnerships with new venues in Prague, including the Rudolfinum, the Estates Theatre, the Municipal House, and Prague Crossroads. With the continued backing of the City of Prague and of private sponsors, the festival returned in 2005 with a program of ten concerts, including the return of Michael Nyman and the Czech debut of Gary Burton.'Autumn Enchantment,' Prague Post Sept 21st 2005, http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/529-autumn-enchantment.html In the years that followed, the festival continued to stage performances from international artists who had never played in the country before. Artists who have performed at Strings since 2005 include Brad Mehldau, Cassandra Wilson, Bobby McFerrin and Ute Lemper. In 2010, the 15th anniversary of the festival, Strings of Autumn held a donors' gala evening at Municipal House in Prague, an unusual event for a Czech non-profit cultural organisation.'Strings of Autumn takes Gala Gamble,' Prague Post March 31, 2010 Bobby McFerrin performed at the gala, which was attended by public figures including Vaclav Havel and the Czech Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.

At the end of 1997 Alan Jones sold his share of the team to Jim and Ross Stone who renamed it Stone Brothers Racing. History=Formation At the 1995 Sandown 500 it was revealed that Alan Jones had concluded a deal with Dick Johnson Racing engineers Jim and Ross Stone to form a new team, with backing controversially from Glenn Seton Racing sponsor Philip Morris, for whom Jones drove. 1996 Named Alan Jones Racing, the team built two Ford EF Falcons to debut at Round 1 of the 1996 championship, #201 for Paul Romano and #301 for Jones, with Andrew Miedecke and Allan Grice joining the team for the endurance races. From January 1996 the Federal Government had outlawed the sponsorship of sporting events by tobacco companies. Thus Philip Morris could still sponsor a team but not directly market any of its products, resulting in the team being branded as Pack Leader Racing. After some teething problems with brakes in the opening rounds, the team began to move up the field with Jones leading during the early stages of the Bathurst 1000 before the car caught fire on lap 25. For two races in New Zealand at the end 1996 the team had local sponsorship with #6 driven by Paul Radisich and #9 by Jones. 1997 Having lost the Philip Moris sponsorship, in 1997 the team ran #9 for Jones with sponsorship from Komatsu and Pirtek, and a customer car for Mark Larkham as #10 with Mitre 10 sponsorship. Both cars upgraded to Ford EL Falcon specifications. Larkham was involved in a high speed with former team driver Paul Romano at round 2 at Phillip Island which saw a new car completed for the next round. Jones won a heat at the final round at Oran Park. For the endurance races Jason Bright drove with Jones with the pair joined by Scott Pruett at the Bathurst 1000. Andrew Miedecke rejoined the team to partner Larkham, finishing 3rd at Bathurst.

The Criticality Index of an activity (task) can be expressed as a ratio (between 0 and 1) but is more often expressed as a percentage. During a (e.g. Monte Carlo) simulation tasks can join or leave the critical path for any given iteration. The Criticality Index expresses how often a particular task was on the Critical Path during the analysis. Tasks with a high Criticality Index are more likely to cause delay to the project as they are more likely to be on the Critical Path. If a task does not exist for some iterations (e.g. it is probabilistic) then it is marked as not being critical. For example, a task that existed for 50% of the iterations and was critical 50% of the time it existed would have a Criticality Index of 25%. Benefits The Criticality Index allows you to identify tasks that are likely to cause delays to the project. By monitoring tasks with a high Criticality Index a project is less likely to be late. If a task has a 100% Criticality Index it means that during the analysis no matter how the task durations varied, the critical path always included the task. The task is therefore likely to be key in completing the project on time. Conversely tasks with a low or zero Criticality Index are much less likely to cause a delay in the project finish date. Limitations with Criticality index Just because a task is on the Critical Path all of the time, does not always mean that the task is going to be significant to the project completion date. For example, a task that is only 1 day long is unlikely to affect the project finish but it can still have a 100% Criticality Index. To avoid this problem one must also measure the correlation between the duration of a task and the duration of the project. Spearman's Rank correlation or Pearson's Product Moment can be used to measure the correlation.

The blade of a knife can be made from a variety of materials, the most common being carbon steel, stainless steel, tool steel and alloy steel. Other less-common materials used in knife blades include: cobalt and titanium alloys, ceramics, obsidian, and plastic. The hardness of steel is usually stated as a number on the Rockwell C scale (HRC) . The Rockwell scale is a hardness scale based on the resistance to indentation of a material, as opposed to other scales such as the Mohs scale (scratch resistance) testing used in mineralogy. As hardness increases, the blade becomes capable of taking and holding a better edge, but is more difficult to sharpen and more brittle (commonly called less \\"tough\\"). Laminating a harder steel between a softer one is an expensive process that to some extent gives the benefits of both types (see Damascus steel). Steel=Alloy steels *5160, a spring steel. Popular steel for forging swords and large knives. High toughness and good wear resistance. Popular sword manufacturers that use 5160 spring steel are Hanwei Forge and Generation 2. 5160 spring steel is mainly used on Medieval type swords. *6150, a chromium- vanadium alloy. Similar to 4140, 6150 is a tough steel with good impact resistance that can be hardened to the mid-50s on the HRC scale. While a good material for swords or hatchets, it is less than ideal for most knives because of its limited attainable hardness . Tolerates less than ideal temperature control in forging and heat treating (As does 5160). Probably does not hold an edge as well as 1095, but is tough, and easy to sharpen. *V-toku1 / V-toku2, alloyed steel with W /Cr's original characteristics. Tool steels Tool steel grades used in cutlery : A, D, O, M, T, S, L, W. See also AISI Tool Steel Grades. The following are tool steels, which are alloy steels commonly used to produce hardened cutting tools: *A2, a steel that trades wear resistance for toughness. It is used in custom made fighting knives by makers such as Phill Hartsfield, Rob Criswell, Mike Snody and John Fitzen (Razor Edge US) and one of the latest to standardise his camp/survival knives in A2 tool steel is Aaron Gough from Gough custom, Canada. A2 was the standard baseline steel used by Bark River Custom Knives. A2 is used as the standard tool steel for Black Wolf Knives range of Hunting Knives by Marc Godwin, Japan *A3, (No description available) *A4, (No description available) *A5, (No description available) *A6, this grade of tool steel air-hardens at a relatively low temperature (approximately the same temperature as oil-hardening grades) and is dimensionally stable. Therefore, it is commonly used for dies, forming tools, and gauges that do not require extreme wear resistance but do need high stability.. *A7, (No description available) *A8, C .55% Mn .30% Si .30% Cr 5.00% Mo 1.25% W 1.25% *A9, (No description available) *A10, this grade contains a uniform distribution of graphite particles to increase machinability and provide self-lubricating properties. It is commonly used for gauges, arbors, shears, and punches. *D2, is a high carbon, high chromium die steel and is the highest carbon alloy tool and die steel typically used in knife making.\\"D2 cold work high carbon, high chromium die steel: is the highest carbon alloy tool and die steel... typically used in knife making. It has 12% chromium so it doesn't resist corrosion as well as high chromium tool steels (like 440C and ATS-34) and can rust if continually exposed to corrosive moisture, acidic fluids (like orange juice or blood).... However, it is fairly corrosion resistant with minimal care.\\" With a chrome content of 12.00%, some call it a \\"semi-stainless\\", because of the lack of free Chromium in solution, even though it is defined by ASM and ANSI as stainless which contains at least 11.5% by weight of chromium.D2: Stainless or Not Stainless? Since very little D2 is made with 11% or less, and that is not the ANSI standard chromium content for D2, and 12% is the standard, D2 is then a stainless steel. It deserves the informal myth: \\"D2 knives hold an edge forever, and are impossible to sharpen.\\"D2 can be made extremely hard and wear resistant, and very tough, and that is, \\"why there is a huge industrial following.\\" So D2 steel is renowned for its edge holding ability, but is difficult to sharpen. While not as tough as premium carbon steels, it is much tougher than premium stainless steels. D2 knife blades were popularized by Jimmy Lile, and later by Bob Dozier. *O1, a popular forging steel. Good wear resistance and excellent edge retention. Very tough, but not as much as 5160. It is most commonly used by Randall Knives, Mad Dog Knives, and many other custom knife makers. *M2, is slightly tougher than D-2. As a high speed tool steel, it is capable of keeping a tempered edge at high temperatures generated in various machining processes. However, it isn't used as widely in factory production knives, as CPM M4 has become more popular. Custom knife makers still use it for knives intended for fine cutting with very thin edges. *M4, see High speed CPM REX M4. *T1 (No description available) *T2 (No description available) *S1, a medium carbon shock-resistant steel tool steel which combines moderate hardness with good impact toughness. Carbon content .40 - .55%. *S7, a shock- resistant medium carbon tool steel, with outstanding impact toughness and high strength, along with medium wear resistance. It has maximum shock resistance and high compression strength, which gives it good deformation resistance in use, while retaining good toughness. *W1, a water hardening tool steel. High carbon content. *W2, a tool steel that holds its edge quite well but not very tough. Has a carbon content of 1.5. Most readily available W2 has a carbon content of no more than 1-1.1%. It can be left at high hardness levels (it can attain a quenched hardness of 67 Rc) and still be quite tough especially in larger knives with thicker spines as the core of the thick portion of the blade does not attain full hardness because of the shallow hardening nature of the steel. Bill Moran considered it to be almost as tough as 5160, but it was unavailable for a period of time. W2 is one of the carbon steels that can produce a nice Hamon in heat treating. * SK3, SK4, SK5 - Japanese carbon steels. SK stands for \\"Steel Kougu\\" meaning \\"Steel Tool\\". The lower number indicates fewer impurities. CPM Tool Steel Crucible Industries produces Crucible Particle Metallurgy (CPM) tool steels using a powder metal forge process.. *CPM 1V, a proprietary steel, very high toughness, several times higher than A2 with same level of wear resistance. *CPM 3V, a proprietary steel, very high toughness, less than CPM 1V, but more than A2, and high wear resistance, better than CPM 1V. Used by several custom knives makers and factories, including Jerry Hossom, Mike Stewart [Bark River], Reese Weiland, Nathan Carothers, and Dan Keffeler. Makes good choice for swords and large knives. *CPM 4V, a proprietary steel, high-impact toughness and a very good wear resistance. Gaining popularity in Bladesports Competition Cutting knives. *CPM 9V, a modification of CPM 10V with lower carbon and vanadium to improve toughness and heat check resistance. *CPM 10V (AISI A11), highly wear- resistant tool steel, toughness comparable with D2 tool steel. Currently used by a few custom knife makers, including Christopher \\"Big Chris\\" Berry. Phil Wilson pioneered the use of CPM 10V and numerous other CPM steels in sporting knives. *CPM 15V, a proprietary steel, extremely high wear-resistant tool steel, thanks to 14.5% Vanadium content. Found only in custom knives. *CPM CRU-WEAR, a proprietary steel designed as a CPM upgrade to conventional Cru- Wear and D2 steels, it offers better wear resistance,toughness, and hardness. Chrome steel Chrome steel is one of a class of non stainless steels which are used for applications such as bearings, tools and drills. *AISI 52100, ball bearing steel. In terms of wear resistance, a little better than that of the O1 steel, however 52100 is also tougher. It has very fine carbides, which translates into high edge stability. Used by many custom makers, Swamp Rat knives uses 52100 steel under the name SR101. Also referred to as 100 Cr 6/102 Cr6 as per ISO nomenclature and confrorms to BS grade En31. *SUJ2, Japanese equivalent to AISI 52100 steel. *DIN 5401  Semi-stainless steels  Steels that did not fit into the stainless category because they may not have enough of a certain element, such as chromium. *V-Gin1, a fine- grained steel with Mo, V for the best effect of Cr. *V-Gin2, more Cr is added for better corrosion resistance. *V-Gin3B, more Cr is added for better corrosion resistance. Stainless steel Stainless steel is a popular class of material for knife blades because it resists corrosion and is easy to maintain. However, it is not impervious to corrosion or rust. In order for a steel to be considered stainless it must have a chromium content of at least 10.5%. ;154CM / ATS-34 steels These two steels are practically identical in composition. They were introduced into custom knives by Bob Loveless circa 1972. * 154CM is produced by Crucible Industries. It is used extensively by Benchmade Knife Company and many others. * CPM 154 is identical to 154CM in composition, however it is produced by Crucible using CPM Process, bringing all the benefits of Particle Metallurgy technology. * ATS-34 is produced by Hitachi Metals. The latter two are considered premium cutlery steels for both folding knives and fixed blades. ;300 series American stainless steel manufactured by Allegheny Technologies, North American Stainless and Crucible Industries. Because the 300 series is non-hardenable (non-Martensitic), they are primarily used in entry level dive knives and used as the outer layers in a San Mai blade. *The 300 series is non-magnetic. * 302 is a Chromium-Nickel austenitic alloy used for blenders and mixers. * 303 is an austenitic stainless steel specifically designed to exhibit improved machinability. * 303 SE is an austenitic chromium-nickel steel to which selenium has been added to improve machinability and non-galling characteristics. *304L is a low carbon austenitic chromium-nickel steel designed for special applications. *316L is a low carbon austenitic chromium-nickel steel with superior corrosion and heat resisting qualities. * 321 is an austenitic chromium-nickel steel with a high chromium content of 18.00%. 400 series *The 400 series remains one of the most popular choices for knife makers because it is easy to sharpen and it is resistant to corrosion. * The 400 series is magnetic. * 410 is a hardenable, straight-chromium stainless steel which combines superior wear resistance with excellent corrosion resistance. * 416 is very similar to 410 with the addition of sulfur to improve machinability. * 420 has more carbon than 410, but less than 440. As such it is softer than 440, but has a higher toughness. 420 series contain several types with various carbon content between .15% and .40% this steel grade is widely used to make high end razor blades, surgical scalpels etc. It obtains about 57 HRC after suitable heat treatment. 420HC ( 420C ) is a higher carbon content 420 stainless. The HC stands for \\"high carbon\\" and it can be brought to a higher hardness than regular 420 and should not be mistaken for it. Buck Knives and Gerber Knives use 420HC extensively. 420A (420J1) and 420B ( 420J2 ) are economical, highly corrosion resistant stainless steel grades. Knife manufacturers use this material in budget knives, also in diving knives due to its high resistance to corrosion. 440 series has three types, 440A, 440B and 440C. 440A is a relatively a low cost, highly corrosion resistant stainless steel. In China, Ahonest ChangJiang Stainless steel developed 440A modified 7Cr17MoV, by adding more element vanadium. 440B is almost identical to 440A, but has a higher carbon content range compared to 440A 440C is considered a high-end stainless steel. It is very resistant to corrosion and is one of the most common stainless alloys used for knife making. The once ubiquitous American Buck Model 110 Folding Hunter was made of 440C before 1981. 440C has highest carbon content in 440 group. B√∂hler n695 is equivalent to 440C. Knife blades specified as being \\"440\\" can typically be assumed to be the lower hardness 440A grade. AUS series The AUS stainless steel series is produced by Aichi Steel Corporation of Japan. They differ from the AISI 4xx series because they have vanadium added to them. Vanadium improves the wear resistance, toughness, and ease of sharpening. In the alloy name the appended 'A' indicates the alloy has been annealed. * AUS-6 (6A) is comparable to 440A with a carbon content close to 0.65%. It is a low cost steel, slightly higher wear resistance compared to 420J. * AUS-8 (8A) is comparable to 440B with a carbon content close to 0.75%. AUS-8 is often used instead of 440C. SOG knives uses AUS-8 extensively. * AUS-10 (10A) is comparable to 440C with a carbon content close to 1.10%. It is slightly tougher than 440C. CPM SxxV series The SxxV series are Crucible Industries stainless steels produced using CPM process. * CPM S30V, on the lower end of the SxxV steels, it has a carbon content of 1.45%. However, S30V is still considered to be a superior choice for knife making. CPM S30V is used in a wide range of ZT knives. * CPM S35VN is a martensitic stainless steel designed to offer improved toughness over CPM S30V. It is also easier to machine and polish than CPM S30V. It is used in many high end kitchen knives including those by New West Knifemakers * CPM S60V (formerly CPM T440V) (discontinued), very rich in vanadium. CPM S60V has a carbon content of 2.15%. It was an uncommon steel, but both Spyderco and Kershaw Knives offered knives of this steel, Boker still offers folders made from CPM S60V.Ward, C. (2008), \\"An Edge in the Kitchen\\", Harper Collins, p.33-34, * CPM S90V (formerly CPM T420V) has less chromium than S60V, but has almost twice as much vanadium. S90V's carbon content is also higher, resting around 2.30%. * CPM S110V has higher corrosion resistance than S90V and marginally better wear resistance. The additional corrosion resistance while retaining all the benefits of S90V makes this steel extremely desired for kitchen cutlery. * CPM S125V, online information is not available as of August 2014, contact Crucible Industries sales for information. It contains 3.25% carbon, 14% chromium and 12% Vanadium and other alloying elements. Exceptionally high wear resistance, making it difficult to process and machine for knifemakers. At first only used in custom knives, it has been utilized by larger manufacturers more recently in very limited quantities. ;VG series Japanese stainless steels, manufactured by Takefu Special Steel. * VG-1, Takefu stainless steel. Popular steel in Japanese kitchen knives. * VG-2, middle-carbon Mo stainless blade steel. * VG-5, synergic effect of Mo and V makes carbide finer. * VG-7/VG-8W, strengthens substrate and improves tempering performance. * VG-10(B/W), Takefu stainless steel, similar composition to VG-1 but also contains cobalt and vanadium. Good wear resistance and rust resistance. * San-mai, A composite steel used to make high end knives. The core is VG-1 and the outside layers are 420j for good rust resistance. Due to small Vanadium content VG-10 has finer grain content compared to VG-1. Cobalt and Nickel improve toughness. Overall, it has better edge stability compared to VG-1. VG-10 is widely used in Japanese kitchen knives, several manufacturers use it in various folders and fixed blade knives, including Spyderco, Cold Steel and Fallkniven. ;CTS series American stainless steels produced by Carpenter Technology using vacuum melt technology. * CTS-BD1, high-carbon chromium steel that provides stainless properties with high hardness and excellent wear resistance. * CTS-20(CV), offers superior edge retention and surface finish, an ability to be machined to a fine edge, and consistent heat-treatability from lot to lot. * CTS-BD30P * CTS-40C(CP), a powder metallurgy, high-carbon chromium stainless steel designed to provide stainless properties with maximum hardness. * CTS-TMT, a hardenable martensitic stainless steel that combines improved corrosion resistance over Type 410 stainless with hardness up to 53 HRC and improved formability over 17Cr-4Ni. * CTS-XHP, a powder metallurgy, air-hardening, high carbon, high chromium, corrosion-resistant alloy.

This results in a steel with extreme corrosion resistance, excellent edge holding, yet it is fairly easily resharpened while containing a relatively high carbide volume for abrasive cutting edge retention. *LC200N (aka Z-FiNit) produced by Zapp Precision Metals, is a high nitrogen alloyed tool steel which exhibits superior corrosion resistance combined with high toughness even at hardness up to 60 HRc. Spyderco uses this steel in several of their knives. Carbon steel The Hippekniep is a folding pocket knife made by the Herder knife-making company in Solingen, Germany. The blade is made of non-rustproof carbon steel, blue-plastered by hand and finely forged from the base to the tip of the knife. The long blade shows patina (dark spots) caused by decades of use. It can easily be sharpened to a shaving sharp edge. Carbon steel is a popular choice for rough use knives. Carbon steel used to be much tougher, much more durable, and easier to sharpen than stainless steel. They lack the chromium content of stainless steel, making them susceptible to corrosion. Carbon steels have less carbon than typical stainless steels do, but it is the main alloy element. They are more homogeneous than stainless and other high alloy steels, having carbide only in very small inclusions in the iron. The bulk material is harder than stainless, allowing them to hold a sharper and more acute edge without bending over in contact with hard materials. But they dull by abrasion quicker because they lack hard inclusions to take the friction. This also makes them quicker to sharpen. ;10xx series The 10xx series is the most popular choice for carbon steel used in knives as well as katanas. They can take and keep a very sharp edge. *1095, a popular high-carbon steel for knives; it is harder but more brittle than lower carbon steels such as 1055, 1060, 1070, and 1080. It has a carbon content of 0.90-1.03% Many older pocket knives and kitchen knives were made of 1095. It is still popular with many bushcrafters and survivalists due to its toughness and ease of sharpening.Martin Knives bushcraft knife - Bushcraftliving.com Discussion Forum ‚Ä∫ Cutting Tools, 16 posts - 8 authors - 26 Nov 2008: \\"I used the knife for every camp chore I could think of as well as splitting wood for kindling and carving a spoon and fork.\\"KABAR Knives - Best Glide Aviation Survival Equipment, Discussion Forum \\"KABAR Knives were the official fighting knife of the USMC.

It is a tough steel, that resists both wear and corrosion relatively well. Prior to 2002, INFI contained 0.5% carbon, 0.74% Nitrogen, about 1% Cobalt, and about 0.1% Nickel. In 2002, Busse changed the steel composition by removing Nitrogen, but added 0.63% Silicon for toughness, and the Cobalt and Nickel components were dropped. ;Other carbon steel These steels did not exist in a series. *Shiro-2, Cr and Ni are added for better quenching and ductility. Unassigned steels The group of these steels is unknown at this time.

The usage originates with Richard Bartle's original MUD1 and MUD2. It is frequently abbreviated \\"wiz\\", which is sometimes used as a verb; to wiz is to become a wizard. The plural of \\"wiz\\" is \\"wizzes\\". A wizard's duties may involve various combinations of software development, content generation, gamemastering, community management, and other administrative tasks. Modifications such as apprentice wizard, elder wizard (\\"elder\\") and archwizard (\\"arch\\") indicate junior or senior staff members. Other commonly used terms with the same or related meanings are coder, developer (\\"dev\\"), administrator (\\"admin\\"), immortal (\\"imm\\", \\"immort\\"), God, and implementer (\\"imp\\"); the last two most often refer to the system's owner. The term \\"builder\\" may be used to indicate a wizard, usually junior in standing, dedicated to content development. A common convention, especially on early MUDs, has been that players have the opportunity to become wizards after advancing to a certain level within the game. This practice sometimes presents \\"wizhood\\" as another level of game, with wizards competing to develop popular content. As this is, at best, a questionable approach to staffing and development, its popularity has faded with the MUDs of later years. A \\"wizard\\" in a MUD is not necessarily a staff member; it may be used simply in its ordinary fantasy-genre meaning, referring to in-world magicians. (Being able to employ this usage is sometimes one of the reasons a MUD chooses to use setting-neutral terms like \\"administrator\\" and \\"developer\\" for staff.)

It was succeeded by the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is equally only recognized by the Republic of Turkey.  Politics  The UN General Secretary came to Cyprus on 25‚Äì26 December 1974, and demanded that bilateral talks be initiated between the two communities. After the Temporary Turkish Cypriot Administration was declared on 28 December 1967, the second phase was put into effect unilaterally on 13 February 1975 with the declaration of the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus by the Chairman of the Administration Rauf Denkta≈ü in the Autonomous Turkish Administration Assembly of Cyprus.http://www.cypnet.co.uk/ncyprus/history/republic/1975.html In 1975 the \\"Turkish Federated State of Cyprus\\" was declared as a first step towards a future federated Turkish Cypriot state, but was rejected by the Republic of Cyprus, the UN, and the international community. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 367 stated regret for the declaration, however, it was not regarded as a unilateral declaration of independence and an attempt at breaking away. The Turkish Cypriot leadership, headed by Rauf Denkta≈ü, hoped that the Greek Cypriots would treat them as equals and proceed to proclaim their own federated state. Meanwhile, the transition from an \\"administration\\" to a state enabled Turkish Cypriots to write their own constitution. In the 1976 elections, the National Unity Party of Denkta≈ü received 53.7% of votes and gained the majority in the National Council. This parliament then proceeded with the debating and writing of the constitution. All political parties agreed on a federal solution to the problem with continued guarantee of security by Turkey and the debates were centered on ideological, social and economical grounds, with the opposition parties Republican Turkish Party and Communal Liberation Party advocating a parliamentary system and criticizing the draft constitution due to the powers it gave to the president. After eight years of failed negotiations between the Greek and Cypriot Turkish community, the North declared its independence on November 15, 1983 under the name of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. This unilateral declaration of independence was rejected by the UN and the Republic of Cyprus. For subsequent developments, see Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  Economy  In 1978, the imports of the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus were 2,067,457,000 Turkish Liras, whilst the exports were 758,453,000 Turkish Liras.

The company offers servers in more than 200 cities and countries and operates a privately held and nonprofit think tank institute to develop and improve the data center and cloud computing industry, on the global scale. History In early 2000, in the middle of the dot-com bubble, Lafl√®che Morin started a small communication agency called InexM√©dia out of his garage apartment in Montreal, Canada. The company began offering a wide range of Web related services. In 2004, InexM√©dia change its name to Group e-media.com and start offering managed servers and web hosting under the brand name E serves. When the company began to develop its international managed services and E serves become its primary business, the company was re-formed as CenterServ. In 2009, as the company grew and gained international presence, CenterServ started offering free cloud computing certification to IT professionals and systems administrators, with a particular focus on business ethics and social responsibility for the cloud industry. Those certifications were used for internal purposes and for private corporation objectives. During the certification process, CenterServ signs data center access agreement with each member. This agreement grants CenterServ the access to each member's data center. In exchange CenterServ would give each member an exclusivity service contract for any hosted solution. Additionally, CenterServ would grant them access to virtual offices mostly offered by RegusTM and other international office space companies. It is with these agreements that CenterServ decentralized the data center and cloud computing industry. Each certified responsible systems administrator would be responsible of the CenterServ hosted solution within their own data center. The resulting effects for the data center and cloud industry are higher level of service personalization and unification of data centers all around the globe. By the end of 2014, the company started offering cloud computing franchises. The franchise model would best fit the need of talented entrepreneur to develop their own business under CenterServ brand, mission and objectives. They would managed certified CenterServ members for the best interest of their own customers while upgrading the cloud industry service level.https://www.qsrmagazine.com/reports/10-best-franchise-deals By February 2016, CenterServ has a pool of more than 1500 certified members and IT professional in all fields. CenterServ has access to more than 500 data centers and office space in more than 200 cities and countries. In the future, with both is franchise and certified members network, CenterServ aims to promote innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship and greater accessibility to cloud computing. In 2016, Stephen Willis joined as the COO for CenterServ USA. Business Model CenterServ has two primary lines of business; Cloud Servers and Dedicated Servers offered on a global scale. CenterServ helps design, build, and implement personalized services and offer cloud computing consulting services as part of their service agreements. Social activity Although the founders began as MIS administrator and Finance specialist, they found that most companies were often put off by the cloud industry¬¥s lack of services personalization, by centralized decision making purely motivated by profit and also by a lack of data center services accessibility in most parts of the globe. The founders wanted to turn their venture into a socially responsible company where the cloud industry would benefit from CenterServ activities. By involving each systems administrator, in return to access to their facilities, would allow for a more personalized and backed by a more unify data center international network. In order to stay transparent the company would not bind itself with any particular brand, provider, data center, or government. Meanwhile, to ensure optimal customer service, each contract would need to be signed by a CenterServ certified ethical systems administrator. CenterServ Think tank gives certifications to systems administrators with an ethical and a socially responsible approach. The cloud will play an important role for the future. CenterServ is taking over some of the responsibilities such has unifying data center nodes all around the globe and increasing level of cloud computing service innovation and perfection. The CenterServ Private Institute is also responsible of selecting franchisee primarily based on their respect of CenterServ's mission and core value. Selected candidates are retained mostly based on past experience, education, relations and/or ideas and innovation.http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1160950 CenterServ built its international presence supported by hundreds of systems administrators dispersed all over the globe, allowing for access to most data center facilities Major client contributors in needs of remote geo-location server access help CenterServ unify and normalize the international cloud access and service level.http://www.bizalia.com/venta-de- empresas/58395/centerserv-franquicias-en-la-industria-del-it References Category:Technology companies of Canada ","title":"CenterServ International, Ltd"},{"id":"27013597","text":"Cesco may refer to:  People = Given name  * Cesco Agterberg (born 1975), Dutch soccer coach * Cesco Baseggio (1897‚Äì1971), Italian actor  Surname  * Carlos Ulrrico Cesco (died 1987), Argentine astronomer * Mario R.
