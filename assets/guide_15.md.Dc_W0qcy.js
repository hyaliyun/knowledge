(CUB), a non-profit organization established in 1976, is one of two primary nationwide organizations offering support to the biological parents of adopted people in the United States. The organization is credited with the creation of the term \\"birthparent.\\" History In the 1970s, support groups for mothers and for adoptees began to proliferate. The first groups were sponsored by adoptees' rights organizations, such as the Adoptees' Liberty Movement Association (ALMA), which was founded by adoptee Florence Fisher in 1971. Soon after, in 1976, Concerned United Birthparents (CUB) was founded by surrendering mother Lee Cambell.A. Fessler, The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v. Wade. New York: Penguin Books. 2006; pg. ??? The original mission was \\"to provide support for birthparents who have relinquished a child to adoption; to provide resources to help prevent unnecessary family separations; to educate the public about the life-long impact on all who are touched by adoption; and to advocate for fair and ethical adoption laws, policies, and practices.\\" A 2003 revision of this statement formally extended CUB’s area of emphasis to include \\"all family members separated by adoption rather than birth parents alone.Ellen Herman, \\"Concerned United Birthparents,\\" The Adoption History Project, University of Oregon, pages.uoregon.edu/ \\"CUB grew rapidly in the late 1970s and early 1980s, drawing new members from around the country.\\"Rickie Solinger, Beggers and Choosers: How the Politics of Choice Shapes Adoption, Abortion, and Welfare in the United States.

The group currently has 10 chapters and over 400 members around the United States. CUB is actively interested in search-related issues, and new members may insert free ads in the organization's newsletter. CUB members believe adoption is not always necessary, especially when the birthparent's problem is a temporary one, such as inadequate finances or lack of emotional support. The members can provide assistance to birthparents for whom adoption is not the first choice yet who see no other answer. The organization also works for changes in adoption policy.Christine Adamec and William Pierce, \\"Concerned United Birthparents, Inc. (CUB),\\" Encyclopedia of Adoption. Second Edition. Facts on File, 2000. Origin of the term \\"Birthparents\\" According to adoption historian Ellen Herman, CUB organizer Lee Campbell and her co- founders were the first to coin the term \\"birthmother\\" (and by extension \\"birthparents\\") in an effort to describe the relationship between the biological parents and the child put up for adoption in a new way. The term was introduced as a compromise between \\"natural mother\\" and \\"biological mother.\\" According to Campbell: > \\"We didn't want to upset adoptive parents with ‘natural.’ And ‘biological’ > now made us gag. 'Biological,' we felt, was descriptive of a mechanical > incubator or unfeeling baby machine. 'Birth' was the key. With 'birth > parents' as one word...we were like other one-word progenitors, like > grandparents.\\"Lee Campbell in Solinger, Beggars and Choosers, page > unspecified, quoted in Claud, \\"The Origin of the Word Birthmother,\\" Musings > of the Lame: My Life as a BirthMother and What I Learned Too Late,\\" > www.adoptionbirthmothers.com/ Footnotes External links * Concerned United Birthparents official website * Adoptees' Liberty Movement Association official website * Records of Concerned United Birthparents, Inc., 1946-1999 (inclusive), 1975-1995 (bulk): A Finding Aid.Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. * Additional records of Concerned United Birthparents, Inc., 1974-2013: A Finding Aid.Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University.

History The former Romanesque church from c. 1200 was one of Lolland's oldest brick- built churches. It was owned by the Crown after the Reformation but in 1698 was transferred to the Bådesgård estate which was later owned by Princess Charlotte Amalie. After her death, it was transferred to the State in 1784 until it came into the ownership of local farmers. In 1913, the church gained its independence. The former building was seriously damaged by a fire on 5 April 1895 which broke out in the rectory west of the church. Large sections of the church were relatively unscathed but, despite ministerial recommendations that the surviving elements should be taken into account in the rebuilding, the old structure was demolished on the grounds that a larger building was needed. The new structure, designed by the architect Aage Langeland-Mathiesen (1868–1933), was completed in 1897.Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud Købke Knudsen, \\"Dannemare Kirke\\", Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8, 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 328-339. Retrieved 14 July 2013. Architecture The former red-brick building had consisted of a Romanesque chancel and nave and a Gothic porch. Today's church consists of a chancel, a nave and a tower whose ground floor serves as a porch. Renovation work was undertaken in 1978. On that occasion, the windows were replaced with stained-glass designs by Mogens Jærgensen. Interior Several artifacts were saved from the former church and can now be seen in the new building. The altarpiece in the auricular style from the Baroque period was completed around 1640. At the centre, there is a copy of Carl Bloch's painting of Christ's Resurrection. The font from c. 1650 has a hexagonal bowl and is decorated in the Rococo style. In 1976, it was painted blue, representing baptismal water and the joy of baptism. Also of note is the church clock which originally stood in Jægersborg Mansion. It was designed by Poul Petersen in 1771 and restored in 1897 by Bertram Larsen.

Differences in habit and in the number of ovules were accepted as the basis for this classification. A majority of perennial and annual species from the American continent described by Watson were referred to Lupinus. To the Platycarpos section were attributed some annual species with two ovules in the ovary and two seeds in the pod (L. densiflorus Benth., L. microcarpus Sims. and others). Section Lupinnelus consisted of one species (L. uncialis), with axillary and solitary flowers, scarcely reflexed banner, and also with two ovules in the ovary. Presently, the existence of such species seems doubtful. This principle of classification was extended by Ascherson and Graebner (1907) to cover all lupins from the eastern and western hemispheres. Lupinus L. was for the first time subdivided into two subgenera: A. Eulupinus and B. Platycarpos (Ascherson and Graebner, 1907). Quantity of ovules (seedbuds) in the ovary and seeds in the pod was also accepted as the criterion for this division. Most of the described species from the eastern and western hemispheres were referred to subgen. A. Eulupinus. Subgen. B. Platycarpos included several annual species from the eastern hemisphere with two seedbuds and seeds in the bean (the same species, as the one specified by S. Watson). Subgen. Platycarpos (S.Wats.) Kurl.Species:Kurl. Boguslav Stanislavovich Kurlovich in new combination Subgen. PLATYCARPOS (S.Wats.) Kurl. and Subgen. LUPINUS integrates the numerous perennial and annual species from the Western hemisphere, both groups having two and more ovules or seedbuds in the ovary, while subgen. Lupinus L. includes 12 species from the Mediterranean region and Africa with at least four ovules or seedbuds in the ovary. Subgen. Platycarpos (S.Wats.) Kurl. 1989, Bull. N.I.Vavilov Inst.

The ovary contains two and more ovules or seedbuds. The seed are predominantly small-sized, with an underdeveloped embryo and small amount of endosperm. Cotyledons are small-sized, with long caulicles. The first pair of true leaves is alternate. The stem is predominantly naked with waxen coating. Dominating is the monopodial type of branching. Leaflets are smooth, with waxen coating or slight pubescence, predominantly narrow. Pods are flat or orbicular, with two or more seeds. Represented by frutcuilose, fruticose and herbaceous perennial forms, or less often annual ones. Plants are cross-pollinated. 2n = 36, 48, 96. The type of subgenus: L. densiflorus Benth. Geographic distribution: North, Central and South America, predominantly in the mining systems of the Andes and Cordillera. Some species are cultivated (L. mutabilis Sweet., L. polyphyllus Lindl.).

He was the eldest son of Ayatollah Khomeini and Khadijeh Saqafi, daughter of a respected cleric, Hajj Mirza Tehrani. He graduated from the Qom Theological Center. Activities Khomeini participated in his father's movement. He was arrested and imprisoned after the 1963 events and also, after his father's exile. On 3 January 1965, he joined his father in Bursa, Turkey, where he was in exile. Then he lived with his family in Najaf, Iraq.

Death Khomeini died in Najaf on 23 October 1977. He was buried in Najaf within the shrine of Imam Ali thanks to Musa al-Musawi His death has been regarded as suspicious by both the followers of Ayatollah Khomeini and common people of Iran due to his death being announced while he was in police custody and various reports that SAVAK agents were present at the scene.

Species in this genus infect insects (Coleoptera). Taxonomy This genus was created by Weiser in 1953.Weiser J (1953) Parasites of the flour beetles Tribolium castaneum. Proc Soc Protozool 4:21 The type species is Farinocystis tribolii. Description The species in this genus are spread by the orofaecal route. They infect the larva, pupae and adults of mealworms. The hosts may become black when heavily infected. Eight elongate sporozoites emerge from each oocyst in the midgut of the host. These then migrate to the fat body where they become intracellular. The meronts enlarge, becoming rounded or elongate and acquire up to 200 small nuclei. Elongate or spherical merozoites with one nucleus bud from the surface of the meront or are preformed in the meront and are released upon its rupture. The merozoites may form a new generation or develop into meronts with large nuclei which release uninucleate merozoites upon rupture of the meront. The large nuclei are about double the size of the small nuclei at about 2-4 µm diameter. Pyriform, spindle shaped or ovoid merozoites with large nuclei differentiate into spheroidal gamonts. The gamonts associate in head to head syzygy with the conoidal complexes juxtaposed. The gametocytes are hemispherical. A common wall forms around the juxtaposed gamonts to form a gametocyst. Within this the two gamonts are now known as gametocytes The gametocyst enlarges from 5 to 15 µm in length while the gametocytes undergo nuclear division and the nuclei arrange themselves around the perimeter of the gametocytes except at the interface between the two cells. The peripheral cytoplasm condenses around the nuclei to form 16 isogametes within each gametocyte. The interface between the gametocytes breaks down and the gametes fuse forming as many as 16 zygotes. Each zygote forms 8 lemon shaped oocysts with polar thickenings. The sporozoites are elongate and attached to the poles of the oocyst. The oocyst leaves the host either via the faeces or after the death of the host and its subsequent disintegration.

The Extended Warehouse Management product is an integrated software platform for flexible, automated support for processing goods movements and for managing inventory in the warehouse.SAP Extended Warehouse Management Overview \\"SAP EWM firms the ability to control warehouse processes and manage movements in the warehouse, mitigate problems and issues with enhanced warehouse efficiency, and transform operations into an adaptive fulfillment supply chain that can share its resources\\". SAP EWM is similar to SAP WM functionality, but with more flexibility in building objects like Warehouse structure, picking, put away, HU (handling unit), RF, and more.Understanding SAP EWM in comparison with SAP WM Also, Activity Areas, Work Centers, and Resources are elements incorporated into SAP EWM that are new additions since SAP WM. SAP WM was the company's first foray into a specific Warehouse Management Solution. By 2025 SAP WM will no longer be supported and completely replaced by SAP EWM.Embedded EWM in SAP S/4 HANA… A functional Comparison Like SAP WM, SAP EWM is a part of SAP Supply Chain Management (SAP SCM) and supports all the processes within the logistics chain. The integrated functions and business processes within this warehouse management solution provide a high level of process and inventory transparency, a precise planning of warehouse steps, as well as efficient distribution and storage.SAP EWM – Warehouse Management with SAP Extended Warehouse Management The payback associated with an EWM implementation typically ranges from 12 to 36 months from beneficial use of the system. Achieving a viable return requires leveraging the technology to improve and streamline the operation, not just automate existing, inefficient and archaic processes. Most EWM implementations result in qualitative and quantitative benefits such as fewer product handling steps, increased productivity, reduced errors, tighter inventory control, and improved inventory accuracy and order quality. History The following is an outline of SAP EWM development progression.Understanding SAP Extended Warehouse Management 1993 - First functions for the warehouse logistics were already implemented in the SAP R/2 environment. These functions were partially integrated into SAP R/3. The term \\"Warehouse Management\\" (WM) was used to sum up the warehouse processes as a component of the Materials Management (MM) in release 2.0. 1995 - With the release 3.0, additional integrated functions were implemented in the WM. With the organizational unit Production Supply Area (PSA) and control loops, processes for the product supply are created and the integration to the Production Planning (PP) is established. 1997 - SAP recognizes that a warehouse also features openings to the outside world. With the gate and provision zone in release 4.0, new organizational units are made available that aim to integrate the transport. 1998 - With release 4.5, the Logistics Execution (LE) is reborn as a separate module. From now on, the existing MM component WM and the existing SD components Shipment (SHP) and Transportation (TRA) form a common logistics solution consisting of Warehouse Management (LE-WM), Shipment (LE-SHP) and Transport (LE-TRA). 2000 - While the 4.5 release was marked by consolidation of logistic functions, it obtained important new features in Release 4.6 like block entry into the LES, submodule with radio frequency (RF), and SAP transactions for mobile data acquisition. 2002 – With the release 4.7, the extension set 1.10 is implemented in the LES. Task and Resource Management (TRM) is a very controversial function. It was primarily designed to enable the mapping of multi-stage movements. However, it connects itself below the transfer order logic using the system document \\"Task\\" and unnecessarily creates another system level for the processing of warehouse movements. 2004 – The extension set 2.00 of the release 4.7 contains additional submodules that are connected to the core components of the LES. The submodule \\"Direct Store Delivery Backend\\" supports direct deliveries to the subsidiary branch offices carried out by the manufacturer and is therefore a supplement to the transport component (LE-TRA). 2005 – The release mySAP ERP 2004 provides some additions in the Direct Store Delivery Backend area. 2006 – In 2006, the last noteworthy development in the LES is made available in release ECC 6.0. SAP EWM 5.0 is already in the Ramp-Up process. With the introduction of a new system philosophy, the first release 5.0 is provided with already known and new processes and functions using a completely new system basis and document structure. The organizational units were taken over from SAP LES and supplemented by new organizational units. 2008 – The release SAP EWM 5.1 is another important milestone in the history of SAP warehouse logistics. With the new Material Flow System (MFS) component, the EWM now features a fully integrated material flow calculator and thus significantly stands out in comparison to the old LES. 2009 – In release 7.0, SAP closes the process gap in the production supply existing until then. The Cross Docking process area is supplemented by the opportunistic Cross Docking as well as the Merchandise Distribution Cross Docking. 2010 – The release 7.01 includes expansions regarding the Material Flow System (MFS). On the performance side, the response times of the telegram exchange have been improved. The functions now also cover the requirements related to controlling the container conveyor equipment. 2011 – The release 7.02 reflects the replacement of the old SAP LES. Using migration tools for taking over the master data and processes from the SAP LES as well the Rapid Deployment Solution (RDS), a fast deployment of and conversion to SAP EWM shall be made possible. 2013 – With the release 9.0, SAP combines its three systems Extended Warehouse Management (EWM), Transportation Management (TM) and Event Management (EM), that are most important for the operative logistics, on the common system platform SAP Supply Chain Execution (SCE), thereby offering a lot of potential for optimizing the entire supply chain. Apart from the integration with TM and EM, EWM 9.0 offers a number of new functions. As far as the problem of changing quantities in delivered packagings is concerned, the standard version of EWM 9.0 offers a solution by using stock-specific units of quantity that will significantly facilitate the goods issue processes with different packaging units. 2014 - The released 9.1, on May 2014. 2015 - The released 9.2, on April 2015. 2015 - The released 9.3, on November 2015. 2016 - The released 9.4, on May 2016. 2017 - The released 9.5, on November 2017. SAP includes foremost additional functions in labor management, improvements in retail and e-commerce and the integration of SAP Global Batch Traceability (GBT).

History A dwelling is known to have existed on the site as far back as the year 1000, which passed to the Bedingfeld family around 1400. In 1572 the manor was bought by John Holland, a local Member of Parliament. The present house dates to around 1600 when John's son, Thomas, started building it. The East Wing and West portico were added later by John Bristow. The house remained in the Holland family until around 1800 when it was bought by George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle: it then passed down the Keppel family. It was regularly visited by Edward VII in the early years of the 20th century. In 1948 the house was acquired from the Keppel family by the Carmelites of Rushmere who re-established it as a monastery of Carmelite nuns. In 1989 some cottages on the property, formerly used as staff living accommodation by the Keppel family, were made over to a hospice for sick children now under the management of East Anglia Childrens Hospices, an independent charity under the patronage of the Duchess of Cambridge.

It was designed by architect Bruno Taut, municipal planning head and co-architect Martin Wagner, garden architect Leberecht Migge and Neukölln gardens director Ottokar Wagler. In 1986 the ensemble was placed under German heritage protection. On 7 July 2008 it was inscribed as one of six estates that constitute the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates World Heritage Site.UNESCO. Berlin Modernism Housing Estates. Retrieved 12 January 2019 Central building structure of the \\"Horseshoe\\"  Historical background  At the beginning of the 20th century Berlin was growing dramatically. From 1850 to the end of the 1920s its population had roughly doubled every 25 years. It was not only the cultural heyday of the Golden Twenties which caused a rapid increase in population, but also the advance of industrialisation and the end of the First World War. Groß-Berlin (Greater Berlin), which had only come about in 1920 through the amalgamation of several districts in the city and its suburbs, was doing full justice to its name. At 3.8 million people, the number of inhabitants not only exceeded today's population but also made Berlin the third-largest metropolis in the world at that time after New York and London.  Reformist housing and concepts of urban planning  View from the central staircase after restoration 2013 This enormous influx of people was confronted with a lack of housing. Particularly in working class districts like Neukölln, Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg or Wedding. During the interwar period, housing was built on a large scale by the city of Berlin for broad sections of the population. From 1924 to 1931 alone 140,000 apartments were built. In order to provide an appropriate organizational body for the construction of these estates, housing cooperatives were founded. One of these enterprises, GEHAG (Gemeinnützige Heimstätten-, Spar- und Bau- Aktiengesellschaft), founded in 1924, hired Bruno Taut to act as the chief architect responsible for the construction of the estate. Together with five further building projects, the Horseshoe Estate was inscribed as part of the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates World Heritage Site in 2008. The heritage protected part of the Hufeisensiedlung, which was built between 1925 and 1930, extends over a total of six building sections and an area of around 29 hectares. It consists of 1,285 flats, which are in three-storey buildings aligned with the street, and 679 terraced houses, each with a garden and a small terrace. A further, seventh building section is not part of the World Heritage Site. It is south-east of the junction between Fritz-Reuter-Allee and Parchimer Allee and was built without the involvement of Bruno Taut.  Architectural details and variations  Color variations of doors and entrances - a typical design pattern of Bruno Taut Closely linked to the heart of Berlin, the development combines a unique architectural style with the social ideal of a terraced garden home for everyone. Hufeisen is the German term for horseshoe, which describes the shape of the curved 350-meter long structure which gave name to the project. It consists of 25 housing units joined together around a pond that dates back to the ice age. The central building structure is surrounded by townhouses and embedded in a suburb that feels urban and rural at the same time. The facades of the terraced houses are painted in dark red, yellow ochre and - especially at the end of a terraced row – in deep blue or gleaming white. Doors and windows and individual building elements of the blocks of flats like loggias, stairwells or low- ceilinged attic floors are painted to contrast clearly with the facades. The front and rear sections are often designed in separate colour combinations. Further contrasts in material and colour are created by the use of bright red and yellow clinker bricks in the area of the chimneys, the entrances and the base of the walls. Perhaps the most striking design feature is the construction and colour of the entrance doors.  Basic facilities, interior design and special offers  Authentic interior design and coloring of the private accommodation \\"Tautes Heim“ The houses and flats of the Horseshoe Estate were left unfurnished. All residential units had a bathroom and kitchen as well as a separate bedroom. This standard was revolutionary at the time and meant that the estate was very desirable amongst the people of Berlin. However, the technical facilities were not comparable to the standards of today. Only a few houses in the sixth section had central heating. Instead, coal ovens with glazed tiles in attractive colours were installed in every living room and bedroom. In the kitchen there was a sink, a gas cooker with two burners, a larder beneath the window and in the corner of the kitchen or to one side of the loggia a built-in cupboard. There were coal-fired water heaters in the bathrooms, a toilet and a bathtub. Today most of these original parts of the interior facilities are gone. Like so many architects, Bruno Taut did not want the rooms with their carefully chosen colours to be covered up or cluttered by inappropriate furnishings. He wanted the residents of his buildings to dispense with pictures, paraphernalia and things that just gather dust. But instead of wanting to convert the residents to the Bauhaus-type tubular steel furniture which was very up-and-coming at the time, he made suggestions about how typical furnishings could be improved by simplifying and removing things. Nevertheless, the expression “to taut one’s flat” soon become a byword amongst fashion-conscious people and, in a rather imprecise way, it combined both these approaches to interior design.  Planners  The Horseshoe Estate is strongly associated with Bruno Taut (1880–1938). Taut was not only the chief architect of the Horseshoe Estate, but also acted as the chief architect of the public utility housing enterprise GEHAG, was part of the Deutscher Werkbund and had an influence on the architecture of the Neues Bauen movement in Berlin. Four out of six estates that gained the UNESCO World Heritage site were developed under his leadership. Bruno Taut was accompanied by Martin Wagner (1885–1957), who acted as a political organiser and networker and is regarded as a key figure in the construction of Berlin's housing estates. He initiated the founding of GEHAG (a non-profit building society and housing cooperative), was a co-founder of the Deutsche Bauhütte and the director of various professional associations. Initially responsible as the second architect for the Stavenhagener Straße section of the Horseshoe Estate, Martin Wagner was appointed in 1926 to the position of city planning director of Greater Berlin, which had been created in 1920. Taut and Wagner were supported by Leberecht Migge (1881–1935), a freelance landscape architect who was a proponent of social and nature-oriented garden design and who drew the first designs for the green and open spaces of the Horseshoe Estate. However, only some of these designs were implemented by Ottokar Wagler, the director of the parks and gardens department in the district of Berlin-Neukölln.  Maintenance  Like most of the other Berlin estates the Horseshoe Estate survived the Second World War relatively undamaged. In the post-war period parts of the plasterwork and the colours were lost and at first they were incorrectly restored. The authorities for the conservation of historic buildings reacted and commissioned expert reports, which were then to serve as the basis for proper maintenance work – a process which continues up to now and that is backed up by a program Nationale Welterbestätten initiated by the Germany Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development. The Berlin estates' relatively good condition has a lot to do with the clear ownership structure which existed until the late 1990s. This structure ensured that renovation work was commissioned by one body and often on a large scale. This situation changed when GEHAG was privatised by the Senate in 1998 and when subsequently the 679 terraced houses in the Horseshoe Estate, which up until then had been exclusively let to tenants, were sold off to private individual buyers, so that the conservation of this monument as a homogeneous ensemble is now additionally in the hands of several hundred individual owners.

History  Warsaw Vodka Factory \\"Koneser\\", originally Spirit Distillation Plant (Polish: Fabryka Oczyszczania Spirytusu), was established in 1897 on the initiative of the Polish-Russian Warsaw Society of Distillation and Sale of Spirits. In those days, on the premises of the factory, apart from industrial buildings, the factory complex included warehouses, workshops, residential buildings and a school. At the time the factory was one of the most technologically advanced production plants in Warsaw. The interwar period was the prime of the factory, which at that time was also referred to as the Monopoly. The factory employed more than 400 people, and its production capacity totalled at quarter of a million bottles of vodka a day. In the 1920s \\"Koneser\\" created universally recognizable vodka brands such as: Wyborowa, Luksusowa, Żubrówka, Żytniówka and Siwucha. The further development of the plant was disrupted by the outbreak of World War II. As a result, the production was significantly reduced and subsequently stopped.J.Zieliński: Koneser, Ząbkowska i okolice Warszawa 2012, s. 47-59 In the late 1940s, after World War II and necessary revitalization of the factory, the production was resumed and it continued up to the last decade, when the worsening condition of the company led to the end of production and shutdown of the factory.www.gazeta.pl Trzewia fabryki wódek: spacerownik po Koneserze/Kordegarda i dom administracji 8 August 2013.

It ran continuously from 1876 to 1984. The most important town on the former line was Beverungen.  Route  Fürstenberg Weser bridge near track km 322.0 Track km 326.7 in August 2011 The line ran from the northeast to the southwest through the Weser Uplands. It crossed the Weser at Fürstenberg. In Wehrden it connected with the Solling Railway (but only towards Northeim), which it crossed just after Wehrden station. The line ran through Beverungen, from where it climbed up the valley of the Bever and through the Warburger Börde (the rolling country around Warburg). In Nörde the line passed under the Hamm–Warburg railway. The line reached the Upper Ruhr Valley Railway in Scherfede, which is in the valley of the Diemel.  History  The route was developed by the Bergisch-Märkische Railway Company (Bergisch-Märkische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft, BME) to connect the Upper Ruhr Valley Railway to the east independent of the Prussian state railways. This provided a link to Holzminden, because from there it could connect to the network of the former Duchy of Brunswick State Railway via Kreiensen, Salzgitter-Ringelsheim and Jerxheim either to the Magdeburg–Thale railway of the Magdeburg–Halberstadt Railway Company (Magdeburg-Halberstädter Eisenbahngesellschaft, MHE) in Oschersleben or to the Brunswick–Magdeburg railway of the Berlin-Potsdam Railway Company (Berlin-Potsdamer Eisenbahn, BPE) in Schoningen. The line would be used by coal trains and express passenger trains. Local issues played no role in the choice of route. In the Warburger Börde, it bypassed the larger resorts such as Borgentreich and Warburg. The Duchy of Brunswick had privatised its former state railways in 1870 and the BME and the BPE had acquired shares. Even before the completion of the Upper Ruhr Valley Railway in 1873, construction work began in 1872 to close the last gap in a private rail network from the Rhine to the Spree. The first traffic ran over it on 15 October 1876. At the end of 1876, a pair expresses ran between Berlin and Aachen. A year later, a luxury train ran to Paris and Ostend. Meanwhile, support for a state railway prevailed in Prussia from 1879/80 and the lines of the BME were incorporated into the Prussian state railways in 1882. The Holzminden-Scherfede line was just a bit inconveniently near main lines, connected two steep lines and lay obliquely to the direction of the main traffic flows. The line bypassed Höxter and Warburg and was thus unsuitable for regional traffic. The long-distance trains ran over the line through Altenbeken. It was not until 1900, when traffic had grown substantially, that a pair of Durchgangszug (D-Zug, “corridor express train”) was established between Berlin and Cologne. The line was duplicated in 1907. A connecting curve was built in Nörde that allowed trains to be diverted by the Holzminden–Nörde–Altenbeken (–Soest route). After the Second World War, the section from Holzminden to Wehrden had a final period of prosperity as the Weser bridge on the Altenbeken–Kreiensen railway at Corvey had been destroyed. A connecting curve (Engländerkurve, literally \\"Englishman curve\\") was built northwest of Wehrden that allowed operations from Holzminden to Altenbeken over the Fürstenberg bridge. From 1954, this was no longer necessary. The line declined to become a regional line, although until the end it was used by a D-Zug operated on the Aachen–Holzminden–Braunschweig route. It was frequently used until the early 1990s for the transfer of vehicles and tanks of the NATO forces. The British Army of the Rhine was responsible for the maintenance of the Fürstenberg bridge. Passenger traffic ended on 2 June 1984. Freight traffic was discontinued in sections from 1984 to 2001: between Beverungen and Borgholz on 30 May 1984; between Fürstenberg and Beverungen on 31 May 1988; between Holzminden and Furstenberg and between Borgholz and Nörde on 31 May 1992 and between Nörde and Scherfede on 10 June 2001.  Current situation  Demolished Dalhausen-Biesberg station. The tracks have been removed and to the right is a temporary track to district road 44, which is about 10 metres away, for heavy demolition equipment. The platform is still recognisable. The railway line is now largely in place, but except in Scherfede it is no longer connected to the other lines and is impassable. The Bahnflächenentwicklungsgesellschaft (“railway land development company”) NRW (BEG), a joint venture of North Rhine-Westphalia and Deutsche Bahn plans, however, the partial removal of the disused line and its conversion into a cycle path. Planned sections cover a total of 22.3 km of the former line: *Project Höxter: a new municipal cycle path between Lüchtringen and Godelheim: 3.1 km for €611,000. The municipality of Höxter has been hesitant to support the state project because the municipality would be obliged to co-finance it and the Weser cycle path already runs nearby. It would primarily benefit the Höxter district of Lüchtringen and the town of Boffzen in Lower Saxony. The route would also have its own bridge over the Weser to allow cyclists to cross between Fürstenberg and Godelheim. *Project Beverungen: the section between Blankenau and Dalhausen covers 11.2 km and would be developed for approximately €1.89 million. * Project Borgentreich: in the town of Borgentreich at Natzungen and Borgholz, 9.1 kilometers of tracks are to be lifted and the route would be paved for cyclists. The estimated cost amounts to €1.4 million. The towns of Warburg (the Rimbeck–Nörde section) and Willebadessen (the Eissen section) have applied for a share of the state program only once for financial reasons.

Although the saloon/sedan version of the Renault Juvaquatre was phased out in the early 1950s, the estate version, badged as the Renault Dauphinoise, continued in production at Vilvoorde till 1960. The first postwar design to be assembled at Vilvoorde was the Renault Dauphine. Ramblers were assembled at Vilvoorde between 1962 and 1971. Vilvoorde assembled the Renault 6 between 1968 and 1980. Renault Industrie Belgique S.A. / Renault Industrie België N.V.,Due to the bilingual character of Brussels, French and Dutch language names both appear regularly in sources. officially shortened with the acronym RIB, opened in 1931 as an auto-assembly plant owned and operated by Renault in Vilvoorde on the northern edge of Brussels in Belgium. It was the manufacturer's first plant to be located outside France. Automobile production at Vilvoorde came to an abrupt end in 1997, with the loss of approximately 3,500 jobs, and in the face of much public opposition from and on behalf of those affected. History =Origins= Production began in 1931, the plant’s first year of operation, although at this stage only a few thousand cars per year were made. The models in question were the manufacturer's Monaquatre and Primaquatre. The plant's first volume model, introduced in the late 1930s and still assembled at Vilvoorde until 1955, was the Renault Juvaquatre, which competed in a hotly contested market segment against cars such as the Peugeot 202 and the Opel Kadett. Production of the estate version of the Juvaquatre, badged as the Renault Dauphinoise, continued until 1960. In the meantime a second volume model, the new rear engine Renault Dauphine was added to the lines. By 1960, Vilvoorde had become very much more than an assembly operation, producing its own axle components, exhaust systems and body panels. =Boom years= At the start of the 1960s the old Dauphinoise was finally taken out of production, to be replaced on the Belgian production line by the much more modern Renault R4 (later rebranded as the Renault 4). In 1962, Renault installed a third production line which was used to assemble the Rambler-Renault Classic. This arrangement was one of a huge campaign lead by the international marketing manager of American Motors (AMC), Roy D. Chapin Jr. during the 1960s to expand AMC's international operations. (This arrangement would have lasting consequences decades later when AMC was ultimately acquired by Renault in the late 1970s.) In 1967, the Classic was replaced at the Vilvoorde plant with the Rambler-Renault Rebel. In volume terms, however, the Renault designed models outnumbered the Rambler designs, with overall production in the late 1960s, running at around 100,000 cars annually. By that time, the Dauphine had been taken out of production, to be replaced on the Vilvoorde lines with the Renault 6. 1967 was the last year of Rambler production and the Rambler line at the factory was repurposed for production of the Renault R12. The 1973 oil crisis triggered large fuel price rises which gave Renault, with a range of relatively small and economical cars, an enormous competitive advantage. The Renault 12 remained in production until 1976, to be replaced in the Belgian assembled range by the Renault 14. During the 1980s output was dominated by smaller models, including the Renault 5 Turbo. A mid-sized model returned to Vilvoorde in 1986 with the arrival of the Renault 21. Other models produced at Renault’s Belgian plant in the 1990s included the small Clio and the compact Mégane models. =The end of auto- assembly at Vilvoorde and the loi Renault= The ending of auto-assembly at Vilvoorde in 1997 caused the loss of around 3,500 jobs, along with strikes, street protests and political disputes. Adverse publicity included a 1999 film by Jan Bucquoy entitled “Fermeture de l'usine Renault à Vilvoorde” (Closure of the Renault factory at Vilvoorde). In this fictional work Renault chairman Louis Schweitzer, who had taken a high-profile role in the plant closure, is kidnapped for purposes of blackmail, and later murdered. In real life Schweitzer remained unkidnapped and at the helm of Renault till 2005: he is still alive in 2018 Schweitzer in the press during 2018, definitely still alive. The action led to a law being enacted in 1998 known as the loi Renault, dealing with necessary consultation procedures on mass redundancies. As a consequence, the term Procédure Renault is now in common usage by the Belgian media as a synonym for \\"redundancy consultation\\" or similar terms.See Procédure Renault for examples of usage Following the high-profile end to auto-production, the plant was modernised and is again functioning, but only for the production of car-components. Approximately 500 workers are employed in 2013. Identification number Cars produced at the Renault Vilvoorde plant can be identified from the Vehicle Identification Number, in which the eleventh position on the Vilvoorde cars is taken by the letter “H”.

He served as a biblical scholar on both the Book of Wisdom and the Book of Isaiah and served as a professor of theological studies prior to World War II where he worked to aid Jewish people and to shield them from the Nazi Holocaust. But the priest was arrested in 1944 and moved from prison to prison before being imprisoned at the Dachau concentration camp where he befriended Josef Beran and Carlo Manziana. The beatification for the late priest was celebrated on 26 April 2014 in the Alba Cathedral after Pope Francis confirmed the Dominican had died \\"in odium fidei\\" or \\"in hatred of the faith\\"; Cardinal Severino Poletto celebrated the solemn Mass on the pope's behalf. Life Giuseppe Girotti was born on 19 July 1905 in Alba in the Province of Cuneo as the eldest of three children to Celso Girotti (1875–???) and Martina Proetto; his siblings that followed him were Giovanni and Michele. Girotti was baptized on 30 July. He began his studies in October 1911 and from 1911 to 1913 was under the ward of the teacher Ferrio. He received both his First Communion and Confirmation on 9 May 1912 from Bishop Giuseppe Re. In the summer of 1918 he witnessed a priest of the Order of Preachers give a sermon in the Alba Cathedral and Girotti became enthralled to the point where he set his heart on becoming a priest himself. He approached the priest and expressed his desire to join; the priest convinced and encouraged him to follow this call as one from God. He began his studies for the priesthood in Chieri at a Dominican convent when he entered on 5 January 1919 and remained there for his education until 1922. On 26 September 1922 he was dispatched to the Santa Maria della Querica convent in Viterbo to continue his studies but spent a brief period of time in Fiesole. It was on 30 September 1922 that he was vested in the order's signature white habit. On 15 October 1923 he made his profession into his order at Viterbo. Girotti received his ordination to the priesthood on 3 August 1930 in Chieri from the Bishop of Vigevano Giacinto Scapardini and he – after ordination – studied Sacred Scripture at the Saint Thomas Aquinas college in Rome and at the École Biblique in Jerusalem under the guidance of the Marie-Joseph Lagrange. In June 1942 he published his scholar's work on the Book of Isaiah after having issued one on the Book of Wisdom back in 1938. In 1934 he had also published his academic work entitled \\"Prolita in Sacra Scriptura\\". He worked as a professor at theological studies at the Saint Maria della Rose convent of his order in Turin but liked to often aid the old at a hospice not too far form his convent; one of his students was Father Giacinto Bosco. His time at the convent drew to a close in 1938 for he was removed from his teaching duties and instead moved to the San Domenico convent in Turin. He became an opponent of the Italian Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. Following the Nazi occupation of the Italian nation in 1943 he saved Jewish people from the brutal Nazi Holocaust through the arrangement of safe hideouts and escape routes from the nation as well as false identification papers. He often called the Jews the \\"Carriers of the Word of God\\" and the \\"Elder brothers\\". His time in Jerusalem allowed him to strengthen interfaith ties with Judaism and their culture which served invaluable for him and his mission. Girotti also aided Emma De Benedetti and her parents for the latter knew Girotti before the war since her parents lived near Girotti in Alba. The Dominican priest helped Emma and her mother find refuge for several months in a Turin convent and also provided false identification papers to her father. He also aided the barrister Salvatore Fubini from Turin. But he was caught in the act of assisting a wounded Jewish partisan to the home of Professor Joseph Diena and so was arrested on 29 August 1944; someone disguised themselves needing his help and was taken to Villa Cavorette where the priest had hid Diena. This individual reported Girotti to the Nazi authorities and he was arrested and first taken to the Le Nuove prison in Turin where his Prior failed to secure his release. Girotti was moved the San Vittore prison in Milan before being moved to the camp of Gries in Bolzano on 21 September 1944 and there met the priest Angelo Dalmasso. He was then sent to the Dachau concentration camp on the raining night of 9 October 1944 and branded with the inmate number 113355. Girotti was imprisoned in Cabin 26 with a thousand other priests in a space that had been designed for 180 inmates and it was there that he became close friends with Josef Beran and Carlo Manziana. On 1 March 1945 he started to suffer from rheumatic pain and swelling in his legs but this grew worse two weeks later for the swelling extended to his entire right side. Girotti was taken to a medical center in the prison for evaluation and was diagnosed with probable carcinoma. From 23 March to 1 April he remained in the medical center and on Easter – 1 April – he was \\"probably\\" killed with a lethal injection of gasoline. His remains were buried in a mass grave three kilometers from the camp. An inmate wrote on the bunk that Girotti had occupied, saying: \\"Here slept Saint Giuseppe Girotti\\". =Yad Vashem recognition= On 14 February 1995 the Yad Vashem organization declared the late priest to be Righteous Among the Nations. A tree was planted in his honor in Jerusalem along the Avenue of the Righteous. Beatification The beatification process commenced in a diocesan process that Cardinal Anastasio Ballestrero inaugurated in Turin on 20 March 1988 while it later closed under Giovanni Saldarini on 20 January 1990; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints later validated this process on 12 February 1994. The formal introduction to the cause came under Pope John Paul II on 13 January 1989 and Girotti became titled as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. received the official Positio dossier from the postulation in 2003 for assessment. Theologians asserted their belief that Girotti was killed for his faith on 20 January 2012 while the C.C.S. also came to the same conclusion on 5 February 2013; Pope Francis confirmed on 27 March 2013 that Girotti was killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (\\"in hatred of the faith\\") and thus confirmed the priest's impending beatification.

The event, known as the Outrages at Jaffa, tested American colonial resolve in the region, as well as the ability of the U.S. Government to protect its citizens in the region. Background The beginnings of U.S. presence in the Levant started in 1844, with the appointment of Warder Cresson as Consul at Jerusalem, though by the time he reached the Holy Land, his appointment had been rescinded. In 1855, American Clorinda S. Minor established the Mount Hope Colony near Jaffa. These colonists were motivated by the belief that a prerequisite for the Second Coming of the Messiah was the establishment of Jewish rule in the Holy Land.http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/the-mountain-of- despair-1.273560 The American Christians were joined by German colonists as well. Two of the families - the American Dicksons and the Prussian Steinbecks - were related by marriage. After Clorinda Minor's death, some of the community abandoned the colony. The colonists were continually harassed by the Bedouin and Arab population and suffered from outbreaks of malaria. Night of the Attack On January 11, 1858, at about 10:00pm, the Dickson homestead was approached by three men, searching for a stray cow. Walter Dickson and his son-in-law, Frederick Steinbeck, informed the men that the cow was not on their property. Within an hour, the men had returned demanding to be let onto the premises, bringing with them an additional 2 men. Walter Dickson fired a warning shot, and retired to bed. Within minutes, the Dickson's dogs were barking in alarm. The gate to the homestead had been broken down. Frederick and Walter approached the men, Frederick addressing them in Arabic. One of the men shot Frederick, and Walter and Frederick retreated into the home, barricading the entrance. The men pried the door up from the bottom, breaking in, beat Walter Dickson into submission, and began to plunder the home. Frederick Steinbeck, suffering of his gunshot wounds, remained immobile, and shortly died from his wounds. Mrs. Mary Steinbeck - Walter Dickson's daughter - caught hold of her father as the men tried to drag her away. They beat her into submission with their guns and four men took her out into the yard, raping her in turn. Mrs. Sarah Dickson was taken into another room and raped. It was near daylight before the men departed. Also present in the home were Mary Steinbeck's two children and 11-year-old Caroline Dickson, daughter of Walter and Sarah Dickson. Aftermath After learning of the attack, American Consul John Warren Gorham met with the Prussian Consul at Jerusalem, Georg Rosen, and they approached the Pasha of Jerusalem about the incident, recruiting him in pressuring the local authorities in Jaffa to seek justice against the perpetrators. Copycat attacks upon Americans elsewhere in Ottoman Syria were reported shortly after the incident. For the next month, J. Warren Gorham; shuttled between Ottoman authorities, trying to attain justice for the Dickson family; ensure the criminals were caught and prosecuted; performed general damage control to the perception of American strength and influence in the region; and attempted to ensure other Americans in the region of their safety. The incident reached the desk of Mehmed Emin Aali Pasha, the Foreign Minister of the Ottoman Empire. Of note is Gorham's mention of perceived indifference, apathy, and laziness of the local authorities to the event, and their ignorance of U.S. power and influence. Edwin de Leon, U.S. Consul General to Egypt, worked in tandem with Gorham to force Ottoman officials to bring the criminals to justice. He perceived that in the region might makes right and recorded that even threats of use of a \\"squadron\\" were employed to convince the local authorities to take action. He had also urged that an American warship be dispatched to the coast. After two and a half months, five men were arrested, the U.S. demanding their execution. The trial was held in Beirut, but soon halted due to uncertainty over the guilt of some of the arrested men. After an inquiry in Jaffa, three of them were released and others arrested. In September 1858, four men were found guilty of murder in the second degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. The fifth man, who had actually fired the shot that killed Frederick Steinbeck, was never apprehended. In popular culture Dickson's Palestine Museum Upon his return to the United States, Henry Dickson - the son of Walter Dickson - created an exhibit where he lectured on his experiences in the Holy Land, and displayed various items he brought back with him. He gave his lectures dressed in Arab garb, and spoke on various topics including local customs, food, animal life, daily life, the treatment of women, and the suffering his family experienced. Clarel: A Poem and Pilgrimage in the Holy Land Herman Melville visited the Levant in 1857. While he was there, he spent time at the Dickson homestead. Melville used the experience of the Dicksons as the model for a character's death in Clarel. East of Eden Mary Dickson was the great aunt of famous American novelist, John Steinbeck. Steinbeck was pained when he discovered what his family had suffered in the Outrages, and hinted to it in his novel East of Eden. While on a trip to Israel in 1966, Steinbeck visited the site near Jaffa where the Dicksons and Steinbecks had lived.

The trajectory is described using a histogram of the directions between each two consecutive points. Given a trajectory T = {P1, P2, P3, ..., Pn}, where Pt is the 2D position at time t. For each pair of positions Pt and Pt+1, calculate the direction angle θ(t, t+1). Value of θ is between 0 and 360. A histogram of the quantized values of θ is created. If the histogram is of 8 bins, the first bin represents all θs between 0 and 45. The histogram accumulates the lengths of the consecutive moves. For each θ, a specific histogram bin is determined. The length of the line between Pt and Pt+1 is then added to the specific histogram bin. To show the intuition behind the descriptor, consider the action of waving hands. At the end of the action, the hand falls down. When describing this down movement, the descriptor does not care about the position from which the hand started to fall. This fall will affect the histogram with the appropriate angles and lengths, regardless of the position where the hand started to fall. HOD records for each moving point: how much it moves in each range of directions. HOD has a clear physical interpretation. It proposes that, a simple way to describe the motion of an object, is to indicate how much distance it moves in each direction. If the movement in all directions are saved accurately, the movement can be repeated from the initial position to the final destination regardless of the displacements order. However, the temporal information will be lost, as the order of movements is not stored- this is what we solve by applying the temporal pyramid, as shown in section \\\\ref{sec:temp-pyramid}. If the angles quantization range is small, classifiers that use the descriptor will overfit. Generalization needs some slack in directions-which can be done by increasing the quantization range.

Species in this genus infect insects (Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Siphonaptera). Taxonomy The genus was created in 1930 by Naville. There are eight recognised species in this genus. The type species is Mattesia geminata. Description The species in this genus are spread by the orofaecal route. They infect the fat bodies of species of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Siphonaptera, the hypodermis of species of Hymenoptera and the Malpighian tubules of species of Lepidoptera and Siphonaptera as well as intestine of one species of Lepidoptera. The sporozoites are elongated and measure ~. They escape from oocyst while in gut lumen when polar plugs dissolve. Flexing by the sporozoites generates motility. This permits them to penetrate the gut wall and migrate to the body fat where they enter cells of the adipose tissue. An apical complex appears to be present in sporozoites, merozoites and gamonts. The meronts are found in a parasitophorous vacuole where they initially undergo micronuclear merogony by budding from the surface of the meront. The resulting merozoites spread the infection in the body fat, followed by macronuclear merogony. The macronuclear merozoites differentiate into gamonts. The micronuclei are smaller than the macronuclei by a factor of about 2-3 with the microgametes 1-2 μm in diameter and the macrogametes being 2-4 μm. Pairs of gamonts associate as two hemispherical gametocytes with the conoidal complexes of each juxtaposed. The complexes then disappear. The host tissue has usually been lysed by the time of gametocyte formation so that the cells are extracellular among host cell debris in spaces within the lysed tissue. Several nuclear divisions involving meiosis, occur to form 4 isogametes within a gametocyst wall. This followed by pairing and copulation. Residual or somatic nuclei in 1 or 2 residual bodies later degenerate. The two zygotes each form a delimiting wall becoming oocysts. The oocysts are usually lemon shaped with polar plugs. Four or eight sporozoites are formed internally after 2 or 3 nuclear divisions respectively. Host records *M. alphitobii — lesser mealworm (Alphitobius diaperinus) *M. dispora — Indianmeal moth (Plodia interpunctella) *M. geminata — fire ant (Solenopsis geminata) *M. grandis — boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis) *M. orchopiae — flea (Orchopeas wickhami) *M. oryzaephili — sawtoothed grain beetle (Oryzaephilus surinamensis) *M. povolnyi — Eurasian sunflower moth (Homoeosoma nebulellum) *M. trogodermae — Glabrous cabinet beetle (Trogoderma glabrum) Notes This genus is a synonym of Coelogregarina Ghélélovitch, 1948.

It enables them to decide which locations to visit or to avoid based on previous experience and knowledge of the current time of day. TPL presumably allows animals to maximize their chances of finding resources (food, mates) and avoiding predators, increasing survival chances. TPL requires spatial memory and a sense of time. The latter may be based on external time-cues (Zeitgebers), or internally generated circadian rhythms (\\"biological clock\\"). TPL may fundamentally underlie episodic memory. Insects The first evidence for time-place learning in animals came from studies in the 1930s on honeybees, which could be trained to visit two different feeders, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon. Subsequent work in the 1980s showed that only a few individuals in the colony were able to learn that task, and did so with more precision for the morning than for the afternoon feeding. Honeybees can also be trained to recognize one visual pattern to obtain food in the morning, and another pattern to get food in the afternoon; when presented with both patterns simultaneously, the same bees choose the \\"morning\\" pattern in the morning and the \\"afternoon\\" pattern in the afternoon. The Neotropical ant Ectatomma ruidum is also capable of time-place learning. They can learn to visit a feeding site in the morning, another one at midday, and a third one in the afternoon. They follow this spatio-temporal pattern even when food is withheld on test days. They then stay at the feeder for the approximate duration that food was normally available before moving on, at the right time, to the next feeder. This shows that the ants do not rely on direct cues from the food itself, but use instead a learned association between daily time and place. Fish In fish, time- place learning has been demonstrated in the golden shiner and the inanga. Golden shiners could be taught to seek food in one half of their aquarium in the morning, in the other half at midday, and back to the first half in the afternoon. They maintained this spatio-temporal pattern even when food was withheld on test days. The spatio-temporal pattern also shifted gradually over several days when the day-night cycle was suddenly shifted early by 6 h, as is typical of circadian rhythms. Inangas could be taught to seek food in one half of their aquarium in the morning and in the other half in the afternoon, even on test days when food was withheld. However, they could not be taught to avoid one half in the morning and the other half in the afternoon in response to simulated attacks by a heron. A test of time-place learning with young convict cichlids yielded negative results, for two as well as four time-place associations per day. This was attributed to a low cost of travel between the aquarium corners in which the food was delivered, such that fish could quickly sample all corners sequentially without having to learn which exact corner gave food. Birds In birds, time-place learning has been confirmed in garden warblers, starlings, weavers, and pigeons. Garden warblers could learn to visit four rooms inside a large aviary, one during each quarter of a day. It took them only 11 days to learn, with 70% accuracy, to visit the correct room at the correct daily time to get food. The spatio-temporal pattern of visits was then maintained even when food was made available in all rooms at all times. As with circadian rhythms of activity, the spatio-temporal pattern of room visits shifted gradually over several days following a 6-h advance of the day-night cycle, and it ran freely with a non-24 h periodicity for up to 6 days when the birds were placed under constant 24-h dim light and constant food availability. Starlings can show similar patterns, with free-runs up to 11 days in constant dim light. The insectivorous weaver bird Ploceus bicolor can also learn to associate four feeding rooms with four feeding times, and it maintains the correct spatio-temporal pattern even when one of the rooms is blocked on test days (the bird then waits for the next feeding time and visits the appropriate room for that time); however, room blocking disrupts the spatio-temporal pattern in the granivorous weaver bird Euplectes hordaceus, which suggests that time-place learning may be stronger in species for which food in nature is more likely to vary spatio-temporally (as is the case for insects, as opposed to grain). Finally, pigeons can learn to peck one key to get food in the morning, and another key in the afternoon, and they maintain this pattern for four days in constant light. Mammals Laboratory rats have been taught to enter one arm of a maze in the morning and another in the afternoon, though only 63% of the animals could attain the criterion of nine correct choices over ten consecutive trials. In a protocol not based on food acquisition, rats swimming in a tank could learn the location of one resting platform in the morning, and another in the afternoon. However, other studies have failed to find evidence of time-place learning in rats. Outcomes of time- place tests with rats seem to depend on what behaviors are measured to assess learning, and on the (sometimes too low) costs of not performing well. Faced with a choice of entering one of three arms at three different times of day, laboratory mice can learn which arm to enter at the correct time, be it to obtain food (a positive reinforcement) or to avoid receiving a mild electric shock (a negative reinforcement).

She was the president of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. Early years Morley was born on 20 February 1899 in Halifax, Yorkshire. She was the eldest daughter of Samuel Edwin Morley and Helen Ann Monk (née Fletcher). Morley attended high schools in Halifax and Monkseaton and went on to read physics and biology at Armstrong College, a college of Durham University located in Newcastle upon Tyne. In 1920 she graduated with a BSc and a certificate of education. She taught physics at the Church High School in Newcastle for ten years before taking up a teaching post in India. Whilst working in India, Morley contracted dysentery and upon her return to England she was advised that she was no longer strong enough for work in the classroom. Speech and language therapy In 1932, after working as a secretary due to her forced change of career, Morley responded to an advertisement placed by William Wardell, a plastic surgeon located in Newcastle upon Tyne. Wardell had developed a new type of pharyngoplasty for children with cleft palate and wanted an \\"educated woman\\" to assess the speech skills of the children before and after surgery, to help determine the effectiveness of the operation. Through this work, Morley began specialising as a speech therapist working with cleft palate patients. She subsequently trained formally as a speech therapist by working with colleagues in Liverpool and London in hospitals and school clinics. In 1938 she gained the diploma of the British Society of Speech Therapists. Morley was appointed as a therapist at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne. Whilst working for two sessions a week, she spent time preparing a thesis on cleft palate, which later became the basis for her book Cleft Palate and Speech, passed in April 1939. It is around this time that she also gained membership of the British Society of Speech Therapists; its members were admitted to the College of Speech Therapists founded in 1945. Morley's book gave thorough descriptions of the anatomy of cleft palate, surgery, associated speech problems and practical suggestions for treatment. It became a source of standard work in this field when published in 1945. Between 1940 and 1945 people were becoming increasingly aware of speech therapy and the profession gained more recognition. By 1945 Morley had set up Newcastle's hospital speech therapy service and was now working full-time as a therapist in three different hospitals. Her treatment covered a variety of speech, language and communication disorders including aphasic ex-servicemen suffering from head injuries sustained in World War II. As Morley's practice expanded, she was obliged to involve parents in the treatment of their child's speech and language disorder to manager her bulging caseload. However, soon she recognised the benefits of this and became an exponent of parental involvement in speech therapy. Research One of her major studies, with colleagues in Child Health, Neurology and Statistics was conducted between 1950 and 1953. During this time, Morley's department researched into the normal and abnormal development of speech in a group of over 1000 children at ages 2,4,6 and 15 as part of the Newcastle Thousand Families survey. In 1957 she published part of this study together with examples of her work in multidisciplinary clinics as The Development and Disorders of Speech in Childhood. This work was regarded as a landmark in speech pathology in the United States of America. In 1958, on the basis of this book, Morley was awarded the degree of DSc by the University of Durham. Morley made her first of several visits to the US in 1951 where she found the standard of clinical work was below that of the UK, but that academically the training was more extensive. Upon her return to the UK, Morley hoped that a university degree course might persuade more people into the profession. Eventually, she persuaded the university in Newcastle, still then part of the University of Durham, to investigate the possibility of setting up a degree. In 1959, Morley's idea was realised and she delayed her retirement in order to establish the course. She was appointed lecturer in speech and speech pathology in the departments of child health and education, founding head of what became the first department of Speech in Britain. Bill for Professions Supplementary to Medicine (1959) Morley joined the ultimately successful campaign against registration under the Bill for Professions Supplementary to Medicine because she was convinced that the profession, in order to survive, must exist as a discipline completely separate from general medicine. A national referendum of speech therapists followed, the profession stood firm and, despite government anger, they were removed from the Bill. The Professions Supplementary to Medicine Bill was enacted in 1960. Retirement Morley's contribution to the profession of speech therapy was considerable. She eventually retired from what was by then the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, however in retirement she became the founding editor of the College of Speech Therapists' journal from 1966 - 1971, then known as the British Journal of Disorders of Communication. Morley served as its third president from 1971-1973\\\\. Throughout her career, she forged strong links with speech therapy profession in the US, Australia and New Zealand where she travelled widely as a visiting professor. She was involved in achieving reciprocal recognition of speech therapy qualifications in the US and was made an honorary member of the American Cleft Palate Association and honorary fellow of the Australian College of Speech Therapists. In 1980, Morley was appointed OBE in acknowledgement of her pioneering work in research and education in speech therapy. Donald Court, professor of child health at Newcastle and her former colleague, described Morley in 1984 as a \\"remarkable woman\\", likening her to Cromwell's soldiers, \\"she knew what she fought for and loved what she knew\\". During her retirement, Morley lived in Northumberland where she enjoyed the last thirty years of her life. The photography that she learned as part of her original cleft palate work remained a lifelong hobby. Morley never married but was described as being devoted to her family. She died of bronchopneumonia on 15 September 1993 in Alnwick, Northumberland. Publications =Books= * Morley, M (1945). Cleft palate and Speech.

The company had a significant influence in the development of theatrical, cinema, television, and specialty lighting. It equipped many major performing venues in the United States and its products were used in several other countries as well. Their eponymous product, the Klieglight, was the trade name for two quite different production lights manufactured by the company, and survives today in both industry argot and in popular idiom as a synonym for \\"spotlight\\" or \\"center of attention\\".  History  = Origins = The company was founded in 1896 in New York City when a Bavarian immigrant, Anton Kliegl, in partnership with A. H. Guendel, purchased the Myerhofer Electric Stage Lighting Company, and renamed it the Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company. A year later his older brother Johann Kliegl replaced Guendel, and the firm became known as the Kliegl Brothers Universal Electric Stage Lighting Company. From its infancy as a firm so small that its proprietors also worked as stagehands to supplement their income, it grew to be one of the largest firms in North America manufacturing lighting and control equipment for the theatre and television stage. = Factories = In the beginning, the firm occupied the Meyerhofer facilities in the old Star Theatre at 842 Broadway, New York City. By 1901 they had moved to 1393-95 Broadway/129 West 38th Street. After the loss of this plant to fire on August 15, 1911, they moved again, this time to 240 West 50th Street, and in September 1921, they built and occupied their own four-story plus basement factory at 321-325 West 50th Street. In 1962 they moved to a new, modern two- story plant at 32-32 48th Avenue in Long Island City. By 1966 an annex had been opened two blocks away to meet the press of business. By 1966 \\"NY/LA\\" appeared on drawing title blocks, denoting their last expansion, the opening of a branch sales/engineering office in Los Angeles under George Howard. By 1979 \\"LA\\" had vanished from the title blocks. After 1980, the company's business began to decline, and by the mid-1980s they had moved to a smaller plant at 5 Aerial Way, Syosset, Long Island, New York.Broadcasting Yearbook By 1996, the bankrupt company had closed down. = Management = Johann Kliegl was born in Bad Kissingen, Bavaria, Germany in 1869, and his brother Anton in 1872. Johann, trained as a locksmith, emigrated to the United States in 1888, and Anton, trained as a plumber, followed him there in 1893. There they both started working in a factory which manufactured electric arc lamps. Throughout their lives, the two brothers maintained close ties to Bad Kissingen, and endowed there a school, still extant, and grown to encompass grade, middle and high school divisions. Many of their employees were brought over from Bad Kissingen, such that the \\"patois\\" on the factory floor was known to the staff as \\"50th Street Deutsch\\". Anton, in fact, died in Bad Kissengen on May 19, 1927. Management was retained by the Kliegl family throughout the history of the firm. Johann remained active until a few days prior to his death on September 30, 1959. His son, Herbert Kliegl, was by that time the managing head of the firm, and remained so until a few weeks before his death on October 3, 1968. Control then passed to Herbert's son John H. Kliegl II. By 1992 the firm was in Chapter 11, and a stockbroker, Richard Davisson, took complete ownership and control, replacing John Kliegl II with Al Vitale. The firm ceased operations in November 1996.New York Department of State = Products = At the time of the firm's founding, electric lighting for the stage was in its infancy. Held finds no catalog of stage lighting equipment earlier than Kliegl's catalog of 1898. as cited in Rubin. Indeed, it may be inferred that the use of \\"Electric\\" in the company's name was intended to distinguish its products from the illuminating gas or acetylene fueled lime light equipment they would replace. Many of what became common devices, such as the stage \\"shoe\\" or thrust plug and the disappearing footlight were patented by the Kliegls, and many others were developed into the forms still familiar today Initially they continued the Myerhofer business as \\"contractors and manufacturers\\", as noted in their Catalog G of 1913. In 1903 they furnished and installed the complete stage lighting system for the Metropolitan Opera Company's new home on West 37th Street (John was at the time an electrician for the Met).as cited in In 1933 they would be again called to provide a complete new stage lighting system, although not as installers. Catalog G also displayed the carbon arc floodlight, developed by the firm in 1911, as the iconic Klieglight. A diverse assortment of lighting and electrical products were also cataloged, such as exit signs, backup batteries, dimmer boards, connectors, effect projectors, chandeliers, marquee lights (and complete marquees), charging outlets for electric cars, switchboards, etc. Featured was a \\"Skyrocket\\" sign for Tilyou's Steeplechase Park in Coney Island.For illustrations of the company's products from the early era of incandescent lighting, see The development of electrical standards was spurred, in part, by the Iroquois Theatre fire of 1903. Kliegl Brothers' Catalog E states that \\"plugs and receptacles are in accordance with Underwriter's requirements and pass city inspections\\". The Kliegls maintained a direct interest in the development of standards for theatre electrical systems. From 1950 to his death, Herbert Kliegl was a member of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) code making panel No. 115. A precursor of today's spotlights, the \\"baby spotlight\\", their first using an incandescent lamp, was introduced in their Catalog E of 1906 as cited in Rubin . The takeover of the incandescent lamp would be inexorable. as cited in Rubin From about 1908, motion picture studios were using the company's floor-stand arc lamps, which allowed for point-source lighting, including some of the first low-light effects; the shadow produced by the two pairs of carbon rods can be seen in some early films. In their 1922 catalog, the company was still featuring its motion picture studio equipment, but by 1926, references to motion picture applications had dwindled to a single line of type on the first page. In 1924 they introduced the use of glass rondels as color media in border and footlights, eliminating coloring of individual lamps. Kliegl Brothers introduced its Fresnel lens spots in 1929, and by 1935 were ordering their own Fresnel lenses from Corning. as cited in Rubin Pages devoted to Kliegl products in the 1928/29 catalogs of retailers such as Holzmueller on the west coast and wholesalers like Marle in Stamford, Connecticut, showed that their sales now extended well beyond their own factory. The condensed catalog of 1929 for the first time lists a broader range of \\"Mazda\\" (incandescent lamps) than arc spots. By 1930, the \\"Mazda\\" name has vanished, yielding to \\"incandescents\\". In 1932, the Kliegl brothers installed their new ellipsoidal reflector spotlights in the Center Theatre in Radio City. Based on the new GE T14 medium bipost lamps, these had triple the efficiency of the standard plano convex spots. They were demonstrated to a meeting of the Illuminating Engineering Society on April 19, 1933 and introduced as a standard product in Catalog B of 1933 as \\"Klieglights\\" and billed on pages 42–45 of Catalog 40 of 1936 as \\"The New Klieglight\\". Catalog 40 of 1936 introduced a full line of architectural downlights (individual architectural products had been made for some time), the autotransformer dimmer (originally dubbed the \\"Transtat\\", the catalog was overstamped, changing the trade name to \\"Autrastat\\"), motor operated dimmers, fresnel lens spots, etc. At the same time, the more obsolete and exotic products began to disappear. This catalog also introduced \\"Alzak\\" reflectors, Alzak being a proprietary process for producing a mirror-like finish on aluminium. Under agreement with the process owner, Alcoa, Kliegl Brothers created reflectors using the Alzak process for their own use and for sale at the Kliegl Reflector Company, a separate subsidiary plant located on 11th Avenue between 33rd and 34th streets (opposite the location of the present Javits Center). Major was the only other licensee for stage lighting reflectors. An interesting specialty, prominently featured in this catalog, but dating to the first catalog, was the effect projector, in which rotating, hand painted, transparent discs rotated before projector spots. Precise optical lenses spread the image to beam lighted patterns or images, ranging from a simple snowfall to the elaborate \\"Christ Rising to Heaven with Three Angels\\", onto a stage backdrop. Six artists sat before the tall 50th Street windows on the third floor hand painting the tiny images which would be magnified many times when in use. These were used not only on stage, but also in architectural applications. By 1960, effect projectors had been made obsolete by film, and later, computer-generated projections. By catalog T61, issued in 1954, the arc spots were represented by a single model, while the Klieglight line offered models ranging from 250 watt to 3000 watt spots. The company was also offering their \\"Dynabeam\\" lensed follow spot, and fresnels from 100 to 2000 watts. In that era of patch panels and small numbers of high wattage dimmers, Kliegl Brothers offered its \\"Safpatch\\" patch panels, and \\"Rotolector\\" rotary power switches, both developed by Herbert Kliegl. Both products interlocked the electrical contacts with a circuit breaker, preventing arcs while switching or patching. From the beginning of the firm's operations, custom products were readily available. Indeed, the craft shop system used throughout its history made little differentiation between custom and standard products. High-end lighting designers regularly sought out Kliegl Brothers, who could design and produce the hardware that would fulfill their visions. Often, the custom product made its mark on the industry, such as the wall washers designed for the UN General Assembly room, or the fluorescent wall washers for New York's Pan American (now Met Life) building lobby, both designed by Herbert Kliegl. A custom oddity was the scoreboard designed for Madison Square Garden, across 50th Street from the factory. This remained in use until the relocation of the Garden to its current home atop Penn Station. Until 1959 Kliegl provided controls as an assembler of equipment purchased or licensed from others. Resistance plates and variable brush autotransformers were largely purchased from Ward Leonard; magnetic amplifiers from General Electric. Thyratron dimmers were manufactured under license from Strand Electric of England. All this started to change in 1958. In 1959 the first commercially viable solid state theatre dimmer, Kliegl's SCR(R), was introduced as model R59. Improved models followed. Within two years, the solid state dimmer had, as a practical matter, swept away all other dimming systems. In the 1960s, like other theatrical suppliers, the company was making more from amateur theatre companies than from either film or professional theatre. In 1975, the company produced the first modern, computerized lighting control console, the precursor to the Kliegl Performer, to be used on the Broadway musical “A Chorus Line”. The Tony Award winning lighting for “A Chorus Line”, designed by legendary lighting designer Tharon Musser is generally acknowledged to be the most complex up until that point, and could not have been completed without Kliegl's programmable computer board. In 1977, the company received permission from the Canadian government to start a Toronto subsidiary. The 1978 series of catalog brochures shows that product development had significantly slowed. By the mid 1980s, attempts to build the next generation modern control console had failed. Luminaire and accessory lines had further narrowed, and the trend was inexorable. Unable to compete in a world of low-cost mass production, the firm finally ceased operations in 1996. = Klieglight = The first \\"Klieglight\\" was a powerful carbon arc light designed for the motion picture industry. It was not the first arc light offered by the company (arc floods are offered in their bulletin \\"Stage Lighting Apparatus and Effects of Every Description\\", published prior to 1906), and nor was it a spotlight. Its first listing is in Catalog G of 1913, where it is shown as a horizontal wide flood. None of the surviving catalogs, through to its disappearance from the company's product line, describe any other lighting instrument as a \\"Klieglight\\", with all arc spotlights uniformly described as \\"arc spotlights\\". \\"Klieglight\\", however, reappears on pages 42–45 of Catalog 40 of 1936 as the name of their new line of ellipsoidal reflector incandescent spotlights, and this usage continued as long as the company was in existence. Oddly enough, the company apparently did not attempt to trademark the name, although there was a filing for a logo that was never carried through.

His exploits became the subject of several news reports and inspired a Facebook fan page that attracted over 1,300 followers from around the world.BuurtpoesBledder , facebook.com, accessed 24 January 2020 Bledder died after being struck by an unknown motorist near his home in Leiden. Biography Bledder was adopted by the residents of a student house in Leiden in the spring of 2012. They named him Jacco. The following summer, they began allowing him to roam the neighborhood. The cat's curiosity and love for human company encouraged him to explore the many cafes, shops, bars and offices around the Nieuwe Rijn, the city's historic central district.(dead link) While some business owners didn't approve of his presence, others welcomed him. Bledder became a \\"regular\\" at the Cafe Jantje van Leiden, a brown bar, De Twee Spieghels, a jazz cafe, De Bierwinkel Leiden, a shop that specializes in imported beers, and Velvet, a record store. The cat was given many nicknames in the months that followed by various clerks, restaurateurs, neighbors and customers. Among them: Danger Cat, Chardonnay, Prinsje, Roof Cat and Sweetheart, in addition to Jacco, his \\"real\\" name. In September 2012, a clerk at Velvet created a Facebook fanpage in honor of the cat and, not knowing his real name or where he lived, dubbed him \\"Buurtpoes Bledder.\\" This nickname, which would go on to become the cat's best known moniker, combines a mix of Dutch words and regional terms. \\"Buurtpoes\\" translates as \\"neighborhood cat\\" but \\"Bledder\\" has multiple definitions. The clerk included \\"Bledder\\" because of the cat's white and black coloring, which made him resemble a soccer ball. This word means \\"ball\\" or \\"bald.\\" The Facebook page quickly drew seven hundred followers and reached an eventual peak of around 1,300 followers in 2015, many of whom posted anecdotes and photos of the cat's adventures around Leiden. Bledder's insatiable curiosity got him into plenty of trouble during his short lifetime. He was retrieved from a canal with a field hockey stick one afternoon and often ran around in the rain gutter on the roof of the student house whenever he could sneak out a window on the top floor. In the autumn of 2012, he became trapped up there after the window swung shut behind him. His owners were away on a weekend retreat and the cat spent the night on the roof and endured a fierce thunderstorm. He was rescued the following morning by the Leiden Fire Department after neighbors heard him meowing. A small memorial for Buurtpoes Bledder at the Cafe Jantje van Leiden, August 2013 Bledder went missing in January 2013, causing many of his fans to worry and speculate over his whereabouts. He was returned to his owners three weeks later. A couple who lived in a house a few blocks away had discovered Bledder, assumed he was a stray and adopted him. A friend later informed them of the cat's Facebook page and they took him home. Death On the night of August 7, 2013, Bledder was hit and killed by an unknown motorist. Local residents built a memorial for him outside the Cafe van Jantje. The cat's passing was covered by several media outlets, including the Leidsch Dagblad, the national daily paper De Telegraaf and SBS 6, a national television station. Bledder's Facebook page also received hundreds of condolences from his fans. \\"Buurtpoes\\" was declared the Word of the Year by Leidsch Dagblad in December 2013. There was public discussion over what to do with his remains. His owners considered the possibility of having the cat stuffed and placed on permanent display at the Cafe van Jantje. The media attention and debate over Bledder's final resting place led an artist at the Leidsch Dagblad, the city's daily newspaper, to create an editorial cartoon mocking his postmortem popularity. It was published on Saturday, August 17, 2013. Eventually, the decision was made by his owners to have him stuffed and placed on display in their house on the Hartesteeg. On the fifth anniversary of Bledder's death, he was briefly moved to the Velvet record shop along the Oude Rijn.

Guitar players such as James Valentine (Maroon 5) and John Mayer use multiple amplifiers simultaneously to achieve their tones. Session guitar players such as Brent Mason often bring four or more amplifiers to recording sessions. There are many different types of guitar amplifiers that have drastically different sounds. There are three classic guitar amplifier circuits that most amplifiers are based on that all use different power amplifier tubes: The EL84 powered class A circuits which comes from the Vox AC30 and AC15 amplifiers, The 6L6 and 6V6 powered class AB circuits which come from Fender amplifiers, and the EL34 powered class AB circuits which come from Marshall amplifiers. The sonic characteristics of these different amplifier configurations are extremely different and for a lot of guitar players it is important to have the tonal palette of all three. This is especially true for studio guitarists and is why a lot of high-end recording studios have multiple different types of guitar amplifiers in house. It is a common practice to use a 6L6 or 6V6 powered amplifier for a clear, clean tone in conjunction with an EL34 or EL84 powered amplifier for a more distorted tone. It is then a matter of blending the two amps' signals in order to achieve the desired amount of distortion.  Use of Effects with Multiple Amplifiers  The use of effects with multiple guitar amps is a common way to achieve a \\"bigger-sounding\\" tone. One of the most common and easiest ways to achieve this is through the use of a stereo delay unit. The guitar's signal enters the delay unit and gets split into two signals. One signal will usually be kept dry and go to one amplifier while the other signal will be delayed be a specific amount of time depending on the tempo of the song and go to the other amplifier. This creates a much bigger sounding guitar tone than just one mono delay feeding one amplifier. Oftentimes in the studio, dry and wet signals will be panned left and right in the mix to create a better stereo image. This can be heard on a lot of Coldplay recordings. Other common effects that are used with multi-amp rigs are stereo reverbs. Stereo reverbs are often used with two of the same amp. The advantage of using effects with multiple guitar amplifiers is that one can amplify a dry signal while another amplifies a wet signal with effects and the two signals can be blended in parallel. A lot of guitar effects don't feature any kind of mix function so using two amplifiers allows the user to dial in the amount of effects being heard.  Common Problems using Multiple Guitar Amplifiers  The most common problem with using multiple guitar amplifiers is that the phase of the amplifiers does not always line up. If the two amplifiers are 180° out of phase, then the sound will be very thin sounding. Most of the time, this can be fixed by reversing the polarity on the connection between one of the amplifiers and that amplifiers speaker. However, there are units such as the radial phazer that can provide a more exact alignment of phase. Another common problem with using multiple guitar amplifiers is that it can cause ground loops. Ground loops happen when multiple amplifiers are running off of the same AC power source. Signal gets from one amplifier to the other through the ground connection and causes a loud hum. The most simple way around this is to simply use a three-prong to two-prong adapter on one of the amplifiers. This lifts the ground connection and breaks the loop. To avoid the safety hazard of lifting the ground on a high-powered amplifier, a lot of people use transformers to isolate the signals going to the amplifiers to solve the ground loop problem. This is much more expensive but safer. Category:Instrument amplifiers ","title":"Multi-amp guitar rigs"},{"id":"40197026","text":"There are over 20,000 Grade II* listed buildings in England.

The organization also questioned the Sri Lankan military's adherence to the fundamental rules of the Humanitarian law which include the prohibition of direct attacks on civilians and civilian objects and the prohibition of attacks on military targets expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life. =Sri Lankan Government= The charges were denied by the Sri Lankan government spokesperson who claimed that two bombing raids were conducted in the area and one of them was aimed at a nearby LTTE base. But this was rejected by other sources, who claimed that the LTTE camp was located near the Nandikadal Lagoon situated 4 and a half kilometers away from the town. A Tamil politician from Colombo said that the SLAF attack on the civilian target appeared to be in retaliation to the heavy losses suffered last Sunday by the Sri Lanka army north of Mannar. He pointed out that civilian targets have been bombed by the SLAF in past following major set backs in the war against the Liberation Tigers. According to independent sources, 138 Sri Lanka army personnel, including two officers, were killed and 902 were wounded when the Liberation Tigers counterattacked a major offensive by government forces.

West Sussex and its buildings Districts of West Sussex West Sussex, a non-metropolitan county, is divided for administrative purposes into seven local government districts, as marked on the map: # Worthing # Arun # Chichester # Horsham # Crawley # Mid Sussex # Adur Listed buildings in England In England, a building or structure is defined as \\"listed\\" when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of \\"special architectural or historic interest\\" by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, a Government department, in accordance with the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (a successor to the 1947 act). English Heritage, a non-departmental public body, acts as an agency of this department to administer the process and advise the department on relevant issues. There are three grades of listing status.

Album sales are used to improve the monastery and pay off the abbey's debt. The music is arranged by the abbess Mother Cecilia. The community attends Mass in the extraordinary form (Traditional Latin Mass) and prays the 1962 Monastic Breviary. History The community was established in 1995 as a small order of Benedictine nuns under the auspices of the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, in Scranton, Pennsylvania. They were originally called the Oblates of Mary, Queen of Apostles. They began following a monastic horarium defined in the Rule of Saint Benedict, and chanting the Divine Office in Latin according to the 1962 Breviarium Monasticum. Upon his arrival in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph in 2005, Bishop Robert Finn said that vocations to the priesthood and religious life would be seen as a \\"super-priority\\" for his diocese. In March 2006, Finn invited the order to his diocese. The nuns relocated to Gower, Missouri and were established as a public association of the faithful with the new name \\"Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles\\". In September 2018, its priory was raised to abbey and their new Abbey Church was consecrated by Bishop Robert Finn. Mother Cecilia was the first abbess to received the Abbatial Blessing according to the traditional Pontificale in the United States.

Gervais studied physics and mathematics in Paris, where he graduated in 1961 and got his Ph.D. in 1965 as a student of Claude Bouchiat and Philippe Meyer in Orsay. From 1966 to 1968 he was a post-doctoral researcher at the University of New York City. Already since 1960 he was employed at the CNRS, from 1970 on as Maître de conférences. During 1973–1985 he was Maître de conférences at École polytechnique. From 1979 to 1983 and from 1995 to 1998 he was director of the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics of the École Normale Supérieure. He had been a guest professor at the City College of New York and also partly at University of California, Berkeley, at the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge (1997), at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and at University of California, Santa Barbara. Gervais worked on quantum field theory, supersymmetry and string theory. In 1969, he investigated (together with Benjamin W. Lee) renormalisability of theories of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In 1971, he presented with Bunji Sakita a supersymmetric invariant Lagrangian in the framework of a precursor of string theory, called the dual resonance models.J-L Gervais and B Sakita: Field theory interpretation of supergauges in dual models. In: Nuclear Physics B 34 (1971) p. 832 In 1969, he calculated one-loop diagrams in the early string theory, with Daniele Amati and Bouchiat. In the beginning of the 1970s, he also studied, with Sakita, string theories as conformal field theories in two dimensions and then soliton theories as field theories of collective excitations, e.g., in the context of WKB wave functions. In the 1980s he studied soliton (Skyrmion) models of quarks in the limit of many color degrees of freedom (large-N limit). He then also considered conformal field theories such as the Liouville field theory, string theories and two-dimensional quantum gravity from the point of view of exactly integrable systems. With André Neveu, he investigated in the 1980s also non-critical string theories.J-L Gervais and A Neveu: Nuclear Physics B 209 (1982) p. 125 In 1997 he was awarded the highly reputed Prix Créé par l'État from the French Académie des sciences. Among his Ph.D. students are particle physicists Antal Jevicki (now professor at Brown University) and Adel Bilal.

The term was coined by playwright Tennessee Williams, describing his work The Glass Menagerie. In his production notes, Williams says, \\"Being a 'memory play', The Glass Menagerie can be presented with unusual freedom of convention.\\"Williams, p xvi In a widening of the definition, it has been argued that Harold Pinter's plays Old Times, No Man's Land and Betrayal are memory plays, where \\"memory becomes a weapon\\". Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa is a late 20th-century example of the genre. The Glass Menagerie In the script, Williams describes the scene: In his first few lines Tom Wingfield declares: The action of the play is loosely based on Williams' own memories. The narrator, Tom Wingfield, moves in and out of the action, directly addressing the audience at times. The other characters Amanda and Laura also revisit their own memories throughout. Williams' plays A Streetcar Named Desire and Summer and Smoke are also referred to as memory plays. Other examples Dharamveer Bharti wrote Suraj ka satvan ghoda in 1952. It was adapted on screen by Shyam benegal in 1992 as a film of same film of same name. The 1970s works of Harold Pinter, including Landscape, Silence, A Kind of Alaska, Betrayal and Old Times have been described by Michael Billington and others as memory plays. Characters recite their own versions of past events and there is no clear indication of which, if any, is true. In Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa, \\"a memory play focusing on the five unmarried Mundy sisters who struggle to maintain the family home ... The memory controlling the play's shape and substance belongs to Michael, the 'love child' of Chris, youngest of the sisters.\\" Critic Irving Wardle has argued that Friel invented the modern memory play, citing Philadelphia, Here I Come! and Faith Healer as examples. The play, Da, by Hugh Leonard is another example of a memory play.Owens, Cóilín. & Radner, Joan Newlon, editors. Irish Drama, 1900-1980. CUA Press, 1990. page 630 The term has also been used to describe film, such as John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, described by Scott Eyman as containing \\"under populated sets\\" and \\"archetypal characters\\". In a 2007 essay entitled \\"Some Memory Plays Before the 'Memory Play'\\", academic and director Attilio Favorini identifies Ibsen, Strindberg, Pirandello and O'Neill as early 20th-century exponents of the memory play, arguing the influence of Freud and Jung on their work.

In addition to his own practice, his main focus was on the training of \\"lay\\" hypnotherapists in Glendale, California; and, over some 55 years, he trained thousands of hypnotherapists globally with his Transforming Therapy methods. Many of his students wrote books and created their own hypnotherapy training centers.Including Randal Churchill (Hypnotherapy Training Institute) and Charles Tebbetts. Mentored by Ormond McGill — with whom he collaborated for Professional Stage Hypnotism (1977) — he championed the accessibility of hypnotherapy and consistently fought against legislative efforts worldwide to restrict hypnosis to the purely medical professions, which had largely ignored the therapeutic value of hypnosis until Boyne, Milton Erickson, and Dave Elman. Early life and career Mark Thomas Gilboyne was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on October 28, 1924, to Mark Gilboyne (1903-1976) and Margaret Elizabeth Gilboyne (1908-1983), née Barratt. He had one sister, Margaret Dolores Gilboyne (1933-2005). Raised in a deeply religious Irish- American Roman Catholic family, his early schooling was religiously focused; something that influenced his spiritual beliefs throughout his life. He served in the Navy in the Pacific theater during World War II, after which he was assigned to a therapeutic program based on psychoanalysis. The program was largely ineffective, and his frustration with the approach, his spiritual and religious upbringing, and experience as a stage hypnotist led him to develop the transformative approach using hypnosis. Contemporary influences included Dave Elman, Milton Erickson, Fritz Perls' Gestalt Therapy and Carl Rogers' \\"unconditional positive regard\\". Hypnotism Training Institute Gil founded and was the director of the Hypnotism Training Institute in Glendale. In 1976, he opened Hypnotherapy training center in the United States offering up to 250 hours of training, including a diploma-offering curriculum in professional hypnotherapy. Transforming Therapy With his background and experiences and with influences by his contemporaries mentioned above, Boyne developed one of the first programs designed to train hypnotherapists in a regression-based approach. The resulting program, Transforming Therapy, was used for decades to train over 12,000 and possibly as many as 15,000 hypnotherapists globally. The Transforming Therapy method incorporated aspects of Regression Therapy and Gestalt Therapy as well as focusing on the self-healing power of the subconscious mind. It uses a compassionate spiritual approach that simplifies theory in the actual therapy and hones in on allowing the inner mind to construct its own solutions creatively. The approach is generally considered to be rapidly effective[3]. Boyne continued to train hypnotherapists for over 55 years, continuing to evolve many novel techniques in the field and imparting them to his students. Boyne founded Westwood Publishing, one of the first publishers to focus on hypnotherapy-focused publications. Boyne also founded the American Council of Hypnotist Examiners in 1980. Hypnotherapist to the Stars From his Glendale offices near Hollywood, Gil worked with many actors throughout his career, including Sylvester Stallone, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton. Such work often brought international media attention. He was also a technical director or advisor on several films and television series, including The Hypnotic Eye, Above and Beyond, and The Eleventh Hour. In addition, Boyne reportedly worked with professional and olympic athletes and the US Green Berets.

Oertel in Bagan (1892) Friedrich Oscar Oertel (December 9, 1862 – February 22, 1942) was a German-born engineer, architect, and archaeologist. He is best known among Indian art historians and archaeologists for having excavated the archaeological site of Sarnath (India, Uttar Pradesh) in the winter of 1904–1905. It was here that in March 1905 he unearthed the capital of an Ashokan pillar, which was to become the national emblem of India. However, probably because he was mainly involved as a civil engineer and architect in the Public Works Department, his contributions to the fields of art history and archaeology are largely overlooked in the historiography of South Asian art and archaeology.  Life  F.O. Oertel & his wife Margaret H. Lechmere, 25 July 1903 Friedrich [Frederick] Oscar Emanuel Oertel was born 9 December 1862 in Hannover, Germany. The author of this page is thankful to Rolf Jaeger for having put to her disposal photos and letters from F.O. Oertel. He renounced his German citizenship before leaving for India as a young man and was naturalised British.http://yourdemocracy.newstatesman.com/parliament/war/HAN2250178 ; http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1916/nov/15/public-works- department#S5CV0087P0_19161115_HOC_9  Retrieved 10 July 2013.

Lechmere-Oertel\\". He died in New York on 22 February 1942.http://www.ancestry.co.uk/cs/uk/probate.Confusion about his date of death is noted to this day: the Directory of British architects has him die in 1921 (Directory, vol. 2, pp. 27–28, with further references to 1921 publications), an evident misinterpretation probably caused by his retirement and his return to Europe. The date of 1931 is given without any further reference by Guha 2010, p. 249 (probably in that year he made a major donation to the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge). Mention of his decease, without any precise date being given, is made in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, October 1944, p. 213.  India:1883-1920  Oertel left Germany for India where he studied at the Thomason College of Civil Engineering (now Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee).The India List 1905, pp. 579–580. From March 1883 to March 1887 he was assistant engineer on railway & building construction for Indian Public Board, being posted to the North-Western Provinces & OudhDirectory 2001, p. 27; The India List 1905, p. 580. before returning in 1887–1888 to England where he studied architecture under Richard Phené Spiers.Oertel 1913, p. 378. On his way back to Europe he was nearly killed on 17 April 1887 when the P&O; Tasmania (de) which he had boarded and which was sailing from Mumbai (Bombay) to Marseille sunk on the south-western coast of Corsica.The Times of Malta 16 December 1936, p. 10. The Lion Capital of Ashoka on the ground at Sarnath, before 1911, probably 1904-05 Oertel then started upon a brilliant career in the Public Works Department, being first sent on diverse missions and then appointed in various locations. Sent by the Government of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, in the winter of 1891–92 he surveyed the monuments and archaeological sites in North and Central India before reaching Rangoon in March 1892.Oertel 1893, p. (1). Then, and in the following month, Oertel visited Mandalay, Amarapura and Sagaing from where he travelled down the Irrawaddy to Pagan and Prome (today Pyay). Back in Rangoon, he travelled South to Pegu (today Bago), Moulmein (today Mawlamyaing), Martaban (Mottama) and Thaton. On his return, he wrote a lengthy report illustrated with original photos which was published the following year.Oertel 1893. The photos which he took during this journey also illustrated George W. Bird's book Wanderings in Burma, published a few years later, along with photos by Felice Beato.Bird's book is illustrated with photos by F.O. Oertel and Felice Beato. Some 28 photos are by Oertel. In 1900 he was sent to Sri Lanka by the Royal Asiatic Society to visit the Abhayagiri dagoba and make suggestions on the best way to preserve or restore it.\\"Some Interesting Experiences\\", p. 9; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, July 1905, p. 598. As a result of this survey, Oertel wrote a report (Oertel 1903). As Executive Engineer in the \\"Buildings and Roads\\" branch of the Public Works Department, North-West Provinces and Oudh,Oertel 1913, p. 378. as from 1902, and as Superintending Engineer from 1908,The India List 1902, p. 60; his promotion can be deduced from the \\"List of Members of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great-Britain and Ireland\\" for 1908. he was posted in various places of Uttar Pradesh :From what can be inferred from the addresses added to his name in the \\"List of Members of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great-Britain and Ireland\\". It is, however, to be noted that these addresses do not necessarily coincide with those given in other sources. For instance, the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft for 1908 mentions Cawnpore. from 1903 to 1907, he was in Benares, in 1908 he was located in Lucknow, and from 1909 to 1915, in Cawnpore; he was then sent to Shillong, Assam, where he remained up to 1920.Following the references in the India directories for these years, the following locations are found: 1897 Naini Tal, 1898-1899 Saharanpur, 1902-1905 Benares, 1906-1907 Agra, 1908-1909 Lucknow, 1910-1914 Allahabad. According to Margaret's writings, Oertel retired in 1918 after which they stayed on in India, but not in Assam. They spent a lot of time trekking in Kashmir. Bodleian: Ms. Eng. let. d. 481 Throughout this period he was also involved in supervising or participating in the construction of numerous buildings in Uttar Pradesh (Allahabad; Agra; Lucknow; Cawnpore).Oertel 1913, p. 380. This firsthand experience helped him to formulate his opinion concerning the construction of the new capital at New Delhi, which he made public with a lecture delivered before the East India Association at Caxton Hall, Westminster, on 21 July 1913.Oertel 1913. Here he strongly urged that the architects of New Delhi should be inspired with a \\"really national Indian style\\".Oertel 1913, p. 384 also quoted by Metcalf 1989, p. 216 (see pp. 215–217). He was a member of various associations: the Institution of Civil Engineers (1889),Civil Engineer Records: retrieved 29 July 2013. See the \\"List of Associate Members of the Institution of Civil Engineers\\", 1904, p. 192. the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland (1900),\\"Notes of the Quarter\\" 1901, p.621 where the name of his brother also appears as elected member. and the Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft (1908);\\"Personalnachrichten\\", p. LVI (he was the 1414th member). he also became Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1888 and Fellow of the same institute in 1901.Directory 2001, p. 27; The R.I.B.A. Kalendar 1888–89, p. 68. While posted at Benares, Oertel undertook several works, such as the construction of a road leading to Sarnath, construction of a shelter for the sculptures found at Sarnath, transfer of the images kept in the Queen's College to this site, and excavation of the site.Oertel 1904–1905, p. 63 ; Oertel 1908, p. 277; Vogel 1910, p. 4. Following his excavations, he was transferred to Agra – John Marshall, the then General Director of the Archaeological Survey of India, taking over the Sarnath excavations – where he worked on preservation of the Fort in the years 1905–1906; in the year 1909–1910, he surveyed the Rikhian caves in Uttar Pradesh.Guha 2010, p. 249. Rikhian was then located in the Banda district; it is now in the Chitrakoot district. During the Royal Tour of 1905–1906, Oertel guided the Prince and the Princess of Wales (later King George V and Queen Mary) around the fort of Agra on 18 December 1905 and accompanied the Princess on her visit of the Sarnath excavations while the Prince and the Princess were in Benares from 18 to 21 February 1906.The Times of Malta 19 December 1936, p. 11; Tour p. xiii. A detailed map of the tour in the Agra fort with written indications by Oertel is preserved in the Cambridge University Library, see http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0115%2FRCMS%2089%2F52%2F1 (last retrieved 15 July 2013). The visit to Sarnath probably took place on 20 February (Tour , p. xxi); a photo depicting the Princess of Wales in front of the Ashoka capital preserved in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle shows her surrounded by some Europeans, one of them – one may reasonably surmise – being Oertel (see http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20090426/spectrum/art.htm) (last retrieved 15 June 2013). In August 1908, he took part to the Fifteenth International Congress of Orientalists in Copenhagen, where he presented his excavations at Sarnath.\\"The Fifteenth International\\", p. 335. In 1909, he was still on furlough in Europe where he visited glass factories in England, Germany, and Austria, publishing a short monograph on the topic in 1915, where he advocated that this industry should be developed in India.Oertel 1915; see also \\"India's Glass Trade\\"; http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1915/may/05/glass-industry- india#S5CV0071P0_19150505_HOC_145 (retrieved 10 July 2013). F.O. Oertel then became Chief Engineer and Secretary to the Public Works Department of the Government of Assam and this position provoked debate, because Oertel was German by birth and that Germany and England were then at war.http://yourdemocracy.newstatesman.com/parliament/war/HAN2250178¸ http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1916/nov/15/public-works- department#S5CV0087P0_19161115_HOC_9 ; http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1915/jul/01/assam-public-works- department#S5CV0072P0_19150701_HOC_227 (retrieved 10 July 2013).  Contribution to Indian art and archaeology  Beside his report on the monuments of Burma published in 1893, Oertel is best known for the excavation of Sarnath carried from December 1904 up to April 1905.Oertel 1908, p. 277. Not only did he unearth the Maurya capital on 15 MarchGuha 2010, p. 249. but he also brought to light numerous major images dating from the 4th up to the 12th century. Oertel left Sarnath for Agra where another major task awaited him: the restoration of the Diwan-i-Amm and Jahangiri Mahal in the Agra Fort and the reconstruction of the four minarets of the south gateway of the Akbar tomb in Sikandra in 1905–1906 while also working on the compound of the Taj Mahal,Nicholls 1906, pp. 17–20. Oertel drew elevations of the Saheli Burj 1 (see Nicholls 1906, plate IV). all work undertaken under the impetus of Lord Curzon as preparation to the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales. While in Agra he also conducted a more detailed study of the Moghol architecture of the city, as can be inferred from the Annual progress report by W.H. Nicholls. In 1909–1910, Oertel documented the sculptures of Yoginis at Rikhian (Rikhiyan) in Banda, now Chitrakoot district of Uttar PradeshAbove note 26; for the photos taken during this short survey, see Annual Progress Report…1910, pp. 23–24 (and http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/indiaofficeselect/JointEnqList.asp?txtPlace=Rikhian&strCat;=1); on Rikhiyan, read Dehejia 1986, pp. 118–121. Guha 2010, p. 250 mentions the existence of an unpublished paper on the topic. and also took an interest in the monuments located at Garhwa in the Allahabad district.Vogel 1910, pp. 5–6; Guha 2010, p. 250.  After India  F.O. Oertel, September 1930 He apparently returned to the United Kingdom in 1921, having retired from the Public Works Department; till around 1928, he lived in Teddington naming his house \\"Sarnath\\",Guha 2010, p. 250. and gave lectures on India.The slides used in these lectures are preserved in the British Library: http://prodigi.bl.uk/iosm/PhotoShowDescs.asp?CollID=470 (last retrieved 24 June 2013). In 1930, i.e. probably before departing for Abyssinia,He still resided in Teddington in 1930 but no longer appeared in the Phone Book for 1931 (in 1930, his wife was domiciled at another address): see retrieved 29 July 2013. he donated to the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge numerous artefacts which he had collected as well as a large collection of gelatine photos which he had made while posted in India.

In the winter of 1935–1936 he travelled to Japan, staying in Nara.The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland gives for address \\"Nara Hotel, Nara\\" in 1935 and 1936. This list of travels can also be obtained from the information about Oertel included in the \\"list of members\\" published in the successive issues of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. He then went to South America, probably visiting his daughter Joan, married to a Dr. R.L. Cheverton, whom she had met in Cyprus and who lived in the Falkland Islands.\\"Some Interesting Experiences\\", p. 9; Cheverton in The Times of Malta,20 December 1936, pp. 8–9 In December 1936 and January 1937, Oertel resided in Malta where a lengthy biographical paper was devoted to him by the Times of Malta in its issue of 16 December.

Hamilton is an American television journalist, on-air host, reporter and producer who has worked in news, sports, music and entertainment. He is the on-air TV host-reporter for the New York Yankees Scoreboard and broadcasting department. Formerly, he was a digital reporter for Channel One News, a youth-oriented news program broadcast in 8,000 high schools and middle schools across the country, reaching more than six million students daily. He was also a frequent on-air contributing reporter for CBSNews.com. Hamilton has also worked for NBC News, CBS News, MTV and Globestar Media/ND Promotions, an entertainment and music video promotions company. He was also a freelance music writer for the music website AllHipHop.com and had a stint with SONY BMG's Columbia Records. Biography Gary G. Hamilton was born and raised in Houston, Texas, and is a graduate of North Shore Senior High School. Involved in many different clubs and activities, Hamilton was the co-anchor for the school's in-house newscast, Mustang News, which aired directly after Channel One News. Upon graduation, he attended Abilene Christian University and received a Bachelor of Science degree in broadcast journalism. After internships with KPRC-TV 2, the local NBC affiliate in Houston, Houston's Majic 102.1, 979 the Box, and BET's 106 and Park, Hamilton was accepted into NBC's Page Program. Hamilton moved to New York from Houston to join Page Program. While in the program, Hamilton was offered a job within NBC Universal, so stayed with NBC for another year. After his experience at NBC, he followed his true love—music—and worked at MTV, followed by Columbia records. At the same time, he was assisting local Houston rapper Mike Jones of Swisha House as Houston's local rap scene exploded onto the national scene. He was also working Noah Jolles and Dan Otero of ND Promotions, a music video promotions company and was a freelance music critic for AllHipHop.com. While loving working in music, a great opportunity came about that he couldn't pass up, and he left to join Channel One News, the school newscast he watched every day in middle school and high school, and the same newscast that preceded his anchoring of Mustang News. Channel One was partnered with NBC News, so he returned to his old stomping ground. Hamilton was hired as an overnight production assistant. Hamilton began reporting hard news, entertainment and human interest stories on-air, as well as producing stories for himself and other reporters. He also hosted Channel One's \\"Next Big Thing\\", a weekly entertainment and tech segment. During his time at Channel One News with NBC News, he also worked with the weekend edition of NBC's TODAY. Most notably, he helped produce segments for TODAY's coverage of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Channel One News went on to partner with CBS News, and Hamilton continued to produce news and human interest stories for the teen news network. At the same time, he became a contributing reporter with CBSNews.com. Hamilton dually worked with Channel One and CBSNews.com until he was hired by the New York Yankees. Hamilton is the on-air host and in-stadium reporter and senior producer for the New York Yankees Broadcasting and Scoreboard department. He also reports on-air and producers for the official website of the New York Yankees. Recognitions and notable works Gary Hamilton's Channel One News story on African-American inventors in which he reported and produced is now permanently part of an exhibit in the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. He covered the second inauguration of President Barack Obama, the G-20 Summit, as well as natural disasters like the tornado that struck Henryville, Indiana in 2012, the Texas wildfires of 2011, and the drought that struck mid-western America in 2012. He's put a personal spin on important topics such as \\"The Swim Gap\\", the reasons many people of color can't swim, as well as an interview with his own mother about raising African American males in the wake of the controversial Trayvon Martin case. Hamilton has also interviewed numerous celebrities and professional athletes, including Mariano Rivera, CC Sabathia, Curtis Granderson, David Banner, 9th Wonder, Thomas Jones, Angie Stone, Macy Gray, Jaheim, Case, and many, many more. But his true passion lies in covering human interest stories, and showcasing great works that every day people are doing; People like Stephen Stafford, a kid genius who entered Morehouse College when he was just 11 years old, Dr. Jennifer A. Mazzotta-Perretti, a New York teacher who donated her kidney to save the life of one of her students, and Lovetta Conto, an orphan whose parents were killed by rebels in the Liberian country of Africa who now makes jewelry worn by celebrities like Angelina Jolie.

It is the only revolving restaurant in Perth, completing a full 360 degree rotation in 90 minutes and has been described by The Sunday Telegraph of London as offering \\"views of the Swan River, the flat expanse of the suburbs and the dry hills 25 miles [40 kilometres] beyond\\". History C Restaurant is the second restaurant to be located at the top of St Martins Tower. The first, Hilite 33, was opened in 1978. Its staff included a young Shane Osborn, who was later the head chef at Pied à Terre in London. In 2000, Hilite 33's co-founder and then owner, Alain Kuhl, sold the business. The other co-founder of Hilite 33 was Jean-Daniel Ichallalene. The new owner, Phil Clements, renamed the business, and relaunched it on Australia Day, 26 January 2001. Although Clements later claimed that C Restaurant offered \\"fun dining rather than fine dining\\", he also aimed to establish a national reputation. He revamped the menu, instituting a two course minimum order to deter casually dressed sightseers from ordering a coffee and lingering to admire the view. Within less than 12 months, C Restaurant had become \\"all the rage\\", and had won the Gold Plate award for fine and occasional dining. Soon afterwards, it was the place where, on 23 March 2002, England cricketer Ben Hollioake attended a dinner with his family before dying in a car accident on the way home. In August 2006, Clements sold the business to restaurant manager Olivier Letrone, entrepreneur Franck Duroleck and waiter Jermone Guesdon.

The episode was written by Matthew Negrete and directed by Tricia Brock. The episode does not focus on the central location of the prison, and instead, it takes place outside on two supply runs with two separate groups. No scenes are set at the prison, with the exception being the short pre-title introduction. Only six main characters are seen in the entire episode: Rick, Carol, Daryl, Michonne, Bob, and Tyreese. The episode primarily focuses on the relationship between Rick Grimes and Carol Peletier, after the revelation that she has killed two inmates out of mercy, causing Rick to make a difficult decision. Carol and Rick are out on a supply run, while Daryl and the others are trying to collect medical supplies and find a way back to the prison. The title of the episode refers to how Carol's indifference towards survivors dying and the general situation they are all in, as seen when Ana is being eaten and later commented on how \\"It was a nice watch\\" when Sam failed to show up to accompany them to the prison, thus losing Rick's watch that he had on. The episode is seen as a transitional stage for the development of Carol, having become cold and making difficult decisions to survive, ultimately causing Rick to feel unsafe and thus, he exiles her. It also distinguishes the differences between Rick and Carol: Rick stepping down from leadership to take on farming and living a peaceful life, while Carol steps up to make the decisions others are afraid of making. Plot After saying goodbye to Lizzie (Brighton Sharbino), Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) joins Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) on a supply run, since the group of Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) has not yet returned. Along the way, Carol defends her actions in killing Karen (Melissa Ponzio) and David. Arriving in a residential neighborhood, the two discover a surviving couple, Sam (Robin Lord Taylor) and Ana (Brina Palencia), who have been constantly moving to survive. Ana limps from a poorly healed leg injury, and Sam has some slight wounds and a dislocated shoulder. After Carol treats Sam's injuries, Rick asks them the three questions needed to enter the prison. Realizing that they are good people, he accepts them into his group, but warns them about the flu at the prison. He then tells them to stay put until he and Carol return, but Carol urges them to look for supplies against his wishes. Rick relents after the two insist that they want to help, and tells them to meet back at the house in two hours. Meanwhile, Daryl, Michonne (Danai Gurira), Bob Stookey (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.), and Tyreese (Chad L. Coleman) find a new car at an auto shop, but the battery is dead. The group encounters a few walkers, but a bitter Tyreese intentionally lets a walker overtake him and pin him to the ground, before being saved by Daryl and Bob. Michonne scolds him about his actions, saying that his anger might get him killed. Tyreese responds by bringing up her continued attempts to find and kill The Governor. While Daryl is hooking up a new battery, Bob confides in him about being the reasons for his alcoholism. He also confesses that he only joined the team scouting the retail store to find some liquor, and that his actions led to the walker attack that killed Zach. Daryl tells Bob not to be so hard on himself, finishes the repairs on the car, and the group continues on towards the college. Daryl's group finally arrives at the veterinary college and find the medicine they need. In the process, however, they alert numerous walkers and are forced to flee the building via a ledge. Bob stumbles and his bag is grabbed by some walkers. He refuses to let go and the group manages to pull him and his bag free, only to discover that the bag only contains a bottle of liquor. Daryl picks it up and tells Bob that he will beat him senseless if he catches him taking a drink before their people get the medicine. On the drive back to the prison, Michonne tells Daryl that she will stop looking for The Governor. While searching the neighborhood, Rick and Carol continue to debate her actions, with Carol still acting indifferent. Later, they see Ana's dead body being eaten by some walkers. They return to the house, but Sam has not returned. As they prepare to leave, Rick tells Carol that she cannot return to the prison because Tyreese would kill her when he finds out. When Carol objects, Rick also says that he does not want her around his family. Rick reassures Carol that she is now more than capable of surviving on her own. He gives her supplies, and the two go their separate ways on tense, but amicable, terms. Production The episode was written by co-producer Matthew Negrete, his first writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff this season. It was directed by Tricia Brock, who previously directed the season 3 episode \\"Clear\\". The episode title refers to several characters. Carol, throughout the episode, shows an unwavering conviction that she did what she had to do in murdering Karen and David and - at several points – a lack of concern for Sam and Ana, while Rick struggles with the fact that Carol does not seem to show much remorse. Carol also relinquishes to Rick a gift her late husband gave her. Several other characters are urged to let go and move on, throughout the episode, as well: Tyreese, Michonne, Bob, and Daryl. Reception =Ratings= Upon its original airing, \\"Indifference\\" earned 13.31 million viewers and a 6.8 rating in the adults 18-49 demographic. This was up slightly from last week's 12.92 million viewers, and even with last week's 18-49 demographic rating. =Critical response= Zack Handlen, of The A.V. Club, gave the episode a B+ on a scale graded from A (highest) to F (lowest), and praises Rick and Carol's story, calling it \\"the highlight of the hour\\" and that the episode \\"does a good job of developing and justifying both characters\\". Roth Cornet of IGN gave it a very positive review, scoring it 8.8 out of 10, and particularly praised the series' emphasis on character development this season, stating \\"The Walking Dead continues to deliver provocative episodes with an emphasis on subtle, but profound, emotional shifts and some of the most nuanced character development in this history of this series.\\" References External links *\\"Indifference\\" at AMC * * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 4) episodes ","title":"Indifference (The Walking Dead)"},{"id":"40197686","title":"Cristóbal Oudrid"},{"id":"40197689","title":"Trupti Murgunde"},{"id":"40197697","text":"Arkan Mubayed (, born 28 March 1983 in Latakia) is a Syrian footballer who currently plays for Al-Yarmouk in Jordan.http://www.kooora.com/?n=259510 References External links * Stats Goalzz.com Category:Living people Category:1983 births Category:Syrian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Expatriate footballers in Jordan Category:People from Latakia Category:Syrian expatriate footballers Category:Syrian expatriate sportspeople in Jordan Category:Syrian Premier League players ","title":"Arkan Mubayed"},{"id":"40197703","text":"AArch64 or ARM64 is the 64-bit extension of the ARM architecture.

AArch64 provides user-space compatibility with ARMv7-A, the 32-bit architecture, therein referred to as \\"AArch32\\" and the old 32-bit instruction set, now named \\"A32\\". The Thumb instruction set is referred to as \\"T32\\" and has no 64-bit counterpart. ARMv8-A allows 32-bit applications to be executed in a 64-bit OS, and a 32-bit OS to be under the control of a 64-bit hypervisor. ARM announced their Cortex-A53 and Cortex-A57 cores on 30 October 2012. Apple was the first to release an ARMv8-A compatible core (Apple A7) in a consumer product (iPhone 5S). AppliedMicro, using an FPGA, was the first to demo ARMv8-A. The first ARMv8-A SoC from Samsung is the Exynos 5433 used in the Galaxy Note 4, which features two clusters of four Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A53 cores in a big.LITTLE configuration; but it will run only in AArch32 mode. To both AArch32 and AArch64, ARMv8-A makes VFPv3/v4 and advanced SIMD (Neon) standard. It also adds cryptography instructions supporting AES, SHA-1/SHA-256 and finite field arithmetic. = AArch64 features = * New instruction set, A64 ** Has 31 general-purpose 64-bit registers. ** Has dedicated zero or stack pointer (SP) register (depending on instruction). ** The program counter (PC) is no longer directly accessible as a register. ** Instructions are still 32 bits long and mostly the same as A32 (with LDM/STM instructions and most conditional execution dropped). *** Has paired loads/stores (in place of LDM/STM). *** No predication for most instructions (except branches). ** Most instructions can take 32-bit or 64-bit arguments. ** Addresses assumed to be 64-bit. * Advanced SIMD (Neon) enhanced ** Has 32 × 128-bit registers (up from 16), also accessible via VFPv4. ** Supports double-precision floating-point format. ** Fully IEEE 754 compliant. ** AES encrypt/decrypt and SHA-1/SHA-2 hashing instructions also use these registers. * A new exception system ** Fewer banked registers and modes. * Memory translation from 48-bit virtual addresses based on the existing Large Physical Address Extension (LPAE), which was designed to be easily extended to 64-bit. AArch64 was introduced in ARMv8-A and is included in subsequent versions of ARMV8-A. AArch64 is not included in ARMv8-R or ARMv8-M, because they are both 32-bit architectures. = ARMv8.1-A = In December 2014, ARMv8.1-A, an update with \\"incremental benefits over v8.0\\", was announced. The enhancements fell into two categories: changes to the instruction set, and changes to the exception model and memory translation. Instruction set enhancements included the following: * A set of AArch64 atomic read-write instructions. * Additions to the Advanced SIMD instruction set for both AArch32 and AArch64 to enable opportunities for some library optimizations: ** Signed Saturating Rounding Doubling Multiply Accumulate, Returning High Half. ** Signed Saturating Rounding Doubling Multiply Subtract, Returning High Half. ** The instructions are added in vector and scalar forms. * A set of AArch64 load and store instructions that can provide memory access order that is limited to configurable address regions. * The optional CRC instructions in v8.0 become a requirement in ARMv8.1. Enhancements for the exception model and memory translation system included the following: * A new Privileged Access Never (PAN) state bit provides control that prevents privileged access to user data unless explicitly enabled. * An increased VMID range for virtualization; supports a larger number of virtual machines. * Optional support for hardware update of the page table access flag, and the standardization of an optional, hardware updated, dirty bit mechanism. * The Virtualization Host Extensions (VHE). These enhancements improve the performance of Type 2 hypervisors by reducing the software overhead associated when transitioning between the Host and Guest operating systems. The extensions allow the Host OS to execute at EL2, as opposed to EL1, without substantial modification. * A mechanism to free up some translation table bits for operating system use, where the hardware support is not needed by the OS. * Top byte ignore for memory tagging. = ARMv8.2-A = In January 2016, ARMv8.2-A was announced. Its enhancements fell into four categories: * Optional half-precision floating-point data processing (half-precision was already supported, but not for processing, just as a storage format.) * Memory model enhancements * Introduction of Reliability, Availability and Serviceability Extension (RAS Extension) * Introduction of statistical profiling  Scalable Vector Extension (SVE)  The Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) is \\"an optional extension to the ARMv8.2-A architecture and newer\\" developed specifically for vectorization of high-performance computing scientific workloads. The specification allows for variable vector lengths to be implemented from 128 to 2048 bits. The extension is completementary to, and does not replace, the NEON extensions. A 512-bit SVE variant has already been implemented on the Fugaku supercomputer using the Fujitsu A64FX ARM processor. It aims to be the world's highest-performing supercomputer with \\"the goal of beginning full operations around 2021.\\" SVE is supported by the GCC compiler, with GCC 8 supporting automatic vectorization and GCC 10 supporting C intrinsics. As of July 2020, LLVM and clang support C and IR intrinsics. ARM's own fork of LLVM supports auto-vectorization. = ARMv8.3-A = In October 2016, ARMv8.3-A was announced. Its enhancements fell into six categories: * Pointer authentication (AArch64 only); mandatory extension (based on a new block cipher, QARMA) to the architecture (compilers need to exploit the security feature, but as the instructions are in NOP space, they are backwards compatible albeit providing no extra security on older chips). * Nested virtualization (AArch64 only) * Advanced SIMD complex number support (AArch64 and AArch32); e.g. rotations by multiples of 90 degrees. * New FJCVTZS (Floating-point Javascript Convert to Signed fixed- point, rounding toward Zero) instruction. * A change to the memory consistency model (AArch64 only); to support the (non-default) weaker RCpc (Release Consistent processor consistent) model of C++11/C11 (the default C++11/C11 consistency model was already supported in previous ARMv8). * ID mechanism support for larger system-visible caches (AArch64 and AArch32) ARMv8.3-A architecture is now supported by (at least) the GCC 7 compiler. = ARMv8.4-A = In November 2017, ARMv8.4-A was announced. Its enhancements fell into these categories: * \\"SHA3 / SHA512 / SM3 / SM4 crypto extensions\\" * Improved virtualization support * Memory Partitioning and Monitoring (MPAM) capabilities * A new Secure EL2 state and Activity Monitors * Signed and unsigned integer dot product (SDOT and UDOT) instructions. = ARMv8.5-A = In September 2018 ARMv8.5-A was announced. Its enhancements fell into these categories: * Memory Tagging Extension (MTE), * Branch Target Indicators (BTI) to reduce \\"the ability of an attacker to execute arbitrary code\\" * Random Number Generator instructions – \\"providing Deterministic and True Random Numbers conforming to various National and International Standards.\\" On 2 August 2019, Google announced Android would adopt Memory Tagging Extension (MTE). = ARMv8.6-A = In September 2019, ARMv8.6-A was announced. It adds: * General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) * Bfloat16 format support * SIMD matrix manipulation instructions, BFDOT, BFMMLA, BFMLAL and BFCVT * enhancements for virtualization, system management and security For example, Fine grained traps, Wait-for-Event (WFE) instructions, EnhancedPAC2 and FPAC. The Bfloat16 extensions for SVE and Neon are mainly for deep learning use. =Future ARM architecture features= In May 2019, ARM announced their upcoming Scalable Vector Extension 2 (SVE2) and Transactional Memory Extension (TME).  Scalable Vector Extension 2 (SVE2)  SVE2 builds on SVE's scalable vectorization for increased fine-grain Data Level Parallelism (DLP), to allow more work done per instruction. SVE2 aims to bring these benefits to a wider range of software including DSP and multimedia SIMD code that currently use Neon. The LLVM/Clang 9.0 and GCC 10.0 development codes were updated to support SVE2.  Transactional Memory Extension (TME)  Following the x86 extensions, TME brings support for Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) and Transactional Lock Elision (TLE). TME aims to bring scalable concurrency to increase coarse-grained Thread Level Parallelism (TLP), to allow more work done per thread. The LLVM/Clang 9.0 and GCC 10.0 development codes were updated to support TME.

Early years Adolphe Schneider was born in Nancy, France, on 23 October 1802. He was the son of Antoine Schneider (1759-1828), Châtelain de Bidestroff, and Catherine Duran. His cousin was Antoine Virgile Schneider, who was known for his military service in Greece. Virgile married a Polish heiress who brought a considerable dowry. He was elected a deputy for Sarreguemines in 1834, became minister of war and was involved with construction of the fortifications of Paris. In 1821, at the age of nineteen, Adolphe Schneider entered the Seillière bank. Schneider had been recommended to François Seillière by his cousin Virgile.Seillière was from a Catholic family from Lorraine that had moved to Paris. The bank specialized in helping companies involved in iron-making and metallurgy such as Ignace- François de Wendel. Schneider quickly showed he had a strong business sense with exceptional qualities of listening, understanding, analysis and improvisation. In 1829 Seillière began to give him a share in the profits from supplies of wool, wheat and wood from the north and from marine insurance. In 1830 Schneider was the bank's agent with the French expeditionary force to Algiers, for which the bank was providing supplies. Schneider met the army's needs from Spanish suppliers, who were cheaper than the French. The project was a great success for the bank.Schneider received a 2% commission on all the merchandise, which gave him enough capital to go into business on his own account as a cloth merchant. On 7 July 1831 he married Valérie Aignan (1812–1861) in Paris. They had three children: Camille, Marie and Paul Henry. Around this time Schneider formed a relationship with the owners of the Le Creusot ironworks, and loaned them money. The works at Le Creusot had been founded fifty years before by a company partly owned by King Louis XVI of France. Despite an investment of 30 million francs, the works had never prospered. Le Creusot went bankrupt and was sold at auction in 1835 for 1,850,000 francs. Industrialist Adolph's younger brother Eugène Schneider had begun work as a clerk in Reims, then joined his brother at the Seillière bank. In 1827 the baron de Neuflize employed him as manager of a forge near Sedan, a position he held for nearly ten years. In 1835 Schneider obtained financing and acquired the works at Le Creusot from the purchaser at a premium of one million francs. Adolphe brought in Eugène to run the works while he handled finance and sales. In 1838 the works built the first French railway locomotive, and since then Le Creusot supplied almost all locomotives in France. At that time the works employed about 2,000 men. In 1842 the inventor François Bourdon designed and built a steam hammer for the works, one of the first. Schneider entered politics in 1840, when he was elected to the municipal council of Creusot. On 29 March 1841 he became mayor. He became a member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1842. Adolphe Schneider died on 3 August 1845 from a fall from his horse. His brother replaced him in the Chamber of Deputies. He is buried in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise in Paris. Legacy The industrial empire of Schneider et Cie. based on metallurgy and armament manufacturing prospered with the development of railways, iron ships and modern weapons such as machine guns, tanks and artillery. At one time the Schneider-Creusot iron works were the world's largest. Adolphe's grandson Jacques Schneider inherited the family business, and was a balloonist and aircraft enthusiast who created the Schneider Trophy. After World War I the arms business went bankrupt, and Jacques Schneider died in poverty. The parent company survived and prospered and today is Schneider Electric.

It was active until 1920, when suffrage for women was secured by the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Julia Ward Howe, first president of the New England Woman Suffrage Association The NEWSA was formed during a period when a split was developing within the women's rights movement and also between one wing of that movement and the abolitionist movement. Disagreement was especially sharp over the proposal to enfranchise African American men before enfranchising women. The NEWSA, which accepted that approach, was organized partly to counter the activities of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed it, insisting that women and black men should be enfranchised at the same time. The NEWSA also maintained close ties with the abolitionist movement and the Republican Party whereas Stanton and Anthony were working toward an independent women's movement. The NEWSA was the first major political organization with women's suffrage as its goal.DuBois (1978), p. 168 It was formed on a regional basis several months before the establishment of two national women's suffrage organizations, the National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association. The NEWSA played a key role in the formation of the latter and had overlapping leadership with it. Background The New England Woman Suffrage Association (NEWSA) was formed during a period when a split was developing within the women's rights movement and also between one wing of that movement and the abolitionist movement. Disagreements had already weakened the American Equal Rights Association, which was formed in 1866 by women's rights advocates and abolitionists to campaign for equal rights, including suffrage, for all citizens regardless of race or sex.DuBois (1978), pp. 64,185 Priority had become an issue: should universal suffrage be the immediate goal, or should African American men be enfranchised first? After slavery was abolished in the U.S. in 1865, the American Anti-Slavery Society declared that its work would not be finished until African Americans were also guaranteed political equality.DuBois (1978), p. 56 By the time of the NEWSA's founding, hope for fulfillment of that goal was embodied in a proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race. Because it would not also prohibit the denial of suffrage because of sex, however, it became a focal point for discord within the women's movement. Some members of the women's movement, such as Abby Kelley Foster, supported the amendment because they believed that suffrage for African American males was a more pressing need than suffrage for women.Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, p. 216. Foster is speaking here during the 1867 convention of the American Equal Rights Association (AERA). Others, such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, opposed any amendment that would in effect enfranchise all men while excluding all women, believing it would create an \\"aristocracy of sex\\" by giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women.DuBois (1978), pp. 174-175,185 Lucy Stone, who played a leading role in the NEWSA, argued that suffrage for women was more important than suffrage for black men but also supported the Fifteenth Amendment.Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, p. 384. Stone is speaking here during the 1869 AERA convention. The split also involved different assessments of the ruling Republican Party.DuBois (1978), p. 163 Many leading women's suffragists had been introduced to social activism through the anti-slavery movement and felt loyalty to both that movement and to the Republican Party, which had provided political leadership for the abolition of slavery in the U.S. and was still in the difficult process of consolidating that victory.DuBois (1978), pp. 19, 57, 59 After the uncomfortably close elections of 1868, Republican leaders recognized the importance of enfranchising African American men, most of whom were recently freed slaves, as a way of helping to preserve the victory over slaveholders during the American Civil War (1861–1865).Dudden (2011); p. 162 They and their abolitionist allies increasingly viewed women's suffrage as an objective that, even if successful, would not produce comparable political benefits, and they considered the campaign for it to be a drain on resources that were needed elsewhere.DuBois (1978), pp. 57, 59. The Constitution was amended in 1870 to theoretically ensure suffrage regardless of race, but, after an initial period during which that promise was meaningfully applied countrywide, voting by African Americans in much of the South was suppressed until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Women's rights activists generally had been strong supporters of the abolitionist movement and had also depended heavily on its resources. Those who distanced themselves from abolitionist and Republican leadership during this period, however, found themselves increasingly cut off from abolitionist resources and sometimes the target of outright hostility from Republicans.DuBois (1978), pp. 51, 72-73, 89 Stanton, Anthony and their allies felt betrayed and began to criticize the Republican Party and some of the abolitionist leadership.DuBois (1978), p. 166 Olympia Brown, an ally who played a role in the NEWSA's creation, criticized abolitionist leaders by name and said, \\"We must look for our support to new men\\".\\"What People Say to Us,\\" The Revolution, February 5, 1868, p. 67. Quoted in DuBois (1978), p. 106. The full quote is in Garrison (1981); p. 70. Stanton and Anthony greatly inflamed feelings by accepting help from George Francis Train, a supporter of women's rights who was also a wealthy Democrat and an outspoken racist.DuBois (1978), p. 63 Other women's suffrage activists, however, continued to support the abolitionist leadership and the Republican Party to varying degrees. History = Planning committee = Olympia Brown, who had recently become one of the first ordained woman ministers, initiated the proposal for a New England women's suffrage organization.DuBois (1978), p. 165 She hoped to create an association that would limit its activity to a campaign for women's suffrage, believing that campaigning for suffrage for both women and African Americans, as the American Equal Rights Association had done, would cause women's suffrage to be overshadowed. She sought to create an organization that would, in her own words, campaign on a \\"clear-cut, separate and single question.\\"Gwendolen B. Willis, ed., \\"Olympia Brown, An Autobiography,\\" Annual Journal of Universalist Historical Society, 4 (1963), 38. Quoted in DuBois (1978), p. 165 On the advice of Abby Kelley Foster, she announced a meeting in Boston in May 1868 to discuss her proposal and succeeded in gathering a hall full of people.Brown (1911); pp. 76-77 The meeting established a planning committee chaired by Caroline Severance.Elwood- Akers (2010), p. 61 Brown found herself and her single-issue approach sidelined by the planners of the new organization.Dudden (2011); p. 163 Seeking to counter the initiatives of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the committee launched an organization that supported suffrage for both blacks and women and was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first.DuBois (1978), pp. 164-166. Kerr (1992), page 134, says the planners of the NEWSA's founding convention \\"invited Stanton and Antony and offered to pay their expenses.\\" DuBois (1978), page 165, however, says that \\"When Stanton inadvertently received an invitation, Stephen Foster wrote to her to ask her not to attend.\\" Dudden (2011), page 255, footnote 14, agrees that Stanton's invitation was withdrawn. In addition to Brown and Severance, key figures in the planning for the new organization included Abby Kelley Foster, her husband Stephen Symonds Foster, and Thomas Wentworth Higginson, all of whom had been important figures in the abolitionist movement. Lucy Stone, a pioneering worker for women's rights who later became a leading figure in the new organization, had not yet moved to Boston from New Jersey and was not deeply involved in its planning.DuBois (1978), p. 165, including footnote 5 on that page. She attended the founding convention, however and was elected to the new organization's executive committee.DuBois (1978), pp. 165, 168 =Founding convention= The New England Woman Suffrage Association (NEWSA) was formed on November 19, 1868, during the second and last day of a regional women's rights convention in Boston, Massachusetts, where the new organization was to be headquartered.Kerr (1992), p. 145 Instead of distancing itself from the Republican Party, as Anthony and Stanton were doing, the planners for the NEWSA convention worked to attract Republican support and seated leading Republican politicians, including a U.S. senator, on the speaker's platform.DuBois (1978), pp. 165-166 Lucy Stone At the time of the NEWSA convention, Congress was considering the proposed Fifteenth Amendment, which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race but would not, as many women suffragists had hoped, also prohibit the denial of suffrage because of sex. (The amendment was approved by Congress in February 1869 and ratified by the states in 1870.) At the convention, Francis Bird, one of the most powerful politicians in Massachusetts, said, \\"Negro suffrage, being a paramount question, would have to be settled before woman suffrage could receive the attention it deserved.\\"\\"Woman's Rights Convention,\\" New York Times, November 20, 1868, p. 1. Quoted in DuBois (1978), pp. 169, 165 Amid increasing confidence that the Fifteenth Amendment was assured of passage, Lucy Stone, a future president of the NEWSA, showed her preference for enfranchising both women and black men by unexpectedly introducing a resolution calling for the Republican Party to \\"drop its watchword of 'Manhood Suffrage'\\"\\"Woman Suffrage,\\" New York Tribune, November 28, 1868; \\"Mrs. Lucy Stone and Woman Suffrage,\\" Commonwealth, November 28, 1868. Cited in Dudden (2011); p. 163 and support universal suffrage instead. Despite opposition by Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison and Frances Harper, Stone convinced the meeting to approve the resolution.Dudden (2011); p 163 Two months later, however, when the Fifteenth Amendment was in danger of becoming stalled in Congress, Stone backed away from that position and declared that \\"Woman must wait for the Negro.\\"\\"Stones Holding Their Peace,\\" and \\"Lucy Stone and the Negro's Hour,\\" Revolution 3 (February 4, 1869):73,89. Citied in Dudden (2011); p 165 The NEWSA supported the Fifteenth Amendment, believing that achieving suffrage for all men would be a step toward suffrage for women.DuBois (1978), pp. 172,176 The wing of the women's movement associated with the NEWSA expected the Republican Party to push for women's suffrage after the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified (an expectation that was not realized). DuBois (1978), pp. 199-200 Julia Ward Howe, author of \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\\" was elected as the NEWSA's first president. A member of a prominent family, she had recently been convinced to join the women's suffrage movement by Higginson and Stone.Howe (1900), pp. 374-375 During the convention, Howe said she would not demand suffrage for women until it was achieved for blacks.DuBois (1978), p. 169 =Activities= State affiliates of the NEWSA were formed in most New England states.DuBois (1978), p. 180 In January 1869, supporters of the NEWSA began publishing a newspaper called the Woman's Advocate from the office of the American Anti-Slavery Society.DuBois (1978), p. 163, footnote 2. In January 1870, the Woman's Advocate was replaced by the Woman's Journal, which was published by Lucy Stone and her husband Henry Blackwell.Dudden (2011); p. 164 Although the NEWSA waited until suffrage for blacks was assured before it began campaigning for women's suffrage at the national level, it pressed at an early stage for laws that would enfranchise women in the District of Columbia and the federal territories.DuBois (1978), p. 170 Another of its early initiatives was the collection of 8000 signatures on petitions to the Massachusetts legislature in 1869 in support of women's suffrage in that state, which led to the practice of annual public hearings on that question in the state legislature.Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 4, p. 721 The NEWSA's work in subsequent years included fund-raising bazaars, lectures, petitions and legislative hearings.Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 4, pp. 700-750 The split in the women's movement was formalized in May 1869 when Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton created the National Woman Suffrage Association to represent their wing.DuBois (1978), p. 189 The executive committee of the NEWSA responded by laying the groundwork for a rival organization called the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), which was founded in November 1869.Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, pp. 756-757 Henry Ward Beecher, a prominent minister, agreed to become the first president of the AWSA, but NEWSA leaders Lucy Stone and Julia Ward Howe played key roles both in the formation of the AWSA and in its leadership in subsequent years.Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 2, p. 764Cullen-DuPont, Kathryn (2000). \\"American Woman Suffrage Association\\" in The Encyclopedia of Women's History in America], second edition, p. 13. New York: Facts on File. . Julia Ward Howe served as president of the NEWSA until 1877. Lucy Stone was elected president that year and served until her death in 1893. Howe was again elected president in 1893 and served until her death in 1910.Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 4, p. 720Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 6, p. 278 Alice Stone Blackwell, Lucy Stone's daughter, was president from 1911 until the organization ceased to exist in 1920. When the Nineteenth Amendment, which secured suffrage for women, was ratified in 1920, the NEWSA simply ceased to function rather than formally dissolving.Stanton, Anthony, Gage, Harper (1881–1922), Vol. 6, pp. 267 footnote 1, 281 See also *Women's suffrage in the United States *List of major women's suffrage organizations *List of suffragists and suffragettes *List of women's rights organizations *Timeline of women's suffrage *Voting rights in the United States Notes References * Brown, Olympia (1911).

He is also an accomplished singer/songwriter and the leader of the LA-based band The Backboners. He currently resides in Los Angeles. Career Burnett's earliest career success was working with Patti LuPone and a dozen other significant Broadway talents in 1984 on \\"Hip Pocket Musicals\\", the pilot for a series of short musicals produced for PBS. He also starred as political folksinger Phil Ochs in a play (Small Circle of Friends) and later a film (Chords of Fame) which featured a veritable who's who of 60s activists and protest singers. Lupone also covered \\"I Regret Everything\\", a cheeky send- up of Edith Piaf's classic \\"Je Ne Regret Rien\\", penned by Burnett and his Hip Pocket writing mate Peggy Sarlin. The song has been covered by over 60 performers around the globe, most notably Bette Midler. Burnett refers to \\"I Regret Everything\\" as \\"the world's most obscure hit\\". 420x420px Burnett’s career as a singer/songwriter first took off when he and then-wife Suzy Williams formed a duo as The Boners in 1986 and performed regularly at Heather Woodbury's Cafe Bustelo in New York City. They also played with They Might Be Giants in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York City. Suzy and Burnett's witty melodic neo-cabaret folk-rock style culminated in “Our Show” held at the West Beth Theater. Their radio show for kids “The Flying Kitchen” aired in New York City. They toured with James Sewall and Sally Rousse in The New York Song and Dance Ensemble, performing at Lincoln Center. They have played the Sweet Chariot Music and Arts Festival in Swans Island, Maine every year since 1986. In 2004 Burnett and now-ex-wife Williams joined up with married couple Ginger Smith and Kahlil Sabbagh to expand The Boners into The Backboners, with four- part harmonies reminiscent of The Mamas & the Papas. Burnett's creative life expanded when he met Fred Seibert and Alan Goodman at their irreverent advertising agency/marketing think tank, Fred/Alan, Inc. Starting as a freelance writer for the agency, he later became Creative Director, generating groundbreaking satirical campaigns for MTV, Nick-at-Nite, Nickelodeon. and Comedy Central. Burnett came up with the name Comedy Central and wrote its original branding document. Burnett followed Fred Seibert to Hollywood to become VP Creative Director of Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, the venerable Hollywood studio. There he created campaigns in support of such breakthrough TV animation hits as Dexter's Lab, Powerpuff Girls and Courage the Cowardly Dog. He wrote the theme song and three special songs for Cave Kids, the series created for Flintstones kids Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm. He went on to become Head Writer/Story Editor for Cartoon Network's Cow and Chicken. He wrote stories and songs for the show, notably the musical two-part episode \\"The Ugliest Weenie\\". Following Seibert to Nickelodeon, Burnett became a Creative Producer on the new anthology series Oh Yeah! Cartoons. He wrote the show's theme song and wrote and produced, over ten animated shorts. Most notably, he and veteran animator Larry Huber co-created ChalkZone, which was picked up to go to series. ChalkZone was a combined brainstorm of Huber's idea about a boy with magic chalk and Burnett's idea about an alternative world behind the chalk board. It premiered on March 22, 2002 with the highest ratings for a new show premiere in the network's history at the time, and continued for five years with high ratings and a passionate following. Other shows Burnett created or co-created for Oh Yeah included \\"Hobart\\" and \\"Jelly's Day\\" (with Greg Emison), \\"Tutu the Superina\\" (with prima ballerina Sally Rousse), \\"What Is Funny?\\" (with Vince Waller) and \\"The Feelers\\". Burnett wrote all of the stories and musical numbers and provided singing and acting voices on many episodes. During this time, he also wrote the script, music and lyrics for The Electric Piper, a feature-length animated reimagining of the classic Pied Piper tale commissioned by Nickelodeon. In 2005, Burnett returned to Nickelodeon for the Oh Yeah! spinoff Random! Cartoons working with the Oh Yeah! team creating the short \\"Dr. Froyd's Funny Farm\\" with Jaime Diaz. He composed the scores for two other shorts: \\"Hornswiggle\\" (created by Jerry Beck) and the non-Random! Cartoons short \\"Gaucho Pampa\\" (also created by Diaz and produced by Huber). Since leaving Nickelodeon, Burnett has written for the PBS/Universal production Curious George (for which he received an Emmy citation), Danger Rangers, Guardians of the Power Masks, Woody Woodpecker, Casper, and a web series featuring singing dolls. Burnett is currently working on new animated shows that he is pitching to new content providers including Netflix, Bardel Entertainment and Russell Hicks' Curiosity Ink. He is also writing Broadway- friendly musicals, songs, and books for all ages.

It was worked intermittently between 1866 and 1958, then finally closed. The concrete headframe was reinforced in 1924. On 29 March 2001, the headframe was listed as a French national monument historique. et Background In 1830, a survey was conducted atop Bourlémont Hill, near the eventual site of the Sainte Marie Coal Mine, but no trace of coal was discovered. By the 1860s, the Stéphanien coal basin had been found, and the Saint-Charles, Saint-Joseph, Sainte- Pauline, and Sainte-Barbe mines were opened. Also ongoing at that time was the unsuccessful digging of the Saint-Georges pit. Mining In 1863, it was decided that the Saint-Charles mine should be replaced by a new mineshaft to be dug to its west. The limits of the Ronchamp basin were not yet known, and the new mine was located to the west, at the foot of Bourlémont. Digging of the 3.5-meter-diameter (11-foot) mineshaft was begun on 23 April 1864 and proceeded with the help of six horses and a steam winch. Workers completed the digging in two years, having found the coalfield at a depth of . The walls of the pit were constructed of Portland cement. At a depth of , workers discovered another, 60-centimetre layer of coal. When the digging eventually ceased, it had reached a depth of . The mine was dug in rough soil, but there was little water infiltration, unlike at most of the mines in the Ronchamp basin. The excavation cost a total of ₣172,157.93. Despite its small output, the site was developed with security systems and cages to carry the coal. Incidents The first steam-powered hoist caused problems because as it saw use beyond the initial digging, which was its only intended purpose. The hoist broke on 13 November 1866, trapping five miners underground; they were rescued using a winch the following day. Two years later, the hoist was replaced with a machine taken from the Notre-Dame mine, which had a steam break, gears, and a spool shaft. In January 1868 an extraction cage detached and damaged the guide ropes, which led to a two-week layoff for the miners. On 24 January 1868, the mine suffered a firedamp explosion that left eight dead and damaged of its structural timbers. After its closure the mine was filled with shale and topped with a concrete slab by Cotta. It had been planned that the headframe should be demolished, but because of strong community attachment to it as part of their heritage, it was saved in 1972 by Dr. Marcel Maulini, who went on to establish a museum of mining in Ronchamp.

Biography Senelle was born in the at that time still quite Flemish north Brussels suburb of Schaerbeek, and grew up in nearby Vilvoorde. He studied law at the Free University of Brussels before starting a legal career at the Brussels bar. After the liberation, in September 1944, he progressed, becoming in 1946 a judge at Leuven and, in 1947, a Courts-martial magistrate. In 1949 he became an auditor at the Council of State, which gave him the opportunity to extend his network of contacts in the county's legal establishment. Achille Van Acker became prime minister in 1954 and Senelle, a fellow socialist, became his deputy chief of staff, progressing during the government's four year term to become chief of staff himself. The government fell in 1958 and Robert Senelle's career moved to the University of Ghent where he was appointed professor of constitutional law. Over time he became one of the most prominent specialists in this field, and was later selected to supervise, for two years, the constitutional studies of the present king. Constitutional vision Senelle was a committed federalists, advocating the replacement of Belgium's ambiguous structure of regional and local powers with two principal federal states of (Dutch speaking) Flanders and (Francophone) Wallonia, each enjoying a large measure of autonomy over fiscal and social policy. The Brussels-capital region and the small German speaking region transferred to Belgium in 1919 should also receive clarified and enhanced levels of autonomy. Senelle found the extent of federal empowerment allowed under the existing structures was half-formed. It needed, for its completion, the additional transfers of constitutional powers to safeguard the future of Belgium. For the monarchy, he counseled rigid neutrality and minimal constitutional powers, but no diminution of status or prestige.

It is located in the Civic Center of San Francisco, California, in the United States. The statue depicting the Assyrian king of the same name was commissioned by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts and presented to the City of San Francisco in 1988 as a gift from the Assyrian people. The sculpture reportedly cost $100,000 and was the first \\"sizable\\" bronze statue of Ashurbanipal. It is administered by the City and County of San Francisco and the San Francisco Arts Commission. Parhad's work was met with some criticism by local Assyrians, who argued it was inaccurate to portray Ashurbanipal holding a clay tablet and a lion, or wearing a skirt. The critics thought the statue looked more like the Sumerian king Gilgamesh; Maureen Gallery Kovacs, a Yale Ph.D. who has translated The Epic of Gilgamesh (Stanford U.P., 1989), believed the sculpture depicted neither figure, but rather a Mesopotamian \\"protective figure\\". Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took artistic liberties. Background Possible representation of Enkidu as Master of Animals grasping a lion and snake, in an Assyrian palace relief, from Dur-Sharrukin, now Louvre In Assyrian sculpture, the famous colossal entrance way guardian figures of lamassu were often accompanied by a hero grasping a wriggling lion with one hand and typically a snake with the other, also colossal and in high relief; these are generally the only other types of high relief in Assyrian sculpture. They continue the Master of Animals tradition in Mesopotamian art, and may represent Enkidu, a central figure in the Ancient Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh. In the palace of Sargon II at Khorsabad, a group of at least seven lamassu and two such heroes with lions surrounded the entrance to the \\"throne room\\", \\"a concentration of figures which produced an overwhelming impression of power.\\"Frankfort, Henri, The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, pp. 147-148, 148 quoted, Pelican History of Art, 4th ed 1970, Penguin (now Yale History of Art), The arrangement was repeated in Sennacherib's palace at Nineveh.Russell, John M., Section 6. \\"c 1000–539 BC., (i) Neo-Assyrian.\\" in Dominique Collon, et al. \\"Mesopotamia, §III: Sculpture.\\" Grove Art Online, Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 19 November 2016, subscription required History Ashurbanipal was designed by Fred Parhad, an Iraqi-born artist of Assyrian descent. Parhad rejected formal arts studies at the University of California, Berkeley and relocated to New York, where the Metropolitan Museum of Art allowed him to study its Assyrian collection. The work was commissioned by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts under the direction of its president, Narsai David. The Assyrian Universal Alliance Foundation also claims to have commissioned the work. Funds were collected from Assyrians throughout the United States. In 1987, The Telegraph reported that the work cost $100,000 and was the first \\"sizable\\" bronze statue of Ashurbanipal. It was presented to the City of San Francisco as a gift from the Assyrian people on May 29, 1988, unveiled at the entry to the Asian Art Museum on Van Ness Avenue. The statue now stands on Fulton Street between the Main Library and Asian Art Museum, within the city's Civic Center. It is administered by the City and County of San Francisco and the San Francisco Arts Commission. The Smithsonian Institution lists Frank Tomsick as the installation's architect and MBT Associates as its architectural firm. Ashurbanipal was surveyed by the Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program in 1992. In 1996, plans for a Civic Center pedestrian mall were being developed by the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association; one planner advocated for construction of an Assyrian garden, including lotus blossoms, pomegranate trees and reeds, at the site of the statue. Description The patinated bronze statue, mounted on a base and a plinth to reach a total height of , weighs approximately . It depicts Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian king known for building the eponymously named Library of Ashurbanipal, the first and largest library in Nineveh. The bearded king is shown wearing earrings and a tunic; he is holding a clay tablet in one hand and restraining a lion cub against his chest with the other. According to the Historical Marker Database, the cuneiform inscribed on the tablet reads: \\"Peace unto heaven and earth / Peace unto countries and cities / Peace unto the dwellers in all lands / This is the statue presented to the City of San Francisco by the Assyrian people in the 210th year of America's sovereignty\\". The \\"larger-than-life\\", full length statue stands above a plinth adorned with a lotus blossom design and a concrete base with an anti-graffiti coating. The base includes rosettes and a bronze plaque. One inscription below the statue reads the text of the tablet in English, Akkadian cuneiform and Aramaic. The text \\"Ashurbanipal, King of Assyria, 669–627 B.C.\\" appears above and the text \\"Dedicated May 29, 1988\\" appears below, both in English. Another inscription below the statue reads, \\"Presented to the City of San Francisco by the Assyrian Foundation for the Arts through donations of American Assyrian Association of San Francisco / Assyrian American National Federation\\", followed by a list of names of donors. In December 2010, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that a large plaque from the sculpture was missing. Reception The statue, mounted on its base in front of the Asian Art Museum, in 2011 In December 1987, as news began to circulate about the commissioned work, local Assyrians accused Parhad of misrepresenting Ashurbanipal. Criticisms included the depiction of the king holding both a clay tablet and a lion, which they argued he \\"wouldn't do\\", and for dressing him in a skirt, which they claimed he would never have worn. The critics thought the statue made a better portrayal of the Sumerian king Gilgamesh. One critic said: > It's very simple. The statue represents Gilgamesh.... No Assyrian has a > right to imagine things about our king. It's exactly like making a copy of > the Statue of Liberty and saying it is George Washington.... Assyrian kings > didn't wear miniskirts. They wouldn't have been holding a lion or a book. > It's an insult to the Assyrians. Narsai David responded: > They are entitled to their opinion.... We have never said this is a museum- > quality reproduction.... We have always said this is a characterization of > Ashurbanipal as done by a 20th-century artist. If they choose to think of > this as Gilgamesh, they are free to do so. Maureen (Renee) Kovacs, a Yale Ph.D. who has translated The Epic of Gilgamesh (Stanford U.P., 1989), said the statue depicted neither Ashurbanipal or Gilgamesh, but rather a Mesopotamian \\"protective figure, like a guard.\\" Parhad defended the accuracy of his work, while also admitting that he took artistic liberties and attempted to incorporate the various aspects of Assyrian culture, from its hunting mastery to its admiration for writing. He said of the sculpture: > The piece has authentic qualities to it, but it is also my statue.... With > the earrings and the clothing and the hair and his daggers, it is > Ashurbanipal. But in the choice of (stance), the fact that he is holding a > tablet and a lion, that is mine. I wanted myself to be represented in the > piece.

Manley and colleagues identified and characterized the key factors responsible for polyadenylation of mRNA precursors, and elucidated how this remarkably complex machinery functions in gene regulation, for example during cell growth and differentiation. He has also studied the mechanism and regulation of the process by which introns are removed from mRNA precursors, mRNA splicing. Manley and his coworkers codiscovered the first alternative splicing factor (SR protein), characterized how this and other splicing regulatory proteins function and are themselves regulated, showed how alternative splicing can become deregulated in disease, and with respect to mechanism demonstrated that two spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs by themselves have catalytic activity. Finally, he elucidated unexpected links between these mRNA processing reactions and transcription, DNA damage signaling and maintenance of genomic stability. His work has thus provided considerable insight into the complex mechanisms that are essential for the regulated production of mRNAs in mammalian cells.  Career  Manley received a B.S. from Columbia University, Ph.D. from Stony Brook/Cold Spring Harbor Labs, and did postdoctoral work at MIT.

It starred Bonnie Hunt. Premise Bonnie Kennedy, a commercial actress who was jilted by her fiancé (George Clooney) shortly before the show started, moves back to Chicago to pick up the pieces of her life in an apartment across from Wrigley Field. The story focuses on Kennedy's struggles and the characters who live in her apartment building. Production notes Making heavy use of The Second City alum, the show had a theatrical sensibility wherein minor mistakes, accidents, and forgotten lines were often left in the aired episode, and there was a loose improv feel to certain scenes. The Building was the first sitcom production of David Letterman's Worldwide Pants production company; Letterman appears (unbilled) in a character role in the second episode. Hunt created the show, and wrote four of the five broadcast episodes. A sixth episode was produced, but did not air. Two years after this show was cancelled, cast members Hunt, Lake, Virtue and Wortell would return in the series The Bonnie Hunt Show. This follow-up series retained many of the distinguishing characteristics of The Building, including the Chicago setting, an improv/theatrical feel, and the essential nature of the character relationships between the principals (although they were playing different characters). As well, the follow-up series was produced by Worldwide Pants, written by Hunt, and mostly directed by John Bowab. Cast *Bonnie Hunt as Bonnie Kennedy.

History  The first draft for singers, mimes, dancers, and musicians was called Cry from Another Darkness; Partch completed it on December 30, 1964. The second draft, dated January 17, 1965, was a fuller, longer piece, re-titled Delusion of the Fury. It was originally conceived as a play in two acts, with a dramatic first act and a comedic second. Partch completed writing of the music on March 17, 1966. The piece employs Partch's original system of micro-tonality, and was written for the largest assembly of his custom-made instruments used in any of his works. The instruments were an important part of the stage set. Delusion of the Fury, directed by John Crawford, premiered at the UCLA Playhouse on January 9, 1969, where it was recorded for Columbia Records. Its next performance was in 2007 by the Japan Society in New York.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/arts/music/06part.html In 2013, Delusion of the Fury was staged for the first time in Europe at Ruhrtriennale in Northern Germany by Ensemble MusikFabrik, under the direction of Heiner Goebbels.http://archiv.ruhrtriennale.de/archiv/2013 This production toured to the Edinburgh International Festival in 2014. Delusion of the Fury received another performance in Paris as part of IRCAM's ManiFeste festival in the Grande halle de la Villette on June 18, 2016. Madeline Tourtelot produced and directed a film of the stage production, titled Delusion of the Fury: A Ritual of Dream and Delusion.  Background and structure  Act I of Delusion of the Fury is based on the Japanese Noh drama Atsumori, which tells the story of a warrior who has been slain in battle. His killer has traveled in remorse to the scene of the killing, so that he may repent. The dead warrior reappears as a ghost to the man. Then his son enters, searching in the belief that he may see a vision of his deceased father. The ghost-father is filled with resentment and lives again through the ordeal of the battle of his death. Eventually, faced with the uselessness of his anger, he seeks reconciliation with both his son and the slayer.http://www.the- noh.com/en/plays/data/program_008.html Act II is based on an Ethiopian folk tale, \\"Justice\\". The story is as follows: a young man is preparing a meal over a fire when an old goatherder approaches, searching for a lost kid goat. She asks the man if he has seen the kid. The man is deaf, does not understand the question, and subsequently gestures the old woman away. She misunderstands this as direction towards the location of the lost kid, wanders off, and finds it, and returns to offer thanks. Upon her return, the man grows angry and belligerent for being disturbed a second time, and a crowd gathers. The villagers force the two to consult with the Justice of the Peace, who is both deaf and myopic. In yet another misunderstanding, the judge takes the quarrel as a marital dispute, and orders the two to go home together with their 'child'. These stories illustrate the overarching theme of Delusion of the Fury: the delusory nature and futility of human anger, with the second including a critique of communal justice. Delusion of the Fury thus brings together tragedy and farce into one work, reminiscent of the ancient Greek tradition of following a tragedy with a satyr play. Critics say that Partch, who faced injustice and rejection from the society in which he worked and lived, may have offered this work as a gesture of self-admonishment, a way of confronting his own anger towards his world. Danlee Mitchell claimed that Delusion of the Fury was \\"Harry's reconciliation with the world.\\"  Track listing  References *Gilmore, Bob. Harry Partch: A Biography.

It is located in Cheratte, a section of the Belgian town of Visé in Liège province in Wallonia. The first shaft was dug in 1850 to extract dice coal and closed for the first time in 1877 following an accident. It reopened 30 years later in 1907 and operated until 1977. In the early 21st century the mine has gained some notoriety as an urban ruin. Remediation of the site and the demolition of several buildings start in 2017.  History  Commemorative plate This first shaft was dug in 1850 to a depth of 250 metres. After reviewing the mine to know its state, the engineers noticed that the coal was located deep down. The first mine was dug again and reached a depth of 420 metres. The place on which the mine is located is not very big. The extraction company decided to build a headframe, a first in Belgium. This tower was fitted with an extraction machine and several motors working with direct current.http://cheratte.net/joomla1.5/index.php?option=com_docman&task;=doc_view&gid;=46&tmpl;=component&format;=raw&Itemid;=6 A washhouse was built in 1920 by Beer de Jemeppe company, and a second extraction mine with a metal tower opened. In 1927, the Belle-Fleur minehttp://cheratte.net/joomla1.5/index.php?option=com_docman&task;=doc_view&gid;=148&tmpl;=component&format;=raw&Itemid;=6 was equipped by a little tower made of reinforced concrete and a low power winch. Its work was to bring the tailings back to the surface. A third mine and a headframe were built between 1927 and 1947. In 1938, the mine reached 313 metres in depth, but it only became operational in 1953. It was improved and reached 480 metres depth. The extraction machine at its top was insufficient. The engineer decided to install a machine on the floor, and to improve it. The n° 1 mine stopped the extraction and became a rescue mine. Then, its additional buildings were converted into showers and cloakrooms. The n° 2 mine was sealed off. In the 1930s, the site reached its apogee, employing 1,500 workers. When it closed on 31 October 1977, it employed more than 600 miners.

The coal shafts have varied industrial architectural designs, despite being constructed around the same time. The towers and the additional buildings of mine n° 1 were built with medieval architecture, whereas mine number two had a metal tower. The tower of mine n° 3 is the tallest of the site, and is built with reinforced concrete. It was originally built to host a machine at its top, but this machine was eventually built on the ground. The tower of Belle-Fleur mine was built on the same principle but is taller and has more typical architecture for the 1920s. Charbonnage du Hasard 19.JPGThe tower of shaft No. 1.

Conversion  The tower of shaft No. 1, in 2012 After its closure, the site was purchased cheaply by Mr Armand Lowie, a flemish real estate developer, who decided to dismantle it. However, decrees were published to protect the site in 1978, 1982 and 1992. In 1997, the Belle-Fleur tower underwent solidity control and is equipped again. In the early 21st century, the ruins have become known for the practice of urbex. Charbonnage du Hasard 09.JPGThe extraction machine of shaft No. 1.

In 2007, the Hasard mine was included in a Walloon Government rehabilitation programme to restore the facades and roofs of the Phalanstère, as well as the machine room and the wooded hill. The tower of mine n° 1 has been classified as a local heritage site since 1980. At the end of 2008, Mr Lowie filed a building permit for the demolition of the concrete tower of shaft no. 3 and ancillary buildings to replace them with housing and shops, but opposition was strong and the project was suspended. On 30 April 2013, after more than 30 years of controversy between the owners and the authorities, a notice of expropriation was recorded by the Minister Philip Henry and the site became public. The SPI is responsible for cleaning up the site with a budget 2,070,000 euro. A conversion plan is being prepared for the end of 2013, and unclassified parts of buildings will be demolished in October 2015. The site will then offer services to individuals and businesses.http://www.spi.be/upload/news/news2013/Vise_Charbonnage_Hasard.pdf  Ruins  In 2016, the installations of shafts no. 1 and 3 were in ruins, and the buildings of shaft no. 1 were classified as local heritage sites. The n° 2 shaft was destroyed, as well as several buildings around it. The no. 4 mine was well-preserved. Charbonnage du Hasard 17.JPGConcrete slab of shaft No. 1.

Each house had a sewer, tap water, electricity, and a garden. There was a hotel for single people in the town. It had 128 bedrooms and cost 1 Belgian franc per day. There was also a castle, which housed a medical room and the director's residence. On the closure of the mine, the company town was purchased and restored by a regional social housing company. 20131001 cheratte060.JPGThe castle. 20131001 cheratte024.JPGThe company town. 20131001 cheratte025.JPGThe company town. 20131001 cheratte019.JPGMemorials.

In particular it has been used to prove Maier's theorem and also the existence of chains of large gaps between consecutive primes . The method uses estimates for the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions to prove the existence of a large set of intervals where the number of primes in the set is well understood and hence that at least one of the intervals contains primes in the required distribution.  The method  The method first selects a primorial and then constructs an interval in which the distribution of integers coprime to the primorial is well understood. By looking at copies of the interval translated by multiples of the primorial an array (or matrix) of integers is formed where the rows are the translated intervals and the columns are arithmetic progressions where the difference is the primorial. By Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions the columns will contain many primes if and only if the integer in the original interval was coprime to the primorial. Good estimates for the number of small primes in these progressions due to allows the estimation of the primes in the matrix which guarantees the existence of at least one row or interval with at least a certain number of primes.

He was chairman of the art departments of The Cooper Union and Indiana State University, and Vice President and Provost of the Rhode Island School of Design. Throughout his career he lectured on art and subway graffiti. Among his professional affiliations Stewart was a board member, recording secretary, president, and president emeritus of New York Artists Equity Association, Inc.; board member, president, and president emeritus of The National Society of Mural Painters; board member and president of the Fine Arts Federation of New York; and in 1995 was elected an Academician of the National Academy, NYC, NY. In 2010 his papers were donated to the Smithsonian Archives of American Art. Style and technique Stewart wrote, \\"I'm doing what most artists have done historically; I've tried to find my own way in my own time. In my youth I was involved with Action Painting. However, I came to realize that was the way of the generation that preceded me and I turned away from it. Modernism is the art of one's time. While teaching in Greece in the early 1960s I became influenced by the post and lintel architecture of the ancients. Their influence persists in my compositions today. [Stewart directed the English- speaking division of the Athens Advanced School of Fine Arts in Mithymna on the island of Lesbos during the summers of 1963 and 1964.] \\"How you handle paint is the foundation of painting and I still benefit from my years of working as an Action Painter. Another important aspect of painting is how the surface is in tension with the implied depth. What I'm trying to do is stimulate the visual responses in the viewer from the excitement that occurs in the way I manipulate fields and the tension that the push and pull within the fields create.\\"Blue Hill Plaza, Blue Hill Cultural Center, Pearl River, NY, November 18, 1999 press release. Though Stewart had a thorough grounding in all aspects of techniques–sculpture, printmaking, watercolors, egg-tempera, oil, ceramic fresco, and mosaics–he adopted acrylics as a preferred medium in the early 1960s and experimented with them in a way that led to a kind of painting that is technically different from anything else. He would draw and/or paint in reverse with pastel, pencil, charcoal, and/or ink on an architectural vellum. The vellum was then applied to a primed canvas with a clear acrylic. When the acrylic dried the vellum was removed giving the new image a unique depth of field. The pursuit of tension and depth led to another unique medium. Stewart punctured the surface of the canvases and placed concave mirrors behind the openings, or on occasion he painted on a silver leaf surface, leaving the silver exposed to function like a mirror. He said, \\"Mirror paintings reconcile my effort to create the sensation of random movement in my paintings. The effect of this was to physically engage the observer with these paintings. As the observer moves, the light from the concave mirrors or silver leaf changes and the whole painting takes on new images and changes of colors that are created by the observer.\\" In 1985 Stewart was commissioned to paint Anodyne, his interpretation of the human brain. In an article about Anodyne in Il Giornale dell'Arte, artist/art critic Lucio Pozzi wrote: \\"What comes out of this, in my opinion, is one of the most monumentally important works of symbolist-precisionist painting of our time.\\"Pozzi, Lucio. \\"What's Happening in America? News from New York,\\" Il Giornale dell'Arte, N. 134, Giugno, 1995. Influences Cézanne, Tintoretto, Klimt Legacy Stewart's Ph.D. dissertation Mass Transit Art Subway Graffiti is the second known study of NYC subway graffiti that was investigated almost entirely from primary sources, the first being Craig Castleman's 1979 Columbia University doctoral dissertation, published in 1982 by MIT Press as Getting Up: Subway Graffiti in New York and in Spain by Capitan Swing as Hacerce Ver. In the fall of 1969 and the spring of 1970 graffiti started to appear on New York subway station walls and inside the cars, and that is when Stewart began to photograph and research this urban phenomenon. The thesis covers the beginning and the most important years of the movement. The most thoroughly and intensely studied period was the winter of 1972 through the spring of 1973 when Stewart unfailingly photographed every weekend in order to compile and identify the constantly changing, distinguishing characteristics as they were happening. Although he felt that subway graffiti had its golden age in 1973, he did continue photographing on a less vigorous schedule until about 1979. Stewart noted that unlike the immeasurable quantity of indistinguishable graffiti that preceded it, subway graffiti evolved in clearly traceable sequences. He said, \\"This suggests that the programmatic sequential development of concepts by a large number of graffiti writers might be compared to that which would be designated as a school of art, the school of Mass Transit Art.\\" During the early years he invited the graffiti writers to meet in his studio where they would all join in to discuss, critique, and embellish their graffiti stories as Stewart showed, slide-by-slide, the images he had taken since the last meeting. Abrams published the thesis in 2009 under the title Graffiti Kings: New York City Mass Transit Art of the 1970s. Sasha Frere-Jones wrote in The New Yorker: \\"Stewart began documenting graffiti as soon as it started. . . . Graffiti Kings: New York City Mass Transit Art of the 1970s is a reorganization of a dissertation by the late Jack Stewart, a New York artist who photographed the beginnings of New York graffiti and eventually befriended many of the writers. . . . Duncan Bock, editor-in-chief of Melcher Media, the firm that helped bring Graffiti Kings to a popular audience, described Stewart's work: 'Jack understood the intensity, beauty and importance of the tags, why they were on trains, and why it was so hard to do it well. . . . He understood that this formal act was revolutionary and, at that moment, nobody else in the world knew how to do it.' \\"Graffiti Kings is the best record of the month-by-month evolution of subway graffiti in the seventies, starting with the red subway cars that were largely retired by the eighties and moving through all the 'firsts' and stylistic phases: tags, outlines, masterpieces, 3-D letters, bubble letters, and the first attempts at what eventually became 'wild style.'\\"Frere-Jones, Sasha. The New Yorker, \\"Graffiti Kings\\" Book Party at Alphabeta, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, April 10, 2009.

The battle occurred on May 28, 1704, at Smolenice in Upper Hungary (present day Slovakia), where the Kuruc army routed the Habsburg forces, capturing the Austrian commander. For a short time, the rebels threatened the safety of Vienna, marauding through a number of villages in Lower Austria, Marchfeld, and Moravia.  Prelude  In April 1704, Miklós Bercsényi led an uprising among the Hungarian and Slovak peasants in Upper Hungary, promising freedom on behalf of Francis II Rákóczi. Bercsényi intended to defeat the army of the Austrian general Johann von Ritschan. General von Ritschan left Moravia with the aim of reaching Pressburg (present-day Bratislava).  Opposing forces  The Kuruc force had approximately 15,000 untrained fighters. Bercsényi commanded the light horsemen. He also commanded a small number of infantry, as well as a gathering of Slovak and Hungarian peasants who possessed only agricultural tools and obsolete rifles as weapons. Ritschan opposed Bercsényi's army with Imperial forces from Austria, Bohemia, Moravia, Denmark, and Germany. Although significantly outnumbered by the Kuruc forces, Ritschan's forces were highly trained and well-equipped. The Imperial army consisted of 2,331 infantry, 250 cavalry and 4 cannon, and was composed of the following units: * 473 infantry under von Deutschmeister from Vienna * 129 infantry under John Adolphus, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Plön * 625 infantry under Guido von Starhemberg * 468 infantry under Baron Georg Friedrich von Kriechbaum * 454 infantry under Jung-Daun * 182 Danish infantry under Colonel Leopold Maltzan * 150 Cuirassiers under Captain Giordani Visconti * 50 Cuirassiers under Graf Francis Taaffe * 50 Dragoons under Marquis Captain Joseph-Paul de Vaubonne The battle The Austrian army moved to Smolenice and camped there on the 26th of May to recuperate after crossing the Carpathian Mountains. Ritschan wanted to wait at Smolenice until reinforcements arrived from another Austrian-Royalist army under the command of János Wolfy. =The Imperial Army hesitates= Ritschan was not aware that the rebel Kuruc army was gathering in the forest; thus, he was unprepared for an attack. When the Kuruc attack occurred, Ritschan called a council and proposed an advance by Červený Kane, but Ritschan's officers—Colonel Maltzan, Captain Visconti, and Deutschmeister—all rejected his plan because the region was firmly controlled by the Kurucs. The officers feared for the safety of Moravia and Vienna. =The Kurucs attack= In the first stage of the battle, Brigadier László Ocskay and the Slovak rebels attacked Starhemberg's Austrian force, stopping Starhemberg's advance. The cavalry followed under Sandor Károlyi. Ocskay's Hussars were on alert near Smolenice because many Slovaks remained in the forests and the Kuruc infantry was on its way to Smolenice. =The Austrians counterattack= Ritschan launched a counterattack by the skirmishers, and the Kuruc fusiliers retreated to the woods. Then, 2,000 Kuruc horsemen arrived, pushing back the Austrian cavalry. Starhemberg's forces were confused by the surprise attacks; his commanders called von Deutschmeister's regiment and the Danish infantry. In this clash, von Deutschmeister forced the Kuruc cavalry to retire after an hour and a half of fighting. =Kuruc victory= Despite the success of the Austrian cavalry, the Kuruc surprise attacks had disrupted the Austrian army, which split in two. This allowed the Kuruc army to rout the Austrian, German, and Danish contingents one by one. Ritschan was wounded in the battle and tried to escape the encircling Kuruc forces by joining the Danish and Kierchbaum troops. Subsequently, the Danish contingent was caught. Ritschan had made a tactical error. After the success of von Deutschmeister's regiment, he concentrated on the defense of his camp and skirmishers; however, his soldiers were exhausted from crossing the mountains between Trnava and Jablonica. After surprising and disrupting the Austrians, the Kurucs were able to surround and defeat them. Ritschan and a small force escaped and reached Jablonica, but Ritschan himself was eventually captured.  Aftermath  = Casualties and captives = Several hundred soldiers in the Austrian army were killed and 700 were captured. The Hungarians lost 300–400 soldiers. = Further campaigns = After their success in the Battle of Smolenice, Ocskay invaded Moravia and Károlyi took Lower Austria. Leopold I was forced to cancel his vacation in Laxenburg. On June 9, 1704, Leopold's birthday, Károlyi's cavalry set fire to German and Croatian villages near Vienna. (At that time a few Chakavian Croatians lived in Lower Austria). Károlyi's men also destroyed the Imperial Zoo near Vienna. On June 10, Károlyi returned to Hungary with a significant haul of war spoils. Károlyi's and Forgách's armies tried to unite against Heister, but Heister defeated Forgách in the Battle of Koroncó. As a result, the victory near Smolenice became inconsequential and the Kurucs were defeated in Transdanubia. It was not until 1705, in the battle of Szentgotthárd, that the Kuruc general Bottyán the Blind regained the region.

History In the mid-2000s, each member of the collective had established himself as part of Michigan’s independent music scene. Knoxville and J-Fab gained national recognition following the success of Jim Jones’ Summer Wit’ Miami - produced by Knoxville. J-Fab was selected to produce on former Shady Records artist Stat Quo's debut album, Statlanta. The goal of The Olympicks’ partnership was to create a “one- stop shop” that could cater to the production needs of any artist or project based on the different qualities of each member. Knoxville is considered to be the team’s “crate-digger,” and produces a sound which tends to incorporate soul samples and breakbeats. J-Fab’s production technique also makes heavy utilization of record samples, but uses more pop and techno influences to create various sounds across multiple genres. Finally, Flawless crafts universal R&B;/Pop beats that are prevalent in today’s mainstream music. The Olympicks have worked with both established mainstream artists as well as local and underground artists.

Attack The prior demonstration and protests against the alleged border incursions by Pakistan Armed Forces culminated in the attack and ransacking of the premises. The protesters shattered windows, broke down doors, and set the Pakistan flag on fire. No one was injured. The High Commissioner Rustam Mohmand of Pakistan accused the Afghan government of being unable to police its own capital, demanding compensation and announcing the embassy would remain closed. After the incident, Afghan President Hamid Karzai officially apologised for the rampage and made a personal apology during a 25-minute conversation, stating that no such incident would happen again.

He is married to Ron Paul's granddaughter. Benton served as the campaign manager of Republican Mitch McConnell, until resigning on August 29, 2014 amid rumors surrounding campaign finance allegations during the 2012 presidential election.http://www.kentucky.com/2014/08/29/3402571_mitch-mcconnells-campaign- manager.html?rh=1 On August 5, 2015, Benton was indicted by a grand jury on charges arising from an alleged coverup to conceal the expenditure of campaign money to hire an Iowa politician. Four of the five charges were initially thrown out because of misconduct by the prosecutor.https://www.rollcall.com/news/multiple-charges-dismissed-jesse- benton Benton was found not guilty at trial on charges of making false statements.https://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/jesse-benton-acquitted- former-rand-paul-aide-215065 Over the objections of a former U.S. Attorney,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-paul/adviser-to-ron- and-rand-paul-found-not-guilty-in-bribery-case-idUSKCN0SH2GL20151023 Benton was subsequently re-indicted and was found guilty at a second trial of conspiring to cause false records to the Federal Election Commission. Benton was given two years probation.https://www.courier- journal.com/story/news/politics/2016/09/20/ron-paul-aides-facing-prison- time/90734522/ Career Benton's political career began in 2000 when he worked with the Republican National Committee. Benton has been involved with various political candidates and organizations, including the American Conservative Union, Americans for Tax Reform, the Liberty Coalition, the Performance Institute, and Louisiana Senator David Vitter. Benton opened his own political firm, CIC solutions, working mostly in Pennsylvania and Virginia. In 2007, Benton became involved with Ron Paul's 2008 presidential candidacy. Benton started out as a volunteer, being attracted by Paul's message on spending, civil liberties, and foreign policy, but eventually became Paul's communications director. After the end of Ron Paul's 2008 campaign, Benton joined the Campaign for Liberty, a political organization founded by Ron Paul to advocate for his political message. =Rand Paul campaign= In 2010, Benton served as Rand Paul's campaign manager when Paul was elected Senator of Kentucky. Benton simultaneously served as Ron Paul's political director. Rand Paul had never run for office before, and was seen as an underdog. Benton and Rand Paul became close, with the two speaking nearly every day and Benton moving into Paul's basement. Rand Paul's ultimately victorious campaign was praised for its use of the internet fundraising and recruiting, and Paul's ability to knock off a more established candidate was described by a Republican strategist as establishing a new norm for Republican primaries. =Ron Paul presidential campaign= After Rand Paul's election, Benton worked on Ron Paul's 2012 presidential campaign. During the campaign, Benton urged Paul's delegates at the 2012 Republican National Convention to act with \\"decorum and respect.\\" Benton has been criticized by some Ron Paul supporters who see Benton as being overly concerned with his own career, incompetent, and not truly a \\"hardcore Paulite.\\" Thomas Woods, an historian, political analyst, and former Ron Paul adviser, criticized Benton for what he saw as downplaying Ron Paul's libertarian ideals in order to earn \\"GOP respectability,\\" a notion echoed by other Paul supporters. In August 2012, conservative activist and former fired 2008 Ron Paul staffer Dennis Fusaro released emails and phone conversations that implicated Benton in being involved in an attempt to hire Iowa state senator Kent Sorenson in order to secure Sorenson's support of Ron Paul's presidential campaign. Sorenson initially worked for Michele Bachmann's candidacy, but switched his support to Paul, prompting Bachmann to accuse the Paul campaign of buying Sorenson. Sorenson resigned after a special investigator found it \\"manifestly clear\\" he violated Iowa Senate ethics rules by accepting money and then denying he'd done so. Fusaro then released a phone conversation regarding Benton's employment with the McConnell campaign, in which Benton said he was \\"sort of holding my nose for two years because what we're doing here is going to be a big benefit for Rand in 2016.\\" The incident was referred to on Twitter as \\"nosegate.\\" In response to Fusaro's actions, Benson stated, \\"\\"It is truly sick that someone would record a private phone conversation I had out of kindness and use it to try to hurt me. I believe in Senator McConnell and am 100 percent committed to his re-election. Being selected to lead his campaign is one of the great honors of my life and I look forward to victory in November of 2014.\\" The McConnell campaign stated that Benton would \\"absolutely\\" keep his job with the campaign. Although Paul was not nominated, Benton praised Paul's followers for helping to elect Paul supporters to positions of leadership within the GOP. =Mitch McConnell campaign= After the 2012 presidential election, Benton agreed to serve as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's campaign manager for his 2014 re-election campaign. In hiring Benton, McConnell hoped to avoid a Republican primary from a conservative challenger, although Tea Party Republican Matt Bevin would ultimately challenge McConnell. The move was notable as McConnell had endorsed Paul's 2010 Republican primary opponent, Trey Grayson, and McConnell represented the \\"establishment\\" wing of the Kentucky Republican party while Benton's background was in \\"grassroots\\" advocacy. The move, which was followed by Rand Paul endorsing McConnell's re-election, began a political alliance between the two Republican Senators from Kentucky. Benton views his working with McConnell as part of a goal to unite different factions of Republicans, saying that \\"it's a really, really important mission to bring all Republicans and conservatives together.\\" Benton helped Rand Paul gain McConnell's approval of Paul's noted filibuster of future CIA Director John O. Brennan, in which Paul criticized the Obama Administration's use of combat drones. Benton resigned his post as Mitch McConnell's campaign manager in August 2014 when details of a campaign filing scandal from Paul's 2012 presidential campaign came to light. In March 2016, Benton was hired by the pro-Trump \\"Great America\\" super PAC. Political views Benton has described himself as both a political operative and activist. Benton views his role as helping to bring the \\"voice\\" of the Tea Party into a governing coalition. Benton is an adherent of the Austrian School of Economics, believing that \\"The market can always do better. Ultimately the market is the best way to provide things to society.\\" Benton has contributed money to Ron Paul, Rand Paul, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Kurt Bills, the National Republican Congressional Committee, and the Louisville and Jefferson County Republican Executive Committee. In 2013, Benton sent out an email that claimed that Barack Obama wanted to create a national gun registration system; the claim was criticized by The Washington Post's fact- checker. Indictment Benton was indicted for allegedly concealing over $70,000 in payments to Iowa State Sen. Kent Sorenson to convince Sorenson change his employment from Michele Bachmann to Ron Paul, a longtime Texas congressman. The indictment charged Benton and two other defendants with conspiracy, causing false records to obstruct a contemplated investigation, causing the submission of false campaign expenditure reports, concealing these payments from the Federal Election Commission and the FBI, and perjury. All but one of the charges against Benton were thrown out by an Iowa judge for proprietorial misconduct, and he was acquitted at trial of the only remaining charge.  Conviction  The government was able re-indict Benton on the dismissed charges, and he stood for a second trial. On May 5, 2016, a federal jury in Des Moines found Benton guilty of four federal crimes: conspiracy, causing false records, causing false campaign expenditure reports and making false statements. Campaign managers Jesse Benton, John Tate and Demetrios Kesari were all found guilty of covering of conspiracy. Benton was sentenced to two years probation. Personal life Benton is a Philadelphia native and an alumnus of Mary Washington College, where he was an economics major and played rugby. Benton is married to Ron Paul's granddaughter, Valori Pyeatt, and they have a daughter, Caroline. The two met when Benton arranged for Pyeatt to do an interview as part of Paul's presidential campaign. In addition to doing interviews for the Paul campaign, Pyeatt has also helped to organize fundraising receptions. Pyeatt is the daughter of Ron Paul's daughter Lori Pyeatt, who has also worked on the Ron Paul campaign.

He was the son of Bartholomew II Ghisi. In 1326/27, as part of his father's rapprochement with the Catalans of the Duchy of Athens, George married Simona of Aragon, the daughter of the Catalan vicar-general Alfonso Fadrique. As Simona's dowry, the Ghisi received half the castellany of the Castle of Saint Omer in Thebes, which they held until its destruction in c. 1331/34. Bartholomew II died in 1341, and George succeeded him. In 1343, at the request of Pope Clement VI, he armed a galley conjointly with John I Sanudo (duke of Naxos) and Balzana Gozzadini (regent of the two other thirds of Negroponte) to join the first Smyrniote crusade. According to Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, his disappearance from the sources after the events of 1344/45 could suggest that he may have participated in person and died in the fighting, as did the leaders Henry of Asti, Martino Zaccaria and the Venetian admiral Pietro Zeno.Loenertz, Raymond- Joseph (1975).

Early Life Young was born on 17 December 1863 in Scotland. He was the son of a Glasgow merchant and shipowner. His nephew, Sir Arthur Young, was a Member of Parliament and former Chamberlain of the King's Household. He was educated at the University of Glasgow where he studied law, was the captain of the University rugby team and played for Glasgow in an inter-city rugby match. He graduated MA in 1883 and LLB in 1887. Career He apprenticed with Glasgow solicitors A. J. & A. Graham before moving to the United States in 1890. In 1894, he began the practice of public accounting in Chicago with C. W. Stuart under the firm name Stuart & Young. In 1903, he helped secure the passage of the first C.P.A. law in Illinois and later served as president of the Illinois Society of Certified Public Accountants. In 1906, he bought out Stuart's interest in the firm and together with his brother Stanley Young, founded the accountancy firm Arthur Young & Co. in Chicago. In 1924 Young innovated by forging an international network with Broads Paterson & Co in the UK. He retired shortly after that and died in 1948. Personal life In 1917, he moved from Chicago to New York City, where he resided at 815 Park Avenue on Manhattan's Upper East Side. In 1927, he purchased \\"Crossways,\\" a pre-1860 Late Victorian-style residence on South Boundary Street in Aiken, South Carolina from Dr. H. J. Ray for $40,000. The home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Young, who never married, was \\"remembered in a social setting for his loose fitting tweed clothes from Whitaker & Company in London, pipe smoking and martinis, elaborate meals at Aiken with his cook Margaret Beckford, and his many dogs.\\" He died at his residence in Aiken on 3 April 1948. He was buried at Bethany Cemetery in Aiken. His memoirs, entitled Arthur Young and the Business he Founded, were privately printed in 1948 by J. C. Burton and published by Merrymount Press in Boston.

This started the process that led to the depopulation of the indigenous peoples in Brazil, because of disease and violent treatment by European settlers, and their gradual replacement with colonists from Europe and Africa. This process has been described as a genocide, and continues into the modern era with the ongoing destruction of indigenous peoples of the Amazonian region. Over eighty indigenous tribes were destroyed between 1900 and 1957, and the overall indigenous population declined by over eighty percent, from over one million to around two hundred thousand. The 1988 Brazilian Constitution recognises indigenous peoples' right to pursue their traditional ways of life and to the permanent and exclusive possession of their \\"traditional lands\\", which are demarcated as Indigenous Territories.Federal Constitution of Brazil. Chapter VII Article 231. In practice, however, Brazil's indigenous people still face a number of external threats and challenges to their continued existence and cultural heritage. The process of demarcation is slow—often involving protracted legal battles—and FUNAI do not have sufficient resources to enforce the legal protection on indigenous land. Since the 1980s there has been a boom in the exploitation of the Amazon Rainforest for mining, logging and cattle ranching, posing a severe threat to the region's indigenous population. Settlers illegally encroaching on indigenous land continue to destroy the environment necessary for indigenous peoples' traditional ways of life, provoke violent confrontations and spread disease. Peoples such as the Akuntsu and Kanoê have been brought to the brink of extinction within the last three decades. On 13 November 2012, the national indigenous peoples association from Brazil APIB submitted to the United Nation a human rights document with complaints about new proposed laws in Brazil that would further undermine their rights if approved. Several non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been formed due to the ongoing persecution of the indigenous peoples in Brazil, and international pressure has been brought to bear on the state after the release of the Figueiredo Report which documented massive human rights violations. The abuses have been described as genocide, ethnocide and cultural genocide.  Affected tribes  In the 1940s the state and the Indian Protection Service (Serviço de Proteção aos Índios, SPI) forcibly relocated the Aikanã, Kanôc, Kwazá and Salamái tribes to work on rubber plantations. During the journey many of the indigenous peoples starved to death, those who survived the journey were placed in an IPS settlement called Posto Ricardo Franco. These actions resulted in the near extinction of the Kanôc tribe. The ethnocide of the Yanomami has been well documented, there are an estimated nine thousand currently living in Brazil in the Upper Orinoco drainage and a further fifteen thousand in Venezuela. The NGO Survival International has reported that throughout the 1980s up to forty thousand gold prospectors entered Yanomami territory bringing diseases the Yanomami had no immunity to, the prospectors shot and destroyed entire villages, and Survival International estimates that up to twenty per cent of the people were dead within seven years. The Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, whose territory has been protected by law since 1991, saw an influx of an estimated 800 people in 2007. The tribal leaders met with the civil authorities and demanded the trespassers be evicted. This tribe, initially contacted in 1981, saw a severe decline in population after disease was introduced by settlers and miners. Their numbers are now estimated at a few hundred.  Portuguese colonization  During the Portuguese colonization of the Americas, Cabral made landfall off the atlantic coast. Over the following decade the indigenous Tupí, Tapuya and other tribes which lived along the coast suffered large depopulation due to disease and violence. A process of miscegenation between Portuguese settlers and indigenous women also occurred.Darcy Ribeiro – O Povo Brasileiro, Vol. 07, 1997 (1997), pp. 28 to 33; 72 to 75 and 95 to 101. It is estimated that of the 2.5 million indigenous peoples who had lived in the region which now comprises Brazil, less than 10 per cent survived to the 1600s. The primarily reason for depopulation was diseases such as smallpox that advanced far beyond movement of European settlers.  State reaction  In 1952 Brazil ratified the genocide convention and incorporated into their penal laws article II of the convention. While the statute was being drafted, Brazil argued against the inclusion of cultural genocide, claiming that some minority groups may use it to oppose the normal assimilation which occurs in a new country. According to professor of law at Vanderbilt University Larry May, the argument put forward by Brazil was significant, but cultural genocide should not be cast aside, and this type of genocide should be included within the definition of genocide. In 1967 public prosecutor, Jader de Figueiredo Correia, submitted the Figueiredo Report to the dictatorship which was then ruling the country. The report, which ran to seven thousand pages, remained hidden for over forty years. Its release caused an international furore. The rediscovered documents were examined by the National Truth Commission, which was tasked with the investigations of human rights violations which occurred in the periods 1947 through to 1988. The report reveals that the SPI had enslaved indigenous people, tortured children and stolen land. The Truth Commission was of the opinion that entire tribes in Maranhão were completely eradicated and in Mato Grosso, an attack on thirty Cinturão Largo left only two survivors (the \\"Massacre at 11th Parallel\\"). The report also states that landowners and members of the SPI had entered isolated villages and deliberately introduced smallpox. Of the one hundred and thirty four people accused in the report the state has as yet not tried a single one. The report also detailed instances of mass killings, rapes, and torture. Figueiredo stated that the actions of the SPI had left the indigenous peoples near extinction. The state abolished the SPI following the release of the report. The Red Cross launched an investigation after further allegations of ethnic cleansing were made after the SPI had been replaced. In 2014, Volume II, Chapter 5 of the official Report of the National Truth Commission acknowledged the deaths of at least 8,000 indigenous people during the period under investigation and made 13 recommendations to redress the situation, beginning with a public apology from the Brazilian State to the indigenous peoples, and including \\"creation of a specific truth commission for indigenous issues; a commemorative date for the events that occurred; the creation of museums; production of didactic and audiovisual material to be shared in schools, on television, and on the internet; the implementation of actions to preserve the culture of indigenous peoples; delivery of all kinds of documents from the dictatorship to these peoples; and the return of territories taken from them\\".:137 Few, if any, of these recommendations have been implemented. In 1992 a group who had been prospecting for gold were tried for the attempted genocide of the Yanomami tribe. A report from an anthropologist, which was submitted as evidence during the trial, stated that the prospectors' entry into Yanomami territory had an adverse effect on their lives, as the prospectors carried diseases. They had also contaminated the rivers which the Yanomami used as a source of food. The UN reported that thousands of the Yanomami have been killed as the Brazilian government failed to enforce the law and that, even after though the Yanomami peoples' territory had been demarcated, the state had not provided the necessary resources to stop the illegal incursion of gold prospectors. These prospectors have caused massive forest fires which have led to the destruction of extensive areas of both croplands and rainforest.  International reaction  At the 1992 Earth Summit in Brazil the Kari-Oka Declaration and the Indigenous Peoples Earth Charter were presented by the representatives of indigenous peoples from around the world. The Kari-Oka Declaration states \\"We continue to maintain our rights as peoples despite centuries of deprivation, assimilation and genocide\\". The declaration also asserted that the genocide convention must be amended so as to include the genocide of indigenous peoples. The International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs (IWGIA) was founded in 1968 in response to the genocide of indigenous peoples in Brazil and Paraguay, and in 1969 Survival International was founded in London as a response to the atrocities, theft of land and genocide occurring in the Brazilian Amazon. In 1972 anthropologists from Harvard University founded Cultural Survival. The World Bank has been subject to criticism over loans which have been used to help fund the dislocation of indigenous peoples and environmental destruction. The Polonoreste project caused wholesale deforestation, ecological damage on a wide scale, as well as the forced relocation of indigenous communities. The project led to an international campaign that resulted in the World Bank suspending loans.

At approximately 4:30 am local time, a fire originating in the immigration section of Unit I (used for international departures) rapidly spread to adjoining Unit II, which is used for international arrivals. The construction of the building (it was completed in 1978), a roof collapse in Unit I, and heavy traffic in the area hindered initial efforts to extinguish the blaze. Initial media reports showed some firefighters using buckets to fight the fire. Several groups, including the Kenya Army and firefighters from private companies, assisted in fighting the fire. After six hours, on-scene officials indicated that the fire had been contained. After the fire had been extinguished, businesses affected by the fire reported that items were missing from their businesses. Various reports indicated that first responders had looted fire-damaged businesses during and after the fire, leading some to believe that the fire could have been put out sooner had all the firefighters kept their focus on extinguishing the blaze. Tourists who were displaced by the fire also reported that they were assaulted by thugs who blocked access to the main gate, where the tourists were attempting to retrieve their belongings. Victims A spokesman for Kenya Airways, the primary tenant at the airport, indicated that two of its employees had been transported to a local hospital for observation. One of the individuals was treated for smoke inhalation. There were no immediate reports of injuries to firefighting personnel or other airport employees. Investigation After the fire was extinguished, a preliminary investigation was started. Possible terrorism was an initial concern because the fire occurred on the fifteenth anniversary of the terrorist bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania plus the fact that Kenya has been involved in an armed conflict with Al-Shabaab in neighboring Somalia. Investigators, however, soon ruled out terrorism as the cause of the fire. Aftermath Post-fire damage to the exterior of the terminal building. Following the fire, temporary tents were established on the apron to handle international arrivals. Photo taken approximately 2 weeks after the fire. The international arrival and departure units were completely destroyed in the fire. Airport officials have elected to use Unit III (used for domestic arrivals and departures) to handle some international traffic. Operations were partly reestablished on . A new unit (Unit IV) is under construction and was scheduled to open in August 2013, but the new unit was opened on 1 July 2014 and renamed as Terminal 1A. Unit IV was not damaged in the fire.

The film is based on Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig's 1935 biography, Mary Stuart, a long-term bestseller in Germany and France but out of print in the UK and the US for decades until 2010. The film was first screened at the 2013 International Film Festival Locarno and was later shown at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Plot Mary, Queen of Scots, awaits her execution by order of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Mary composes a letter to Elizabeth, to whom she feels a close kinship as her cousin and a fellow female monarch. Through flashback, Mary narrates to Elizabeth the events of her life, starting from her birth in Scotland to the French Mary of Guise, who sends her to France as a child for her protection. Mary is raised in French court, where she had for companions her Scottish ladies Mary Beaton, Mary Seton, Mary Fleming and Mary Livingston, as well as the Italian musician David Rizzio. Upon reaching adulthood Mary is married to the Dauphin, Francis, who becomes King of France when his father dies. News arrives that Queen Mary I of England has died and her sister, Elizabeth, has become Queen despite her official status as a bastard. Mary is aware of her own legitimate claim to the English throne; although she writes to Elizabeth promising not to challenge her, she insists on using the English coat of arms and the title \\"Queen of France, Scotland and England\\". After Francis's early death, Mary returns to Scotland with her ladies and Rizzio. There, she is treated with suspicion and skepticism by her half-brother, Lord Moray, the Protestant clergyman John Knox and other Scottish lords. Mary struggles to ingratiate herself to them, but ends up isolating herself further by relying on Rizzio for political advice, marrying Englishman Darnley without the Lords' consent, and supporting the controversial Scottish border Lord Bothwell. Mary's love for Darnley fades when she learns of his extremism in pursuing the English throne; Mary has strong affection for Elizabeth, and wants to be her heir instead of usurping her. Darnley conspires with Moray and the Scottish Lords to murder Rizzio in cold blood in front of a heavily pregnant Mary. Afterwards Mary begins to see visions of Rizzio, who warns her of worse things to come. Mary gives birth to her and Darnley's heir, James, but she is effectively separated from Darnley and has a new passion for Bothwell, with whom she has an affair. Soon afterward Darnley is killed in a gunpowder explosion, and Mary marries Bothwell because she is pregnant with his child. The marriage is heavily protested, with the Scottish Lords taking up arms against Mary and Bothwell. Eventually Mary and Bothwell are outnumbered, and Bothwell flees from Scotland while Mary travels to England in the hopes of getting protection from Elizabeth. Instead, Elizabeth has Mary incarcerated, and decades later Mary is executed by order of the cousin she has never met.

Sandrine Marques, le Monde: \\"Thomas Imbach adapts Marie Stuart by Stefan Zweig. The encounter between the director's work and that of the Austro- Hungarian writer is obvious from the tortuous currents that run through his films. But where it was expected that madness would infuse each shot with the same dark matter from which the novel is made, Thomas Imbach chooses the stylistic and narrative blueprint. It is through skillfully composed and superbly illuminated shots that he tells the story of this Queen of Scotland, with a tragic destiny.\\".

The leading roles are played by Tushar Dalvi, Supriya Vinod, Sulbha Deshpande, Sanjay Mone, Sandeep Pathak, Bhagyashri Pane, Praharsh Naik, Soham Kolvankar and Milind Phatak who are prominent actors from the Indian film industry. The director of photography is Amol Gole, the sound design is handled by Shantanu Akerkar and Dinesh Uchil with Madhav Vijay providing the background score. Synopsis Investment tells the story of a typical ‘upwardly mobile’ couple: Aashish, an ambitious young man, about to change his job to join an American firm, and his wife Prachi, who is encouraging and eager to move into a higher class of society. (This couple is indicative of the young people in urban areas thriving to achieve more, albeit at cost of social values). The couple has a twelve-year-old son, Sohel, who is being brought up with much care and with a dream of raising a successful Politician of the Future, a field which they believe is promising due to its lucrative opportunities of growth, power and finance. Sohel is a rather spoilt & self-centered brat who believes and follows his father's motto of ‘always getting what he wants’. He sends a love note to his classmate Deepa Gangan who hails from a totally different social strata and her father informs Ashish and Prachi to keep their son at bay. Deepa is found missing and Sohel claims that he is unaware of her whereabouts. Deepa’s dead body is found by the police the next day. From this point forward in the film the issues of morality of different characters comes to the fore with the resolution of the crime while testing and making a remark on the materialistic point of view with which today's generation is approaching moral values. The aftermath represents the slow but sure criminalization accompanied by the total lack of regret of the educated young middle-class, with subsequent disregard for moral values, and thus forms the terribly realistic & therefore shocking climax of the film.

The story, when published received enormous positive response due to the unusually realistic & uncompromising treatment that made the reader identify with it. Many prominent theatre and Film personalities approached the Writer, Ratnakar Matkari, for rights to convert the story into a film, but he refused as he himself wanted to make the film based on the story. The story was adapted for the film by 2006 when the screenplay was ready. While researching the most appropriate way of making this film Ratnakar Matkari and Associate Director Ganesh Matkari met Amol Gole, who is considered as one of the recent prominent discovery in the Digital media and has to his credit critically acclaimed films like Stanley Ka Dabba, Gajar, Ha Bharat Maza. He was excited to work on the film and readily agreed to shoot the film. The technical aspects were all tied up but the finance was yet to be tied. Miraculously around this time the Producers met Mandar Vaidya and Anish Joshi through a mutual acquaintance and they agreed to finance the film as co-producers. The entire film is shot digitally in one schedule and the shooting time for the schedule was 21 days in Mumbai.

John Gairdner 45 Northumberland Street (centre) Life The grave of Dr John Gairdner, New Calton Burial Ground, Edinburgh He was the eldest son of Captain Robert Gairdner of the Bengal artillery, and brother of William Gairdner, born at Mount Charles, near Ayr, on 18 September 1790. When he was five years old his father was killed by the kick of a horse. He received his school education at Ayr Academy, and after he moved with his family to Edinburgh in 1808, studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, receiving his MD in 1811. He spent the winter of 1812 in London, studying anatomy under Charles Bell. In 1813 Gairdner went into practice in Edinburgh in partnership with Dr Farquharson. In the same year he became a fellow of the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and four years later began to act as examiner for the College. For many years he was the College's treasurer, and later he was president from 1830 to 1832. This appointment gave him a seat in the unreformed town council of Edinburgh. The election for the parliament of 1831 was entirely in the hands of the town council, and Gairdner, a reformer, seconded the nomination of Francis Jeffrey, Lord Advocate. The majority of the council, however, disregarded a petition presented to them and elected Robert Adam Dundas. They departed through back streets, while a mob attacked the Lord Provost and threatened to throw him over the North Bridge. In the 1830s he was living in the centre of the Edinburgh's New Town at 18 Hill Street. With his friend William Wood, Gairdner supported a move allowing medical students at the University of Edinburgh the right to receive professional training from extra-academical lectures. He also gave evidence before parliamentary committees in London, on behalf of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, in the efforts made to secure a legal status for licensed practitioners of medicine and surgery extending throughout the UK, ahead of the Medical Act 1859. Gairdner joined a small group of Unitarians, and this was thought to have hampered his career. He was involved in setting up of a new Unitarian chapel in Edinburgh. He later returned to the Church of Scotland. Gairnder died at home, 45 Northumberland StreetEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1875 in Edinburgh on 12 December 1876, at the age of 86. He is buried in New Calton Burial Ground in east Edinburgh. The grave lies against the north wall. His father-in-law David Tennant of Ayr Academy (1751-1835) is also buried there.Inscription on the tomb of John Gairdner Works Gairdner wrote in Transactions of the Medico-Chirurgical Society of Edinburgh, and in the medical journals, almost to the end of his life. He also published two lectures, one on the history of the Edinburgh College of Surgeons, the other on the early history of the medical profession in Edinburgh. He published in his later years a Calendar printed on cardboard, with a cardboard slide, for the verification of dates. Robert Burns and the Ayrshire Moderates (1883) was published after Gairdner's death. It reprinted anonymous letters in The Scotsman on Robert Burns. Family In 1817 Gairdner married his cousin Susanna Tennant (d.1860), a granddaughter of Dr William Dalrymple of Ayr. Together they had two daughters and three sons. He survived his wife by 16 years, and he was survived by his children. His sons were William Tennant Gairdner, Professor of Medicine at the University of Glasgow and archivist and historian James Gairdner.

But the Italian courts convicted Rancadore in 1999 in absentia of being part of a criminal organisation and was sentenced to seven years in jail.  England  After he moved to England in 1993, Rancadore opened a travel agency with his wife. While English authorities were aware that Rancadore was in London they were unable to arrest him because, unlike Italy, in England, Mafia association is not a crime. Italian authorities asked for his extradition to Italy in January 2012, which was denied by the British authorities. According to Vittorio Teresi from the prosecution office in Palermo: \\"The crime of Mafia association is not recognised in the British legal system. The extradition request was not even considered.\\"  Arrest  Rancadore was arrested on 7 August 2013 in Manor Waye, Uxbridge, London. When he saw the police, he left his house via a back door in an attempt to escape but was apprehended by a waiting policeman. After he was captured, a new arrest warrant was made, as Rancadore's lawyers claimed that the previous warrant contained \\"significant deficiencies\\". Rancadore was arrested following a European arrest warrant being issued. = Trial = Rancadore was denied bail by a judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court and had an extradition hearing set for 25 November 2013.

On February 28, 2014 the extradition hearing was adjourned until Monday March 17,http://www.the-news-daily.com/mafia-boss-s-uk_140142 when it was determined at Westminster Magistrates' Court that Rancadore would not be extradited back to Italy. District judge Howard Riddle said a recent decision of the Administrative Court, which binds lower courts in England, led to his decision.BBC News, 'Domenico Rancadore: Mafia boss wins extradition battle' 17 March 2014 www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-26612261 = Concerns = Rancadore raised concerns that if he was extradited back to Italy, he would be killed by the Mafia.

It involved a 9,000 strong army, which consisted of Crimean Tatars and a unit of Zaporozhian Cossacks loyal to Petro Doroshenko, and a pro-Polish regiment of Cossack Hetman Mykhailo Khanenko. The forces met near Ladyzhyn, which at that time was called Ładyżyn. Since Khanenko’s regiment numbered only 4,000 soldiers, he asked for help from the Castellan of Podlasie, Karol Luzecki, with 2,500 cavalry and dragoons. Khanenko and Luzecki joined forces on July 18, and marched towards the village of Czetwertynowka. Their army consisted of a traditional Cossack tabor in the center, Polish cavalry on both sides, and dragoons in the back. After a small skirmish, a Cossack unit loyal to Doroshenko was pushed beyond the Boh river. Polish cavalry continued the advance, but the opponent counterattacked, which resulted in heavy Polish losses. The skirmish, due to the efforts of Khanenko and Luzecki, ended in Polish victory, but it was costly, as the losses were very high.
