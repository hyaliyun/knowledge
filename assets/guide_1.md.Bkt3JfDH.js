The inscription is number B 257 in the Bryggen inscriptions numbering and in the corresponding Rundata project, and P 6 in McKinnell, Simek and Düwel's collection.John McKinnell, Rudolf Simek and Klaus Duwel, Runes, Magic and Religion: A Sourcebook, Studia Medievalia Septentrionalia, 10 (Vienna: Fassbaender, 2004), pp. 131-32 [P 6]. It is thought to date from the fourteenth century.1380×90 according to John McKinnell, Rudolf Simek and Klaus Duwel, Runes, Magic and Religion: A Sourcebook, Studia Medievalia Septentrionalia, 10 (Vienna: Fassbaender, 2004), p. 131; but an earlier fourteenth-century date was proposed by the chief excavator: Lorenzo Lozzi Gallo, 'On the Interpretation of ialuns in the Norwegian Runic Text B257', Arkiv för nordisk filologi, 116 (2001), 135-51 (p. 135), http://journals.lub.lu.se/index.php/anf/article/view/11627. Text The stave is four-sided, with text on each side, but one end is missing, leaving the text of each side incomplete. As normalised and edited by McKinnell, Simek and Düwel, and 'somewhat tentatively' translated by Hall, the charm reads:John McKinnell, Rudolf Simek and Klaus Duwel, Runes, Magic and Religion: A Sourcebook, Studia Medievalia Septentrionalia, 10 (Vienna: Fassbaender, 2004), pp. 131-32 [P 6]; Alaric Hall, Elves in Anglo-Saxon England: Matters of Belief, Health, Gender and Identity, Anglo-Saxon Studies, 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2007), p. 134. In the view of McKinnell, Simek and Düwel, : it is by no means certain that the inscriptions on all four sides of this stick belong to the same charm. A and B look like part of a protective charm against demons, while C and D seem to be love-magic of the most forbidden kind. However, it remains possible that they represent two contrary aspects of the same spell - a blessing if the woman gives her love to the carver combined with a curse if she refuses it. They point out that the addressee of side D is a woman, on account of the feminine form sjalfri.John McKinnell, Rudolf Simek and Klaus Duwel, Runes, Magic and Religion: A Sourcebook, Studia Medievalia Septentrionalia, 10 (Vienna: Fassbaender, 2004), p. 132.

The MpB was born in the summer of 2006 from a group of militants of the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG), critical with the political line of the organization at the time. History =Origins= The participation of the BNG in a government with the Galician Socialist Party (PSdG) in the Xunta de Galicia created a critical current in the nationalist front. Some members of the BNG felt that the political line and tha actions of the party deviated from the historical principles of the organization. The same happened in the youth of the BNG, Galiza Nova, where Isca! appeared as a critical organization. In 2006 finally several militants of the Galician People's Union decided to leave that party to create a new organization within the BNG, under the name of Movemento pola Base (MpB). They were joined by independent militants of the BNG (not attached to any internal group or party) militants and members off the Confederación Intersindical Galega in the comarcas of Ferrolterra, Compostela and Vigo, among them Antolín Alcántara,Leader of the Confederación Intersindical Galega- Metal federation. Fermín Paz, [Manuel Mera and Ramiro Oubiña, who were part of the executive of the CIG. The MpB presented then its own candidacy to the National Council of the BNG, that was chosen in the XII National Assembly of the BNG. The list was headed by Fermín Paz and Paula Castro, and finally got 245 votes (9.32% of the total) and 5 representatives in the National Council. The MpB criticized what they considered a drift towards homogeneity in the BNG. On 28 October 2007, the MpB formally constitutes itself as a political organization, being defined ideologically as \\"independentist\\" and socialist and as a working class organization. =Rupture of the MpB= Between the months of December 2008 and January 2009 this current split between those in favor of creating a new political formation outside of the BNG and those who advocated to continue within that front. It was also an important element in the division the role of MpB in the CIG and its relations with the UPG within this union. The two factions claimed their legitimacy and the use of the name Movemento pola Base. The faction that used as its communication channel the website polabase.net held a national assembly on February 7, 2009 where it was decided to abandon the BNG as the electoral platform of the organization and expressed the need for a new sovereigntist organization with presence in the institutions. This faction definitely abandoned the BNG on March 14, 2009. After the members of the Movement for Base who used the domain polabase.net had abandoned the BNG, the majority sector of the Movemento pola Base that remained in the BNG (polabase.org) decided to give up the acronym and name, to avoid greater confrontation, and created a new organization called the Galician Movement for Socialism. =Anova-Nationalist Brotherhood= In 2012 the MpB joined Anova-Nationalist Brotherhood In 2014 the MpB supported a coalition with United Left to the European elections of 2014.

He was a first-team All-American at Ohio State in 1950. Early years Momsen was born in Toledo, Ohio, in 1929. He was the son of Rose and Anton Momsen, Sr., and the younger brother of Tony Momsen. Momsen and his brother Tony both attended Libbey High School. Ohio State Brother Tony attended the University of Michigan, while Bob attended Ohio State University. Both brothers played college football and became adversaries in the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry. Bob Momsen played at the guard and linebacker positions for the Ohio State Buckeyes while brother Tony played at the center and linebacker positions for the Michigan Wolverines. Bob Momsen was selected by the Football Writers Association of America as a first-team defensive player and on their 1950 College Football All-America Team. The Momsen brothers are most remembered for their role in the famed 1950 Snow Bowl game between Michigan and Ohio State. The game was played in a blizzard, with weather conditions so inclement that Michigan punted on first down for its first two plays from scrimmage, after concluding that the best strategy was to keep the slick ball on the other side of the field and in the hands of Ohio State. The Buckeyes scored when Vic Janowicz kicked a field goal after Bob Momsen recovered a blocked Wolverine kick. With 47 seconds remaining in the first half, Tony Momsen blocked a Janowicz punt and fell on the ball in the end zone for a touchdown. The Wolverines won by a final score of 9-3. Bob Momsen later recalled, \\"Two brothers got more publicity for playing in a terrible football game than anyone ever deserves.\\" Professional football Both Momsen brothers went on to play in the National Football League (NFL). Bob was drafted by the Detroit Lions with the 80th pick in the 1951 NFL Draft and played for the Lions during the 1951 NFL season. He also played for the San Francisco 49ers in the 1952 NFL season. Later years After retiring as a professional football player, Momsen coached football at Northland College in Ashland, Wisconsin, before returning to Toledo in 1956. He coached high school football for 25 years at Libbey, Waite, and Macomber High Schools in Toledo. He was inducted into the Ohio State Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005.

Teacher leadership tasks may include but are not limited to: managing teaching, learning, and resource allocation. Teachers who engage in leadership roles are generally experienced and respected in their field which can both empower them and increase collaboration among peers. In these types of school environments, teachers are able to make decisions based on the work they do directly with students. When a school system places the decision-making on the teachers, the action is happening one level closer to the people who are most closely impacted by the decisions (generally the students and the teachers), rather than two or more levels above at the principal, superintendent, or school board level. The extent to which teacher leaders adopt additional roles varies in degree and description: Administration leadership (traditional school leadership/educational leadership): Administrative staff carries out the majority of the leadership duties. Teacher networks (professional learning community/professional community/networked improvement communities/community of practice/distributed leadership): All teachers collectively take on decision-making roles about curriculum and school climate. This practice is facilitated by and supported by an administrative leader. Teacher leaders (instructional leadership/instructional coaches): Some teachers take on individual leadership roles that directly impact educational practices under the leadership of a school administrator. Teacher co-ops (teacher-powered schools/teacher-led schools/worker cooperative/professional partnerships/teacherpreneurs): All teachers collectively take on leadership and administrative tasks that would traditionally be done by a principal or administrative team right  Research supportive of the philosophy  The National Education Association (NEA) (2011) describes teacher leaders as, \\"experienced professionals who have earned the respect of their students and colleagues and have gained a set of skills that enable them to work effectively and collaboratively with colleagues. They work closely with principals who have been trained to develop and implement effective mechanisms of support for teachers and teacher leaders.\\"NEA. 2011. Teacher Leader Model Standards Teacher Leadership Exploratory Consortium. <> p27-28. Teacher leaders are teachers who, \\"want to remain closely connected to the classroom and students, but are willing to assume new responsibilities that afford them leadership opportunities in or outside the classroom while still teaching full or part-time.\\"NEA. 2011. Teacher Leader Model Standards Teacher Leadership Exploratory Consortium. <> p. 27 In his book, Kolderie (2014) cites Hubbs in describing the benefits of decentralizing the authority in schools: \\"You just can’t beat a decentralized system. It gets closest to the level where the action really is. Education should have an advantage in moving into it, because your locations and your people are already physically dispersed.\\"Kolderie, Ted. 2014. The Split Screen Strategy: Improvement + Innovation: How to Get Education Changing the Way Successful Systems Change. Beaver’s Pond Press, Edina, MN. <> p. 135 Another potential benefit of decentralizing authority is as Spillane et al. describe: \\"The interactions among two or more leaders in carrying out a particular task may amount to more than the sum of those leaders’ practice.\\" The NEA (2011) reported that, \\"Research indicates that in order to increase the likelihood that Gen \\"Y\\" teachers remain in the profession, they need opportunities to participate in decision making at the school and district level; a positive and supportive school culture which fosters teamwork and effective lines of communication; professional opportunities that include collaboration and technology; in-depth feedback and support from administrators and colleagues; time set aside for regular collaboration; and fair pay and a differentiated pay structure which includes rewarding outstanding performance, acquiring new knowledge and skills, and assuming new roles and responsibilities (Behrstock & Clifford, 2009).\\"NEA. 2011.

Networks As Learning Communities Shaping The Future Of Teacher Development. Stanford University.  Spectrum of authority To frame the types of work in which Teacher leaders participate, it is important to look at the roles taken on by Educational leadership more broadly. Halverson, Kelley, and Shaw (2013) identify the following domains of school leadership: # \\"Focus on Learning # Monitoring teaching and learning # Building nested learning communities # Acquiring and allocating resources # Establishing a safe and effective learning environment.\\"Halverson, Rich; Kelley, Carolyn.

Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association. p. 10. Lieberman (2000) explains that, \\"having a professional community differentiated those teachers who worked together to change the culture of their classrooms and their departments from those teachers who either tried new ideas in fragmented ways on their own or who blamed students for their inabilities to learn.\\" Bryk/Gomez describe a type of teacher network, \\"a networked improvement community\\" as, \\"an intentionally formed social organization\\" whose \\"improvement goals impose specific demands on the rules and norms of participation.\\"Bryk, Anthony S., Gomez, Louis M.. 2010.

Teacher Leadership That Strengthens Professional Practice. ASCD Member Book. p18. \\"Teachers in leadership roles work in collaboration with principals and other school administrators by facilitating improvements in instruction and promoting practices among their peers that can lead to improved student learning outcomes.

Teacher Leader Model Standards Teacher Leadership Exploratory Consortium. <> p. 11. \\"Teachers who serve in leadership roles may do so formally or informally. Rather than having positional authority, teachers become leaders in their schools by being respected by their peers, being continuous learners, being approachable, and using group skills and influence to improve the educational practice of their peers.

Teacher Leader Model Standards Teacher Leadership Exploratory Consortium. <> p. 9. One way in which teachers serve in these leadership or instructional coaching roles is to do instructional rounds in their school. Rounds consist of teachers spending time observing in one another’s classrooms and then meeting to discuss the findings. City et al. describe the goals of rounds to: \\"1. Build skills of network members by coming to a common understanding of effective practice and how to support it. 2. Support instructional improvement at the host site (school or district) by sharing what the network learns and by building skills at the local level.\\"City, Elizabeth A., Elmore, Richard F., Fiarman, Sarah E., Teitel. Lee. 2009. Instructional Rounds in Education: A Network Approach To Improving Teaching And Learning. HARVARD EDUCATION PRESS CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS. p. 100. Some additional forms of teacher or instructional leadership may include: problem-solving teams, peer mentoring, and coaching, which support of the work of the administration without replacing it. = Teacher co-ops = The Teacher Powered Schools organization explains this teacher co-op or teacher-powered model as: \\"1. collaboratively designed and implemented by teachers. 2. teachers having collective autonomy to make the decisions influencing the success of a school, project, or professional endeavor.\\"Teacher-Powered Schools. 2014. <<>>. In these teacher co-ops or professional partnerships, Kolderie explains, \\"The authority pyramid inverts, and school moves to the dual-leader model typical of partnerships in most areas. (Think of the managing partner and the administrator of a law firm, or the chief of the medical staff and the executive of a hospital.).\\"Kolderie, Ted. 2014. The Split Screen Strategy: Improvement + Innovation: How to Get Education Changing the Way Successful Systems Change. Beaver’s Pond Press, Edina, MN. <> p. 86. The structure of a teacher co-op could vary from, \\"...handling the whole school [which] involves the teachers in the administration and management of the school as well as in the learning. Alternatively, teachers in a large secondary school—while continuing to be district employees—could form a partnership to handle the math department, the science department or the English department. They could then focus on learning; the principal would handle the school administration. A partnership of teachers might also organize to take responsibility for a program serving several schools across a district; Montessori, for example.\\"Kolderie, Ted. 2014. The Split Screen Strategy: Improvement + Innovation: How to Get Education Changing the Way Successful Systems Change. Beaver’s Pond Press, Edina, MN. <> p. 95.  Factors of implementation  Lieberman (2000) found that, \\"Networks that last, that hold their members, and continue to attract new teachers understand that they must account for the daily pressures of teaching, even as they seek to advance larger ideals.\\" In order to be successful, teacher leadership should be implemented strategically. \\"Among the issues that will need to be considered are: # resources (new or reallocated) necessary to provide professional development to teachers and administrators, # availability of time within schools to create a collaborative work environment, # re-structuring of current teacher compensation systems, # the development of cost-efficient, equitable, and streamlined systems to recognize and reward teachers serving in leadership roles, # assessing the effectiveness of various teacher leadership models, and # replicating and scaling-up effective teacher leadership practices.\\"NEA. 2011. Teacher Leader Model Standards Teacher Leadership Exploratory Consortium. <> p. 32. Teacher leadership can be initiated from within the staff itself, however, it is important that the teachers have administrative support as well as peer-to- peer support to carry out their tasks. Halverson, Kelley, and Shaw (2013) reference: \\"Louis, Kruse and Bryk (1995) conclude that the most important task for school leaders is to create meaningful opportunities for teachers across the school to work together on pressing issues of common interest.\\"Halverson, Rich; Kelley, Carolyn.

Entrepreneurial orientation has become one of the most established and researched constructs in the entrepreneurship literature. A general commonality among past conceptualizations of EO is the inclusion of innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking as core defining aspects or dimensions of the orientation. EO has been shown to be a strong predictor of firm performance with a meta- analysis of past research indicating a correlation in magnitude roughly equivalent to the prescription of taking sleeping pills and getting better sleep. Still, some research has argued that EO does not enhance the performance for all firms. Instead, EO can be argued not to be a simple performance enhancing attribute but rather enhancing if it is applied under the right circumstances of the firmChirico, F., Sirmon, D.G., Sciascia, S. and Mazzola, P. (2011), Resource orchestration in family firms: investigating how entrepreneurial orientation, generational involvement, and participative strategy affect performance. Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal, 5: 307-326. doi:10.1002/sej.121 . In some cases, EO can even be disadvantageous for firms, if the situation of the firm does not fit with applying EO. Different situations (also known as context) can be the environment that the firm is situated within or internal situations such as structure and strategy. Entrepreneurial orientation has most frequently been assessed using a nine- item psychometric instrument developed by Jeff Covin and Dennis Slevin. This instrument captures the perspective of Danny Miller that EO is a ‘collective catchall’ construct which represents what it means for a firm to be considered entrepreneurial across a wide range of contexts. A seminal quote from Miller (1983, p. 780): “In general, theorists would not call a firm entrepreneurial if it changed its technology or product line simply by directly imitating competitors while refusing to take any risks. Some proactiveness would be essential as well. By the same token, risk-taking firms that are highly leveraged financially are not necessarily entrepreneurial. They must also engage in product market or technological innovation.” Reviews of the Entrepreneurial orientation literature indicate that the majority of prior studies have adopted Miller's perspective of EO as the combination of innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking. Lumpkin and Dess offer an alternative view of EO as the combination of five dimensions, those put forth by Miller/Covin and Slevin as well as competitive aggressiveness and autonomy. Moreover, they suggest that additional insights stand to be gained from investigating the dimensions independently. Proceeding research has suggested that there is value in examining EO according to either conceptualization depending upon the demands of the research question being addressed. Research on the individual dimensions of risk-taking, proactiveness and innovativeness has found that the dimensions can combine in different ways to form configurations. Taken together, as a strategic orientation EO enhances firm performance as well as overall variance in a firm’s performance. Increased variance occurs as result of the observation that many entrepreneurial actions ultimately fail to generate an economic return thereby contributing to an increased distribution of firm performance outcomes. As a core firm strategic orientation, the breadth and depth of research on EO continues to expand as the concept is adopted to understand the effects of being entrepreneurial across an increasing number of research contexts. The recent study has extended into green entrepreneurial orientation, which highlights the green technological leadership, green products, green administrative techniques, and green operation technology. However, the traditional use of EO has been focused on explanations, such as those within natural science, combined with a conception of entrepreneurs as possessing exceptional traits or exceptional risk-takers, as heroic individuals: these perspectives are incorrect. Recent studies propose a critical process re-conceptualization of EO aimed at opportunity designing in uncertain contexts as well as (proto) organizational projects. The major contributions are theoretical frameworks or empirical works under a process perspective that brings together research fields that have been isolated for too long, focusing on the interplay between routines and artifacts (as rules), agency and structure, sense-making and decision- making.

Smith (1919-2013) was an American airman who served as a B-25 bombardier with the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. Early life Smith was born in Weldon, Texas. His father moved to East Chicago, Indiana to look for a job. Smith, along with the rest of his family, joined him there a few years later. He attended Washington High School, where his focus was on music rather than athletics. Tuskegee Smith did not yearn to fly like the rest of his colleagues. In fact, he once said, \\"I didn't give a tinker's damn if I ever left the ground.\\" His friend Cornelius Coffey founded the Coffey School of Aeronautics in Chicago, and Smith had to be talked into joining. At the time, military planes were assigned to White pilots. Smith flew \\"primary\\" planes known as service aircraft. He served as a flight instructor for \\"primaries\\" at the Tuskegee Institute. Smith weighed 200 pounds and was too big for a P-40 or P-51. Instead he was made a bombardier. Smith was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen 477th Composite Group. First Lieutenant Smith spent time at Fort Knox near Louisville. He was transferred to Freeman Field in Indiana. Since Smith was an officer he was technically allowed to enter any officers club, but the military was still segregated. Black officers were prohibited from the officers club, tennis court, and swimming pool. They were only allowed to use the facilities during hours when they were supposed to be working. Along with 100 officers, Smith refused to sign a new directive about segregation in officers clubs. They were sent to prison at Fort Leavenworth. Shortly after, they were sent back to Freeman Field because there was not enough room for 101 black prisoners at Fort Leavenworth. Thurgood Marshall defended the men and won their release. Smith received an honorable discharge on an order from then President Harry Truman More than fifty years later, Smith and the 100 other black officers' service records would be formally cleared of the incident. In 2007, as a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, First Lieutenant Smith received a Congressional Gold Medal. This is the highest civilian honor bestowed by the United States Congress. It was stolen during a break-in, but was replaced at a special ceremony in 2012. Educational career Smith earned his master's degree in English. He took on various roles in schools. He taught English at Roosevelt High School, served as a guidance counselor, and then went on to become a high school principal at West Side High School in Indiana. Later in his life he was made the director of secondary education for Gary, Indiana. He sat on several aviation and education boards, and was a member of the Chicago Chapter of Tuskegee Airmen, an organization of black pilots. Smith also created the Gary Emerson High School for Visual and Performing Arts. Death Dr. Quentin P. Smith died on January 15, 2013. He was 94 years old. After his passing, an airport bridge at the Gary/Chicago International Airport was named in his honor. Smith was a former president of the Gary Airport Authority.

She says that her childhood came from her mother, who was \\"the most unimaginable woman\\" she ever knew. She received \\"a basic and strict education [...] but intuition [was] the biggest factor\\". She also says that in Saint-Tropez \\"fashion was not a question of clothes. It was more about attitude, intelligence, the way to be, the simplicity of it. [...] [I]t was about having fun.\\" She moved to Paris in the 1960s and began her career interning at Depeche Mode and Marie Claire. Later, starting in 1977, she worked at French Elle for 10 years before moving to New York in 1985 and becoming the fashion director of Vogue US, where she styled Anna Wintour's first cover in 1988, in which Israeli model Michaela Bercu was dressed in a Christian LaCroix couture top with a jeweled cross and Guess jeans. She worked closely with prominent fashion photographers of the era: Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, Helmut Newton, Paolo Roversi, Patrick Demarchelier, and her longtime collaborator, Steven Meisel.

Elysium is one of several companies founded at around the same time by people with backgrounds in the tech industry and Silicon Valley who saw opportunities in the health and biomedical industries, often focused on anti-aging. Criticism The company has been criticized for using its advisory board to lend credibility to its product and for heavily marketing their product on social media. Jeffrey S. Flier, Caroline Shields Walker Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and former dean of Harvard Medical School (HMS), has stated that “Elysium is selling pills [without] evidence that they actually work in humans at all.” https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2017/09/anti-aging-breakthrough https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/03/30/dietary-supplements-nobel- ignoble/e5E6Cklw3RxlExEtGJe6mL/story.html Elysium originally bought the ingredients in Basis from ChromaDex, which as of December 2016, sold the two ingredients to other supplement companies that also marketed products containing them. The two companies had an agreement under which Elysium Health didn't have to acknowledge ChromaDex as the source of the ingredients, but then after Elysium recruited the head of business development from Chromadex and allegedly stopped paying Chromadex, Chromadex sued Elysium and the information became public. In September 2018, Dartmouth College and ChromaDex sued Elysium for infringement of two issued patents exclusively licensed by ChromaDex on use of NR to increase NAD that were invented by Charles Brenner.

It featured the Austrian X Corps against the Prussian Guard Corps and ended in a Prussian victory. Burkersdorf (Střítež)  After having beaten back Bonin's I Corps at Trautenau in the only Austrian victory against the Prussians, Glabenz's position became untenable due to the Austrian loss at Nachod and the Prussian Guard Corps' advance towards Eipel (Upice), and he was ordered to retreat towards Prausnitz (Brusnice) to block the Prussian Guards. At 9:00 AM Prussian hussars scouted X Corps decamping from the heights near Trautenau, and the Prussian Guard commander ordered an advance towards Deutsch-Prausnitz, south of Trautenau. Meanwhile, having received his marching orders at 7:00 AM, Glabenz lost time in ordering the retreat and he decided to send his Grivicic brigade to Radec to hit the Prussian Guard in the flank. At 8:00 near Burkersdorf Glabenz marching columns encountered the 2nds Prussian Guard brigade. Glabenz deployed his Knebel and Mondel brigades in a defensive semi-circle. The Austrian 64 gun main battery was able to hold the Prussians for an hour but at 9:30 AM they broke through to Burkersdorf (Střítež). Having been able to shift the majority of his Corps westwards to Pilnikau (Pilnikov), Glabenz left a regiment from Knebel's brigade behind as rear guard to hold up the Prussians at Burkersdorf. By 10:00 AM the town was taken by the Prussians Guards only after heavy fighting which cost them 500 men. The Austrian rear guard then joined Glabenz's retreat.Geoffrey Wawro, The Austro-Prussian War. Austria's war with Prussia and Italy in 1866 (New York 2007), p 160-163 Rudersdorf (Rubínovice)  Having been ordered by Glabenz to march towards Radec and not knowing the outcome of the fighting at Burkersdorf (Střítež), Colonel Grivicic at 12:00 AM reached the town of Rudersdorf ( Rubínovice), where he stood poised between the 1st and 2nd Prussian Guard Divisions. At Rudersdorf Grivicic encountered a Prussian battalion which had been detached as flank protection. Assuming he was faced by an entire division, Grivicic took up a defensive position against the Prussian battalion. By 1:00 PM, having understood his mistake, Grivicic restarted a cautious advance against the Prussian line, which had been reinforced by a second battalion and later by the 4th Guards Brigade. Failing to make headway against the Dreyse needle gun, Grivicic halted the advance and then retreated towards the town, which was then fought over house-to-house. As three new Prussian Guard battalions appeared and turned his right flank, making the brigade collapse and disperse. In all, Grivicic brigade lost 2512 men and was effectively destroyed.Geoffrey Wawro, The Austro-Prussian War.

These changes eliminate red tape around impact investment and incentivize asset holders to direct resources toward projects that provide broader benefits to society.Bretton Woods profile, newsamerica.org; accessed April 18, 2015. Context Pension funds, charitable endowments, and sovereign wealth funds control over $25 trillion in assets worldwide. As investors, these groups share two key attributes: first, they have unusually long time horizons. Pension liabilities extend across decades, and endowments and sovereign wealth funds are often designed to operate in perpetuity. Second, the holdings of these investors span every region and sector. They are too big and too broadly diversified to hide from market volatility. When the world economy prospers, their assets grow. Conversely, when world markets falter, it undermines the ability of these investors to realize their long-term financial objectives. Asset holders in these groups derive significant benefits from reductions in market volatility. However, despite the fact that large asset holders clearly benefit from reduced volatility and related improvements in the investment climate, they rarely use their assets to influence these variables. The core of the Bretton Woods II initiative is the reality that large, long-term asset holders can use their investment strategies to shape a landscape that will be more conducive to stability, prosperity, and sustainability. Supporters Dr. Tomicah Tillemann, who previously served as Senior Advisor to Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, and Joe Biden, directs the initiative from the New America Foundation. The Pledge has drawn support from a broad range of leaders and experts at organizations in civil society and the private sector including Bono's ONE Campaign, the United Nations Foundation, the Center for Global Development, the Aspen Institute, the State Department, and the World Bank. The Initiative The Bretton Woods II initiative brings together large asset holders around three goals designed to address this opportunity: 1) Investors dedicate at least 1% of their assets or profits to social impact investment, development finance, or civil society support. 2) These resources are focused on countries that adopt basic standards of governance, accountability, and citizen engagement. CalPERS, the largest non-federal pension fund in the United States, has pioneered similar guidelines. A version of these rules would be developed to serve the needs of a broader array of investors. This effort will create a multibillion-dollar incentive for good governance and citizen engagement grounded in successful principles in use by the Millennium Challenge Corporation. 3) Providing support for regulatory reforms developed by the G-8 Social Impact Investment Task Force and National Advisory Boards on Impact Investment. These changes will eliminate red tape around impact investment and incentivize asset holders to direct resources toward projects that provide broader benefits to society. A large consortium of organizations working with the New America Foundation have joined the effort to build out the analytical case for impact investment, assess potential returns from different impact investment strategies, and develop metrics for gauging impact. The partners are working to demonstrate that asset holders have both a vested interest and a fiduciary obligation to pursue impact investments that reduce market volatility, improve governance, and advance Sustainable Development Goals.

These schedules may be either written or ad hoc, and have not been tested for their safety or efficacy. Proponents of such schedules aim to reduce the risk of adverse effects they believe to be caused by vaccine components, such as \\"immune system overload\\" that is argued to be caused by exposure to multiple antigens. Parents who adopt these schedules tend to do so because they are concerned about the potential risks of vaccination, rather than because they are unaware of the significance of vaccination's benefits. However, use of alternative vaccination schedules is associated with an increased risk of vaccine-preventable disease. Effects Contrary to the claims made by some advocates of alternative vaccine schedules, there is no scientific evidence for the existence of \\"immune system overload\\", and according to the UK National Health Service the idea is a \\"myth\\". In addition, the amount of chemicals in vaccines such as aluminum and formaldehyde is much lower than natural exposure levels. Intentional deviation from the ACIP's schedule leaves children vulnerable to infection and increases the likelihood of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. These schedules also increase the chances of infection among individuals who could not be vaccinated for medical reasons, because they were too young, or who did not develop a sufficient immunologic response to the vaccine. After one of the most notorious outbreaks of measles in the United States, in California, legislation was passed to make vaccination mandatory, as alternative vaccine scheduling and/or avoidance had been prevalent before the outbreak.  Popularity  An increasing number of children are undervaccinated, of whom an estimated 13% or more are believed to be so because of parental choice. One survey, published in Vaccine, found that 9.4% of parents in King County, Washington used an alternative vaccine schedule, while another survey found that more than 1 out of 10 parents of children aged between 6 months and 6 years used an alternative vaccine schedule. In a 2011 survey of Washington State pediatricians, 77% of them reported that their patients \\"sometimes or frequently\\" asked for alternative vaccination schedules. The same survey found that 61% of pediatricians were comfortable with using such a schedule if a parent asked for it. A 2012 survey found that the percentage of shot-limiting children—defined as children who received no more than two vaccines per visit between their birth and the age of nine months—had increased from 2.5% to 9.5% in Portland, Oregon. Research on well-off American families suggests that even parents who are ostensibly pro-vaccine can be misled by disinformation, and this can lead them to delay having their children vaccinated, and to tolerate such delay in others.  Proponents  Among the most prominent proponents of alternative vaccination schedules is notable pediatrician and vaccine critic Robert Sears. Sears has been criticized by vaccine expert Paul Offit for what Offit states is Sears' \\"misrepresentation of vaccine science.\\" In June 2018, the Medical Board of California placed Sears on probation for improperly granting a medical exemption from all future vaccines to a two-year-old child without obtaining any of the child's medical records, including which vaccines the child had received to date.https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/doctor- with-dangerous-vaccine-views-gets-probation-for-gross-negligence/  Types of schedules  A 2016 study identified five different types of alternative vaccine schedules: Sears' schedule, a shot-limiting schedule, selective delaying or refusal, making vaccine decisions visit-by-visit, or refusing all vaccines. Regardless of the type of alternative schedule used, skipping or delaying recommended vaccines has been shown to result in an increased risk of contracting and spreading vaccine-preventable diseases.

The professor's duties are \\"to lecture and give instruction in Indo-European and the history and comparative philology of the Indo-European languages.\\" The professorship was created for the German academic Max Müller in 1868. It was called the \\"Corpus Christi\\" Professorship because a commission in 1877, led by Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne, recommended that the richest colleges should help the university by providing funds for chairs. Corpus Christi College was reluctant – partly because of the cost involved at a time when the college's income was affected by an agricultural recession, but also because the fellows of the college feared that they would be outvoted by professors. Although the chair was renamed as the Corpus Christi professorship in 1882 on the basis that provision had been made to endow the chair out of the college's revenues, the college never provided sufficient funds to establish a full endowment for the chair, and its obligation to do so (to the college's relief) was removed in 1925. The chair was renamed in 2003 after Professor A. Richard Diebold Jr., to mark his donation to the university to support the chair. It is now associated with a fellowship of Worcester College, although Anna Morpurgo Davies (appointed in 1971) was a fellow of Somerville College instead because at that time Worcester did not have women fellows.

It won the Governor General's Literary Award the same year. It is Engel's fifth novel, and her most famous. The story tells of a lonely librarian in northern Ontario who enters into a sexual relationship with a bear. The book has been called \\"the most controversial novel ever written in Canada\\".  Background  The book was Engel's fifth novel, and her sixth piece of published writing. Engel studied under author Hugh MacLennan, finishing her Master's of Arts at McGill University in Montreal in 1957. Her first novel, No Clouds for Glory, was released in 1968. She was awarded a Canada Council grant on the strength of the book, but had difficulty finding a publisher for her second novel, The Honeyman Festival. The book was published in 1970 by the new Toronto company House of Anansi Press, which would also put out another novel, Monodronos, and a collection of short stories, Inside the Easter Egg. The novel was written in a busy and tumultuous period in the author's life, a \\"very crazy time\\" as described by Engel. In 1973, Engel had started the Writers' Union of Canada (W.U.C.) from her home, and served as its first chairperson. Through the W.U.C., and her position on the board of trustees for the Toronto Public Library, she advocated for public lending rights for Canadian authors. She was raising twins while undergoing a painful divorce. She took regular psychotherapy sessions, and worried about her mental health. Engel would end up dedicating the book to John Rich, her therapist. Engel started writing the novel to contribute to a W.U.C. collection of pornographic fiction by \\"serious\\" writers. The project was supposed to raise funds for the cash- strapped union, but did not make it to publication. Engel kept with her 31-page draft, and developed it into the 141-page novel. She was partly inspired by the First Nations legend of The Bear Princess, as recorded by folklorist Marius Barbeau. The story was suggested to the writer by the Haida artist Bill Reid. Early titles for the book included The Bear of Pennarth and The Dog of God. The book was rejected when first sent to publishers. An editor with Harcourt Brace wrote in a rejection letter: \\"Its relative brevity coupled with its extreme strangeness presents, I'm afraid, an insuperable obstacle in present circumstances.\\" Fellow Canadian author Robertson Davies praised the book to McClelland & Stewart editors, and Engel started a lifelong friendship with company president Jack McClelland. The first printing was released in Toronto in May 1976.  Synopsis  The landscape of Algoma District, at the crossing of the Michipicoten River by Ontario Highway 17 = Setting = The book takes place in the district of Algoma in northeastern Ontario. The area is heavily wooded, with a mix of deciduous and conifer forests. Part of the Canadian Shield, the district has many lakes and rivers. Almost all of the story takes place in or around an old, octagonal house on a small island on a remote lake. The location, \\"Cary's Island\\" is fictitious, located north of Highway 17, past \\"Fisher's Falls\\" and near a village called \\"Brady\\". The house and estate, previously belonging to the Cary family, whose patriarch fought in the Napoleonic Wars, is called \\"Pennarth\\" (Welsh for \\"Bear's head\\"). Its octagonal layout was inspired by the writings of Orson Squire Fowler, which dates the building to the 1850s. The house is well-ordered and elaborate, and houses an extensive library of nineteenth century books. Outside are several outbuildings, including a shed that houses a large, semi-tame bear. = Plot summary = The novel centers on Lou, a 27-year-old librarian given the task of documenting the house and library of Colonel Cary, which has been donated to her employer, the Heritage Institute. Escaping a dreary and unfulfilling life in Toronto, Lou revels in the opportunity to work in the solitude of Cary's Island. She studies and catalogues the library. Lou struggles with her emotional balance, and her relationship with her work. She slowly begins to approach the island's resident bear, who was a pet of the late Colonel. Lonely and isolated, Lou enters into a sporadic sexual relationship with the estate's caretaker, Homer Campbell. She becomes closer to the bear, aided by an elder First Nations woman, Lucy Leroy. Lucy advises Lou on how to gain the animal's confidence. As she delves deeper into the library, she finds scraps of bear folklore and studies collected by the Colonel. Her relationship with the bear becomes sexual, as well as spiritual. As her work comes to a finish, the bear scratches her deeply in the back. Her bond with the bear is altered, and Lou leaves the island with a sense of renewal.  Reception  The Canadian Encyclopedia notes that the book has been called \\"the most controversial novel ever written in Canada,\\" and the notoriety around its subject matter brought Engel to national attention for the first time. At its publication, the novel was mostly received well by critics. Engel's writing craft was admired, with The Globe and Mail noting her \\"fine use of understatement, control, and economy.\\" The book was received favorably outside of Canada as well; London's Times Literary Supplement wrote a positive review. Exceptions included novelist and critic Scott Symons, who called the book \\"spiritual gangrene... a Faustian compact with the Devil.\\" The 1976 Governor General's Literary Award jury, which included authors Margaret Laurence, Alice Munro, and Mordecai Richler awarded Bear its English-language Fiction award, one of the highest literary prizes in the country. In 2014, the paperback cover became an Internet meme, thanks to a widely shared Imgur post titled \\"WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK, CANADA?\\" This exposure led to a modern reappraisal of the 1970s novel, including new reviews, commentary, and a place in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's 2014 list \\"Books That Make You Proud to Be a Canadian.\\" A 2014 National Post review by literature critic Emily M. Keeler called the book \\"the best Canadian novel of all time.\\" Critic Aritha Van Herk, in an interview with CBC Radio's Q program, called the novel a \\"quintessential Canadian book,\\" referencing the role of wilderness in Canadian lives.  Publication history  McLelland & Stewart released the first edition in 1976. Atheneum Books released the first American edition. Several paperback editions were published by different imprints, including Seal and Pandora. The now-famous, Harlequin- like paperback cover depicts a partially nude woman being embraced by a large bear. Its artist was not credited in the book; later investigation concluded the illustration was likely by veteran cover illustrator Fred Pfeiffer. McClelland released a new edition under its \\"New Canadian Library\\" series in 1990 with an afterword by Aritha Van Herk. A more recent American edition licensed from Atheneum was published in 2002 by David R. Godine, Publisher with a subtly provocative wood engraved illustration by Wesley Bates on the front cover and frontis, which has gone into 10 printings as of 2018. In August 2014, reacting to renewed interest in the novel, McClelland released a reprint of the New Canadian Library edition. Trying to avoid the sensationalism of the original paperback cover, Random House of Canada (which owns McClelland & Stewart) senior designer Five Seventeen designed several versions, finally deciding on a painting by American artist Mara Light. The painting depicts the back of a nude female; the designer added scratch marks, evoking an episode from the novel where Lou is injured by the bear.

He established the first English-language Japanese American newspaper, the Japanese American Courier, in 1928, and became a prominent national figure as a founding member of the Japanese American Citizens League. Early life Sakamoto was born in Seattle to Osamu and Tsuchi Sakamoto, Issei who had immigrated to the United States from Yamaguchi Prefecture in 1894. He became a star athlete at Franklin High School, leading the football team to its first victory against cross-town rival Broadway High in 1920. That same year, Sakamoto, then 17, testified before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization. Preparing for an upcoming revision to U.S. immigration law, the Committee had been charged with collecting information on Asian Americans living in the West Coast states — and Sakamoto's testimony that he \\"wanted to be American more than Japanese\\" was received favorably. After finishing high school, he moved to New York, where he found work as editor of the English-language section of the Japanese American News, a position he held for three years. During this time he married Frances Imai, and the couple had one daughter. To supplement his income from the newspaper, Sakamoto began boxing professionally, eventually becoming the first Japanese American to fight in Madison Square Garden. He took on various aliases in order to circumvent legal restrictions on the number of fights a boxer could participate in, and the physical strain soon caused irreparable damage to his retinas. Sakamoto moved back to Seattle when his eyesight began to fade, in 1927; he became completely blind soon after. Frances had died before Sakamoto left New York, and he remarried shortly after returning to Seattle, to a Japanese-born woman named Misao Nishitani (with whom he would have three more daughters). Japanese American leader In 1928, Sakamoto and his wife Misao founded the Japanese American Courier, the first Japanese American newspaper to be published entirely in English. Aimed specifically at the American-born Nisei, the Courier reported on Japanese affairs while encouraging its readers to assimilate into \\"Americanized\\" society.Ichioka, Yuji. \\"A Study in Dualism: James Yoshinori Sakamoto and the Japanese American Courier, 1928-1942.\\" In Before Internment: Essays in Prewar Japanese American History, eds. Gordon H. Chang and Eiichiro Azuma (Stanford University Press, 2006), pp 92-93, 100-09. Sakamoto would type out the stories on a typewriter, while his wife Misao took charge of the paper's layout and printing, in addition to managing the paper's business operations. By 1940, its readership had grown to 4,275. Sakamoto helped establish the Japanese American Citizens League in Seattle in 1930, and from 1936 to 1938 he served as the League's national president. The JACL newspaper, the Pacific Citizen, floundered in 1933, and Sakamoto agreed to take over its editing and typesetting, running the national paper in addition to the Courier until 1939. During this time he also created an Asian American sports organization in the Pacific Northwest, named the Courier League after his own newspaper. World War II and later years On February 19, 1942 — a little over a month after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor — President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, authorizing military commanders to create security zones from which \\"any or all persons\\" might be removed. Additional orders created curfews and travel restrictions for Japanese Americans, and plans to \\"evacuate\\" all Nikkei from the West Coast were announced soon after. Sakamoto and other core members of the JACL became de facto leaders of the Japanese American community during this time. Sakamoto led the Seattle JACL's Emergency Defense Council, working with government officials, translating regulations and military orders for those who could not read English, and organizing war relief efforts to promote American patriotism. In keeping with the national organization's efforts to present a public face of assimilated, model American citizens, Sakamoto and the Seattle EDC pledged to root out \\"subversive\\" agents within the Japanese American community and serve as \\"protective custodians\\" over the Issei to prevent them from becoming a threat.Ichioka, p 116. In the Courier's final issue, published April 24, 1942, Sakamoto urged Japanese Americans to accept the forced removal without a fight, calling it their \\"patriotic contribution.\\"Ichioka, p 117. He was removed to the Puyallup Assembly Center (euphemistically dubbed \\"Camp Harmony\\" by the Wartime Civilian Control Administration), where army officials allowed the Emergency Defense Council to take charge of much of the administration of the camp. As chief supervisor of the \\"Japanese staff,\\" Sakamoto and his JACL appointees held a sizeable share of control in the assembly center's day-to-day management — an arrangement that proved unpopular with many Puyallup inmates who viewed the JACL as government collaborators, or \\"inu\\" (literally, \\"dogs\\"). Sakamoto was transferred to Minidoka in the fall of 1942, but War Relocation Authority restrictions on inmate self-governance in the larger \\"relocation centers\\" — combined with growing anti-JACL sentiment — effectively ended his role as a camp leader. Misao and the couple's two older daughters took advantage of the WRA's resettlement program and left camp for Indiana, while Sakamoto remained in Minidoka to care for their youngest daughter and his elderly parents. After the war, the family returned to Seattle, where, unable to finance a new start for the Japanese American Courier, they lived on government assistance until Sakamoto was able to find a job with the St. Vincent de Paul Salvage Bureau, a Catholic-run charity thrift store. He was struck by a car while walking to work on December 3, 1955, and died later that day. References External links * Guide to the James Y.

Water can get into diesel fuel as a result of condensation, rainwater penetration or adsorption from the air — modern biodiesel is especially hygroscopic. The presence of water then encourages microbial growth which either occurs at the interface between the oil and water or on the tank walls, depending on whether the microbes need oxygen. Species which may grow in this way include: * bacteria — clostridium; desulfotomaculum; desulfovibrio; flavobacterium; hydrogenomonas; pseudomonas; sarcina * fungi — aspergillus; candida; fusarium; hormoconis resinae Fuel companies agree that if left untreated fuel will remain reliable for just 6–12 months.

Nike-X was an anti- ballistic missile (ABM) system designed in the 1960s by the United States Army to protect major cities in the United States from attacks by the Soviet Union's intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) fleet during the Cold War. The X in the name referred to its experimental basis and was supposed to be replaced by a more appropriate name when the system was put into production. This never came to pass; in 1967 the Nike-X program was canceled and replaced by a much lighter defense system known as Sentinel. The Nike-X system was developed in response to limitations of the earlier Nike Zeus system. Zeus' radars could only track single targets, and it was calculated that a salvo of only four ICBMs would have a 90% chance of hitting a Zeus base. The attacker could also use radar reflectors or high-altitude nuclear explosions to obscure the warheads until they were too close to attack, making a single-warhead attack highly likely to succeed. Zeus would have been useful in the late 1950s when the Soviets had only a few dozen missiles, but would be of little use by the early 1960s when it was believed they would have hundreds. The key concept that led to Nike-X was that the rapidly thickening atmosphere below altitude disrupted the reflectors and explosions. Nike-X intended to wait until the enemy warheads descended below this altitude and then attack them using a very fast missile known as Sprint. The entire engagement would last only a few seconds and could take place as low as . To provide the needed speed and accuracy, as well as deal with multi-warhead attacks, Nike-X used a new radar system and building-filling computers that could track hundreds of objects at once and control salvos of many Sprints. Many dozens of warheads would need to arrive at the same time to overwhelm the system. Building a complete deployment would have been extremely expensive, on the order of the total yearly budget of the Department of Defense. Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, believed that the cost could not be justified and worried it would lead to a further nuclear arms race. He directed the teams to consider deployments where a limited number of interceptors might still be militarily useful. Among these, the I-67 concept suggested building a lightweight defense against very limited attacks. When the People's Republic of China exploded their first H-bomb in June 1967, I-67 was promoted as a defense against a Chinese attack, and this system became Sentinel in October. Nike-X development, in its original form, ended. History =Nike Zeus= The Nike missile family included Ajax (front), Hercules (middle), and Zeus (rear). In 1955 the US Army began considering the possibility of further upgrading their Nike B surface-to-air missile (SAM) as an anti-ballistic missile to intercept ICBMs. Bell Labs, the primary contractor for Nike, was asked to study the issue. Bell returned a report stating that the missile could be upgraded to the required performance relatively easily, but the system would need extremely powerful radar systems to detect the warhead while it was still far enough away to give the missile time to launch. All of this appeared to be within the state of the art, and in early 1957 Bell was given the go-ahead to develop what was then known as Nike II. Considerable interservice rivalry between the Army and Air Force led to the Nike II being redefined and delayed several times. These barriers were swept aside in late 1957 after the launch of the R-7 Semyorka, the first Soviet ICBM. The design was further upgraded, given the name Zeus, and assigned the highest development priority. Zeus was similar to the two Nike SAM designs that preceded it. It used a long range search radar to pick up targets, separate radars to track the target and interceptor missiles in flight, and a computer to calculate intercept points. The missile itself was much larger than earlier designs, with a range of up to , compared to Hercules' . To ensure a kill at altitude, where there was little atmosphere to carry a shock wave, it mounted a 400 kiloton (kT) warhead. The search radar was a rotating triangle wide, able to pick out warheads while still over away, an especially difficult problem given the small size of a typical warhead. A new transistorized digital computer offered the performance needed to calculate trajectories for intercepts against warheads traveling over per second. The Zeus missile began testing in 1959 at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and early launches were generally successful. Longer range testing took place at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, firing out over the Pacific Ocean. For full-scale tests, the Army built an entire Zeus base on Kwajalein Island in the Pacific, where it could be tested against ICBMs launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Test firings at Kwajalein began in June 1962; these were very successful, passing within hundreds of yards of the target warheads, and in some tests, low-flying satellites. =Zeus problems= The Zeus system required two separate radars for each missile it launched, with extras for redundancy and others for early detection and discrimination. Zeus had initially been proposed in an era when ICBMs were extremely expensive and the US believed that the Soviet fleet contained a few dozen missiles. At a time when the US deterrent fleet was based entirely on manned bombers, even a small number of missiles aimed at Strategic Air Command's (SAC) bases presented a serious threat. Two Zeus deployment plans were outlined. One was a heavy defensive system that would provide protection over the entire continental United States, but require as many as 7000 Zeus missiles. McNamara supported a much lighter system that would use only 1200 missiles. Technological improvements in warheads and missiles in the late 1950s greatly reduced the cost of ICBMs. After the launch of Sputnik, Pravda quoted Nikita Khrushchev claiming they were building them \\"like sausages\\". This led to a series of intelligence estimates that predicted the Soviets would have hundreds of missiles by the early 1960s, creating the so-called \\"missile gap\\". It was later shown that the number of Soviet missiles did not reach the hundreds until the late 1960s, and at the time they had only four. Zeus used mechanically steered radars, like the Nike SAMs before it, limiting the number of targets it could attack at once. A study by the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) calculated that the Soviets had a 90 percent chance of successfully hitting a Zeus base by firing only four warheads at it. These did not even have to land close in order to destroy the base; an explosion within several miles would destroy its radars, which were very difficult to harden. If the Soviets did have hundreds of missiles, they could easily afford to use some to attack the Zeus sites. Additionally, technical problems arose that appeared to make the Zeus almost trivially easy to defeat. One problem, discovered in tests during 1958, was that nuclear fireballs expanded to very large sizes at high altitudes, rendering everything behind them invisible to radar. This was known as nuclear blackout. By the time an enemy warhead passed through the fireball, about above the base, it would only be about eight seconds from impact. That was not enough time for the radar to lock on and fire a Zeus before the warhead hit its target. It was also possible to deploy radar decoys to confuse the defense. Decoys are made of lightweight materials, often strips of aluminum or mylar balloons, which can be packed in with the reentry vehicle (RV), adding little weight. In space, these are ejected to create a threat tube a few kilometers across and tens of kilometers long. Zeus had to get within about to kill a warhead, which could be anywhere in the tube. The WSEG suggested that a single ICBM with decoys would almost certainly defeat Zeus. A mid-1961 staff report by ARPA suggested that a single large missile with multiple warheads would require four entire Zeus batteries, of 100 missiles each, to defeat it. =Nike-X= The Nike-X Project Office took over from Nike Zeus in 1964. The office's emblem features the statue of Nike of Samothrace, the Greek goddess of victory. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, today known as DARPA) was formed in 1958 by President Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, in reaction to Soviet rocketry advances. US efforts had suffered from massive duplication of effort between the Army, Air Force, and Navy, and seemed to be accomplishing little in comparison to the Soviets. ARPA was initially handed the mission of overseeing all of these efforts. As the problems with Zeus became clear, McElroy also asked ARPA to consider the antimissile problem and come up with other solutions. The resulting Project Defender was extremely broad in scope, considering everything from minor Zeus system upgrades to far- out concepts like antigravity and the recently invented laser. Meanwhile, one improvement to Zeus was already being studied: a new phased-array radar replacing Zeus' mechanical ones would greatly increase the number of targets and interceptors that a single site could handle. Much more powerful computers were needed to match this performance. Additionally, the antennas were mounted directly in concrete and would have increased blast resistance. Initial studies at Bell Labs started in 1960 on what was then known as the Zeus Multi- function Array Radar, or ZMAR. In June 1961, Western Electric and Sylvania were selected to build a prototype, with Sperry Rand Univac providing the control computer. By late 1962 a decision on whether or not to deploy Zeus was looming. Bell began considering a replacement for the Zeus missile that would operate at much shorter ranges, and in October sent out study contracts to three contractors to be returned in February. Even before these were returned, in January 1963 McNamara announced that the construction funds allocated for Zeus would not be released, and the funding would instead be used for development of a new system using the latest technologies. The name Nike-X was apparently an ad hoc suggestion by Jack Ruina, the director of ARPA, who was tasked with presenting the options to the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC). With the ending of Zeus, the ZMAR radar effort was renamed MAR, and plans for an even more powerful version, MAR-II, became the central part of the Nike-X concept. =System concept= This image shows the arrangement of a typical Nike-X deployment. In the foreground is a missile site with a number of Sprint launchers and a two-sided MAR radar. In the background, upper right is a second base with additional missiles and an MSR radar. Decoys are lighter than the RV, and therefore suffer higher atmospheric drag as they begin to reenter the atmosphere. This will eventually cause the RV to move out in front of the decoys. The RV can often be picked out earlier by examining the threat tube and watching for objects that have lower deceleration. This process, known as atmospheric filtering, or more generally, decluttering, will not provide accurate information until the threat tube begins to reenter the denser portions of the atmosphere, at altitudes around . Nike-X intended to wait until the decluttering was complete, meaning the interceptions would take place only seconds before the warheads hit their targets, between away from the base. Low-altitude intercepts would also have the advantage of reducing the problem with nuclear blackout. The lower edge of the extended fireball used to induce this effect extended down to about 60 km, the same altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude intercepts meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the tracking and guidance of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and would only black out a small portion of the sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be calculated rapidly, before or between blackout periods, and the final tracking of the warheads in the 10 seconds or so between clearing the clutter and hitting their targets. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time. The centerpiece of the Nike-X system was MAR, using the then-new active electronically scanned array (AESA) concept to allow it to generate multiple virtual radar beams, simulating any number of mechanical radars needed. While one beam scanned the sky for new targets, others were formed to examine the threat tubes and generate high-quality tracking information very early in the engagement. More beams were formed to track the RVs once they had been picked out, and still more to track the Sprints on their way to the interceptions. To make all of this work, MAR required data processing capabilities on an unprecedented level, so Bell proposed building the system using the newly invented resistor–transistor logic small-scale integrated circuits. Nike-X centralized the battle control systems at their Defense Centers, consisting of a MAR and its associated underground Defense Center Data Processing System (DCDPS). Because the Sprint was designed to operate at short range, a single base could not provide protection to a typical US city, given urban sprawl. This required the Sprint launchers to be distributed around the defended area. Because a Sprint launched from a remote base might not be visible to the MAR during the initial stages of the launch, Bell proposed building a much simpler radar at most launch sites, the Missile Site Radar (MSR). MSR would have just enough power and logic to generate tracks for its outgoing Sprint missiles and would hand that information off to the DCDPS using conventional telephone lines and modems. Bell noted that the MSR could also provide a useful second- angle look at threat tubes, which might allow the decoys to be picked out earlier. Used as radio receivers, they could also triangulate any radio broadcasts coming from the threat tube, which the enemy might use as a radar jammer. When the system was first being proposed it was not clear whether the phased-array systems could provide the accuracy needed to guide the missiles to a successful interception at very long ranges. Early concepts retained Zeus Missile Tracking Radars and Target Tracking Radars (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and the additional radars were dropped. =Problems and alternatives= Calculations repeatedly showed that simple fallout shelters like this one would save many more civilians than an active defense like Nike-X, and for far less money. Nike-X had been defined in the early 1960s as a system to defend US cities and industrial centers against a heavy Soviet attack during the 1970s. By 1965 the growing fleets of ICBMs in the inventories of both the US and USSR were making the cost of such a system very expensive. NIE 11-8-63, published 18 October 1963, estimated the Soviets would have 400–700 ICBMs deployed by 1969, and their deployment eventually reached 1,601 launchers, limited by the SALT agreements. While Nike-X could be expected to attack these with a reasonable 1 to 1 exchange ratio, compared to Zeus' 20 to 1, it could only do so over a limited area. Most nationwide deployment scenarios contained thousands of Sprint missiles protecting only the largest US cities. Such a system would cost an estimated $40 billion to build ($ billion in , about half the annual military budget). This led to further studies of the system to try to determine whether an ABM would be the proper way to save lives, or if there was some other plan that would do the same for less money. In the case of Zeus, for instance, it was clear that building more fallout shelters would be less expensive and save more lives. A major report on the topic by PSAC in October 1961 made this point, suggesting that Zeus without shelters was useless, and that having Zeus might lead the US to \\"introduce dangerously misleading assumptions concerning the ability of the US to protect its cities\\". This led to a series of increasingly sophisticated models to better predict the effectiveness of an ABM system and what the opposition would do to improve their performance against it. A key development was the Prim-Read theory, which provided an entirely mathematical solution to generating the ideal defensive layout. Using a Prim-Read layout for Nike-X, Air Force Brigadier General Glenn Kent began considering Soviet responses. His 1964 report produced a cost-exchange ratio that required $2 of defense for every $1 of offence if one wanted to limit US casualties to 30 percent of the population. The cost increased to 6-to-1 if the US wished to limit casualties to 10 percent. ABMs would only be cheaper than ICBMs if the US was willing to allow over half its population to die in the exchange. When he realized he was using outdated exchange rates for the Soviet ruble, the exchange ratio for the 30 percent casualty rate jumped to 20-to-1. As the cost of defeating Nike-X by building more ICBMs was less than the cost of building Nike-X to counter them, reviewers concluded that the construction of an ABM system would simply prompt the Soviets to build more ICBMs. This led to serious concerns about a new arms race, which it was believed would increase the chance of an accidental war. When the numbers were presented to McNamara, according to Kent: In spite of its technical capabilities, Nike-X still shared one seemingly intractable problem that had first been noticed with Zeus. Facing an ABM system, the Soviets would change their targeting priorities to maximize damage, by attacking smaller, undefended cities for instance. Another solution was to drop their warheads just outside the range of the defensive missiles, upwind of the target. Ground bursts would throw enormous amounts of radioactive dust into the air, causing fallout that would be almost as deadly as a direct attack. This would make the ABM system essentially useless unless the cities were also extensively protected from fallout. Those same fallout shelters would save many lives on their own, to the point that the ABM seemed almost superfluous. While reporting to Congress on the issue in the spring of 1964, McNamara noted: Under any reasonable set of assumptions, even an advanced system like Nike-X offered only marginal protection and did so for huge costs. Around 1965, the ABM became what one historian calls a \\"technology in search of a mission\\". In early 1965, the Army launched a series of studies to find a mission concept that would lead to deployment. Hardpoint and Hardsite For even higher performance, the Hardsite concept replaced Sprint with HiBEX, which could accelerate at up to 400 g. One of the original deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their own. Their logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would reduce the number of losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. The same would be true if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, especially in the case of Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted. Things changed in the early 1960s when McNamara placed limits on the Air Force fleet of 1,000 Minuteman missiles and 54 Titan IIs. This meant that the Air Force could not respond to new Soviet missiles by building more of their own. An even greater existential threat to Minuteman than Soviet missiles was the US Navy's Polaris missile fleet, whose invulnerability led to questions about the need for ground-based ICBMs. The Air Force responded by changing missions; the increasingly accurate Minuteman was now tasked with attacking Soviet missile silos, which the less accurate Navy missiles could not do. If the force was going to carry out this mission there had to be the expectation that enough missiles could survive a Soviet attack for a successful counterstrike. An ABM might provide that assurance. A fresh look at this concept started at ARPA around 1963–64 under the name Hardpoint. This led to the construction of the Hardpoint Demonstration Array Radar, and an even faster missile concept known as HiBEX. This proved interesting enough for the Army and Air Force to collaborate on a follow-up study, Hardsite. The first Hardsite concept, HSD-I, considered the defending of bases within urban areas that would have Nike-X protection anyway. An example might be a SAC command and control center or an airfield on the outskirts of a city. The second study, HSD-II, considered the protection of isolated bases like missile fields. Most follow-up work focused on the HSD-II concept. HSD-II proposed building small Sprint bases close to Minuteman fields. Incoming warheads would be tracked until the last possible moment, decluttering them completely and generating highly accurate tracks. Since the warheads had to land within a short distance of a missile silo to damage it, any warheads that could be seen to be falling outside that area were simply ignored – only those entering the \\"Site Protection Volume\\" needed to be attacked. At the time, Soviet inertial navigation systems (INS) were not particularly accurate. This acted as a force multiplier, allowing a few Sprints to defend against many ICBMs. Although initially supportive of the Hardsite concept, by 1966 the Air Force came to oppose it largely for the same reasons it had opposed Zeus in the same role. If money was to be spent on protecting Minuteman, they felt that money would be better spent by the Air Force than the Army. As Morton Halperin noted: Small City Defense, PAR PARCS was originally designed to offer radar coverage over a large area, reducing the cost of the radars at each site in an SCD network. During the project's development phase, the siting and size of the Nike-X bases became a major complaint of smaller cities. Originally intended to protect only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system was simply too expensive to build with only a few interceptors. These cities complained that they were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to a series of studies on the Small City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment plans, with every major city being provided some level of defensive system. SCD would consist primarily of a single autonomous battery centered on a cut-down MAR called TACMAR (TACtical MAR), along with a simplified data processing system known as the Local Data Processor (LDP). This was essentially the DCDP with fewer modules installed, reducing the number of tracks it could compile and the amount of decluttering it could handle. To further reduce costs, Bell later replaced the cut-down MAR with an upgraded MSR, the \\"Autonomous MSR\\". They studied a wide variety of potential deployments, starting with systems like the original Nike-X proposal with no SCDs, to deployments offering complete continental US protection with many SCD modules of various types and sizes. The deployments were arranged so that they could be built in phases, working up to complete coverage. One issue that emerged from these studies was the problem of providing early warning to the SCD sites. The SCD's MSR radars provided detection at perhaps , which meant targets would appear on their radars only seconds before launches would have to be carried out. In a sneak attack scenario, there would not be enough time to receive command authority for the release of nuclear weapons. This meant the bases would require launch on warning authority, which was politically unacceptable. This led to proposals for a new radar dedicated solely to the early warning role, determining only which MAR or SCD would ultimately have to deal with the threat. Used primarily in the first minutes of the attack, and not responsible for the engagements, the system could be considered disposable and did not need anything like the sophistication or hardening of the MAR. This led to the Perimeter Acquisition Radar (PAR), which would operate cheaper electronics at VHF frequencies. X-ray attacks, Zeus EX Zeus EX, later known as Spartan, was the ultimate development of the original Nike Zeus. The high-altitude explosions that had caused so much concern for Nike Zeus due to blackout had been further studied in the early 1960s and led to a new possibility for missile defense. When a nuclear warhead explodes in a dense atmosphere, its initial high-energy X-rays ionize the air, blocking other X-rays. In the highest layers of the atmosphere, there is too little gas for this to occur, and the X-rays can travel long distances. Sufficient X-ray exposure to an RV can damage its heat shields. In late 1964 Bell was considering the role of an X-ray-armed Zeus missile in the Nike-X system. A January 1965 report outlines this possibility, noting that it would have to have a much larger warhead dedicated to the production of X-rays, and would have to operate at higher altitudes to maximize the effect. A major advantage was that accuracy needs were much reduced, from a minimum of about for the original Zeus' neutron-based attack, to something on the order of a few miles. This meant that the range limits of the original Zeus, which were defined by the accuracy of the radars to about , were greatly eased. This, in turn, meant that a less sophisticated radar could be used, one with accuracy on the order of a mile rather than feet, which could be built much less expensively using VHF parts. This Extended Range Nike Zeus, or Zeus EX for short, would be able to provide protection over a wider area, reducing the number of bases needed to provide full-country defense. Work on this concept continued throughout the 1960s, eventually becoming the primary weapon in the following Sentinel system, and in the modified Sentinel system that was later renamed Safeguard. Nth Country, DEPEX, I-67 In February 1965 the Army asked Bell to consider different deployment concepts under the Nth Country study. This examined what sort of system would be needed to provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with a limited number of warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, but that was not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks. With only small numbers of targets, the full MAR was not needed and Bell initially proposed TACMAR to fill this need. This would have a shorter detection range, so a long range radar like PAR would be needed for early detection. The missile sites would consist of a single TACMAR along with about 20 Zeus EX missiles. In October 1965 the TACMAR was replaced by the upgraded MSR from the SCD studies. Since this radar had an even shorter range than TACMAR, it could not be expected to generate tracking information in time for a Zeus EX launch. PAR would thus have to be upgraded to have higher accuracy and the processing power to generate tracks that would be handed off to the MSRs. During this same time, Bell had noted problems with long wavelength radars in the presence of radar blackout. Both of these issues argued for a change from VHF to UHF frequencies for the PAR. Further work along these lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX outlined a deployment that started out very similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as the nature of the threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment sequence that added more and more terminal defenses as the sophistication of the Nth Country missiles increased over time. In December 1966, the Army asked Bell to prepare a detailed deployment concept combining the light defense of Nth Country with the point defense of Hardsite. On 17 January 1967, this became the I-67 project, which delivered its results on 5 July. I-67 was essentially Nth Country but with more bases near Minuteman fields, armed primarily with Sprint. The wide-area Zeus and short-range Sprint bases would both be supported by the PAR network. =Continued pressure to deploy= Robert McNamara had resisted pressure to deploy Zeus knowing it would have little real-world effect, and faced the same problem with Nike-X four years later. The basic outlines of these various studies were becoming clear by 1966. The heavy defense from the original Nike-X proposals would cost about $40 billion ($ billion in ) and offer limited protection and damage prevention in an all-out attack, but would be expected to blunt or completely defeat any smaller attack. The thin defense of Nth Country would be much less expensive, around $5 billion ($ billion in ), but would only have any effect at all under certain limited scenarios. Finally, the Hardsite concepts would cost about the same as the thin defense, and provide some protection against a certain class of counterforce attacks. None of these concepts appeared to be worth deploying, but there was considerable pressure from Congressional groups dominated by hawks who continued to force development of the ABM even when McNamara and President Johnson had not asked for it. The debate spilled over into the public and led to comments about an \\"ABM gap\\", especially by Republican Governor George W. Romney. The Air Force continued their opposition to the ABM concept, having previously criticized their earlier efforts in the press, but the construction of the A-35 ABM systems around Tallinn and Moscow overrode their opposition. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) used the Soviet ABM as an argument for deployment, having previously had no strong opinion on the matter. McNamara attempted to short-circuit deployment in early 1966 by stating that the only program that had any reasonable cost-effectiveness was the thin defense against the Chinese, and then noted there was no rush to build such a system as it would be some time before they had an ICBM. Overruling him, Congress provided $167.9 million ($ billion in ) for immediate production of the original Nike-X concept. McNamara and Johnson met on the issue on 3 November 1966, and McNamara once again convinced Johnson that the system could not justify the cost of deployment. McNamara headed off the expected counterattack from Romney by calling a press conference on the topic of Soviet ABMs and stating that the new Minuteman III and Poseidon SLBM would ensure the Soviet system would be overwhelmed. Another meeting on the issue was called on 6 December 1966, attended by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took the side of the JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was to simply build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets. =Nike-X becomes Sentinel= By 1967 the debate over ABM systems had become a major public policy issue, with almost continual debate on the topic in newspapers and magazines. It was in the midst of these debates, on 17 June 1967, that the Chinese tested their first H-bomb in Test No. 6. Suddenly the Nth Country concept was no longer simply theoretical. McNamara seized on this event as a way to deflect criticism over the lack of deployment while still keeping costs under control. On 18 September 1967, he announced that Nike-X would now be known as Sentinel, and outlined deployment plans broadly following the I-67 concept. Testing Although the original Nike-X concept was canceled, some of its components were built and tested both as part of Nike-X and the follow-on Sentinel. MAR, MSR, Sprint and Spartan were the main programs during the Nike-X period. =MAR= MAR-I at White Sands, seen looking towards the south-southwest. The transmitter is on the small dome on the right, with its associated receiver on the main dome above it. The elements fill only a small area of the original antenna outlines. Work in ZMAR was already underway by the early 1960s, before McNamara canceled Zeus in 1963. Initial contracts were offered to Sylvania and General Electric (GE), who both built experimental systems consisting of a single row of elements, essentially a slice of a larger array. Sylvania's design used MOSAR phase-shifting using time delays, while GE's used a \\"novel modulation scanning system\\". Sylvania's system won a contract for a test system, which became MAR-I when Nike-X took over from Zeus. To save money, the prototype MAR-I would only install antenna elements for the inner section of the original diameter antenna, populating the central . This had the side- effect of reducing the number of antenna elements from 6,405 to 2,245 but would not change the basic control logic. The number of elements on the transmitter face was similarly reduced. A full sized, four-sided MAR would require 25,620 parametric amplifiers to be individually wired by hand, so building the smaller MAR-I greatly reduced cost and construction time. Both antennas were built full sized and could be expanded out to full MAR performance at any time. In spite of these cost reduction methods, MAR-I cost an estimated $100 million to build ($ million in ). A test site for MAR-I had already been selected at WSMR, about a mile off of US Route 70, and some north of the Army's main missile launch sites along WSMR Route 2 (Nike Avenue). A new road, WSMR Route 15, was built to connect the MAR-I to Launch Complex 38 (LC38), the Zeus launch site. MAR-I's northern location meant that the MAR would see the many rocket launches taking place at the Army sites to the south, as well as the target missiles that were launched towards them from the north from the Green River Launch Complex in Utah. Since MAR was central to the entire Nike-X system, it had to survive attacks directed at the radar itself. At the time, the response of hardened buildings to nuclear shock was not well understood, and the MAR-I building was extremely strong. It consisted of a large central hemispherical dome of thick reinforced concrete with similar but smaller domes arranged on the corners of a square bounding the central dome. The central dome held the receiver arrays, and the smaller domes the transmitters. The concept was designed to allow a transmitter and receiver to be built into any of the faces to provide wide coverage around the radar site. As a test site, MAR-I only installed the equipment on the northwest facing side, although provisions were made for a second set on the northeast side that was never used. A tall clutter fence surrounded the building, preventing reflections from nearby mountains. Groundbreaking on the MAR-I site started in March 1963 and construction proceeded rapidly. The radar was powered up for the first time in June 1964 and achieved its first successful tracking on 11 September 1964, repeatedly tracking and breaking lock on a balloon target over a 50-minute period. However, the system demonstrated very low reliability in the transmitter's travelling wave tube (TWT) amplifiers, which led to an extremely expensive re-design and re-installation. Once upgraded, MAR-I demonstrated the system would work as expected; it could generate multiple virtual radar beams, could simultaneously generate different types of beams for detection, tracking, and discrimination at the same time, and had the accuracy and speed needed to generate many tracks. By this time work had already begun on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it differed in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land just west of the original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, but with all the wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility. Testing on MAR-I lasted until 30 September 1967. It continued to be used at a lower level as part of the Sentinel developments. This work ended in May 1969, when the facility was mothballed. In November, the building was re-purposed as the main fallout shelter for everyone at Holloman Air Force Base, about to the east. To hold the 5,800 staff and their dependents, starting in 1970 the radar and its underground equipment areas were completely emptied. In the early 1980s, the site was selected as the basis for the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility, and extensively redeveloped. In 1972, Stirling Colgate, a professor at New Mexico Tech, wrote a letter to Science proposing salvaging MAR. He felt that after minor re-tuning it would make an excellent radio astronomy instrument for observing the hydrogen line. Colgate's suggestion was never adopted, but over 2000 of the Western Electric parametric amplifiers driving the system ended up being salvaged by the university. About a dozen of these found their way into the astronomy field, including Colgate's supernova detector, SNORT. About 2,000 remained in storage at New Mexico Tech until 1980. An assay at that time discovered that there was well over one ounce of gold in each one, and the remaining stocks were melted down to produce $941,966 for the university ($ million in ). The money was used to build a new wing on the university's Workman Center, known unofficially as the \\"Gold Building\\". =MSR= The prototype MSR was built onto the white pyramid on the building just left of center in this image. This was used into the 1970s, when the Safeguard program shut down. It was soon reactivated to test a smaller version of MSR known as the Site Defense Radar (SDR), which can be seen just to the right of the MSR. Bell ran studies to identify the sweet spot for the MSR that would allow it to have enough functionality to be useful at different stages of the attack, as well as being inexpensive enough to justify its existence in a system dominated by MAR. This led to an initial proposal for an S band system using passive scanning (PESA) that was sent out in October 1963. Of the seven proposals received, Raytheon won the development contract in December 1963, with Varian providing the high-power klystrons (twystrons) for the transmitter. An initial prototype design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. This led to a design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control computers and other features for the SCD system. The earlier Zeus system had taken up most of the available land on Kwajalein Island itself, so the missile launchers and MSR were to be built on Meck Island, about north. This site would host a complete MSR, allowing the Army to test both MAR-hosted (using MAR-II) and autonomous MSR deployments. A second launcher site was built on Illeginni Island, northwest of Meck, with two Sprint and two Spartan launchers. Three camera stations built to record the Illeginni launches were installed, and these continue to be used . Construction of the launch site on Meck began in late 1967. In this installation, the majority of the system was built above ground in a single- floor rectangular building. The MSR was built in a boxy extension on the northwestern corner of the roof, with two sides angled back to form a half- pyramid shape where the antennas were mounted. Small clutter fences were built to the north and northwest, and the western side faced out over the water which was only a few tens of meters from the building. Illeginni did not have a radar site; it was operated remotely from Meck. =Sprint= The sub-scale Squirt was used to test Sprint concepts. On 1 October 1962, Bell's Nike office sent specifications for a high-speed missile to three contractors. The responses were received on 1 February 1963, and Martin Marietta was selected as the winning bidder on 18 March. Sprint ultimately proved to be the most difficult technical challenge of the Nike-X system. Designed to intercept incoming warheads at an altitude of about , it had to have unmatched acceleration and speed. This caused enormous problems in materials, controls, and even receiving radio signals through the ionized air around the missile. The development program was referred to as \\"pure agony\\". In the original Nike-X plans, Sprint was the primary weapon and thus was considered to be an extremely high-priority development. To speed development, a sub-scale version of Sprint known as Squirt was tested from Launch Complex 37 at White Sands, the former Nike Ajax/Hercules test area. A total of five Squirts were fired between 6 November 1964 and 1965. The first Sprint Propulsion Test Vehicle (PTV) was launched from another area at the same complex on 17 November 1965, only 25 months after the final design was signed off. Sprint testing pre-dated construction of an MSR, and the missiles were initially guided by Zeus TTR and MTR radars. Testing continued under Safeguard, with a total of 42 test flights at White Sands and another 34 at Kwajalein. =Spartan= Zeus B had been test fired at both White Sands and the Zeus base on Kwajalein. For Nike-X, the extended range EX model was planned, replacing Zeus' second stage with a larger model that provided more thrust through the midsection of the boost phase. Also known as the DM-15X2, the EX was renamed Spartan in January 1967. The Spartan never flew as part of the original Nike-X, and its first flight in March 1968 took place under Sentinel. =Reentry testing= The RMP-2 tests in the late 1960s included the first live-fire MIRV tests with multiple reentry vehicles (MIRV). One of the reasons for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the difference between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; in particular, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead. The reentry phenomenology was of interest both to the Army, as it might allow long-range decluttering to be carried out, and to the Air Force, whose own ICBMs might be at risk of long-range interception if the Soviets exploited a similar concept. A program to test these concepts was a major part of ARPA's Project Defender, especially Project PRESS, which started in 1960. This led to the construction of high-power radar systems on Roi-Namur, the northernmost point of the Kwajalein atoll. Although the results remain classified, several sources mention the failure to find a reliable signature of this sort. In 1964, Bell Labs formulated their own set of requirements for radar work in relation to Nike-X. Working with the Army, Air Force, Lincoln Labs and ARPA, the Nike-X Reentry Measurements Program (RMP) ran a long series of reentry measurements with the Project PRESS radars, especially TRADEX. Additionally, a Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star aircraft was refit with optical and infrared telescopes for optical tracking tests. The first series of tests, RMP-A, focused on modern conical reentry vehicles. It concluded on 30 June 1966. These demonstrated that these vehicles were difficult to discriminate because of their low drag. RMP-B ran between 1967 and 1970, supported by 17 launches from Vandenberg, with a wide variety of vehicle shapes and penetration aids. The program ran until the 1970s, but by the late 1960s, it was clear that discrimination of decoys was an unsolved problem, although some of the techniques developed might still be useful against less sophisticated decoys. This work appears to be one of the main reasons that the thin defense of I-67 was considered worthwhile. At that time, in 1967, ARPA passed the PRESS radars to the Army. Description A typical Nike-X deployment around a major city would have consisted of several missile batteries. One of these would be equipped with the MAR and its associated DCDP computers, while the others would optionally have an MSR. The sites were all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the MAR to provide protection to this central station. Almost every aspect of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this centralization was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed to process the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries. =MAR= MAR-I had protective covers that slid up over the antenna elements, riding upward on the rails from their underground storage. MAR was an L band active electronically scanned phased- array radar. The original MAR-I had been built into a strongly reinforced dome, but the later designs consisted of two half-pyramid shapes, with the transmitters in a smaller pyramid in front of the receivers. The reduction in size and complexity was the result of studies on nuclear hardening, especially those carried out as part of Operation Prairie Flat and Operation Snowball in Alberta, where a sphere of TNT was detonated to simulate a nuclear explosion. MAR used separate transmitter and receivers, a necessity at the time due to the size of the individual transmit and receive units and the switching systems that would be required. Each transmitter antenna was fed by its own power amplifier using travelling wave tubes with switching diodes and striplines performing the delays. The broadcast signal had three parts in sequence and the receivers had three channels, one tuned to each part of the pulse chain. This allowed the receiver to send each part of the signal to different processing equipment, allowing search, track, and discrimination in a single pulse. MAR operated in two modes: surveillance and engagement. In surveillance mode, the range was maximized, and each face performed a scan in about 5 seconds. Returns were fed into systems that automatically extracted the range and velocity, and if the return was deemed interesting, the system automatically began a track for threat verification. During the threat verification phase, the radar spent more time examining the returns in an effort to accurately determine the trajectory and then ignored any objects that would fall outside its area. Those targets that did pose a threat automatically triggered the switch to engagement mode. This created a new beam constantly aimed at the target, sweeping its focus point through the threat tube to pick out individual objects within it. Data from these beams extracted velocity data to a separate computer to attempt to pick out the warhead as the decoys slowed in the atmosphere. Only one Coherent Signal Processing System (CSPS) was ever built, and for testing it was connected to the Zeus Discrimination Radar on Kwajalein. Nike-X also considered a cut down version of MAR known as TACMAR. This was essentially a MAR with half of the elements hooked up, reducing its price at the cost of shorter detection range. The processing equipment was likewise reduced in complexity, lacking some of the more sophisticated discrimination processing. TACMAR was designed from the start to be able to be upgraded to full MAR performance if needed, especially as the sophistication of the threat grew. MAR-II is sometimes described as the prototype TACMAR, but there is considerable confusion on this point in existing sources. =MSR= The TACMSR at Mickelsen was the only complete MSR built. The antenna elements only fill the center of the circular areas; the larger area was intended for possible future expansion As initially conceived, MSR was a short-range system for tracking Sprint missiles before they appeared in the MAR's view, as well as offering a secondary target and jammer tracking role. In this initial concept, the MSR would have limited processing power, just enough to create tracks to feed back to the MAR. In the anti-jamming role, each MAR and MSR would measure the angle to the jammer. The MSR was an S-band passive electronically scanned array (PESA), unlike the actively scanned MAR. A PESA system cannot (normally) generate multiple signals like AESA, but is much less expensive to build because a single transmitter and receiver is used for the entire system. The same antenna array can easily be used for both transmitting and receiving, as the area behind the array is much less cluttered and has ample room for switching in spite of the large radio frequency switches needed at this level of power. Unlike the MAR, which would be tracking targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in all directions. MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with any or all of the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser systems could reduce the number of faces and get the same information by sending tracking data from site to site. =Sprint= Sprint was the centerpiece of the original Nike-X concept, but it was relegated to a secondary role in Sentinel. Sprint was the primary weapon of Nike-X as originally conceived; it would have been placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the MAR system. Each missile was housed in an underground silo and was driven into the air before launch by a gas-powered piston. The missile was initially tracked by the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the MAR as soon as it became visible. A transponder in the missile would respond to signals from either the MAR or MSR to provide a powerful return for accurate tracking. Although a primary concern of the Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not optimized for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its manoeuvrability. Staging was under ground control, with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control. The first stage accelerated the missile at over 100 g, reaching Mach 10 in a few seconds. At these speeds, aerodynamic heating caused the airframe's outer layer to become hotter than an oxy-acetylene welding torch. The required acceleration required a new solid fuel mixture that burned ten times as fast as contemporary designs such as the Pershing or Minuteman. The burning fuel and aerodynamic heating together created so much heat that radio signals were strongly attenuated through the resulting ionized plasma around the missile body. It was expected that the average interception would take place at about at a range of after 10 seconds of flight time. Two warheads were designed for Sprint starting in 1963, the W65 at Livermore and the W66 at Los Alamos. The W65 was entering Phase 3 testing in October 1965 with a design yield of around 5 kT, but this was cancelled in January 1968 in favor of the W66. The W66's explosive yield was reported to have been in the \\"low kiloton\\" range, with various references claiming it was anywhere from 1 to 20 kT. The W66 was the first enhanced radiation bomb, or neutron bomb, to be fully developed; it was tested in the late 1960s and entered production in June 1974.

Its population is approximately 4,000. A large portion of the village is part of the Castleton Village Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It is also home to Castleton University, founded in 1787, and now part of the Vermont State Colleges system. Geography Castleton Village is located in the south-central part of the town of Castleton, on the south side of the Castleton River, about midway between Rutland, Vermont and Whitehall, New York. Main Street runs east-west through the village, designated Vermont Route 4A; United States Route 4, a limited- access highway, runs east-west on the north side of the river. The village center is at North Road and South Street, which provide access to rural parts of the town; Vermont Route 30, the principal north-south artery in the town, is west of the village. The village has one active rail line, running east- west north of Main Street, that presently carries the Amtrak Ethan Allen Express, stopping at the station at the east end of the village. History Castleton Village was settled in the early 1770s, and Main Street was laid out in 1772 as the principal east-west route in the region. In 1775 the village is where Ethan Allen mustered the Green Mountain Boys for the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga, early in the American Revolutionary War. Castleton College was founded in 1787, and Castleton Medical College was founded in 1818, both located on the south side of Main Street. The town was prosperous in the 19th century because of the marble and slate industries, and benefited from the construction of two railroad lines in the 1850s. Around the turn of the century the tourist industry, serving summer trade at Lake Bomoseen, resulted in the construction of hotels and other service facilities. The village was devastated by a series of fires in the 1910s, which destroyed a number of landmark buildings. Most of the village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for its 19th-century architectural character.

The quality of education, Behaviour and attitudes, Personal development and Leadership and management were all related requires improvement. The sixth form was rated 'good'. The inspection was carried out whilst the head teacher was absent. The report said that 'in some lessons their learning is disturbed by the poor behaviour of other pupils'and that ' This mainly happens when they have cover teachers or non-specialist staff.' However, the report pays attention to the fact that 'Most pupils at St Benedict’s are happy, confident and enjoy school.' The school was last inspected in 2012 https://files.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/2147387 and in 2007 https://files.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/866779 , in which it was rated outstanding both times.

The debut episode originally aired in the United States on February 17, 2014 on NBC. Synopsis The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon premiered on February 17, 2014, following NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics (the show started at midnight, past its usual 11:35 start time, as a result). Fallon strolled out to applause, making light jokes referencing the storied franchise's host debacle of four years prior. He introduced his supporting stars and gave a brief history of his life and career, thanking his parents (who were in the audience) and explaining how his nightly monologue would work. Following this, he once again took his place behind the curtain, restarting the show with more topical jokes on the Olympics and his first bit, Tonight Show Superlatives (an extension of a similarly titled bit from his Late Night tenure). After taking his place behind the desk for the first time, Fallon took a moment to chide a friend who once bet him $100 he would never host The Tonight Show. After this, Robert De Niro emerged from behind the curtain, laid $100 down on Fallon's desk, and promptly exited. (De Niro was Fallon's first guest on Late Night in 2009.) De Niro wasn't the only person to settle the bet: One by one, a line of celebrities followed him to Fallon's desk to give Jimmy their $100, including Tina Fey, Joe Namath, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani (who can be heard thanking Fallon for bringing Tonight back to the Big Apple), Mariah Carey, Tracy Morgan, Joan Rivers (a former guest host on Johnny Carson's Tonight making her first appearance on Tonight since falling out with Carson in the mid-1980s), Kim Kardashian, Seth Rogen, Lindsay Lohan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Mike Tyson, Lady Gaga, and late-night rival Stephen Colbert. Colbert, the last to pay up, offered his $100 by dumping a bucket of pennies on Fallon, greeting him to the same time slot as his show, The Colbert Report, shouting \\"Welcome to 11:30, bitch!\\" to Fallon, and taking a selfie with him that he later posted to his Twitter feed. Following the first commercial break, guest Will Smith and Fallon launched into a pre-taped sketch titled \\"The Evolution of Hip-Hop Dancing,\\" rotating through various synchronized moves such as the Robot, the Humpty Dance, the Dougie and more; when Fallon begins to twerk, Smith walks offstage in disgust. The next segment took place at the Top of the Rock, the roof of the 30 Rockefeller Plaza, with U2 performing their new single \\"Invisible\\" to the Manhattan skyline as the sun set. The rooftop staging was devised by executive producer Lorne Michaels the previous Wednesday, with its odd placement in the middle of the show to take advantage of the sunset. Next, Fallon welcomed Smith for the interview, with topics ranging from his parody of Willow Smith's \\"Whip My Hair\\" as Neil Young, and Smith's recent skydiving endeavor. U2 then returned and took their places on the couch for a short interview and an acoustic rendition of their single \\"Ordinary Love,\\" accompanied by The Roots. Fallon ecstatically closed the show and ran through the audience, high-fiving fans and seeking out his parents in the audience. Reception =Critical reviews= The debut episode received mixed but generally positive reviews. The New York Times Alessandra Stanley referred to the show's premiere as \\"more sweet than sassy,\\" calling Fallon \\"the grateful heir, the eager freshman, the class clown with top grades and a good heart, someone older viewers can embrace without fear of being mocked or overlooked.\\" Steve Johnson of the Chicago Tribune wrote that \\"If he didn't exactly come roaring out of the gate, Fallon did demonstrate the mixture of old-world courteousness, junior-high-school goofiness and seemingly unending enthusiasm that has charmed audiences, network bosses and fellow stars.\\" Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly wrote that \\"No one is more excited than Jimmy,\\" noting that \\"It will be interesting to see over the months (and hopefully years) to follow how he evolves behind the desk.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Fallon's \\"easy-to-like TV persona [and] gentle style,\\" calling the host well-suited to the format. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter was positive in his assessment of the evening, but noted the older fanbase used to Leno may not latch on as quickly. James Poniewozik of Time found Fallon's introduction, including his background and \\"incredibly brilliant [...] So each introduction Fallon made was a chance to frame the story, from the beginning, in a way that could make these longtime Tonight viewers—many of them older—comfortable with him, even while he hopefully brought in new ones.\\" Some critics, however, felt that Fallon overcompensated in terms of gratitude and humility. Bianco also said, \\"While gratitude and humility are admirable traits, there were times in Monday's opening moments when Fallon risked taking them to uncomfortable extremes.\\" Slate Magazine's Willa Paskin tended to agree, noting that \\"Fallon's appeal is how earnest and energetic he is: the king of comedic kindness. [...] But his opening bit revealed just how much Fallon and his staff understand the power—and not just the authenticity—of Jimmy’s ultimate-nice-guy persona: They sold the hell out of it.\\" \\"Indeed, Fallon comes across as eager to please almost to a fault, and he treated his Tonight Show launch very much like a guy auditioning to be accepted into homes,\\" said Brian Lowry of Variety, who considered the premiere episode a demonstration in Fallon's strengths and weaknesses. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times called it, following the hype, \\"conspicuously, and seemingly consciously, low-energy.\\" =Ratings= The debut episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon averaged a 3.8 rating in adults 18–49 and 11.31 million viewers overall in Nielsen's fast-national estimates. This made it the second-largest audience for The Tonight Show since May 2009, behind Leno's final farewell two weeks earlier, and the transition to Conan O'Brien nearly five years prior. The program's first full week averaged 8.490 million viewers, making it the franchise's most-watched week in 20 years.

Chen Lan (陳蘭) and Mei Cheng (梅成), two former subordinates of the warlord Yuan Shu, were the ones who started the rebellion. The warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government, sent two separate forces to suppress the rebellion: Yu Jin and Zang Ba were to attack Mei Cheng, while Zhang Liao, with Zhang He and Niu Gai (牛蓋) as his deputies, were to attack Chen Lan. As soon as the two forces clashed, Mei Cheng pretended to surrender to Yu Jin, and then led his men to join Chen Lan at Mount Tianzhu as soon as Yu Jin and Zang Ba left.(陳蘭、梅成以氐六縣叛，太祖遣于禁、臧霸等討成，遼督張郃、牛蓋等討蘭。成偽降禁，禁還。成遂將其衆就蘭，轉入灊山。灊中有天柱山，高峻二十餘里，道險狹，步徑裁通，蘭等壁其上。遼欲進，諸將曰：「兵少道險，難用深入。」遼曰：「此所謂一與一，勇者得前耳。」遂進到山下安營，攻之，斬蘭、成首，盡虜其衆。太祖論諸將功，曰：「登天山，履峻險，以取蘭、成，盪寇功也。」增邑，假節。) Sanguozhi vol. 17. On the other hand, Zhang Liao was worried that Cao Cao's rival, the warlord Sun Quan, would send his general Han Dang with an army to assist Chen Lan. Han Dang was in charge of defending Wancheng (皖城), a major stronghold in Lujiang Commandery at the time, so Zhang Liao sent Zang Ba to attack Wancheng so as to ensure that Han Dang could not move to reinforce the rebels. Zang Ba attacked Wancheng, but Han Dang defended the city well and succeeded in driving Zang Ba back. Later Sun Quan dispatched an army of some 20,000 to 30,000 troops to assist Chen Lan but Zang Ba was able to ambush and drive away the reinforcements sent by Sun Quan.(權遣數萬人乘船屯舒口，分兵救蘭，聞霸軍在舒，遁還。) Sanguozhi vol. 18. However, Zang Ba did not stop there as he gave chase at night and attacked in the morning. Many soldiers of Sun Quan could not board their ships, and were forced into the water and drowned. Without the intervention from Sun Quan, Zhang Liao suppressed Chen Lan's rebellion and both he and Mei Chen were killed.Chapter 58 of the Chronicle of Han [containing Part 8 of the reign of Emperor Xian quoting San Guo Zhi and Zizhi Tongjian mention Chen Lan beheaded at the end] References * Chen, Shou.

As a \\"technical scuba diver with over 600 dives on the Mesoamerican Reef,\\" Belliveau's photography was instrumental in establishing the definitive map for the coral reef of the Mexican island of Cozumel. Belliveau also participated in an historic archaeological dig in southwest France, unearthing a centuries-old Christian monastery, located at the current site of Abbatiale Saint-Maixent de Saint-Maixent-l'École. In addition, Belliveau's photography and writing have been highlighted in numerous periodicals, magazines and books, including The New York Times, Petersen's Photographic Magazine, Smithsonian Magazine and BBC’s Planet Earth.  Early life  Denis Belliveau was born in Whitestone, Queens; as a Roman Catholic Christian, he was \\"inspired to follow his passion for art and travel by his uncle, Father Paul Belliveau, a Maryknoll missionary\\", who was stationed in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. He studied at the High School of Art and Design as well as the School of Visual Arts, both of which are in Manhattan, New York. At the School of Visual Arts, Denis Belliveau \\"earned an Associates Degree in painting, sculpture and fine arts.\\" In 1987, Belliveau joined his parents' photography studio that specialized in weddings and during the off-season, he would travel; it was during this time that he joined professional photography organizations, including Kodak.  Career  After Denis Belliveau left the wedding photography studio in 1991, he became captivated by the idea of \\"following Marco Polo’s route from Venice to China and back.\\" As such, Denis Belliveau and a friend named Francis O'Donnell, who met on an archaeological dig in Saint-Maixent-l'École, southwest France, and hailed from the same academic institution, decided to trace Marco Polo's journey as recorded in Polo's Book of the Marvels of the World. Denis Belliveau, along with his companion, was the first individual \\"to visit and document every region Marco Polo claimed to have traveled using only\\" land and sea methods of transportation. Belliveau's story and photography on this mission was compiled into a News and Documentary Emmy nominated film, as well as a book by the same name (published by Rowman & Littlefield), titled In the Footsteps of Marco Polo; it \\"has been used as the basis for a unique curriculum\\" throughout schools in the United States and around the world. The same academic press has used Denis Belliveau's images in other books, such as Digging Through The Bible by Richard A. Freund. Denis Belliveau was \\"the Director of Photography and Senior Cameraman for the national public television series Real Moms, Real Stories, Real Savvy\\", which was acquired by Disney in 2010. He received Eastman Kodak's highest honor, its Gallery Award, for an image of a Quechua boy captured in Peru. In total, Denis Belliveau's career has taken him to over sixty countries in the world.

Regulatory agencies have the power to exercise this type of discretion in their day-to-day activities, and there have been cases where regulatory agencies have abused this power. Administrative law can help these agencies get on the path of following regulations, serve the public, and in turn, a reflection of the public's values and beliefs. There is a need for administrative law because the interest of public could be at risk if various agencies were not following laws and regulations. Administrative law is important because without it, it could lead to arbitrary and unreasonable use of such discretion, which may lead to destruction of basic principles of administrative law. Although this type of discretion isn't laid out in the job-description of a bureaucrat/public servant, it is necessary because citizens use these bureaucratic institutions every day; such as the D.M.V. , public schooling, and numerous others. Street-level bureaucrats have to deal with the provision of service as well as translating vaguely worded mandates into specific cohesive and comprehensive language to organize protocol. Administrative discretion allows agencies to use professional expertise and judgment when making decisions or performing official duties, as opposed to only adhering to strict regulations or statuses. For example, a public official has administrative discretion when he or she has the freedom to make a choice among potential courses of action. The failure to exercise reasonable judgment or discretion is abuse of discretion. \\"I think that in our system of government, where law ends, tyranny need not begin. Where law ends, discretion begins, and the exercise of discretion may mean either beneficence or tyranny, either justice or injustice, either reasonableness or arbitrariness.\\"—Kenneth Culp Davis History The idea of administrative discretion dates back as far as the time of widely known Greek philosopher Socrates in his quest to lay the foundation for philosophical ethics. Socrates determined a general ranking of \\"universal morals\\" in order to piece together certain criterion that could test what course of action to take in any immediate situation. He assigned value orders as well as certain \\"means to ends\\" that would determine alternatives for ethical philosophical generalization. In doing so, Socrates was creating the first type of basis for administrative discretion. Andrew Jackson 1873 Postage Stamp—US Postal Service When Andrew Jackson took office in 1829, the country was going through radical changes—the scale of government grew extensively which caused the need for an increase in the administrative activity. Jackson brought the bureaucratization of administration. He appointed his close friends to office to work in administered processes. This was known as the \\"spoils system\\", in which was a system was in place where presidential administrations had the power of hiring or firing federal workers; this brought a constant change in demands and routines for personnel. Of his additions to the administrative discretion and of bureaucracy as we know it today, one in particular, the creation of The Patent Reform Act of 1836 brought about the creation of new offices and adjudicatory administrative boards. Although, perhaps unknowingly, Jackson brought a new age to administrative discretion. Another president who has come in contact with administrative discretion is Madison. Known as Madison's Managers, drafted in 1787, some argue that early public administration literature had it right. After Jackson, many presidents followed suit of his example—appointing members to administrative processes. In some cases, officials appointed by the presidents abused their powers in administration. There were attempts to control administrative discretion throughout the 19th century, but those attempts overall, failed. Political appointees believed they indeed were law themselves—Jesse Hoyt and his successor Samuel Swartwout for example, notoriously did not comply with the rule to return funds they had collected on behalf of the Federal Government. However, within the 20th century, substantial changes occurred that better formed the concept of administrative discretion as we know it today. Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal brought much needed relief to the public by implementing welfare programs in a dire time of crisis. There was a type of bureaucratic \\"sprawl\\": this era saw the creation of numerous agencies and boards. The birth of such a large bureaucracy, not only helped in aiding the public, but Roosevelt’s programs also answered important question of who would be part of the bureaucracy and govern future welfare programs. The New Deal emphasized the importance of administrative discretion in government and their processes by expanding the staff of the White House and creating new managerial techniques for the executive. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 was created to govern the internal procedures of administrative agencies and how those agencies interact with the public. The act came about after the Attorney General appointed a committee to investigate the need for procedural reform. The notion of the time (not too far off-base of popular public notion today) was that various agencies were created by Congress over a long period of time in a piece-mail, haphazard manner. The view was that there was no uniformity in the chaotic bodies to administer anything. The 1946 act places policies on agencies’ rule-making, adjudications, and licensing behavior. The intention was to make sure that the public is protected and safe, with secured proper entitlements. Examples of administrative discretion in law Compiègne Justice Goldberg v. Kelly—In this 1970 case, City officials were administrating and terminating public assistance benefits under the federally assisted program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and/or under New York State’s Home Relief Program in New York City. The problem arose as residents receiving financial aid claimed that the New York City officials overseeing and administering these programs terminated their aid without notifying them or holding a hearing. Recipients alleged that this was unconstitutional on the Administration's part because it denying them due process of law guaranteed under the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment (Case Briefs). In this case, Administrative Discretion resulted in individualized parameters of what was deemed necessary to convey a termination of aid, instead of a federal standard. The Holding of Chief Justice Warren Burger and the court sided with the appellants' view: a full hearing of evidence is required before a recipient can be denied/deprived of certain types of government benefits. In other words, a recipient must receive some sort of notice should their aid be changed/terminated; whether in writing or orally. Industrial Union Department v. American Petroleum Institute--In this 1980, Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (or OSHA), The Secretary of Labor was required to explicitly state exposure risks/limits at the lowest level of carcinogens that won't impair viability of the industries regulated. However, this failed to happen. The Secretary did not say or record anywhere that exposure to the substance benzene at 10 ppm (parts per million) would cause leukemia and exposure to 1 ppm would not (Oyez cases). The holding of the Supreme Court, under Justice Warren Burger, concluded that there was a statute for a requirement of significant risk, and the Secretary and agency had failed to uphold the statue of workers' health at risks. In this case, Administrative Discretion under the Secretary of Labor had not understood the \\"extent feasible\\" . Citizens To Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v Volpe--In this 1971 case, in Memphis, Tennessee, a group of citizens claimed that The Secretary of Transportation made the decision to have construction of a highway where Overton Park was located and violated statutes enacted by the congress. The court holding under justice Burger upheld the \\"feasible and prudent\\" clause: wherein an alternative exists to circumvent building the proposed highway through the park. Furthermore, the Secretary's decision to use federal money for the highway did not comply with the Department of Transportation Act of 1966. The IRS Tea Party Controversy: The IRS must exercise discretion in administering the tax law. The IRS oversees a vast system that affects nearly everyone. Since the law is complex and often difficult to interpret, the IRS must draw fine lines in order to properly interpret, apply, and enforce the law. The IRS claims it gave extra scrutiny to Tea Party-affiliated groups based solely on the name and goals of the groups. The IRS asked those groups invasive questions that were not normally asked of other groups: about their donor lists, affiliations and contacts with the media . Administrative Discretion in Criminal Law Enforcement-- When a government official of law enforcement uses their own sense of ethical discretion such as not to or to invoke in criminal process. There are two major situational motivations of police discretion; whether police response is internally invoked or citizen initiated and whether it is a law enforcement of order maintenance situation. The two situational motivations combine to create four types of discretionary situations for law enforcement officials. The four different situations are proactive and reactive law enforcement and proactive and reactive order maintenance. Modern day administrative discretion In today’s administrative discretion, some issues affect the way organizations function and the way the public feels towards administrations/agencies as a whole. In this way public administrators are seen as \\"moral agents\\"; they are given the task to exercise discretion, and reflect the society’s values. In theory, the public expects administrators to be the exemplary role models of society and follow laws and regulations. thumbShimer College dialogue transparency 2010 \\"We want dialogue and transparency.\\" In reality, some do not think the administrators play fair and the public feels distrusts towards them. In a poll done by Gallup.com, the public showed an increase in the mistrust in government. People were asked if corruption was widespread throughout the government. The results recorded from 2006 to 2013 rose significantly; from 56% to 79%. The public may know little to nothing about the administration or their responsibilities, yet approval is very low. Some attribute this mistrust to a lack of transparency, where corruption can occur. The lack of transparency can mean that an administration is not completely honest, secretly keeping hidden agendas: withholding information from public view. It can also simply mean that the administration does not attempt to make their information easy to access or understand for the public(regutoraly). References Further reading *Adler, J.H. (2014).

The sculptures are believed to have been created around 1506 to 1508, before the painting of Sistine Chapel ceiling fresco but after the marble statue of David. The bronzes are now considered the only known surviving bronze works by the artist in existence. The bronzes were displayed to the public at the University of Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum from February to August 2015. Sculptures The two high bronzes each feature a nude male (one young, one old) mounted on the back of a mythological panther-like animal. The sculptures are unsigned but recent assessments by scholars and art experts have attributed the bronzes to Michelangelo. Attribution The bronzes were formerly the property of Baron Adolphe de Rothschild and were exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1878 as the work of Michelangelo, although this attribution was disputed at the time. The Rothschilds had acquired the statues the previous year from their owner in Venice. When his heir Maurice de Rothschild died in 1957, they were purchased by a French private collector. Over the years, the sculptures have been attributed to other artists, including Tiziano Aspetti, Jacopo Sansovino and Benvenuto Cellini, or their respective circles. In 2002, they were again sold at Sotheby’s London, to a British collector for £1.8m, with a loose attribution to Cellini. In 2012, they were exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts as being from the circle of Michelangelo, although experts declined to attribute them directly to him. In February 2015, a team of experts from the University of Cambridge attributed the statues to Michelangelo. This was primarily based on their similarity to a detail in a drawing by one of Michelangelo's students, held at the Musée Fabre in Montpellier, their similarity in technique to other works by Michelangelo and a neutron scan, conducted in Switzerland, which dated the bronzes to the first decade of the 16th century. The possibility that they might be by Michelangelo excited experts, particularly given that at the time no other Michelangelo bronzes are known to have survived. Alternative Attribution Paul Joannides included in his defense of the bronzes as being the work of Michelangelo two arguments, the first being that no other artist had been put forward as a possible creator of the figures, and second, that no argument had been made that these figures are not the work of the artist. Addressing the first of these issues, in 2020, Michael Riddick, in his \\"A Proposal that the Rothschild bronzes, attributed to Michelangelo, are instead the work of Francesco da Sangallo,\\" arguing that the Rothschild bronzes are more likely to be the work of Francesco da Sangallo, the protégé of Michelangelo and son of Giuliano da Sangallo who mentored Michelangelo in architecture. Refutation To the second of Joannides' questions, in 2019, in his \\"Michelangelo's Principles of Composition\\" John Vedder Edwards points out that the Rothschild bronzes are composed in an \\"open profile,\\" with their arms fully extended. This, Edwards argues, is in direct contravention of Michelangelo's principle of organizing his sculptural figures in a classic \\"closed profile\\" with the arms and legs drawn tightly in toward the body. Edwards argues that Michelangelo took to heart the instruction of early Renaissance sculptor Donatello that \\"a sculpture should be able to be rolled down a hill and have nothing break off.\\" The presence of an \\"open profile,\\" Edwards asserts, is definitive of a work being of an artist other than Michelangelo. Edwards does suggest that it is not impossible that Michelangelo may have aided Sangallo with the modelling of the torsos of the original wax figures, however there is no evidence to suggest that this must be so.John Edwards, \\"Michelangelo's Principles of Composition, Cambridge Springs Press, 2019. Verification In November 2018, the bronzes were verified by the Fitzwilliam Museum as being by Michelangelo based on anatomical features which were specific to his body of work.

Cultural significance Lime tree in Kaditz, photo =Slavic mythology= In old Slavic mythology, the linden (lipa, as called in all Slavic languages) was considered a sacred tree.Archaeology and Language: Language change and cultural transformation Roger Blench, Matthew Spriggs, p.199 Particularly in Poland, many villages have the name \\"Święta Lipka\\" (or similar), which literally means \\"Holy Lime\\". To this day, the tree is a national emblem of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Lusatia. Lipa gave name to the traditional Slavic name for the month of June (Croatian, lipanj) or July (Polish, lipiec, Ukrainian \\"lypen'/липень\\" - july). It is also the root for the German city of Leipzig, taken from the Sorbian name lipsk.Hanswilhelm Haefs. Das 2. Handbuch des nutzlosen Wissens. The Croatian currency, kuna, consists of 100 lipa (Tilia). \\"Lipa\\" was also a proposed name for Slovenian currency in 1990, however the name \\"tolar\\" ultimately prevailed.See Slovenska lipa In the Slavic Orthodox Christian world, limewood was the preferred wood for panel icon painting. The icons by the hand of Andrei Rublev, including the Holy Trinity (Hospitality of Abraham), and The Savior, now in the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, are painted on linden wood. Its wood was chosen for its ability to be sanded very smooth and for its resistance to warping once seasoned. The southern Slovenian village of \\"Lipica\\" signifies little Lime tree and has given its name to the Lipizzan horse breed. =Baltic mythology= In Baltic mythology, there is an important goddess of fate by the name of Laima /laɪma/, whose sacred tree is the lime. Laima‘s dwelling was a lime-tree, where she made her decisions as a cuckoo. For this reason Lithuanian women prayed and gave sacrifices under lime-trees asking for luck and fertility. They treated lime-trees with respect and talked with them as if they were human beings. =Germanic mythology= Avenue with linden in the cemetery by Ringkøbing, Jutland, Denmark The linden was also a highly symbolic and hallowed tree to the Germanic peoples in their native pre-Christian Germanic mythology. Originally, local communities assembled not only to celebrate and dance under a linden tree, but to hold their judicial thing meetings there in order to restore justice and peace. It was believed that the tree would help unearth the truth. Thus the tree became associated with jurisprudence even after Christianization, such as in the case of the Gerichtslinde, and verdicts in rural Germany were frequently returned sub tilia (Unter der linden) until the Age of Enlightenment. In the Nibelungenlied, a medieval German work ultimately based on oral tradition recounting events amongst the Germanic tribes in the 5th and 6th centuries, Siegfried gains his invulnerability by bathing in the blood of a dragon. While he did so, a single linden leaf sticks to him, leaving a spot on his body untouched by the blood and he thus has a single point of vulnerability. The most notable street in Berlin, Germany, is called Unter den Linden, named after the trees lining the avenue. It leads from the center of Berlin to Potsdam, the country residence of the Prussian kings. In German folklore, the linden tree is the \\"tree of lovers.\\" The well-known Middle High German poem Under der linden by Walter von der Vogelweide (c. 1200) describes a tryst between a maid and a knight under a linden tree. Hohenlinden (translated as \\"High linden\\") is a community in the upper Bavarian district of Ebersberg in which the Battle of Hohenlinden took place; Thomas Campbell wrote the poem Hohenlinden about said battle. =Greek mythology= Homer, Horace, Virgil, and Pliny mention the linden tree and its virtues. As Ovid tells the old story of Baucis and Philemon, she was changed into a linden and he into an oak when the time came for them both to die. Herodotus says: Philyra, mother of the centaur Chiron, turned into a linden tree after bearing Chiron. =Literary references= * J. R. R. Tolkien composed the poem Light as Leaf on Lindentree which was originally published in 1925 in volume 6 of The Gryphon magazine. After many emendations it was later included in The Lord of the Rings as a song sung by Aragorn about the tale of Beren and Lúthien. * One of the best known poems of the Minnesanger Walther von der Vogelweide is Under der linden, which describes a tryst between a maid and a knight under a linden tree. * A play called The Linden Tree (1947) was written by Bradford-born English novelist, playwright and broadcaster J. B. Priestley. * Samuel Taylor Coleridge features linden trees as an important symbol in his poem \\"This Lime- Tree Bower My Prison\\" (written 1797; first published 1800). * The short poems (Fraszki) of Polish poet Jan Kochanowski commonly feature linden trees, especially \\"Na Lipę\\" (\\"To The Tilia Tree\\"), published in 1584. Kochanowski was heavily influenced by the Czarnolas, or the Polish Black Forest, where it is the dominant tree species. * A poem from Wilhelm Müller's Winterreise cycle of poems is called \\"Der Lindenbaum\\" (\\"The Linden Tree\\"). In 1827, Franz Schubert wrote the famous song cycle \\"Winterreise\\" (D 911) based on these poems. In Thomas Mann's novel The Magic Mountain, a recording of this song cycle is an important plot device and philosophical touchstone. * Hans Christian Andersen's short story \\"The Elf of the Rose\\" mentions a linden tree and its leaves frequently. * Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther features a linden tree throughout the novel, and the protagonist, Werther, is buried under the tree after his suicide. * In Swann's Way, the first book of Proust's In Search of Lost Time, the narrator dips a petite madeleine into a cup of Tilia blossom tea. The aroma and taste of cake and tea triggers his first conscious involuntary memory. * \\"The Three Linden Trees\\" is a 1912 fairy tale by Hermann Hesse strongly influenced by the Greek legend of Damon and Pythias. The story, set in the medieval period, tries to explain three huge linden trees whose branches intertwine to cover the entire cemetery of the Hospital of the Holy Spirit in Berlin (see The Complete Fairy Tales of Hermann Hesse). * John Updike's novel The Centaur, like James Joyce in Ulysses, uses myth in an attempt to turn a modern and common scene into something more profound, a meditation on life and man's relationship to nature and eternity. In it Updike parallels the lives of modern characters with the Greek myth in which Chiron's mother Philyra transforms into a linden tree to escape the shame of giving birth to a seemingly mutant half-horse, half-man as a result of her being raped by Kronos.Jonathan Miller, \\"Off-Centaur\\", New York Times Book Review, 1 February 1963. * The lime tree is referred to in the story \\"The Man Who Planted Trees\\" by Jean Giono.

He was faithful friend of Jean-Paul Marat; through this friendship with the so-called L'Ami du peuple, (Friend of the People, the title of one of Marat's pamphlets), Bentabole acquired the nickname \\"Marat Cadet\\". The death of Marat on 14 July 1793, brought some of the internal frictions of the Montagnards to head, principally between Bentabole and the powerful Robespierre. On the day following Marat's assassination, the Convention rushed to praise Marat for his fervor and revolutionary diligence. Robespierre did not join in the praise, simply calling for an inquiry into the circumstances of his death. The Convention discussed at length the plans for Marat's funeral, to be held in his honor; it would necessarily be an affair of State, and, because of Marat's poverty, would have to be at the State's expense. Robespierre was no great supporter of Marat, saw no need for a public funeral, fearing, perhaps that it would arouse popular anger or provoke violence, as the funeral of Claude Lazowski had earlier in the year. The dispute between Bentabole and Robespierre continued; Robespierre saw no need neither to bury the body need Mirabeau; Bentabole insisted.Warren Roberts, Jacques-Louis David and Jean- Louis Prieur, Revolutionary Artists, Albany, SUNY Press, 2000, p. 289. Purification of the Revolution At the beginning of the year 1794, he was elected member of the Committee of War. In August 1793, he sent as a representative on mission to the Northern army. By August 1794, Bentabole was already distancing himself from the arch-Montigards. The problem in the Committees was that attacks on any member of the convention could come from any source; a statement, whether muttered privately or pronounced from the dais, could generate a cascade of accusations. Bentabole had led an attack on the Jacobin Club, which he accused of seeking to supplant the convention and to be dominated by lobbyists. > Among the opinions offered to the Tribunal, I noticed Durand-Maillane's, for > which I request that he give us a report.

Accessed 6 February 2015. His proposal received excited applause. Yet, while watching the Terror spread around him, Bentabole could do little to stop it, or thought as much, and sought as much time as he could away from Paris. In January 1794, he accepted an assignment into Sarthe; during this mission that he started a relationship with a wealthy aristocrat widow Adelaide Charlotte Chabot (a connection of the House of Rohan). When he returned to Paris in March 1795, she came with him, as his wife.Robert Heron, Maurice Montgaillard (comte de), Information concerning the strength, views, and interests of the powers presently at war, Perth, R. Morrison and Son, 1794, p. 205.Through this union, he bought land and became lord of La Bazoche-Gouet in Eure-et-Loir. He also owned with his wife one of the largest gambling houses in Paris, close to Maison Duplay, which lay near to Robespierre's home. The influence of his wife, or perhaps his fear for her, brought him to more moderate political views, binding him to Georges Danton and some of the Dantonist and supporters of the Cordeliers, or the Indulgents.Heron, pp. 206-207. When Danton, and his Bentabole's friend Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles, were brought to trial for their treason, he attested to the convention the patriotism of his friend. Hérault was an object of suspicion to the other members of the committee, especially to Maximilien Robespierre, who as a deist and a follower of the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, resented Hérault and other followers of Denis Diderot's naturalism. Hérault was also of an aristocratic background, another suspicious trait. Danton, Hérault and several others were tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal and condemned alongside together. Danton, Hérault, François Joseph Westermann, Camille Desmoulins, and Pierre Philippeaux were guillotined on the same day: 5 April 1794 (16th Germinal in the year II). Containing the Terror After the death of Danton and the others, Bentabole realized that he, and some of the other moderate Montigards, now had become Robespierre's targets. Over time, they had moderated their stances, whereas Robespierre and his allies had not. Initially Bentabole planned to simply assassinate Robespierre; he could get close enough to him to stab the man. When he shared this idea with one of his closest friends, though, the assassination metamorphosed into a plan. Many who conspired against Robespierre did so for strong practical and personal reasons, most notably self-preservation. Such surviving Dantonists as Merlin de Thionville wanted revenge for the death of Georges Danton; others wished to protect their own heads. Among the latter were Joseph Fouché and Pierre-Louis Bentabole. Yet, for three months, the plotters waffled: how should they do it, what was the best strategy? Ultimately, though, it was Robespierre himself who united his enemies against him. On 8 Thermidor (26 July) he gave a speech to the Convention in which he railed against enemies and conspiracies, some within the powerful committees. As he did not give the names of \\"these traitors\\", all in the Convention feared that they were his targets. Later, at the Jacobin Club, he denounced Collot and Billaud. These men then spent the night planning the following day's coup, with other members of the convention. The following day, Bentabole, Tallien and Merlin de Thionville attacked the \\"followers of Robespierre\\". Five days later, he moved that the legislation allowing the arrest, trial and execution of anyone without representatives that they are not heard by the convention, as had been the case during the removal of Dantonist. Bentabole's proposal was enthusiastically accepted by his colleagues. This completed the fall of that so-called Incorruptible on 9 Thermidor. After Thermidor Bentabole participated in the dismemberment of the revolutionary government. The 15 Vendemiaire Year III, he was appointed to the Committee of Public Safety along with other Thermidorians reactors such as Reubell, Reverchon and Laporte . Shortly after he called for the permanent closure of the Jacobin Club in Paris. On 21 December 1794, during the Thermidorian reaction, he was elected president of the convention. In October 1795 after the announcement of the results of elections against Thermidorians, he asked that the convention, which has two vacancies, elect the Executive Board on the field, without waiting for the arrival of new members. In line with the wishes of Tallien Bentabole and friends wish to cancel the results but the maneuver fails under pressure from moderates led by Thibaudeau. Bentabole still managed to be elected to the Council of Five Hundred among moderate Republicans supporters of the Revolution. Classified by the government as a Jacobin, he was not re-elected in 1798.

Early life Barr received a diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a cancer affecting the white blood cells, at age four. During the next several years, she received experimental chemotherapy treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. At age 17, Barr's cancer went into full remission. In 1985, she graduated from Morristown-Beard School in Morristown, New Jersey. Morristown-Beard School awarded Barr their Distinguished Alumni Award in 2005.\\"The Aubrey Fund for Pediatric Cancer Research began in 1997 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, named for Aubrey Adam Barr '85, who has raised nearly 20 million dollars through the coordination and sponsorship of marathons around the globe.\\" Marathon running In 1992, Barr ran in the Boston Marathon for the first time. Following the race, she gained a greater interest in the sport of marathon running, which led her to register to run in the New York City Marathon in the fall. Soon after registering, Barr received a letter from runner Fred Lebow that encouraged her to collect donations to support cancer research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Lebow, who co-founded the New York City Marathon and served as president of New York Road Runners, was receiving cancer treatment at the medical center at that time. After raising $1,500 for Memorial Sloan-Kettering in the New York City Marathon, Barr continued to collect donations for them in future races. In 1997, Memorial Sloan-Kettering named their Aubrey Fund for Pediatric Cancer Research after Barr. As of 2008, the Aubrey Fund had raised more than $25 million to support childhood cancer research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. Barr resides in Duxbury, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston, and she practices for races by running alongside the Charles River. She runs her races with Fred's Team, the marathon fundraising group for Memorial Sloan-Kettering named after Lebow. During the 2012 New York City Marathon, Barr and her teammates paid tribute to Lebow at the statute honoring him in Central Park in New York City. Public speaking on cancer In 2012, Barr gave the keynote address at an event held by CentraState Medical Center in Freehold Township, New Jersey to celebrate National Cancer Survivors Day. CentraState participates in clinical trials of cancer research for the Cancer Trials Support Unit at the National Cancer Institute. She gave the keynote address at the gala of the Next Generation Foundation in 2010. The foundation aims to increase the involvement of youth and young adults in efforts to address cancer.

Human spaceflight often requires astronaut crews to endure long periods without rest. Studies have shown that lack of sleep can cause fatigue that leads to errors while performing critical tasks. Also, individuals who are fatigued often cannot determine the degree of their impairment. Astronauts and ground crews frequently suffer from the effects of sleep deprivation and circadian rhythm disruption. Fatigue due to sleep loss, sleep shifting and work overload could cause performance errors that put space flight participants at risk of compromising mission objectives as well as the health and safety of those on board. Mission Specialist Margaret Rhea Seddon, wearing a blindfold, sleeps in SLS-1 module (STS-40) Overview Sleeping in space requires that astronauts sleep in a crew cabin, a small room about the size of a shower stall. They lie in a sleeping bag which is strapped to the wall. Astronauts have reported having nightmares, dreams, and snoring while sleeping in space.NASA - Sleeping in Space Sleeping and crew accommodations need to be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts can wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads. Brain cells are extremely sensitive to a lack of oxygen and brain cells can start dying less than 5 minutes after their oxygen supply disappears; the result is that brain hypoxia can rapidly cause severe brain damage or even death.Cerebral hypoxia A decrease of oxygen to the brain can cause dementia and brain damage, as well as a host of other symptoms.Dementia From Oxygen Deprivation In the early 21st century, crew on the ISS were said to average about six hours of sleep per day.Astronaut set to make history for longest stay in space On the ground Chronic sleep loss can impact performance similarly to total sleep loss and recent studies have shown that cognitive impairment after 17 hours of wakefulness is similar to impairment from an elevated blood alcohol level. It has been suggested that work overload and circadian desynchronization may cause performance impairment. Those who perform shift work suffer from increased fatigue because the timing of their sleep/wake schedule is out of sync with natural daylight (see Shift work syndrome). They are more prone to auto and industrial accidents as well as a decreased quality of work and productivity on the job. Ground crews at NASA are also affected by slam shifting (sleep shifting) while supporting critical International Space Station operations during overnight shifts. In space Flight engineer Nikolai Budarin, uses a computer in a sleep station in the Zvezda Service Module on the International Space Station (ISS). Cosmonaut alt=A man, dressed in blue work clothing, seen in a small cubicle. On the walls around him can be seen a sleeping bag, children's drawings, technical manuals and stained insulation. A small porthole in the centre of the wall behind him shows the nose of the Space Shuttle Atlantis and the blackness of space. During the Apollo program, it was discovered that adequate sleep in the small volumes available in the command module and Lunar Module was most easily achieved if (1) there was minimum disruption to the pre-flight circadian rhythm of the crew members; (2) all crew members in the spacecraft slept at the same time; (3) crew members were able to doff their suits before sleeping; (4) work schedules were organized – and revised as needed – to provide an undisturbed (radio quiet) 6-8 hour rest period during each 24-hour period; (5) in zero-gravity, loose restraints were provided to keep the crewmen from drifting; (6) on the lunar surface, a hammock or other form of bed was provided; (7) there was an adequate combination of cabin temperature and sleepwear for comfort; (8) the crew could dim instrument lights and either cover their eyes or exclude sunlight from the cabin; and (9) equipment such as pumps were adequately muffled. NASA management currently has limits in place to restrict the number of hours in which astronauts are to complete tasks and events. This is known as the \\"Fitness for Duty Standards\\". Space crews' current nominal number of work hours is 6.5 hours per day, and weekly work time should not exceed 48 hours. NASA defines critical workload overload for a space flight crew as 10-hour work days for 3 days per work week, or more than 60 hours per week (NASA STD-3001, Vol. 1). Astronauts have reported that periods of high-intensity workload can result in mental and physical fatigue. Studies from the medical and aviation industries have shown that increased and intense workloads combined with disturbed sleep and fatigue can lead to significant health issues and performance errors. Research suggests that astronauts' quality and quantity of sleep while in space is markedly reduced than while on Earth. The use of sleep-inducing medication could be indicative of poor sleep due to disturbances. A study in 1997 showed that sleep structure as well as the restorative component of sleep may be disrupted while in space. These disturbances could increase the occurrence of performance errors. Current space flight data shows that accuracy, response time and recall tasks are all affected by sleep loss, work overload, fatigue and circadian desynchronization. =Factors that contribute to sleep loss and fatigue= The most common factors that can affect the length and quality of sleep while in space include: * noise * physical discomfort * voids * disturbances caused by other crew members * temperature An evidence gathering effort is currently underway to evaluate the impact of these individual, physiological and environmental factors on sleep and fatigue. The effects of work-rest schedules, environmental conditions and flight rules and requirements on sleep, fatigue and performance are also being evaluated. =Factors that contribute to circadian desynchronization= Exposure to light is the largest contributor to circadian desynchronization on board the ISS. Since the ISS orbits the Earth every 1.5 hours, the flight crew experiences 16 sunrises and sunsets per day. Slam shifting (sleep shifting) is also a considerable external factor that causes circadian desynchronization in the current space flight environment. Other factors that may cause circadian desynchronization in space: * shift work * extended work hours * timeline changes * slam shifting (sleep shifting) * prolonged light of lunar day * Mars sol on Earth * Mars sol on Mars * abnormal environmental cues (i.e.: unnatural light exposure) Sleep loss, genetics, and space Both acute and chronic partial sleep loss occur frequently in space flight due to operational demands and for physiological reasons not yet entirely understood. Some astronauts are affected more than others. Earth-based research has demonstrated that sleep loss poses risks to astronaut performance, and that there are large, highly reliable individual differences in the magnitude of cognitive performance, fatigue and sleepiness, and sleep homeostatic vulnerability to acute total sleep deprivation and to chronic sleep restriction in healthy adults. The stable, trait-like (phenotypic) inter-individual differences observed in response to sleep loss point to an underlying genetic component. Indeed, data suggest that common genetic variations (polymorphisms) involved in sleep-wake, circadian, and cognitive regulation may serve as markers for prediction of inter-individual differences in sleep homeostatic and neurobehavioral vulnerability to sleep restriction in healthy adults. Identification of genetic predictors of differential vulnerability to sleep restriction will help identify astronauts most in need of fatigue countermeasures in space flight and inform medical standards for obtaining adequate sleep in space. Computer-based simulation information Biomathematical models are being developed to instantiate the biological dynamics of sleep need and circadian timing. These models could predict astronaut performance relative to fatigue and circadian desynchronization.

P. \\"Maura\\" Scannell (1924–2011) was a leading Irish botanist. Professional career Scannell became Assistant Keeper of the Natural History Division of the National Museum, Ireland, 1949. Her special interest was the botany of Ireland, especially in the past. She was an expert in the identification of woods and charcoals, leading her to identify the material used in all the Irish harps in the National Museum as well as from archaeological sites. The Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland called her \\"an inspiration to generations of botanists\\" for her taxonomic knowledge of seeds and fibres as well as microfungi and algae. In 1970, she supervised the transfer of the National Herbarium from the National Museum in central Dublin to the National Botanic Gardens at Glasnevin. She was an active member of the Irish regional committee of the (now) Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland from 1963 to 1994. She was a judge in the Irish Young Scientists Exhibition from the 1960s. One of her most important contributions was in fostering a love of botany in others. She remained Head of the National Herbarium until she retired in 1989, but continued as an author, field botanist and visitor to the Herbarium. Scientific legacy Her very wide knowledge within botany, particularly of Ireland and the Herbarium collection, is illustrated in the diversity of publications that acknowledge her contribution or advice: a follow-up to a record of Salix hibernica in Ireland in 1963 records her contribution of information from the Herbarium indicating the tree's presence in Ireland substantially earlier, in the 1880s; Identifying the species of reeds in a print of an oil painting in 1996 led to its identification as an important post-Famine Irish landscape painting; Identification of wood and charcoal fragments for archaeological excavations. Over 200 scientific publications, books and floras are attributed to her, in addition to specimens and field records deposited in the national Herbarium. The latter are among the largest contribution by any botanist. A new plant species was named after her in 2008, Sorbus scannelliana (Maura Scannell's Whitebeam).

The red sandstone slab, up to 0.1 metres thick, was buried in the ground to a depth of 0.2 metres at the entrance to the chamber. Cultural sites of other types, such as Domus de Janas, also have a clear partition between the passage and the ante-chamber or main chamber. No. 7 = the threshold stone of a passage grave Threshold stones are typical of dolmens, gallery graves and passage graves, etc. Whilst in most simple dolmens the blocking stone (Verschlussstein) of the entrance side was replaced by a threshold stone of varying height, the entrance to extended dolmens and great dolmens was narrowed axially or coaxially usually to about half the width of the chamber and the lower threshold stone marked the transition in the open doorway between the passage and the chamber. In simple dolmens with no passage and an entrance opening, the threshold reaches almost half the height of the chamber and protrudes 0.5 m above the hallway floor in Grave 9 in the northern part of the Everstorf Forest. Usually, however the upper edge of the threshold is not generally higher than 0.1 metres above the level of the hall floor in dolmens. The length of the threshold in polygonal dolmens and gallery and passage graves is also the width of the entrance which, in the Funnelbeaker culture, rarely exceeds 0.7 metres. As well as separating the sacral chamber from the profane passage, the threshold stone also serves to support a door slab or sealing slab. If the passageway was used, e.g. in connexion with secondary burials, for cultic purposes, it was given a covering of flagstones and a second, outer threshold stone.

She was known by her nickname of \\"Clarkey\\". She was admired for her independence and conversation. She eventually married the orientalist Julius von Mohl. She was an ardent Francophile, a feminist, and a close friend of Florence Nightingale. She wrote about her interest in the history of women's rights. Life Mary Elizabeth Clarke was born in Westminster in 1793.Patrick Waddington, 'Mohl, Mary Elizabeth (1793–1883)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2007 accessed 5 Feb 2015 After the death of her father, Charles Clarke, Mary, at age 8, her mother, Elizabeth, and grandmother moved to France in 1801. > Both her guardians were strong and independent-minded women. Her Scottish > grandmother had hobnobbed with thinkers like David Hume and Adam Smith in > Edinburgh and before the French Revolution lived in Dunkirk. Mary's mother > Elizabeth was a progressive free thinker. Ties with England were not lost; in 1808 Mary's sister, Eleanor, married John Frewen-Turner, a member of parliament. Mary would frequently visit their home at Cold Overton in Leicestershire. Eventually, Mary's charm became almost universally admired, and as a result she had a number of notable suitors and important contacts in both France and England. Mary was on very good terms with Madame Récamier, who was both the landlady of their sub-let accommodation at the Abbaye-aux-Bois, as well as a leader in French intellectual salon society. After the 1815 restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, > Mary Clarke came to know Juliette Recamier... Through her, she met literary > greats such as Stendhal, Hugo, Prosper Merimee and Chateaubriand. > Chateaubriand – author of Memoirs from Beyond the Grave – was by now a > grumpy old man, but he cheered up when entertained by \\"la jeune anglaise\\". In June 1822, Mary and her mother visited England and Scotland. One of her suitors, Claude Charles Fauriel, who had become a loyal friend, revealed his interest when he wrote to Mary concerning Auguste Sirey, who had been spoken of as Mary's fiancée. He was concerned as it had been proposed that Sirey would go to England with them. During her relationship with Claude Fauriel, she became acquainted with the family of the famous Italian writer and poet Alessandro Manzoni Letter from Florence Nightingale to Mohl in 1881 In 1838 she made her final move when she rented rooms above the writer and historian François-René de Chateaubriand. These were a third floor apartment at 120 Rue du Bac in the Saint-Germain district. There,\\"she offered a home-from-home\\" to William Thackeray, the Brownings, and the Trollopes, \\"as well as to many aristocrats, diplomats and politicians.\\" For nearly forty years, the Clarke and later Mohl home was an intellectual centre in Paris. About this time she was introduced to William Nightingale's family including his daughter Florence Nightingale. Florence Nightingale recorded that \\"Clarkey\\" was a stimulating hostess who did not care for her appearance and although her ideas might not always agree with her guests, \\"she was incapable of boring anyone.\\" Her behaviour was said to be exasperating and eccentric, and she was clear that she had no respect for British women who she regarded generally as inconsequential. She said that if given the choice between being a woman or a galley slave then she would choose the freedom of the galleys. She generally avoided female company and spent her time with male intellectuals like Fauriel and Mohl. However Clarkey made exceptions including George Eliot, Lady Augusta Stanley, Elizabeth Gaskell and Florence Nightingale in particular. She and Florence were to remain close friends for 40 years despite their 27-year age difference. Mohl demonstrated that women could be equals to men, an idea that Florence did not obtain from her mother. In 1847, at around 54 years old, she married the orientalist Julius von Mohl who was the son of the prime minister to the king of Württemberg.Note by Mary Mohl, National Archives, retrieved 5 February 2015 It was said that someone coughed when she gave her age at the marriage and that it was recorded as 39. The groom was about 47. Henry James described how > Madame Mohl used to drop out of an omnibus, often into a mud-puddle, at our > door, and delight us with her originality and freshness. I can see her now, > just arrived, her feet on the fender before the fire, her hair flying, and > her general untidiness so marked as to be picturesque. In 1854, Florence Nightingale set off with a team of women to assist in nursing the wounded men from the Crimean War in Scutari. Nightingale's studies had been assisted by Mary and her husband and they again assisted Nightingale when she travelled through Paris en route to the Crimea. Mary had other varying literary associations as well. A portion of Wives and Daughters was written by Elizabeth Gaskell whilst staying with Mohl. Mohl herself wrote Madame Récamier, with a Sketch of the History of Society in France, published in London in 1862. This book drew on her knowledge of Récamier, but it also outlined her interest in women and a history of their rights. She was a lifelong advocate for women and reading. In 1870–71, Mohl decided to avoid France's war with Prussia, and spent the winter with friends in London. Having retired from being a hostess, Mohl died in Paris in 1883. She was buried with her husband in Paris in the Pere Lachaise cemetery.

The Linn 9000 was plagued by chronic software bugs and a reputation for unreliability, which contributed to the eventual demise of Linn Electronics in February 1986. After they went out of business, Forat Electronics purchased all of Linn's remaining assets. Forat rewrote the Linn 9000 operating system, fixed all the bugs and added many new hardware and software features. Dubbed the Forat F9000, it was the first fully functional integrated sampling/sequencing/MIDI work station. The Forat F9000 was released in 1987 by Forat Electronics at a list price of $5,000 (fully expanded). The F9000 was manufactured and sold as a new complete unit. Forat discontinued manufacturing new complete F9000s in 1994. However, , Forat still offers the F9000 software and hardware upgrades to existing Linn 9000s. The latest version of the F9000 operating system is 7.09. Features In addition to retaining all the original features of the Linn 9000, bug free, the F9000 added many new features including: * Up to 18 custom sounds (on the Linn 9000, the maximum was 4) * Four times the sequencer memory than the Linn 9000 * Full SMPTE read/write sync (promised, but not released by Linn Electronics) * MIDI Clock * MIDI Song Position Pointer * Sample editing - sounds can be truncated, faded or reversed * Total sample time increased to 33 seconds * A larger LCD display divided into two parts for drums and sequencer * Sequencer tracks can be copied, duplicated, shifted, re-quantized and merged * Sequencer records all 32 MIDI controllers and System Exclusive data * 156 steps of drum tuning could be recorded dynamically * Tunings can be spread across all 18 pads with each pad user tunable * Battery-backed memory - sounds and sequences are retained when powered off * Drum Solo and Mute functions * Faster erasing and faster auditioning of sounds * Microscope Sequence editing with Event and Global Modes. Step through events and change MIDI note value, velocity and duration via the up/down buttons or simply play the desired note on a MIDI keyboard. Spot erase any note. This process can be done on one or all tracks simultaneously. In Global Mode, you can transpose, erase or scale velocities and duration of notes. You can also specify a range of notes on which these Global edits occur. * Drum Section Global and Event editing. Specify a range of drum tuning, velocity, and hi-hat decays to be modified. * Reassign MIDI drum notes, create a MIDI drum mix, and send MIDI automation data. * Manual or programmable record punch in/out * Under the Environment File, you can save all user set variables such as: SONG LIST, SMPTE START, and frame rates, pad dynamics, tempo, drum mix and tunings, as well as dozens of other settings.

In August 1903 the Admiralty appointed the first two Commanding Officers of the then RNVR to form divisions in London and on the Clyde. Lieutenant Commander (later Commodore) the Duke of Montrose raised the Clyde Division based in Glasgow, and the division rapidly expanded across Scotland, first to Dundee on board the sailing frigate, HMS Unicorn, and then to Edinburgh on board the monitor, renamed HMS Claverhouse. These two East Coast divisions were, many years later, to form the heart of the modern HMS Scotia. Under the 1994 defence review all three of these original Scottish Sea Training Centres, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee, were combined into two units of a different type, HMS Scotia in Fife and HMS Dalriada in Greenock. Both of these had been units formed in the cold war to support nearby naval headquarters, and both were rapidly expanded to accommodate the closing units. In the case of Scotia this required a complete rebuild, and the unit now inhabits spacious, modern accommodation with excellent facilities, close to Rosyth Royal Dockyard. The unit has excellent communication links by road, rails and air.http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/maritime- reserves/royal-naval-reserve/units/scotia An important 'first' has been the establishment of Scotia's Satellites. Although Scotia is a large and vigorous unit, it was recognised that its distance from the city centres of Edinburgh and Dundee was inhibiting recruitment at a time when the Royal Navy's demand for reservists was growing. Scotia became the testbed for a scheme to extend the RNR footprint with the first satellite unit, the Tay Division of HMS Scotia in Dundee, which started training in 1999 and rapidly established itself as the national benchmark. It was soon followed by another Scotia satellite, Forth Division, in Edinburgh. Unfortunately Forth Division in Edinburgh closed its doors in 2004. It was as a direct result of these efforts in expansion that Scotia was awarded the \\"Director's Trophy\\" in 2001. *1958 HQ Unit formed at MHQ (marine headquarters) Pitreavie *1960 Name of HMS Scotia adopted.

The use of the word originates in the internet meme, first spread by Chadskiy on VKontakte, and used in Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet states. Its meaning refers to the original cartoon, which depicts a character made from the material of a padded cotton wool jacket and bearing a black eye and is used to disparage someone as a Russian patriot who ascribes to conventional views.

The dog was a favorite of the prince, and often accompanied him on royal engagements. According to the prince, his second daughter Sirivannavari Nariratana bought the dog when it was aged about one month from Chatuchak market in Bangkok, along with some rabbits, hamsters and other dogs. He was \\"quite cute, but seemed very weak\\", and due to his daughter's young age the dog was kept in a pet shelter by palace staff. (not available anymore), Web Archive Memento dated 6 February 2015 Fufu was occasionally put through his paces in public, as happened during the Thailand Grand Pet Show in Nakhon Pathom in December 2006 when the dog was said to have \\"exuded charm and executed clever stunts\\". Fufu came to wider public attention in 2009, when he appeared in a leaked video showing the Crown Prince's third wife, Princess Srirasmi, feeding a birthday cake to the dog while only wearing a G-string. The video, which was thought to have been leaked by opponents of the Crown Prince, caused a sensation in Thailand and exposed a hidden struggle for the right to succeed the ailing Thai king Bhumibol Adulyadej. A few months later, US Ambassador Ralph L. Boyce attended a gala dinner in honor of the Crown Prince at which the dog appeared \\"dressed in formal evening attire complete with paw mitts\\". Boyce further reported that Fufu had been \\"promoted\\" to the rank of air chief marshal in the Royal Thai Air Force. According to the ambassador's cable to Washington, subsequently released by WikiLeaks, \\"at one point during the band's second number, he jumped up onto the head table and began lapping from the guests' water glasses, including my own. The air chief marshal's antics drew the full attention of the 600-plus audience members, and remains the talk of the town to this day.\\" The death of Fufu in early 2015 was followed by four days of Buddhist funeral rites and the dog's cremation, images from which were widely shared on social media in Thailand. The funeral attracted commentary from Thais as an oblique and ironic reflection of worries over the king's succession, which cannot be aired openly in Thailand due to a lèse-majesté law that attracts severe penalties.

In an instructional rounds session, a group of educators from perhaps 20 to 40 in size makes a series of visits to classrooms to observe what is taking place in the instructional core (the interactions between students and teachers in the presence of content). Low inference observation notes are taken about a learning problem identified by the school being observed. The observation notes are used to create a picture of what has been seen in teaching and learning practices throughout the school. It is these practices that are shared with the school, not information about individual teachers or students. Adapted from the practice of grand rounds in medical school, the aim of instructional rounds is to observe teaching and learning to discern root causes for problems identified by the school and to help the school and district create more productive outcomes. Distinct from supervision and evaluation, rounds are used to describe what is happening in classrooms and the share observations with educators, and are not intended to be evaluative.  Origin  The process of instructional rounds was adapted from medical rounds model that is used in schools of medicine and teaching hospitals to improve practice of prospective and current doctors in diagnosing and curing patients. Physicians use medical rounds as a major way of improving their theory and practice. \\"In the most commonly used version of medical rounds, a group of medical interns, residents, and supervising or attending physicians visit patients, observe and discuss the evidence for diagnoses, and, after a thorough analysis of evidence, discuss possible treatments.\\"  Description of common practice  Instructional rounds include several steps: formation of a network that ideally includes representative members from all those who impact student learning; choosing a problem to be addressed; classroom observation; observation debrief ; detection of the next steps, and regular repetition of this process. = Network formation = Network formation involves the gathering of educators who will regularly meet with each other to do rounds. There are not specific criteria sets for the creation of networks, it depends on the situation, time and preferences of educators. Different kinds of networks could be used to do rounds. Some of them are cross-functional in which teachers and administrators work together, while others are homogeneous in nature composed of superintendents or teachers exclusively. Instructional rounds could be integrated into existing networks or specially formed new networks of educators. Sometimes members of the network are selected intentionally, according to the subject, content they teach or problem area they share. Other networks are more pragmatic, for instance, teachers with the same planning time engage in rounds together. = Choosing problem of practice = The problem of practice is a specific issue that the school needs constructive feedback on, worries about or struggles against. The problem should be observable and focused on improving teaching. It is unsolved problem that the school has spent time and money to address, but it is in further need of assistance. There are different ways of identifying problems of practice. The best way is to relate these problems to continuous school improvement and to proceed based on data. To determine the problem of practice sometimes the entire staff gathers or only the leadership team meets to identify a problem. An example of a problem of practice could be the following: \\"In reading and writing, our students seem to be doing relatively well on decoding, vocabulary, and simple writing tasks, but they are not doing as well as we had hoped on comprehension free-response tasks. Teachers have begun using a workshop method to work with smaller groups of students, but there is no consistency in what happens in those small groups\\". = Classroom observation = After determining the problem of practice, the network splits into smaller groups of 4-5 teachers that visit approximately 4-5 classrooms for 25 minutes each. Observers collect descriptive data rather than evaluative, meaning that they do not have any rubrics to guide them. Observers do have guiding questions associated with the problem they are investigating. For instance, 'What are students and teachers doing and saying?,' 'What is the assignment?,' 'What do students do when they do not understand the concept or instruction?'. Observers do not look at every issue in the classroom, but only those connected with the problem of practice. For instance, if the issue is lack of higher order thinking skills among students, observers do not pay attention on behavior and attendance of students, their involvement in the task, or teacher behavior, such as writing objectives on the board. Observers attempt to find the cause of the existing problem of practice in school and then identify a viable cure for it. It is very important that observers do not talk between class observations and save everything they saw, their descriptive feedback, for the official debrief. = Observation debrief = The process of debrief consists of three steps: description, analysis, and prediction. During the description stage, all groups of the network meet together and share their evidence that pertains to the problem of practice with the others. The evidence should be specific and descriptive rather than evaluative and general. Regular practice and peer help could facilitate learning to collect specific and descriptive evidence. Having gathered a set of evidence, the network can begin analyzing it by looking at trends, patterns, and exceptions across the data. Examples of patterns could be: Students are divided into groups, but work individually; teacher asks simple questions that requires short 1-2 words answers. Each groups of teachers share trends and patterns that have seen. This could help educators to determine common patterns in subject area, grade level and across school. However, sometimes patterns could vary in each subject or grade level. At the prediction stage observers answer to the following question, “If you were a student in these classes today and you did everything the teacher asked you to do, what would you know and be able to do?” This question is asked to see what students could learn as a result of the completed assignments and tasks in the class. The responses of the observers could be: Learners will be able to solve mathematical problems, recall information, etc. = Detection of the next steps = There are different ways of detecting next steps of work. Some networks brainstorm action plans for the following week, next month or by the end of educational year. Other networks creates reflective questions to reflect  References  Category:Observation Category:Teacher training ","title":"Instructional rounds"},{"id":"45316274","text":"Wangenheimia is a genus of plants in the grass family.Moench, Conrad. 1794.

The framework was founded by Dr. Dana L. Carmichael, Dr. M. Bruce King, and Dr. Fred M. Newmann. The purpose of the framework is to promote student production of genuine and rigorous work that resembles the complex work of adults. Consequently, the framework identifies three main criteria for student learning (construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and value beyond school), and provides standards accompanied by scaled rubrics for classroom instruction, assignments, and student work. The standards and rubrics are meant to support teachers in the promotion of genuine and rigorous work, as well as guide professional development and collaboration. Authentic Intellectual work (Background) Authentic intellectual work refers to the complex work adults do to make informed decisions and accomplish tasks. It involves original application of knowledge and skills, rather than simply routine use of facts and procedures. Therefore, for students, authentic intellectual work results in a product or presentation that has meaning or value beyond the classroom. For many students, the work they perform in schools entails memorization of facts and algorithms, and can fail to relate to the work they will need to do as an adult. The disconnect between the material studied at school and the skills needed to perform well in one’s work, personal, or civic life can make school work seem meaningless or worthless. Learning tasks call for specific memorized information, retrieval of given information, or application of routine computational procedures, but rarely do they call for higher-level thinking, interpretation, or in-depth conceptual understanding. Schoolwork is regarded largely as a series of contrived exercises necessary to earn credentials (grades, promotions) required for future success, but for many, especially poor students of color, this work leads to disengagement and dropping out. However, most jobs, personal matters and civic actions require problem-solving skills, in-depth understanding of problems and specific skills, and the ability to communicate in a variety of forms.  The Framework  The framework aims to prepare students for the intellectual challenges of work, civic participation, and life by maximizing expectations for intellectual rigor for all students, encouraging in-depth understanding of content, and increasing student interest in academic work. This is made evident through its three main criteria for student learning: construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and value beyond school. The construction of knowledge refers to solving problems by organizing, interpreting, evaluating or synthesizing prior knowledge. Disciplined inquiry involves gathering a knowledge base of relevant vocabulary, facts, concepts, algorithms, theories, and basic skills, gaining developing a deeper understanding by identifying, proposing, and testing relationships among key fact, events, concepts, rules, and claims. Finally, value beyond school acknowledges the necessity for students to present their knowledge in a variety of complex forms of communication to resemble real life work. To meet this criteria students use verbal, symbolic, graphic, and visual tools to explain, narrate, justify, and converse about a topic. The more each of these criteria, construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and value beyond school, are met, the more “authentic” the work of the student.  Summary of Research  From 1990-2003 researchers completed studies at Wisconsin Center for Education Research at the University of Wisconsin- Madison, the University of Minnesota, and the Consortium on Chicago School Research. The scoring rubrics described above were used to assess the quality of student work in (list demographics). Students who received higher levels of instruction and assessment showed higher achievement, both on direct assessments of authentic intellectual performance and on traditional standardized tests. Results were positive and consistent in grades 3-12 across different subject areas regardless of students’ race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Their research was performed in response to their belief in a lack of rigor and relevance in educational reforms that encouraged the teaching of basic skills and ability to recall knowledge. Researchers believed low expectations existed for intellectual challenge, especially for students from typically disadvantaged backgrounds, along with a lack of student engagement, and an emphasis on breadth of knowledge rather than mastery. Researchers argued that since cognitively integrated knowledge is more likely to be internalized and retained by students, it is more likely to be remembered and correctly applied on standardized tests than knowledge memorized as discrete items only for the purpose of repeating it when called upon. (27) Since demands for authentic intellectual work pose questions of interest to students in their lives beyond school, students are more likely to care about both the questions they study and the answers they learn. Thus, such assignments enhance a student’s willingness to put forth serious effort in learning the material, as compared to exercises that have no personal meaning beyond completing an assignment to please the teacher or to attain a promotion. In sum, assignments that demand more authentic intellectual work elicit intensive thinking about and a deeper engagement in varied applications of words, concepts, and ideas. This can help students to internalize understandings as their own, and to use this knowledge to respond to items on conventional tests that may not have been explicitly covered in class. Standards for Scoring Rubrics The framework provides standards for classroom instruction, assignments, and student work based on the three criteria for authentic intellectual work (construction of knowledge, disciplined inquiry, and value beyond school). Each standard is accompanied by a scoring rubric for evaluating a teacher’s promotion of authentic intellectual work for their students in the classroom. Standardized rubrics provide teachers with a common language and vision for learning, can help teachers reflect on the practice, and become useful tools for professional development and collaboration. While the rubrics are meant to guide instruction to help teachers improve the authentic intellectual quality of student learning, they are not meant to be used as a comprehensive evaluative tool. They do not concern other aspects of teaching that may be valuable to schools. =Standards for Instruction= * Standard 1: Higher order thinking (HOT) Students are required students to manipulate information and ideas in ways that transform their meaning and implication. This occurs when students combine facts and ideas in order to synthesize, generalize, explain, hypothesize, or arrive at some conclusion or interpretation. * Standard 2: Deep knowledge Knowledge is deep when, instead of trying to learn or expressing only fragmented pieces of information, students encounter and express details, distinctions, nuances, and different applications of central concepts aimed toward integrated or holistic understandings. * Standard 3: Substantive Conversation Students engage in extended conversational exchanges with the teacher and/or their peers about subject matter in a way that builds an improved and shared understanding of ideas or topics. Substantive conversation has three features: # talk is about subject matter in the discipline and includes higher order thinking; # the conversation includes sharing ideas and is not completely scripted or controlled by one party (as in teacher-led recitation); # the dialogue builds coherently on participants’ ideas to promote improved collective understanding of a theme or topic. This is called a sustained conversation. Newman, Carmichael, and King (2007) identify a \\"sustained conversation\\" as having at least three consecutive interchanges between participants. The interchanges need not be between the same two people, but they must be linked substantively as consecutive responses. * Standard 4: Connections to the world beyond the classroom Students make connections between substantive knowledge and public problems or personal experiences they are likely to have faced or will face in the future. According to Newmann, Carmichael, and King (2007) lessons can have value for students school success by: # addressing an actual public problem of some contemporary significance # building on students’ personal experiences to teach important ideas in the disciplines # having students communicate their knowledge to others beyond the classroom in ways that assist or influence others. =Standards for Assignments= * Standard 1: Construction of Knowledge The assignment asks students to organize and interpret information in addressing a concept, problem, or issue relevant to the discipline. * Standard 2: Elaborated Written Communication The assignment asks students to elaborate on their understanding, explanations, or conclusions through extended writing in the relevant discipline. * Standard 3: Connection to Students’ Lives The assignment asks students to address a concept, problem, or issue in the relevant discipline that is similar to one that they have encountered or are likely to encounter in their daily lives outside of school. =Standards for Evaluating Student Work= It is not as possible to tell whether student performance will have value beyond school. Therefore, the rubrics and standards for student work only reflect the first two criteria, construction of knowledge and disciplined inquiry. * Standard 1: Construction of Knowledge (Analysis) Student performance demonstrates thinking about disciplinary content through organizing, synthesizing, interpreting, hypothesizing, describing patterns, making models or simulations, constructing arguments, or considering alternative points of view. * Standard 2: Disciplinary Concepts Student performance demonstrates understanding of important disciplinary concepts central to the assignment. * Standard 3: Elaborated Written Communication (discipline specific) Student performance demonstrates an elaboration of his or her understanding or explanations of disciplinary concepts through extended writing. * Standard 4: Elaborated Written Communication (writing) Student performance demonstrates an elaborated, coherent account that draws conclusions or makes generalizations or arguments and supports them with examples, summaries, illustrations, details, or reasons. The challenges of Implementing AIW According to a study performed by Dr. Liz Winstien for the Iowa Department of Education on the initial findings of the implementation of AIW in Iowa school districts, a major challenge for using the framework is the amount of time it requires for teacher training on the rubrics and foundational principles of the framework. Also, the framework is meant to be a collaborative tool that teachers use to give and receive feedback on their instruction and student work. This can be an uncomfortable experience for some teachers. It may take time for teachers to become accustomed to sustaining a focused dialogue that critiques teacher instruction and student work. The study also noted that the framework may be more useful in certain academic disciples. For example, an Iowa Math teacher commented that math students have many fundamental skills to learn first, and incorporating elaborated conversation is less natural for the math-learning environment. An Art teacher had similar feelings. Additionally, administrators mentioned AIW doesn’t have a substantial amount of research behind it that supports its positive effects on students learning, which makes it more challenging to convince schools boards to fund its implementation. Finally, administrators also commented on the challenge they face keeping teachers motivated to continue having worthwhile dialogue centered around the rubrics once they become accustomed to the framework and the feedback sessions become routine.

Billboard gave a very mixed review of WABD's daytime schedule, though the November 10, 1948, edition of Variety commented that the schedule was no more monotonous than \\"the steady diet of disk jockeys and/or soap operas fed daytime radio listeners\\". DuMont expected that the shows would be viewed by housewives who were too busy to watch complex shows (as noted in the 2004 book The Forgotten Network by David Weinstein). Despite the mixed reviews, the schedule proved successful enough that other New York City stations began to increase their daytime offerings in response.

Barker was born in North Melbourne on 15 October 1911. His father, Syd Barker Sr., was then playing for the North Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football Association and would go on to captain-coach the club in the VFL. A follower, Barker was described as being sturdily built like his father, who died in March 1930. It was that year that Barker Junior joined the club and he made his debut in round 12, against St Kilda. He played in all of North Melbourne's remaining games that season and appeared in all 18 rounds of the 1931 VFL season. It wasn't until 1932 that he featured in a win, with North Melbourne having lost all 26 of his prior games. This is the longest streak of losses before a first win for any player who hasn't played for St Kilda or University. He played six games that year and another 10 in 1933, then was omitted from the North Melbourne list. He sought a clearance to Essendon in 1934, for which he required a residential clearance from South Melbourne, as he lived in Middle Park. The clearance was granted by South Melbourne and he joined Essendon in June, but he would not get to appear in league football for his new club.

Dosier's brick-making method consists of filling a rectangular form with sand layered intermittently with a solution containing urea, calcium chloride, and the non-pathogenic bacteria Sporosarcina pasteurii. After several days, the bacteria create a chemical chain reaction producing a mineral that binds the sand together into a brick. Because this process does not involve firing the brick in a kiln as in conventional brick-making, Dosier estimates that her method could reduce carbon emissions by 800 million tons each year. Dosier is the winner of the 2010 Metropolis Next Generation Design Competition. She is the CEO of bioMASON, a biotechnology start-up grown from her Better Brick project.

When he was young, his family moved to the Broadwood family home: Lyne House in Capel, Surrey. In 1825, he married Charlotte King of Loxwood, Sussex. He was a clergyman, and officiated at a wedding in 1850. In the 1851 Census of Horsham he is living at Wiggonholt and is described as the \\"Curate of Wiggonholt\\". He died at Lyne House in 1864. He is known for the book or pamphlet dated 1843, originally published anonymously, usually known as Old English Songs. It contains 16 folk songs, \\"set to music exactly as they are now sung\\", and with the words \\"given in their original rough state with an occasional slight alteration to render the sense intelligible\\". His niece, the noted song collector Lucy Broadwood, said that Old English Songs \\"is the first serious collection of English traditional songs that we possess\\"; and related that he insisted to G.

History  Among contemporary masters of the art, there are a number of competing ideas as to the origins of grima. Although there are numerous variants on these, they fall into four groups. The first group views grima as having come from Africa along with enslaved Africans brought to work in the mines of Colombia and the second group traces grima directly to European sword-fighting experts who visited Colombia in colonial times. The third group see grima's \\"desgonses\\" as evidence that Colombian grima was formed by blacks developing their own styles inspired by the European sword- fighting they witnessed, while the fourth group traces grima to the Wars of Independence when it was taught by foreign soldiers to Colombian troops. In the near future comparative research on the fencing histories of the Atlantic world may provide clearer details on the historical relationship between Colombian grima styles and other fencing traditions in the wider Atlantic world.  Styles  There are many different variations of Colombian Grima and they differ through out the country. These different styles are called \\"juegos\\". Juegos differ in utilization and movements. =Juegos= # Español Reformado was played at long ranges with long erect stances and linear footwork. # Palo Negro was practiced at close range and trained in circular walking patterns. # Relancino was similar to Palo Negro but emphasized deceptive attacking combinations and the defensive utilization of low- crouching positions and double handed blocks. # Other examples include; Sombra Caucana, Cubano, Español, Venezolano, Costeño and many others.

In 2005, he moved to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to become the Peter C. Doherty Endowed Chair of the Department of Immunology. Research After many studies on immunological tolerance, Green's work on cell death began with his discovery of activation-induced apoptosis in T lymphocytes, the role of c-Myc in this process and the finding that Bcl-2 cooperates with Myc in oncogenesis by blocking apoptosis. More recently, he discovered the process of LC3-associated phagocytosis, which links the autophagy pathway to phagosome maturation. Other areas of interest include regulated necrosis, metabolic reprogramming in T lymphocytes, and the function of the tumor suppressor, p53.

Its official name was Kutno Reserve Group of Commander-in-Chief (Grupa Odwodow Naczelnego Wodza „Kutno”, GO „Kutno”), and it remained under direct control of Commander-in- chief of the Polish Army, Marshal Edward Smigly-Rydz. According to Plan West (March 1939), the Kutno Reserve Group, consisting of three infantry divisions, was to be concentrated in the area of Kutno (22nd Mountain Infantry Division), Wloclawek (13th Infantry Division), and Plock (19th Infantry Division). As Colonel Jozef Jaklicz of Polish Army headquarters specified, the group was tasked with the following: * defence of the Vistula river line, between Pomorze Army and Modlin Army, * protection of flanks of Poznan Army or Pomorze Army. In accordance with Mobilization Plan W, the 13th and 19th Divisions were marked with red (alarm mobilization), and 22nd Division was planned to join these units in first phase of general mobilization. In the summer 1939, Polish Army headquarters made some changes to Plan West. 13th and 19th Divisions were transferred to Prusy Army, and 22nd Division to Lodz Army. After these changes, Kutno Reserve Group of Commander-in-Chief consisted of 5th Infantry Division (from Army Pomorze) and 24th Infantry Division, from Army Lodz. As a result, the group was reduced from three to two infantry divisions In the evening of August 27, 1939, some regiments of the 5th Infantry Division were mobilized. By Sunday, September 3, the regiments arrived at the Kutno rail station, and on the next day they reached Wloclawek, where they were incorporated into Pomorze Army, as the so-called Detachment of Colonel Sadowski (Oddzial Wydzielony podpulkownika Sadowskiego). These regiments were the only units of the projected Kutno Operational Group, which reached the concentration area. Due to worsening situation of the Polish Army, which was forced into a general retreat, on September 3 Polish Commander in Chief, Marshal Edward Smigly-Rydz abandoned the idea of creation of the Kutno Group. On that day, 24th Infantry Division was transferred to Karpaty Army, and on September 4, the 5th I.D. was transferred to Modlin Army.

Cooke gained notoriety in the first year of the war as a junior officer when he was entrusted with the surrender negotiations of the French port city of Toulon. Cooke's success under threat of execution led to the British occupation of the city and the ensuing Siege of Toulon. Cooke was promoted for the successful negotiations and given command of the large captured French frigate HMS Sybille in the Indian Ocean. In 1798 he led a successful bloodless raid on the port of Manila in the Spanish Philippines. In the following year Cooke tracked down and engaged the powerful French raiding frigate Forte off the mouth of the Hooghly River at the Action of 28 February 1799. In the ensuing battle, Forte was captured but Cooke was struck by grape shot. He would die in Calcutta on 25 May and was interred with full military honours. Life Cooke was born in April 1772 to Colonel George and Penelope Cooke of Harefield, Middlesex. His brothers George Cooke and Henry Frederick Cooke were both later prominent army officers, as was his stepfather Edward Smith. He joined the Royal Navy at a young age and in 1790 was promoted to lieutenant, joining HMS Victory in 1793 for Mediterranean service under Lord Hood during the French Revolutionary Wars. In August 1793, Hood was approached by representatives of the French Royalist faction offering to surrender the powerful naval port city of Toulon in exchange for protection. Cooke was already familiar with the port and was selected as the British delegation to the authorities, entering the port surreptitiously as the approaches were patrolled by Republican supporters from the fleet at anchor. Cooke came under fire during his entry to the port and was under threat of execution, but successfully negotiated the complete surrender of the city and fleet to Lord Hood.Cooke, Edward, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton and Nicholas Tracy, (subscription required), Retrieved 25 May 2015 Cooke then served as an aide to Sir George Keith Elphinstone, who was appointed governor during the ensuing Siege of Toulon, and escaped in December when the city was evacuated ahead of the advancing Republican armies. For his services, Cooke was promoted to post captain, participating at the Siege of Calvi under the command of Captain Horatio Nelson. In 1794 Cooke was given command of the 40-gun frigate HMS Sybille, recently captured from the French at the Battle of Mykonos. He took Sybille to the Cape of Good Hope and then eastward into the Indian Ocean as a convoy escort under the command of Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier. In 1798, accompanied by HMS Fox, Sybille entered the port of Manila in the Spanish Philippines disguised as a French ship and convinced the defenders to come alongside peacefully, thus seizing three gunboats and 200 prisoners of war, who were later released after being questioned. The Raid on Manila secured a considerable amount of valuable information. In early 1799, Sybille was sent from Madras to search for the large and powerful French frigate Forte, which had been raiding British merchant shipping off the mouth of the Hooghly River, the passage to Calcutta. On 28 February near Balasore, Cooke sighted lights in the distance and sailed to investigate, discovering Forte and two recently captured merchant ships. Attacking at once and in the darkness, Cooke successfully surprised the unprepared French frigate, inflicting severe damage in the initial broadsides. At the height of the battle, Cooke was struck by grape shot from Forte and carried below, wounded in the chest, arms and spine. His deputy Lieutenant Lucius Hardyman assumed command and saw the defeat of Forte, which was later brought into Calcutta as a prize. The wounded Cooke was landed at the port and given medical treatment, but his wounds were too severe and he died after an agonizing three months on 25 May. He was buried with full military honors in the city under a monument provided in thanks by the East India Company.

Paweł Cyms Cyms was born on March 2, 1894 in the village of Pawłowo, which at that time was part of Province of Posen, German Empire. He was raised in a middle-class family. While attending a high school in Gniezno (Gnesen), he joined a secret Polish patriotic organization “Association of Tomasz Zan”. After graduation in 1914, he entered a seminary in Poznań (Posen), but did not complete his studies, as in 1915 he was drafted into the German Army. Cyms fought both on Western and Eastern fronts of WW1, also completing a cadet school at Biederitz. In 1917, he was promoted to the rank of Second lieutenant. After returning to Provinz Posen, he joined Polish Military Organisation’s local office in Gniezno. He actively participated in the Greater Poland Uprising: with his unit, Cyms first liberated Gniezno, then other local towns, such as Trzemeszno, Mogilno, Strzelno and Kruszwica. Due to his skills, Polish rebels captured key rail junction of Inowrocław (Hohensalza), where Cyms created two infantry battalions, which were later named 1st and 2nd Regiments of Kujawy Grenadiers. His two brothers also fought in the insurrection. Adolf Cyms was killed in battle in 1919, while chaplain Leon Cyms survived and died in 1931. In 1920, Paweł Cyms was promoted to Captain, and in early 1921, he was transferred to Upper Silesia, where he took over the post of military commandant of the area of Zabrze (Hindenburg O/S). He fought in the Third Silesian Uprising: his soldiers captured Bierawa and participated in the Battle of Annaberg. After the uprising, Cyms briefly studied law, but in 1923 took the job at a Free City of Danzig’s branch of Warsaw’s Bank Handlowy. In 1928, he returned to military service, and was attached to 59th Greater Poland Infantry Regiment at Inowroclaw. In 1934, Cyms was transferred to the Second Department of Polish General Staff in Warsaw. Before this, in 1931, he married Maria née Krawczak (they had a daughter Barbara and a son, Janusz). During the 1939 Invasion of Poland, Cyms was an officer of 80th Infantry Regiment. Transferred to 179th Infantry Regiment (50th Reserve Infantry Division), he fought in the Battle of Kock. Captured by the Germans, Cyms was sent to a POW camp at Radom. Released in late 1939, he was rearrested in 1940, and sent to a prison in Bielsko-Biała. He spent there 4 months, after which he lived in Krosno and Kalwaria Zebrzydowska (since May 1941). Cyms was an active soldier of the Home Army. After the war, Cyms moved back to Gniezno. In 1948 he moved to Szczecin, where he worked at a shipping company “Polska Bandera”. Cyms died on November 13, 1949, at Bystra near Bielsko-Biała. On December 21, 2013, his body was exhumed and moved with honors first to Inowrocław, and then to Gniezno (December 27). During a special service, attended by crowds of local residents and authorities, the coffin of Paweł Cyms was placed in a tomb located at the so-called “Acropolis of Heroes”, at Gniezno’s Peter and Paul Cemetery.

It had reached Woodsfield by 1880. By 1884, it had reached Zanesville, Ohio, leasing the Muskingum County Railway from the county for the westernmost nine miles of track. At about the same time, the name became Bellaire, Zanesville and Cincinnati Railroad.

He fought in World War I, Polish–Soviet War, Polish–Ukrainian War and the Invasion of Poland. Jaklicz was born on 17 September 1894 in Kraków. After graduation from high school, he studied philosophy at the Jagiellonian University, and was active member of the Polish Sokol movement. In August 1914, Jaklicz joined 3rd Infantry Regiment of the Polish Legions. Promoted to the rank of company commander, he fought in Eastern Carpathians, Bessarabia and Volhynia. Following the creation of the Polish Auxiliary Corps, Jaklicz became a staff officer, and after its dissolution, he joined Polska Siła Zbrojna (Polnische Wehrmacht). In late 1918, Jaklicz entered the Polish Army, and was named commandant of a battalion of the 36th Academic Legion Infantry Regiment, which fought in the Battle of Lemberg (1918). After serving briefly under Colonel Władysław Sikorski, in March 1919, he was transferred to the staff of 9th Infantry Division, where he remained until December 1919.

Biography He displayed artistic talent at an early age, taking his first lessons in Feltre from a local artist named Giovanni D'Antonio and helping to decorate the Villa Franzoia in Quero. His work there impressed the Canon, Alvise Franzoia, who took him to Treviso and presented him to Bishop who offered to take him under his protection and helped him to continue his studies.Brief biography @ the Enciclopedia Treccani. His first major work was a portrait of the Bishop, which brought requests for more portraits by other prelates in the area and launched him on a career as a portrait painter. He also did a painting of Saint Lorenzo Giustiniani for the chapel of the Treviso Seminary, a Saint Joseph for the parish of Rasai in Seren del Grappa and a Saint Spyridon for the parish of Coste in Maser. In 1772, he was commissioned by the Dominicans at the church of Saint Nicholas to do several portraits, restore others, and create a gallery in the chapter house, which was destroyed during a bombing raid in 1944. Three years later, at the invitation of Bishop Giustiniani and his brother, Castelli moved to Padua, where he became a private portrait painter. In 1782, after establishing his reputation, he went to Venice and joined the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia. His sitters there included the Doges Paolo Renier and Ludovico Manin as well as Popes Pius VI and Pius VII. Ten years later, he relocated to Bologna and became a member of the \\"Accademia Clementina\\" (now the Accademia di Belle Arti di Bologna). He also worked briefly in Ferrara. Later, he turned down an invitation by Antonio Canova to come to Rome, and returned to Venice. Despite his fame as a portraitist, he never abandoned religious themes and was known as the \\"painter of beautiful Madonnas\\". One of his last works was a depiction of Susanna and the Elders, painted as part of a competition organized by , a tobacco merchant who was also a patron of the arts. A canvas of Saint Gerolamo collecting money for orphans was left unfinished and completed by Liberale Cozza.

They are partly an attempt to reconcile the different te reo Māori and English language versions of the Treaty, and allow the application of the Treaty to a contemporary context. The principles of the Treaty are often mentioned in contemporary New Zealand politics. Need for Treaty principles The Treaty is not regarded as law because \\"the English and Māori versions are not exactly the same\\", and \\"it focuses on the issues relevant at the time it was signed.\\" As well as this, New Zealand law affirms the common law doctrine that \\"any rights purporting to be conferred by a treaty of cession cannot be enforced in the courts, except in so far as they have been incorporated in the municipal law\\". However, the Treaty of Waitangi is still a pivotal document, and should be used in legislation and health approaches to achieve a more equitable nation, and reverse the effects of colonisation upon the arrival of the European settlers in 1840. Origins of the principles The principles originate from the famous case brought in the High Court by the New Zealand Māori Council (New Zealand Maori Council v Attorney-GeneralNew Zealand Māori Council v. Attorney-General [1987] 1 NZLR 641.) in 1987. There was great concern at that time about the ongoing restructuring of the New Zealand economy by the then Fourth Labour Government, specifically the transfer of assets from former Government departments to State-owned enterprises. Because the state-owned enterprises were essentially private firms owned by the government, there was an argument that they would prevent assets which had been given by Māori for use by the state from being returned to Māori by the Waitangi Tribunal and through Treaty settlements. The Māori Council sought enforcement of section 9 of the State Owned Enterprises Act 1986 which reads: \\"Nothing in this Act shall permit the Crown to act in a manner that is inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi\\". The Court of Appeal, in a judgement of its then President Sir Robin Cooke, decided upon the following Treaty principles: *The acquisition of sovereignty in exchange for the protection of rangatiratanga. *The Treaty established a partnership, and imposes on the partners the duty to act reasonably and in good faith. *The freedom of the Crown to govern. *The Crown's duty of active protection. *The duty of the Crown to remedy past breaches. *Māori to retain rangatiratanga over their resources and taonga and to have all the privileges of citizenship. *Duty to consult. Fourth Labour Government's principles In 1989, the Fourth Labour Government adopted the \\"Principles for Crown Action on the Treaty of Waitangi\\". Therese Crocker has argued that Labour's publication of the principles \\"comprised one of a number of Crown responses to what is generally known as the 'Maori Renaissance'.\\"Crocker, Therese, \\"Introduction\\" in Principles of the Treaty for Crown Action, p 5 Prime Minister David Lange, in an introduction to the document said of the principles that: The principles in the 1989 publication are as follow: This principle describes the balance between articles 1 and 2: the exchange of sovereignty by the Māori people for the protection of the Crown. It was emphasised in the context of this principle that \\"the Government has the right to govern and make laws\\".Principles of the Treaty for Crown Action, p 7 The Government also recognised the Court of Appeal's description of active protection, but identified the key concept of this principle as a right for iwi to organise as iwi and, under the law, to control the resources they own. The Principles in legislation The Treaty of Waitangi principles have impacted and enacted various legislation in particular issues in regards to property or land and many other social, legal and political aspects that affected one or more of the principles. The principles therefore have strong influence on not only the decision making of governments but also on laws.Mark Hickford, 'Law of the foreshore and seabed', Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/law-of-the-foreshore-and-seabed (accessed 28 May 2018) The following legislation were established due to a significant amount of influence by the Treaty of Waitangi principles and are only a few of many applications of principles within laws: Fisheries Act 1983 Environment Act 1986 State Owned Enterprises Act 1986 Conservation Act 1987 Resource Management Act 1991 Crown Minerals Act 1991 Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 Opposition to the principles =Principles Deletion Bill, 2005= The \\"Principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Deletion Bill\\" was introduced to the New Zealand Parliament in 2005 as a private member's bill by New Zealand First MP Doug Woolerton. \\"This bill eliminates all references to the expressions \\"the principles of the Treaty\\", \\"the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi\\" and the \\"Treaty of Waitangi and its principles\\" from all New Zealand Statutes including all preambles, interpretations, schedules, regulations and other provisos included in or arising from each and every such Statute\\". At the first reading of the Bill, New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said: The bill failed to pass its second reading in November 2007. In a legal analysis of the bill for Chapman Tripp, David Cochrane argued that without the principles it would probably be an \\"impossible task\\" for the Waitangi Tribunal to carry out its role.

The Logan Daily News. 7 April 1973: pg. 8. History =Bud and Betty Schwartz= Walter L. “Bud” Schwartz was born on May 31, 1906 in Warren County, Ohio. Elizabeth Anita “Betty” Smith was born on April 8, 1907 in Nelsonville. On July 22, 1930, they married at Buckeye Lake, Ohio. Betty loved growing up in Nelsonville, however, she moved after graduating from Nelsonville High School to attend nursing school at Grant Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Walter took night school classes in electronic servicing at RETS College in Centerville, Ohio. Later in life, they lived in what is now German Village of Columbus. Betty worked as the head of the cosmetics department at the downtown Lazarus store and Walter ran a drugstore with an electronic store and service shop in the back. Betty died on January 25, 1972, near Columbus at the age of 66. Bud was heartbroken and visited Nelsonville often to help himself with the mourning process. Every Sunday, he visited the First Presbyterian Church, which Betty attended while growing up there, and drove by her childhood home on Myers Street. Bud, the church’s pastor, Rev. John Lloyd Evans, and his wife decided to build a cross overlooking the city in honor of Betty and as a tribute to God. Bud died on Oct. 30, 1989 in Columbus. He was buried next to his wife, Betty, in Greenlawn Cemetery in Nelsonville. =The Cross= Land was secured from the Nelsonville Lumber Company. On Sunday, April 8, 1973, the cross was erected and dedicated on the highest point in the city, the Millet, also known as Kontner Hill. A plaque at the bottom of the monument reads: My Thanks This “Nelsonville Cross Park,” a Memorial to my dear beloved and wonderful wife “Betty,” has become a reality because of the wisdom and untiring efforts of the Rev. John Lloyd Evans, Pastor of the First Presbyterian Church. The land for this nondenominational inspirational park was donated by Mrs. Emily Sharp Hennessey, in memory of her father and mother, Mr. And Mrs. Edward B. Sharp, who beautified this hillside with lovely pines. Distinguished recognition of appreciation is due: the Nelsonville Area Improvement Committee; the City of Nelsonville; the York Township; the Athens County Engineer’s Office; the Electric Company; Mr. Eugene Edwards; Mr. William M. Watkins; Mr. Harold Bean; Councilman Mr. Reginald Levering, for his time and labor in cutting down hundreds of trees, thus clearing a path for the road to this park. My thanks to everyone, and to you who come to glory in the “Cross.” Walter L. Schwartz Donor of the “Cross” A smaller plaque reads: Nelsonville Cross A Tribute to God A Memorial to Betty The cross was designed by Columbus architect Fred Wright. It sits on a shaft that is covered with four highly polished “Rock of Ages” granite panels that rises it 8 1/2 ft. above the ground, making total height of the original monument 73 1/2 ft. It has an underground steel- reinforced 64-ton concrete base that is 16 sq. ft. and 3 ft. deep. The visible part of the monument was made of 1,555 sq. ft. of material. The cross was made with a steel girder and covered with painted aluminum. It was the world’s largest cross at the time. The cost of construction was $17,500 (equivalent to over $93,300 in 2014 dollars). Bud deeded the land to the church that helped start the project as a trustee relationship with the other Christian churches in the city. =Beautiful Nelsonville Cross= The following year, Bud wrote and published a song called “Beautiful Nelsonville Cross.” Luella Shew and Virginia Watters composed the arrangement. Available at the Nelsonville TV Cable Co. office and local music stores, it cost $1 per copy at the time and proceeds went to the Nelsonville Cross fund. =Repairs and Improvements= Schwartz planned to use the fund to not only maintain the cross, but to also establish a quiet park sanctuary. By 1974, a partial roadway was constructed for visitors. Nelsonville native Emily Sharp Hennessy of Columbus donated 15,000 sq. ft. of land to enlarge the park area and allow for the construction of the access road. The Nelsonville Area Improvement Committee improved the area in 1977 by updating the road, placing sod and shrubbery around the cross, and adding a plastic-coated fence around the park. In 1975, there were a few brush fires near the cross, but they did not cause any damage.“Nelsonville News”. The Logan Daily News. 7 April 1975: pg. 6.“Nelsonville News”. The Logan Daily News. 24 October 1975: pg. 16. However, in June 1981, the cross was heavily damaged by high winds. Bud used the maintenance funds, but he also had to sell his home to help with the redesigning and rebuilding costs, which came to over $30,000. The cross was replaced in October 1983 with Bud in attendance. He told Eugene “Joe” Edwards, a local reporter, that, on top of being a memorial to his late wife and a tribute to God, he felt an obligation to Nelsonville to rebuild the cross as a tourist destination. A few years later, repeated vandalism to the three 1,000-watt mercury vapor lights made the monument only visible during the day. In 1996, the First National Bank Board of Directors and community members rewired the lights and created a pole-mounted light box to protect the new lighting from vandalism. The Brooks Shoe Company bought the property south of the cross and removed the trees blocking the city’s view of the memorial. Today The cross still stands, visible day and night, from most parts of the city, thanks to the local community. To visit the cross, turn onto Saint Charles Street from Poplar Street and go to the very end of the road.

The art center offers rotating art exhibitions with free admission, along with public programs, education programs, and community events. History Established in 1980 as a 501-c-3 nonprofit organization, San Jose ICA calls home to downtown San Jose. In the year 2000, the San Jose ICA came under the leadership of executive director Cathy Kimball, the former curator at the San Jose Museum of Art. Kimball helped the San Jose ICA to become a better known cultural institution in the Bay Area by presenting the works of renowned artists from the United States and around the world. After working for years toward their long term goal of acquiring a permanent home, in 2006 the San Jose ICA purchased a 7,500-square- foot building in the SoFA District (South First Area) of downtown San Jose. The 3,700-square-feet of gallery space within were divided into three different interchangeable gallery spaces that are in cohesive relation to one another. With the increase of gallery space, it allowed for a more continuous and long term exhibition space for site specific, solo, and group installations, a first in the San Jose ICA’s history. In 2011, the art space attracted 20,000 visitors a year. Attendance reportedly continued to increase through 2019. The San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art exhibited a series of metal sculpture by California artist Charles Ginnever in 2013. In 2014, the art center supported a solo exhibition by the painter Amy Ellingson. An exhibition held in 2019 featured the work of Alan Rath, a pioneer in electronic, kinetic, and robotic artwork. In June 2020, it was announced that Cathy Kimball would be succeeded by Alison Gass as director of the San Jose ICA.

It first appeared in the Model N, which made its debut at the 1906 New York Auto Show in New York City, New York. The engine at first was a 2 cylinder with two spark plugs per cylinder. The valves had an L layout, meaning there was one valve per cylinder. By 1907, there was a 4 cylinder option with the same layout as the two cylinder. Flathead Header Layout There are three main layouts for Flathead valve systems. The first is the L layout where the valve set off to the side of the cylinder with the valve stem pointing towards the crankcase and oil pan or the bottom of the engine.

Unlike the valves, the spark plugs were not set off to the side of the cylinder. Oddly enough both the plugs were directly over top the piston.

He is considered one of the pioneers in the bicycle industry. He died January 26, 2015, of a heart attack in Arizona. Early life and education Hawkins was born to second generation Swedish immigrant parents in the Twin Cities. His father Carl died in 1940, and his mother Elsie raised him alongside his two sisters Hazel and Helen. In 1950, he graduated from Minnehaha Academy and joined the US Navy, followed by technical school at Dunwoody Institute, learning welding and blacksmithing. Career In 1956, Hawkins purchased 'Hazel Park Radio and Bicycle' on White Bear Avenue and East 7th Street in Saint Paul, Minnesota's Hazel Park neighborhood along with his boyhood friend and business partner Art Engstrom. They opened a small bicycle repair shop, repairing and selling Schwinn bicycles. For their convenience, they invented a bike stand that lifted a bike off the ground and could swivel it around. In 1963, after introducing the stand to the Schwinn Bicycle Company and building them for Schwinn dealerships, they started a bicycle tools business they named Park Tool. They expanded to wheel truing stands, a variety of other tools and eventually tools for average cyclists. In 1967, they moved their store to White Bear Avenue and Highway 36, which grew to become 'Park Schwinn', a national top-10 Schwinn Bicycle Company dealership, eventually with three locations. In 1981, they sold all stores to concentrate on the bicycle tool business they had been running alongside the retail stores. The small tool company grew and became the world's largest supplier of bicycle tools, Park Tool Company, now in Oakdale, Minnesota. In 2000, Hawkins turned the business over to his son Eric, and one of Eric's three sisters also works for the company. In 2003, Hawkins retired. Legacy Bicycling Magazine wrote \\"The co-founder of Park Tool has never been a widely recognized figure, even in cycling circles. But his death last week reminded us of the impact his life had on the lives of cyclists and mechanics the world over\\". Park Tool sold nearly 300 different tools to bike repair shops in America, Europe and Asia, \\"identifiable by their [handle in a] trademarked shade of blue: Pantone 2935\\". Private life In 1958, Hawkins married his wife Donna, with whom he had 4 children, Suanne Banfield, Eric Hawkins, Carole Lehn and Sara Carlson, and to whom he was married to for 57 years. In 2003, Hawkins retired to his home in Mahtomedi, Minnesota \\"to ride his bike, work in his woodshop and to watch his 13 grandchildren grow up\\". He took up auto repair as a hobby and \\"never stopped riding his bike, a 1960 Schwinn Paramount\\". His son said, he \\"had been slowing down a bit, but still enjoyed building the company’s booths for Eurobike and Interbike\\". In the winters the couple would live in Scottsdale, Arizona. On January 26, 2015, he died of complications related to a heart attack a few days after coronary stent surgery in Scottsdale, Arizona. He is buried at Fort Snelling National Cemetery.

The primary purposes are hydroelectric power generation and agricultural irrigation. Work started in 2008. The first turbine came into production in 2013 and the other three turbines in 2014. With annual generation capacity of 599 million kilowatt hours, it has been called the \\"Tibetan Three Gorges\\". Nevertheless, the comparison is hyperbole since the dam is only able to impound less than 1/30th that of Three Gorges.(31.9 vs 0.97 million acre-feet). Description Lhünzhub County sketch map The Pangduo Dam impounds the Lhasa River in Pondo Township of Lhünzhub County, about from Lhasa. It is at an elevation of above sea level, upstream from the 100MW Zhikong Dam at . The objectives included hydroelectric power generation, irrigation, flood prevention and water supply. Of these, power generation and irrigation are the main purposes. The dam is one of a series that China has built on the Brahmaputra and its tributaries, others being the Yamdrok Hydropower Station, Nyingtri-Payi and Drikong. The rock-fill dam impounds of water. It is planned to irrigate of agricultural land. The power station has total installed capacity of 160 MW, with four generating units. The potential annual generating capacity is 599 GWh (million kilowatt hours). Construction The project involved a total investment of 4.569 billion yuan, or about 740 million US dollars, and has been called the \\"Tibetan Three Gorges\\". The dam and power station were built as part of the Western Development Strategy. Work started in 2008, and progressed on schedule. Damming of the river stream was completed in October 2011. The project included the world's deepest cut-off wall, at , with an axes length of . Construction of the wall was challenging, with glacial sediments underlying flood sediments. The construction team had to deal with the lack of oxygen at above sea level and the cold weather. The project was due to start operating its first generator in October 2013. The first generator set was supported by a computer monitoring system developed by the Beijing-based Institute of Water resources and Hydropower Research. The first generating unit started operation in December 2013, with annual generation capacity of 150 million kilowatt hours. The other three units were expected to come onstream in June 2014, bringing annual capacity to the total of 599 million kilowatt hours. Construction is expected to be completed in 2016.

Altmetric was recognized by European Commissioner Máire Geoghegan-Quinn in 2014 as a company challenging the traditional reputation systems. Altmetric is a portfolio company of Digital Science, which is owned by Holtzbrinck Publishing Group.  History  Altmetric was founded by Euan Adie in 2011. Previously a researcher, Adie had already worked on Postgenomic.com, an open source scientific blog aggregator founded in 2006. In 2011 Adie entered an altmetrics app into Elsevier’s Apps for Science competition and won. The prize money enabled Altmetric to develop a full version of the Altmetric Explorer, released in February 2012. In July 2012 Altmetric took on additional investment from Digital Science and is still a part of the group today, with offices in London, Germany, the United States and Australia.  Concept  A term first coined in the altmetrics manifesto in 2010, altmetrics (also known as ‘alternative metrics’) were developed to provide authors and other stakeholders a more comprehensive record of engagement with scholarly work, particularly that which takes place beyond the academy amongst a broader audience. In order to do this, Altmetric tracks a range of online sites and sources looking for ‘mentions’ (links or written references) to scholarly outputs (which include journal articles, blogs, data sets and more). Sources of the attention include the mainstream media, public policy documents, social and academic networks, post-publication peer-review forums and, more recently, Wikipedia and the Open Syllabus Project. The data are tracked in real-time and collated in the Altmetric details pages, which provide a clickable summary of all of the online attention relating to a single research output.  The Altmetric Attention Score and Donut Badge  Altmetric employs an algorithm to assign each item an automatically calculated score. Based on the volume and source of attention an item has received, the score is intended to reflect the reach or popularity of the research output. A multicolored ‘donut’ visualization is also generated to provide a summary of the sources of the attention that an item has received (red for news, light blue for Twitter, etc.). Altmetric make the data available via the Altmetric Bookmarklet, a browser plugin, the Explorer platform, a cloud-hosted database, and API. The sources include academic citations and academic platforms, patents, posts on social media and web forums, Wikipedia articles, users on Mendeley. Many publishers, including John Wiley & Sons, Taylor and Francis, The JAMA Network and Springer Nature embed the Altmetric ‘Donut’ Badges into their journal article and book pages to show the Altmetric score for individual items from within the publisher platform. Even though there is no clear link between altmetric scores and societal impact, they can be used to predict future citation impact , and may be a target for manipulation.

Powers, (October 3, 1900 – December 3, 1976) was a prominent police officer in the history of California, first as Chief of Police in Bakersfield, California (1933–1945) and as the chief enforcement officer at the state level (1944–1947) during which he co-established one of the earliest training programs for police in matters of race relations. Biography =Birth and youth= Robert \\"Bob\\" B. Powers was born October 3, 1900, in Las Vegas, New Mexico. He dropped out of school in the fifth grade. Somewhat charmed at the romantic stories of Lawrence of Arabia and military service, he enlisted in military service at 17 years old and was assigned to the 12th Cavalry Regiment. He worked as a personnel sergeant in 1920. He later worked as a clerk in the office of the chief of cavalry in Washington, D.C. until 1922. After being discharged, he served as a state trooper and corporal in New Jersey into 1923. He quit that job after hoping for advancement but working for an oil company to February 1924 was not it. Neither was re-enlisting as he found after a few months in 1924 at Fort Slocum (New York). He then worked as a railroad \\"special agent\\" protecting trains and added time as a deputy sheriff in New Mexico and Arizona. =Bakersfield police force= Powers was hired as a motorcycle patrolman in January 1928 for the Bakersfield Police Department though his actual work initially was as a stenographer. And he married Mildred Irwin, daughter of a former district attorney, December 1928. They had two sons by 1941. Because of his training as a solo officer earlier he made a reputation of solo achievements in the force and was promoted to sergeant in 1930. He developed an interest in traffic patrolling and management of security for schools. In 1931 he became a lieutenant, and later Chief of police of the Bakersfield police force in 1933. He also undertook professional training at the University of California, Los Angeles police school, the FBI school in Monterey and the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia. While police chief, Powers viewed the overall police force across the state as ill-educated, politically connected, and \\"corrupt\\" by modern standards. Out of a desire to shore up an independent and capable police force under his authority he began to revise procedures and investigative techniques and at the same time revise local regulation so that the chief's position was under a civil service categorization and thus under the city manager and not directly responsible to the city council. Powers instituted on-the-job training that included public school type curriculum like English classes so that officers would be more enabled to use words instead of weapons, and professional skills like handling fingerprints. He got the police to actually learn the law so that they didn't cause problems for themselves. In April 1944, Powers wrote a \\"letter to the editor\\" of the local newspaper about rules of engagement of police - that a policeman has an instant choice of killing someone or not whereas courts can take weeks or months to decide, and thus sometimes lets an apparent criminal escape. When he was appointed chief there were 38 houses of prostitution known in the community and only 11 when he left as Chief. Powers was also a strong voice in determining successive chiefs through to 1966. His appointed successor was able to close the remaining 11. Significant actions while Chief =California Agricultural Strike 1933= Perhaps his first major engagement as chief of police was in the repercussions of the California Agricultural Strike 1933. Under his review the marchers were allowed to take murdered bodies to City Hall to make their protest, noting, (when interviewed in 1970,) \\"Their motives may have been to turn this country 'Red', but their activities in attempting to get a living wage for the workers were certainly justified.\\" =Case of Mathias Warren= From May to October 1938 a murder case consumed his time - that of Mathias Warren, father to Earl Warren who was soon to be was Attorney General, then governor, and in time, supreme court justice. On hearing of the murder then district attorney Warren, who had cultivated a relationship with police in various departments and reporters, came to Bakersfield along with many friends seeking to help and there was some tension how the investigation would proceed. Powers insisted and Warren let Powers be in charge. Ultimately no one was charged with the crime - Powers ended up viewing it as a breaking-and-entering that became murder from a transient as Mathias Warren had chosen to live on a messy property while his wealth was tied up in land holdings. Of course the matter was covered in many newspaper stories.A brief selection:  However, as time went on the importance of the case, at least to Powers, had more to do with the increasing prominence of Earl Warren. Powers noted the transients of the period were the Okies, indeed The Grapes of Wrath was set in Bakersfield, and that the local establishment tried to keep them pushed out of the way. =Women officers= In June 1939 Powers took the stance of supporting an initiative to get women on the police force if they were college educated and paid well. It proved difficult to get the right funding with no officers hired by March 1941. However the first was hired by summer 1941 * and by the spring of 1942 what women officers and staff should wear was an active area of conversation. =Probed by political backlash= Powers had run across a local politician taking a bribe and sought prosecution. Through assistance with then attorney general Earl Warren a case was pursued but ended in a hung jury. Powers was himself then put under investigation by the city council and reports on its progress were carried in the newspapers March-to-April 1942. The final judgement was that the case against Powers was politically motivated and he had done no significant wrong. Powers took a leave of absence and for a period in World War II Powers and his lead staff were all enlisted in the Coast Guard from May 1942 to July 1943, ending service as chief gunner's mate, and instructor in gunnery. =A State Chief= Soon after returning to service in Bakersfield Powers was called up for a state level service, taking another leave of absence from Bakersfield. In July 1944 Powers was appointed to a wartime state committee on law enforcement under then Governor Earl Warren. In December 1944 Powers wrote for the committee advising fair treatment of Japanese as war ends. Initiated during wartime, the committee was revised and extended during peacetime and then attorney general Robert W. Kenny named him Law Enforcement Coordinator for the State of California in January 1945 and the family moved to Sacramento in February. Race relations In early 1945 Powers was directed to a race relations meeting in Chicago with the new American Council on Race Relations and began an endeavor of learning himself and then promulgating race relations issues across police departments. The first major project started in Richmond, California with Davis McEntire. Initial efforts were aimed at training the police in human relations including trying to eliminate prejudice and present the unfairness of segregation and discrimination based on race - factors later observed to be widespread needs. The work brought together leaders of the California Department of Corrections, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Japanese American Citizens League, and a Nisei, second- generation American of Japanese descent, US Marine. Together the social norms and prejudices of the day were vented, discussed, and broken down across a week of open-ended discussions. Following the training incendiary incidents arose in the community and the police took novel actions ensuring fairness and peace was retained. The Saturday Evening Post covered it in Cops don't have to be brutal, Dec 28, 1946. Following this numerous police departments even outside California were informed of the training and a booklet A Guide to Race Relations for Peace Officers was created and distributed, (including excerpts in the Baltimore Afro-American newspaper.) There was a prospective project by the young American Council on Race Relations using it and on making a training film with Powers writing the script, working with Edwin Embree. Out of this Powers was on a short list of leaders in the field though more recent scholarship critiqued the program for not including the local minority leadership of the time. Powers retired from police service in 1947 over differences with the new administration and was interested in promoting race relations issues. =Baháʼí= Around December 1946 to April 1947 Powers investigated the Baháʼí Faith while seeking a religious basis for living. He was attracted by the Baháʼí teaching of an unfettered search after truth. The first Baháʼí book he read was This Earth One Country - \\"When I read the chapter on Islam I accepted Muhammad as a Prophet. When I'd finished the book I was a Baháʼí ...\\" The book was oriented to the Baháʼí understanding of a view across religions and world peace. It was written by one of the first Jews of Canada to join the religion. This approach was reflected in his essay for the radio program This I Believe by Edward R. Murrow entitled \\"I stopped carrying a gun\\" in 1954. Los Angeles Powers first appears publicly presenting the religion in February 1948 giving a talk in Los Angeles Baháʼí Center.* * That year he also publicly reflected on his career in law enforcement writing two articles for the Saturday Evening Post - a two part series Crime was my business. In it of his twenty five years in police work he said \\"It's a long time to last without becoming a cynic\\" and: > During some of those years I was ridden by fear of being double-crossed out > of my job by politicians. Often I dreaded that some situation would catch me > unaware and daub me with the yellow mud of a coward's reputation. I worried > that I'd lose my temper, go haywire and end up before the grand jury > twisting my uniform buttons nervously and begging for mercy. There was the > wear and tear of wondering if the chiefs I served under would let me down > when I needed to be backed up. And after I got to be chief, there was never > a time when someone didn't hate my guts, and I had to be up on my toes to > keep my enemies from feathering my back with knives. He contributed an article in 1948 to volume 11 of the multi-year survey of the status of the religion's community around the world The Baháʼí World entitled An Experiment in Race Relations about his experience in 1945 dealing with race tensions. In 1949 he joined the editorial committee working on volume 12 and continued service in 1950. Around the same time he served on the Los Angeles Spiritual Assembly, chaired the committee overseeing the Baháʼí activities of the western states, and continued to be visible giving talks on the religion. * * Around these activities Powers was called upon by the State Assembly Committee on Crime and Correction to investigate a situation in Oakland that suggested police brutality in confronting communists and black-power protestors - issues that continued into the Berkeley riots (1960s). Powers found evidence that convinced him there were several murders by police being pushed into confrontations by leadership. He found the whole situation evil and hurt him physically to confront. In 1950 he cooperated in an effort to integrate a school in Duncan Arizona supporting a local civilian and fellow Baháʼí - Betty Toomis - and then attorney Stewart Udall. In the period Powers' son, Robert Jr, was in the military and was stationed in Guam from about May 1953 into 1956 and was accorded the title Knight of Baháʼu'lláh for his service to the religion while there. Arizona Powers and son Stephen were visible in September 1956 in a Baháʼí youth group in Tucson and in December 1959 he attended the Arizona state Baháʼí convention coming from Flagstaff. Powers suffered a stroke about 1960 but he was soon visible living in Yuma and giving a talk on the religion in April 1961 and 1962. Bakersfield The first known Baháʼí in Bakersfield was Mrs. W. H. Repogle who died about March–April 1934. A talk on the local radio station then named KPMC (now KNZR (AM)) broadcast a Baháʼí's story in 1938. A community of Baháʼís is visible by 1964 and giving public talks in Bakersfield in 1965. Stephen had returned to Bakersfield before 1965 and begun working for the police department, the very year that first female office of the Bakersfield police, hired by his father, retired. Powers himself had also returned and he was visible giving a talk on the religion in 1966. However, after working for the force for 3 years Stephen testified against the police, as a policeman, about an incident in Bakersfield resulting in a race harassment case against the police, and then father and son received harassment. Stephen resigned from the force August 1969. With the appointment of Earl Warren to the US Supreme Court a project to collect oral histories from those that knew him was undertaken and Powers was interviewed in Bakersfield. The resulting book was published in 1971. Among the anecdotes he told the interviewer, he remarked on a childhood event he said affected his whole life: The families of father and son Powers moved back to Tucson and was visible at a program for the World Religion Day observance in 1972. Powers died December 1976, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, aged 76. He is buried at the Chapel Hill Memorial Gardens Cemetery. Legacy March 5, 2010 a rebroadcast of Powers' This I Believe episode was aired on The Bob Edwards Show. The event was marked in Bakersfield. The show remains available. In the presentation the commentators reviewed his forward thinking efforts and the wide scale of his reading across religions and they were struck by his pursuit of knowledge from an awareness of Lawrence of Arabia to actually reading the Qur'an, the way the Bahá'í quote \\"The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens\\" was emphasized in his life and was found when there were so few Bahá'ís around, and the way the New Testament inspired him to \\"put down his gun\\".

Finney played college football for the Princeton Tigers football team and was selected by both the Football Writers Association of America and the International News Service as a first-team player on their 1950 College Football All-America Teams. He turned down an invitation to play in the Blue–Gray Football Classic to work on a thesis titled \\"Protestantism and Catholicism in 19th Century America.\\" Finney also played lacrosse at Princeton and was selected as an All-American in that sport in the spring of 1951. He was the first person to ever be named first team All-American in two sports in the same academic year; Jim Brown later became the second person to accomplish the feat. Finney later worked as an athletic coach and teacher and subsequently became the headmaster at Gilman School in Baltimore, Maryland. He retired as headmaster of Gilman School in 1992. Finney died in Mount Desert, Maine at the age of 89 on July 31, 2019.

Often confused with shark nets, shark barriers form a fully enclosed swimming area that prevents sharks from entering (nets aim to reduce shark populations).Meerman, R. “Shark nets vs shark enclosures”. ABC Science, 2009. Taken from: http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2002/03/07/2116717.htm. [Accessed 10/01/15]. Shark barrier design has evolved from rudimentary fencing materials to netted structures held in place with buoys and anchors. Recent designs have used plastics to increase strength, versatility and to reduce the environmental damage of bycatch. Shark barriers vs shark nets Shark barriers are commonly mistaken for shark nets. While they have the same objective of protecting swimmers, they have different characteristics as follows: =Exclusion method= Shark barriers work on the principle of excluding sharks from a designated swimming area. Shark barriers form an \\"underwater fence\\" from seabed-to-surface, beach-to-beach. Shark barriers are seen as a more environmentally friendly option as they largely avoid bycatch, however they cannot protect the same sized area as culling methods.McPhee, D. “Likely effectiveness of netting or other capture programs as a shark hazard mitigation strategy in Western Australia” Fisheries Occasional Publication, 2012. no.108, August. Available at: www.fish.wa.gov.au. =Culling method= Shark (meshing) nets operate as a catch-and-kill strategy to reduce the incidence rate of shark attack by reducing the local population size of sharks.\\"NSW Shark Meshing publications  NSW Department of Primary Industries\\". www.dpi.nsw.gov.au. Retrieved 20/09/14 Shark nets have been heavily criticized in the media for the environmental effects of bycatch.Dudley, S and Cliff, G. “Reducing the environmental impact of shark- control programs: a case study from Kwa-Zulu-Natal, South Africa”. Marine and Freshwater Research, 2011. vol.62, pp.700-709. They also don't provide a fully enclosed swimming area as sharks can swim above, below or around them. = Suitability for surf beaches = Shark barriers are not generally used on surf beaches because they usually disintegrate in the swell and so are normally constructed only around sheltered areas such as harbour beaches. Where there are surf conditions at Hong Kong beaches, the swell is \\"typically small\\". Even if they were in place at surf beaches, they would not protect surfers who go some distance from shore.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-22/fact-file- protecting-people-from-shark-attacks/5164882 The shark nets are more suitable for surf beaches as they can be anchored beyond the deepest sandbank and can be easily taken out of the water whenever any big swell is forecast.http://www.triggerbros.com.au/phils-ramblings-shark-nets/ Australia Shark barriers are currently used in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia. Many of the shark barriers used in Queensland also feature protection from poisonous jellyfish. Shark barriers are often made out of netting; held in place by a system of piles, anchors and buoys. Netted barriers are susceptible to damage from strong ocean forces and so are generally limited to sheltered bays and beaches and favourable seasons and weather conditions. Following the controversial Western Australian Shark Cull, the Western Australian State Government trialled a netted shark barrier in Dunsborough in 2013/14 and allocated funds for a new shark barrier to be installed in Busselton. Environmentally friendly shark barriers have also been developed in Western Australia in response to a string of fatal shark attacks on the WA coastline.“Shark attacks in Australia: a timeline”. Australian Geographic, 2014. Available from: http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/scienceenvironment/2014/01/shark- attacks-in-australia-a-timeline/. [accessed 07/01/15]. Hong Kong In Hong Kong, after three swimmers were killed by sharks in 1995, the government installed shark nets on gazetted beaches. Unlike the long-line and gill-net designs commonly used in Australia and South Africa, these are permanent installations and work as barrier nets. There have been zero fatalities since installation in 1995. As of 2014, shark nets are in place at 32 Hong Kong beaches. = Barrier net design = The Hong Kong nets are generally 35 mm square on the surface 2 m and 100 mm square thereafter. They are suspended off 225 mm HDPE pipe or BL14 Marine Float Lines, and anchored strongly to resist the many typhoons and waves up to 10 m. They are anti-fouled, and spend an average of 9 months a year in the water. An average net enclosure would be 500 m long and either semi-circular or rectangular in shape. They are diver- inspected a minimum of two times a week, and independent verification is required. They also exclude floating refuse, and clearly define the swimming area.

It was reported that at the time of the attack there was a two meter hole in the nets, most probably caused by the swell.http://magicseaweed.com/news/shark-attack-number-19-and-all-is-not-well- at-reunion-island/9420/ Environmentally-friendly shark barriers Development in materials has led to innovative plastic barrier designs that prevents marine bycatch. The rigid barrier panels allow fish and small marine creatures to swim through unobstructed, while restricting larger marine predators. New materials also potentially increase the scope of use beyond calmer waters. The first environmentally friendly shark barrier was trialled at Coogee Beach in Western Australia. The trial ran for four months between December 2013 and April 2014. Since this trial, new designs have emerged, including a new barrier from local company Eco Shark Barriers which was purchased by the City of Cockburn in 2014 (currently operational at Coogee Beach).“Summary of Agenda to be presented to the Ordinary Council Meeting to be Held on Thursday, 8 May 2014 at 7:00 PM” City of Cockburn, 2014. Available from: http://www.cockburn.wa.gov.au/Meetings_and_Minutes/Minutes_and_Agendas/3548-05_bocm_agenda_08052014.pdf. Accessed 5/10/14.“The Eco Shark Barrier”. Eco Shark Barriers, 2014 Available from: http://www.ecosharkbarrier.com.au/. [Accessed 10/12/14] Another barrier design has been produced from Form Designs Australia, who were also involved in the trial of the Eco Shark Barrier.“The Bionic Barrier”. Global Marine Enclosures, 2014. Available from: http://www.globalmarineenclosures.com/#bionic-barrier [accessed 10/12/14] The \\"Bionic Barrier\\" was designed to overcome some of the issues that arose in the trial, including increasing flexibility with hinge panels to adapt to tides and swell.“Review of the Dunsborough beach enclosure trial”, Hydrobiology Report, 2014. Taken from: http://www.dpc.wa.gov.au/science [Accessed 9/12/15]. The structural performance of this design could not be assessed although it potentially improves the current system. The general response by the public towards the environmentally friendly shark barrier at Coogee was positive (95%). It was also noted that the barrier acted as a form of artificial reef or FAD (fish attracting device) which was seen as a positive point of interest for the beach. In 2016 trials of two eco friendly shark barriers in NSW, Australia were discontinued after both manufacturers were unable to safely and effectively install the barriers.http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/sharks/shark-management Installation of the \\"eco barrier\\" by Eco Shark Barriers at the popular surf break Lighthouse Beach, on the New South Wales far north coast, had been stopped by the amount of sand movement which made it impossible for divers to install the moorings. Another kind of barrier, the Aquarius Barrier, designed by a different company, Global Marine Enclosures, was installed at Seven Mile Beach, Lennox Head, about 10 km up the coast. Head-high swell came over the course of a weekend and the barrier started to fray and disintegrate. Plastic from the barrier was scattered for kilometres. Locals were referring to the Aquarius Barrier as an “environmental disaster”.

Early life and background Hoare was the youngest of five sons of Charles Richard Gurney Hoare , and Rachel Georgina Bevan, of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, and was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. Military career Hoare entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, as a cadet, and after passing out was assigned to the Worcestershire Regiment with the rank of second lieutenant on 8 May 1901. On 4 January 1902 Hoare was seconded for service with the Indian Staff Corps. He was transferred to the British Indian Army on 13 February 1903, to serve in the 39th Prince of Wales's Own Central India Horse, and on 8 May 1910 he was promoted to captain. Hoare learned to fly, being awarded Royal Aero Club Aviators Certificate No. 126 on 29 August 1911, after flying a Bristol Boxkite at the Bristol Flying School on Salisbury Plain after four weeks instruction. In June 1913 Hoare was selected for training as an instructor for the newly created Indian Flying Corps, undertaking a course at the Central Flying School at Upavon before being officially appointed a flying instructor at the Indian Central Flying School at Sitapur on 14 April 1914. Following the outbreak of the war in Europe in August 1914, Hoare returned to England, where he was appointed a flight commander in the Royal Flying Corps on 12 September, being promoted to command of No. 7 Squadron as a squadron commander with the rank of temporary major on 24 March 1915. No. 7 Squadron were sent to France on 8 April, equipped with two flights of R.E.5s and one flight of Vickers Fighters (which were soon replaced by Voisins), and soon found itself engaged in the Second Battle of Ypres. Its first operations were flown on 16 April 1915, with each aircraft carrying three bombs. Tactical reconnaissance, artillery observation and bombing were its main duties, and on 12 May one aircraft made a particularly valuable reconnaissance, reporting a stream of enemy traffic moving through Valenciennes towards Douai and Lens, the first indication that the Germans were easing their pressure on Ypres and moving south for the battle of Festubert. No. 7 Squadron was then assigned to patrol the front lines between La Bassée and Lens, to provide cover for artillery observation aircraft during the battle of Loos. The squadron's awards list was opened on 15 July 1915 when Captain John Aidan Liddell won the Victoria Cross, bringing back his damaged aircraft despite being severely wounded. The squadron also had some success as a bomber unit, notably on a raid in September 1915 when Lieutenant M. G. Christie dropped two bombs on the railway yard at Valenciennes from a height of . His bombs hit two ammunition trains, both of which exploded, causing an immense amount of damage. Hoare finally handed over command of No. 7 Squadron to Major F. L. J. Cogan on 7 November 1915. On 15 November 1915 Hoare was appointed Assistant Commandant of the Central Flying School at Upavon, with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel, serving there until 2 April 1916, when he was appointed a wing commander, to serve as Officer Commanding, No. 14 (Army) Wing, tasked with supporting Fourth Army during the battle of the Somme. On 13 November 1916 Hoare was one of a long list of officers mentioned in despatches by General Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief of the British Armies in France. In January 1917 Hoare was appointed Officer Commanding, Royal Flying Corps Canada, an organisation formed to recruit and train pilots and aircrew, with its main base at Camp Borden, near Barrie, Ontario. On 1 August he was appointed brigade commander and became General Officer Commanding, with the temporary rank of brigadier- general. (His brother, Colonel Francis Hoare, served under him in charge of technical branch.) On 1 April 1918, the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged to form the Royal Air Force, and Hoare was commissioned into the RAF with the same rank. On 3 June 1918 Hoare was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) \\"in recognition of distinguished services rendered in connection with the war\\", and also received another mention in despatches. By the time of the armistice of 11 November 1918 Hoare's organisation had trained 3,135 pilots and 137 observers, of whom 2,539 pilots and 85 observers had been sent overseas. On 24 April 1919 Hoare relinquished his Royal Air Force commission on ceasing to be employed, and reverted to his army rank of major in the Indian Army. On 3 June 1919 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the King's Birthday Honours. Major and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Hoare retired from the Indian Army on 21 January 1923 and was granted the honorary rank of brigadier-general.

She was also Countess consort of Manderscheid- Blankenheim by marriage to . Life Born in Hachenburg, she was the eldest child of Ernest, Count of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn and Countess Louise Juliane of Erbach. She was probably named after her father. In his will, Count Ernest left his domains to his only son Louis, under the regency of his mother Louise Juliane during his minority. In case he would die prematurely, his two surviving daughters (Ernestine and Johannetta) would inherited the County. =Succession= When Count Louis died four years later (16 July 1636), the male line of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn died out. A violent dispute over his inheritance erupted between the Dowager Countess and the three half-brothers of her late husband (sons of Count William III and his second wife Anna Ottilie of Nassau-Weilburg), who claimed the succession of the whole County.Count Ernest and his sister Johannetta (by marriage Countess of Erbach- Erbach) are the only surviving children of Count William III of Sayn- Wittgenstein-Hachenburg and his first wife, Anna Elisabeth of Sayn, only daughter and heiress of Count Hermann of Sayn; in consequence, the Sayn inheritance only could be passed to Ernest's descendants, the last of whom are the sisters Ernestine and Johannetta. After two months, one of them, Count Louis Albert of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Neumagen, finally forced Louise Juliane to surrender the County to him and his brothers. In the meanwhile, Count Christian, Louis Albert's youngest brother besieged Altenkirchen and the Electorate of Mainz besieged Hachenburg, who was forced to surrender when the food ran out; without options, Louise Juliane and her daughters fled to Freusburg. When the Electorate of Trier prepared to besiege Freusburg, they fled to Friedewald, where they found safety. =Rule= Louise Juliane sued her in-laws before the Reichskammergericht and the Emperor. She sent her councillors to Münster and Osnabrück where the Peace of Westphalia of 1648 was being negotiated. The rights of Ernestine and Johannetta were recognized and, with Swedish assistance, one part of the county after the other was returned to her. In Hachenburg on 21 October 1651, Ernestine married Count Salentin Ernest of Mandersheid-Blankenheim (6 August 1630 – 18 February 1705). They had seven children. One year later (1652), Louise Juliane finally handed over the County of Sayn to her daughters, who was divided in two parts: Sayn- Wittgenstein-Sayn-Hachenburg (for Ernestine) and Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn- Altenkirchen (for Johannetta, who was at that time Dowager Landgravine of Hesse-Braubach).Women in Power: 1640-1670 [retrieved 27 September 2014]. =Legacy= Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hachenburg was inherited by Maximilian Joseph in 1661 following Ernestine's death, and after his death in 1675 was inherited by his youngest surviving sister Magdalena Christina, who through marriage in 1715 passed the County to the Burgraves of Kirchberg until 1799, when by marriage was inherited the Counts of Nassau-Weilburg and to the Counts of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg in 1803.

It originally aired on January 6, 2015, on CBS. It is the seventy-ninth overall episode for the series. \\"If-Then-Else\\" was written by Denise Thé and directed by Chris Fisher. The episode continues the series' long-running Samaritan storyline. It centers on the Machine evaluating a list of possible strategies to allow the team to succeed in a mission to recover New York City's stock market after Samaritan attacks the stock exchange and cripples the city's financial system. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was watched by 10.08 million viewers with a 1.7/5 ratings share in the 18 to 49 age demographic upon airing. The episode was highly acclaimed by critics and audiences alike, with reviewers praising the originality and execution of the premise, the thematic value, and the shocking ending, with many calling it one of the series' best episodes. Plot Following the events of \\"The Cold War\\", Samaritan cripples New York City's financial system after attacking the stock exchange. Amidst the turmoil of the plummeting stocks, Finch (Michael Emerson), \\"Root\\" (Amy Acker), Reese (Jim Caviezel) and Fusco (Kevin Chapman) head to the New York stock exchange to revitalize it, where Decima Technologies operatives ambush the team, prompting them to take cover inside an office. Meanwhile, Shaw (Sarah Shahi) is in a subway train spying on a man with access to the stock exchange's security codes. Matters are complicated when a suicidal man unveils a bomb vest he threatens to detonate. Root consults the Machine for help, and the Machine in turn evaluates the possible strategies to help them succeed. The episode periodically flashes back to 2003, where Finch is in a park playing chess with the Machine, and using the games as analogies to various concepts he teaches it. Several games later, as the Machine is appearing triumphant on many occasions, Finch tells it that he doesn't enjoy chess since it was created during a time of cynicism and societal imbalance. Finch believes people should not be assigned \\"values\\" and sacrificed; those who treat life as game of chess deserve to lose. In the present day, the Machine uses its knowledge of chess as a basis to narrow down its options and run simulations. In the first, Finch and Root go to the security room, while Fusco and Reese take over elevator controls. This results in Decima forces overpowering both teams and killing Finch. The second option swaps the destinations of the two groups, which ends up with a wounded Reese detonating a grenade, killing himself and everyone in the security room. Root professes her love to Shaw before dying. Both of these scenarios also show Shaw shooting the suicidal bomber and being arrested by SWAT teams. In the third option, the whole group non-violently takes over the security room and stabilize the market while Shaw talks the suicidal man out of bombing the train. Left with little time, the Machine deploys the third option, even though it only has a 2.07% chance of the team's survival in taking over the elevator. These odds increase to 22.48% when Shaw arrives with explosives to fend off the attackers. The elevator, however, stops functioning right as they are about to escape. Shaw is forced to leave it and press an override button on the other side of the hallway, passionately kissing a concerned Root before doing so. But before she can return to the elevator, Martine (Cara Buono) catches up and shoots Shaw multiple times as the elevator doors close, while Root and the team watch in horror. Production \\"If-Then- Else\\" was written by longtime Person of Interest writer Denise Thé and directed by Chris Fisher, also a veteran crew member. This is Thé's tenth episode written for the series and Fisher's eleventh directing credit. The episode's narrative structure is significantly different from other episodes in that the majority of the episode is made of simulations, by the Machine, of various scenarios resulting in different outcomes. The execution of this tactic was praised by several commentators due to its opportunity to include humor and more outlandish elements than what is typically allowed. Series showrunner Greg Plageman also voiced his initial skepticism over the idea until he realized the value of it, and went forth with it. The episode marks the temporary departure of Shaw (Sarah Shahi, pictured), due to the actress's pregnancy. The episode's most notable development is the supposed death of the character of Shaw - the event sparked rampant discussion and response from the cast and crew. Series executive producer Greg Plageman stated that the reason for Shaw's sacrifice was mainly due to actress Sarah Shahi's pregnancy with twins. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Shahi said about the decision, \\"When you become a parent, that task takes priority over everything. It would be impossible for me. At the end of the day, nothing is more important than the health and the comfort of my children... ...But I've so enjoyed this character. She’s so dynamic. I get to pretend to be a superhero every week on TV, so that’s definitely the bitter part of the ‘bittersweet.’\\" Plageman said that the main goal of the ending scene was to convey it \\"heroic\\" and a \\"self-sacrifice\\". Actress Amy Acker stated in an interview that she felt this episode was the \\"climax\\" of the season, and that it embodied the true \\"war\\" between the Machines, feeling that the episode finally managed to deviate from a sense of buildup that the rest of the season always seemed to bear. When asked about Root's relationship with Shaw, Acker referenced a quote hinting at a romantic development from the season's fifth episode, and followed by saying, \\"I feel like even if it's not a romantic relationship -- even though the writers have hinted to us that it is -- that whatever it is they do care about each other. And they have each other.\\" However, it has been hinted that Shaw may not have been killed off entirely; Shahi stated that her leave is temporary and, pointing out that the episode is the second in a three-part episode series, said about Shaw's death: \\"That is what the team is going to have to figure out. Is she alive? Did Samaritan capture her? Where is she? The rule in TV is if you don’t see a body, then they’re not dead.\\" Actor Michael Emerson also voiced various theories over Shaw's fate. Nonetheless, the cast still offered praise to Shahi and said their goodbyes to her. Later, the closing scene of episode thirteen confirmed that Shaw is alive. The music used during the simulation segments is \\"Fortune Days\\" by American electronic music group The Glitch Mob. The episode title is a reference to the computer programming syntax, \\"if-then-else\\". Reception =Ratings= \\"If-Then-Else\\" aired on Tuesday, January 6, 2015 and, according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 9.97 million viewers with a 1.7/5 ratings share in the 18 to 49 age demographic. =Reviews= \\"If-Then-Else\\" attracted near universal praise from critics, with many regarding it as one of the series' best episodes. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a perfect rating of 10 out 10, indicating it to a \\"masterpiece\\", and praised the simulation format, the action scenes, the emotional value, and the ending. He called the episode \\"next-level inventive\\" and a \\"jolting, exciting, heart-wrenching episode\\". Fowler said the ending scene \\"crushed\\" him, and he also offered praise to the significance of the flashbacks to the chess games. Alexa Planje of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A rating, and in her review, said that though the task of executing a story structured like \\"If-Then-Else\\" was difficult, the episode did so \\"elegantly\\" - she cited the \\"interesting score, vibrant color work, and humor\\" as the key elements. Planje said the episode \\"aces every scenario\\" during the simulation segments, and appreciated how the episode transformed itself from what appeared to be a \\"standard mission-focused story\\" into a \\"moving ode\\" to Shaw. She also praised the episode's exploration of the parallels between being a human and being a machine. Shant Istamboulian of Entertainment Weekly lauded Emerson's performance in the flashbacks and felt the season marked the series' \\"creative peak\\". He concluded by saying \\"Moving like a rocket, this episode is fast, funny, exciting, and, ultimately, sad, ending with what seems like the loss of another team member. We’ll have to wait until next week for the outcome, but as it stands, “If-Then-Else” is an instant classic.\\" Tim Surette of TV.com also had high praise for the episode, calling it \\"playful, mind- bending, heart-breaking, and flat-out excellent.\\" He praised the episode's incorporation of its \\"recurring theme of sacrifice\\", and called the flashbacks \\"as fascinating and provocative as anything the series has done.\\" Surette cited his favorite part of the episode as the exploration of the Machine's perspective, and additionally praised the humorous segments. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic compared the episode's style to that of the 2014 film Edge of Tomorrow, and called the episode's ending an \\"emotional gut-punch\\". He praised the episode for not \\"settling for the typical\\" and not letting its heroes always win, concluding by saying \\"There’s drama, action, humor, victory, defeat, surprise and the always guaranteed form of entertainment.\\" He gave the episode a rating of 4.6 out of a possible 5 stars. Courtney Vaudreuil of TV Equals pointed out the effectiveness of the chess flashbacks, and also praised how the episode followed through on the \\"sense of paranoia\\" the series created after killing Carter in season 3. Hunter Bishop of TV Overmind gave the episode a full 10 out of 10 stars, called the episode \\"perfect\\" and offered extremely high praise for Shaw's death scene and the episode's exploration of its themes of humanity. He also praised the episode's simulation segments and its usage of the flashbacks.

The white, stone church was built in a long church style in 1857 using designs by the architects Andreas Grønning and Frederik Hannibal Stockfleth. The church seats about 400 people. History The original medieval stone Stord Church was probably built around the year 1300 on the same place as the present church. In 1724, the church was sold by the Crown to Lieutenant Colonel Hans Fredrik Green to pay for the debt from the Great Northern War. In 1854, the church was sold back to the parish and at that time, the old church was deemed to be small and in poor condition so it was torn down just after Pentecost in 1855. A new stone church was completed in 1857 and it was consecrated on 6 September 1857. Construction was led by the architect Andreas Grønning, but he died before the work was completed, so Frederick Hannibal Stockfleth from Bergen oversaw most of the construction.

(Loose cones) The Federal Signal 3T22 was an outdoor warning siren made by Federal Signal Corporation (formerly Federal Sign and Signal Corporation) from 1952 through the early 1990s. It has a very recognizable design, having a ten-port rotor (chopper) on the bottom with ten cones (horns) and a 12-port one on top with twelve cones. History The Federal Signal 3T22 was originally designed as the 2T22 in 1952 or 1954. The 2T22 had the same number of ports and cones. It could produce two main signals (it could produce more but the other signals were rarely used), hence the name \\"2T22\\" (the 22 representing the 22 cones and horns). The siren had no solenoids, so it could not perform a \\"hi-lo\\" signal. In 1955, Federal designed the 3T22, which was similar, except for its name and that it had solenoids. The 3T22 was superior in design because it could perform the \\"hi-lo\\" signal, which is mainly used for fire calls. The 2T22 and 3T22 could produce 113db (measured 100 feet away from the siren). There are four models of this type of siren. the 2T22 A and B and the 3T22 A and B. In the name 3T22, the 3 stands for its three main signals: attack (wail), alert (steady), and hi-lo, and the 22 again stands for the twenty-two cones. The A or B determined whether the motor was three phase or single phase. A 3T22A would be three phase, while a 3T22B would be single phase. The siren was mainly used for air raid warnings during the Cold War era and weather warnings after the war. In the early 1990s, the siren's production was stopped when it was replaced with the newer 2001-SRN, which could reach 126db (also measured 100 feet away), hence the name. Like many other older siren models, these sirens are becoming more uncommon due to their age and because of newer technology. Note: the prototypical design for the 2T22 was 7/12 port. Design The 3T22 came in only one port ratio: 10/12. It had ten ports and cones on the bottom and twelve ports and cones on the top. It also had a smaller cone on top to reduce rain and other water-related substances such as snow from getting inside. It had two solenoid boxes, one on top, and one on the bottom. There were also two air intake spots: also one on the top and bottom. The siren had a small stand with three legs so it could be mounted on a pole or roof. The stand could be removed and the siren could be mounted differently.

It underlies the northern third of Lake County, Indiana and the northern tenth of Porter County, as well as small parts of LaPorte County and Cook County, Illinois. It is notable chiefly for its high levels of contamination by industrial waste from factories and toxic waste dumps in the Calumet Region. It is bordered to the south by Valparaiso Moraine Aquifer, and to the north by Lake Michigan. It is underlain by a Silurian bedrock aquifer complex. Cities on top of the aquifer include Gary, Hammond, and East Chicago. The aquifer sits in unconsolidated deposits of fine sand and glacial till in the Calumet Lacustrine Plain, with some occasional lenses of peat and gravel and areas of slag fill. As a result, it is especially vulnerable to contamination from surface sources. The aquifer has never been extensively used as a source of water, local communities instead drawing water from Lake Michigan. The area above the Calumet Aquifer receives an average of 36 inches of precipitation per year. Twelve inches per year are recharged into the aquifer. The storage coefficient of the aquifer is 0.12, which because the aquifer is unconfined, means that it yields about 12% water by volume. As a groundwater aquifer, the Calumet Aquifer provides water to local surface waterways, including the Grand Calumet River and Little Calumet River. The contributions can go in both directions: when the Little Calumet is in flood stage, it rises above the aquifer level and water from the river enters the aquifer. The aquifer also receives water from the Valparaiso Moraine Aquifer to the south, via the bedrock system that underlies both. Over most of its area, the aquifer averages in saturated thickness and lies approximately below the surface. Its greatest saturated thickness is around . The Calumet Aquifer is sometimes subdivided into the Calumet Aquifer and Lacustrine Plain Aquifer, with the Calumet Aquifer proper occupying a relatively narrow band along Lake Michigan, and also underlain by the Lacustrine Plain Aquifer in the subtill layer.

He was a prominent citizen of Toronto, Ontario and was widely recognized for his expertise in patent law. He was also the owner of one of the first electric cars in Canada. Biography Portrait of Frederick B. Fetherstonhaugh, c. 1891 =Family and education= Frederick B. Fetherstonhaugh was born in Paisley, Ontario on June 2, 1863 to Francis Fetherstonhaugh and Frances Swift. He was a descendant of the Irish Fetherstonhaughs of Carrick House in County Westmeath. His father Francis immigrated to Canada around 1859, and resided in various towns in Ontario including Orillia, Guelph, and Paisley, until he settled in Toronto with his family. Fetherstonhaugh attended the Ryerson School in his youth, where he excelled academically, eventually winning a scholarship to the Toronto Collegiate Institute for two years. He then attended the University of Toronto, taking courses at the School of Practical Science in Mechanical Engineering. Before finishing his diploma, however, he decided to pursue the study of law. He married Marion Arabella Rutledge in February 1887 and had four children, though only the eldest—James Edward Marion (b. 1888)—survived into adulthood. Godfrey Orme (b. 1889) died of a cerebral hemorrhage after his nurse lost control of his baby carriage; Marion Vivian (b. 1890) died of \\"infantile convulsions\\" in 1892; and Frederic Harold (b. 1892) died on the eve of his fifth birthday when he was struck by a streetcar while crossing Spadina Ave in front of the family home near Harbord St. His eldest son James Edward Marion would later attain the rank of Major in the Canadian Army after serving in World War I and joined his father's patent business after the war as an engineering expert. =Law career= The Globe, May 2, 1890 Fetherstonhaugh began his career with the patent law firm Donald C. Ridout & Co, where he was a draftsman along with Charles Riches and James E. Maybee before his call to the bar in 1889. One year after his bar admission, in 1890, he formed his own firm, Fetherstonhaugh & Co., where he took up practice as a patent lawyer. The firm Fetherstonhaugh & Co. opened its first location on the second floor of the Bank of Commerce Building at 19-25 King St W, and was the first tenant of the building.The Globe (Toronto). 2 May 1890. p. 2. His patent law practice expanded quickly. In 1895, an Ottawa office was opened at 7 Elgin St, managed by T.S. Young. In 1896, he opened a Montreal office with his brother Edward James Fetherstonhaugh. By 1905, offices had been opened in New York City (managed by Albert T. Nathan, a former patent examiner) and in Washington, DC. In 1904, Russel S. Smart joined his firm as the manager of the Ottawa office. Smart later took over the legal practice of the firm while Fetherstonhaugh continued his patent agency, forming a partnership that has continued to this day as Smart & Biggar/Fetherstonhaugh. By the time of Fetherstonhaugh's death in 1945, several more offices had been established across Canada, including in Hamilton, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Halifax, and Saint John. During his career, Fetherstonhaugh was recognized as a leading expert in his field and was regularly consulted by Parliament regarding legislative amendments to patent laws and regulations. Around 1905, he advocated for uniformity of patent legislation within the British Empire, arguing that it would enhance scientific progress and reduce costs for inventors obtaining patents in multiple jurisdictions. In support of this proposal, Fetherstonhaugh drafted the Empire Patent Act, which was designed to coordinate the policies of patent offices across the British Empire. However, his proposed unification of patent laws in the British Empire never came to pass. Fetherstonhaugh was made a King's Counsel in 1910. =The Fetherstonhaugh car= Photo of the Fetherstonhaugh Car, one of the first electric cars in Canada, shown at the Toronto Exhibition in c. 1896. Fetherstonhaugh was an enthusiast of new technologies and was most notably an early adopter of the electric automobile. In 1893,There is some debate about this date. Secondary sources place the date at 1893, but the first public record of such a car appeared in an article in The Globe dated 1896, which described the car as if it were the first of its kind. See Wencer (2012). Fetherstonhaugh unveiled a battery-powered \\"horseless carriage\\" at the John Dixon works factory on Bay Street in Toronto. This was one of the first such carriages to appear in Canada. An article in The Globe covering the debut of the Fetherstonhaugh vehicle described it as a carriage having four horse power, with a top speed of 15 miles per hour (24 km/h) and a battery that lasted for five hours of continuous driving. It weighed 700 pounds, including a 100-pound motor and 270 pounds of batteries. It had a covered top and windows to protect against the elements, and had electric headlights for night time driving. An iron bar was used to steer as well as control the power. U.S. Patent No. 517,668 to W.J. Still, drafted by F.B. Fetherstonhaugh The electrical and mechanical components of the vehicle were the result of 18 months' work by inventor William Joseph Still (who later developed the Still engine), for whom Fetherstonhaugh had obtained several automobile-related patents in Canada. Fetherstonhaugh himself evidently assisted in the overall design of the vehicle and the vehicle was assembled by John Dixon, a reputable carriage maker of the era.Wencer, David. \\"Historicist: The Dawn of the Horseless Era\\" Torontoist. 26 May 2012. The car was allegedly worth $500 at the time, but Fetherstonhaugh decided to keep it for himself as a personal vehicle with which he commuted to work and around the city. To recharge the car, Fetherstonhaugh connected it to the trolley wires running near his home. He later purchased his own gasoline generator to recharge the batteries. Fetherstonhaugh kept the car until around 1912, when it was sold. Its whereabouts after 1912 are not known. The Fetherstonhaugh car appeared at the 1893 Toronto Industrial Exhibition (predecessor to the Canadian National Exhibition), where it was driven around a track for demonstration. It appeared again in 1898 along with other new automobiles. In 1993, a commemorative $100 gold coin designed by John Mardon was issued by the Royal Canadian Mint to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Fetherstonhaugh car. The success of this early electric automobile inspired a group of Toronto businessmen to form the Canadian Motor Syndicate, with William Still as an engineer and later its vice-president. The Syndicate produced several more cars, but it survived only until 1899. Still went on to form the Still Motor Company, building electric and later gasoline-powered engines for vehicles. Fetherstonhaugh was an avid supporter of transportation infrastructure. He was an early advocate for a bridge between Toronto and the Toronto Islands at the Western Gap near the site of what is now the Toronto island airport. Fetherstonhaugh's interest in transportation technology also extended beyond electric cars. In 1909, it was reported that an experimental airship was being tested from his Mimico property in collaboration with one of his clients. Fetherstonhaugh also believed that airports would one day become obsolete as aircraft would be able to take off and land from flat rooftops of buildings. =Lynne Lodge: Fetherstonhaugh's Mimico estate= Lynne Lodge, residence of Frederick B Fetherstonhaugh in Mimico, Ontario (1895). Detail of entrance. Designed by Henry Sproatt.Buoyed by the success of his patent business, Fetherstonhaugh commissioned a lavish residence for himself in 1899 on a large plot of lake shore property in Mimico (near the intersection of Lake Shore Boulevard and Royal York Road today) just outside the Toronto city limits at the time. He was one of the first to move into what would eventually become a residential suburb while commuting regularly to Downtown Toronto for work. The primary residence he built was named \\"Lynne Lodge\\", after his mother's family home in Ireland. It had a view of Lake Ontario but was close to the streetcar line running along Lake Shore Blvd at the time. Lynne Lodge was designed by Henry Sproatt, a prominent 20th century Canadian architect. It was built in a Queen Anne revival style, and it is believed that the building was designed during Sproatt's \\"independent period\\", completed before he began a partnership with Ernest Rolph in 1901. Guest House of Lynne Lodge, nicknamed \\"The Towers\\", at the residence of Frederick B Fetherstonhaugh, viewed from Church St.Additions were made over the years to the residence, including a stable (later converted to a gardener's cottage) and a boat house. Around 1910, a stone guest house was built on a point of land on the Mimico property known as \\"Thunder Head\\", which jutted out into Lake Ontario at the foot of Royal York Road. The guest house was named \\"The Towers\\" for its architectural features resembling a castle. The Towers were used by his wife for painting, and later for their son James after his return from World War I. In the 1930s, the musician Horace Lapp lived in The Towers as a tenant for a period of time before moving into the boat house, to which he added a second floor with Fetherstonhaugh's permission. After Fetherstonhaugh's death in 1945, Lynne Lodge was sold to a series of developers, serving a short stint as the Lynne Arms Italian Village restaurant before it was demolished in 1957 to make room for an apartment building. The Towers and the boat house were also later demolished, though parts of the walls can still be seen. The gardener's cottage (at 2669-2673 Lake Shore Blvd W) remains the only surviving part of the Fetherstonhaugh estate, and was designated as a Heritage Property by the City of Toronto in 2011. =Memberships and associations= Fetherstonhaugh was a founding member of the British Empire Club, and served as its president in 1910. He was presented at Windsor Castle in June 1905 to King Edward VII and attended the coronation of King George V in 1911. =Later life and death= Fetherstonhaugh's wife Marion died on November 7, 1930 at the age of 63. Two years later, Fetherstonhaugh married Audrey Victoria Emaygh, a singer from New York who was 32 years his junior. However, his second marriage was an unhappy one, and they divorced shortly thereafter. In his later years, his finances deteriorated and his business was eventually taken over by Russel S. Smart. He also became estranged from his son James due to a dispute over James' divorce and second marriage. Fetherstonhaugh died on July 6, 1945 at the age of 82. Upon his death, his estate was valued at only $13,000. His sister Frances was the paternal grandmother of actor Christopher Plummer.http://www.beachmetro.com/2015/05/19/famous-son-forgotten-father/ Notes References Category:1863 births Category:1945 deaths Category:Lawyers in Ontario Category:Law firm founders Category:Canadian Queen's Counsel ","title":"F.

Luke Simpkins and Don Randall moved the spill motion at the meeting. Incumbent Prime Minister Tony Abbott and deputy leader of the Liberal Party Julie Bishop jointly stood in opposition to the motion which was defeated by 61 votes to 39.http://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2015/02/09/breaking-tony-abbott-survives- spill-move/ A September 2015 leadership spill would see Malcolm Turnbull defeat Abbott 54 votes to 44. Background Tony Abbott became leader of the Liberal Party in December 2009 after forcing a leadership ballot on the subject of Malcolm Turnbull's support of the Labor First Rudd Government's proposed Emissions Trading Scheme. Joe Hockey was initially thought by political commentators as the favourite to win the ballot. However, Hockey was defeated in the first round of voting, and in the second and final round, Abbott defeated Turnbull by 42 votes to 41 to become the party's leader and Leader of the Opposition. Bishop was re-elected as Deputy Leader, and declared subsequent to the ballot in a 2013 interview that she supported Turnbull. Abbott led the Liberal/National Coalition to the 2010 federal election where a hung parliament was the outcome. After a protracted period of negotiations, Prime Minister Julia Gillard formed the Second Gillard Government. Following the 2010 election, Abbott and Bishop were re-elected unopposed as leaders of the Liberal Party. Prime Minister Abbott on Australia Day 2015, the day it was announced that Prince Philip and Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston were appointed Knights of the Order of Australia.At the 2013 federal election, Abbott led the Coalition to victory over the incumbent second Rudd government. Abbott and his ministry were sworn in on 18 September 2013. Abbott government came to power with 53.5 percent of the two-party preferred vote. However, the Coalition failed to win control of the Senate, that resulted in several blockages of the Coalition's proposed legislative reforms including university education and TAFE deregulation, co-payment for general practitioner visits, and a paid parental leave scheme. By the May release of the 2014 budget, average polling revealed that the Abbott government's two-party preferred vote had decreased to 46 percent; and despite an upward swing in polling between August to October 2014, by late January and early February 2015, polling had reduced the two-party preferred vote to 45 percent. A Fairfax/Ipsos poll in released in early February revealed that Abbott's approval rating had fallen 9 points to 29 per cent since December and his disapproval had risen 10 points to 67 per cent. Abbott trailed Labor Opposition leader Bill Shorten as preferred Prime Minister by 50 per cent to 34 per cent, an 8 point worsening for Abbott since December. On Australia Day 2015 Abbott announced that Queen Elizabeth had accepted his recommendation that her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, be appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia. The appointment was criticised by Shorten who said: \\"It's a time warp where we're giving knighthoods to English [sic] royalty. Some people (have) wondered whether it was an Australia Day hoax.\\" Adam Giles, Northern Territory chief minister and Country Liberal Party leader, said: \\"I woke up this morning and read the wires and was confused between Australia Day and April Fool's Day,\\" adding \\"It makes us a bit of a joke. It's Australia Day, we're not a bunch of tossers.\\" Abbott later stated that he had made a captain's call and not consulted with his cabinet colleagues over the appointment. Abbott faced criticism from some parliamentarians in his own party and the Nationals over the proposed appointment. Meanwhile, the 2015 Queensland election was held on 31 January with Abbott asked to stay away from Queensland during the campaign period. Premier Newman, who lost his seat at the election, claimed that the decision to award a knighthood to Prince Philip caused an unwanted distraction in the final days of the campaign as Newman sought to focus on jobs and the economy. The sitting Liberal National Party suffered a 14 point two-party swing, and lost what was considered an unlosable election (owing to its overwhelming majority) to Labor, which subsequently formed minority government. Dissent initially emerged from backbenchers, including Andrew Laming from Queensland, and Western Australia's Dennis Jensen, who was the first Liberal MP to publicly call on the prime minister to resign.http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4173524.htm Their dissent was echoed by several other Liberal backbenchers, including Simpkins and Randall from Western Australia. On Friday, 6 February, Simpkins submitted to the Chief Government Whip a motion, seconded by Randall, to spill the parliamentary leadership positions of the Liberal Party. On the day before the leadership spill vote, Abbott announced that a planned submarine deal, which previously seemed likely to be manufactured by Japanese shipbuilders, would instead proceed with an \\"open tender\\". This announcement came as a surprise as the Government had resisted calls for an open tender months prior to the spill motion, and was seen as an attempt by Abbott to secure support from South Australian parliamentarians, such as Senator Sean Edwards who warned he may not support Abbott in the motion over the issue. ASC Pty Ltd, the Government owned naval shipbuilding corporation is based in Adelaide, South Australia. After, the government chose to call it a \\"competitive evaluation process\\" rather than an \\"open tender\\" with no indication of what would change. Liberal Party voting rules Under party rules, any Liberal MP or senator can propose a motion to spill the party's leadership. The leader of the party then invites a discussion of the motion at a party room meeting, and makes a decision whether to call a vote on the matter based on the sentiments which are expressed. The leader can also choose to conduct this vote through a public show of hands or a secret ballot. Abbott stated, before the ballot, that it would be conducted in secret, as has previously occurred. By convention, Liberal Party ministers are expected to vote against conducting leadership spills. If a vote on the spill motion is conducted, and a majority supports a spill, the leadership is declared to be vacant. Candidates then nominate for the position, and a vote is held among the members present at the meeting. If more than two people nominate, multiple rounds of voting take place if no candidate has a majority, with the lowest-placed candidate being eliminated until a candidate has a majority of the votes of a ballot. There were 102 Liberal members at this spill, and 52 would need to be in favour for the motion to succeed if all were in attendance at the party room meeting. Vote Malcolm Turnbull would become Prime Minister of Australia after defeating Abbott at the September 2015 Liberal leadership ballot. On the morning of 9 February, The Australian reported that a Newspoll survey conducted over the previous days had found that Abbott was the most unpopular Prime Minister since Paul Keating in 1994. The survey also found that Bishop or Turnbull would be preferred to Abbott as the Prime Minister. The Australian Financial Review stated that the results of this and other recent polling were \\"disastrous\\" for the government, and that \\"Voters have adopted an 'anyone but Abbott' view of the Liberal leadership\\". A motion to spill the leadership was voted on, and defeated, in the Liberal Party meeting which commenced at 9am on 9 February. All of the Liberal MPs and senators other than Ross Vasta attended the meeting; Vasta was on paternity leave. A total of 61 members voted against the motion, 39 supported it and one cast an informal vote. Following the vote Abbott delivered a speech to the members calling for their support, and promised to consult more with backbench MPs. In this speech, Abbott also made a new commitment to further cut tax rates for small businesses, promised that the 2015 budget would leave families better off and agreed to reduce the role his chief of staff Peta Credlin plays in the government. After the Liberal Party meeting concluded, Abbott made a televised statement in which he said that \\"The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us\\". Michelle Grattan, writing in The Conversation, argued that the \\"narrow margin\\" of the vote left Abbott \\"deeply vulnerable to later destabilisation\\". News Limited journalist Malcolm Farr wrote that Abbott had been \\"given, at best, a stay of execution\\". On 13 February, Abbott removed Father of the Parliament Philip Ruddock from his position as Chief Government Whip in the House of Representatives and replaced him with Scott Buchholz. Some Liberal MPs and journalists attributed Ruddock's removal to Abbott being dissatisfied with Ruddock's performance in managing the tensions leading to the spill motion. However, Bishop and some other MPs rejected any link. Abbott stated that he had made the change as part of reforms to provide \\"a deeper and stronger engagement with the backbench\\", and it was not retribution against Ruddock.

It was designed by Lange Leopold Powell and built from 1915 to 1916 by B Cunningham. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 February 2002.  History  The Brisbane Associated Friendly Societies' (BAFS) Building was officially opened in 1916 as a pharmaceutical dispensary and headquarters of the Brisbane Associated Friendly Societies. The building is located on the corner of George and Turbot Streets in Brisbane city and was designed by the notable local architectural firm, Chambers and Powell. It was the fourth city building occupied by the BAFS and the first that the society constructed themselves. The BAFS has had a presence in Brisbane city since 1885. A focal point for friendly societies throughout Queensland and the thousands of members they served, BAFS was an important force in health care in Queensland up to the mid twentieth century. Queensland's first friendly society was established in 1843, members paid a monthly fee and were then entitled to claim sick and funeral benefits as necessary. Friendly Societies had emerged in Britain in the late eighteenth century as the country industrialised and a new class of urban worker emerged. Originally formed with the purpose of organising recreational activities for city workers, Friendly Societies soon grew into self-help organisations where members pooled their resources and helped each other out in times of need. During the 1860s, membership of Friendly Societies flourished in Australia and the Societies expanded their services, contracting doctors to provide consultations to their members and beginning to provide free medicines. The medical fraternity became increasingly alarmed at the expansion of Friendly Societies and the threat they perceived to their profession. In response, the Societies amalgamated further, with the aim of providing even more comprehensive services. They aimed to offer greater choice of doctors and services, in premises they owned themselves. Pharmacists were less \\"protectionist\\" than doctors and Associated Friendly Societies (AFS) dispensaries were established throughout the capital cities of Australia. The first BAFS dispensary was set up on 1 January 1885 in a small room in the Oddfellows Hall in Charlotte Street. At this time, the BAFS had 1200 members and incorporated nineteen Lodges. In 1893, a South Brisbane dispensary was opened by the BAFS. The next year the city dispensary moved to designated premises at 217 Queen Street. The dispensary stayed there until 1905 when it moved again to 344 Queen Street, in one of the premier retail blocks in the city. In 1909, the BAFS celebrated its Silver Jubilee, its membership was 7185 and it now incorporated 100 Lodges. The same year, they established their third dispensary in Fortitude Valley. At the Annual Meeting in February 1915, it was reported that the membership had reached a total of 13,000 and that the property on George Street had been secured at the cost of for the purposes of building their own premises. A prospectus was prepared and sent out to all member Lodges, inviting them to support the building project through a debenture scheme. Debentures worth were issued, the response from the Lodges was overwhelming and the amount was oversubscribed. Chambers and Powell Architects were commissioned to design the building and the Foundation Stone was laid on 4 September 1915. Lange Powell was the designer of the building as his partner Claude Chambers had moved to Sydney in 1915. Powell responded to the toast to \\"The Architects and Builders\\" at the opening ceremony. Powell went on to do further architectural work for the BAFS, such as re-furbishing the building they purchased in 1919 at 146 Wickham Street, Fortitude Valley. Powell was an eclectic architect who understood well the design canons of the styles of the Interwar period. The best known of his surviving city buildings demonstrate considerable stylistic literacy, for example, the Ann Street Masonic Temple in Ancient Classical style and St Martins Hospital in Arts and Crafts style. The design of the BAFS Building has stylistic similarities, albeit on a smaller scale, with other examples of his commercial work in the city, such as Perry House, Preston House and Exton House. Brisbane Associated Friendly Societies (BAFS) Building, corner of George and Turbots Streets, 2015 The George Street building was designed as a \\"head dispensary\\", intended to showcase the success and progress of the BAFS. The inscription of \\"1885-1916\\" on the George Street facade clearly reflected the Society's desire to maintain links with their history in Brisbane. A souvenir booklet written in 1916 claimed \\"it stands as a monument to the enterprise and progressiveness of the Associated Friendly Societies and is an acquisition to the architecture of George Street and the city, generally\\". The building had three floors and a basement, the whole of the ground floor, at street level, was occupied by the dispensary, the first floor accommodated offices for lease and the third floor contained two large rooms for use for meetings by the Board of Management and Lodges. The building, constructed by B Cunningham, had been completed at a cost of . By the 1920s, the battle that had been raging between doctors and Lodges over who should control medical care had been largely won by the doctors due to the formidable fight waged by the British Medical Association - a dispute that had consequences across Australia. The BAFS Medical Institute, a collection of doctors who worked for the BAFS management committee considered amalgamating with the dispensaries but did not, effectively ending the connection doctors had with the BAFS. Dispensaries, however, continued to flourish and the 1920s was characterised by strong growth. BAFS purchased their own premises in Fortitude Valley and South Brisbane; however George Street attracted over half of the total sales and over 60% of the total number of prescriptions for most of the decade. The interwar years were the \\"golden age\\" for the BAFS. The building was a hub of Lodge activity, the shops and offices of the \\"BAFS Chambers\\" were constantly let and included tenants such as a milliner, a masseuse and a car hire firm. There was also an Honorary Dentist and Honorary Optician who were paid a salary by BAFS and provided free services to members until at least 1940. One half of the top floor was used as a hall by Lodges who did not have their own premises, as well as for BAFS annual and quarterly meetings and a variety of social events such as smoke concerts. The BAFS is now known as Friendly Care Chemists and has pharmacies in six locations across Brisbane, including George Street. The head office of the Society is still at George Street; however, both the Fortitude Valley and Woolloongabba premises have been sold. Only a small number of the offices are used and tenants include a barber, doctor and modelling agency.  Description  Brisbane Associated Friendly Societies (BAFS) Building, lettering and mortar-and-pestle detail, 2015 The BAFS Building is a three-storey building with basement, constructed of load-bearing masonry that accommodates a pharmacy and offices. The building has sculptured, parapetted facades to both George and Turbot Streets which feature carefully detailed Classical and Art Deco-style decorative elements. The bottom half of the building is smooth- rendered and painted in a cream colour, which is also used on the mouldings around the windows and in bands on the corners of the building to simulate quoining. The first floor windows are set within wide arched openings which have exaggerated moulded keystones that connect to the sills of the upper floor windows. The upper floor windows have moulded surrounds with Art Deco- style decoration at the top that comprises a stepped pattern around a central keystone. The first floor windows are multi-paned casements with arched heads and at upper level are multi-paned sashes, all have deep sills. Air conditioning units have been inserted into some of the first floor windows. The George Street facade is symmetrically composed, with a central feature at upper level of a small balcony supported on corbels with a wrought iron balustrade. A pair of French doors, surmounted by a fanlight, open out on to this balcony. A round window decorated with festoons is directly below the balcony, followed by another small square window directly below this. A sign is located at the top of the facade, with the raised lettering \\"B.A.F.S Dispensary 1885-1915\\" The sign sits upon a short and simple entablature with prominent dentils. Mortar and pestles are mounted at each corner of the facade. Brisbane Associated Friendly Societies (BAFS) Building, Turbot Street facade, 2015 The Turbot Street elevation is more simple but also has a high degree of symmetry. The corners of the parapet are stepped and scalloped and there is a central semi-circular cut-out in the centre of the parapet. There are three horizontal bands of five windows, at street level they are high level narrow horizontal windows. Two downpipes with prominent rainwater heads are located either side of the central window and the entrance door is located off-centre beneath the second last line of windows, towards the back lane. The pharmacy is located at street level with a recent shopfront of sliding glass doors to George Street. A deep awning returns around the corner a short distance into Turbot Street and is supported by iron tie-back rods. A doorway situated within the chamfered corner at street level, is no longer used. The Turbot Street elevation follows the slope of the street and a service laneway is located at the rear of the building. The slightly recessed entrance to the offices (BAFS Chambers) leads to a small vestibule and concrete stairwell providing access to the upper floors. The open well stair with two quarter landings has cast iron newel posts, timber balusters and a curved timber hand rail. A doorway from the back of the pharmacy also opens into the stairwell. The enlarged landing of the staircase serves as an anteroom for the first floor offices, adjacent to this is an external light well. An arched doorway leads to a hallway on the left that provides access to the BAFS offices and a small barbershop. The hallway terminates in large double doors that facilitate loading from the rear laneway, a similar loading area is also located at the top floor. A kitchenette and toilets are located in the north-east corner of the building and have some original fittings. The hallway to the right leads to the BAFS Boardroom and several offices, some of which are occupied by doctors and others which are vacant. Partitions in this area are generally fibro-cement sheeting with simple timber joinery and glass in the upper third section of wall There are some suspended tiled ceilings and timber floors are carpeted throughout. The northern end of the upper floor of the building has a similar floor plan to the first floor and contains offices and toilet and kitchen facilities. The former hall is located at the southern end. This is a large, well-lit, uncluttered space with an open ceiling with timber trusses and polished timber floorboards. French doors lead to the small balcony overlooking George Street. The upper floor is currently leased by a modelling agency who have fitted a reception area at the top of the stairwell. The basement is accessed from an area at the back of the pharmacy which also contains an office, kitchenette, loading dock and large general storage area. The basement occupies the entire space of the ground floor and is partially subterranean. There is a regular pattern of columns and rows of storage shelves. A vault where medicines and pharmaceutical materials were previously stored is located in the space underneath the upper stairwell. Toilets are located in the north-east corner with a loading area adjacent.

Tunisia was in a similar position to that of Algeria, with a geographic position which linked it the main Trans-Saharan routes. It received caravans from Fezzan and Ghadamès, which consisted solely, in the eighteenth century, of gold powder and slaves, according to contemporary witnesses. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, slaves arrived annually in numbers ranging between 500 and 1,200. From Tunisia they were carried on to the ports of the Levant.  Origins  Routes of Arab trade in the Middle Ages Tunsian slaves derived from two principle zones: Europe and a large area stretching from West Africa to Lake Chad. The kingdoms of Bornu and the region of Fezzan provided the majority of caravans. The greater part of the slaves were reduced to slavery in local wars between rival tribes or in abduction raids. Caravan routes from many Saharan centres terminated at Tunis. In addition to Ghadamès, which connected the beylik to Fezzan, Morzouk and the Kingdom of Bornou, Timbuktu was in regular contact with the Beylik via the caravan route which passed through M'zab and Djerid and put the country in touch with African groups and peoples of a large zone touching the Bambara lands, the city of Djenne and several regions of the central West Africa. The names of slaves and freedmen reported in archival documents confirm these multiple, diverse origins: beside common names like Burnaoui, Ghdamsi and Ouargli, are names indicating origin in other centres of West Africa like Jennaoui and Tombouctaoui. European slaves, for their part, were captured in the course of razzias on the coast of the European lands, mostly Italy, France, Spain and Portugal, and from the capture of European ships. The men were used for diverse tasks (slave drivers, public works, soldiers, public servant etc.), while women were used as domestic workers and in harems. Unlike the men, it was very rare for women to be freed, although the women often converted to Islam.  Numbers  Although quantitative data does not exist for the eighteenth century, some partial censuses carried out in the middle of the nineteenth century allow some approximate conclusions about the number of slaves throughout the country. Lucette Valensi offered an estimate of around 7,000 slaves or descendants of slaves in Tunisian in the year 1861, using registers which include lists of manumissions. Lucette Valensi, « Esclaves chrétiens et esclaves noirs à Tunis au XVIIIe siècle », Annales. Économies, Sociétés, Civilisations, vol. 22, n°6, 1967, However, such systematic records of the black population are not effective for several reasons: the abolition of slavery had occurred ten years before the first records of the subject population were taken for the mejba (a tax instituted in 1856), and therefore a good part of these groups, scattered through the various layers of society had escaped the system of control. The frequency of collective manumissions of black slaves at the death of a prince or princess reveals some important comparative numbers. In 1823, 177 slaves were manumitted at the death of a princess.Archives nationales de Tunisie, série historique, dossiers relatifs aux familles princières, document 58188 Based on the figures provided by travellers, Ralph Austin established some averages, leading to a total estimate of 100,000 slaves.Ralph Austin, The Transaharian Slave Trade. Essays in the economic history of the Atlantic slave trade, New York Academy Press, 1979 For his part, Louis Ferrière in a letter to Thomas Reade, the British consul in Tunis, estimated there were 167,000 slaves and freed slaves in 1848. Concerning European slaves, the number of women is difficult to determine. Some historians, like Robert C. Davis,Robert C. Davis, Esclaves chrétiens. Maîtres musulmans. L'esclavage blanc en Méditerranée (1500-1800), éd. Jacqueline Chambon, Paris, 2006 estimate their number at around 10%, but these numbers are based on the redemption of slaves; it may simply indicate that women were rarely redeemed. This figure of 10% is especially dubious since the slaves acquired in coastal razzias were more numerous and in these razzias women constituted an average of five out of every eight people taken captive. Further, the distribution of slaves across regions was not homogenous. In the southeast, the proportion was quite high (especially in the oases). Some villages contained a clear majority of slaves, like those to the south of Gabès. At Tunis, despite continuous supply, the group likely remained a minority of the population, not exceeding a few thousand. The areas of concentration of slaves were thus spread between Tunis, the Sahel and the southeast. According to Raëd Bader, based on estimates of the Trans-Saharan trade, between 1700 and 1880 Tunisia received 100,000 black slaves, compared to only 65,000 entering Algeria, 400,000 in Libya, 515,000 in Morocco and 800,000 in Egypt. Raëd Bader, Noirs en Algérie, XIXe-XXe siècles, éd. École normale supérieure de Lyon, 20 June 2006  Organisation  The social organisation of traditional Tunisian society offered a range of specific roles for slaves in Tunis. The agha of slaves, generally the first eunuch of the Bey, was charged with maintaining order among the groups and ruling on disputes which might arise between masters and slaves or among the slaves themselves. Records and accounts confirm the relative autonomy of organisation which was granted to the slaves of Tunis and the protection which the government extended to them, protection which reveals the government's acute awareness of the rules of good conduct and treatment of slaves prescribed by Islam. In effect, by protecting this minority, the government was assured of its unconditional loyalty, especially that of the guards of the Bey, who were recruited from the slaves. In addition to this politico- administrative arrangement, the slaves obviously had their own specific religious organisations as confraternities, whose functions were not limited to the spiritual lives of the members. The confraternities took on multiple social functions which became most apparent after the manumission of a slave. For slaves, manumission usually represented the passage of the slave from the wardship of the master to that of the confraternity, which substituted for the extended family or tribe.  Functions  = Economic role = House of Christian slaves in Tunis Slavery in Tunisia responded mainly to the needs of the citizen society. However, study of the main businesses of the city of Tunis, which has been performed by many scholars, does not indicate concentrated use of slaves in labour-intensive sectors.Pierre Fennec, La transformation des corps de métiers à Tunis sous l'effet d'une économie de type capitaliste, Tunis, 1964 The major traditional industries like weaving, making the chéchia or leather continued to be reserved for the local workforce. Labour in these businesses was still performed by free people and one could not attribute slavery to economic needs. However, in the oases of southern Tunisia, groups of slaves were employed in agriculture and especially in irrigation works. It was in the south of the country that slavery continued most prominently after its abolition in 1846 and into the twentieth century. Viviane Pâques relates similar phenomena, \\"At the oases, slaves were especially in use as domestic servants, for sinking wells and for digging canals. They worked from sunrise to sunset, getting only a plate of couscous for their toil. When they become chouchane, their status is that of khammès and they get a percentage of the harvest. But their workload remains the same...\\"Viviane Pâques, L'arbre cosmique dans la pensée populaire et dans la vie quotidienne du nord-ouest africain, Paris, 1964 = Domestic = On the other hand, the sources are unanimous about the heavy domestic character of slavery in Tunisia. In face the possession of slaves constituted a mark of nobility in Tunis and the almost universal possession of one or more slaves for domestic tasks attests to a pronounced tendency of contempt for physical work, a traditional aristocratic characteristic. Some general practices in the Tunisian court contributed to entrench this tradition: the princes from the Hafsid period down to the Husainid beys solely employed slaves as palace guards and servants in their harem. By integrating slaves into the daily life of the court, the princes provided a model of slave use for the thousands of aristocrats living at court and for the civic nobility. = Government = In addition, as the French doctor and naturalist Jean-André Peyssonnel notes, Christian slaves of European origin who converted to Islam could rise to high positions - even to the chief offices of state, like the Muradid Beys, whose dynasty was founded by a Corsican slave, or several ministers of the Husainid dynasty, such as Hayreddin Pasha, who was captured by corsairs and sold in the Istanbul slave markets. Some princes, like Hammuda Pasha and Ahmed I Bey were even born to slave mothers. Other slaves of European origin became corsairs themselves after converting to Islam and captured other European slaves (sometimes attacking their own hometowns).  Abolition  Old slave market in the Medina of Tunis Hayreddin Pasha, slave of Circassian origin On 29 April 1841, Ahmed I Bey had an interview with Thomas Reade who advised him to ban the slave trade. Ahmed I was convinced of the necessity of this action; himself the son of a slave, he was considered open to progress and quick to act against all forms of fanaticism. He decided to ban the export of slaves the same day that he met with Reade. Proceeding in stages, he closed the slave market of Tunis in August and declared in December 1842 that everyone born in the country would thereafter be free. César Cantu, Histoire universelle, traduit par Eugène Aroux et Piersilvestro Léopardi, tome XIII, éd. Firmin Didot, Paris, 1847, p. 139 To alleviate discontent, Ahmed obtained fatwas from the ulama beforehand from the Bach-mufti Sidi Brahim Riahi, which forbade slavery, categorically and without any precedent in the Arab Muslim world. The complete abolition of slavery throughout the country was declared in a decree of 23 January 1846. Original decree of 23 January 1846 on the enfranchisement of slaves (National archives of Tunisia) French translation of the decree of 23 January 1846 on the enfranchisement of slaves (Portal of Justice and Human rights in Tunisia) However, although the abolition was accepted by the urban population, it was rejected - according to Ibn Abi Dhiaf - at Djerba, among the Bedouins, and among the peasants who required a cheap and obedient workforce.Ibn Abi Dhiaf, Al Ithaf, tome 4, pp. 89-90 This resistance justified the second abolition announced by the French in a decree of Ali III Bey on 28 May 1890. Décret du 28 mai 1890, Journal officiel tunisien, 29 May 1890 This decree promulgated financial sanctions (in the form of fines) and penal sanctions (in the form of imprisonment) for those who continued to engage in the slave trade or to keep slaves as servants. The colonial accounts tended to pass over the first abolition and focus on the second.  After abolition  Over the second half of the nineteenth century, the majority of the old slaves, male or female, formed an urban underclass, relying on their former masters or living in precarious circumstances (foundouks on the outskirts). Often they work as bread sellers, street merchants, masseurs in the Moorish baths, domestic servants or simple criminals, easily nabbed by the municipal police for drunkenness or petty larceny. Up to 10% of prostitutes in Tunis are descended from former slaves.Dalenda et Abdelhamid Larguèche, Marginales en terre d'islam, Tunis, éd. Cérès, 1993 After abolition, then, a process of impoverishment and social marginalisation of the old slaves took place because enfranchisement had secured legal emancipation but not social freedom.

This process is what led to the extinction of several species, including the Irish Elk. Ecosystem decay can be mainly attributed to population isolation, leading to inbreeding, leading to a decrease in the population of local species. Another factor is the absence of competition, preventing the mechanisms of natural selection to benefit the population. This leads to a lack of a skill set for the animal to adjust and adapt to a new environment. Although similar to forest fragmentation and island biogeography, ecosystem decay is what results in the event of forest fragmentation. Overview Ecosystem decay is a natural phenomenon that has several resulting features. * Decline of native populations of animals * Decrease in genetic diversity * Decrease of the interior:edge ratio * Isolation of an area of viable habitat * Reduction in viable habitats and often extreme separation Process The process through which ecosystem decay occurs can be long and complicated or short and hasty. Overall, it still follows some basic guidelines. First, a piece of habitat is surrounded and thus isolated by farmland or cities. Secondly, pollination of the plants immediately ceases and the number of species thins out. Thirdly, through generations of inbreeding and thus higher birth mortality than birth survival rate and infertile dirt, the forest fragment will slowly decline to nothing.  Causes  Ecosystem decay is commonly caused by the harvesting of rain forest in appliance to certain laws or illegally for profit by humans. Certain countries such as Brazil prohibit the harvesting of Brazil nut trees and groves of this species causing forest fragmentation and thus causing ecosystem decay to occur. Cities, roads, farms and any other substantial barrier impeding and animals habitat can be a direct or an indirect cause. Naturally, fires and rising sea levels on low land can also cause habitat fragmentation and thus ecosystem decay. Although this process is much more lengthy, many species such as the Irish Elk and several species of ancient Australian Marsupials have been indirectly killed this way with contributions by Climate Change, Glaciation and Forest Fires.  Studies  Eleonore Setz was studying a patch of equatorial rainforest named reserve #1202 containing Pithecia pithecia (white-faced sakis), to study the effects of ecosystem decay. The 9.2 hectare (less than 25 acre) area had been isolated for five years when David Quammen noted results on the fragmentation of their habitat which resulted in them being stranded. The population of P. Pithecia was slowly declining at the time of the study and the population had declined to six.  References  =General references= * Harris, Larry D. (1984).

Background The album marks the first appearance of \\"The Race Is On\\", which later became one of Jones's biggest hits and remained a concert staple throughout his long career. According to Bob Allen's book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, Don Rollins composed the song one day after visiting the Turf Paradise Race Track in Phoenix, Arizona. It features tongue-twisting lyrics that use the fast-paced images of a horse race to describe a broken relationship. Allen writes of Jones's memorable vocal: \\"By gleefully bending and stretching the notes and singing, at times, slightly ahead of or behind the song's fast-clipped meter, he embellished it with a subtle sense of tension and release that perfectly complemented the rapid-fire cascading effect of the song's lyrics.\\" The album also contains \\"She's Mine\\", which would become a top ten hit for Jones on Musicor in 1969, and \\"Love's Gonna Live Here\\", a 1962 song written and popularized by Buck Owens, who was one of the few country singers who rivalled Jones's success in the 1960s. \\"Book of Memories\\" is a cover of the Charlie Louvin song, \\"My Book of Memories\\" released earlier in 1964. \\"Least of All\\" was originally recorded by Sonny James earlier in 1964 as \\"Least of All You\\". \\"Holiday for Love\\" was originally recorded by Webb Pierce in 1957.

The text in sixty- eight verses describes the path to Self-knowledge or the awareness of Atman. The Vedanta tradition states that the text was written by Shankara for his disciple, Sanandana, also known as Padmapāda. However, recent scholarship doubts that the text was written by Shankara. Atmabodha is also the title of an Upanishad attached to the Atharvaveda. Etymology Atmabodha means \\"Self- knowledge\\", self-awareness, or one with the \\"possession of a knowledge of soul or the supreme spirit\\".Atmabodha Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany Authorship The authorship of Ātma-bodha, written in Sanskrit language, is traditionally ascribed to Adi Shankara who is believed to have lived in the 8th century A.D. Even though the authenticity of this work is doubted by present day scholars, it does not contradict the Advaita system which it advocates. Contents The original text consists of sixty- eight verses and describes the way to the attainment of the knowledge of the Atman. As in Vivekachudamani, Shankara teaches that the Ultimate Reality or Brahman, the foundation of all, is beyond name and form, is of the nature of Pure Consciousness, but who can be realized by pursuing the Path of Knowledge, not by worship. Atmabodha text reiterates that the Path of Knowledge consists in shravana (hearing the instructions of a teacher), manana (reflecting on what is heard) and nididhyasana (meditating on Truth with single-minded devotion); viveka (philosophical discrimination) and vairagya (renunciation of all that which is unreal) are the basic disciplines required to be followed and that it is not possible for religious actions (Karma, fasting, vows, pilgrimage)PN Menon (1964), Atma Bodha of Sri Śaṅkarācharya, Munshi Ram Manohar Lal, , pages 6-7 to destroy ignorance (avidya) and cause liberation (moksha) – Shankara describes the world and the individual soul are in true essence Brahman, the Absolute Reality, with the nature of Sat-chit-anand, or truth-consciousness-bliss. Brahman is the substratum on which is projected by imagination all the manifested things of the world; the all-pervading Atman illumining the mind and the senses shines in the intellect (Buddhi) just as the reflection in a mirror. The self-abiding Jivanmukta, states verses 49-51 of Atmabodha, is satisfied with his state of bliss derived from Atman (soul, self), is free from hate for anyone, seeks unity, is perfected in peace, grows radiant, rejoices with what he has, is the one who \\"shines inwardly, like a lamp placed inside a vase\\".Adi Śaṅkarācārya (Translated by C Johnston), , Divine Life Press Chicago, page 8 Commentaries and translations Nikhilananda states that Shankara's Vedic non-dualistic (Advaita) philosophy is based on the divinity of the soul, the unity of existence, the Oneness of the Godhead. The first translation of Ātma-bodha into English language from Sanskrit by J. Taylor was published in 1812 titled - The Knowledge of Spirit, later another translation rendered by Rev. J.F.Kearns, along with English commentary and titled - Atma Bodha Prakashika, was published in the May, 1876 issue of The Indian Antiquary (pages 125-133). An English translation and commentary of 1944 by Swami Nikhilananda was published in India in June, 1947 by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai. Ramana translated Ātma-bodha into Tamil in verse-form.

The current line-up of the band consists of Bryan Funck (vocals), Andy Gibbs (guitar), Matthew Thudium (guitar), and Mitch Wells (bass). History The band was formed by guitarists Andy Gibbs and Matthew Thudium, bassist Mitch Wells, and drummer Terry Gulino. Thou released their first full-length effort, Tyrant, in 2007 after the arrival of the vocalist Bryan Funck. These were followed by their second studio album Peasant in 2008 and a string of EPs, including Malfeasance Retribution EP (2008), The Retaliation of the Immutable Force of Nature (2008), Through the Empires of the Eternal Void (2009) and Baton Rouge/You Have Much to Answer For (2010). Their third full- length album, Summit was released in 2010. The band's fourth studio album, Heathen, released in 2014, was met with critical acclaim. This album marked the first time in the band's career that the band had featured cleanly sung vocals from collaborator Emily McWilliams. The album was named the best metal album of 2014 by music website Pitchfork. Thou has toured with and collaborated frequently with fellow sludge metal band The Body, whom they most recently collaborated with on the album entitled, You, Whom I Have Always Hated. In 2020 they are releasing a collaboration album called May Our Chambers Be Full with Emma Ruth Rundle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImMHsDDV_YA Style and artistry Thou's style has been labeled as \\"experimental doom\\", stoner metal and sludge metal. On the band's style, Allmusic critic Gregory Heaney stated that \\"the band's sound blends the shuddering heaviness of doom with the oppressive atmospherics of black metal, giving the band a monolithic sound that feels, at times, inescapable.\\" Thou has taken a DIY approach to touring which has become a defining characteristic of the band and its aesthetic. Thou's lyrics often espouse anarchist views. Thou also has covered artists from various rock music genres, including Nine Inch Nails' \\"Terrible Lie\\" (with The Body) and Nirvana songs \\"Something in the Way\\", \\"Sifting\\", and \\"Aneurysm\\".

The kernel is said to be completed by 2013, with no other news on it available (by the end of 2016). Architecture RGK is described using boundary representation (B-rep). But other descriptions are used when necessary. For instance, to optimize the speed of kernel's functions, and to ensure precise storage and computation of the model, canonical objects and NURBS curves and surfaces are used. To solve tasks associated with complex operations (such as hole-covering surfaces, N-side patches, and blending surfaces in complex cases), special types of curves and surfaces are used by the kernel. Low-level and high- level operations Kernel functions can be grouped under another criterion: low-level and high-level ones. The low-level operations include constructing curves and surfaces (canonical objects, NURBS, offset curves and surfaces, and so on), projecting points and curves on surfaces, intersecting and extending curves and surfaces, modifying topology (including Euler operations), and so on. Low-level operations enable application developers to modify kernel data in a most flexible manner, practically operating in manual mode. High-level operations include operations that are standard for body generation, and Boolean operations on bodies (union, subtract, and intersect). It can be used with solid and surface bodies, and with combinations of the two. Platforms The geometric kernel supports 32- and 64-bit architecture, and Windows and Linux platforms.

It was designed by Lange Leopold Powell and George Gerald Hutton and built from 1923 to 1925 by Blair Cunningham. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 April 2005.  History  The former Austral Motors Building, which closes the vista at the end of Upper Adelaide Street, Petrie Bight, is located on the Fortitude Valley side of Boundary Street at the northern end of the Brisbane central business district. Constructed in 1924–6 for the Austral Motors Company, it has a close association with the 20th century interwar re- development of the Petrie Bight area as an important warehousing precinct and motor vehicle servicing and distribution district. Petrie Bight is a sharp curve in the Brisbane River at the northern end of the Town Reach. The name is derived from the association of the area with early Brisbane builder Andrew Petrie, who established his workshop and residence at the corner of Wharf and Queen Streets. = Early Petrie Bight land use = Surveyor Henry Wade, on his 1844 Map of the Environs of Brisbane Town, identified the Petrie's Bight area south of Boundary Street and east of Queen Street as \\"Reserved for Dry Dock\\". Surveyor Galloway did the same on his 1856 Plan of the Suggested Extension of the Town of Brisbane. At this time the surrounding area was sparsely occupied, with Andrew Petrie's house and factory at the corner of Wharf and Queen Streets; Dr Hobbs' house (now St John's Deanery) a little further north in Adelaide Street; the original Customs House in Queen Street, beside the Brisbane River; and a ferry jetty just north of the Customs Houses. A map of Brisbane Town showing the new town boundaries no longer labelled Petrie's Bight as a reserve for a dry dock (no dry dock was ever established there), but the site remained unsurveyed Government land. An early track (the northern end of Queen Street) ran through this land, branching off in three directions to New Farm, Fortitude Valley and the northwest end of Spring Hollow. Under the provisions of the Brisbane Gas Company Bill 1864 the Queensland Government granted to the Company a site bounded by what are now Ann, Boundary and Macrossan streets and a frontage to the Brisbane River, as the site for Brisbane's first gas works. This was the northern half of the Government land at Petrie's Bight. Gas production commenced there in 1865, providing the Brisbane Municipal Council with a regular supply of gas for street lighting. By the early 1870s the demand for gas for domestic consumption was outstripping supply, and in the mid-1870s a second gasometer was constructed on the site. In 1873 the Brisbane Gas Company gained a formal deed of grant to the Petrie's Bight land, an area of , which the Company had purchased from the Government in May 1873 for . An April 1873 a survey plan titled Survey of Site of Gas Works and Adjacent Crown Land Shewing Road Through Same indicates that by this date the gas works site was fenced along the entire length of its land boundaries, but that through this the government had just surveyed a wide road between Macrossan and Boundary streets, which later became an extension of Adelaide Street. Photographs from the 1860s and early 1870s show a tall paling fence around the perimeter of the gas works, prohibiting public access. Early Brisbane resident Victor Drury, writing in The Courier-Mail in 1939, recalled: \\"When Adelaide Street was extended to Boundary Street, there were turnstiles there, and only pedestrians could use the path as a short cut to Queen Street.\\" = River wharfage = In the early 1840s wharfage in Brisbane was concentrated along the South Brisbane Reach of the Brisbane River, but within a decade had extended to the Town Reach further downstream, which soon rivalled South Brisbane in terms of shipping activity. An 1849 decision to locate Brisbane's first purpose-built Customs House at the northern end of the Town Reach acted as the impetus for the development of wharves on this part of the river. The Commissariat Store below William Street, which had served as Brisbane's first customs facility, was replaced in 1850 by a new customs building on the site of the present Customs House, Brisbane in Queen Street, at Petrie's Bight. (This in turn was replaced in 1886-89 by the current building.) During the 1850s and 1860s, a number of shipping companies and private investors constructed wharves and warehouses between the Customs House and Alice Street, near the City Botanic Gardens. Construction of a Government wharf (Kennedy Wharf) at Petrie's Bight north of the Customs House commenced in 1875 was completed in 1877 and was leased to private shipping firms. In 1880 the Brisbane Municipal Council acquired the wharf and immediately extended it northward. In 1884 the Council also constructed a wharf at the end of Boundary Street, and in the mid-1880s William Collin established his own wharf at Petrie's Bight, just downstream from the Council's Boundary Street wharf. Purchase of land from the Brisbane Gas Company in 1902 gave the Council control of the river frontage from the Customs House to Boundary Street, and between 1913 and 1916 the Council constructed reinforced concrete wharves between Macrossan and Boundary Streets, and between Kennedy Wharf and the Customs House. The whole of the Council's wharfage at Petrie's Bight was subsequently renamed Circular Quay Wharves. Between 1900 and 1912 Brisbane Wharves Ltd established wharves at Petrie's Bight from Boundary Street to Bowen Terrace, rivalling the Council's Circular Quay facilities in importance. Principal investors in the Brisbane Wharf Company were Howard Smith and William Collin and Sons. From the late 1890s, Howard Smith and Company Ltd occupied the Council's Boundary Street Wharf at Petrie's Bight and in the early years of the 20th century leased the adjacent new wharves constructed by Brisbane Wharves Limited at the base of the New Farm cliffs, below Bowen Terrace. These wharves were extended in the 1920s, and in the 1930s were resumed by the Queensland government for the construction of the Story Bridge. = Adelaide Street widening = In the early 20th century the roads to Petrie's Bight were improved significantly by the Brisbane City Council, providing an important impetus for the construction of new warehouses in the Upper Adelaide Street area. Under the provisions of the City of Brisbane Improvement Act 1916 and the Local Authorities Act Amendment Act 1923 the Brisbane City Council contributed significantly to the 1920s building boom, with a programme of city beautification and street improvements, including the cutting down and widening of several of the principal thoroughfares. The 1916 Act empowered the City Council, with the approval of the Governor-in-Council, to resume land simply by passing a resolution to the effect that resumption was necessary. Property rights on resumed lands were then converted into compensation rights. The 1923 Act further facilitated this process by exempting all improvements made to a property after resumption notices had been issued, from the payment of compensation. From 1923 to 1928 the Brisbane City Council implemented its most ambitious town improvement scheme to that date: the widening of Adelaide Street by along its entire length. Resumptions in Adelaide Street had commenced in the 1910s, but work on the street widening did not take place until the 1920s. The work was undertaken in stages, commencing in 1923 at the southern end where the new Brisbane City Hall was under construction. Some buildings had the front section removed and a contemporary facade installed on the new road alignment. Elsewhere, earlier buildings were demolished and substantial new structures took their place. At the northern end of Adelaide Street the cutting down of the hill below St John's Cathedral in 1928 facilitated greater access to Petrie Bight, which, close to new city wharves at the end of Boundary Street, boomed in the 1920s as a warehousing district. By 1921 Queensland was poised to resume the economic boom interrupted by the First World War (1914–18). In the period 1922-1928, Queensland experienced its first and last economic boom between the outbreak of war in 1914 and the 1950s. The benefits of the boom economy were reflected throughout the State, but nowhere more so than in Brisbane, with 29% of the Queensland population in December 1924. In physical terms the boom was expressed in a spate of building activity that transported the central business district of Brisbane into the 20th century, shedding its late Victorian image. The take-off in the building industry was evident during 1922-23, reflected in an active central business district real estate market, and prompting the Brisbane City Council to re-assess central city rateable values in 1923. By September 1925 property in Queen Street, the principal retail and financial street of Brisbane, could be acquired only at highly inflated prices, forcing investors into more peripheral locations such as Petrie's Bight. A fall in the price of building materials, combined with the trend in using concrete, a more economical product than brick, for large construction projects, further stimulated building activity. From 1922 the business of re-building Brisbane assumed impressive proportions. Between 1923 and 1925, an average of 50 new commercial buildings a year were being constructed in Brisbane, contrasting markedly with the 8 constructed twenty years earlier in 1903. During 1925 the value of contracts for buildings in Brisbane, either in course of erection or in contemplation, was reported at . The Greater Brisbane City Council meticulously monitored progress through its building approvals process, statistics for which were released monthly from October 1925 to an eager local press. Construction peaked in 1926 with worth of building works (new buildings, alterations and additions) approved in the Greater Brisbane area during the year. This included a substantial residential component. In 1927 the figure was around and in 1928 just over . = The motor car industry = In the 1910s the increasing availability of motor vehicles began to revolutionise public, private and commercial transport. In Brisbane, activities associated with horse transport began to convert to activities associated with motor transport, as coach and carriage builders became motor vehicle repairers or retailers, and livery stables became parking and service stations. In this way, the Austral Carriage Works, established around 1907 by Uhlmann and Lane at 51 Adelaide Street, Brisbane, entered the motor trade shortly after the First World War. Austral Motors Limited became the sole agents in Queensland and the Northern Rivers for Dodge Brothers, an American firm that had manufactured motor cars since 1914 and light trucks since 1917. They were successful and by 1924 had two branches, with the Austral Carriage & Motor Works at Stanley Street in South Brisbane, and Austral Motors Distributors at Boundary Street, Spring Hill. Queenslanders adopted motor vehicles with enthusiasm. Of the six Australian states, Queensland recorded the third largest number of motor vehicle registrations, 31,233, in 1923-24, behind New South Wales and Victoria. At the international level in 1923-24, Australia, with approximately 274,000 motor vehicle registrations, was fifth behind France (545,000), Canada (666,000), The United Kingdom (1,085,000), and the United States (15,400,000), and well ahead of Germany, in sixth place with 211,500 registrations. Through the daily press, Brisbanites were exposed to a barrage of advertising from the motor vehicle industry, with regular features on aspects of motors and motoring. To accommodate this explosion of public interest in, and acceptance of, the motor vehicle, the number of Brisbane motor engineers' agents, car manufacturers, car importers, and garages listed in the local postal directories increased from 89 in 1920-21, to 134 in 1924-25. This was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the number of motor vehicle accessory dealers, windscreen manufacturers, tyre dealers and motorcar body manufacturers. By September 1925, the Brisbane City Council was raising the problem of providing parking for motor vehicles in the inner city. Purpose-built privately operated parking stations began to appear in the central business district from the mid-1920s. Numerous small garages and service stations also provided motor vehicle parking and car hire. From the mid-1920s, Australia's premier building and architectural trade journal, the Sydney publication Building, had printed articles on designing public and commercial buildings to accommodate motor vehicles. Much of the journal's reference material came from the United States, which was leading the way in this type of design. Queensland architects had ready access to this and other architectural journals, and kept informed of the latest in international design developments. In 1923 Austral Motors Limited engaged Brisbane architects Lange Leopold Powell and George Gerald Hutton to design a showroom and service station at Petrie Bight. The land on which the Austral Motors building was constructed was part of two larger parcels of land first alienated from the Crown in 1852 and was surveyed and subdivided, together with the adjacent lane, in April 1923. The new road, Dodge Lane, was approved in May 1923 and is believed to have derived its name from the firm's Dodge agency. Tenders for construction were let in August 1923, the successful tenderer being Blair Cunningham. The first stage, on the corner of Dodge Lane, was completed in March 1924 at a projected cost of and occupied by Austral Motors Limited from 1 April 1924. The two-storeyed building was constructed largely of concrete and steel, with a floor space of approximately . Due to the slope of the land, both floors had street access. The Boundary Street level accommodated a motor vehicle show room. The upper level, accessed off Dodge Lane at the rear, was fitted out as the Dodge Brothers Service Station. In 1925 the firm undertook substantial extensions to their premises. George Hutton, who briefly occupied the position of Queensland Government Architect in 1922 prior to joining Powell in partnership in 1922, established his own practice in 1924, and called tenders for site excavations for Austral Motors Ltd in late 1924, the contract being let by January 1925. By April 1925 William Richard Juster's tender for additions and alterations to Austral Motors Ltd. had been accepted, but this appears not to have progressed, for by June 1925 Blair Cunningham's tender for the additions had been accepted. In July 1925 Austral Motors Ltd obtained Brisbane City Council approval for the construction, to cost . The location was an excellent choice for a business of this type, being close to the city's main wharves at Petrie Bight, and in a location favoured by other motor vehicle retailers and ancillary businesses. The Evers Motor Co. Ltd had established a garage/paint shop at the eastern corner of Ivory and Boundary streets as early as , and by 1920 HS Simpson, motor painter, was located next door to Evers. About 1926/27 Evers constructed a three-storeyed brick motor shed, offices and workshops at the corner of Boundary and Ivory streets, and a single-storeyed brick parking and filling station adjacent in Ivory Street, known as the Super Parking Station. As warehousing activity in Upper Adelaide Street expanding during the 1920s, many buildings were occupied by firms connected with the motor vehicle trade and industry and with car hire and garaging. In 1928, Collin House, a purpose- designed parking station and garage and a four-storey brick warehouse for the Dunlop Rubber Company of Australasia Pty Ltd were constructed in the vicinity. Tyre sales, automotive electricians and spare parts suppliers formed a substantial proportion of tenants in buildings in upper Adelaide Street during the 1920s and 1930s. In the second half of the 1920s Austral Motors expanded rapidly, due to the Queensland-wide economic boom that coincided with the increasing availability of and public interest in motor vehicles. By 1929 the company was operating from several addresses and two cities, with the Austral Carriage & Motor Works continuing at Stanley Street, South Brisbane; Austral Cars Ltd established at Adelaide Street, Brisbane; and Austral Motors Ltd located at Boundary St, Spring Hill and at Sturt Street, Townsville. In 1939 Austral Motors Pty Ltd acquired title to the allotment along the eastern boundary of the Company's mid-1920s acquisitions. In 1986 Austral Motors sold the property to the Sisters of Mercy in Queensland who own the adjacent All Hallows girls' school. It continues its connection with motor vehicles and is leased out as a parking station as well as being used to park vehicles of All Hallows staff.  Description  A two-storey red face brick former motor showroom and workshop, the former Austral Motors Building occupies land on the ridge formed by Boundary Street at the north end of Adelaide Street. The site is bounded by Boundary Street on the south, Dodge Lane on the west, and adjacent allotments on the east and north. Large fixed glass display windows (some now boarded up) in the Boundary Street shopfront take advantage of the approaching slope of Adelaide Street to feature the showroom to maximum effect. The building is also notable for the banks of windows that throw light into the showroom and workshop areas. Decorated with an applied white cement rendered panel with a dentilled cornice and a decorative central tablet, the parapet front to Boundary Street screens a double gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. Tucked within the base of the tablet, a narrow rectangular rainwater head and downpipes drain the central box gutter of the roof. Banks of large timber framed casement windows with fanlights run across the upper storey of the front elevation, lighting the front of the workshop/office area of the upper storey. This fenestration is enlivened with the inclusion of a number of decorative windows with a pattern of radiating lights. A cantilevered awning projects over the footpath to Boundary Street sheltering the showroom shopfronts. Two roller door entrances provide vehicle access from Boundary Street to the showrooms. The pedestrian entrance off Boundary Street is boarded up. The ground floor accommodates two spacious showrooms with high ceilings clad in fibrous cement panelling with timber cover strips, which are stained dark to provide a decorative contrast in the western section. The ceiling is supported by steel posts and beams clad with timber sheeting and embellished with decorative timber mouldings. The showroom to the west side is floored towards the front with red brown terrazzo, presumably to display cars to the best advantage. This area is notable for a pair of steel lattice trusses, which support the concrete floor above, and has stairs to the upper storey that are no longer in use. Windows to the south, east and west light the upper storey, which also has a battened ceiling, though the central section is missing. This workshop level has two large entrances to each side of the building. The floor is concrete to the part of the workshop accessed by the west entrance; the balance of the floor is timber. The east opening accommodates a pair of substantial timber sliding doors. This level has offices and toilets and an enquiry counter near the rear entrance that opens on to a yard accessed from Antrim Street and Dodge Lane. The red face brick double gable parapet of the rear elevation screens the two gable roofs behind. An open lean-to-roof shelter projects out from north end of the building. The Dodge Lane elevation in red face brick houses banks of timber framed casement windows with fanlights to both storeys. A solid timber sliding door to the middle of the elevation provides entry to the showroom level and access to the timber stair to the upper storey. A narrow rectangular fixed glass window is to the north side of this entrance. Lintels and sills are distinguished in rendered cement.  Heritage listing  The former Austral Motors Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 April 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Austral Motors Building, erected in two stages 1923–25 as a purpose-designed motor vehicle show room and service depot, is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, in particular the Queensland-wide economic boom of the 1920s which transformed the appearance of the Brisbane central business district. During this period roads were straightened, widened and levelled; motorised vehicles congested inner city roads; the 19th century building stock was replaced by substantial brick or concrete commercial premises, many of which were designed around the motor car, such as parking stations and garages and motor show rooms; and most of the vacant land in the city centre was rapidly improved with substantial new brick buildings. At this period the Upper Adelaide Street district at Petrie Bight was developed as an important warehousing precinct, the development being facilitated by early 20th century initiatives of the Brisbane City Council, which included: constructing a formal wide road network, graded for motorised vehicular transport; encouraging the establishment of service lanes and alleys to allow for pedestrian and vehicle access to commercial buildings; and providing extensive new wharfage nearby at Circular Quay. In particular, the former Austral Motors Building is important in illustrating the strong association of the Petrie Bight district with the early expansion of the motor vehicle trade in Queensland. Most of the warehouses in the area accommodated tenants or owners associated with the motor vehicle trade (including distribution, repairs and the provision of parts) or with motor vehicle servicing and parking. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Austral Motors Building is important as an early, rare surviving and remarkably intact purpose-designed mid-1920s motor show room and service station. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Austral Motors Building (1923–25) remains highly intact and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a large, state- of-the-art motor vehicle show room of the interwar period. Its role as a sales and service facility is demonstrated by the spacious show rooms and the garaging facility at the rear for the servicing and maintenance of motor vehicles. The place is important in illustrating the commercial work of leading Brisbane architects of the interwar period, Lange Powell and George Hutton, expressing the commercial priorities of the time.

Mowshowitz was trained in pure biochemistry and has done research in RNA processing. In her early work she focused on pedagogy and biology education. Education Mowshowitz was awarded a BA from Brandeis University and entered the Sue Golding Graduate Division of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. At Albert Einstein, Mowshowitz studied biochemistry under James E. Darnell and received her PhD in 1969 for a thesis entitled \\"tRNA synthesis in HeLa cells\\". Research Mowshowitz was Darnell's first graduate student at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. As Darnell's student, Mowshowitz worked on RNA processing; up until that point, it had been thought that preprocessing was limited to pre-rRNA, but Mowshowitz demonstrated the existence of pre-tRNAs as well. Mowshowitz used gel electrophoresis to separate smaller, slower-migrating pre-tRNA candidate particles which had been labeled with radioactive uridine. She observed the pre-tRNAs under methionine-starvation conditions and proposed that the pre- tRNAs were longer than tRNAs proper. Early work by Mowshowitz focused on pure biochemistry, in areas such as enzyme assays and biosynthesis in yeast. She has also published in the Journal of Virology and in Analytical Biochemistry. Teaching Mowshowitz joined the faculty at Columbia when Darnell, her thesis adviser at AECOM, was appointed to a professorship at Columbia and informed her of an open faculty position. While Mowshowitz is trained in research, she decided to focus on teaching after joining the Columbia faculty, and sought to focus on the areas of pedagogy and biology education in particular. Mowshowitz personally controls the introductory biology sequence at Columbia, and lectures on occasion. She also oversees the biology department at Columbia as Director of Undergraduate Programs and Lab Operations. Mowshowitz believes in a problem-based learning approach to teaching biology, emphasizing applying deeper principles over rote memorization of pathways and structures. She has stated that she assigns students advanced problems based on famous historical experiments in her introductory classes in order to encourage them to synthesize knowledge to solve problems. Her introductory biology course is available as massive open online course. She received the Presidential Outstanding Teaching Award in 1999.

Cochran (born January 23, 1960) is an author, public speaker, former Administrator of the United States Fire Administration, and former Fire Chief of Atlanta Fire Department. He was fired from the Atlanta fire department after he wrote a book for members of his church expressing biblical views on sexuality, adultery, and homosexuality. Early life Cochran was first hired by Shreveport Fire Department in 1981 serving as a trainer and assistant fire chief. Mayor Keith Hightower later appointed him the first African-American fire chief of Shreveport, Louisiana August 26, 1999. He helped the New Orleans Fire Department in 2005 in response to Hurricane Katrina and went on to serve positions in the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) from 2006 to 2007. He worked under mayor Kasim Reed starting January 2, 2008 for Atlanta Fire Department, prior to being appointed US Fire Administrator in July 2009 by President Barack Obama where he worked extensively with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the United States Department of Homeland Security to prevent fires and improve fire response. He maintained this role until returning to Atlanta on May 8, 2010 and being re-appointed as Fire Chief of Atlanta Fire Department August 16, 2010. Suspension and firing Cochran was suspended for 30 days without pay starting November 24, 2014 for distributing to employees a book he had written, Who Told You That You Were Naked?, which expressed Cochran's religious views which included calling homosexuality and lesbianism a perversion and which mayor Kasim Reed considered to be discriminatory against LGBT people. On January 6, 2015, after returning from the suspension, he was informed that he would have to resign or be terminated. A rally was held in Atlanta on January 13 in support of Cochran, with various leaders of faith attending including Bishop Wellington Boone, president of the Fellowship of International Churches. Deputy Chief Joel Baker has replaced Cochran as the active fire chief of Atlanta Fire Department. On February 18, 2015, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of Cochran by the public interest law organization Alliance Defending Freedom on grounds of \\"religious discrimination\\" against the City of Atlanta. The case, Cochran v. City of Atlanta, was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division. A petition on March 25 for the case to be dismissed was denied. On October 14, May said she would soon issue her ruling. On December 16, 2015, Judge May ruled that the lawsuit could proceed. $1.2 million payout by City of Atlanta On December 20, 2017, United States District Court Judge Leigh Martin May upheld his firing and also ruled that as an \\"at-will\\" employee, his firing was legal. However, the judge noted that \\"rules cited in Cochran’s dismissal that require city employees to get pre- clearance for outside employment could stifle speech unconstitutionally and also failed to define the standards to be used when judging a potential conflict of interest.\\" Furthermore, the City \\"conducted an extensive review of the facts and the law and concluded that the cost of continuing to defend against the lawsuit would far exceed the cost to settle. The $1.2 million includes a settlement and attorneys’ fees.\\" Bibliography * Who Told You That You Were Naked?

The single-span Burr Arch covered bridge structure was built by the Adams Construction in 1907 and destroyed by flood in 1969. History Philip Adams, who was an Ohio veteran of the War of 1812, purchased 80 acres of land in Parke County in 1835. His son, Harvey Adams, continued to farm and by 1893 had acquired 2300 acres in Parke County. By 1959 Roy Adams still owned over 1500 acres and as late as 1990 Adams Farms Inc. owned the same acreage. The bridge was built on land owned by the Adams Family. The bridge got its \\"Ray's Bridge\\" name from the fact that the crossing had earlier been called Ray's Ford from the grist mill that Mr. Ray owned upstream from the ford. Even though the Adams Construction was awarded the contract to build the bridge apparently they subcontracted the Frankfort Construction Company to actually build it. J.P. Van Fossen, in turn, was the onsite forman for the project. After the bridge was destroyed in 1969 the Jessup Covered Bridge was moved to replace it. This bridge was also destroyed by a flood in 1989 when it washed downstream under the State Sanitorium Covered Bridge and then over the U.S. 36 concrete bridge at the Plank Road Covered Bridge site.

Revolt Modern artist impression of rebel leader Tula Bandabou had between 4,000 and 5,000 inhabitants in 1795, mostly enslaved. The slave Tula had been preparing the insurrection for some weeks. On the morning of August 17, 1795, at the Knip plantation of slave master Caspar Lodewijk van Utrecht at Bandabou, Curaçao, Tula led an uprising of 40 to 50 people. The enslaved met on the square of the plantation and informed van Utrecht they would no longer be his slaves. He told them to present their complaints to the lieutenant governor at Fort Amsterdam. They left and went from Knip to Lagun, where they freed 22 slaves from jail. From Lagun, the liberators went to the sugar plantation of Santa Cruz (Sacred Cross), where they were joined by more rebels under Bastian Karpata. Tula then led the liberated people from farm to farm, freeing more people. The slave owners had now retreated to the city, leaving their plantations unprotected. At the same time, a confederate French slave, Louis Mercier, led another group of freed slaves to Santa Cruz, where he took the commandant, van der Grijp, and ten of his mixed race soldiers as prisoners. Mercier also attacked Knip, where he freed more slaves and took some weapons. He then rejoined Tula, locating him by following the trail of destruction Tula had left behind. Response Modern artist impression of the victory of the slaves at Portomari Van Uytrecht in the meantime had sent his son on horseback with a note to the governor, and at 7 p.m., the council met to prepare a defense of the colony. Governor Johannes de Veer ordered Commander Wierts of the navy ship Medea, which was in port at the time, to defend Fort Amsterdam. Sixty- seven men, both white and black, under the command of Lieutenant R.G. Plegher were sent against the rebels. They went by boat to Boca San Michiel from Willemstad, and from there on foot to Portomari, where Tula and his followers were camping. When the Dutch military arrived there on August 19, they attacked Tula's group, but were defeated. At the plantation of Fontein, Pedro Wakao killed the Dutch slaver, Sabel, who became the first white victim of the rebellion. Wakao also found more weapons at Fontein. The governor was notified of Plegher's defeat, and the rebellion was now considered a serious threat to the white community. The governor and the slavers had raised a force of 60 well-armed horsemen under the command of Captain Baron van Westerholt to renew the attack. Westerholt had orders to offer leniency to the rebels if they would surrender. Among this party was Jacobus Schink, a Franciscan priest who served as negotiator and attempted to prevent bloodshed. Tula was aware of the revolution that had resulted in freedom for the enslaved in Haiti. Tula argued that, since the Netherlands were now captured by the French, they should get their freedom as well. The three demands of Tula were: an end to collective punishment, an end to labor on Sunday, and the freedom to buy clothes and goods from others than their own masters. There were two attempts at negotiating with the enslaved. The first one was carried out by Father Schink. When Father Schink spoke with Tula, he refused to accept anything less than freedom. Schink reported back to Baron Westerholt, and the latter decided to get more reinforcements and attack. He attempted a last negotiation, but when he was turned down by the rebels, he ordered that any slave with a weapon be shot. In the ensuing fight, the rebels were defeated. Ten to twenty of them were killed, and the rest escaped. Consequences Modern artist impression of the execution of Tula The rebels began a guerrilla campaign, poisoning wells and stealing food. On September 19, Tula and Karpata were betrayed by a slave. They were taken prisoner, and the war was effectively over. (Louis Mercier had already been caught at Knip.) After Tula was captured, he was publicly tortured to death on October 3, 1795, almost seven weeks after the revolt began. Karpata, Louis Mercier and Pedro Wakao were also executed. In addition, many slaves had been massacred in the earlier repression. After the revolt had been crushed the white Curaçao government formulated rules that provided some rights to slaves on the island. Legacy Statue commemorating the start of the revolt against slavery At the height of the insurrection, there were probably 1,000 rebels. August 17 is celebrated in Curaçao to commemorate the beginning of the liberation struggle. When the race based system of slavery was finally abolished on the island in 1863, there were approximately 5500 slaves. There is a monument to Tula and the rebels on the south coast of Curaçao, near the Corendon Mangrove Beach Resort. This is the site where Tula was executed. The Tula Museum was named after the rebel leader. The revolt was dramatized in the 2013 Dutch film Tula: The Revolt, directed by Jeroen Leinders and starring Obi Abili as Tula alongside Jeroen Krabbé and Danny Glover.Tula The Revolt .

In 624/1227, Alauddin Muhammad took the power upon the death of his mother at the age of 15 or 16 years and dealt iron-handed with the persons misusing the powers. Most of them turned against him and went to live in Qazvin. In order to cover the story of their defalcations, they started to spread rumors against the Imam in bitter sarcasm. Some of them went on to propagate that the brain of Alauddin Muhammad had been affected a few months before 624/1227 when a physician operated him, causing waste of excess blood. The oppositions were however surmounted very soon. Under Muhammad III's reign, the Sunni conformity initiated by his father was gradually and quietly reversed and his community increasingly regarded itself openly as Ismaili Shi'ite. His rule was described as \\"cruel, imperious, sadistic, alcoholic, and unpredictable.\\" The Mongol invasions of Nizari strongholds in Quhistan in 1253 and the imminent arrival of Hülegü's army in 1255 incited internal conflicts upon Nizaris. The relationship of Muhammad, who had reportedly been afflicted by melancholia and mental deterioration, was deteriorated with his advisors and Nizari leaders, as well as his son Rukn al-Din Khurshah, who was supposed to be the future Imam. According to Persian historians, the Nizari elites prepared a plan against Muhammad to replace him with Khurshah, who would then enter into immediate negotiations with the Mongols; however, Khurshah fell ill before implementing this plan. Soon afterward, on 1 December 1255, Muhammad was murdered in suspicious circumstances in Shirkuh near Alamut and was succeeded by Khurshah. The murderer was later found to be Muhammad's companion Hasan Mazandarani, as revealed by his wife. Mazandarani and three of his children were later executed by Khurshah, as retribution.

It was released in 1954 and starring Ninón Sevilla and Pedro Armendáriz. Plot In the Havana port, two mulatto children, Mateo (Ricardo Román) and Caridad (Ninón Sevilla) grow together. She is the daughter of a white man who died in a shipwreck, and a black laundress of African origin. Over the years, Mateo falls for Caridad, but she is in love with a Mexican captain, Martin (Pedro Armendáriz), who accidentally met her at the port. The captain was also in love with Caridad and offers to live together and she accepts. Caridad work in a cabaret in the port and the owner, Guevara (René Cardona), is attracted to the girl, and in a moment of jealousy, tries to kill Martin. Martin falls in financial trouble and have to mortgage his boat to Guevara. When Martin returns to Veracruz, Mexico, Guevara feels himself like the new owner of Caridad. Cast * Ninón Sevilla ... Caridad * Pedro Armendáriz ... Captain Martín * René Cardona ... Guevara * Ricardo Román ... Mateo * Fanny Schiller ... Doña Rosario * Ramón Valdés ... \\"Marinero\\" (uncredited) Reviews Mulata is not one of the classic melodramas of Ninón Sevilla. The film does not contain the extravagant elements that make the indisputable classics Victimas del Pecado, Aventurera and Sensualidad; does not have the spectacular musical numbers in large series and complex choreography, which are found in almost all her films; and contains not humor like in Club de señoritas. But somehow Mulata is probably the film that is closer to the cultural roots of Sevilla, ethnic and social concerns and the varied and different forms of love that made her life so rich. Adapted from Mulatilla: Black Stamp, a novel by the Uruguayan writer Roberto Márquez Olivencia, the action takes place now in Cuba and tells the story of Caridad (a name that echoes the name of the Virgin patron of the island), the beautiful daughter a black slave who has to fight against those who exploit high positions, and men who only want her as a sexual object. Her life was marked by tragedy and she will be physically abused, betrayed and forced into prostitution. The story is told in flashback, from the memories of the Mexican sailor. The character is played of brutal way by the actor Pedro Armendariz. There is a long sequence on the beach that covers a celebration of a ritual dance of Santeria, the Yoruba religion shown by Ninon as important in her films as Victimas del Pecado and Yambaó. By 1954, the sequence is a strange and audacious mix of ethnography and sensationalism.Review of Mulata por Edgar Soberán Torchía in IMdB The film shows a sequence where several dancers resembling be naked during a ritual. In this regard, Ninon Sevilla revealed: Pedro Armendáriz had just returned from France, where he filmed \\"Lucrece Borgia\\" and counted me that in a scene rubbed a bunch of grapes on the breasts of an actress who was lying on a table and that down there was an actor who drank the juice of the grapes. And that only they could happen to the French. Mmmm I said, in this movie are going to show to the French that here in Mexico too there is imagination. I sent for a bag of black nylon panties in every sizes. On the beach scene did you put to all the dancers, so when lifted their legs, it seemed that they did not bring anything. This goes for the French.

A 2007 recipient of Padma Shri, he was honoured again by the Government of India in 2015 with Padma Bhushan, the third highest Indian civilian award. Biography Internationally recognized for his path-breaking work in the fields of Geology and Environmental Science, Prof. Valdiya was born to Dev Singh Valdiya and Nanda Valdiya on 20 March 1937 in Myanmar. In 1947 his family returned to their hometown in Pithoragarh in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. After schooling in Pithoragarh, he did his bachelor (BSc), masters (MSc) and doctoral (PhD) studies at Lucknow University and joined the university as a member of faculty in 1957. A 1965–66 Fulbright scholar at Johns Hopkins University, he had also taught at Rajasthan University, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR) and Kumaon University. He was the vice chancellor of Kumaon University in 1981. Valdiya had been involved with the establishment of such geological institutions as Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Central Himalayan Environmental Association, Nainital, G. B. Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development, Almora, and the Geology Department of the Kumaon University. He is an elected fellow of Indian National Science Academy, National Academy of Sciences, India (FNASc), Indian Academy of Sciences (FASc), and the Third World Academy of Sciences (FTWAS) and is a fellow of Geological Society of India, Geological Society of America and Geological Society of Nepal. He had served as a member of the Scientific Advisory Council to the Prime Minister of India. He has written over 110 research papers, authored 22 books, edited 9 books and penned 40 articles in Hindi towards popularization of science. Field of Specialization Tectonics with special reference to active faults. Environmental Geology with special reference to natural hazards and geo-hydrology of springs. Key Contributions Geology He has made significant contributions to Himalayan Geology through a sustained and comprehensive study of the Kumaon Himalayas. These include pioneering studies of cyano-bacterial stromatolites leading to fixing of age of crucial stratigraphic horizons; systematic investigations of economically rich magnesite deposits; sedimentological and palaeocurrent study of the Precambrian flysch leading to reconstruction of palaeogeography of northern India; and the structural study of geodynamically sensitive areas leading to the tectonic synthesis and evolutionary history of the Himalayas. Departing from mainstream thinking and pursuing independent lines, K.S. Valdiya has contributed to Himalayan Geology through a sustained and comprehensive study of the Uttarakhand Himalayas. His internationally recognized works are based on the painstaking mapping of mountainous terrain, traversing thousands of kilometers on foot. This body of work has made the Uttarakhand Himalayas one of the best documented, most thoroughly studied sectors of the Himalayan Mountain Arc. He has provided highly original scientific insights to the quintessential Continental Collision on the basis of his study of the dome-shaped Crustal upwarps in the immediate proximity of the zone of collision of India with Asia. His recent work has focused on active faults and land-form development — landscape reshaping related to neo- tectonism. In addition, his studies on natural hazards like mass-movements and hydro-geology of mountain springs having great bearing on management of environment and planning for the ecological integrity of the mountains. Environment & Social Development His well-researched scientific report on the destabilizing effect of limestone quarrying formed the principal basis of the Supreme Court banning limestone mining in the Mussourie Hills. In a pioneering and benchmark study on declining discharges of mountain springs, he developed the concept and methodology of spring sanctuary and demonstrated its workability by successfully augmenting the spring discharge in a catchment area of a multidisciplinary 10-year project on sustainable development. (The programme of spring sanctuary has been adopted in many areas in Uttarakhand). Deeply an intimately involved in ecodevelopment through people’s participation such as the development of spring sanctuaries, afforestation in village panchayat lands, linkages of animal husbandry, horticulture and agriculture in 7 villages in Kumaun under the aegis of an NGO (Central Himalayan Environment Association) Organization Development KS Valdiya was intimately involved in the conceptualization, establishment and development of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (now at Dehradun), the Central Himalayan Environment Association (Nainital), the G.B. Pant Institute of Himalayan Environment and Development (Katarmal, Almora), and the Department of Geology in Kumaun University (Nainital). Popularization of Science For the last few years, KS Valdiya has been working on a Science Outreach Programme to popularize Science among young students, in the remote regions of Uttarakhand. Along with leading teachers and specialists from various disciplines, he has been delivering and organizing lectures on the application of science, the avenues & opportunities for young minds, as well as offering career guidance to pre-university college students. Books He has written over 110 research papers, authored over 20 books, edited 9 books and penned 40 articles in Hindi towards popularization of science. These include Geology of Kumaon Lesser Himalaya (1980), Aspects of Tectonics: Focus on South-central Asia (1984), Environmental Geology: Indian Context (1987), Dynamic Himalaya (1998), Saraswati, the River That Disappeared (2002), Geology, Environment and Society (2005), The Making of India: Geodynamic Evolution (2010), and Ek Thi Nadi Saraswati (2010, in Hindi). His autobiography \\"पथरीली पगडंडियों पर\\" was published by PAHAR PAHAR(People's association for Himalaya Area Research) in 2015.

The plot follows an aspiring model in Los Angeles whose beauty and youth generate intense fascination and jealousy within the industry. Supporting roles are played by Karl Glusman, Jena Malone, Bella Heathcote, Abbey Lee, Desmond Harrington, Christina Hendricks, and Keanu Reeves. An international co-production between France, Denmark, and the United States, the film competed for the Palme d'Or at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, the third consecutive film directed by Refn to do so, following Drive (2011) and Only God Forgives (2013). In the United States, the film was released theatrically on June 24, 2016 by Amazon Studios and Broad Green Pictures. It opened to polarized reviews, and ultimately grossed a little over $3 million against a $7 million budget. Plot Following the death of her parents, sixteen-year-old aspiring model Jesse has just moved from small-town Georgia to Los Angeles. She meets photographer Dean, who does her first shoot, and makeup artist Ruby, who introduces fellow older models Sarah and Gigi. The three women are intrigued by Jesse's natural beauty and curious about her sexual proclivities. Jesse feigns experience in the latter. Jesse is signed by Roberta Hoffman, the owner of a modeling agency, who tells her to pretend she is nineteen and refers her to a test shoot with notable photographer Jack McCarther. The shoot is successful, and Gigi and Sarah envy Jesse's youth. Jesse goes to a casting call for fashion designer Robert Sarno, where Sarah is also present. He pays no attention to Sarah but is entranced by Jesse. A distraught Sarah asks her how it feels to be the one everyone admires. Jesse admits, \\"It's everything.\\" Sarah lunges toward her, and Jesse accidentally cuts her hand on glass. Sarah sucks the blood from Jesse's hand. Jesse rushes back to her motel and faints, hallucinating strange images. At Sarno's fashion show, Gigi tells Jesse about the cosmetic surgery she has had done. As Jesse is closing the show, she sees a vision of the glowing triangle she hallucinated before. After the show, a visibly-changed Jesse goes out with Dean to a bar. There, Sarno denigrates women who have cosmetic surgery, using a humiliated Gigi as an example. In contrast, he praises Jesse's natural looks. Dean challenges Sarno's view and tries to convince Jesse to leave, but she rejects him, now displaying a new narcissistic persona. Jesse has a nightmare of being forced by Hank, the lecherous motel owner, to sexually swallow a knife. She wakes up to hear someone fidgeting with her door lock. She quickly turns the deadbolt, but is left to listen as the intruder breaks into the next room and assaults the female occupant. Terrified, she calls Ruby, who tells her to come over. Ruby tries to initiate sex with her, but Jesse rejects her, revealing herself to be a virgin. Ruby draws a lipstick face symbol on Jesse's mirror, and leaves for her second job as a makeup artist at a morgue, where she pleasures herself with a female corpse. Ruby returns home and finds Jesse now unabashed in her narcissism. Sarah and Gigi arrive and attack Jesse. Ruby pushes her into an empty swimming pool, breaking her leg. The women then approach her with knives. After they butcher Jesse and consume parts of her body, they all bathe in her blood. Ruby is revealed to have occult tattoos. She lies in Jesse's unmarked grave, and later, nude in her house as a torrent of blood gushes from her genitals. The next day, Sarah and Gigi attend one of Jack's shoots with another model named Annie. Jack is suddenly enthralled with Sarah and fires Annie. In the midst of the shoot, Gigi feels ill and leaves. Sarah watches Gigi vomit up one of Jesse's eyeballs. She screams with regret, \\"I need to get her out of me\\", and stabs herself with a pair of scissors. Sarah watches Gigi die, eats the regurgitated eyeball, and returns to the shoot. The end credits scene shows a woman, who does not show her face but looks like Sarah, walking alone in the Mojave Desert. Cast Production Director Nicolas Winding Refn promoting the film at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. On November 3, 2014, Refn's production company Space Rocket Nation alongside its co-financiers Gaumont Film Company and Wild Bunch announced that Refn's next film would be titled The Neon Demon, to be filmed in Los Angeles in early 2015. Refn commented on the conception of the project: \\"I woke up one morning a couple of years ago and was like, ‘Well, I was never born beautiful, but my wife is,’ and I wondered what it had been like going through life with that reality,” he says. “I came up with the idea to do a horror film about beauty, not to criticize it or to attack it, but because beauty is a very complex subject. Everyone has an opinion about it.\\" In January 2015, Dazed reported that the script for the film was inspired by Elizabeth Báthory. In discussing the script, which Refn co-wrote with Mary Laws, he stated: \\"I decided that I’d made enough films about violent men, and I wanted to do a film with only women in the film, and so I did this story because my wife would only go to L.A. if we had to travel out of Copenhagen. She’s like, ‘I’m done with Asia. I will only do Los Angeles.’ And so I came up with an idea and went to L.A., and I cast this woman called Elle Fanning who is absolutely fantastic, and she played the lead.\\" In subsequent interviews, Refn stated that he visualized the film as an \\"adult fairy tale.\\" =Casting= Star Elle Fanning at the Cannes Film Festival. On January 6, 2015, Elle Fanning joined the film to play an aspiring model, caught in a world of beauty and demise. Fanning came to Refn's attention because of his wife, who had been impressed by her performance in an earlier film. On January 29, Abbey Lee was added to the cast to play the role of Sarah. On February 5, more cast was added to the film, including Keanu Reeves, Christina Hendricks, Jena Malone and Bella Heathcote. On March 17, 2015, Karl Glusman was set to star in the film. Desmond Harrington was added to the cast on March 30, 2015. = Filming = Principal photography on the film began in Los Angeles on March 30, 2015. Locations included downtown Los Angeles, while the motel sequences were shot on location at a real motel in Pasadena. =Soundtrack= Composer Cliff Martinez, who collaborated with director Refn on Drive, stated the films have similar styles, musically speaking, noting that for The Neon Demon he sought a \\"sparse electronic score.\\" He stated in an interview that the first half of the film resembles \\"a melodrama like Valley of the Dolls, and the second half is like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.\\" According to Refn and Martinez the soundtrack was influenced by Giorgio Moroder, Goblin, Kraftwerk, Vangelis and Tangerine Dream. The soundtrack for the film was released on June 24, 2016, physically and through digital download, before being released on vinyl on July 8, 2016, by Milan Records. Sia composed an original song for the film titled \\"Waving Goodbye\\". On May 24, 2016 at the Cannes Soundtrack 2016 awards, Cliff Martinez was recognized best composer of the Cannes film festival for his soundtrack to The Neon Demon. Refn's nephew (and actress Brigitte Nielsen's son) Julian Winding contributed two tracks: \\"Demon Dance\\" and \\"Mine\\", the latter performed by his band Sweet Tempest.  Release  In November 2015, Amazon Studios acquired distribution rights to the film in the United States, in partnership with Broad Green Pictures. The Jokers distributed the film in France. Scanbox Entertainment distributed the film in Denmark. The film had its world premiere at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival on May 20, 2016, before it was released in France on June 8, 2016. The film was then released in Denmark on June 9, followed by the United States on June 24, 2016. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 27, 2016. Critical response The Neon Demon received a mixed response from critics. Much like Refn's previous film, Only God Forgives, the film received both boos and a standing ovation during its premiere at Cannes Film Festival. It holds a 59% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 253 reviews, with an average rating of 5.88/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"The Neon Demon is seductively stylish, but Nicolas Winding Refn's assured eye can't quite compensate for an underdeveloped plot and thinly written characters.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 51 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film five out of five stars, stating, \\"When the film reaches its logical end point, Refn just keeps pushing, and eventually lands on a sequence so jaw-dropping – almost certainly a sly, glossy-magazine refashioning of Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dali's groundbreaking surrealist short Un Chien Andalou – that all you can do is howl or cheer.\\" Tirdad Derakhshani, writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, called Refn a \\"bold visionary artist... able to revel in the culture of instant gratification while also subjecting it to critique\\", giving the film three and a half out of four stars and calling it a \\"brutal masterpiece\\". Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald wrote positively of the film's visuals and experimental filmmaking, writing, \\"To complain that The Neon Demon lacks substance or that it doesn't have anything to say about our cultural obsession with beauty is to miss the crazy, cracked pageant unfolding in front of you. Not all movies are intended to be read like books; some are meant to be experienced,\\" going on to call it a \\"film that is guaranteed to elicit strong reactions.\\" He awarded the film three out of four stars. Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a mixed review: \\"A horror film is what The Neon Demon is (sort of). It’s set in the Los Angeles fashion world, and it’s the kind of movie in which models look like mannequins that look like slasher-film corpses, and corpses look like love objects. Beauty mingles with mangled flesh, and each fastidiously slick image seems to have come out of Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me or The Shining or a very sick version of a Calvin Klein commercial. Every scene, every shot, every line of dialogue, every pause is so hypnotically composed, so luxuriously overdeliberate, that the audience can't help but assume that Refn knows exactly what he's doing – that he's setting us up for the kill. He is, but not if you're on the lookout for a movie that makes sense. (Oh, that.)\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review and called it \\"[a] stultifyingly vapid, ponderously paced allegorical critique of the modeling world whose seethingly jealous inhabitants can't wait to literally chew each other up and spit each other out\\". Glenn Kenny of The New York Times criticized the film as \\"ridiculous and puerile,\\" and opined, \\"Mr. Refn composes striking images, but they're all secondhand: faux Fellini, faux David Lynch and so on.\\" The Telegraphs Tim Robey deemed The Neon Demon the \\"most offensive film of the year,\\" specifically citing its necrophilia sequence as exploitative, though he conceded it is not \\"any fault of Malone’s, who commits herself utterly to making it an anguished, desperate, if inevitably revolting minute or so of screen time. It’s a question of context, and how this scene – which stands alone, advancing nothing in the overall arc of the story, and is one of very few not to feature Fanning – slots into the film’s overall thesis.\\" The French film magazine Cahiers du cinéma named The Neon Demon the third-best film of 2016.

History  The Walker sisters hail from Palmer, Alaska, where they formed a family band with their three brothers and their parents, which they voted to call \\"Redhead Express\\" because most of them are redheads. In 2007, motivated by their love of music, the Walkers decided to sell their belongings, purchase an RV, a trailer, and travel across the contiguous United States to perform. Since then, the Walker family has done hundreds of shows during their tours, including at state and county fairs, and festivals. Gradually, the four sisters became the stars of the group, with their parents taking managerial positions, and their brothers formed a band called the Walker Brothers.  Career  The Redhead Express performing at Chasco Fiesta in March 2015 In 2010, the Redhead Express sought out Grammy-winning record producer Paul Worley, who agreed to work with them, spending four years supervising their artistic development, and is now producing their first country album. In June 2014, the Redhead Express appeared live on a WCYB-TV newscast, as well as on WSMV-TV, to play one of their songs. Other TV channels that have featured the band include Iowa Public Television and a live interview on KCWI-TV's Great Day morning news show. In February 2015, the quartet performed at the Lincoln Theatre in Marion, Virginia, for the Song of the Mountains concert series, which is broadcast on over 190 public television channels in the United States; it was their third appearance on that show. The feature-length film Moose - The Movie, released in 2015, includes some of the Redhead Express' songs in the soundtrack.

The origin of the songs recorded in Perast manuscript is not the end of the 17th century because they must have had long development before they were recorded. The Perast manuscript contains eight bugarštica songs and one drama. The topic of four bugarštica and drama is the Battle of Kosovo, while others tell other historical events, like of Bajo Pivljanin. The oral folk poetry was very popular in Kotor bay and during the 18th century, people began recording them. Some of their manuscripts survived until modern days, many of unknown authorship. Therefore, besides the Perast manuscript known as Balovićs manuscript, many other 18th century manuscripts written in Perast survived until modern-days, most notable of them being manuscript written in 1775. This manuscript is known as Mazarović's manuscript. It does not contain bugarštica but ten-syllable verse songs which are other versions of bugarštica songs from the earlier manuscript.  Authorship  The scholars disagree about the origin and chronology of songs found in the Perast manuscript. Its original has not been preserved. The manuscript was found by Srećko Vulović in the house of a noble Perast family Smecchia. Since the manuscript did not have the cover page with the name of author or authors of its text, they remained unknown. According to Maja Bošković-Stulli, the manuscript which contains bugarštica songs was found in the house of Balović, while the manuscript with ten-syllable verse songs was found in the house of Mazarović family. Vulović speculated that the author of the play about the Battle of Kosovo was Serbian primate and archbishop Andrija Zmajević or probably Nikola Burović who authored larger part of the manuscript and this hypothesis was accepted by many other authors. Some authors insist that manuscript belongs to unknown collector rejecting the possibility that it was Zmajević. According to analysis of the handwriting performed by Gracija Brajković, the author of manuscript was Nikola Burović. The manuscript written by Mazarović has the year of its creation, 1775, written on it. According to Svetozar Koljević, the person who wrote the manuscript with bugarštica. Koljević also emphasize that none of the songs from the 1775 manuscript with ten-syllable verse songs are bugarštica. The 1775 manuscript was written in Latin script with most of its songs being versions of bugarštica found in earlier Perast manuscript Still, Valtazar Bogišić believed that Mazarović did not record ten-syllable verse songs on the basis of bugarštica songs from an earlier manuscript, but in some other, possibly even older, manuscript. Mazarović certainly has not authored or recorded from oral poetry any of the songs he recorded in 1775 manuscript. He only transcribed them from already existing records.  Content  In this manuscript from Boka Kotorska eight songs are presented in two versions: like bugarštica and in ten-syllable verse. One bugarštica is very similar to drama.: \\"У перашком рукопису с краја XVII века налази се и бугарштица која је врло слична драми.\\" Four bugaršticas are about Battle of Kosovo. One bugarštica which is similar to drama and another which more resembles the song, describe Miloš Obilić both referring to his last name as Koviljić.:\\" Перашка бугарштица има много заједничког и са драмом, са којом се налази и у истом рукопису, и са рукописном Причом. Милош је Ковиљић и у драми и у песми, оба дела почшьу са причом о свађи Лазаревих кпери па зетова, ...\\" The similar mistake about the year of the Battle of Kosovo led to conclusion that they are linked to each other. In drama and one bugarštica song, Miloš Obilić was described as stepping onto sultan's neck. One bugarštica describes ill fate of Nikola of Perast who was accused by some girl from Paštrovići for raping her, so twelve armed men from Paštrovići killed him before all of them were killed to. Another bugarštica describes the pirate attack on Perast galley near Durazzo. One bugarštica describes clash between the citizens of Perast with the Ottomans from Risan trying to capture women from Perast. The Perast manuscript contains three songs about Bajo Pivljanin which are actually old motives applied on Bajo and Perast.: \\"Три песме о Бају Пивљанину у Мазаровићевом перашком рукопису представљају у ствари „варијанте старинских мотива адаптиране на Баја и Пераст\\"\\" Nobody have ever published all of the songs from Balović version of the Perast manuscript. Only 9 bugarštica were published. = Play about the Battle of Kosovo = This play does not have short title, but rather long one: “Here begins the battle of Prince Lazar and the evil purpose of Miloš Kobilić and of the traitor Vuk Branković and the nine Jugović brothers at Kosovo field on June 24, 1343.”. The author of this play deprived the Kosovo legend of its overtones connected to Serbian Orthodoxy and gave it more general Christian ones instead of the particular national tale.  Other Perast manuscripts  Besides Perast manuscripts of Mazarović, there were many other similar manuscripts, smaller and usually of lower importance. Three of such manuscripts came from family of Balović. One of them, sometimes referred to as Balovićs manuscript, contains 24 folk poems including 9 bugarštica, all of them thematically connected with Kotor Bay. In Dubrovnik, a copy of the Perast Navigation Instructions manuscript is held in the archives.

Biography Etete, was found guilty of money laundering by a French court in 2007. He was also found to have used illicit funds to buy a speedboat and a chateau. Corruption In 2011, as a former Minister of Petroleum under military dictator General Sani Abacha, Dan Etete facilitated the transfer of payment of $1.1 billion to Malabu Oil and Gas. Malabu was set up in 1998 by Etete using a false identity so as to award himself a lucrative oil block, OPL 245, for which he paid only $2 million of the $20 million legally required by the state. At the time of Goodluck Jonathan's government, Etete helped facilitate the transfer of payment from Shell and Eni to Malabu Oil and Gas. The Economist reports that only $800 million out of the $1.1 billion meant for Malabu Oil and Gas was ever remitted by the Nigerian government. The Nigerian Attorney General, Mohammed Bello Adoke, who signed the documents involved in facilitating the payments, denied the rest was shared by public officials. The transfer to convicted felon, Etete, only came to public light when a Russian lawyer that claimed to have helped Malabu negotiate a deal with the Jonathan's government sued in New York for a $66 million unpaid commission. Both Shell and Eni, as of September 2014, are under investigation for corruption by the UK and Italy authorities for the incidence. In 2017, e-mails obtained by anti-corruption charities Global Witness and Finance Uncovered apparently revealed that Shell's executives were negotiating directly with Etete for a year before the oil deal that corruptly enriched Etete was finalised.

It appeared in serialized form in the comic book Love and Rockets in 1987–88, and it first appeared in collected form in 1989 in The Complete Love and Rockets, Volume 8: Blood of Palomar. The story tells of a serial killer in the fictional Latin American village of Palomar, and the political and social implications of the insular villagers' growing contact with the outside world. Background and publication Love and Rockets was an alternative comic book begun in the early 1980s showcasing the work of the Hernandez brothers: Mario (b. 1953), Gilbert (b. 1957), and Jaime (b. 1959). The stories featured sensitive portrayals of prominent female and multiethnic characters—especially Latinos—which were uncommon in American comics of the time. A version of Gilbert's Luba appeared in the first issue, but the character as she was to be known first appeared in his Palomar stories as a strong-willed, hammer-wielding ' bathhouse girl, and makes her way to the center of political and social happenings in the fictional Latin American village of Palomar. Hernandez gradually took advantage of serialization to broaden his narrative scope; the stories became longer and more ambitious, and Hernandez delved more deeply into the backgrounds of his characters and their community, and sociopolitical issues. Human Diastrophism appeared in Love and Rockets 21–26 (July 1987 – June 1988, and then in a revised and collected form as part of The Complete Love and Rockets, Volume 8: Blood of Palomar from Fantagraphics Books. The story has since appeared in a number of other collections, including the third Heartbreak Soup volume from Titan Books in 1989, titled Human Diastrophism: A Heartbreak Soup Graphic Novel; the Palomar: The Heartbreak Soup Stories in 2003 from Fantagraphics; and in 2007 the fifth volume of the Love and Rockets Library from Fantagraphics, titled Human Diastrophism. Synopsis The story weaves several narrative threads in the fictional Central American village of Palomar. An archaeological excavation team that arrives in Palomar brings a forgotten former resident, Tomaso, who begins serial killing. Among the victims are a Swedish archaeologist and the mayor and his wife. The schoolteacher Heraclio introduces modern art to the aspiring artist Humberto, whom he finds secretly sketching the locals. This flood of ideas overwhelms Humberto, who feverishly redoubles his artistic efforts. He sketches Tomaso's attempted murder of a local girl, but keeps this discovery to himself. Police discover the sketches and realize Tomaso is the murder, but a local man, stricken with grief over having murdered his own children, confesses to Tomaso's murders as well. Humberto confounds the investigation by refusing to testify, asserting his \\"work speaks for itself\\". Growing personal anxieties lead Luba, the owner of Palomar's bathhouse, to verbally and physically abuse her eldest of her four daughters, Maricela. Among the archaeological workers, Luba finds Khamo, with whom she has twice had sexual affairs. The pair begin another, cut short when Khamo falls for another woman. At the height of her frustrations, she hands over her youngest three daughters to their unknowing biological fathers: Guadalupe to Heraclio, whom Luba had seduced when he was a teenager and whose wife is expecting their own first child; and Doralis and Casimira to Khamo. Tonantzin, who has a reputation as shallow and sexually promiscuous, has become politically conscious and devotes her energies to preparing for nuclear Armageddon. She takes to dressing in the manner of her indigenous ancestors, which alarms her friends and draws the disapprobation of the locals. Her sister Diana discovers letters to Tonantzin from a prison inmate, Geraldo, who had once held her hostage, and which relate an apocalyptic political vision. She learns Maricela had read the letters to the near-illiterate Tonantzin, and had forged many more of them after Geraldo turned to Christian topics, as she and her secret lover Riri are attracted to Tonantzin and wish to keep her coming back. The pair run away from Palomar to escape Luba's abuse and the prejudice the village would have against their affair. Waves of destructive monkeys have invaded the village, and the locals have taken to beating them to death. The monkeys destroy the laboratory set up for the murder investigation; this drives the sheriff Chelo to join the monkey hunt, where she accidentally shoots Luba's youngest daughter, Casimira, in the shoulder. A repentant Chelo convinces Luba to run for mayor. Police catch Tomaso attempting to kill Diana, who had spied him trying to kill Humberto. Tomaso impales himself in the neck, but survives and receives a jail sentence. Khamo comes to sympathize with Tonantzin's cause, and the pair leave Palomar hoping to enact political change around the world. At a demonstration in New York Tonantzin sets herself on fire; she dies, and Khamo suffers severe burns trying to save her. As the story closes, the ghost of Tonantzin as she was before she was radicalized appears and an unexpected ash falls over Palomar. Primary characters ; Carmen : Carmen is Heraclio's wife, with whom she has a son, Tito. She was abandoned on a doorstep as an infant with a note that read \\"Good riddance\\". She relates poorly to her husband's level of education, particularly as she has poor literacy. Carmen accepts the sudden revelation that her husband fathered Luba's second daughter Guadalupea a teenager. She struggles to help Tonantzin and \\"unbrainwash\\" her of the political ideas she has absorbed. ; Chelo : Overwhelmed, self-doubting sheriff of Palomar. ; Guadalupe : Guadalupe is Luba's second daughter. It is rumored in the village that her father is Manuel, whom Luba seduced in \\"Heartbreak Soup\\" when she was new to Palomar. At the same time she seduced Heraclio, who was also new to the village, but she keeps secret that he is Guadalupe's real father until she abruptly introduces them in Human Diastrophism. Heraclio's wife Carmen accepts her, telling her, \\"Guadalupe, whatever you two decide, you are always welcome in this house, to visit or even to live, if you want ...\\" Guadalupe is fascinated with the character Jean Valjean from Hugo's Les Misérables and declares she is \\"going to marry him someday\\". ; Heraclio : Heraclio is a schoolteacher married to Carmen, with whom he has a son, Tito. He is well read, though he lacks a counterpart to discuss such interests; he unsuccessfully encourages Carmen to read literature such as García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, but she struggles with poor literacy. Luba seduced him when both were new to Palomar; he fears his wife will learn of the affair, though Luba keeps it a secret from him that he is the real father of her second daughter Guadalupe. ; Humberto : Humberto is an aspiring artist, and a new character to the series, Humberto shies from social interaction. Heraclio educates him in the history of modern art; meanwhile, a sometime- companion Augustín taunts Humberto's lack of skill. Humberto's devotion to improving his art overwhelms him: when he witnesses the attempted murder of a young girl, he records it in his art rather than reporting it. Traumatized, his art becomes more distorted: he obsessively sketches the villagers, and gives the murderer a halo. William A. Nericcio sees Humberto's narrative as a quasi-autobiographic artist's coming-of-age story, \\"Goethe's Wilhelm Meister re-imagined pen in hand south of the border\\". ; Khamo : Khamo is Luba's former lover and unknowing father of two of her children. When he arrives in Palomar to participate in an archaeological dig, he and Luba resume their affair; when it begins to fail, it shakes Luba's self-confidence, driving her to engage in casual sex with numerous partners. ; Luba : Luba is a long-established character in the Palomar stories. At the opening of Human Diastrophism Luba runs a bathhouse and is an unmarried mother of four: Maricela; Guadalupe, whose father Heraclio she seduced when he was a teenager; and Casimira and Doralis, whose father is Khamo. She is a reluctant mother; the narrator says she \\"has stated that if she could change anything in her past, she sure would have thought twice about having any of the five to whom she often refers as her 'little albatrosses'\\". ; Maricela : Maricela is Luba's eldest daughter. She and her lover Riri plan to leave the village together, to escape both Luba's physical abuse and the village's disapproval of their lesbian relationship. When Riri compares the way she tosses her hair to Luba's, the enraged Maricela replies, \\"I am nothing like her!\\" ; Tomaso : A former resident of Palomar, Tomaso returns with a group on an archaeological dig and sets out in secret to serial killing. A past victim calls out his name throughout the narrative. the Aztec Earth-goddess. ; Tonantzin Villaseñor : Named after an Aztec goddess, Tonantzin (whose name means \\"revered mother\\") works as a vendor of edible ' slugs, a popular food in Palomar. The locals gossip about her uneducated naïveté and sexual promiscuity, which has led to several abortions. She corresponds with an imprisoned convict Geraldo who had assaulted her in Duck Feet (1986), and whose apocalyptic ideas politicize her—she sees Palomar in light of an international struggle. She takes to wearing the traditional garb of her people, to the consternation of her family and friends. Background From 1981 until 1996, the Hernandez brothers—Mario (b. 1953), Gilbert (b. 1957), and Jaime (b. 1959)–showcased their work in their anthology comic book Love and Rockets. Gilbert's Palomar stories and Jaime's Locas stories accounted for the bulk of the content. Love and Rockets soon gained recognition as one of the leading publications in alternative comics. The stories rely on the complex social interactions of their large casts of characters, which drew attention for the large numbers of ethnic minorities—Latinos in particular—and complex and prominent female characters, in a field known traditionally for less sympathetic—and often misogynistic—portrayals of women. Gilbert's Luba appeared in the first issue; a reworked version of the character as she came to be known first appeared in his Palomar stories as a strong-willed, hammer-wielding ' (\\"bathhouse girl\\"). Over the course of the stories she made her way to the center of political and social happenings in the fictional Latin American village of Palomar. Hernandez introduces her and the teenaged Heraclio as newcomers to the fictional Latin American village of Palomar in \\"Sopa de Gran Pena\\" (Spanish for \\"Heartbreak Soup\\") in Love and Rockets in 1983. Hernandez gradually took advantage of serialization to broaden his narrative scope; the stories became longer and more ambitious, and Hernandez delved more deeply into the backgrounds of his large cast of characters as their stories develop over a narrative timeframe of decades. Hernandez embarked on his longest and most complex work to date when he began Human Diastrophism in 1987. Style and analysis The word diastrophism refers to the deformation of the earth, such as by earthquakes; Hernandez defines it as \\"the action of forces that deform the Earth's crust and so produce continents, mountains, etc\\". \\"Human diastrophism\\" thus refers metaphorically to the great changes that take place in the lives of those in Palomar through the events in the story. The insular village society feels threatened by the encroachment of the outside world; its mayor resists having even a telephone installed: \\"It would mean the end of our innocence\\", he replies to Chelo's pleas. Hernandez deploys a highly stylized cartooning style that nonetheless captures nuances of expression and the individuality of his characters' features. He renders characters at times naturalistic and at others highly distorted and caricatured, particularly when expressing strong feelings. Jesse Molesworth sees parallels between Luba and Tomaso: Tomaso murders five in a span of time during which Luba has sex with five men, and both spend time in Humberto's home gazing at his artwork. Works of literature appear frequently throughout the story. Guadalupe idolizes the protagonist of Hugo's Les Misérables, Jean Valjean. Heraclio encourages Carmen to read García Márquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude and is excited to find another teacher, Gloria, who shares his reading interests, though he does not known Raskolnikov from Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment when she refers to the character. Moleworth sees parallels with these characters and characters in Human Diastrophism: between Raskolnikov and Heraclio, who fears the discovery his teenage affair with Luba; and Luba with Jean Valjean, both of whom rise from disreputable backgrounds and harassment from the law to become mayor of their communities, and for whom the romantic lives of their children become a focus in their stories. Aftermath Hernandez followed Human Diastrophism with Poison River, a longer, more complex and again politically- tinged graphic novel, after which he scaled back his Palomar stories and largely back away from politics. Years later, he stated, \\"I had two political stories in me, [Human Diastrophism] and [Poison River], and that's it. Unless I came upon something political that I would've liked expressed, I preferred to keep away, as not to repeat myself or half-ass any truth about other people's misery.\\" The character Humberto nearly disappears from the Palomar continuity following his début appearance in Human Diastrophism. He reappears only in Chelo's Burden, the last Palomar story in the first Love and Rockets series, where it is revealed that he is behind the submerged statues of the denizens of Palomar that have been discovered. He declares, \\"One day this stream will be gone and the statues will be exposed. Reaching ever upward toward God—the sun—like eternal flowers and I will be forgiven my sins ...\\" Reception and legacy Shortly after Tonantzin's suicide, a reader's letter printed in Love and Rockets in December 1989 asks Hernandez: \\"Do you think you could develop a character whose life wasn't pure misfortune? Someone who didn't have a miserable, depressing life? Someone I could care for, but not pity?\\" Hernandez retorts: \\"None of my characters has had a 'miserable, depressing life'. None. And I don't do requests.\\" Henrandez recognized how difficult it was for new readers of Love and Rockets to get up to speed with the increasingly longer and complex stories; in issue (June 1988)—in which the last instalment of Human Diastrophism appeared—in lieu of a \\"story so far\\", he declared: \\"For any new reader of this story; forget it, it's hopeless.\\" The problem only worsened with the following serial, Poison River, which was longer and more complex. The weak reader reception to these two serials contributed to Hernandez' decision to bring Love and Rockets to an end in 1996, after which he produced various series and standalone graphic novels. Critic Charles Hatfield called Human Diastrophism \\"one of the signal examples of alternative comics from the 1980s\\", and reviewer Tom Knapp called it \\"a landmark volume that belongs in the collection of any collector of graphic novels or, for that matter, any form of quality storytelling\\".

History This fajã contains two hermitages, the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Almas, situated in the area of Barbós, and the Hermitage of Santo Cristo, constructed in 1876.SRAM (2012) On 9 September 1880, the hermitage of Santo Cristo suffered a fire, and was reconstructed through initiatives of the Baron of Ribeiro, Francisco José de Bettencourt e Ávila, and was consecrated on 14 January 1882. Near this church is a cistern, which was also ordered built by the Baron, who was one of the principal proprietors of the fajã. In 1981, the fajã had 78 residents, but along the preceding years, this population slowly decreased to the point that there were only five permanent inhabitants. Yet, through the reconstruction of the accessway to the fajã, the number of buildings in the fajã have increased, principally by emigrants. Geography It is accessed by a roadway that winds down to fajã, to a platform with limited parking. From this point the homes and coastal area reachable by foot or by small single-engine vehicles. The port is used for small-scale fishing, from along the coast and in the channel, which includes the capture of Gadiformes such as Atlantic horse mackerel. The more frequent migratory and marine birds in the fajã include: sea-gulls, terns, shearwaters, kites, blackbirds and even wild ducks, as well as occasionally sandpipers. Due to the rich ecosystem the fajã is part of the IBA that includes the coast from Ribeira da Fajã das Almas until the ravine of Pico das Brenhas.

She continues to create art, publish her writings, and teach in her studio in Chelsea, New York.  Life and career  Goulet's arts studies began when at age seven she met Aimee Voorhees at the Inwood Pottery Studio in 1932 and continued working with Voorhees for four formative years. Shortly thereafter, her family moved to Los Angeles, California, where she continued her education. In 1940 she became an apprentice to Jean Rose, a ceramicist in Southern California. In the autumn of 1943, Goulet entered Black Mountain College, North Carolina, where she studied painting and drawing with Josef Albers and weaving with Anni Albers. In the summer of 1944, she met Jose de Creeft, a visiting sculptor and instructor, and in November 1944, Goulet and de Creeft were married. Two years later, they acquired a farm in Hoosick Falls, New York, where they worked part of each year until 1968, and gave birth to artist Donna Maria de Creeft. Goulet's first solo exhibition was in New York, in 1948. Her work has been represented in group shows since 1948, among them, a number of Annual Exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, and in the fine arts pavilion of the New York World's Fair of 1964/1965.

The gallery showcases contemporary Australian visual culture with up to ten exhibitions annually. In 2016 the gallery expanded its footprint as the cultural outpost on Australia’s Coastal Wilderness and launched two project spaces within new Bega Valley Shire Council community developments. Bega Valley Regional Gallery is the only publicly funded art gallery in South Eastern New South Wales with its closest neighbours being Wagga Wagga Regional Gallery - The National Art Glass Gallery to the west and the Shoalhaven City Arts Centre to the north. The gallery currently employs a full-time curator and casual access and learning facilitator. As of 2016 the gallery staff and council developed a five-year strategic plan for the gallery. Despite physical limitations, the gallery delivers up to 40 public programs and outreach activities within the local government and regional area per year, including film nights, traditional drawing, printmaking and painting workshops as well as new media and film-based workshops, curatorial lectures, visiting artist and academic lectures and professional development seminars for artists. The gallery aligns with council's Community Strategic Plan and develops activities along its guiding principles of Equity, Access and Participation.  The Future  For many Australians, arts and culture have become more accessible as a result of the pandemic. Since March 2020, arts organisations have expanded their digital business operations and delivery of arts experiences online. The digital shift accelerated by COVID-19 has the potential to enable more people with disability to participate in the arts and cultural labour force as well as access arts experiences. This is also true for Australians living in regional areas. Prior to the pandemic, regional Australians were already highly engaged, attending arts events at almost the same level of frequency as metropolitan-based Australians (64% compared to 70%).24 As a result of the arts’ agile shift to digital delivery, 67% of attendees of regional and remote arts organisations are currently accessing arts and cultural content online.25 In addition to digital access, face to face engagement is important for communities to connect. We have an opportunity to make sure the industry becomes representative of, and accessible to, the wider Australian population at all levels, across all regions and areas of practice.https://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/workspace/uploads/files/re- imagine-discussion-paper-fi-5f5863651320c.pdf  History  The gallery in its current location, within the headquarters of the Bega Valley Shire Council, has existed since 1988 when it was built with a promise of $500,000 Australian Bicentenary funding from the federal government. Due to delays in the building of the facility the funding was removed, despite the gallery eventually being finished within the projected timeframe. This led to the gallery being not so much purpose built as a modern art gallery, but as a rudimentary exhibition space. Nonetheless, the local community has embraced the gallery and the space attracts around 12,000 visitors annually. The gallery was created to address the need of a local organisation, the Bega Valley Arts and Crafts Society, to have a permanent space for it to exhibit and display it's art collection. The group had been housed in a succession of locations within Bega since its formation in 1946. With the creation of the Regional Gallery, the society entrusted its collection to the council to hold on behalf of the community. The collection is an historical one featuring paintings by Hilda Rix Nicholas, Julian Ashton and prints by Sydney Long. The three pieces of Hilda Rix Nicholas' in the collection have been on regular loan since the artist was 'rediscovered' in the 2010s. The works have been included in exhibitions at the National Portrait Gallery and the Mosman Art Gallery In early 2021 the BVRG will begin a redevelopment project which includes doubling the footprint of the exhibition space, new workshop/project space facilities and a gallery to accommodate its growing permanent collection. The project has been part funded by The Australian Government through its Building Better Regional Fund (BBRF). Despite being ranked the number one candidate in the NSW State Governments $100 million Regional Cultural Fund round in 2018, the BVRG was not awarded the $3.4 million needed to complete the redevelopment program at an earlier date.https://www.begadistrictnews.com.au/story/6769637/bega- regional-gallerys-funding-rejection-despite-top-rating-disheartening/ https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-26/bega-gallery-missed-out-on-nsw- regional-arts-grant/12282108  Funding  The gallery is funded by the Bega Valley Shire Council through a special rate variation in recognition of the importance of the visual arts within the region and as such, visual arts practitioners make up a large proportion of the community. Arts NSW, now Create NSW, provides annual funding for the gallery's artistic program. The gallery actively applies for grants to further extend its artistic and public programs from external funding bodies, locally and at state and federal levels.  The Collection  The BVRG manages the collection of the Bega Valley Arts & Craft Society and the Shirley Hannan Trust. It also is a leader of artistic and cultural vision for the community and as such is heavily involved in the commissioning and maintenance of public art throughout the region. The focus of the BVRG permanent collection is contemporary portraiture, landscape and contemporary Indigenous artworks. BVRG is registered to receive donations to the collection via The Australian Governments Cultural Gift Program. BVRG has Deductible Gift Recipient (DGR) Status.  Awards and prizes  The gallery also administers the biannual Shirley Hannan National Portrait Award, a unique prize which focuses on realistic portraiture and has a non-acquisitive prize of $50,000, a $1,000 'mailroom' prize and a $3,000 'people's choice award'. In 2014 the BVRG announced a new annual prize, 'The Shirl' National Youth Portraiture Prize, aimed at engaging young artists, 16–25 and with an acquisitive prize of $10,000. Each winning work will be added to the gallery's permanent collection  Volunteers  The gallery depends on volunteers to set up and supervise exhibitions, to assist with maintenance and upkeep of the gallery and to staff exhibition openings and also assist with public programs. A core group of 40 people, mostly retirees with tertiary education or from a professional background and with a strong community focus, make up the Regional Gallery Volunteers.  Memberships  The Bega Valley Regional Gallery is a member of the National Association for the Visual Arts, Museums & Galleries NSW, Regional & Public Galleries NSW and the Aboriginal Culture, Heritage & Arts Association.

She was the first female Dean of the Economic History Faculty in the University of London.  Biography  Born in Truro, Cornwall, Knowles attended Truro High School. After a tour of the continent with her family she went to Girton College, Cambridge. At Girton she read history and law taking both a History Tripos and a Law Tripos (Part 1) in 1894. Both were judged to be \\"first class\\" and she was the first woman to obtain a first class in the law tripos. At the time she took her degree Cambridge did not allow women to receive their degrees. Knowles, as with many other such female students from both Cambridge and Oxford universities, was later, in 1907, to take the steamboat to Ireland to be conferred with an ad eundem University of Dublin degree at Trinity College, Dublin. Hers was a DLitt. Thus she became one of the steamboat ladies. Lilian Knowles House is a student residence reserved for postgraduate students at the LSE Between 1895–99 she was one of the London School of Economic's first research students and taught there as an occasional lecturer between 1897 and 1898. In 1904 she gained a teachership in modern economic history at LSE — thus, according to Berg, \\"becoming the first full- time teacher of the subject at any British university\\". In 1907 she was promoted to Reader in economic history. In 1921 she was promoted to a professorship in Economic History becoming Britain's second professor in that subject (the first being George Unwin at the University of Manchester). From 1920 to 1924 she served as the University of London's Dean of the Faculty of Economics. This made her the first woman to become a Dean of the University of London. Outside academia, she was the only female member of the Royal Commission on Income Tax, 1919–1920 and she was especially concerned with the practice, extant at the time, of charging income tax on joint income of married couples. She was also a member of the Council of the Royal Economic Society and of the Council of the Royal Historical Society. Legacy Since 2006, the LSE has had a 360 bedroom development reserved for their postgraduate students. The building is based on a Victorian building and it is now called the \\"Lilian Knowles House\\".Lilian Knowles House , GenerationEstates, retrieved 18 February 2015 There are also two student prizes named after her at LSE; one for the highest marks in the first year and one for the highest marks in the final year of the Economic History Undergraduate degree programme.
