For example, consider fluid systems described in terms of temperature, matter density, and pressure. In this class of systems, it is known that temperature differences lead to heat flows from the warmer to the colder parts of the system; similarly, pressure differences will lead to matter flow from high-pressure to low-pressure regions. What is remarkable is the observation that, when both pressure and temperature vary, temperature differences at constant pressure can cause matter flow (as in convection) and pressure differences at constant temperature can cause heat flow. Perhaps surprisingly, the heat flow per unit of pressure difference and the density (matter) flow per unit of temperature difference are equal. This equality was shown to be necessary by Lars Onsager using statistical mechanics as a consequence of the time reversibility of microscopic dynamics (microscopic reversibility). The theory developed by Onsager is much more general than this example and capable of treating more than two thermodynamic forces at once, with the limitation that \\"the principle of dynamical reversibility does not apply when (external) magnetic fields or Coriolis forces are present\\", in which case \\"the reciprocal relations break down\\". Though the fluid system is perhaps described most intuitively, the high precision of electrical measurements makes experimental realisations of Onsager's reciprocity easier in systems involving electrical phenomena. In fact, Onsager's 1931 paper refers to thermoelectricity and transport phenomena in electrolytes as well known from the 19th century, including \\"quasi-thermodynamic\\" theories by Thomson and Helmholtz respectively. Onsager's reciprocity in the thermoelectric effect manifests itself in the equality of the Peltier (heat flow caused by a voltage difference) and Seebeck (electrical current caused by a temperature difference) coefficients of a thermoelectric material. Similarly, the so-called \\"direct piezoelectric\\" (electrical current produced by mechanical stress) and \\"reverse piezoelectric\\" (deformation produced by a voltage difference) coefficients are equal. For many kinetic systems, like the Boltzmann equation or chemical kinetics, the Onsager relations are closely connected to the principle of detailed balance and follow from them in the linear approximation near equilibrium. Experimental verifications of the Onsager reciprocal relations were collected and analyzed by D. G. Miller for many classes of irreversible processes, namely for thermoelectricity, electrokinetics, transference in electrolytic solutions, diffusion, conduction of heat and electricity in anisotropic solids, thermomagnetism and galvanomagnetism. In this classical review, chemical reactions are considered as \\"cases with meager\\" and inconclusive evidence. Further theoretical analysis and experiments support the reciprocal relations for chemical kinetics with transport. For his discovery of these reciprocal relations, Lars Onsager was awarded the 1968 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The presentation speech referred to the three laws of thermodynamics and then added \\"It can be said that Onsager's reciprocal relations represent a further law making a thermodynamic study of irreversible processes possible.\\"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1968. Presentation Speech. Some authors have even described Onsager's relations as the \\"Fourth law of thermodynamics\\".  Example: Fluid system = The fundamental equation  The basic thermodynamic potential is internal energy. In a simple fluid system, neglecting the effects of viscosity the fundamental thermodynamic equation is written: :\\\\mathrm{d}U=T\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}S-P\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}V+\\\\mu\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}M where U is the internal energy, T is temperature, S is entropy, P is the hydrostatic pressure, V is the volume, \\\\mu is the chemical potential, and M mass. In terms of the internal energy density, u, entropy density s, and mass density \\\\rho, the fundamental equation at fixed volume is written: :\\\\mathrm{d}u=T\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}s+\\\\mu\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\rho For non-fluid or more complex systems there will be a different collection of variables describing the work term, but the principle is the same. The above equation may be solved for the entropy density: :\\\\mathrm{d}s = (1/T)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}u + (-\\\\mu/T)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\rho The above expression of the first law in terms of entropy change defines the entropic conjugate variables of u and \\\\rho, which are 1/T and -\\\\mu/T and are intensive quantities analogous to potential energies; their gradients are called thermodynamic forces as they cause flows of the corresponding extensive variables as expressed in the following equations.  The continuity equations  The conservation of mass is expressed locally by the fact that the flow of mass density \\\\rho satisfies the continuity equation: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} + abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{J}_\\\\rho = 0, where \\\\mathbf{J}_\\\\rho is the mass flux vector. The formulation of energy conservation is generally not in the form of a continuity equation because it includes contributions both from the macroscopic mechanical energy of the fluid flow and of the microscopic internal energy. However, if we assume that the macroscopic velocity of the fluid is negligible, we obtain energy conservation in the following form: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} + abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{J}_u = 0, where u is the internal energy density and \\\\mathbf{J}_u is the internal energy flux. Since we are interested in a general imperfect fluid, entropy is locally not conserved and its local evolution can be given in the form of entropy density s as : \\\\frac{\\\\partial s}{\\\\partial t} + abla \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{J}_s = \\\\frac{\\\\partial s_c}{\\\\partial t} where \\\\frac{\\\\partial s_c}{\\\\partial t} is the rate of increase in entropy density due to the irreversible processes of equilibration occurring in the fluid and \\\\mathbf{J}_s is the entropy flux.  The phenomenological equations  In the absence of matter flows, Fourier's law is usually written: : \\\\mathbf{J}_{u} = -k\\\\, abla T; where k is the thermal conductivity. However, this law is just a linear approximation, and holds only for the case where abla T \\\\ll T, with the thermal conductivity possibly being a function of the thermodynamic state variables, but not their gradients or time rate of change. Assuming that this is the case, Fourier's law may just as well be written: : \\\\mathbf{J}_u = k T^2 abla (1/T); In the absence of heat flows, Fick's law of diffusion is usually written: : \\\\mathbf{J}_{\\\\rho} = -D\\\\, abla\\\\rho, where D is the coefficient of diffusion. Since this is also a linear approximation and since the chemical potential is monotonically increasing with density at a fixed temperature, Fick's law may just as well be written: : \\\\mathbf{J}_{\\\\rho} = D'\\\\, abla(-\\\\mu/T) ! where, again, D' is a function of thermodynamic state parameters, but not their gradients or time rate of change. For the general case in which there are both mass and energy fluxes, the phenomenological equations may be written as: : \\\\mathbf{J}_{u} = L_{uu}\\\\, abla (1/T) + L_{u\\\\rho}\\\\, abla (-\\\\mu/T) : \\\\mathbf{J}_{\\\\rho} = L_{\\\\rho u}\\\\, abla (1/T) + L_{\\\\rho\\\\rho}\\\\, abla (-\\\\mu/T) or, more concisely, : \\\\mathbf{J}_\\\\alpha = \\\\sum_\\\\beta L_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}\\\\, abla f_\\\\beta where the entropic \\"thermodynamic forces\\" conjugate to the \\"displacements\\" u and \\\\rho are f_u=(1/T) and f_\\\\rho=(-\\\\mu/T) and L_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} is the Onsager matrix of transport coefficients.  The rate of entropy production  From the fundamental equation, it follows that: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial s}{\\\\partial t}=(1/T)\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t}+(-\\\\mu/T)\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\rho}{\\\\partial t} and :\\\\mathbf{J}_s=(1/T)\\\\mathbf{J}_u+(-\\\\mu/T)\\\\mathbf{J}_\\\\rho=\\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\mathbf{J}_\\\\alpha f_\\\\alpha Using the continuity equations, the rate of entropy production may now be written: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial s_c}{\\\\partial t}= \\\\mathbf{J}_u \\\\cdot abla (1/T)+\\\\mathbf{J}_\\\\rho \\\\cdot abla (-\\\\mu/T)=\\\\sum_\\\\alpha \\\\mathbf{J}_\\\\alpha \\\\cdot abla f_\\\\alpha and, incorporating the phenomenological equations: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial s_c}{\\\\partial t}= \\\\sum_\\\\alpha\\\\sum_\\\\beta L_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta}( abla f_\\\\alpha)\\\\cdot( abla f_\\\\beta) It can be seen that, since the entropy production must be greater than zero, the Onsager matrix of phenomenological coefficients L_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} is a positive semi-definite matrix.  The Onsager reciprocal relations  Onsager's contribution was to demonstrate that not only is L_{\\\\alpha \\\\beta} positive semi-definite, it is also symmetric, except in cases where time- reversal symmetry is broken. In other words, the cross-coefficients \\\\ L_{u\\\\rho} and \\\\ L_{\\\\rho u} are equal. The fact that they are at least proportional follows from simple dimensional analysis (i.e., both coefficients are measured in the same units of temperature times mass density). The rate of entropy production for the above simple example uses only two entropic forces, and a 2x2 Onsager phenomenological matrix. The expression for the linear approximation to the fluxes and the rate of entropy production can very often be expressed in an analogous way for many more general and complicated systems.  Abstract formulation  Let x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n denote fluctuations from equilibrium values in several thermodynamic quantities, and let S(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) be the entropy. Then, Boltzmann's entropy formula gives for the probability distribution function w =A\\\\exp(S/k), A=const, since the probability of a given set of fluctuations {x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n} is proportional to the number of microstates with that fluctuation. Assuming the fluctuations are small, the probability distribution function can be expressed through the second differential of the entropy :w=\\\\tilde{A}e^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\beta_{ik}x_ix_k}\\\\, ; \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\ \\\\beta_{ik} = \\\\beta_{ki}= -\\\\frac{1}{k}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 S}{\\\\partial x_i \\\\partial x_k}\\\\, , where we are using Einstein summation convention and \\\\beta_{ik} is a positive definite symmetric matrix. Using the quasi-stationary equilibrium approximation, that is, assuming that the system is only slightly non- equilibrium, we have \\\\dot{x}_i=-\\\\lambda_{ik}x_k Suppose we define thermodynamic conjugate quantities as X_i=-\\\\frac{1}{k}\\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial x_i}, which can also be expressed as linear functions (for small fluctuations): X_i= \\\\beta_{ik}x_k Thus, we can write \\\\dot{x}_i=-\\\\gamma_{ik}X_k where \\\\gamma_{ik}=\\\\lambda_{il}\\\\beta^{-1}_{lk} are called kinetic coefficients The principle of symmetry of kinetic coefficients or the Onsager's principle states that \\\\gamma is a symmetric matrix, that is \\\\gamma_{ik}=\\\\gamma_{ki} Proof Define mean values \\\\xi_i(t) and \\\\Xi_i(t) of fluctuating quantities x_i and X_i respectively such that they take given values x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots at t=0 Note that \\\\dot{\\\\xi}_i(t)=-\\\\gamma_{ik}\\\\Xi_k Symmetry of fluctuations under time reversal implies that \\\\langle x_i(t)x_k(0)\\\\rangle=\\\\langle x_i(-t)x_k(0)\\\\rangle = \\\\langle x_i(0)x_k(t)\\\\rangle or, with \\\\xi_i(t), we have \\\\langle\\\\xi_i(t)x_k\\\\rangle=\\\\langle x_i\\\\xi_k(t)\\\\rangle Differentiating with respect to t and substituting, we get \\\\gamma_{il}\\\\langle\\\\Xi_l(t)x_k\\\\rangle=\\\\gamma_{kl}\\\\langle x_i\\\\Xi_l(t)\\\\rangle Putting t=0 in the above equation, \\\\gamma_{il}\\\\langle X_lx_k\\\\rangle=\\\\gamma_{kl}\\\\langle X_lx_i\\\\rangle It can be easily shown from the definition that \\\\langle X_ix_k\\\\rangle=\\\\delta_{ik}, and hence, we have the required result.

In 1866, Wilkes and Camp sold the Gazette to George W. Matsell. The editor and proprietor from 1877 until his death in 1922 was Richard Kyle Fox, an immigrant from Ireland. Richard Kyle Fox was editor and proprietor of the Gazette from 1877 to 1922 Ostensibly devoted to matters of interest to the police, it was a tabloid-like publication, with lurid coverage of murders, Wild West outlaws, and sport. It was well known for its engravings and photographs of scantily clad strippers, burlesque dancers, and prostitutes, often skirting on the edge of what was legally considered obscenity. For decades it was a staple furnishing of barber shops, where men would peruse it awaiting their turn. The publication's association with barber shops was noted in a Vaudeville routine in which the straight man asked \\"Seen the Police Gazette?,\\" and his partner replied \\"No, I shave myself.\\" The National Police Gazette enjoyed considerable popularity in the late 19th century and early decades of the 20th century. Its popularity decreased during the Great Depression.American Heritage article , 1972 In 1932 the Police Gazette ceased publication, and was sold at auction for a nominal sum.

Hersey, the ex-wife of Harold Hersey. During this period the paper appeared twice a month and took on more of the flavor of a girlie magazine. The Donenfeld/Hersey regime did not last long. The magazine changed hands again within a year, coming into the possession of Harold H. Roswell and becoming a monthly publication in 1935. The National Police Gazette continued as a monthly publication in Roswell's hands for many years.

Bare Knuckle Boxing The Police Gazette was the first organized boxing sanctioning body in America, declaring its intention in 1881 and issuing championships beginning in 1882. Integral to the Police Gazette Rules was the requirement that championships be contested bare knuckle. Though all professional championship boxing was technically illegal, the Gazette continued as the bare-knuckle sanctioning organization until 1894 when it was clear gloved boxing would be the only acceptable mainstream version of the sport. In March 2018, Wyoming became the first jurisdiction to legalize bare-knuckle fighting at the state level, and formal bare knuckle events have been happening since June 2018. In response, National Police Gazette Enterprises, LLC, in partnership with the Bare Knuckle Boxing Hall of Fame of Belfast, NY, created the Police Gazette Boxing Corporation as the successor to the Police Gazette's original bare knuckle boxing sanctioning activities. Current Police Gazette Champions are the lineal bare knuckle champions going back to those in the 19th century, such as John L. Sullivan.

A related company, Tippmann Industrial Products manufactures manual and pneumatic heavy-duty sewing machines primarily used for leather, other leather-related equipment, and some industrial products. Originally a family owned business run from Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 2004 Dennis Tippmann Sr. sold a majority ownership stake to Summit Partners, a private equity firm. Tippmann designed the first automatic marker, the use of refillable air systems in place of 12 gram cartridges, the \\"Cyclone Feed\\" system, the \\"Flatline\\" barrel, and the Tippmann C-3, the first propane-powered marker.  History  The Tippmann family, headed by Dennis Tippmann Senior, originally manufactured collectible, half-scale replica machine guns. However, a change in gun laws led to entry into the paintball market in 1986; forming the Tippmann Pneumatics Incorporated company. The company attempted to make high-performance, durable and affordable products - with the company claiming to have built the first semi-automatic and full- automatic paintball markers in the world. In June 2004, Tippmann announced that the company had completed a financial recapitalization with private equity and venture capital firm Summit Partners. Howard Kosick joined Tippmann as its president and CEO, with both Dennis Tippman Senior and Dennis Tippmann Junior remaining on the company‚Äôs Board of directors as consultants; the latter continuing with the management team in product development. Shortly afterward in 2005, the company announced a record year for increased sales of paint marker units. The company has been credited with the development of several technologies, including the introduction of C3 with PEP Technology propane markers in 2005, and improved Anti-Chop technology in 2006 to combat paintball breakages inside the marker. In 2010, Tippmann Sports acquired NXe, a manufacturer of soft goods for the paintball industry. The acquisition combined the industry‚Äôs leading paintball marker brand with the leading soft goods brand. A full line of paintball harnesses, protective gear, tank covers, apparel, bags, pods and other miscellaneous accessories were immediately integrated into Tippmann‚Äôs existing product offering. On December 20, 2013, the acquisition of Tippman was announced by G.I. Sportz Chairman and CEO Richmond Italia.http://paintball.tippmann.com/blog/bid/329326/G-I-Sportz- Acquires-Tippmann-Sports  Current paintball markers = Tippmann M4 Carbine (TMC)  The TMC is Tippmann's MagFed Paintball Marker. It was first sold to the public in 2016 it can be magazine or hopper fed, but not both at the same time. It comes in an all black or a black and tan finish. The TMC is approximately in weight.  Tippmann Tactical Compact Rifle (TCR)  The TCR is Tippmann's MagFed only close quarters battle military simulation magazine fed paintball marker. The manual was published in February of 2015. The TCR is first strike round ready out of the box. It can be powered by 12 gram cartridges or by using a remote line to a larger tank. This paintball marker cannot use a hopper without being disassembled to install an adapter and must be reloaded via magazine. The TCR is about in weight.  Cronus  The Cronus was released by Tippmann in December 2013. It comes in a \\"Basic\\" version, which includes just the marker and simple barrel. It also comes in a \\"Tactical\\" version, with a more M16-like appearance. The Tactical version features a 6-position adjustable stock, barrel shroud, forward grip, and a removable carry handle, similar to that seen on the Alpha Black Elite. It comes in a desert tan or olive green finish.  Crossover  Debuting in 2012, the Crossover is aimed at both Speedball and Recreational play. The Crossover utilizes the latest version of the FlexValve, allowing it to fire in both Electronic and Mechanical modes. Other advancements and features include integrated break beam anti-chop eyes, low pressure operation under 300 PSI allowing users to use LPA tanks and a magnetic hall effect trigger. The upper body is a solid-machined piece of aluminum, and has a centered adjusting feedneck to allow use of any hopper. Being a \\"hybrid\\" marker, the Crossover board comes with pre-installed tournament modes for semi-pro and professional speedball play. The board features multiple adjustable firing modes, including standard semi-auto, auto-response, 3-shot burst, PSP, NPPL and Millennium modes. It also has a bottom regulator with the ability to convert to a front regulator so players can easily run their own regulator. As an added bonus of having a bottom regulator, the Crossover has the ability to utilize an internal gasline to keep the marker cleaner looking on the outside.  FT-12  The FT-12 is one of Tippmann's newest paintball markers. Debuting in 2012, the FT-12 is aimed at rental and beginner use. The FT-12 uses a new body design never seen before in a Tippmann, using die-cast receivers. Splitting along the sides to open at the top, the FT-12 gives users a top-down view at the internals. The new body design can allow field owners to easily and quickly maintain their markers, with a savings of 75% in work time. The entire marker can be disassembled and reassembled in seconds, with everything coming right out the top. The FT-12 also utilizes an internal gasline, which prevents damage and leaks. The FT-12 also uses an enclosed bolt, similar to the A5, keeping dirt and debris from entering the marker through the cocking arm opening. The FT-12 comes stock with a vertical foregrip that can be removed. The Ft-12 shares a thread similar to the 98 Custom \\"quick-thread\\" design, allowing the use of 98 Custom barrels. No other upgrades are available or compatible. The FT-12 comes in 2 versions, a bright yellow framed rental version with rental labels riveted to the sides, and a black public version. Both generally sell for the same amount.  98 Custom Platinum  The Tippmann 98 Custom has undergone many body and internal changes, but has remained almost the same over the years since being released in 1998. Tippmanns most recent 98 model, the 98 Custom Platinum, has many of Tippmann's most recent technology changes while keeping the 98 Custom a very reliable, basic and upgradeable marker. The 98 Custom utilizes the \\"clamshell\\" body design with a split receiver for even easier access to the internals. The powertube and valve were also redesigned with a self-sealing / locking gasline to allow easier removal. The marker is flat-topped, and unlike earlier 98 Customs, comes pre-grooved to allow the use of all picatinny accessories like sights, scopes and handles right out of the box. The marker features a new finish and a textured vertical foregrip with internal locking pins to provide extra stability. Other advancements include an integrated front sight spring and a solid rear sight, to make service easier. They also started making the stock endcap with a sling mount. ACT (Anti-Chop Technology) is featured in current versions of the 98 Custom. Tippmann also produces upgrades for the 98 Custom including the Response Trigger, eGrip and Cyclone feed system. The 98 Custom utilizes a \\"quick-thread\\" design that allows for quick and painless installation/ removal, and can take all 98 Custom threaded barrels and Flatline systems.  Gryphon  The Gryphon is essentially the same in-line blowback internals as the 98 custom, in a low cost speedball-esque style body. It has an internal gas line, fixed center-feed neck, a top cocking knob, and a 2 finger blade trigger. Sharing the same threads as the A5 and X7 Phenom, any A5/X7 barrel can be used. It was designed to give entry level players on a budget an easy to maintain, effective and reliable marker for the lowest price possible. Its price is comparable to many of the \\"no-name\\" guns found in department stores, however the common parts and proven design make it far more reliable and repairable, allowing for years of use. The primary drawback of the marker is its limited upgrade options, although some internal upgrades MAY be interchangeable with the 98 Custom & US Army lineups.  A-5  In appearance the A-5 was modeled after the H&K; MP5K but can be modified to look like a number of different real world firearms. It is one of the most customizable markers on the market, with many different cosmetic and performance parts. The Tippmann A5 could easily accept standard ASA expansion chambers and regulators allowing easier performance upgrades, unlike the later X-7. Departing from previous Tippmann bodies, the A-5s hammer is completely enclosed within the clam-shell, using a separate overhead cocking mechanism. The body also incorporates a removable barrel thread adapter, allowing the marker to change its barrel threads to any major type (Spyder and Autococker being the most common). The A-5 is a semi-automatic paintball marker. It utilizes an atypical pneumatic loader called the \\"Cyclone Feed\\" similar to the Tippmann F/As force feed. This enables the marker to have a higher rate of fire than a gravity feed without the addition of a battery operated loader (at the cost of air efficiency). It uses a larger surface area and a series of rotating arms in a star-shaped pattern. Five balls are held between the paddles as they rotate paintballs into the firing chamber (moving 1/5 of a revolution per trigger pull). Theoretically, this system eliminates chops by positively feeding a paintball into the chamber before each shot. The stock Cyclone is rated for a maximum of 15 balls per second. While higher rates of fire are possible, the stock mechanics are not designed to deal with the stresses this will place on them. This limitation was addressed during the creation of the X-7. In addition to the stock semi automatic function, the A-5 can be easily upgraded with either the Response Trigger or an Electronic Trigger by swapping out the lower grip frame, a feature introduced on the A-5.  X7 Phenom  The X7 Phenom is almost identical to the X7, with a few superficial differences, and an important internal difference. The X7 Phenom is 3 inches shorter than its X7 counterpart but still utilizes the same \\"clamshell\\" design. It also comes stock with a top picatinny rail allowing the use of sights, scopes and handles, and a hand-guard with top and bottom picatinny rails. The X7 Phenom can use almost all X7 accessories and still uses the Cyclone feed system. X7 grips, however, cannot work on the X7 Phenom. The x7 supports full auto firing with compatible e-grips. Internally, the X7 Phenom is pioneered with Tippmann's new \\"Flex Valve\\" technology, allowing the marker to fire with under 300 PSI, making it more air/ efficient. It also allows electro versions of the X7 Phenom to fire in mechanical semi-automatic mode when the battery for electro-pneumatic operation has been depleted. The X7 Phenom also fires noticeably quieter and with less recoil than the X7. http://www.tippmann.com/p/x7-phenom?pp=24https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AobPoeFPbU4  TPX / TiPX  The Tippmann TPX is a low-cost, high-performance paintball pistol. Eight- or seven-round magazines are inserted into the bottom of the grip like a normal pistol. The pistol features an A5/X7 threaded barrel, making it compatible with all A5/X7 barrels that are 7/8 inch in outer diameter. The TPX can also be powered on both HPA or by an external source using an adapter, or can utilize a 12 gram cartridge that is inserted into a chamber under the barrel. Similar to Tippmanns other markers, the TPX utilizes the \\"clamshell\\" design and in place of metal uses a high-impact polymer to help keep down the weight. The Tippmann TiPX is the second generation of the pistol. The second generation mostly included fixes to the valve and regulator, and also combined the both into one solid piece. The Tru-Feed magazine was also introduced to correct misfeeding that the 8-round magazines would occasionally have. Tippmann has been known to send owners of the TPX new TiPX internals in trade for the old ones, and also trade in the old 8-round magazines for the 7 round Tru-Feed magazines. Accessories for the pistol include the Remote Line Adapter kit, which allows users to use an external continuous air source like HPA or . Tippmann's Hammerhead barrels will also fit, and they sell leg holsters and spare magazines compatible with the pistol. = U.S. ARMY Line = The U.S. ARMY line of paintball markers are produced by Tippmann in partnership and licensed under the U.S. ARMY name.  Alpha Black Elite  The Alpha Black Elite (Bravo One outside US) is a blowback design modeled after the 98 Custom, using \\"clamshell\\" body halves. In 2013, the Alpha Black was re-designed to use body halves similar to that of the \\"Project Salvo\\", but retaining its M16 look. With the redesign, Tippmann added on their removable M16 carry handle, and re-designed the handguard to feature a Picatinny rail to allow the use of foregrips. The Alpha Black Elite still has 3 variants similar to that of the Alpha Black. The Alpha Black Elite, consisting of just the marker and its accessories. The Alpha Black Elite Powerpack, consisting of the marker, and a beginners kit made of a mask, tank and hopper. And the Alpha Black Elite with E-Grip which is the same as the \\"Alpha Black Elite\\" but with added E-Grip internals.  Project Salvo  The Project Salvo (Sierra One outside US) is a blowback design similar to the 98 Custom using \\"clamshell\\" body halves molded to resemble the AR-15. To date, there is only 1 version of the Project Salvo being sold by Tippmann. The Project Salvo comes with an AR-15 styled handguard with 4 picatinny rails. It also comes with a 6-position collapsible stock that also folds to the right of the marker. The entire top of the marker is flat-topped and is also grooved to work as a picatinny rail, allowing the use of sights and scopes and also handles. Tippmann also produces upgrades for the Project Salvo including the Response Trigger, eGrip and Cyclone feed system. The Project Salvo utilizes the same \\"quick-thread\\" design that the 98 Custom uses so 98 Custom Flatline and barrel upgrades can be used.  Carver One  The Carver One (Tango One outside US) is a blowback design similar to the 98 Custom using \\"clamshell\\" body halves molded to resemble the M4. It also has three small picatinny rails toward the front to allow the use of flashlights, foregrips and bipods, as well as a picatinny rail along the top to allow the use of sights, scopes and handles. To date, there are 3 versions of the Carver One being sold by Tippmann. The \\"basic\\" version comes with only the Carver One. The \\"Carver One PowerPack\\" version comes with the Carver One, and like the Alpha Black PowerPack, the Carver One also comes with a tank, a 200-round gravity hopper and the TP420 goggle system. The \\"Carver One + eGrip\\" version comes with the basic Carver One with the eGrip internals installed. As of 2012, Tippmann has started including a vertical foregrip with the Carver One on all of its versions. The Carver One utilizes the same \\"quick-thread\\" design that the 98 Custom uses so 98 Custom barrel upgrades can be used. Because of the body design, the Cyclone feed system and Flatline systems cannot be used on the Carver One.  Additional Equipment and Technologies = A.C.T.  Tippmann recently introduced a feature known as A.C.T. (Anti-Chop Technology), which is a mechanical system integrated into the bolt system to reduce the chance of jams due to misfed paintballs. In the 98 Custom and Custom Pro markers, the hammer has a deep groove that the linkage arm sits in, along with the ACT spring to keep it in position (there is also a small hole to insert the linkage arm into if the user chooses not to use the ACT function). If a paintball is incorrectly fed into the breech when the bolt is closing, the bolt stops on the paintball with little pressure from the ACT spring, while the hammer continues on its stroke unlinked to the bolt. It hits the valve and is blown back open, where it re-engages the linkage arm and retracts the bolt, letting the paintball fall into the breech correctly. The marker is now ready to fire again. The Tippmann A.C.T feature is very similar to Spyder's ACS bolt.  Cyclone Feed System  Much like the Response Trigger System, the Cyclone Feed System uses the excess gas from firing the marker to cycle a feeding mechanism providing up to 15 balls per second. (Some have tested the unit at 20+ Balls Per Second with some commercially available modifications.) In comparison with conventional hoppers, the Cyclone has a much wider mouth, holding multiple paintballs in the feeding mechanism even without a hopper. As a shot is fired, excess (normally waste) gas from the shot is scavenged through the side of the marker via a banjo fitting (a T-type fitting is required for use with the response trigger system). The gas is utilized to rotate the cyclone as the marker re-cocks, force feeding a paintball into the chamber. The Cyclone Feed System comes standard on the Tippmann A-5 and an enhanced version comes on the X-7. Tippmann offers Cyclone upgrades for 98 Custom and Custom Pro users. The advent of the Cyclone Feed System marks the first widely used, non-electronic, agitated hopper. The lack of electronics means the user can expose the system to moisture (rain, snow, etc.) which would interfere with or destroy other mechanical systems. The Cyclone feed concept first appeared on the Tippmann F/A as a spring operated system that required manual rewinding.  Response Trigger System  The Response Trigger System is a firing system available for current production Tippmann paintball guns. The system uses a series of parts that are added to the gun to greatly increase firing rate for the marker. The system uses excess carbon dioxide or compressed air from the firing process to reset the trigger and sear with a pneumatic cylinder. The cylinder can reset the trigger with only moderate pressure. When this happens, the pressure of the finger immediately pulls the trigger back again, firing another shot. If the operator utilizes the correct amount of pressure on the trigger, a \\"bouncing\\" effect occurs, resulting in fully automatic-like fire for the duration of the time that the operator can maintain that amount of pressure (commonly known as the \\"sweet spot\\"). As such, its use has been restricted to single-shot operation at some commercial paintball fields while banned completely at others. The Response Trigger System is available on the 98 Custom, Custom Pro, A-5, and X-7 markers. It can also be installed in the Model 98 with modification (tapping the powertube and allowing space in the grip for the cylinder).  E-Grip  The E-Grip is an electronic means of firing the marker. Utilizing battery operated components, the E-Grip replaces the trigger function, to where the trigger simply closes a micro switch. The switch sends a signal to a small circuit board, activating a solenoid. The solenoid uses a push rod to actuate the sear in this system. The board has multiple firing modes, allowing semi- automatic, burst, automatic and other modes. A few models of boards are available from different manufacturers, with different features, but the same dimensions to fit into the guides in the grip. The term E-Grip is usually applied to the system in the A-5 and X-7 markers, because they use a removable grip frame that contains all the electronics. The term E-Trigger is applied to the US Army and 98 Custom lines.  Flatline Barrel System  The Flatline barrel is a curved paintball barrel using a slight arch in combination with a rough inner surface texture to create backspin on the ball which flattens the trajectory. The range can increase to upwards of ( over a standard barrel). With a regular paintball barrel, a player will often have to raise the angle at which he/she is shooting in order to reach the opposing player. The accuracy of this barrel system is dependent on more factors than a standard barrel. With backspin being put on the paintball, inconsistency in the shape of a paintball will create unusual trajectories. Another disadvantage is its tendency to break thin shelled paintballs more easily due to the increased friction. However, this can be remedied by avoiding the use of low-grade paintballs. The 98 Custom Flatline barrel must be re-adjusted for accuracy whenever it is removed and reinstalled. Therefore, it's a good idea to \\"mark\\" where the barrel is aligned for reinstallment. The barrel is surrounded by a plastic shroud that hides the curved barrel and integrates a sight system replacing the marker sight, this is required as the barrel curves above the markers normal sight system. The shroud also have a picatinny rail for mounting accessories that attach onto a rail system. The A-5 Flatline barrel doesn't change the normal sight rail system. It resembles a large suppressor though it does not operate as one - in fact the barrel system does not have any porting and is therefore louder than a typical paintball barrel. The A-5 Flatline system can be removed and installed to the same position, making it unnecessary to adjust unlike its predecessor. It is also important to keep the marker adjusted to no more than , being the most effective velocity, for higher velocities cause paintballs to curve upwards before reaching its maximum distance, which in turn decreases the barrel's normally high effective range. Tilting the barrel to the left or right will also cause the trajectory to be altered in that direction.  Paint Grenades  Tippmann offers a small line of paintball grenades, all using the same basic design but coming in a variety of sizes. Due to the safety hazards and field regulations of using explosives, they use an expanded bladder filled with a paint mix similar to that in a paintball. To activate them, the user releases a clasp and throws the grenade, to which releases its contact and spins upon impact. In 2013, Tippmann re-designed their larger grenade, the Big Boy to have a pull-pin type clasp to simulate a real grenade pin.  Previous and Discontinued products = Alpha Black  The Alpha Black (Bravo One outside US) is a blowback design using the 98 Custom internals but instead using \\"clamshell\\" body halves molded to resemble the M16. To date, there are 4 different versions of the Alpha Black currently being sold by Tippmann. The \\"Basic\\" version is simply the Alpha Black with nothing else but the barrel. The \\"Tactical\\" version comes with a molded plastic M16 styled handguard, barrel and a 6-position collapsible stock. The \\"Tactical PowerPack\\" comes with all of the Tactical aesthetic upgrades plus a tank, a 200-round gravity hopper and the TP420 goggle system. The \\"Tactical + eGrip\\" comes with everything the Tactical version does but with the added eGrip internals to allow for burst fire and full-auto shooting. The Alpha Black can also be found sold with a Digital Camo finish but only in the Tactical version. The handguard, grip panels and stock are also molded out of a different color plastic to match. Tippmann also produces upgrades for the Alpha Black including the eGrip and Cyclone feed system. The Alpha Black utilizes the same \\"quick-thread\\" design that the 98 Custom uses so 98 Custom Flatline and barrel upgrades can be used. It is still commonly found.  Custom Pro  The Tippmann Custom Pro was an upgraded version of the 98 Custom. It featured a double trigger, drop-forward, longer barrel, and later models had Anti-chop technology. The marker also featured a scratch-resistant powdercoat on later models, and also had models that utilized the E-Trigger system.  X-7  On November 20, 2006, Tippmann launched their X-7 marker product line in cooperation with Special Ops Paintball.(2007): Special Ops Paintball URL accessed on 5th Jan, 2007 Tippmann marketed the X-7 as the most customizable marker on the market. The marker was sold as either a basic model, a response trigger edition or an E-grip edition (the latter using a Hall effect sensor for select fire modes). It had a mechanical design similar to the A-5, while featuring an upgraded cyclone feed that can achieve up to 20 balls per second. Accessories built specifically for the A-5 receiver could not be used with the X-7 (and vice versa). It featured a Mil-Sim body design, including an array of picatinny rails, a strong lightweight magnesium receiver, a low profile cyclone hopper, and an M16 magazine shaped tool kit.  C-3  The C-3, with PEP technology, was a paintball marker produced by Tippmann - and is the first paintball marker to run on propane. The C-3 was discontinued in 2006, and no plans have been announced to release another propane-powered marker.  SMG  The SMG-60 was the first fully automatic paintball marker on the market. It is modeled on the appearance of the British STEN of World War II. The marker is .62 caliber, has a fixed steel barrel, and uses three stripper clips of five balls each (or four clips if using the extended 20-round magazine); the fire rate is 10 paintballs per second, therefore an entire standard magazine can be emptied in about 1.5 seconds. Rate of fire was deliberately limited by use of a heavy hammer and maintained by a valve designed to use liquid . Some versions offered a 2-stage trigger (similar to those on firearms such as the Steyr AUG) in which a short pull produces semi-automatic fire and a long pull produces full-auto. The SMG-68 is a .68 caliber version of the SMG-60, configured for semi-automatic operation, and featuring a removable barrel. Tippmann offered a trade-in for SMG-68's to be converted into 68 Specials, by adding a front bolt and external linkage arm.  SL-68  The SL-68 was a pump gun designed for improved durability over prior product designs. The body was constructed from a cast and machined magnesium aluminum alloy, and the hopper adapter was integrated into the body casting, reducing the overall number of parts. The pump handle was originally manufactured with a cast metal, but was later replaced with a fiber-reinforced plastic. A squeegee could be stored in the pump handle, and a breech port could be used to quickly clean the barrel.  68 Special  The 68 Special was an inline poppet valve design. It was a retrofit of the SMG-60/68, designed to fire from a hopper instead of clips. The rear half of the body is identical to the SMG (early conversions even retained the \\"SMG 68\\" sticker), while the front half was cut off and replaced with a hopper fed breach. A bolt and external linkage arm was also added. One interesting feature about this gun is that the hammer can be moved out of position into a safety position preventing the gun from being able to fire, like the PMI-3/VM-68 and firearms such as the Sten and MP40. It had a built in back bottle setup that ran on liquid and was very inefficient, due to the small valve and heavy hammer (nearly 1 pound). It was one of the first semi- auto markers on the market, and cycled at 6 balls per second - very fast considering the loader technology at the time.  SL-68 II  A pump marker, the Tippmann SL-68 II superseded the original SL-68, adding anti-double feed and modified breech features. Most importantly, the constant-air adapter was relocated to an ergonomic position in the base of the cast gripframe meaning that players could easily aim with a full mask on. It was discontinued in 2003, reintroduced to the market in 2009, and then discontinued again in 2012.  Pro-AM  The Pro-Am is an open bolt semi-automatic marker. Early models had cast metal foregrips and pistol grips (the Pro-Am), while later models had composite foregrips and grip frames (the Pro-Lite). The loader connection was built into the foregrip, and by clicking the foregrip forward with a sear at the front of the gun the paint was kept from feeding, and the breech became open to clean the gun with a pull through squeegee. This allowed a player to clean the gun really fast with a pull through squeegee, without removing the barrel, or removing the loader. Like all Tippmann markers the Pro-Am was nearly indestructible and extremely reliable gun. While the Pro-am was like the 68 Special in layout, being an inline poppet valve design, it was a major change in design, with a different body, valve, breech, hammer, hammer to bolt linkage, and sear arrangements. Also the tank was moved to below the grip frame for better balance and to allow different bottom line arrangements and stocks, instead of the Lone Star (M-16 style) grip that had been on the previous Tippmann Semi/Full Auto lines. Also it was the first Tippmann Semi- Auto that didn't require a siphon tank to run liquid , even though it could in colder weather without any problems.  Pro-Lite\\\\Mini-Lite  The Pro-Lite is a semi-automatic open bolt marker. It is nearly identical to the Pro-am differing only in the materials used to make the foregrip and pistol grip. The Pro-lite used composite plastic while early Pro-Ams used cast metal foregrips and pistol grips (later Pro-Am models used composite foregrips). The difference in materials made the Pro-Lite considerably lighter than its predecessor. Like the Pro-Am, the Pro-lite was designed for durability and is extremely reliable. Paintball Fields commonly used Pro-lites as rentals because of their ease of maintenance and ability to take extreme abuse. The Mini-Lite is essentially a Pro-lite with an extra CA adapter mounted just behind foregrip.  Factory F/A  The F/A was a select fire, force fed, blowback paintball gun based on the Pro-Am/Pro-lite body, with the Star feed apparatus on the side. It can be said that the F/A's Star feed, which is close in function to the modern Cyclone feed, is the predecessor to the A-5. The F/A could be switched between safe, semi, and fully automatic firing via a fire selector lever. The full-auto setting changed the sear from a disconnecting version (used in semi-auto) to a full open sear. It used a hydraulic key/linkage/shock style system to slow the rate of fire by dragging 2 sets of keys on the top of the hammer. Although the rate of fire was adjustable from a few shots a second to around 20, the adjustments were seen as \\"tricky\\" by some users (although that was a small price to pay for such awesome firepower). Also, the Star feed required manual winding, and no other loaders on the market could feed a marker at that rate of fire. This feed system was prone to breaking paint, partially due to the spring tension, and partially due to the heavy action of older Tippmanns. The F/A, like the Pro-Lite and Carbine series, shares barrel threading and basic valve design with the A-5.  Pro- Carbine and .68 Carbine  The .68 Carbine was developed as a lighter and more customizable version of the Pro-Lite, featuring a .45 grip frame, a simplified feed neck that was not part of the forearm grip, and now-standard bottom line ASA adapter. Like the Pro-Lite, it was durable, accurate, and required minimal maintenance. The feed neck turned out to be the only weak spot, which led to the development of a new model, a combination of the Pro- Lite forearm breech and the Carbine receiver. This new model was named the Pro-Carbine. Pro-Carbine Barrels will fit Pro-Lite, .68 Carbine, and A-5 Models. They will NOT fit the Model 98. The Pro-Carbine is a popular rental gun at paintball fields. It is semi-automatic and is known for its durability and reliable function. The Pro-Carbine is also known for its \\"rifle-like\\" forearm grip and Thompson SMG Style Action (even though it's only a Mechanical Semi Automatic). This gives the gun an appearance that is similar to that of a real-life rifle. It is a popular woodsball/scenario marker due to its focused upgradability toward Mil Sim, but is less popular in speedball or Tourney games due to its handling, weight characteristics and slower rate of fire.  Model 98  The Tippmann model 98 is the original version of the 98 custom. One of the workhorses of the Tippmann line, it has been superseded by the 98 Custom and the Custom Pro. The shells were redesigned for the model 98 custom key changes included: * a removable trigger guard (previously part of the shell) * elimination of the gills on the front of the marker * internal changes to the shells to allow the additions of other aftermarket parts namely the reactive trigger system. Special Note: New style thread flatline barrels will fit both the old thread and new thread guns.  Triumph  The .68 caliber Triumph series was launched in 2006 by Tippman Pneumatics; the marker is an entry level model, which departs from the Tippman standard MilSim design. The three basic models include the XL semi-automatic (with basic barrel), XT semi-automatic (adding an expansion chamber, front grip assembly and 11-inch barrel), and eXT Electronic - which operates at fully automatic twelve or fifteen BPS, single-shot, or three round burst. The markers all feature a high impact composite body, double trigger, a center feed neck, in- line bolt system and a 200-round gravity feed hopper.

Early life and family He was born on 9 February 1853, of the Jameson family of Edinburgh, the son of Robert William Jameson (1805‚Äì1868), a Writer to the Signet, and Christian Pringle, daughter of Major-General Pringle of Symington House. Robert William and Christian Jameson had twelve children, of whom Leander Starr was the youngest, born at Stranraer, Wigtownshire (now part of Dumfries and Galloway), in the south-west of Scotland, a great-nephew of Professor Robert Jameson, Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh. Fort's biography of Jameson notes that Starr's \\"chief Gamaliel, however, was a Professor Grant, a man of advanced age, who had been a pupil of his great-uncle, the Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh.\\" Leander Starr Jameson's somewhat unusual name resulted from the fact that his father Robert William Jameson had been rescued from drowning on the morning of his birth by an American traveller, who fished him out of a canal or river with steep banks into which William had fallen while on a walk awaiting the birth of his son. The stranger named Leander Starr was promptly made a godfather of the baby, who was named after him. His father, Robert William, started his career as an advocate in Edinburgh, and was Writer to the Signet, before becoming a playwright, published poet and editor of The Wigtownshire Free Press. A radical and reformist, Robert William Jameson was the author of the dramatic poem Nimrod (1848) and Timoleon, a tragedy in five acts informed by the anti-slavery movement. Timoleon was performed at the Adelphi Theatre in Edinburgh in 1852, and ran to a second edition. In due course, the Jameson family moved to London, living in Chelsea and Kensington. Leander Starr Jameson went to the Godolphin School in Hammersmith, where he did well in both lessons and games prior to his university education. L. S. Jameson was educated for the medical profession at University College Hospital, London, for which he passed his entrance examinations in January 1870. He distinguished himself as a medical student, becoming a Gold Medallist in materia medica. After qualifying as a doctor, he was made Resident Medical Officer at University College Hospital (M.R.C.S. 1875; M.D. 1877). After acting as house physician, house surgeon and demonstrator of anatomy, and showing promise of a successful professional career in London, his health broke down from overwork in 1878, and he went out to South Africa and settled down in practice at Kimberley. There he rapidly acquired a great reputation as a medical man, and, besides numbering President Kruger and the Matabele chief Lobengula among his patients, came much into contact with Cecil Rhodes. Jameson was for some time the inDuna of the Matabele king's favourite regiment, the Imbeza. Lobengula expressed his delight with Jameson's successful medical treatment of his gout by honouring him with the rare status of inDuna. Although Jameson was a white man, he underwent the initiation ceremonies linked with this honour. Jameson's status as an inDuna gave him advantages, and in 1888 he successfully exerted his influence with Lobengula to induce the chieftain to grant the concessions to the agents of Rhodes which led to the formation of the British South Africa Company; and when the company proceeded to open up Mashonaland, Jameson abandoned his medical practice and joined the pioneer expedition of 1890. From this time his fortunes were bound up with Rhodes' schemes in the north. Immediately after the pioneer column had occupied Mashonaland, Jameson, with F. C. Selous and A. R. Colquhoun, went east to Manicaland and was instrumental in securing the greater part of the country, to which Portugal was laying claim, for the Chartered Company. In 1891 Jameson succeeded Colquhoun as Administrator of Mashonaland. In 1893, Jameson was a key figure in the First Matabele War and involved in incidents that led to the massacre of the Shangani Patrol. Character Jameson's character seems to have inspired a degree of devotion from his contemporaries. Elizabeth Longford writes of him, \\"Whatever one felt about him or his projects when he was not there, one could not help falling for the man in his presence.... People attached themselves to Jameson with extraordinary fervour, the more extraordinary because he made no effort to feed it. He affected an attitude of tough cynicism towards life, literature and any articulate form of idealism, particularly towards the hero- worship which he himself excited ... When he died The Times estimated that his astonishing personal hold over his followers had been equalled only by that of Parnell, the Irish patriot.\\" Vanity Fair Longford also notes that Rudyard Kipling wrote the poem \\"If‚Äî\\" with Leander Starr Jameson in mind as an inspiration for the characteristics he recommended young people to live by (notably Kipling's son, to whom the poem is addressed in the last lines). Longford writes, \\"Jameson was later to be the inspiration and hero of Rudyard Kipling's poem, If...\\". Direct evidence that the poem \\"If‚Äî\\" was written about Jameson is available also in Rudyard Kipling's autobiography in which Kipling writes that \\"If‚Äî\\" was \\"drawn from Jameson's character.\\" In 1895, Jameson led about 500 of his countrymen in what became known as the Jameson Raid against the Boers in southern Africa. The Jameson Raid was later cited by Winston Churchill as a major factor in bringing about the Boer War of 1899 to 1902. But the story as recounted in Britain was quite different. The British defeat was interpreted as a victory and Jameson was portrayed as a daring hero. The poem celebrates heroism, dignity, stoicism and courage in the face of the disaster of the failed Jameson Raid, for which he was wrongfully made a scapegoat. Jameson's persuasive character, what became known later as 'the Jameson charm', was described in some detail by , who writes of his restless, logical and sagacious temperament in this way: > ... It was not his wont to talk at length, nor was he, unless exceptionally > interested, a good listener. He was so logical and so quick to grasp a > situation, that he would often cut short exposition by some forcible remark > or personal raillery that would all too often quite disconcert the speaker. > Despite his adventurous career, mere reminiscences obviously bored him; he > was always for movement, for some betterment of present or future > conditions, and in discussion he was a master of the art of persuasion, > unconsciously creating in those around him a latent desire to follow, if he > would lead. The source of such persuasive influence eludes analysis, and, > like the mystery of leadership, is probably more psychic than mental. In > this latter respect, Jameson was splendidly equipped; he had greater power > of concentration, of logical reasoning, and of rapid diagnosis, while on his > lighter side he was brilliant in repartee and in the exercise of a badinage > that was both cynical and personal... ... He wrapped himself in cynicism as > with a cloak, not only to protect himself against his own quick human > sympathy, but to conceal the austere standard of duty and honour that he > always set to himself. He was ever trying to hide from his friends his real > attitude towards life, and the high estimate he placed upon accepted ethical > values... He was essentially a patriot who sought for himself neither > wealth, nor power, nor fame, nor leisure, nor even an easy anchorage for > reflection. The wide sphere of his work and achievements, and the accepted > dominion of his personality and his influence were both based upon his > adherence to the principle of always subordinating personal considerations > to the work in hand, upon the loyalty of his service to big ideals. His > whole life seems to illustrate the truth of the saying that in self-regard > and self-centredness there is no profit, and that only in sacrificing > himself for impersonal aims can a man save his soul and benefit his fellow > men. A less flattering view is given in Antony Thomas's Rhodes (1996), in which Jameson is portrayed as unscrupulous. The Jameson Raid Arrest of Jameson after the raid ‚Äì Petit Parisien 1896 Matabeleland, 1887 In 1895, Jameson assembled a private army outside the Transvaal in preparation for the violent overthrow of the Boer government. The idea was to foment unrest among foreign workers (Uitlanders) in the territory, and use the outbreak of open revolt as an excuse to invade and annex the territory. In November 1895, a piece of territory of strategic importance, the Pitsani Strip, part of the Bechuanaland Protectorate and bordering the Transvaal, was ceded to the British South Africa Company by the Colonial Office, overtly for the protection of a railway running through the territory. Cecil Rhodes, the Prime Minister of the Cape Colony and managing director of the Company was eager to bring South Africa under British dominion, and encouraged the disenfranchised Uitlanders of the Boer republics to resist Afrikaner domination. Rhodes hoped that the intervention of the Company's private army could spark an Uitlander uprising, leading to the overthrow of the Transvaal government. Rhodes' forces were assembled in the Pitsani Strip for this purpose. Joseph Chamberlain informed Salisbury on Boxing Day that an uprising was expected, and was aware that an invasion would be launched, but was not sure when. The subsequent Jameson Raid was a debacle, leading to the invading force's surrender. Chamberlain, at Highbury Hall, his home in Birmingham, received a secret telegram from the Colonial Office on 31 December informing him of the beginning of the Raid. Though sympathetic to the ultimate goals of the Raid, Chamberlain was uncomfortable with the timing of the invasion and remarked \\"if this succeeds it will ruin me. I'm going up to London to crush it\\". He swiftly travelled by train to the Colonial Office, ordering Sir Hercules Robinson, Governor of the Cape Colony, to repudiate the actions of Jameson and warned Rhodes that the Company's Charter would be in danger if it were discovered that the Cape Prime Minister were involved in the Raid. The prisoners were returned to London for trial, and the Transvaal government received considerable compensation from the Company. Jameson was tried in England for leading the raid; during that time he was lionised by the press and London society. The Jameson Raid trial The Jameson Raiders arrived in England at the end of February, 1896 to face prosecution under the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870 styled \\"R. v Jameson, Willoughby and others\\".The National Archives: \\"Queen's Bench: R v Leander Starr Jameson, Sir John Christopher Willoughby Bt, Henry...\\" TS 36/102 There were some months of investigations initially held at Bow Street, following which the \\"trial at bar\\" (a legal procedure reserved only for very important cases) began on 20 June 1896, at the High Court of Judicature. The trial lasted seven days, following which Dr Jameson was \\"found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment as a first-class misdemeanant for fifteen months. He was, however, released from Holloway in the following December on account of illness.\\" During the trial of Jameson, Rhodes' solicitor, Bourchier Hawksley, refused to produce cablegrams that had passed between Rhodes and his agents in London during November and December 1895. According to Hawksley, these demonstrated that the Colonial Office 'influenced the actions of those in South Africa' who embarked on the Raid, and even that Chamberlain had transferred control of the Pitsani Strip to facilitate an invasion. Nine days before the Raid, Chamberlain had asked his Assistant Under-Secretary to encourage Rhodes to \\"hurry up\\" because of the developing Venezuela Crisis of 1895. The conduct of Dr Jameson during the trial was graphically described by , an eyewitness account of her observations during the Jameson Raid trial. She wrote: Jameson was sentenced to fifteen months in gaol, but was soon pardoned. In June 1896, Chamberlain, British Colonial Secretary of the day, offered his resignation to Lord Salisbury, having shown the Prime Minister one or more of the cablegrams implicating him in the Raid's planning. Salisbury refused to accept the offer, possibly reluctant to lose the government's most popular figure. Salisbury reacted aggressively in support of Chamberlain, supporting the Colonial Secretary's threat to withdraw the Company's charter if the cablegrams were revealed. Accordingly, Rhodes refused to reveal the cablegrams, and as no evidence was produced showing that Chamberlain was complicit in the Raid's planning, the Select Committee appointed to investigate the events surrounding the Raid had no choice but to absolve Chamberlain of all responsibility. Jameson had been Administrator General for Matabeleland at the time of the Raid and his intrusion into Transvaal depleted Matabeleland of many of its troops and left the whole territory vulnerable. Seizing on this weakness, and a discontent with the British South Africa Company, the Matabele revolted in March 1896 in what is now celebrated in Zimbabwe as the First War of Independence ‚Äì the Second Matabele War. Hundreds of white settlers were killed within the first few weeks and many more would die over the next year and a half at the hands of both the Matabele and the Shona. With few troops to support them, the settlers had to quickly build a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own. Against over 50,000 Matabele held up in their stronghold of the Matobo Hills as the settlers mounted patrols under Burnham, Baden-Powell, and Selous. After the Matabele laid down their arms, the war continued until October 1897 in Mashonaland. Later political career Despite the Raid, Jameson had a successful political life following the invasion, receiving many honours in later life. In 1903 Jameson was put forward as the leader of the Progressive (British) Party in the Cape Colony. When the party was successful he served as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony from 1904 to 1908. His government was unique in Cape history, as being the only Ministry to be composed exclusively of British politicians. During the Conference of Colonial Premiers held in London in March 1907, he was made a Privy Counsellor. He served as the leader of the Unionist Party (South Africa) from its founding in 1910 until 1912. Jameson was created a baronet in 1911 and returned to England in 1912. According to Rudyard Kipling, his famous poem \\"If‚Äî\\" was written in celebration of Jameson's personal qualities at overcoming the difficulties of the Raid, for which he largely took the blame, though Joseph Chamberlain, British Colonial Secretary of the day, was, according to some historians, implicated in the events of the raid. Jameson is buried alongside Rhodes at Malindidzimu Hill, a granite hill in the Matobo National Park, south of Bulawayo. It was designated by Cecil Rhodes as the resting place for those who served Great Britain well in Africa. Sir Leander Starr Jameson, 1st Bt., died on the afternoon of Monday, 26 November 1917, at his home, 2 Great Cumberland Place, Hyde Park, in London. His body was laid in a vault at Kensal Green Cemetery on 29 November 1917, where it remained until the end of the First World War. Biographies, portraits and honours Jameson Hall and Jammie Plaza, the focal point of the University of Cape Town, were named in his honour. Jameson's life is the subject of a number of biographies, including The Life of Jameson by Ian Colvin (1922, Vol. 1 and 1923, Vol. 2), Dr. Jameson by G. Seymour Fort (1918), and The If Man by Chris Ash (2012). The Jameson Raid has been the subject of numerous articles and books, and remains a fascinating historical riddle more than one hundred years after the events of the Raid took place. There are three portraits of Jameson in the National Portrait Gallery in London. One of these was by one of his elder brothers, Middleton Jameson, R.A. (1851‚Äì1919), otherwise known as 'Midge', to whom he was devoted. Leander Starr Jameson was awarded the KCMG, the CB, the Freedom of the City of London, Freedom of the City of Manchester, and Freedom of the City of Edinburgh for services to the British Empire. During the colonial period, the Zambian town of Chipata was named \\"Fort Jameson\\" in Jameson's honour. Later historical documents To this day, the events surrounding Jameson's involvement in the Jameson Raid, being in general somewhat out of character with his prior history, the rest of his life and successful later political career, remain something of an enigma to historians. In 2002, The Van Riebeck Society published Sir Graham Bower‚Äôs Secret History of the Jameson Raid and the South African Crisis, 1895‚Äì1902, adding to growing historical evidence that the imprisonment and judgment upon the Raiders at the time of their trial was an underhand move by the British government, a result of political manoeuvres by Joseph Chamberlain and his staff to hide his own involvement and knowledge of the Raid. In his review of Sir Graham Bower‚Äôs Secret History... Alan Cousins, notes that, \\"A number of major themes and concerns emerge\\" from Bower's history, \\"... perhaps the most poignant being Sir Graham Bower's accounts of his being made a scapegoat in the aftermath of the raid: 'since a scapegoat was wanted I was willing to serve my country in that capacity'.\\" Cousins notes of Bower that 'a very clear sense of his rigid code of honour is plain, and a conviction that not only unity, peace and happiness in South Africa, but also the peace of Europe would be endangered if he told the truth. He believed that, as he had given Rhodes his word not to divulge certain private conversations, he had to abide by that, while at the same time he was convinced that it would be very damaging to Britain if he said anything to the parliamentary committee to show the close involvement of Sir Hercules Robinson and Joseph Chamberlain in their disreputable encouragement of those plotting an uprising in Johannesburg.' Finally, Cousins observes that, \\"...in his reflections, Bower has a particularly damning judgement on Chamberlain, whom he accuses of 'brazen lying' to parliament, and of what amounted to forgery in the documents made public for the inquiry. In the report of the committee, Bower was found culpable of complicity, while no blame was attached to Chamberlain or Robinson. His name was never cleared during his lifetime, and Bower was never reinstated to what he believed should be his proper position in the colonial service: he was, in effect, demoted to the post of colonial secretary in Mauritius. The bitterness and sense of betrayal he felt come through very clearly in his comments.\\" Speculation on the true nature of the behind-the-scenes story of the Jameson Raid has therefore continued for more than a hundred years after the events, and carries on to this day.

Thermal equilibrium obeys the zeroth law of thermodynamics. A system is said to be in thermal equilibrium with itself if the temperature within the system is spatially uniform and temporally constant. Systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are always in thermal equilibrium, but the converse is not always true. If the connection between the systems allows transfer of energy as heat but does not allow transfer of matter or transfer of energy as work, the two systems may reach thermal equilibrium without reaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Two varieties of thermal equilibrium =Relation of thermal equilibrium between two thermally connected bodies The relation of thermal equilibrium is an instance of equilibrium between two bodies, which means that it refers to transfer through a selectively permeable partition, the contact path.M√ºnster, A. (1970), p.49. For the relation of thermal equilibrium, the contact path is permeable only to heat; it does not permit the passage of matter or work; it is called a diathermal connection. According to Lieb and Yngvason, the essential meaning of the relation of thermal equilibrium includes that it is reflexive and symmetric. It is not included in the essential meaning whether it is or is not transitive. After discussing the semantics of the definition, they postulate a substantial physical axiom, that they call the \\"zeroth law of thermodynamics\\", that thermal equilibrium is a transitive relation. They comment that the equivalence classes of systems so established are called isotherms.Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999). The physics and mathematics of the second law of thermodynamics, Physics Reports, 314: 1‚Äì96, p. 55‚Äì56. Internal thermal equilibrium of an isolated body Thermal equilibrium of a body in itself refers to the body when it is isolated. The background is that no heat enters or leaves it, and that it is allowed unlimited time to settle under its own intrinsic characteristics. When it is completely settled, so that macroscopic change is no longer detectable, it is in its own thermal equilibrium. It is not implied that it is necessarily in other kinds of internal equilibrium. For example, it is possible that a body might reach internal thermal equilibrium but not be in internal chemical equilibrium; glass is an example.Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), pp. 249‚Äì251. One may imagine an isolated system, initially not in its own state of internal thermal equilibrium. It could be subjected to a fictive thermodynamic operation of partition into two subsystems separated by nothing, no wall. One could then consider the possibility of transfers of energy as heat between the two subsystems. A long time after the fictive partition operation, the two subsystems will reach a practically stationary state, and so be in the relation of thermal equilibrium with each other. Such an adventure could be conducted in indefinitely many ways, with different fictive partitions. All of them will result in subsystems that could be shown to be in thermal equilibrium with each other, testing subsystems from different partitions. For this reason, an isolated system, initially not its own state of internal thermal equilibrium, but left for a long time, practically always will reach a final state which may be regarded as one of internal thermal equilibrium. Such a final state is one of spatial uniformity or homogeneity of temperature.Planck, M., (1897/1903), p. 3. The existence of such states is a basic postulate of classical thermodynamics.Tisza, L. (1966), p. 108.Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 20. This postulate is sometimes, but not often, called the minus first law of thermodynamics. A notable exception exists for isolated quantum systems which are many-body localized and which never reach internal thermal equilibrium. Thermal contact Heat can flow into or out of a closed system by way of thermal conduction or of thermal radiation to or from a thermal reservoir, and when this process is effecting net transfer of heat, the system is not in thermal equilibrium. While the transfer of energy as heat continues, the system's temperature can be changing. Bodies prepared with separately uniform temperatures, then put into purely thermal communication with each other If bodies are prepared with separately microscopically stationary states, and are then put into purely thermal connection with each other, by conductive or radiative pathways, they will be in thermal equilibrium with each other just when the connection is followed by no change in either body. But if initially they are not in a relation of thermal equilibrium, heat will flow from the hotter to the colder, by whatever pathway, conductive or radiative, is available, and this flow will continue until thermal equilibrium is reached and then they will have the same temperature. One form of thermal equilibrium is radiative exchange equilibrium.Prevost, P. (1791). M√©moire sur l'equilibre du feu. Journal de Physique (Paris), vol. 38 pp. 314-322.Planck, M. (1914), p. 40. Two bodies, each with its own uniform temperature, in solely radiative connection, no matter how far apart, or what partially obstructive, reflective, or refractive, obstacles lie in their path of radiative exchange, not moving relative to one another, will exchange thermal radiation, in net the hotter transferring energy to the cooler, and will exchange equal and opposite amounts just when they are at the same temperature. In this situation, Kirchhoff's law of equality of radiative emissivity and absorptivity and the Helmholtz reciprocity principle are in play. Change of internal state of an isolated system If an initially isolated physical system, without internal walls that establish adiabatically isolated subsystems, is left long enough, it will usually reach a state of thermal equilibrium in itself, in which its temperature will be uniform throughout, but not necessarily a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, if there is some structural barrier that can prevent some possible processes in the system from reaching equilibrium; glass is an example. Classical thermodynamics in general considers idealized systems that have reached internal equilibrium, and idealized transfers of matter and energy between them. An isolated physical system may be inhomogeneous, or may be composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls. If an initially inhomogeneous physical system, without internal walls, is isolated by a thermodynamic operation, it will in general over time change its internal state. Or if it is composed of several subsystems separated from each other by walls, it may change its state after a thermodynamic operation that changes its walls. Such changes may include change of temperature or spatial distribution of temperature, by changing the state of constituent materials. A rod of iron, initially prepared to be hot at one end and cold at the other, when isolated, will change so that its temperature becomes uniform all along its length; during the process, the rod is not in thermal equilibrium until its temperature is uniform. In a system prepared as a block of ice floating in a bath of hot water, and then isolated, the ice can melt; during the melting, the system is not in thermal equilibrium; but eventually its temperature will become uniform; the block of ice will not re-form. A system prepared as a mixture of petrol vapour and air can be ignited by a spark and produce carbon dioxide and water; if this happens in an isolated system, it will increase the temperature of the system, and during the increase, the system is not in thermal equilibrium; but eventually the system will settle to a uniform temperature. Such changes in isolated systems are irreversible in the sense that while such a change will occur spontaneously whenever the system is prepared in the same way, the reverse change will practically never occur spontaneously within the isolated system; this is a large part of the content of the second law of thermodynamics. Truly perfectly isolated systems do not occur in nature, and always are artificially prepared. In a gravitational field One may consider a system contained in a very tall adiabatically isolating vessel with rigid walls initially containing a thermally heterogeneous distribution of material, left for a long time under the influence of a steady gravitational field, along its tall dimension, due to an outside body such as the earth. It will settle to a state of uniform temperature throughout, though not of uniform pressure or density, and perhaps containing several phases. It is then in internal thermal equilibrium and even in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means that all local parts of the system are in mutual radiative exchange equilibrium. This means that the temperature of the system is spatially uniform. This is so in all cases, including those of non-uniform external force fields. For an externally imposed gravitational field, this may be proved in macroscopic thermodynamic terms, by the calculus of variations, using the method of Langrangian multipliers.Gibbs, J.W. (1876/1878), pp. 144-150.ter Haar, D., Wergeland, H. (1966), pp. 127‚Äì130.M√ºnster, A. (1970), pp. 309‚Äì310.Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 254-256.Akmaev, R.A. (2008).

Distinctions between thermal and thermodynamic equilibria There is an important distinction between thermal and thermodynamic equilibrium. According to M√ºnster (1970), in states of thermodynamic equilibrium, the state variables of a system do not change at a measurable rate. Moreover, \\"The proviso 'at a measurable rate' implies that we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions.\\" Also, a state of thermodynamic equilibrium can be described by fewer macroscopic variables than any other state of a given body of matter. A single isolated body can start in a state which is not one of thermodynamic equilibrium, and can change till thermodynamic equilibrium is reached. Thermal equilibrium is a relation between two bodies or closed systems, in which transfers are allowed only of energy and take place through a partition permeable to heat, and in which the transfers have proceeded till the states of the bodies cease to change.M√ºnster, A. (1970), pp. 6, 22, 52. An explicit distinction between 'thermal equilibrium' and 'thermodynamic equilibrium' is made by C.J. Adkins. He allows that two systems might be allowed to exchange heat but be constrained from exchanging work; they will naturally exchange heat till they have equal temperatures, and reach thermal equilibrium, but in general will not be in thermodynamic equilibrium. They can reach thermodynamic equilibrium when they are allowed also to exchange work.Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), pp. 6‚Äì7. Another explicit distinction between 'thermal equilibrium' and 'thermodynamic equilibrium' is made by B. C. Eu. He considers two systems in thermal contact, one a thermometer, the other a system in which several irreversible processes are occurring. He considers the case in which, over the time scale of interest, it happens that both the thermometer reading and the irreversible processes are steady. Then there is thermal equilibrium without thermodynamic equilibrium. Eu proposes consequently that the zeroth law of thermodynamics can be considered to apply even when thermodynamic equilibrium is not present; also he proposes that if changes are occurring so fast that a steady temperature cannot be defined, then \\"it is no longer possible to describe the process by means of a thermodynamic formalism. In other words, thermodynamics has no meaning for such a process.\\"Eu, B.C. (2002). Generalized Thermodynamics. The Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes and Generalized Hydrodynamics, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, , page 13. Thermal equilibrium of planets A planet is in thermal equilibrium when the incident energy reaching it (typically the solar irradiance from its parent star) is equal to the infrared energy radiated away to space.

It was discovered in October 1852 by John Russell Hind. T Tauri appears from Earth amongst the Hyades cluster, not far from Œµ Tauri; but it is actually 420 light years behind it and was not formed with the rest of them. Faint nebulosity around T Tauri is a Herbig‚ÄìHaro object called Burnham's Nebula or HH 255. Like all T Tauri stars, it is very young, being only a million years old. Its distance from Earth is about 460 light years, and its apparent magnitude varies unpredictably from about 9.3 to 14.www.DavidDarling.info: T Tauri The T Tauri system consists of at least three stars, only one of which is visible at optical wavelengths; the other two shine in the infrared and one of them also emits radio waves. Through VLA radio observations, it was found that the young star (the \\"T Tauri star\\" itself) dramatically changed its orbit after a close encounter with one of its companions and may have been ejected from the system. A widefield image showing the reflection nebula and clouds of dust. Credit: Adam Block/Mount Lemmon SkyCenter/University of Arizona. Physically nearby is NGC 1555, a reflection nebula known as Hind's Nebula or Hind's Variable Nebula. It is illuminated by T Tauri, and thus also varies in brightness. The nebula NGC 1554 was likewise associated with T Tauri and was observed in 1868 by Otto Wilhelm von Struve,www.DavidDarling.info: Struve‚Äôs Lost Nebula (NGC 1554) but soon disappeared or perhaps never existed, and is known as \\"Struve's Lost Nebula\\". The T Tauri wind, so named because this young star is currently in this stage, is a phase of stellar development between the accretion of material from the slowing rotating material of a solar nebula and the ignition of the hydrogen that has agglomerated into the protostar. A protostar is the denser parts of a cloud core, typically with a mass around 104 solar masses in the form of gas and dust, that collapses under its own weight/gravity, and continues to attract matter. The protostar, at first, only has about 1% of its final mass. But the envelope of the star continues to grow as infalling material is accreted. After a few million years, thermonuclear fusion begins in its core, then a strong stellar wind is produced which stops the infall of new mass. The protostar is now considered a young star since its mass is fixed, and its future evolution is now set.

Books on cryptography have been published sporadically and with highly variable quality for a long time. This is despite the tempting, though superficial, paradox that secrecy is of the essence in sending confidential messages ‚Äî see Kerckhoffs' principle. In contrast, the revolutions in cryptography and secure communications since the 1970s are well covered in the available literature. Early history An early example of a book about cryptography was a Roman work, now lost and known only by references. Many early cryptographic works were esoteric, mystical, and/or reputation- promoting; cryptography being mysterious, there was much opportunity for such things. At least one work by Trithemius was banned by the Catholic Church and put on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum as being about black magic or witchcraft. Many writers claimed to have invented unbreakable ciphers. None were, though it sometimes took a long while to establish this. In the 19th century, the general standard improved somewhat (e.g., works by Auguste Kerckhoffs, Friedrich Kasiski, and √âtienne Bazeries). Colonel Parker Hitt and William Friedman in the early 20th century also wrote books on cryptography. These authors, and others, mostly abandoned any mystical or magical tone. Open literature versus classified literature With the invention of radio, much of military communications went wireless, allowing the possibility of enemy interception much more readily than tapping into a landline. This increased the need to protect communications. By the end of World War I, cryptography and its literature began to be officially limited. One exception was The American Black Chamber by Herbert Yardley, which gave some insight into American cryptologic success stories, including the Zimmermann telegram and the breaking of Japanese codes during the Washington Naval Conference.

The most significant work to be published on cryptography in this period is undoubtedly David Kahn's The Codebreakers, which was published at a time (mid-1960s) when virtually no information on the modern practice of cryptography was available.The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing by David Kahn, internal CIA book review by Roger Pineau, ca.1967, released to public 1996 Kahn has said that over ninety percent of its content was previously unpublished. The book caused serious concern at the NSA despite its lack of coverage of specific modern cryptographic practice, so much so that after failing to prevent the book being published, NSA staff were informed to not even acknowledge the existence of the book if asked. In the US military, mere possession of a copy by cryptographic personnel was grounds for some considerable suspicion. Perhaps the single greatest importance of the book was the impact it had on the next generation of cryptographers. Whitfield Diffie has made comments in interviews about the effect it had on him. Cryptographic environment/context or security * Schneier, Bruce ‚Äì Secrets and Lies, Wiley, , a discussion of the context within which cryptography and cryptosystems work. Practical Cryptography also includes some contextual material in the discussion of crypto system design. * Schneier, Bruce ‚Äì Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World, Wiley, * Anderson, Ross ‚Äì Security Engineering, Wiley, (online version), advanced coverage of computer security issues, including cryptography.

Includes details on Wi-Fi Protected Access (which is based on the IEEE 802.11i specification). The book is slightly out of date as it was written before IEEE 802.11i was finalized but much of the content is still useful for those who want to find out how encryption and authentication is done in a Wi-Fi network.

She is notable for having taught many of the leading composers and musicians of the 20th century. She also performed occasionally as a pianist and organist.Lennox Berkeley, Sir, Peter Dickinson, Lennox Berkeley and Friends: Writings, Letters and Interviews, page 45 From a musical family, she achieved early honours as a student at the Conservatoire de Paris but, believing that she had no particular talent as a composer, she gave up writing music and became a teacher. In that capacity, she influenced generations of young composers, especially those from the United States and other English-speaking countries. Among her students were those who became leading composers, soloists, arrangers, and conductors, including Gra≈ºyna Bacewicz, Daniel Barenboim, ƒ∞dil Biret, Elliott Carter, Aaron Copland, David Diamond, John Eliot Gardiner, Philip Glass, Roy Harris, Quincy Jones, Michel Legrand, Dinu Lipatti, Igor Markevitch, Darius Milhaud, Astor Piazzolla, Lalo Schifrin, Virgil Thomson. Boulanger taught in the US and England, working with music academies including the Juilliard School, the Yehudi Menuhin School, the Longy School, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music, but her principal base for most of her life was her family's flat in Paris, where she taught for most of the seven decades from the start of her career until her death at the age of 92. Boulanger was the first woman to conduct many major orchestras in America and Europe, including the BBC Symphony, Boston Symphony, Hall√©, New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia orchestras. She conducted several world premieres, including works by Copland and Stravinsky. Biography=Early life and education Nadia Boulanger was born in Paris on 16 September 1887, to French composer and pianist Ernest Boulanger (1815‚Äì1900) and his wife Raissa Myshetskaya (1856‚Äì1935), a Russian princess, who descended from St. Mikhail Tchernigovsky. Ernest Boulanger had studied at the Paris Conservatoire and, in 1835 at the age of 20, won the coveted Prix de Rome for composition. He wrote comic operas and incidental music for plays, but was most widely known for his choral music. He achieved distinction as a director of choral groups, teacher of voice, and a member of choral competition juries. After years of rejection, in 1872 he was appointed to the Paris Conservatoire as professor of singing. Raissa qualified as a home tutor (or governess) in 1873. According to Ernest, he and Raissa met in Russia in 1873, and she followed him back to Paris. She joined his voice class at the Conservatoire in 1876, and they were married in Russia in 1877. Ernest and Raissa had a daughter, Ernestine Mina Juliette, who died as an infant before Nadia was born on her father's 72nd birthday. Through her early years, although both parents were very active musically, Nadia would get upset by hearing music and hide until it stopped. In 1892, when Nadia was five, Raissa became pregnant again. During the pregnancy, Nadia's response to music changed drastically. \\"One day I heard a fire bell. Instead of crying out and hiding, I rushed to the piano and tried to reproduce the sounds. My parents were amazed.\\" After this, Boulanger paid great attention to the singing lessons her father gave, and began to study the rudiments of music. Her sister, named Marie‚ÄìJuliette Olga but known as Lili, was born in 1893, when Nadia was six. When Ernest brought Nadia home from their friends' house, before she was allowed to see her mother or Lili, he made her promise solemnly to be responsible for the new baby's welfare. He urged her to take part in her sister's care. From the age of seven, Nadia studied hard in preparation for her Conservatoire entrance exams, sitting in on their classes and having private lessons with its teachers. Lili often stayed in the room for these lessons, sitting quietly and listening. In 1896, the nine-year-old Nadia entered the Conservatoire. She studied there with Faur√© and others. She came in third in the 1897 solf√®ge competition, and subsequently worked hard to win first prize in 1898. She took private lessons from Louis Vierne and Alexandre Guilmant. During this period, she also received religious instruction to become an observant Catholic, taking her First Communion on 4 May 1899. The Catholic religion remained important to her for the rest of her life. In 1900 her father Ernest died, and money became a problem for the family. Raissa had an extravagant lifestyle, and the royalties she received from performances of Ernest's music were insufficient to live on permanently. Nadia continued to work hard at the Conservatoire to become a teacher and be able to contribute to her family's support. In 1903, Nadia won the Conservatoire's first prize in harmony; she continued to study for years, although she had begun to earn money through organ and piano performances. She studied composition with Gabriel Faur√© and, in the 1904 competitions, she came first in three categories: organ, accompagnement au piano and fugue (composition). At her accompagnement exam, Boulanger met Raoul Pugno, a renowned French pianist, organist and composer, who subsequently took an interest in her career. In the autumn of 1904, Nadia began to teach from the family apartment, at 36 rue Ballu. In addition to the private lessons she held there, Boulanger started holding a Wednesday afternoon group class in analysis and sightsinging. She continued these almost to her death. This class was followed by her famous \\"at homes\\", salons at which students could mingle with professional musicians and Boulanger's other friends from the arts, such as Igor Stravinsky, Paul Val√©ry, Faur√©, and others. Professional life After leaving the Conservatoire in 1904 and before her sister's untimely death in 1918, Boulanger was a keen composer, encouraged by both Pugno and Faur√©. Caroline Potter, writing in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, says of Boulanger's music: \\"Her musical language is often highly chromatic (though always tonally based), and Debussy's influence is apparent.\\" Her goal was to win the First Grand Prix de Rome as her father had done, and she worked tirelessly towards it in addition to her increasing teaching and performing commitments. She first submitted work for judging in 1906, but failed to make it past the first round. In 1907 she progressed to the final round but again did not win. In late 1907 she was appointed to teach elementary piano and accompagnement au piano at the newly created Conservatoire Femina-Musica. She was also appointed as assistant to Henri Dallier, the professor of harmony at the Conservatoire. In the 1908 Prix de Rome competition, Boulanger caused a stir by submitting an instrumental fugue rather than the required vocal fugue. The subject was taken up by the national and international newspapers, and was resolved only when the French Minister of Public Information decreed that Boulanger's work be judged on its musical merit alone. She won the Second Grand Prix for her cantata, La Sir√®ne. In 1908, as well as performing piano duets in public concerts, Boulanger and Pugno collaborated on composing a song cycle, Les Heures claires, which was well-received enough to encourage them to continue working together. Still hoping for a Grand Prix de Rome, Boulanger entered the 1909 competition but failed to win a place in the final round. Later that year, her sister Lili, then sixteen, announced to the family her intention to become a composer and win the Prix de Rome herself. In 1910, Annette Dieudonn√© became a student of Boulanger's, continuing with her for the next fourteen years. When her studies ended, she began teaching Boulanger's students the rudiments of music and solf√®ge. She was Boulanger's close friend and assistant for the rest of her life. Boulanger attended the premiere of Diaghilev's ballet The Firebird in Paris, with music by Stravinsky. She immediately recognised the young composer's genius and began a lifelong friendship with him. In April 1912, Nadia Boulanger made her debut as a conductor, leading the Soci√©t√© des Matin√©es Musicales orchestra. They performed her 1908 cantata La Sir√®ne, two of her songs, and Pugno's Concertst√ºck for piano and orchestra. The composer played as soloist. With the advent of war in Europe in 1914, public programs were reduced, and Boulanger had to put her performing and conducting on hold. She continued to teach privately and to assist Dallier at the Conservatoire. Nadia was drawn into Lili's expanding war work, and by the end of the year, the sisters had organised a sizable charity, the Comit√© Franco-Am√©ricain du Conservatoire National de Musique et de D√©clamation. It supplied food, clothing, money, letters from home, etc. to soldiers who had been musicians before the war. Weakened by her work during the war, Lili began to suffer ill health. She died in March 1918. Life after Lili's death, 1918‚Äì21 In 1919, Boulanger performed in more than twenty concerts, often programming her own music and that of her sister. Since the Conservatoire Femina-Musica had closed during the war, Alfred Cortot and Auguste Mangeot founded a new music school in Paris, which opened later that year, the √âcole normale de musique de Paris. Boulanger was invited by Cortot to join the school, where she ended up teaching classes in harmony, counterpoint, musical analysis, organ and composition. Mangeot also asked Boulanger to contribute articles of music criticism to his paper Le Monde Musical, and she occasionally provided articles for this, and other newspapers, for the rest of her life, though she never felt at ease setting her opinions down for posterity in this way. In 1920, Boulanger began to compose again, writing a series of songs to words by Camille Mauclair. In 1921, she performed at two concerts in support of women's rights, at both of which music by Lili was programmed. Later in life she claimed never to have been involved with feminism, and that women should not have the right to vote as they \\"lacked the necessary political sophistication.\\" American School at Fontainebleau, 1921‚Äì1935 Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau In the summer of 1921 the French Music School for Americans opened in Fontainebleau, with Boulanger listed on the programme as a professor of harmony. Her close friend Isidor Philipp headed the piano departments of both the Paris Conservatory and the new Fontainebleau School and was an important draw for American students. She inaugurated the custom, which would continue for the rest of her life, of inviting the best students to her summer residence at Gargenville one weekend for lunch and dinner. Among the students attending the first year at Fontainebleau was Aaron Copland. Boulanger's unrelenting schedule of teaching, performing, composing, writing letters etc. started to take its toll on her health; she had frequent migraines and toothaches. She stopped writing as a critic for Le Monde musical as she could not attend the requisite concerts. To maintain the living standard for her and her mother, she concentrated on teaching. This was her most lucrative source of income. Faur√© believed she was mistaken to stop composing, but she told him, \\"If there is one thing of which I am certain, it is that I wrote useless music.\\" In 1924, Walter Damrosch, Arthur Judson and the New York Symphony Society arranged for Boulanger to tour the US towards the end of the year. She set sail on the Cunard flagship on Christmas Eve. The ship arrived on New Year's Eve in New York after an extremely rough crossing. During this tour, she performed solo organ works, pieces by Lili, and premiered Copland's new Symphony for Organ and Orchestra, which he had written for her. She returned to France on 28 February 1925. Later that year, Boulanger approached the publisher Schirmer to enquire if they would be interested in publishing her methods of teaching music to children. When nothing came of this, she abandoned trying to write about her ideas. Gershwin visited Boulanger in 1927, asking for lessons in composition. They spoke for half an hour after which Boulanger announced, \\"I can teach you nothing.\\" Taking this as a compliment, Gershwin repeated the story many times. The Great Depression increased social tensions in France. Days after the Stavisky riots in February 1934, and in the midst of a general strike, Boulanger resumed conducting. She made her Paris debut with the orchestra of the √âcole normale in a programme of Mozart, Bach, and Jean Fran√ßaix. Boulanger's private classes continued; Elliott Carter recalled that students who did not dare to cross Paris through the riots showed only that they did not \\"take music seriously enough\\". By the end of the year, she was conducting the Orchestre Philharmonique de Paris in the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es with a programme of Bach, Monteverdi and Sch√ºtz. Her mother Raissa died in March 1935, after a long decline. This freed Boulanger from some of her ties to Paris, which had prevented her from taking up teaching opportunities in the United States. Touring and recording Boulanger with Igor Stravinsky In 1936, Boulanger substituted for Alfred Cortot in some of his piano masterclasses, coaching the students in Mozart's keyboard works. Later in the year, she traveled to London to broadcast her lecture-recitals for the BBC, as well as to conduct works including Sch√ºtz, Faur√© and Lennox Berkeley. Noted as the first woman to conduct the London Philharmonic Orchestra, she received acclaim for her performances. Boulanger's long-held passion for Monteverdi culminated in her recording six discs of madrigals for HMV in 1937. This brought his music to a new, wider audience. Not all reviewers approved her use of modern instruments. When Hindemith published his The Craft of Musical Composition, Boulanger asked him for permission to translate the text into French, and to add her own comments. Hindemith never responded to her offer. After he fled from Nazi Germany to the United States, they did not discuss the matter further. Late in 1937, Boulanger returned to Britain to broadcast for the BBC and hold her popular lecture-recitals. In November, she became the first woman to conduct a complete concert of the Royal Philharmonic Society in London, which included Faur√©'s Requiem and Monteverdi's Amor (Lamento della ninfa). Describing her concerts, Mangeot wrote, > She never uses a dynamic level louder than mezzo-forte and she takes > pleasure in veiled, murmuring sonorities, from which she nevertheless > obtains great power of expression. She arranges her dynamic levels so as > never to have need of fortissimo ... In 1938, Boulanger returned to the US for a longer tour. She had arranged to give a series of lectures at Radcliffe, Harvard, Wellesley and the Longy School of Music, and to broadcast for NBC. During this tour, she became the first woman to conduct the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In her three months there, she gave over a hundred lecture-recitals, recitals and concerts These included the world premiere of Stravinsky's Dumbarton Oaks Concerto. At that time she was seen by American sculptor Katharine Lane Weems who recorded in her diary, \\"Her voice is surprisingly deep. She is quite slim with an excellent figure and fine features, Her skin is delicate, her hair graying slightly, she wears pince-nez and gesticulates as she becomes excited talking about music.\\"Weems, Katharine Lane, as told to Edward Weeks, Odds Were Against Me: A Memoir, Vantage Press, New York, 1985 p.105 HMV issued two additional Boulanger records in 1938: the Piano Concerto in D by Jean Fran√ßaix, which she conducted; and the Brahms Liebeslieder Waltzes, in which she and Dinu Lipatti were the duo pianists with a vocal ensemble, and (again with Lipatti) a selection of the Brahms Waltzes, Op. 39 for piano four hands. During Boulanger's tour of America the following year, she became the first woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Washington National Symphony Orchestra. She gave 102 lectures in 118 days across the US. Second World War and emigration, 1940‚Äì45 As the Second World War loomed, Boulanger helped her students leave France. She made plans to do so herself. Stravinsky joined her at Gargenville, where they awaited news of the German attack against France. Waiting to leave France till the last moment before the invasion and occupation, Boulanger arrived in New York (via Madrid and Lisbon) on 6 November 1940. After her arrival, Boulanger traveled to the Longy School of Music in Cambridge to give classes in harmony, fugue, counterpoint and advanced composition. In 1942, she also began teaching at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore. Her classes included music history, harmony, counterpoint, fugue, orchestration and composition. Later life in Paris, 1946‚Äì79 Leaving America at the end of 1945, she returned to France in January 1946. There she accepted a position of professor of accompagnement au piano at the Paris Conservatoire. In 1953, she was appointed overall director of the Fontainebleau School. She also continued her touring to other countries. As a long-standing friend of the family (and officially as chapel-master to the Prince of Monaco), Boulanger was asked to organise the music for the wedding of Prince Rainier of Monaco and the American actress, Grace Kelly, in 1956. In 1958, she returned to the US for a six-week tour. She combined broadcasting, lecturing, and making four television films. Also in 1958, she was inducted as an Honorary Member into Sigma Alpha Iota, the international women's music fraternity, by the Gamma Delta chapter at the Crane School of Music in Potsdam, New York. In 1962, she toured Turkey, where she conducted concerts with her young prot√©g√©e Idil Biret. Later that year, she was invited to the White House of the United States by President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline, and in 1966, she was invited to Moscow to jury for the International Tchaikovsky Competition, chaired by Emil Gilels. While in England, she taught at the Yehudi Menuhin School. She also gave lectures at the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music, all of which were broadcast by the BBC. Her eyesight and hearing began to fade toward the end of her life. On 13 August 1977, in advance of her 90th birthday, she was given a surprise birthday celebration at Fontainebleau's English Garden. The school's chef had prepared a large cake, on which was inscribed: \\"1887‚ÄìHappy Birthday to you, Nadia Boulanger‚ÄìFontainebleau, 1977\\". When the cake was served, 90 small white candles floating on the pond illuminated the area. Boulanger's then-prot√©g√©, Emile Naoumoff, performed a piece he had composed for the occasion. Boulanger worked almost until her death in 1979 in Paris. She is buried at the Montmartre Cemetery, with her sister Lili and their parents. Pedagogy 36 rue Ballu, Paris Asked about the difference between a well-made work and a masterpiece, Boulanger replied, > I can tell whether a piece is well-made or not, and I believe that there are > conditions without which masterpieces cannot be achieved, but I also believe > that what defines a masterpiece cannot be pinned down. I won't say that the > criterion for a masterpiece does not exist, but I don't know what it is. She claimed to enjoy all \\"good music\\". According to Lennox Berkeley, \\"A good waltz has just as much value to her as a good fugue, and this is because she judges a work solely on its aesthetic content.\\" \\"She was an admirer of Debussy, and a disciple of Ravel. Although she bore little sympathy for Schoenberg and the Viennese dodecaphonicians, she was an ardent champion of Stravinsky.\\" She insisted on complete attention at all times: \\"Anyone who acts without paying attention to what he is doing is wasting his life. I'd go so far as to say that life is denied by lack of attention, whether it be to cleaning windows or trying to write a masterpiece.\\" In 1920, two of her favourite female students left her to marry. She thought they had betrayed their work with her and their obligation to music. Her attitude to women in music was contradictory: despite Lili's success and her own eminence as a teacher, she held throughout her life that a woman's duty was to be a wife and mother According to Ned Rorem, she would \\"always give the benefit of the doubt to her male students while overtaxing the females\\". She saw teaching as a pleasure, a privilege and a duty: \\"No-one is obliged to give lessons. It poisons your life if you give lessons and it bores you.\\" Boulanger accepted pupils from any background; her only criterion was that they had to want to learn. She treated students differently depending on their ability: her talented students were expected to answer the most rigorous questions and perform well under stress. The less able students, who did not intend to follow a career in music, were treated more leniently, and Michel Legrand claimed that the ones she disliked were graduated with a first prize in one year: \\"The good pupils never got a reward so they stayed. I was [there] for seven years. And I never obtained a first prize\\".\\"Michel Legrand: 'Desprecio la m√∫sica contempor√°nea' \\" 'Michel Legrand: \\"I despise contemporary music\\"] by Carlos Galilea, El Pa√≠s, 9 November 2016 (in Spanish) Each student had to be approached differently: \\"When you accept a new pupil, the first thing is to try to understand what natural gift, what intuitive talent he has. Each individual poses a particular problem.\\" \\"It does not matter what style you use, as long as you use it consistently.\\" Boulanger used a variety of teaching methods, including traditional harmony, score reading at the piano, species counterpoint, analysis, and sight-singing (using fixed-Do solf√®ge). When she first looked at a student's score, she often commented on its relation to the work of a variety of composers: for example, \\"[T]hese measures have the same harmonic progressions as Bach's F major prelude and Chopin's F major Ballade. Can you not come up with something more interesting?\\" Virgil Thomson found this process frustrating: \\"Anyone who allowed her in any piece to tell him what to do next would see that piece ruined before his eyes by the application of routine recipes and bromides from standard repertory.\\" Copland recalled that \\"she had but one all-embracing principle ... the creation of what she called la grande ligne ‚Äì the long line in music.\\" She disapproved of innovation for innovation's sake: \\"When you are writing music of your own, never strain to avoid the obvious.\\" She said, \\"You need an established language and then, within that established language, the liberty to be yourself. It's always necessary to be yourself ‚Äì that is a mark of genius in itself.\\"Driver, Paul: \\"Mademoiselle\\", Tempo, June 1986, Cambridge University Press, pp. 33‚Äì34 She always claimed that she could not bestow creativity onto her students and that she could only help them to become intelligent musicians who understood the craft of composition. \\"I can't provide anyone with inventiveness, nor can I take it away; I can simply provide the liberty to read, to listen, to see, to understand.\\" Only inspiration could make the difference between a well-made piece and an artistic one. She believed that the desire to learn, to become better, was all that was required to achieve ‚Äì always provided the right amount of work was put in. She would quote the examples of Rameau (who wrote his first opera at fifty), Wojtowicz (who became a concert pianist at thirty-one), and Roussel (who had no professional access to music till he was twenty-five), as counter-arguments to the idea that great artists always develop out of gifted children. Her memory was prodigious: by the time she was twelve, she knew the whole of Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier by heart. Students have described her as knowing every significant piece, by every significant composer. Copland recalls, > Nadia Boulanger knew everything there was to know about music; she knew the > oldest and the latest music, pre-Bach and post-Stravinsky. All technical > know-how was at her fingertips: harmonic transposition, the figured bass, > score reading, organ registration, instrumental techniques, structural > analyses, the school fugue and the free fugue, the Greek modes and Gregorian > chant. Murray Perahia recalled being \\"awed by the rhythm and character\\" with which she played a line of a Bach fugue. Janet Craxton recalled listening to Boulanger's playing Bach chorales on the piano as \\"the single greatest musical experience of my life\\". Quincy Jones says Boulanger told him \\"Your music can never be more or less than you are as a human being\\".\\"Quincy Jones on Nadia Boulanger\\", recording and transcript, National Endowment for the Arts Honours and awards *1932 Chevalier to the L√©gion d'honneur *1934 Order of Polonia Restituta *1962 Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences *1962 Howland Memorial Prize}}full citation neededdate=March 2020reason=At least the journal needs to be identified ‚Äì ISSN or similar.}} *1975 M√©daille d'Or of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts of the Institut de France *1977 Grand officier to the L√©gion d'honneur *1977 Order of the British Empire *Order of St. Charles of Monaco *Order of the Crown of Belgium Key works Vocal *Allons voir sur le lac d'argent (A.

It is normally a bundle of belongings rolled in a traditional fashion to be carried by a foot traveller in the bush. Before motor transport was common, foot travel over long distances was essential to agriculture in the Australian bush. It is sometimes referred to as a \\"backpack bed\\". Swags have been carried by shearers, miners, the unemployed, and many others, some of whom would have been happy to have been called swagmen and some not. Modern use In Australia, the term swag is still widely used to refer to a tent or other portable shelter used for camping or outdoor sleeping. A modern swag is a waterproof canvas sleeping compartment that is sometimes insect-proof. All swags come with a foam mattress, and can comfortably be slept in with the addition of a pillow and sleeping bag. When rolled up the swag is relatively lightweight and compact, making it ideal for storage and transport. It is typically easy to erect, and roll up can be done quickly. Swags are still heavily used in Australia, by overlanders. There are still a large number of manufacturers actively making both standard and custom-design swags. The modern swag is designed for robustness and is marketed towards those travelling by vehicle - they are too heavy and bulky to be transported long distances on foot. Bushwalkers and hikers would use conventional lightweight tents and sleeping bags. More recently, several camping supply firms have produced readymade bedrolls along the pattern of the original swag, and refer to these as \\"swags\\".

He served as Lord Privy Seal between 1827 and 1828 and in 1834 and was a member of Lord Grey's Whig government as Minister without Portfolio between 1830 and 1834. Early life Carlisle was the eldest son of Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle, and his wife Lady Margaret Caroline Leveson-Gower, Among his siblings were brothers: Hon. William Howard, Maj. Hon. Frederick Howard, and the Very Rev. Hon. Henry Howard, Dean of Lichfield; and sisters: Lady Isabella Howard (wife of John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor), Lady Elizabeth Howard (wife of John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland), and Lady Gertrude Howard (wife of William Sloane-Stanley). His paternal grandparents were Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle and, his second wife, Hon Isabella Byron (daughter of William Byron, 4th Baron Byron and relative of Lord Byron). His mother was daughter of Granville Leveson- Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford and his wife Lady Louisa, eldest daughter and co-heiress of Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater. He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.thepeerage.com George Howard, 6th Earl of Carlisle Political career Carlisle was returned to parliament for Morpeth as a Whig in 1795, a seat he held until 1806; he then represented Cumberland until 1820. In 1806 he was sworn on to the Privy Council and appointed to the Indian board in the unity \\"Ministry of All the Talents\\", but resigned in 1807. In 1825 he succeeded his father to the earldom and he entered the House of Lords. He served in the moderate Tory governments of George Canning and Lord Goderich as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests between May and July 1827 and as Lord Privy Seal (with a seat in the cabinet) between July 1827 and January 1828. However, he split with the Tories over electoral reform and later served as a member of the cabinet in the Whig administrations of Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne as Minister without Portfolio between 1830 and 1834 and once again as Lord Privy Seal between July and November 1834. Apart from his political career Carlisle was Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire between 1824 and 1840.leighrayment.com Peerage: Carew to Castlereagh He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1837. Family On 21 March 1801, Lord Carlisle was married to Lady Georgiana Cavendish (1783‚Äì1858), daughter of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire and Lady Georgiana Spencer (the eldest daughter of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer). They were parents of twelve children: # George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle (1802‚Äì1864), who did not marry. # Lady Caroline Georgiana Howard (1803‚Äì1881), who married William Lascelles, Comptroller of the Household. # Lady Georgiana Howard (1804‚Äì1860), who married George Agar-Ellis, 1st Baron Dover. # Hon.

Henry George Howard (1818‚Äì1879), who married Mary Wellesley McTavish in 1845 at the house of her aunt, the Marchioness Wellesley. Mary was the daughter of John McTavish, British Consul at Baltimore, and Emily Caton (daughter of Richard Caton and granddaughter of Charles Carroll of Carrollton). He served as Secretary of the British Embassy in Paris. His wife died in Paris 21 February 1850, in her 23rd year. # Lady Mary Matilda Georgiana Howard (1823‚Äì1892), who married Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton. Lord Carlisle died at Castle Howard, Yorkshire, in October 1848, aged 75, and was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, George. The Countess of Carlisle died at Castle Howard in August 1858, aged 75. As his eldest son died unmarried and without legitimate issue, his third son became the 8th Early of Carlisle in 1864. He also died unmarried and without legitimate issue, so the 9th Earl of Carlisle was his grandson, George James Howard, the only son of his fifth son Charles, whose descendants hold the titles to this day. Descendants Much of the modern British aristocracy can trace their roots to the sixth Earl of Carlisle. Through his daughter Harriet, Duchess of Sutherland, he is the ancestor of the present Dukes of Hamilton & Brandon, Argyll, Leinster and Westminster, the present Marquesses of Hertford and Londonderry, the present earls of Selkirk, Lichfield and Cromartie, and the present Viscount Dilhorne, among many others. The late Duchess of Beaufort and the heir to the Duke of Roxburghe, and the late wife of the sixth Duke of Sutherland, were all descended from Harriet, although none of the present holders of those titles are. Through his daughter Georgina, Duchess of Devonshire, Lord Carlisle is the ancestor of the present Duke of Devonshire, Marquess of Salisbury, Earl of Stockton. Through his daughter Lady Caroline Lascelles, he is the ancestor of the present Duke of Buccleuch & Queensberry, the present Duke of Abercorn and the present Duke of Westminster. The present Duke of Northumberland, meanwhile, is descended from Lord Carlisle through several daughters. Other descendants include Archbishop of Canterbury William Temple, naturalist Gavin Maxwell, spymaster Eliza Manningham-Buller and supermodel Stella Tennant, and Princess, Lady Diana Spencer.

A \\"poem on the solitude of power\\" according to the author, the novel is a flowing tract on the life of an eternal dictator. The book is divided into six sections, each retelling the same story of the infinite power held by the archetypical Caribbean tyrant. Garc√≠a M√°rquez based his fictional dictator on a variety of real-life fascists, including Gustavo Rojas Pinilla of his Colombian homeland, Generalissimo Francisco Franco of Spain (the novel was written in Barcelona), and Venezuela's Juan Vicente G√≥mez. The product is a universal story of the disastrous effects created by the concentration of power into a single man. Plot introduction The book is written in long paragraphs with extended sentences. The general's thoughts are relayed to the reader through winding sentences which convey his desperation and loneliness alongside the atrocities and ruthless behavior that keep him in power. One of the book's most striking aspects is its focus on the God-like status held by the protagonist and the unfathomable awe and respect with which his people regard him. Dictators and strongmen such as Franco, Somoza, and Trujillo managed to hold sway over the populations of their nations despite internal political division. Garc√≠a M√°rquez symbolizes this with the discovery of the dictator's corpse in the presidential palace. Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science Garc√≠a M√°rquez mocks the practice of conferring high military rank on the young heirs of autocrats and the overspending of their families and cronies. A frighteningly accurate portrait is drawn of the intelligence director who soon directs the general's every move and constructs an apparatus of terror and political repression. This last portrait is one of the most compelling: \\"advisors\\" have often marked the corruption and descent into oppression of some of Latin America's most outstanding dictatorships. Trujillo's Dominican Republic carried out dozens of assassinations and terror campaigns against Dominican exiles under the direction of intelligence chief Johnny Abbes Garc√≠a.

BSDi was a lawsuit brought in the United States in 1992 by Unix System Laboratories against Berkeley Software Design, Inc and the Regents of the University of California over intellectual property related to the Unix operating system; a culmination of the Unix wars. The case was settled out of court in 1994 after the judge expressed doubt in the validity of USL's intellectual property, with Novell (who by that time had bought USL) and the University agreeing not to litigate further over the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD).  Background  The suit has its roots at the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley, which had a license for the source code of UNIX from AT&T;'s Bell Labs. Students doing operating systems research at the CSRG modified and extended UNIX, and the CSRG made several releases of the modified operating system beginning in 1978, with AT&T;'s blessing. Because this Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) contained copyrighted AT&T; Unix source code, it was only available to organizations with a source code license for Unix from AT&T.; Students and faculty at the CSRG audited the software code for the TCP/IP stack, removing all the AT&T; intellectual property, and released it to the general public in 1988 as \\"Net/1\\", under the BSD license. When it became apparent that the Berkeley CSRG would soon close, students and faculty at the CSRG began an effort to remove all the remaining AT&T; code from the BSD and replace it with their own. This effort resulted in the public release of Net/2 in 1991, again under the BSD license. Net/2 contained enough code for a nearly complete UNIX- like system, which the CSRG believed contained no AT&T; intellectual property. Berkeley Software Design (BSDi) obtained the source for Net/2, filled in the missing pieces, and ported it to the Intel i386 computer architecture. BSDi then sold the resulting BSD/386 operating system, which could be ordered through 1-800-ITS-UNIX. This drew the ire of AT&T;, which did not agree with BSDi's claim that BSD/386 was free of AT&T; intellectual property. AT&T;'s Unix System Laboratories subsidiary filed suit against BSDi in New Jersey in April 1992, a suit that was later amended to include The Regents of the University of California.  USL's complaint  In the lawsuit, USL alleged that: * The Regents of the University of California, by releasing Net/2 \\"based upon, substantially copied from, or derived from proprietary UNIX\\", had ** breached USL's software license contract; ** infringed on USL's copyright on UNIX; ** diluted USL's trademark on UNIX; ** misappropriated USL's trade secret on UNIX. On these grounds, USL asked the court for a preliminary injunction that would bar BSDi from distributing the Net/2 software until the case was decided.  Pretrial  At a hearing, BSDi contended that they were using the sources freely distributed by the University of California plus six additional files. BSDi accepted liability for their own six files, but refused to account for the other files distributed by the University of California. The judge agreed with BSDI's argument and told USL to restate their complaint based solely on the six files or he would dismiss it. Rather than narrow down their claim, USL chose to sue BSDi and the University of California, and requested a preliminary injunction on the distribution of Net/2 from both.Twenty Years of Berkeley Unix: From AT&T-Owned; to Freely Redistributable, by Marshall Kirk McKusick In 1993, judge Dickinson R. Debevoise denied a preliminary injunction, on the grounds that USL had no valid copyright over 32V and could not show any obvious trade secret. Works published in the U.S. between January 1, 1978 and March 1, 1989, were subject to the provisions of 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 405(a), which required the copyright owner to properly affix a copyright notice to the work in order to claim copyright protection. AT&T; released V32 in 1978, but omitted a notice from thousands of copies and failed to copyright 32V until 1992.Court opinion Civ. No. 92-1667 (1993)  University's countersuit  In 1993, a few days after the dismissal of the preliminary injunction, the University filed a countersuit against USL in California, claiming that USL had failed to credit the University for the use of BSD code in System V, as required by the software license contract. The University demanded that USL be forced to reprint all their documentation with the appropriate due credit added, to notify all their licensees of their oversight, and to run full-page advertisements in major publications such as The Wall Street Journal and Fortune Magazine informing the public of their omission.  Settlement  In July 1993, soon after UC filed its countersuit, USL was purchased by Novell. Novell CEO Ray Noorda favored a settlement that was reached in February 1994. The salient points were:USL v. BSDi settlement agreement (Adobe .pdf format), HTML version * 4.4BSD-lite to be released containing no disputed files. University to encourage licensees to switch from Net/2. * University to cease distribution of certain files. * USL to grant three months' grace period to users of disputed files. * Certain files distributed by University to carry USL copyright notice. * Certain files distributed by USL to carry University copyright notices. * USL to permit free distribution of certain files. * University not to actively assist in legal attempts to challenge USL's rights to certain files. Of the 18,000 files in the Berkeley distribution, only three had to be removed and 70 modified to show USL copyright notices. A further condition of the settlement was that USL would not file further lawsuits against users and distributors of the upcoming 4.4BSD-Lite release.

History Rijpsburg, a now abandoned Dutch settlement on Spitsbergen on Cape Boheman (Bohemanflya), at the north site of Nordfjorden in the Isfjord, stood roughly diagonally opposite Longyearbyen. The Rotterdam-based Van der Eb and Dresselhuys Scheepvaartmaatschappij (ship-building company) built it in 1920, using prefabricated huts, for the mining of coal. Twelve Dutch staff and 52 German miners started mining coal here that year. The Dutch Spitsbergen Company (NESPICO), founded in 1920, bought a mine in Green Harbour fjord from the Russians and mined coal from 1921 to 1926. The company renamed its settlement Barentsburg after the Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz. In 1932 the company sold the mine, including its settlement Barentsburg, to the Russian Trust Arktikugol (–ê—Ä–∫—Ç–∏–∫—É–≥–æ–ª—å). The population has declined over the decades; in its heyday, over 1,000 Soviet citizens inhabited Barentsburg. 2006 fire On October 17, 2006, Norwegian inspectors detected a smouldering underground fire in Barentsburg, prompting fears that an open fire might break out,Norway Svalbard Coal Fire.

The fire was later contained.Barentsburg: Kullbrann kan f√∏re til evakuering Aftenposten 1 November 2006 Coal mining resumed at the end of 2010. Status Under the terms of the unique Svalbard Treaty of 1920, citizens of signatory countries have equal rights to exploit natural resources, and as a result Russia, along with Norway (via the Sveagruva mine and Mine 7), maintains mining operations on Svalbard. However, as Svalbard is under Norwegian sovereignty, the Russian government is represented in Barentsburg by a consulate. This is the northernmost diplomatic mission of any kind in the world. Consequently, the town has a Norwegian postcode, 9178.9178 BARENTSBURG SVALBARD, Posten Norge Similarly, it uses Norwegian telephone numbering.Consulate General in Barentsburg (Spitsbergen) Economic basis Barentsburg started as a Dutch mining town in the 1920s. In 1932 the Dutch sold their concession to the Soviet Union. Since 1932 the Russian state-owned Arktikugol Trust (Russian for \\"Arctic Coal\\") has been operating on Svalbard and the main economic activity in Barentsburg is coal mining by Arktikugol. The coal is usually exported to Northern European buyers. The town relies entirely on mainland Russia for food and coinage. There have been instances in which not enough food was sent, and aid packages were sent from Longyearbyen. Tourism is now being developed, but does not yet generate enough income to revive the town. Transportation The distance from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg is about 55 km but there are no roads connecting the two settlements. Most contact between the two is by boat, snowmobile, or helicopter. There is a heliport (ICAO code ENBA) with a road connection at Heerodden (), 4 km north of Barentsburg. The port is located in the middle of Barentsburg. Tourists usually arrive via a 2-3-hour boat trip from Longyearbyen. The coal is freighted by ship. Climate Barentsburg features a tundra climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification, with short, chilly ‚Äúsummers‚Äù and long, very cold winters, though winters here are noticeably warmer than winters in a number of locations with tundra climates. Due to the fact that the town is located at a latitude approaching 80 degrees, only four months of the year have average temperatures above freezing, and in no month does the average monthly temperature exceed , meaning it is north of the tree line. Average low temperatures during the winter routinely drop below . Barentsburg averages roughly of precipitation, much of which falls as snow. In fact, the town typically experiences snowfall in every month of the year. Science and culture M. Presnyakov. The old Barentsburg church, 2014 The Barentsburg Pomor Museum presents Pomor culture, Arctic flora and fauna, and archaeological objects preserved in the permafrost.

Every summer, several dozen geophysicists, geologists, archaeologists, biologists, glaciologists, geographers, etc., from Russia and elsewhere work in the scientific research centre. There is also a year-round meteorological observatory and the northernmost cosmic rays station. Education The school Barentsburg has its own school serving the Russian community; in 2014 it had three teachers, with one for most subjects, one for music, and one for the English language. By 2014 its welfare funds had declined.

IRC operators are charged with the task of enforcing the network's rules, and in many cases, improving the network in various areas. The permissions available to an IRC operator vary according to the server software in use, and the server's configuration. IRC operators are divided into local and global operators. The former are limited to the server(s) they have specific access to; however, global operators can perform actions affecting all users on the network. In order to perform their duties, IRC operators usually have the ability to: * Forcibly disconnect users (Kill) * Ban (K-line or G-line) users * Change network routing by disconnecting (squitting) or connecting servers Traditionally, a list of operators on a particular server is available in the MOTD, or through the command. A user can become an operator by sending the command /oper to the irc server he or she currently is on using a pre-selected username and a password as parameters. The command only works for the server which has the proper O-line in its IRCd configuration file. The IP address that the user is opering from may also have to match a predefined one, as an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized users opering if they have cracked the operator's password.  Operator types  In many IRC networks, IRCops have different types of access on a network. These ranks often depend upon the IRCd software used, though a few specific access levels remain fairly constant throughout variations:  Local operator  The Local Operator (LocOp) is the lowest in Operator access levels. The LocOp has a minimal control on one server out of a network, and usually has the ability to kill (disconnect) people from the server or perform local K-lines (server ban).  Global operator  The Global Operator (GlobOp) is similar to the LocOp, and has control over the entire network of servers, as opposed to a single server. GlobOps may perform G-lines or AKills (network-wide bans) and Shun (forcibly mute) users over an entire network.  Services administrator  Commonly abbreviated as SA, This admin type has control over all functionality on an IRC network available via network service bots, including the commonly used NickServ, ChanServ, and MemoServ nicks. Usually, an SA has the ability to use the /sa* commands. The /sa* commands, like all actions performed by network services, are typically implemented using a virtual services node on the network, effectively masking the origin of the actions.  Network Administrator  The Network Administrator (NetAdmin) has the highest level of access on a network. In most cases, the founder of the network is the netadmin. Networks may, however, have multiple netadmins - especially networks with large populations.  Ban Types  An IRCop with enough privileges, may give a ban to unwanted users. The ban types are listed below:  K-line  The K-line is a local server ban (specific to a single server, not the entire IRC network) that bans the unwanted user's hostname.  G-line  The G-line (Global K-line) works exactly as the K-line, but is global. G-lines can expire, but in some cases they are permanent..  Z-line  On IRCds such as UnrealIRCd, the Z-line is a \\"powerful\\" ban that is performed on a user's IP address rather than the hostmask, denying access to all users from the offending IP. Z-lines may expire, but in many cases are permanent.  GZ-line  Some IRCds support the GZ-line (Global Z-line). It is exactly as the Z-line itself, but it's global, and network-wide. UnrealIRCd has GZ-line support. The GZ-line is an effective way of blocking static IP users, and keeping them out.  D-line  On other IRCds, such as Charybdis,http://www.stack.nl/~jilles/irc/charybdis-oper- guide/usercommands.htm#AEN729 a D-line replaces a Z-line. It is called a D-line because it \\"denies\\" the IP address from connecting. Charybdis does not have support for a Z-line or a GZ-line. By using its \\"cluster\\" configuration feature, D-lines can be synchronized between servers, providing a type of 'GZ- line'. This enables for very nice big network support since the administrator of one server may want to allow certain servers they trust to synchronize D-lines and K-lines, but not allow others.

Expressed in the International System of Units (SI), it is the reduction, from 600 m to 300 m, of required vertical separation of aircraft between altitudes 8,850 and 12,500 m. This reduction in vertical separation minima therefore increases the number of aircraft that can fly in a particular volume of controlled airspace. Historical background In 1958 the standard vertical separation of aircraft in controlled airspace was set at 1,000 feet from ground level or sea level to flight level 290, and at 2,000 feet above flight level 290.Silva 2010 pp. 7‚Äì8. The larger minimum separations at higher altitudes was necessary because the accuracy of altimeters, used to determine altitude by measuring air pressure, decreases with height. Efforts to reduce this separation above flight level 290 began almost immediately,Silva 2010 pp. 9‚Äì15., but doing so without compromising safety required improvements in altimeters and other equipment, due in part to inherent difficulties in accurately determining and maintaining aircraft altitudes and, therefore, the actual vertical distance between aircraft.Silva 2010 pp. 18‚Äì21. It was not until the 1990s that air data computers (ADCs), altimeters, and autopilot systems became sufficiently accurate to safely reduce vertical separation minima.Silva 2010 p. 17. Implementation Between 1997 and 2005 RVSM was implemented in all of Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia and North America, South America, and over the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans. The North Atlantic implemented initially in March 1997 at flight levels 330 through 370. The entire western hemisphere implemented RVSM FL290‚ÄìFL410 on January 20, 2005. Africa implemented it on September 25, 2008.

Below transition level, however, meters are still in use. Requirements Only aircraft with specially certified altimeters and autopilots may fly in RVSM airspace, otherwise the aircraft must fly lower or higher than the airspace, or seek special exemption from the requirements. Additionally, aircraft operators (airlines or corporate operators) must receive specific approval from the aircraft's state of registry in order to conduct operations in RVSM airspace. Non RVSM approved aircraft may transit through RVSM airspace provided they are given continuous climb/descent throughout the designated airspace, and 2,000 ft vertical separation is provided at all times between the non-RVSM flight, and all others for the duration of the climb/descent. \\"State aircraft\\", which includes aircraft used in military, customs and police service, are exempted from the requirement to be RVSM approved.

The initial idea was developed by Krishna Bharat. The service has been described as the world's largest news aggregator. In 2020, Google announced they would be spending $1 billion to work with publishers to create Showcases. Details As of 2013, Google News was watching more than 50,000 news sources worldwide. Versions for more than 60 regions in 28 languages were available in March 2012. , service is offered in the following 35 languages: Arabic, Bengali, Bulgarian, Cantonese, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Italian, Indonesian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malayalam, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese. The service covers news articles appearing within the past 30 days on various news websites. In total, Google News aggregates content from more than 20,000 publishers. For the English language, it covers about 4,500 sites;As used to be reported by Google. See also Segev, Elad (2010).

Its front page provides roughly the first 200 characters of the article and a link to its larger content. Websites may or may not require a subscription; sites requiring subscription are noted in the article description. On December 1, 2009, Google announced changes to their \\"first click free\\" program, which has been running since 2008 and allows users to find and read articles behind a paywall. The reader's first click to the content is free, and the number after that would be set by the content provider. Google on December 1, 2009 changed their policy to allow a limit of five articles per day, in order to protect publishers from abuse. This policy was again changed on September 29, 2015 where this limit was changed to three articles per day. The layout of Google News underwent a major revision on May 16, 2011. On July 14, 2011, Google introduced \\"Google News Badges\\", which it later retired in October 2012. Additionally in July 2011, the Sci/Tech section of the English Google News versions was split up into two sections: Science and Technology. It was announced that this section split would be performed on other language versions as well. , this split had not been applied to all language versions of Google News. In June 2017, the desktop version of Google News saw a thorough redesign that according to Google had the goal to \\"make news more accessible and easier to navigate ... with a renewed focus on facts, diverse perspectives, and more control for users.\\" Yet several options such as the search tools menu were removed along with the redesign, making searches much more difficult. It now uses a card format for grouping related news stories, and as summarized by Engadget, \\"doesn't look like a search results page anymore\\", removing text snippets and blue links. Historically users could choose to hide articles originating from a news source. These hidden sources can still be listed in a user's settings however these exclusions are no longer honoured. The option to exclude a source of news items is no longer presented. According to a 2020 study in the journal Nature Human Behavior, Google News tends to prioritize national news outlets when individuals search for keywords, unless the keywords specifically relate to topics of local interest. As a consequence, the Google News algorithm may divert web traffic away from local news outlets, depriving them of advertiser money. Controversies with publishers=EU copyright and database right In March 2005, Agence France-Presse (AFP) sued Google for $17.5 million, alleging that Google News infringed on its copyright because \\"Google includes AFP's photos, stories and news headlines on Google News without permission from Agence France Presse\\". It was also alleged that Google ignored a cease and desist order, though Google counters that it has opt-out procedures which AFP could have followed but did not. Google now hosts Agence France-Presse news, as well as the Associated Press, Press Association and the Canadian Press. This arrangement started in August 2007. In 2007, Google announced it was paying for Associated Press content displayed in Google News, however the articles are not permanently archived. That arrangement ceased on December 23, 2009 when Google News ceased carrying Associated Press content. In 2007, a preliminary injunction and then a Belgian court ruled that Google did not have the right to display the lead paragraph from French-language Belgian news sources when Google aggregated news stories, The majority Dutch-language press is fully included in Google News nor to provide free access to cached copies of the full content (\\"in cache\\" feature), due to both copyright and the sui generis database rights. Google responded by removing the publications both from Google News and the main Google web search. According to the 2009 Report on the outlook for copyright in the EU, In May 2011 the ruling was upheld in appeal after Google reiterated most legal defences from the first grade plus some new ones, which the Court rejected based on the Infopaq ruling and others. In July 2011, Copiepress publications were restored on Google News after they requested so and renounced any complaint based on the judgement. Nevertheless, in a 2017 briefing on the ancillary copyright for press publishers paid by the European Commission, Prof. H√∂ppner thought the sui generis database right was not violated by most platforms on the basis that the \\"substantial part\\" criterion may be too high a bar after C-444/02 Fixtures Marketing v. OPAP and that no publisher was known to have won a case with it. Publisher right Some Europe-based news outlets have asked their governments to consider making Google pay to host links. In Germany, their lobbying lead the introduction of the ancillary copyright for press publishers in 2013. In October 2014, a group of German publishers granted Google a license to use snippets of their publications gratis; the group had first claimed that such snippets were illegal, and then complained when they were removed by Google.German Publishers Grant Google A 'Free License' Google Never Needed To Post News Snippets, TechDirt. In December 2014, Google announced it would be shutting down the Google News service in Spain. A new law in Spain, lobbied for by the Spanish newspaper publishers' association AEDE, would require that news aggregators would have to pay news services for the right to use snippets of their stories on Google News.Google News Spain to close in response to story links 'tax Google chose to shut down their service and remove all links to Spain-based news sites from international versions of the site. The attempt at establishing a publisher right on press publications was then repeated at EU level with the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market. Other geographies Newspapers representing more than 90 percent of the market in Brazil opted out of having their links appear in Google News according to reports, resulting in only a \\"negligible\\" drop in traffic. Google in June 2020 announced that it will begin paying news publishers that are located in Brazil, Germany, and Australia. Some of the partners for Google's new program include luminaries as Schwartz Media (Australia), Solstice Media, The Conversation, and Der Spiegel (Germany). Features and customization A pull-down menu at the top of search results enables users to specify the time period in which they wish to search for articles. This menu includes options such as: past day, past week, past month, or a custom range. Users can request e-mail \\"alerts\\" on various keyword topics by subscribing to Google News Alerts. E-mails are sent to subscribers whenever news articles matching their requests come online. Alerts are also available via RSS and Atom feeds. Users used to be able to customize the displayed sections, their location on the page, and how many stories are visible with a JavaScript-based drag and drop interface. However, for the US site, this has been disabled in favor of a new layout; roll-out of this layout is planned for other locales in the near future. Stories from different editions of Google News can be combined to form one personalized page, with the options stored in a cookie. The service has been integrated with Google Search History since November 2005. Upon its graduation from beta, a section was added that displays recommended news based on the user's Google News search history and the articles the user has clicked on (if the user has signed up for Search History). A revamped version of Google News was introduced in May 2018 that included artificial intelligence features to help users find relevant information. News Archive Search On June 6, 2006, Google News expanded, adding a News Archive Search feature, offering users historical archives going back more than 200 years from some of its sources. There was a timeline view available, to select news from various years. An expansion of the service was announced on September 8, 2008, when Google News began to offer indexed content from scanned newspapers. The depth of chronological coverage varies; beginning in 2008, the entire content of the New York Times back to its founding in 1851 has been available. In early 2010, Google removed direct access to the archive search from the main Google News page, advanced news search page and default search results pages. These pages indicated that the search covered \\"Any time\\", but did not include the archive and only included recent news. During the summer of 2010, Google decided to redesign the format of the Google news page, creating a firestorm of complaints. In May 2011, Google cancelled plans to scan further old newspapers. About 60 million newspaper pages had been scanned prior to this event. Google announced that it would instead focus on \\"Google One Pass, a platform that enables publishers to sell content and subscriptions directly from their own sites\\". In August 2011, the \\"News Archive Advanced Search\\" functionality was removed entirely, again generating complaints from regular users who found that the changes rendered the service unusable. Archival newspaper articles could still be accessed via the Google News Search page, but key functionalities such as the timeline view and ability to specify more than 10 results per page were removed. Coverage artifacts On September 7, 2008, United Airlines, which was the subject of an indexed, archived article, lost and later not quite regained US$1 billion in market value when a 2002 Chicago Tribune article about the bankruptcy filing of the airline in that year appeared in the current \\"most viewed\\" category on the website of the Sun-Sentinel, a sister paper. Google News index's next pass found the link as new news, and Income Security Advisors found the Google result to be new news, which was passed along to Bloomberg News, where it was briefly a current headline and very widely viewed.

Background Appel was raised by his grandparents, and educated in an ORT technical dormitory school in Magdiel, where he studied printing. He was not drafted into the IDF due to an injury sustained when printing machinery fell on his hand. At age 20 he joined the Likud youth organisation, where he formed lifelong friendships with many people who would later become influential Israeli politicians. In 1975 he opened a baby products store in Tel Aviv, which eventually became a national chain. He was also a partner in the Gazan UP-7 company. In 1977 he sold his chain and opened a general contracting firm with partner Shalom Prussak, which became state-recognised within three years and ultimately built thousands of housing units, many of them under contract for the Israeli Housing Ministry. Corruption charges The Attorney General of Israel ruled that between 1983 and 1986, Appel's contracting company had operated in a manner violating the law, and only 13 years later in 1997 he was cleared of all charges. In 2003 the State again brought charges against Appel, this time dealing with four separate cases of bribery and dishonest business practices.Yitzhak Danon, \\"David Appel Indicted on Bribery Charges\\", Asia-Africa Intelligence Wire, 11 September 2003, The indictment charged that he had promised civil servants reelection in exchange for approving his projects in Central Israel, especially Lod and Giv'at Shmuel. Among those accused of accepting bribes were former MK Nehama Ronen, then director of the Environment Ministry, Israel Land Administration official Oded Tal, Lod mayor Benny Regev, and Giv'at Shmuel council head Zamir ben Ari. In 2004 he was charged with bribing Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon, in what became known as the Greek Island Affair, and was also charged with five other bribe offenses. Attorney General Menachem Mazuz eventually ruled that Sharon could not be charged with receiving bribes from Appel. As of September 2008 all but one bribery charge against Appel had been dropped.

It is the basis of three Olympic sports: luge, skeleton and bobsledding. When practised on sand, it is known as a form of sandboarding. In Russia sledges are used for maritime activities including fishing and commuting from island to island on ice. Sledding in Podkowa Le≈õna, Poland, Feb., 2010 History Old-fashioned wooden sled (or Toboggan without runners) The practical use of sleds is ancient and widespread. They were developed in areas with consistent winter snow cover, as vehicles to transport materials and/or people, far more efficiently than wheeled vehicles could in icy and snowy conditions. Early designs included hand-pulled sizes as well as larger dog, horse, or ox drawn versions. Early examples of sleds and sledges were found in the Oseberg Viking ship excavation. The Toboggan sled is also a traditional form of transport used by the Innu and Cree of northern Canada and the people of Ancient Egypt are thought to have used sledges (on the desert sand and on ramps) extensively for construction. Modern sledding The generic term sledding refers to traveling down a snowy hill using a sled such as a Flexible Flyer with wooden slats and metal runners. It is usually done during the winter when there is snow. Flat plastic or aluminum discs and improvised sleds (carrier bags, baking trays, cafeteria trays, sheets of cardboard, etc.) may also be used. The activity has been known to exist as a fringe recreational activity far into the distant murky past in toboggan-type sleds which seasonally supplant the ubiquitous cart. Back country sledding A backcountry sled (a kid's size Mad River Rocket - Stinger) In contrast to the more common forms of sledding, back country sledding involves four important elements in combination: a great amount of directional control, flotation, a binding system, and padding. First, back country sleds are made of strong plastic material, with the snow-side surface possessing various grooves and chines for directional control. Second, the plastic construction, with a large amount of snow-side surface area keeps the sled afloat in deeper snow conditions (the same principle behind wider powder skis or snowboards). Though the original runner sleds possessed directional control, their thin runner blades bogged down in anything but icy or thin snow conditions. Disk sleds, on the other hand, possessed flotation but no directional control. Third, modern back country sleds have a binding system, which usually consists of a simple belt strap that attaches to the sides of the sled. With the sledder in the kneeling position, the strap may go over the sledder's thighs or calves before connecting with the strap from the other side of the sled with some sort of buckling device. Finally, back country sleds have foam pads glued for the sledder to kneel on for shock absorption. One such sled is the Mad River Rocket. Back country sledding is a closer kin to back country alpine skiing or snowboarding than to traditional \\"pile the family in the van and go to the local hill\\" type of sledding. The terrain for back country sledding includes powder-filled steeps, open mountain bowls, cliff-filled ridges, and basically anywhere that one finds the powder, steeps, rocks and trees. Back country sleds, with the binding system and padding, may also be used for freestyle moves such as spins and flips off jumps and rail slides. Though similarities exist between back country sledding and alpine skiing/snowboarding, important differences separate the disciplines. From a technical perspective, the lack of a metal edge and the lower center of gravity make it more difficult to control a back country sled on icy or packed snow surfaces. From an access perspective, alpine resorts do not allow sledding on the actual mountain, except for the occasional small tubing hill. Recreational sledging techniques Schlitteln, Schweizer Alpen, ~1890-1910 The first ride down a hill on a sled is the most important, but most also the most difficult, as it determines the path of the sled for further runs down the hill. It is essential to steer the sled along the most exciting course, perhaps adding twists and turns to make the run down the hill faster or more exciting. Other techniques to improve the ride include turning around, lying on the stomach, or closing both eyes. Running up to a sled and jumping onto it can create additional momentum and improve ride speed. This technique can be referred to as \\"Flopping.\\" There are five types of sleds commonly used today: runner sleds, toboggans, disks, tubes and backcountry sleds. Each type has advantages and disadvantages if one is trying to get the most out of a given slope. With each course down the hill, the sled's path through the snow can become more icy. Sleds with a greater surface area (anything but runner sleds) are able to make the first runs a great deal easier than the variety of sleds with metal runners. Runner sleds are typically faster once the snow has compacted or turned icy. In the 1880s, Samuel Leeds Allen invented the first steerable runner sled, the Flexible Flyer. Since that date, the ability to steer the sled away from obstacles has led people to believe it to be more appropriate choice for the safety conscious. On the other hand, the hard wood or metal front section of steerable runner sleds is far more likely to cause serious injury if it strikes a person, or if the hands are caught between the steering mechanism and a solid object in a crash. Each year, around 30,000 children in the US are injured in sledding, with one in 25 injuries requiring hospitalization. In a majority of these serious cases, young children are riding runner sleds in a prone position, and suffer hand and finger injuries when they are caught under the runners or between the sled and another object.BJC Health Care - The Ups and Downs of Sledding Safety In addition, runner sleds force the weight of the rider onto two thin runners where the pressure causes a microscopic film of snow or ice to melt as the sled passes over it. This invisible layer of fluid reduces friction, causing the sled's speed to greatly exceed that of its flat bottomed relatives. With the control of a backcountry sled, stunts become possible. Sledding off cliffs and doing tricks off jumps is known as extreme sledding. Competitive sledding The Swiss bobsleigh team from Davos, ca. 1910 Skeleton sled for Olympic grade racing. Sweden and Norway recorded some early Kicksled Races during the 15th century. The modern sport of sledding (Luge - Skeleton and Bobsledding) originated in St. Moritz, Switzerland in the mid-to-late 19th century when vacationing guests adapted delivery sleds for recreational purposes and from there, it quickly spread to Davos and other Swiss towns and villages. Modern competitive sledding started in 1883 in Davos, Switzerland. An Australian student named George Robertson won what is reputed to be the world‚Äôs first international sled race. He outraced 19 other competitors from England, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States on a four kilometre stretch of road from St. Wolfgang to the town of Klosters.International Luge Federation#History Soon the Bobsleigh, Luge, and Skeleton were developed in succession. By mid-decade, Kulm Hotel owner Caspar Badrutt had the first run or course purpose built for the fledgling sport. The opening of formal competition for Luge was in 1883 and for Bobsleds in 1884 at St. Moritz. in 1926, the International Olympic Committee declared bobsleigh and skeleton as Olympic sports and adopted the rules of the St. Moritz run as the officially recognized Olympic rules. It was not until 2002, however, that skeleton itself was added permanently to the Olympic program with the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. There are three Olympic sledding competitions. Bobsled: Men's two and four-crew, Women's 2 crew. Luge: Men's singles, Men's doubles, Women's singles (Team Relay - Olympic discipline starting in 2014).

History=Early history The Republican Party in Minnesota was the dominant party in the state for approximately the first seventy years of Minnesota's statehood, from 1858 through the 1920s. The 1892 Republican National Convention was held in Minneapolis. Republican candidates routinely won the state governorship as well as most other state offices. The party was aided by an opposition divided between the Democratic Party and the Minnesota Farmer- Labor Party, who eventually merged in 1944. Independent-Republican era The Independent-Republicans of Minnesota (I-R) was the name of the party from November 15, 1975 until September 23, 1995. The name change was made because the \\"Republican\\" name was damaged by the Watergate Scandal. Polls conducted in the early-mid-1970s indicated people in Minnesota were more likely to vote for a candidate who identified as an \\"Independent\\" versus a \\"Republican\\". During that time, the state party became more dependent on grassroots fundraising and eventually went bankrupt. After the National party pumped money into the party, in the early-mid-1980s, their image and base began turning more conservative. During this time the party had both US Senate seats and briefly held control of the state House of Representatives. By 1994, the grassroots had turned socially more conservative, and changed the name back in 1995. Attempts to drop the term \\"Independent\\" had been defeated in 1989, 1991 and 1993. Recent history The previous Governor of Minnesota Tim Pawlenty is a Republican. After Pawlenty's re-election in 2006, Republicans held the governorship for 16 of 20 years through the end of 2010. In the general election of 2010, the party captured both chambers of the Minnesota Legislature for the first time since the 1970s, and defeated 18-term Minnesota Congressman Jim Oberstar by electing Chip Cravaack, despite having lost every statewide race. For the 2006 U.S. Senate election, the party endorsed Mark Kennedy for United States Senate, who lost to Amy Klobuchar. In the 2008 U.S. Senate election, incumbent Republican Senator Norm Coleman was defeated by Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate Al Franken by 312 votes out of over 2.5 million cast after a long series of dramatic, contentious and expensive re- counts. The Party of Minnesota was fined $170,000 for violating federal campaign finance regulations from 2003 to 2008.http://www.citypages.com, AUGUST 19, 2011, MINNESOTA GOP FINED $170,000 FOR FEC VIOLATIONS BY MIKE MULLEN, The Chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party Tony Sutton (R) was found guilty of circumventing Finance Laws in the Gubernatorial Election Recount of 2010 and fined $33,000. (2010)http://www.mprnews.org, July 13, 2012, Minn. GOP, former chairman fined over recount by Tom Scheck For the 2010 statewide elections, the party endorsed State Representative Tom Emmer and Metropolitan Council member Annette Meeks for governor and lieutenant governor. State Representative Dan Severson was the endorsed candidate for secretary of state. Attorney and psychologist Chris Barden was the endorsed candidate for attorney general. Patricia Anderson was the endorsed candidate for state auditor. All five candidates lost their respective elections. Following the 2010 gubernatorial recount, the Minnesota GOP was heavily in debt, owing $2 million primarily for the recount of votes. The GOP had stopped paying rent for its headquarters near the Capitol and the landlord filed an eviction summons once the Party had fallen $111,000 behind in rent.http://www.mprnews.org, July 13, 2012, Minn. GOP, former chairman fined over recount by Tom Scheck They announced they would move their headquarters to Minneapolis's Seward neighborhood in January 2014. The new headquarters is situated diagonally across from the Seward Community Cafe where it shares a building with a Pizza Luce. Party Chairman Keith Downey said they were moving away from St. Paul \\"to be closer to the people.\\" In 2010, Republicans had taken control of both houses of the State Legislature for the first time in three decades, only to lose both houses in 2012. Current elected officials The Minnesota Republican Party holds none of the five statewide elected offices and neither United States Senate seat.

In the United States ice blocking is thought to be regional, occurring in the West. The only equipment needed is some large blocks of thick ice and clothing, preferably padded. Hessian sacks or old towels have been recommended to sit on. Enthusiasts have been known to make \\"customized\\" ice blocks by freezing ropes into them to act as handles, and mixing colouring agents into the water prior to freezing. Successful ice blocking requires the outdoor temperature to be above freezing, as the ice block needs to melt in order to be slippery. Short grass is reported to give the best experience, due to lower drag and hence higher speed. If the hill is not sufficiently steep or the grass too long, or the outdoor temperatures too cold, ice blocking will not work. If the grass is wet or becomes wet from continued ice blocking, speeds will increase significantly. Hazards include falls, bruises, bug bites and getting wet and covered in mud. The bottom of the slope being used should be a wide area free from obstructions. In Fresno, California the sport has been embraced by high school students, who frequent parks during late night hours in an effort to evade law enforcement officers. Ice blocking was once a very popular night time activity at Hillcrest Park in Fullerton, California, but has subsided since its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s. Ice blocking was popular in Adelaide, Australia, because there is no snow in the state. The sport has a long- standing tradition at Southern Nazarene University (Bethany, Oklahoma), where the Student Government Association holds the event annually. In 2011, TLC's series Sister Wives highlighted ice blocking in the first episode of their second season. This episode showed the polygamist family spending an afternoon picnic ice blocking at a park. Excessive pressure on the grass from ice blocking can damage the grass and has resulted in the activity often being banned or restricted by park authorities and groundskeepers. There are commercially-available snow sleds that incorporate the concept of ice blocking for use during summer. The lighter and thinner ice blocks used in these sleds (as well as a larger surface area than traditional ice blocks) may reduce damage to the grass.

Back row (from the left): Jimmy Scoular, Dick Keith, Bryan Harvey (goalkeeper), Bob Stokoe, Alf McMichael and George Eastham. Front row: \\"Terry\\" W. L. Marshall, Ivor Allchurch, Len White, John McGuigan and Liam Tuohy. Robert Stokoe (21 September 1930 ‚Äì 1 February 2004) was an English footballer and manager who was able, almost uniquely, to transcend the traditional north-east animosity between the region's footballing rivals, Newcastle United and Sunderland. As a player, he won an FA Cup winner's medal with Newcastle in 1955 and in 1973 was manager of Sunderland in their famous victory over Leeds United. Playing career Born in Mickley, near Prudhoe, Northumberland, the son of a miner, Stokoe began his footballing career at Newcastle United, signing for them as an apprentice in 1947 and playing the first of 261 games, usually as centre-half, on Christmas Day 1950 against Middlesbrough, a game in which he also scored. The highlight of his 13 years at Newcastle was the 3‚Äì1 1955 FA Cup Final victory over Manchester City. After leaving Newcastle and joining Bury in February 1961, Stokoe spent a short time as a player, leading the team in an undefeated run to promotion, before making the move into management with the same club as player-manager the following season. Management career Stokoe took the post of player-manager at Bury in December 1961 which at 31 years of age, made him the second-youngest manager in the football league. He led them to the semi-finals of the League Cup in 1962‚Äì63. He stopped playing in 1964, staying on as manager for another year after which he moved south to take charge at Charlton Athletic from 1965‚Äì1967. He was manager of Rochdale from 1967 to 1968, followed by three separate spells at Carlisle United (1968‚Äì1970, 1980‚Äì1985 and 1985‚Äì1986). Blackpool Between spells at Carlisle, Stokoe managed Blackpool from 1970‚Äì1972. He was initially approached by the club in the summer of 1969, after the departure of Stan Mortensen. At the time, he declined, preferring to stay with Carlisle; just over eighteen months later, however, he became the ninth official manager in Blackpool's history. With Blackpool relegated to the Second Division before he could get his feet under his desk, Stokoe began to clear out the \\"deadwood\\" and rebuilt the side more to his liking. Stokoe agreed to sell Tony Green to his old club, Newcastle, bringing striker Keith Dyson in the opposite direction. Before the departure of Green, Blackpool enjoyed a successful venture into Europe, winning the Anglo-Italian Cup in June 1971. In the league, meanwhile, the Seasiders finished in sixth place. This still was not good enough for the fans, however, who became disenchanted with life outside the top flight again, and the club's style of play under Stokoe was not to their liking. Another successful run in the Anglo-Italian Cup the following season (losing finalists to Roma) kept the critics at bay, but the feeling around Bloomfield Road was that the 1972‚Äì73 campaign would be critical. Stokoe's third season at Blackpool started well enough when, with the team reasonably placed for a promotion push and having stated that he intended to remain at the seaside for five years, he left the club. He had been lured back to his native north-east by Sunderland. Sunderland Stokoe took over as manager of Sunderland on 29 November 1972 when they were fourth from bottom of the Second Division table after a run of just four wins in 18 games. Although his first game in charge was lost 1‚Äì0 at home to Burnley, the following week seemingly liberated players won 3‚Äì2 away at Portsmouth, starting a run of 32 games, with only 5 defeats. Just six months later on 5 May 1973, having already beaten Manchester City and Arsenal on their way to the FA Cup final, Stokoe took the Second Division club to Wembley and defeated the cup holders Leeds United to secure Sunderland's first FA Cup win since 1937. Managed by Don Revie whom Stokoe had opposed when playing for Newcastle United in their 1955 FA cup final victory over Manchester City, Leeds United were a team packed with international players and strong favourites to retain the trophy. However, Sunderland scored in the first half through Ian Porterfield and with the help of a memorable second-half match- saving double save from goalkeeper Jim Montgomery, managed to win 1‚Äì0. The victory was the first time a second division team had secured the Cup in 42 years. Stokoe is remembered for his impromptu jubilant run down the pitch at the end of the game, complete in mackintosh and his trademark trilby hat, to celebrate the victory with Montgomery. A statue of Stokoe with his arms held aloft in celebratory mid-run now stands outside Sunderland's Stadium of Light. None of the Sunderland players had been capped at the highest level when they lifted the cup, though some were capped later. The side finished 6th in the second division that season and narrowly missed promotion in the following two seasons. In 1975‚Äì76, he guided the club to the Second Division title. He tendered his resignation the following season after they struggled in the First Division with a start of nine straight games without a victory. Later years In May 1978, Stokoe returned to Blackpool with the club in dire straits. Under the managership of Allan Brown they had been relegated to the Third Division for the first time in their history and were looking for someone who could rebuild a once-proud playing tradition. He guided them to a mid-table finishing position, and then resigned again before the start of the 1979‚Äì80 season. There followed another spell with Rochdale (1979‚Äì1980) which ended with the club having to seek re-election to the league and spells with Carlisle United (1980‚Äì1985 and 1985‚Äì1986). He led Carlisle to promotion to the Second Division in 1982, and in the 1983‚Äì84 season they became promotion contenders before a poor run saw them finish 7th. He resigned in 1985, only to be reappointed and resign again seven months later. Towards the end of the 1986‚Äì87 season, he was appointed caretaker-manager of Sunderland as they struggled in the Second Division. They narrowly lost on goal difference in the end-of-season relegation-promotion playoffs and were relegated to the Third Division for the first time in their history. His contract was not renewed and he retired from football. During his whole career as a manager he was never sacked by any of his clubs. Death A statue of Stokoe stands outside Sunderland's Stadium of Light. After being unwell for some time with Alzheimer's disease, Stokoe was admitted to hospital in Hartlepool suffering from pneumonia and died on 1 February 2004 aged 73. The respect offered by both rival fan groups of Newcastle United and Sunderland was marked by their attendance at his funeral at the crematorium at Newcastle upon Tyne. The Reverend Neil Cockling, the Methodist Minister for Prudhoe, who conducted the service, told mourners: \\"He will be remembered by all as a real gentleman. Such was Bob's standing that we can see Sunderland and Newcastle here together today to celebrate his life.\\" Honours=As a player Newcastle United *FA Cup winner: 1955 As manager Blackpool *Anglo-Italian Cup winners: 1971 Sunderland *FA Cup winners: 1973 *Second Division championship: 1975‚Äì76 ReferencesFurther reading  External links *Stokoe's playing profile at Soccerbase *Stokoe's managerial profile at Soccerbase Category:1930 births Category:2004 deaths Category:English footballers Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:Bury F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:English football managers Category:Bury F.C. managers Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. managers Category:Carlisle United F.C. managers Category:Blackpool F.C. managers Category:Sunderland A.F.C. managers Category:Rochdale A.F.C. managers Category:English Football League managers Category:Association football central defenders ","title":"Bob Stokoe"},{"id":"466320","text":"Pop-up ads or pop-ups are forms of online advertising on the World Wide Web. A pop-up is a graphical user interface (GUI) display area, usually a small window, that suddenly appears (\\"pops up\\") in the foreground of the visual interface. The pop-up window containing an advertisement is usually generated by JavaScript that uses cross-site scripting (XSS), sometimes with a secondary payload that uses Adobe Flash. They can also be generated by other vulnerabilities/security holes in browser security. A variation on the pop-up window, the pop-under advertisement, opens a new browser window under the active window. Pop-unders do not interrupt the user immediately, but appear when the user closes the covering window, making it more difficult to determine which website created them. History Pop-up ads originated on the Tripod.com webpage hosting site in the late 1990s. JavaScript provided the capability for a web page to open another window. Ethan Zuckerman claims he used that capability to launch advertisements in separate windows as a response to complaints from advertisers about their ads appearing on pages with sexual content. Zuckerman later apologized for the unforeseen nuisance pop-up ads had evolved into. Pop-up blocking Web development and design technologies allow an author to associate any item on a pop-up with any action, including with a cancel or innocent looking button. Because of bad experiences and apprehensive of possible damage that they may cause, some users do not click on or interact with any item inside a pop-up window whatsoever, and may leave the site that generated them or block all pop-ups. Opera was the first major browser to incorporate tools to block pop-up ads; the Mozilla browser later improved on this by blocking only pop-ups generated as the page loads. In the early 2000s, all major web browsers except Internet Explorer let users block unwanted pop-ups almost completely. In 2004, Microsoft released Windows XP SP2, which added pop-up blocking to Internet Explorer. Most modern browsers provide pop-up blocking tools; third-party tools add other features, such as ad filtering. Fake close buttons Users of websites and web applications continuously experience unwanted pop up ads through the course of their normal interaction with a web browser. Ordinarily, users respond by dismissing the pop-up through the \\"close\\" or \\"cancel\\" feature of the window hosting the pop-up. Because this is a typical response, some authors of pop-up advertising depend on this, and create on-screen buttons or controls that look similar to a \\"close\\" or \\"cancel\\" option. When the user chooses one of these \\"simulated cancel\\" options, the button performs an unexpected or unauthorized action (such as opening a new pop-up, or downloading an unwanted file on the user's system). Circumventing pop-up blockers A hover ad or in-page pop-up uses DHTML to combine a banner ad and a pop-up window that appears in front of the browser screen. JavaScript imposes an advertisement over a webpage in a transparent layer. This advertisement can appear in a variety of forms. For example, an advertisement can contain an Adobe Flash animation that links to the advertiser's site. An advertisement can also look like a normal window. Pop-up blockers cannot block the ad because it is a part of the webpage, but it can be blocked with third- party ad blockers such as AdBlock and Adblock Plus, or by using custom style sheets. URL redirection URLs are sometimes redirected to advertisement pages by URL redirection. URLs are sometimes opened in a new tab and then the content of the old background tab will be replaced with an advertisement page by URL redirection, other times it switches the tab the user is on to the advertisement tab. Adblock Plus, uBlock and NoScript cannot block these redirects. Techniques=\\"Pop-ups\\" * Certain types of downloaded content, such as images, free music, and others, can cause pop-ups, and therefore should not be trusted, especially pornographic sites' pop-ups (known as a \\"pornado\\" or \\"porn-storm\\", as coined by John C. Dvorak.) Also, the pop- ups sometimes look like ordinary web pages, and the name of the site shows up in a search bar. Many websites use pop-ups to display information without disrupting the page currently open. For example, they may provide needed extra guidance when filling in a form on a web page, without causing loss of any information already entered into the form. Most pop-up blockers allow this kind of pop-up. Some, however, reload the page, losing any information the user entered. *Some web based installers, such as that used by McAfee, use a pop-up to install software. *On many internet browsers, holding down the ctrl key while clicking a link makes it bypass the popup filter. *Clicking (even accidentally) on one pop-up may open other pop-up ads. Pop-under ads Pop-under ads are similar to pop-up ads, but the ad window appears hidden behind the main browser window rather than superimposed in front of it. As pop-up ads became more widespread and more intrusive, often taking up whole computer screen, many users would immediately close the pop-up ads that appeared over a site without looking at them. Pop-under ads do not immediately impede the view of content, but remain unnoticed until the user closes or minimizes the main browser window. =Pop-under ad technology= A pop-under ad involves two JavaScript functions introduced in 1995 with the Netscape 2.0b3 browser. Modern web publishers and advertisers use it to create a window in front of the users screen, load an advertisement, and then send it behind the screen. // create a new window in front of the current site window.open( URL, windowName[, windowFeatures] ); // push the loaded advertisement back behind the browser window.focus(); Most modern browsers allow \`window.open\` to execute only if it was called by a user interaction (e.g., a mouse click) event handler. Any non-interactive calls (timer callback, load events, etc.) to \`window.open\` result in the new window being blocked. To bypass this restriction, most pop-under ads trigger on a mouse click event listener attached directly to the document or the document's body. This enables catching all mouse click events that were not consumed by other click event handlers, and calling \`window.open\` without being blocked. For example, when the user selects a text, the mouse click triggers the mouse click handler attached to the document and a pop-under opens using the above code. Notice that there are more techniques to bypass the \`window.open\` call restriction by \\"hijacking\\" mouse clicks. Hover ad Hover ads, more commonly called in- page pop-ups, are a special type of pop-up ads created using Dynamic HTML, JavaScript and similar web browser technologies. Because they do not scroll with the web page, they appear to \\"hover\\" over the page, usually obscuring the content. Hover ads tend to be very hard to block by pop-up blocking software because the hover ad window is an integral part of the HTML content of the web page. Thus a software filtering the content has no algorithmic means of recognizing and removing parts of the content, either descriptive or procedural, that create, populate and manipulate the hover ad's window.  Patent controversy  ExitExchange.com filed for a patent in 2000 on a subset of pop-under advertising called an exit pop. After years of controversy and numerous articles on the pop-under patent, the patent was awarded by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in April and June 2008. The respective patent numbers are and . Patent 7,386,555 is related to the method of opening an exit pop from a toolbar or software application on a computing device, whereas Patent 7,353,229 covers the method used to open an exit pop from an embedded script found within a media file (e.g., JavaScript code on a web page).

The temporal lobe is located beneath the lateral fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain. The temporal lobe is involved in processing sensory input into derived meanings for the appropriate retention of visual memory, language comprehension, and emotion association. Temporal refers to the head's temples. Structure The temporal lobe consists of structures that are vital for declarative or long-term memory. Declarative (denotative) or explicit memory is conscious memory divided into semantic memory (facts) and episodic memory (events). Medial temporal lobe structures that are critical for long-term memory include the hippocampus, along with the surrounding hippocampal region consisting of the perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal neocortical regions. The hippocampus is critical for memory formation, and the surrounding medial temporal cortex is currently theorized to be critical for memory storage. The prefrontal and visual cortices are also involved in explicit memory. Research has shown that lesions in the hippocampus of monkeys results in limited impairment of function, whereas extensive lesions that include the hippocampus and the medial temporal cortex result in severe impairment. Function=Visual memories The temporal lobe communicates with the hippocampus and plays a key role in the formation of explicit long-term memory modulated by the amygdala. Processing sensory input ;Auditory: Adjacent areas in the superior, posterior, and lateral parts of the temporal lobes are involved in high-level auditory processing. The temporal lobe is involved in primary auditory perception, such as hearing, and holds the primary auditory cortex. The primary auditory cortex receives sensory information from the ears and secondary areas process the information into meaningful units such as speech and words. The superior temporal gyrus includes an area (within the lateral fissure) where auditory signals from the cochlea first reach the cerebral cortex and are processed by the primary auditory cortex in the left temporal lobe. ;Visual: The areas associated with vision in the temporal lobe interpret the meaning of visual stimuli and establish object recognition. The ventral part of the temporal cortices appear to be involved in high-level visual processing of complex stimuli such as faces (fusiform gyrus) and scenes (parahippocampal gyrus). Anterior parts of this ventral stream for visual processing are involved in object perception and recognition. Animation showing the position of the human left temporal lobe Language recognition The temporal lobe holds the primary auditory cortex, which is important for the processing of semantics in both speech and vision in humans. Wernicke's area, which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes, plays a key role (in tandem with Broca's area in the frontal lobe) in speech comprehension. The functions of the left temporal lobe are not limited to low- level perception but extend to comprehension, naming, and verbal memory. New memories The medial temporal lobes (near the sagittal plane) are thought to be involved in encoding declarative long term memory. The medial temporal lobes include the hippocampi, which are essential for memory storage, therefore damage to this area can result in impairment in new memory formation leading to permanent or temporary anterograde amnesia. Clinical significance=Unilateral temporal lesion * Contralateral homonymous upper quadrantanopia (sector anopsia) * Complex hallucinations (smell, sound, vision, memory) Dominant hemisphere * Receptive aphasia ** Wernicke's aphasia ** Anomic aphasia * Dyslexia * Impaired verbal memory * Word agnosia, word deafness Non-dominant hemisphere * Impaired non-verbal memory * Impaired musical skills Bitemporal lesions (additional features) * Deafness * Apathy (affective indifference) * Impaired learning and memory * Amnesia, Korsakoff syndrome, Kl√ºver‚ÄìBucy syndrome Damage Individuals who suffer from medial temporal lobe damage have a difficult time recalling visual stimuli. This neurotransmission deficit is not due to lacking perception of visual stimuli, but rather to the inability to interpret what is perceived.Pertzov, Y., Miller, T. D., Gorgoraptis, N., Caine, D., Schott, J. M., Butler, C., & Husain, M. (2013). Binding deficits in memory following medial temporal lobe damage in patients with voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibody-associated limbic encephalitis. Brain: A Journal of Neurology, 136(8), 2474-2485. The most common symptom of inferior temporal lobe damage is visual agnosia, which involves impairment in the identification of familiar objects. Another less common type of inferior temporal lobe damage is prosopagnosia which is an impairment in the recognition of faces and distinction of unique individual facial features.Mizuno, T., & Takeda, K. (2009). [The symptomatology of frontal and temporal lobe damages]. Brain And Nerve = Shinkei Kenky≈´ No Shinpo, 61(11), 1209-1218. Damage specifically to the anterior portion of the left temporal lobe can cause savant syndrome. Disorders Pick's disease, also known as frontotemporal amnesia, is caused by atrophy of the frontotemporal lobe. Emotional symptoms include mood changes, which the patient may be unaware of, including poor attention span and aggressive behavior towards themselves or others. Language symptoms include loss of speech, inability to read or write, loss of vocabulary and overall degeneration of motor ability. Temporal lobe epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures; symptoms include a variety of sensory (visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustation) hallucinations, as well as an inability to process semantic and episodic memories.Lah, S., & Smith, M. (2013). Semantic and Episodic Memory in Children With Temporal Lobe Epilepsy: Do They Relate to Literacy Skills?. Neuropsychology Schizophrenia is a severe psychotic disorder characterized by severe disorientation. Its most explicit symptom is the perception of external voices in the form of auditory hallucinations. The cause of such hallucinations has been attributed to deficits in the left temporal lobe, specifically within the primary auditory cortex.Hugdahl K, L√∏berg E-M, Nyg√•rd M. Left Temporal Lobe Structural and Functional Abnormality Underlying Auditory Hallucinations in Schizophrenia. Frontiers in Neuroscience. 2009;3(1):34-45. . Decreased gray matter, among other cellular deficits, contribute to spontaneous neural activity that affect the primary auditory cortex as if it were experiencing acoustic auditory input. The misrepresentation of speech in the auditory cortex results in the perception of external voices in the form of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenic patients.Ikuta T, DeRosse P, Argyelan M, et al. Subcortical Modulation in Auditory Processing and Auditory Hallucinations. Behavioural brain research. 2015;295:78-81. . Structural and functional MRI techniques have accounted for this neural activity by testing affected and non-affected individuals with external auditory stimuli.

Bremer was found guilty and sentenced to 63 years (53 years after an appeal) in a Maryland prison for the shooting of Wallace and three bystanders. After 35 years of incarceration, Bremer was released from prison on November 9, 2007. Early life Bremer was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the third of four sons to William and Sylvia Bremer. His two elder siblings were illegitimate and their fathers were two different men. Bremer was raised by his working-class parents on the south side of Milwaukee and lived in a dysfunctional household. Bremer stated \\"I would escape my ugly reality by pretending that I was living with a television family and there was no yelling at home or no one to hit me.\\" Bremer did not make friends in school. He was bullied by other students who shunned him. Despite his problems, he graduated from Dominican High School in 1969.New York Times, May 17, 1972 After graduating from high school, Bremer briefly attended Milwaukee Area Technical College, studying aerial photography, art, writing, and psychology, but dropped out after one semester.Pittsburgh Post Gazette, May 17, 1972 p.93  Career  Bremer was employed as a busboy at the Milwaukee Athletic Club from March 1969.

The complaint was investigated and dismissed.  Timeline of events  * On September 1, 1970 Bremer got a part-time job working as a janitor at Story Elementary School, which he quit after almost 18 months, on January 31, 1972. * On May 22, 1971, his one known friend, Thomas Neuman, died playing Russian Roulette.Palm Beach Post - May 21, 1972 * On October 16, 1971, Bremer moved from his parents' house after an argument and moved into a three-room, one bedroom apartment near Marquette University, where he lived until May 9, 1972. * Late on the night of November 18, 1971, Bremer was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and for parking in a no- parking zone. A court-appointed psychiatrist declared Bremer mentally ill, yet stable enough to continue to live in the community. Bremer underwent psychotherapy, and was released on a $38.50 fine. * December 8, 1971, Bremer pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct. Despite this, on January 13, 1972, Bremer went into the Casanova Gun Shop in Milwaukee, and bought a snub-nosed Charter Arms Undercover .38-calibre revolver for $90. * On February 16, 1972, Bremer quit his job at the Athletic club.  Plans to assassinate Richard Nixon  After a short relationship ended and he quit both of his jobs, on March 1, 1972, the unemployed Bremer began his diary with the words, \\"It is my personal plan to assassinate by pistol either Richard Nixon or George Wallace. I intend to shoot one or the other while he attends a campaign rally for the Wisconsin Primary.\\" The following evening, Bremer attended an organizational meeting for Wallace at The Pfister Hotel in Milwaukee. Although Bremer's main aim was to assassinate then-President Richard Nixon, on March 23, he attended a Wallace dinner and rally at Milwaukee's Red Carpet Airport Inn. Then on April 3, he attended a Wallace victory rally at a Holiday Inn in Milwaukee. On April 8, while preparing for a trip to Ottawa, Ontario, he put one of his guns, a Browning 9mm, under a mat in the trunk of his car, but it fell down so deeply into the right wheel well that he could not retrieve it. It was removed a week after Bremer's arrest when the car was dismantled. On April 10, he traveled from Milwaukee to Ottawa. Three days later, Bremer, dressed in a business suit, wearing sunglasses and with a revolver in his pocket, initiated an attempt to assassinate Nixon but could not find an opportunity to do so. Security was tight, making it impossible for Bremer to get close to Nixon. Bremer also doubted whether any bullets would go through the glass of Nixon's limousine. He later returned to Milwaukee where he remained for most of the following three weeks.  Plans to assassinate George Wallace  On May 4, 1972, after a ten-day break from writing, Bremer realized it would be almost impossible to assassinate Nixon, and decided that it was Wallace's \\"fate\\" to be his victim, even though his diary entries never showed the same level of interest or enthusiasm as they did with regard to assassinating Nixon. Bremer made this clear in his diary writing, \\"He (Wallace) certainly won't be buried with the snobs in Washington. ... I won't even rate a TV interruption in Russia or/Europe when the news breaks‚Äîthey never heard of Wallace.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/of-apple-pie-and-the- killing-of-presidents-bremer.html The following day, he checked out two books from the public library in Milwaukee, both detailing the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy by Sirhan Sirhan: Sirhan by Aziz Shihab and \\"R.F.K. Must Die!\\" by Robert Blair Kaiser. Despite his lack of enthusiasm, early on the morning of May 9, 1972 Bremer took a car ferry to Ludington, Michigan and visited the Wallace campaign headquarters in Silver Lake, Michigan and offered to be a volunteer. The evening after that, he attended a Wallace rally in Lansing. Two nights later, he was present at a Wallace rally in Cadillac and stayed overnight at the Reid Hotel in Kalamazoo. On the afternoon of May 13, Kalamazoo Police received an anonymous phone call saying a suspicious looking person had been sitting in a car near the National Guard Armory. When questioned, Bremer said he was waiting for the Wallace rally to begin and wanted to get a good seat. Bremer was photographed at the rally that evening, where he had a clear opportunity to shoot his target, but according to his diary, he did not do so because he might have shattered some glass and blinded some \\"stupid 15-year-olds\\" who stood nearby. Short of money and unable to afford a hotel room, Bremer slept in his car for the next two nights, as he had done on some nights the previous week. He made his final diary entry on May 14, 1972, when he drove to Maryland. Shooting Bremer turned up in Wheaton, Maryland, for Wallace's noon appearance at Wheaton Plaza for a shopping center rally on May 15, 1972. He was dressed in dark glasses; patriotic red, white, and blue, wearing his new campaign button which said \\"WALLACE in '72\\". He strongly applauded Wallace, in contrast with many others present, who heckled and taunted the speaker. Two tomatoes were thrown at Wallace during the rally, but missed. Based on this reception, Wallace refused to shake hands with anyone present, denying Bremer the opportunity to carry out his plan.https://time.com/4202693/taxi-driver-arthur-bremer-history/ At a second rally at Laurel Shopping Center, 16 miles away in Laurel, Maryland, there was minor heckling, but it did not last. About 1,000 people were present; they were mostly quiet and it was generally a friendly crowd. After he had finished speaking, Wallace shook hands with some of those present, against the advice of his Secret Service guards. At approximately 4 p.m., Bremer pushed his way forward, aimed his .38 revolver at Wallace's abdomen and opened fire, emptying the weapon before he could be subdued. He hit Wallace four times. Wallace fell back and lost a pint of blood, going into a mild state of shock. One bullet lodged in his spinal cord. The other bullets hit Wallace in the abdomen and chest. Three other people present were wounded unintentionally: Alabama State Trooper Captain E. C. Dothard, Wallace's personal bodyguard, who was shot in the stomach; Dora Thompson, a campaign volunteer, who was shot in the leg; and Nick Zarvos, a Secret Service agent. Zarvos was shot in the neck, and his speech was severely impaired following the shooting.https://boundarystones.weta.org/2015/06/24/george-wallace-shot- laurel-1972 Bremer had planned to yell his carefully chosen catchphrase, \\"A Penny For Your Thoughts!\\", as he shot Wallace. However, in the heat of the assassination attempt, he forgot to do so.The crocodile man: a case of brain chemistry and criminal violence Andr√© Mayer & Michael Wheeler. p. 7 Arrest After emptying his revolver, Bremer was wrestled to the ground and then arrested. Bremer himself was taken to a hospital for treatment of a head wound. Just after midnight, he was arraigned and taken to the Baltimore County Jail, where he would be held for the next two months. After searching Bremer's car, police described it as a \\"hotel on wheels\\". In it they found blankets, pillows, a blue steel 9mm 13-shot Browning Hi-Power semi-automatic pistol, binoculars, a woman's umbrella, a tape recorder, a portable radio with police band, an electric shaver, photographic equipment, a garment bag with several changes of clothes, a toilet kit, a 1972 copy of a Writers' Yearbook, and the two books he had borrowed from the Milwaukee public library ten days earlier. Within hours of the assassination attempt, then-President Richard M. Nixon and a top aide dispatched a political operative, E. Howard Hunt, who rushed to Milwaukee, with plans to surreptitiously enter Bremer's apartment, and plant the campaign literature of Democratic contender George McGovern's campaign as a means to drive Wallace supporters away from the Democratic Party and toward Nixon and Republican candidates. Hunt aborted his clandestine operation after the FBI had already sealed off Bremer's apartment prior to his arrival. Trial and conviction His subsequent trial in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, was condensed to five days and was held only 2¬Ω months after Bremer had shot Wallace, beginning on July 31, 1972. The defense argued that Bremer was schizophrenic and legally insane at the time of the shooting, and that he had \\"no emotional capacity to understand anything.\\" The jury rejected this argument. It almost goes without saying that the prosecution countered that Bremer was legally sane. Arthur Marshall, for the prosecution, told the court that Bremer, while disturbed and in need of psychiatric help and treatment, knew what he was doing, had been seeking glory, and was still sorry that Wallace had not died. Jonas Rappeport, the chief psychiatrist for the circuit court in Baltimore, who spent a total of nine hours with Bremer in June 1972 on four occasions, said Bremer had a \\"schizoid personality disorder with some paranoid and psychopathic features,\\"The south-east missourian - 2 August 1972 but also stated that this didn't \\"substantially impair his capacity to understand the criminality of his actions.\\" On August 4, 1972, the jury of six men and six women took 95 minutes to reach their verdict. Bremer was sentenced to 63 years in prison for shooting Wallace and three other people. When asked if he had anything to say, Bremer replied, \\"Well, Mr. Marshall mentioned that he would like society to be protected from someone like me. Looking back on my life I would have liked it if society had protected me from myself. That's all I have to say at this time.\\" The sentence was reduced to 53 years on September 28, 1972, after an appeal. On July 6, 1973, Bremer's second appeal to have the sentence reduced further was rejected. Aftermath A 113-page portion of Bremer's diary was published in 1973 as An Assassin's Diary; it covers the period from April 4, 1972‚Äîwhich, incidentally, was the day on which George McGovern won the Wisconsin primary‚Äîto the day before he shot Wallace and Bremer's subsequent arrest. In it, Bremer states that he was not particularly opposed to Wallace's political agenda, which was notable for its pro- segregationist stance, but that his primary motive was to become infamous and to gain notoriety. The first half of Bremer's diary (pp. 1‚Äì148) was found on August 26, 1980, where he had concealed it, heavily wrapped in a plastic suitcase at the foot of Milwaukee's 27th Street viaduct. It was dated from March 1 to April 3, 1972.Associated Press. \\"Finder can keep Bremer diary\\" Tuscaloosa News September 11, 1981, p. 2. In it, Bremer discusses his desire to kill Nixon (Wallace was clearly a secondary target) and fantasizes about killing unnamed individuals who have angered him. He also imagines opening fire at random at the corner of 3rd Street and Wisconsin Avenue downtown and confesses his admiration for Vel Phillips, a pioneering black office holder in Milwaukee, who was elected and began serving as Secretary of State of Wisconsin when the diary was found. The diary was eventually sold to an official of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who donated it to UAB's Reynolds Historical Library.AP. \\"Bremer diary traces nightmare journey.\\" Tuscaloosa News June 16, 1985, p. 20A. Although Bremer's actions, trial and conviction attracted media attention, he soon faded into comparative obscurity. He did not reach the level of infamy of Lee Harvey Oswald or John Wilkes Booth, both of whom had assassinated presidents. Bremer's assassination attempt did not end Wallace's political career. Wallace was subsequently elected governor of Alabama twice, in 1974 and 1982. However, the result of the assassination attempt, combined with changes in Wallace's personal and general political circumstances ended Wallace's presidential aspirations. Public concerns over Wallace's health meant he would never gain the momentum he had in the 1972 campaign. He entered the presidential election race in 1976 but withdrew early due to lack of significant support. Wallace forgave Bremer in August 1995 and wrote to him expressing the hope that the two could get to know each other better.\\"Pope-Wallace meeting remembered\\", The Decatur Daily, Decatur, Alabama. April 6, 2005. URL retrieved on December 23, 2006. Bremer did not reply. George Wallace died on September 13, 1998. Sentence and release Bremer served his sentence at the Maryland Correctional Institution (MCI-H) in Hagerstown. Bremer was placed in solitary confinement for 30 days after a fight on October 6, 1972. He was reprimanded after another fight in December 1972, and then placed in solitary again for 30 days after a third fight in February 1973. In prison, he declined to receive mental health treatment or evaluation. He worked in the prison library and was described by the chairman of the Maryland Parole Commission, David Blumberg, as \\"compliant and unobtrusive.\\" He was visited multiple times by his parents before they died. According to 1997 parole records, psychological testing indicated releasing him would be risky. He argued in his June 1996 hearing that \\"Shooting segregationist dinosaurs wasn't as bad as harming mainstream politicians.\\"\\"Mourners praise George Wallace at vigil\\" , Cable News Network, Inc. (CNN). September 16, 1998. URL retrieved on December 23, 2006. Bremer was released from prison on November 9, 2007, at the age of 57, having served 35 years of his original sentence. His probation ends in 2025. Conditions of his release include electronic monitoring and staying away from elected officials and candidates. He must undergo a mental health evaluation and receive treatment if the state deems it necessary, and may not leave the state without written permission from the state agency that will supervise him until the end of his probation.

It was the third largest settlement in the archipelago (after Longyearbyen and Barentsburg). Around 300 workers living in Longyearbyen commuted to Sveagruva for work on a daily or weekly basis. Sveagruva has no permanent inhabitants. The mine was operated by Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani. There is no road to Longyearbyen or any other settlements, so travel is done by air from Svea Airport and coal transport by ship from a port southwest. History The town was established in 1917 by Swedes. It was thereafter destroyed in 1944, but quickly re-established after World War II. The mining activity ceased in 1949, and was not re-established until 1970. Mining was suspended for a short period in 1987. In the 1990s, the town nearly vanished, as mines in Longyearbyen proved more productive and accessible. In 2005, a mine fire erupted, lasting uninterrupted for more than five weeks, and causing 700 million Norwegian kroner worth of damage. Sveagruva held the most productive coal mine of Svalbard, the Svea Nord longwall mine. Opened in 2001, the mine produces up to 4 million metric tons of coal annually, making it one of the largest underground coal mines in Europe. The mine closed for good in March 2020.

She is a member of the SPD. From 1993 to 2005 she served as the Minister President of Schleswig-Holstein. She was the first woman to serve as head of a state government in German history and the only woman to do so in the 20th century. Life Simonis earned her high school degree (Abitur) in 1962 in N√ºrnberg. She then studied economics and sociology at the Universities of Erlangen-N√ºrnberg and Kiel, graduating with a degree in economics in 1967. She worked in different positions after 1967. Simonis has been married to university professor Udo Simonis. Political career Simonis joined the SPD in 1969. She was elected to the German Bundestag in 1976. In 1992, she became a member of the legislature of Schleswig-Holstein. On 19 May 1993, she was elected Minister President of said state, after her predecessor Bj√∂rn Engholm resigned from that position due to a scandal. She was the first woman in Germany to rise to this level in politics. The state election in 1996 saw the SPD drop down to 39.8% (from 46.2% in 1992), but Simonis was able to form a coalition with the Greens. In February 2000, at the height of a CDU party financing scandal, the SPD was able to enlarge its share to 43.1%. Despite basing its 2005 election campaign on Simonis' popularity, the SPD suffered a heavy defeat due to the bad economic situation and dropped down to 38.7% (for the first time in almost twenty years behind the CDU). On 17 March 2005 Simonis failed to be re-elected as Minister President of Schleswig-Holstein in 4 consecutive ballots by the Landtag (parliament) of Schleswig-Holstein. In the 1st ballot she received 34 votes and Peter Harry Carstensen (CDU) received 33 while 2 deputies cast empty votes. Neither Simonis nor Carstensen got the absolute majority (35 votes). In the 2nd and 3rd ballot the candidates received 34 votes each. Obviously one deputy of the alliance of SPD, Gr√ºne (Greens) and SSW abstained. An unprecedented 4th ballot brought the same result. Simonis has since stepped down as Minister President of Schleswig-Holstein. UNICEF From 2005 until February 2008 Simonis served as Chief of the German UNICEF. She resigned from this position due to a scandal related to donations to the organisation that arose during her term.

Between 1964 and July 1965, he was the lead guitarist of an early rock band that would later become Pink Floyd. Although he recorded a few songs with that band, he left before their transformation into Pink Floyd. However, on the band's official Facebook page, he is given status as an official former member.  Name confusion  Klose's full birth name is most often cited as Rado Robert Klose or Rado Robert Garcia Klose, with some authors citing RadovanChapman, Rob (2010) \\"Syd Barrett: A Very Irregular Head\\". Faber. , page 22 as his full given name. During the 1960s he was commonly known as Bob Klose, which was often misspelled Bob Close or occasionally even Brian Close. On the official Pink Floyd website, he is listed as Klose, Radovan 'Bob'.Radovan 'Bob' Klose at the official Pink Floyd website http://www.pinkfloyd.com/music/musicians_live.php  Biography  Klose was born 1945 in Cambridge. His father was a refugee from Nazi Germany and a veteran of the Spanish civil war, and his mother was an English Land Girl. Due to their poor financial situation, the family lived in a field tent on a farm where Klose's father worked for a couple of years until moving to a small Cambridgeshire village. After several village schools, Klose attended school in Cambridge, where he met Syd Barrett and Roger Waters. He later moved to London to study architecture and then science at the Regent Street Polytechnic, before abandoning studies to completely devote himself to photography in the late 1960s.  Early musical career  During his architectural studies, Klose started playing lead guitar in a band with Roger Waters (guitar), Richard Wright (rhythm guitar), Nick Mason (drums), Clive Metcalfe (bass guitar), and Keith Noble and Juliette Gale (vocals). The band performed rhythm and blues under various names (\\"Sigma 6\\", \\"The Meggadeaths\\", \\"The Abdabs\\", and \\"The Screaming Abdabs\\"), during their run with manager Ken Chapman, who also wrote some early material for the band. Metcalfe, Noble and Gale left the band (though Gale would go on to marry Richard Wright). By the time they left, the line-up included Syd Barrett (rhythm guitar and vocals) and Bob Klose (lead guitar and vocals), with Roger Waters on bass and vocals, Richard Wright on organ and vocals and Nick Mason on drums. This new group used various names, often fluctuating between \\"Tea Set\\" and \\"The Pink Floyd Sound\\" (named after two old Carolina bluesmen, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). The word \\"Sound\\" was dropped from the band's name, with the definite article disappearing a few years later. Klose was more focused on his studies than on the band and was more interested in jazz and blues than Barrett's psychedelia and pop, so he left the band sometime around July 1965. Barrett assumed lead guitar, lead vocals, and the bulk of the songwriting, while Klose went on to become a photographer and print maker.  Recent years  Klose confirmed in John Edginton's BBC documentary The Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett Story (2001) that his guitar can be heard on the unreleased early acetate single \\"Lucy Leave/\\"I'm a King Bee\\". In the documentary he also talked about Syd Barrett: \\"If you had said to a young Syd, 'Look, this is your bargain in life, you know, you're going to do this fantastic stuff, but it won't be forever, it'll be this short period. There's the dotted line, are you going to sign for this?' I suspect, maybe, a lot of people would sign for that, for making their mark.\\" The two songs were eventually released, with Klose crediting as \\"Rado Klose\\", in 1965: Their First Recordings (2015) In 2006, Klose wrote an accompanying essay for a picture book of previously unpublished Rowland Hilder's watercolour paintings, entitled Rowland Hilder's British Isles. Klose appeared as a guest performer on David Gilmour's 2006 album On an Island (credited as \\"Rado Klose\\" rather than his former professional name \\"Bob Klose\\"). The same year, he appeared on Paul \\"Mudd\\" Murphy's album Claremont 56, as well as Chico Hamilton's album Juniflip, on which he is also listed as a co-writer for one of the songs (\\"Kerry's Caravan\\"). On both of these albums, he is credited as \\"Bob Klose\\". In 2007 he took part in BBC Radio 2's program \\"Days in the Life\\", which was dedicated to Pink Floyd. In the first part of this show he spoke about early days with Barrett. He also played on Blue River, a 2007 electronic album by Smith & Mudd, a collaboration between Paul \\"Mudd\\" Murphy and multi-instrumentalist/producer Benjamin James Smith.

He is best known for the discovery of what is now called the Kerr effect. Life and work John Kerr was born on 17 December 1824 at Ardrossan, Scotland. He was a student in Glasgow from 1841 to 1846, and at the Theological College of the Free Church of Scotland, in Edinburgh, in 1849. Starting in 1857 he was mathematical lecturer at the Free Church Training College in Glasgow. He died in Glasgow in 1907.See the very brief biographical sketch in Lewis, E. P. (Editor), The Effects of a Magnetic Field on Radiation (1900), New York: American Book Company, page 64 Kerr's most important experimental work was the discovery of double refraction in solid and liquid dielectrics in an electrostatic field (1875) which is now known as Kerr effect. In the Kerr effect, difference between refractive index experienced by ordinary and extraordinary ray is proportional to the square of the electric field. Where the relationship is linear, the effect is known as the Pockels effect. Kerr also demonstrated a similar phenomenon for magnetic fields, and it is now called the magneto-optic Kerr effect. Light from lasers allows the achievement of the effect using the light's own electric field, the AC Kerr effect. The Kerr effect is exploited in the Kerr cell, which is used in applications such as shutters in high-speed photography, with shutter-speeds as fast as 100 ns. In 1928 Karolus & Mittelstaedt used a Kerr cell to modulate a beam of light to measure its speed. Earlier measurements had used mechanical means of modulation achieving frequencies of around 10 kHz, but the Kerr cell allow frequencies of 10 MHz and greater precision of measurement. Kerr's original cell was a glass block. Modern cells are more commonly filled with liquids such as nitrobenzene.Steele (2004) Kerr also was an early champion of the metric system in the UK.See Kerr, J.

It looks similar to grits, but is smoother in texture since it is made with ground wheat kernels instead of ground corn. It was first manufactured in the United States in 1893 by wheat millers in Grand Forks, North Dakota.History of Cream of Wheat The product made its debut at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. Before January 2007, Cream of Wheat was a Nabisco brand made by Kraft Foods. In January 2007, B&G; Foods acquired the brand and all rights to market the cereal. \\"Cream of Wheat\\" is a registered trademark. The rice-based Cream of Rice also forms part of the product line, and is often a recommended early food for infants and toddlers and for people who cannot tolerate wheat or gluten, such as persons with celiac disease. Preparation Cream of Wheat is prepared from the box by boiling water or milk, then pouring in the farina while stirring. As it is stirred, the farina starts to thicken. The use of milk instead of (or in addition to) water gives the food a creamier taste. In the United States market, there are three unflavored mixes available (10-minute, 2 1/2-minute and 1-minute). In the Canadian market, there are two unflavored mixes available (8-minute and 3-minute). Cream of Wheat is also sold as an instant formulation which includes the use of single-serving packets. These are prepared by simply mixing their contents with hot water and allowing the result to set in a bowl for approximately two minutes. It is common to customize the hot cereal with the addition of sugar, fruit, or nuts. As a result, several flavors are sold of the instant variety: Original, Apples 'N' Cinnamon, Maple Brown Sugar, Strawberries 'N' Cream, and Cinnamon Swirl. In October 2012, Cream of Wheat added a new chocolate flavor to their instant line. Their most recent addition to the varieties of instant Cream of Wheat Cereals is Bananas & Cream. Package design and controversy The original boxes of Cream of Wheat were handmade and lettered, and they were emblazoned with the image of an African American chef produced by Emery Mapes. The character was named Rastus and was developed by artist Edward V. Brewer. Rastus was included on all boxes and advertisements. It has long been thought that a chef named Frank L. White was the model for the chef shown on the Cream of Wheat box‚Äîa claim White himself made. White's headstone contains his name and an etching taken from the man depicted on the Cream of Wheat box. Leading up to 2020, there had been public pressure aimed at various companies to change branding that had racist origins, such as Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben's. The character of Rastus had once been depicted as a cook who was barely literate and did not know about vitamins. Rastus is also a derogatory term traditionally associated with African Americans in the United States. For these reasons, B&G; Foods had been under public pressure for years to make changes. Public demands to remove symbols of racism increased during the 2020 protests around racism. In response, on June 17, 2020, B&G; Foods announced that they were ‚Äúinitiating an immediate review of the Cream of Wheat brand packaging.‚Äù On September 25, 2020, the company announced that the chef's image would be removed from all Cream of Wheat packaging. Marketing Famous illustrators such as N.C. Wyeth, J.C. Leyendecker & Henry Hutt all created ads for the Cream of Wheat brand.

The program's core philosophy is that autistic people can participate in authentic emotional relationships if they are exposed to them in a gradual, systematic way. The goal of treatment is to systematically build up the motivation and tools for successfully interacting in social relationships, to correct deficits in this area that are thought to be common to all autistic people. RDI focuses on cultivating the building blocks of social connection‚Äîsuch as referencing, emotion sharing, coregulation, and experience sharing‚Äîthat normally develop in infancy and early childhood. RDI is a family-based program, where trained consultants support families to alter their interaction and communication styles. There is a period of parent education, followed by an assessment of both the child and the child-parent relationship. After that consultants support the family through a set of specific objectives to build a \\"guided participation\\" relationship between parents and child that will allow the child to once again become a \\"cognitive apprentice\\" to the parents. Once the cognitive apprenticeship is in place, the family can move on to specific cognitive remediation objectives for the child. These are developmentally staged objectives designed to restore optimal neural connectivity through a series of \\"discoveries\\" and \\"elaborations\\". After four years, the RDI Program has evolved into RDIconnect, a company with a series of programs not only for autistics, but for other populations as well. Along with a Consultant Training program, RDIConnect now offers the Family Guided Participation Program, Dynamic Education Program and the RDI Program for ASD, each accompanied by tools that help organize, expedite and create a continuous dialogue between professional and parent. RDIConnect now applies the quality assurance, level of treatment and training that has been central to their internationally known program and to a new audience. History The RDI program was developed by the psychologist Steven Gutstein in the 1990s. Gutstein studied the means by which typical children become competent in the world of emotional relationships. He looked at the research in developmental psychology and found that early parent-infant interaction predicted later abilities in language, thinking and social development. Two books of RDI-based activities as well as a book explaining the background ideas were published in 2002, but RDI has changed significantly since then and is now only available through the RDI_LS, or learning system, accessed by trained consultants. There are now trained consultants in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Singapore, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, and Switzerland. Latest publications by Dr. Steven Gutstein are: My Baby Can Dance - Stories of Autism, Asperger's and Success through the Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) Program (2005), The Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) Program and Education (2007), and The RDI Book - Forging New Pathways for Autism, Asperger's and PDD with the Relationship Development Intervention Program (2009). Major ideas RDI is based on the idea that \\"dynamic intelligence\\" must be enhanced for autistic children to develop typical behaviors. Dynamic Intelligence means being able to think flexibly, take different perspectives, cope with change, and process information simultaneously (e.g. listen and look at the same time). These abilities are essential in the real world. Neural underconnectivity in autistic people leads to a rigid and static view of the world. Because of this dislike of change and inability to cope with new information, autistic people do not develop dynamic intelligence which is essential for relationships, independence and quality of life. Typical children develop dynamic intelligence through guided participation, that is being guided and given challenges by their caregivers. Due to their social difficulties, this relationship breaks down in autistic children and so families must be supported to re-build it, in a slow and more deliberate manner. Children need to learn to reference their parents, share emotions and use experience-sharing language to build a close and trusting relationship where they can learn and cope with the uncertainty of life. The six objectives of RDI are to improve the following: * Emotional referencing: learning from the subjective and emotional experiences of others * Social coordination: controlling behavior and observing others to enable participation in social relationships * Declarative language: using language and non-verbal communication to interact with others * Flexible thinking: adapting and altering plans when circumstances change * Relational information processing: placing things in context and solving problems lacking clear solutions * Foresight and hindsight: anticipating future possibilities based on past experiences Effectiveness While the Connections Center has conducted two studies into RDI, there have been as yet no independent studies, although there is currently one study being conducted at the University of Sydney, Australia. In a 2007 study, children whose families had participated in RDI and who had relatively high IQ at start of treatment showed dramatic changes in diagnostic category on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), though the study represented a non-experimental study without a control group and whose evaluators were not blinded to time in treatment.

In Russia, they are also known as tvorozhniki (—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–æÃÅ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–∏). They are a part of Belarusian, Russian, Ukrainian, Latvian (sir≈Üiki) and Serbian cuisine. Their simplicity and delicious taste have made them very popular in Eastern Europe.  Etymology  The name syrniki is derived from the word syr (—Å—ã—Ä), which now generally means \\"(hard) cheese\\" in Russian, but once partly stood for soft curd cheese. The Ukrainian language retains the old Slavic sense of the word, as in domashnii syr (–¥–æ–º–∞—à–Ω—ñ–π —Å–∏—Ä, literal translation 'domestic cheese'), whereas in Russian, another old Slavic word for curd cheese, namely the word tvorog (—Ç–≤–æ—Ä–æ–≥), is used.  Preparation  Syrniki with raisins Syrnyky or tvorozhniki are made from creamy quark, mixed with flour, eggs and sugar, sometimes adding vanilla extract. Pot cheese or farmer's cheese is suggested as a substitute for the tvorog. The soft mixture is shaped into cakes, which are pan- or shallow-fried in vegetable oil or in hot butter. The consistency should remain slightly creamy, while they are slightly browned on both sides. They are traditionally sweet and served for breakfast or dessert, but can be made savory as well. Raisins, chopped dried apricot, fresh apples or pears are sometimes added into the batter. They are typically served with varenye, jam, smetana (sour cream) and / or melted butter.

Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, nausea, and abdominal pain. It makes up about 20% of cases of antibiotic- associated diarrhea. Complications may include pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, perforation of the colon, and sepsis. Clostridioides difficile infection is spread by bacterial spores found within feces. Surfaces may become contaminated with the spores with further spread occurring via the hands of healthcare workers. Risk factors for infection include antibiotic or proton pump inhibitor use, hospitalization, other health problems, and older age. Diagnosis is by stool culture or testing for the bacteria's DNA or toxins. If a person tests positive but has no symptoms, the condition is known as C. difficile colonization rather than an infection. Prevention efforts include terminal room cleaning in hospitals, limiting antibiotic use, and handwashing campaigns in hospitals. Alcohol based hand sanitizer does not appear effective. Discontinuation of antibiotics may result in resolution of symptoms within three days in about 20% of those infected. The antibiotics metronidazole, vancomycin or fidaxomicin, will cure the infection. Retesting after treatment, as long as the symptoms have resolved, is not recommended, as a person may often remain colonized. Recurrences have been reported in up to 25% of people. Some tentative evidence indicates fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics may decrease the risk of recurrence. C. difficile infections occur in all areas of the world. About 453,000 cases occurred in the United States in 2011, resulting in 29,000 deaths. Global rates of disease increased between 2001 and 2016. C. difficile infections occur more often in women than men. The bacterium was discovered in 1935 and found to be disease-causing in 1978. In the United States, healthcare- associated infections increase the cost of care by US$1.5 billion each year. Although C. difficile is a common healthcare-associated infection, at most 30% of infections are transmitted within hospitals. The majority of infections are acquired outside of hospitals, where medications and a recent history of diarrheal illnesses (e.g. laxative abuse or food poisoning due to Salmonellosis) are thought to drive the risk of colonization.  Signs and symptoms  Signs and symptoms of CDI range from mild diarrhea to severe life- threatening inflammation of the colon. In adults, a clinical prediction rule found the best signs to be significant diarrhea (\\"new onset of more than three partially formed or watery stools per 24-hour period\\"), recent antibiotic exposure, abdominal pain, fever (up to 40.5 ¬∞C or 105 ¬∞F), and a distinctive foul odor to the stool resembling horse manure. In a hospital population, prior antibiotic treatment plus diarrhea or abdominal pain had a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 45%. In this study with a prevalence of positive cytotoxin assays of 14%, the positive predictive value was 18% and the negative predictive value was 94%. In children, the most prevalent symptom of a CDI is watery diarrhea with at least three bowel movements a day for two or more days, which may be accompanied by fever, loss of appetite, nausea, and/or abdominal pain. Those with a severe infection also may develop serious inflammation of the colon and have little or no diarrhea.  Cause  How C. difficile spreads Infection with C. difficile bacteria is responsible for C. difficile diarrhea.  C. difficile  Individual, drumstick-shaped C. difficile bacilli seen through scanning electron microscopy C. difficile colonies on a blood agar plate Clostridia are anaerobic motile bacteria, ubiquitous in nature, and especially prevalent in soil. Under the microscope, they appear as long, irregular (often drumstick- or spindle-shaped) cells with a bulge at their terminal ends. Under Gram staining, C. difficile cells are Gram-positive and show optimum growth on blood agar at human body temperatures in the absence of oxygen. When stressed, the bacteria produce spores that are able to tolerate extreme conditions that the active bacteria cannot tolerate. C. difficile may colonize the human colon without symptom; approximately 2‚Äì5% of the adult population are carriers, although it varies considerably with demographics. The risk of colonization has been linked to a history of unrelated diarrheal illnesses (e.g. laxative abuse and food poisoning due to Salmonellosis or Vibrio cholerae infection). Pathogenic C. difficile strains produce multiple toxins. The most well-characterized are enterotoxin (Clostridium difficile toxin A) and cytotoxin (Clostridium difficile toxin B), both of which may produce diarrhea and inflammation in infected people, although their relative contributions have been debated. Toxins A and B are glucosyltransferases that target and inactivate the Rho family of GTPases. Toxin B (cytotoxin) induces actin depolymerization by a mechanism correlated with a decrease in the ADP-ribosylation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins. Another toxin, binary toxin, also has been described, but its role in disease is not fully understood. Antibiotic treatment of CDIs may be difficult, due both to antibiotic resistance and physiological factors of the bacteria (spore formation, protective effects of the pseudomembrane). The emergence of a new and highly toxic strain of C. difficile that is resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, said to be causing geographically dispersed outbreaks in North America, was reported in 2005. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta warned of the emergence of an epidemic strain with increased virulence, antibiotic resistance, or both. C. difficile is transmitted from person to person by the fecal-oral route. The organism forms heat-resistant spores that are not killed by alcohol-based hand cleansers or routine surface cleaning. Thus, these spores survive in clinical environments for long periods. Because of this, the bacteria may be cultured from almost any surface. Once spores are ingested, their acid-resistance allows them to pass through the stomach unscathed. Upon exposure to bile acids, they germinate and multiply into vegetative cells in the colon. People without a history of gastrointestinal disturbances due to antibiotic use or diarrheal illness less likely to become colonized by C. difficile. In 2005, molecular analysis led to the identification of the C. difficile strain type characterized as group BI by restriction endonuclease analysis, as North American pulse-field-type NAP1 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and as ribotype 027; the differing terminology reflects the predominant techniques used for epidemiological typing. This strain is referred to as C. difficile BI/NAP1/027.  Risk factors  Antibiotics = C. difficile colitis is associated most strongly with the use of these antibiotics: fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and clindamycin. Some research suggests the routine use of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as C. difficile. = Healthcare environment = People are most often infected in hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical institutions, although infection outside medical settings is increasing. Individuals can develop the infection if they touch objects or surfaces that are contaminated with feces and then touch their mouth or mucous membranes. Healthcare workers could possibly spread the bacteria or contaminate surfaces through hand contact. The rate of C. difficile acquisition is estimated to be 13% in those with hospital stays of up to two weeks, and 50% with stays longer than four weeks. Long-term hospitalization or residence in a nursing home within the previous year are independent risk factors for increased colonization. = Acid suppression medication = Increasing rates of community-acquired CDI are associated with the use of medication to suppress gastric acid production: H2-receptor antagonists increased the risk 1.5-fold, and proton pump inhibitors by 1.7 with once-daily use and 2.4 with more than once-daily use. = Diarrheal illnesses = People with a recent history of diarrheal illness are at increased risk of becoming colonized by C. difficile when exposed to spores, including laxative abuse and gastrointestinal pathogens. Disturbances that increase intestinal motility are thought to transiently elevate the concentration of available dietary sugars, allowing C. difficile to proliferate and gain a foothold in the gut. Although not all colonization events lead to disease, asymptomatic carriers remain colonized for years at a time. During this time, the abundance of C. difficile varies considerably day- to-day, causing periods of increased shedding that could substantially contribute to community-acquired infection rates. = Other = As a result of suppression of healthy bacteria, via a loss of bacterial food source, prolonged use of an elemental diet increases the risk of developing C. difficile infection. Low serum albumin levels is a risk factor for the development of C. difficile infection and when infected for severe disease. The protective effects of serum albumin may be related to the capability of this protein to bind C. difficile toxin A and toxin B, thus impairing entry into enterocytes.  Pathophysiology  The use of systemic antibiotics, including broad-spectrum penicillins/cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and clindamycin, causes the normal microbiota of the bowel to be altered. In particular, when the antibiotic kills off other competing bacteria in the intestine, any bacteria remaining will have less competition for space and nutrients. The net effect is to permit more extensive growth than normal of certain bacteria. C. difficile is one such type of bacterium. In addition to proliferating in the bowel, C. difficile also produces toxins. Without either toxin A or toxin B, C. difficile may colonize the gut, but is unlikely to cause pseudomembranous colitis. The colitis associated with severe infection is part of an inflammatory reaction, with the \\"pseudomembrane\\" formed by a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.  Diagnosis  Micrograph of a colonic pseudomembrane in C. difficile colitis, a type of pseudomembranous colitis, H&E; stain Endoscopic image of pseudomembranous colitis, with yellow pseudomembranes seen on the wall of the sigmoid colon Pseudomembranous colitis on computed tomography Prior to the advent of tests to detect C. difficile toxins, the diagnosis most often was made by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. The appearance of \\"pseudomembranes\\" on the mucosa of the colon or rectum is highly suggestive, but not diagnostic of the condition. The pseudomembranes are composed of an exudate made of inflammatory debris, white blood cells. Although colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are still employed, now stool testing for the presence of C. difficile toxins is frequently the first-line diagnostic approach. Usually, only two toxins are tested for‚Äîtoxin A and toxin B‚Äîbut the organism produces several others. This test is not 100% accurate, with a considerable false-negative rate even with repeat testing.  Cytotoxicity assay  C. difficile toxins have a cytopathic effect in cell culture, and neutralization of any effect observed with specific antisera is the practical gold standard for studies investigating new CDI diagnostic techniques. Toxigenic culture, in which organisms are cultured on selective media and tested for toxin production, remains the gold standard and is the most sensitive and specific test, although it is slow and labor-intensive.  Toxin ELISA  Assessment of the A and B toxins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for toxin A or B (or both) has a sensitivity of 63‚Äì99% and a specificity of 93‚Äì100%. Previously, experts recommended sending as many as three stool samples to rule out disease if initial tests are negative, but evidence suggests repeated testing during the same episode of diarrhea is of limited value and should be discouraged. C. difficile toxin should clear from the stool of somebody previously infected if treatment is effective. Many hospitals only test for the prevalent toxin A. Strains that express only the B toxin are now present in many hospitals, however, so testing for both toxins should occur. Not testing for both may contribute to a delay in obtaining laboratory results, which is often the cause of prolonged illness and poor outcomes.  Other stool tests  Stool leukocyte measurements and stool lactoferrin levels also have been proposed as diagnostic tests, but may have limited diagnostic accuracy.  PCR  Testing of stool samples by real-time polymerase chain reaction is able to detect C. difficile about 93% of the time and when positive is incorrectly positive about 3% of the time. This is more accurate than cytotoxigenic culture or cell cytotoxicity assay. Another benefit is that the result can be achieved within three hours. Drawbacks include a higher cost and the fact that the test only looks for the gene for the toxin and not the toxin itself. The latter means that if the test is used without confirmation, overdiagnosis may occur. Repeat testing may be misleading, and testing specimens more than once every seven days in people without new symptoms is highly unlikely to yield useful information.JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY, Oct. 2010, p. 3738‚Äì3741  Prevention  Self containment by housing people in private rooms is important to prevent the spread of C. difficile. Contact precautions are an important part of preventing the spread of C. difficile. C. difficile does not often occur in people who are not taking antibiotics so limiting use of antibiotics decreases the risk.  Antibiotics  The most effective method for preventing CDI is proper antibiotic prescribing. In the hospital setting, where CDI is most common, most people who develop CDI are exposed to antibiotics. Although proper antibiotic prescribing is highly recommended, about 50% is considered inappropriate. This is consistent whether in the hospital, clinic, community, or academic setting. A decrease in CDI by limiting antibiotics or by limiting unnecessary prescriptions in general, both in an outbreak and nonoutbreak setting has been demonstrated to be most strongly associated with reduced CDI. Further, reactions to medication may be severe: CDI infections were the most common contributor to adverse drug events seen in U.S. hospitals in 2011.Weiss AJ, Elixhauser A. Origin of Adverse Drug Events in U.S. Hospitals, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #158. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD. July 2013. In some regions of the UK, reduced used of fluoroquinolone antibiotics seems to lead to reduced rates of CDI.Curbing Antibiotics Tied to Britain's Drop in C. diff. Jan 2017  Probiotics  Some evidence indicates probiotics may be useful to prevent infection and recurrence. Treatment with Saccharomyces boulardii in those who are not immunocompromised with C. difficile also may be useful. Initially, in 2010, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended against their use due to the risk of complications. Subsequent reviews, however, did not find an increase in adverse effects with treatment, and overall treatment appears safe and moderately effective in preventing Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea.  Infection control  Rigorous infection protocols are required to minimize this risk of transmission.Mayo Clinic C. diff prevention Infection control measures, such as wearing gloves and noncritical medical devices used for a single person with CDI, are effective at prevention. This works by limiting the spread of C. difficile in the hospital setting. In addition, washing with soap and water will eliminate the spores from contaminated hands, but alcohol-based hand rubs are ineffective. These precautions should remain in place among those in hospital for at least 2 days after the diarrhea has stopped. Bleach wipes containing 0.55% sodium hypochlorite have been shown to kill the spores and prevent transmission. Installing lidded toilets and closing the lid prior to flushing also reduces the risk of contamination. Those who have CDIs should be in rooms with other people with CDIs or by themselves when in hospital. Common hospital disinfectants are ineffective against C. difficile spores, and may promote spore formation, but disinfectants containing a 10:1 ratio of water to bleach effectively kill the spores. Hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) systems used to sterilize a room after treatment is completed have been shown to reduce infection rates and to reduce risk of infection to others. The incidence of CDI was reduced by 53%Boyce et al. 2008 or 42%Manian et al. 2010 through use of HPV. Ultraviolet cleaning devices, and housekeeping staff especially dedicated to disinfecting the rooms of people with C. difficile after discharge may be effective.  Treatment  Carrying C. difficile without symptoms is common. Treatment in those without symptoms is controversial. In general, mild cases do not require specific treatment. Oral rehydration therapy is useful in treating dehydration associated with the diarrhea.  Medications  Several different antibiotics are used for C. difficile, with the available agents being more or less equally effective. Vancomycin or fidaxomicin by mouth are the typically recommended for mild, moderate, and severe infections. They are also the first-line treatment for pregnant women, especially since metronidazole may cause birth defects. Typical vancomycin is taken four times a day by mouth for 10 days. It may also be given rectally if the person develops an ileus. Fidaxomicin is tolerated as well as vancomycin, and may have a lower risk of recurrence. Fidaxomicin has been found to be as effective as vancomycin in those with mild to moderate disease, and it may be better than vancomycin in those with severe disease. Fidaxomicin may be used in those who have recurrent infections and have not responded to other antibiotics. Metronidazole by mouth is recommended as an alternative treatment only for C. difficile infections when the affected person is allergic to first-line treatments, is unable to tolerate them, or has financial difficulties preventing them from accessing them. In fulminant disease vancomycin by mouth and intravenous metronidazole are commonly used together. Medications used to slow or stop diarrhea, such as loperamide, have been thought to have the potential to worsen C. difficile disease, and they are not generally recommended. Evidence to support worse outcomes with use however is poor. Cholestyramine, an ion exchange resin, is effective in binding both toxin A and B, slowing bowel motility, and helping prevent dehydration. Cholestyramine is recommended with vancomycin. A last-resort treatment in those who are immunosuppressed is intravenous immunoglobulin. Monoclonal antibodies against C. difficile toxin A and C. difficile toxin B are approved to prevent recurrence of C. difficile infection including bezlotoxumab., FDA Approves Merck‚Äôs ZINPLAVA‚Ñ¢ (bezlotoxumab) to Reduce Recurrence of Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) in Adult Patients Receiving Antibacterial Drug Treatment for CDI Who Are at High Risk of CDI Recurrence  Probiotics  Evidence to support the use of probiotics in the treatment of active disease is insufficient.  Stool transplant  Fecal microbiota transplant, also known as a stool transplant, is roughly 85% to 90% effective in those for whom antibiotics have not worked. It involves infusion of the microbiota acquired from the feces of a healthy donor to reverse the bacterial imbalance responsible for the recurring nature of the infection. The procedure replenishes the normal colonic microbiota that had been wiped out by antibiotics, and re-establishes resistance to colonization by Clostridioides difficile. Side effects, at least initially, are few. Some evidence looks hopeful that fecal transplant can be delivered in the form of a pill. They are available in the United States, but are not FDA-approved as of 2015.  Surgery  In those with severe C. difficile colitis, colectomy may improve the outcomes. Specific criteria may be used to determine who will benefit most from surgery. Recurrent infection Several treatment options exist for recurrent C difficile infection. For the first episode of recurrent C difficile infection, the 2017 IDSA guidelines recommend oral vancomycin at a dose of 125 mg four times daily for 10 days if metronidazole was used for the initial episode. If oral vancomycin was used for the initial episode, then a prolonged oral vancomycin pulse dose of 125 mg four times daily for 10-14 days followed by a taper (twice daily for one week, then every two to three days for 2-8 weeks) or fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days. For a second recurrent episode, the IDSA recommends options including the aforementioned oral vancomycin pulse dose followed by the prolonged taper; oral vancomycin 125 mg four times daily for 10 days followed by rifaximin 400 mg three times daily for 20 days; fidaxomicin 200 mg twice daily for 10 days, or a fecal microbiota transplant.  Prognosis  After a first treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin, C. difficile recurs in about 20% of people. This increases to 40% and 60% with subsequent recurrences.  Epidemiology  C. difficile diarrhea is estimated to occur in eight of 100,000 people each year. Among those who are admitted to hospital, it occurs in between four and eight people per 1,000. In 2011, it resulted in about half a million infections and 29,000 deaths in the United States. Due in part to the emergence of a fluoroquinolone-resistant strain, C. difficile-related deaths increased 400% between 2000 and 2007 in the United States. According to the CDC, \\"C. difficile has become the most common microbial cause of healthcare-associated infections in U.S. hospitals and costs up to $4.8 billion each year in excess health care costs for acute care facilities alone.\\"  History  Ivan C. Hall and Elizabeth O'Toole first named the bacterium Bacillus difficilis in 1935, choosing its specific epithet because it was resistant to early attempts at isolation and grew very slowly in culture. Andr√© Romain Pr√©vot subsequently transferred it to the genus Clostridium, which made its binomen Clostridium difficile. Its combination was later changed to Clostridiodes difficile after being transferred to the new genus Clostridioides. Pseudomembranous colitis first was described as a complication of C. difficile infection in 1978, when a toxin was isolated from people suffering from pseudomembranous colitis and Koch's postulates were met.  Notable outbreaks  * On 4 June 2003, two outbreaks of a highly virulent strain of this bacterium were reported in Montreal, Quebec, and Calgary, Alberta. Sources put the death count to as low as 36 and as high as 89, with around 1,400 cases in 2003 and within the first few months of 2004. CDIs continued to be a problem in the Quebec healthcare system in late 2004. As of March 2005, it had spread into the Toronto area, hospitalizing 10 people. One died while the others were being discharged. * A similar outbreak took place at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the United Kingdom between 2003 and 2005. The local epidemiology of C. difficile may offer clues on how its spread may relate to the time a patient spends in hospital and/or a rehabilitation center. It also samples the ability of institutions to detect increased rates, and their capacity to respond with more aggressive hand- washing campaigns, quarantine methods, and the availability of yogurt containing live cultures to patients at risk for infection. * Both the Canadian and English outbreaks possibly were related to the seemingly more virulent strain NAP1/027 of the bacterium. Known as Quebec strain, it has been implicated in an epidemic at two Dutch hospitals (Harderwijk and Amersfoort, both 2005). A theory for explaining the increased virulence of 027 is that it is a hyperproducer of both toxins A and B and that certain antibiotics may stimulate the bacteria to hyperproduce. * On 1 October 2006, C. difficile was said to have killed at least 49 people at hospitals in Leicester, England, over eight months, according to a National Health Service investigation. Another 29 similar cases were investigated by coroners. A UK Department of Health memo leaked shortly afterward revealed significant concern in government about the bacterium, described as being \\"endemic throughout the health service\\" * On 27 October 2006, nine deaths were attributed to the bacterium in Quebec. * On 18 November 2006, the bacterium was reported to have been responsible for 12 deaths in Quebec. This 12th reported death was only two days after the St. Hyacinthe's Honor√© Mercier announced the outbreak was under control. Thirty-one people were diagnosed with CDIs. Cleaning crews took measures in an attempt to clear the outbreak. * C. difficile was mentioned on 6,480 death certificates in 2006 in UK.Hospitals struck by new killer bug An article by Manchester free newspaper 'Metro', 7 May 2008 * On 27 February 2007, a new outbreak was identified at Trillium Health Centre in Mississauga, Ontario, where 14 people were diagnosed with CDIs. The bacteria were of the same strain as the one in Quebec. Officials have not been able to determine whether C. difficile was responsible for the deaths of four people over the prior two months.\\"C. difficile outbreak linked to fatal strain\\" . CTV News. 28 February 2007. * Between February and June 2007, three people at Loughlinstown Hospital in Dublin, Ireland, were found by the coroner to have died as a result of C. difficile infection. In an inquest, the Coroner's Court found the hospital had no designated infection control team or consultant microbiologist on staff. * Between June 2007 and August 2008, Northern Health and Social Care Trust Northern Ireland, Antrim Area, Braid Valley, Mid Ulster Hospitals were the subject of inquiry. During the inquiry, expert reviewers concluded that C. difficile was implicated in 31 of these deaths, as the underlying cause in 15, and as a contributory cause in 16. During that time, the review also noted 375 instances of CDIs in those being treated at the hospital.\\"Welcome to the Public Inquiry into the Outbreak of Clostridium difficile in Northern Trust Hospitals\\" * In October 2007, Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust was heavily criticized by the Healthcare Commission regarding its handling of a major outbreak of C. difficile in its hospitals in Kent from April 2004 to September 2006. In its report, the Commission estimated approximately 90 people \\"definitely or probably\\" died as a result of the infection. * In November 2007, the 027 strain spread into several hospitals in southern Finland, with 10 deaths out of 115 infected people reported on 2007-12-14.√Ñrh√§kk√§ suolistobakteeri on tappanut jo kymmenen potilasta ‚Äì HS.fi ‚Äì Kotimaa * In November 2009, four deaths at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Ireland have possible links to CDI.

Two years later, the same strain of the bacterium was detected in New Zealand. * On 28 May 2011, an outbreak in Ontario had been reported, with 26 fatalities as of 24 July 2011. * In 2012/2013, a total of 27 people at one hospital in the south of Sweden (Ystad) were infected with 10 deaths. Five died of the strain 017.  Etymology and pronunciation  The genus name is from the Greek kl≈çstƒìr (), \\"spindle\\", and the specific name is from Latin difficile, neuter singular form of difficilis \\"difficult, obstinate\\", chosen in reference to fastidiousness upon culturing. Regarding the pronunciation of the current and former genus assignments, Clostridioides is and Clostridium is . Both genera still have species assigned to them, but this species is now classified in the former. Via the norms of binomial nomenclature, it is understood that the former binomial name of this species is now an alias. Regarding the specific name, is the traditional norm, reflecting how medical English usually pronounces naturalized New Latin words (which in turns largely reflects traditional English pronunciation of Latin), although a restored pronunciation of is also sometimes used (the classical Latin pronunciation is reconstructed as ). The specific name is also commonly pronounced , as though it were French, which from a prescriptive viewpoint is a \\"mispronunciation\\" but from a linguistically descriptive viewpoint cannot be described as erroneous because it is so widely used among health care professionals; it can be described as \\"the non-preferred variant\\" from the viewpoint of sticking most regularly to New Latin in binomial nomenclature, which is also a valid viewpoint, although New Latin specific names contain such a wide array of extra-Latin roots (including surnames and jocular references) that extra-Latin pronunciation is involved anyway (as seen, for example, with Ba humbugi, Spongiforma squarepantsii, and hundreds of others).  Research  *As of 2019, vaccine candidates providing immunity against C. difficile toxin A and C. difficile toxin B have advanced the most in clinical research, but do not prevent bacterial colonization. A vaccine candidate by Pfizer is in a phase 3 clinical trial that is estimated to be completed in September 2020 and a vaccine candidate by GlaxoSmithKline is in a phase 1 clinical trial that is estimated to be completed in June 2021. * CDA-1 and CDB-1 (also known as MDX-066/MDX-1388 and MBL-CDA1/MBL-CDB1) is an investigational, monoclonal antibody combination co-developed by Medarex and Massachusetts Biologic Laboratories (MBL) to target and neutralize C. difficile toxins A and B, for the treatment of CDI. Merck & Co., Inc. gained worldwide rights to develop and commercialize CDA-1 and CDB-1 through an exclusive license agreement signed in April 2009. It is intended as an add-on therapy to one of the existing antibiotics to treat CDI. * Nitazoxanide is a synthetic nitrothiazolyl- salicylamide derivative indicated as an antiprotozoal agent (FDA-approved for the treatment of infectious diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia) and also is currently being studied in C. difficile infections vs. vancomycin. * Rifaximin, is a clinical-stage semisynthetic, rifamycin-based, nonsystemic antibiotic for CDI. It is FDA-approved for the treatment of infectious diarrhea and is being developed by Salix Pharmaceuticals. * Other drugs for the treatment of CDI are under development and include rifalazil, tigecycline, ramoplanin, ridinilazole, and SQ641. * Research has studied whether the appendix has any importance in, C. difficile. The appendix is thought to have a function of housing good gut flora. In a study conducted in 2011, it was shown that when C. difficile bacteria were introduced into the gut, the appendix housed cells that increased the antibody response of the body. The B cells of the appendix migrate, mature, and increase the production of toxin A-specific IgA and IgG antibodies, leading to an increased probability of good gut flora surviving against the C. difficile bacteria. * Taking non-toxic types of C. difficile after an infection has promising results with respect to preventing future infections. * Treatment with bacteriophages directed against specific toxin-producing strains of C difficile are also being tested. *A study in 2017 linked severe disease to trehalose in the diet.

Fforde had received 76 rejections for earlier works before being accepted by a publisher. Critical reception of this novel was generally positive, remarking on its originality. Plot summary In a parallel universe, England and Imperial Russia have fought the Crimean War for more than a century; England still has a parliamentary government, although heavily influenced by the Goliath Corporation (a powerful weapon-producing company with questionable morals); and Wales is a separate, socialist nation. The book's fictional version of Jane Eyre ends with Jane accompanying her cousin, St. John Rivers, to India in order to help him with his missionary work. Society publicly debates literary questions (especially the question of Shakespearean authorship), sometimes inspiring gang wars and murder. Regular law enforcement agencies still exist, alongside new specialized agencies under the single organization SpecOps (Special Operations). The more than 20 branches include SpecOps 12, the Chronoguard, who police all events related to time travel, and SpecOps 27, the Literary Detectives, or \\"LiteraTecs\\", who deal with all literature-related crimes. The Crimean War is a cold conflict with both sides at a stalemate but too stubborn to call for peace. A peace movement in Britain is gaining popularity. Meanwhile, Goliath has been contracted to create a plasma rifle codenamed \\"STONK\\" to overpower the Russians. The weapon should be capable of destroying a tank with a single blast. Goliath promises that STONK will soon be standard issue to the British military. The plot revolves around Thursday Next, a single, thirty-six-year- old woman who is a veteran of the Crimean War and a literary detective who lives in London with her pet dodo Pickwick. She is privately against the continuation of the war, as her brother was killed in action and her then fianc√© Landen Parke-Laine lost a leg in combat. The trauma of the war led to the end of her relationship with Parke-Laine several years prior. As the story begins, Thursday is promoted to assist in the capture of a wanted terrorist, Acheron Hades, her former university professor who has become a mysterious criminal mastermind, Thursday is the only living person who can recognize him, and nearly captures him during a stakeout. But, Hades possesses several superhuman abilities, such as mental manipulation and extreme durability, and uses those powers to withstand her gunfire. He evades capture and kills Thursday's entire team. During the capture attempt she is shot, but a copy of Jane Eyre stops Hades' bullet. A mysterious stranger aids her until the paramedics arrive, leaving behind a handkerchief monogrammed with the letters \\"E.F.R.\\" and a 19th-century style jacket. Next recognizes these items as belonging to Edward Fairfax Rochester, a fictional character from Jane Eyre. During a flashback to her childhood, Thursday remembers a seemingly supernatural event, whereby she was able to physically enter the world of the novel and briefly became acquainted with Rochester. While recovering in hospital, she learns that, after fleeing the scene, Hades was seemingly killed in a car accident. She also meets a time-traveling future version of herself, who warns her that Hades survived the accident, and instructs her to take a LiteraTec job in her home town of Swindon. She takes the job, and while visiting her family there, she discovers that her brilliant Uncle Mycroft and Aunt Polly have created the Prose Portal, a device that allows people to enter works of fiction. At home, she renews an acquaintance with her ex-fianc√© Parke-Laine. She also meets, and is forced to work with, a high-ranking Goliath operative named Jack Schitt, who is similarly investigating Hades. Hades, meanwhile, steals the original manuscript of Charles Dickens's Martin Chuzzlewit. He also kidnaps Mycroft, Polly, and the Prose Portal in order to blackmail the literary world; any changes made to the plot of a novel's original manuscript will change all other copies. To demonstrate his demands are serious, Hades kills Mr Quaverley, a minor character from the original manuscript of Martin Chuzzlewit. When his demands are not met, he stages a theft of the original manuscript of \\"Jane Eyre\\", and kidnaps Jane for another ransom demand. This causes the text of all copies of the Jane Eyre novel to abruptly end at the moment of Jane's kidnapping, roughly halfway through the book. Next and Jack Schitt independently trace Hades to Wales. She rescues Mycroft and the Prose Portal, and returns Jane to the novel. However, she finds Aunt Polly stuck in one of Wordsworth's poems, and learns that Hades has gone into the original text of Jane Eyre carrying the scrap of paper on which Polly is imprisoned. Next pursues Hades. After several weeks in the novel (which pass in the outside world much more quickly, as the book rewrites itself after Jane is returned) and much trouble, she succeeds in killing Hades and recovering the poem with Polly in it. In the process, Thornfield Hall is burned, Rochester's mad wife Bertha falls to her death, and Rochester is grievously injured. Thursday also discovers that the characters in the book must continually relive their lives, with full knowledge of how events turn out, and are unable to alter any of them. Thus, Rochester must repeatedly suffer the devastating loss of Jane when she runs away from him upon discovering his secret marriage. Thursday, who has befriended Rochester, resolves to change the ending of the book to a happy one. She changes events to reunite Jane and Rochester (in other words, she alters the ending to match the actual ending to Jane Eyre). Returning to her own world, Next uses the Prose Portal to release her Aunt Polly, while Jack Schitt reveals that his interest is in the device. Goliath had never been able to perfect STONK as a feasible weapon. Therefore, with their deadline to deliver the weapons to the military, he had resolved to extract working STONKs from the weapon's manual, itself a work of fiction, as the weapons don't work. Thursday reluctantly agrees to let Schitt use the portal for this endeavor, but switches the book connected to the portal to be the text of Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Raven\\". When the portal opens, she pushes Schitt inside, and traps him there, while Mycroft destroys the portal. Using her new celebrity status, Next enters a televised debate between supporters and opponents of the continuation of the Crimean War. Supporters of the war assume that Goliath's plasma rifles will be sufficient to guarantee victory. But in the debate, Next publicly reveals that the plasma rifles do not work. This forces England to rethink its position, which leads to peace negotiations and an end to the war. Next shows up at the church where Parke-Laine is about to be married to another woman, but Rochester's lawyer interrupts the wedding. Next and Parke-Laine are reconciled and marry instead. Next's father, a renegade agent from SpecOps-12, the ChronoGuard, turns up to dispense some fatherly advice to his daughter. The novel ends with Next facing an uncertain future at work: public reaction to the new ending for Jane Eyre is positive, but there are other repercussions, including Goliath's fury. Reception The book was generally acclaimed, with critics calling it \\"playfully irreverent\\", \\"delightfully daft\\", \\"whoppingly imaginative\\", and \\"a work of ... startling originality\\". The \\"genre-busting\\" novel spans numerous types of literature, with critics identifying aspects of fantasy, science fiction, mystery, satire, romance, and thriller. This led one critic to jokingly suggest that Fforde \\"must have jotted a bundle of unrelated ideas on slips of paper\\", and, \\"instead of tossing them in a hat and choosing a few topics as the focus of his story, [he] grabbed the whole hat.\\" Fforde's quirky writing style has led to comparisons with other notable writers, most frequently Douglas Adams, for similar \\"surrealism and satire\\", and Lewis Carroll, for similar \\"nonsense and wordplay\\". Reviewers have compared Fforde to other authors, including Woody Allen, Sara Paretsky, and Connie Willis. One critic wondered if Fforde was more \\"Monty Python crossed with Terry Pratchett, or J.K. Rowling mixed with Douglas Adams.\\" The novel was praised for its fast- paced action, wordplay, and \\"off-centre humour\\". Mary Hamilton of The Guardian described the experience as > \\"the page opens like a trapdoor and you simply fall through. The Eyre Affair > takes that feeling, the moment you lose the sense of yourself and become > engrossed in the story, and creates high adventure and wild drama around the > porous boundaries between fiction and real life.\\" Some reviewers criticised the novel for \\"convoluted\\" plots and \\"dangling details\\", as well as inconsistent dialogue that \\"can veer from wittily wicked to non-sequitur\\", and minor characters who \\"drift in and out of scenes\\".

The position came to be strongly associated with the Scottish crown when Robert the Bruce, who had inherited it from his maternal kin, became King of the Scots in the early 14th century. Since the 15th century the title of Earl of Carrick has automatically been held by the heir apparent to the throne, meaning Prince Charles is the current Earl. Early rulers The ruins of Turnberry Castle on the Carrick coast, former seat of the Earls of Carrick The earldom emerged in 1186, out of the old Lordship of Galloway, which had previously encompassed all of what is now known as Galloway as well as the southern part of Ayrshire. Though the Lords of Galloway recognised the King of Scots as their overlord, their lordship was effectively a separate kingdom, and had its own laws. The first Lord recorded is Fergus, who died in 1161 leaving two sons: Uchtred and Gille Brigte (Gilbert). As was the custom then, the two brothers shared the lordship and the lands between them. In 1174, they joined with King William the Lion in his invasion of Northumberland. However, after King William was taken prisoner by the English, the Galwegians broke into rebellion. Uchtred, who remained loyal to the Scottish king, was savagely murdered by Gille Brigte's son M√°el Coluim, and Gille Brigte took control of the entirety of Galloway. In 1175, King William was restored to liberty, and he marched an army into Galloway to bring justice upon Gille Brigte. However, he seems to have contented himself with exacting a fine, leaving Gille Brigte to go unharmed. In 1176, Gille Brigte obtained an agreement with King Henry II of England, in which he became his vassal; in exchange, he paid the English king the then enormous sum of ¬£919 9s. and gave his son Duncan (Donnchadh) as a hostage. Gille Brigte then spent the next decade carrying out devastating raids on King William's territory, with the protection of the English. Earl Duncan's seal. The caption reads , Latin for \\"seal of Duncan/Donnchadh son of Gilbert/Gille Brigte\\". The symbol in the centre is a griffin; later earls used the device of a chevron Gille Brigte's death in 1185 was the signal for general turmoil amongst the Galwegians. Roland, son of the murdered Uchtred, defeated the supporters of Gille Brigte in 1185, and planted forts across Galloway to secure his authority. This angered King Henry, and he marched a large force to Carlisle in preparation for invasion. However, war was averted at a meeting between Roland, William and Henry, when it was agreed that Roland would rule the main part of Galloway, while Gille Brigte's son Duncan would rule the northern section, known as Carrick. Duncan agreed to these terms, and renounced all claims to the Lordship of Galloway, becoming the first Earl of Carrick. Duncan married Avelina, daughter of Alan, High Steward of Scotland. His son or grandson Niall's eldest daughter Marjorie succeeded him, becoming Countess of Carrick in her own right. She married firstly Adam de Kilconquhar. In 1269, Adam journeyed to the Holy Land under the banners of King Louis IX of France, as part of the Eighth Crusade. He never returned, dying of disease at Acre in 1270. The next year, the widowed Countess happened to meet Robert de Brus hunting in her lands. According to legend, Marjorie imprisoned Robert until he agreed to marry her. They were married at Turnberry Castle, without their families' knowledge or the requisite consent of the King. When news got out, Alexander III seized her castles and estates, but she later atoned for her foolishness with a fine, and Robert was recognised as her husband and Earl of Carrick jure uxoris. They had five sons and five daughters: Robert, Edward, Thomas, Alexander, Nigel, Isabel, Mary, Christina, Matilda and Margaret. Royal earls Arms of the Earl of Carrick as depicted in Balliol roll. Marjorie and Robert were succeeded by their eldest son. When the old House of Dunkeld became extinct, this Robert, known as \\"the Bruce\\", became a principal candidate for the throne as the great-great-great-great grandson of David I. He was crowned at Scone in 1306, causing his Scots titles (Earl of Carrick and Lord of Annandale) to merge into the Crown. The title of Baron Bruce in the Peerage of England, in so far as it existed, \\"would either have been forfeited in 1306, or after the death ... of ... King David II , 22 Feb 1371, would, according to modern doctrine, have fallen into abeyance between [Robert I's] daughters and coheirs, the sisters of the late King.\\"Complete Peerage, 2nd edition, Volume 3, P56 Around 1313, King Robert made his younger brother Edward the Earl of Carrick. Edward had no issue, save a natural son he had by Lady Isabella Strathbogie, daughter of John, Earl of Atholl. The title therefore became extinct on his death at the Battle of Faughart in 1318. After briefly being held by Robert's son David prior to his accession to the throne, the title was granted in 1332 to Alexander, Edward's bastard. However, Alexander was killed the next year at the Battle of Halidon Hill and the title again became extinct. In 1368, King David created his great-nephew John Stewart the Earl of Carrick. David died unexpectedly in 1371. He had no children, meaning he was succeeded by his nephew Robert Stewart, John's father. After Robert's death in 1390, John succeeded him, taking the regnal name Robert III; thus the Earldom of Carrick again merged with the Crown. The title was next held by Robert III's son David, who was also created Duke of Rothesay and Earl of Atholl. David died childless in 1402, and the Earldom was regranted to his brother James; however he was generally known by the higher title Prince or Great Steward of Scotland. James acceded to the throne in 1406, and his titles merged with the Crown. Charles, Earl of Carrick In 1469, the Scottish Parliament passed an Act declaring that the eldest son of the King and heir to the throne would automatically hold the Earldom, along with the Dukedom of Rothesay. After the Union of the Crowns of Scotland and England, the Dukedom and Earldom have been held by the eldest son and heir apparent of the kings and queens of Great Britain. Thus Prince Charles is the current Duke of Rothesay and Earl of Carrick. Stewart earls (1628) In 1628, King Charles I created John Stewart the Earl of Carrick. He had already been made Lord Kincleven in 1607, also in the Peerage of Scotland. Stewart was a younger son of Robert, Earl of Orkney, bastard son of King James V; thus he was Charles's half-great-uncle. This title was deemed not to conflict with the Earldom of Carrick held by the heir to the throne, as it referred not to the province in Ayrshire, but to the lands of Carrick on Eday in Orkney. John married Lady Elizabeth Southwell, daughter of Charles Howard, Earl of Nottingham and widow of Sir Robert Southwell. By her he had one daughter, Margaret. He is also known to have had two natural children: a son, named Henry, and a daughter, whose name is unknown. As he had no legitimate son, his titles became extinct on his death around 1645.

The 3rd Marquess of Drogheda, as caricatured in Vanity Fair, March 1889. Earl of Drogheda is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1661 for The 3rd Viscount Moore. History The Moore family descends from Sir Garrett Moore, a staunch friend of Hugh O'Neill, the Great Earl of Tyrone, whose submission he facilitated, hosting the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603 and ending The Nine Years' War. He represented Dungannon in the Irish House of Commons, and served as President of Munster. In 1616 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Moore, of Mellefont in the County of Louth. He was further honoured in 1621 when he was made Viscount Moore, of Drogheda, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded in 1628 by his son Charles, the second Viscount, who was killed at the Battle of Portlester while fighting for Charles I in the English Civil War. Charles was succeeded by his son Henry, the aforementioned third Viscount, who was raised to an earldom, as Earl of Drogheda, in 1661. The first Earl's younger son Henry, the third Earl (who succeeded his elder brother in 1679), assumed the additional surname of Hamilton upon succeeding to the estates of his brother-in-law, Henry Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Clanbrassil. In a feast of egotism, he built and named Henry Street, Moore Street, Earl Street, Of (or Off) Lane (now Henry Place, and an important escape route for the volunteers fleeing the GPO during the Easter Rising in 1916), and Drogheda Street (part of what is now O'Connell Street). The third Earl was succeeded by his grandson Henry, the fourth Earl. The latter died without surviving children at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, Edward, the fifth Earl, who had previously represented Dunleer in the Irish Parliament. Edward's son and successor, Charles, the sixth Earl, was a distinguished soldier and politician. In 1791 he was created Marquess of Drogheda in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1801 he was also made Baron Moore, of Moore Place in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him to an automatic seat in the British House of Lords. His eldest son Charles, the second Marquess, suffered from mental illness, died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, Henry, the third Marquess, the son of Lord Henry Moore, second son of the first Marquess. The third Marquess notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Kildare between 1874 and 1892. He was childless and on his death in 1892 the marquessate and barony of 1801 became extinct. He was succeeded in the remaining titles by his second cousin once removed, Ponsonby Moore, who became the ninth Earl. He was the great-grandson of the Honourable Ponsonby Moore, younger son of the fifth Earl and brother of the first Marquess. The ninth Earl was elected an Irish Representative Peer in 1899. He was succeeded by his son, Henry, the tenth Earl, who was elected an Irish Representative Peer in 1913. In 1954 Henry was created Baron Moore, of Cobham in the County of Surrey, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him and his descendants to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He was succeeded by his son, Charles, the eleventh Earl, who was a journalist and businessman. As of 2014 the titles are held by the latter's son, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded in 1989. The twelfth Earl is a professional photographer under the name \\"Derry Moore\\". Several other members of the Moore family may also be mentioned. John Moore, great-grandson of Arthur Moore, younger son of the first Viscount, represented Ballynakill in the Irish Parliament. He was the father of 1) John Moore, who represented Ballynakill in the Irish Parliament as well as Newry in the British Parliament, and of 2) Francis Moore, a General in the British Army. The Honourable Robert Moore, younger son of the third Earl, represented Louth and Belfast in the Irish Parliament. Pronunciation The title of the earldom is pronounced \\"Dro-hed-ah\\" in Ireland and \\"Draw-dah\\" in England. Seat The family seat was Moore Abbey, near Monasterevin, County Kildare.kildare.ie Before that, for a time, the family seat was Mellifont Abbey near Drogheda in County Louth.

S≈çseki's title, Wagahai wa Neko de Aru, uses a very high-register phrasing more appropriate to a nobleman, conveying grandiloquence and self-importance. This is somewhat ironic, since the speaker, an anthropomorphized domestic cat, is a regular house cat of a teacher, and not of a high ranking noble as the manner of speech suggests. The book was first published in ten installments in the literary journal Hototogisu. At first, S≈çseki intended only to write the short story that constitutes the first chapter of I Am a Cat. However, Takahama Kyoshi, one of the editors of Hototogisu, persuaded S≈çseki to serialize the work, which evolved stylistically as the installments progressed. Nearly all the chapters can stand alone as discrete works. In the mid-1970s, the prolific screenwriter Toshio Yasumi adapted S≈çseki's novel into a screenplay. Kon Ichikawa directed the film, which premiered in Japanese cinemas in 1975. The novel was also adapted into a film released in 1936, and an anime television special aired in 1982.

Cultural impact I Am a Cat is a frequent assignment to Japanese schoolchildren, such that the plot and style remain well-known long after publication. One effect was that the narrator's manner of speech, which was archaic even at the time of writing, became largely associated with the cat and the book. The narrator's preferred personal pronoun, wagahai, is rarely-to-never used in \\"real life\\" in Japan, but survives in fiction thanks to the book, generally for arrogant and pompous anthropomorphized animals. For example, Bowser, the turtle-king enemy of many Mario series video games, uses wagahai, as does Morgana, a cat character in Persona 5.

Castlecrag is a suburb of historical significance that is bounded to the north, east and south by Middle Harbour and to the west by Eastern Valley Way.http://www.castlecrag.org.au/crag/issue160_WeekendTrafficChaos.html Castlecrag Progress Association: Our Weekend Traffic Chaos Castlecrag shares its postcode, 2068, with the surrounding suburbs of Willoughby, Middle Cove and North Willoughby. Australian White Pages Find a Postcode. History Castlecrag was originally planned by the husband and wife team, Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin who named the suburb after a towering crag of rock overlooking Middle Harbour, known locally as Edinburgh Castle. The Griffins came to Castlecrag in 1925 after tiring of the politics surrounding implementation of their designs for Australia's capital city, Canberra.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia Many early homes in Castlecrag were built using natural stone to blend into the environment, a common practice in architecture of the Arts and Crafts Movement, which was concerned with creating \\"the human touch\\" as distinct from mass production. Other homes of this period were built with bricks using Walter Burley Griffin's patented Knitlock system. Historically, Castlecrag was noted in the early 20th century as an experiment in communal and community planning and living, and for the liberal intellectual, Theosophical, Anthroposophical and Natural history views of its inhabitants. The Haven Amphitheatre is undergoing redevelopment by Willoughby City Council. This project while underway has been subject to countless delays and controversy. It is envisaged that the new Haven Amphitheatre Stage will significantly enhance the ability of the site to operate again as a performance venue. The famous Haven Christmas Carols have not been held in recent years. Many stakeholders are involved in the process for the DA approval and eventual rebuild, such as, The Haven Amphitheatre Committee, Willoughby City Council, The Castlecrag Progress Association, The Walter Burley Griffin Society and Friends of the Haven. Castle Crag Post Office opened on 1 September 1937 and was renamed Castlecrag in 1941. The streets in the southern older, portion of the suburb were named after parts of a castle: The barbette, The Barbican, The Barricade, The Bartizan, The Bastion, The Battlement, The Bulwark, The Citadel, The High Tor, The Outpost, The Palisade, The Parapet, The Postern, The Rampart, The Redoubt, The Scarp, The Tor Walk and Sortie Port. There are also Tower, Casement, and Turrett Reserves, and the main street through the centre is Edinburgh Road. More recently the residents of the suburb have been noted for their opposition to the Warringah Freeway (Warringah Expressway),http://www.castlecrag.org.au/history/History%201960%20to%201978.pdf Castlecrag Process Association: History of Castlecrag 1960 to 1978. which was originally planned to link the Sydney Harbour Bridge with the Northern Beaches, but today terminates just south of Castlecrag in Naremburn. The Griffins' vision In 1921, Walter Burley Griffin (architect and landscape architect) and Marion Mahony Griffin (architect and artist) began designing Castlecrag a model residential suburb that was sympathetic to the Australian natural environment.Leslie, 1988, p.73 Upon arriving in Australia in 1913, Walter Burley Griffin was struck by the natural beauty of the Sydney Harbour, and at the first Australian town planning conference; he emphasised that best planning practice should respect the natural character of the site's landscape.Walker, Kabos & Weirick, 1994, p.8; Chambers, 2006-11 Griffin formed the Greater Sydney Development Association (GSDA) together with several investors (Griffin holding more than 50% of the voting rights). This company purchased and developed Castlecrag with Griffin as managing director/lead planner.McGregor, 2009, p.382 Griffin's design for Castlecrag was based on careful planning, respectful of the particular site, and he was dismayed by the layout of Sydney's suburbs, which he considered to be unimaginative (grid plan) and unsympathetic towards the environment.Chambers, 2006-11 Both Griffin and Mahony Griffin firmly believed that development should not lead to the destruction of natural features.Walter Burley Griffin Society Inc, 2006-11 This concept was original for the time and is considered to have been influenced by the Garden City movement.Johnson, 1971 cited in Freestone, 1982, p.37 Also at the heart of the Griffins' vision for Castlecrag was establishing a sense of community and focusing on its needs.Spathopoulos, 2007, p.58 The pair believed this could be achieved by encouraging social interaction, providing opportunities for people to contribute to their community and planning many parks and recreational spaces. The Griffins lived in Castlecrag from 1925, and actively participated in the community, planting native trees, landscaping and developing a natural amphitheatre.Walker et al., 1994, p.33; McGregor, 2009, pp.391-418 Marion Mahony Griffin had a passionate interest in the arts and helped instigate the creation of the Haven Scenic Amphitheatre where plays and festivals were held.The Castlecrag Progress Association, 2011 Community spirit was also fostered through the establishment of groups such as music groups and the Neighbourhood Circle, and through the willingness of residents to help one another in the building of houses.Walker et al., 1994, p.33-35 Planning considerations The roads of Castlecrag were planned to suit the topography of the area; following the natural contours of the land.Spathopoulos, 2007, p.54 This contrasted with the grid plan, which was characteristic of many suburbs in Sydney at the time; reflecting the Griffins' belief that the built environment should respect the natural environment. The trees that bordered the roads in Castlecrag were not removed and the roads were barely visible from above.Leslie, 1988, p.84 Furthermore, the layout of the streets also provided residents with views of the landscape. The architects designed reserves that were linked together by a network of walkways, providing the community with ample space for recreation and bushwalking whilst retaining the bushland backdrop.Leslie, 1988, p.94 The roads, paths and reserves were diligently planned for the convenience and pleasure of the residents and to retain views. The Griffin's plan involved 20% of the land at Castlecrag being set aside for parkland - considerably more than the amount dictated by Council regulations, 2%. Before the development of Castlecrag, the peninsula was being stripped of vegetation for firewood, soil and other needs.Walker et al., 1994, p.32 The Griffins promoted respect for the natural environment by planting and protecting native trees in both public reserves and gardens and by establishing covenants on the land.Willoughby City Council, 2011 The covenants placed restrictions on land uses and construction, which enabled the character of the area to be protected.Leslie, 1988 The covenants prevented the creation of buildings that were out of place, impeded views or were too dominant.Leslie, 1988; Willoughby City Council, 2011 The covenants also required residents to pay a levy that supported the ongoing maintenance of reserves, tree planting and other activities designed to safeguard the natural environment.Leslie, 1988, p.74 Today, the national, state and local governments as well as heritage organisations acknowledge the importance of protecting the built and natural environment at Castlecrag and have established controls over its management and development. Architecture During Castlecrag's early years, houses were either designed by Griffin and Mahony Griffin (fifteen were built) or approved by them.O‚ÄôDonoghue, 2006-11 The houses were characterised by concrete block and stone found at the site, material which matched the natural surroundings (three houses were built using knitlock only).Leslie, 1988; Walker et al., 1994 The use of these materials facilitated the quick and affordable construction of the houses.Walker et al., 1994, p.22 The Griffins' designs boasted innovations such as the kitchens' pass-through pantries and twin sinks, the close-to ground floor levels and the picture window.Walker et al., 1994 Some aspects of the Griffins' houses in Castlecrag were unusual and unconventional such as the treatment of stonework, the window details and the flat roofs.Walker et al. 1994, p.37 Flat roofs were favoured over pitched roofs as they prevented the obstruction of views, provided vantage points where one could experience a view of the landscape and allowed for a rooftop garden.Leslie, 1988, p.76; Willoughby City Council, 2011 Another atypical feature of the Griffin/Mahony Griffin houses was the unusual location of the kitchens and bathrooms.Walter et al., 1994, p.37 These rooms were situated at the front of the house even though convention was to have these rooms at the back of the house. The houses were designed in such a way so that the living rooms located at the rear; faced a view or park on the inner side of the allotment. Their houses did not have front fences and built structures were minimal within ten metres of each property. This, in addition to many of the houses being single story and boasting colours of the natural surroundings exemplifies the Griffins' objective which did not involve establishing imposing and artificial built structures, but rather to have the buildings blend in with the environment; retaining the bush setting.Willoughby, 2011 Thus, the Griffins' designs were remarkably different from the uniform designs at the time - houses with red, pitched roofs - which Griffin detested.Leslie, 1988, p.75 There has since been development in Castlecrag that has not respected the Griffin ideals. However, the Willoughby City Council is aware of the importance of Castlecrag and has imposed controls over development in the area. The purpose of the controls is to preserve the character of Castlecrag, encouraging the construction of buildings, which respect the original houses designed by Griffin and Mahony Griffin, and the natural landscape.

The first creation in the Scots Peerage came in 1580 in favour of Esme Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox, who was created Duke of Lennox at the same time. The title of Lord Darnley had previously been held by John Stewart, head of the house of Stewart of Darnley and first Earl of Lennox (1488). The second creation in the Peerage of Scotland came in 1675 in favour of Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond. He was made Duke of Lennox at the same time. For more information on this creation, see the Duke of Richmond. The only creation in the Peerage of Ireland was in 1725 to John Bligh, 1st Earl of Darnley, descended from a prominent Devon family via a cadet branch which had settled in County Meath, Ireland; he was the son of the Rt Hon Thomas Bligh who was in turn the son of John Bligh, of Plymouth, a Commissioner of Customs and Excise despatched to Ireland in search of forfeited estates, and in turn his father was William Bligh, a prosperous Plymouth merchant. John Bligh, 1st Earl of Darnley, married Theodosia Hyde, 10th Baroness Clifton (of Leighton Bromswold), great- granddaughter of Lord George Stuart, younger son of Esm√© Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox, also 3rd Earl of Darnley (see the Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold and the Duke of Lennox for earlier history of these titles). He represented Athboy in the Irish House of Commons from 1709 to 1721. In 1721 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Clifton of Rathmore, in the County of Meath. In 1723 the Darnley title held by his wife's ancestors (which had become extinct on the death of Charles Stewart, 6th Duke of Lennox and 6th Earl of Darnley in 1672) was revived when he was created Viscount Darnley, of Athboy in the County of Meath, in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1725 Bligh was further honoured when he was advanced as Earl of Darnley, in the County of Meath, also in the Peerage of Ireland. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He had already succeeded his mother in 1722 as eleventh Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold in the Peerage of England. Lord Darnley served as a Lord of the Bedchamber to Frederick, Prince of Wales, but died unmarried in 1747, aged 31. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. He had earlier represented Athboy in the Irish House of Commons and Maidstone in the British House of Commons. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son, the fourth Earl. In 1828 he presented a claim as heir-general to the dukedom of Lennox, challenged by the Countess Nugent , but the House of Lords did not come to any decision on the matter. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Earl. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Canterbury and served as Lord Lieutenant of County Meath. On the death of his grandson, the seventh Earl (who had succeeded his father in 1896), the barony of Clifford of Leighton Bromswold separated from the Irish titles when it devolved upon the late Earl's daughter and only child, the ten-month-old Lady Elizabeth Bligh, who became the seventeenth holder of the barony by writ of summons. Lord Darnley was succeeded in the Irish titles by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. A talented and successful cricketer who captained MCC, he sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1905 to 1927. On his death the titles passed to his only son, the ninth Earl. In 1937 he succeeded his first cousin The Lady Clifton (who died unmarried) in her ancient English barony by writ of summons being her heir-general, as eighteenth Baron Clifton of Leighton Bromswold. He was by his only son from his third marriage with Rosemary, Dowager Countess of Darnley (n√©e Potter, died 2005),www.theguardian.com the eleventh Earl, who succeeded his half- brother (the only son from the first marriage of the ninth Earl), in 1980. As of 2017 the title is held by his only son, the twelfth earl, who succeeded his father in that year. Several other members of the Bligh family have also attained distinction. Thomas Bligh (1654‚Äì1710), father of the first Earl, represented County Meath as its MP in the Irish Parliament and was sworn of the Irish Privy Council. Thomas Bligh, younger brother of the first Earl, was a general in the British Army and represented Athboy in the Irish House of Commons for sixty years. The Very Reverend Robert Bligh (c. 1704‚Äì1778), another younger brother of the first Earl, was an Anglican clergyman who became Dean of Elphin.www.historyofparliamentonline.org General the Hon. Edward Bligh (1769‚Äì1840), second son of the third Earl, was a general in the British Army. The Hon. William Bligh (1775‚Äì1845), third son of the third Earl, was a colonel in the Army. The Hon.

The term is also used to refer to the external application, a computer program that runs outside of the main bulletin board program. Sometimes called external programs, doors are the most common way to add games, utilities, and other extensions to BBSes. Because BBSes typically depended on the telephone system, BBSes and door programs tended to be local in nature, unlike modern Internet games and applications. From the 1990s on, most BBS software had the capability to \\"drop to\\" doors. Several standards were developed for passing connection and user information to doors; this was usually done with \\"dropfiles\\", small binary or text files dropped into known locations in the BBS's file system. Most doors were responsible for operating the serial port or other communications device directly until returning control to the BBS. Later development of FOSSIL drivers have allowed both BBSes and their doors to communicate without being responsible for direct operation of the communications hardware. Door games A major use of doors is for door games: computer games played on the BBS. These games included strategy games such as TradeWars 2002, Food Fight!, Solar Realms Elite, Space Dynasty, Usurper, and Barren Realms Elite. There were also role-playing games (RPG), often derived from earlier email-based games. One such game was Seth Robinson's Legend of the Red Dragon, and another popular dystopian RPG: Operation: Overkill, another was Mutants!. BBSes often published high scores, encouraging players to beat others. InterBBS leagues allowed users of different BBSes to compete against each other in the same game. A modern version of this known as BBSlink exists allowing sysops to offer door games on their BBS which are hosted on a remote server, thereby increasing the user base of the game. Other door applications While many of the most popular and memorable BBS doors have been games, numerous doors had non-entertainment applications such as user polls or the time bank, permitting users to time-shift their rationed BBS use. Frequently they act as a front-end to themed databases on subject such as astrology, numerology and fortune-telling, recipes, weather prediction, personal ads (sometimes with additional match-making functionality), classified ads and \\"for sale\\" listings (sometimes permitting auctions), BBS lists, and parting comments from the most recent BBS callers.

It is associated with the Hely-Hutchinson family. Paternally of Gaelic Irish descent with the original name of √ì h√âalaighthe, their ancestors had long lived in the County Cork area as allies of the Mac C√°rthaigh clan; they lost out during the times of Oliver Cromwell. One branch of the family converted to the Anglican Church and after inheriting territories through his mother and adding \\"Hutchinson\\" to Hely, became the Earl of Donoughmore. History The title Earl of Donoughmore was created in 1800 for Richard Hely-Hutchinson, 1st Viscount Donoughmore, with remainder to the heirs male of his mother. He was a General in the British Army and sat in the House of Lords as one of the 28 original Irish Representative Peers from 1800 to 1825. Hely-Hutchinson had already been created Viscount Donoughmore, of Knocklofty in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1797, and was made Viscount Hutchinson, of Knocklofty in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, in 1821. These titles were also created with remainder to the heirs male of his mother. Lord Donoughmore was the eldest son of the Irish statesman and lawyer John Hely- Hutchinson, who married Christiana, daughter of Abraham Nixon (or Nickson) and niece and heiress of Richard Hutchinson of Knocklofty in County Tipperary, whose surname she and her husband adopted. In 1783 Christiana was raised to the Peerage of Ireland in honour of her husband as Baroness Donoughmore, of Knocklofty in the County of Tipperary. John Hely-Hutchinson (1724‚Äì1794) by Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723‚Äì1792) The first Earl was succeeded according to the special remainder (and normally in the barony of Donoughmore) by his younger brother, the second Earl. He was also a General in the British Army. In 1801 he was created Baron Hutchinson, of Alexandria and Knocklofty in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. Lord Donoughmore also served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Tipperary from 1831 to 1832. On his death in 1832 the barony of 1801 became extinct while he was succeeded in the other titles by his nephew, the third Earl. He was the son of the Honourable Francis Hely-Hutchinson, third son of the first Baroness Donoughmore and John Hely-Hutchinson. He briefly represented Tipperary in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Tipperary. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served in the Earl of Derby's second administration as Paymaster-General and President of the Board of Trade. His grandson, the fifth Earl, was also a Conservative politician and held office as Under-Secretary of State for War from 1903 to 1904 under Arthur Balfour. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Earl, a noted Irish Freemason. His son, the seventh Earl, sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Peterborough from 1943 to 1945. the titles are held by the latter's eldest son, the eighth Earl, who succeeded in 1981. Another member of the Hely-Hutchinson family was the Honourable Christopher Hely-Hutchinson (1767‚Äì1826), fifth son of Baroness Donoughmore and John Hely-Hutchison. He represented Cork City in the House of Commons. The Honourable Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, younger son of the fourth Earl, was the last Governor of the Cape Colony. The Honourable Tim Hely Hutchinson, second son of the eighth Earl, is a publisher. The family seat now is The Manor House, near Bampton, Oxfordshire. The former family seat was Knocklofty House, near Clonmel, County Tipperary, in Ireland, which is now a hotel. The Knocklofty Estate was sold by the family in the 1970s. The heir apparent to the earldom uses the invented courtesy title Viscount Suirdale (pronounced \\"Shure-dale\\"). This derives from the fact that the territorial designation of the Irish viscountcy of Donoughmore was erroneously thought to be \\"of Suirdale\\".www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk Extract from Valentine Heywood's British Titles ‚Äì The Use and Misuse of the Titles of Peers and Commoners, with Some Historical Notes, \\"The Suirdale 'Viscountcy'\\".

It was created on 5 February 1822 for Valentine Quin, 1st Viscount Mount-Earl. Quin had already been created a Baronet, of Adare in County Limerick, in the Baronetage of Ireland, in 1781, Baron Adare, of Adare in the County of Limerick, on 31 July 1800, and Viscount Mount-Earl on 3 February 1816. He was made Viscount Adare in 1822 at the same time as he was given the earldom. The latter peerage titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. The Quins were unusual among Irish landowning families in that era in being of Gaelic origin, although they married into Anglo-Irish families like the Widenhams of Kildimo and the Dawsons of Dublin. His son, the second Earl, represented County Limerick in the House of Commons from 1806 to 1820 and also sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1839 until his death in 1850. In 1815 the second Earl had assumed by Royal licence his wife's maiden surname of Wyndham in addition to that of Quin. His eldest son, the third Earl, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Glamorganshire from 1836 to 1850 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of County Limerick from 1864 to 1871. In 1866, Dunraven was given the additional title of Baron Kenry, of Kenry in County Limerick, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl, who served in the Conservative government of Lord Salisbury as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1885 to 1886. A member of the Irish Unionist Party, he was also Lord Lieutenant of County Limerick from 1894 to 1926. When the Chief Secretary for Ireland, George Wyndham, called a Land Conference in 1902, Lord Dunraven was chairman representing the landlord side and together with William O'Brien played a decisive role in attaining agreement on the enactment of the Wyndham Land Purchase Act (1903) which enabled tenants to purchase lands from their landlords under favourable financial provisions. He was a Senator of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1926. He had no male heirs and on his death the barony of Kenry became extinct. The Fourth Earl published his memoir Past Times and Pastimes in 1922 (Hodder and Stoughton). He was succeeded in the other titles by his cousin, the fifth Earl. He had previously represented South Glamorganshire in Parliament as a Conservative from 1895 to 1906. The titles became extinct when the seventh Earl died on 25 March 2011 at his residence, Kilgobbin House. The family seat until seventh Earl's death was Kilgobbin House, in Adare, Ireland. The former seat was the palatial Adare Manor in County Limerick. Adare Manor was sold by the Dunraven family in 1982 and is now a luxury hotel. The south Wales home of the Dunraven family, Dunraven House at Dunraven Bay, near Bridgend, no longer exists apart from the walled gardens and some floors and steps. Dunraven Castle, as it was often called, was demolished in 1963 after having been used as a guest house for some years. In the First and Second World Wars the house served as a military hospital. The Earl of Dunraven arrived at what would become Estes Park, Colorado in late December 1872, visited repeatedly, and decided to take over the valley for his own private hunting preserve. His land grab did not work, but he controlled 6,000 acres before he changed tactics and opened the area's first resort, the Estes Park Hotel, which was destroyed by fire in 1911.

The Georgian quadrangle, which was built on the site of a Tudor palace belonging to the Duke of Somerset, was designed by Sir William Chambers in 1776. It was further extended with Victorian outer wings to the east and west in 1831 and 1856 respectively.Humphreys (2003), pp. 165‚Äì166 Somerset House stood directly on the River Thames until the Victoria Embankment was built in the late 1860s. The Georgian structure was built to be a grand public building housing various government, and public-benefit society offices. Its present tenants are a mixture of various organizations, generally centered around the arts and education. Old Somerset House=16th century In the 16th century, the Strand, the north bank of the Thames between the City of London and the Palace of Westminster, was a favoured site for the mansions of bishops and aristocrats, who could commute from their own landing stages upriver to the court or downriver to the City and beyond.Thurley et al. (2009), p. 9. In 1539, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford (died 1552), obtained a grant of land at \\"Chester Place, outside Temple Bar, London\\" from his brother-in-law King Henry VIII. When his nephew the young King Edward VI came to the throne in 1547, Seymour became Duke of Somerset and Lord Protector. In about 1549 he pulled down an old Inn of Chancery and other houses that stood on the site, and began to build himself a palatial residence, making liberal use of other nearby buildings, including some of the chantry chapels and cloisters at St Paul's Cathedral, which were demolished partly at his behest as part of the ongoing dissolution of the monasteries. It was a two-storey house built around a quadrangle, with a gateway rising to three storeys, and was one of the earliest examples of Renaissance architecture in England. It is not known who designed the building.Thurley et al (2009), p. 11. Before it was finished, however, the Duke of Somerset was overthrown, attainted by Parliament and in 1552 was executed on Tower Hill. Somerset Place, as the building was referred to, then came into the possession of the Crown. The duke's royal nephew's half-sister, the future Queen Elizabeth I, lived there during the reign of her half-sister Queen Mary I (1553‚Äì58). The process of completion and improvement was slow and costly. As late as 1598 John Stow refers to it as \\"yet unfinished\\". 17th century Old Somerset House, in a drawing by Jan Kip published in 1722, was a sprawling and irregular complex with wings from different periods in a mixture of styles. The buildings behind all four square gardens belong to Somerset House. The Thames from the Terrace of Somerset House Looking Towards St. Paul's, by Canaletto On the 18 August O.S. (28 August N.S.) 1604, Somerset House was the probably location for the negotiations, known as the Somerset House Conference that culminated in the Treaty of London and concluded the nineteen-year Anglo-Spanish War. The terms were better received in Spain than in England, as they were seen there to let down the Netherlands, a well- regarded ally. The Conference was the subject of an oil-on-canvas painting depicting the 11 representatives of the governments of England, Spain and the Spanish Netherlands, seated around a conference table, probably in Old Somerset House. One version, thought to be the original, is held by the National Portrait Gallery, London, and a copy at the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. Later in the 17th century, the house was used as a residence by royal consorts. During the reign of King James I, the building became the London residence of his wife, Anne of Denmark, and was renamed Denmark House.Thurley et al (2009), p. 13. She commissioned a number of expensive additions and improvements, some to designs by Inigo Jones.Thurley et al (2009), p. 16. After his death in April 1625 King James' body was brought from Theobalds to lie in state at Denmark House, and the state rooms were hung with black velvet. There was at that time no chapel at Denmark House, and so the hall was converted to that purpose, and the body moved there on the morning of the funeral.John Nichols, Progresses of James the First, vol. 4 (London, 1828), pp. 1038-40. Between 1630 and 1635 Inigo Jones built a chapel where Henrietta Maria of France, wife of King Charles I, could exercise her Roman Catholic religion. This was in the care of the Capuchin Order and was on a site to the southwest of the Great Court. A small cemetery was attached and some of the tombstones are still to be seen built into one of the walls of a passage under the present quadrangle. Royal occupation of Somerset House was interrupted by the Civil War, and in 1649 Parliament tried to sell it. They failed to find a buyer, although a sale of the contents realised the very considerable sum (for that time) of ¬£118,000. Use was still found for it however. Part of it served as an army headquarters, with General Fairfax (the Parliamentarians' commander-in-chief) being given official quarters there;Thurley et al (2009), p. 31. lodgings were also provided for certain other Parliamentarian notables. It was in Somerset House that Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell's body lay in state after his death in 1658.Thurley et al (2009), p. 25. Two years later, with the Restoration, Queen Henrietta Maria returned and in 1661 began a considerable programme of rebuilding, the main feature of which was a magnificent new river front, again to the design of the late Inigo Jones, who had died at Somerset House in 1652.Thurley et al (2009), p. 48. However she returned to France in 1665 before it was finished. It was then used as an occasional residence by Catherine of Braganza, wife of King Charles II.Thurley et al (2009), p. 63. During her time it received a certain notoriety as being, in the popular mind, a hot-bed of Catholic conspiracy. Titus Oates made full use of this prejudice in the fabricated details of the Popish Plot and it was alleged that Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, whose murder was one of the great mysteries of the age, had been killed in Somerset House before his body had been smuggled out and thrown into a ditch below Primrose Hill. Somerset House was refurbished by Sir Christopher Wren in 1685. After the Glorious Revolution in 1688, Somerset House entered on a long period of decline, being used (after Queen Catherine left England in 1692) for grace and favour residences. In the conditions of the time this meant almost inevitably that little money could be found for its upkeep, and a slow process of decay crept in. During the 18th century, however, the building ceased its royal associations. Though the view from its terraced riverfront garden, open to the public, was painted twice on his London visit by Canaletto (looking up- and downriver), it was used for storage, as a residence for visiting overseas dignitaries and as a barracks for troops. Suffering from neglect, Old Somerset House began to be demolished in 1775. Somerset House (Sir William Chambers, 1776) The south wing of Chambers' Somerset House Since the middle of the 18th century there had been growing criticism that London had no great public buildings. Government departments and the learned societies were huddled away in small old buildings all over the city. Developing national pride found comparison with the capitals of continental Europe disquieting. Edmund Burke was the leading proponent of the scheme for a \\"national building\\", and in 1775 Parliament passed an act for the purpose of, inter alia, \\"erecting and establishing Offices in Somerset House, and for embanking Parts of the River Thames lying within the bounds of the Manor of Savoy\\". The list of public offices mentioned in the act comprised \\"The Salt Office, The Stamp Office, The Tax Office, The Navy Office, The Navy Victualling Office, The Publick Lottery Office, The Hawkers and Pedlar Office, The Hackney Coach Office, The Surveyor General of the Crown Lands Office, The Auditors of the Imprest Office, The Pipe Office, The Office of the Duchy of Lancaster, The Office of the Duchy of Cornwall, The Office of Ordnance, The King's Bargemaster's House, The King's Bargehouses\\".Crown Lands Act 1775 Somerset House was still technically a royal palace and therefore Crown property. By an earlier Act of Parliament, it had been placed in trust for the use of Queen Charlotte in the event that her husband King George III predeceased her. Therefore, the 1775 act annulled this arrangement and instead provided for another property, Buckingham House, to be vested in trust for the Queen on the same terms. (Provision was made for the King, who had privately purchased Buckingham House some years earlier, to be duly compensated). In due course, the King outlived the Queen and the property (later known as Buckingham Palace) reverted \\"to the use of His Majesty, his heirs and successors\\".15 Geo.III c.33: An Act for settling Buckingham House, with the Appurtenances, upon the Queen, in case she should survive His Majesty, in lieu of His Majesty's Palace of Somerset House. By virtue of the same act, Ely House in Holborn (which had itself been purchased just a few years earlier as a potential site for new public offices) was sold and the proceeds applied to the Somerset House project. Initially a certain William Robinson, Secretary to the Board of Works, was commissioned to design and build the new Somerset House, but he died in 1775 shortly after being appointed. So Sir William Chambers, Comptroller of the King's Works, (who had in any case been vying for the commission) was appointed in his stead, at a salary of ¬£2,000 per year. He spent the last two decades of his life, beginning in 1775, in several phases of building at the present Somerset House. Thomas Telford, then a stonemason, but later an eminent civil engineer, was among those who worked on its construction. One of Chambers's most famous pupils, Thomas Hardwick Jnr, helped build parts of the building during his period of training and later wrote a short biography of Chambers. The design influenced other great buildings: Charles Bulfinch's Massachusetts State House, begun in 1795, has been described as a work \\"frankly derivative\\" of Somerset House.Shand-Tucci, Douglass. Built in Boston: City and Suburb, 1800-2000, p. 6. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1999. . Design Chambers' own influences stemmed from Palladianism, the principles of which were applied throughout Somerset House, inside and outside, both in its large-scale conception and in its small-scale details. The footprint of the building was that of the old palace, ranging from its gateway block in the Strand across what was originally a gently sloping site down to the river. Chambers experimented with at least four different configurations of buildings and courtyards in drawing up his designs; his final version provided a single courtyard, by , flanked by a pair of terraces, the whole presenting a unified frontage to the river, wide. Around the courtyard, each block consisted of six storeys: cellar, basement, ground, principal, attic and garret. The public offices and learned societies which were accommodated around the courtyard varied greatly in size, but each occupied all six floors of its allotted area, the upper floors often providing living space for a secretary or other official. Large vaults for storing public documents were provided, extending under the entire northern section of the courtyard. =Construction= Night view from beneath the Strand entrance The North Wing, fronting the Strand, was the first part of the complex to be built; its design was based on Inigo Jones's drawings for the riverfront of the former palace. By 1780 the North Wing was finished and occupied, and Chambers reported to Parliament that the rest of the quadrangle was complete up to a height of two storeys. Construction of the riverside wing followed; it was finished in 1786. At the time of construction, the Thames was not embanked and the river lapped the South Wing, where a great arch allowed boats and barges to penetrate to landing places within the building.Thurley et al (2009), p. 68. Meanwhile, work continued on the East and West Wings, which began to be occupied from 1788; by 1790 the main quadrangle was complete. It was originally envisaged that the main quadrangle would be flanked by two terraces of houses, one to the east and one to the west, providing accommodation for several of the Commissioners whose offices were based there. It is not certain at what pace the rest of the construction progressed, but it is clear that the outbreak of war with France in 1793 caused delays through lack of money. Chambers died in 1796, whereupon James Wyatt took over as architect. In the end, only the western terrace was built and by 1801 the building was deemed to be complete, at a cost of ¬£462,323. In 1815 Sir Robert Smirke was appointed as Attached Architect to Somerset House; in 1817 he added the Legacy Duty Office to the north-west corner of the quadrangle, its design in keeping with Chambers's adjacent fa√ßade. Even as late as 1819, decorative work to the exterior of the North Wing was still being completed. =Ornamentation= In addition to applying a rich scheme of architectural decoration, Chambers enhanced the exterior of Somerset House with a multiplicity of sculptures and other visual embellishments. Designs were produced by Giovanni Cipriani and the sculptors included Joseph Wilton, Agostino Carlini, John Bacon, Joseph Nollekens, John Cheere and Giuseppe Ceracchi. Bacon oversaw production of the bronze group of statues (consisting of Neptune and George III) in the main courtyard, facing the main entrance from the Strand. Inside, most of the offices were plain and business-like, but in the North Wing the formal rooms and public spaces of the learned societies were enriched with painted ceilings (by Cipriani, Benjamin West, Angelica Kauffman, J. F. Rigaud, Charles Catton and Joshua Reynolds), ornamental plasterwork (by Thomas Collins and Thomas Clerk) and casts of classical sculptures. John Papworth did the plasterwork in the great Royal Academy Room; many of the ceiling paintings were removed by the Royal Academy when they vacated their premises. Accommodation A key reason for rebuilding Somerset House was to provide accommodation for a diverse variety of learned societies, public offices and naval administrators. =A home for arts and learning= The Exhibition Room at Somerset House by Thomas Rowlandson and Augustus Charles Pugin (1800). This room is now part of the Courtauld Gallery. The North Wing of Somerset House was initially fitted out to house the Royal Academy, the Royal Society and the Society of Antiquaries. The Royal Academy took up residence first, in 1779, followed by the other two institutions the following year. The Royal Academy occupied the western half of the wing and the Royal Society the eastern half; their main entrances faced each other across the central vestibule leading from the Strand to the courtyard, topped by busts (of Michelangelo and Isaac Newton respectively) which are still in place today. The Society of Antiquaries was also accommodated in the eastern half of the wing, though its premises were limited to a first-floor meeting room, a ground-floor library, an apartment in the attic and a kitchen in the basement. The Geological Society was also accommodated in the Somerset House from 1828, as was the Royal Astronomical Society from 1834. The annual Royal Academy Exhibition was held in Somerset House from 1780 onwards,Thurley et al (2009), p. 75. until the Academy moved out in 1837 (initially to rooms in the new National Gallery, then to Burlington House, Piccadilly). Its former accommodation was given over to a newly established Government School of Design (which was much later to become the Royal College of Art); it remained in the complex from 1837 until, in 1853, the Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths needed to expand its office space and the School relocated to Marlborough House. In 1857, the Royal Society moved out of Somerset House, followed in 1874 by the Society of Antiquaries, the Geological Society and the Royal Astronomical Society; they were all provided with new purpose-built accommodation in Burlington House. =The Navy Office= The Navy Stair (later renamed the 'Nelson Stair') which leads to the old Navy Boardroom. In 1789 the Navy Board moved into grand riverside rooms in the western half of the newly completed South Wing. It was soon followed by its subsidiary Boards, the Victualling Commissioners and the Sick and Hurt Commissioners, which (along with the autonomous Navy Pay Office) occupied the West Wing; they had all hitherto been based in the City of London. Thus the various Navy offices occupied around a third of Chambers' completed building. In addition, the terrace to the west of the quadrangle provided dwelling-houses for the Comptroller of the Navy, the Secretary to the Board and three Commissioners of the Navy, along with the Chairman, Secretary and two Commissioners of Victualling, with the Treasurer of the Navy allotted the 'mansion' at the river end of the terrace (which included a coach house and stables for ten horses in the vaults under the terrace). As well as providing office space and accommodation, Somerset House was the place where examinations for promotion to the rank of lieutenant took place, sat by several hundred midshipmen each year. The Admiralty Museum (a precursor to the National Maritime Museum) was also accommodated there, in the central room above the south portico. In 1832 the Navy Board and its subsidiaries were abolished and their departments placed under the direct oversight of the Admiralty. Their administrative staff remained in Somerset House, but communications with the Admiralty (based a mile away in Whitehall) were problematic as what became known as the \\"civil departments\\" of the Admiralty guarded their independence. In 1868, the Admiralty took the decision to move all their staff from Somerset House to Whitehall; this necessitated reconfiguring what had been a set of residences there pertaining to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty into office accommodation. Nevertheless, the move was completed by 1873, and the expanding Inland Revenue immediately took over the vacated space in Somerset House. =Taxes, Stamps and the Inland Revenue= The Stamp Office, Somerset House: the basement stamping room. From the beginning of the new Somerset House there was a fiscal presence in the shape of the Stamp Office and the Tax Office, the former occupying the eastern part of the South Wing from 1789 and the latter occupying part of the East Wing. The Stamp Office had the task of applying an impressed duty stamp to various specific items to show that the required duty had been paid. For example, up until 1855 (when the relevant duty was abolished) every newspaper produced in the country had to be brought to Somerset House to be stamped.Information panel The Tax Office administered and collected various taxes, including income tax (first levied in 1799). Introduced as a means of raising revenue in wartime, it was collected during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars; though repealed in 1816, it was reintroduced in peacetime (in 1842) and has been collected ever since. The Inland Revenue was created by a merger of the Stamp and Taxes Office and the Excise Office in 1849; in 1854 the Excise Office staff were moved from their old headquarters in the City of London into the newly built New Wing. Somerset House continued in use by the Inland Revenue throughout the 20th century. In 2005, the Inland Revenue was merged with HM Customs and Excise; its successor HM Revenue & Customs continued to occupy much of the building, although its executive and senior management moved to 100 Parliament Street shortly after the merger. Various divisions and directorates of HMRC continued to occupy the East Wing until 2009, the West Wing until 2011 and the New Wing until March 2013, by which time all staff had been relocated (with most moving across the street to the southwest wing of Bush House). This brought to an end a 224-year association of the revenue services with Somerset House. Somerset House Laboratory In 1842, the Excise Office had established a laboratory within its Broad Street headquarters for the prevention of the adulteration of tobacco products. It had started as basically a one-man operation by an employee of the Excise, George Phillips. After the Excise Office had been merged with the Office of Stamps and Taxes to form the Inland Revenue, the latter took over the laboratory; by 1858 it was reestablished in Somerset House as the Inland Revenue Laboratory (with Phillips remaining in charge). It was also known as the Somerset House Laboratory. Under the Inland Revenue, the Laboratory's work expanded to encompass the testing of many different substances, including food, beer and spirits, as well as tobacco. Phillips retired as principal chemist in 1874. James Bell was then the principal chemist of Somerset House Laboratory until his retirement in 1894. He was replaced as principal chemist by Sir Thomas Edward Thorpe. At the same time, the laboratory was amalgamated with a similar facility that had been established within HM Customs and it was renamed the Government Laboratory. In 1897, Thorpe moved the Government Laboratory from Somerset House to a new building of his own design. =Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths= In 1837, following the establishment of civil registration in the United Kingdom, the Registrar General of Births, Marriages and Deaths set up his office in the North Wing of Somerset House, establishing a connection that lasted for over 130 years. This office held all birth, marriage and death certificates in England and Wales until 1970, when the Registry and its associated archives were moved to nearby St Catherine's House at Aldwych. From 1859 until 1998, the Principal Registry of the Court of Probate (latterly the Principal Probate Registry of the Family Division) was based in Somerset House, prior to its move to First Avenue House, High Holborn. =Other Public Offices= In addition to the learned societies, the ground floor rooms of the North wing housed the Hawkers and Pedlars Office (on the west side) and the Hackney Coach Office, the Lottery Office, the Privy Seal and Signet Offices (on the east side). The Hackney Coach commissioners had been established on a permanent footing in 1694, while the Board of Commissioners of Hawkers, Pedlars and Petty Chapmen dated from 1698;Pedlars Act 1697 the latter was abolished in 1810 and its work taken over by the Hackney Coach Office until its abolition in 1831, whereupon responsibility for licensing both of hackney carriages and of travelling traders passed to the Stamp Office. The Lottery Office, established in 1779, was also abolished in 1831 and its residual business likewise passed to the Stamp Office. The Signet Office was abolished in 1851 and the Privy Seal Office in 1884. One of the first occupants of the building had been the Duchy of Cornwall Office. It was accommodated in the East Wing along with the Tax Office and various Exchequer offices (including the Pipe Office, the Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer's Office and the Office of the Clerk of the Estreats). As early as 1795 the Exchequer was requesting that more space be made available; Sir John Soane was engaged to redesign their offices, and as part of the scheme the Duchy was relocated to another part of the East Wing, prompting complaints from its officers. Pipe rolls and other ancient records of the Treasury and Exchequer (which had been moved to Somerset House from the Palace of Westminster in 1793) remained stored in the basements until the establishment of the Public Record Office in 1838. The office of Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer ceased to exist in 1833 and the Pipe Office was abolished in 1834; however space in Somerset House continued to be at a premium: in 1854 an Act of Parliament was passed (the Duchy of Cornwall Office Act 1854) noting that the Duchy's rooms in Somerset House were now needed \\"for the use of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, whose present office is insufficient for the Business thereof, and adjoins the said Office of the Duchy of Cornwall\\". The Act provided for the Duchy Office to move to new, purpose-built premises in Pimlico: now known as 10 Buckingham Gate, the building still serves as head office for the Duchy.of the Duchy of Cornwall, Buckingham Gate, Pimlico, London\\" (architectural drawing), RIBA. From 1785 the Commissioners for Auditing Public Accounts were also housed in the East Wing, as was the Duchy of Lancaster Office (having moved there from accommodation in Gray's Inn) until it moved in 1823 to new offices across the road in Lancaster Place. The Surveyor of Crown Lands also had his office here until the early 19th century. The Salt Office initially occupied rooms in the West Wing, alongside the naval offices, but it was abolished in 1798 (administration of the salt tax having been transferred to the Board of Excise). During the 19th century the North Wing contained, in addition, the offices of the Poor Law Commissioners (1834‚Äì47) and the Tithe Commissioners (1836‚Äì51), who also acted as the Copyhold Commissioners. 19th-century expansion Part of the New Wing (main entrance facing Lancaster Place). Magnificent as the new building was, it was something short of what Chambers had intended, for he had planned for an additional terrace of houses to the east, as well as to the west of the quadrangle; work had stopped short, however, cost being the inhibiting factor. Eventually King's College London was erected to the east (the government granting the land on condition that the design conformed to Chambers' original design) by subscription between 1829 and 1834; the architect was Sir Robert Smirke. At the same time, as part of Smirke's scheme, the eastern third of the river frontage was completed, following Chambers's original design. Then, increasing demand for space led to another and last step. The western edge of the site was occupied by a row of houses used as dwellings for Admiralty officials who worked in the South Wing. Between 1851 and 1856, this terrace was substantially expanded and remodelled to provide the Inland Revenue with an entire new wing of additional office accommodation. As part of this development, its architect James Pennethorne created a monumental new fa√ßade alongside the approach road to Waterloo Bridge (which had not been in existence when Chambers was alive). 150 years later this part of the building is still known as the \\"New Wing\\". In 1891 a headquarters building was constructed in the West Court (between the West Wing and the New Wing) for the Civil Service Rifles, a Rifle Volunteer Corps. 20th-century modifications Civil Service Rifles War Memorial: installed in the main courtyard in 1919, relocated to the Terrace in 2002. By the start of the First World War the Civil Service Rifles, by then renamed the 15th (Prince of Wales' Own Civil Service Rifles) Battalion, The London Regiment, had its own Morris tube firing range (where the calibre of the rifle is reduced for indoor operation by a use of a tube) fitted with vanishing and running targets at Somerset House. Somerset House had its share of trials and tribulations during the London blitz in the Second World War. Apart from comparatively minor blast effects at various times, sixteen rooms and the handsome rotunda staircase (the Nelson Stair) were completely destroyed in the South Wing, and a further 27 damaged in the West Wing by a direct hit in October 1940. Still more windows were shattered and balustrades toppled, but the worst was over by the end of May 1941. It was not until the 1950s that this damage to the South Wing was repaired. The work required skilled masons, whose services were hard to come by in the early post-war years. Sir Albert Richardson was appointed architect for the reconstruction. He skillfully recreated the Nelson Room and rebuilt the Nelson Stair. The work was completed in 1952 at a cost of (then) ¬£84,000. In 1984 the Somerset House Act was passed, legislating the way for Somerset House to be redeveloped as a centre for the arts. In 1997 the Somerset House Trust was established as a charity to maintain the building and develop it as a centre for arts and culture. In the late 20th century the building began to be reinvigorated as a centre for the visual arts. The first institution to move in (in 1989) was the Courtauld Institute of Art, including the Courtauld Gallery, which has an important collection of old master and impressionist paintings. The Courtauld occupies the North Wing.Thurley et al (2009), p. 85. 21st-century redevelopment The dancing fountains were installed in the 1990s. The main courtyard, which had been used as a civil-service car park, and the main terrace overlooking the Thames were refurbished and opened to the public, these alterations being overseen by the conservation architects Donald Insall & Associates. Grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund financed the conversion of the South Wing between 1999 and 2003: a visitor centre featuring audio-visual displays on the history of the building, the gilded state barge of the Lord Mayor of the City of London and a shop and caf√© were opened, overlooking the river. The Gilbert Collection of decorative arts, and the Hermitage Rooms, which stage exhibitions of items loaned from the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, moved into the same area. The last Hermitage exhibition took place in 2007 and the Gilbert Collection galleries closed in 2008; the collection moved into new galleries at the Victoria and Albert Museum in June 2009. Somerset House now puts on a programme of art exhibitions, drawing on various sources. In stages from 2009 to 2013, HM Revenue and Customs withdrew from the other parts of the building; since March 2013 the Somerset House Trust has had oversight of the entire complex. Its management policy has been to rent out the upper floors at a commercial rate to \\"creative businesses\\", while devoting the ground floor to \\"public realm\\" activities. The trust receives no public subsidy and relies on income from rent and private hire to fund the upkeep of the estate and relies on ticket sales, merchandising and sponsorship to fund its artistic and cultural programme.

The courtyard is also used as a concert venue.Somerset House - Music . In July each year the \\"Summer series\\" of music events take place, which have included performances from artists such as Lily Allen.Thurley et al (2009), p. 123. Somerset House is now residence to more than a hundred tenants, comprising a large and diverse collection of creative organisations and artists including the British Fashion Council, 7Wonder, Hofesh Shechter Company and the Royal Society of Literature. The largest tenant is King's College London, whose Cultural Institute, Executive Centre and Dickson Poon School of Law occupy the East Wing, which is adjacent to its historic College Building of 1831. For a time the Representative of Anguilla (the diplomatic mission of the British Overseas Territory of Anguilla) was accommodated in part of the West Wing. =Filming location= Somerset House is a popular filming location, with its exterior featuring in several big- budget Hollywood films. These include two James Bond films, GoldenEye (1995) and Tomorrow Never Dies (1997), and several scenes of the 2003 film Shanghai Knights, starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, were filmed in the courtyard of Somerset House. The courtyard was also used in the 1991 comedy King Ralph. Elements of the 2008 film The Duchess, starring Keira Knightley and Ralph Fiennes, were filmed in October 2007. Somerset House was also used as a filming location in several Sherlock Holmes films, including 1970's The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes and, more recently, Sherlock Holmes (2009), starring Jude Law and Robert Downey, Jr., directed by Guy Ritchie. Exterior shots of Somerset House were used in the 1999 Tim Burton horror film Sleepy Hollow, starring Johnny Depp, and the 2006 film Flyboys. Somerset House was a filming location in the 2012 Bollywood film Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which starred Shah Rukh Khan, Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma, directed by Yash Chopra. Somerset House Courtyard was also used in the 2008 movie Last Chance Harvey, with Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson. Scenes were filmed in Somerset House for the Olympus Has Fallen sequel, London Has Fallen (2016). Exterior shots of Somerset House stood in for Himmler's HQ in Berlin in the 1976 film The Eagle Has Landed. Somerset House was also the main location for the BBC's New Year Live television show, presented by Natasha Kaplinsky, which celebrated the arrival of the year 2006.

He was the king of Ayutthaya Kingdom from 1656 to 1688 and arguably the most famous king of the Prasat Thong dynasty. His reign was the most prosperous during the Ayutthaya period and saw the great commercial and diplomatic activities with foreign nations including the Middle East and the West. During the later years of his reign, Narai gave his favorite ‚Äì the Greek adventurer Constantine Phaulkon ‚Äì so much power that Phaulkon technically became the chancellor of the state. Through the arrangements of Phaulkon, the Siamese kingdom came into close diplomatic relations with the court of Louis XIV and French soldiers and missionaries filled the Siamese aristocracy and defense. The dominance of French officials led to frictions between them and the native mandarins and led to the turbulent revolution of 1688 towards the end of his reign. Narai's reign was also known for the 1662‚Äì1664 invasion of Burma, the destruction of the briefly independent port city of the Sultanate of Singgora (1605‚Äì1680), and the conflict he had with the English East India Company. The presence of numerous foreigners from the French Jesuits to the Persian delegates has left historians with rich sources of material on the city of Ayutthaya and its conflicts and courtly life in the seventeenth century that otherwise would not have survived the complete destruction of the capital in 1767. Birth and name Prince Narai was born on 16 February 1633 to King Prasat Thong and his consort, Princess Sirithida (), who was a daughter of Songtham. Prasat Thong had just usurped the throne from the ruling Ayutthaya dynasty in 1629 and founded a dynasty of his own. Narai had an siblings younger sister Princess Si Suphan (or Princess Ratcha Kanlayani), elder half- brother Prince Chai, and an uncle Prince Si Suthammaracha. The Royal Chronicle of Ayutthaya: Royal Recension Version recorded that \\"In that year [1633], the princess consort gave birth to a son. When the royal family glanced at the infant, they saw the baby had four arms before having two arms as normal. Upon learning this, the king thought it was a miracle. He therefore named his son Narai.\\" The name Narai is from Sanskrit Narayana, a name of Hindu god Vishnu who has four arms. Succession King Narai portrait by European diplomat Upon Prasat Thong's death in 1656, Prince Chai succeeded his father as King Sanpet VI. However, it was a Thai tradition to give brothers a higher priority over sons in succession. Prince Sudharmmaraja plotted with his nephew, Prince Narai, to bring Sanpet VI down. After nine months of ascension, Sanpet VI was executed following a coup. Narai and his uncle marched into the palace, and Si Suthammaracha crowned himself king. Si Suthammaracha appointed Narai as the Uparaja, or Viceroy of the Front Palace. However, Narai was also an ambitious prince and had requested Dutch support against his uncle. Si Suthammaracha's rule was weak and he fell under the control of Chao Phraya Chakri, an ambitious mandarin who also wanted the throne. In 1656, Narai and his uncle finally alienated each other. Si Suthammaracha lusted after Narai's sister, Princess Ratcha Kanlayani. He ordered his soldiers to surround her residence and entered the house. The princess hid in a book chest and it was smuggled into the Front Palace, where she reunited with her brother. Enraged at his uncle's behavior, Narai decided to take action. He drew his support from the Persian and Japanese mercenaries that had been persecuted during his father's reign. He was also supported by the Dutch East India Company, as well as his brothers and the Okya Sukhothai, a powerful nobleman. On the Day of Ashura, the Persians, Japanese and Dutch stormed the palace. The prince engaged in single combat with his uncle, until the king fled to the Rear Palace. Si Suthammaracha was captured and was executed at Wat Khok Phraya on 26 October 1656. Domestic policy Memorial plate in Lopburi showing king Narai with French ambassadors. Domestic policies in King Narai's reign were greatly affected by the interference of foreign powers most notably the Chinese to the north, the Dutch to the South, and the English who were making their first forays into India to the west. Policies revolved around either directly countering the influence, or creating a delicate balance of power between the different parties.Chakrabongse, C., 1960, Lords of Life, London: Alvin Redman Limited In 1660, the Chinese invaded the Burmese capital at Ava to capture Zhu Youlang, the last Southern Ming emperor. Sensing a possible weakening of Burmese influence in the northern vassal states, King Narai began the Burmese‚ÄìSiamese War of 1662‚Äì64 to bring Chiang Mai under the direct control of Ayutthya. Although the expedition was successful in taking control of Lampang and other smaller cities, a second expedition had to be conducted to bring Chiang Mai under control in 1662. After stopping a Burmese army incursion in 1663 at Sai Yok, Narai led an army of 60,000 in an invasion of Burma, capturing Martaban, Syriam, Rangoon, Hongsawadi, and then in 1664 laid siege to Pagan. After \\"causing many casualties in dead and wounded and capturing many prisoners of war\\", the Siamese retreated.Rajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co. Ltd., Narai also handed over control of Mergui to French officer Chevalier de Beauregard and his small French garrison. At the same time, he also granted a concession of the strategic port of Bangkok to Beauregard, with the view of countering Dutch influence. King Narai also built a new palace at present-day Lopburi (\\"Louvo\\" in the French accounts) utilising the expertise of Jesuit architects and engineers. European influences are clearly evident in the architectural style, especially the use of wide windows. The move to Lopburi was arguably prompted by the Dutch naval blockade of Ayutthaya in 1664 to enforce a fur monopoly. King Narai observes a lunar eclipse with French Jesuits at Lopburi, 1685 Foreign affairs Although Catholic missions had been present in Ayutthaya as early as 1567 under Portuguese Dominicans, King Narai's reign saw the first concerted attempt to convert the monarch to Catholicism under the auspices of French Jesuits who were given permission to settle in Ayutthaya in 1662. The conversion attempt ultimately failed and arguably backfired but Catholics were to remain in Siam up to the present day. The most remarkable aspect of King Narai's reign were the diplomatic missions that he sent and received during his reign. Missions were sent as far afield as France, England, and the Vatican, although at least two missions were lost at sea. Ties with states closer to Ayutthaya were not neglected as missions were also sent to Persia, Golconda (India), China, as well as other neighbouring states. Undoubtedly, the most celebrated of these missions were those to Europe, in particular France. In 1673, a French ecclesiastical mission arrived at the Siamese court with letters from Pope Clement IX and King Louis XIV of France. King Narai reciprocated by sending a mission to France in 1680 led by Phya Pipatkosa. Although the mission was lost at sea near Madagascar, the French would respond positively by sending a commercial mission to Ayutthaya headed by Monsignor Pallu in 1682. Rising French influence Most controversially, King Narai allowed the rise of Constantine Phaulkon, a Greek adventurer who first arrived in Ayutthaya in 1675, formerly worked for the English East India Company. Phaulkon was introduced into the court by minister of foreign affairs and trade Kosa Lek in 1681 as a quick-witted interpreter and quickly gained the royal favor. In 1682 he served as the interpreter during the royal audience with Fran√ßois Pallu, who arrived with letters from Louis XIV. Within a few years, Phaulkon had managed to ingratiate himself with the king and became Narai's closest counselor. Phaulkon suggested a plan for the reconstruction of the fort of Mergui in polygonal European style, which was strongly opposed by Kosa Lek. Kosa Lek was later accused of receiving bribes from peasants who did not want to be drafted into the Mergui construction. He was flogged to death under royal orders. The second half of Narai's reign was a period of growing French influence as facilitated by Phaulkon. Under Phaulkon's guidance, King Narai balanced the influence of the Dutch by favouring the French. Phaulkon also encouraged French interest by initially leading them to believe that the king was about to convert to Catholicism. Although King Narai did display a degree of interest in Catholicism, he also displayed an equal interest in Islam and there is no concrete evidence that he wished to convert to either. However, both Catholic and Islamic missions were to come to the conclusion that Phaulkon was responsible for their failures. Siamese courtiers also resented Phaulkon's influence and he quickly became the focus of xenophobic sentiments at court, with the future King Phetracha at their head. Narai responded the French by the dispatch of Siamese mission to France in January 1684 led by Khun Pijaivanit and Khun Pijitmaitri accompanied by missionary Benigne Vachet. They reached Calais by November and eventually had the French royal audience. Louis XIV sent de Chaumont as chief ambassador, and de Choisy to lead the French mission in 1685 to return the Siamese ambassadors and to convert Narai to Catholicism. The mission contained a large number of Jesuit priests and scientists. Colbert sent his letter to Phaulkon to instruct him to persuade the Siamese king to concede to French requests with the promises of granting him the rank of count. Kosa Pan presents King Narai's letter to Louis XIV at Versailles, 1 September 1686 Siamese embassy to Louis XIV in 1686, by Nicolas Larmessin. Though he did not convert to Christianity, Narai agreed to allow the French troops to be stationed in Siamese ports. Chevalier de Forbin was made commander of the Bangkok fort and trained Siamese armies in Western warfare. Several Siamese forts including Mergui, Ligor, Singora (Songkhla), Lavo, and Ayutthaya itself were reconstructed in European style. Another Siamese mission to France was led by Phra Visutsundhorn (Kosa Pan, younger brother of Kosa Lek) and Guy Tachard in 1686 with enthusiastic European reception. A fragmentary Siamese account of the mission compiled by Kosa Pan was re-discovered in Paris in the 1980s. In 1686, a revolt broke out in Ayutthaya, caused by the Makassars whom were seeking asylum in Siam after being expelled by the Dutch Empire. Constantine Phaulkon and Forbin mobilized the defence of the Kingdom, with the forces of Ayutthaya made up from a coalition of French, English and Siamese troops. The Makassars were subsequently defeated and Narai had many burnt at the stake. Samuel White, the English governor of Mergui fort, appointed by Narai and a close associate of Phaulkon, entered into conflict with the English fleets from India in 1687, leading to the English blockade of Mergui. The Siamese native mandarins massacred the local Englishmen out of frustration. With English fleets threatening his kingdom, Narai decided to placate the English and executed the mandarins. Pope Innocent XI receives the Siamese envoys, led by Father Tachard who reads the translation of the message from King Narai, December 1688 In 1687 the new French mission left Brest for Ayutthaya. The mission included Kosa Pan returning home, Guy Tachard again, Simon de La Loub√®re, Claude C√©beret du Boullay, and General Desfarges. A French army regiment was sent with this mission to be stationed in Siamese forts with Desfarges as the military commander. Narai agreed to station French troops at Mergui and Bangkok, both with Western-style forts. Desfarges was stationed at Bangkok. (The fort is now called the Vijaiprasit Fort later the royal fort of King Taksin). The last Siamese embassy was led by Ok-khun Chamnan in 1688 visiting Rome and Pope Innocent XI. The \\"Revolution\\" of 1688 Narai spent his whole reign reducing the power of native mandarins that had caused much bloodshed during his predecessors‚Äô time. He firstly supported Persian and later the French guards and advisors against the Thai mandarins. Even his ascension to the throne was orchestrated by Persian mercenaries. The French eventually enjoyed special favors from religious affairs to the military activities. One of the critical turning points concerned with the construction of the French forts and military barracks in Bangkok, at the river mouth. In dealing with the activities, the French mostly depended on Constantine Phaulkon, the king's favorite. The threat of the French military presence, reportedly, was felt among the court nobles. All in all, factionalism, favoritism and nepotism became widespread. The native mandarins somehow managed to retain their powers, most notably Kosa Lek. Petracha, Commander of the Royal Regiment of Elephants, emerged as the leading \\"nationalist\\". Petracha had familial connections to Narai, with his mother being the king's wet nurse and his sister being the king's concubine. Narai was said to fear fathering a son. He therefore ordered abortions to be carried out on any of his impregnated consorts. However he adopted the son of a minor mandarin with the name of Phra Pi and named him his successor. The young prince was embraced by the French who managed to convert him to Catholicism. Matters were brought to a head when King Narai fell gravely ill in March 1688 while staying in his Lopburi palaces. Aware of the coming succession dispute, in May 1688 Narai called together his closest councillors: Phaulkon, Phra Phetracha, and Phra Pi and nominated his daughter, Kromluang Yothathep to succeed him. The three councillors were to act as regents until the princess took on a partner of her choice from one of the two Siamese councillors. When Narai was seriously ill with no hope of recovery, on 18 May 1688 Phetracha had a successful coup and arrested Narai himself, Phra Pi, and his half-brothers Prince Aphaithot and Prince Noi. Phaulkon was summoned to the palace, there he and French officers were surrounded and disarmed. Phaulkon was thrown to the palace dungeon and brutally tortured. After questioning Phra Pi, he discovered Phra Pi had conspired with Phaulkon to assume the throne, and Phra Pi was executed on 20 May. Further questioning of Phaulkon revealed a plot to raise a rebellion, and he too was executed by Phetracha's adopted son Luang Sorasak on 5 June. Narai, on his deathbed, was unable to do anything, except curse Phetracha and his son. Luang Sorasak then had Prince Aphaithot and Prince Noi executed. Phetracha soon ordered his troops to attack the French troops led by General Desfarges at the start of Siege of Bangkok. On the death of King Narai on 11 July, Phetracha proclaimed himself king. After withholding the siege for four months and later a negotiated settlement, the French soldiers were allowed to return to France. Only Hollanders were allowed to trade in the capital before the French and English finally ended their dispute with Siam. Legacy Contemporary French depiction of King Narai. Although King Narai's reign witnessed the greatest extent of foreign influence at the Siamese court, his diplomatic achievements were to be reversed by his successor. It is debatable whether the new introspective attitude of his successors contributed to the weakening and eventual fall of Ayutthaya. On the other hand, the curtailing of foreign influences in the court may have prevented the colonisation of Ayutthaya. Nevertheless, his reign's diplomatic achievements contributed to him being posthumously styled \\"the Great,\\" one of seven recognised as such in the history of Thailand. At the same time, the records of those involved in the diplomatic missions, particularly those from the west, have allowed historians to obtain a rare glimpse into the world of the Ayutthayan court as most original Ayutthaya records were destroyed with the city in 1767. These include the French accounts of the Chevalier de Chaumont, the Abb√© de Choisy, Fr. Tachard, Claude de Forbin, de la Loubere and the Persian account of Muhammad Rabi' ibn Muhammad Ibrahim. Domestically, the relative stability during his reign also gave rise to the revival of Siamese literature during his reign.Kings of Thailand Further afield, one of the main streets of the city of Brest as well as another in Marseilles have been named \\"Rue de Siam\\" to commemorate Narai's missions, whilst an ancient street in Lop Buri Province, where Narai dwelt at the time he received the Chevalier de Chaumont, has been named \\"Rue de France\\" by the Thai government in 1985 to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the relations between the two countries. In addition, among the gifts that were exchanged between the Siamese and the French courts, two items from Siam were to have an unexpected impact on French history. The items were a pair of silver cannons that were eventually stored in the Royal Furniture Repository in Paris since they were classed as gifts rather than weapons. After failing to find usable weapons at the Arsenal, rioting Parisians broke into the Repository and discovered some 20 cannons. However, the Siamese cannons were the only ones that still functioned, and so they were hauled to the Bastille. The date was 14 July 1789.Carlyle, T., The French Revolution, Section V See also *France-Thailand relations *Constantine Phaulkon *Claude de Forbin *Fran√ßois-Timol√©on de Choisy NotesReferences * Cruysse, Dirk van der (2002).

Despite its name, it is generally not considered to be a part of Harlem.Gurock, Jeffrey S., et al. \\"Harlem\\" in , p. 573. The neighborhood is one of the largest predominantly Hispanic communities in New York City, mostly made up of Puerto Ricans, as well as sizeable numbers of Dominican, Cuban and Mexican immigrants. The community is notable for its contributions to Latin freestyle and salsa music. East Harlem also includes the area formerly known as Italian Harlem, in which the remnants of a once predominantly Italian community remain. The Chinese population has increased dramatically in East Harlem since 2000. East Harlem has historically suffered from many social issues, such as a high crime rate, the highest jobless rate in New York City, teenage pregnancy, AIDS, drug abuse, homelessness, and an asthma rate five times the national average. It has the second-highest concentration of public housing in the United States, behind Brownsville, Brooklyn. However, East Harlem is undergoing some gentrification. In February 2016, East Harlem was one of four neighborhoods featured in an article in The New York Times about \\"New Hot Neighborhoods\\", and the city was considering re-zoning the area. East Harlem is part of Manhattan Community District 11, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10029 and 10035. It is patrolled by the 23rd and 25th Precincts of the New York City Police Department.  History =Early history The area which became East Harlem was rural for most of the 19th century, but residential settlements northeast of Third Avenue and East 110th Street had developed by the 1860s. The construction of the elevated transit line to Harlem in 1879 and 1880, and the building of the Lexington Avenue subway in 1919, urbanized the area, precipitating the construction of apartment buildings and brownstones. The extension of cable cars up Lexington Avenue into East Harlem was stymied by the incline created by Duffy's Hill at 103rd Street, one of the steepest grades in Manhattan. East Harlem was first populated by poor German, Irish, Scandinavian, and Eastern European Jewish immigrants, with the Jewish population standing at 90,000 around 1917. In the 1870s, Italian immigrants joined the mix after a contractor building trolley tracks on First Avenue imported Italian laborers as strikebreakers. The workers' shantytown along the East River at 106th Street was the beginning of an Italian neighborhood, with 4,000 having arrived by the mid-1880s. As more immigrants arrived, it expanded north to East 115th Street and west to Third Avenue., p.1123-24 East Harlem consisted of pockets of ethnically-sorted settlements ‚Äì Italian, German, Irish, and Jewish ‚Äì which were beginning to press up against each other, with the spaces still between them occupied by \\"gasworks, stockyards and tar and garbage dumps\\". In 1895, Union Settlement Association, one of the oldest settlement houses in New York City, began providing services in the area, offering the immigrant and low-income residents a range of community-based programs, including boys and girls clubs, a sewing school and adult education classes. Italian Harlem Southern Italians and Sicilians, with a moderate number of Northern Italians, soon predominated, especially in the area east of Lexington Avenue between 96th and 116th Streets and east of Madison Avenue between 116th and 125th Streets, with each street featuring people from different regions of Italy. The neighborhood became known as \\"Italian Harlem\\", the Italian American hub of Manhattan; it was the first part of Manhattan to be referred to as \\"Little Italy\\". p.154 The first Italians arrived in East Harlem in 1878, from Polla in the province of Salerno, and settled in the vicinity of 115th Street.Meyer, Gerald. \\"Italian Harlem: America‚Äôs Largest and Most Italian Little Italy\\" There were many crime syndicates in Italian Harlem from the early Black Hand to the bigger and more organized Italian gangs that formed the Italian-American Mafia. It was the founding location of the Genovese crime family, one of the Five Families that dominated organized crime in New York City. This includes the current 116th Street Crew of the Genovese family. During the 1970s, Italian East Harlem was also home to the Italian- American drug gang and murder-for-hire crew known as the East Harlem Purple Gang. In the 1920s and early 1930s, Italian Harlem was represented in Congress by future Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, and later, in the 1940s, by Italian- American civil rights lawyer, activist, and socialist Vito Marcantonio. The Italian neighborhood approached its peak in the 1930s, with over 110,000 Italian-Americans living in its crowded, run-down apartment buildings.Lapp, Michael \\"East Harlem\\" in Quote: \\"During the 1930s as many as 110,000 Italians lived east of Lexington Avenue between 96th and 116th streets and east of Madison Avenue between 116th and 125th streets.\\" The 1930 census showed that 81 percent of the population of Italian Harlem consisted of first- or second- generation Italian Americans, somewhat less than the concentration of Italian Americans in the Lower East Side's Little Italy with 88 percent; Italian Harlem's total population, however, was three times that of Little Italy. The Italian community in East Harlem remained strong into the 1980s, but it has slowly diminished since then. However, Italian inhabitants and vestiges of the old Italian neighborhood remain. The annual Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the \\"Dancing of the Giglio\\", the first Italian feast in New York City, is still celebrated there every year on the second weekend of August by the Giglio Society of East Harlem. Italian retail establishments still exist, such as Rao's restaurant, started in 1896, and the original Patsy's Pizzeria which opened in 1933. In May 2011, one of the last remaining Italian retail businesses in the neighborhood, a barbershop owned by Claudio Caponigro on 116th Street, was threatened with closure by a rent increase. Spanish Harlem Puerto Rican and Latin American migration after the First World War. p. 265-268 established an enclave at the western portion of East Harlem ‚Äì around 110th Street and Lexington Avenue ‚Äì which became known as \\"Spanish Harlem\\". The area slowly grew to encompass all of East Harlem, including Italian Harlem, as Italians moved out ‚Äì to the Bronx, Brooklyn, upstate New York and New Jersey ‚Äì and Latinos moved in during another wave of immigration in the 1940s and 1950s. Although in certain areas, particularly around Pleasant Avenue, Italian Harlem lasted through the 1970s, today most of the former Italian population is gone. Most of these predominantly older residents are clustered around Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, mainly from 114th to 118th Streets. According to the 2000 Census, there were only 1,130 Italian- Americans still living in this area.Garland, Sarah. \\"A Reunion of Little Italy in East Harlem\\", The New York Times, September 5, 2006. Accessed January 2, 2008. \\"Now, there are only 1,130 Italian-Americans left in East Harlem, according to the 2000 census.\\" The newly dominant Puerto Rican population, which reached 63,000 in 1950, continued to define the neighborhood according to its needs, establishing bodegas and bot√°nicas as it expanded; by the 1930s there was already an enclosed street market underneath the Park Avenue railroad viaduct between 111th and 116th Streets, called \\"La Marqueta\\" (\\"The Market\\"). Catholic and evangelistic Protestant churches appeared in storefronts. Although \\"Spanish Harlem\\" had been in use since at least the 1930s to describe the Latino enclave ‚Äì along with \\"Italian Harlem\\" and \\"Negro Harlem\\", p.253 ‚Äì the name began to be used to describe the entire East Harlem neighborhood by the 1950s. Later, the name \\"El Barrio\\" (\\"The Neighborhood\\") began to be used, especially by residents of the area. Decline In the 1950s and 1960s, large sections of East Harlem were leveled for urban renewal projects, and the neighborhood was one of the hardest hit areas in the 1960s and 1970s as New York City struggled with deficits, race riots, urban flight, gang warfare, drug abuse, crime and poverty. Tenements were crowded, poorly maintained, and frequent targets for arson. In 1969 and 1970, a regional chapter of the Young Lords which were reorganized from a neighborhood street gang in Chicago by Jose (Cha-Cha) Jimenez, ran several programs including a Free Breakfast for Children and a Free Health Clinic to help Latino and poor families. The Young Lords came together with the Black Panthers and called for Puerto Rican independence and neighborhood empowerment. Still, as of the early 2000s, the Latin Kings gang remained prevalent in East Harlem. Recent history By the beginning of the 21st century, East Harlem was a racially diverse neighborhood, with about a third of the population being Puerto Rican. As it has been throughout its history, it is predominantly a working-class neighborhood. Until 2006, property values in East Harlem climbed along with those in the rest of New York City. With increased market-rate housing, including luxury condos and co-ops ‚Äì most built on formerly vacant lots ‚Äì there has been some decline of affordable housing in the community. A number of young professionals have settled into these recently constructed buildings. This influx of \\"yuppies\\" has caused rents to rise, more buildings in the area to get gut renovations, and changes to area demographics. On March 12, 2014 at 9:00 EDT, a large explosion and fire at 1644‚Äì1646 Park Avenue killed eight people and injured more than 70.\\"New York Gas Explosion Kills Six People\\" Sky News (March 13, 2014)Alcindor, Yamiche and Stanglin, Doug. \\"8th body found in ruins of East Harlem buildings\\" USA Today (March 13, 2014) The New York Post listed one part of the neighborhood ‚Äì the block of Lexington Avenue between East 123rd and 124th Streets ‚Äì as one of \\"the most dangerous blocks in the city\\" because police crime statistics for 2015 showed that 19 assaults had taken place there, more than for any other city block. The Post also reported that there were, according to the Harlem Neighborhood Block Association, \\"22 drug-treatment programs, four homeless-services providers and four transitional-living facilities\\" in East Harlem. Balsamini, Dean (March 6, 2016) \\"Do you live on one of New York's most dangerous blocks?\\" New York Post East Harlem has begun to feel the effects of gentrification. In February 2016, an article in The New York Times about \\"New York's Next Hot Neighborhoods\\" featured East Harlem as one of four such areas. A real-estate broker described it as \\"one of the few remaining areas in New York City where you can secure a good deal\\". The article mentioned new luxury developments, access to transportation, the opening of new retail stores, bars and restaurants, and national-brand stores beginning to appear on the outskirts of the neighborhood. Primarily, though, it was the cost of housing in comparison to the rest of Manhattan, which the article noted as the major factor.Higgins, Michelle (February 26, 2016) \\"New York‚Äôs Next Hot Neighborhoods\\" The New York Times Beginning in 2016, the New York City government was seeking to rezone East Harlem \\"to facilitate new residential, commercial, community facility, and manufacturing development\\".Staff (November 10, 2016) \\"East Harlem Scoping Notification\\" New York City Department of City Planning The residents of the neighborhood generated a suggested zoning plan, the \\"East Harlem Neighborhood Plan\\", which was offered to the city in February 2017, but in August 2017 residents and the Manhattan Borough President, Gale Brewer, complained that the city had ignored their plan almost entirely.Solis, Gustavo (August 24, 2017) \\"Mayor Ignoring Residents in East Harlem Rezoning Plan, Boro Prez Says\\" DNAinfo In 2019, the oldest portion of the neighborhood, the blocks of East 111th through 120th Streets between Park and Pleasant Avenues, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the East Harlem Historic District.  Demographics  Storefronts at Lexington Avenue and 116th Street The New York City Department of City Planning classifies East Harlem into two neighborhood tabulation areas: East Harlem North and East Harlem South, divided along 115th Street.New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012.

Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 17.4% (10,072) White, 24.6% (14,227) African American, 0.2% (96) Native American, 8.3% (4,802) Asian, 0.1% (55) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (218) from other races, and 1.6% (933) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 47.5% (27,499) of the population. The most significant changes in the racial composition of East Harlem between 2000 and 2010 were the Asian population's increase by 109% (3,427), the White population's increase by 68% (5,689), and the Black population's decrease by 12% (4,625). Although more of the influx of Asian and White residents was in East Harlem South, the greatest percentage growth was in East Harlem North, while the Black population's decrease was evenly split. The Hispanic / Latino population also decreased by 4% (2,485), a decrease almost entirely concentrated in East Harlem South, where it fell from being the majority group to the plurality group. The small population of other races experienced a slight increase of 5% (132). The entirety of Manhattan Community District 11, which consists of East Harlem, Randall's Island, and Ward's Island, had 124,323 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 77.3 years. This is 3.9 years lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most residents are children and middle-aged adults: 21% are between the ages of 0‚Äì17, while 33% are between 25 and 44, and 23% are between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 13% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 11 was $36,770. In 2018, an estimated 23% of Community District 11 residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in nine residents (11%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 48% in Community District 11, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Community District 11 is considered to be gentrifying: according to the Community Health Profile, the district was low-income in 1990 and has seen above-median rent growth up to 2010.  Ethnic groups  Community District 11 is a mostly low to middle income area. It is made up of first and second generation Puerto Ricans, African-Americans, Italian- Americans, Asian-Americans, West Indian Americans (especially Dominican Americans and Cuban Americans), and a growing population of Mexican Americans and Salvadoran Americans and other Central American immigrants. It has one of the highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans in all of New York City. As of 2010, the Puerto Rican population was 27.7% in zip code 10029, and 23.4% in 10035. 10035 also has a large Mexican population, at 10.7%. As noted before, the number of Asians in East Harlem more than doubled between 2000 and 2010, largely due to Chinese people moving to East Harlem. Increasing rents in Lower Manhattan's Chinatown have driven many into public and subsidized housing developments in the neighborhood. Advocates have been calling for Chinese language services to be available in the community centers to accommodate the growing number of Chinese residents in the area. In 2000, the Chinese population in the northern portion was less than one percent, but by 2010, it has gone up to being three percent in the area. In the southern part, it rose from 4.6% to 8.4%. Social issues Social problems, including poverty, crime, and drug addiction, have long plagued the area. Although crime rates have dropped from the historically high numbers of the past, East Harlem suffers from a relatively high violent crime rate, especially in the 25th Precinct above 115th Street. In 2019, the 25th Precinct had the third-highest rate of felony assault, the sixth-highest rates of rape and robbery, the tenth-highest rate of burglary, and the fourteenth-highest rate of murder out of the New York Police Department's 77 precincts. East Harlem has the highest concentration of shelters and facilities in Manhattan, with eight homeless shelters, 36 drug and alcohol treatment facilities and 37 mental health treatment facilities. It also has the highest jobless rate in the entire city, as well as the city's second highest cumulative AIDS rate. The asthma rate is also 5 times larger than national levels. The neighborhood also suffers from a high poverty rate. Union Settlement Association is one of the neighborhood's largest social service agencies, reaching more than 13,000 people annually at 17 locations throughout East Harlem, through a range of programs, including early childhood education, youth development, senior services, job training, the arts, adult education, nutrition, counseling, a farmers' market, community development, and neighborhood cultural events. Housing Metro North Plaza Houses Jefferson Houses Wagner Houses Washington Houses East Harlem is dominated by public housing complexes of various types, with a high concentration of older tenement buildings between these developments. The neighborhood contains the second-highest concentration of public housing in the United States, behind Brownsville, Brooklyn. The total land area is . After a wave of arson ravaged the low income communities of New York City throughout the 1970s, many of the residential structures in East Harlem were left seriously damaged or destroyed. By the late 1970s, the city began to rehabilitate many abandoned tenement style buildings and designate them as low income housing. Despite recent gentrification of the neighborhood, large numbers of apartment buildings have been deliberately kept vacant by their owners. Although the businesses on the ground floor are retained, landlords do not want to have the trouble involved in residential tenants. In some cases, landlords are waiting for a revived economy, warehousing the apartments so that they can rent them later at a higher rent. In 2007, a survey of Manhattan's buildings found that 1,723 were significantly vacant, three- quarters of them north of 96th Street. A 1998 survey found that one-quarter of low-rise residential buildings on avenues or major cross streets in East Harlem had sealed-up residential floors, despite having commercial businesses on the ground floor.  Public housing projects  There are twenty-four New York City Housing Authority developments located in East Harlem. As of 2013, 93.6% of all housing units were renter-occupied, and over 25% of the population resided in public housing units managed by the NYCHA. * 335 East 111th Street; one 6-story building * East 120th Street Rehab; one, 6-story rehabilitated tenement building *East River Houses; ten buildings, 6, 10 and 11 stories tall * Edward Corsi Houses; one 16-story building * Gaylord White Houses; one 20-story building *George Washington Carver Houses; 13 buildings, 6 and 15 stories tall * Governor Dewitt Clinton Houses; six buildings, 9 and 18 stories tall *Jackie Robinson Houses; one 8-story building *James Weldon Johnson Houses; ten 14-story buildings * Lehman Village; four 20-story buildings * Lexington Houses; four 14-story buildings * Metro North Plaza; three buildings, 7, 8, and 11 stories tall * Metro North Rehab; seventeen 6-story rehabilitated tenement buildings * Milbank-Frawley; two rehabilitated tenement buildings 5 and 6 stories tall * Morris Park Senior Citizens Home; one 9-story rehabilitated building * Park Avenue-East 122nd Street, 123rd Streets; two 6-story buildings * President Abraham Lincoln; fourteen buildings, 6 and 14 stories tall * President George Washington Houses; fourteen buildings, 12 and 14 stories tall * President Thomas Jefferson Houses; eighteen buildings, 7, 13 and 14 stories tall * President Woodrow Wilson Houses; three 20-story buildings * Senator Robert A.

Economy The neighborhood is home to one of the few major television studios north of midtown, Metropolis at 106th Street and Park Avenue, where shows such as BET's 106 & Park and Chappelle's Show have been produced. PRdream.com, a web site on the history and culture of Puerto Ricans, founded a media gallery and digital film studio called MediaNoche in 2003. It presents technology-based art on Park Avenue and 102nd Street, providing exhibition space and residencies for artists and filmmakers, and webcasting events. Police and crime NYPD 25th Precinct station house East Harlem is served by two precincts of the NYPD. The area north of 116th Street is served by the 25th Precinct, located at 120 East 119th Street, while the area south of 116th Street is served by the 23rd Precinct, located at 164 East 102nd Street. The 25th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 65.5% between 1990 and 2019. The precinct reported 3 murders, 23 rapes, 172 robberies, 329 felony assaults, 108 burglaries, 461 grand larcenies, and 21 grand larcenies auto in 2019. Of the five major violent felonies (murder, rape, felony assault, robbery, and burglary), the 25th Precinct had a rate of 1,340 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2019, compared to the boroughwide average of 632 crimes per 100,000 and the citywide average of 572 crimes per 100,000. The 23rd Precinct also has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 75.5% between 1990 and 2019. The precinct reported 2 murders, 20 rapes, 168 robberies, 330 felony assaults, 79 burglaries, 296 grand larcenies, and 21 grand larcenies auto in 2019. Of the five major violent felonies (murder, rape, felony assault, robbery, and burglary), the 23rd Precinct had a rate of 819 crimes per 100,000 residents in 2019, compared to the boroughwide average of 632 crimes per 100,000 and the citywide average of 572 crimes per 100,000. , Community District 11 has a non-fatal assault hospitalization rate of 130 per 100,000 people, compared to the boroughwide rate of 49 per 100,000 and the citywide rate of 59 per 100,000. Its incarceration rate is 1,291 per 100,000 people, compared to the boroughwide rate of 407 per 100,000 and the citywide rate of 425 per 100,000. In 2019, the highest concentration of felony assaults in East Harlem was around the intersection of 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, where there were 39 felony assaults. This location is well known as an open-air drug market and hotspot of other crimes.

Associated Supermarkets grocery on East 101st Street  Fresh food  A lack of access to healthy food causes serious hardships to citizens of East Harlem, a neighborhood which is considered to be a food desert. According to an April 2008 report prepared by the New York City Department of City Planning, East Harlem is an area of the city with the highest levels of diet-related diseases due to limited opportunities for citizens to purchase fresh foods. With a high population density and a lack of nearby supermarkets, the neighborhood has little access to fresh fruit and vegetables and a low consumption of fresh foods. Citizens of East Harlem are likely to buy food from grocery stores that have a limited supply of fruits and vegetables, which are often of poor quality and generally more expensive than the same products sold at supermarkets. Compared to the Upper East Side, supermarkets in Harlem are 30% less common. Without access to affordable produce and meats, East Harlem residents have difficulty eating a healthy diet, which contributes to high rates of obesity and diabetes. In 2011, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer announced a program which would send Veggie Vans to East Harlem senior centers and housing projects. In 2012, Whole Foods announced two uptown locations, one being on 125th Street and Lenox Avenue, the other in the Upper East Side.

The airport is sometimes referred to as KCIA (King County International Airport), but is not the airport identifier. The airport has some passenger service operated by Kenmore Air and JSX, but is mostly used by general aviation and cargo. It is named for the founder of Boeing, William E. Boeing and was constructed in 1928, serving as the city's primary airport until the opening of Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport in 1944. The airport's property is mostly in Seattle just south of Georgetown, with its southern tip extending into Tukwila. The Airport covers , averages more than 180,000 operations annually, and has approximately 380 based aircraft. History Boeing Field was Seattle's main passenger airport from its construction in 1928 until Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport began operations in the late 1940s, with the exception of its use for military purposes during World War II. The Boeing Company continues to use the field for testing and delivery of its airplanes, and it is still a regional cargo hub. It is used by Air Force One when the President of the United States visits the Seattle area. The August 1946 OAG lists 24 United Airlines weekday departures, 10 weekly flights on Northwest Airlines and several Pan Am Douglas DC-3s a week to Juneau via Annette Island Airport, which then served Ketchikan. Northwest moved to SEA in 1947, United moved in 1949, and Pan Am in 1953;https://merrick.library.miami.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/asm0341/id/21774/rec/314 West Coast and its successors remained at Boeing Field until 1971. Boeing Field has two passenger airlines, JSX, with daily jets to Oakland International Airport, and Kenmore Air with 4-6 daily flights to each Friday Harbor and East Sound/Orcas Island. Before 2019, the last scheduled passenger jets were Hughes Airwest DC-9s in 1971. A proposal by Southwest Airlines in June 2005 was submitted to King County to relocate from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to Boeing Field, but was rejected by King County Executive Ron Sims in October. A similar proposal by Alaska Airlines (a response to the Southwest proposal) was also rejected. Southwest Airlines said it wanted to avoid the heavy fees at Sea-Tac due to its expansion program. The transfer of ownership of Boeing Field from King County to the Port of Seattle was proposed in 2007 as part of a land swap with land owned by the Port.County, Port, BNSF Announce Signed Memoranda on Land Deal , Port of Seattle, February 26, 2007. Retrieved 2009-02-21. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015 called it a primary commercial service airport. Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 34,597 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 35,863 in 2009 and 33,656 in 2010. Facilities The airport covers at an elevation of 21 feet (6 m). It has two asphalt runways: 14R/32L is 10,007 by 200 feet (3,050 x 61 m) and 14L/32R is 3,709 by 100 feet (1,131 x 30 m). In the year ending January 1, 2019 the airport had 183,268 aircraft operations, average 502 per day: 79% general aviation, 15% air taxi, 6% airline, and <1% military. 384 aircraft were then based at this airport: 229 single-engine, 40 multi- engine, 88 jet, 26 helicopter, and 1 glider. The runway numbers were updated from 13/31 to 14/32 in August 2017, due to shifting magnetic headings. Boeing Company The Boeing Company has facilities at the airport. Final preparations for delivery of Boeing 737 aircraft after the first test flight are made at Boeing Field. Boeing facilities at the airport have also included a paint hangar and flight test facilities. The initial assembly of the 737 was at Boeing Field in the 1960s because the factory in Renton was at capacity building the Boeing 707 and Boeing 727. After 271 aircraft, production moved to Renton in late 1970. Production of military airborne early warning and control aircraft based on the 737, such as Project Wedgetail (Australia) aircraft and Peace Eagle (Turkey) aircraft is located at Boeing Field. Museum of Flight The Museum of Flight is on the southwest corner of the field. Among the aircraft on display is an ex-British Airways Concorde, lent to the museum from BA, a supersonic airliner that landed at Boeing Field on its first visit to Seattle on November 15, 1984. Aircraft on the airfield can be seen from the museum. Police and fire response The King County International Airport contracts with the King County Sheriff's Office for police services. Deputies assigned to the airport wear a mix of both Police and Fire uniforms, turnouts etc., which includes single Police, Fire/ARFF patch, and drive King County International Airport Police patrol cars. There are currently 17 patrol officers/sergeants and one chief assigned full-time to the airport. Officers assigned to the airport are also required to obtain a Washington State Fire Fighter One certification and an Emergency Medical Technician certification. Airlines and destinations=PassengerCargoAirline service Boeing Field had scheduled passenger flights on West Coast Airlines to Idaho, Oregon, Washington state, northern California, western Montana, northern Utah, and Calgary in Alberta. The airline's April 1968 timetable showed non-stop service to Aberdeen, WA/Hoquiam, WA, Boise, ID, Olympia, WA, Pasco, WA, Portland, OR, Salt Lake City, UT, Spokane, WA, Tacoma, WA, Wenatchee, WA and Yakima, WA. West Coast, which had its headquarters in the Seattle area and operated all of its flights from Boeing Field, merged with Pacific Air Lines and Bonanza Air Lines to form Air West (later renamed Hughes Airwest) which continued at Boeing Field until it moved to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport in 1971. Aeroamerica, an airline based at Boeing Field from 1971 to 1982 which operated Boeing 707s and Boeing 720s, flew nonstop to Spokane, Washington. Air Oregon, a commuter airline, scheduled Swearingen Metros in 1979 to its hub in Portland, Oregon. Helijet, a helicopter airline based at Vancouver International Airport in British Columbia, operated scheduled helicopter flights to the Victoria Harbour Heliport in British Columbia with direct one stop service to Helijet's Vancouver Harbour Heliport next to downtown Vancouver, B.C. JSX began service between Boeing Field and Oakland International Airport on July 1, 2019, using Embraer 135 jets. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, JSX announced in April 2020 that it would indefinitely cease its flights from Boeing Field. ICE flights The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against King County in 2020 to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation flights to leave from Boeing Field. The county had previously halted the practice, forcing the flights to be redirected to Yakima Air Terminal.

Over 600 names have been proposed in the genus, but nearly all have either been moved to other genera or been regarded as synonyms. The genus Myrtus has three species recognised today: *Myrtus communis ‚Äì Common myrtle; native to the Mediterranean region in southern Europe. *Myrtus nivellei ‚Äì Saharan myrtle; native to North Africa. *Myrtus phyllireaefolia Description=Common myrtle Myrtus communis, the \\"common myrtle\\", is native across the Mediterranean region, Macaronesia, western Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. It is also cultivated. The plant is an evergreen shrub or small tree, growing to tall. The leaf is entire, 3‚Äì5 cm long, with a fragrant essential oil. The star-like flower has five petals and sepals, and numerous stamens. Petals usually are white. The flower is pollinated by insects. The fruit is a round berry containing several seeds, most commonly blue-black in colour. A variety with yellow-amber berries is also present. The seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the berries. Saharan myrtle Myrtus nivellei, the Saharan myrtle, (Tuareg language: tefeltest), is endemic to the mountains of the central Sahara Desert.Uicnmed.org: Myrtus nivellei - Batt & Trab. - Myrtaceae . accessed 1.10.2014. It is found in a restricted range in the Tassili n'Ajjer Mountains in southern Algeria, and the Tibesti Mountains in northern Chad. It occurs in small areas of sparse relict woodland at montane elevations above the central Saharan desert plains. It is a traditional medicinal plant for the Tuareg people. Fossil record 250 fossil seeds of ‚Ä†Myrtus palaeocommunis have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark.Angiosperm Fruits and Seeds from the Middle Miocene of Jutland (Denmark) by Else Marie Friis, The Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters 24:3, 1985 Uses=Gardening Myrtus communis is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant for use as a shrub in gardens and parks. It is often used as a hedge plant, with its small leaves shearing cleanly. When trimmed less frequently, it has numerous flowers in late summer. It requires a long hot summer to produce its flowers, and protection from winter frosts. The species and the subspecies M. communis subsp. tarentina have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Culinary Myrtus communis is used in the islands of Sardinia and Corsica to produce an aromatic liqueur called Mirto by macerating it in alcohol. Mirto is one of the most typical drinks of Sardinia and comes in two varieties: mirto rosso (red) produced by macerating the berries, and mirto bianco (white) produced from the less common yellow berries and sometimes the leaves.:it:Liquore di mirto Many Mediterranean pork dishes include myrtle berries, and roasted piglet is often stuffed with myrtle sprigs in the belly cavity, to impart an aromatic flavour to the meat. The berries, whole or ground, have been used as a pepper substitute. They contribute to the distinctive flavor of Mortadella sausage and the related American Bologna sausage. In Calabria, a myrtle branch is threaded through dried figs and then baked. The figs acquire a pleasant taste from the essential oils of the herb. They are then enjoyed through the winter months. Medicinal Myrtle (Myrtus communis) essential oil in a clear glass vial Myrtle, along with willow tree bark, occupies a prominent place in the writings of Hippocrates, Pliny, Dioscorides, Galen, and the Arabian writers.Pharmacographia Indica (1891 edition), London It has been prescribed for fever and pain by ancient physicians since at least 2,500 BC in Sumer. Myrtle's effects are due to high levels of salicylic acid, a compound related to aspirin and the basis of the modern class of drugs known as NSAIDs. In several countries, particularly in Europe and China, there has been a tradition for prescribing this substance for sinus infections. A systematic review of herbal medicines used for the treatment of rhinosinusitis concluded that the evidence that any herbal medicines are beneficial in the treatment of rhinosinusitis is limited, and that for Myrtus there is insufficient data to verify the significance of clinical results. In myth and ritual Unripe myrtle berries of blue (\\"black\\") variety. Ripe myrtle berries of the blue (\\"black\\") variety. =Classical= In Greek mythology and ritual the myrtle was sacred to the goddesses AphroditeV. Pirenne-Delforge, \\"√âpith√®tes cultuelles et interpretation philosophique: √† propos d‚ÄôAphrodite Ourania et Pand√©mos √† Ath√®nes.\\" AntCl 57 (1980::142-57) p. 413. and also Demeter: Artemidorus asserts that in interpreting dreams \\"a myrtle garland signifies the same as an olive garland, except that it is especially auspicious for farmers because of Demeter and for women because of Aphrodite. For the plant is sacred to both goddesses.\\"Artemidorus, Oneirocritica, I.77. (translation by Hugh G. Evelyn-White). Pausanias explains that one of the Graces in the sanctuary at Elis holds a myrtle branch because \\"the rose and the myrtle are sacred to Aphrodite and connected with the story of Adonis, while the Graces are of all deities the nearest related to Aphrodite.\\" Myrtle is the garland of Iacchus, according to Aristophanes,Aristophanes, The Frogs, the Iacchus chorus, 330ff. and of the victors at the Theban Iolaea, held in honour of the Theban hero Iolaus.Pindar, Isthmian Ode IV. In Rome, Virgil explains that \\"the poplar is most dear to Alcides, the vine to Bacchus, the myrtle to lovely Venus, and his own laurel to Phoebus.\\"Virgil, Eclogue VII.61-63. At the Veneralia, women bathed wearing crowns woven of myrtle branches, and myrtle was used in wedding rituals. In the Aeneid, myrtle marks the grave of the murdered Polydorus in Thrace. Aeneas' attempts to uproot the shrub cause the ground to bleed, and the voice of the dead Polydorus warns him to leave. The spears which impaled Polydorus have been magically transformed into the myrtle which marks his grave.Aeneid III, 19-68, accessed 13 March 2014 =Jewish= In Jewish liturgy, the myrtle is one of the four sacred plants (Four Species) of Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles representing the different types of personality making up the community. The myrtle having fragrance but not pleasant taste, represents those who have good deeds to their credit despite not having knowledge from Torah study. The three branches are lashed or braided together by the worshipers a palm leaf, a willow bough, and a myrtle branch. The etrog or citron is the fruit held in the other hand as part of the lulav wave ritual. In Jewish mysticism, the myrtle represents the phallic, masculine force at work in the universe. For this reason myrtle branches were sometimes given the bridegroom as he entered the nuptial chamber after a wedding (Tos. Sotah 15:8; Ketubot 17a). Myrtles are both the symbol and scent of Eden (BhM II: 52; Sefer ha-Hezyonot 17). The Hechalot text Merkavah Rabbah requires one to suck on a myrtle leaves as an element of a theurgic ritual. Kabbalists link myrtle to the sefirah of Tiferet and use sprigs in their Shabbat (especially Havdalah) rites to draw down its harmonizing power as the week is initiated (Shab. 33a; Zohar Chadash, SoS, 64d; Sha‚Äôar ha-Kavvanot, 2, pp. 73‚Äì76).List of plants in the Bible Myrtle leaves were added to the water in the last (7th) rinsing of the head in the traditional Sephardic tahara manual (teaching the ritual for washing the dead).Service for Preparing the Dead for Burial, as Used in the Spanish and Portuguese Congregation, Shearith Israel, NY City, Published by the Society \\"Hebra Hased ba'Amet\\", New York, 1913, available at www.Jewish-Funerals.org Myrtles are often used to recite a blessing over a fragrant plant during the Havdalah ceremony, as well as before Kiddush is some Sefardic and Hasidic traditions. =Contemporary= In neo- pagan and wicca rituals, myrtle, though not indigenous beyond the Mediterranean Basin, is now commonly associated with and sacred to Beltane (May Day). Myrtle in a wedding bouquet is a general European custom.Marcel De Cleene, Marie Claire Lejeune, eds. Compendium of symbolic and ritual plants in Europe Volume 1, 2003:444. A sprig of myrtle from Queen Victoria's wedding bouquet was planted as a slip,\\"in a churchyard at Cowes, on the Isle of Wight\\" according to Vivian A. Rich, Cursing the Basil: And Other Folklore of the Garden 1998:18. and sprigs from it have continually been included in royal wedding bouquets. Garden history M. communis ssp. tarentina cv. 'compacta' in the garden Rome Because of its elegance of habit, appealing odour, and amenity to clipping by the topiarius, as much as for sacred associations, the myrtle was an indispensable feature of Roman gardens. As a reminder of home, it will have been introduced wherever Roman elites were settled, even in areas of the Mediterranean Basin where it was not already endemic: \\"the Romans... must surely have attempted to establish a shrub so closely associated with their mythology and tradition,\\" observes Alice Coats.Alice M. Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their Histories (1964) 1992, s.v. \\"Myrtus\\". In Gaul and Britannia it will not have proved hardy. England In England it was reintroduced in the 16th century, traditionally with the return from Spain in 1585 of Sir Walter Raleigh, who also brought with him the first orange trees seen in England. Myrtus communis will have needed similar protection from winter cold and wet. Alice CoatsCoats (1964) 1992. notes an earlier testimony: in 1562 Queen Elizabeth I's great minister Lord Burghley wrote to Mr Windebank in Paris to ask him for a lemon, a pomegranate and a myrtle, with instructions for their culture‚Äîwhich suggests that the myrtle, like the others, was not yet familiar. By 1597 John Gerard lists six varieties being grown in southern England,Gerard, The Herball, 1597. and by 1640 John Parkinson noted a double- flowering one. Alice Coats suggests that this was the very same double that the diarist and gardener John Evelyn noted \\"was first discovered by the incomparable Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, which a mule had cropt from a wild shrub.\\" In the late 17th and early 18th centuries myrtles in cases, pots and tubs were brought out to summer in the garden and wintered with other tender greens in an orangery. Fairchild, The City Gardener (1722) notes their temporary use, rented from a nurseryman annually to fill an empty fireplace in the warm months. With the influx to England of more dramatic tender plants and shrubs from Japan or Peru in the 19th century, it was more difficult to find room for the common myrtle of borderline hardiness. Related plants Many other related plants native to South America, New Zealand and elsewhere, previously classified in a wider interpretation of the genus Myrtus, are now species within other genera, including: Eugenia, Lophomyrtus, Luma, Rhodomyrtus, Syzygium, Ugni, and at least a dozen other genera. The name \\"myrtle\\" is also used in common names (vernacular names) of unrelated plants in several other genera, such as: \\"Crepe myrtle\\" (Lagerstroemia species and hybrids, Lythraceae); \\"Wax myrtle\\" (Morella species, Myricaceae); and \\"Creeping myrtle\\" (Vinca species, Apocynaceae).

Founded in 1887, the school was initially established in Chicago as the all- boys St. Procopius College and Academy by Benedictine monks, who also operated the St. Joseph Bohemian Orphanage. In 1898, the orphanage moved to Lisle, about west of Chicago, to be joined by St. Procopius three years later. In 1926, Benedictine nuns constructed the all-girls Sacred Heart Academy near the orphanage and school in Lisle. The orphanage closed in 1956 to make room for St. Procopius Academy, which separated from the college in 1957. Due to rising costs and waning enrollment, Sacred Heart merged with St. Procopius Academy in 1967 to form Benet Academy on the St. Procopius campus. Since then, numerous building projects have been undertaken to expand Benet's athletics, music, and science programs. As of 2017 it is considered the second best Catholic high school in Illinois, and seventh best private high school. Admission is competitive and relies primarily on test scores. All students complete a college-preparatory curriculum and may earn college credit through programs including Advanced Placement. As of 2009, Benet's average ACT test score regularly exceeds state and national averages, and more than 99 percent of students go on to college after graduation. The school's academic program has been featured in reports by the Chicago Sun-Times and U.S. News & World Report. The athletic program has fielded several teams that have placed fourth or higher in state tournaments. In the 2014‚Äì2015 school year the girls' volleyball team and the girls' basketball team both won IHSA state titles, which makes Benet only the second school in IHSA history and the first large (4A) school to win titles for both these sports in the same season. The boys' basketball team has broken two state records, including a 102 home-game winning streak. Other activities include the annual Christmas Drive fundraiser and over 30 clubs and organizations, including the Math Team and Science Olympiad team, both of which have won awards in their state tournaments. Benet's performing arts program stages an annual winter musical, while the band program performed in state-wide events in 1998 and 2002. Notable alumni of the school include NBA player Frank Kaminsky, Jim Ryan, and Grammy-winning singer Dave Bickler. History and facilities=Founding in Chicago Rev. John Nepomucene Jaeger, born in Kuttenberg, Bohemia (now Kutn√° Hora in the western Czech Republic) in 1844, championed founding a parochial school for the children of Chicago's Czech immigrants. In the aftermath of the Great Chicago Fire, Chicago's working-class Pilsen neighborhood, a predominantly Czech enclave, expanded quickly. To serve this growing ethnic population, St. Procopius parish was founded in the summer of 1875, near the intersection of 18th and Allport Streets. The parish was named for Saint Procopius of S√°zava, who founded a monastery in Bohemia in the eleventh century and became the first saint from Czechoslovakia. Vil√©m ƒåoka served as the first pastor. Planning to build a school, ƒåoka left it to the community to decide if the school would be secular or Catholic. They chose a Catholic school, despite the fact that only 25 percent of Pilsen's Czech population was Catholic. As the parish outgrew his capacity to serve them, ƒåoka turned for help to the Order of St. Benedict. Rev. John Nepomucene Jaeger, the first Bohemian abbot in the United States, was urged to establish a monastic community to teach at parochial schools in Bohemian as well as English. He founded St. Procopius priory in 1885. The priory took control of St. Procopius parish in January 1886, and Jaeger became the pastor. Jaeger also founded a convent in 1895, consisting of nuns brought from St. Mary's Convent in Pittsburgh and headed by Jaeger's biological sister, Mother Mary Nepomucene Jaeger. The Czech-American media had pushed for a convent to prepare Czech-speaking nuns for teaching positions in Czech parochial schools, which had previously hired mostly lay teachers trained in Austrian normal schools. The nuns were transferred from Pittsburgh to St. Scholastica's Convent on Chicago's north side, but later that same year moved to an old parish building at Ashland and 19th Streets, where they would remain until 1912. A section of the convent was converted into a music school. Graduates taught in parishes throughout the nation. The priory was elevated to the status of abbey by Pope Leo XIII in 1894, and the monks founded a school for lay monks to help build a self-sustaining source of revenue. Failing to attract a single prospective applicant in over seven years, they expanded enrollment to students with no intention of joining the clergy. The two groups would eventually be taught separately, and the monastic students were trained to become priests fluent in Bohemian, German, and English and prepared to preach to ethnically diverse congregations. Lay students were trained for employment in the business world. In 1900, Chicago had one of the largest Czech populations of any city in the world, with approximately 75,000‚Äì100,000 Czechs living in the city's 10 Czech communities. Some 50,000 Czech immigrants were served by the three Czech parishes of Chicago‚Äî16,000 to 20,000 of them by St. Procopius. These Czech immigrants wanted to assimilate into American society, but also wanted to pass their language on to their children. The abbey established St. Procopius College and Academy in 1887 as a school that taught men of Czech and Slovak descent. It became the first Czech institution of higher learning in the nation, and in 1920 it remained the only Czech college. Rev. Procopius Neuzil was named the first teacher and director. Classes began on March 2, 1887, when Neuzil taught a remedial course to two students in two small rooms at 704 Allport Street. Enrollment grew to 20 within the week, taught by three instructors during the four-month term. The first full year of classes began in the fall of 1887. The college was chartered by the State of Illinois in 1890; only a two-year high school program was offered at the time. In 1893 the college published its first catalog, which urged Czech parents to enroll their 13-year-old boys. The academic curriculum included a preparatory year to teach elementary school subjects to remedial students. The two high school years were referred to as \\"Latin years\\", and included required courses in Czech, English, Latin, math, orthography, history, and religion; optional courses included German and bookkeeping. Following the Latin years, students were enrolled in the business course, which included math, bookkeeping, economics, composition, history, oratory, and religion. Orphanage Aerial view of the Benet campus, from the south, in 1984. Benet Academy was created from the merger of the St. Procopius Academy for boys and Sacred Heart Academy for girls in 1967. The Benet Academy campus in Lisle began as an orphanage. On March 14, 1899, the abbey founded St. Joseph's Orphanage on a farm in Lisle purchased from one Serafin Rott, and transferred 10 Czech orphans there from St. Hedwig's Polish Orphanage, which charged the parishes more for housing non-Polish orphans. It opened under the supervision of the Sisters of St. Benedict. Abbot Jaeger allowed the orphanage to use the land for free until more satisfactory housing could be constructed. The orphanage lacked stoves, fuel, adequate bedding, decent food, and any stable source of income. Neuzil, then editor-in-chief of the Czech Benedictine Press, raised $80,000 within 12 years from the generally impoverished Czech immigrant community through local publications. A new building was commissioned in 1899 to accommodate the increasing number of applicants for admission, including orphans from out-of-state. The new building was dedicated on July 2, 1900, at the same time as the cornerstone was laid for St. Procopius College, about away. Due to increasing applications for admission, still more space was required, and William Schwartz sold the abbey of land in Lisle. On July 16, 1911, a new building was dedicated on the grounds of what is now Benet Academy, the same day the cornerstone was laid for the nearby Sacred Heart Convent. A girls' dormitory building was built in 1923. It was later converted into classrooms and renamed Benet Hall). A power plant, a larger chapel, and additional classrooms were dedicated in 1926. A gym was built in 1936; at that time the facility housed approximately 400 orphans. Twenty-three headstones from that period can be found in a small cemetery on the northwest side of the school, where orphans as young as three, one of the workmen, and several former orphans who had been raised at St. Joseph are buried. According to school lore, ghosts of orphans still haunt the fourth floor of St. Joseph Hall and the basement of Benet Hall, where the nursery of the orphanage once was. Elementary schooling at the orphanage featured better equipped classrooms than the original building. A few years after operations moved in 1911, the school offered a two-year business program. By 1948 the orphanage comprised the Lisle Manual Training School for Boys and the Lisle Industrial School for Girls, both of which were managed by the Sisters of St. Benedict and run by the Archdiocese of Chicago. In the 1950s Petru Hall was built as an annex on the east side of the dormitory building. The archdiocese assumed control of the orphanage in 1920, and began accepting orphans from the Juvenile Court of Cook County, most of whom came from broken homes whose parents did not pay the fines imposed by the court. This discouraged donations and strained the orphanage financially. Archbishop Samuel Cardinal Stritch, discovering that only 12 of the 255 children were actually orphans and only five of them were Slavs, closed the orphanage in 1956. The 12 true orphans were moved to Holy Angels Orphanage in Des Plaines. Bishop of Joliet Martin Dewey McNamara gave the former orphanage buildings to St. Procopius Academy, which was at that time still combined with the college. College in Lisle St. Procopius College under construction on July 23, 1900. The mission of the college was \\"not only to train candidates for the priesthood, but give young men in general such an education as to prepare them to become leaders of their people in the various walks of life.\\" As enrollment increased to 46 in 1891, it became obvious that St. Procopius College's enrollment would soon outstrip its facilities in Pilsen. Neuzil was replaced as rector by Rev. Ildephonse Wittman, also a Benedictine, in 1894. In 1896, the Abbey bought a farm in Lisle from Morris Neff to provide more space and a \\"better atmosphere\\". On March 12, 1900, a new building was approved, to be built at the southwest corner of Maple and College Avenues. The groundbreaking was held on April 19, 1900, the school moved in May, and the new facility was dedicated on July 1, 1901, by Peter Muldoon, Bishop of the Diocese of Chicago. Classes began in September with six faculty and 11 students. Atheists in Chicago vehemently objected to the Catholic church-run school, but the Czech community came to the school's defense. Limited financial aid for the generally poor Czech immigrants led to meager enrollment. Attendance grew from 13 in 1901 to 100 in 1908. The academy offered its first four-year high school program in 1904, with both \\"classical\\", or college-preparatory, and \\"commercial\\", or vocational, programs. Students enrolled in the commercial track studied for three years, the first two being identical to the classical track and the third consisting of specialized coursework. The commercial program was dropped in 1915. Tuition for a semester cost $80; it was increased to $100 in 1909. As of 1921, the school enrolled only men of Bohemian or Slovak ancestry. Income and enrollment fell during the Great Depression. Between 1917 and 1930, enrollment fell from 205 students to 140. The school sought accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, but the application was denied because the college and academy could not be accredited as a single institution, and financial constraints prevented their separation. In 1932 the abbey and the school lost most of their money when the Kaspar American Bank in Chicago failed. Academic programs and student activities were not greatly affected, in part because the faculty was mainly clergymen, who were not highly paid. Still unaccredited, the school was certified by the state of Illinois in September 1934. Students, faculty, and clergymen sustained themselves with food produced on the Abbey Farm, which they maintained until the 1970s. Approximately 1,500 chickens provided eggs, while Brown Swiss cattle provided milk. Meat came from the farm's supply of bulls, hogs, and heifers. Bee hives produced honey and wax, while a cannery produced more than of food products. World War II caused enrollment to decline and the student body consisted mainly of high school students and seminarians. Following the war, new students enrolled, and the school built a temporary facility in 1947 to accommodate them. Students from Illinois began to replace out-of-state students, the percentage of day, or commuting, students rose, and the school employed more lay teachers. After the war, the previously ethnic Czech college acquired a more diverse student body, due to rising enrollment caused by the G.I. Bill. By 1947 the high school enrolled 30 students. Better times and higher birth rates led to growing enrollment at St. Procopius in the 1950s and 1960s. With the gift of the former orphanage facility, the academy began to operate independently from the college in 1957. It was accredited on March 28, 1958. St. Procopius College was renamed Illinois Benedictine College in 1971, and Benedictine University in 1996. Under the leadership of its first principal, Rev. Thomas J. Havlik, the academy added new classrooms and St. Martin Hall to its facilities. Convent in Lisle The Benedictine Convent and Normal School in Lisle, one-fourth complete, in 1913. Sacred Heart Academy was founded here in 1926. By 1912, the community of nuns had outgrown their convent in Chicago, and relocated to the new Convent of the Sacred Heart in Lisle. They had prospered there as a teaching order educating Slovak-speaking nuns and organized two Slovak schools. In 1926, under the leadership of Mother Mary Genevieve, the convent founded a day and boarding high school for girls‚Äîthe Sacred Heart Academy. The academy outgrew its space and in 1929 the convent was expanded to accommodate rising enrollment. The annexed facilities reserved for the school included a Renaissance-style chapel, an auditorium, and a gymnasium. The Academy was later expanded to include the Jaeger Junior College. The academy was primarily a boarding school. Students came from Illinois, the surrounding states, Texas, and Mexico. A few day students came from the Lisle area. In 1947 enrollment averaged 75 students. Enrollment grew from 120 in 1953 to 300 in 1958, and remained at that level until 1966. Day student enrollment also grew and in 1962 the academy stopped accepting boarding school students. By 1964, the last year in which boarding school students were enrolled, alumni had hailed from all US states, South America, France, Mexico, and Guam. Day students from 1964 to 1968 came from Lisle and the neighboring communities. Unlike St. Procopius Academy, Sacred Heart Academy offered a business curriculum from 1953 to 1966. Courses included shorthand, typewriting, and bookkeeping. The students and nuns were supplied with food by the convent's Benedale Farm. Cattle provided both dairy products and meat, while poultry provided eggs and their feathers were used to stuff pillows as another source of income. The nuns also raised rabbits and bees, and grew grain, hay, vegetables, grapes, and apples. The farm was closed in the late 1950s for financial reasons and the convent sold most of the land so a school could be built for the growing village of Lisle. Merger and expansion Map of the Benet Academy campus. Founded as an orphanage in 1910, the campus has been steadily expanded since. A Science and Activity Center was added in 2009. In the 1960s, St. Procopius Academy faced dwindling enrollment and funding. The Benedictines threatened to close the boys' school, but were dissuaded by Abbot Daniel W. Kucera, who had graduated from St. Procopius in 1941. Under Abbot Kucera's leadership, St. Procopius Academy and Sacred Heart Academy merged to form Benet (an anglicized form of \\"Benedict\\") Academy in 1967, on the former St. Procopius campus. Enrollment in 1968 was at 875 students, including 575 boys and 300 girls. The business education program from Sacred Heart was continued at the new school; three teachers taught courses in consumer economics, typewriting, shorthand, and bookkeeping. St. Thomas Hall, funded by a private donor, was erected to house a library and physical sciences facilities in 1975. A major construction project was launched in 1993, in response to increasing enrollment and a growing athletic program. The $5 million building plan included a new 1,800-seat gymnasium, a new boiler system and a new roof for the cafeteria and the existing gymnasium. New parking areas were planned and St. Mary's Hall was to be demolished. Neighborhood residents, concerned about the impact on property values, traffic, and aesthetics, opposed the project. The Lisle Village Board blocked construction, charging that Benet had not notified the local community of the pending construction, to which Benet replied that \\"the school was there prior to the homes being constructed\\". The plan was approved in April, but the Board designated the entire campus a \\"planned-unit development\\", requiring Board approval for all future modifications. The new facilities included zoned lighting areas, which allowed for multipurpose use for assemblies, performances, sporting events, and graduation ceremonies. Construction was completed in May 1994, and applications increased in the years that followed. The gym was later named as the St. Ronald Gymnasium to honor former principal Rev. Ronald Rigovsky. In June 2000, a need for more performance space became apparent; the school's music groups used small, crowded rehearsal rooms and drama students performed in the old chapel or across the street at Sacred Heart Monastery. Benet began construction of a new performing arts center at the east end of the campus to replace the 190-seat Assembly Hall on the third floor of St. Joseph Hall, originally a chapel for the St. Joseph Bohemian Orphanage. As part of the project, the room was converted back into a chapel, named the Chapel of St. Therese. Petru Hall, which was used for the annual school auction after the orphans left, was demolished to make way for the new performing arts center, named St. Daniel Hall, after Abbot Daniel Kucera and Saint Daniel. Constructed of brick and pre-cast concrete, the design includes arched entrances to match the other buildings on campus. The facility features a 369-seat auditorium, an outdoor theater complex, a rehearsal room for bands and choirs, a set-construction area, and storage areas. In addition to plays and concerts, St. Daniel Hall is also used for assemblies, lectures, and masses, which had previously been held in the gymnasium. In May 2007, the school broke ground on a new $16 million science and student activity center. The building includes extra corridors to ease hall traffic, a larger cafeteria, and additional storage space, along with four combination classrooms and laboratories for biology and earth science, three chemistry classrooms, and two chemistry labs. Admissions Admission is competitive and primarily based on the High School Placement Test, a standardized test by Scholastic Testing Service, taken in January of applicants' eighth grade year (around age 13). According to the Daily Herald, schools like Benet hope to accept the top 40 percent of students taking the exam. Seventh grade (around age 12) transcripts and a student essay are also factors in admission. In 2003‚Äì04, 600 students applied for admission, 387 were accepted, and 338 enrolled. As of the years 2013-2018 3 out of 4 students (75%) were accepted. Preference is given to siblings of current or former Benet students. In 1993 the average admitted eighth grader scored in the 87th percentile on the placement test. Applicants without siblings at the school were admitted only with scores above the 75th percentile; applicants with siblings at Benet were admitted with scores as low as the 50th percentile on a case-by-case basis. Academics Benet is owned and operated by the St. Procopius Abbey and many of the Benedictine community's monks have taught at the school, as seen here in 1984 As of the 2009‚Äì10 school year, students are required to complete 23 Carnegie units of a college-preparatory curriculum to graduate, including 4 units of English, 2 units of foreign language, 3 units of math, 1 unit of world history, 1 unit of US history, 3 units of lab science, 4 units of religion, 1.5 units of physical education, and 5 five units of electives. Spanish, French, German, and Latin are offered as foreign languages. Every summer since 1997, an English teacher has offered a one-week summer course in writing and photography. The school offers neither vocational nor remedial courses. College credit is available through participation in 11 Advanced Placement courses; the Program for Advanced College Credit (PACC) offered through St. Mary's University of Minnesota, which offers advanced courses in English, math, government, and history; and the Benedictine University Future Scholars Program, which offers college-level work in multivariable calculus and finite mathematics. The Chicago Sun-Times ranked Benet one of the top ten high schools in the Chicago area in 2003, based on graduate enrollment rates at four-year colleges and test scores over a four-year period. In 1999 Benet was also one of two high schools in DuPage County, and 100 high schools nationwide, featured as an \\"Outstanding American High School\\" by U.S. News & World Report. The study, conducted in conjunction with the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, identified schools \\"where students progress steadily toward high academic standards and where every student matters.\\" Benet has credited the school's academic success to Rev. Ronald Rigovsky, who served as principal for 23 years and as president from 1987 to 1992. During his tenure, said the Chicago Tribune, Rigovsky developed the school into \\"one of the highest scoring and most scholastically respected high schools in the Chicago area.\\" Benet Academy is accredited by the AdvancED commission, the Illinois State Board of Education, and the National Catholic Educational Association. Students and faculty Benet draws students from across the western Chicago suburbs. Almost all Roman Catholic, over 99% continue on to college. Benet enrolled 1,333 students in 2009‚Äì10. Most students come from Catholic families with professional and college-educated parents. In 2003‚Äì04, 97 percent of students were Roman Catholic; two percent received financial aid, which totaled $3,000. Tuition was $6,000. The average class size was 27 students. Most students come from Lisle, Downers Grove, and Naperville, but students in the class of 2013 came from 65 different schools and 34 different municipalities in DuPage and surrounding counties. The Benet graduating class of 2010 achieved an average composite score of 28.4 (above the 92nd percentile) on the ACT, a standardized college admission test, which was the seventh straight year average score topped 28, compared to a statewide average of 20.7 and national average of 21.0. Over 42 percent of the class had a score of 30 (above the 96th percentile) or higher. In 2000, Benet outscored all DuPage County high schools, which then-Principal Ernest Stark attributed to its closed campus policy, silent study halls, and \\"more focused\\" and \\"not very fancy\\" curriculum. In 1993, Benet's average ACT score exceeded those of 195 public high schools in northern Illinois, second only to the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, a selective residential school for gifted students. In 2008, Benet had nine National Merit Semi-Finalists, 34 National Merit Commended Scholars, and 5 National Merit Hispanic Scholars in the National Merit Scholarship Program and 137 students were named Illinois State Scholars, an honor awarded to top ten percent of seniors in the state and based on test scores, class rank, or both. In 2010, 332 students took Advanced Placement exams and 86 percent of them scored at least a three out of five. Two National AP Scholar awards were granted to students who averaged a 4 on all exams taken and received at least a 4 on eight or more exams, 28 AP Scholar with Distinction awards were granted to students who averaged at least 3.5 on all exams taken and scored at least a 3 on five or more exams, 51 AP Scholar awards were granted to students who scored at least a 3 on three or more exams. 76 students received other AP Scholar awards. Benet does not report class rankings. More than 99 percent of Benet graduates go to college; roughly 1 percent serve in the military. Benet students were implicated in the University of Illinois clout scandal, in which some applicants were given preferential admission to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) despite having sub-par qualifications. The Chicago Tribune, investigating the scandal, reported that a majority of students who were admitted to UIUC through political favors came from elite, affluent high schools such as Benet, where families were politically connected with elected officials and university trustees. An email between admissions officers revealed that a female Benet student was admitted to the university's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, despite the fact that she had ranked lower than 27 of her classmates who were put on a waiting list or denied admission. Between 2005 and 2009, thirteen applicants from Benet were alleged to have had political connections; eight of them were admitted to UIUC. In 2010 Benet employed 76 faculty, 26 of whom were alumni of the school. The average tenure was 17.6 years; 25 current or former faculty members served for 25 years or more. Tim White, an English teacher, completed his 50th consecutive year of teaching at Benet in the 2008‚Äì09 school year and was featured in an ABC 7 News segment entitled \\"Someone You Should Know\\". Activities=Sports The Benet Academy Marching Redwings, Color Guard, and Avions perform before a football game at Benedictine University The St. Procopius Academy football team played its first game against Downers Grove High School on Thanksgiving Day, 1917. At first some faculty members did not approve of American football, but it became respected on campus in the 1920s under the direction of Rev. Benedict Bauer. Bauer served as Athletic Director until 1927 while also coaching basketball, baseball, and football, and planned the construction of a new gymnasium in 1925. The college's varsity baseball team won conference championships in 1924 and 1925, and the football team defeated the University of Notre Dame freshman team in 1925. Benet competes in the East Suburban Catholic Conference (ESCC), part of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). The school sponsors teams, named the Benet Academy Redwings, for men and women in basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, volleyball, and bass fishing. Only men compete in baseball, football, and ice hockey. Only women compete in cheerleading and softball. Since 1978, Benet has placed in the top four at least once in state tournaments in basketball, cross country, football, soccer, and tennis. In 2000-01 and 2001-02 seasons the boys' soccer team were state champions, and in 2000 they were ranked 11th in the nation. In 2008‚Äì09, the girls' volleyball team finished second in the state. In November 2010 six student-athletes signed letters of intent to play at NCAA Division I universities. The school's boys' basketball team was also ranked sixth in the nation in February 2011 by USA Today. In 2014 the basketball team finished second in state.url=http://www.ihsa.org/SportsActivities/BoysBasketball.aspx Benet's boys' basketball team has set several state records, including a 102 home-game winning streak between November 26, 1975 and January 24, 1987. The streak ended when Benet lost to Naperville North High School, 47‚Äì46. The team compiled a 96 game in-conference winning streak from January 21, 1977, to February 24, 1984. The team recorded twelve consecutive seasons with at least 20 wins from 1975 to 1987, tied for the ninth longest streak in state history. The basketball team honors these school records by playing one home game each year in the Alumni Gym, where the streaks were recorded. Benet's chess team, founded in 2012, has won every Far Side Suburban Chess Conference championship since the team's inception. In 2014 the chess team took 2nd place at the IHSA state tournament.url =http://staff.imsa.edu/~dporzio/FSSChist.html Performing arts The Benet Academy Marching Redwings performing in the Naperville Last Fling Parade in 2008 The theater department has staged annual musicals since 1997. Shows have included 42nd Street, Bye Bye Birdie, Guys and Dolls, Hello, Dolly!, and Pippin. In 2000, the department began depicting works that were \\"not quite so fluffy and light\\", including Children of Eden, West Side Story, Fiddler on the Roof, The Pirates of Penzance, and Into the Woods. In 2006, the department celebrated its tenth anniversary of musical performances with a production of The Music Man. Benet's band program, practically nonexistent in the late 1950s, was revitalized by director Andy Marchese in the mid-1960s, who introduced new uniforms, regularly scheduled concerts, and marching band trophies. Participation in the marching band also increased after the school became coeducational, since there were more musicians willing to play instruments male students saw as feminine. Out of 1,275 students at Benet in 1999‚Äì00, 130 were choir students and 115 were band students. Instrumental groups include two concert bands, a percussion ensemble, three jazz bands, a marching band, a pep band, and a string orchestra. In 1998 the pep band was one of eight schools chosen from a pool of 58 to perform at the state basketball tournament. In 2002, the school's symphonic band was one of three high school bands invited to play at the Illinois Music Educators Association All-State Conference in Peoria. Vocal music groups include five choirs, one of which is a student-led mass choir that participates in school liturgies. Student organizations Members of the Benet Science Alliance team display their awards after the state Illinois Science Olympiad tournament in 2010 Student clubs and organizations include the National Honor Society and Model United Nations, and a Campus Ministry geared towards fostering the students' Catholic faith. Campus Ministry assists in coordinating several three-day retreats held throughout the year, through which students are encouraged to reexamine their faith. Club activities include the Outreach Society service organization, Medical Club, and foreign language clubs. Student Government, in addition to coordinating the Christmas Drive, organizes student activities like prom, film festivals, and male beauty contests. Benet's Math Team finished in the top ten of its division each year from 2004 through 2015 in the state math competition sponsored by the Illinois Council of Teachers of Mathematics, coming in first in 2005 and 2012. Benet's Science Olympiad team won second place in its division at the state tournaments in 2008 and 2010. In February 2010, the Law Club participated in its first mock trial, sponsored by the Illinois State Bar Association, which is expected to become an annual event. Christmas Drive The annual Christmas Drive takes place in December, during the two weeks prior to Christmas vacation. The fundraiser is a school-wide effort, jointly coordinated by Student Government, National Honor Society, and the Outreach Society. The fundraising efforts are varied and creative; boys donate money to remain unshaven (a violation of school policy), the National Honor Society sells baked goods, the Mother's Club serves breakfast, and each class competes to gather the most pennies in the school-wide \\"penny wars.\\" The Christmas Drive was featured in the cover story of the December 2010 issue of Christ is our Hope, the official magazine of the Diocese of Joliet. In the previous year the school had raised $54,500. The money was used to support a mission trip in Appalachia, and also to provide food, school supplies, blankets, and gifts to local families in the Chicago area. In 2010, the student body raised $66,200. The record was set in 2017, when the school community raised $100,000.

The program was originally established as an effort to raise awareness of the Government of Canada's contributions to Quebec industries and other activities in order to counter the actions of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois government of the province that worked to promote Quebec independence. The program ran from 1996 until 2004, when broad corruption was discovered in its operations and the program was discontinued. Illicit and even illegal activities within the administration of the program were revealed, involving misuse and misdirection of public funds intended for government advertising in Quebec. Such misdirections included sponsorship money awarded to Liberal Party-linked ad firms in return for little or no work, in which firms maintained Liberal organizers or fundraisers on their payrolls or donated back part of the money to the Liberal Party. The resulting investigations and scandal affected the Liberal Party of Canada and the then-government of Prime Minister Paul Martin. It was an ongoing affair for years, but rose to national prominence in early 2004 after the program was examined by Sheila Fraser, the federal auditor general. Here are some of the major findings reported by Auditor General Sheila Fraser: * More than $100 million was paid to various communications agencies in the form of fees and commissions; In most cases the agencies did little more than hand over the cheques. * The sponsorship program was designed to generate commissions for private companies, while hiding the source of the funding, rather than providing any benefit for Canadians. Fraser said, \\"I think this is such a blatant misuse of public funds that it is shocking. I am actually appalled by what we've found.\\" Fraser's revelations led to the Martin government establishing the Gomery Commission to conduct a public inquiry and file a report on the matter. The official title of this inquiry was the Commission of Inquiry into the Sponsorship Program and Advertising Activities; it is commonly referred to as the \\"Gomery Report\\". In the end, the Commission concluded that $2 million was awarded in contracts without a proper bidding system, $250,000 was added to one contract price for no additional work, and $1.5 million was awarded for work that was never done, of which $1.14 million was repaid. The Commission found that a number of rules in the Financial Administration Act were broken. The overall operating cost of the Commission was $14 million.CBC.ca News Indepth: Federal Sponsorship Scandal In the national spotlight, the scandal became a significant factor in the lead-up to the 2006 federal election when, after more than twelve years in power, the Liberals were defeated by the Conservatives, who formed a minority government that was sworn in February 2006.  Involved parties  * Jean Chr√©tien - Prime Minister of Canada at the time the Sponsorship Program was established and operated. The Gomery Commission, First Phase Report which assigned blame for the Sponsorship scandal cast most of the indemnity for misspent public funds and fraud on Chr√©tien and his Prime Minister's Office (PMO) staff, though it cleared Chr√©tien himself of direct wrongdoing. On June 26, 2008, the Federal Court quashed the Gomery inquiry's conclusions that Chr√©tien and Pelletier bore responsibility for the sponsorship scandal. This decision was later upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal. * Chuck Guit√© - bureaucrat in charge of the sponsorship program. Arrested for fraud by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) - convicted on five counts on June 6, 2006. * Jean Pelletier - Chr√©tien's chief of staff 1990-2001 and chairman of Via Rail 2001-2004. Pelletier served as Chief of Staff at the PMO between 1993-2001. Guit√© testified that he regularly received instructions from Pelletier during his time at the PMO about what programs to spend sponsorship money on and how much, a claim that Justice Gomery found to be truthful. Via Rail was accused of mishandling sponsorship deals, though mostly not under Pelletier's tenure. * Alfonso Gagliano - Minister of Public Works between 1997-2002, and thus in charge of the program. Also the Quebec lieutenant between 1999-2002, making him in charge of Liberal Party operations in Quebec. * Andr√© Ouellet - member of Prime Minister Chr√©tien's Cabinet, longtime Liberal politician and later head of Canada Post, who was also accused of violating sponsorship rules. * Jean Carle - Long-time close associate of Chr√©tien's going back to the 1980s, and generally viewed as Chr√©tien's \\"surrogate son\\".Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties: The Liberal Party of Canada, 1984 - 2008, Toronto: University of Toronto Press page 198. Carle served as the chief of operations at the PMO between 1993-1998 and as a senior executive at the Crown-owned Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) between 1998-2001. Guit√© testified that besides for Pelletier that he sometimes also received his orders from Carle during his time at the PMO. During his time at the BDC, Carle testified at the Gomery commission that he created a $125,000 phony paper trail to hide a sponsorship deal, a tactic that Gomery compared to money laundering. * Jean Brault - head of Groupaction Marketing, one of the companies to which deals were directed. Arrested for fraud by the RCMP, he pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud and on May 5, 2006, was sentenced to 30 months in prison. * Jacques Corriveau - Liberal organizer and head of Pluridesign to which millions in sponsorship dollars were directed. * Paul Martin - former Prime Minister of Canada. He was Minister of Finance, and Senior Minister from Quebec during most of the years the program occurred. When he became Prime Minister in December 2003, he claimed that he put a halt to it. He also set up the Gomery Commission which later cleared him of formal responsibility by Justice Gomery in his November 2005 'First Phase Report' of the Gomery Commission. The Gomery findings found that Martin, as finance minister, established a 'fiscal framework' but he did not have oversight as to the dispersal of the funds once they were apportioned to Chr√©tien's Prime Minister's Office. A report on the issue by the Auditor General's Office of Sheila Fraser came to the same conclusion. Nonetheless, Martin was accused of tying Gomery's hands and using the sponsorship scandal as an excuse to purge the Liberals of members who supported Chr√©tien. The scandal played a factor in the federal election of 2006 and the fall of the Liberal Government. Shortly thereafter, Martin resigned from the liberal party leadership. * Joe Morselli - Liberal Party fundraiser. Jean Brault testified that the money exchanges were with Morselli. * Jean Lafleur - former CEO of Lafleur Communication Marketing Inc. One of the advertising executives that accepted money from the federal government. Pleaded guilty to 28 counts of fraud. * Allan Cutler - former civil servant and whistleblower who reported anomalies in the Canadian sponsorship program, triggering the Scandal.  Timeline = 1995  * Allan Cutler first attempts to raise concerns about bid-rigging and political interference to the attention of senior management at the Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada.  1996  * Ernst & Young conducts an audit of contracting and tendering practices. The initial draft, which identified recurring problems and the risk of legal action, was altered in the final report. Ernst & Young representative Deanne Monaghan later indicated that she did not recall why the report had been changed to remove those references.CBC.ca News Indepth: Federal Sponsorship Scandal  2000  * February - An internal audit reveals that none of the recommendations of the 1996 Ernst & Young audit have been implemented. * September - Minister Alfonso Gagliano receives the 2000 audit and suspends the Sponsorship Program.

The claim is the first direct link between the scandal and the Prime Minister's Office. Coderre and LeFran√ßois denied the allegation.Toronto Star article * March 18 - Gagliano testifies in front of the Public Accounts Committee, a committee of the House of Commons chaired by a member from the Official Opposition. Gagliano denies any involvement by himself or any other politician; he points blame at bureaucrat Chuck Guit√©. * March 24 - Myriam B√©dard testifies at the Public Accounts Committee. In addition to repeating her earlier assertions, she also claims that Formula One driver Jacques Villeneuve was given a secret $12 million payoff to wear a Canadian flag logo on his racing suit (however, Villeneuve sharply denies this allegation, calling it \\"ludicrous\\"). B√©dard also testifies that she once heard that Groupaction was involved in drug trafficking. * April 2 - Previously confidential testimony from a 2002 inquiry into suspicious Groupaction contracts is made public. In it, Guit√© admits to having bent the rules in his handling of the advertising contracts but defends his actions as excusable given the circumstances, saying, \\"We were basically at war trying to save the country... When you're at war, you drop the book and the rules and you don't give your plan to the opposition.\\"Globe and Mail insider edition article * April 22 - Guit√© testifies. He claims Auditor-General Fraser is misguided in delivering the report, as it distorts what actually went on; he claims the office of then-Finance Minister Paul Martin lobbied for input in the choice of firms given contracts; and he denies that any political interference occurred, because his bureaucratic office made all final decisions. Opposition MPs decry his comments as \\"nonsense\\" and claim he is covering up for the government.Toronto Star article The French language press gives a very different account of Guit√©'s testimony; a La Presse headline states that Guit√© is involving the Cabinet office of Paul Martin.Cyberpresse article * May 6 - An official announces the inquiry deadline is set for December 2005. * May 10 - Jean Brault, president of Groupaction, and Charles Guit√© arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police for fraud in connection with the sponsorship scandal. * May 23 - Paul Martin requests that the Governor General dissolve Parliament and call a federal election. * May 28 - Alfonso Gagliano launches a lawsuit for $4.5 million against Prime Minister Paul Martin and the federal government for defamation and wrongful dismissal claiming that he has been unfairly made to pay for the sponsorship scandal. * June 28 - The Liberals win 135 of 308 seats in the 2004 election, forming the first minority government in almost 25 years. * September - First public hearings of the Commission of Inquiry into the Sponsorship Program and Advertising Activities begin in Ottawa. They will move to Montreal in February 2005 and conclude in the Spring. * December - In a year-end media interview, Justice John Gomery refers to Chr√©tien's distribution of autographed golf balls as \\"small-town cheap\\", which later prompts an indignant response from the former prime minister.  2005  * March 29 - A publication ban is imposed by the Gomery commission on Jean Brault's testimony. * April 2 - The United States blogger Ed Morrissey of Captain's QuartersCaptain's Quarters posting discloses information about Brault's testimony, countervening the Canadian publication ban. Until the revocation of the ban five days later, the publication itself was a news event in Canada, with Canadian news media struggling to report on the disclosure without putting themselves at risk of legal action.Edmonton Sun article * April 7 - The publication ban on Jean Brault's testimony is lifted by the Gomery commission. Brault's testimony triggers a rapid shift in the public opinion of the Liberal Party. Whether or not the government is defeated in the imminent confidence vote, most political pundits predict an election call this year--many predicting by this summer. * April 20 - The official opposition party, the Conservatives, puts forward a non-confidence motion in the government. Due to procedural rules, this vote, which was to be held May 3, was postponed. If a non-confidence motion passes, the government will be dissolved and a new election will be held. * April 21 - A national televised appearance by Prime Minister Paul Martin discusses the scandal. This was highly unusual in Canadian politics. The Prime Minister announced that a general election will be called within 30 days of Justice Gomery's final report. Martin emphasised that he was trying to clean up the scandal and had not been involved. In the following rebuttal speeches, Jack Layton of the New Democratic Party offered to keep the parliament alive, provided the Liberal Party makes some major concessions in the budget in their favor. However, the other Opposition parties were still ready to bring down the government and force an election before the summer. * May 10 - The Conservatives and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois win a vote, by 153-150, in the House of Commons on what they argue is equivalent to a no confidence motion; three MPs are absent due to health reasons. The motion ordered a committee of the House of Commons to declare that the government should resign rather than being a direct motion on the House's confidence in the government. The opposition parties and several constitutional experts claim that the motion is binding and that the government must resign or immediately seek the confidence of the House; the government and several opposing constitutional experts suggest that this motion was merely procedural and therefore cannot be considered a matter of confidence. Ultimately, only the Governor General has the power to force an election, it is not clear what actions tradition would require her to take in such a case.CBC article: Liberals will not quit despite losing vote * May 11 - The government tells the House that it will consider a vote to be held on May 19 on the budget, including the concessions which the Liberal party ceded to the NDP in turn for their support on it, to be a matter of confidence. The government refuses to directly seek the confidence of the House and blocks the Opposition from putting any vote to the House; in consequence the Opposition continues a policy of non-cooperation and disruption of the other business of the House. * May 17 - Conservative MP Belinda Stronach crosses the floor to the Liberals and is simultaneously given the Cabinet position of Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development as well as made Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal. Prime Minister Paul Martin states that Stronach will be responsible for implementing the recommendations of the Gomery commission, a statement that Opposition critics claim casts doubt on the sincerity of the Prime Minister's promise for an election within 30 days of the tabling of Justice Gomery's report. For some time afterwards, media attention is focused away from Gomery testimony onto Stronach's move and its implications on the budget vote. * May 19 - The government passes the first of two budget bills easily after the Conservatives promise support, but the second bill with the NDP concessions ends as a cliffhanger. Speaker Peter Milliken breaks a 152-152 tie in favour of the bill, keeping the government alive. * November 1 - Gomery's preliminary report into the scandal is released. The report criticizes Chr√©tien and his office for setting up the sponsorship program in a way as to invite abuse, and Gagliano as the Minister of Public Works for his behaviour. Prime Minister Paul Martin is formally cleared of any responsibility or wrongdoing in the matter as Gomery found his role as Finance Minister was to set up a 'fiscal framework' at the instruction of then Prime Minister Chr√©tien, but did not have oversight on the spending of the funds after they were passed to Chr√©tien's Prime Minister's Office. Conservative leader Stephen Harper and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Gilles Duceppe announce their intention to try to force a pre-Christmas election; however, New Democrat leader Jack Layton says that he will try to have the Liberals implement some New Democrat policies, particularly with regard to a ban on private healthcare as the price for his support in keeping the government up. * November 28 - The Liberals refuse to agree to the New Democrats' terms and the latter withdraws their support. The Liberals also turn down a motion sponsored by the three opposition parties which would have scheduled a February election in return for passing several key pieces of legislation. As a result, the Liberal government loses a confidence vote in the House by 171 to 133, resulting in the fall of the minority government and triggering a mid- January election after a long holiday election campaign. 2006 * January 23 - After twelve consecutive years in power, the ruling Liberals are defeated in the general election. The Conservatives have enough seats to form a minority government. Paul Martin immediately announces that he will not contest the next federal election as party leader, and Bill Graham is appointed interim parliamentary leader. * February 1 - Justice John Gomery delivered his final report consisting mostly of recommendations for changes to the civil service and its relation to government. * February 6 - The new Conservative government, led by Stephen Harper, are sworn in as the new government in Canada. Stephen Harper becomes Canada's 22nd Prime Minister. * March 18 - Paul Martin resigns the leadership of the Liberal party, handing the post to Bill Graham for the interim. * May 5 - after pleading guilty to five counts of fraud, Jean Brault was sentenced to 30 months in prison. * May 11 - the Conservative government is reportedly preparing to file a lawsuit against the Liberal party.Government may sue Liberals for sponsorship funds: report * June 6 - Chuck Guit√© was convicted on five counts of defrauding the Government of Canada; on June 19, he was sentenced to 42 months in prison. 2007 * April 27 - Jean Lafleur, after returning from two years in Belize, pleaded guilty to 28 counts of fraud. He was sentenced to 42 months in prison, and was ordered to repay $1.6 million to the federal government.

It was first announced on the opening day of the 2004 Photo Marketing Association Annual Convention and Trade Show. As of that time, the C-8080 was set to be Olympus‚Äô first eight-megapixel digital camera for the high-end consumer market. Olympus set the camera's MSRP at $1,149 USD. One key feature that is described in the name is the optical zoom technique used in this camera. Most compact zoom cameras use the zoom functionality for telephoto work where one details in on a remote subject. This camera allows one to set up the lens to work as a wide-angle lens which comes in handy for group or landscape photography. It has a high resolution lens with 5x zoom (7.1 - 35.6 mm) - equals (28 ‚Äì 140 mm) in 35 mm film format - and an aperture of 2.4 for wide angle and 3.5 for telephoto. Focus range: normal 0.8 - inf.; macro 20 ‚Äì 80 cm ; super-macro up to 5 cm. The metering modes for exposure are: ESP, center- weighted, multi-metering and spot. The metering target mark on the screen can be moved in 13 positions in spot mode. For absolute control a live histogram can be activated and the histogram target mark can be placed in 10.000 different positions. An AEL button can lock the metered exposure. The camera has two sensors for AF: one is based on contrast detection, the other one on phase-difference detection (P-AF). The metering settings for the focus are: iESP, spot, full-time AF, P-AF and MF, macro and super-macro. The AF target mark can take 9 positions in spot mode. Movie clips: 640 x 480 and 320 x 240 both 15 frames per second. Length is only limited by the storage card. The camera accepts xD-Picture Cards (necessary for panorama shooting), CompactFlash type I and II and IBM microdrives with two slots. Copying to another slot is possible in the camera. Data storage is available in TIFF, RAW and JPEG format. Data transfer connectivity is USB 2.0. The 8080 has a 4.5 cm tilting sunshine-LCD of 134,000 pixels and the electronic viewfinder has 240,000 pixels. The C8080WZ was succeeded at least partially by the C7070WZ (2005) this being the continuation of the C5060WZ with much the same specifications of the C8080WZ albeit with a slower lens. The primary difference being the C7070WZ was slightly smaller in dimensions and with a small (cheaper) price differential to the C8080WZ. In practice both cameras had a very similar specification and target market.

He represented Missouri in the United States House of Representatives and served as Speaker of the House from 1911 to 1919. Born in Kentucky, he established a law practice in Bowling Green, Missouri. He won election to the House in 1892, lost his seat in 1894, and won the seat back in 1896. He became the House Minority Leader in 1908 and was elevated to Speaker after Democrats took control of the House in the 1910 elections. He inadvertently helped defeat the Canadian‚ÄìAmerican Reciprocity Treaty of 1911 by arguing that ratification of the treaty would lead to the incorporation of Canada into the United States. Entering the 1912 Democratic National Convention, Clark had won the backing of a majority of the delegates, but lacked the necessary two-thirds majority to win the presidential nomination. After dozens of ballots, Woodrow Wilson emerged as the Democratic presidential nominee, and went on to win the 1912 presidential election. Clark helped Wilson pass much of his progressive agenda but opposed U.S. entry into World War I. The 1920 House elections saw the defeat of numerous Democrats, including Clark. He died the following March, two days before he would have left office. Early life Clark was born in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky, to John Hampton Clark and Aletha Beauchamp. Through his mother, he was the first cousin twice removed of the famous lawyer-turned- murderer Jereboam O. Beauchamp. He is also directly descended from the famous John Beauchamp (Plymouth Company) through his mother. He graduated from Bethany College (West Virginia) where he was initiated into Delta Tau Delta fraternity, and Cincinnati Law School and moved to Missouri in 1875, and opened a law practice the following year. He eventually settled in Bowling Green, Missouri, the county seat of Pike County. He served as principal at Marshall College (now Marshall University) from 1873 to 1874. Political career Clark was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1892. After a surprise loss in 1894 to William M. Treloar, he regained the seat in 1896, and remained in the House until his death, the day before he was to leave office. Clark ran for House Minority Leader in 1903 but was defeated by John Sharp Williams of Mississippi. After Williams ran for the Senate in 1908, Clark ran again for the position and won. When the Democrats won control of the House in 1911, Clark became Speaker. In 1911, Clark gave a speech that helped to decide the election in Canada. On the floor of the House, Clark argued for the recent Canadian‚ÄìAmerican Reciprocity Treaty and declared: \\"I look forward to the time when the American flag will fly over every square foot of British North America up to the North Pole.\\"Allan, Chantal Bomb Canada: And Other Unkind Remarks in the American Media Athabasca: Athabasca University Press, 2009 p. 17. Clark went on to suggest in his speech that the treaty was the first step towards the end of Canada, a speech that was greeted with \\"prolonged applause\\" according to the Congressional Record.Allan, Bomb Canada: And Other Unkind Remarks in the American Media page 18. The Washington Post reported, \\"Evidently, then, the Democrats generally approved of Mr. Clark's annexation sentiments and voted for the reciprocity bill because, among other things, it improves the prospect of annexation.\\" The Chicago Tribunal condemned Clark in an editorial, predicting that Clark's speech might have fatally damaged the treaty in Canada; \\"He lets his imagination run wild like a Missouri mule on a rampage. Remarks about the absorption of one country by another grate harshly on the ears of the smaller.\\" The Conservative Party of Canada, which opposed the treaty, won the Canadian election in large part because of Clark's speech. In 1912, Clark was the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, coming into the convention with a majority of delegates pledged to him, but he failed to receive the necessary two-thirds of the vote on the first several ballots. After lengthy negotiation, clever management by supporters of New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson, with widespread allegations of influence by special interests, delivered the nomination instead to Wilson. Clark's speakership was notable for his skill from 1910 to 1914 in maintaining party unity to block William Howard Taft's legislation and then pass Wilson's. Clark split the party in 1917 and 1918, when he opposed Wilson's decision to bring the United States into World War I. In addition, Clark opposed the Federal Reserve Act, which concentrated financial power in the hands of eastern banks (mostly centered in New York City). Clark's opposition to the Federal Reserve Act is said to be the reason that Missouri is the only state granted two Federal Reserve Banks (one in St. Louis and one in Kansas City). Clark was defeated in the Republican landslide of 1920 and died shortly thereafter in his home in Washington, DC. Champ Clark is the namesake of the small community of Champ, Audrain County, Missouri. The former Clark National Forest likewise was named after him. Personal life Genevieve Bennett Clark Clark married Genevieve Bennett Clark on December 14, 1881. Together, they had two children, Joel Bennett Clark and Genevieve Clark Thomson. Bennet served as a United States Senator from Missouri from 1933 to 1945. Genevieve was a suffragette and a candidate for the House of Representatives for Louisiana. He was an adherent of the Disciples of Christ. Gallery File:James Beauchamp Clark.jpgSpeaker Clark's official portrait Image:MannWithClark.jpgSpeaker Clark (left) with Representative James R.

In modern designs, this type of fiddle is very similar to the violin, though with eight or nine strings (rather than four as on a standard violin) and thinner wood. Four of the strings are strung and played like a violin, while the rest, aptly named understrings or sympathetic strings, resonate under the influence of the other four. The Hardingfele is used mainly in the southwest part of Norway, whereas the ordinary violin (called flatfele - 'flat fiddle' or vanlig fele - 'common fiddle') is found elsewhere. The Hardingfele is used for dancing, accompanied by rhythmic loud foot stomping. It was also traditional for the fiddler to lead the bridal procession to the church. The instrument is often highly decorated, with a carved animal (usually a dragon or the Lion of Norway) or a carved woman's head as part of the scroll at the top of the pegbox, extensive mother of pearl inlay on the tailpiece and fingerboard, and black ink decorations called 'rosing' on the body of the instrument. Sometimes pieces of bone are used to decorate the pegs and the edges of the instrument. The earliest known example of the hardingfele is from 1651, made by Ole Jonsen Jaastad in Hardanger, Norway.Aksdal 1993, 21 Originally, the instrument had a rounder, narrower body.Aksdal 1993, 22 Around the year 1850, the modern layout with a body much like the violin became the norm. Tunings :See also Scordatura in folk music Unlike the violin, the Hardingfele is a transposing instrument, meaning that sheet music for the Hardingfele is written in a key other than the one in which the instrument sounds when it plays that music. Specifically, the Hardingfele is a D instrument, meaning that the Hardingfele's written C corresponds to D on a non-transposing instrument, such as the piano. The notes given below for tunings are therefore relative to the Hardingfele's written A, not to a concert A. The strings on a hardingfele The understrings are tuned to vibrate according to the main tuning. For example, when the main strings are tuned A-D-A-E, the understrings are tuned B-D-E-F-A. The tuning largely depends on the region in which the instrument is being played, or the requirements of a particular tune. In Norway, more than 20 different tunings are recorded.Gurvin 1958. Most hardanger tunes are played in a common tuning (A-D-A-E). The hardanger fiddle can also be played in \\"low bass\\", the word \\"bass\\" referring to the lowest string, (G-D-A-E), the normal violin tuning. In certain regions the \\"Gorrolaus\\" (F-D-A-E) tuning is sometimes used. Another tuning is called \\"troll tuning\\" (A-E-A-C). Troll tuning is used for the fanitullen tunes, also called the devil's tunes, as well as the tunes from the Kivlem√∏yane suite (thus associated with the hulderpeople as well as the devil); in the Valdres district of Norway, using this particular tuning is called \\"greylighting\\", a reminder that the fiddler tuned his fiddle like this when the morning was near, and he had played himself through a number of other tunings. Legend has it:no:Fanitullen that the fiddler learned fanitullen tunes from the devil. This tuning limits the melodic range of the tunes and is therefore sparsely used. Technique The technique of bowing a Hardingfele also differs from that used with a violin. It's a smoother, bouncier style of bowing, with a lighter touch. The player usually bows on two of the upper strings at a time, and sometimes three. This is made easy by the relative flatness of the bridge, unlike the more curved bridge on a violin. The objective is to create a continuous sound of two (or more due to the sympathetic understrings) pitches. The strings of the fiddle are slimmer than those of the violin, resembling the strings of violins from the baroque period. Many classically trained violinists use a baroque bow when playing the Hardingfele in order to counteract the extra weight that classical violinists naturally place on the string. The Hardanger fiddle and religion The Hardingfele has had a long history with the Christian church. Well known early fiddle maker Isak Botnen is said to have learned some of his craft from church lay leader and school master Lars Klark, as well as the methods for varnishing from pastor Dedrik Muus.Sandvik 1983, p.12. In many folktales the devil is associated with the Hardingfele, in fact many good players were said to have been taught to play by the devil, if not by the nix. During religious revivals in the 1800s many fiddles (regular and Hardanger)Broughton, Ellingham 1999 p.212. were destroyed or hidden both by fiddlers and laypeople who thought \\"that it would be best for the soul that the fiddles be burned\\", as it was viewed as a \\"sinful instrument that encouraged wild dances, drinking and fights.\\"Sandvik 1983, p.13. This happened in Norway, as well as other parts of Europe, and until the 20th century playing a Hardanger fiddle in a church building was forbidden.George 2008 Some fiddlers, however, played on, in spite of all condemnation, and thus, valuable traditions remained intact. The first folk musicians to perform in a church were the fiddlers Johannes Dahle from Tinn, and Gjermund Haugen from Notodden. Dahle performed in the 1920s. Famous modern fiddler Annbj√∏rg Lien has played with church organist Iver Kleive,Broughton, Ellingham 1999 216. but even she has experienced prejudice before performance from the religious side.Magiske understrenger - historien om hardingfela (Documentary produced by NRK). Also, the oldest known fiddles still in existence can be heard accompanied by the oldest playable church pipe organ in Norway (originally built for an 18th-century church) on the album \\"Rosa i Botnen\\" by Knut Hamre and Benedicte Maurseth. While the use of a Hardingfele in church in Norway may still be a bit sensitive for some, fiddlers in other parts of the world have no problems playing in churches for all types of occasions, including weddings.Andrea Een and the Hardanger Fiddle - Brightcove Influences Edvard Grieg adapted many Hardanger folk tunes into his compositions, and composed tunes for the Hardanger as part of his score for Ibsen's Peer Gynt Suite No. 1. The opening phrase of \\"Morning\\" from Grieg's Peer Gynt music is derived from the tuning of the sympathetic strings of the Hardanger fiddle: A F E D E F and so on. In recent years, the instrument has gained recognition in the rest of the world. Japan has been one of the countries that has found an interest in the hardingfele and Japanese musicians travel to Norway just to learn to play this instrument. In 1997, the Australian classical composer Liza Lim wrote the piece Philtre for a solo Hardanger fiddle. Another recent work is \\"mobius II\\" for hardanger fiddle and electronics by the British composer Rose Dodd (2011, premiered at the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival by Britt Pernille Froholm). Players Notable hardingfele players include Anne Hytta, Lillebj√∏rn Nilsen, Hallvard T. Bj√∏rgum, Torleiv H. Bj√∏rgum, Sven Nyhus, Per Anders Buen Garn√•s, Knut Buen, Hauk Buen, Kristiane Lund, Olav J√∏rgen Hegge, Vidar Lande, Alexander Rybak, Annbj√∏rg Lien, Myllarguten (Targjei Augundsson), Anders Hagen, Elizabeth Weis Nord, Lars Fykerud, Lars Jensen, Nils √òkland, English Northumbrian piper and fiddle player Kathryn Tickell, the Irish fiddlers Caoimh√≠n √ì Raghallaigh and Mair√©ad N√≠ Mhaonaigh, and American players Loretta Kelley, Bill Boyd, Andrea Een, Karin Loberg Code, Toby Weinberg, Dan Trueman, Karen Solgard, Mariel Vandersteel, Kris Yenney and the multi instrumentalist David Lindley. In March 2010 Olav Lukseng√•rd Mjelva won the Spellemannprisen Traditional music/Norwegian folk category (the Norwegian equivalent of the Grammy Awards), for his album Fele/Hardingfele, R√∏ros/Hallingdal.knyt fausko Use in film The Hardanger fiddle was used in the soundtracks of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King composed by Howard Shore, to provide the main voice for the Rohan theme. The use of the Hardanger fiddle in this movie, however, is far from traditional since the theme does not make noticeable use of the usual practice of bowing on two strings at a time for harmony as well as the fact that the violinist used vibrato, which is not traditionally used since the slight variance in pitch interferes with the sympathetic resonance of the understrings. It was also used by composer John Powell and played by Dermot Crehan in the DreamWorks film How to Train Your Dragon for the main romantic theme. The Hardanger fiddle is also featured in the soundtrack of Armageddon (composed by Trevor Rabin), and in Fargo (composed by Carter Burwell). In the latter, the context is a little more traditional‚Äîthe main theme it plays is an arrangement of a Norwegian folk song entitled \\"The Lost Sheep\\". Steven Van Zandt used the Hardanger fiddle in the theme song he wrote for the TV series Lilyhammer. In the Japanese animated movie Tales from Earthsea it is played by Rio Yamase. The Hardanger fiddle is featured in the soundtrack of the 2017 film Dunkirk.

This makes them \\"official\\" languages, having preferred status in law over all other languages. Although the Official Languages Act is not the only piece of federal language law, it is the legislative keystone of Canada's official bilingualism. It was substantially amended in 1988. Both languages are equal in Canada's government and in all the services it controls, such as the courts. Summary of main features The ActCanada. Official Languages Act (1985, c. 31 (4th Supp.)). Ottawa. Page consulted July 4, 2006. provides, among other things, *that Canadians have the right to receive services from federal departments and from Crown corporations in both official languages; *that Canadians will be able to be heard before federal courts in the official language of their choice; *that Parliament will adopt laws and to publish regulations in both official languages, and that both versions will be of equal legal weight; *that English and French will have equal status of languages of work within the federal public service within geographically defined parts of the country that are designated bilingual (most notably in National Capital Region, Montreal and New Brunswick), as well as in certain overseas government offices and in parts of the country where there is sufficient demand for services in both official languages. In remaining geographical areas, the language of work for federal public servants is French (in Quebec) and English (elsewhere); The Federal government has set in place regulations establishing linguistic categories (anglophone, francophone, bilingual) for some job functions within the public service. Departments and agencies of the federal government are required to fill these positions with individuals who are capable of serving the public in English, in French, or in both languages. Unilingual public servants are given incentives to learn the other official language, and the government provides language training and offers a \\"bilingualism bonus\\". Part VI of the Act mandates that English-speaking Canadians and French-speaking Canadians not be discriminated against based on ethnic origin or first language learned when it comes to employment opportunities and advancement. The law also created the Commissioner of Official Languages, an officer of Parliament charged with receiving complaints from the public, undertaking inquiries, and making recommendations regarding the status of the two official languages. Section 32 of the Official Languages Act authorizes the Governor in Council (i.e., the federal cabinet) to issue regulations defining the geographic regions in which services will be offered by the federal government in the relevant minority language (English in Quebec and French elsewhere). This provides a legal definition for the otherwise vague requirement that services be provided in the minority official languages wherever there is \\"significant demand.\\" The definition used in the regulations is complex, but basically an area of the country is served in both languages if at least 5,000 persons in that area, or 5% of the local population (whichever is smaller), belongs to that province's English or French linguistic minority population. The regulations were first promulgated in 1991. Political context The Official Languages Act was one of the cornerstones of the government of Pierre Trudeau. The law was an attempt to implement some of the policy objectives outlined by the federally commissioned Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, which had been established in 1963 and since that time had been issuing periodic reports on the inequitable manner in which Canada's English-speaking and French- speaking populations were treated by the federal administration. At that time, only 9% of jobs within the federal public service were occupied by Francophones,Canada. Rapport de la Commission royale d‚Äôenqu√™te sur le bilinguisme et le biculturalisme. Livre III : le monde du travail. Ottawa, Imprimeur de la Reine, 1969, p. 374 even though French-speakers formed a quarter of the Canadian population. The proportion of jobs designated bilingual grew to 14% in 1978, and to 25% in 2004.Canada, Commissioner of Official Languages. Annual Report, Special Edition 1969-2004. Volume I . Ottawa, 2006. . Page 43263 consulted July 4, 2006 One of the most important features of the 1969 act was to ensure that federal government services would be provided in both official languages, wherever population size warranted it. Its principles were later incorporated into the Constitution of Canada, in Section 16 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A new Official Languages Act was enacted in 1988 in order to achieve two objectives. First, it was necessary to update the 1969 law to take into account the new language- related obligations that the federal government had undertaken under Sections 16-23 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which had been enacted in 1982. For example, Section 20 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the right of the Canadian public to communicate in English and French with any central government office or with regional offices where there is \\"a significant demand for communication with and services from that office.\\" Significant demand is not defined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One of the purposes of the Official Languages Act of 1988 was to remedy this omission. Second, the new law included provisions for the promotion by the government of Canada of Quebec's English-speaking minority and of the French- speaking minorities in the rest of the country. The programs that fall under the \\"promotion\\" umbrella are often designed to encourage each provincial government to offer services to its official-language minority community, and contain a mechanism for transferring funds to the provincial governments in order to finance a part of these programs. Under Canada's federal constitution, many important services, such as education and health, fall under provincial jurisdiction and are therefore off-limits to any direct federal spending. The transfer of federal funds, conditional upon the fulfilment by each provincial government of detailed conditions laid out in a funding agreement, is a constitutionally permitted method of dodging this jurisdictional constraint. This would suggest that the Official Languages Act and Quebec's Charter of the French Language (also known as \\"Bill 101\\") are fundamentally at cross-purposes with each other. However, that perspective is not universally accepted. For example, former Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff has stated that \\"Bill 101 and the Official Languages Act are not in opposition, they are complementary.\\"Ignatieff made the comment at the Liberal Party of Canada's Quebec convention in early October 2009. He is quoted in Don Macpherson, \\"NDP would add rights for French Quebecers\\", in the Montreal Gazette, October 8, 2009. Reactions=Provincial legislatures In 1969, the law was adopted with all-party support in the House of Commons of Canada. Despite this, there was not universal support for the law. The premiers of the three Prairie provinces requested, early in 1969, that the Official Languages Bill be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada to determine its constitutionality. They maintained, along with JT Thorson, the former president of the Exchequer Court of Canada, that the bill was outside the powers of the Parliament of Canada.Thorson's arguments are discussed, and rejected, by Eugene Forsey in \\"The Constitutionality of the Official Languages Act\\", Globe and Mail, February 8, 1969. The reference to the court was never made, but the legal question was resolved in 1974, when the Supreme Court ruled, in Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick, that the subject matter of the bill was within federal jurisdiction. In subsequent decades the response from provincial governments to the example set by the federal government has been mixed: *New Brunswick, which is home to Canada's second- largest French-speaking minority population, adopted the federal government policy and adopted its own Official Languages Act on April 18, 1969. The bilingual status of New Brunswick was strengthened in 1993 by the addition of section 16.1 to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. *Ontario, which is the home to Canada's largest French-speaking minority, opted instead to enact a law (the French Language Services Act) which provides for services of the provincial government to be made available in certain geographically designated regions, but which does not give the French language either a symbolic or an authoritative status as an equal \\"official\\" language of Ontario. However, the English and French versions of statutes and regulations that are enacted or made in both languages are equally authoritative. *Manitoba, which is home to Canada's third-largest French-speaking minority, refused to overturn its ban on the use of French in both the provincial legislature and its courts (which had been in effect since 1890), until it was forced to do so in 1985 by a ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada (Reference re Manitoba Language Rights) that the province was under a constitutional obligation to enact laws in French as well as in English. *Quebec, which is home to an English-speaking minority of over half a million, had traditionally been the only province which was generous in its treatment of its minority- language population, and for this reason had been cited by the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism as the model to be emulated by other provinces. But in the 1970s, the provincial legislature adopted two laws, the Official Language Act (also known as \\"Bill 22\\") and the Charter of the French Language (also known as \\"Bill 101\\"), reducing the access of Quebecers to English-language services, preventing immigrants and Francophones from enrolling their children in English schools, requiring that French be made the language of the workplace, and restricting the use of English on commercial signs. Public reactions Public support for bilingual services had dramatically increased between the mid-1960s and the end of the 1970s. There was no direct polling on the popularity of the Official Languages Act itself at the time, but poll data on related questions gives an indication of a significant shift in the attitudes of English-speaking Canadians. A 1965 poll showed that 17% of Canadians living outside Quebec favoured the use of public funds to finance French-language schools. This proportion had risen to 77% by 1977 (albeit in response to a slightly different question about support for provincial governments offering services in French \\"where possible\\"). Within Quebec, changes to the treatment of French-speakers within the federal public service were met with approval mixed with a scepticism that this actually helped the unilingual French-speaking majority of Quebecers, who continued to be excluded from all federal jobs designated \\"bilingual\\", since by definition a \\"bilingual\\" job requires the use of English. However, the changes found some opposition in English Canada. Toronto Telegram columnist Braithwaither sums up the position of the opponents of the bill like this: \\"We are not afraid of any aspect of the language bill, we simply regard it as unnecessary, politically-motivated, costly to implement, divisive, and, as it affects the non-English, non-French third of the population, wholly discriminatory.\\" As per the bill, some positions in the public sector were designated as bilingual. At the implementation of the bill, if a bilingual position was held by a unilingual anglophone, this person was allowed to keep their position on the condition that they attempted to learn French, and all subsequent holders of this position must be bilingual. Under these circumstances, there were fears that, because of the higher rate of bilingualism among Francophones, people whose first official language is French would become overrepresented in the public sector. However, this has not become the case. The ratio of French first official language speakers to English first official language speakers in the public sector is almost the same as in the general population. At any rate, the adoption of official bilingualism at the federal level did almost nothing to slow the rise of the sovereignist movement. The nationalist Parti Qu√©b√©cois made its first significant electoral breakthrough less than a year after the Official Languages Act was adopted, winning 23% of the vote in Quebec's 1970 provincial election and replacing the Union Nationale as the main electoral vehicle for Quebec nationalism. Six years later, the Parti Qu√©b√©cois came to power in the 1976 provincial election.  Failure to implement all provisions of the Official Languages Act  From time to time, the Official Languages Commissioner draws attention to the fact that federal agencies subject to the law are failing to live up to their legal obligations regarding official languages. In a report published in 2004 on the 35th anniversary of the Official Languages Act, Commissioner Dyane Adam noted that only 86% of posts designated \\"bilingual\\" in the federal public service were occupied by persons who had effectively mastered the two official languages. This nevertheless was an increase over the comparable figure of 1978, when only 70% of the incumbents in posts that had been designated \\"bilingual\\" were capable of speaking both languages at accepted levels.Canada, Commissariat aux langues officielles. Rapport annuel √©dition sp√©ciale 1969-2004. Volume I . Ottawa, 2005. . Page consulted July 4, 2006 In January 2017, the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages had received 14 complaints related to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's use of English and French during public town hall meetings. Eleven of the reports came following a session in Sherbrooke, Quebec, where Trudeau, whose father had enacted the Official Languages Act fifty years prior, answered in French when he was asked in English to address a lack of government-provided mental health services for English-speaking persons.https://youtube.com/8cpc6JtENOE The remaining three were attributed to Trudeau answering in English to a question asked in French while in Peterborough, Ontario.  Opinion polls  According to a poll conducted in 2002, 98% of Quebecers consider official bilingualism to be \\"very important\\" or \\"somewhat important\\". This proportion drops to 76% in the Atlantic provinces, 72% in Ontario, 67% in the Prairie provinces, and 63% in British Columbia.Andrew Parkin and Andr√© Turcotte.

Another poll, conducted in 2000, shows that more than half of Canadians outside Quebec believe that too much effort has gone into promoting bilingualism. By contrast, only 26% of Quebecers shared this view.Andrew Parkin and Andr√© Turcotte.

A poll conducted in 2012 found that 63% of Canadians were in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada, a 9% increase since that same poll was last conducted in 2003. In 2016, another poll was conducted, showing increasing support for official bilingualism in every province. Among telephone respondents, 88% of Canadians said they \\"strongly support\\" or \\"somewhat support\\" the aims of the Official Languages Act: 91% in the Atlantic, 94% in Quebec, 87% in Ontario, 83% in the Prairies, 90% in Alberta and 84% in British Columbia. 84% of telephone respondents also said they personally \\"strongly support\\" or \\"somewhat support\\" official bilingualism. The results were more mixed in the online portion of the poll, where 78% of respondents said they \\"strongly support\\" or \\"somewhat support\\" the aims of the Official Languages Act, and 73% said they personally \\"strongly support\\" or \\"somewhat support\\" official bilingualism. In another poll conducted on this topic in the same year, 67% of respondents across Canada answered \\"yes\\" to the question \\"Are you personally in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada?\\" while 31% said \\"no\\".

The book series itself is an expansion, with some changes to detail, of Card's 1977 short story \\"Ender's Game.\\" In the 2013 film adaptation of Ender's Game, Ender is portrayed by Asa Butterfield. Ender's Game In the first book of the series, Ender's Game, Ender is the youngest and most well rounded of three children; his parents conceived him contrary to the state's strict two-child policy. His existence was called for by a program aiming at producing commanders for humanity's war against the Formics, or \\"Buggers.\\" He attends Battle School, an Earth-orbiting space station that trains similar prodigies. He receives the same education as other children, but the military recognizes him as their best bet to be supreme commander and often manipulates its own rules to make sure Ender has the necessary technical skills and the right character for their ends. Expressly, Ender is conditioned to be entirely self-sufficient from a very young age. As a child, Ender is bullied at school for being a \\"Third,\\" particularly by a bully named Stilson. After Stilson engages him in a fight, Ender beats him up so severely that the boy is hospitalized. Ender is tormented by his brother Peter, a sadist who delights in killing small animals and tormenting other children, and who resents the attention Ender gets from the military. His only refuge is with his beloved sister Valentine, his protector, and only friend. When he is accepted into Battle School, he is brokenhearted at leaving her, but she assures him that they will always have a bond. At Battle School, Ender is exposed to significant emotional and mental anguish and even physical danger. The administration is forbidden from protecting him from harm, guaranteeing that he would never look to anybody else for help. Ender breezes through academics, his main interest being the centerpiece of the school: a team-based three-dimensional laser tag competition in the zero-g Battle Room. He becomes a masterful player, then a masterful strategist, and is eventually assigned command of Dragon Army. He molds the group of untested and unwanted students into the most successful army in the history of the school (it is revealed in Ender's Shadow that Julian \\"Bean\\" Delphiki chose them). Ender's unprecedented success arouses his fellow commanders' jealousy, who subject him to steadily worse torment. The lead bully, Bonzo, confronts Ender in the shower and attempts to kill Ender, but fails. Ender, driven to defend himself because of the administration's lack of intervention, kills Bonzo to end the conflict but does not know it. This reinforces Ender's recurring role as the Ender of conflict, a personality trait favored by the administration. After the fight, they let Ender graduate from Battle School, never informing him that Bonzo died from his injuries. After graduating several years ahead of schedule, he is transferred to Command School on Eros. There he trains in interstellar fleet combat with holographic simulators. After Ender masters the game under ordinary conditions, the game changes from one with direct control of ships to one where he relays commands to his friends and associates from Battle School: Julian \\"Bean\\" Delphiki, Alai, Shen, Petra Arkanian, Dink Meeker, Crazy Tom, Hot Soup, Fly Molo, Vlad, Dumper, and Carn Carby. Under the tutelage of Mazer Rackham, the legendary savior of humanity from the previous war, Ender and his trusted companions take on a grueling series of battles and emerge victorious each time, although the mounting pressure pushes Ender to the edge. The final battle takes place above a planet made by the simulator at command school. The fight is against an enemy with overwhelming numerical superiority. Ender perceives this as a grossly unfair test and resolves to win by breaking the rules. This, he thinks, would convince his instructors that he is not the man to lead the Fleet into battle with the Formics. Instead of fighting the enemy ship-to- ship, Ender penetrates their defensive perimeter and destroys the planet itself. Not until after the pandemonium that follows is he told that it was not a simulation: Instead of taking on Rackham in what they had thought was a long series of simulations, he and his classmates had been unknowingly issuing orders to real ships in real combat. The final battle consisted of the destruction of the Bugger homeworld and the apparent eradication of the Bugger species. Ender is hailed as a hero, but he is stricken with guilt for having unknowingly committed genocide. Valentine informs him that in the wake of the war, he would never be allowed to return to Earth due to her actions to protect him from Peter, who was becoming a major political force on Earth. He journeys with her to one of the colonies being established on the now- abandoned Bugger worlds. Once there, he discovers a fertilized pupa of a Queen Bugger, hidden in a place that the Buggers designed for him to discover by modeling it to resemble part of an interactive computer game he played during his years in the Battle School. The buggers find out about it during his tormented dreams of them in Command School. The pupal Queen is capable of continuing the Bugger race. Through rudimentary telepathic communication with the Queen, he learned what he had begun to suspect before the war's end: The entire conflict had been a mistake, resulting in the inability of two alien species to communicate. He also learns from the Queen that the Buggers had regretted having mistakenly fought humans and forgiven Ender for destroying their world. Empathizing with the Queen, Ender promises to find her a home to grow where the humans would not annihilate the Buggers. To foster this eventual rebirth, Ender writes a book called The Hive Queen, which tells the story of the war from the Formic perspective. Ender uses the pseudonym Speaker for the Dead to author it. When Peter, who has advanced to the position of Hegemon of Earth, contacts him, the Speaker for the Dead, he writes a second novel, The Hegemon, a human parallel to the first book. The two are combined by popular culture, eventually becoming one of the founding texts of a quasi- religious practice on Earth's colonies. After writing the book, Ender and Valentine depart in a ship in an attempt to find a planet that would allow the Queen to grow and call their new home. Speaker for the Dead Speaker for the Dead begins 3000 years after the events of Ender's Game. Ender is departing the planet where his sister Valentine has found a husband. He has also acquired an integrated computer by which he communicates with a powerful artificial intelligence known as Jane. Her existence is known only to Ender. He has taken the role of a Speaker for the Dead, keeping his identity as \\"Ender the Xenocide\\", who orchestrated the victory over the Formics, a secret. His books, \\"The Hive Queen\\" and \\"The Hegemon\\", in which he \\"spoke\\" for the dead Formics, was a self-critical work that was intended to portray Ender as a heartless monster who destroyed a sentient race. The name \\"Ender\\" is now considered a vile insult. Ender departs for the planet Lusitania, where a request has been made to \\"speak\\" on behalf of a researcher who has died from contact with the planet's indigenous species, the piggies. When he arrives at the planet 22 years later (relativity having aged him only slightly; less than two weeks) he finds that the original call for a Speaker has been rescinded. Two other requests, however, have been made to \\"speak\\" for more recent deaths. Ender discovers that both calls originated from the same family; the first from Novinha's daughter Ela requesting someone speak for the death of Novinha's husband Marcos, and the second from her eldest son Miro, who has asked for a speaker for the researcher Libo. Ender begins to investigate the Marcos figure and has frequent contact with Novinha's family. His honest and open approach endears him to most of the children as a father figure. He discovers that Marcos was abusive to his wife. With the help of Jane and his connection with the children, he uncovers multiple secrets that have been hidden for years. However, while in dialogue with the Children of the Mind, the planet's religious monastic order, he is annoyed by Jane's semi-sarcastic commentary and turns off his connection to her, something he has never done before. The resulting complete isolation and trauma of Jane is the unforeseen result. Jane, without consulting Ender, sends incriminating reports to the interstellar authorities who order the arrest of Miro and Ouanda, the researchers and lovers who have been investigating the piggies. The colony's charter is cancelled and the colonists are forced to rely on Ender for guidance. Meanwhile, Ender has been receiving pressure from the Hive-Queen's pupa to allow her to settle on this world because she has been in telepathic contact with another race. Ender assumes this race is the piggies, although the bipedal life forms that are the primary contacts of Miro and Ouanda seem very simple and not telepathic at all. After the sanctions are put in place, he gets Miro and Ouanda to allow him to visit the piggies, who have been asking to meet him, the 'original Speaker' (a claim Miro and Ouanda have been dismissing as a misunderstanding). Ender reverts many of the researchers' assumptions when he not only admits to being the original Speaker, but has the piggies demonstrate that the trees the piggies grow from the corpses of those who have been ritually killed is the third, reproductive stage. The ritual killings of the two xenologers were misunderstandings. The piggies were under the false impression that humans reproduced in a fashion similar to themselves. After these revelations, Ender proceeds to \\"speak\\" for Marcos and revealed many secrets hitherto hidden, mostly by Novinha. Foremost among them was that Marcos was incapable of having children, and Novinha's children are offspring of Libo. This is devastating news to Miro, because it means his girlfriend Ouanda is his half-sister. Sanctions from the Intergalactic Congress are learned of and Ender recommends that the colony declare itself in rebellion. He re-establishes contact with Jane who masks their ansible signal. He enters into the beginnings of a relationship with Novinha. His sister, Valentine, agrees to travel to the colony. On the far side of the planet he has discovered a site reminiscent of a dream in Enders Game. With her guidance, he plants the Hive-Queen's pupa in preparation for the rebirth of the Formics after 3000 years. Xenocide During Xenocide, Ender is looked to as an unofficial leader for the multiple efforts being undertaken in the rebel Colony of Lusitania. He is helping as much as he can with Novinha's work in protecting humans from the descolada virus. The Descolada is fatal to humans, but is essential for the piggies' life and reproduction. The Formics have an immune system that is advanced enough to protect them, and the humans have been using anti-viral dietary supplements, but both defenses are starting to fade in effectiveness in the face of the virus' rampant mutations. Ender is also attempting to keep the peace on planet among the three species where resentment is brewing. The humans are starting to resent the piggies for being the reason they can't just kill the descolada outright. The existence of the new Formic colony is not general knowledge, but Ender knows that their appearance and their non-human way of reasoning would cause friction with the humans. Particularly troublesome are Novinha's two youngest children; Grego, who is something of a rabble-rouser among the humans, and Quara, who sees the virus as sentient and is bringing up problematic objections to the research her mother and sister are doing. The piggies and the Formics are also worried about the approaching human fleet, which may destroy the planet if the threat of the descolada virus is unleashed on humanity. Eventually research ordered by the government on another planet, Path, leads a young genius girl, Han Qing-jao, to deduce the existence of Jane, who is inextricably tied to the ansible system. Jane reveals herself to Qing-jao in an effort to prevent her from informing the authorities by telling her that the OCD her people suffer from was governmentally ordered and orchestrated, a plea which the girl's father Han Fei-tzu and handmaiden Si Wang-mu agree with. However, the report to the authorities is dispatched regardless and the government enacts a plan to temporarily deactivate the ansible network to purge Jane from the system. The father agrees to help with the Descolada problem regardless of his daughter's actions, in exchange for a cure for the pervasive OCD that plagues them. The Lusitanian researchers agree, but though a cure for both is designed, it proves impossible to synthesize; they can't cure the OCD without removing the genius as well, and the counter for the descolada simply won't be created. Meanwhile, putting together facts about Jane's origins, the ansible, and philotes, the irreducible building blocks of all matter everywhere, they deduce that Jane has the power to take any object she knows about in great detail and pull it outside the known universe, an area where conscious thought has physical power. Ender goes on the first test flight because Jane's existence was a direct result of his time at the Battle School, where the buggers established a connection with him via a computer simulation game; therefore, Jane is most likely to be able to keep Ender's form in her mind. Since Ender has all but passed Jane off to Miro at this point, due to the previous misunderstanding in Speaker, he must go as well. Ela goes because she is the only one with enough knowledge to produce the needed viruses. The test flight occurs with unexpected side-effects. Ela produces the new viruses, but Miro also gives himself a new body, undamaged unlike his old one. Ender, however, inadvertently creates copies of his brother and sister from his memories. They are more based on those memories than reality; therefore, Valentine is very soft and loving, and Peter is almost pure evil and malice. Horrified at what he has created, Ender removes himself from further efforts, as they will all need to involve the instantaneous travel Jane can do by moving things outside and Ender will not risk creating more things like his pseudo-siblings. Children of the Mind Children of the Mind begins where Xenocide left off. Much of Ender's story revolves around his \\"pseudo- offspring\\" Peter and young Val. After Ender's first and only trip to the outside and back inside, Ender creates Peter and young Val from his aiua. Ender's \\"life force\\" is now split between three different people. Throughout the book Ender has a difficult time maintaining an aiua strong enough for all three people to live. The maximum number of people Ender can keep alive and healthy at any given time is two. In the beginning young Val suffers the most because Ender is the least interested in her mission, until it is revealed that she, along with Miro and Jane, are looking for the home planet of the descolada virus. Peter never had to compete for Ender's aiua because Ender was always interested in Peter's mission to prevent the Lusitania fleet from using the Molecular Disruption Device on Lusitania. Now that Ender's aiua is fully invested in Peter and young Val, Ender himself begins to deteriorate. This causes Ender to collapse while working in the monastery garden, falling in and out of consciousness for the remainder of the book until his death. Ender's physical manifestation is gone, but his aiua continues through Peter (young Val gives up her physical manifestation as well for Jane and her aiua continues through Peter as well). Ender in Exile A book that chronicles the 'lost years' between Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead, Ender in Exile tells of Ender's initial set-off from Eros, the long journey to the first colony, Shakespeare, as well as his trip to the Indian-dominant colony of Ganges, where Ender encounters a familiar, yet not-so-familiar face. The court martial of Hyrum Graff is expanded upon; some light is shed on Graff's life after he was made Minister of Colonization, as well as Mazer Rackham's travels after the Formic War. After defeating the Formics, Ender remains on Eros. Peter, under his alias of Locke, has quelled the warring nations and has implemented a temporary truce. Valentine no longer wishes to be a part of Peter's quest to rule the world. She pleads with her parents to come along with her and Ender to the planet colony of Shakespeare. They decline. Alessandra and her mother, Dorabella, sign-up to go to Shakespeare to get away from Dorabella's mother and money problems. They had planned to be put into stasis during the two-year voyage, but several complications occurred and instead they remain awake. Along with the crew of Ender, Valentine, Admiral Quincy Morgan (the captain) and some other colonists who opted against stasis. Throughout the voyage, Ender has a battle of wills with Admiral Morgan, who attempts to usurp Ender's lawful position as Governor of Shakespeare. Morgan sees Ender to be a foolish child that no one would follow. During the voyage, Dorabella seduces Admiral Morgan and tries to use her daughter, Alessandra, to seduce Ender hoping that, through her own marriage to Morgan and Alessandras' successful marrying of Ender, Morgan could rule Shakespeare using Ender as a puppet. Upon arrival at Shakespeare, Ender quickly and easily crushes Morgan's attempted bloodless coup, with a little help from Minister of Colonization Hyrum Graff back on Earth. Ender then successfully liberates Alessandra from her dominating mother. After two years as governor, and completing 'The Hive Queen and the Hegemon', Ender convinces Valentine to move on. Ender's first stop, at the request of Hyrum Graff, is the Hindu colony of Ganges which is governed by Virlomi, a former battle school student who caused an uprising in India before she was subdued and exiled by Peter Wiggin's Hegemony. Once there, Ender agrees to help Virlomi quell an uprising by a group called 'The Natives of Ganges', led by an angry young man named Randall Firth under the delusion that he is the son of Achilles de Flandres. The so-called 'natives' have adopted 'The Hive Queen' as a rallying cry, and have begun to belittle the name of war hero Ender Wiggin coining the phrase 'Ender the Xenocide'. Ender and Randall have a physical combat leaving Ender near death. Ender reveals Randall's true parentage (two of Ender's old friends and squadron commanders, Julian 'Bean' Delphiki and Petra Arkanian Delphiki Wiggin), after which Randall renounces his secret name, Achilles, and renames himself Arkanian Delphiki. Shortly after, Ender reunites Randall and his true mother by way of the ansible.

Site  The ruins are located above the confluence of the Warme Bode and Kalte Bode rivers in the Harz Mountains in central Germany. They lie at a height of 460 metres above sea level on the edge of a wooded plateau and offer a good view of the Wurmberg and the Brocken, the highest mountains in Lower Saxony and the Harz respectively.  History  In 1312 the site is first mentioned in the records as castrum K√∂nigshof when Bishop Albrecht von Halberstadt purchased the castle from Knappen Heinrich von Botvelde. In 1324 there is another mention of it as castrum K√∂ningshof acqisivit, then all went quiet until it is described in 1709 for the first time as K√∂nigsburg. At that time it had already fallen into ruins. When Paul H√∂fer carried out extensive excavations in the years from 1898 to 1901, he assumed he had discovered the long sought after palace (Pfalz) of Bodfeld and produced several publications about it. In 1931, Carl Schuchhardt suggested, through advances in soil research, that this was incorrect and, a little later, this was confirmed by Paul Grimm, who was able to establish that the finds, especially the pottery, were not older than the 13th century. Although the results of this research from the 1930s have been consistently acknowledged within the scientific community, K√∂nigsh√ºtte still advertises today that the K√∂nigsburg is the Bodfeld hunting palace and one of the most significant historical sites in the Harz.  Site and hiking  Only remnants of the bergfried and several ditches and ramparts bear witness to the former castle. The ruins of the K√∂nigsburg are incorporated as No. 41 into the system of the checkpoints in the Harzer Wandernadel.

April 12, 1892 ‚Äì April 13, 1973) was an American writer, novelist and artist who worked as a hospital custodian in Chicago, Illinois. He has become famous for his posthumously discovered 15,145-page, single-spaced fantasy manuscript called The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion, along with several hundred drawings and watercolor paintings illustrating the story. The visual subject matter of his work ranges from idyllic scenes in Edwardian interiors and tranquil flowered landscapes populated by children and fantastic creatures, to scenes of horrific terror and carnage depicting young children being tortured and massacred. Much of his artwork is mixed media with collage elements. Darger's artwork has become one of the most celebrated examples of outsider art. Life Darger was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Henry Darger Sr. and Rosa Fullman. Cook County records show he was born at home, located at 350 W. 24th Street. When he was four years old, his mother died of puerperal fever after giving birth to a daughter, who was given up for adoption; Darger never knew his sister. One of his biographers, the art historian and psychologist John M. MacGregor, discovered that Rosa had two children before Henry, but did not discover their whereabouts. By Darger's own account, his father was kind and reassuring to him and they lived together until 1900. In that year, the crippled and impoverished Darger Sr. was taken to St. Augustine's Home for the Aged. Because of his apparent intellect, the young Darger was initially enrolled in public school at the third grade level; after his father became crippled, Darger was moved to the Mission of Our Lady of Mercy, a Catholic orphanage. Darger Sr. died in 1905, and his son was institutionalized in the Illinois Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children in Lincoln, Illinois, also called the Lincoln State School (today the Lincoln Developmental Center), with the diagnosis, according to Stephen Prokopoff, that \\"little Henry's heart is not in the right place\\". According to John MacGregor, the diagnosis was actually \\"self-abuse\\", a euphemism for masturbation. Darger himself felt that much of his problem was being able to see through adult lies and becoming a \\"smart- aleck\\" as a result, which often led to his being punished by teachers and ganged up on by classmates. He also went through a lengthy phase of feeling compelled to make strange noises (perhaps as a result of Tourette syndrome) which irritated others. The Lincoln asylum's practices included forced child labor and severe punishments, which Darger would later seemingly incorporate into his writing. Darger later said that, to be fair, there were also \\"good times\\" at the asylum, he enjoyed some of the work, and he had friends as well as enemies. While he was there, Darger received word that his father had died. A series of attempted escapes ended successfully in 1908. The 16-year-old returned to Chicago and, with the help of his godmother, found menial employment in a Catholic hospital and in this fashion continued to support himself until his retirement in 1963. Except for a brief stint in the U.S. Army during World War I, his life took on a pattern that seems to have varied little: he attended Mass daily,Breidenbach, Tom. \\"Henry Darger: Andrew Edlin Gallery\\".

His one close friend, William Schloeder, was of like mind on the subject of protecting abused and neglected children, and the pair proposed founding a \\"Children's Protective Society\\" that would put such children up for adoption to loving families. Schloeder left Chicago sometime in the mid-1930s, but he and Darger stayed in touch through letters until Schloeder's death in 1959. Darger's biographer Jim Elledge speculates that Darger and Schloeder may have had a romantic relationship while Schloeder lived in Chicago. In 1930, Darger settled into a second-floor room on Chicago's North Side at 851 W. Webster Avenue in the Lincoln Park section of the city, near the DePaul University campus. It was in this room for the next 43 years that Darger would imagine and write his massive tomes (in addition to a 10-year daily weather journal and assorted diaries) until his death in April 1973 in St. Augustine's Home for the Aged, the same institution in which his father had died. In the last entry in his diary, he wrote: \\"January 1, 1971. I had a very poor nothing like Christmas. Never had a good Christmas all my life, nor a good new year, and now... I am very bitter but fortunately not revengeful, though I feel should be how I am...\\" Darger is buried in All Saints Cemetery in Des Plaines, Illinois, in a plot called \\"The Old People of the Little Sisters of the Poor Plot\\". His headstone is inscribed \\"Artist\\" and \\"Protector of Children\\". Works=In the Realms of the Unreal In the Realms of the Unreal is a 15,145-page work bound in fifteen immense, densely typed volumes (with three of them consisting of several hundred illustrations, scroll-like watercolor paintings on paper derived from magazines and coloring books) created over six decades. Darger illustrated his stories using a technique of traced images cut from magazines and catalogues, arranged in large panoramic landscapes and painted in watercolors, some as large as 30 feet wide and painted on both sides. He wrote himself into the narrative as the children's protector. The largest part of the book, The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion, follows the adventures of the daughters of Robert Vivian, seven princesses of the Christian nation of Abbieannia who assist a daring rebellion against the child slavery imposed by John Manley and the Glandelinians. Children take up arms in their own defense and are often slain in battle or viciously tortured by the Glandelinian overlords. The elaborate mythology includes the setting of a large planet, around which Earth orbits as a moon (where most people are Christian and mostly Catholic), and a species called the \\"Blengigomeneans\\" (or Blengins for short), gigantic winged beings with curved horns who occasionally take human or part-human form, even disguising themselves as children. They are usually benevolent, but some Blengins are extremely suspicious of all humans, due to Glandelinian atrocities. Once released from the Lincoln asylum, Darger repeatedly attempted to adopt a child, but his efforts failed. Images of children often served as his inspiration, particularly a portrait from the Chicago Daily News from May 9, 1911: a five-year-old murder victim, named Elsie Paroubek. The girl had left home on April 8 of that year telling her mother she was going to visit her aunt around the corner from her home. She was last seen listening to an organ grinder with her cousins. Her body was found a month later in a sanitary district channel near the screen guards of the powerhouse at Lockport. An autopsy found she had probably been suffocated‚Äînot strangled, as is often stated in articles about Darger. Paroubek's disappearance and murder, her funeral, and the subsequent investigation, were the subjects of a huge amount of coverage in the Daily News and other papers at the time. This newspaper photo was part of a growing personal archive of clippings Darger had been gathering. There is no indication that the murder or the news photo and article had any particular significance for Darger, until one day he could not find it. Writing in his journal at the time, he began to process this forfeiture of yet another child, lamenting that \\"the huge disaster and calamity\\" of his loss \\"will never be atoned for\\", but \\"shall be avenged to the uttermost limit\\".Bonesteel, Michael, 2000:10 According to his autobiography, Darger believed the photo was among several items that were stolen when his locker at work was broken into. He never found his copy of the photograph again. Because he could not remember the exact date of its publication, he could not locate it in the newspaper archive. He carried out an elaborate series of novenas and other prayers for the picture to be returned. The fictive war that was sparked by Darger's loss of the newspaper photograph of Paroubek, whose killer was never found, became Darger's magnum opus. He had been working on some version of the novel before this time (he makes reference to an early draft which was also lost or stolen), but now it became an all- consuming creation. In The Realms of the Unreal, Paroubek is imagined as Annie Aronburg, the leader of the first child slave rebellion. \\"The assassination of the child labor rebel Annie Aronburg... was the most shocking child murder ever caused by the Glandelinian Government\\" and was the cause of the war. Through their sufferings, valiant deeds and exemplary holiness, the Vivian Girls are hoped to be able to help bring about a triumph of Christianity. Darger provided two endings to the story, one in which the Vivian Girls and Christianity are triumphant and another in which they are defeated and the godless Glandelinians reign. Darger's human figures were rendered largely by tracing, collage, or photo enlargement from popular magazines and children's books (much of the \\"trash\\" he collected was old magazines and newspapers, which he clipped for source material). Some of his favorite figures were the Coppertone Girl and Little Annie Rooney. He is praised for his natural gift for composition and the brilliant use of color in his watercolors. The images of daring escapes, mighty battles, and painful torture are reminiscent not only of contemporaneous epic films such as The Birth of a Nation (which Darger might easily have seen) Darger's known and possible artistic inspirations are discussed at some length. Darger's own art collection ‚Äì including pictures he cut out of magazines and worked into collages ‚Äì on display at the American Folk Art Museum in New York. but of events in Catholic history; the text makes it clear that the child victims are heroic martyrs like the early saints. Art critic Michael Moon explains Darger's images of tortured children in terms of popular Catholic culture and iconography. These included martyr pageants and Catholic comic books with detailed, often gory tales of innocent female victims. He gives a detailed description of mass-produced Catholic folk art known as l'art Saint-Sulpice which Darger would have been familiar with from childhood. One idiosyncratic feature of Darger's artwork is its depiction of apparently transgender characters. Many of his girl subjects are shown to have penises when unclothed or partially clothed. Darger biographer Jim Elledge speculates that this represents a reflection of Darger's own childhood issues with sexual identity and homosexuality. Darger's second novel, Crazy House, deals with these subjects more explicitly. In a paraphrase of the Declaration of Independence, Darger wrote of children's right \\"to play, to be happy, and to dream, the right to normal sleep of the night's season, the right to an education, that we may have an equality of opportunity for developing all that are in us of mind and heart.\\" Crazy House: Further Adventures in Chicago A second work of fiction, provisionally titled Crazy House: Further Adventures in Chicago, contains over 10,000 handwritten pages. Written after The Realms, it takes that epic's major characters‚Äîthe seven Vivian sisters and their companion/secret brother, Penrod‚Äîand places them in Chicago, with the action unfolding during the same years as that of the earlier book. Begun in 1939, it is a tale of a house that is possessed by demons and haunted by ghosts, or has an evil consciousness of its own. Children disappear into the house and are later found brutally murdered. The Vivians and Penrod are sent to investigate and discover that the murders are the work of evil ghosts. The girls go about exorcising the place, but have to resort to arranging for a full-scale Holy Mass to be held in each room before the house is clean. They do this repeatedly, but it never works. The narrative ends mid-scene, with Darger having just been rescued from the Crazy House. The History of My Life In 1968, Darger became interested in tracing some of his frustrations back to his childhood and began writing The History of My Life. Spanning eight volumes, the book only spends 206 pages detailing Darger's early life before veering off into 4,672 pages of fiction about a huge twister called \\"Sweetie Pie\\", probably based on memories of a tornado he had witnessed in 1908. Posthumous fame and influence American Folk Art Museum Darger's landlords, Nathan and Kiyoko Lerner, came across his work shortly before his death, a day after his birthday, on April 13, 1973. Nathan Lerner, an accomplished photographer whose long career, the New York Times wrote, \\"was inextricably bound up in the history of visual culture in Chicago,\\" immediately recognized the artistic merit of Darger's work. By this time Darger was in St. Augustine's, operated by the Little Sisters of the Poor, where his father had died. The Lerners took charge of the Darger estate, publicizing his work and contributing to projects such as the 2004 documentary In the Realms of the Unreal. In cooperation with Kiyoko Lerner, Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art dedicated the Henry Darger Room Collection in 2008 as part of its permanent collection. Darger has become internationally recognized thanks to the efforts of the people who salvaged his work. After Nathan Lerner's death in 1997, Kiyoko became the sole figure in charge of both her husband's and Darger's estates. The U.S. copyright representative for the Estate of Henry Darger and the Estate of Nathan Lerner is the Artists Rights Society. Darger is today one of the most famous figures in the history of outsider art. At the Outsider Art Fair, held every January in New York City, and at auction, his work is among the highest-priced of any self-taught artist. The American Folk Art Museum in New York opened a Henry Darger Study Center in 2001. His work now commands upwards of $750,000. In popular culture Since his death in 1973 and the discovery of his magnum opus, and especially since the 1990s, there have been many references in popular culture to Darger's work by other visual artists including, but not limited to, artists of comics and graphic novels; numerous popular songs; a 1999 book-length poem, Girls on the Run, by John Ashbery; a multi-player online game, Sissyfight 2000, and a 2004 multimedia piece by choreographer Pat Graney incorporating Darger images. Jesse Kellerman's 2008 novel The Genius took part of its inspiration from Darger's story. Mike Walker and Judith Kampfner's radio play Darger and the Detective, performed by the Steppenwolf Theatre Company for BBC Radio, focuses on Darger's obsessions and a police detective investigating the disappearance of Elsie Paroubek. Charlie Kaufman's 2020 novel Antkind includes several references to Darger. These artists have variously drawn from and responded to Darger's artistic style, his themes (especially the Vivian Girls, the young heroines of Darger's massive illustrated novel), and the events in his life. Jessica Yu's 2004 documentary In the Realms of the Unreal details Darger's life and artworks. Another documentary, Revolutions of the Night by Mark Stokes, looks at Darger's early life and examines lesser-known works by the artist. Comic book artist Scott McCloud refers to Darger's work in his book Making Comics, while describing the danger artists encounter in the creation of a character's back- story. McCloud says that complicated narratives can easily spin out of control when too much unseen information is built up around the characters. Darger and his work have been an inspiration for several music artists. The Vivian Girls are an all-girl indie/punk trio from Brooklyn; \\"Henry Darger\\" is a song by Natalie Merchant on her album Motherland, \\"Vivian Girls\\" is song by the band Wussy on their album Left for Dead. \\"The Vivian Girls Are Visited in the Night by Saint Dargarius and His Squadron of Benevolent Butterflies\\" is a song by Sufjan Stevens on his album The Avalanche: Outtakes and Extras from the Illinois Album, \\"The Story of the Vivian Girls\\" is a song by Comet Gain on their 2005 album City Fallen Leaves, and \\"Segue: In the Realms of the Unreal\\" is song by the band ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead on their album So Divided, \\"The Vivian Girls\\" is a 1979 song by Snakefinger (Philip Lithman Roth) also recorded by the Monks of Doom on their album The Cosmodemonic Telegraph Company, \\"Vivian Girls\\" is a song by the band Fucked Up on their album Hidden World, and \\"Lost Girls\\" (about Darger's work) is a song by Tilly and the Wall on their album Bottoms of Barrels. On their 1994 album Triple Mania II, San Diego's industrial noise performance outfit Crash Worship reworked several Darger images and screen printed them on a copper foil foldout discfolio; as well as the insert and disc. In 2011, Majical Cloudz released \\"Childhood's End\\", a haunting song influenced by Darger's later life. New York jazz pianist Sam Harris's 2014 album Interludes includes a song entitled \\"The Hermit Darger\\". The song \\"April 8th\\" by indie rock band Neutral Milk Hotel, from their debut studio album On Avery Island, has also been suggested to be heavily inspired by Darger's life, especially on his later years of extreme social reclusion; April 8th was the date on which Elsie Paroubek went missing, and the song appears to imagine a fictional meeting between Paroubek and Darger. French pop rock and new wave band Indochine paid tribute to Henry Darger in writing the song \\"Henry Darger\\" available on their studio album 13 released in September 2017. Darger is referenced by the character Sergeant Hatred in the cartoon The Venture Bros. in season 4, episode 6 \\"Self-Medication\\". Darger appears as a major supporting character in Elizabeth Hand's novel Curious Toys, set around Chicago's Riverview Park in 1915. Collections and exhibits Darger's works are included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the American Folk Art Museum in New York, Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Collection de l'art brut, the Walker Art Center, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, High Museum of Art, and the Lille M√©tropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art in Villeneuve d'Ascq, and the Museum of Old and New Art, in Tasmania; Australia. Darger's art also has been featured in many notable museum exhibitions, including \\"The Unreality of Being\\" exhibit curated by Stephen Prokopoff. It was also seen in \\"Disasters of War\\" (P.S. 1, New York, 2000), where it was presented alongside prints from the famous Francisco Goya series The Disasters of War and works derived from these by the British contemporary-art duo Jake and Dinos Chapman. Darger's work has also been shown at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Setagaya Art Museum, and the Collection de l'art brut, La Maison Rouge, Museum Kunstpalast, Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de Lille-M√©tropole, and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. In 2008, the exhibition at the American Folk Art Museum, titled \\"Dargerism: Contemporary Artists and Henry Darger\\", examined the influence of Darger's ≈ìuvre on 11 artists, including Trenton Doyle Hancock, Robyn O'Neil and Amy Cutler, who were responding not only to the aesthetic nature of Darger's mythic work ‚Äì with its tales of good versus evil, its epic scope and complexity, and its transgressive undertone ‚Äì but also to his driven work ethic and all-consuming devotion to artmaking. Also in 2008, Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art in Chicago opened its permanent exhibit of the Henry Darger Room Collection, an installation that meticulously recreates the small northside Chicago apartment where Darger lived and made his art.

It was the Ontario provincial branch of the United Farmers movement of the early part of the 20th century. History=Foundation and rise (1914-1919) Ernest C. Drury, UFO premier and leader The UFO was founded in 1914 by the union of various farmers' organizations that had been created over the previous fifteen years.Macpherson, Ian, \\"United Farmers of Ontario\\", The Canadian Encyclopedia James J. Morrison was the leading figure in the party, serving as its general secretary and secretary of the United Farmers Co-operative Company Ltd. (the purchasing co-operative the UFO operated on behalf of its members). The organization grew rapidly and by 1917 it had 350 local clubs and 12,000 members.http://www.nfu.ca/ont-1.pdf The UFO had a comprehensive farmer's platform that called for the nationalization of railways, progressive taxation, and legislation that would facilitate the operation of co-operatives. In 1917, supporters of the UFO formed the Farmers' Publishing Company and purchased The Weekly Sun renaming it The Farmer's Sun to act as the organ of the UFO. The UFO entered politics by contesting and winning a by-election in Manitoulin in 1918, in which Beniah Bowman was elected as the party's first Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). In the 1919 provincial election, with over 50,000 members, the party sought to hold the balance of power so it could introduce legislation friendly to farmers. It co-operated with the Independent Labour Party with the two organizations not running candidates against each other - the UFO contested rural ridings and the ILP stood candidates in urban areas. In total there were 64 UFO candidates, 20 ILP candidates and 10 Farmer-Labour candidates in the 1919 provincial election. The UFO platform called for the abolition of political patronage, better educational opportunities in rural areas, cheap electric power, conservation of forests, proportional representation and \\"direct legislation\\". The UFO also favoured prohibition and budgetary restraint, two platform planks that were at odds with the views of urban Labour supporters. To the shock of everyone, including itself, it won 45 seats and formed a coalition government with the support of Labour MLAs in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario despite having no leader. As the United Farmers began as a single-issue party, Morrison opposed forming a government, believing that the party should concern itself solely with agricultural issues and that it would not be able to represent the entire province. Furthermore, he viewed the Independent Labour Party as inimical to farmers' interests and opposed a coalition with them to form a majority government. Morrison was offered the position of UFO caucus leader and Premier of Ontario following the election but declined as did Sir Adam Beck; the position instead went Ernest C. Drury. Forming the government (1919-1923) Despite Morrison's objections, the UFO joined with 10 Independent Labour Party MLAs (an 11th ILP MLA, Morrison MacBride, broke with his colleagues and sat in Opposition) and one Independent to form a coalition government, with Drury as Premier and two of the ILP MLAs in the cabinet.Labour and Farmers in Ontario 1919 - 1932, History of the NDP, accessed February 13, 2008 Morrison remained outside of the legislature and government as the general secretary of the UFO. Morrison opposed a number of the coalition's initiatives, perceiving the UFO's actions as a broad-based Progressive government rather than a \\"class-based\\" United Farmer government and believed that the party should not be in government but should hold the balance of power in order to force the government of the day to pass pro- farmer legislation. Drury's Farmer-Labour government created the first Department of Welfare for the province and brought in allowances for widows and children, a minimum wage for women and standardized adoption procedures.\\"Free-trader, writer and farmer, former Premier E.C. Drury dies\\" Globe and Mail, February 19, 1968 His government also expanded Ontario Hydro and promoted rural electification, created the Province of Ontario Savings Office - a provincially owned bank that lent money to farmers at a lower rate - began the first major reforestation program in North America, and began construction of the modern highway system. The government was also a strict enforcer of temperance measures. Drury also arranged for a grant for unknown researchers Frederick Banting and Charles Best who later discovered insulin. The UFO grew quickly to 1,500 clubs and 60,000 members by 1920. The government under Drury tried to be a \\"people's government\\" rather than a \\"class government\\" and argued for a \\"broadening out\\" of the party to include labour and others, but in so doing, alienated the base of the government's support, particularly farmers. The UFO government clashed with the UFO organization (led by James J. Morrison) which eventually withdrew its support from the government. The party's farmer base turned away from the party. By the time another election came around, in 1923, the economy had improved, in part due to the government's decision. The Drury government lost most of their seats in the election of 1923. Seventeen United Farmer and four Labour members returned to the Legislature, compared to 75 Conservatives. Drury lost his own seat. Decline (1923-1929) Harry Nixon, the last leader of the Progressives. Though the United Farmers of Ontario remained the second largest party in the legislature, they were denied Official Opposition status by Conservative premier Howard Ferguson. The position was instead given to the Liberals with W.E.N. Sinclair as Leader of the Opposition, despite the party having three fewer seats than the UFO. Morrison had announced that the UFO would be withdrawing from politics, which Ferguson had used as justification for the move. Manning Doherty, interim leader of the UFO caucus, could do nothing aside from win a ruling from the Speaker that, as leader of a caucus of more than 15 MLAs, he was entitled to an extra salary.Oliver, Peter G. Howard Ferguson: Ontario Tory, Toronto and Buffalo: University of Toronto Press, 1977, p. 158 Eighteen months following the general election, William Raney was elected unanimously by his caucus as leader of what was now referred to as the \\"Progressive\\" bloc of MLAs which had begun as Farmer and Labour MLAs. Leslie Oke and Beniah Bowman refused to accept the leadership of Raney, a non-farmer, and also disagreed with the creation of a \\"Progressive Party\\" which would include non-farmers - with the support of The Farmer's Sun, they insisted on continuing to sit as UFO members rather than with the Progressive group. Bowman resigned from the legislature in 1926 in order to enter federal politics. The issue which dominated Ontario politics in the mid 1920s was the Ferguson government's proposal to repeal the Ontario Temperance Act and replace prohibition with government control of liquor. The Liberals, were split on the issue - most of their MLAs were \\"dry\\" but some were \\"wets\\" who were opposed to prohibition. The Progressives under Raney, however, were adamantly in favour of prohibition and opposed to Ferguson's proposals. This led to an estrangement with Labour MLA Karl Homuth who supported Ferguson's proposals and would eventually join the Conservatives. The 1926 provincial election reduced the farmer-labour contingent to thirteen Progressive MLAs and one Labour MLA (Homuth - who had broken with the Progressives and supported the government) while two new UFO MLAs, Thomas Farquhar and Farquhar Oliver joined Oke's faction. Several weeks after the election the UFO convention voted to cease running its own candidates though a handful of local UFO clubs continued to nominate candidates for some years. End of the movement (1927-1940) Farquhar Oliver, last UFO MLA in the provincial legislature. Raney resigned from the legislature the next year in order to accept an appointment to the Supreme Court of Ontario and 72-year-old John Giles Lethbridge was chosen as the new leader of the Progressives. In the 1929 election, only five Progressives, one Labour and one UFO MLA won re-election. Lethbridge, like Raney in the previous election, campaigned largely on the issue of prohibition. After Lethbridge lost his seat in the 1929 election Harry Nixon, who had served as Provincial Secretary in Drury's government, became the leader of the remaining Progressives. In the early 1930s, Nixon and the Progressives agreed to an alliance with former UFO activist Mitchell Hepburn who, in 1930, became leader of the Liberal Party. A group of four Liberal-Progressive MLAs, led by Nixon, were elected in the 1934 election, who joined Hepburn to form a government and were eventually absorbed into the Liberal Party. (see Liberal-Progressives (Ontario) for more information) In 1932, leading UFO member Agnes Macphail (originally elected to the Progressive Party) encouraged the UFO to affiliate with Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) when it was formed. It did so, and MacPhail became the first Chairman of the Ontario CCF in 1932, but the UFO disaffiliated from the CCF in 1934 due to allegations of communist influence in the party. The UFO nominated candidates, incumbent MLA Farquhar Oliver and former MLA Leslie Oke, accordingly ran as UFO candidates in the 1934 provincial election rather than as CCFers. The UFO, like United Farmers groups in the provinces of western Canada, decided to withdraw entirely from electoral politics though Oliver and Macphail continued to run under the UFO banner until 1940. Many United Farmers joined the CCF as individuals. The UFO's newspaper, The Farmer's Sun, was sold to Graham Spry and Alan Plaunt and became an organ for the League for Social Reconstruction and the Ontario CCF. In the 1935 federal election, the UFO's provincial executive voted to endorse the new Reconstruction Party of Canada formed by H.H. Stevens, however many local UFO groups backed the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation\\"Liberals busy, CCF active, other factions hold fire\\", Toronto Daily Star, July 19, 1935 and UFO MP Agnes MacPhail continued to work with the CCF on an informal basis. Other UFOers backed the Liberals. The Reconstruction Party won 11% of the vote in Ontario in the 1935 federal election, more than the CCF, but failed to win a seat in the province and only won one seat nationally. In 1936, the UFO, the United Farmers‚Äô Co-operative Ltd., and various growers and other agricultural organizations formed the Ontario Chamber of Agriculture which, in 1940, became the Ontario Federation of Agriculture (OFA), a non-partisan lobbying and marketing organization for farmers. In 1943, the UFO ceased to exist as a formal organization and its remnants were absorbed by the OFA. In 1948 the United Farmers' Co-operative became the United Co-operatives of Ontario and remains one of the largest farmer-owned co-operatives in Canada. In 1940, Oliver, the last remaining UFO member of the Legislature and a supporter of the Hepburn government since 1934, joined the Hepburn cabinet and became a Liberal. MacPhail lost her seat as the last United Farmers MP in the House of Commons in the 1940 election. She turned to provincial politics and won election to the Ontario Legislature as a candidate of the CCF in the 1943 provincial election while Oliver became Liberal Party leader in 1945. United Farmers Co-operative Company Grocers Around 1919, the UFO hired Theodore Loblaw to help launch a chain of cooperative grocery stores, but the attempt failed and Loblaw left to start his own grocery chain.

It takes place in Chicago in the summer of 1968. It was notable for Wexler's use of cin√©ma v√©rit√©-style documentary filmmaking techniques, as well as for combining fictional and non-fictional content. The movie was met with widespread acclaim from numerous critics, including Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel of Siskel & Ebert, both calling the movie a \\"well- crafted masterpiece.\\" The movie was also named one of the greatest movies of 1969, as well as one of the most influential movies in the New Hollywood movement. Robert Forster was also met with universal acclaim for his performance. In 2003, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot John Cassellis is a television news cameraman. He and his sound recorder dispassionately film images of car accidents rather than help the victims. Cassellis is seemingly hardened to ethical and social issues; he is more concerned with his personal life and pursuing audience-grabbing stories. Yet once Cassellis finds out that his news station has been providing the stories and information gathered by the cameramen and news journalists to the FBI, he becomes enraged. The news station creates an excuse to fire him, but he soon finds another job free- lancing at the Democratic National Convention. In the course of his television job, Cassellis meets Eileen, a single mother, and her son, Harold, who have moved from West Virginia to Chicago. Harold tells a woman canvassing the neighborhood that his father, Buddy, is \\"at Vietnam\\", but later tells Cassellis that he just took off one day and never came back. Eileen tells Cassellis that \\"Buddy is dead.\\" Cassellis grows fond of them both, mother and son. When Harold goes missing, Eileen goes to the site of the convention to ask Cassellis for help. She finds herself in the midst of the riots. After witnessing acts of police brutality, Eileen finds Cassellis. As they drive to an undisclosed location, unaware that Harold has returned home, Cassellis accidentally crashes the car into a tree, killing Eileen and critically injuring himself. A passing driver stops to photograph the accident, after which he leaves the heavily damaged car behind.  Cast  * Robert Forster as John Cassellis * Verna Bloom as Eileen * Peter Bonerz as Gus * Marianna Hill as Ruth * Harold Blankenship as Harold * Charles Geary as Harold's father * Sid McCoy as Frank Baker * Christine Bergstrom as Dede * Peter Boyle as Gun clinic manager * China Lee as Roller derby patron Production The title comes from Marshall McLuhan's work in which he described TV as a \\"cool\\" medium. The \\"cooler\\" the medium, \\"the more someone has to uncover and engage in the media\\" in order to \\"fill in the blanks.\\" The film questions the role and responsibilities of television and its newscasts. The music in the film was assembled by guitarist Mike Bloomfield (Haskell Wexler's cousin). The film features contemporary music from the early Mothers of Invention albums by rock musician Frank Zappa, as well as the Love instrumental \\"Emotions\\" over the opening credits and as a recurring theme. Wexler has said the scene under the opening credits with the bike messenger delivering film to the television station was inspired by Jean Cocteau's film, Orpheus. Harold Blankenship, who played the young boy Harold in Medium Cool, was tracked down by filmmaker Paul Cronin (who made the documentary Look out Haskell, it's real) and appears in Cronin's film Sooner or Later. Blankenship named his first son after Haskell Wexler. Historical context Shot at a time of great social and political counterculture upheaval in the United States, Wexler's film reflects the conflicted nature of a country divided by issues of race, gender, poverty, crime, and war. Such themes were touched upon by more mainstream films such as Getting Straight and The Strawberry Statement, but Wexler's treatment was considered highly controversial ‚Äì the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system gave it an 'X' rating. The censors \\"objected to the language and the nudity\\", Wexler said later; \\"What no one had the nerve to say was that it was a political 'X'\\".Cronin, 2001. In 1970 the film was re-rated 'R'. Critical response Much critical response to Medium Cool focused around the revolutionary techniques of combining fact and fiction rather than the plot of the film. In his 1969 review, Roger Ebert wrote \\"In Medium Cool, Wexler forges back and forth through several levels...There are fictional characters in real situations...there are real characters in fictional situations\\".Ebert, 1969. While Ebert did not find the plot to be particularly innovative, he acknowledged that Wexler purposely left it up to his audience to fill in the gaps of the romance, and at the same time presented images of great political significance. Ultimately, Ebert credited Wexler with masterfully combining multiple levels of filmmaking to create a film that is \\"important and absorbing\\". Ebert placed the film second on his list of the 10 best pictures of 1969.Ebert's 10 Best Lists: 1967-present. Chicago Sun-Times via the Internet Archive. Retrieved March 17, 2013. Similarly, in his 1969 review of the film for The New York Times, Vincent Canby credits Wexler with presenting his audience with powerful imagery through the use of documentary filmmaking techniques. He wrote that Medium Cool was \\"an angry, technically brilliant movie that uses some of the real events of last year the way other movies use real places ‚Äî as backgrounds that are extensions of the fictional characters.\\"Canby, 1969. Like Ebert, Canby pointed out that the political atmosphere of the film fills in the blanks left open by a relatively superficial plot. Furthermore, Canby noted the film's historical significance: \\"The result is a film of tremendous visual impact, a kind of cinematic Guernica, a picture of America in the process of exploding into fragmented bits of hostility, suspicion, fear and violence.\\" Like Ebert, Canby felt that the real significance of the film was in its capturing of a specific political situation rather than its conventional success through plot and character development. Canby wrote: \\"Medium Cool is an awkward and even pretentious movie, but... it has an importance that has nothing to do with literature.\\" See also * List of American films of 1969 *Prologue, a 1970 Canadian film that also blends cin√©ma v√©rit√©-style documentary and fiction, set against the Democratic National Convention References=Sources * Arthur, Paul (2002). \\"Medium Cool.\\" Cineaste Vol. 27 No. 3 (Summer 2002), pp. 45‚Äì46. * Canby, Vincent (1969). \\"Real Events of '68 Seen in 'Medium Cool'\\", The New York Times, August 28, 1969. * Cronin, Paul (2001). \\"Mid Summer Mavericks,\\" Sight and Sound, September 2001: 24-27. * Roger Ebert's 1969 review of Medium Cool External links  'Look out Haskell, it's real': The Making of Medium Cool, a 2001 documentary about Medium Cool *Medium Cool: Preserving Disorder an essay by Thomas Beard at the Criterion Collection Category:1969 films Category:1969 drama films Category:American films Category:American political drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Haskell Wexler Category:Films about journalists Category:Films about television Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films shot in Chicago Category:United States National Film Registry films Category:Films set in 1968 Category:Films about elections Category:1968 Democratic National Convention Category:American neo-noir films ","title":"Medium Cool"},{"id":"466614","title":"List of deaths by motorcycle crash"},{"id":"466615","title":"Wreckx-n-Effect"},{"id":"466618","title":"Type 45 destroyer"},{"id":"466621","text":"The British Helsinki Human Rights Group was an Oxford-based non-governmental organization which claimed to monitor human rights in the 56 participating States of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Despite its name, the organisation was not affiliated to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights. BHHRG was critical of what it characterized as Western interference in imposing democracy, and claimed to support the right of political independence from the west of a number of Communist and post- Communist regimes, as well as of a number of African dictators. The group also used the name OSCEwatch, indicating that it saw part of its mission as scrutinising the activities of the OSCE. The OSCEwatch and BHHRG websites are identical, and both websites openly refer to each other. The British Charity Commission removed the group's listing in September 2010, noting \\"Ceased to exist\\". Membership and funding The BHHRG was founded in 1992. It was run from the Oxford home of historian Professor Norman Stone, who on occasion took part in BHHRG activities, and was co-founded by his wife Christine Stone and fellow Oxford historian Mark Almond (who was also its chairman). Its trustees comprised Mark Almond, Anthony Daniels (who writes for the Daily Telegraph under the pseudonym Theodore Dalrymple), John Laughland, Christine Stone and Mary Walsh. Almond, Daniels, Laughland and Stone were members of Britain's conservative intelligentsia and regular contributors to British newspapers. Chad Nagle, an American lawyer who frequently contributes to the website antiwar.com, was also associated with the group. Noel Malcolm, a historian of early modern Britain and Europe who in the 1990s and early 2000s wrote books on aspects of Balkan history, appeared on a 1994 list of founders and spoke on its behalf in 1999 but later apparently left the group. The BHHRG was not an \\"official\\" Helsinki Committee, as it was not affiliated with the Helsinki Committees' umbrella organisation, the then International Helsinki Federation (IHF). The United Kingdom's representative in the IHF was the British Helsinki Subcommittee of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group, established in 1976. This led to the BHHRG being mistakenly labelled the British Helsinki Committee, which prompted the British Helsinki Subcommittee to ask visitors to its website to :\\"PLEASE NOTE that the so-called British Helsinki Group is NOT affiliated with the IHF\\" . For its part, the BHHRG website said nothing on the subject. The membership, management and funding of the BHHRG were somewhat obscure. These aspects did not appear to be discussed at all on its website, and the details of its trustees were given only in its legally required returns to the UK's Charity Commission. Its published accounts stated that it received ¬£417,332 in income between 1997‚Äì2003 and spent ¬£449,086 in the same period. The organisation later appeared to fall on hard times, with its funding falling by nearly 99% after 2001. A possible reason was suggested by The Economist, which reported in 2004 that :\\"the group lost almost all its supporters when it threw its weight behind people like Mr Milo≈°eviƒá.\\" \\"Yanukovich's friends\\", The Economist page 30, 4 December 2004 The identity of its backers was also unclear. Still with them in 1999, Noel Malcolm explained that the group does not disclose its donors :\\"for obvious reason[s]: they [critics] would then start to campaign [against the group] with the financial backers.\\" War of the Monitors ‚Äì Transitions Online. Tol.cz. Retrieved on 2011-03-13. Only a few contributors were known by name. Material that the BHHRG issued in 1992 cited the UKIP (then-Tory) peer Lord Pearson of Rannoch and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation as donors. The BHHRG's \\"About Us\\" page stated that it \\"does not receive funding from any government\\" but, according to a Foreign Office source, it received money from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for an election observer mission in 1995. The source said funding was cut off because they found the group prejudiced, partial and unreliable.Transitions Online. Tol.cz. Retrieved on 2011-03-13. It subsequently received no funding from this source and its advocates said this proved the group was independent of governments. Activities The BHHRG website claimed that the main activities of the Group included: * Monitoring the conduct of elections in OSCE member states. * Examining issues relating to press freedom and freedom of speech * Reporting on conditions in prisons and psychiatric institutions * Covering asylum and immigration issues The BHHRG published reports from first-hand observers, concentrating on election monitoring in central and eastern Europe, as well as publishing frequent unsigned commentaries (just like the Economist does) about events in the region. A common theme in many of its publications was a critical view of Western \\"meddling in the internal affairs\\" of central and east European countries, notably the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Belarus. Among its achievements the BHHRG's website claimed: * 1992 ‚Äì BHHRG was the first NGO to expose the human rights situation in the former Soviet republic of Georgia * 1993 ‚Äì BHHRG exposure of fraud in the conduct of Russia's constitutional referendum was later admitted by the authorities. * 1996 ‚Äì BHHRG report of election fraud in Armenia's presidential election was only acknowledged in 1998 * 1998 ‚Äì BHHRG predicted war in Kosovo in late February (after US envoy Robert Gelbard called the Kosovo Albanian separatist KLA a 'terrorist group') * 1999 ‚Äì BHHRG was the first human rights group to visit the notorious Sangatte camp for asylum seekers in France * 2001 ‚Äì BHHRG exposed the scandal of trafficking in women from Moldova Most controversial aspects The media connections of some of BHHRG members (especially John Laughland, a self-avowed conspiracy theorist and passionate advocate of \\"national sovereignty\\") enabled it to propagate its views through a number of major newspapers in Britain and the US. Yet it became famous only when it publicly denounced what were widely perceived as democratic movements against authoritarian former Communist rulers. Among actions critics of the BHHRG find ill-advised: * The BHHRG based part of a Latvia report on an interview with Alfreds Rubiks, the Communist who led the \\"National Salvation Committee\\" which would have co-ordinated repression had the coup against Gorbachev not failed in 1991.at.

Some of the BHHRG's statements were favorably quoted by the isolationist right in the US, by opponents of US foreign policy, as well as governments regarded by Western authorities as authoritarian and criminal, such as that of Belarus. Its critics accused the BHHRG of taking a predetermined ideological line while observing elections. A British Foreign Office official quoted by Jeremy Druker said of them: :\\"It was very clear that they had their own agenda. They also monitored the elections in Georgia in 1995, and it would appear Almond and his people had made up their minds about the election report even before the election had taken place. People at the time were not happy with the way that they monitored the election‚Ä¶ they didn't set out in an impartial spirit.\\" The BHHRG was almost always more critical of social-democratic than nationalist rulers. The Economist characterises the BHHRG's opinion as \\"an intense dislike of liberal internationalism.\\" Tom Palmer of the libertarian Cato Institute summarizes their position as being that :the mass movements to unseat [governments in eastern Europe] are nothing but stooges for the west, out to integrate those brave little authoritarian-socialist regimes into the 'New World Order,' privatize their state industries, and strip them of their assets. The BHHRG's commentaries indeed alleged that Western governments and international organisations were seeking to implement a \\"New World Order\\" in central and eastern Europe. Its supporters claimed that the organisation exposes matters which Western governments and biased international organisations such as the UN and the OSCE had rather remained unknown. For instance, it claimed it denounced human rights abuses committed in Georgia while these were ignored by the OSCE and the Council of Europe. Mark Almond, who has written on Balkan matters,Bosnian Institute ‚Äì Selected Long Reviews . Bosnia.org.uk. Retrieved on 2011-03-13. criticised the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia on behalf of Albanian separatists in Kosovo as a \\"violation of international law\\" which resulted in \\"cultural genocide\\" against Serbs. As self-proclaimed monitors of Human Rights in the countries concerned, they accused other intergovernmental organisations of being undemocratic, unelected, unaccountable, non-transparent meddlers in their internal affairs. The OSCE criticized the BHHRG for letting its journalists pose as impartial election monitors while publishing partisan polemics in newspapers, and for relying on short-term observer missions with a handful of people, an approach the OSCE abandoned as open to manipulation in 1996. (The OSCE now uses large-scale long-term missions of four to six weeks with dozens of experts and hundreds of observers.Letter of the week. New Statesman (2002-04-01). Retrieved on 2011-03-13.) The BHHRG dismissed the OSCE's position as an attempt to stifle legitimate criticism and independent reporting. Name issues The BHHRG was also denounced for failing to mention that it enjoyed no recognition from the International Helsinki Federation, but was at odds with other organizations with similar names, at least since 1996. The International Helsinki Federation (IHF) felt the need to issue a public statement disclaiming any connection with the group. The Greek National Committee of the said Federation, which has been effective throughout the Balkans, also published a press release to denounce what it felt was the BHHRG's impostures, while others accused it of \\"nam[ing] itself so as to usurp the prestige of its elder\\".Powered by: Doteasy ‚Äì Bannerless Free Web Hosting and Email for Small Business and Individual.

This report caused me to question my previously held beliefs. However, I have since learned that the BHHRG has no connection to the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights in Vienna.

He was posthumously promoted to the rank of brigadier general by Polish President Andrzej Duda. Kukli≈Ñski passed top secret Soviet documents to the CIA between 1972 and 1981, including the Soviet plans for the invasion of Western Europe. The former United States National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezi≈Ñski described him as \\"the first Polish officer in NATO.\\" Biography Kukli≈Ñski was born in Warsaw to a working- class family with strong Catholic and socialist traditions. During World War II, his father became a member of the Polish resistance movement; he was captured by the Gestapo, and subsequently died in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. After the war, Kukli≈Ñski began a successful career in the Polish People's Army. In 1968, he took part in preparations for the Warsaw Pact's invasion of Czechoslovakia. Disturbed by the invasion, and by the brutal crushing of the parallel Polish 1970 protests, in 1972, Kukli≈Ñski sent a letter to the US embassy in Bonn describing himself as an army officer from a Communist country, and requested a secret meeting.Rupert Cornwell, Ryszard Kuklinski: Cold War spy for the West The Independent 13 February 2004. Cached by info-poland.buffalo.edu. In 1994, Kukli≈Ñski said that his awareness of the \\"unambiguously offensive\\" nature of Soviet military plans was an important factor in his decision to communicate the details of those plans to the United States, adding that \\"Our front could only be a sacrifice of Polish blood at the altar of the Red Empire\\".Marat Miklszewski, \\"Colonel Kuklinski Speaks!\\", Tygodnik Solidarno≈õƒá, 9 December 1994, p. 12 Kukli≈Ñski was also concerned that his homeland would be turned into a nuclear wasteland as the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional forces would mean NATO would respond to military action with tactical nuclear weapons. Between 1972 and 1981, he passed 35,000 pages of mostly Soviet secret documents to the CIA. The documents described Moscow's strategic plans regarding the use of nuclear weapons, technical data about the T-72 tank and 9K31 Strela-1 missiles, the whereabouts of Soviet anti-aircraft bases in Poland and East Germany, the methods used by the Soviets to avoid spy satellite detection of their military hardware, plans for the imposition of martial law in Poland, and many other matters.

Kukli≈Ñski, his wife and two sons were spirited out of Poland by the CIA shortly before the imposition of martial law in December 1981. Though Kukli≈Ñski and his family successfully defected, his past may have followed him to the United States as both of his sons later died in separate incidents. The older, Waldemar, was run over by a truck without a licence plate in August 1994 on the grounds of an American university. His younger son, Bogdan Kukli≈Ñski, drowned on 31st December 1993, when his yacht capsized on a quiet sea. Ryszard Kukli≈Ñski did not claim that they were assassinated by the KGB, but never rejected such a possibility either. On May 23, 1984, Kukli≈Ñski was sentenced to death, in absentia, by a military court in Warsaw. After the fall of communism, the sentence was changed to 25 years. In 1995, the court revoked the sentence and said that Kukli≈Ñski was acting under special circumstances. Kukli≈Ñski visited Poland again in April 1998. Death He died from a stroke at the age of 73 in Tampa, Florida, February 11, 2004. The funeral Mass for Kukli≈Ñski was held at Fort Myer with CIA honors on March 30, 2004. His remains were transported to Poland and on June 19, 2004, Kukli≈Ñski was buried in the row of honour in the PowƒÖzki military cemetery in Warsaw, Poland, along with the remains of his son Waldemar.Colonel's Kukli≈Ñski's grave at the honour row of the PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery in Warsaw Legacy In June 1986, a spokesman for the Soviet-backed Jaruzelski regime, Jerzy Urban, revealed Kukli≈Ñski's existence to the world in order to make the argument that the Reagan administration had been informed by Kukli≈Ñski of the plans to install martial law but had betrayed the Solidarity movement by not passing that information on to its \\"friends\\" in Solidarity. When the journal Kultura interviewed Kukli≈Ñski, he said that planning for martial law had begun in late 1980 and that the Jaruzelski group planned to crush Solidarity regardless of the outcome of negotiations with the trade union and the Polish church. He also rejected the regime's claim that declaring martial law was an internal decision by describing how the Soviets had applied pressure on Polish authorities to impose martial law. When asked whether Jaruzelski was a hero or a traitor, Kukli≈Ñski replied: > My view has been consistently that in Poland there existed a real chance to > avoid both Soviet intervention and martial law. Had he, together with > Stanislaw Kania, proved capable of greater dignity and strength, had they > honestly adhered to the existing social agreements, instead of knuckling > under to Moscow, present-day Poland would undoubtedly look completely > different.Ryszard Kuklinski, \\"The Crushing of Solidarity,\\" Orbis 32:1 > (Winter 1988), p. 31 Kukli≈Ñski was the chief of a military strategic command planning division of the Polish army. He was very familiar with the layout of the Polish forces within the Warsaw Pact. While details of the general plans for the Warsaw Pact forces were known only in Moscow, Kukli≈Ñski could infer much from his contacts at the Moscow high command headquarters. According to President Carter's NSA, Zbigniew Brzezi≈Ñski, \\"Kukli≈Ñski's information permitted us to make counterplans to disrupt command-and-control facilities rather than only relying on a massive counterattack on forward positions, which would have hit Poland.\\"Andrew Nagorski, \\"All Is Forgiven, or Is It?,\\" Newsweek, 27 October 1997, p. 40 In January 2013, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Pasikowski began shooting a movie about Ryszard Kukli≈Ñski. With Marcin Doroci≈Ñski in the lead role, the script for Jack Strong (title taken from Kukli≈Ñski's CIA secret-agent pseudonym), written by director Pasikowski, is based on new material from the Polish Institute of National Remembrance archives, CIA operating documents and statements by eyewitnesses including David Forden, the former CIA operations officer who was the liaison with Colonel Kukli≈Ñski. Opinions in Poland A placard with a dedication to Ryszard Kukli≈Ñski in Warsaw. During his term as Poland's first freely elected president, a Solidarity leader, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, refused to pardon Kukli≈Ñski and a poll taken in 1998 found that more Poles (34%) considered Kukli≈Ñski a traitor than a hero (29%), with many undecided.Jane Perlez, \\"Spy Recounts Passing Data to CIA,\\" The New York Times, 30 April 1998 The administration of US President Clinton nonetheless took the stance that it would oppose Polish membership in NATO unless Kukli≈Ñski were exonerated.Benjamin Weiser, A Secret Life: The Polish Officer, His Covert Mission, and the Price He Paid to Save His Country (PublicAffairs, 2005). When all charges were dropped against Kukli≈Ñski in 1997, the left leaning Trybuna lamented that \\"Colonel Ryszard Kukli≈Ñski‚Äîa spy, deserter, and traitor‚Äîhas been turned into a model of virtue and a national hero of the rightists.\\"Mieczyclaw Wodzicki, \\"Treason Rewarded; 'Learn from This, Poles',\\" Trybuna, September 25, 1997, p. 5 In a 1997 survey conducted by the CBOS, 27 percent of Poles considered Kukli≈Ñski a hero and 24 percent a traitor (compared to 12 and 24 percent, respectively, in 1992). According to some historians, it was possible that Kukli≈Ñski was a double agent, of the Soviet GRU, used in an operational game with the CIA.Pawe≈Ç Wieczorkiewicz, Justyna B≈Ça≈ºejowska: Przez Polskƒô LudowƒÖ na prze≈Çaj i na przek√≥r (\\"Cross-country and oppositely through the People's Poland\\").

Historians, like Pawe≈Ç Wieczorkiewicz and Franciszek Pucha≈Ça (a general in the Polish Army during communist times) suggest, that the knowledge Kukli≈Ñski had was exaggerated, and while he had a lot of information about the Polish Army and the organization of the Warsaw Pact in general, he could not have had detailed information on Soviet plans, since no one in Poland had it. Pucha≈Ça supported his opinion in official hearings of Kukli≈Ñski by Polish prosecutors during his revised trial. Revealing plans about the enforcement of martial law in Poland, which would make a Soviet invasion unnecessary, could have been profitable for the Soviet side, ensuring that the USA would not be surprised by martial law and would not undertake unpredictable actions against the Soviets. It is noteworthy, that despite Kukli≈Ñski's revelations, the USA did not warn Solidarity about martial law. The Soviets took the escape of such an important spy nonchalantly and did not demand any consequences from the Polish politician responsible for intelligence, namely Czes≈Çaw Kiszczak. Also, the matter of Kukli≈Ñski's sons' deaths is unclear and they may have been part of a protection program; besides, according to Wieczorkiewicz, such revenge on a defector's family would be quite unusual for Soviet intelligence. Kukli≈Ñski is buried in the row of honour in the PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery in Warsaw, and he has been given honorary citizenship of several Polish cities, including Krak√≥w and Gda≈Ñsk. The Polish political group Centrum (at the time headed by Zbigniew Religa) requested in 2004 that the President of Poland posthumously promote Kukli≈Ñski to the rank of general. Since its unveiling in 2006, his monument in Krak√≥w had been vandalized three times by 2014: first on December 13, 2011, (the anniversary of martial law in Poland) and then on February 11, 2012 (the anniversary of Kukli≈Ñski's death). In both cases, the terms such as: \\"Traitor\\", the crossed CIA name and \\"Death to the USA\\" were sprayed. On February 11, 2014, his statue was found splashed with brown paint or oil.

MacDonald. McGee is neither a police officer nor a private investigator; instead, he is a self-described \\"salvage consultant\\" who recovers others' property for a fee of 50%. McGee appeared in 21 novels, from The Deep Blue Good-by in 1964 to The Lonely Silver Rain in 1984. In 1980, the McGee novel The Green Ripper won a National Book Award in a one-year Mystery category. All 21 books have the theme of a color in the title, one of the earliest examples of detective/mystery fiction series to have a 'title theme' (e.g. the Sue Grafton 'alphabet' series; Janet Evanovich's 'number' series of Stephanie Plum books, etc.)  Profile  Travis McGee lives on a 52-foot houseboat dubbed The Busted Flush. The boat is named after the circumstances in which he won the boat in what McGee describes as a \\"poker siege\\" of 30 hours of intensive effort in Palm Beach - the run of luck started with a bluff of four hearts (2-3-7-10) and a club (2), which created a \\"busted flush,\\" as described in Chapter 3 of The Deep Blue Good-by. The boat is generally docked at slip F-18 at Bahia Mar Marina, Fort Lauderdale, Florida. A self-described \\"beach bum\\" who \\"takes his retirement in installments\\", he prefers to take on new cases only when the spare cash (besides a reserve fund) in a hidden safe in the Flush runs low. McGee also owns a custom 1936 vintage Rolls-Royce that had been converted into a pickup truck by some previous owner long before he bought it, and another previous owner painted it \\"that horrid blue\\". McGee named it Miss Agnes, after one of his elementary school teachers whose hair was the same shade. McGee's business card reads \\"Salvage Consultant\\", and most business comes by word of mouth. His clients are usually people who have been deprived of something important and/or valuable (typically by unscrupulous or illegal means) and have no way to regain it lawfully. McGee's usual fee is half the value of the item (if recovered) with McGee risking expenses, and those who object to such a seemingly high fee are reminded that getting back half of something is better than owning all of nothing. Although the missing items are usually tangible (e.g., rare stamps, jewels, etc.), in several books McGee is asked to locate a missing person; in one, the stolen property is a client's reputation. In several instances, he shows a marked propensity to exact revenge, usually for the ill-treatment or death of one of his few real friends. Physically, McGee is a tall, tanned, sandy-haired man with pale grey eyes. Several books hint (or explicitly state) that he is a U.S. Army The Lonely Silver Rain, p. 224. veteran of the Korean War. However, later books are less precise about exactly when he served. In The Green Ripper, one of the later novels, there are implications that his military service was during the Vietnam War rather than the Korean. In The Lonely Silver Rain he visits a bank safe-deposit box in which he keeps a few precious keepsakes including photos of his father, mother, and brother, \\"all long dead\\", and he mentions that the box also contains his Silver Star, Purple Heart, and honorable discharge certificate, all awarded by the U.S. Army to \\"Sergeant McGee\\". He also has a daughter named Jean, unknown to him until she reveals herself in The Lonely Silver Rain as the result of a long-ago love affair. He was a stand-out college football player (at tight end) but says in A Deadly Shade of Gold that he never played professional football due to a knee injury. However, in The Turquoise Lament he admits to a sports-trivia fan that he played professional football for a couple of seasons before his knees were wrecked in a tackle by an opponent from the Detroit Lions. Despite his age, he retains the quickness and agility of a professional athlete. He stands 6‚Ä≤4‚Ä≥ (1.93 m) tall and, although deceptively unimposing at his \\"fighting weight\\" of 205 lbs. (93 kg), he is much stronger than he looks, with thick wrists and long arms; occasionally, a more perspicacious adversary notes these features when deciding whether to tangle with him. McGee purposely cultivates an image of being uncoordinated, shambling, and clumsy, but has superb reflexes and muscle memory. He has a 33-inch waist, wears a size 46 long jacket, and a shirt with a ‚Ä≥ neck and 34‚Ä≥ arms. McGee often discusses his fitness regimen, usually in terms of regaining his fitness after a lazy period: swimming and sprinting are frequently mentioned. At one time he was a pipe smoker, but eventually gave it up in order to maintain his physical fitness. As a martial art strategy, he often covers his face and blocks punches with his arms and elbows to lull and tire his opponent while studying that opponent's fighting style. In the final novel, McGee is described as practicing the Chinese art of t'ai chi ch'uan. McGee's early life and family are deliberately left undeveloped; among the few explicit mentions of family are a memory of attending a Chicago parade with his father as a boy, and a brother with whom he planned to go into business after his military service. The brother was apparently swindled out of his savings in a scam involving a woman and a male accomplice and committed suicide; it is strongly hinted that Travis subsequently killed the woman and her partner. McGee's ethnicity is Irish-American; his father's first name is never given, but his mother's maiden name is given as Mary Catherine Devlin. While McGee notes in Free Fall in Crimson (1981) he has \\"cut a wide swath through a wall of female flesh\\", he is honest and cynical enough to understand what this says about himself. This is a part of his introspective nature that frequently appears throughout the series, with observations about society around him, with particular notice paid to the changing Florida environment. McGee's cynical image of himself, some variation of which appears in every book in the series, is as a knight in rusty armor with a broken lance and swaybacked steed, fighting for what he fears are outdated or unrealistic ideals‚Äîthese are clearly allusions to Don Quixote. In his romantic view of the world (as well as several other similarities) he bears a resemblance to Robert B. Parker's Spenser. Professor Hugh Merrill, MacDonald's biographer, suggests that despite McGee being squarely in the hardboiled tradition, the character is nonetheless a marked departure from the typical protagonists in the genre by being a gregarious and essentially likable person. Unlike other fictional detectives such as Raymond Chandler's jaded and world-weary Philip Marlowe, McGee clings to what is important to him: his senses of honor, obligation, and outrage. In a classic commentary in Bright Orange for the Shroud, McGee muses, > Now, of course, having failed in every attempt to subdue the Glades by > frontal attack, we are slowly killing it off by tapping the River of Grass. > In the questionable name of progress, the state in its vast wisdom lets > every two-bit developer divert the flow into drag-lined canals that give him > \\"waterfront\\" lots to sell. As far north as Corkscrew Swamp, virgin stands of > ancient bald cypress are dying. All the area north of Copeland had been > logged out, and will never come back. As the glades dry, the big fires come > with increasing frequency. The ecology is changing with egret colonies > dwindling, mullet getting scarce, mangrove dying of new diseases born of > dryness. This was in a paperback originally published in 1965 when the general public was still not conversant with the concept of environmentalism. McGee does have a sidekick of sorts, in his best friend Meyer, an internationally known and respected economist who lives on a cabin cruiser of his own near McGee's at Bahia Mar, the John Maynard Keynes, and later, after the Keynes is blown up, aboard its replacement, the Thorstein Veblen. There has been some confusion as to whether \\"Meyer\\" is a given name or surname, but it is clear in The Green Ripper when McGee and Meyer are in the hotel room with two federal agents. They refer to him twice as Dr. Meyer and at the second, he says, \\"Just Meyer, please.\\" In Pale Gray for Guilt, Meyer presents a business card giving his name as \\"G. Ludweg Meyer\\", and a letter of introduction beginning \\"My Dear Ludweg\\". Whether these are his real names or not is obscured by both items being instruments in an elaborate financial con game. Both Meyer's boats are jammed full of books and treatises, ranging far beyond simple economic theory. For instance, Meyer is a chess aficionado and amateur psychologist. Meyer serves as McGee's anchor when McGee's own inner compass seems to be skewed, as well as providing the formal education that the street-smart McGee lacks. Meyer has been known to participate in McGee's campaigns on occasion and has come close to being killed more than once as a result. His cover is usually some sort of academic, though at times he has also played a stockbroker or an entomologist. Some world-weariness does eventually creep into McGee's character, perhaps because the 1960s Florida in which he originated no longer exists. The only direct indications of his age ever given are comments that he had served in the Korean War, and until the 1980s he seems ageless. He does at one point refer to having a \\"birthday ending in zero\\", which could mean that he was born in 1930. But as the series progresses, minor recurring characters began to drop away and it becomes apparent that McGee himself is getting older, along with his creator. In later novels such as The Green Ripper and Free Fall in Crimson, there is a sense of desperation that the violence in the world is too senseless to be explained and will never end. Much of that dissipates with the ending of The Lonely Silver Rain, which became the final volume when MacDonald died in 1986. (Reports of another final McGee novel, possibly narrated by Meyer, titled A Black Border for McGee and to be published posthumously,Demarest, Michael (October 15, 1979). \\"Books: The Mid- Life Surge of McGee\\" (a review of The Green Ripper). TIME, Archived from the original on October 15, 2010 on the Wayback Machine. have never been confirmed.)  About the Travis McGee novels  MacDonald was already a prolific author of mystery and suspense novels when he decided to create a series character. McGee originally was to be called Dallas McGee, after the city, but after the Kennedy assassination, MacDonald decided that name had too many negative connotations. He was searching for a first name for McGee when a friend suggested that he look at the names of the many Air Force bases in California. MacDonald's attention was caught by Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, and so he named his character Travis.Cassuto, Leonard. Hard-boiled sentimentality: the secret history of American crime stories (Columbia University Press, 2009), p.170; MacDonald, John D. \\"How to Live With a Hero\\", The Writer (Combat Publishing, Waukesha, WI), 7/2008, pp.22-23. Beginning with The Deep Blue Good-By, released in March 1964, each of the twenty-one novels featuring Travis McGee has a title that incorporates a color. The first three books in the Travis McGee series were published in quick succession, at the rate of one a month, a highly unusual publishing strategy. According to MacDonald, he had earlier written an introductory novel about McGee that he burned as being unsatisfactory. A longtime resident of Sarasota's Siesta Key, MacDonald said he placed McGee on the opposite side of the state to protect his privacy in case the series became popular. McGee has been called the first great modern Florida adventurer, preceding characters and situations that appeared in novels by authors such as Elmore Leonard, Carl Hiaasen, Paul Levine, Tim Dorsey, James W. Hall, and Les Standiford. Hiaasen specifically acknowledged his debt in an introduction he wrote for a new edition of The Deep Blue Good-By in 1994, commenting that even though MacDonald was now eight years gone, he believed McGee was still around, probably sipping gin on the deck of the Busted Flush and pondering whatever it was that Florida had become or was becoming. Singer/songwriter Jimmy Buffett expressed similar sentiments in the lyrics of the song \\"Incommunicado\\". In Salem's Lot by Stephen King, County Sheriff Homer McCaslin berates author Ben Mears' writing. McCaslin tells him to write \\"Like the guy who writes those Travis McGee stories\\". The U.S. Library of Congress's \\"Center for the Book\\" commissioned a short work by MacDonald. The resulting essay, \\"Reading for Survival\\", is a conversation between McGee and Meyer on the importance of reading. The 26-page essay was released in a limited edition of 5,000 copies and was available for a small contribution to the Center for the Book.

The book also mentions the Mu√±equita, a small runabout that McGee later buys in Pale Gray for Guilt. It has been rumored for years that MacDonald was planning a 22nd book to be titled A Black Border for McGee about the death of his famous character and told from the point of view of his friend Meyer. The MacDonald family has steadfastly denied the rumors and has consistently and vigorously refused offers from other authors to continue the series, feeling that no one could properly capture the tone and voice of MacDonald and McGee.  Adaptations  Travis McGee has twice been translated to cinema and television; Rod Taylor played McGee in Darker Than Amber (1970), and Sam Elliott played him in the television movie of The Empty Copper Sea, entitled Travis McGee (1983). The latter relocates McGee in California, eliminating the Florida locales central to the novels. In addition, Elliott kept his trademark brushy mustache, thoroughly distancing himself from the clean-shaven, brush cut look McGee maintains in the books. In the first film Meyer was played by Theodore Bikel, and in the second by Gene Evans. In 1967, author MacDonald refused permission for a television series about Travis McGee and his cases, feeling people would stop reading the novels were Travis McGee regularly on television. Comedian Dan Rowan, a friend of MacDonald's, had expressed interest in playing the role of Travis McGee, but nothing ever materialized. Robert Petkoff provided the voice of Travis McGee in the majority of the current audio book versions of the novels. The prior abridged series from Random House audio featured Darren McGavin in all but two, Darker than Amber and Cinnamon Skin, which were read by Kevin Conway. A film version of The Deep Blue Good-by, directed by Oliver Stone with Leonardo DiCaprio as Travis McGee, was in development with a tentative release date of 2011 or 2012. In April 2010, it was announced that the film's title was changed to Travis McGee. In April 2011, it was announced that Paul Greengrass was interested in directing the film, but in March 2014, James Mangold was attached to direct the film which DiCaprio would produce along with Jennifer Davisson-Killoran and Amy Robinson. Dana Stevens and Kario Salem wrote the first draft. It was revealed that Christian Bale was slated to play the title role for the film The Deep Blue Good-by with a screenplay by Dennis Lehane, but these plans fell through due to Bale having a knee injury.  Literary landmark  200px When the U.S. organization Friends of Libraries U.S.A. decided to institute a series of literary landmark plaques analogous to historic landmark markers, the first to be installed was around what would be Slip F-18 in Bahia Mar, the anchorage of the Busted Flush. This was done in February 1987, less than a year after MacDonald's death. After the remodeling of the Bahia Mar Yachting Center in 2003 to replace fixed docks with floating docks, there no longer existed a Slip F-18. The plaque was remounted on a movable wooden base, which is presently located inside the marina Dockmaster's Office and Gift Shop.An F block of floating yacht slips exists but no F-18.

Guzm√°n Blanco reportedly stole money from the treasury, abused his power, and, after a disagreement with a bishop, expelled any clergy who disagreed with him and seized property belonging to the Catholic Church. When facing severe disapproval during his administration, Guzm√°n Blanco ordered the body of Simon Bolivar to be exhumed and reburied in the National Pantheon of Venezuela to espouse Bolivar's ideals, despite the two men's opposing views. His successor, the undistinguished Herm√≥genes L√≥pez, was also understood to be under his influence. Politics and legacy Guzman near the end of his life in 1895.

His government was responsible for the creation of the modern currency (bol√≠var), the restoration of the national anthem, the second national census, the railroad between Caracas and La Guaira, the foundation of the Venezuelan Academy of the Language, the telephone service between Caracas and La Guaira, promotion of agriculture and education (Decree of Public and Obligatory Instruction of 1870), stimulus to commerce, and important public works (the National Pantheon, the Capitol, and the Municipal Theater, among others.) According to historian Charles L. Davis, Guzman has been referred to as an example of a strongman politician.

The church is noted for having the relics of Saint Valentine, which were donated to the church in the 19th century by Pope Gregory XVI from their previous location in the cemetery of St. Hippolytus in Rome. The church is on the site of a pre-Reformation Carmelite priory built in 1539. The current structure dates from 1825 and was designed by George Papworth, who also designed St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral in Dublin. It was extended and enlarged in 1856 and 1868. The church also contains relics of St. Albert, a Sicilian who died in 1306. On his feast day (August 7), a relic of the saint is dipped into the water of St. Albert's Well, and the Carmelites say that those who piously use the water receive healing of both body and mind through the intercession of St. Albert. The church also contains a life-size oak figure of Our Lady of Dublin.

Niagara is the leading green grape grown in the United States. A purple variety, known as \\"pink\\" niagara (ni√°gara rosada), exists and is the main niagara cultivated in southern Brazil, principally in the states of S√£o Paulo, where the variety first occurred in 1933, and Rio Grande do Sul. The Niagara grape was created in Niagara County, New York, in 1868 when Claudius L. Hoag and Benjamin W. Clark cross-bred Concord grapes with white Cassady grapes. It was first sold commercially in 1882. Niagara grapes are considered to be poor shipping grapes, and so are usually only found near where they are grown. They are most commonly found in the United States in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, Washington, and Ohio, and are also grown in Ontario in Canada, as well as in Brazil, and New Zealand. While only rarely available fresh outside these areas, Niagara grapes are well known to most American consumers as the source of most white grape juice. Wines Photographic plate of Niagara grape from the book The Grapes of New York, 1908 by Ulysses Prentiss Hedrick The fresh grape is large and juicy, round to oval-shaped, pale greenish-white in color and has a sweet, very pleasant aroma. It also has a sweet and generally pleasant flavor, sometime being described as \\"foxy\\". One reviewer, Paul Bulas, attempted to characterize the \\"foxy\\" description. In analyzing the Niagara grape, he detected aromas like candied lemon rind, a Riesling-like diesel aroma, flowery jasmine-like notes, and what he called \\"a high-toned, candied muskiness.\\" This latter descriptor he felt was the primary element of the term \\"foxy\\". His opinion of wines made with the grape is that they have unique and interesting properties that are not well known due to Niagara's reputation as a less-than- optimum wine grape. A diesel aroma in wine is considered to be a positive attribute, but it can be excessive in wines made with the Niagara grape. One opinion is that Niagara grape skins should not contact the must for too long a time after pressing to avoid an excess of this characteristic.

During the summers of 1921 and 1923, Peake organised the 150-man Reserve Mobile Force, which formed the nucleus of the Arab Legion. This force was made of up Arabs, Kurds, Turks, and Circassians, armed with German rifles. Due to increasing regional skirmishes, the Reserve Mobile Force was increased in strength to 750 officers and men.

The solid portion of the must is called pomace and typically makes up 7‚Äì23% of the total weight of the must. Making must is the first step in winemaking. Because of its high glucose content, typically between 10 and 15%, must is also used as a sweetener in a variety of cuisines. Unlike commercially sold grape juice, which is filtered and pasteurized, must is thick with particulate matter, opaque, and comes in various shades of brown and purple. Winemaking The length of time the pomace stays in the juice is critical for the final character of the wine. When the winemaker judges the time to be right, the juice is drained off the pomace, which is then pressed to extract the juice retained by the matrix. Yeast is added to the juice to begin the fermentation, while the pomace is often returned to the vineyard or orchard for use as fertilizer. A portion of selected unfermented must may be kept as S√ºssreserve, to be added as a sweetening component before bottling. Some winemakers create a second batch of wine from the used pomace by adding a quantity of water equivalent to the juice removed, letting the mixture sit for 24 hours, and draining off the liquid. This wine may be used as a drink for the employees of the winemaker or as a basis for some pomace brandies. Grappa, however, must by law be produced only from the pomace solids, with no water added. Selected bacterial colonies or the lenta in superficie (slow surface) or lenta a truciolo (slow wood shavings) methods are used for acetification, and then there is a maturation phase. Both the acetification and the maturation take place in precious sessile oak (Quercus petraea), chestnut, oak, mulberry, and juniper barrels. After a minimum maturation period of 60 days, a group of expert technicians will test the resulting product analytically and Organoleptically.  Balsamico  Bottle of traditional balsamico from Modena, Italy, containing grape must The must is also an essential ingredient for the production of Traditional Balsamic Vinegar, the special aged vinegar from the Emilia-Romana region of Italy, protected under the European Protected Designated Origin system. Mead  This term is also used by meadmakers for the unfermented honey-water mixture that becomes mead. The analogous term in beer brewing is wort. In cookery In ancient Greece, must condensed by boiling was called siraion (œÉŒØœÅŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ) and was used as a sweetener in the kitchen in various recipes (and as a syrup over teganitai (pancakes)). From the Greeks, the Romans in ancient Rome also used the condensed must in cooking, as a sweetener. Must was boiled in lead or bronze kettles into a milder concentrate called defrutum or a stronger concentrate called sapa. It was often used as a souring agent and preservative, especially in fruit dishes. Currently, reduced must is used in Greek, other Balkan countries, French and Middle Eastern cookery as a syrup known as petimezi, pekmez or dibis. In Greece, petimezi is a basic ingredient for a must-custard known as moustalevria, and a sweet-meal known as soutzoukos, churchkhela. The Moustoko√∫loura, or \\"must cookies\\" are also popular Greek cookies, which are based on a sweet dough made by kneading flour, olive oil, spice, and must. They are made in various shapes and sizes, and they are dark brown in color because of the must and the spice in them. In the wine making areas of South Africa must is used to make a sweet bun known as Mosbolletjies. The term petimezi is a Hellenized word of the Armenian/Trebizond term petmez. Petmez was a type of syrup that was made with berries of the White Mulberry tree; petmez was used in Byzantium (Trebizond was part of the Byzantine Empire), where White Mulberries grew in abundance, for their berries and for the silk worms that feed exclusively on Mulberry leaves. Roman lead poisoning hypothesis Geochemist Jerome Nriagu published an article in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1983 hypothesizing that defrutum and sapa may have contained enough lead acetate to be toxic to those who consumed them regularly. In Christian liturgy In Roman Catholic Eucharistic liturgy, must may be substituted for sacramental wine, on condition that the ordinary has granted permission for the benefit of a priest or lay person who should not, usually because of alcoholism, ingest wine; but in normal circumstances it may not be used in place of wine.\\"Gluten Allergies/Alcohol Intolerance and the Bread and Wine used at Mass\\", circular letter Prot. 89/78-174 98 of 24 July 2003, Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, to Presidents of Episcopal Conferences. Official Roman Catholic documents define must (mustum in Latin) precisely as \\"grape juice that is either fresh or preserved by methods that suspend its fermentation without altering its nature (for example, freezing)\\", and it excludes pasteurized grape juice. This teaching goes back at least to Pope Julius I (337‚Äì352), who is quoted in Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica as having declared that in case of necessity, but only then, juice pressed from a grape could be used. Aquinas himself declared that it is forbidden to offer fresh must in the chalice, because this is unbecoming owing to the impurity of the must; but he added that in case of necessity it may be done.Summa Theologica, III, q. 74, art. 5, reply to objection 3. Aquinas himself declared: > Must has already the species of wine, for its sweetness [\\"Aut dulcis musti > Vulcano decoquit humorem\\"; Virgil, Georg. i, 295] indicates fermentation, > which is \\"the result of its natural heat\\" (Meteor. iv); consequently this > sacrament can be made from must. ... It is forbidden to offer must in the > chalice, as soon as it has been squeezed from the grape, since this is > unbecoming owing to the impurity of the must. But in case of necessity it > may be done: for it is said by the same Pope Julius, in the passage quoted > in the argument: \\"If necessary, let the grape be pressed into the > chalice.\\"Summa Theologica, III, q. 74, art. 5, reply to objection 3 Liturgical norms The latest document from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on the matter, issued on 24 July 2003, gave the following norms, which simplify those previously in force: > The Ordinary is competent to give permission for an individual priest or > layperson to use mustum for the celebration of the Eucharist. Permission can > be granted habitually, for as long as the situation that occasioned the > granting of permission continues (e.g., the priest is an alcoholic). When > the principal celebrant at a concelebration has permission to use mustum, a > chalice of normal wine is to be prepared for the concelebrants. Given the > centrality of the celebration of the Eucharist in the life of a priest, one > must proceed with great caution before admitting to Holy Orders those > candidates unable to ingest alcohol without serious harm.

It is most similar to the former, differing only in the bill pattern, which is the reverse of the Sandwich tern's, being yellow with a black tip. From the lesser crested tern, which it overlaps in wintering distribution, it can be told by the white rump and paler grey mantle, as well as the black tip to the bill, which seen from up close also has a white point. The larger greater crested tern is also similar, differing in its stouter, all-yellow bill and darker grey mantle and rump, as well as in size. It is a critically endangered species, previously thought extinct, with a mere four pairs rediscovered in 2000, nesting in a greater crested tern colony on an islet in the Matsu Islands (territory governed by Taiwan), just off the coast of Fujian Province, China, and wintering south to the Philippines. In the past, it had a wider distribution of the Chinese east coast north to Shandong Province. The decline is thought to be due to past hunting and egg collection for food. This colony may have been protected due to the islands' disputed status, administered by the Taiwanese government but claimed by mainland China, and the military sensitivity of the area which restricted access. The islet has now been declared a wildlife sanctuary. It is possible that other small colonies may yet be found off the Chinese and Taiwanese coasts; migrant birds have been seen near the mouth of the Pachang River in southern Taiwan. The total population is speculated to be less than 50 birds. In 2007 it was estimated that the Chinese crested tern would be extinct in five years if authorities would not protect it. BirdLife International of Cambridge, England, stated that a survey of Chinese experts found that the number of crested terns fell to 50 birds, half the population of 2004. A Chinese survey team led by Chen Shuihua stated that the bird was \\"on the verge of extinction.\\"Chinese seabird on verge of extinction It is currently threatened by illegal egg collection, typhoons, and disturbance of nesting colonies by fishermen. There is also a threat of hybridization with the greater crested tern. In 2016, for the first time, Chinese crested terns were found breeding in South Korea. Setting up a new colony in such a faraway area would prove a boon for the species. The species is the county bird of Lienchiang County (Matsu Islands). References * Bridge, E. S.; Jones, A.

Pearson to \\"inquire into and report upon the existing state of bilingualism and biculturalism in Canada and to recommend what steps should be taken to develop the Canadian Confederation on the basis of an equal partnership between the two founding races, taking into account the contribution made by the other ethnic groups to the cultural enrichment of Canada and the measures that should be taken to safeguard that contribution\\". Page 174 The Commission was jointly chaired by Andr√© Laurendeau, publisher of Le Devoir, and Davidson Dunton, president of Carleton University. As a result, it was sometimes known as the Laurendeau-Dunton commission. Ten commissioners representing each of the provinces were also included in the commission as areas such as education were provincial responsibilities. Background Throughout the Quiet Revolution, Canada saw the rise of modern Quebec nationalism as the federation-wide French Canadian nationalism became less and less supported by the younger Francophone generations of this province. The perceived failure of Canada to establish the equality of the English and French languages within governmental institutions is one of main reasons for the rise of the Quebec secessionist movement. Recommendations The Commission recommended sweeping changes when its final report was published, in five parts, 1967-1970, after a report of preliminary findings, February 1965. Among other things, it reported that Francophones were underrepresented in the nation's political and business communities. 1961 statistics of the salaries of Quebec men based on ethnic origin revealed that French Canadian incomes lagged behind all other ethnic groups, with the exception of Italian Canadians and aboriginal Canadians. The recommendations included the following: * That bilingual districts be created in regions of Canada where members of the minority community, either French or English, made up 10% or more of the local population. * That parents be able to have their children attend schools in the language of their choice in regions where there is sufficient demand. * That Ottawa become a bilingual city. * That English and French be declared official languages of Canada. Cultural legacy While in some circles the Commission's legacy is controversial, others view it as a success. The under representation of French-Canadians in positions of power is less of a problem and French-Canadians have access to government services in their own language. Political response Incoming Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau included the Commission's recommendations among his priorities. Prime Minister Pearson's policy statement on bilingualism was strengthened by the Official Languages Act, 1969, making Canada an officially bilingual nation. The provinces were also recommended to make reforms, and many did. Canada's education system was overhauled and school children across the country were made to learn both languages; however Quebec later legislated to make French its official language, and limited English schooling to qualified families. French education in western provinces remained limited by provincial regulation as well. Levasseur-Ouimet, France and McMahon, Fran√ßois: Encyclopedia, consulted on 30 May 2018 at the following url: http://www.ameriquefrancaise.org/en/article-603/French- language_Education_in_Alberta.html The Commission and its recommendations were supported by both the Progressive Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party, but the Tories did have concerns with the costly implementation of the reforms. Regional parties like the Social Credit Party, the Confederation of Regions Party and later on, the Reform Party would object strongly to these changes. In 1971, the federal government led by Trudeau departed from the Commission's findings. While Canada would remain a bilingual nation, it would pursue a policy of multiculturalism rather than biculturalism. Constitutional incorporation In the Constitution Act, 1982, Trudeau ensured that many of the Commission's recommendations were permanently included in the Constitution of Canada, as sections 16 through section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms included several language rights.

The new organisation consolidated the 19th-century Volunteer Force and yeomanry into a unified auxiliary, commanded by the War Office and administered by local County Territorial Associations. The Territorial Force was designed to reinforce the regular army in expeditionary operations abroad, but because of political opposition it was assigned to home defence. Members were liable for service anywhere in the UK and could not be compelled to serve overseas. In the first two months of the First World War, territorials volunteered for foreign service in significant numbers, allowing territorial units to be deployed abroad. They saw their first action on the Western Front during the initial German offensive of 1914, and the force filled the gap between the near destruction of the regular army that year and the arrival of the New Army in 1915. Territorial units were deployed to Gallipoli in 1915 and, following the failure of that campaign, provided the bulk of the British contribution to allied forces in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. By the war's end, the Territorial Force had fielded twenty-three infantry divisions and two mounted divisions on foreign soil. It was demobilised after the war and reconstituted in 1921 as the Territorial Army. The force experienced problems throughout its existence. On establishment, fewer than 40 per cent of the men in the previous auxiliary institutions transferred into it, and it was consistently under strength until the outbreak of the First World War. It was not considered to be an effective military force by the regular army and was denigrated by the proponents of conscription. Lord Kitchener chose to concentrate the Territorial Force on home defence and raise the New Army to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France, a decision which disappointed the territorials. The need to replace heavy losses suffered by the BEF before the New Army was ready forced Kitchener to deploy territorial units overseas, compromising the force's ability to defend the homeland. To replace foreign-service units, the Territorial Force was doubled in size by creating a second line which mirrored the organisation of the original, first- line units. Second-line units assumed responsibility for home defence and provided replacement drafts to the first line. The second line competed with the New Army for limited resources and was poorly equipped and armed. The provision of replacements to the first line compromised the second line's home defence capabilities until a third line was raised to take over responsibility for territorial recruitment and training. The second line's duties were further complicated by the expectation, later confirmed, that it too would be deployed overseas. Territorial units were initially deployed overseas to free up regular units from non-combat duties. On the Western Front, individual battalions were attached to regular army formations and sent into action, and the territorials were credited with playing a key role in stopping the German offensive. The first complete territorial division to be deployed to a combat zone arrived in France in March 1915. Territorial divisions began participating in offensive operations on the Western Front from June 1915 and at Gallipoli later that year. Because of the way it was constituted and recruited, the Territorial Force possessed an identity that was distinct from the regular army and the New Army. This became increasingly diluted as heavy casualties were replaced with conscripted recruits following the introduction of compulsory service in early 1916. The Territorial Force was further eroded as a separate institution when County Territorial Associations were relieved of most of their administrative responsibilities. By the war's end, there was little to distinguish between regular, territorial and New Army formations. Background 22nd Middlesex Rifle Volunteers (Central London Rangers) The British Army of the late 19th century was a small, professional organisation designed to garrison the empire and maintain order at home, with no capacity to provide an expeditionary force in a major war.Mitchinson 2014 p. 11 It was augmented in its home duties by three part-time volunteer institutions, the militia, the Volunteer Force and the yeomanry. Battalions of the militia and Volunteer Force had been linked with regular army regiments since 1872, and the militia was often used as a source of recruitment into the regular army. The terms of service for all three auxiliaries made service overseas voluntary.Spiers pp. 187‚Äì190Beckett 2008 pp. 13‚Äì16 The Second Boer War exposed weaknesses in the ability of the regular army to counter guerrilla warfare which required additional manpower to overcome. The only reinforcements available were the auxiliaries ‚Äì nearly 46,000 militiamen served in South Africa and another 74,000 were enlisted into the regular army; some 20,000 men of the Volunteer Force volunteered for active service in South Africa; and the yeomanry provided the nucleus of the separate Imperial Yeomanry for which over 34,000 volunteered.Beckett 2011 pp. 200‚Äì203Hay pp. 175‚Äì176 The war placed a significant strain on the regular forces. Against a background of invasion scares in the press, George Wyndham, Under-Secretary of State for War, conceded in Parliament in February 1900 that instead of augmenting the regular army's defence of the British coast, the auxiliary forces were the main defence.Beckett 2011 p. 205Beckett 2008 pp. 20, 26 The questionable performance of the volunteers, caused by poor standards of efficiency and training, led to doubts in both government and the regular army about the auxiliary's ability to meet such a challenge.Beckett 2008 p. 27Beckett 2011 pp. 206‚Äì207 The war also exposed the difficulty in relying on auxiliary forces which were not liable for service overseas as a source of reinforcements for the regular army in times of crisis. In 1903, the Director of General Mobilisation and Military Intelligence reported an excess of home defence forces which could not be relied upon to expand the army in foreign campaigns.Hay pp. 220‚Äì221 The utility of such forces was brought further into question by British military planning; the Royal Navy formed the primary defence against invasion, and studies in 1903 and 1908 concluded that the threat of invasion was negligible, despite popular perceptions to the contrary.Mitchinson 2005 pp. 3‚Äì4, 7 Reform efforts Richard Haldane, architect of the Territorial Force The first reform efforts were undertaken in 1901 by William St John Brodrick, Secretary of State for War. They were designed to improve the training of the auxiliary forces and transform the yeomanry from cavalry to mounted infantry.Beckett 2011 pp. 206‚Äì208 Brodrick's efforts were met with opposition from auxiliary interests in the government, and the yeomanry in particular proved resistant to change. A royal commission on auxiliary forces concluded in 1904 that the volunteer organisations were not fit to defend the country unaided and that the only effective solution would be to introduce conscription.Beckett 2011 pp. 208‚Äì209 This option, regarded as political suicide by all parties, was immediately rejected. Brodrick's successor, H. O. Arnold-Forster, also failed to overcome opposition to his reform efforts.Simkins 2007 p. 24Spiers pp. 202‚Äì203Beckett 2011 pp. 209‚Äì212 In December 1905, a Liberal government took office, bringing in Richard Haldane as the Secretary of State for War. His vision was for a nation that could be mobilised for war without resorting to conscription ‚Äì a \\"real national army, formed by the people\\".Beckett 2008 p. 28 His solution was the Territorial Force, financed, trained and commanded centrally by the War Office and raised, supplied and administered by local County Territorial Associations.Beckett 2008 pp. 30, 43‚Äì44 Haldane was able to overcome opposition and pass the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 which created the force, though not without compromise. His plan to give civic, business and trade union leaders a major role in running the County Territorial Associations was significantly reduced in the face of opposition to civilian encroachment in military affairs. Instead, the associations were chaired by Lord Lieutenants and run by traditional county military elites.Beckett 2011 pp. 213‚Äì215Beckett 2008 pp. 31‚Äì32Mitchinson 2008 p. 2 Militia representatives refused to accept Haldane's plans to allocate a proportion of the militia as a reserve for the regular army and incorporate the remainder into the Territorial Force. After three attempts to persuade them, Haldane abolished the militia and created the Special Reserve.Beckett 2011 p. 216 Crucially, Haldane's efforts were based on the premise that home defence rested with the navy and that the imperative for army reform was to provide an expeditionary capability.Dennis pp. 5‚Äì6 His reorganisation of the regular army created a six-division Expeditionary Force, and his plan was for the Territorial Force to reinforce it after six months of training following mobilisation. Representatives of the existing auxiliary forces and elements within the Liberal party opposed any foreign service obligation. To ensure their support, Haldane declared the Territorial Force's purpose to be home defence when he introduced his reforms in Parliament, despite having stressed an overseas role eight days previously. The last-minute change caused significant difficulties for the force throughout its existence.Beckett 2011 p. 215Dennis pp. 13‚Äì14, 19 Formation Lord Roberts, fierce critic of the Territorial Force and strong proponent of conscription as a better alternative The Territorial Force was established on 1 April 1908 by the amalgamation of the Volunteer Force and the yeomanry. The Volunteer Force battalions became the infantry component of the Territorial Force and were more closely integrated into regular army regimental establishments they had previously been linked to; for example, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Volunteer Battalions of the regular army's Gloucestershire Regiment became the regiment's 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions (Territorial Force).Beckett 2011 pp. 216‚Äì217Simkins 2007 p. 16Daniell pp. 201‚Äì202 The infantry was organised into 14 territorial divisions, each of three brigades. The yeomanry regiments became the mounted component of the Territorial Force, organised into 14 mounted brigades. Brigades and divisions were equipped with integral supporting arms along regular army lines, comprising territorial units of artillery (totalling 182 horse and field batteries), engineers and signals, along with supply, medical and veterinary services. Each territorial unit was assigned a specific role either in coastal defence, supplementing 81 territorial companies of the Royal Garrison Artillery manning fixed defences, or as part of the mobile Central Force.Beckett 2008 pp. 30‚Äì31 Training was managed by a permanent staff of regular army personnel attached to territorial units.Mitchinson 2017 p. 19 Recruits to the Territorial Force had to be aged between 17 and 35. They enlisted for a four-year term which could be extended by an obligatory year in times of crisis. Members could terminate their enlistment on three months' notice and payment of a fine. Recruits were required to attend a minimum of 40 drill periods in their first year and 20 per year thereafter. All members were required to attend between eight and fifteen days of annual camp.Beckett 2008 pp. 29, 34 The force was liable to serve anywhere in the UK. Members were not required to serve overseas but could volunteer to do so. Haldane, who still regarded the force's primary function to be the expansion of the Expeditionary Force, hoped that up to a quarter of all territorials would volunteer on mobilisation. The Imperial Service Obligation was introduced in 1910 to allow territorials to volunteer in advance.Dennis p. 19 It was illegal to amalgamate or disband territorial units or transfer members between them.Beckett 2008 p. 63 Reception The reforms were not received well by the auxiliaries. The exclusion of the militia rendered Haldane's target of just over 314,000 officers and men for the Territorial Force unattainable. The new terms of service imposed an increased commitment on members compared to that demanded by the previous auxiliary institutions. By 1 June 1908, the force had attracted less than 145,000 recruits. Despite considerable efforts to promote the new organisation to the former auxiliary institutions, less than 40 per cent of all existing auxiliaries transferred into it.Beckett 2011 p. 217 The County Territorial Associations emphasised pride in a local territorial identity in their efforts to recruit new members, and used imagery of local scenes under attack to encourage enlistment.Mitchinson 2014 p. 2 In general, the force attracted recruits from the working class, though they were mainly artisans rather than the unskilled labourers who filled the ranks of the regular army. In some units, middle and working classes served together. Units which recruited from the more affluent urban centres contained a significant proportion of well- educated white-collar workers. Territorial officers were predominantly middle class, meaning that in some units there was little to separate officers from other ranks in terms of social status.Sheffield pp. 13‚Äì16 Punch less than three months before the start of the First World War. Territorial officers were regarded as social inferiors by the regular army's more privileged officer corps. The territorials' relatively narrow social spectrum resulted in a less formal system of self-discipline than the rigid, hierarchical discipline of the regular army, feeding a professional prejudice against the amateur auxiliary.Sheffield pp. 16‚Äì20 The regular army had no more faith in the territorials' abilities than it had in those of the force's predecessors. Territorial standards of training and musketry were suspect, and the reputation of the territorial artillery was so poor that there were calls for it to be disbanded. Regular officers, fearing for their career prospects, often resisted postings as territorial adjutants.Beckett 2011 p. 219Mitchinson 2008 p. 119 The Army Council predicted that, even after six months of intensive training on mobilisation, the force would not reach a standard at which two territorial divisions could be considered the equal of one regular division as planned.Beckett 2008 p. 70 In 1908 and 1914, it was decided that two of the army's six expeditionary divisions should be retained in the UK for home defence, so ineffective was the Territorial Force perceived to be in the role to which it had been assigned. Conscription debate and pre-war problems In 1910, Lord Esher, pro-conscription chairman of the London County Territorial Association, wrote in the National Review that the country would have to choose between an under-strength voluntary auxiliary and compulsory service.Simkins 2007 p. 17 In his opinion, the Territorial Force was the last chance for the volunteer tradition, and its failure would pave the way for conscription.Mitchinson 2008 p. 7 Advocacy for compulsory service was led by the National Service League (NSL), which regarded reliance on a naval defence against invasion as complacent and a strong home army as essential.Dennis p. 17 A bill sponsored by the NSL in 1909 proposed using the Territorial Force as the framework for a conscripted home army. When that failed, the league became increasingly antagonistic towards the auxiliary.Beckett 2011 p. 220 The force was denigrated for its excessive youth, inefficiency and consistently low numbers, and ridiculed in the popular press as the \\"Territorial Farce\\".Mitchinson 2005 p. 1Mitchinson 2014 p. 59 The NSL's president ‚Äì the former Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, Lord Roberts ‚Äì enlisted the support of serving officers in a campaign against it, and in 1913 the Army Council declared its support for conscription.Beckett 2011 pp. 219‚Äì220Beckett 2004 p. 129 Even prominent members of the force itself favoured compulsory service, and by April 1913 ten County Territorial Associations had expressed support for it.Dennis p. 23 The relationship between the County Territorial Associations and the War Office was often acrimonious. The associations frequently complained about excessive bureaucracy and inadequate finance. The military authorities begrudged the money that could have been spent on the regular army being wasted on what they perceived as an inefficient, amateur auxiliary.Mitchinson 2008 pp. 13‚Äì16, 105 Efforts to provide adequate facilities, for example, were undermined by slow responses from the War Office which, when finally forthcoming, often rejected the associations' plans outright or refused to allocate the full financing requested. In 1909, the Gloucestershire association complained that \\"most of our association are businessmen and are unable to understand why it takes ten weeks and upwards to reply\\" after waiting for a response to its proposed purchase of a site for a field ambulance unit.Mitchinson 2008 pp. 25, 41‚Äì42 Somerset lost three sites for a proposed new drill hall because the War Office took so long to approve plans, and Essex had to wait five years before it received approval for the construction of new rifle ranges.Mitchinson 2008 pp. 34‚Äì35, 110 Good facilities were regarded by the associations as important for efficiency, unit esprit de corps and recruitment, and the authorities' parsimony and apparent obstruction were seen as undermining these.Mitchinson 2008 pp. 34, 37 The force failed to retain large numbers of men after their initial enlistment expired, and it consistently fell short of its established strength. It reached a peak of 268,000 men in 1909 when invasion scares prompted a surge in recruitment, but by 1913 numbers had declined to less than 246,000, and the officer corps was nearly 20 per cent under-subscribed.Beckett 2011 p. 221Dennis p. 25Mitchinson 2008 p.59 In 1910, a third of the force had not completed the minimum level of musketry training. Only 155,000 territorials completed the full 15-day annual camp in 1912, and around 6,000 did not attend at all. In 1909, some 37 per cent of the rank and file were under 20 years old; in the opinion of the Inspector-General of the Home Forces, this proportion rendered the force too immature to be effective. In 1913, approximately 40,000 territorials were under 19 years old, the minimum age at which they could volunteer for service overseas. Barely seven per cent of the force had accepted the Imperial Service Obligation, seriously compromising its viability as a reinforcement for the Expeditionary Force.Beckett 2011 pp. 221‚Äì222Dennis p. 24 Because the military authorities regarded the Territorial Force as weak and saw no value in an auxiliary that was not liable for foreign service, they prioritised expenditure on the regular army, leaving the force armed with obsolete weapons. First World War Recruitment poster for the territorial 4th Battalion, Dorset Regiment, Sept 1914. On the outbreak of the First World War, Lord Kitchener by-passed the Territorial Force and, with the approval of the military authorities, raised instead the New Army of volunteers to expand the regular army. His decision was based not only on professional prejudice ‚Äì he regarded the territorials as a joke, led by \\"middle-aged professional men who were allowed to put on uniform and play at soldiers\\"Simkins 2007 p. 41 ‚Äì but also on an appreciation of the constraints imposed by the force's constitution. He feared that the County Territorial Associations would be unable to cope with the task of recruiting and training large numbers. He also believed that because so few territorials had thus far volunteered for foreign service, the Territorial Force was better suited for home defence than as a means of expanding the army overseas.Beckett 2008 pp. 52‚Äì53Mitchinson 2014 p. 60 Mobilisation and training At the end of July, territorial Special Service Sections began patrolling the east coast. On the day before the declaration of war, the 1st London Brigade was dispersed by platoons to protect the rail network between London and Southampton.Mitchinson 2005 pp. 52‚Äì53 The remainder of the Territorial Force was mobilised on the evening of 4 August 1914, and war stations were quickly occupied by those units with bases located nearby. By 6 August, for example, units of the Wessex Division were concentrated at Plymouth while those of the Northumbrian Division took up positions in the east coast defences, and the following day elements of the Welsh Division were gathered in the area of Pembroke Dock.Mitchinson 2005 pp. 54‚Äì55 Some formations assembled close to their bases before moving on to their war stations; the Highland Division, for example, gathered at various locations north of Edinburgh before proceeding to Bedford, north of London. Defence duties resulted in some divisions being dispersed; a brigade of the West Riding Division, for example, was deployed to watch the east coast while the rest of the division guarded railways and munitions factories inland, and the brigades of the East Anglian Division were widely scattered about East Anglia.Mitchinson 2005 pp. 57‚Äì58 On 13 August 1914, Kitchener signalled a willingness to deploy overseas those territorial units in which 80 per cent of the men (reduced to 60 per cent at the end of the month) had accepted the Imperial Service Obligation.Beckett 2008 pp. 53‚Äì54 Despite the low uptake before the war, 72 per cent of the rank and file volunteered for foreign service by the end of September.Beckett 2011 p. 230 The first full territorial divisions to be deployed overseas were used to free up imperial garrisons. The East Lancashire Division was sent to Egypt in September, and three territorial divisions had been deployed to India by January 1915.Beckett 2008 p. 54 Territorial battalions released regular troops stationed at Aden, Cyprus, Gibraltar and Malta. Five regular army divisions were created from the troops released by the territorials' deployments.Simkins 2003 p. 245 The extent to which territorials accepted the obligation varied considerably between battalions; some registered 90 per cent or more acceptance, others less than 50 per cent. The difficulties were not restricted to the rank and file, and many battalions sailed for foreign service with officers who had been newly promoted or recruited to replace those who had chosen to remain at home.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 71‚Äì73 H Company, 8th Battalion (Territorial Force), Nottingham and Derbyshire Regiment, mobilising on 7 August 1914. The territorials faced difficulties as they trained up to operational standard. Some artillery units did not get an opportunity to practise with live ammunition until January 1915. Rifle practice suffered due to lack of rifles, practice ammunition and ranges on which to use them. Because there was insufficient transport, a motley collection of carts, private vehicles and lorries were pressed into service. The animals used to pull the non-motorised transport or mount the yeomanry ranged in pedigree from half-blind pit ponies to show horses.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 53‚Äì56 The Territorial Force competed with the New Army for recruits, and the War Office prioritised the latter for training and equipment.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 39‚Äì40 Many of the regular army staff posted to territorial units were recalled to their parent regiments, and those professionals that still remained were transferred to territorial reserve units in January 1915. Training proved difficult for formations that were widely dispersed as part of their defence duties, and was complicated for all by the need to reorganise the territorial battalions' outdated eight-company structure to the army's standard four-company battalion.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 63‚Äì68 =Second line= On 15 August, County Territorial Associations began raising second-line units to replace those scheduled for foreign service. The ranks of the second line were filled by those territorials who could not or did not accept the Imperial Service Obligation. In November, associations started raising third-line units to take over from the second-line units the responsibility for providing replacement drafts to territorial combat units. Territorial battalions were numbered according to line so that, for example, the three lines of the 6th Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, became the 1/6th, 2/6th and 3/6th Battalions. In May 1915, territorial divisions were numbered in order of their deployment overseas; the East Lancashire Division, for example, became the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division.Beckett 2008 p. 57 Second-line units immediately assumed that the third line would take over their home-based duties, in the belief that second-line divisions would be deployed overseas. Many second-line battalions refused to take recruits who had not accepted the Imperial Service Obligation, a practice that was not officially sanctioned until March 1915 when the option to enlist only for home service was abolished. The deployment of second-line units overseas was officially endorsed in mid 1915. Until the third line was ready, the conflicting demands to supply drafts, defend the homeland and prepare for deployment caused problems for the second line.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 180‚Äì181Mitchinson 2005 p. 99 In May 1915, Kitchener informed the War Cabinet that the second line was so denuded of trained men as to render it unreliable for home defence. Only in 1916 could the War Office promise that the second line would no longer be trawled for replacements to be sent to the first line. By this time, second-line battalion establishments had been reduced to 400 men, less than half the number normally serving in an infantry battalion at full strength. It took on average 27 months to prepare a second-line formation for active service, compared to eight months for the first line, and the second line often lacked sufficient weapons and ammunition.Beckett 2008 pp. 58‚Äì60Mitchinson 2005 pp. 99‚Äì100 The desire among the second-line commanders to maintain a level of training and efficiency in readiness for their own deployment led to friction with their first-line counterparts, who accused the second line of holding back the best men and sending sub-standard replacements to the first line.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 181‚Äì182 Western Front 1/14th Battalion (London Scottish) at the Battle of Messines, 31 October 1914 When the regular army suffered high attrition during the opening battles in France, Kitchener came under pressure to make up the losses. With the New Army not yet ready, he was forced to fall back on the territorials.Beckett 2008 p. 55 Despite the preference of General Ian Hamilton, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces, for the Territorial Force to be deployed to the Western Front in complete brigades and divisions, it was deployed piecemeal. Because of the pressing need for troops, individual battalions were sent as soon as they reached a degree of efficiency and attached to regular brigades.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 58‚Äì59, 62 There was little logic in the choice of units deployed. Some that had been positively assessed remained at home while less well prepared units were deployed, often without enough equipment and only after being hastily brought up to strength.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 58‚Äì62 The first territorial unit to arrive was the 1/14th Battalion (London Scottish), London Regiment, in September 1914. By December, twenty-two infantry battalions, seven yeomanry regiments, and one medical and three engineer units had been sent.Beckett 2008 pp. 55‚Äì56 Territorial battalions were initially allocated to line-of-communication duties for up to three weeks before being assigned to regular army brigades. From February 1915, with 48 infantry battalions in-country, they were sent directly to their host divisions.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 78‚Äì79Beckett 2008 p. 56 On arrival at the front, the territorials would spend several days in further training behind the lines before undergoing a period of trench acclimatisation. When the battalion was considered proficient, or when the pressure to relieve a regular unit became too severe, the territorials were allocated their own sector of the front. The time between arriving at brigade and taking over the trenches varied from between six days to one month.Mitchinson 2014 p. 79 =Filling the gap= Sniper team of the 1/4th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment, at Ypres, 1915 The territorials were thrown into the defensive battles of the initial German offensive during the Race to the Sea. Among the first to see action was the London Scottish, which suffered 640 casualties on 31 October 1914 during the Battle of Messines. It was in action again during the First Battle of Ypres in November, and was praised as a \\"glorious lead and example\\" to the rest of the Territorial Force by Field Marshal Sir John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF).Mitchinson 2014 p. 99 As the territorials completed their training and the threat of invasion receded, complete divisions were deployed to combat theatres. The first to depart was the 46th (North Midland) Division, which arrived on the Western Front in March 1915. By July, all 14 first-line divisions had been deployed overseas.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 62‚Äì63 The Northumberland Brigade of the Northumbrian Division became the first territorial formation larger than a battalion to fight under its own command when it participated in an abortive counter-attack on 26 April 1915 during the Second Battle of Ypres. It suffered 1,954 casualties and earned a personal congratulation from French. The division had deployed only three days earlier; the rest of its units were attached piecemeal to other formations and immediately thrown into the desperate fighting, earning further praise from French for their tenacity and determination. Several other territorial battalions attached to regular army formations fought with distinction in the defence of Ypres, at the cost of heavy casualties.Edmonds & Wynne pp. 262‚Äì263Mitchinson 2014 pp. 107‚Äì112 The three battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment were temporarily amalgamated into a single composite battalion, as were three battalions of the London Regiment. Battlefield amalgamations were a military necessity which threatened the legal protections on territorial unit integrity.Beckett 2011 p. 235 Although the territorials were proving their worth in defensive operations, the commanders of the regular formations to which they were attached still did not trust their abilities. The regulars regarded the primary function of the territorials to be the release of regular battalions for offensive operations. The territorials were employed in the construction and maintenance of trenches, and generally performed only supporting actions in the attacks at Neuve Chapelle and Aubers Ridge in early 1915.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 98‚Äì101, 107 An exception was the 1/13th Battalion (Kensington), London Regiment. During the Battle of Aubers Ridge, the Kensingtons became the first territorial battalion to be deployed in the first wave of a major assault, and was the only battalion to achieve its objective on the day.Mitchinson 2014 p. 101 But the Territorial Force had filled the gaps created in the regular army by the German offensive of 1914, and French wrote that it would have been impossible to halt the German advance without it.Beckett 2008 p. 76Mitchinson 2014 pp. 115‚Äì116 =First divisional operations= The 51st (Highland) Division participated in an attack on 15 June 1915 in the Second Action of Givenchy, part of the Second Battle of Artois. The division had lost several of its original battalions to piecemeal deployment and had been brought up to strength only a month before it arrived in France, largely by the attachment of a brigade from the 55th (West Lancashire) Division. It was the first experience in assault for the two battalions that spearheaded the division's attack. They succeeded in reaching the German second line of defences, but when the regular forces on their right did not the territorials were forced to retire with heavy losses.Bewsher pp. 10‚Äì12, 18Mitchinson 2014 pp. 103‚Äì106 A professionally planned and executed assault by the 47th (1/2nd London) Division was one of the few successes in the Battle of Loos on 25 September, but the 46th (North Midland) Division suffered 3,643 casualties in a failed assault against the Hohenzollern Redoubt on 13 October. To Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the First Army, the 46th Division's failure demonstrated that \\"some territorial units still need training and discipline\\".Mitchinson 2014 pp. 112‚Äì115Edmonds p. 388 Territorials of the 47th (1/2nd London) Division advancing during the Battle of Loos By the summer of 1915, six complete territorial divisions had been deployed to France. Many of the 52 territorial units still attached to regular army formations were returned to their own parent commands. This allowed the professionals to remove from their formations an element made awkward by its specific terms of service.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 88‚Äì89 The regulars found the territorials to be slow to move and recuperate, and better in static defence than attack.Beckett 2011 p. 234 Nevertheless, the reshuffle indicated that the Territorial Force had exceeded the expectations of the military authorities, and the territorials' time with the regulars generally resulted in a strong camaraderie and mutual respect between the two.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 87‚Äì89 French reported in February 1915 the praise of his commanders for their territorials, who were \\"fast approaching, if they had not already reached, the standards of efficiency of the regular infantry\\".Mitchinson 2014 p. 116 =Battle of the Somme= There were eight first-line territorial divisions on the Western Front at the start of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916. Two of them, the 46th (North Midland) Division and the 56th (1/1st London) Division, went into action on the first day in a disastrous attack on the Gommecourt Salient, a diversionary operation conducted by the Third Army.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 192‚Äì193McCarthy pp. 8, 31‚Äì33 Two more territorial divisions, the 48th (South Midland) and the 49th (West Riding), were among the initial 25 divisions of the Fourth Army, which bore the brunt of the fighting during the four and a half months of the Somme offensive. The 49th Division was committed piecemeal on the first day to the fighting around the Schwaben Redoubt, and two battalions of the 48th Division were attached to the 4th Division and participated in the first day's fighting.Mitchinson 2014 p. 193Rawson pp. 30, 33 The 48th Division itself went into action on 16 July, and by the end of September the remaining four territorial divisions ‚Äì the 47th (1/2nd London), 50th (Northumbrian), 51st (Highland) and 55th (West Lancashire) ‚Äì had relieved battle-weary units and gone into action.Rawson pp. 101, 110, 177 Territorials of the 48th (South Midland) Division during the Battle of the Somme Although the 46th Division's poor performance at Gommecourt cemented a perception that it was a failed unit and the 49th Division's standing was little better, the territorials generally emerged from the Somme with enhanced reputations.Mitchinson 2014 p. 196 This was echoed by Brigadier-General C. B. Prowse, a brigade commander in the 4th Division, who commented, \\"I did not before think much of the territorials, but by God they can fight.\\"Beckett 2008 p. 83 The Battle of the Somme marked the high point of the Territorial Force as a recognisable entity distinct from the regular and New Army forces. It suffered some 84,000 casualties during the offensive, and the indiscriminate replacement of these with recruits who had been conscripted into the army rather than volunteering specifically for the Territorial Force marked the beginning of the end for the territorial identity.Mitchinson 2014 p. 6Beckett 2011 p. 232 =Second-line deployment= Fourteen second-line divisions were formed during the war, eight of which were deployed overseas. The first to fight in a major battle was the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division.James p. 132Mitchinson 2014 p. 204 Its constituent units were raised in September and October 1914, and their training was indicative of the difficulties faced by the second line in general. New recruits paraded without uniforms until October and lived at home until the division assembled in January 1915. The infantry was equipped with old Japanese Arisaka rifles, antique Maxim machine-guns and dummy Lewis guns constructed from wood. The divisional artillery, having initially drilled with cart-mounted logs, was equipped first with obsolete French 90 mm cannons, then with outdated 15-pounder guns and 5-inch howitzers handed down from the first line. The division was not issued with modern weapons until it began intensive training in March 1916, in preparation for its deployment to France at the end of May. Battalion strengths fluctuated throughout training as men were drafted to first-line units.Becke 2B p. 38 The division was still only at two-thirds strength when it attacked at the Battle of Fromelles in July 1916 alongside the Australian 5th Division. The heavy casualties suffered by the Australians were blamed on the failure of the territorials' assaulting battalions to take a key position.Bean pp. 340, 444‚Äì445 Gallipoli Fusiliers of the 125th Brigade, 42nd (East Lancashire Division), about to land and go into battle at Gallipoli, May 1915. By August 1915, four territorial infantry divisions and a yeomanry mounted division, deployed without its horses as infantry, had reinforced British Empire forces engaged in the Gallipoli Campaign.Beckett 2008 pp. 79‚Äì80 Their landings were chaotic; the 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade, for example, landed nearly a week before the other two brigades of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. The infantry were rushed into battle without any opportunity to acclimatise, and the 54th (East Anglian) Division did not receive any formal instruction about the nature of the campaign for the first four weeks of its participation in it. Some battalions of the 53rd (Welsh) Division were second-line units and had still been supplying replacement drafts to first-line units, and the division was given only two weeks notice that it was to go to Gallipoli.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 90, 118‚Äì121 The 42nd Division impressed the regulars with its spirit in the Third Battle of Krithia on 4 June. The 155th (South Scottish) Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division assaulted with such determination in July that it overran its objective and came under fire from French allies. The 156th (Scottish Rifles) Brigade suffered over 50 per cent casualties in the Battle of Gully Ravine on 28 June, and a battalion of the 54th Division was slaughtered when it advanced too far during an attack on 12 August.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 119‚Äì121 The same month, the yeomen of the 2nd Mounted Division suffered 30 per cent casualties during the Battle of Scimitar Hill, and had to be relieved by six dismounted yeomanry brigades which landed in October.Mileham pp. 39‚Äì40 The campaign ended in withdrawal in January 1916. Although Hamilton, appointed to command the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force in March 1915, praised the courage of the territorials, he criticised the performance of the 53rd and 54th Divisions. His comments failed to recognise the difficulties the two divisions had faced with the loss of many of their trained men transferred to other units before their arrival at Gallipoli.Beckett 2008 p. 80 Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. Da Costa, GSO1 of the 54th Division, refuted accusations by Lieutenant-General Sir Frederick Stopford, commander of IX Corps, that the division lacked attacking spirit and was badly led. Da Costa claimed that its poor performance was entirely due to the way it had been \\"chucked ashore\\" and thrown into a poorly-coordinated and ill-defined attack.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 121‚Äì122 Egypt, Sinai and Palestine Lady Butler Following a successful British defence of the Suez Canal, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) was formed in March 1916 and went over to the offensive against German and Ottoman forces in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The EEF comprised forces from Britain, Australia, New Zealand and India, and the British contribution was predominantly territorial. Most of the infantry was provided by the four territorial divisions that had fought at Gallipoli. When the 42nd Division was transferred to France in March 1917, it was replaced in July by the second- line 60th (2/2nd London) Division. The latter, having already fought during the Battle of Doiran in Salonika, played a key role in the capture of Jerusalem on 9 December.Beckett 2008 pp. 85‚Äì86Becke 2A p. 41, 2B p. 32 The yeomanry provided 18 dismounted regiments which fought as infantry and, in 1917, were formed into the 74th (Yeomanry) Division. This division was transferred to France in 1918 along with the 52nd (Lowland) Division.Beckett 2008 p. 85Becke 2A p. 115, 2B pp. 121‚Äì122 Five brigades of yeomanry fought in the mounted role, and in 1917 three of them were formed into the Yeomanry Mounted Division. The yeomanry mounted some of the last cavalry charges ever made by British forces; the Charge at Huj on 8 November 1917 by the 1/1st Warwickshire Yeomanry and 1/1st Queen's Own Worcestershire Hussars, followed five days later with a charge by the 1/1st Royal Bucks Hussars in the Battle of Mughar Ridge.Mileham pp. 42‚Äì47 By the end of a campaign in which the EEF had advanced across the Sinai, through Palestine, and into Syria, territorial casualties numbered over 32,000 ‚Äì 3,000 more than those suffered by British regular, Australian, New Zealand and Indian forces combined. Late war 1/4th Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, 51st (Highland) Division, at the Battle of Cambrai The much maligned 46th (North Midland) Division redeemed itself in 1918 in a hazardous attack during the Battle of St Quentin Canal. The operation was successfully spearheaded by the 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade, which included two battalions that were almost disbanded because of their alleged poor performance at Gommecourt two years earlier.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 201, 210Beckett 2008 pp. 83‚Äì84 The seven untested second-line divisions saw their first actions in 1917.Becke 2B pp. 6, 14, 22, 31, 46, 73 They generally suffered, undeservedly, from poor reputations, although the 58th (2/1st London) and 62nd (2nd West Riding) Divisions were well regarded by the war's end.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 215, 259 The 51st (Highland) Division, whose men labelled themselves as \\"duds\\" after a slow start, and the two London first- line divisions were among the best in the BEF by 1918.Bewsher p. 30Mitchinson 2014 p. 210 A reputation for dependability resulted in the 48th (South Midland) Division being transferred to Italy to relieve the regular 7th Infantry Division in March 1918.Becke 2A p. 83 Several territorial divisions overcame poor initial impressions to become effective, dependable formations by the end of the war.Mitchinson 2014 p. 217 The 61st (2nd South Midland) Division, for example, blamed for the failure at Fromelles, was commended by Lieutenant-General Hubert Gough, commander of the Fifth Army, as the best performing of his 11 front-line divisions in the initial onslaught of the German Spring Offensive in March 1918.Barnes pp. 92, 97 As the war progressed, Britain began to struggle with manpower shortages, prompting changes which affected the territorials. The 63rd (2nd Northumbrian) and 65th (2nd Lowland) Divisions had already been disbanded in July 1916 and March 1917 respectively. The remaining four home-based divisions lost their territorial affiliation when they were reconstituted as part of the Training Reserve over the winter of 1917/1918.Becke 2B pp. 54, 59, 65, 81, 89, 97 In early 1918, every brigade in the BEF was reduced from four to three battalions. The reductions targeted second-line and New Army units, and resulted in the amalgamation of 44 territorial battalions and the disbandment of a further 21.Messenger p. 275 In July, the 50th (Northumbrian) Division was left with a single territorial battalion when it was reorganised following heavy losses during the Spring Offensive. Its other territorial battalions, having fought in most battles since the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915, were reduced to a cadre or disbanded. All but one battalion in each brigade of the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the 60th (2/2nd London) Division in Palestine were transferred to France and replaced with Indian battalions in 1916.Mitchinson 2014 p. 216Beckett 2011 p. 233 The 75th Division was formed in Egypt in March 1917 with territorial units transferred from India, though it too was subsequently 'indianised'.Becke 2B p. 129 Several territorial battalions from the 42nd (East Lancashire), 46th (North Midland) and 59th (2nd North Midland) Divisions were reduced to training cadres, demobilised or disbanded shortly before the war's end.Mitchinson 2014 p. 259 The apparent cull of territorial units added to the grievances harboured by the Territorial Force about its treatment by the military authorities. Erosion of the territorial identity Soldiers of 149th (Northumbrian) Brigade. The first territorial brigade to see action in 1915, by the time this picture was taken in October 1916 it had suffered many casualties and been rebuilt with many non-Northumbrians. Many territorial battalions had strong individual identities based on the geography of their recruitment. The ranks had been filled by men who, at least until direct voluntary recruitment into the Territorial Force ceased in December 1915, had chosen the force in preference to the new or regular armies. They had elected to join local regiments and been imbued with an esprit de corps during their training in those regiments' own second and later third lines.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 191‚Äì192Beckett 2008 p. 73 The strong sense of locality was reinforced by a shared civilian background ‚Äì it was not uncommon for territorials to be employed in the same office, mill or factory ‚Äì and many territorial memoirs betray a sense of family or club. A similar sentiment was exploited in raising the New Army pals battalions, but in the Territorial Force this was reinforced by a pedigree that New Army units did not possess; most territorial units could trace a lineage back to the early or mid 19th century through units of yeomanry or volunteers which had for generations been a part of local communities and social life.Beckett 2008 p. 71Mitchinson 2014 pp. 6, 15, 197Simkins 2007 pp. 82‚Äì83 Replacements In the first half of the war, territorial casualties were generally replaced with drafts from a battalion's own reserve. Although there were some cases of replacements being sourced from different regions or non-territorial units, in mid-1916 the ranks of the territorial units were still largely populated by men who had volunteered specifically for service as a territorial in their local regiment.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 185‚Äì186, 190‚Äì192 The legal protections for this were stripped away by the Military Service Acts of 1916. These permitted the amalgamation and disbandment of units and the transfer of territorials between them, introduced conscription, and required territorials either to accept the Imperial Service Obligation or leave the force and become liable for conscription.Beckett 2008 pp. 62‚Äì63 The last recruits to voluntarily enlist in a specific unit of the Territorial Force before the choice was removed, and who had trained in that unit's third line alongside neighbours and colleagues, had been drafted to their front-line units by May 1916.Mitchinson 2014 p. 214 In September 1916, the regiment-based system for training New Army units was centralised into the Training Reserve. Separately, the 194 territorial third-line units were amalgamated into 87 Reserve Battalions. They retained responsibility for supplying replacements to the first- and second-line units, but when unable to do so, replacements were sent from the Training Reserve. The system was organised by region, so even if a battalion did not receive replacements from its own regiment they were generally sourced from an appropriate locality, but it did not guarantee unit integrity.James pp. 39, 127Mitchinson 2014 pp. 204‚Äì206 Dilution of the territorial identity as the war progressed, based on casualties born or residing in a unit's original recruiting area for a sample of territorial battalions. After the heavy losses sustained during the Somme offensive, dilution of the territorial identity accelerated because of the influx of replacements who had no territorial affiliation. Some units still maintained a regional identity; the 56th (1/1st London) Division, for example, retained its essentially London character despite the fact that the four battalions of its 168th Brigade received replacements from at least 26 different regiments during the battle.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 201‚Äì203 Others experienced substantial dilution by the end of the offensive; the 149th (Northumberland) Brigade, for example, received large numbers of replacements from East Anglia, Northamptonshire, London and the Midlands. By March 1917, a significant proportion of the men in the second-line 61st (2nd South Midland) Division came from outside the South Midlands due to the replacement of losses suffered at the Battle of Fromelles. By the end of the year, the same trend could be seen in the first-line 48th (South Midland) Division.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 203‚Äì204 The indiscriminate replacement of casualties prompted rueful comments about the damage being done to the nature of the Territorial Force. The historian C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, serving with the 1/4th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment, lamented that, by the end of 1916, the battalion had \\"lost its exclusive Berkshire character which, at the beginning of the war, had been its unique possession\\". For the 1/6th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, losses during the Battle of the Somme had damaged its \\"territorial influence\\".Beckett 2008 p. 67 Criticisms of the drafting system were voiced in the House of Commons, and territorial representatives expressed concern that the force's unique character was being lost.Beckett 2008 pp. 63, 68 Military authorities stated their desire to replenish units with replacements from the same regiment or regimental district, but stressed that the Military Service Acts had removed any obligation to do so and that military expediency sometimes necessitated not doing so.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 200‚Äì201 As the availability of men of military age dwindled, it became increasingly difficult to source replacements from some sparsely populated regions. The largely rurally recruited 48th (South Midland) and 54th (East Anglian) Divisions became increasingly diluted as the war progressed, while the more urbanised recruitment areas of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division allowed it to remain essentially a Lancashire formation throughout.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 204, 206 By the war's end, very few battalions still retained more than a handful of men who had embarked with them at the start of the war. The territorial units that fought in 1917 and 1918, subject to the same system of replacements as the rest of the British land forces, bore little resemblance beyond a geographic origin to those that had sailed in 1914 and 1915. By 1918, there was little to differentiate between regular, territorial and New Army divisions.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 209‚Äì210, 214 Territorial grievances Territorial War Medal Failure to guarantee the integrity of its units was the most contentious of several grievances felt by the territorials against what they perceived as a hostile and patronising attitude from the military authorities.Beckett 2004 p. 136 Territorial officers and specialists such as doctors, vets, drivers, cooks and dispatch riders received less pay than their counterparts in New Army and regular units. Officers were considered junior to their regular counterparts of the same rank, leading some to remove the 'T' insignia from their uniforms as a badge of inferiority, and commanders of second-line brigades and third- line battalions were a rank lower than their regular counterparts.Mitchinson 2014 pp. 42, 45‚Äì47, 212 Although the Territorial Force provided many officers for the regular army, very few were appointed to higher commands, despite pre- war promises by Haldane that they would be. In 1918, government efforts to defend the military record on senior territorial promotions failed to acknowledge that most were temporary and in home units. Ian Macpherson, Under- Secretary of State for War, conceded that just ten territorial officers commanded brigades and only three had been promoted to highest grade of General Staff Officer.Beckett 2011 pp. 233‚Äì235 The territorials received scant recognition for their early enthusiasm. The Army Council refused to grant any special decorations for those who had accepted the Imperial Service Obligation before the war. The Territorial War Medal, awarded to those who had volunteered for service overseas in the first months of the war, was denied to volunteers who had been held back even though they rendered invaluable service training the rest of the army. Those who served in India received no campaign medal.Dennis pp. 50‚Äì53 The three territorial divisions sent to India in 1914 felt penalised by their early readiness. The men were placed on lower, peacetime rates of pay; gunners had to purchase equipment that should have been issued; officers attending courses were not fully reimbursed for their hotel expenses; and non-commissioned officers promoted after arrival had to protest before they received the pay increase to which they were entitled.Mitchinson 2014 p. 77 The divisions were still stationed there at the war's end, despite promises made by Kitchener that they would be redeployed to France within a year. Indications that they would be the first to be demobilised proved false when the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Afghan War forced the government to retain some territorial units in India until 1920.Beckett 2011 p. 227Beckett 2004 p. 135 The poor treatment of the territorials in India resulted in low support across south-west England and the home counties, the regions from which the three divisions were recruited, when the Territorial Force was reconstituted after the war.Mitchinson 2014 p. 187 =County Territorial Associations= A member of the Volunteer Training Corps directing troops arriving on leave at Victoria Station The County Territorial Associations experienced a steady erosion of responsibilities as the war progressed. Although disappointed by Kitchener's decision to bypass the Territorial Force, the associations assisted in recruiting the New Army alongside their own work raising and equipping territorial units. The Cambridgeshire, Denbighshire and East Riding associations, for example, together raised 11 New Army units in December 1914. The associations performed remarkably well in equipping their units, despite the fact that the War Office prioritised New Army units and, in the case of the Leicestershire associations, threatened to penalise manufacturers who dealt with any institution other than the War Office. The competitive nature of the system led to supply according to highest bidder rather than military necessity and, in consequence, inflated prices. As a result, the territorials were relieved of responsibility for the purchase and supply of equipment in favour of a centralised system in May 1915.Steppler pp. 115‚Äì116Simkins 2007 pp. 272‚Äì274Mitchinson 2014 p. 40 In December 1915, direct recruitment into the Territorial Force ceased. The next year, the associations were rendered largely superfluous when administration of several territorial services, including the second- and third-line units and Home Service Battalions, was taken from them.Mitchinson 2014 p. 50 In March 1917, many territorial depots were shut down as a result of War Office centralisation, and later the same year territorial records offices were closed. The Council of County Territorial Associations met in September to discuss the loss of responsibilities and the apparent erosion of the Territorial Force. A delegation in October to Lord Derby, Secretary of State for War, resulted only in the associations being given responsibility for the Volunteer Training Corps (VTC). Regarded as a poor substitute for the Territorial Force, the VTC was recruited from those not eligible for active service, mainly due to age. It was widely denigrated as \\"Grandpa's Regiment\\" and \\"George's Wrecks\\", from the armbands inscribed with the letters \\"GR\\" (for Georgius Rex), which was all the uniform the government was initially willing to provide them with.Beckett 2008 pp. 74‚Äì75 Post-war Winston Churchill, architect of the Territorial Army, c.1920 Between August 1914 and December 1915, the Territorial Force had attracted nearly 726,000 recruits, approximately half the number that had volunteered for the New Army over the same period.Beckett 2008 p. 58 It had raised 692 battalions by the war's end, compared with 267 regular or reserve battalions and 557 New Army battalions. The force deployed 318 battalions overseas, compared to the New Army's 404, and fielded 23 infantry and two mounted divisions on foreign soil, compared to the New Army's 30 infantry divisions.Beckett 2004 p. 132 Seventy-one awards of the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award for valour, were made to territorial soldiers, including two of only three bars ever awarded.Beckett 2008 pp. 81‚Äì82 The territorials had suffered some 577,000 casualties in the period 1914‚Äì1920.Beckett 2011 p. 243 Compromised in conception and ridiculed in peacetime, the Territorial Force had filled the gap between what was effectively the destruction of the regular army in the opening campaigns of the war and the arrival of the New Armies in 1915. Demobilisation of the Territorial Force commenced in December 1918, and the debate about its reconstitution was begun.Beckett 2011 p. 244 The service rendered by the force during the war and the considerable political influence it possessed ensured its survival, but there was an extended discussion about what role it should play. In the absence of any invasion threat, there was no requirement to maintain a significant force for home defence, and a part-time body of volunteers could have no place in the imperial garrison. With conscription established as the means of expanding the regular army in a major conflict, which the Ten Year Rule anyway regarded as unlikely, there was no need to maintain a body of volunteers for this role. The only purpose military authorities could find for the Territorial Force was the provision of drafts to reinforce the army in medium-scale conflicts within the empire. Accordingly, the War Office recommended in March 1919 that the force should be liable for service overseas and receive no guarantees about unit integrity.Dennis pp. 38‚Äì45 Winston Churchill, the Secretary of State for War responsible for reconstituting the force, considered a mandatory imperial obligation unfair and resisted its imposition. The territorial representatives recognised the necessity of such an obligation, but opposed the force being used simply as a reserve of manpower for the army, rather than operating as a second line in its own brigades and divisions as Haldane had intended. Territorial support for the imperial obligation eventually persuaded Churchill to accept it, and concerns about unit integrity were allayed by \\"The Pledge\\", Churchill's promise that the force would be deployed as complete units and fight in its own formations. The final sticking point was resolved by the resurrection of the militia to provide reinforcement drafts to the regular army.Dennis pp. 55, 57‚Äì60 Another issue was military aid to the civil power during the industrial unrest that followed the war. The thinly-stretched army was reluctant to become involved, so Churchill proposed using the territorials. Concerns that the force would be deployed to break strikes adversely affected recruitment, which had recommenced on 1 February 1920, resulting in promises that the force would not be so used. The government nevertheless deployed the Territorial Force in all but name during the miner's strike of April 1921 by the hasty establishment of the Defence Force. The new organisation relied heavily on territorial facilities and personnel, and its units were given territorial designations. Territorials were specially invited to enlist. Although those that did were required to resign from the Territorial Force, their service in the Defence Force counted towards their territorial obligations, and they were automatically re-admitted to the Territorial Force once their service in the Defence Force was completed.Dennis pp. 60, 65‚Äì77 The Territorial Force was officially reconstituted in 1921 by the Territorial Army and Militia Act 1921 and renamed in October as the Territorial Army. The difficulties posed in the war by an auxiliary that maintained a separate identity from the regular army were still enshrined in the reconstituted auxiliary. They were finally addressed by the Armed Forces (Conditions of Service) Act, passed on the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, by which restrictions on territorial terms of service and transfer between units were removed and territorial status was suspended for the duration. The next war would be fought from the start by a single, integrated army.Beckett 2008 pp. 97, 110 See also * Territorial Force Nursing Service FootnotesReferencesBibliography         * * Category:Army Reserve (United Kingdom) Category:Military units and formations established in 1908 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1920 Category:Reserve forces of the United Kingdom ","title":"Territorial Force"},{"id":"466685","text":"Robert Alan Ezrin (born March 25, 1949) is a Canadian music producer and keyboardist, best known for his work with Lou Reed, Alice Cooper, Kiss, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, Peter Gabriel, Andrea Bocelli and Phish. As of 2010, Ezrin's career in music had spanned four decades and his production work continued into the 21st century, with acts such as Deftones and Thirty Seconds to Mars. Since co-founding interactive media company 7th Level in 1993, Ezrin has branched out into philanthropy, activism and being an eco-warrior, supporting several organizations and individuals fighting for the future of our planet. Music has also been introduced into this realm of his life, underpinning projects such as Music Rising and Young Artists for Haiti. Ezrin is also involved in education, co-founding the Nimbus School of Recording Arts in 2009. Ezrin is the winner of three Juno Awards. In 2011, Ezrin was awarded the Special Achievement Award at the 2011 SOCAN Awards held in Toronto. Early life Ezrin was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on March 25, 1949. He resided in the Forest Hill area of Toronto. Music and production career As of 2014, Ezrin continues to work as a record producer, arranger and songwriter, in addition to being involved with a variety of other projects in digital media, live production, film, television, and theatrical production. Ezrin has worked on recordings with numerous major artists, including Phish, Alice Cooper, Kiss, Pink Floyd, Balloonatic, Deep Purple, Lou Reed, The Kings, Hanoi Rocks, Taylor Swift, Peter Gabriel, Bonham, K'naan, 2Cellos, Kristin Chenoweth, Rod Stewart, Nine Inch Nails, The Jayhawks, Thirty Seconds to Mars, The Darkness, Jane's Addiction, Dr. John, Nils Lofgren, Berlin, Kansas, Julian Lennon, Joe Bonamassa and Deftones, among many others. Ezrin also recorded the very first demos for Toronto band Max Webster. Ezrin has been described by Alice Cooper as \\"our George Martin\\". Following his first ever production work on an album with Love it to Death in 1971, Ezrin embarked on a long-term collaboration that, by 1973, would see the release of the number one album, Billion Dollar Babies album, a year after the success of School's Out; Cooper subsequently became established as one of the biggest acts in the world. After the disbanding of Cooper's group, Ezrin continued his collaboration with Cooper, as the latter embarked upon a solo career. In 1975, Cooper released the Ezrin-produced album, Welcome To My Nightmare. Ezrin worked with Cooper not just as a producer, but also as a co-writer, arranger, and musician. Ezrin produced the best-selling KISS album, Destroyer, in 1976. As explained by Peter Criss during an interview in the documentary, KISS: Krazy Killer (1994), Ezrin co-wrote, arranged and performed the piano accompaniment to the song \\"Beth\\". Ezrin proceeded to produce two other albums with the band -- Music from \\"The Elder\\" and Revenge‚Äîand remains close to the band's members in the 21st century. Ezrin has worked with Pink Floyd on a number of occasions, co- producing the albums, The Wall, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, and The Division Bell. He has also co-written the songs \\"The Trial\\", \\"Signs of Life\\", \\"Learning to Fly\\", and \\"Take It Back\\". Ezrin also produced the 1988 Kansas album In the Spirit of Things, and received a writing credit for the song Ghosts and three other songs. In May 2009, Ezrin co-produced The Clearwater Concert at Madison Square Garden, celebrating the 90th birthday of musician and activist, Pete Seeger. More than 50 guest artists, including Bruce Springsteen, Dave Matthews, John Mellencamp, Ben Harper, Joan Baez, Tom Morello, Ani DiFranco, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson performed at the event. Ezrin also co- produced the PBS broadcast of the event. Since 2010, Ezrin has co-produced Peter Gabriel's album, Scratch My Back; co-produced The House Rules, by Christian Kane; and produced singles for K'naan, the Canadian Tenors, and young pop sensation, Fefe Dobson, for her album, Joy. Ezrin also reunited with Cooper, working on Cooper's Welcome 2 My Nightmare, on the corresponding live show, and numerous other related projects. He also mixed several projects, including Taylor Swift's Speak Now World Tour Live CD and DVD (2011), and an album by The Darkness (2012). In 2012, Ezrin remixed the KISS 1976 Double- Platinum album, Destroyer. Also, he produced albums for 2Cellos and rock legends Deep Purple. On Halloween, October 31, 2013, the band Phish debuted twelve new songs at a concert in Atlantic City, New Jersey which they announced as songs they were considering for a new album to be produced by Ezrin. The album, subsequently titled \\"Fuego,\\" was recorded at Ronnie's Place and Anarchy Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, Fame Recording Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama and Phish's own \\"The Barn\\" in Burlington, Vermont. Released on June 24, 2014, this was the band's 12th studio album and first since 2009. On October 7, 2016, the Vermont rock/jam band Phish released their 13th album, the Ezrin produced Big Boat featuring the first single \\"Breath And Burning\\". Ezrin worked with Andrea Bocelli on S√¨, Bocelli's first #1 album, both in the UK and USA. Live arena Ezrin produced a live and television extravaganza to reopen the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, US, starring Green Day and U2. He also worked on an album and live opera with L'Orchestra di Piazza Vittorio in Rome, Italy. Entrepreneurship In 1993, Ezrin co-founded a computer software company called 7th Level, which developed and published educational and entertainment CD-ROMs, including a highly popular and groundbreaking series of Monty Python games. In 1999, Ezrin cofounded Enigma Digital, an innovative internet radio provider, that was eventually sold to Clear Channel; Ezrin was later appointed vice-chairman of Clear Channel Interactive. Ezrin was also Chairman of Live Nation Artists Recordings in 2007 and the first half of 2008. In 2007, Ezrin joined the Board of Advisors of Tonic, an online company that describes itself as \\"humanity-conscious\\" and socially-responsible\\". Ezrin is also co-founder and vice chairman of Wow Unlimited Media. Education In 2009, Ezrin, along with Garth Richardson and Kevin Williams, cofounded the Nimbus School of Recording Arts in Vancouver, British Columbia (BC), Canada. Ezrin stated that his goal was to provide new engineers and producers with the hands-on teaching experience that he believed was no longer available from traditional recording studios. Ezrin's educational philosophy is that modern engineers and producers need to be proficient in a range of skills and that an effective education in the recording arts will also prepare a student for more general challenges in their lives and careers. Honor and recognition Ezrin was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in April 2004 and the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in March 2006. In 2011, Ezrin and Young Artist for Haiti won the Juno Award in Canada for \\"Single of the Year\\". Also in 2011, he was awarded an \\"Outstanding Contribution\\" at the Classic Rock Magazine Awards. In 2013, he was honoured with a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto. Ezrin was also honored in 2013 by The Royal Conservatory of Music, being named an Honorary Fellow of The Royal Conservatory. Philanthropy Ezrin is a board member of the Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation, a national initiative that supports music in US schools by donating musical instruments to under-funded music programs. He is also an Advisory Committee member of MusiCounts, the musical education initiative of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, that provides instruments to Canadian school music programs. He is co-founder, with U2's The Edge, of Music Rising, an initiative to preserve the musical culture of the Gulf coast region following the damage caused by the hurricanes and flooding of 2005. On February 18, 2010, Ezrin helped with the mobilization of the Young Artists for Haiti group. Fifty Canadian artists recorded a rendition of hip hop star K'naan's \\"Wavin' Flag\\" for the victims of the Haiti quake. The song was reworked by Ezrin to include specific lyrics for Haiti, with proceeds disseminated to Free the Children, War Child Canada, and World Vision Canada. The production raised over US$2 million. K'naan explained in regard to the initiation of the project: \\"I got a call from Randy [Lennox, president] at Universal [Music Canada] and Bob Ezrin. They had this idea that they wanted to do something lasting, that actually educates young people in Canada about Haiti and not let the fatigue of the subject wash over everybody and everybody just forget Haiti.\\" Ezrin is a Chairman Emeritus of the Los Angeles Mentoring Partnership and a past Trustee and Governor of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS). He is a board member of the Smilezone Foundation. Ezrin is also a board member of In Place of War, which promotes creativity in places of conflict to create positive social change. Film and television In 1982, Ezrin briefly appeared as the host of Enterprise, a City-TV panel show that replaced Dr. Morton Shulman's The Shulman File; he has also been a frequent interviewee for documentary films and television. Ezrin has created new theatrical, television, and live events with the @Radical.Media company, based in New York, including Jay-Z's feature film, Fade to Black. In 2012, Ezrin appeared in Artifact, a documentary film about the modern music business focused on the legal battle between Thirty Seconds to Mars and record label EMI. Personal life Ezrin is married to Janet Ezrin.

Oliver was re-elected as a UFO MLA in the 1929 election and was the sole (and last) United Farmers member in the legislature until 1941. In that year, he formally joined the Ontario Liberal Party and the cabinet of Premier Mitchell Hepburn as Minister of Public Works and Welfare after informally supporting the Liberals and attending their caucus meetings since 1934. Oliver quit the cabinet in late October 1942, in protest against Hepburn's leadership of the Liberal Party. Hepburn had quit as Premier of Ontario but refused to resign as leader, and appointed Gordon Daniel Conant as the new Premier without consulting the party. Oliver's resignation contributed to a crisis that eventually led to both Hepburn and Conant's resignations and a leadership convention in May 1943. Harry Nixon was elected the party's new leader. Oliver rejoined the cabinet under new Premier Harry Nixon as Deputy Premier, but Nixon's government was short-lived, going down to defeat in the October 1943 election placing third behind the victorious Progressive Conservatives and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation which became the Official Opposition. Oliver became the party's acting leader in the legislature 1945 after Hepburn, who had regained the leadership of the party, lost his seat in the 1945 provincial election. The Liberals, nevertheless, displaced the CCF and Oliver became Leader of the Opposition and then permanent leader of the party in 1947 by defeating four other candidates to win a leadership convention. He led the party through the 1948 election that again reduced the Liberals to third place behind the Tories and CCF. Oliver resigned the leadership in 1950, and was replaced by Walter Thomson. However, Thomson was unable to win election to the Legislature, so Oliver remained house leader. Oliver became party leader again from 1954 until 1958, including the 1955 election, but resigned due to caucus feuding. MPPs Albert Wren, who had placed second behind Oliver in the 1954 leadership convention, and Arthur Reaume attacked Oliver's leadership of the party as ineffectual and were expelled from caucus in 1957, shortly before Oliver resigned so that a new leadership convention could be held. Despite his experience, he was never able to lead his party to victory. Farquhar Oliver retired from the legislature in 1967, and died in 1989 at the age of 84. Farquhar Oliver was the nephew of British Columbia Premier John Oliver.

The show features Sheindlin adjudicating real-life small-claim disputes within a simulated courtroom set. Prior to the proceedings, all involved parties signed arbitration contracts agreeing to The show aired in first-run syndication, and was distributed by CBS Television Distribution. Judge Judy Sheindlin in 2012 First broadcast in 1996, the series won three Emmy awards and garnered high ratings among syndicated programming in the United States. Sheindlin and CBS renewed their contract through the program's 25th season (2020‚Äì21).‚ÄòJudge Judy‚Äô Extends Big Buck Contract With CBS Through 2020 Variety, March 2, 2015 In March 2020, Sheindlin announced the 25th season of the show would be the last, to be followed by a direct successor, Judy Justice. Court show background=Origins After Joseph Wapner was released from The People's Court on May 21, 1993, Sheindlin called up the program's producers, Ralph Edwards-Stu Billett Productions and Warner Bros. Television, and offered to do the show in his place, to which the receptionist responded, \\"Are you crazy, lady?\\". A Los Angeles Times article on Sheindlin's reputation as one of the toughest family court judges in the country caught the attention of 60 Minutes, which aired a segment on her on October 24, 1993. The segment brought her national recognition and first led to an offer for her to write her own book. Sheindlin accepted the book offer, writing Don't Pee On My Leg and Tell Me It's Raining. In early 1995 two former People's Court producers, Kaye Switzer and Sandi Spreckman (who later sued Sheindlin and CBS for compensation for discovering her), asked Sheindlin if she would like to preside over her own courtroom series, and she eventually accepted. Sheindlin and her producers originally wanted the show title to be \\"Her Honor\\" but the production company, Big Ticket Television, decided on calling it \\"Hot Bench\\" instead, even promoting the show as \\"Hot Bench With Judge Judy\\" for some time prior to the show's d√©but. However, Big Ticket ultimately decided on \\"Judge Judy\\". Petri Hawkins-Byrd, the court show's bailiff, was also Sheindlin's bailiff throughout her career in the Manhattan Family Court system. When Byrd found out about Sheindlin's show, he sent her a congratulatory letter, stating, \\"If you ever need a bailiff, I still look good in uniform.\\" She phoned Byrd at his home in California to accept his offer and he has been the show's bailiff since its debut. Byrd is the longest-running bailiff in courtroom programming history. Sheindlin has stated that the show's producers desired different individuals for the role, but she refused. Sheindlin appeared again on 60 Minutes on April 30, 2003. During the interview, Sheindlin stated: > I have a contract with the company to do the program through the 2006 > season. At that point, we will have produced this program for 10 years. > Right now, I would be satisfied with a good 10-year run. I think that would > really be phenomenal. It would be lovely if we could end on a high note and > for me to say \\"10 years and I still had people watching and I had a second > career that was a blast.\\" On September 14, 2015, Sheindlin began celebrating her 20th season anniversary presiding on Judge Judy. The program is the first in the court show genre to make it to 20 seasons without cancellation as well as the first to make it to this extent under one arbitrator. Three years later by September 2018, the Judge Mathis court show entered its 20th season and became the second and only other court show to accomplish this feat. Sheindlin's distinction as television's longest serving judge or arbitrator rewarded Sheindlin a place in the Guinness World Records on September 14, 2015. On-air format Each episode of Judge Judy began with an introductory preview of the main case, sensationalizing various moments of the case with dramatic music, voice-over commentary, graphics, etc. This was followed by the show's opening music video. At the beginning of each court proceeding, information regarding who is suing whom and what for was revealed originally by voice-over artist Michael Stull, who was replaced by voice-over artist, Jerry Bishop from the second season onwards. Bishop remained the show's announcer from 1997 until shortly before his death in 2020. As of the show's 25th season, Steve Kamer was the announcer. Sheindlin typically began each case by questioning the parties as to dates, times, locations and other facts central to the lawsuit. Monopolizing the discourse throughout the cases, Sheindlin would sometimes only listen to bits and pieces of each of the testimonies as she was quick to reply, impose her spiel and disallow responses that were not concise or made during her desire to speak. Sometimes, however, Sheindlin would allow one or both of the opposing litigants to recount the entirety of their testimony. While delivering their testimony, litigants were not allowed to hesitate and had to maintain fixed eye contact with Sheindlin at all times. Further, litigants were not allowed to speak out of turn or talk to each other. Like most modern court shows, cases on Judge Judy imitated small claims court cases in which civil trials (non-criminal cases) were heard and ruled on. Typically Sheindlin handled cases among former lovers, disputing neighbors, or family and friend relations. Disputes generally revolved around issues such as broken engagements, unpaid personal loans, contract breaches, personal injuries from other litigants or their pets, minor property damages (e.g., fender benders, carpet stains, etc.), the fate of jointly purchased household appliances and rightful ownership of property. As is standard practice in small claims court and most reality court shows alike, Judge Judy proceedings operated in the form of a bench trial (as opposed to its more common counterpart, the jury trial). Moreover, lawyers were not present and litigants had to represent themselves. Generally each show presented two cases, but infrequently, an episode would present a single long case, three shorter ones, or even four shorter ones. After expressing her views of the circumstances and behaviors of the litigants with regards to their testimonies, Sheindlin rendered the judgment either by finding for the plaintiff, or by dismissing the case specifically with or without prejudice. Any counterclaims filed were handled similarly to this. Counterclaims were handled subsequently in the same segment, though often cursorily by Sheindlin as many counterclaims on the program had been filed out of vindictiveness as opposed to legitimacy. At the end of each case, there was typically a monologue, where the litigators, and sometimes their witnesses, would express their feelings regarding the case directly to the viewers at home by speaking into the camcorder. Sometimes, however, these segments were omitted, especially after cases involving resentful litigants, too upset over the circumstances to remain in the studio and provide comment. Inner workings The producers of Judge Judy hired extras from an audience service who composed the entire studio. Paid audience members were easier to control due to agreements and employment. They didn't have to be trained or debriefed as much as the average person on how to act to make those in the spotlight look good. Producers also look for a certain demographic of individuals and seat them strategically throughout their audience. Most of these paid extras were aspiring actors. Though tickets were not offered for the show, arrangements could sometimes be made with Sheindlin's production staff to allow fans of the show into the audience. The extras could not dress casually, and no logos or brand names could be visible on their clothing. Extras were also instructed to appear as if they were having discussions with each other before and after each case, so Byrd made such announcements as \\"Order! All rise.\\" The audience was not to make any noises during the proceedings and, unlike other court shows, could not applaud the judge or rightful litigant upon praiseworthy remarks; although on some occasions when Sheindlin delivered a crushing remark for a particularly egregious or ludicrous act, the audience was seen laughing or applauding without Sheindlin silencing them. For the most part, however, Sheindlin was seen bringing the audience to order (with a fountain pen; she never used a gavel) and admonished them for engaging in any such noise throughout the cases. To acquire cases, the show generally used one of the following three options: * Its 60 to 65 researchers, spread out across the country, entered small claims courts and photocopied numerous cases. These photocopied cases were then sent to Judge Judy producers, who reviewed them all in search of lawsuits they believed made for good television. According to the show's producers, only 3% of the photocopied cases were worthy enough for television. * Its telephone number posting/announcement presented on each episode where interested individuals could call in with lawsuits. * Its website whereby lawsuits could be written out and submitted into the show. After one of these three processes, if the producers were interested, their employees would then call both parties and ask them questions relating to their lawsuit, making sure they were suitable for Judge Judy. If the parties agreed to be on the show and signed an arbitration contract, agreeing that arbitration in Sheindlin's court was final and couldn't be pursued elsewhere (unless Sheindlin dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice), their case would've aired on Judge Judy. The award limit on Judge Judy, as on most \\"syndi-court\\" shows (and most small claims courts in the U.S.), was $5,000. The award for each judgment was paid by the producers of the show from a fund reserved for the purpose. Sheindlin ruled by either A.) issuing a verdict of a specific dollar amount (not always in the full amount of what is requested and rarely if ever in excess of what was requested even if she believed complainants were deserving of more) or B.) by dismissing the lawsuit altogether. When ruled on in these manners, cases couldn't be refiled or retried elsewhere. However, if Sheindlin specifically dismissed the lawsuit \\"without prejudice\\", that lawsuit could be refiled and retried in another forum. In some instances, Sheindlin had dismissed cases without prejudice deliberately so that complainants pursued defendants in an actual court of law so that the defendants themselves were held financially accountable, as opposed to on the show. In such cases, Sheindlin had expressed particular aversion to the defendants in question. Further, Sheindlin had dismissed cases without prejudice when she had suspected both the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) of conspiring together just to gain monetary rewards from the program. Both the plaintiff(s) and the defendant(s) also received an appearance fee. The appearance fee amount had varied as between different litigants of the show: certain litigants had reported receiving a $500 appearance fee while others had reported receiving $100, and others $250. In addition to the appearance fee amount, litigants were paid $35 a day by the show. The litigants' stay lasted for the number of days that the show did taping for that week, which was two or three days. In addition, the airfare (or other means of travel) and hotel expenses of the litigants and their witnesses were covered by the show, and the experience was generally treated as an all-expense-paid vacation outside of the actual court case. If there was an exchange of property, Sheindlin signed an order, and a sheriff or marshal oversaw the exchange. Sheindlin saw only a half-page complaint and a defense response prior to the taping of the cases, sometimes only moments before. Most of the cases, not including any footage deleted to meet the time constraints of the show, usually lasted anywhere from twelve to forty-five minutes. Judge Judy, like most court programs, was inexpensive to produce and thus created considerable income. A budget for a week's worth of Judge Judy episodes was half the cost of a single network sitcom episode. Recordings and airings Three days every other week (two weeks a month), Sheindlin and her producers taped the court show. They usually produced ten to twelve cases for each day they taped the show. This makes for about a week's worth of episodes, all done within one day. Anywhere from thirty to thirty-six cases were taped over three days during the week. Sheindlin appeared as a guest on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on September 13, 2011. When asked by Kimmel how many days a month she works, Sheindlin replied, \\"Five days.\\" Sheindlin and her producers sometimes taped only five cases per day and two days per week. The show had fifty-two taping days a year. For each season, some 650 claims were brought to the set to be \\"presided\\" over by Judge Judy. This means approximately 15,600 claims had been brought to Judy Sheindlin's Hollywood set as of the end of its 23rd season (2018‚Äì19). For the most part, cases were taped all throughout the year except for two breaks Sheindlin and all of the staff members of her show had for the year. One of the two breaks included an extra week off in December, as the show was only taped one week out of that month because of the holidays. The other break was from mid-July (only taping one week in July) and all through August. According to members of the show, the reason for this break was that people were more interested in taking vacations than in filing lawsuits around that time. When the show premiered in September, only the best episodes of the ones taped before Sheindlin's break were selected to begin out the season. Thus, the first few weeks (the first week in particular) would consist of what the show felt to be its best episodes. In Sheindlin's words, \\"It's like drinking wine. You don't serve the really good bottle of wine third.\\" Altogether, there were 260 new episodes each season. There was at least one new episode for every weekday, with the exception of a few hiatuses during most of the summer, a couple of holidays, and as of more recent seasons, early spring as well (much of March and April). The cases were all pre-recorded for editing purposes and would usually air one to three months after being taped. The cases were mixed up and not shown in order of when they were recorded. While the cases taped in March ended the seasons, the cases taped throughout April, May, June, and July started out each season in September and lasted through October. Throughout the very beginning of each season, two new Judge Judy episodes aired per day. After two weeks, this was reduced to one new airing a day, followed by a repeat. There were also various other moments throughout the year where two new episodes were shown for a few weeks. This had sometimes included January when the show returned from its winter hiatus. Two new episodes were also shown daily during the \\"sweeps\\" months of November, February, and May. Unlike other television programs, the Judge Judy season finale did not air in April or May; rather, it aired in June, July, or August. When the season finale was extended to July or August, most of the summer episodes preceding it were repeats with new episodes that were few and far in-between. Two DVDs, featuring \\"memorable cases,\\" had been released by the show: the first in 2007, \\"Judge Judy: Justice Served,\\" and the second in 2008, \\"Judge Judy: Second To None.\\" Location Judge Judy taped at the Sunset Bronson Studios on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. In alternating weeks, Sheindlin, who owns a home in New York among other cities/states, flew out on her private jet to tape Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. As of 2014, the Judge Judy set was located directly beside the set of the courtroom series Sheindlin created and produces, Hot Bench. Both shows are taped are the same studio. Previous to that, the space directly beside Sheindlin's set was used for the courtroom series Paternity Court for the 2013‚Äì14 season. Prior to that, the space was used for Judge Judys long-running sister show Judge Joe Brown until Judge Joe Browns 2013 cancellation. Like Judge Judy, Judge Joe Brown was also produced by Big Ticket Entertainment. The two shows alternated taping weeks. Despite the show being taped primarily in California, it displayed various images of New York City upon returning from commercial breaks, including a subway train and official signs bearing \\"State of New York\\" and \\"Family Court\\" (Sheindlin was previously a New York family court judge) within the letterbox-like graphics used going to and from breaks since the ninth season. The set featured an American flag and New York state flag behind Judge Judy Sheindlin's seat. Remodeling Over its existence, the show had changed very little from season to season. Most modifications to the program had been done in minute detail, such as to the show's book shelf display seen near the courtroom entrance. Aesthetically, the show's theme song, graphics, and color scheme were the only aspects that have changed repeatedly over the course of its lifespan. The ninth season (2004‚Äì05) was one of few seasons in which the show underwent major remodeling when music for the show's opening, closing, and to/from commercial portions were modified. A modern version of a melody from Beethoven's 5th Symphony was then adopted as the show's opening theme song. This arrangement was composed by Non-Stop Music Productions. For its scenes, Sheindlin was shown in a different courtroom from her own, approaching the camera, followed by folding her arms and smiling at the camera. This was followed by showing various scenes of her presiding over different cases. As part of these modifications, the show's introductory previews, graphics, and images all began showing up in falu red. Prior to the ninth season, the show used an original tune for its theme song composed by Bill Bodine. From the show's debut through its eighth season, various versions of this original tune were used, the show making moderate modifications to the tune every few seasons, as shown here and here. The actual full-length version of this original musical, which never played during the show's intro, played during the lengthier litigant-afterthought- segments as shown (full-length musical used for 1999-00, 2000‚Äì01, 2001‚Äì02). From seasons five through eight, the opening music video commenced with an approaching scene towards a computer animated courthouse display up until that scene entered into the courthouse. From there, several shots of Sheindlin gesticulating from her bench‚Äîas though presiding over various cases‚Äîwere displayed in motion. These motioning images eventually developed into the courthouse logo that represents the program (the logo always displayed within the letter \\"D\\" in \\"Judy\\") by the end of this opening music video. The music video in seasons prior to this used relatively similar music with disparities in scenes, images, instrumental sound type and theme song length. Further, the first season of the show used blue and gold on the end part of Judge Judy intro along with Purple, Pink, & Blue blended in to represent the rest of the show. Starting with second season until the fourth season used graphics and images that were sea green and saffron. Blue and saffron then came to represent the show starting with the fifth season lasting up to the eighth season of the show before the show's current color scheme. By the show's sixth season (2001‚Äì02), music and graphics used in the introductory previews no longer resembled the rest of the program as they had previously, but instead used a high blue color scheme and a different song for each episode/intro preview. While the introductory preview's inconstant tunes have continued to the present season, the color scheme in the introductory previews began resembling the color scheme used in the rest of the program (falu red) once again by the ninth season. Changes for the tenth season intro was made with the \\"10 Years\\" caption depicted right next to the \\"Judge Judy\\" logo in the intro to celebrate the show‚Äôs 10th Anniversary. Changes to the intro for the thirteenth season was the Judge caption on the top of the logo changed from silver to red. Each opening music video consisted of voice-over artist Jerry Bishop stating: \\"You are about to enter the courtroom of Judge Judith Sheindlin. The people are real. The cases are real. The rulings are final. This is Judge Judy.\\" Originally between the statements \\"The rulings are final\\" and \\"This is Judge Judy\\" was the statement, \\"This is her courtroom.\\" This was removed in 2004. Beginning in September 2012, the show made a switch to high definition with its 17th season. The bumpers between commercials are also in HD, although most on-screen graphics such as plaintiff and defendant descriptions are framed to fit a 4:3 aspect ratio. By the 20th season beginning in September 2015, the show began using a shortened, scanty version of the same intro it had been using for 10 years since its 9th season. Both the Beethoven remix and intro had been curtailed. The present intro only stated \\"You are about to enter the courtroom of Judge Judith Sheindlin. This is Judge Judy.\\" In addition to not using much of an intro theme any longer, a \\"20th anniversary\\" caption was depicted above the \\"Judge Judy\\" logo in the intro. These were the only two updates for season 20. Late into the show's 23rd season, Sheindlin drastically altered her short hairdo that she had sported since the show's beginnings into a very low trim bounded by a clip-on ponytail at the back of her head, sparking considerable negative reviews from viewers and media spectators alike to the point her Facebook moderator admonished viewers that they would be deleting commentary about the clip-on ponytail. Her bailiff, Petri Hawkins-Byrd, admitted to a preference for the original hairdo. Sheindlin described changing her hairstyle as being done for the purposes of a simpler lifestyle, that sporting the former was becoming too laborious for her. Episode specials=Primetime Judge Judy On May 20, 2014, CBS aired a one-hour special called Judge Judy Primetime which aired at 8 p.m. ET/PT. The special was a combination of reshown clips from the 1993 60 Minutes Special on Sheindlin, as well as a few never-previously-seen cases. The special marked Judge Judys first airing in primetime, a landmark for court shows which are typically limited to daytime or late night hours. Although the special didn't rank nearly as high as Dancing with the Stars (14.86 million) and The Voice (11.57 million), it brought in 5.66 million viewers, enough to make it the night's top rated show on CBS. In addition, the special came in just behind American Idol, which brought in 6.61 million viewers. Contrived case At least one case in the series was allegedly contrived by the litigants just to receive monetary payment from the program. In April 2013, former litigants from a 2010 airing of the show revealed they conspired together in fabricating a lawsuit in which the logical outcome would be to grant payment to the plaintiff. The operation, devised by musicians Kate Levitt and Jonathan Coward, was successful: Sheindlin awarded the plaintiff (Levitt) $1,000. The litigants involved also walked away with an appearance fee of $250 each and an all-expense-paid vacation to Hollywood, California. In reality, all the litigants in question‚Äîplaintiffs and defendants alike‚Äîwere friends who split the earnings up among each other. It was also reported that the show's producers were suspicious of the sham all along, but chose to look the other way. The lawsuit was over the fictitious death of a cat as a result of a television crushing it.  Curb Your Enthusiasm pseudo-Judge Judy case featuring Sheindlin  Sheindlin and her program appeared on the November 26, 2017, broadcast of Curb Your Enthusiasm, presiding over a sketch comedy court case with Larry David as the plaintiff who unsuccessfully sued over custody of a sick plant. The pseudo-Judge Judy case assumed the appearance of an actual case from Sheindlin's program, taking place from the show's courtroom set with trademarked voice-over briefs, theme music and audience response. Judge Judy Sheindlin Judge Judy Sheindlin Judge Judy Sheindlin was born on October 21, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York, to German-Jewish parents Murray and Ethel Blum. Sheindlin described her father, a dentist, as \\"the greatest thing since sliced bread\\" and her mother as \\"a meat-and-potatoes kind of gal.\\" It was reported in October 2012 that Sheindlin had a $45 million yearly contract with CBS Television Distribution, in effect until 2015 and up $20 million from 2007. It was later reported in October 2013 that Sheindlin was the highest paid TV star, earning $47 million per year for Judge Judy, which translates into just over $900,000 per workday (she works 52 days per year). In 2018, Sheindlin reportedly earned $147 million; $100 million from the sale of the present and future video library of her show to CBS, in addition to $47 million, her regular salary. Sheindlin had gained a reputation for her tough judicial approach in both the family court and televised court, also known widely for her no-nonsense fact-finding, restive nature, and incisive impositions that dismiss attempts at debate. In line with these attributes, her program had been touted as \\"a show where justice is dispensed at the speed of light.\\" Loosely related was her resoluteness in opinions and rulings, often resulting in the parties arguing, debating and excuse-making to no avail. Judy- isms Strict in her management of the proceedings, Sheindlin coerces precise compliance with rules and was very quick to scold or even punish what she perceived as disobedience, misbehavior or even annoyance. And as result of her gruff disposition, volatile temper, and cheeky treatment, taglines such as \\"Justice with an Attitude\\" had been used to characterize the program. As examples of this, Sheindlin had regularly made such remarks as: * ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the boss, applesauce!‚Äù * \\"Baloney!\\" * \\"Do I have 'stupid' written over my forehead?\\" * \\"I'm here because I'm smart, not because I'm young and gorgeous, although I am\\" * \\"If you live to be 100, you will never be as smart as I am, sir\\" * \\"Clearly you are not wrapped too tight\\" * \\"Where did you think you were coming to today, the beach?!\\" *\\"I'm speaking!\\" *\\"Listening ears!\\" *\\"Beauty fades. Dumb is forever. That goes for both boys and girls.\\" *\\"It doesn't work on me! I have a husband at home, so IT doesn't work on me.\\" *\\"There are no new stories, there's just a new face.\\" *\\"I'm √ªber successful.\\" *\\"That's my middle name: fair.\\" * \\"If you interrupt again madam, your case is dismissed, and I'm throwing you out. Do we understand each other?\\" * \\"I've been in this business for over 40 years\\" * \\"Do I look like I need help from you?\\" * \\"That's a lot of who shot John\\" * \\"This is my playpen\\" * \\"Shhhhhhh\\" Sheindlin's regular phrases on the program had become known as \\"Judyisms\\".The Insider Online: Articles tagged with judge-judy Some of these Judyisms were intended to provide a lesson, such as \\"A good deed never goes unpunished\\", \\"Beauty fades, dumb is forever\\", \\"If It doesn't make sense, it's not true\\", \\"Do you know when teenagers are lying? When their mouths move.\\" Sheindlin had used the position of television arbitrator to impart guidance, direction, and life lessons not only to her litigants but her viewers and public at large. An example of guidance often stressed by Sheindlin was to be independent through employment, especially so as to not live off the government where unwarranted or other people directly where oppression from or friction with the provider may eventuate. In the former, Sheindlin could often be quoted as stating, \\"No, you aren't supporting yourself. Byrd and I are supporting you.\\" Sheindlin had stated that the main message she wants viewers to take from her program is that people must take responsibility for their actions and do the right thing.Judge Judy Sheindlin ‚Äì Keep It Simple, Stupid ‚Äì Harper Collins (2000), pg. 87. Reception=Nielsen ratings by season 1996‚Äì1998 Judge Judy went on the air in September 1996. By the end of October of that year, the show was averaging only a 1.5 rating, putting it in the mid-rank of the 159 syndicated shows on the air. At that time, it was never expected that the show's ratings would ever compete with highly successful daytime TV shows of that era, such as The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Rosie O'Donnell Show and The Jerry Springer Show. According to Biographys documentary film on Sheindlin, \\"Judge Judy: Sitting in Judgment\\" (aired February 21, 2000), producers of Judge Judy were disappointed that the show was barely making it on the radar. However, it did not take long for the court show to pick up momentum as Judge Judy rose to a 2.1 rating by the end of that first season. By its 2nd season (1997‚Äì98), the court show had already risen into the 4 ratings ranges, averaging a 4.3. The 3rd season (1998‚Äì99) of Judge Judy was the show's first season as the highest-rated program in daytime television, having surpassed the highly rated Jerry Springer Show and even then daytime powerhouse The Oprah Winfrey Show for the first time (King World Productions which launched Oprah was a corporate sibling of CBS Television Distribution, which distributed Judge Judy): the program's ratings more than doubled to a 5.6 for that season, marking Judge Judy as an early success. It was due, in part, to this early success that daytime television began to feature more court programming, such as a revival of The People's Court that re-debuted in fall 1997. In 1999, Judge Judy moved from Worldvision Enterprises to Paramount Domestic Television, which also distributed her stablemate Judge Joe Brown and eventually Judge Mills Lane. Many other retired judges were given their own court shows in syndication due in large part to Sheindlin's popularity. These include Greg Mathis, Glenda Hatchett, Alex Ferrer, Maria Lopez, Karen Mills- Frances, Cristina Perez, David Young, and many others. In addition, the series helped to spawn various nontraditional court programs. These include the reality-based revival of Divorce Court, which was originally presided over by Mablean Ephriam from 1999-2006 and Lynn Toler from 2006-2020 and will be now helmed by Faith Jenkins; the short-lived Power of Attorney, capturing various high-profile attorneys arguing cases for litigants in front of Andrew Napolitano; Street Court, which took litigation outside of the courtroom; Jury Duty, featuring an all-celebrity jury hearing cases presided over by Bruce Cutler; etc. Furthermore, the role of Judge Judy in the rise in popularity of daytime court shows enabled several other non-real life judges to preside over courts, such as Nancy Grace, Jeanine Pirro, and Gloria Allred. Also, partly due to Judge Judy's popularity, the producers of The People's Court decided to replace Ed Koch with Judy's husband, Jerry Sheindlin, as their presiding judge during The People's Courts present incarnation 3rd season/overall series 15th season (1999‚Äì2000); this meant that husband and wife would be either part of the same afternoon lineup or competing for ratings against each other. This experiment, however, did not last long as midway through The People's Courts fourth season, Jerry was replaced by the show's current judge, Marilyn Milian. 1999‚Äì2006 For its 4th season (1999‚Äì00), Judy's ratings exploded to their highest to date, peaking at a 9.3 rating. At this point, Sheindlin's courtroom series was still more than ever the highest rated program in daytime. It was also at this point that Judge Judy held a record of increasing its ratings for each successive season since its debut. Because of the program's success, Judge Judy began airing at better time periods. It was by the show's 5th season (2000‚Äì01) that Judy's streak of growing in ratings from season to season since its debut had ceased. However, the court show still remained the highest-rated program in daytime that season with a 5.6 rating. By the 6th season (2001‚Äì02), Judy was no longer the highest-rated program in daytime, beaten out by The Oprah Winfrey Show. The court show averaged a 5.0 rating that season. Likewise, for her 7th season (2002‚Äì03), she also averaged a 5.0. For her 8th season (2003‚Äì04), Sheindlin finally reversed the season-to-season downward turn in her ratings by averaging a 7.1.Of the seven running court shows during the 2004‚Äì05 season, most of them earned a 3.63 rating; however, Judge Judy pulled in a 7.5 rating for that season (the show's 9th). For her 10th season (2005‚Äì06), Judge Judy averaged a 4.8 rating. Judge Judy averaged 4.6 rating for her 11th season (2006‚Äì07). Meanwhile, other programs in the genre were trailing Sheindlin from a vast distance (as has been the case since the debut of Judge Judy): Judge Joe Brown averaged a 2.9 rating; The People's Court averaged a 2.7; Judge Mathis averaged a 2.4; Divorce Court averaged a 2.0; Judge Alex averaged 1.9; Judge Hatchett averaged a 1.5; rookies-- Cristina's Court averaged a 1.4, and Judge Maria Lopez came in last, averaging a 1.0 rating. 2007‚Äì2011 For its 12th season (2007‚Äì08), Judge Judy averaged a 4.8 rating (4.8 HH AA%/7.4 HH GAA% rating) and 9.9 million average daily viewers. Judy was the only first-run syndication program to increase in ratings for that season from the previous, leading CBS to immediately extend her contract through the 2012‚Äì13 season. For its 13th season (2008‚Äì09), the show averaged a 4.2 rating (4.2 HH AA%/6.5 HH GAA% rating) and 9.02 million average daily viewers. Its 14th season (2009‚Äì10) marked the first season in nearly a decade since the 2000‚Äì01 season that any daytime television program had been able to surpass The Oprah Winfrey Shows ratings (Judge Judy is also the show in question that during the 2000‚Äì01 television season surpassed The Oprah Winfrey Show in daytime TV ratings): Judy broke Winfrey's near decade- long streak with a 4.4 rating (4.4 HH AA%/6.9 HH GAA% rating) and 9.6 million average daily viewers. It was also at that point that Sheindlin's courtroom series became the highest rated show in all of daytime television programming. Judy secured this title in its 15th season (2010‚Äì11) as the program remained ahead of Oprah in her [Oprah] final season and the highest-rated daytime television offering, averaging a 5.11 rating and 9.6 million viewers. During this season, Judy also became the highest rated show in first-run syndication. Late that same season in May 2011, as a result of continued high ratings, CBS again extended Sheindlin's contract, this time through the 2014‚Äì15 season (the show's 19th). In the first post-Oprah television season, the court show continued its reign as the most dominant show in daytime and also became the top-rated show in syndication, its 16th season (2011‚Äì12) racking up a 7.0 rating and 9.29 million average daily viewers. As the top-rated show in all of syndication at this point, Sheindlin defeated first-run syndication programs and off-network syndication programs (rerun episodes of programs off their original network). The title of overall syndication leader was previously held by off-network syndicated program Two and a Half Men (2010‚Äì11) and before that, first-run syndicated program Wheel of Fortune (2009‚Äì10). :Judge Judys ratings boost in its 16th season and late into the show's 15th season was at least partly due to Nielsen's change in methodology, in April 2011. This variation benefits programs that air multiple, differing episodes a day. The updated method is totalling ratings points through adding all viewings for each daily episode‚Äìeven if one of those viewings come from an individual already counted in as having watched another of the show's daily episodes. For example, as Judge Judy airs two different episodes per day, two ratings points are counted for every one person who has watched both the first and second daily airings. This is as opposed to one person's viewing of the two daily episodes amounting to only one ratings point. Prior to the convert, the latest method was only used in GAA numbers, while the previous method was used in average audience measure. Some court shows air in one hour blocks and thus do not benefit at all from the updated method.Worth noting, however, is that shows airing multiple daily episodes may not directly benefit monetarily as the rating system that local stations use to sell to advertisers is based upon the prior method. 2012‚Äì2016 For its 17th season (2012‚Äì13), Judge Judy once again pulled in a 7.0 household rating. The series delivered 9.63 million average daily viewers that season, growing by +32,000 viewers over the prior season. Despite this, Judy lost its 1st place spot as the ratings leader in all of syndication that season, descending to 2nd place, only a tad behind The Big Bang Theory (off-network syndicate) which took home a 7.1 for that season. Still and all, this was the 3rd season in a row that Judy earned the title of ratings leader in all of first-run syndication. Moreover, this was the 4th consecutive season that Judy was the ratings leader in all of daytime television programming. For the 18th season (2013‚Äì14), Judy rose to a 7.2 household rating and brought in 9.94 million viewers, gaining 8% over its prior season. Also for this season, the show reclaimed the title as highest rated program in all of daytime (5th consecutive time, 8th time overall) and all of syndication (3rd time). The show's 19th season (2014‚Äì15) pulled in a 7.0 household rating and remained the highest rated program in both daytime television as well as all of syndication. The 20th season (2015‚Äì16) was Judy's 3rd consecutive year as syndication's top strip, the court show averaging a 7.0 full-season household rating. 2017‚Äìpresent For its 21st season (2016‚Äì17), Judge Judy trounced all of its competitors in daytime and all of syndication. The court show scored a 6.8 household rating for its 21st season. For the 22nd season (2017‚Äì18), Judy attained a 6.9 live plus same day household average, well ahead of anything else in syndication. It marked the show's 5th straight year as the leader in all of syndication ratings and the 9th straight year as the leader in first-run syndication ratings. For the 23rd season (2018‚Äì19), it was reported by Nielsen that Judy topped first-run syndication ratings for the 10th straight year with 6.8 household rating. Longevity Judge Judy, which premiered on September 16, 1996, reportedly revitalized the court show genre. Only two other arbitration-based reality court shows preceded it, The People's Court (its first life canceled in 1993 from low ratings) and Jones & Jury (lasting only the 1994‚Äì95 season, short-lived from low ratings). Sheindlin has been credited with introducing the \\"tough\\" adjudicating approach into the judicial genre, which has led to several imitators. The only two court shows that outnumber Judge Judys seasons, The People's Court and Divorce Court, have both lasted via multiple disunited lives of production and shifting arbiters (and in its pre-1999 form, the latter was dramatized via court transcripts of past proceedings). Thus Sheindlin's span as a television jurist or arbitrator has lasted longer than any other‚Äîa distinction that earned her a place in the Guinness World Records in September 2015. With no cancellations or temporary endings in its series run, Judge Judy also has the longest-lasting individual production life of any court show. In March 2015, Sheindlin and CBS Television Distribution extended their contract through the program's 25th season (2020‚Äì21). Sheindlin revealed in a March 2020 interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that Judge Judy will officially conclude its series run, followed by the new Judy Justice program. Awards A three time Emmy Award winner, Judge Judy won its first Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program in 2013, its 15th nomination. It was the first long- running, highly rated court show to win an Emmy. The court show won Emmys in 2016 and 2017 respectively. Audience makeup Judge Judys daytime audience was composed of approximately seventy-five percent women and twenty-five percent men. In February 2014, it was reported that Judge Judy's audience was mostly composed of older women, African Americans and Latinos. CriticismsSheindlin vs. Joseph Wapner= Despite her widespread popularity, Sheindlin's behavior and treatment of the parties that have appeared before her has often been the subject of criticism. Regular viewers of the program have also been criticized as sadistic for their delight in watching Sheindlin engage in her typical behaviors. One such example of criticism has come from the first star of arbitration-based reality court shows, Joseph Wapner. Wapner, who presided over The People's Court from 1981 to 1993, was a long-time critic of Sheindlin. On November 26, 2002, Wapner criticized Judge Judy's courtroom behavior, stating \\"She is not portraying a judge as I view a judge should act. Judge Judy is discourteous, and she's abrasive. She's not slightly insulting. She's insulting in capital letters.\\" Judge Judy replied through her publicist, stating, \\"I refuse to engage in similar mud slinging. I don't know where or by whom Judge Wapner was raised. But my parents taught me when you don't have something nice to say about someone, say nothing. Clearly, Judge Wapner was absent on the day that lesson was taught.\\" Since then, Wapner had stated, \\"She is a disgrace to the profession. She does things I don't think a judge should do. She tells people to shut up. She's rude. She's arrogant. She demeans people. If she does this on purpose, then that's even worse. Judges need to observe certain standards of conduct. She just doesn't do it and I resent that. The public is apt to gain the impression that this is how actual judges conduct themselves. It says 'judge' on the nameplate on the bench and she's wearing a robe.\\" Sheindlin had stated, \\"As a young person, when I had watched The People's Court. . . I said 'you know what, I could do that.' And at least as well because while Joe Wapner is a very good judge, [he] didn't have much of a sense of humor. And I always knew from a very practical perspective that you have to marry those two things in order to be successful in entertainment.\\" In a November 2013 interview with Larry King, Sheindlin was asked whether she enjoyed watching Wapner on The People's Court. She replied, \\"Meh! Oatmeal!\\" Following this, King asked her what if any other television judges then did she enjoy, to which Sheindlin answered \\"Mills Lane\\" of Judge Mills Lane. Acclaim In a September 2014, Rickey Smiley Morning Show interview, Judge Mathis (second longest reigning TV judge/arbitrator, three seasons behind Sheindlin with 20 seasons as of 2018‚Äì19) was asked what three other court show judges he'd most enjoy sharing a meal with. For his first choice, he answered (laughing) \\"Are you kidding?! It would be Judge Judy at the head of the table. Oh my goodness, that Judge Judy is something else.\\" His second choice was Judge Marilyn Milian, and third Judge Mills Lane. In August 2010, rapper, singer and songwriter Nicki Minaj stated that she has an obsession with Judge Judy and that all of her free time is spent watching the program.(August 7, 2010). \\"Nicki Minaj Live Q&A; Pt. 6 ‚Äì Cartoons, Favorite Shows & Spare Time\\" . billboard.com. Retrieved July 24, 2015. In February 2013, the head football coach for the San Francisco 49ers, Jim Harbaugh, was asked about the importance of truthfulness and enthusiastically remarked, \\"Somebody that's not truthful? That's big to me. I'm a big fan of the Judge Judy show. When you lie in Judge Judy's courtroom, it's over. Your credibility is completely lost, and you stand no chance of winning that case. So I learned that from her. It's very powerful and true. If somebody lies to you, how can you trust anything they ever say after that?\\" A couple months later, Harbaugh would even attend tapings of Judge Judy along with his father as audience members. As part of the experience, Harbaugh and his father had lunch with Sheindlin and visited with her both before and after tapings. After meeting Sheindlin and seeing cases in person, Harbaugh stated, \\"I've never seen Judy adjudicate one improperly. She is so smart. She is so good. I could sit there and watch those cases all day. I really could. It's fun to watch somebody that does their job well. I could watch Judge Judy do cases all day. I could watch people play football who do their job really well. People who direct traffic. I get a real kick out of watching people who direct traffic do it. I've done it for hours. I like football the most, but Judge Judy is right up there. She's the best.\\" Brad Adgate, senior vice president of research for Horizon Media, said \\"Judge Judy is the new Oprah of daytime TV-actually, she was [already] beating Oprah while Oprah was still on.\\" While he was President and CEO of CBS Corporation, Leslie Moonves stated, \\"Over the last few decades, there have been very few shows that have achieved the remarkable success that she has. Not only has Judy sustained that success year after year, how many shows grow in their 15th or 16th year in syndication? She started as a fresh voice and she's been a remarkable presence in daytime television ever since.\\" Many regular viewers and supporters of Judge Judy had defended Sheindlin's treatment of the parties that have appeared before her by describing the parties as an \\"endless parade of idiots\\" that Sheindlin had to put up with. Lawsuits involving Judy, executive producer, Big Ticket Television, and CBS Television Distribution Judge Judy executive producer Randy Douthit had been sued twice by former staff members of the Judge Judy program for alleged wrongful termination, discriminatory practice, and mismanagement while on the job. Racism termination lawsuit In December 2007, Jonathan Sebastien, a former producer of the Judge Judy show of seven years, filed a lawsuit against the production company in L.A. County Superior Court for wrongful termination. Sebastien claimed that when he proposed certain cases for the show involving black litigants, Douthit turned them down with his alleged reasons being he did not want to see any more black people; their behaviors were too ghetto and more suited for television jurist Joe Brown; and they needed more pretty, upscale white people. Sebastien claimed that in January 2007, he objected to the alleged discrimination in a meeting and was verbally abused by Douthit. Three months later on March 30, Sebastien stated he was fired with the reason given that rating numbers were down. Sebastien claimed that the real reason he was fired was because he opposed his boss's alleged \\"discriminatory selection process\\". Ageism lawsuit That same day in December 2007, the show's former associate producer Karen Needle was also fired. She later sued Douthit, claiming that she was wrongfully terminated because she was too old, 64 at the time. Sheindlin was not named as a defendant. Needle, who helped book audiences for the program, stated the reason she was given for being fired was \\"unspecified conflict from her audience work.\\" Needle said she began suffering from back pain, sometimes even resorting to lying on the ground in pain, and when she asked her bosses for a new chair, nothing was done. According to the complaint, two weeks before Needle was fired, she took off four days to assist her ailing 88-year-old mother. Needle stated, \\"There is a lot of terrible stuff going on if two people file separate lawsuits. It's a toxic situation over there. This is supposed to be Judge Judy, the voice of justice, and yet her own staff isn't treated well. What is she getting paid all that money for if her own staff is treated with such little decency?\\" Conspiracy/fraud allegations In March 2013, a lawsuit was filed against Sheindlin by Patrice Jones, the estranged wife of Douthit. Jones alleged Douthit and Sheindlin had conspired to permit Sheindlin to buy Christofle fine china and Marley cutlery owned by Jones. She said Sheindlin had paid Douthit $50,815 for the items without her knowledge to deprive her of her valuables, and she sought $514,421 from Sheindlin. The suit ended after Sheindlin returned the tableware to Douthit and Jones agreed to pay Douthit $12,500 and have the tableware handed back to her. Lawsuit by production against YouTube user On October 17, 2013, Big Ticket Television and producers of Judge Judy filed a lawsuit against Ignacio De Los Angeles. The suit was made against the individual for posting an episode of Judge Judy on YouTube. Ignacio ignored the command. Copyright lawsuit filed by Judge Judy Sheindlin On Wednesday, March 12, 2014, Sheindlin filed a lawsuit of her own for the first time in her life. The suit was filed against Hartford, Connecticut, personal injury lawyer John Haymond and his law firm. In the lawsuit, Sheindlin accused Haymond and his firm of using her television image without consent in advertisements that falsely suggested she endorsed him and his firm. In March 2013, Sheindlin's producer allegedly told the firm that the use of her image was not permitted, but ads continued. The lawsuit filed in federal court sought more than $75,000 in damages. Sheindlin said in her statement that any money she wins through the lawsuit will go toward college scholarships through the Her Honor Mentoring Program. Sheindlin described the unauthorized use of her name as \\"outrageous\\", stating, \\"Mr. Haymond is a lawyer and should know better.\\" Haymond later filed a countersuit for punitive damages and attorney's fees, alleging defamation of him and his firm by Sheindlin. Haymond insisted that local affiliates asked him to appear in Judge Judy promos to promote Sheindlin for which he obliged. On August 8, 2014, it was reported that the case between Sheindlin and Haymond settled out of court in a resolution that favored Sheindlin. Haymond will be donating money to Sheindlin's charity, Her Honor Mentoring Program. Lawsuit by Rebel Entertainment aimed at CBS Television Distribution and Judge Judy Sheindlin's salary On March 14, 2016, talent agency Rebel Entertainment and its president, Richard Lawrence, filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against CBS Television Distribution, claiming the media giant failed to pay the agency its contractually-agreed-to share of the show's profits, totalling millions of dollars. Rebel also claimed they were owed for their contributions to launching the program and discovering Sheindlin through their terminated employees Kaye Switzer and Sandi Spreckman. The lawsuit alleged that CBS hadn't paid Rebel for the past six years, claiming that the show operated at a loss, and alleging that this was primarily due to Sheindlin's annual salary boost to $45 and then $47 million. The lawsuit went on to attack Sheindlin's salary as being far too high. Rebel described it as \\"exorbitant\\" and \\"grossly inconsistent with customary practice in the television industry\\" and claims that similarly successful talk show hosts weren't paid nearly as much. Further, Rebel claimed they were entitled to be consulted before any spin-offs of the show were produced, but were not when Hot Bench (another courtroom-arbitrated show) was launched by Sheindlin and her producers in 2014. In response to the lawsuit, Sheindlin had stated: > The fact that Richard Lawrence is complaining about my salary is actually > hilarious. I met Mr. Lawrence for 2 hours some 21 years ago. Neither I nor > anyone involved in the day-to-day production of my program has heard from > him in 20 years. Not a card, not a gift, not a flower, not a > congratulations. Yet he has somehow received over $17,000,000 from my > program. My rudimentary math translates that into $8,500,000 an hour for Mr. > Lawrence. Not a bad payday. Now complaining about not getting enough money, > that's real chutzpah. When Sheindlin was deposed for the case in the summer of 2016, she said \\"CBS had no choice but to pay me what I wanted because otherwise I could take it wherever I wanted to take it or do it myself. Their back's to the wall. They pay me the money that they do because they have no choice. They can't find another one.\\" In an April 2018 verdict on this case, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Joanne O'Donnell found that Sheindlin was not grossly overpaid and that her salary did not constitute a breach of contract, rather her salary is a result of the \\"resounding success of her program and without its namesake star would not continue\\". That being said, Judge O'Donnell ruled partially in Rebel's favor, agreeing that it was a breach of contract for the defendants to have failed to consult Lawrence before launching \\"spin-off\\" series, Hot Bench. Dissatisfied with being granted one part of their motion while denied the other, Bryan Freedman (Lawrence's attorney) stated that the plaintiffs intended to appeal Judge O'Donnell's verdict. Freedman was quoted as stating, \\"As for admitting and then ignoring Rebel's uncontroverted expert opinion evidence that frontloading the 45 million dollar salary of Ms. Sheindlin was not consistent with the United States television industry, the court committed a reversible error. That issue will be decided by the court of appeal.\\" =Lawsuit by Kaye Switzer and trust of Sandi Spreckman against Judge Judy Sheindlin, CBS Television Distribution and Big Ticket Television= On January 19, 2018, a breach-of-contract lawsuit‚Äîsimilar and loosely related to the case filed by Rebel Entertainment‚Äîwas filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court against Sheindlin, CBS Corporation, CBS Studios and Big Ticket Television by Kaye Switzer and the trust of the now deceased Sandi Spreckman. Switzer and Spreckman are former employees of Rebel Entertainment, terminated by the employer. Switzer and Spreckman's trustee, Jay Robinson, claimed they \\"discovered\\" and introduced Sheindlin to producer Larry Little, asserting that if not for this move that there would be no Judge Judy and thus they are owed monetary royalties. The lawsuit also stated that Sheindlin sold \\"The Judge Judy Library\\" to CBS Television Distribution for over $95,000,000. Switzer and the Spreckman's trustee contend that they were not paid any monetary rewards by Sheindlin, CBS or Big Ticket related to this transaction. The two women have a long history of filing lawsuits over the same matter against Sheindlin and her Judge Judy business partners dating back to the year 2000. An insider claimed that Sheindlin was not concerned about the lawsuit, regards the subject of \\"who is owed what as just background noise\\", and believed that the success of her show came from nothing more than the \\"sweat of her brow\\" and the force of her personality. According to the same insider, Sheindlin said she \\"was always fond of Kaye and Sandi\\", they were fired before her show ever made it on the air, and that she \\"never entered a contract with Kaye and Sandi personally.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:1996 American television series debuts Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios Category:English-language television shows Category:1990s American reality television series Category:2000s American reality television series Category:2010s American reality television series Category:2020s American reality television series Category:1990s American legal television series Category:2000s American legal television series Category:2010s American legal television series Category:2020s American legal television series Category:Arbitration courts and tribunals Category:Court shows ","title":"Judge Judy"},{"id":"466692","text":"Peter Tapsell may refer to: *Peter Tapsell (British politician) (1930‚Äì2018), British Conservative Member of Parliament *Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician) (1930‚Äì2012), first MƒÅori Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives 1993‚Äì1996 ","title":"Peter Tapsell"},{"id":"466699","text":"cwt is the abbreviation for hundredweight (cwt = centum weight), an English, imperial, and US customary unit of weight CWT or cwt may also refer to: Enterprises and organizations * CWT (company), Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a travel management company * Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, the oldest law firm in New York City * Changing World Technologies, a privately held synthetic fuel company * Cheshire Wildlife Trust, an English trust * Colorado Water Trust, an American non-profit conservation organization * Cooperatives Working Together, an American organization that manages the Dairy Termination Program * Cornwall Wildlife Trust, an English charitable organisation * California Water Service Group, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CWT Other uses * cwt, ISO 639 code for the Kwatay language of Senegal * CWT, IATA code for Cowra Airport in New South Wales, Australia * Center wing fuel tank (CWT), a crucial airplane structure that contributed to the crash of TWA Flight 800 * Central Western Time, an Australian time zone * Chief Water Tender, a former paygrade for a watertender in the U.S. Navy * Coded wire tag, an animal tagging device * Complex wavelet transform, an extension to the standard discrete wavelet transform used in image processing * Constant weight, a freediving discipline * Constant with temperature, a term used in bandgap voltage reference * Continuous wavelet transform, a formal representation of a signal in mathematics ","title":"CWT"},{"id":"466702","text":"Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªç (10 July 1910 ‚Äì 24 December 1996) was a Vietnamese revolutionary and Chairman of Consultative Council of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam from 6 June 1969 to 2 July 1976, and the Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam from 4 July 1981 to 18 June 1987. Nguy·ªÖn H·ªØu Th·ªç began his political career in 1949, when he participated in leading positions in the protests against the French occupation of Indochina and the patrols of US warships off the coast of South Vietnam. Because of these activities he was arrested and served between 1950 and 1952 a prison sentence. During this time he gained a great reputation among the population because of his extended hunger strike against the Indochina war.Jacques Dalloz : Dictionnaire de la Guerre d'Indochine, Paris, 2006, S. 171 Christopher E.

After the partition of Vietnam into communist North Vietnam and pro-US South Vietnam in 1954, he remained in his South Vietnamese homeland and subsequently co-operated with the government of President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám until he was arrested again for attending nationwide elections to achieve reunification. With the exception of a brief break, he was between 1954 to his escape in 1961, mainly in prisons in South Vietnam. After his escape, he was first interim president and then chairman of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam, which was co-founded by him on December 20, 1960 (M·∫∑t Tr·∫≠n Gi·∫£i Ph√≥ng Mi·ªÅn Nam Vi·ªát Nam,). With this liberation movement he carried out successful protests against the government of South Vietnam. During the Vietnam War, the NLF founded the Provisional Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam in June 1969, in which Hu·ª≥nh T·∫•n Ph√°t became President and he himself became Chairman of the Consultative Council. After the conquest of Saigon by a unit of the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong in April 1975, he became Prime Minister of South Vietnam. After the reunification and the founding of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam on 2 July 1976, he was one of two vice- presidents and thus deputy of T√¥n ƒê·ª©c Th·∫Øng. At the same time he was the first mayor of Ho Chi Minh City. After T√¥n ƒê·ª©c Th·∫Øng's death on 30 March 1980, he became acting President of Vietnam and held that post until his replacement by Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh on 4 July 1981. He then served as Deputy Chairman of the Council of State from 1981 to 1992, Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh and V√µ Ch√≠ C√¥ng. At the same time he was from 1981 to 1987 Chairman of the National Assembly (Qu·ªëc h·ªôi Vi·ªát Nam) and thus Parliament President. Most recently, between 1988 and 1994, he was chairman of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front (M·∫∑t tr·∫≠n T·ªï qu·ªëc Vi·ªát Nam), the umbrella organization for mass organizations in the country. Life and career A French-educated lawyer in Cochinchina, Th·ªç was also a member of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) and a participant in the Vietnamese fight for independence. He joined the Vietnamese National Popular League (or Li√™n Vi·ªát) in 1948, Communist Party in 1949, and was kept in detention from 1950‚Äì52. He later came to support the 1954 Geneva agreements, but opposed the government of South Vietnam's president, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám. In August 1954, he founded the Committee in Defense of Peace and the Geneva Agreements.

It is thought to have originated in south-central Europe from dogs of spitz type. Despite the name, it has no verified historic or scientific connection to the island of Malta.  History  The Maltese had been recognized as an FCI breed under the patronage of Italy in 1954, at the annual meeting in Interlaken, Switzerland. The current FCI standard is dated November 27, 1989, and the latest translation from Italian to English is dated April 6, 1998. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1888, its latest standard being from March 10, 1964. Parti-colour and solid colour dogs were accepted in the show ring from 1902 until 1913 in England,Foxstone Maltese - Maltese Breed History by Sharon Pearson, Eads, Colorado, member of the American Maltese Association, retrieved 2009-04-14 and as late as 1950 in Victoria, Australia.'The Maltese of the Past' by Trudy Dalziel - Snowsheen Maltese (Maltese Kennel Club of Victoria, Australia) at maltese.com.au, retrieved 2009-04-14 However, white Maltese were required to be pure white. Coloured Maltese could be obtained from the south of France. Little is known about the origin and spread of the Maltese dog. It probably did not originate from the island of Malta, the town of Melita in Italy, nor the island of Melita in the Adriatic, but from spitz- type dogs in south-central Europe, where it may at first have resembled the modern Pomeranian. Melitaie The Maltese dog was a lapdog favoured by both the ancient Greeks and Romans, especially their children, and appears on amphorae with the word ŒúŒµŒªŒπœÑŒ±ŒπŒµ (Melitaie). References to the dog can also be found in Ancient Greek and Roman literature. Aristotle mentions the dog around 370 BC. Early writers attribute its origin to Melita, however there were two islands named Melita at that time with one being in the Mediterranean and the other being in the Adriatic sea near Dalmatia, which confuses where the dog originated from. Strabo wrote about the Canes Melitei that came not from Malta but from a town named Melita in Sicily, which is in contrast to English writers who give Malta, as the place of origin, considering that Melite is also the old name of Mdina, former capital of Malta. Pliny suggests the dog as having taken its name from the Adriatic island M√©l√©da, however Strabo, in the early first century AD, identifies the breed as originating from the Mediterranean island of Malta.Jean Quintin d'Autun Insulae Melitae Descriptio, 1536, vii, \\"Huic insulae Strabo nobiles illos, adagio, non minus quam medicinis...\\" During the first century, the Roman poet Martial wrote descriptive verses to a lap dog named \\"Issa\\" owned by his friend Publius. Note:refers to a \\"lap dog\\" It is proposed that Issa was a Maltese dog, and various sources link Martial's friend Publius with the Roman Governor Publius of Malta, though others do not identify him. John Caius, physician to Queen Elizabeth I, also claimed that Callimachus was referring to the island of Melita \\"in the Sicilian strait\\" (Malta). This claim is often repeated, especially by English writers. The dog's links to Malta are mentioned in the writings of Abb√© Jean Quintin, Secretary to the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam, in his work Insulae Melitae Descriptio.Jean Quintin d'Autun Insulae Melitae Descriptio (1536).  Description  Long-haired Maltese groomed for conformation show  Appearance  Characteristics include slightly rounded skulls, with a finger- wide dome, a black button nose and brown eyes. The body is compact with the length equaling the height and the tail is almost always curled. The drop ears with (sometimes) long hair, and eyes surrounded by darker skin pigmentation (called a \\"halo\\"), gives Maltese their expressive look. Lacking exposure to a lot of sunlight, their noses can fade and become pink or light brown in color. This is often referred to as a \\"winter nose\\" and many times will become black again with increased exposure to the sun. The Maltese's paws are very sensitive to touch.The Maltese Dog - Complete Anthology of the Dog. King Lear chapter (further down after opening link). Maltese showing tear staining The coat is long and silky and lacks an undercoat. Some Maltese can have curly hair (especially behind their ears), but this is considered a fault.The coat is single, that is, without undercoat. It hangs long, flat, and silky over the sides of the body almost, if not quite, to the ground. The long head-hair may be tied up in a topknot or it may be left hanging. Any suggestion of kinkiness, curliness, or woolly texture is objectionable. Maltese are a pure white, yet sometimes dull gold fur will grow behind their ears and on their back. Light lemon on the ears is permissible, but not desirable. The colour of the coat is pure white. A pale ivory tinge is permitted on the ears. In some standards, a pure white coat with slight lemon markings is tolerated. The Maltese does not shed, and is therefore a good choice for people with dog allergies.The Dog Selector, David Alderton, 2010, pg 59, . They can exhibit signs of tear-staining. Tear stains can be caused by health issues, blocked tear-ducts, or allergies. They can be removed through tear stain wipes, soft chews, and formula that can be placed in their food or water. Tear staining happens on other breeds as well, but it is more prevalent in the Maltese breed because their coat is white. Some people prefer their dogs to have the coat short, clipped to a few centimetres in length. Adult Maltese range from roughly . The international FCI standard specifies a weight of ; the American Kennel Club calls for a somewhat lighter weight of , with preferred, They are usually tall.  Uses  The Maltese is kept for companionship, for ornament or for showing. It is ranked 59th of 79 breeds assessed for intelligence by Stanley Coren.

Use A weight restriction sign on Alderney using hundredweight The short hundredweight is commonly used in the US in the sale of livestock and some cereal grains and oilseeds, paper, and concrete additives and on some commodities in futures exchanges. A few decades ago, commodities weighed in terms of long hundredweight included cattle, cattle fodder, fertilizers, coal, some industrial chemicals, other industrial materials, and so on. However, since increasing metrication in most English-speaking countries, it is now less used. Church bell ringers use the unit commonly, although church bell manufacturers are increasingly moving over to the metric system. Older blacksmiths' anvils are often stamped with a three-digit number indicating their total weight in hundredweight, quarter-hundredweight (28 lb, abbreviated qr), and pounds. Thus, an anvil stamped \\"1.1.8\\" will weigh 148 lb (112 lb + 28 lb + 8 lb).

He serves as Reish Metivta of the Union for Traditional Judaism's rabbinical school. Biography David Weiss was born in the small town of Kobyletska Poliana (–ö–æ–±–∏–ª–µ—Ü—å–∫–∞ –ü–æ–ª—è–Ω–∞, Poiana Cobilei, Gergyanliget) in Carpathian Ruthenia, then in Czechoslovakia (now in Rakhiv Raion, in Ukraine). His parents separated when he was 4 years old, and he grew up in the home of his grandfather, a Talmudic scholar in Sighet, Romania. His grandfather began teaching him at age five, and he was regarded as an Illui ; he received semikha (Rabbinic ordination) at age 15. See the Hebrew Wikipedia article :he:◊ì◊ï◊ì ◊î◊ú◊ë◊†◊ô During the Holocaust, at the age of 16 he was deported to Auschwitz. After a week he was transferred to a forced labor camp, Gross- Rosen, then to AL Wolfsberg, and later to Mauthausen concentration camp and was the only member of his family to survive. When he arrived in the United States at the age of 18, he was placed in a Jewish orphanage where he created a stir by challenging the kashrut of the institution since the supervising rabbi did not have a beard and, more importantly, was not fluent in the commentaries of the Pri Megadim by Rabbi Yoseph Te'omim. This was a standard for Rabbis in Europe. A social worker introduced him to Saul Lieberman, a leading Talmudist at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) in New York, who recognized his brilliance and took him under his wing. Weiss later studied with Lieberman for many years at the JTS. Initially, he studied in Yeshiva Chaim Berlin under Yitzchak Hutner and was allowed to not attend lectures because of his advanced standing. Over the next decade, he completed high school and then earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Brooklyn College, and a Master's Degree in philosophy from NYU; he wrote his Doctorate in Talmud at JTS. He married Zipporah Hager, a descendant of the Vizhnitzer Rebbes. They had 3 children: Baruch (formally known as Bernard), Ephraim, and Yeshiahu. He has six grandchildren, all of whom are scholars as well; Avidan, Hadar, Daniel, Rebecca, Benjamin (Jamin), and Eliana. Weiss later changed his name to \\"Halivni,\\" a Hebrew translation for \\"weiss\\" or \\"white.\\" He originally wanted to abandon the surname Weiss because that was the name of a guard in the concentration camp in which he was interned. He was initially considering changing his name to Halivni; however, out of respect for this grandfather/teacher Yeshayahu Weiss, he maintained a memory of the family name, using the compound name Weiss Halivni. Halivni served as Littauer Professor of Talmud and Classical Rabbinics in the Department of Religion at Columbia University. In July 2005, he retired from Columbia University. He now lives in Israel and teaches at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Bar Ilan University. Impact Halivni's source-critical approach to Talmud study has had a major impact on academic understanding and study of the Talmud.Encyclopaedia Judaica 2nd ed. entry \\"Talmud, Babylonian\\" The traditional understanding viewed the Talmud as a unified homogeneous work. While other scholars had also treated the Talmud as a multi-layered work, Halivni's innovation (primarily in the second volume of his Mekorot u-Mesorot) was to distinguish between the onymous statements, which are generally succinct Halachic rulings or inquiries attributed to known Amoraim, and the anonymous statements, characterised by a much longer analysis often consisting of lengthy dialectic discussion, which he attributed to the later authors- \\"Stamma'im\\" (or Savora'im). It has been noted that indeed the Jerusalem Talmud is very similar to the Babylonian Talmud, minus Stammaitic activity, which is to be found only in the latter.Encyclopaedia Judaica (2nd ed.), entry \\"Jerusalem Talmud\\" Controversy=Source-critical analysis His methodology of source-critical analysis of the Talmud is controversial among most Orthodox Jews, but is accepted in the non-Orthodox Jewish community, and by some within Modern Orthodoxy. Halivni terms the anonymous texts of the Talmud as having been said by Stammaim (based on the phrase \\"stama d'talmuda\\" which refers to the anonymous material in the Gemara), who lived after the period of the Amoraim, but before the Geonic period. He posits that these Stammaim were the recipients of terse Tannaitic and Amoraic statements and that they endeavored to fill in the reasoning and argumentative background to such apodictic statements. The methodology employed in his commentary Mekorot u' Mesorot attempts to give Halivni's analysis of the correct import and context and demonstrates how the Talmudic Stammaim often erred in their understanding of the original context. Chate'u Israel In Halivni's books Peshat and Derash and Revelation Restored, he attempts to harmonize biblical criticism with traditional religious belief using a concept he developed termed Chate'u Israel (literally, \\"Israel has sinned\\"). This concept states that the biblical texts originally given to Moses have become irretrievably corrupted. Revelation Restored writes as follows: > According to the biblical account itself, the people of Israel forsook the > Torah, in the dramatic episode of the golden calf, only forty days after the > revelation at Sinai. From that point on, until the time of Ezra, the > scriptures reveal that the people of Israel were steeped in idolatry and > negligent of the Mosaic law. Chate'u Yisrael, states that in the period of > neglect and syncretism after the conquest of Canaan when the originally > monotheistic Israelites adopted pagan practices from their neighbours, the > Torah of Moses became \\"blemished and maculated\\". According to Halivni, this process continued until the time of Ezra (c.450 BCE), when finally, upon their return from Babylon, the people accepted the Torah. It was at that time that the previously rejected, and therefore maculated, text of the Torah was recompiled and edited by Ezra and his \\"entourage.\\" He claims that this is attested in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, and Halivni supports his theory with Talmudic and Midrashic sources which indicate that Ezra played a role in editing the Torah. He further states that while the text of the Pentateuch was corrupted, oral tradition preserved intact many of the laws, which is why the Oral Law appears to contradict the Biblical text in certain details. This view was seen as possibly being in contradiction to the 8th of Maimonides' 13 principles of faith, which states \\"the Torah that we have today is the one that was dictated to Moses by God\\". Some believe that Maimonides says that this applies to every single word in the Torah. As a result, Halivni's assertions were rejected by some Orthodox rabbis.Yated Ne'eman, January 14th, 1999 As a spiritual leader Halivni was involved in the 1983 controversy at JTS surrounding the training and ordination of women as rabbis. He felt that there may be halakhic methods for ordaining women as rabbis, but that more time was needed before such could be legitimately instituted, and that the decision had been made as a policy decision by the governing body of the Seminary rather than as a psak halachah within the traditional rabbinic legal process. This disagreement led to his break with the seminary and with the movement of Conservative Judaism, and to his co-founding of the Union for Traditional Judaism. Until 2005, Halivni was the spiritual leader of Kehilat Orach Eliezer (KOE), a congregation on Manhattan's Upper West Side, a position he had held since the congregation's foundation in 1992. In 2002, many members of the congregation wanted to allow women to be called up to the Torah, which, while supported by a then-recent legal argument by Rabbi Mendel Shapiro, is opposed by many rabbis for halakhic and sociological reasons. Halivni was not excited about the practice, and told the congregation: \\"I shall allow it, but only if it is done no more frequently than a few times a year, and only if it is done in a separate room from the 'real' service.\\" Thus, the congregation allows this practice only under very limited circumstances. Nevertheless, even this \\"compromise\\" was far too liberal for many congregants. On the other side, many liberals favored a Partnership minyan approach and were frustrated by KOE's failure to include women in the main Torah service. Awards * In 1985, Halivni was a co- recipient (jointly with Hillel Barzel and Shlomo Pines) of the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought. *In 1997, he won awarded the National Jewish Book Award in Scholarship for Revelation Restored: Divine Writ and Critical Responses * In 2008, he was awarded the Israel Prize for his Talmudic work. Published works Halivni's published works include: *Mekorot u'Mesorot (Hebrew), a projected ten volume commentary on the Talmud. *Peshat and Derash *Revelation Restored *The Book and the Sword, his memoirs. *Breaking the Tablets: Jewish Theology After the Shoah, a collection of essays on Holocaust theology. The central thesis of \\"Breaking the Tablets\\" is that the history of the Jews is \\"bookmarked\\" by two diametrically opposing \\"revelations\\": Sinai and Auschwitz. The revelation on Mount Sinai was the apex of God's nearness to the Jews, while the revelation at Auschwitz was the nadir of God's absence from them. Halivni's conviction is that Auschwitz represents not merely God's \\"hiding his face\\" from Israel, as a consequence of the Jews' sins ‚Äî a familiar trope in rabbinic theology ‚Äî but also his actual, ontological withdrawal from human history. In Breaking the Tablets Halivni explicitly rejected the notion that this withdrawal is simply an example of \\"God hiding his face\\" as viewed in normative Judaism. The concept of hester panim (God's hiding his face) is classically used with regard to punishment, and Halivni is adamant that the Holocaust cannot in any way be regarded as a punishment for Israel's sins.

No. 43-52436, is a prototype heavy cargo aircraft built by Convair for the United States Air Force. It was the largest piston-engined land-based transport aircraft ever built, and was developed from the Convair B-36 Peacemaker bomber, sharing the wings and some other structures with it. The first flight was on 24 November 1947 in San Diego, California, and after testing it was delivered to the Air Force on 26 May 1949.Jacobsen & Wagner 1980, p. 41. The Convair Model 37 was a planned civil passenger variant based on the XC-99 but was not built. Design and development Design capacity of the XC-99 was of cargo or 400 fully equipped soldiers on its double cargo decks. A cargo lift was installed for easier loading. The engines face rearward in a pusher configuration. Planned civil passenger variant The Convair Model 37 was a large civil passenger design derived from the XC-99 but was never built. The Model 37 was to be of similar proportions to the XC-99; length, wingspan, and a high-capacity, double-deck fuselage. The projected passenger load was to be 204, and the effective range of . Fifteen aircraft were ordered by Pan American Airways for transatlantic service. However, the fuel and oil consumption of the six Wasp Major radials powering the XC-99 and B-36 meant that the design was not economically viable, and the hoped-for turboprop powerplants did not materialize fast enough. The low number of orders were not sufficient to initiate production, and the project was abandoned. Operational history The XC-99 in flight with a B-36B In July 1950, the XC-99 flew its first cargo mission, \\"Operation Elephant.\\" It transported of cargo, including engines and propellers for the B-36, from San Diego to Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, a record it would later break when it lifted from an airfield at elevation. In August 1953, the XC-99 would make its longest flight, , to Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany, by way of Kindley Air Force Base, Bermuda and Lajes Field in the Azores. It carried more than each way. It attracted much attention everywhere it flew. The XC-99 landing during flight test trial The US Air Force determined that it had no need for such a large, long-range transport at that time, and no more were ordered. The sole XC-99 served until 1957, including much use during the Korean War. It made twice weekly trips from Kelly AFB to the aircraft depot at McClellan Air Force Base, California, transporting supplies and parts for the B-36 bomber while returning by way of other bases or depots making pick-ups and deliveries along the way. During its operational life, the XC-99 logged over 7,400 hours total time, and transported more than 60 million pounds (27,000 metric tons) of cargo. The aircraft made its last flight on 19 March 1957, landing at Kelly Air Force Base, where it would remain for the next 47 years. The then-United States Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, requested that the aircraft be flown there for display, but the Air Force refused due to the $7,400 cost of the flight.

Sakai is known for its keyhole-shaped burial mounds, or kofun, which date from the 5th century. The largest of these, Daisen Kofun, is believed to be the grave of the Emperor Nintoku and is the largest grave in the world by area. Once known for samurai swords, Sakai is now famous for the quality of its kitchen knives; most high-quality Japanese cutlery originates in Sakai, and its production is a major industry in the city. History The area that would later become known as Sakai has been inhabited since approximately 8,000 BC.http://www.sakai-tcb.or.jp/english/about_sakai/ During the Yamato dynasty between 300 and 500 AD, the Mozu Tumulus Cluster was built from over one hundred burial mounds. The name \\"Sakai\\" appears in Fujiwara Sadoyori's poetry by 1045. Tradition holds that 10,000 homes burned to the ground in 1399.http://www.city.sakai.lg.jp/english/visitors/whats/history.html Medieval Sakai was an autonomous city run by merchant citizens. During the Muromachi and Sengoku periods from about 1450 to 1600, Sakai became one of richest cities in Japan by using its location at the mouth of the Yamato River to connect foreign trade with inland trade to the Yamato Province. It was a leading producer of textiles and ironwork.The Oxford Handbook of Cities in World History edited by Peter Clark https://books.google.com/books?id=z09oAgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA331&lpg;=PA331&dq;=Gaspar+Vilela+sakai+consuls In those days, it was said that the richest cities were Umi no Sakai, Riku no Imai (tr. \\"along the sea, Sakai; inlands, Imai\\"; the latter is now a part of Kashihara, Nara). The famous Zen Buddhist priest Ikky≈´ chose to live in Sakai because of its free atmosphere. The first reliable account of the city is dated to the 1480s and contains publicly issued legal notices, which suggests that the city had a governing council at that point. By the 1530s, the population was around 40,000 residents, almost all of which earned a living through commercial enterprises and some of which were the wealthiest people in Japan. At this time, Sakai was administered by an oligarchy of powerful merchants. The government had ten divisions machi that were subordinate to the representative council of wealthy townsmen known as the egoshu.An Introduction to the History of Japan by Katsuro Hara https://books.google.com/books?id=k-lBAAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA241&lpg;=PA241&dq;=sakai+japan+autonomous+merchant Sen no Riky≈´, known as the greatest master of the tea ceremony, was originally a merchant of Sakai. Because of the close relationship between the tea ceremony and Zen Buddhism and because of the prosperity of its citizens, Sakai was one of the main centers of the tea ceremony in Japan. In the Sengoku period, some Christian priests, including Francis Xavier in 1550, visited Sakai and documented its prosperity. Gaspar Vilela described the town as the safest place in the area when he visited in 1561.http://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2015/04/11/travel/sakai-keyhole-history- osaka/#.Vr2JV_krJjU He also mentioned that the city was \\"governed by consuls like Venice in Italy\\", although he didn't elaborate on what he meant by \\"like consuls\\". After the coming of Europeans, Sakai became a manufacturing base of firearms and a daimy≈ç, Oda Nobunaga, was one of their important customers. During his ambitious attempt to unify Japan, Nobunaga attempted to take the autonomy privilege from Sakai. Sakai's citizens denied his order and pitched a desperate battle against his army. Most citizens fled and Sakai was burned and seized by Nobunaga. After the death of Nobunaga in 1582, one of his men, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, seized power and abolished the autonomous system of Sakai and reportedly forced the local merchants to move to central Osaka near his stronghold to weaken the powerful business community there.http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2013-09/19/c_132733667.htm Sakai became a prosperous city again under his reign. In 1615, Sakai burned to the ground in the Osaka summer battle. Sakai was still an important trade center during the Edo period but was involved only in inland trade due to the sakoku policy of the Tokugawa government. At the end of this era, Westerners again landed in Sakai but it resulted in a tragic incident because the Japanese citizenry and the foreigners were ignorant of each other's ways. French sailors from the Dupleix and Sakai citizens clashed; some French were killed, and subsequently the Japanese responsible for these deaths were sentenced to death by seppuku. This incident is called the . In modern times, Sakai is an industrial city with a large port. As such, its western area suffered widespread damage from bombing raids during the Second World War. It is now known for its knives and is the home of Shimano bicycle parts. With a population of over 800,000, it is the largest suburb of Osaka City and the fourteenth-largest city in Japan.

It is a human pathogen that causes the disease mycoplasma pneumonia, a form of atypical bacterial pneumonia related to cold agglutinin disease. M. pneumoniae is characterized by the absence of a peptidoglycan cell wall and resulting resistance to many antibacterial agents. The persistence of M. pneumoniae infections even after treatment is associated with its ability to mimic host cell surface composition. Discovery and history In 1898, Nocard and Roux were the first to isolate an agent assumed to be the cause of cattle pneumonia and named it \\"microbe de la peripneumonie\\" Microorganisms from other sources, having properties similar to the pleuropneumonia organism of cattle (PPO), soon came to be known as pleuropneumonia-like organisms (PPLO), but their true nature was unknown. Many PPLO were later proven to be the cause of pneumonias and arthritis in several lower animals. In 1944, Monroe Eaton used embryonated chicken eggs to cultivate an agent thought to be the cause of human Primary Atypical Pneumonia (PAP), commonly known as ‚ÄúWalking Pneumonia‚Äù. This unknown organism became known as the \\"Eaton agent\\". At that time, Eaton‚Äôs use of embryonated eggs, then used for cultivating viruses, supported the idea that the Eaton Agent was a virus. Yet, it was known that PAP was amenable to treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics making a viral etiology suspect because viruses are unaffected by antibiotics. Robert Chanock, an Eaton Agent virus researcher from the NIH, visited the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia in 1961 to obtain a cell culture of a normal human cell strain developed by Leonard Hayflick. This cell strain was known to be exquisitely sensitive to isolate and grow human viruses. Chanock told Hayflick of his research on the Eaton Agent and his belief that its virus nature was questionable. Although Hayflick knew little about the current research on this agent, his Ph.D. dissertation was done on animal diseases caused by PPLO. Hayflick knew that many lower animals suffered from pneumonias caused by PPLOs (later to be named Mycoplasmas). Hayflick reasoned that the Eaton Agent might be a mycoplasma and not a virus. Chanock never heard of mycoplasmas, and at Hayflick‚Äôs request sent him egg yolk containing the Eaton Agent. Using a novel agar and fluid medium formulation which he devised, Hayflick isolated a unique mycoplasma from the egg yolk. This was soon proven by Chanock and Hayflick to be the causative agent of PAP. When this discovery became known to the world‚Äôs leading authority on these organisms, Dr. Emmy Klieneberger-Nobel of the Lister Institute in London, she suggested that the organism be named Mycoplasma hayflickiae. Hayflick demurred in favor of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This smallest free-living microorganism was the first to be isolated and proven to be the cause of a human disease. For his discovery, Hayflick was presented with the Presidential Award by the International Organization of Mycoplasmology. The inverted microscope under which Hayflick discovered Mycoplasma pneumoniae has been accessioned by the Smithsonian Institution. Taxonomy and classification The term mycoplasma ( meaning fungus, and , meaning formed) is derived from the fungal-like growth of some mycoplasma species. The mycoplasmas were classified as Mollicutes (‚Äúmollis‚Äù, meaning soft and ‚Äúcutis‚Äù, meaning skin) in 1960 due to their small size and genome, lack of cell wall, low G+C content and unusual nutritional needs. M. pneumoniae has also been designated as an arginine nonfermenting species. Mycoplasmas are further classified by the sequence composition of 16s rRNA. All mycoplasmas of the pneumoniae group possess similar 16s rRNA variations unique to the group, of which M. pneumoniae has a 6.3% variation in the conserved regions, that suggest mycoplasmas formed by degenerative evolution from the gram-positive eubacterial group that includes bacilli, streptococci, and lactobacilli. M. pneumoniae is a member of the family Mycoplasmataceae and order Mycoplasmatales. Cell biology A) Filamentous Mycoplasma pneumoniae cells B) M. pneumoniae cells (M) attached to ciliated mucosal cells by the attachment organelle (indicated by arrow) Mycoplasmas, which are among the smallest self-replicating organisms, are parasitic species that lack a cell wall and periplasmic space, have reduced genomes, and limited metabolic activity. Mycoplasma pneumoniae cells have an elongated shape that is approximately 0.1‚Äì0.2 ¬µm (100-200 nm) in width and 1-2 ¬µm (1000-2000 nm) in length. The extremely small cell size means they are incapable of being examined by light microscopy; a stereomicroscope is required for viewing the morphology of M. pneumoniae colonies, which are usually less than 100 ¬µm in length. The inability to synthesize a peptidoglycan cell wall is due to the absence of genes encoding its formation and results in an increased importance in maintenance of osmotic stability to avoid desiccation. The lack of a cell wall also calls for increased support of the cell membrane(reinforced with sterols), which includes a rigid cytoskeleton composed of an intricate protein network and, potentially, an extracellular capsule to facilitate adherence to the host cell. M. pneumoniae are the only bacterial cells that possess cholesterol in their cell membrane (obtained from the host) and possess more genes that encode for membrane lipoprotein variations than other mycoplasmas, which are thought to be associated with its parasitic lifestyle. M. pneumoniae cells also possess an attachment organelle, which is used in the gliding motility of the organism by an unknown mechanism.  Genomics and metabolic reconstruction  Sequencing of the M. pneumoniae genome in 1996 revealed it is 816,394 bp in size. The genome contains 687 genes that encode for proteins, of which about 56.6% code for essential metabolic enzymes; notably those involved in glycolysis and organic acid fermentation. M. pneumoniae is consequently very susceptible to loss of enzymatic function by gene mutations, as the only buffering systems against functional loss by point mutations are for maintenance of the pentose phosphate pathway and nucleotide metabolism. Loss of function in other pathways is suggested to be compensated by host cell metabolism. In addition to the potential for loss of pathway function, the reduced genome of M. pneumoniae outright lacks a number of pathways, including the TCA cycle, respiratory electron transport chain, and biosynthesis pathways for amino acids, fatty acids, cholesterol and purines and pyrimidines. These limitations make M. pneumoniae dependent upon import systems to acquire essential building blocks from their host or the environment that cannot be obtained through glycolytic pathways. Along with energy costly protein and RNA production, a large portion of energy metabolism is exerted to maintain proton gradients (up to 80%) due to the high surface area to volume ratio of M. pneumoniae cells. Only 12 ‚Äì 29% of energy metabolism is directed at cell growth, which is unusually low for bacterial cells, and is thought to be an adaptation of its parasitic lifestyle. Unlike other bacteria, M. pneumoniae uses the codon UGA to code for tryptophan rather than using it as a stop codon. Host and reproduction Mycoplasma pneumoniae grows exclusively by parasitizing mammals. Reproduction, therefore, is dependent upon attachment to a host cell. According to Waite and Talkington, specialized reproduction occurs by ‚Äúbinary fission, temporally linked with duplication of its attachment organelle, which migrates to the opposite pole of the cell during replication and before nucleoid separation‚Äù. Mutations that affect the formation of the attachment organelle not only hinder motility and cell division, but also reduce the ability of M. pneumoniae cells to adhere to the host cell. Pathogenicity Pathogenicity of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in vasculitic/thrombotic disorders Mycoplasma pneumoniae parasitizes the respiratory tract epithelium of humans. Adherence to the respiratory epithelial cells is thought to occur via the attachment organelle, followed by evasion of host immune system by intracellular localization and adjustment of the cell membrane composition to mimic the host cell membrane. Cytoadherence Adherence of M. pneumoniae to a host cell (usually a respiratory tract cell, but occasionally an erythrocyte or urogenital lining cell) is the initiating event for pneumonic disease and related symptoms. The specialized attachment organelle is a polar, electron dense and elongated cell extension that facilitates motility and adherence to host cells. It is composed of a central filament surrounded by an intracytoplasmic space, along with a number of adhesins and structural and accessory proteins localized at the tip of the organelle. A variety of proteins are known to contribute to the formation and functionality of the attachment organelle, including the accessory proteins HMW1‚ÄìHMW5, P30, P56, and P90 that confer structure and adhesin support, and P1, P30 and P116 which are involved directly in attachment. This network of proteins participates not only in the initiation of attachment organelle formation and adhesion but also in motility. The P1 adhesin (trypsin-sensitive protein) is a 120 kDa protein highly clustered on the surface of the attachment organelle tip in virulent mycoplasmas. Both the presence of P1 and its concentration on the cell surface are required for the attachment of M. pneumoniae to the host cell. M. pneumoniae cells treated with monoclonal antibodies specific to the immunogenic C-terminus of the P1 adhesin have been shown to be inhibited in their ability to attach to the host cell surface by approximately 75%, suggesting P1 is a major component in adherence. These antibodies also decreased the ability of the cell to glide quickly, which may contribute to decreased adherence to the host by hindering their capacity to locate a host cell. Furthermore, mutations in P1 or degradation by trypsin treatment yield avirulent M. pneumoniae cells. Loss of proteins in the cytoskeleton involved in the localization of P1 in the tip structure, such as HMW1‚ÄìHMW3, also cause avirulence due to the lack of adhesin clustering. Another protein considered to play an important role in adherence is P30, as M. pneumoniae cells with mutations in this protein or that have had antibodies raised against P30 are incapable of adhering to host cells. P30 is not involved in the localization of P1 in the tip structure since P1 is trafficked to the attachment organelle in P30 mutants, but rather it may function as a receptor-binding accessory adhesin. P30 mutants also display distinct morphological features such as multiple lobes and a rounded shape as opposed to elongated, which suggests P30 may interact with the cytoskeleton during formation of the attachment organelle. A number of eukaryotic cell surface components have been implicated in the adherence of M. pneumoniae cells to the respiratory tract epithelium. Among them are sialoglycoconjugates, sulfated glycolipids, glycoproteins, fibronectin, and neuraminic acid receptors. Lectins on the surface of the bacterial cells are capable of binding oligosaccharide chains on glycolipids and glycoproteins to facilitate attachment, in addition to the proteins TU and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 Œ≤, which bind to fibronectin. Schematic of the phosphorylated proteins in the attachment organelle of Mycoplasma pneumoniae Intracellular localization Mycoplasma pneumoniae is known to evade host immune system detection, resist antibiotic treatment, and cross mucosal barriers, which may be due to its ability to fuse with host cells and survive intracellularly. In addition to the close physical proximity of M. pneumoniae and host cells, the lack of cell wall and peculiar cell membrane components, like cholesterol, may facilitate fusion (1). Internal localization may produce chronic or latent infections as M. pneumoniae is capable of persisting, synthesizing DNA, and replicating within the host cell even after treatment with antibiotics. The exact mechanism of intracellular localization is unknown, however the potential for cytoplasmic sequestration within the host explains the difficulty in completely eliminating M. pneumoniae infections in afflicted individuals. Immune response In addition to evasion of host immune system by intracellular localization, M. pneumoniae can change the composition of its cell membrane to mimic the host cell membrane and avoid detection by immune system cells. M. pneumoniae cells possess a number of protein and glycolipid antigens that elicit immune responses, but variation of these surface antigens would allow the infection to persist long enough for M. pneumoniae cells to fuse with host cells and escape detection. The similarity between the compositions of M. pneumoniae and human cell membranes can also result in autoimmune responses in several organs and tissues. Cytotoxicity and organismal effects The main cytotoxic effect of M. pneumoniae is local disruption of tissue and cell structure along the respiratory tract epithelium due to its close proximity to host cells. Attachment of the bacteria to host cells can result in loss of cilia, a reduction in metabolism, biosynthesis, and import of macromolecules, and, eventually, infected cells may be shed from the epithelial lining. M. pneumoniae produces a unique virulence factor known as Community Acquired Respiratory Distress Syndrome (CARDS) toxin. The CARDS toxin most likely aids in the colonization and pathogenic pathways of M. pneumoniae, leading to inflammation and airway dysfunction. In addition, the formation of hydrogen peroxide is a key virulence factor in M. pneumoniae infections. Attachment of M. pneumoniae to erythrocytes permits diffusion of hydrogen peroxide from the bacteria to the host cell without detoxification by catalase or peroxidase, which can injure the host cell by reducing glutathione, damaging lipid membranes and causing protein denaturation. Local damage may also be a result of lactoferrin acquisition and subsequent hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion and peroxide formation. The cytotoxic effects of M. pneumoniae infections translate into common symptoms like coughing and lung irritation that may persist for months after infection has subsided. Local inflammation and hyperresponsiveness by infection induced cytokine production has been associated with chronic conditions such as bronchial asthma and has also been linked to progression of symptoms in individuals with cystic fibrosis and COPD. Epidemiology The incidence of disease does not appear to be related to season or geography; however, infection tends to occur more frequently during the summer and fall months when other respiratory pathogens are less prevalent. Reinfection and epidemic cycling is thought to be a result of P1 adhesin subtype variation. Approximately 40% of community-acquired pneumonia is due to M. pneumoniae infections, with children and elderly individuals being most susceptible, however no personal risk factors for acquiring M. pneumoniae induced pneumonia have been determined. Transmission of M. pneumoniae can only occur through close contact and exchange of aerosols by coughing due to the increased susceptibility of the cell wall-lacking organism to desiccation. Outbreaks of M. pneumoniae infections tend to occur within groups of people in close and prolonged proximity, including schools, institutions, military bases, and households. Symptoms of infection M. pneumoniae is known to cause a host of symptoms such as primary atypical pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, and upper respiratory tract disease. Primary atypical pneumonia is one of the most severe types of manifestation, with tracheobronchitis being the most common symptom and another 15% of cases, usually adults, remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic infections tend to develop over a period of several days and manifestation of pneumonia can be confused with a number of other bacterial pathogens and conditions that cause pneumonia. Tracheobronchitis is most common in children due to a reduced immune system capacity, and up to 18% of infected children require hospitalization. Common mild symptoms include sore throat, wheezing and coughing, fever, headache, rhinitis, myalgia and feelings of unease, in which symptom intensity and duration can be limited by early treatment with antibiotics. Rarely, M. pneumoniae pneumonia results in death due to lesions and ulceration of the epithelial lining, pulmonary edema, and bronchiolitis obliterans. Extrapulmonary symptoms such as autoimmune responses, central nervous system complications, and dermatological disorders have been associated with M. pneumoniae infections in up to 25% of cases. Diagnosis Diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections is complicated by the delayed onset of symptoms and the similarity of symptoms to other pulmonary conditions. Often, M. pneumoniae infections are diagnosed as other conditions and, occasionally, non-pathogenic mycoplasmas present in the respiratory tract are mistaken for M. pneumoniae. Historically, diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infections was made based on the presence of cold agglutinins and the ability of the infected material to reduce tetrazolium. Causative diagnosis is dependent upon laboratory testing, however these methods are more practical in epidemiological studies than in patient diagnosis. Culture tests are rarely used as diagnostic tools; rather immunoblotting, immunofluorescent staining, hemadsorption tests, tetrazolium reduction, metabolic inhibition tests, serological assays, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used for diagnosis and characterization of bacterial pneumonic infections. PCR is the most rapid and effective way to determine the presence of M. pneumoniae, however the procedure does not indicate the activity or viability of the cells present. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) serological assays are the most common method of M. pneumoniae detection used in patient diagnosis due to the low cost and relatively short testing time. One drawback of serology is that viable organisms are required, which may overstate the severity of infection. Neither of these methods, along with others, has been available to medical professionals in a rapid, efficient and inexpensive enough form to be used in routine diagnosis, leading to decreased ability of physicians to diagnose M. pneumoniae infections. Treatment and prevention The majority of antibiotics used to treat M. pneumoniae infections are targeted at bacterial rRNA in ribosomal complexes, including macrolides, tetracycline, ketolides, and fluoroquinolone, many of which can be administered orally. Macrolides are capable of reducing hyperresponsiveness and protecting the epithelial lining from oxidative and structural damage, however they are capable only of inhibiting bacteria (bacteriostatic) and are not able to cause bacterial cell death. The most common macrolides used in the treatment of infected children in Japan are erythromycin and clarithromycin, which inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding 23S rRNA. Administration of antibiotics has been proven to reduce the longevity and intensity of M. pneumoniae infections in comparison to cases left untreated. Additionally, some high-dose steroid therapies have shown to reverse neurological effects in children with complicated infections. The difficulty in eradicating Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections is due to the ability of the bacterium to persist within an individual, as well as the lack of cell wall in M. pneumoniae, which renders multiple antibiotics directed at the bacterial cell wall ineffective in treating infections. M. pneumoniae therefore displays resistance to antimicrobials such as Œ≤-lactams, glycopeptides, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, polymixins, nalidixic acid, and rifampin. Antimicrobial drug resistance rates for Mycoplasma pneumoniae were determined in clinical specimens and isolates obtained during 2011‚Äì2012 in Ontario, Canada. Of 91 M. pneumoniae drug- resistant specimens, 11 (12.1%) carried nucleotide mutations associated with macrolide resistance in the 23S rRNA gene. None of the M. pneumoniae specimens were resistant to fluoroquinolones or tetracyclines. Vaccine design for M. pneumoniae has been focused primarily on prevention of host cell attachment, which would prevent initiation of cytotoxicity and subsequent symptoms. To date, vaccines targeted at the P1 adhesin have shown no reduction in the onset of infection, and some vaccine trials resulted in worsened symptoms due to immune system sensitization. Recent experiments in mouse models have linked this phenomenon to immune system sensitization by the lipid moieties of M. pneumoniae lipoproteins. Introduction of peptides that block adhesion receptors on the surface of the host cell may also be able to prevent attachment of M. pneumoniae. Transmission of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections is difficult to limit because of the several day period of infection before symptoms appear. The lack of proper diagnostic tools and effective treatment for the bacterium also contribute to the outbreak of infection. Using network theory, Meyers et al. analyzed the transmission of M. pneumoniae infections and developed control strategies based on the created model. They determined that cohorting patients is less effective due to the long incubation period, and so the best method of prevention is to limit caregiver-patient interactions and reduce the movement of caregivers to multiple wards.

The board also includes emeritus bishops who once served but are either semi or fully retired. Under the oversight of the Board of Bishops are geographical units called Councils. Councils correspond to state or national boundaries and each council is headed by a Diocesan Bishop, who is appointed by the Board of Bishops. A diocesan bishop can have assistants, called Jurisdictional Bishops. These Jurisdictional Bishops hold only the authority given them by the Diocesan Bishop. Typically they will have authority over a region or part of a state. Reporting under the Jurisdictional Bishop are District Elders, who oversee and assist the elders (pastors and their churches) in his district.

William Eaton's Relationship with Aaron Burr. The Mississippi Valley Historical Review, Vol. 31, No. 4. 1945) was a United States Army officer and the diplomatic officer Consul General to Tunis (1797‚Äì1803). He played an important diplomatic and military role in the First Barbary War between the United States and Tripoli (1801‚Äì1805). He led the first foreign United States military victory at the Battle of Derne by capturing the Tripoli subject city of Derne in support of the restoration of the pasha (local monarch), Hamet Caramelli.Adams, p. 430 William Eaton also gave testimony at the treason trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr.Wheelan, Joseph. Jefferson's Vendetta: The Pursuit of Burr and the Judiciary. Carroll and Graf. 2005 He served one term in the General Court of Massachusetts (state legislature). Eaton died on June 1, 1811 at the age of forty-seven. A World War II destroyer USS Eaton (DD-510) in the United States Navy was named after him. A Tripoli Monument, in memory of the first American military casualties overseas in the battle at Derne, was sculpted of Italian marble by artist Giovanni Micali in 1806, and transported to the United States by the frigate USS Constitution (\\"Old Ironsides\\") and placed at the new national capital of Washington, D.C. at the Washington Navy Yard on the East Branch (now the Anacostia River) of the Potomac River in 1808. Considered the first war monument in the United States, it was unfortunately vandalized by the British during the War of 1812 in August 1814, when they attacked and occupied Washington, burning the public buildings and facilities. Later in 1831, it was relocated to the west front of the United States Capitol, overlooking the National Mall. In 1860, it was relocated to the campus of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, where although moved several more times over the decades, remains there today. In 2001, it underwent repairs and a physical restoration. Consul General Eaton and his actions at Derne with other U.S. Naval personnel along with Greek mercenaries, were loosely portrayed in the 1950 historical feature film Tripoli, starring John Payne, Maureen O'Hara, Howard da Silva. Early life William Eaton was born in Woodstock, Connecticut. He was one of thirteen children of Nathaniel and Sarah (n√©e Johnson) Eaton. His father was a middle class farmer, who worked as a school teacher in the winter, \\"an employment for which he is represented as having been well qualified by more than ordinary means for a farmer\\".Sparks, Jared. The Library of American Biography, Vol. IX. Hillard Gray and Company. 1838 When he was ten years old, William's family moved to Mansfield, Connecticut. He ran away at the age of sixteen to enlist in the army.Prentiss, p. 11 He joined the Continental Army in 1780 and served until 1783, attaining the rank of sergeant at the age of 19. He earned money for college working as a school teacher in Windsor, Vermont. In 1790, he graduated from Dartmouth College. He and a classmate presented a poetic dialogue at the commencement. Between 1791‚Äì1792, he worked as a clerk in the lower house of the Vermont legislatureAdams, p. 429 In 1792, Eaton accepted a captain's commission in the Legion of the United States and married Eliza, the widow of General Timothy Danielson. In 1795, Eaton faced court-martial for charges resulting in a \\"misunderstanding\\" between himself and Lieutenant Colonel Henry Gaither.Prentiss, p. 22 For the charges, which included those of profiteering and \\"liberating from confinement\\"Prentiss, p. 36 a murder suspect, Eaton was sentenced to two months' suspended commission. Despite the conviction, Eaton held his commission until July 11, 1797, when he was appointed U.S. Consul at Tunis.Prentiss, p. 54 He served at that post until war with Tripoli broke out in 1801. Other sources say he left the consul post in 1803.The Encyclopedia Americana. Derne Expedition. 1918 Tunis (1799‚Äì1803) William Eaton, from Naval Documents Eaton's main task in Tunis was to negotiate peace and trade agreements with the bey (governor). During the nineteenth century, European and American merchant ships were under threat by pirates from what was called \\"The Barbary Coast\\". The Barbary Coast was made up of several Muslim states, under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, that bordered the Mediterranean Sea in Northern Africa. They acquired revenue from raiding merchant vessels of their cargo, ransoming their crews or selling them into slavery. The European nations opted to pay tribute to the Barbary states to prevent such raids. After the American Revolution, the United States was left without Britain's protection in Mediterranean, thus the Washington and Adams administrations chose paying tribute to the Barbary states as a cost-effective alternative to military action.Kelly, Jack. Kill the Pirates. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. April 2009. Retrieved on March 31, 2010 By 1796, the United States was behind in payments to the dey of Algiers. In 1797, Joel Barlow, United States Consul to Algiers, negotiated with the dey and promised him a frigate, at the cost of nearly one million dollars. He then sent a French merchant, Joseph Stephen Famin, to negotiate with the bey of Tunis. An agreement was reached, but Congress would not ratify it. United States President John Adams appointed William Eaton as Consult to Tunis to negotiate more agreeable terms.Lyman, Theodore. The Diplomacy of the United States, Vol 2. Wells and Lilly. Boston. 1828United States and the Barbary States. Atlantic Monthly, Vol. 6. 1860 It took two years to accomplish the task. In that time, as the demands of Algiers and Tripoli increased, Eaton had come to believe that it was better to use military force to secure trade in the region, than to continually pay tribute. He wrote an impassioned letter to the Secretary of State, James Madison, voicing the opinion that, \\"The more you give the more the Turks will ask for.\\" Jack Kelly, of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, wrote in the a 2009 article, Kill The Pirates, that Thomas Jefferson favored an international military intervention to the payment of tribute. Kelly said that Jefferson was unable to convince Europe to take such a course. When he became president of the United States, in 1801, he refused to pay tribute to Tripoli. The Atlantic Monthly (1860), called the belief that the United States was the first to refuse tribute to the Barbary pirates a \\"patriotic delusion\\". The article, flouting what it called \\"the popular view\\" of events said, \\"The money question between the President and the pasha was simply one of amount\\". It went on to say that Jefferson was motivated in his actions toward Tripoli by pressure from powerful merchants. The pasha of Tripoli, Yusef Caramelli (sometimes referred to as Caramelli or Karamanli), responded to the lack of payment by declaring war on the United States. Tunis was the closest neighbor to Tripoli and the deposed pasha of Tripoli, Hamet Caramelli, was exiled there. He was, in fact, the elder brother of the reigning pasha, Yusuf Caramelli. William Eaton devised a plan in which the United States would support the restoration of Hamet Caramelli as pasha thereby creating fear of the U.S. within the rest of the Muslim world. He borrowed $22,000 to support the plan, but at this point did not receive the backing of the U.S. government. While the demands for tribute from the bey of Tunis continued, Eaton refused to convey the demands to the United States. He requested that he be recalled, as he felt he could no longer negotiate with the bey. In addition, a U.S. fleet, under the command of Commodore Richard Morris, had recently captured a Tunisian vessel that was headed for Tripoli. Morris came ashore in Tunis to visit Eaton and was arrested for Eaton's debt of $22,000. Eaton borrowed the money to pay the debt from the French Consul-General. At that point the bey ordered him to leave Tunis, which he did in the company of Morris. Hamet Caramelli, having failed at his attempt to regain Tripoli, fled to Egypt. The war with Tripoli and the Battle of Derne Eaton returned to the Barbary region in 1804, this time on a military mission. It had taken months for word of Tripoli's declaration of war on the United States to reach President Jefferson, but he had already sent naval forces to the Barbary Coast because William Eaton had informed him that the situation in Tripoli was \\"nearing a breaking point.\\"Tucker, Spencer. Stephen Decatur: A Life Most Bold and Daring. Naval Institute Press. 2005 Among the vessels that were sent was the USS Philadelphia which, in October, 1803, under the command of Captain William Bainbridge, was sent to blockade Tripoli. The frigate ran aground off the coast of Tripoli and was captured along with its crew of 306 men.Adams, p. 138 Bainbridge had failed to scuttle the ship before being captured, but Stephen Decatur, commander of the USS Intrepid, in a covert mission, destroyed the Philadelphia by burning it, to prevent Tripoli from using it. In May 1804, Eaton was given the commission of a navy lieutenant and sent back to the Barbary regencies, under the supervision of Commodore James Barron, to find Hamet Caramelli and enlist his cooperation in the war. Eaton found Caramelli in Alexandria and signed an agreement with him, although it is unclear if he had the authority to do so. This contract, which was forwarded to Secretary of State Madison, specified that the United States would provide cash, ammunition and provisions for Hamet Caramelli's re-installation as pasha.Lambert, Frank. The Barbary Wars. Hill and Wang. 2005 It also designated William Eaton as \\"General and Commander in Chief\\" of the land forces that were to be used to carry out the operation. The agreement defined the relationship between Caramelli and Eaton as well as their mission, but was never ratified by the United States Senate. The Americans included eight marines and two navy midshipmen. It was with that force that Eaton and Caramelli made the 600 mile trek from Alexandria to Derne, a coastal city within the realm of Tripoli. By the time the band had reached the Gulf of Bomba, they had eaten their last rations and the Arab factions were on the verge of mutiny. Eaton had written to Captain Isaac Hull of the USS Argus requesting that the ship meet them there with supplies, but when they arrived on April 15, there was no ship to be seen. The next day, however, the Argus appeared as Hull had seen the smoke from their fires. After resupplying, they continued their journey, and on April 27, 1805, Eaton's forces attacked and took control of Derne. \\"Captain Presley O'Bannon of the U.S. Marine Corps raised the American flag for the first time over a conquered foreign city.\\" At the Battle of Derne, one marine was killed and two were wounded. Eaton was wounded in the left wrist. Twice Yusef Caramelli's forces tried and failed to take back the city. With the bey of Derne on the run and Hamet Caramelli reestablished in Derne, Eaton thought to march toward Tripoli. He requested reinforcements from Barron but instead received word that US Consul-General Tobias Lear was negotiating peace with Yusef Caramelli. Then he received word from Lear himself that he was to surrender Derne as peace had been reached on June 4. The terms of the treaty required the US to pay $60,000 for the release of the crew of the Philadelphia. Hamet Caramelli and his entourage of about 30 were allowed to leave, but his wife and family were held captive until 1807, as provided in the treaty. Aftermath Although Eaton returned to the United States to a hero's welcome, he was disappointed and embittered by the treaty and outraged that ransom had to be paid for the freeing of the hostages. He had been denied victory in Tripoli and his agreement with Hamet Caramelli was left unkept. Furthermore, the government owed him money that he had fronted for the expedition. He complained loudly that the government was guilty of duplicity in regard to Hamet Caramelli. His complaints drew the attention of Jefferson's enemies in the Federalist party. In January 1806, Congress was presented with a petition from Hamet Caramelli for money and the release of his family from his brother's custody. The issue became partisan with the Federalists supporting Caramelli's and Eaton's claims that the government had rescinded its agreement to re-establish Caramelli as Tripolitan pasha. Jefferson, and his supporters, on the other hand, denied that administration ever intended the arrangement, contending that Eaton had lacked the authority to broker the deal. Nevertheless, despite the Federalist opposition, the treaty with Tripoli was ratified by the Senate in April 1806, and the United States entered into an agreement with a Barbary state that, for the first time, did not include the payment of tribute. Initially, Eaton's victory in Derne was viewed by both parties as the motivating factor for Tripoli in the settlement of the war. However, his willingness to become involved in the partisan bickering cost Eaton official recognition for his accomplishment. It had been proposed that Congress present Eaton with a sword, but Federalists argued that he be given a gold medal. The debate was never resolved thus he did not receive \\"a sword, a medal, a tract of public land or simply a resolution of thanks\\". He did however, receive from Massachusetts in present-day Maine. The trial of Aaron Burr William Eaton was a principal witness in the 1807 treason trial of former United States Vice-President Aaron Burr. Burr was Vice-President during President Thomas Jefferson's first term (1801-1805). Avoiding murder charges resulting from the death of his political rival Alexander Hamilton in a duel (1804), Burr traveled throughout the west. During this time, he met with many military men who were disgruntled with the government, including Eaton and General James Wilkinson. According to Eaton's later testimony, he and Burr met several times, and Eaton came to believe that Burr was planning to raise an army to invade Spanish territory in the southwest and to establish an independent state, with himself as sovereign. Eaton then met with Jefferson to suggest that Burr be given an overseas post, warning that if he was not sent out of the country he would stage an insurrection within eighteen months. The President responded that he felt secure enough in the unity of the American people not to feel threatened by such an insurrection. Eaton again warned of Burr's plans, in the fall of 1806, when he forwarded to the State Department a letter that he had received from his stepson, Timothy Danielson, Jr., sent to him by a friend in Ohio, Morris Belknap. The letter said that Burr had been purchasing boats in Ohio, and offering young men army posts. Finally, Wilkinson sent Jefferson a letter including what he claimed was a decryption of ciphered treasonous correspondence received from Burr. In 1807, Burr was arrested for treason. Although Jefferson privately confided to Senator William Plumber of New Hampshire that he did not think there was enough evidence to convict Burr of treason, his public condemnation of Burr, along with Wilkinson's letter and the deposition of William Eaton, insured an indictment. On January 26, 1807, Eaton gave a deposition regarding his conversations with Burr. The affidavit stated that, as he listened to Burr's ambitions, Eaton came to believe that Burr was planning the overthrow of the United States government. He further stated that Burr offered him the rank of General in his army. Eaton continued to say, > \\"He [Burr] said, if he could gain over the marine corps, and secure the > naval commanders, Truxton, Preble, Decatur, and others, he would turn > Congress neck and heels out of doors; assassinate the President; seize on > the treasury and navy; and declare himself the protector of an energetic > government.\\" Burr's treason trial in Richmond, Virginia, began in August, 1807 with Eaton as the first prosecution witness. Eaton reiterated what he had said in his deposition. To discredit Eaton, the defense questioned Eaton about $10,000 he had received from the federal government since giving his deposition, implying that the administration had paid him for his testimony. Eaton countered that the $10,000 was, in fact, reimbursement for money he spent in the Barbary War (which one source contends was less than what he was owed). Historians are divided on the status of Eaton's testimony. While one states that it was wildly exaggerated,Parton, James. The Life and Times of Aaron Burr, Vol. 2. Houghton and Mifflin. 1857 another counters that \\"Burr apologists\\" are responsible for that point of view. Whatever the case, presiding judge John Marshall and the jury were unconvinced, and Burr was acquitted. Eaton was subpoenaed again for another trial, in Ohio. This time the defense sought to discredit Eaton's testimony by bringing up the court-martial brought against him while he was a captain. By this time the records of the court-martial had been destroyed in a fire. It scarcely mattered anyway, as the trial itself never took place. Final days After peace with Tripoli was made, William Eaton returned to Brimfield, Massachusetts, the place he had called home for most of his life. He was elected to the state legislature, but only served one term. Burr's trial had proved to be a partisan issue, dividing the Federalists and the Jeffersonian Republicans. After the trial Eaton was verbal about the treatment that he had received from the Federalists, notably Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Marshall. Having lost the Federalist vote in Brimfield because of his outspokenness, Eaton failed at his bid for re-election. Eaton suffered from rheumatism and gout, and by all accounts he had taken to drinking heavily. He was also in debt from gambling. He died in Brimfield, June 1, 1811. Eaton predeceased his wife Eliza (n√©e Sikes) Danielson, his stepson, Timothy Danielson and a stepdaughter, and five other children-three daughters; Eliza (married Goodwin), Charlotte (married Sprague) and Almira (married Hayden) and two sons; William Sikes and Nathaniel Johnson. Both of his sons graduated from West Point.Historical Celebration of the Town of Brimfield, Hampden County Massachusetts. Clark W.

It was destroyed by a bomb over the municipality of Soacha on November 27, 1989. All 107 people on board as well as 3 people on the ground were killed. The bombing had been ordered by the Medell√≠n drug cartel.  Aircraft and crew  The aircraft was a Boeing 727-21 with registration number HK-1803, serial number 19035, and manufacturing serial number 272. It had been purchased from Pan Am. The aircraft was built in 1966, and had its maiden flight on May 19 of the same year. The aircraft was powered by three Pratt & Whitney JT8D-7 turbofan engines capable of developing up to of thrust. The aircraft was delivered to Pan Am on May 28, and was registered as N326PA. Avianca purchased the aircraft on November 15, 1975, when it was re-registered as HK-1803. The captain was Jos√© Ignacio Ossa Aristiz√°bal, the first officer was Fernando Pizarro Esguerra, and the flight engineer was Luis Jairo Castiblanco Vargas. There were three flight attendants on board.  Flight  Flight 203 took off as scheduled at 7:13 a.m. Five minutes into the flight, at a speed of and an altitude of , an explosive charge detonated, causing fuel vapors in the empty central fuel tank to ignite. Eyewitnesses on the ground reported seeing fire erupt out of the right side of the aircraft's fuselage. A second blast ripped the airliner apart; the nose section separated from the tail section, which went down in flames. The wreckage was scattered in a three-mile radius around the town of Soacha. All 107 people on board were killed, as well as three people on the ground who were killed by falling debris.  Aftermath  An investigation determined that plastic explosives were used to destroy the plane. Drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, of the Medell√≠n drug cartel, planned the bombing in the lead-up to the 1990 elections, hoping the bomb plot would kill presidential candidate C√©sar Gaviria Trujillo. One account states that two unidentified men dressed in suits who worked for Escobar carried the bomb on board. The men sat in seats 18A and 18K, located above the main fuel tank. At the last moment, one of the men left the aircraft, while his partner stayed on board and was killed in the bombing. Gaviria was not on the aircraft, despite Escobar's expectations, and went on to become President of Colombia. Two Americans were among the dead, prompting the Bush Administration to begin Intelligence Support Activity operations to find Escobar. Nine days after the bombing of the plane, the DAS Building bombing, presumably also ordered by the Medell√≠n Cartel, killed 63 people in Bogot√°. Dandeny Mu√±oz Mosquera, the chief assassin for the Medell√≠n Cartel, was convicted in 1994 in United States District Court of having been involved in the bombing and various other crimes, and was sentenced to 10 consecutive life sentences.  Later events  On November 28, 2016, the Colombian newspaper El Espectador started publishing an investigative report, consisting of 8 chapters, on Flight 203. It argues that the explosion was caused by a malfunctioning fuel pump inside a tank which had been reported several times before. The report was heavily criticized by Avianca and family members of the victims.  In popular culture  The events surrounding this attack was dramatized in Season 1 of the 2015 crime drama TV serial, Narcos. It was shown that the young bomber was in fact also a victim, as Pablo Escobar tricked him under the false pretense of recording a conversation between then presidential candidate Gaviria and other key people. Unbeknown to him, the recorder he received from Pablo was in fact the bomb. While Gaviria and his team did not actually board the aircraft (due to DEA agent Stephen Murphy's intervention at the gate), the boy still detonated the bomb after attempting to record some other key people. To cover his tracks in the aftermath, Escobar had the young bomber's family murdered, leaving behind their infant daughter (later found and adopted by Murphy).

H. Mays in command. Service as oiler Assigned to the Naval Transportation Service, Chenango steamed in the Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Pacific as far as Honolulu on tanker duty. Chenango was present at Aruba, N.W.I. on 16 February 1942 when a German submarine shelled one of the island's refineries. She was decommissioned at New York on 16 March for conversion to an escort carrier. Conversion and combat service as escort carrier Her conversion complete, she was recommissioned as ACV-28 on 19 September 1942. Carrying 77 P-40 Warhawks of the 33rd Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces, Chenango sailed on 23 October with the Torch assault force bound for North Africa, and on 10 November, flew off her aircraft to newly won Port Lyautey, French Morocco. She put into Casablanca on 13 November to refuel 21 destroyers before returning to Norfolk, Virginia, on 30 November, battling through a hurricane en route which caused extensive damage. Quickly repaired, Chenango was underway for the Pacific by mid- December, possibly alongside as part of Task Force 13. Arriving at Noum√©a on 18 January 1943, she joined the escort carrier group providing air cover for supply convoys supporting the invasion and occupation of the Solomon Islands. One of her air groups was sent to Henderson Field, Guadalcanal to give close support to U.S. Marine Corps forces ashore. One of Chenangos duties during this period was to stand sentry off the fiercely contested island. As part of her Solomons operations, Chenangos planes formed an air umbrella to escort to safety and after the cruisers were damaged in the Battle of Kolombangara on 13 July. Redesignated CVE-28 on 15 July, Chenango returned to Mare Island on 18 August for an overhaul, then acted as training carrier for new air groups until 19 October. She steamed from San Diego to join the Gilbert Islands invasion force at Espiritu Santo on 5 November. During the invasion of Tarawa from 20 November-8 December, her planes covered the advance of the attack force, bombed and strafed beaches ahead of the invading troops, and protected off-shore convoys. On 29 November 1943, at 21:57, her Avenger TBFs (Air Group 35) found and sank a Japanese submarine, probably I-21.I-21 Combinedfleet.com She returned to San Diego for another period of training duty. Steaming from San Diego on 13 January 1944, Chenango supported the invasion landings on Roi, Kwajalein, and Eniwetok in the Marshalls operation. After protecting the service group refueling fleet units engaged in the Palau strikes, Chenango arrived at Espiritu Santo on 7 April. She sortied for the landings at Aitape and Hollandia (now Jayapura) (16 April‚Äì12 May), then joined Task Group 53.7 (TG 53.7) for the invasion of the Marianas. Her planes crippled airfield installations, sank enemy shipping, and hammered harbor facilities on Pagan Island, as well as conducting valuable photographic reconnaissance of Guam. From 8 July, she joined in daily poundings of Guam, preparing for the island's invasion. She returned to Manus on 13 August to replenish and conduct training. USS Chenango underway in 1944. From 10‚Äì29 September, Chenango joined in the neutralization of enemy airfields in the Halmaheras in support of the invasion of Morotai, stepping-stone to the Philippines. After preparations at Manus, Chenango cleared on 12 October to conduct softening up strikes on Leyte in preparation for the invasion landings on 20 October. Chenango and her sister ship were attacked by three Japanese planes on the afternoon of D-Day, and shot down all three, capturing one of the pilots. Sailing to Morotai to load new aircraft, Chenango was not in action waters during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, but returned on 28 October to provide replacement aircraft to her victorious sister escort carriers, who had held the Japanese fleet off from Leyte. The next day, she sailed for overhaul at Seattle, Washington until 9 February 1945. After the overhaul period, she again sailed west, arriving at Tulagi in the Solomons on 4 March. Chenango conducted training, then sortied from Ulithi on 27 March for the invasion of Okinawa. She gave air cover in the feint landings on the southern tip of the island, then was assigned to neutralize the kamikaze bases in Sakashima Gunto. On 9 April, a crash-landing fighter started a raging fire among the strike-loaded aircraft on Chenangos deck. Skillful work by her crew saved the ship from serious damage and she remained in action off Okinawa until 11 June. After escorting a tanker convoy to San Pedro Bay, Chenango sailed on 26 July to join the logistics force for the 3rd Fleet, then engaged in the final offensive against Japan. Postwar service and scrapping Following the cease-fire, Chenango supported the occupation forces and evacuated some 1,900 Allied prisoners of war and 1,500 civilians from slave labor camps. She cleared Tokyo Bay on 25 October, and after a brief overhaul at San Diego, returned to \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty, transporting veterans from Okinawa and Pearl Harbor to the West Coast. Chenango sailed from San Pedro, California on 5 February for Boston, and was placed out of commission in reserve there on 14 August 1946. She was reclassified CVHE-28 on 12 June 1955, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959, sold and removed from naval custody on 12 February 1960. Awards Chenango was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation and received 11 battle stars for her World War II service.

The wild man (also wildman, or \\"wildman of the woods\\") is a mythical figure that appears in the artwork and literature of medieval Europe, comparable to the satyr or faun type in classical mythology and to Silvanus, the Roman god of the woodlands. The defining characteristic of the figure is its \\"wildness\\"; from the 12th century they were consistently depicted as being covered with hair. Images of wild men appear in the carved and painted roof bosses where intersecting ogee vaults meet in Canterbury Cathedral, in positions where one is also likely to encounter the vegetal Green Man. The image of the wild man survived to appear as supporter for heraldic coats-of-arms, especially in Germany, well into the 16th century. Renaissance engravers in Germany and Italy were particularly fond of wild men, wild women, and wild families, with examples from Martin Schongauer (died 1491) and Albrecht D√ºrer (1471‚Äì1528) among others. Terminology Late 15th century tapestry from Basel, showing a woodwose being tamed by a virtuous lady A common Middle English term for the figure was woodwose or wodewose (also spelled woodehouse, wudwas etc., understood perhaps as variously singular or plural).OED, \\"Woodwose\\" Wodwosperhaps understood as a plural in wodwos and other wylde bestes, as singular in Wod wose that woned in the knarrez occurs in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (c. 1390).Representative Poetry Online, ANONYMOUS (1100‚Äì1945) , Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, line 720 The Middle English word is first attested for the 1340s, in references to the \\"wild man\\" decorative artwork popular at the time, in a Latin description of an embroidery of the Great Wardrobe of Edward III,diasprez [perhaps: embroidered per totam campedinem cum wodewoses but as a surname it is found as early as 1251, of one Robert de Wudewuse. In reference to an actual legendary or mythological creature, the term is found during the 1380s, in Wycliffe's Bible, translating (LXX Œ¥Œ±ŒπŒºœåŒΩŒπŒ±, Latin pilosi meaning \\"hairy\\") in Isaiah 13:21ther shuln dwelle there ostricchis & wodewoosis; KJV \\"owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there\\"). The occurrences in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight date to soon after Wycliffe's Bible, to c. 1390.Hans Kurath, Robert E. Lewis, Sherman McAllister Kuhn, Middle English Dictionary, University of Michigan Press, 2001, , p. 285 The Old English form of woodwose is unattested, but it would have been either *wudu-wƒÅsa or *wude-wƒÅsa. The first element is usually explained as from wudu \\"wood, forest\\". The second element is less clear. It has been identified as a hypothetical noun *wƒÅsa \\"being\\", from the verb wesan, wosan \\"to be, to be alive\\".Robert Withington, English Pageantry: An Historical Outline, vol. 1, Ayer Publishing, 1972, , p. 74 It might alternatively mean a forlorn or abandoned person, cognate with German Waise and Dutch wees which both mean \\"orphan\\". The Fight in the Forest, drawing by Hans Burgkmair, possibly of a scene from the Middle High German poem Sigenot, about Dietrich von Bern Old High German had the terms schrat, scrato or scrazo, which appear in glosses of Latin works as translations for fauni, silvestres, or pilosi, identifying the creatures as hairy woodland beings. Some of the local names suggest associations with characters from ancient mythology. Common in Lombardy and the Italian-speaking parts of the Alps are the terms salvan and salvang, which derive from the Latin Silvanus, the name of the Roman tutelary god of gardens and the countryside. Similarly, folklore in Tyrol and German-speaking Switzerland into the 20th century included a wild woman known as Fange or Fanke, which derives from the Latin fauna, the feminine form of faun. Medieval German sources give as names for the wild woman lamia and holzmoia (or some variation);Bernheimer, p. 35. the former clearly refers to the Greek wilderness demon Lamia while the latter derives ultimately from Maia, a Greco-Roman earth and fertility goddess who is identified elsewhere with Fauna and who exerted a wide influence on medieval wild-man lore. Slavic has leshy \\"forest man\\". Various languages and traditions include names suggesting affinities with Orcus, a Roman and Italic god of death. For many years people in Tyrol called the wild man Orke, Lorke, or Noerglein, while in parts of Italy he was the orco or huorco.Berheimer, pp. 42‚Äì43. The French ogre has the same derivation, as do modern literary orcs. Importantly, Orcus is associated with Maia in a dance celebrated late enough to be condemned in a 9th- or 10th-century Spanish penitential.Bernheimer, p. 43. The term was usually replaced in literature of the Early Modern English period by classically derived equivalents, or \\"wild man\\", but it survives in the form of the surname Wodehouse or Woodhouse (see Wodehouse family). \\"Wild man\\" and its cognates is the common term for the creature in most modern languages;Bernheimer, p. 42. it appears in German as wilder Mann, in French as homme sauvage and in Italian as uomo selvatico \\"forest man\\".Bernheimer, p. 20. Origins Figures similar to the European wild man occur worldwide from very early times. The earliest recorded example of the type is the character Enkidu of the ancient Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh. Bernheimer, p. 3. The description of Nebuchadnezzar II in the Book of Daniel (2nd century BC) greatly influenced the medieval European concepts.Bernheimer, p. 12. Daniel 4 depicts God humbling the Babylonian king for his boastfulness; stricken mad and ejected from human society, he grows hair on his body and lives like a beast. This image was popular in medieval depictions of Nebuchadnezzar. Similarly, late medieval legends of Saint John Chrysostom (died 407) describe the saint's asceticism as making him so isolated and feral that hunters who capture him cannot tell if he is man or beast.Bernheimer, p. 17. Pontus and his train disguised as wild men at the wedding of Genelet and Sidonia. Illustration of a manuscript of a German version of Pontus and Sidonia (CPG 142, fol. 122r, c. 1475). The medieval wild-man concept also drew on lore about similar beings from the Classical world such as the Roman faun and Silvanus, and perhaps even Heracles. Several folk traditions about the wild man correspond with ancient practices and beliefs. Notably, peasants in the Grisons tried to capture the wild man by getting him drunk and tying him up in hopes that he would give them his wisdom in exchange for freedom.Bernheimer, p. 25. This suggests an association with an ancient tradition ‚Äì recorded as early as Xenophon (d. 354 BC) and appearing in the works of Ovid, Pausanias, and Claudius Aelianus ‚Äì in which shepherds caught a forest being, here termed Silenus or Faunus, in the same manner and for the same purpose. Besides mythological influences, medieval wild man lore also drew on the learned writings of ancient historians, though likely to a lesser degree.Bernheimer, p. 85. These ancient wild men are naked and sometimes covered with hair, though importantly the texts generally localize them in some faraway land, distinguishing them from the medieval wild man who was thought to exist just at the boundaries of civilization. The first historian to describe such beings, Herodotus (c. 484 BC ‚Äì c. 425 BC), places them in western Libya alongside the headless men with eyes in their chest and dog-faced creatures.Bernheimer, p. 86. After the appearance of the former Persian court physician Ctesias's book Indika (concerning India), which recorded Persian beliefs about the subcontinent, and the conquests of Alexander the Great, India became the primary home of fantastic creatures in the Western imagination, and wild men were frequently described as living there. Megasthenes, Seleucus I Nicator's ambassador to Chandragupta Maurya, wrote of two kinds of men to be found in India whom he explicitly describes as wild: first, a creature brought to court whose toes faced backwards; second, a tribe of forest people who had no mouths and who sustained themselves with smells.Bernheimer, p. 87. Both Quintus Curtius Rufus and Arrian refer to Alexander himself meeting with a tribe of fish-eating savages while on his Indian campaign.Bernheimer, p. 88. Distorted accounts of apes may have contributed to both the ancient and medieval conception of the wild man. In his Natural History Pliny the Elder describes a race of silvestres, wild creatures in India who had humanoid bodies but a coat of fur, fangs, and no capacity to speak ‚Äì a description that fits gibbons indigenous to the area. The ancient Carthaginian explorer Hanno the Navigator (fl. 500 BC) reported an encounter with a tribe of savage men and hairy women in what may have been Sierra Leone; their interpreters called them \\"Gorillae,\\" a story which much later originated the name of the gorilla species and could indeed have related to a great ape.Periplus of Hanno, final paragraph Similarly, the Greek historian Agatharchides describes what may have been chimpanzees as tribes of agile, promiscuous \\"seed-eaters\\" and \\"wood-eaters\\" living in Ethiopia.Bernheimer, pp. 87‚Äì88. Medieval representations Some of the earliest evidence for the wild-man tradition appears in the above-mentioned 9th- or 10th-century Spanish penitential. This book, likely based on an earlier Frankish source, describes a dance in which participants donned the guise of the figures Orcus, Maia, and Pela, and ascribes a minor penance for those who participate with what was apparently a resurgence of an older pagan custom. The identity of Pela is unknown, but the earth goddess Maia appears as the wild woman (Holz-maia in the later German glossaries), and names related to Orcus were associated with the wild man through the Middle Ages, indicating that this dance was an early version of the wild-man festivities celebrated through the Middle Ages and surviving in parts of Europe through modern times. Wild people, in the margins of a late 14th-century Book of Hours As the name implies, the main characteristic of the wild man is his wildness. Civilized people regarded wild men as beings of the wilderness, the antithesis of civilization.Yamamoto, pp. 150‚Äì151. Other characteristics developed or transmuted in different contexts. From the earliest times, our sources associated wild men with hairiness; by the 12th century they were almost invariably described as having a coat of hair covering their entire bodies except for their hands, feet, faces above their long beards, and the breasts and chins of the females.Yamamoto, p. 145; 163. Celtic mythology The 9th-century Irish tale Buile ShuibhneBromwich, p. 459. (The Madness of Sweeney) describes how Shuibhne or Sweeney, the pagan king of the D√°l nAraidi in Ulster, assaults the Christian bishop Ronan Finn and is cursed with madness as a result. He begins to grow feathers and talons as the curse runs its full course, flies like a bird and spends many years travelling naked through the woods, composing verses among other madmen. In order to be forgiven by God, King Suibhne composes a beautiful poem of praise to God before he dies. There are further poems and stories recounting the life and madness of King Suibhne.Maureen O'Rourke Murphy, James Mac Killop, eds., Irish literature: a reader, pp. 30‚Äì34, 1987, Syracuse University Press, , 9780815624059, google books The Welsh told a similar story about Myrddin Wyllt, the origin of the Merlin of later romance. In these stories, Myrddin is a warrior in the service of King Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio at the time of the Battle of Arfderydd. When his lord is killed at the battle, Myrddin travels to the Caledonian Forest in a fit of madness which endows him with the ability to compose prophetic poetry; a number of later prophetic poems are attributed to him.Bromwich, p. 458. The Life of Saint Kentigern includes almost the same story, though here the madman of Arfderydd is instead named Lailoken, which may be the original name. The fragmentary 16th-century Breton text An Dialog Etre Arzur Roe D'an Bretounet Ha Guynglaff (Dialog Between Arthur and Guynglaff) tells of a meeting between King Arthur and the wild man Guynglaff, who predicts events which will occur as late as the 16th century.Lacy, Norris J. (1991). \\"An Dialog Etre Arzur Roe D'an Bretounet Ha Guynglaff\\". In Norris J. Lacy, The New Arthurian Encyclopedia, pp. 114‚Äì155. (New York: Garland, 1991). . Geoffrey of Monmouth recounts the Myrddin Wyllt legend in his Latin Vita Merlini of about 1150, though here the figure has been renamed \\"Merlin\\". According to Geoffrey, after Merlin witnessed the horrors of the battle: > ...a strange madness came upon him. He crept away and fled to the woods, > unwilling that any should see his going. Into the forest he went, glad to > lie hidden beneath the ash trees. He watched the wild creatures grazing on > the pasture of the glades. Sometimes he would follow them, sometimes pass > them in his course. He made use of the roots of plants and of grasses, of > fruit from trees and of the blackberries in the thicket. He became a Man of > the Woods, as if dedicated to the woods. So for a whole summer he stayed > hidden in the woods, discovered by none, forgetful of himself and of his > own, lurking like a wild thing. Slavic mythology Wild (divi) people are the characters of the Slavic folk demonology, mythical forest creatures.Belova, 1999, p. 92. Names go back to two related Slavic roots *dik- and *div-, combining the meaning of \\"wild\\" and \\"amazing, strange\\". In the East Slavic sources referred: Saratov dikar, dikiy, dikoy, dikenkiy muzhichok ‚Äì leshy; a short man with a big beard and tail; Ukrainian lisovi lyudi ‚Äì old men with overgrown hair who give silver to those who rub their nose; Kostroma dikiy chort; Vyatka dikonkiy unclean spirit, sending paralysis; Ukrainian lihiy div ‚Äì marsh spirit, sending fever; Ukrainian Carpathian dika baba ‚Äì an attractive woman in seven-league boots, sacrifices children and drinks their blood, seduces men. There are similarities between the East Slavic reports about wild people and book legends about diviy peoples (unusual people from the medieval novel \\"Alexandria\\") and mythical representations of miraculous peoples. For example, Russians from Ural believe that divnye lyudi are short, beautiful, have a pleasant voice, live in caves in the mountains, can predict the future; among the Belarusians of Vawkavysk uyezd, the dzikie lyudzi ‚Äì one-eyed cannibals living overseas, also drink lamb blood; among the Belarusians of Sok√≥≈Çka uyezd, the overseas dzikij narod have grown wool, they have a long tail and ears like an ox; they do not speak, but only squeal. Speculum Regale A wild man is described in the book Konungs skuggsj√° (Speculum Regale or \\"the King's Mirror\\"), written in Norway about 1250: > It once happened in that country (and this seems indeed strange) that a > living creature was caught in the forest as to which no one could say > definitely whether it was a man or some other animal; for no one could get a > word from it or be sure that it understood human speech. It had the human > shape, however, in every detail, both as to hands and face and feet; but the > entire body was covered with hair as the beasts are, and down the back it > had a long coarse mane like that of a horse, which fell to both sides and > trailed along the ground when the creature stooped in walking. Late Medieval Pageants King Charles VI of France and five of his courtiers were dressed as wild men and chained together for a masquerade at the tragic Bal des Sauvages which occurred in Paris at the H√¥tel Saint-Pol, 28 January 1393. They were \\"in costumes of linen cloth sewn onto their bodies and soaked in resinous wax or pitch to hold a covering of frazzled hemp, so that they appeared shaggy & hairy from head to foot\\".Barbara Tuchman;A Distant Mirror, 1978, Alfred A Knopf Ltd, p504 In the midst of the festivities, a stray spark from a torch set their flammable costumes ablaze, burning several courtiers to death; the king's own life was saved through quick action by his aunt, Joann, who covered him with her dress. Renaud de Montauban A \\"black and hairy\\" forest-dwelling outcast is mentioned in the tale of Renaud de Montauban, written in the late 12th century. Martin Schongauer's Wild Men Sammlung Ludwig ‚Äì Artefakt und Naturwunder-Schongauer-Wilder Mann80410 The Metropolitan Museum of Art possesses in its collection four heraldic shield prints which feature the wild men. These prints depict wild men presenting the viewer the coat of arms of the print's patrons. Each image is confined within an approximately 78 mm circular composition which is not new to Schongauer's oeuvre. In Wild Man Holding a Shield with a Hare and a Shield with a Moor's Head, the wild man holds two parallel shields, which seem to project from the groin of the central figure. The wild man supports the weight of the shields on two cliffs. The hair on the apex of the wild man's head is adorned with twigs which project outward; as if to make a halo. The wild man does not look directly at the viewer; in fact, he looks down somberly toward the bottom right region of his circular frame. His somber look is reminiscent of that an animal trapped in a zoo as if to suggest that he is upset to have been tamed. There is a stark contrast between the first print and Shield with a Greyhound, held by a Wild Man as this figure stands much more confidently. Holding a bludgeon, he looks past the shield and off into the distance while wearing a crown of vines. In Schongauer's third print, Shield with Stag Held by Wild Man, the figure grasps his bludgeon like a walking stick and steps in the same direction as the stag. He too wears a crown of vines, which trail behind into the wind toward a jagged mountaintop. In his fourth print, Wild Woman Holding a Shield with a Lion's Head, Schongauer depicts a different kind of scene. This scene is more intimate. The image depicts a wild woman sitting on a stump with her suckling offspring at her breast. While the woman's body is covered in hair her face is left bare. She also wears a crown of vines. Then, compared to the other wild men, the wild woman is noticeably disproportionate. Finally, each print is visually strong enough to stand alone as individual scenes, but when lined up it seems as if they were stamped out of a continuous scene with a circular die. Early modern representations \\"Wild Man\\", c. 1521/22, bronze by Paulus Vischer The wild man was used as a symbol of mining in late medieval and Renaissance Germany. It appears in this context in the coats of arms of Naila and of Wildemann. The town of Wildemann in the Upper Harz was founded during 1529 by miners who, according to legend, met a wild man and wife when they ventured into the wilds of the Harz mountain range. Pedro Gonzalez Petrus Gonsalvus (born 1537) was referred to by Ulisse Aldrovandi as \\"the man of the woods\\" due to his condition, hypertrichosis. Some of his children were also afflicted. It is believed that his marriage to the lady Catherine inspired the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast. In Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale (1611), the dance of twelve \\"Satyrs\\" at the rustic sheep-shearing (IV.iv), prepared by a servant's account: > Masters, there is three carters, three shepherds, three neat-herds, three > swine-herds, that have made themselves all men of hair, they call themselves > Saltiers,Sault, \\"leap\\". and they have a dance which the wenches say is a > gallimaufreyGallimaufrey, \\"jumble, medley\\". of gambols... The account conflates wild men and satyrs. Shakespeare may have been inspired by the episode of Ben Jonson's masque Oberon, the Faery Prince (performed 1 January 1611), where the satyrs have \\"tawnie wrists\\" and \\"shaggy thighs\\"; they \\"run leaping and making antique action.\\"J. H. P. Pafford, note at IV.iv.327f in The Winter's Tale, The Arden Shakespeare, 1963. Modern literary representations The term wood-woses or simply Woses is used by J. R. R. Tolkien to describe a fictional race of wild men, who are also termed Dr√∫edain, in his books on Middle-earth. According to Tolkien's legendarium, other men, including the Rohirrim, mistook the Dr√∫edain for goblins or other wood-creatures and referred to them as P√∫kel-men (Goblin-men). He allows the fictional possibility that his Dr√∫edain were the \\"actual\\" origin of the wild men of later traditional folklore. British poet Ted Hughes used the form wodwo as the title of a poem and a 1967 volume of his collected works. The fictional character Tarzan from Edgar Rice Burroughs' 1912 novel Tarzan of the Apes has been described as a modern version of the wild man archetype. Modern documented representations The actual document of the feral child was Ng Chhaidy living naked in the jungle of India which her hair and fingernails grew for 38 years that she had become a \\"wild woman\\". Interpretation The Wild Man has been discussed in Freudian terms as representative of the \\"potentialities lurking in the heart of every individual, whether primitive or civilized, as his possible incapacity to come to terms with his socially provided world.\\" Heraldry and art=Late Medieval and Renaissance File:Gargouille Cath√©drale de Moulins 060709 06.jpgGargoyle, Moulins Cathedral File:Christian den F√∏rstes sekret 1449.png An early example of the wild man acting as an heraldic supporter appears in the seal of Christian I of Denmark (1450) File:Wilder Mann mit umgeh√§ngtem Wappen 1487.jpg Example from 1487 File:Wilder Mann mit Wappen 1589.jpg Wild-man supporter from 1589 (arms of the Holzhausen family) File:Wild Man, design for a Stained Glass Window by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg Classicized Wild Man design for a stained-glass window, studio of Hans Holbein the Younger, c. 1525‚Äì1528 (British Museum) File:Wild Men and Moors (Detail 09 of 12).jpg Tapestry: Wild Men and Moors circa 1440 (Museum of Fine Arts Boston) Early modern and modern depictions File:Coat of arms of Antwerp (City).svg (be) The city of Antwerp, BE-VAN, introduced supporters for its coat of arms during 1881, placing a \\"wild woman\\" alongside a wild man.Vries, H. de : Wapens van de Nederlanden, Amsterdam, 1995.

The second ship with this name, it was launched on 4 March 1939 as Esso Seakay under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 3) by the Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company at Chester, Pennsylvania, sponsored by Mrs. Charles Kurz. It was acquired by the United States Navy on 18 October 1940 and commissioned on 30 October 1940 as AO-29, with Commander William G. B. Hatch in command. Prior to her acquisition by the Navy, Esso Seakay had been operated by Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso) on the west coast. During her commercial service, she set several records for fast oil hauling. Her original model was a type T3-S2-A1 tanker. World War II After commissioning, Santee served in the Atlantic. When American neutrality ended on 7 December 1941, Santee was carrying oil for a secret airdrome at NS Argentia, Newfoundland. In the spring of 1942, Santees conversion to an aircraft carrier was begun at the Norfolk Navy Yard. 1942 On 24 August 1942, Santee was commissioned as an escort carrier with designation ACV-29, with Commander William Sample in command. The ACV was fitted with such haste that workmen from Norfolk were still on board during her shakedown training and her decks were piled high with stores. After conversion, nominally completed on 8 September, Santee reported to Task Force 22 (TF 22) and the first plane landed on her flight deck on 24 September. SBD bombers on Santee during convoy duty in the Atlantic. After shakedown, Santee departed Bermuda on 25 October and headed for the coast of Africa. While the escort carrier was en route on 30 October, an SBD Dauntless being launched from a catapult dropped a depth bomb onto the flight deck. It rolled off the deck and detonated close to the port bow shaking the entire ship, carrying away the rangefinder and a searchlight base, and damaging radar antennas. Nevertheless, Santee continued steaming with Task Group 34.2 (TG 34.2). On 7 November, the escort carrier, with and and , left the formation and, the following morning, took positions off Safi, French Morocco. Santee launched planes and fueled ships until 13 November, when she rejoined TG 34.2 and returned to Bermuda. The group departed that island on 22 November and anchored in Hampton Roads, Virginia two days later. 1943 After voyage repairs and drydock, Santee got underway with destroyer , on 26 December. On 1 January 1943, Santee anchored at Port of Spain, Trinidad. Two days later, with Eberle and , she headed for the coast of Brazil. After disembarking passengers at Recife, she sailed to join Task Unit 23.1.6 (TU 23.1.6) at sea in tightening the noose on enemy merchant shipping and naval activity in the South Atlantic. For a month, her planes flew anti-submarine missions and regular patrols. On 15 February, the escort carrier put in at Recife, remaining until 21 February. Back conducting routine sorties in the same manner, Santee operated from 21 February ‚Äì 2 March when she again put into Recife. Her next period at sea, which began on 4 March, brought action. On 10 March, light cruiser and destroyer Eberle were investigating a cargo liner which had been spotted by Santees aircraft and which had been tentatively identified as the Karin, a Dutch merchantman. It turned out to be the German blockade runner Kota Nopan (ex-Dutch Kota Pinang). As the Eberle boarding party drew alongside, explosives placed by the abandoning crew detonated, killing eight boarders. On 15 March, Santee set out for Norfolk and anchored at Hampton Roads on 28 March. Underway again on 13 June, with destroyers , , and , Santee reached Casablanca on 3 July. Four days later, the escort carrier departed the harbor with a convoy of homeward-bound empties. No submarines were sighted, but one of her Avengers made a forced landing in Spain, and its crew was interned. Santees small task group left the convoy on 12 July with orders to operate independently against Nazi submarine concentrations south of the Azores. She remained at this anti-submarine work until 25 July and managed to attack seven surfaced U-boats, at the price of two Dauntlesses. On the 25th, she joined a west-bound convoy, which reached the Virginia coast on 6 August. On 26 August, Santee, with Bainbridge and , again headed into the Atlantic; and two days steaming brought them to Bermuda. Santee made another convoy run from Bermuda to Casablanca and back to Hampton Roads from 29 August ‚Äì 13 October. On 25 October, the escort carrier departed the east coast for Casablanca, reaching Basin Delpit on 13 November. Standing out of Casablanca the next day, she rendezvoused on 17 November with battleship , carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt. After providing air cover for the battleship and her escorts for several days, Santee was ordered to the Bay of Biscay, where she engaged in anti-submarine work until the end of November. As TG 21.11, Santee and a trio of four-stackers patrolled the North Atlantic from 1‚Äì9 December. The group was dissolved upon arrival at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 10 December, and Santee, minus her aircraft, stood out of Norfolk on 21 December, and headed for New York in company with battleship , and several destroyers. From 22‚Äì28 December, the escort carrier packed her hangar and flight decks with P-38 Lightning fighter planes at Staten Island. Getting underway in convoy on 29 December, she steamed unchallenged across the North Atlantic, reaching Glasgow on 9 January 1944. 1944 Emptied of her P-38 cargo, Santee departed Glasgow in convoy on 13 January and returned to Norfolk on 24 January. She stood out of Norfolk on 13 February with destroyer escort , transited the Panama Canal on 18‚Äì19 February and moored at San Diego, California, on 28 February. There, she embarked 300 Navy and Marine Corps personnel and 31 aircraft for delivery to Pearl Harbor. She also took on 24 Grumman F4F Wildcats and Grumman TBF Avengers as her own air group. Standing out of San Diego Bay on 2 March, Santee unloaded her ferried aircraft and personnel at Pearl Harbor upon her arrival on 9 March. , , and Santee, all former oilers, swarmed out of Pearl Harbor with a flock of destroyers on 15 March, heading southwest. Designated Carrier Division 22 (CarDiv 22), they joined the fast carriers of the United States Fifth Fleet on 27 March and sped west to the Palaus. There, their planes of CarDiv 22 flew patrols over vulnerable tankers before setting course for Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides on 4 April. In this, the closing phase of the New Guinea campaign, Santee fueled and provisioned near Espiritu Santo from 7‚Äì10 April; then sailed to Purvis Bay, Solomons on 13 April. CarDiv 22 joined CarDiv 24 and a destroyer squadron on 16 April and set course for New Guinea. Santees air group aircraft aided in destroying 100 enemy aircraft and ripping up enemy airfields before the landings, prior to departing for Manus Island, Admiralties, on 24 April. Arriving at Seeadler Harbor the next day, she and her sister ships took on fuel and food; then sailed again on 26 April for Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura). From 12 May ‚Äì 1 June, she traded in her own air arm for 66 F4U Corsairs and 15 F6F Hellcats and personnel of Marine Air Group 21 (MAG 21). On 2 June, CarDiv 22 started north for Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshalls. On 4 August, Santee reached newly-won Guam. The 81 aircraft of MAG 21 became the first planes to operate from the reconquered island. After training exercises and the re-embarkment of her own planes at Manus, Santee got underway on 10 September and rendezvoused with TF 77 near Mapia Island. At Morotai in the Moluccas, her Avengers bombed ground installations. One plane was lost to the enemy, but Santee herself had no contact with the Japanese. By 1 October, she was back in Seeadler Harbor. Sailing from Manus on 12 October, Santee and accompanying combatants reached Philippine waters on 20 October. Her gunners shot down an enemy plane during an air attack that morning, and her aircraft splashed two more. FM-2 flying over Santee in October 1944. At 07:36 on 25 October, Santee launched five Avengers and eight Wildcats for an attack against Japanese surface units some to the north. At 07:40, a kamikaze ‚Äî carrying what was estimated to be a bomb ‚Äì crashed through the flight deck and damaged the hangar deck. At 07:56, a torpedo fired from a Japanese submarine struck the ship, causing flooding of several compartments and creating a 6¬∞ list. Emergency repairs were completed by 09:35. Between 18 and 27 October, Santee planes shot down 31 Japanese planes and sank one ammunition ship, in addition to damage inflicted by strafing during their 377 sorties. On 31 October, she anchored in Seeadler Harbor for temporary repairs. Underway again on 9 November, she moored at Pearl Harbor on 19 November. Following more repairs, she embarked 98 Marines for transportation to the U.S. and entered Los Angeles Harbor on 5 December. Santee completed the year undergoing repairs to battle damage and general overhaul. 1945 After post repair trials at San Diego, the escort carrier headed toward Hawaii on 31 January 1945, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 8 February. On 7 March, she got underway for Ulithi in the Western Carolines, altering her course en route to assist in the search for the B-24 Liberator which had disappeared while carrying Army Lieutenant General Millard F. Harmon, before anchoring on 19 March. Two days later Santee steamed toward Leyte Gulf. On 27 March, Santee departed the Philippines to provide air coverage for southern transport groups Dog and Easy en route to the objective area at Okinawa Gunto for the invasion of Okinawa Jima, the largest combined operation of the Pacific war. On Easter Sunday, 1 April 1945, Santee provided direct support to the American ground forces landing on Okinawa and she continued this duty until 8 April, when she turned to aid British carriers in denying the use of Sakishima Gunto airfields to the enemy. For 42 consecutive dawns, Santees aircraft winged over target sectors in the East China Sea, with daily returns to Okinawa itself for routine ground support. On 16 June, Santee launched a fighter bomber mission against specified targets on Ky≈´sh≈´, Japan. Pulling out of the Okinawa area that day, Santee reached Leyte Gulf on 19 June, where minor repairs were made. Out again on 1 July, she operated west of Okinawa from 5‚Äì14 July, covering minesweeping operations. On 7 July, a tail hook broke on a landing aircraft, allowing it to clear all barriers, crash among parked planes, and cause a fire. Four fighters and two torpedo bombers were jettisoned, six torpedo bombers were rendered non-flyable duds, and one of the pilots of the parked aircraft was killed. Santee was detached from the task unit on 15 July and proceeded to Guam, arriving at Apra Harbor four days later. Following flight deck repairs and general upkeep, the escort carrier got underway on 5 August for Saipan, engaging in carrier aircraft training for squadrons flown from that island en route. Anchoring in Saipan Harbor on 9 August, the CVE got underway for the Philippines on 13 August. Santee received word of the cessation of the hostilities against Japan on 15 August and anchored in San Pedro Bay, Leyte, two days later. On 4 September, while en route to Korea to support occupation forces there, Santee was ordered to northern Formosa to evacuate ex-prisoners of war. On 5 September, the escort carrier received 155 officers and men of the British and Indian Armies from destroyer escort . These soldiers had been captured by the Japanese in Malaya in 1942. They were given medical aid and berthed on the hangar deck. The next day, Santee picked up additional men from and , making a total of 322 officers and men. They included 30 American Army and Navy officers and men who had been taken on Bataan and Corregidor, and 10 officers and men from the Dutch Army and Merchant Marine, captured in Java. On 9 September, Santee disembarked the 477 evacuees at Manila Bay. Five days later, Santee stood out of Manila Bay and steamed for Okinawa, anchoring at Buckner Bay on 19 September. Underway again the next day, Santee reached Wakanoura Wan, Honsh≈´, Japan, on 22 September. From 24‚Äì26 September, Santee steamed along the coast, providing air coverage for occupation forces landing at Wakayama. Post-war Santee departed Wakanoura Wan on 3 October, leaving her formation on 6 October to search for a missing PBM Mariner flying boat carrying Rear Admiral William D. Sample, the ship's first commanding officer after her conversion to an escort carrier. On 20 October, Santee got underway for Okinawa, arriving two days later at Buckner Bay. On 23 October, Santee got underway for Pearl Harbor, disembarking 375 passengers there on 4 November. The next day, Santee continued her role in \\"Operation Magic Carpet\\" by embarking 18 Marines bound for the west coast. Anchoring at San Diego on 11 November, Santee remained there until 26 November, when she got underway for Guam on additional \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty. On 27 February 1946, Santee departed San Diego and arrived at Boston Harbor on 25 March, via the Panama Canal. The CVE was placed in reserve on 21 October. Santee was reclassified on 12 June 1955 as an escort helicopter aircraft carrier, CVHE-29, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959. On 5 December, she was sold to the Master Metals Company for scrap. Awards Santee received nine battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation for her World War II service.

Limes were preferred to all other citrus fruits, not because of higher vitamin C, but because they were easier to preserve.Made in Scotland: Roses Lime Juice, by Carol Foreman From 1795, it became normal practice throughout all long voyages within the Royal Navy, for sailors to receive a daily ration of lemon or lime juice. This quickly gave rise to the nickname \\"limeys\\" amongst non-British sailors, which arises in the early 19th century. The preservation of the fruit juice was usually done through the addition of 15% rum.  History  The grave of Lauchlan Rose, Rosebank Cemetery Lauchlan Rose (1829‚Äì1885), a ship chandler in Leith, began a process for preserving lime juice in 1865 and patented this method to preserve citrus juice without alcohol in 1867. He had realised that preserving the juice with sugar rather than alcohol opened the product up to a far wider market. The first factory producing lime juice was set up as L. Rose & Co. on Commercial Street in Leith, Scotland in 1868. This was located adjacent to the Old East Dock built during the Napoleonic War. This aided both the supply of limes (which do not grow in the UK), and its proximity to what was then Scotland's principal harbour for the Royal Navy. The limes at this time largely came from Dominica in the West Indies. In 1893, Rose purchased plantations there to ensure his supply. This was further supplemented by plantations from Africa from the region now called Ghana. In 1875 the company had grown so much that it built and moved its headquarters to new premises in London (though still retaining its Leith production). In 1940, during The Blitz, it moved its headquarters from the London docks (a key German target) to St. Albans. After the end of World War II, the company saw its market share in the UK grow. In 1957, Schweppes acquired the company and operated it in the UK until it purchased Mott's in 1982. Cadbury Schweppes merged the operations of the two brands in the United States and Rose's US products became domestically produced. When Cadbury divested its US beverage operations in 2008, Rose's was transferred to the newly formed Keurig Dr Pepper. Product In the United Kingdom, Rose's Lime Juice Cordial is manufactured and distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises Ltd. In New Zealand, the label states it is made under \\"the authority\\" of Schweppes Holdings Ltd by Coca-Cola Amatil (NZ). It also bears the notation that Schweppes Holdings Ltd holds a Royal Warrant to HM Queen Elizabeth II as manufacturers of Schweppes and Rose's soft drinks. The majority of limes are now sourced from Mexico and Peru. UK and Canadian production remains close to the original recipe, avoiding artificial preservatives and using sugar rather than corn syrup. New Zealand ingredient list (2013) The ingredients in the modern US product, listed in order of concentration are water, high fructose corn syrup, lime juice concentrate, sodium metabisulfite (preservative #223), natural flavors, Blue 1. Comparatively, in New Zealand, the list is water, lime juice from concentrate (32%), sugar, food acid 330, and preservative 223 ‚Äì and when mixed 1:4 (20% concentrate), contains 6.4% fruit juice.  Brands  Over its history the company added other products to its line-up, including a non-alcoholic triple sec, grenadine, and sweet and sour. The company added a line of flavoured martini drink mixers in the early 2000s. In 2006, the company expanded its product line to feature a brand of mojito flavourings. A licensed brand of lime marmalade is also produced in the United Kingdom, and a lemon cordial is also available in New Zealand. A passion fruit cordial is available in South Africa. The current range includes both the original concentrated squash or cordial and also diluted drink mixers.

School psychologists are educated in psychology, child and adolescent development, child and adolescent psychopathology, education, family and parenting practices, learning theories, and personality theories. They are knowledgeable about effective instruction and effective schools. They are trained to carry out psychological testing and psychoeducational assessment, counseling, and consultation, and in the ethical, legal and administrative codes of their profession. Historical foundations School psychology dates back to the beginning of American psychology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The field is tied to both functional and clinical psychology. School psychology actually came out of functional psychology. School psychologists were interested in childhood behaviors, learning processes, and dysfunction with life or in the brain itself. They wanted to understand the causes of the behaviors and their effects on learning. In addition to its origins in functional psychology, school psychology is also the earliest example of clinical psychology, beginning around 1890. While both clinical and school psychologists wanted to help improve the lives of children, they approached it in different ways. School psychologists were concerned with school learning and childhood behavioral problems, which largely contrasts the mental health focus of clinical psychologists. Another significant event in the foundation of school psychology as it is today was the Thayer Conference. The Thayer Conference was first held in August 1954 in West Point, New York in Hotel Thayer. The 9 day-long conference was conducted by the American Psychological Association (APA).Ysseldyke & Schakel, 1983 The purpose of the conference was to develop a position on the roles, functions, and necessary training and credentialing of a school psychologist. At the conference, forty-eight participants that represented practitioners and trainers of school psychologists discussed the roles and functions of a school psychologist and the most appropriate way to train them. At the time of the Thayer Conference, school psychology was still a very young profession with only about 1,000 school psychology practitioners.Fagan, 2005One of the goals of the Thayer Conference was to define school psychologists. The agreed upon definition stated that school psychologists were psychologists who specialize in education and have specific knowledge of assessment and learning of all children. School psychologists use this knowledge to assist school personnel in enriching the lives of all children. This knowledge is also used to help identify and work with children with exceptional needs. It was discussed that a school psychologist must be able to assess and develop plans for children considered to be at risk. A school psychologist is also expected to better the lives of all children in the school; therefore, it was determined that school psychologists should be advisors in the planning and implementation of school curriculum. Participants at the conference felt that since school psychology is a specialty, individuals in the field should have a completed a two-year graduate training program or a four-year doctoral program.D'Amato, Zafiris, McConnell & Dean, 2011 Participants felt that states should be encouraged to establish certification standards to ensure proper training. It was also decided that a practicum experience be required to help facilitate experiential knowledge within the field. The Thayer Conference is one of the most significant events in the history of school psychology because it was there that the field was initially shaped into what it is today. Before the Thayer Conference defined school psychology, practitioners used seventy-five different professional titles. By providing one title and a definition, the conference helped to get school psychologists recognized nationally. Since a consensus was reached regarding the standards of training and major functions of a school psychologist, the public can now be assured that all school psychologists are receiving adequate information and training to become a practitioner. It is essential that school psychologists meet the same qualifications and receive appropriate training nationwide. These essential standards were first addressed at the Thayer Conference. At the Thayer Conference some participants felt that in order to hold the title of a school psychologist an individual must have earned a doctoral degree. The issues of titles, labels, and degree levels are still debated among psychologists today. However, APA and NASP reached a resolution on this issue in 2010. Social reform in the early 1900s The late 19th century marked the era of social reforms directed at children. It was due to these social reforms that the need for school psychologists emerged. These social reforms included compulsory schooling, juvenile courts, child labor laws as well as a growth of institutions serving children. Society was starting to \\"change the 'meaning of children' from an economic source of labor to a psychological source of love and affection\\". Historian Thomas Fagan argues that the preeminent force behind the need for school psychology was compulsory schooling laws. Prior to the compulsory schooling law, only 20% of school aged children completed elementary school and only 8% completed high school. Due to the compulsory schooling laws, there was an influx of students with mental and physical defects who were required by law to be in school. There needed to be an alternative method of teaching for these different children. Between 1910 and 1914, schools in both rural and urban areas created small special education classrooms for these children. From the emergence of special education classrooms came the need for \\"experts\\" to help assist in the process of child selection for special education. Thus, school psychology was founded. Important contributors to the founding=Lightner Witmer Lightner Witmer has been acknowledged as the founder of school psychology. Witmer was a student of both Wilhelm Wundt and James Mckeen Cattell. While Wundt believed that psychology should deal with the average or typical performance, Cattell's teachings emphasized individual differences. Witmer followed Cattell's teachings and focused on learning about each individual child's needs. Witmer opened the first psychological and child guidance clinic in 1896 at the University of Pennsylvania. Witmer's goal was to prepare psychologists to help educators solve children's learning problems, specifically those with individual differences. Witmer became an advocate for these special children. He was not focused on their deficits per se, but rather helping them overcome them, by looking at the individual's positive progress rather than all they still could not achieve. Witmer stated that his clinic helped \\"to discover mental and moral defects and to treat the child in such a way that these defects may be overcome or rendered harmless through the development of other mental and moral traits\\". He strongly believed that active clinical interventions could help to improve the lives of the individual children. Since Witmer saw much success through his clinic, he saw the need for more experts to help these individuals. Witmer argued for special training for the experts working with exceptional children in special educational classrooms. He called for a \\"new profession which will be exercised more particularly in connection with educational problems, but for which the training of the psychologist will be a prerequisite\\". As Witmer believed in the appropriate training of these school psychologists, he also stressed the importance of appropriate and accurate testing of these special children. The IQ testing movement was sweeping through the world of education after its creation in 1905. However, the IQ test negatively influenced special education. The IQ test creators, Lewis Terman and Henry Goddard, held a nativist view of intelligence, believing that intelligence was inherited and difficult if not impossible to modify in any meaningful way through education. These notions were often used as a basis for excluding children with disabilities from the public schools. Witmer argued against the standard pencil and paper IQ and Binet type tests in order to help select children for special education. Witmer's child selection process included observations and having children perform certain mental tasks. Granville Stanley Hall Another important figure to the origin of school psychology was Granville Stanley Hall. Rather than looking at the individual child as Witmer did, Hall focused more on the administrators, teachers and parents of exceptional children He felt that psychology could make a contribution to the administrator system level of the application of school psychology. Hall created the child study movement, which helped to invent the concept of the \\"normal\\" child. Through Hall's child study, he helped to work out the mappings of child development and focused on the nature and nurture debate of an individual's deficit. Hall's main focus of the movement was still the exceptional child despite the fact that he worked with atypical children. Arnold Gesell Bridging the gap between the child study movement, clinical psychology and special education, Arnold Gesell, was the first person in the United States to officially hold the title of school psychologist, Arnold Gesell. He successfully combined psychology and education by evaluating children and making recommendations for special teaching. Arnold Gesell paved the way for future school psychologists. Gertrude Hildreth Gertrude Hildreth was a psychologist with the Lincoln School at Teacher's College, Columbia then at Brooklyn College in New York. She authored many books including the first book pertaining to school psychology titled, \\"Psychological Service for School Problems\\" written in 1930. The book discussed applying the science of psychology to address the perceived problems in schools. The main focus of the book was on applied educational psychology to improve learning outcomes. Hildreth listed 11 problems that can be solved by applying psychological techniques, including: instructional problems in the classroom, assessment of achievement, interpretation of test results, instructional groupings of students for optimal outcomes, vocational guidance, curriculum development, and investigations of exceptional pupils. Hildreth emphasized the importance of collaboration with parents and teachers. She is also known for her development of the Metropolitan Readiness Tests and for her contribution to the Metropolitan Achievement test. In 1933 and 1939 Hildreth published a bibliography of Mental Tests and Rating Scales encompassing a 50-year time period and over 4,000 titles. She wrote approximately 200 articles and bulletins and had an international reputation for her work in education.  Issues related to school psychology = Intervention  There is a concern with implementing academic and behavioral interventions prior to the determination for special education services, and it has also been proposed that MTSS (Multi-Tiered Systems of Support) may address these concerns .  Prevention  A way in which school psychologists can help students is by creating primary prevention programs (Mul√© et al., 2009). Information about prevention should also be connected to current events in the community.  Issues with assessment process  Empirical evidence has not confirmed biases in referral, assessment, or identification; however, inferences have been made that the special education process may be oversimplified . The National Research Council has called attention to the questionable reliability of educational decision making in special education as there can be vast numbers of false positives and/or false negatives. Misidentified students in special education is problematic and can contribute to long term negative outcomes. During the identification process, school psychologists must consider ecological factors and environmental context such as socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic status may limit funding and materials, impact curriculum quality, increase teacher-to-student ratios, and perpetuate a negative school climate .  Technological issues  With the ever growing use of technology, school psychologists are faced with several issues, both ethical and within the populations they try to serve. As it is so easy to share and communicate over technology, concerns are raised as to just how easy it is for outsiders to get access to the private information that school psychologists deal with everyday. Thus exchanging and storing information digitally may come under scrutiny if precautions such as password protecting documents and specifically limiting access within school systems to personal files. Then there is the issue of how students communicate using this technology. There are both concerns on how to address these virtual communications and on how appropriate it is to access them. Concerns on where the line can be drawn on where intervention methods end and invasion of privacy begin are raised by students, parents, administrators, and faculty. Addressing these behaviors becomes even more complicated when considering the current methods of treatment for problematic behaviors, and implementation of these strategies can become complex, if not impossible, within the use of technology. To incorporate topics in a school, utilize lesson plans for students and staff because the teachers need to ensure the content is connected to other meaningful topics covered in the class/school.  Racial disproportionality in special education  Disproportionality refers to a lack of proportional representation of a group. There continues to be an overrepresentation of minority students in special education . African Americans have been overidentified as having emotional disturbances and intellectual disabilities, and American Indians have been overidentified with learning disabilities. Meanwhile, Hispanic and Asian students may be under identified for special education services . Explanations such as minority populations‚Äô increased susceptibility to certain disabilities based on economic, cultural, or economic disadvantage; as well as social iniquities and race relations have been posed. There may be other alternative explanations for behavior/performance as well .  Cultural biases  Some school psychologists realize the need to understand and accept their own cultural beliefs and values in order to understand the impact it may have when delivering services to clients and families. For example, these school psychologists ensure that students who are minorities, including African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans are being equally represented at the system level, in the classroom, and receiving a fair education. For staff, it is important to look at one's own culture while seeing the value in diversity. It is also vital to learn how to adapt to diversity and integrate a comprehensive way to understand cultural knowledge. Staff members should keep the terms race, privilege, implicit bias, micro aggression, and cultural relevance in mind when thinking about social justice.  Services= Behavior interventions  School psychologists are involved in the implementation of academic, behavioral, and social/emotional interventions within a school across a continuum of supports. These systems and policies should convey clear behavior expectations and promote consistency among educators. Continuous reinforcement of positive behaviors can yield extremely positive results. McGraw, K., & Koonce, D. (2011). Role of the school psychologist: Orchestrating the continuum of school-wide positive behavior support. Comminique,39 (8) Schoolwide positive behavior supports A systematic approach that proactively promotes constructive behaviors in a school can yield positive outcomes. These programs are designed to improve and support students‚Äô social, behavioral, and learning outcomes by promoting a positive school climate and providing targeted training to students and educators within a school.Sullivan, A.

Communiqu√©, 38(1), 1, 14‚Äì15. Data should be collected consistently to assess implementation effectiveness, screen and monitor student behavior, and develop or modify action plans.Sugai, G., & Horner, R. H. (2009). Defining and describing schoolwide positive behavior support. In W. Sailor, G. Dunlap, G. Sugai, & R. H. Horner (Eds.), Handbook of positive behavior support (pp. 307‚Äì326). New York, NY: Springer  Academic interventions  Academic interventions can be conceptualized as a set of procedures and strategies designed to improve student performance with the intent of closing the gap between how a student is currently performing and the expectations of how they should be performing. Short term and long term interventions used within a problem-solving model must be evidence-based. This means the intervention strategies must have been evaluated by research that utilized rigorous data analysis and peer review procedures to determine the effectiveness. Implementing evidence-based interventions for behavior and academic concerns requires significant training, skill development, and supervised practice. Linking assessment and intervention is critical for determining that the correct intervention has been chosen.Batsche, G. M., Castillo, J. M., Dixon, D. N., & Forde, S. (2008). Best practices in linking assessment to intervention. Bethesda, MD: NASP Publications. Upah, K. R. F. (2008). Best practices in designing, implementing, and evaluating quality interventions. Bethesda, MD: NASP Publications. School psychologists have been specifically trained to ensure that interventions are implemented with integrity to maximize positive outcomes for children in a school setting. Systems-level services Leaders in the field of school psychology recognize the practical challenges that school psychologists face when striving for systems-level change and have highlighted a more manageable domain within a systems-level approach ‚Äì the classroom. Overall, it makes sense for school psychologists to devote considerable effort to monitoring and improving school and classroom- based performance for all children and youth because it has been shown to be an effective preventive approach.Lehr, C. A., & Christenson, S. L. (2002). Best practices promoting a positive school climate. In A. Thomas & J. Grimes (Eds.), Best Practices in School Psychology (4th ed.) (p. 930). Bethesda, MD: NASP Publications. = Universal screening = School psychologists play an important role in supporting youth mental wellness, but identifying youth who are in distress can be challenging. Some schools have implemented universal mental health screening programs to help school psychologists find and help struggling youth. For instance, schools in King County, Washington are using the Check Yourself digital screening tool designed by Seattle Children's Hospitalhttp://teenhealthcheck.org to measure, understand, and nurture individual students‚Äô well-being. Check Yourself collects information about lifestyle, behaviour, and social determinants of health to identify at-risk youth so that school psychologists can intervene and direct youth to the services they need.http://www.jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2733175 Mental health screening provides school psychologists with valuable insights so that interventions are better fitted to student needs. =Crisis intervention= Crisis intervention is an integral part of school psychology. School administrators view school psychologists as the school's crisis intervention ‚Äúexperts‚Äù. Crisis events can significantly affect a student's ability to learn and function effectively. Many school crisis response models suggest that a quick return to normal rituals and routines can be helpful in coping with crises. The primary goal of crisis interventions is to help crisis-exposed students return to their basic abilities of problem-solving so the student can return to their pre-crisis level of functioning.  Consultation  Consultation is done through a problem solving method that will help the consultee function more independently without the intensive support of a school psychologist.Akin-Little, A., Little, S. G., Bray, M. A., & Kehle, T. A. (Eds.). (2009). Behavioral interventions in schools: Evidence- based positive strategies. Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association (pp. 14-19)  Social Justice  The three major elements that comprise social justice include equity, fairness, and respect (Shriberg, 2014). The concept of social justice includes all individuals having equal access to opportunities and resources. A major component behind social justice is the idea of being culturally aware and sensitive. American Psychological Association (APA) and the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) both have ethical principles and codes of conduct that present aspirational elements of social justice that school psychologists may abide by. Although ethical principles exist, there is federal legislation that acts accordingly to social justice. For example, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEA) address issues such as poverty and disability to promote the concept of social justice in schools (Shriberg & Moy, 2014). Schools are becoming increasingly diverse with growing awareness of these differences. Cultural diversity factors that can be addressed through social justice practice include race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), religion, and sexual orientation. With the various elements that can impact a student's education and become a source of discrimination, there is a greater call for the practice of social justice in schools. School psychologists that consider the framework of social justice know that injustices that low SES students face can sometimes be different when compared to high SES students (NASP, 2019).  Advocacy  A major role of school psychologists involves advocating and speaking up for individuals as needed. Advocacy can be done at district, regional, state, or national level (Power, 2008). School psychologists advocate for students, parents, and caregivers (NASP, 2019). Consultation and collaboration are key components of school psychology and advocacy. There may be times when school personnel may not agree with the school psychologist. Differing opinions can be problematic because a school psychologist advocates for what is in the best interest of the student (Shriberg & Moy, 2014). School psychologists and staff members can help facilitate awareness through courageous conversations (NASP, 2019).  Multicultural competence  School psychologists offer many types of services in order to be multiculturally competent. Multicultural competence extends to race, ethnicity, social class, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, age, and geographic region . School psychologists are trained to use their skills, knowledge, and professional practices in promoting diversity and advocating for services for all students, families, teachers, and schools. School psychologists may also work with teachers and educators to provide an integrated multicultural education classroom and curriculum that allows more students to be represented in learning.  Education  In order to become a school psychologist, one must first learn about school psychology by successfully completing a graduate-level training program. A B.A. or B.S. is not sufficient. United States  School psychology training programs are housed in university schools of education or departments of psychology. School psychology programs require courses, practica, and internships. = Degree requirements = Specific degree requirements vary across training programs. School psychology training programs offer masters-level (M.A., M.S., M.Ed.), specialist-level degrees (Ed.S., Psy.S., SSP, CAGS), and doctoral-level degrees (Ph.D., Psy.D. or Ed.D.) degrees. Regardless of degree title, a supervised internship is the defining feature of graduate-level training that leads to certification to practice as a school psychologist. Specialist-level training typically requires 3‚Äì4 years of graduate training including a 9-month (1200 hour) internship in a school setting. Doctoral-level training programs typically require 5‚Äì7 years of graduate training. Requirements typically include more coursework in core psychology and professional psychology, more advanced statistics coursework, involvement in research endeavors, a doctoral dissertation, and a one-year (1500+ hour) internship (which may be in a school or other settings such as clinics or hospitals). In the past, a master's degree was considered the standard for practice in schools. As of 2017, the specialist-level degree is considered the entry-level degree in school psychology.Overview of Differences Among Degrees in School Psychology Developed by the National Association of School Psychologists, April 2017. Masters-level degrees in school psychology may lead to obtaining related credentials (such as Educational Diagnostician, School Psychological Examiner, School Psychometrist) in one or two states. International In the UK, the similar practice and study of School Psychology is more often termed Educational Psychology and requires a doctorate (in Educational Psychology) which then enables individuals to register and subsequently practice as a licensed educational psychologist.  Employment in the United States  In the United States, job prospects in school psychology are excellent. Across all disciplines of psychology, the abundance of opportunities is considered among the best for both specialist and doctoral level practitioners.United States Department of Labor Occupational Outlook Handbook (OOH), 2006-2007 Edition. U.S. Bureau of Labor StatisticsMost school psychologists work for schools. Other settings include clinics, hospitals, forensic settings, correctional facilities, universities, and independent practice.American Board of Professional Psychology (n.d.). Specialty certification in school psychology. Brochure retrieved on January 31, 2008 from American Board of Professional Psychology.  Demographic information  According to the NASP Research Committee,National Association of School Psychologists Research Committee (2007). Demographics of the profession of school psychology. Retrieved on December 29, 2007 from University of California, Santa Barbara. 74% of school psychologists are female with an average age of 46. In 2004‚Äì05, average earnings for school practitioners ranged from $56,262 for those with a 180-day annual contract to $68,764 for school psychologists with a 220-day contract. In 2009‚Äì10, average earnings for school practitioners ranged from $64,168 for those with a 180-day annual contract to $71,320 for school psychologists with a 200-day contract. For university faculty in school psychology, the salary estimate is $77,801. Based on surveys performed by NASP in 2009‚Äì2010, it's shown that 90.7% of school psychologists are white, while minority races make up the remaining 9.3%. Of this remaining percentage, the next largest populations represented in school psychology, are African- Americans and Hispanics, at 3% and 3.4% respectively.  Shortages in the Field  There is a lack of trained school psychologists within the field. While jobs are available across the country, there are just not enough people to fill them. Due to the low supply and high demand of school psychologists, being a school psychologist is very demanding. School psychologists may feel under pressure to supply adequate mental health and intervention services to the students in their care. Burnout is a risk of being a school psychologist. = Bilingual School Psychologists = Approximately 21% of school-age children ages 5-7 speak a language other than English.Aud, S., Hussar, W., Kena, G., Bianco, K., Frohlich, L., Kemp, J., & Tahan, K. (2011, May). The Condition of Education 2011 (NCES 2011-033). Washington, DC: National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Department of Education. For this reason, there is an enormous demand for bilingual school psychologists in the United States. The National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) does not currently offer bilingual certification in the field. However, there are a number of professional training opportunities that bilingual LSSPs/School Psychologists can attend in order to prepare to adequately administer assessments. In addition, there are 7 NASP-Approved school psychology programs that offer a bilingual specialization: * Brooklyn College-City University of New York- Specialist Level * Gallaudet University- Specialist Level * Queens College-City University of New York- Specialist Level * San Diego State University- Specialist Level * Texas State University- Specialist Level * University of Colorado Denver- Doctoral Level * Fordham University- Lincoln Center- Doctoral Level New York and Illinois are the only two states that offer a bilingual credential for school psychologists.  International School Psychology  The role of a school psychologist in the United States and Canada may differ considerably from the role of a school psychologist elsewhere.Merrell, K. W., Ervin, R. A., & Gimpel, G. A. (2012). School psychology for the 21st century: Foundations and practices (2nd edition). New York: Guilford. Especially in the United States, the role of school psychologist has been closely linked to public law for education of students with disabilities. In most other nations, this is not the case. Despite this difference, many of the basic functions of a school psychologist, such as consultation, intervention, and assessment are shared by most school psychologists worldwide. It is difficult to estimate the number of school psychologists worldwide. Recent surveys indicate there may be around 76,000 to 87,000 school psychologists practicing in 48 countries, including 32,300 in the United States and 3,500 in Canada.Jimerson, S. R., Steward, K., Skokut, M., Cardenas, S., & Malone, H. (2009). How many school psychologists are there in each country of the world? International estimates of school psychologists and school psychologist-to-student ratios. School Psychology International, 30, 555-567.Oakland, T. D., & Cunningham, J. (1992). A survey of school psychology in developed and developing countries. School Psychology International, 13, 99-129. Following the United States, Turkey has the next largest estimated number of school psychologists (11,327), followed by Spain (3,600), and then both Canada and Japan (3,500 each).  Credentialing  In order to work as a school psychologist, one must first meet the state requirements. In most states (excluding Texas and Hawaii), a state education agency credentials school psychologists for practice in the schools. The Nationally Certified School Psychologist (NCSP) credential offered by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP). The NCSP credential is an example of a non- practice credential as holding the NCSP does not make one eligible to provide services without first meeting the state requirements to work as a school psychologist. State psychology boards (which may go by different names in each state) also offer credentials for school psychologists in some states. For example, Texas offers the LSSP credential which permits licensees to deliver school psychological services within public and private schools.

The ship was requisitioned for conversion to an escort carrier type intended for Royal Navy use and initially commissioned as HMS Charger (D27). Days later the transfer was rescinded with the ship returning to U.S. Navy control to become USS Charger which operated throughout the war as a training ship on the Chesapeake Bay with two ferry missions to Bermuda and Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. After decommissioning in March 1946 the ship was sold in January 1947 to become the Italian Fairsea engaged largely in refugee and immigrant voyages from Europe to Australia. After a disabling engine room fire in January 1969 the ship was sold for scrap in Italy. Construction The United States Maritime Commission (MC) accepted Sun Shipbuilding's bid to build the four C3-P&C; cargo/passenger liners on 29 November 1939 at a cost of $2,720,800 each. Rio de la Plata was planned as the third of four ships to be built by the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Chester, Pennsylvania for the Moore-McCormack company. The modified C3 type was intended for Moore-McCormack's American Republics Line for serving the east coast of the United States to South America and the first large U.S. passenger ships to be fitted with diesel engines. Two six cylinder Sun Doxford diesels with over 9,000 shaft horsepower drove a single propeller through reduction gears for a design speed of . The ships were designed to carry 196 passengersKarsten-Kunibert Krueger-Kopiske has passenger capacity at 216. with all passenger spaces air conditioned, another first for passenger ships. The passenger design was not completed due to requisitioning for war service. The passenger-cargo design was to be a 17,500 ton displacement, vessel, length overall and length between perpendiculars. Cargo capacity, with conditioned air to avoid moisture, was to be (bale measure) with of refrigerated space. Passengers were to be quartered in 76 staterooms, 22 single cabins, 34 double cabins and 20 cabins with private verandahs. The keel for Rio de la Plata, MC hull 61, yard hull 188, was laid 19 January 1940 with launch on 1 March 1941 and delivery on 2 October 1941. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Felipe A. Espil (Courtney Letts de Espil). On 20 May 1941, the United States Maritime Commission requisitioned all four unfinished combiliners, for conversion to military use. Career=United States Navy On 1 August 1941 the four ships were delivered to the Navy for conversion before completion as commercial vessels. Conversion for naval duties was by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., Newport News, Virginia. Intended for transfer to the Royal Navy under Lend-Lease, the former Rio de la Plata was commissioned on 2 October 1941 as HMS Charger (D27), Captain George Abel-Smith RN in command. However, the transfer was rescinded and the ship returned to United States control on 4 October 1941. The vessel was reclassified AVG-30 on 24 January 1942 and commissioned as USS Charger on 3 March 1942, Captain T. L. Sprague USN in command; and reported to the Atlantic Fleet. Listed by the United States Navy as the sole ship of the \\"Charger Type of 1942 (Class)\\", she actually had several sister ships in , , and , all with similar building histories and transferred to the Royal Navy under Lend-Lease. Chargers area of operations throughout the war was Chesapeake Bay, and her duty the basic task of training pilots and ships' crews in carrier operations. Men trained on her decks played an important role in the successful contest for the Atlantic with hostile submarines carried out by the escort carrier groups. Reclassified ACV-30 on 20 August 1942, and CVE-30 on 15 July 1943, Charger left Chesapeake Bay for two ferry voyages, one to Bermuda in October 1942, and one to Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, in September 1945. Charger was decommissioned at New York on 15 March 1946.

After conversion the vessel became the passenger liner Fairsea, nominally for Vlasov's Italian managed Sitmar Line. Successive accommodation upgrades secured the vessel's long-term employment, mainly as a migrant carrier from Europe to Australia. Among the immigrants arriving aboard Fairsea in 1958 was the Gibb family with future Bee Gees Barry, Maurice and Robin. Also aboard was Skyhooks guitarist Red Symons. Fairsea was disabled by an engine-room fire between Tahiti and Panama on 29 January 1969. Primarily due to a lack of spare parts she was sold for scrap in Italy in 1969, the last of the four to cease operation. Her last surviving former sister Biter (later the French Navy's Dixmude), had been returned to the United States and sunk as a target in 1966.

Photorealism is a genre of art that encompasses painting, drawing and other graphic media, in which an artist studies a photograph and then attempts to reproduce the image as realistically as possible in another medium. Although the term can be used broadly to describe artworks in many different media, it is also used to refer specifically to a group of paintings and painters of the American art movement that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s. History=Origins As a full-fledged art movement, Photorealism evolved from Pop ArtLindey (1980), pp. 27‚Äì33.Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 14‚Äì15.Nochlin, Linda, \\"The Realist Criminal and the Abstract Law II\\", Art In America. 61 (November‚ÄìDecember 1973), p. 98. and as a counter to Abstract Expressionism as well as Minimalist art movementsBattock, Gregory. Preface to Meisel, Louis K. (1980), Photorealism. New York:Abrams. pp 8‚Äì10 in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States. Photorealists use a photograph or several photographs to gather the information to create their paintings and it can be argued that the use of a camera and photographs is an acceptance of Modernism. However, the admittance to the use of photographs in Photorealism was met with intense criticism when the movement began to gain momentum in the late 1960s,Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11‚Äì12. despite the fact that visual devices had been used since the fifteenth century to aid artists with their work.Scharf, Aaron (1969), Art and Photography Baltimore: Allan Lane, The Penguin Press. Louis K. Meisel states in his books and lectures the following: The invention of photography in the nineteenth century had three effects on art: portrait and scenic artists were deemed inferior to the photograph and many turned to photography as careers; within nineteenth- and twentieth-century art movements it is well documented that artists used the photograph as source material and as an aid‚Äîhowever, they went to great lengths to deny the fact fearing that their work would be misunderstood as imitations; and through the photograph's invention artists were open to a great deal of new experimentation.Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11‚Äì14. Thus, the culmination of the invention of the photograph was a break in art's history towards the challenge facing the artist‚Äîsince the earliest known cave drawings‚Äîtrying to replicate the scenes they viewed. By the time the Photorealists began producing their bodies of work the photograph had become the leading means of reproducing reality and abstraction was the focus of the art world.Chase, pp. 12‚Äì14. Realism continued as an ongoing art movement, even experiencing a reemergence in the 1930s, but by the 1950s modernist critics and Abstract Expressionism had minimalized realism as a serious art undertaking. Though Photorealists share some aspects of American realists, such as Edward Hopper, they tried to set themselves as much apart from traditional realists as they did Abstract Expressionists.Lindey (1980), p. 12. Photorealists were much more influenced by the work of Pop artists and were reacting against Abstract Expressionism.Lindey (1980), p. 23. Pop Art and Photorealism were both reactionary movements stemming from the ever-increasing and overwhelming abundance of photographic media, which by the mid 20th century had grown into such a massive phenomenon that it was threatening to lessen the value of imagery in art.Chase, p. 14.Prown, Jules David and Rose, Barbara (1977), American Painting: From the Colonial Period to the Present. New York:Rizzoli. However, whereas the Pop artists were primarily pointing out the absurdity of much of the imagery (especially in commercial usage), the Photorealists were trying to reclaim and exalt the value of an image. The association of Photorealism to Trompe L'oeil is a wrongly attributed comparison, an error in observation or interpretation made by many critics of the 1970s and 1980s.Fleming, John and Honour, Hugh (1991), The Visual Arts: A History, 3rd Edition. New York: Abrams. p. 709. . Trompe L'oeil paintings attempt to \\"fool the eye\\" and make the viewer think he is seeing an actual object, not a painted one. When observing a Photorealist painting, the viewer is always aware that they are looking at a painting. Definition The word Photorealism was coined by Louis K. MeiselMeiselgallery.com in 1969 and appeared in print for the first time in 1970 in a Whitney Museum catalogue for the show \\"Twenty-two Realists.\\"Meisel (1989), p. 12. It is also sometimes labeled as Super-Realism, New Realism, Sharp Focus Realism, or Hyper-Realism. Louis K. Meisel, two years later, developed a five-point definition at the request of Stuart M. Speiser, who had commissioned a large collection of works by the Photorealists, which later developed into a traveling show known as 'Photo-Realism 1973: The Stuart M. Speiser Collection', which was donated to the Smithsonian in 1978 and is shown in several of its museums as well as traveling under the auspices of 'site'. The definition for the 'originators' was as follows: > # The Photo-Realist uses the camera and photograph to gather information. # > The Photo-Realist uses a mechanical or semi-mechanical means to transfer the > information to the canvas. # The Photo-Realist must have the technical > ability to make the finished work appear photographic. # The artist must > have exhibited work as a Photo-Realist by 1972 to be considered one of the > central Photo-Realists. # The artist must have devoted at least five years > to the development and exhibition of Photo-Realist work.Meisel (1980), p. > 13. Styles Photorealist painting cannot exist without the photograph. In Photorealism, change and movement must be frozen in time which must then be accurately represented by the artist. Photorealists gather their imagery and information with the camera and photograph. Once the photograph is developed (usually onto a photographic slide) the artist will systematically transfer the image from the photographic slide onto canvases. Usually this is done either by projecting the slide onto the canvas or by using traditional grid techniques.Meisel (1980), p. 14. The resulting images are often direct copies of the original photograph but are usually larger than the original photograph or slide. This results in the photorealist style being tight and precise, often with an emphasis on imagery that requires a high level of technical prowess and virtuosity to simulate, such as reflections in specular surfaces and the geometric rigor of man-made environs.Meisel (1980), p. 15. Artists The first generation of American Photorealists includes the painters Richard Estes, Ralph Goings, Chuck Close, Charles Bell, Audrey Flack, Don Eddy, Robert Bechtle, Ron Kleemann, Richard McLean, John Salt, Ben Schonzeit, and Tom Blackwell.Meisel (1980) Often working independently of each other and with widely different starting points, these original Photorealists routinely tackled mundane or familiar subjects in traditional art genres-- landscapes (mostly urban rather than naturalistic), portraits, and still lifes. With the birth of the Photorealist movement, many painters who were related to Photorealism, continued to pursue and refine their techniques; they became the second generation of Photorealists. These painters included John Baeder, Hilo Chen, Jack Mendenhall, David Parrish and Idelle Weber. In the UK, photorealist approaches were favoured by many artists including Mike Gorman and Eric Scott. The introduction of these European painters to a wider US audience was brought about through the 1982 'Superhumanism' exhibition at the Arnold Katzen Gallery, New York.Wallace, Nora. (October 15, 2015) \\"Photorealism - Technical Mastery and Effortless Style\\" On My Wall Though the movement is primarily associated with painting, Duane Hanson and John DeAndrea are sculptors associated with photorealism for their painted, lifelike sculptures of average people that were complete with simulated hair and real clothes. They are called Verists. Since 2000 Dream of Love (2005), Oil on canvas. Example of Photorealist Glennray Tutor's work Though the height of Photorealism was in the 1970s the movement continues and includes several of the original photorealists as well as many of their contemporaries. According to Meisel and Chase's Photorealism at the Millennium, only eight of the original thirteen photorealists were still creating Photorealist work in 2002.Meisel and Chase (2002), p. 8. As of September 2020, Richard Estes is the only remaining original Photorealist actively working in the Photorealist style. Artists Robert Bechtle, Charles Bell, Tom Blackwell, Ralph Goings, John Kacere, Ron Kleemann have died; Audrey Flack, Chuck Close, Don Eddy, and Ben Schonzeit have moved away from Photorealism; and Robert Cottingham no longer considers himself a photorealist. Newer Photorealists are building upon the foundations set by the original Photorealists. Examples would be the influence of Richard Estes in works by Anthony Brunelli or the influence of Ralph Goings and Charles Bell in works by Glennray Tutor. However, this has led many to move on from the strict definition of photorealism as the emulation of the photograph. Photorealism is also no longer simply an American art movement. Starting with Franz Gertsch in the 1980s Clive Head, Raphaella Spence, Bertrand Meniel, and Roberto Bernardi are several European artists associated with photorealism that have emerged since the mid-1990s. This internationalization of photorealism is also seen in photorealist events, such as The Prague Project, in which American and non-American photorealist painters have traveled together to locations including Prague, Zurich, Monaco and New York, to work alongside each other in producing work. The evolution of technology has brought forth photorealistic paintings that exceed what was thought possible with paintings; these newer paintings by the photorealists are sometimes referred to as \\"Hyperrealism.\\"Meisel and Chase (2002) With new technology in cameras and digital equipment, artists are able to be far more precision-oriented and can produce imagery using a wider range of media. The artist Bill Fink has developed his own technique for creating photorealistic images using soil, pollen, human hair, and cremated human remains. Photorealism's influence and popularity continues to grow, with new books such as Juxtapoz's 2014 book entitled Hyperreal detailing current trends within the artistic genre.

In normal aquaculture, excretions from the animals being raised can accumulate in the water, increasing toxicity. In an aquaponic system, water from an aquaculture system is fed to a hydroponic system where the by-products are broken down by nitrifying bacteria initially into nitrites and subsequently into nitrates that are utilized by the plants as nutrients. Then, the water is recirculated back to the aquaculture system. As existing hydroponic and aquaculture farming techniques form the basis for all aquaponic systems, the size, complexity, and types of foods grown in an aquaponic system can vary as much as any system found in either distinct farming discipline.  History  Woodcut from the 13th century Chinese agricultural manual Wang Zhen's Book on Farming (ÁéãÁ¶éËæ≤Êõ∏) showing rice grown in a floating raft planter system (Êû∂Áî∞, lit \\"framed paddy\\") in a pond Aquaponics has ancient roots, although there is some debate on its first occurrence: *Aztec cultivated agricultural islands known as chinampas in a system considered by some to be an early form of aquaponics for agricultural use, where plants were raised on stationary (or sometime movable) islands in lake shallows and waste materials dredged from the Chinampa canals and surrounding cities were used to manually irrigate the plants. *South China and the whole of Southeast Asia, where rice was cultivated and farmed in paddy fields in combination with fish, are cited as examples of early aquaponics systems, although the technology had been brought by Chinese settlers who had migrated from Yunnan around 5 AD. These polycultural farming systems existed in many Far Eastern countries and raised fish such as the oriental loach (Ê≥•È≥Ö, „Éâ„Ç∏„Éß„Ç¶), swamp eel (ÈªÑÈ≥ù, Áî∞È∞ª), common carp (ÈØâÈ≠ö, „Ç≥„Ç§) and crucian carp (ÈØΩÈ≠ö) as well as pond snails (Áî∞Ëû∫) in the paddies. *The 13th century Chinese agricultural manual Wang Zhen's Book on Farming (ÁéãÁ¶éËæ≤Êõ∏) described floating wooden rafts which were piled with mud and dirt and which were used for growing rice, wild rice, and fodder. Such floating planters were employed in regions constituting the modern provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian. These floating planters are known as either (Êû∂Áî∞) or (ËëëÁî∞), which translates to \\"framed paddy\\" and \\"brassica paddy\\", respectively. The agricultural work also references earlier Chinese texts, which indicated that floating raft rice cultivation was being used as early as the Tang Dynasty (6th century) and Northern Song Dynasty (8th century) periods of Chinese history. Floating aquaponics systems on polycultural fish ponds have been installed in China in more recent years on a large scale. They are used to grow rice, wheat and canna lily and other crops, with some installations exceeding . Diagram of the University of the Virgin Islands commercial aquaponics system designed to yield 5 metric tons of Tilapia per year. The development of modern aquaponics is often attributed to the various works of the New Alchemy Institute and the works of Dr. Mark McMurtry et al. at the North Carolina State University, who devised an \\"Integrated Aqua- Vegeculture System\\" (iAVs) based on the combination of aquaculture and sand- based grow beds. Inspired by the successes of the New Alchemy Institute and McMurtry's iAVs, other institutes soon followed suit. Starting in 1979, Dr. James Rakocy and his colleagues at the University of the Virgin Islands researched and developed the use of deep water culture hydroponic grow beds in a large-scale aquaponics system. Other institutes focused their research on \\"ebb and flow\\" systems (also known as \\"flood and drain\\"), which were partially based on the original ideas developed at North Carolina State University, but where coarse media (such as gravel or expanded clay) replaced sand, while bell syphons allowed an ebb-and-flow irrigation cycle, such systems are also known as \\"Speraneo Systems\\" because they are based on ideas developed in the 1990s by Tom and Paula Speraneo, owners of an aquaponics farm in Missouri. The first aquaponics research in Canada was a small system added onto existing aquaculture research at a research station in Lethbridge, Alberta. Canada saw a rise in aquaponics setups throughout the '90s, predominantly as commercial installations raising high-value crops such as trout and lettuce. A setup based on the deepwater system developed at the University of Virgin Islands was built in a greenhouse at Brooks, Alberta where Dr. Nick Savidov and colleagues researched aquaponics from a background of plant science. The team made findings on rapid root growth in aquaponics systems and on closing the solid-waste loop and found that, owing to certain advantages in the system over traditional aquaculture, the system can run well at a low pH level, which is favored by plants but not fish.  Parts of an aquaponic system  A commercial aquaponics system. An electric pump moves nutrient-rich water from the fish tank through a solids filter to remove particles the plants above cannot absorb. The water then provides nutrients for the plants and is cleansed before returning to the fish tank below. Aquaponics consists of two main parts, with the aquaculture part for raising aquatic animals and the hydroponics part for growing plants. Aquatic effluents, resulting from uneaten feed or raising animals like fish, accumulate in water due to the closed- system recirculation of most aquaculture systems. The effluent-rich water becomes toxic to the aquatic animal in high concentrations but this contains nutrients essential for plant growth. Although consisting primarily of these two parts, aquaponics systems are usually grouped into several components or subsystems responsible for the effective removal of solid wastes, for adding bases to neutralize acids, or for maintaining water oxygenation. Typical components include: * Rearing tank: the tanks for raising and feeding the fish; * Settling basin: a unit for catching uneaten food and detached biofilms, and for settling out fine particulates; * Biofilter: a place where the nitrification bacteria can grow and convert ammonia into nitrates, which are usable by the plants; * Hydroponics subsystem: the portion of the system where plants are grown by absorbing excess nutrients from the water; * Sump: the lowest point in the system where the water flows to and from which it is pumped back to the rearing tanks. Depending on the sophistication and cost of the aquaponics system, the units for solids removal, biofiltration, and/or the hydroponics subsystem may be combined into one unit or subsystem, which prevents the water from flowing directly from the aquaculture part of the system to the hydroponics part. By utilizing gravel or sand as plant supporting medium, solids are captured and the medium has enough surface area for fixed-film nitrification. The ability to combine biofiltration and hydroponics allows for aquaponic system, in many cases, to eliminate the need for an expensive, separate biofilter.  Live components  An aquaponic system depends on different live components to work successfully. The three main live components are plants, fish (or other aquatic creatures) and bacteria. Some systems also include additional live components like worms.  Plants  A Deep Water Culture hydroponics system where plant grow directly into the effluent rich water without a soil medium. Plants can be spaced closer together because the roots do not need to expand outwards to support the weight of the plant. Plant placed into a nutrient rich water channel in a Nutrient film technique (NFT) systemMany plants are suitable for aquaponic systems, though which ones work for a specific system depends on the maturity and stocking density of the fish. These factors influence the concentration of nutrients from the fish effluent and how much of those nutrients are made available to the plant roots via bacteria. Green leaf vegetables with low to medium nutrient requirements are well adapted to aquaponic systems, including chinese cabbage, lettuce, basil, spinach, chives, herbs, and watercress.Spinach seedlings, 5 days old, by aquaponics Other plants, such as tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers, have higher nutrient requirements and will do well only in mature aquaponic systems with high stocking densities of fish. Plants that are common in salads have some of the greatest success in aquaponics, including cucumbers, shallots, tomatoes, lettuce, capsicum, red salad onions and snow peas. Some profitable plants for aquaponic systems include chinese cabbage, lettuce, basil, roses, tomatoes, okra, cantaloupe and bell peppers. Other species of vegetables that grow well in an aquaponic system include watercress, basil, coriander, parsley, lemongrass, sage, beans, peas, kohlrabi, taro, radishes, strawberries, melons, onions, turnips, parsnips, sweet potato, cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, and eggplant as well as the choys that are used for stir fries.  Fish (or other aquatic creatures)  Filtered water from the hydroponics system drains into a catfish tank for re-circulation. Freshwater fish are the most common aquatic animal raised using aquaponics due to their ability to tolerate crowding, although freshwater crayfish and prawns are also sometimes used. There is a branch of aquaponics using saltwater fish, called saltwater aquaponics. There are many species of warmwater and coldwater fish that adapt well to aquaculture systems. In practice, tilapia are the most popular fish for home and commercial projects that are intended to raise edible fish because it is a warmwater fish species that can tolerate crowding and changing water conditions. Barramundi, silver perch, eel-tailed catfish or tandanus catfish, jade perch and Murray cod are also used. For temperate climates when there isn't ability or desire to maintain water temperature, bluegill and catfish are suitable fish species for home systems. Koi and goldfish may also be used, if the fish in the system need not be edible. Other suitable fish include channel catfish, rainbow trout, perch, common carp, Arctic char, largemouth bass and striped bass.  Bacteria  Nitrification, the aerobic conversion of ammonia into nitrates, is one of the most important functions in an aquaponic system as it reduces the toxicity of the water for fish, and allows the resulting nitrate compounds to be removed by the plants for nourishment. Ammonia is steadily released into the water through the excreta and gills of fish as a product of their metabolism, but must be filtered out of the water since higher concentrations of ammonia (commonly between 0.5 and 1 ppm) can impair growth, cause widespread damage to tissues, decrease resistance to disease and even kill the fish. Although plants can absorb ammonia from the water to some degree, nitrates are assimilated more easily, thereby efficiently reducing the toxicity of the water for fish. Ammonia can be converted into safer nitrogenous compounds through combined healthy populations of 2 types of bacteria: Nitrosomonas which convert ammonia into nitrites, and Nitrobacter which then convert nitrites into nitrates. While nitrite is still harmful to fish due to its ability to create methemoglobin, which cannot bind oxygen, by attaching to hemoglobin, nitrates are able to be tolerated at high levels by fish. High surface area provides more space for the growth of nitrifying bacteria. Grow bed material choices require careful analysis of the surface area, price and maintainability considerations.  Hydroponic subsystem  Plants are grown as in hydroponics systems, with their roots immersed in the nutrient-rich effluent water. This enables them to filter out the ammonia that is toxic to the aquatic animals, or its metabolites. After the water has passed through the hydroponic subsystem, it is cleaned and oxygenated, and can return to the aquaculture vessels. This cycle is continuous. Common aquaponic applications of hydroponic systems include: * Deep-water raft aquaponics: styrofoam rafts floating in a relatively deep aquaculture basin in troughs. Raft tanks can be constructed to be quite large, and enable seedlings to be transplanted at one end of the tank while fully grown plants are harvested at the other, thus ensuring optimal floor space usage. * Recirculating aquaponics: solid media such as gravel or clay beads, held in a container that is flooded with water from the aquaculture. This type of aquaponics is also known as closed-loop aquaponics. * Reciprocating aquaponics: solid media in a container that is alternately flooded and drained utilizing different types of siphon drains. This type of aquaponics is also known as flood-and-drain aquaponics or ebb-and-flow aquaponics. * Nutrient film technique channels: plants are grown in lengthy narrow channels, with a film of nutrient-filled water constantly flowing past the plant roots. Due to the small amount of water and narrow channels, helpful bacteria cannot live there and therefore a bio filter is required for this method. * Other systems use towers that are trickle-fed from the top, horizontal PVC pipes with holes for the pots, plastic barrels cut in half with gravel or rafts in them. Each approach has its own benefits. Since plants at different growth stages require different amounts of minerals and nutrients, plant harvesting is staggered with seedlings growing at the same time as mature plants. This ensures stable nutrient content in the water because of continuous symbiotic cleansing of toxins from the water.  Biofilter  In an aquaponics system, the bacteria responsible for the conversion of ammonia to usable nitrates for plants form a biofilm on all solid surfaces throughout the system that are in constant contact with the water. The submerged roots of the vegetables combined have a large surface area where many bacteria can accumulate. Together with the concentrations of ammonia and nitrites in the water, the surface area determines the speed with which nitrification takes place. Care for these bacterial colonies is important as to regulate the full assimilation of ammonia and nitrite. This is why most aquaponics systems include a biofiltering unit, which helps facilitate growth of these microorganisms. Typically, after a system has stabilized ammonia levels range from 0.25 to .50 ppm; nitrite levels range from 0.0 to 0.25 ppm, and nitrate levels range from 5 to 150 ppm. During system startup, spikes may occur in the levels of ammonia (up to 6.0 ppm) and nitrite (up to 15 ppm), with nitrate levels peaking later in the startup phase. In the nitrification process ammonia is oxidized into nitrite, which releases hydrogen ions into the water. Overtime a person's pH will slowly drop, so they can use non-sodium bases such as potassium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide to neutralize the water's pH if insufficient quantities are naturally present in the water to provide a buffer against acidification. In addition, selected minerals or nutrients such as iron can be added in addition to the fish waste that serves as the main source of nutrients to plants. A good way to deal with solids buildup in aquaponics is the use of worms, which liquefy the solid organic matter so that it can be utilized by the plants and/or other animals in the system. For a worm-only growing method, please see Vermiponics.  Operation  The five main inputs to the system are water, oxygen, light, feed given to the aquatic animals, and electricity to pump, filter, and oxygenate the water. Spawn or fry may be added to replace grown fish that are taken out from the system to retain a stable system. In terms of outputs, an aquaponics system may continually yield plants such as vegetables grown in hydroponics, and edible aquatic species raised in an aquaculture. Typical build ratios are .5 to 1 square foot of grow space for every of aquaculture water in the system. of water can support between and of fish stock depending on aeration and filtration. Ten primary guiding principles for creating successful aquaponics systems were issued by Dr. James Rakocy, the director of the aquaponics research team at the University of the Virgin Islands, based on extensive research done as part of the Agricultural Experiment Station aquaculture program. *Use a feeding rate ratio for design calculations *Keep feed input relatively constant *Supplement with calcium, potassium and iron *Ensure good aeration *Remove solids *Be careful with aggregates *Oversize pipes *Use biological pest control *Ensure adequate biofiltration *Control pH Feed source As in most aquaculture based systems, stock feed often consists of fish meal derived from lower-value species. Ongoing depletion of wild fish stocks makes this practice unsustainable. Organic fish feeds may prove to be a viable alternative that relieves this concern. Other alternatives include growing duckweed with an aquaponics system that feeds the same fish grown on the system, excess worms grown from vermiculture composting, using prepared kitchen scraps, as well as growing black soldier fly larvae to feed to the fish using composting grub growers. Plant nutrients Like hydroponics, a few minerals and micronutrients can be added to improve plant growth. Iron is the most deficient nutrient in aquaponics, it can be added through mixing Iron Chelate powder with water. Potassium can be added as potassium sulfate through foliar spray. Less vital nutrients include epsom salt, calcium chloride and boron.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgtue6tbbhc&list;=PLAPahqrfGZZmLPh4vXzRDqWrXP7L9mnWT Biological filtration of aquaculture wastes yield high nitrate concentrations, which is great for leafy greens. For flowering plants with high nutrient demands, it is recommended to introduce supplemental nutrients such as magnesium, calcium, potassium, and phosphorus. Common sources are sulfate of potash, potassium bicarbonate, monoammonium phosphate, etc. Nutrient deficiency in wastewater from fish component (RAS) can be completely masked using raw or mineralized sludge, usually containing 3‚Äì17 times higher nutrient concentrations. RAS effluents (wastewater and sludge combined) contain adequate N, P, Mg, Ca, S, Fe, Zn, Cu, Ni to meet most aquaponic crop needs. Potassium is generally deficient requiring full-fledged fertilization. Micronutrients B, Mo are partly sufficient and can be easily ameliorated by increasing sludge release. The presumption surrounding ‚Äòdefinite‚Äô phyto-toxic sodium levels in RAS effluents should be reconsidered ‚Äì practical solutions available too. No threat of heavy metal accumulation exists within the aquaponics loop. Water usage Aquaponic systems do not typically discharge or exchange water under normal operation, but instead, recirculate and reuse water very effectively. The system relies on the relationship between the animals and the plants to maintain a stable aquatic environment that experience a minimum of fluctuation in ambient nutrient and oxygen levels. Plants are able to recover dissolved nutrients from the circulating water, meaning that less water is discharged and the water exchange rate can be minimized. Water is added only to replace water loss from absorption and transpiration by plants, evaporation into the air from surface water, overflow from the system from rainfall, and removal of biomass such as settled solid wastes from the system. As a result, aquaponics uses approximately 2% of the water that a conventionally irrigated farm requires for the same vegetable production. This allows for aquaponic production of both crops and fish in areas where water or fertile land is scarce. Aquaponic systems can also be used to replicate controlled wetland conditions. Constructed wetlands can be useful for biofiltration and treatment of typical household sewage. The nutrient-filled overflow water can be accumulated in catchment tanks, and reused to accelerate growth of crops planted in soil, or it may be pumped back into the aquaponic system to top up the water level. Energy usage An aquaponics system that uses downwards movement of water and greenhouse light to reduce energy consumption. Aquaponic installations rely in varying degrees on man-made energy, technological solutions, and environmental control to achieve recirculation and water/ambient temperatures. However, if a system is designed with energy conservation in mind, using alternative energy and a reduced number of pumps by letting the water flow downwards as much as possible, it can be highly energy efficient. While careful design can minimize the risk, aquaponics systems can have multiple 'single points of failure' where problems such as an electrical failure or a pipe blockage can lead to a complete loss of fish stock.  Fish stocking  In order for aquaponic systems to be financially successful and make a profit whilst also covering its operating expenses, the hydroponic plant components and fish rearing components need to almost constantly be at maximum production capacity. To keep the bio-mass of fish in the system at its maximum (without limiting fish growth), there are 3 main stocking method that can help maintain this maximum. * Sequential rearing: Multiple age groups of fish share a rearing tank, and when an age group reaches market size they are selectively harvested and replaced with the same amount of fingerlings. Downsides to this method include stressing out the entire pool of fish during each harvest, missing fish resulting in a waste of food/space, and the difficulty of keeping accurate records with frequent harvests. * Stock splitting: Large quantities of fingerlings are stocked at once and then split into two groups once the tank hits maximum capacity, which is easier to record and eliminates fish being \\"forgotten\\". A stress-free way of doing this operation is via \\"swimways\\" that connect various rearing tanks and a series of hatches/moving screens/pumps that move the fish around. * Multiple rearing units: Entire groups of fish are moved to larger rearing tanks once their current tank hits maximum capacity. Such systems usually have 2‚Äì4 tanks that share a filtration system, and when the largest tank is harvested, the other fish groups are each moved up into a bigger tank whilst the smallest tank is restocked with fingerlings. It is also common for there to be several rearing tanks yet no ways to move fish between them, which eliminates the labor of moving fish and allows each tank to be undisturbed during harvesting, even if the space usage is inefficient when the fish are fingerlings. Ideally the bio-mass of fish in the rearing tanks doesn't exceed 0.5 lbs/gallon, in order to reduce stress from crowding, efficiently feed the fish, and promote healthy growth.  Disease and pest management  Although pesticides can normally be used to take care of insects on crops, in an aquaponic system the use of pesticides would threaten the fish ecosystem. On the other hand, if the fish acquire parasites or diseases, therapeutants cannot be used as the plants would absorb them. In order to maintain the symbiotic relationship between the plants and the fish, non-chemical methods such as traps, physical barriers and biological control (such as parasitic wasps/ladybugs to control white flies/aphids) should be used to control pests. The most effective organic pesticide is Neem oil, but only in small quantity to minimize spill over fish's water.. Commercialization of aquaponics is often stalled by bottlenecks in pest and disease management. The use of chemical control methods is highly complicated for all systems. While insecticides and herbicides are replaceable by well‚Äêestablished commercial biocontrol measures, fungicides and nematicides are still relevant in aquaponics. Monitoring and cultural control are the first approaches to contain pest population. Biological controls, in general, are adaptable to a larger extent. Non‚Äêchemical prophylactic measures are highly proficient for pest and disease prevention in all designs.  Automation, monitoring, and control  Many have tried to create automatic control and monitoring systems and some of these demonstrated a level of success. For instance, researchers were able to introduce automation in a small scale aquaponic system to achieve a cost-effective and sustainable farming system. Commercial development of automation technologies has also emerged. For instance, a company has developed a system capable of automating the repetitive tasks of farming and features a machine learning algorithm that can automatically detect and eliminate diseased or underdeveloped plants. A 3.75-acre aquaponics facility that claims to be the first indoor salmon farm in the United States also includes an automated technology. The aquaponic machine has made notable strides in the documenting and gathering of information regarding aquaponics.  Economic viability  Aquaponics offers a diverse and stable polyculture system that allows farmers to grow vegetables and raise fish at the same time. By having two sources of profit, farmers can continue to earn money even if the market for either fish or plants goes through a low cycle. The flexibility of an aquaponic system allows it to grow a large variety of crops including ordinary vegetables, herbs, flowers and aquatic plants to cater to a broad spectrum of consumers. Herbs, lettuce and speciality greens such as basil or spinach are especially well suited for aquaponic systems due to their low nutritional needs. For the growing number of environmentally conscious consumers, products from aquaponic systems are organic and pesticide free, whilst also leaving a small environmental footprint. Aquaponic systems additionally are economically efficient due to low water usage, effective nutrient cycling and needing little land to operate. Because soil isn't needed and only a little bit of water is required, aquaponic systems can be set up in areas that have traditionally poor soil quality or contaminated water. More importantly, aquaponic systems are usually free of weeds, pests and diseases that would affect soil, which allows them to consistently and quickly produce high quality crops to sell.

Regan in command. The ship was named after Prince William sound, Alaska. Service history Following an abbreviated shakedown off the west coast, Prince William reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet‚Äôs air arm to ferry planes and transport personnel to forward areas. Redesignated CVE-31 on 15 July 1943, she operated between the west coast and such places as New Caledonia, Canton Island, Samoa and Espiritu Santo until the spring of 1944. Then, a brief assignment at San Diego, training and qualifying pilots, preceded her return to ferrying duties in mid- April 1944. She completed a run to Townsville, Australia, 7 May 1944, and, on her return to San Diego, was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet. Unloading aircraft and cargo at Port Everglades, Florida, 21 June 1944, she continued on to Norfolk where new navigational equipment (LORAN) was installed. During July and into August, she qualified pilots in the Chesapeake Bay area, then, on 24 August 1944 , resumed plane and personnel ferry services with a run to Casablanca. Returning with worn airplane engines and parts, she moored at Norfolk 26 September 1944 for availability. Prince William returned to training duties in mid-October 1944. Until 26 January 1945, she qualified pilots in the Narrangansett Bay area, then shifted to Key West. There she continued to carry out her mission as a training carrier until returning to Norfolk in May. On 2 June 1945, the CVE got underway for the Panama Canal and on the 8th rejoined the Pacific Fleet. Again assigned to ferrying duties, she transported planes and personnel between the west coast and Hawaii for the remainder of World War II. After the cessation of hostilities, Prince William was assigned to ‚ÄúMagic Carpet‚Äù duty and for the next seven months returned military personnel and equipment to the United States. Completing her last run at San Diego, 21 March 1946, she was ordered to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and on 8 April 1946 got underway for the Panama Canal. Arriving at Norfolk on 23 April 1946, she continued on, two days later, to Philadelphia where she decommissioned 29 August 1946. Reclassified CVHE-31, 12 June 1955, Prince William remained a unit of the Philadelphia Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet until struck from the Naval Register 1 March 1959. She was sold for scrap in Japan in March 1961.

At the 2011 Census, Blackburn had a population of 12,796. At the 2016 Census, Blackburn had a population of 13,940. The origin of the name Blackburn is not certain, but may have been after an early settler or James Blackburn, who designed Yan Yean Reservoir. It lies within the City of Whitehorse, in Melbourne's eastern suburbs. Blackburn is bounded in the west by Middleborough Road, in the north by Springfield Road, in the east by an irregular line along streets to the east of Blackburn Lake Sanctuary - known as the Bellbird area - and in the south by Canterbury Road. History Europeans first settled the area of Blackburn in the 1841s. The area was densely wooded, though orchards and small farms were soon developed. In 1861 the Traveller's Rest Hotel was built on the current site of the Blackburn Hotel. Blackburn Creek Post Office opened on 10 January 1876 and was renamed Blackburn in 1883. During the land boom of the 1880s, brickworks and quarries were established in the area. Blackburn railway station was built in 1882. A primary school was established in 1889. Though the area near the railway station was subdivided in the 19th Century, development was slow and most houses in the suburb were not built until after the Second World War. A large part of Blackburn is of historical significance, as it was built around the artificial Blackburn Lake in 1889, now known as Blackburn Lake Sanctuary, with the lake in the middle of the sanctuary. This was a popular day trip destination by train in the late nineteenth century. Some Australian artists painted in the bush around the Blackburn and Box Hill areas. Of these, Roberts and McCubbin are the best known. The area is protected by strict planning controls restricting development and has retained a village atmosphere.

The species is endemic to the United States. Two subspecies are recognized. The lizard was originally believed to be a subspecies of the eastern glass lizard (Ophisaurus ventralis). Their name comes from their easily broken tail which they can break off themselves without ever being touched. It is difficult to find a specimen with an undamaged tail. The lizard eats a variety of insects and small animals, including smaller lizards. Snakes and other animals are known to prey on the species. Humans have a part in destroying their environment and killing their food supply with insecticides. The lizard is considered to be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though it is vulnerable in Iowa and endangered in Wisconsin. Taxonomy The species was originally believed by American herpetologist Edward Drinker Cope to be a subspecies of Ophisaurus ventralis in 1880 under the name Opheosaurus ventralis attenuatus. It was not until 1885 when the British herpetologist George Albert Boulenger recognized it to be its own species. However, Cope's belief influenced other herpetologists until 1949 when another American herpetologist Wilfred T. Neill expressed his belief that Boulenger was correct about it being a distinct species. The difference between this species with O. ventralis and other species in the genus is that the white spots on its dorsum are located on the posterior edges of its scales, with none of the spots being located mainly in middle of its scales. Another distinctive difference is that this species has 98 or more scales along its lateral fold. In the word Ophisaurus, orphis is Ancient Greek for serpent or reptile and saurus means lizard or reptile. The word attenuatus is Latin for \\"tapered, drawn out, thin\\". Subspecies *Western slender glass lizard, O. a. attenuatus The western slender glass lizard reaches an average of . It can be found in woods or dry rocky hillsides, in grass or the burrows of small mammals. The species can easily camouflage itself in tall grass because of its color. *Eastern slender glass lizard, O. a. longicaudus The males are larger than females with a longer head and tail. Males have more scales above their lateral fold and along the center of their back than females. Larger males have waxy white crossbars on their dorsum's anterior, which have an outline of black and are not present in smaller males and females. Description A western slender glass lizard (O. attenuatus attenuatus) in Missouri Slender glass lizards have yellow to brown bodies with six stripes and they have a middorsal stripe. White specks on the middle of the lizard's scales may sometimes form light stripes. O. attenuatus can attain a total length of to . The species is closely related to collared lizards. Its tail comprises two-thirds of its body length. Its scales are supported by an osteoderm which makes the body hard and stiff. The species has a pointed snout and a non-distinct head. Males and females are of similar size. Its markings may fade as an individual ages. Unlike snakes, they have eyelids and ears. Slender glass lizards have some difficulty moving across smooth surfaces because they do not have the large belly-plates and related muscles of snakes. The body of a snake is more flexible than that of this species and have different shaped scales. Behavior Slender glass lizards are primarily diurnal and they can move fast. If captured, a specimen may thrash vigorously, causing part of the tail to fall off in one or more pieces. While a potential predator is distracted by the wiggling tail, the lizard quickly escapes. They are known to sleep in burrows borrowed from other animals and they will use those burrows to hibernate. The species is active during the day when the weather is cool, but is only active during dawn and dusk when the temperature is hot. Similar to snakes, the species will hibernate in a hibernaculum. The species has also been known to make their own burrows in sandy soil. The lizard hibernates from October until April or May. When a predator breaks off part of its tail, the tail never completely grows back which causes its tail to become shorter each time that it is attacked. They are known as slender glass lizards because their tail can be broken easily. The species can snap off their tail without it being touched and the partial tail that regenerates is tan, but it does not have the pattern of the original tail. The pieces of tail will continue to move once broken off. Two common beliefs are that the pieces of broken tail can grow into new lizards, or rejoin into a new tail. In a 1989 study, 79% of the specimens in the population area had broken tails. It is hard to find a slender glass lizard that has its entire tail. They seldom bite when they are threatened. When they are approached, the lizard will sometimes stay still and try to blend in with the vegetation. Distribution O. attenuatus is found in the midwestern and southeast United States, where it is endemic, in prairies, old fields, or open woodlands, often near water. They can also sometimes be found in longleaf pine forests and human-made debris.Catalogue of American Amphibians and Reptiles Ophisaurus attenuatus Holman, J. Alan. 1971. Diet and predators Slender glass lizards eat a range of insects, such as grasshoppers, crickets and beetles, and will also consume spiders, small rodents, and snails. They have also been known to eat small lizards and small snakes. Unlike snakes, glass lizards do not have flexible jaws, and this limits the size of prey items they can consume. The size of their food can be no larger than the size of their head. They forage underground in burrows. A fold of their skin is able to expand their body when they are breathing, eating a large meal, or when they are carrying eggs. Broad-winged hawks, red-tailed hawks, opossums, coyotes, bob cats, and raccoons are predators of the lizard. Snakes that feed on the lizard include the eastern racer (Coluber constrictor), ring-necked snake (Diadophis punctatus), prairie kingsnake (Lampropeltis calligaster), common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula), and copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix). Reproduction Mating typically occurs biannually in May and they lay 5 to 15 oval eggs in late June or July. Eggs hatch 50‚Äì60 days after being laid and the mother then stays beside them throughout the incubation period. The eggs are laid under objects that can cover them including a log or a board. The eggs hatch after 53 days during August to October. Hatchlings are long and are difficult to find. Sexual maturity is attained at three or four years of age. Conservation status Although not endangered overall in the United States, it is listed as vulnerable in Iowa and endangered in Wisconsin. O. attenuatus is regarded as vulnerable in Iowa, where it is illegal to even capture them. Its primary threats are loss of habitat, and the fragmentation of what remains, by human development. Insecticides are harmful to the lizard because they can kill the insects that they consume and those insects can be ingested by the lizard. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources recommended steps to conserve the slender glass lizard which are to avoid burning grassland from April to October, remove trees mechanically instead of using chemicals, and limiting insecticide use in areas where they are known to inhabit.

It performs on-the-fly encryption with volumes on Mac computers. Versions and key features FileVault was introduced with Mac OS X Panther (10.3), and could only be applied to a user's home directory, not the startup volume. The operating system uses an encrypted sparse disk image (a large single file) to present a volume for the home directory. Mac OS X Leopard and Mac OS X Snow Leopard use more modern sparse bundle disk images which spread the data over 8 MB files (called bands) within a bundle. Apple refers to this original iteration of FileVault as legacy FileVault. Mac OS X Lion (2011) and newer offer FileVault 2, which is a significant redesign. This encrypts the entire OS X startup volume and typically includes the home directory, abandoning the disk image approach. For this approach to disk encryption, authorised users' information is loaded from a separate non-encrypted boot volume (partition/slice type Apple_Boot). FileVault The original version of FileVault was added in Mac OS X Panther to encrypt a user's home directory. Master passwords and recovery keys When FileVault is enabled the system invites the user to create a master password for the computer. If a user password is forgotten, the master password or recovery key may be used to decrypt the files instead. Migration Migration of FileVault home directories is subject to two limitations: * there must be no prior migration to the target computer * the target must have no existing user accounts. If Migration Assistant has already been used or if there are user accounts on the target: * before migration, FileVault must be disabled at the source. If transferring FileVault data from a previous Mac that uses 10.4 using the built-in utility to move data to a new machine, the data continues to be stored in the old sparse image format, and the user must turn FileVault off and then on again to re-encrypt in the new sparse bundle format. Manual encryption Instead of using FileVault to encrypt a user's home directory, using Disk Utility a user can create an encrypted disk image themselves and store any subset of their home directory in there (for example, ). This encrypted image behaves similar to a FileVault encrypted home directory, but is under the user's maintenance. Encrypting only a part of a user's home directory might be problematic when applications need access to the encrypted files, which will not be available until the user mounts the encrypted image. This can be mitigated to a certain extent by making symbolic links for these specific files. Limitations and issuesBackups= :These limitations apply to versions of Mac OS X prior to v10.7 only. Without Mac OS X Server, Time Machine will back up a FileVault home directory only while the user is logged out. In such cases, Time Machine is limited to backing up the home directory in its entirety. Using Mac OS X Server as a Time Machine destination, backups of FileVault home directories occur while users are logged in. Because FileVault restricts the ways in which other users' processes can access the user's content, some third party backup solutions can back up the contents of a user's FileVault home directory only if other parts of the computer (including other users' home directories) are excluded. =Issues= Several shortcomings were identified in Legacy FileVault. Its security can be broken by cracking either 1024-bit RSA or 3DES-EDE. Legacy FileVault used the CBC mode of operation (see disk encryption theory); FileVault 2 uses stronger XTS-AESW mode. Another issue is storage of keys in the macOS \\"safe sleep\\" mode. A study published in 2008 found data remanence in dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), with data retention of seconds to minutes at room temperature and much longer times when memory chips were cooled to low temperature. The study authors were able to use a cold boot attack to recover cryptographic keys for several popular disk encryption systems, including FileVault, by taking advantage of redundancy in the way keys are stored after they have been expanded for efficient use, such as in key scheduling. The authors recommend that computers be powered down, rather than be left in a \\"sleep\\" state, when not in physical control by the owner. Early versions of FileVault automatically stored the user's passphrase in the system keychain, requiring the user to notice and manually disable this security hole. In 2006, following a talk at the 23rd Chaos Communication Congress titled Unlocking FileVault: An Analysis of Apple's Encrypted Disk Storage System, Jacob Appelbaum & Ralf-Philipp Weinmann released VileFault which decrypts encrypted Mac OS X disk image files. A free space wipe using Disk Utility left a large portion of previously deleted file remnants intact. Similarly, FileVault compact operations only wiped small parts of previously deleted data. FileVault 2=Security FileVault uses the user's login password as the encryption pass phrase. It uses the XTS-AES mode of AES with 128 bit blocks and a 256 bit key to encrypt the disk, as recommended by NIST. Only unlock- enabled users can start or unlock the drive. Once unlocked, other users may also use the computer until it is shut down. Performance The I/O performance penalty for using FileVault 2 was found to be in the order of around 3% when using CPUs with the AES instruction set, such as the Intel Core i and MacOS 10.10.3. Performance deterioration will be larger for CPUs without this instruction set, such as older Core CPUs. Master passwords and recovery keys When FileVault 2 is enabled while the system is running, the system creates and displays a recovery key for the computer, and optionally offers the user to store the key with Apple. The 120 bit recovery key is encoded with all letters and numbers 1 through 9, and read from , and therefore relies on the security of the PRNG used in macOS. During a cryptanalysis in 2012, this mechanism was found safe. Changing the recovery key is not possible without re-encrypting the File Vault volume. Validation Users who use FileVault 2 in OS X 10.9 and above can validate their key correctly works after encryption by running in Terminal after encryption has finished. The key must be in form and will return true if correct. Starting the OS with FileVault 2 without a user account If a volume to be used for startup is erased and encrypted before clean installation of OS X 10.7.4 or 10.8: * there is a password for the volume * the clean system will immediately behave as if FileVault was enabled after installation * there is no recovery key, no option to store the key with Apple (but the system will behave as if a key was created) * when the computer is started, Disk Password will appear at the EfiLoginUI ‚Äì this may be used to unlock the volume and start the system * the running system will present the traditional login window. Apple describes this type of approach as Disk Password‚Äîbased DEK.

The name Skaneateles means long lake in one of the local Iroquoian languages. The lake is sometimes referred to as \\"The Roof Garden of the Lakes\\" because its altitude () is higher than the other Finger Lakes.iFingerLakes.com It is one of the cleanest lakes in the United States. It is long ( long including the bogs at the south end of the lake) and on average wide, with a surface area of , and a maximum depth of . The cleanest of the Finger Lakes, its water is so pure that the city of Syracuse and other municipalities use it unfiltered. The City of Syracuse spends about $2.3 million a year to protect lake quality, sixteen people inspecting (usually twice a year) each of the 2600 properties in the watershed, which is relatively small, compared to other Finger Lakes. The lake is the second cleanest lake in the United States as measured by dissolved nitrogen, after Crater Lake in Oregon. William Henry Seward called it \\"The most beautiful body of water in the world.\\" Description Dock in Skaneateles Lake The shores of Skaneateles Lake are in three counties: Onondaga, Cayuga, and Cortland. The village of Skaneateles (population about 2,450) is at the northern end of the lake, in Onondaga County. Summer cottages appeared in 1881, increasing to more than 2000 residences around the lake in 2002. Generally new homes now are built for year-round occupancy rather than summer use and many summer cottages are replaced. The transient and seasonal population of this tourist destination and summer resort surges during the warmer months. Map showing Skaneateles Lake and the other Finger Lakes in relation to Lake Ontario and upstate New York Skaneateles Lake is separated from two other nearby Finger Lakes, Otisco and Owasco, by ridges some 600 feet above the waters, affording magnificent prospects on both sides. Much of the highland terrain is forested, with several large public preserves. Once more cultivated, this region was known for the teasel industry until 1930. Teasels were employed commercially by woolen mills to raise the nap on the material. Although some dairy farms remain in the highlands, occasionally remaining in the same family after many generations, much of the land no longer serves agriculture. There is some experimention with introduction of vineyards, which have proved so successful on the more western Finger Lakes. Skaneateles Lake, however, at elevation 863 feet, may offer a less salubrious microclimate than larger, deeper and lower lakes, like Cayuga Lake, at elevation 382 feet. Landmarks and features Skaneateles Country Club Landmarks and scenic features appear around the lake. Many historic buildings enhance the village of Skaneateles. Carpenter Falls are near the hamlet of New Hope about one mile inland from the southwest shore of the Lake. The hike down to the main waterfall from the road above is on an unimproved cliff face and quite dangerous. The falls are part of the Bahar Nature Preserve that extends along Bear Swamp Creek to the lake.The nature preserve includes the Carpenter Falls Unique Area owned by New York State and the Bahar Nature Preserve that is held by the Finger Lakes Land Trust. See The historic New Hope Mill (closed to public permanently) is nearby. Opposite Carpenter Point is Ten Mile Point, a favorite picnic destination. The southern end of the lake, bounded by high hills (below, right) differs in character from the north. Glen Haven, a hamlet located there, once featured a large resort hotel but now offers smaller visitor accommodations and seasonal dining. On the west side, the high Town of Niles, New York provides scenic prospects. On the east side, the high Town of Spafford, New York offers panoramic views. Between these towns lies deep Glen Haven valley in the Town of Scott, New York, in the third county. The hamlet of Borodino in Spafford retains an 1830 church, little altered, in the Federal style and noted as a center of the abolitionist movement where Frederick Douglass spoke. The lake has long been popular for recreational sailing. Regattas with yachts from other lakes as well as Skaneateles began in 1847. The Skaneateles Country Club now has a boating center. The Lightning, a racing dinghy, was designed and produced in Skaneateles, as was the Comet. There are few marinas or other commercial facilities on the lake shore. Controls are stringent, because the lake is a source of water for the City of Syracuse. There is a New York state public boat launch site on the lake's west side just south of the Skaneateles Country Club marina. Also, on the west side of the lake, about 6 miles south of the Skaneateles Country Club Marina, in the hamlet Mandana, lies the Skaneateles Marina. The town of Spafford has a public boat launch near Borodino on the east side of the lake about four miles south of the Skaneateles Sailing Club. Glen Haven, at the head of the lake (The Finger Lakes flow South to North), offers a marina and docking. Cruises are available from the village. A mailboat serving cottages along the lake also carries passengers. Wildlife In its 2012 Angler Diary, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation cites thirteen species of fish that live in Skaneateles Lake. These species include: rainbow trout, lake trout, lake whitefish, landlocked salmon, smallmouth bass, cisco, rock bass, chain pickerel, pumpkinseed, yellow perch, brown bullhead, bluegill, and common carp. The lake trout are naturally reproducing, while 20,000 rainbow trout and 9,000 landlocked salmon are stocked annually. A large die-off of bass in the spring of 2007 was later confirmed to be due to viral hemorrhagic septicema (VHS), a virus-caused fish disease that has killed millions of fish in the Great Lakes since its presence was noticed in the region in 2005. This is the second of the Finger Lakes found to be contaminated with the virus, after its presence was detected in the westernmost of the Finger Lakes, Conesus Lake, in 2006. The virus and disease are not a threat to human health, but the state of New York is working to slow its spread to other lakes. New state bait regulations were announced on June 6, 2007, aimed at curbing the spread of VHS. VHS can be spread between bodies of water through live or frozen bait fish, roe, live wells, and ballast water, among other ways. Boats and fishing equipment should be disinfected before transfer from Skaneateles Lake to other bodies of water. Environmental issues Run-off from agricultural land around the lake is a source of pollutants such as pesticides and fertilizer According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the lake is affected by pollution from agriculture sources (pesticide and fertilizer use, manure production, and sedimentation), residential sources (septic systems, lawn care, and construction), and streambank erosion. Contaminants from these sources include sediment, nitrogen- and phosphorus-based nutrients, pesticides, bacteria (including fecal coliform), viruses, and protozoa such as giardia and cryptosporidium. The lake has an unusually low watershed-to-lake ratio, and is considered oligotrophic, meaning it is low in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The water is clear and low in vegetation. However, the water clarity quality has reduced in recent years because of massive, algal bloom outbreaks. A stiff, sticky foam on the lake was reported in 2013 to have been visibly increasing for years. The foam accumulates on shorelines and in bays after strong winds. According to the Skaneateles Lake Association, a preliminary analysis indicated the source of the foam was anionic surfactants released during the natural breakdown of organic matter. The phenomenon was reported on other nearby lakes as well. In 2017, the lake experienced a widespread blue-green algal bloom which tested positive for the toxin, thus no longer making it one of the cleanest lakes in the US. microcystin.http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2017/09/high_toxin_level_confirmed_in_skaneateles_lake_algae_bloom.html See also * References Notes Bibliography * Beauchamp, William M.

Creation In October 1920, after taking over the Transjordan region, the United Kingdom formed a unit of 150 men called the \\"Mobile Force\\", under the command of Captain Frederick Gerard Peake, to defend the territory against both internal and external threats.Pollack, Kenneth, Arabs at War, Council on Foreign Relations/University of Nebraska Press, 2002, p.267 The Mobile Force was based in Zarqa. 80% of its men were drawn from the local Chechen community. The Arab army during the Arab revolt of 1916 against the Ottoman Empire, which formed the nucleus of the Arab Legion Arab Legion in Iraq during the Anglo-Iraqi War in 1941 It was quickly expanded to 1,000 men, recruiting Arabs who had served in the Ottoman Army. On 22 October 1923, the police were merged with the Reserve Mobile Force, still under Peake, who was now an employee of the Emirate of Transjordan. The new force was named Al Jeish al Arabi (\\"the Arab Army\\") but was always known officially in English as the Arab Legion. The Arab Legion was financed by Britain and commanded by British officers.Shlaim, Avi (2007), Lion of Jordan: The Life of King Hussein in War and Peace, Allen Lane, , p.17 The Legion was formed as a police force to keep order among the tribes of Transjordan and to guard the important Jerusalem‚ÄìAmman road. On 1 April 1926, the Transjordan Frontier Force was formed from cadre drawn from the Arab Legion. It consisted of only 150 men and most of them were stationed along Transjordan's roads. During this time the Arab Legion was reduced to 900 men and was also stripped of its machine guns, artillery, and communications troops. In 1939, John Bagot Glubb, better known as \\"Glubb Pasha\\", became the Legion's commander, with Major General Abdul Qadir Pasha Al Jundi as his deputy commander. Together they transformed it into the best-trained Arab army. World War II During World War II, the Arab Legion took part in the British war effort against pro-Axis forces in the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre. By then, the force had grown to 1,600 men. The Legion, part of Iraqforce, contributed significantly in the Anglo-Iraqi War and in the Syria- Lebanon campaign, two decisive early victories for the Allies. Pennant used by commanders The top three officers representing the Legion who participated in the Victory March were Major General Abdul Qadir Pasha el Jundi, O.B.E., Colonel Bahjat Bey Tabbara, and Lieutenant Colonel Ahmed Sudqui Bey, M.B.E. 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Arab Legion commander Abdullah el Tell (far right) with Captain Hikmat Mihyar (far left) pose with Jewish prisoners after the fall of Gush Etzion Arab Legion artillery shells illuminate Jerusalem in 1948 The Arab Legion actively participated in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war. With a total strength of just over 6,000, the Arab Legion's military contingent consisted of 4,500 men in four single battalion-sized regiments, each with their own armored car squadrons, and seven independent companies plus support troops. The regiments were organized into two brigades. 1st Brigade contained 1st and 3rd Regiments while 3rd brigade contained 2nd and 4th Regiments. There were also two artillery batteries with four 25-pounders each. On 9 February 1948 the Transjordan Frontier Force was disbanded with members being absorbed back into the Arab Legion. Although headed by Glubb, now a Lieutenant General, command in the field was by Brigadier Norman Lash. The Legion was initially withdrawn from Palestine to Transjordanian territory, under instruction from the United Nations, prior to the end of the British Mandate. With the commencement of hostilities the Legion re-entered Palestine with 1st Brigade heading to Nablus and 2nd Brigade heading to Ramallah. The Arab Legion entered Palestine with other Arab forces on May 15, 1948, using the Allenby, now King Hussein, bridge as they were advancing to cover the approaches from Jenin, in the north to Alaffoula and from Al-Majame'a bridge on the Jordan River to Bissan Alaffoula. There was considerable embarrassment from the UK government that British officers were employed in the Legion during the conflict and all of them, including a brigade commander, were ordered to return to Transjordan. This led to the bizarre spectacle of British officers leaving their units to return to Transjordan, only to sneak back across the border and rejoin the Arab Legion. Without exception all of the British officers returned to their units. One British MP called for Glubb Pasha to be imprisoned for serving in a foreign army without the King's permission. Units of the Arab Legion were engaged in several battles with the Jewish forces, including the following: * Attacking Ben Shemen convoy at Beit Nabala ‚Äì 14 December 1947 Morris, 2008, p. 105 * Battle of Neve Yaakov settlement ‚Äì 18 April 1948Gelber, Yoav, Palestine 1948: War, Escape and the Emergence of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, Sussex Academic Press, Brighton & Portland 2006 (2nd edition), p. 90 * Attacking Kibutz Gesher on 27‚Äì28 April 1948 * Occupation of the Tegart fort at Latrun on 17 May 1948,Morris, 2008, p. 132 and later the Battles of Latrun from 20 May to 18 July 1948. * Battle for Jerusalem (1948) and Siege of Jerusalem from 17 May to 18 July 1948, * Attacking and capturing (but later losing) Kibbutz Gezer on 10 June 1948,Morris, 2008, p. 230 * Tarqumiya on 24 October 1948.Morris, 2008, p. 332 By the end of the war in 1949, the Arab Legion consisted of over 10,000 men manning a 100-mile front, which then expanded to a 400-mile front following the withdrawal of Iraqi forces. Further clashes with Israel Vickers VC.1 Viking of the Arab Legion Air Force in 1955 On September 11, 1956, an Israeli force in what the IDF termed one of its retribution operations, Operation Jehonathan, raided Jordanian territory at Al-Rahwa, Hebron Sector, attacking the police station and clashing with a unit from the Legion's Desert Force. Over twenty soldiers and policemen were killed.Morris, Benny (1993) Israel's Border Wars, 1949 - 1956. Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation, and the Countdown to the Suez War. Oxford University Press, . Page 392. The Legion generally stayed out of the 1956 Suez Crisis. Jordanian army On 1 March 1956, the Arab Legion was renamed as the Arab Army (now Jordanian Armed Forces) as part of the Arabization of its command, under which King Hussein of Jordan dismissed the Legion's British commander \\"Glubb Pasha\\" and other senior British officers. In Israel, the Hebrew term \\"Ligioner\\" (◊ú◊ô◊í◊ô◊ï◊†◊®), i.e. \\"Legionary\\" was still informally used for Jordanian soldiers for many years afterwards, also at the time of the 1967 war and its aftermath.

History The first purpose-built Orthodox Christian church to open in Japan was a wooden Russian Consulate chapel of the Resurrection of Christ, in Hakodate, Hokkaid≈ç, consecrated in October 1860. In July 1861, the young Russian Hieromonk, Nikolay Kassatkin (subsequently canonized and known as Nicholas of Japan), arrived in Hakodate to serve at the consulate as a priest. He proved to be the first to learn the local language and customs to be able to spread Orthodox Christianity amongst the local populace.St. Nicholas, Equal of the Apostles and Archbishop of Japan. OCA. Though the sh≈çguns government at the time prohibited Japanese conversion to Christianity, some locals who frequented the chapel did convert in 1864. While they were his first converts in Japan, they were not the first Japanese to become Orthodox Christians: some Japanese who had settled in Russia had converted to Orthodox Christianity. On Kassatkin‚Ä≤s initiative, the Russian Imperial government established the Russian Spiritual Mission to Japan in 1870. 1882 council of the Orthodox Church in Japan Kassatkin moved to Tokyo in 1872 and went on to stay in Japan most of the time until his death in 1912, even during the Russo- Japanese War (1904-1905). He was consecrated bishop in the Alexander Nevsky Lavra in Saint Petersburg, the Russian Empire, in March 1880 (initially, his title was that of the auxiliary bishop of Reval; Archbishop of Tokyo and Japan since March 1906). Kassatkin travelled across Russia to collect funds for construction of the Orthodox Cathedral in Tokyo, which was inaugurated in Kanda district in 1891 and went on to be known after him as Nikorai-do. Nikolay Kassatkin made Japanese translations of the New Testament and some liturgical books (Lenten Triodion, Pentecostarion, Feast Services, Book of Psalms, Irmologion). By the end of 1890, according to Kassatkin‚Ä≤s report, the Orthodox Church in Japan (the Russian Spiritual Mission to Japan) had 18,625 baptized faithful. The Russo-Japanese War (1904‚Äì1905) created a politically difficult situation for the Church. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, communications and the support from the Church in Russia (the USSR) were severely curtailed. The Japanese government had new suspicions about the Japanese Orthodox Church; in particular, that it was used by the Soviets as a cover for espionage. The second bishop of Japan (from 1912), Sergius (Sergii) Tikhomirov, who was one of a handful of Russian √©migr√© bishops who remained loyal to the USSR-based Moscow Patriarchate (rather than the Kingdom of Yugoslavia-based ROCOR, which from the late 1920s automatically meant loyalty to the government of the USSR) suffered from such suspicions on the part of the Japanese government, and was forced to resign his position in September 1940. The Great Kant≈ç earthquake in 1923 did serious damage to the Japanese Orthodox Church. The headquarters, Nikorai-do, was destroyed and burnt, including its library with many valuable documents. Nikorai-do was rebuilt in 1929 thanks to contributions gathered from the faithful, whom metropolitan Sergius visited nationwide. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), which from 1939 to 1945 was part of World War II, the Christians in Japan suffered severe conditions, the Orthodox Church especially. During the war the Japanese Orthodox Church had had almost no foreign contact. Following the surrender of Japan (August 1945), the occupation regime had a benevolent attitude toward Christian groups, given their predominantly American connections. As the majority of the Slavic- and Greek-Americans would attend local Orthodox Christian parishes and more Russian refugees began to arrive in Japan fleeing the Communist regime in China, the Orthodox Christian community in Japan was re-invigorated. In 1946, the precursor to the Orthodox Church in America (OCA), the Metropolia (a de facto independent jurisdiction at the time), on the initiative of U.S. Army Colonel Boris Pash, took steps to prevent the Moscow Patriarchate from re-establishing its control over the Japanese Church despite the vigorous efforts the latter undertook to this end. The following year, the Japanese Church largely switched over under the Metropolia‚Ä≤s jurisdiction and would be governed by bishops sent from the U.S. by the Metroplia until March 1972. Several Japanese youths who would study at the Metroplia's Saint Vladimir‚Äôs Orthodox Theological Seminary, then in New York City, would subsequently become leaders (primates) of the Japanese Church. Annunciation Cathedral in Kyoto As the Metroplia in the late 1960s gradually restored relations with the Moscow Patriarchate (whose external activity was fully controlled and guided by the Soviet government and specifically by the KGBFelix Corley. The Svyatoslav Files: Metropolitan Nikodim and the KGB) with a view to obtaining autocephaly (i. e. legitimate administrative independence), the Japanese Church was handed over to the Russian jurisdiction. On 10 April 1970, a few days prior to the death of Russian Patriarch Alexius I, Nikolay Kassatkin was canonised by the Moscow Patriarchate in a package deal of granting autocephaly to the OCA and re- establishing control over the Church of Japan.Agreement on the Autocephaly for the Orthodox Church in America // Article X ‚Äì Orthodox Church in Japan. The official web site of the OCA. The act of granting autocephaly by the Moscow Patriarchate was strongly condemned by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople as violating canon law. In 2005, the first Orthodox Christian monastic house (male) of the Japanese Autonomous Orthodox Church was opened in Tokyo near Holy Resurrection Cathedral (Nikolai-do). The abbot of the monastic community, Hieromonk Gerasimus (Shevtsov) of the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra, was dispatched by the Holy Synod of the Moscow Patrirchate and arrived in Japan at the end of 2005.–ñ–£–†–ù–ê–õ–´ –∑–∞—Å–µ–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è –°–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –°–∏–Ω–æ–¥–∞ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –ü—Ä–∞–≤–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–π –¶–µ—Ä–∫–≤–∏ –æ—Ç 16 –∏—é–ª—è 2005 –≥–æ–¥–∞ / –ñ–£–†–ù–ê–õ ‚Ññ 47, 16 July 2005.

The Orthodox Church in Japan runs the Tokyo Orthodox Seminary. The seminary accepts only male faithfuls and gives a three-year theological education to those who expect to become ordained presbyters and missionaries. The Seminary also publishes a monthly journal, \\"Seikyo Jiho\\". The Orthodox Church in Japan publishes religious books, including the Japanese Orthodox translation of the New Testament and Psalms and liturgical texts, available as texts alone or with musical scores. Its headquarters in Tokyo and local parishes publish brochures for the faithful looking for further religious education. Liturgy The Orthodox Church in Japan celebrates its liturgy in Japanese, and occasionally in other languages such as Church Slavonic or Greek. As many liturgical and Biblical texts were first translated into Japanese by Archbishop Nicolas and Nakai Tsugumaro, a Japanese Christian scholar of literary Chinese, their Japanese today reads archaically. The liturgical style found in the community of the Orthodox Church in Japan remains influenced by that of the Church in late 19th-century Russia.

It was originally called the Dornier F before being renamed by the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM) in 1933, and was considered a heavy bomber at the time. It came into service in 1932, a continuation of a line of bomber designs from the Dornier Do P in 1930, and the Dornier Do Y in 1931. The line would continue to develop with the Dornier Do 13 and Dornier Do 23. Design and development One of the main features the Do 11 tested was a retractable undercarriage, but, due to problems with the gear, it was often left locked down. The aircraft entered service under the guise of a freight transport, and was used with the German airway in conjunction with Deutsche Luft Hansa, so that it could be shown publicly. What it was actually used for was as a trainer for the still secret Luftwaffe. The aircraft had a number of problems, which resulted in some crashes, and was generally unpopular with pilots. Especially problematic were wing vibrations which resulted in various precautions and modifications. Attempts were made to correct its faults, resulting in the so-called Do 11D, the last model with the Do 11 name. The Do 13 was a \\"simplified\\" Do 11 and came next, but had so many problems of its own that it did not fully enter service, with several of the first planes off the assembly line crashing. The later Do 23 corrected many faults of the design, but was still a lackluster aircraft, and was withdrawn from service by 1936, and replaced by superior aircraft that had since been developed. The Do 11 is noteworthy as having served in secret and having been the main heavy bomber of the quietly developing Luftwaffe, if only for a short while. It was also the first to have two large engines as opposed to its predecessors the Y and P, which used three and four engines respectively.

Several other stylites later followed his model (the Greek word style means \\"pillar\\"). He is known formally as Simeon Stylites the Elder to distinguish him from Simeon Stylites the Younger, Simeon Stylites III, and Symeon Stylites of Lesbos. Early life Simeon was the son of a shepherd. He was born in Sis, now the Turkish town of Kozan in Adana Province. Sis was in the Roman province of Cilicia. After the division of the Roman Empire in 395 A.D., Cilicia became part of the Eastern Roman Empire. Christianity took hold quickly there. According to Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrrhus, Simeon developed a zeal for Christianity at the age of 13, following a reading of the Beatitudes. He entered a monastery before the age of 16. From the first, he gave himself up to the practice of an austerity so extreme and to all appearance so extravagant, that his brethren judged him to be unsuited to any form of community life.Thurston, Herbert. \\"St. Simeon Stylites the Elder.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 21 Jan. 2014 They asked Simeon to leave the monastery. He shut himself up in a hut for one and a half years, where he passed the whole of Lent without eating or drinking. When he emerged from the hut, his achievement was hailed as a miracle.Lent, Frederick. The Life of St. Simeon Stylites He later took to standing continually upright so long as his limbs would sustain him. After one and a half years in his hut, Simeon sought a rocky eminence on the slopes of what is now the Sheik Barakat Mountain, part of Mount Simeon. He chose to live within a narrow space, less than 20 meters in diameter. But crowds of pilgrims invaded the area to seek him out, asking his counsel or his prayers, and leaving him insufficient time for his own devotions. This eventually led him to adopt a new way of life. Atop the pillar 16th-century icon of Simeon Stylites. At the base of the pillar is his mother's body. (Historic Museum in Sanok, Poland) In order to get away from the ever-increasing number of people who came to him for prayers and advice, leaving him little if any time for his private austerities, Simeon discovered a pillar which had survived among ruins in nearby Telanissa (modern-day Taladah in Syria), and formed a small platform at the top. He determined to live out his life on this platform. For sustenance small boys from the nearby village would climb up the pillar and pass him parcels of flat bread and goats' milk. He may also have pulled up food in buckets via a pulley. When the monastic Elders living in the desert heard about Simeon, who had chosen a new and strange form of asceticism, they wanted to test him to determine whether his extreme feats were founded in humility or pride. They decided to order Simeon under obedience to come down from the pillar. They decided that if he disobeyed, they would forcibly drag him to the ground, but if he was willing to submit, they were to leave him on his pillar. Simeon displayed complete obedience and humility, and the monks told him to stay where he was. The first pillar that Simeon occupied was little more than 3 meters (10 ft). He later moved his platform to others, the last in the series reportedly more than from the ground. At the top of the pillar was a platform, which is believed to have been about one square meter and surrounded by a baluster. Edward Gibbon in his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire describes Simeon's life as follows: > In this last and lofty station, the Syrian Anachoret resisted the heat of > thirty summers, and the cold of as many winters. Habit and exercise > instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation without fear or > giddiness, and successively to assume the different postures of devotion. He > sometimes prayed in an erect attitude, with his outstretched arms in the > figure of a cross, but his most familiar practice was that of bending his > meagre skeleton from the forehead to the feet; and a curious spectator, > after numbering twelve hundred and forty-four repetitions, at length > desisted from the endless account. The progress of an ulcer in his thigh > might shorten, but it could not disturb, this celestial life; and the > patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column.Edward Gibbon. > The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Volume 4. Chapter > XXXVII: \\"Conversion Of The Barbarians To Christianity.\\" Even on the highest of his columns, Simeon was not withdrawn from the world. If anything, the new pillar attracted even more people, both pilgrims who had earlier visited him and sightseers as well. Simeon was available each afternoon to talk with visitors. By means of a ladder, visitors were able to ascend within speaking distance. It is known that he wrote letters, the text of some of which have survived to this day, that he instructed disciples, and that he also lectured to those assembled beneath.Mann, Mimi. \\"Stump Is Reminder of Hermit Who Perched on Pillar for 42 Years\\", Los Angeles Times, October 21, 1990 He especially preached against profanity and usury. In contrast to the extreme austerity that he practised, his preaching conveyed temperance and compassion, and was marked with common sense and freedom from fanaticism. Much of Simeon's public ministry, like that of other Syrian ascetics, can be seen as socially cohesive in the context of the Roman East. In the face of the withdrawal of wealthy landowners to the large cities, holy men such as Simeon acted as impartial and necessary patrons and arbiters in disputes between peasant farmers and within the smaller towns.Peter Brown, \\"The Rise and Function of the Holy Man in Late Antiquity,\\" Journal of Roman Studies, 61 (1971) pp 80‚Äì101 Fame and final years Ruins of the Church of Saint Simeon with remains of his column (centre, now topped with a boulder) Reports of Simeon reached the church hierarchy and the imperial court. The Emperor Theodosius II and his wife Aelia Eudocia greatly respected the Simeon and listened to his counsels, while the Emperor Leo I paid respectful attention to a letter he sent in favour of the Council of Chalcedon. Simeon is also said to have corresponded with Genevieve of Paris. Patriarch Domninos II (441‚Äì448) of Antioch visited the monk, and celebrated the Divine Liturgy on the pillar.\\"St Simeon Stylites, the Elder\\", Orthodox Church in America Once when Simeon was ill, Theodosius sent three bishops to beg him to come down and allow himself to be attended by physicians. But Simeon preferred to leave his cure in the hands of God, and before long he recovered. A double wall was raised around him to keep the crowd of people from coming too close and disturbing his prayerful concentration. Women, in general, were not permitted beyond the wall, not even his own mother, reportedly telling her, \\"If we are worthy, we shall see one another in the life to come.\\" She submitted to this, remaining in the area, and embraced the monastic life of silence and prayer. When she died, Simeon asked that her coffin be brought to him. He reverently bade farewell to his dead mother. Simeon spent 37 years upon the pillar. He died on 2 September 459. A disciple found his body stooped over in prayer. The Patriarch of Antioch, Martyrios performed the funeral of the monk before a huge throng of clergy and people. They buried him not far from the pillar.\\"The Monk Simeon the Stylite\\", Holy Trinity Orthodox Church Unfortunately, on May 12, 2016 the pillar within the church took a hit from a missile. Legacy Simeon inspired many imitators. For the next century, ascetics living on pillars, stylites, were a common sight throughout the Christian Levant. He is commemorated as a saint in the Coptic Orthodox Church, where his feast is on 29 Pashons. He is commemorated 1 September by the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, and 5 January in the Roman Catholic Church. A contest arose between Antioch and Constantinople for the possession of Simeon's remains. The preference was given to Antioch, and the greater part of his relics were left there as a protection to the unwalled city. The ruins of the vast edifice erected in his honour and known in Arabic as the Qalaat Semaan (\\"the Fortress of Simeon\\") can still be seen. They are located about 30 km northwest of Aleppo () and consist of four basilicas built out from an octagonal court towards the four points of the compass to form a large cross. In the centre of the court stands the base of the style or column on which Simeon stood. It is possible that traditional sources for the life of Simeon Stylites misrepresent his relation to Chalcedonian Christianity. Syriac letters in the British Museum attributed to Simeon Stylites indicate that he was a Miaphysite and opposed the result of the Chalcedonian council (Council of Chalcedon AD 451).Torrey, Charles C. \\"Simeon Stylites, Letters,\\" Journal of the American Oriental Society 20 (1899) pp.253-276.

As such, the district encompasses the transition between the built and natural environments in Melbourne's east and promotes itself as a \\"balance of city and country\\". Formerly the City of Doncaster & Templestowe, the district was originally part of the Wurundjeri nation's territory. Most of the first European settlers to the area were orchardists, arriving through the 1850s. Gold was first discovered in Victoria around the same time at Andersons Creek, in Warrandyte, however, the district saw varied growth as periods of low density suburban development occurred sporadically throughout the mid-late 20th century. History The Manningham municipality was created on 15 December 1994, as part of a general restructure of Melbourne's local government boundaries. The new municipality contains the former City of Doncaster & Templestowe, but with part of Ringwood North ceded to the new City of Maroondah and Wonga Park, annexed from the former Shire of Lillydale. The name Bulleen, a nearby suburb, was proposed for the new municipality, as it was the name of the shire predating the City of Doncaster and Templestowe. However, modern residents believed the name was too localised, so the name of one of the major roads was adopted. The origin of Manningham Road comes from the region of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. Residents' requests for the City to be named after Indigenous Australian names local to the area such as Mullum Mullum or Koonung were rejected.

A Doncaster railway line had been planned for many decades; however the land was sold off in the 1980s. Residents have long campaigned for extension of the route 48 tram along Doncaster Road to Doncaster, Doncaster East or Donvale, although this is heavily supported by Local Governments, the issue is consistently avoided by State Government. There are increased bus services to cope with the demand for public transport, all mainly operated by Transdev Melbourne and only two bus routes are exclusive to Manningham that circle the area clockwise and counterclockwise to service destinations within the City Council.

It also features a few studio tracks, including a new single (\\"Doctor Worm\\"). The live cuts, some recorded at soundchecks without any audience, feature at least one track from every album since their debut, which include a few old fan favorites that have been reworked since the duo adopted a full backing band. Songs like \\"She's an Angel\\", from their debut, They Might Be Giants and \\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\\", from their major label debut, Flood, are treated to multiple guitars and a horn section. Conversely, the song \\"Meet James Ensor\\" originally appeared on their first full band effort, John Henry (1994) and surfaces here in a bare-bones rendition, with only vocals and an accordion. Besides the aforementioned lack of an audience on several tracks, some tracks have also undergone studio \\"retooling\\" - most notably, \\"Ana Ng,\\" which appeared in its untampered form (with an uncropped intro and without a heavily distorted voice saying, \\"I don't want the world...\\") on the 1994 promo-only release \\"Live!! New York City.\\" A condensed version of this album was released as Live, which featured 10 of the 24 tracks listed here. Song notes * Tracks 1, 2, and 17 were recorded in a studio rather than onstage; track 15 was recorded in a hotel room. * Tracks 18-24 are hidden songs that were improvised in concert, based on the Planet of the Apes movie series. * \\"First Kiss\\" was later reworked and put on the 2001 album Mink Car as \\"Another First Kiss\\", with the same basic melody and similar lyrics but a substantially different style and tempo. * Similarly, \\"They Got Lost\\" was later recorded in the studio at a slower tempo, and was released on Long Tall Weekend as well as later being the title track on the rarities compilation album They Got Lost. * On Track 3, \\"They Get Lost\\", the band is introduced incorrectly as \\"They Must Be Giants\\", which is a tongue-in-cheek reference to an untitled, partial recording that appears as track 13 on both Don't Let's Start and its re- release Miscellaneous T. It was inadvertently left on the Dial-A-Song answering machine, in which a confused listener named Gloria talks to an unknown third party about the mystery of \\"There May Be Giants\\" and \\"There Must Be Giants\\", as she mistakenly refers to the band. It would later be referenced when Bryant Gumbel referred to them as \\"They Must Be Giants\\" when they performed \\"Your Racist Friend\\" on Today to promote the release of Flood. Song origins * Studio version of track 4 originally appeared on the Why Does The Sun Shine?

Paleoecology of the Llano Estacado, Vol. 1, Santa Fe: NM, The Museum of New Mexico Press, Fort Burgwin Research Center Publication Naming The Spanish name is often interpreted in English as \\"Staked Plains\\", but is more accurately rendered as \\"stockaded\\" or \\"palisaded plains\\". The name probably derives from the steep escarpments on the eastern, northern, and western periphery of the plains. Francisco Coronado and other European explorers described the Mescalero Ridge on the western boundary as resembling \\"palisades, ramparts, or stockades\\" of a fort. Other sources refer vaguely to \\"stakes\\" used to mark routes on the featureless plain, often meaning piles of stone, bone, and cow dung. Art Leatherwood comments in the Handbook of Texas that such way markers could plausibly explain the origin of the name, but that the \\"comparison of cliff formations and palisades made repeatedly by explorers argues more convincingly for the geological origin\\". Darwin Spearing writes in Roadside Geology of Texas: Geography and climate The northern edge of the Llano Estacado in New Mexico The Llano Estacado lies at the southern end of the Western High Plains ecoregion of the Great Plains of North America; it is part of what was once called the Great American Desert. The Canadian River forms the Llano's northern boundary, separating it from the rest of the High Plains. To the east, the Caprock Escarpment, a precipitous cliff about high, lies between the Llano and the red Permian plains of Texas; while to the west, the Mescalero Escarpment demarcates the eastern edge of the Pecos River valley. The Llano has no natural southern boundary, instead blending into the Edwards Plateau near Big Spring, Texas. This geographic area stretches about north to south, and east to west, a total area of some , larger than Indiana and 12 other states. It covers all or part of 33 Texas counties and four New Mexico counties. Some years, a National Weather Service dust storm warning is issued in parts of Texas due to a dust storm originating from the area or from the adjacent lower part of the Southwestern Tablelands ecological region.Dust storm#Dust storm visibility of 1.2F4 mile or less.2C or meters or less The landscape is dotted by numerous small playa lakes, depressions that seasonally fill with water and provide habitat for waterfowl. The Llano Estacado has a \\"cold semiarid\\" climate (K√∂ppen BSk), characterized by long, hot summers and cold winters. Rainfall is relatively low; the entire region receives fewer than of rainfall annually, and the western part receives as little as . High summer temperatures (average July temperature above 90 ¬∞F or 32 ¬∞C) mean most of the small amount of precipitation is lost to evaporation, making dryland farming difficult.

History Spanish conquistador Francisco Coronado, the first European to traverse this \\"sea of grass\\" in 1541, described it as follows: > I reached some plains so vast, that I did not find their limit anywhere I > went, although I traveled over them for more than 300 leagues ... with no > more land marks than if we had been swallowed up by the sea ... there was > not a stone, nor bit of rising ground, nor a tree, nor a shrub, nor anything > to go by.300 Spanish leagues ‚âà In the early 18th century, the Comanches expanded their territory into the Llano Estacado, displacing the Apaches who had previously lived there. The region became part of the Comancheria, a Comanche stronghold until the final defeat of the tribe in the late 19th century. Online at Google Books The Comanche war trail extended from Llano Estacado to the Rio Grande into Chihuahua, \\"the trail ran southwesterly through Big Spring to the Horsehead Crossing of the Pecos River, then forked southward to the Comanche Springs where it divided, one part of the trail crossing the great river near Boquillas and the other at Presidio.\\"Ford, J.S., 1963, Rip Ford's Texas.

Carter described it in 1871 while pursuing Quanah Parker with Ranald S. Mackenzie, \\"... all were over and out of the canyon upon what appeared to be a vast, almost illimitable expanse of prairie. As far as the eye could reach, not a bush or tree, a twig or stone, not an object of any kind or a living thing, was in sight.

There was only two trails across in them days an' I reckon no more now. Only the Indians know this plain well an' they only run in heah to hide awhile. Water an' grass are plentiful in some parts, an' then there's stretches of seventy miles dry an' bare as a bone.\\" In the latter part of the 19th century, the Llano was a refuge for the bands of Kiowas and Comanches who did not wish to be confined to reservations in Indian Territory, in present- day Oklahoma. One of their last battles against the US Army was fought on 28 September 1874 in the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon. Charles Goodnight described what it takes to be a scout: \\"... the trained ear should be able to tell the sound, whether it was made by man or beast or bird ... as a human voice echoes more than all others ... of course, on the Staked Plains we have not this advantage as there is nothing to create an echo.\\"Goodnight, C., The Making of a Scout, manuscript, Panhandle Plains Historical Museum, Canyon, Texas Today, most of the area's population is localized in the principal cities of Amarillo, Lubbock, Midland and Odessa, Texas. The vast majority of the area is rural, covered by large ranches and irrigated farms. Several small- to medium- sized towns do exist, however, including Andrews, Hereford, Plainview, Levelland, and Lamesa, Texas, and Clovis, Portales, and Hobbs, New Mexico. The Llano Estacado is slightly larger in area than the state of Indiana. The southern extension of the High Plains, the region is some 250 miles north to south and 200 miles east to west. The roads are straight and meet mostly at right angles. Cotton is an essential crop with irrigation, but faces declining prices at times on the world market. The Llano Estacado is sometimes humorously described as \\"85 percent sky and 15 percent grassland.\\"Stephen D.

Lubbock, known for a wide variety of denominations, also holds the distinction of being the most populous city on the High Plains from the Dakotas through Texas. Prohibition did not end on the Texas Plains in 1933 with repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but continued for years at the county level.

The Ogallala Aquifer is the main freshwater source for the region and consists of braided stream deposits filling in valleys during humid climatic conditions, followed by a sub-humid to arid climate and thick eolian (wind-blown) sand and silt. Caliche layers cap the Ogallala, which reflect today's arid conditions. Pleistocene rainfall over the flat terrain caused water to pond at the surface, resulting in a High Plains characteristic, innumerable round ponds called playa lakes.

Oil and gas production is also prevalent on the Llano Estacado. Overuse of the aquifer in the past has persuaded some farmers to return to dryland crops, leading to less rainwater reaching the playas.Playa Lakes United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Editions have been co-written by the creator of Perl, Larry Wall, along with Randal L. Schwartz, then Tom Christiansen and then Jon Orwant. Published by O'Reilly Media, the book is considered the canonical reference work for Perl programmers. With over 1,000 pages, the various editions contain complete descriptions of each Perl language version and its interpreter. Examples range from trivial code snippets to the highly complex expressions for which Perl is widely known. The camel book editions are also noted for being written in an approachable and humorous style. History The first edition, which gained the nickname \\"the pink camel\\" due to its pink spine, was originally published in January 1991 and covered version 4 of the Perl language. It was the work of Larry Wall and Randal L. Schwartz. By the time the second edition of the book was published, in August 1996, Perl had changed significantly: it now included references, objects, packages and other modern programming constructs. In response to these changes, the two original authors, joined by Tom Christiansen, rewrote the book from scratch. In July 2000, the third edition of Programming Perl was published. This version was again rewritten, this time by Wall, Christiansen and Jon Orwant, and covered the Perl 5.6 language. The fourth edition constitutes a major update and rewrite of the book for Perl version 5.14, and improves the coverage of Unicode usage in Perl. The fourth edition was published in February 2012. This edition is written by Tom Christiansen, brian d foy, Larry Wall and Jon Orwant. Programming Perl has also been made available electronically by O'Reilly, both through its inclusion in various editions of The Perl CD Bookshelf and through the \\"Safari\\" service (a subscription-based website containing technical ebooks). The publisher offers online a free sample of Chapter 18 of the third edition and the Chapter 1 of the fourth edition as well as the complete set of code examples in the book (third edition) .

It is found throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific, frequenting coral reefs and sandy flats to a depth of . Adult zebra sharks are distinctive in appearance, with five longitudinal ridges on a cylindrical body, a low caudal fin comprising nearly half the total length, and usually a pattern of dark spots on a pale background. Young zebra sharks under long have a completely different pattern, consisting of light vertical stripes on a brown background, and lack the ridges. This species attains a length of . Zebra sharks are nocturnal and spend most of the day resting motionless on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. The zebra shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling. Taxonomy Early taxonomists thought that juvenile zebra sharks were a different species because of their different appearance from adults. The zebra shark was first described as Squalus varius by Seba in 1758 (Seba died years earlier; the publication was posthumous). No type specimen was designated, though Seba included a comprehensive description in Latin and an accurate illustration of a juvenile. M√ºller and Henle placed this species in the genus Stegostoma in 1837, using the specific epithet fasciatus (or the neuter form fasciatum, as Stegostoma is neuter while Squalus is masculine) from an 1801 work by Bloch and Schneider. In 1984, Compagno rejected the name \\"varius/m\\" in favor of \\"fasciatus/m\\" for the zebra shark, because Seba did not consistently use binomial nomenclature in his species descriptions (though Squalus varius is one that can be construed as a binomial name). In Compagno's view, the first proper usage of \\"varius/m\\" was by Garman in 1913, making it a junior synonym.Martin, R.A. (January 31, 1999). Albino Zebras and Leopards Changing Their Spots. ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on May 12, 2009. Both S. fasciatum and S. varium are currently in usage for this species; until the early 1990s most authorities used the latter name, but since then most have followed Compagno and used the former name. A taxonomic review in 2019 instead argued that S. tigrinum is its valid name. This name was omitted in Compagno's review in 1984, possibly due to confusion over its year of description (in a publication in 1941, Fowler mistakenly listed it as being described in 1795). Squalus tigrinus was described by Forster in 1781, two years before Squalus fasciatus was described by Hermann. Consequently, the former and older is the valid name (as Stegostoma tigrinum), while the latter and younger is its junior synonym. As the name proposed by Forster in 1781 has been used in tens of publications since 1899, it is not a nomen oblitum. The genus name is derived from the Greek stego meaning \\"covered\\", and stoma meaning \\"mouth\\".Bester, C. Biological Profiles: Zebra Shark. Florida Museum of Natural History Ichthyology Department. Retrieved on May 12, 2009. The specific epithet fasciatum means \\"banded\\", referring to the striped pattern of the juvenile. The juvenile coloration is also the origin of the common name \\"zebra shark\\". The name \\"leopard shark\\" is sometimes applied to the spotted adult, but that name usually refers to the houndshark Triakis semifasciata, and is also sometimes used for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier). Due to their different color patterns and body proportions, both juveniles and subadults have historically been described as separate species (Squalus tigrinus and S. longicaudatus respectively). Phylogeny There is robust morphological support for the placement of the zebra shark, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), and the nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum, Nebrius ferrugineus, and Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum) in a single clade. However, the interrelationships between these taxa are disputed by various authors. Dingerkus (1986) suggested that the whale shark is the closest relative of the zebra shark, and proposed a single family encompassing all five species in the clade. Compagno (1988) suggested affinity between this species and either Pseudoginglymostoma or a clade containing Rhincodon, Ginglymostoma, and Nebrius. Goto (2001) placed the zebra shark as the sister group to a clade containing Rhincodon and Ginglymostoma. Description Close-up of zebra shark The zebra shark has a cylindrical body with a large, slightly flattened head and a short, blunt snout. The eyes are small and placed on the sides of the head; the spiracles are located behind them and are as large or larger. The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases, and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others. Each nostril has a short barbel and a groove running from it to the mouth. The mouth is nearly straight, with three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners. There are 28-33 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 22-32 tooth rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones. There are five distinctive ridges running along the body in adults, one along the dorsal midline and two on the sides. The dorsal midline ridge merges into the first dorsal fin, placed about halfway along the body and twice the size of the second dorsal fin. The pectoral fins are large and broad; the pelvic and anal fins are much smaller but larger than the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin is almost as long as the rest of the body, with a barely developed lower lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The zebra shark attains a length of , with an unsubstantiated record of . Males and females are not dimorphic in size. The color pattern in young sharks is dark brown above and light yellow below, with vertical yellow stripes and spots. As the shark grows to long, the dark areas begin to break up, changing the general pattern from light-on-dark stripes to dark-on-light spots. There is substantial variation in pattern amongst adults, which can be used to identify particular individuals. A rare morph, informally called the sandy zebra shark, is overall sandy‚Äìbrown in color with inconspicuous dark brown freckles on its upperside, lacking the distinct dark-spotted and banded pattern typical of the species. The appearance of juveniles of this morph is unknown, but subadults that are transitioning into adult sandy zebra sharks have a brown-netted pattern. Faint remnants of this pattern can often be seen in adult sandy zebra sharks. This morph, which is genetically inseparable from the normal morph, is only known from the vicinity of Malindi in Kenya, although seemingly similar individuals have been reported from Japan and northwestern Australia. In 1964, a partially albino zebra shark was discovered in the Indian Ocean. It was overall white and completely lacked spots, but its eyes were blackish-brown as typical of the species and unlike full albinos. The shark, a long mature female, was unusual in that albino animals rarely survive long in the wild due to their lack of crypsis. Distribution and habitat Zebra sharks are often seen resting on sand near coral. The zebra shark occurs in the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, from South Africa to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf (including Madagascar and the Maldives), to India and Southeast Asia (including Indonesia, the Philippines, and Palau), northward to Taiwan and Japan, eastward to New Caledonia and Tonga, and southward to northern Australia. Bottom-dwelling in nature, the zebra shark is found from the intertidal zone to a depth of over the continental and insular shelves. Adults and large juveniles frequent coral reefs, rubble, and sandy areas. There are unsubstantiated reports of this species from fresh water in the Philippines. Zebra sharks sometimes cross oceanic waters to reach isolated seamounts. Movements of up to have been recorded for individual sharks. However, genetic data indicates that there is little exchange between populations of zebra sharks, even if their ranges are contiguous. Biology and ecology During the day, zebra sharks are sluggish and usually found resting on the sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins to prop up the front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water.Martin, R.A. Coral Reefs: Zebra Shark. ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research. Retrieved on May 12, 2009. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails. The zebra shark feeds primarily on shelled molluscs, though it also takes crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey. This species is large and has no confirmed predators, but hatchlings may be preyed upon by larger fishes and marine mammals. Known parasites of the zebra shark include four species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium. Social life Zebra sharks are usually solitary, though aggregations of 20-50 individuals have been recorded. Off southeast Queensland, aggregations of several hundred zebra sharks form every summer in shallow water. These aggregations consist entirely of large adults, with females outnumbering males by almost three to one. The purpose of these aggregations is yet unclear; no definite mating behavior has been observed between the sharks. There is an observation of an adult male zebra shark biting the pectoral fin of another adult male and pushing him against the sea floor; the second male was turned on his back, and remained motionless for several minutes. This behavior resembles pre-copulatory behaviors between male and female sharks, and in both cases the biting and holding of the pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other. Life history Several egg cases of the zebra shark The courtship behavior of the zebra shark consists of the male following the female and biting vigorously at her pectoral fins and tail, with periods in which he holds onto her pectoral fin and both sharks lie still on the bottom. On occasion this leads to mating, in which the male curls his body around the female and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts for two to five minutes. The zebra shark is oviparous, with females laying large egg capsules measuring long, wide, and thick. The egg case is dark brown to purple in color, and has hair-like fibers along the sides that secure it to the substrate. The adhesive fibers emerge first from the female's vent; the female circles vertical structures such as reef outcroppings to entangle the fibers, so as to anchor the eggs. Females have been documented laying up to 46 eggs over a 112-day period. Eggs are deposited in batches of around four. Reproductive seasonality in the wild is unknown.Dudgeon, C.L., Simpfendorfer, C. & Pillans, R.D. (2019). Stegostoma fasciatum (amended version of 2016 assessment). The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. A juvenile zebra shark with a color pattern intermediate between that of young and adults In captivity, the eggs hatch after four to six months, depending on temperature. The hatchlings measure long and have proportionately longer tails than adults. The habitat preferences of juveniles are unclear; one report places them at depths greater than , while another report from India suggests they inhabit shallower water than adults. The stripes of the juveniles may have an anti- predator function, making each individual in a group harder to target. Males attain sexual maturity at long, and females at long. Their lifespan has been estimated to be 25-30 years in the wild. There have been two reports of female zebra sharks producing young asexually.\\"Zebra shark at centre of 'virgin birth' mystery\\" (January 5, 2012). BBC News. Retrieved on January 5, 2012. An additional study has observed parthenogenesis in females regardless of sexual history. Human interactions Docile and slow-moving, zebra sharks are not dangerous to humans and can be easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many zebra sharks at diving sites have become accustomed to the presence of humans, taking food from divers' hands and allowing themselves to be touched. The zebra shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world. The small, attractively colored young also find their way into the hands of private hobbyists, though this species grows far too large for the home aquarium. The zebra shark is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range, using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption. Furthermore, the liver oil is used for vitamins, the fins for shark fin soup, and the offal for fishmeal. Zebra sharks are highly susceptible to localized depletion due to their shallow habitat and low levels of dispersal between populations, and market surveys suggest that they are much less common now than in the past. They are also threatened by the degradation of their coral reef habitat by human development, and by destructive fishing practices such as dynamiting or poisoning. As a result, the World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered. Off Australia, the only threat to this species is a very low level of bycatch in prawn trawls, and there it has been assessed as of Least Concern.

The first edition (1993) was authored solely by Randal L. Schwartz, and covered Perl 4. All subsequent editions have covered Perl 5. The second (1997) edition was coauthored with Tom Christiansen and the third (2001) edition was coauthored with Tom Phoenix. The fourth (2005), fifth (2008), sixth (2011), and seventh (2016) editions were written by Schwartz, Phoenix, and brian d foy. According to the 5th edition of the book, previous editions have sold more than 500,000 copies.Learning Perl, 5th ed., p. 1 Unlike Programming Perl, this book is aimed at computer programmers new to Perl. The publisher offers a complete set of code examples presented in the 3rd Edition book. Schwartz selected the world of The Flintstones for the examples in this book, giving rise to the somewhat frequent use of Fred and Barney as metasyntactic variables, rather than the classic foo and bar.  Reactions  Brad Morrey, reviewing the book for InfoWorld, praises the book for its \\"casual, first person style\\" and concludes that it \\"is a terrific introduction to the language that will serve as a good reference book once you have read it through.\\" In his Linux Journal review of Perl in a Nutshell, Jan Rooijackers recommends that \\"If you are totally new to programming and you want to learn Perl, the book Learning Perl ... might be a better place to start.\\" Discussing Schwartz' conviction, the New York Times noted that \\"Much of the Internet's World Wide Web has been built by programmers who got their start by reading his \\"Programming Perl\\" and \\"Learning Perl\\" books.\\" Also reflecting in that case in Principles of Information Systems Security, Gurpreet Dhillon calls Learning Perl, \\"the definitive Perl instruction guide.\\" In Perl Medic, author Peter Scott calls the book \\"the most common tutorial for learning Perl\\", but then criticizes its omission of hard references.  Later works  In 2003, Schwartz published a follow-up to Learning Perl titled Learning Perl Objects, References & Modules. It picks up where Learning Perl left off. In 2005, Learning Perl Objects, References & Modules was updated by Schwartz and brian d foy and re-titled Intermediate Perl which is now in its second edition as of 2012. Mastering Perl, the third book in the trilogy and follow-up to Intermediate Perl, was first published in July 2007 and is also in a second edition as of 2014.

Molecular phylogenetic studies showed that the genus was not monophyletic, and in 2013, Maarten Christenhusz proposed the merger of Abelia (excluding section Zabelia) into Linnaea, along with some other genera. Abelia section Zabelia was raised to the genus Zabelia. Description Species formerly placed in Abelia are shrubs from 1‚Äì6 m tall, native to eastern Asia (Japan west to the Himalaya) and southern North America (Mexico); the species from warm climates are evergreen, and colder climate species deciduous. The leaves are opposite or in whorls of three, ovate, glossy, dark green, 1.5‚Äì8 cm long, turning purplish-bronze to red in autumn in the deciduous species. The flowers appear in the upper leaf axils and stem ends, 1-8 together in a short cyme; they are pendulous, white to pink, bell-shaped with a five-lobed corolla, 1‚Äì5 cm long, and usually scented. Flowering continues over a long and continuous period from late spring to fall. Some of these species are cultivated as ornamental garden plants, and may still be described as Abelia in horticultural listings. A notable example is the hybrid Abelia √ó grandiflora (now Linnaea √ó grandiflora). Taxonomy The generic name commemorates Clarke Abel, a keen naturalist who accompanied Lord Amherst's unsuccessful embassy to China in 1816 as surgeon, under the sponsorship of Sir Joseph Banks. All of Abel's seeds and plants were lost in a shipwreck on the homeward voyage, however; living plants of Abelia chinensis (now Linnaea chinensis) were first imported to England in 1844 by Robert Fortune.Alice M. Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their Histories (1964), 1992, s.v. \\"Abelia\\". Some species placed in Abelia were transferred to Linnaea at various times from 1872 onwards, but these transfers were not accepted by most botanists. Molecular phylogenetic studies showed that a number of genera traditionally placed in the tribe Linnaeeae were closely related, but that Abelia was not monophyletic, even with Abelia section Zabelia split off as a separate genus Zabelia. In 2013, Maarten Christenhusz proposed that Abelia and related genera be merged into Linnaea. This proposal has been adopted by recent sources, including the Plants of the World Online. Allergenicity Abelia has an OPALS allergy scale rating of 5, indicating moderate potential to cause allergic reactions, exacerbated by over-use of the same plant throughout a garden. People allergic to honeysuckle may experience cross-reactive allergic reactions with Abelia.

Green. Credit: Wellcome Collection John Bird (1709‚Äì1776) was a British mathematical instrument maker. He was born at Bishop Auckland. He came to London in 1740 where he worked for Jonathan Sisson and George Graham.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol III, (1847) London, Charles Knight, p.327. By 1745 he had his own business in the Strand. Bird was commissioned to make a brass quadrant 8 feet across for the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, where it was mounted on 16 February 1750, and where it is still preserved. Soon after, duplicates were ordered for France, Spain and Russia. Mural quadrant constructed as a frame mounted on a wall. This instrument was made by Bird in 1773 and is in the History of Science Museum, Oxford. Bird supplied the astronomer James Bradley with further instruments of such quality that the commissioners of longitude paid him ¬£500 (a huge sum) on condition that he take on an apprentice for 7 years and produce in writing upon oath, a full account of his working methods. This was the origin of Bird's two treatises The Method of Dividing Mathematical Instruments (1767) and The Method of Constructing Mural Quadrants (1768). Both had a foreword from the astronomer-royal Nevil Maskelyne. When the Houses of Parliament burned down in 1834, the standard yards of 1758 and 1760, both constructed by Bird, were destroyed. Bird, with his fellow County Durham savant William Emerson, makes an appearance in Mason & Dixon, the acclaimed novel by Thomas Pynchon.

As opposed to the Socialist Party of Canada, the SDP allowed minority language groups ample room for self-determination, which led to a perception that the ethnic groups were more dominant than the overarching SDP.

The British Columbia‚Äìbased SDP put forward a more moderate, evolutionary socialist position, and had a more positive view of the trade union movement than its rival. The party won seats in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the early part of the century, and also won seats in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1915 and 1920. The SDP's official platform, as put forth in their newspaper Canadian Forward: > As a means of preparing the minds of the working class for the inauguration > of the Co-operative commonwealth, the Social-Democratic Party of Canada will > support any measure that will tend to better conditions under capitalism, > such as: > (1) Reduction of hours of labor. > (2) The elimination of child labor. > (3) Universal adult suffrage without distinction of sex or regard to > property qualifications. > (4) The Initiative, Referendum, and right of Recall. It was perceived as being a radical leftist group by the federal government, especially during the First World War. The Canadian Director of Public Safety identified them as the publisher of the largest amount of anti-war propaganda during the First World War. Isaac Bainbridge, the editor of the Canadian Forward and Dominion Secretary of the SDP, was imprisoned on numerous occasions for this 'seditious material'. In 1918, the SDP was briefly outlawed by an Order-in-Council of the Borden administration, although this was quickly rectified shortly thereafter. However, its newspaper _Canadian Forward_ was outlawed permanently. This persecution helped to contribute to the downfall of the SDP. The SDP joined the Federated Labour Party of Canada in 1920, and its successors such as the Independent Labour Party. Many former members of the SDP joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation when it was formed in 1932.

Gameplay The gameplay of Discs of Tron is based on several scenes in the Tron film, combining the Jai Alai-like combat between Flynn and Crom with the disc combat between Tron and Sark. The player controls Tron in a one-on-one battle with Sark, presented in a fixed three-dimensional view behind Tron. Using a control scheme similar to that of the original Tron arcade game, the player moves around with a joystick, throws discs using a trigger button, and can defend him/herself with a thumb button. The player uses a rotary dial to move a targeting reticle all around the arena walls, and in later levels the player can also adjust his/her aim up and down by pulling up and pushing down on the knob. Each match takes place in a closed arena on top of platforms made of concentric disks, like in the Jai Alai sequence. Tron and Sark attempt to destroy each other by either directly hitting his opponent or causing him to fall off his platform. Tron and Sark can each throw up to three discs at a time. Assuming it isn't destroyed, each disc returns automatically to the player (destroyed discs regenerate). Tron can defend himself by hitting Sark's discs with his own or by using a deflector, of which he has a limited supply. Sark can additionally attack Tron with high-speed missiles, chaser orbs, and \\"super chasers\\" (which consist of an orb and two orbiting disks), which cannot be deflected. In later levels, platforms begin to move up and down vertically, requiring the player to aim up and down as well. Tron and Sark can bounce discs off the ceiling (similar to the energy ball in the Jai Alai sequence) with the goal of hitting one of his opponent's platforms - if successful, the platform flashes briefly and then disappears, reducing the character's movement or possibly causing him to fall and derez. The platform reappears after about ten seconds. For some levels, a continuously scrolling wall of blocks appears between Tron and Sark; these blocks must be destroyed to open gaps in the wall before either character can hit the other. The game has a total of twelve levels, with Sark becoming more aggressive throughout the game. Once the twelfth level is completed, levels repeat from six to twelve until the player runs out of lives. Release This game was released just before the video game crash of 1983, and was later ported to the Commodore 64. In 2004, it was released again in the Game Boy Advance game Tron 2.0. On February 13, 2008, Disney Interactive released an updated port on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360. Reception In 1996, Next Generation listed the arcade version as number 87 on their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\". Calling it \\"One of the first games to attempt a 3D environment\\", they remarked that the fast-paced and complex gameplay works due to the responsive controls. They also praised the enemy AI as advanced for its time, though they complained that a head-to-head multiplayer mode was an obvious feature that had not been included. In the competitive arena According to Twin Galaxies, David Bagenski, of Syracuse, New York, United States, scored a world record 418,200 points on June 28, 1986 during the 1986 Video Game Masters Tournament.

Fallujah dates from Babylonian times and was host to important Jewish academies for many centuries. The city grew from a small town in 1947 to a population of 275,128 inhabitants in 2011. Within Iraq, it is known as the \\"city of mosques\\" for the more than 200 mosques found in the city and the surrounding villages. In January 2014, the city was captured by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS; sometimes called ISIL) and suffered major population loss. On 23 May 2016, Iraqi forces announced the beginning of their attempt to retake Fallujah from ISIS. On 26 June 2016 the city was declared fully liberated by the Iraqi army. History The region has been inhabited for many millennia. There is evidence that the area surrounding Fallujah was inhabited in Babylonian times. The current name of the city is thought to come from its Syriac name, Pallgutha, which is derived from the word division or \\"canal regulator\\" since it was the location where the water of the Euphrates River divided into a canal. Classical authors cited the name as \\"Pallacottas\\". The name in Aramaic is Pumbedita. Al Anbar and Nehardea The region of Fallujah lies near the ancient Sassanid Persian town of Anbar, in the Sassanid province of As≈çristƒÅn . The word anbar is Persian and means \\"warehouse\\". It was known as Firuz Shapur or Perisapora during the Sassanian Era. There are extensive ruins north of Fallujah which are identified with the town of Anbar. Anbar was located at the confluence of the Euphrates River with the King's Canal, today the Saqlawiyah Canal, known in early Islamic times as the Nahr Isa and in ancient times as the Nahr Malka. Subsequent shifts in the Euphrates River channel have caused it to follow the course of the ancient Pallacottas canal. The town at this site in Jewish sources was known as Nehardea and was the primary center of Babylonian Jewry until its destruction by the Palmyran ruler Odenathus in 259. The Medieval Jewish traveller Benjamin of Tudela in 1164 visited \\"el-Anbar which is Pumbeditha in Nehardea\\" and said it had 3,000 Jews living there. Pumbeditha The region played host for several centuries to one of the most important Jewish academies, the Pumbedita Academy, which from 258 to 1038 along with Sura (ar-Hira) was one of the two most important centers of Jewish learning worldwide. Modern era Fallujah's Caravanserai, ca. 1914 Under the Ottoman Empire, Fallujah was a minor stop on one of the country's main roads across the desert west from Baghdad. In the spring of 1920, the British, who had gained control of Iraq after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, sent Lieut.-Colonel Gerard Leachman, a renowned explorer and a senior colonial officer, to meet with local leader Shaykh Dhari, perhaps to forgive a loan given to the sheikh. Exactly what happened depends on the source, but according to the Arab version, Gerard Leachman was betrayed by the sheikh who had his two sons shoot him in the legs, then behead him by the sword. During the brief Anglo-Iraqi War of 1941, the Iraqi Army was defeated by the British in a battle near Fallujah. In 1947 the town had only about 10,000 inhabitants. It grew rapidly into a city after Iraqi independence with the influx of oil wealth into the country. Its position on one of the main roads out of Baghdad made it of central importance. Under Saddam Hussein, who ruled Iraq from 1979 to 2003, Fallujah came to be an important area of support for the regime, along with the rest of the region labeled by the US military as the \\"Sunni Triangle\\". Many residents of the primarily Sunni city were employees and supporters of Saddam's government, and many senior Ba'ath Party officials were natives of the city. Fallujah was heavily industrialised during the Saddam era, with the construction of several large factories, including one closed down by United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in the 1990s that may have been used to create chemical weapons. A new highway system (a part of Saddam's infrastructure initiatives) circumvented Fallujah and gradually caused the city to decline in national importance by the time of the Iraq War. =Gulf War, 1991= During the Gulf War, Fallujah suffered one of the highest tolls of civilian casualties. Two separate failed bombing attempts on Fallujah's bridge across the Euphrates River hit crowded markets, killing an estimated two hundred civilians. The first bombing occurred early in the Gulf War. A British jet intending to bomb the bridge dropped two laser-guided bombs on the city's main market. Between 50 and 150 civilians died and many more were injured. In the second incident, Coalition forces attacked Fallujah's bridge over the Euphrates with four laser-guided bombs. At least one struck the bridge while one or two bombs fell short in the river. The fourth bomb hit another market elsewhere in the city, reportedly due to failure of its laser guidance system. =Iraq War= Fallujah as seen from the west, April 2004 Fallujah was one of the least affected areas of Iraq immediately after the 2003 invasion by the US-led Coalition. Iraqi Army units stationed in the area abandoned their positions and disappeared into the local population, leaving unsecured military equipment behind. Fallujah was also the site of a Ba'athist resort facility called \\"Dreamland\\", located a few kilometers outside the city proper. The damage the city had avoided during the initial invasion was negated by damage from looters, who took advantage of the collapse of Saddam Hussein's government. The looters targeted former government sites, the Dreamland compound, and the nearby military bases. Aggravating this situation was the proximity of Fallujah to the infamous Abu Ghraib prison, from which Saddam, in one of his last acts, had released all prisoners. The new mayor of the city‚ÄîTaha Bidaywi Hamed, selected by local tribal leaders‚Äîwas strongly pro-American. When the US Army entered the town in April 2003, they positioned themselves at the vacated Ba'ath Party headquarters. A Fallujah Protection Force composed of local Iraqis was set up by the US-led occupants to help fight the rising resistance. On the evening of 28 April 2003, a crowd of about two hundred people defied a curfew imposed by the Americans and gathered outside a secondary school used as a military HQ to demand its reopening. Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne stationed on the roof of the building fired upon the crowd, resulting in the deaths of 17 civilians and the wounding of over 70. American forces claim they were responding to gunfire from the crowd, while the Iraqis involved deny this version. Human Rights Watch also dispute the American claims, and says that the evidence suggests the US troops fired indiscriminately and used disproportionate force. A protest against the killings two days later was also fired upon by US troops, resulting in two more deaths. On 31 March 2004, Iraqi insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a convoy containing four American private military contractors from Blackwater USA, who were conducting delivery for food caterers ESS. The four armed contractors, Scott Helvenston, Jerry (Jerko) Zovko, Wesley Batalona, and Michael Teague, were dragged from their cars, beaten, and set on fire. Their charred corpses were then dragged through the streets before being hung from a bridge spanning the Euphrates River. This bridge is unofficially referred to as \\"Blackwater Bridge\\" by Coalition Forces operating there. Photographs of the event were released to news agencies worldwide, causing outrage in the United States, and prompting the announcement of a campaign to reestablish American control over the city. The aftermath of an air strike during the Second Battle of Fallujah A city street in Fallujah heavily damaged by the fighting, November 2004 This led to an abortive US operation to recapture control of the city in Operation Vigilant Resolve, and a successful recapture operation in the city in November 2004, called Operation Phantom Fury in English and Operation Al Fajr in Arabic. Operation Phantom Fury resulted in the reputed death of over 1,350 insurgent fighters. Approximately 95 American troops were killed, and 560 wounded. After the successful recapture of the city, U.S. forces discovered a room in which they claimed to find evidence of a beheading, and bomb-making factories, which were shown to the media as evidence of Fallujah's important role in the insurgency against U.S. forces. They also found two hostages‚Äîan Iraqi and a Syrian. The Syrian was the driver for two French journalists, Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, who had been missing since August 2004. The Iraqi's captors were Syrian; he thought he was in Syria until found by the Marines. Chesnot and Malbrunot were released by their captors, the Islamic Army in Iraq, on 21 December 2004. The U.S. military first denied that it has used white phosphorus as an anti-personnel weapon in Fallujah, but later retracted that denial, and admitted to using the incendiary in the city as an offensive weapon. According to George Monbiot, reports following the events of November 2004 have alleged war crimes, human rights abuses, and a massacre by U.S. personnel.George Monbiot, \\"Behind the phosphorus clouds are war crimes within war crimes\\", The Guardian, 22 November 2005 This point of view is presented in the 2005 documentary film, Fallujah, The Hidden Massacre. On 17 May 2011, AFP reported that twenty-one bodies, in black body-bags marked with letters and numbers in Latin script had been recovered from a mass grave in al-Maadhidi cemetery in the center of the city. Fallujah police chief Brigadier General Mahmud al-Essawi said that they had been blindfolded, their legs had been tied and they had suffered gunshot wounds. The Mayor, Adnan Husseini said that the manner of their killing, as well as the body bags, indicated that US forces had been responsible. Both al-Essawi and Husseini agreed that the dead had been killed in 2004. The US military declined to comment. Residents were allowed to return to the city in mid-December 2004 after undergoing biometric identification, provided they wear their ID cards all the time. US officials report that \\"more than half of Fallujah's 39,000 homes were damaged during Operation Phantom Fury, and about ten thousand of those were destroyed\\" while compensation amounts to twenty percent of the value of damaged houses, with an estimated 32,000 homeowners eligible, according to Marine Lt Col William Brown. According to NBC, 9,000 homes were destroyed, thousands more were damaged and of the 32,000 compensation claims only 2,500 have been paid as of 14 April 2005. According to Mike Marqusee of Iraq Occupation Focus writing in the Guardian, \\"Fallujah's compensation commissioner has reported that 36,000 of the city's 50,000 homes were destroyed, along with 60 schools and 65 mosques and shrines\\". Reconstruction mainly consists of clearing rubble from heavily damaged areas and reestablishing basic utility services. 10% of the pre-offensive inhabitants had returned as of mid-January 2005, and 30% as of the end of March 2005. In 2006, some reports say two-thirds have now returned and only 15 percent remain displaced on the outskirts of the city. Pre-offensive inhabitant figures are unreliable; the nominal population was assumed to have been 250,000‚Äì350,000. Thus, over 150,000 individuals are still living as IDPs in tent cities or with relatives outside Fallujah or elsewhere in Iraq. Current estimates by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior and Coalition Forces put the city's population at over 350,000, possibly closing in on half a million. In the aftermath of the offensive, relative calm was restored to Fallujah although almost-daily attacks against coalition forces resumed in 2005 as the population slowly trickled back into the city. From 2005‚Äì06, elements of the New Iraqi Army's 2nd and 4th brigades, 1st Division, occupied the city while the Marines maintained a small complex consisting of a security element from RCT8 and a CMOC at the city hall. The Iraqi units were aided by Military Transition Teams. Most Marine elements stayed outside of the city limits. In December 2006, enough control had been exerted over the city to transfer operational control of the city from American forces to the 1st Iraqi Army Division. During the same month, the Fallujah police force began major offensive operations under their new chief. Coalition Forces, as of May 2007, are operating in direct support of the Iraqi Security Forces in the city. The city is one of Anbar province's centers of gravity in a newfound optimism among American and Iraqi leadership about the state of the counterinsurgency in the region. In June 2007, Regimental Combat Team 6 began Operation Alljah, a security plan modeled on a successful operation in Ramadi. After segmenting districts of the city, Iraqi Police and Coalition Forces established police district headquarters in order to further localize the law enforcement capabilities of the Iraqi Police. A similar program had met with success in the city of Ramadi in late 2006 and early 2007 (See Battle of Ramadi). ISIL control, siege, and recapture In January 2014, a variety of sources reported that the city was controlled by al-Qaeda and/or the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS; sometimes called ISIL). On a broadcast of National Public Radio's All Things Considered, Middle East analyst Kirk Sowell stated that while ISIS was occupying parts of the city, most of the ground lost was to the tribal militias who are opposed to both the Iraqi government and al-Qaeda. More than 100 people were killed as Iraqi police and tribesmen battled militants who took over parts of two cities on Anbar province. On the same day, the Iraqi Army shelled the city of Fallujah with mortars to try to wrest back control from Sunni Muslim militants and tribesmen, killing at least eight people, tribal leaders and officials said. Medical sources in Fallujah said another 30 people were wounded in shelling by the army. Despite various reports stating that the ISIS was behind the unrest, Christian Science Monitor journalist Dan Murphy disputed this allegation and claimed that while ISIS fighters have maintained a presence in the city, various tribal militias who sympathized with the ideas of nationalism and were opposed to both the Iraqi government and the ISIS controlled the largest share of area in Fallujah. A report from Al Arabiya also backed this claim and alleged that the relationship between the tribesmen and the ISIS militants was only logistical. On 14 January, various tribal chieftains in the province acknowledged \\"revolutionary tribesmen\\" were behind the uprising in Fallujah and other parts of Anbar and announced they would support them unless Maliki agreed to cease the ongoing military crackdowns on tribesmen.Anbar tribesmen voice opposition to Iraqi PM Maliki World Bulletin.com, 14 January 2014 Speaking on condition of anonymity at the end of May 2014, an Anbar-based Iraqi government security officer told Human Rights Watch that ISIS controlled several neighborhoods of southeast Fallujah as well as several northern and southern satellite communities, while local militias loyal to the Anbar Military Council controlled the central and northern neighborhoods of the city; however, Human Rights Watch stated that they could not confirm these claims. Despite the discussion over which groups initially controlled the city, Fallujah was mostly referred to as under ISIL/ISIS control during the occupation.Iraqi Forces Claim Victory Over ISIS In Fallujah , npr.org, 26 June 2016Iraqi general: 'The battle for Falluja is over' , cnn.com After beginning a campaign to liberate Anbar Governorate from ISIL in July 2015, in February 2016, the Iraqi army and its allies started to encircle the city in the Siege of Fallujah. On 22 May 2016, Operation Breaking Terrorism was launched to recapture Fallujah,Iraqi military claims advances in Islamic State-held Fallujah , Washington Post marking the beginning of the Battle of Fallujah.  Battle of Fallujah  Liberation of Fallujah by Iraqi Armed Forces, 28 June 2016 On 22 May 2016, the Iraqi Army notified the remaining Fallujah residents of its plans to retake the city, and that such residents should either evacuate, or if not possible, to minimally raise a white flag over their roofs. Over the next several days, the army made advances on the city, capturing several surrounding villages on the outskirts on the town, killing a total of ~270 ISIL fighters, at least 35 members of Iraqi forces, ~40 civilians, and 1 Basij member, as of 1 June 2016. On 30 May 2016, the military began to enter the city of Fallujah itself, but began to be stalled on 1 June, trying to attack ISIL members, but keeping the tens of thousands of civilians still trapped inside the city safe. However, by 3 June they began to make further advances on the city, killing 62 more ISIL militants. On 26 June, the Iraqi army reported that it had fully liberated the city, while fighting was ongoing in some pockets northwest of Fallujah which remained under ISIL control. Geography Fallujah's western boundary is the Euphrates River. The Euphrates flows from the west (Ramadi), past Fallujah, and into the Baghdad area. When the river reaches the western edge of Fallujah, it turns north, then quickly south, forming what is commonly referred to as the 'peninsula' area. There are two bridges that cross the Euphrates at Fallujah. The city's eastern boundary is Highway 1, a four-lane, divided superhighway that travels from Baghdad past Fallujah towards the west. After the sanctions imposed by the UN after the 1991 Gulf War, this highway became the main supply route for the country. Truckers and travelers from Saudi Arabia, Jordan and southern Syria all merge onto this highway prior to entering the Eastern Al Anbar province. The highway has a prominent 'cloverleaf' interchange with Highway 10 on the eastern edge of Fallujah. Highway 10, which also runs through Fallujah. It is a two-lane highway that turns into a four lane highway once inside of Fallujah. The highway runs east-west from Baghdad through Fallujah then west towards Ramadi. A 'cloverleaf' on-ramp allows for traffic on/off Highway 1. The highway basically splits the city into two halves, north and south. The northern boundary is a railroad line that runs east-west just along the northern edge of the city. The line sits atop a 10‚Äì15 foot high berm all along the northern edge of the city, except where it crosses Highway 1. There are three major hospital locations in Fallujah. The main hospital (formerly Saddam General) is located downtown, near the west end. The second is located across the Euphrates River in an area of west Fallujah commonly referred to as the 'peninsula', (due to its shape). The third hospital is the Jordanian Field Hospital located east of the Highway 10/Highway 1 interchange. Health In 2010, it was reported that an academic studyChris Busby, Malak Hamdan and Entesar Ariabi (2010), \\"Cancer, Infant Mortality and Birth Sex-Ratio in Fallujah, Iraq 2005‚Äì2009 \\", Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health, 2010, 7, 2828‚Äì2837; had shown \\"a four-fold increase in all cancers and a 12-fold increase in childhood cancer\\" since 2004.Patrick Cockburn, The Independent, 24 July 2010, Toxic legacy of US assault on Fallujah 'worse than Hiroshima' In addition, the report said the types of cancer were \\"similar to that in the Hiroshima survivors who were exposed to ionising radiation from the bomb and uranium in the fallout\\", and an 18% fall in the male birth ratio (to 850 per 1000 female births, compared to the usual 1050) was similar to that seen after the Hiroshima bombing. The authors cautioned that while \\"the results seem to qualitatively support the existence of serious mutation-related health effects in Fallujah, owing to the structural problems associated with surveys of this kind, care should be exercised in interpreting the findings quantitatively\\".

A malfunction prevented safe separation of its onboard nuclear reactor; when the satellite reentered the Earth's atmosphere the following year, it scattered radioactive debris over northern Canada, some of the debris landing in the Great Slave Lake next to Fort Resolution, NWT. This prompted an extensive cleanup operation known as Operation Morning Light. Launch and operation The satellite was part of the Soviet Union's RORSAT programme, a series of reconnaissance satellites which observed ocean traffic, including surface vessels and nuclear submarines, using active radar. It was assigned the Kosmos number 954 and was launched on 18 September 1977 at 13:55 UTC from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, on a Tsyklon-2 carrier rocket. With an orbital inclination of 65¬∞, a periapsis of and apoapsis of , it orbited the Earth every 89.5 minutes. Powered by a liquid sodium‚Äìpotassium thermionic converter driven by a nuclear reactor containing around of uranium-235, the satellite was intended for long-term on-orbit observation, but by December 1977 the satellite had deviated from its designed orbit and its flightpath was becoming increasingly erratic. In mid-December North American Aerospace Defense Command, which had assigned the satellite the Satellite Catalog Number 10361, noticed Kosmos 954 making erratic manoeuvres, changing the altitude of its orbit by up to 50 miles, as its Soviet operators struggled to control their failing spacecraft. In secret meetings, Soviet officials warned their US counterparts that they had lost control over the vehicle, and that the system which was intended to propel the spent reactor core into a safe disposal orbit had failed. At 11:53 GMT on 24 January 1978, Kosmos 954 reentered the Earth's atmosphere while travelling on a northeastward track over western Canada. At first the USSR claimed that the satellite had been completely destroyed during re-entry, but later searches showed debris from the satellite had been deposited on Canadian territory along a path from Great Slave Lake to Baker Lake. The area spans portions of the Northwest Territories, present-day Nunavut, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Recovery Using hand-held radiation survey meters to find the debris First Kosmos 954 debris found The effort to recover radioactive material from the satellite was dubbed Operation Morning Light. Covering a total area of , the joint Canadian‚ÄìAmerican team swept the area on foot and by air in Phase I from 24 January 1978 to 20 April 1978 and Phase II from 21 April 1978 to 15 October 1978. They were ultimately able to recover twelve large pieces of the satellite, ten of which were radioactive. These pieces displayed radioactivity of up to 1.1 sieverts per hour, yet they only comprised an estimated 1% of the fuel. One fragment had a radiation level of 500 R/h, which \\"is sufficient to kill a person ... remaining in contact with the piece for a few hours.\\" Aftermath Under the terms of the 1972 Space Liability Convention, a state which launches an object into space is liable for damages caused by that object. For the recovery efforts, the Canadian government billed the Soviet Union C$6,041,174.70 for expenses and additional compensation for future unpredicted expenses; the USSR eventually paid C$3 million. Kosmos 954 was not the first nuclear-powered RORSAT to fail; a launch of a similar satellite in 1973 failed, dropping its reactor into the Pacific Ocean north of Japan. Subsequently, Kosmos 1402 also failed, dropping its reactor into the South Atlantic in 1983. Subsequent RORSATs were equipped with a backup core ejection mechanism, when the primary mechanism failed on Kosmos 1900 in 1988, this system succeeded in raising the core to a safe disposal orbit. Search teams did not find re-entry debris at the predicted location until they recalculated where that location would be based upon data indicating a stratospheric warming event had been in progress during re-entry. The stratospheric warming was first documented by the US Army Meteorological Rocket Network station at Poker Flat Research Range near Fairbanks, Alaska. Pop culture Kosmos 954 has become a well known piece of history and lore in Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories. Yellowknife painter Nick MacIntosh has created works of art featuring the satellite and well known local landmarks. The 28 January 1978, episode of Saturday Night Live featured a running gag about the radioactive debris from the crashed satellite having created giant, mutant lobsters heading for the U.S. east coast. The story concluded with them invading the television studio at the show's end.

He was born in China to Scottish missionary parents. He attended boarding school near London, spending time when possible with his family in Edinburgh, and afterwards attended the University of Edinburgh. At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Liddell refused to run in the heats for his favoured 100 metres because they were held on a Sunday. Instead he competed in the 400 metres held on a weekday, a race that he won. He returned to China in 1925 to serve as a missionary teacher. Aside from two furloughs in Scotland, he remained in China until his death in a Japanese civilian internment camp in 1945. Liddell's Olympic training and racing, and the religious convictions that influenced him, are depicted in the Oscar-winning 1981 film Chariots of Fire, in which he is portrayed by fellow Scot Ian Charleson. Early life Eric Liddell, often called the \\"Flying Scotsman\\", was born 16 January 1902, in Tientsin, China, the second son of the Reverend and Mrs. James Dunlop Liddell, Scottish missionaries with the London Missionary Society. Liddell went to school in China until the age of five. At the age of six, he and his eight- year-old brother Robert were enrolled in Eltham College, a boarding school in south London for the sons of missionaries. Their parents and sister Jenny returned to China. During the boys' time at Eltham, their parents, sister, and new brother Ernest came home on furlough two or three times and were able to be together as a family, mainly living in Edinburgh. At Eltham, Liddell was an outstanding athlete, earning the Blackheath Cup as the best athlete of his year, and playing for the First XI and the First XV by the age of 15, later becoming captain of both the cricket and rugby union teams. His headmaster, George Robertson, described him as being \\"entirely without vanity.\\" While at the University of Edinburgh, Liddell became well known for being the fastest runner in Scotland. Newspapers carried stories of his feats at track meets, and many articles stated that he was a potential Olympic winner. Liddell was chosen to speak for Glasgow Students' Evangelistic Union by one of the GSEU's co-founders, D.P. Thomson, because he was a devout Christian. The GSEU hoped that he would draw large crowds to hear the Gospel. The GSEU would send out a group of eight to ten men to an area where they would stay with the local population. It was Liddell's job to be lead speaker and to evangelize to the men of Scotland. University of Edinburgh In 1920 Liddell joined his brother Robert at the University of Edinburgh to study Pure Science. Athletics and rugby played a large part in his university life. He ran in the 100-yard and 220-yard races for the University, and played rugby for the University Club, from which he gained a place in the backline of a strong Scotland national rugby union team. He scored four tries for Scotland. In 1922 and 1923, he played in seven out of eight Five Nations matches along with A. L. Gracie. In 1923 he won the AAA Championships in athletics in the 100-yard race (setting a British record of 9.7 seconds that would not be equalled for 23 years)British 100 yards record equalled The Advocate 6 August 1946 and 220-yard race (21.6 seconds). He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree after the Paris Olympiad in 1924. Paris Olympics The 1924 Summer Olympics were hosted by the city of Paris. A devout Christian, Liddell refused to run in a heat held on Sunday (the Christian Sabbath) and was forced to withdraw from the 100-metre race, his best event. The schedule had been published several months earlier, and his decision was made well before the Games. Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400-metre race, though his best pre-Olympics time of 49.6 seconds, set in winning the 1924 AAA championship 440-yard race, was modest by international standards. On the morning of the Olympic 400-metre final, 11 July 1924, Liddell was handed a folded square of paper by one of the team masseurs. Reading it later he found the message: \\"In the old book it says: 'He that honours me I will honour.' Wishing you the best of success always.\\" Recognising the reference to , Liddell was profoundly moved that someone other than his coach believed in him and the stance he had taken. The pipe band of the 51st Highland Brigade played outside the stadium for the hour before he ran. The 400-metre had been considered a middle-distance event in which runners raced round the first bend and coasted through the back leg. Inspired by the Biblical message, and deprived of a view of the other runners because he drew the outside lane, Liddell raced the whole of the first 200 metres to be well clear of the favoured Americans. With little option but to then treat the race as a complete sprint, he continued to race around the final bend. He was challenged all the way down the home straight but held on to take the win. He broke the Olympic and world records with a time of 47.6 seconds. It was controversially ratified as a world record, despite it being 0.2 seconds slower than the record for the greater distance of 440 yards. A few days earlier Liddell had competed in the 200-metre finals, for which he received the bronze medal behind Americans Jackson Scholz and Charles Paddock, beating British rival and teammate Harold Abrahams, who finished in sixth place. This was the second and last race in which these two runners met.Liddell had finished some five yards ahead of Abrahams in a 220-yard semi-final at the 1923 AAA Championships. His performance in the 400-metre race in Paris stood as a European record for 12 years, until beaten by another British athlete, Godfrey Brown, at the Berlin Olympics in 1936. After the Olympics and graduation from the University of Edinburgh, Liddell continued to compete. His refusal to compete on Sunday meant he had also missed the Olympic 4 x 400-meter relay, in which Britain finished third. Shortly after the Games, his final leg in the 4 √ó 400-metre race in a British Empire vs. USA contest, helped secure the victory over the gold-medal winning Americans. A year later, in 1925, at the Scottish Amateur Athletics Association (SAAA) meeting in Hampden Park in Glasgow, he equalled his Scottish championship record of 10.0 seconds in the 100-yard race, won the 220-yard contest in 22.2 seconds, won the 440-yard contest in 47.7, and participated in a winning relay team. He was only the fourth athlete to have won all three sprints at the SAAA, achieving this feat in 1924 and 1925. These were his final races on British soil. Because of his birth and death in China, some of that country's Olympic literature lists Liddell as China's first Olympic champion.Chariots of Fire's Liddell, a Chinese hero? ‚Äì By Nick Mulvenney (6 August 2008) Reuters Christian missionary work in China Monument to Eric Liddell on the grounds of the former Weihsien Internment Camp Liddell returned to Northern China to serve as a missionary, like his parents, from 1925 to 1943 ‚Äì first in Tianjin and later in the town of Xiaozhang (Simplified Chinese ËÇñÂº†Èïá),Xiaozhang was spelled as Siaochang in most Western documents according to Wade-Giles system. Zaoqiang County, Hengshui, Hebei province, an extremely poor area that had suffered during the country's civil wars and had become a particularly treacherous battleground with the invading Japanese. During his time in China as a missionary, Liddell continued to compete sporadically, including wins over members of the 1928 French and Japanese Olympic teams in the 200- and 400-metre races at the South Manchurian Railway celebrations in China in 1928 and a victory at the 1930 North China championship. He returned to Scotland only twice, in 1932 and again in 1939. On one occasion he was asked if he ever regretted his decision to leave behind the fame and glory of athletics. Liddell responded, \\"It's natural for a chap to think over all that sometimes, but I'm glad I'm at the work I'm engaged in now. A fellow's life counts for far more at this than the other.\\" Liddell's first job as a missionary was as a teacher at an Anglo-Chinese College (grades 1‚Äì12) for wealthy Chinese students. He believed that by teaching the children of the wealthy, they would become influential figures in China and promote Christian values. Liddell used his athletic experience to train boys in a number of different sports. One of his many responsibilities was that of superintendent of the Sunday school at Union Church where his father was pastor. Liddell lived at 38 Chongqing Dao (formerly known as Cambridge Road) in Tianjin, where a plaque commemorates his residence. He also helped build the Minyuan Stadium in Tianjin. During his first furlough from missionary work in 1932, he was ordained a minister of the Congregational Union of Scotland. On his return to China he married Florence Mackenzie of Canadian missionary parentage in Tianjin in 1934. Liddell courted his future wife by taking her for lunch to the Kiesling restaurant, which is still open in Tianjin. The couple had three daughters, Patricia, Heather and Maureen, the last of whom he would not live to see. The school where Liddell taught is still in use today. One of his daughters visited Tianjin in 1991 and presented the headmaster of the school with one of the medals that Liddell had won for athletics. In 1941 life in China had become so dangerous because of Japanese aggression that the British government advised British nationals to leave. Florence (who was pregnant with Maureen) and the children left for Canada to stay with her family when Liddell accepted a position at a rural mission station in Xiaozhang, which served the poor. He joined his brother, Rob, who was a doctor there. The station was severely short of help and the missionaries there were exhausted. A constant stream of locals came at all hours for medical treatment. Liddell arrived at the station in time to relieve his brother, who was ill and needing to go on furlough. Liddell suffered many hardships himself at the mission. Internment Images of Eric Liddell inside Weixian Internment Camp's new (Fall 2018) museum (behind ÊΩçÂùäÂ∏Ç‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂåªÈô¢) As fighting between the Chinese Eighth Route Army and invading Japanese. reached Xiaozhang, the Japanese took over the mission station and Liddell returned to Tianjin. In 1943, he was interned at the Weihsien Internment Camp (in the modern city of Weifang) with the members of the China Inland Mission, Chefoo School (in the city now known as Yantai), and many others. Liddell became a leader and organiser at the camp, but food, medicine and other supplies were scarce. There were many cliques in the camp and when some rich businessmen managed to smuggle in some eggs, Liddell shamed them into sharing them. While fellow missionaries formed cliques, moralised and acted selfishly, Liddell busied himself by helping the elderly, teaching Bible classes at the camp school, arranging games, and teaching science to the children, who referred to him as Uncle Eric.Jackson(?), p. 21 It was also claimed that one Sunday Liddell refereed a hockey match to stop fighting amongst the players, as he was trusted not to take sides. One of his fellow internees, Norman Cliff, later wrote a book about his experiences in the camp called \\"The Courtyard of the Happy Way\\" (Chinese Ê®ÇÈÅìÈô¢, also translated as \\"The Campus of Loving Truth\\"),. which detailed the remarkable characters in the camp. Cliff described Liddell as \\"the finest Christian gentleman it has been my pleasure to meet. In all the time in the camp, I never heard him say a bad word about anybody\\". Langdon Gilkey, who also survived the camp and became a prominent theologian in his native America, said of Liddell: \\"Often in an evening I would see him bent over a chessboard or a model boat, or directing some sort of square dance ‚Äì absorbed, weary and interested, pouring all of himself into this effort to capture the imagination of these penned-up youths. He was overflowing with good humour and love for life, and with enthusiasm and charm. It is rare indeed that a person has the good fortune to meet a saint, but he came as close to it as anyone I have ever known.\\" Death  Eric Liddell statue in front of alt= In his last letter to his wife, written on the day he died, Liddell wrote of suffering a nervous breakdown due to overwork. He had an inoperable brain tumour; overwork and malnourishment may have hastened his death. Liddell died on 21 February 1945, five months before liberation. Langdon Gilkey later wrote, \\"The entire camp, especially its youth, was stunned for days, so great was the vacuum that Eric's death had left.\\" According to a fellow missionary, Liddell's last words were, \\"It's complete surrender\\", in reference to how he had given his life to God. p. 160-170 According to a different source, the 2007 documentary film Eric Liddell: Champion of Conviction, Liddell had been in and out of the hospital due to the brain tumor. One of his students, Joyce Stranks, came to visit him in the hospital to discuss a book he had written about surrender to God's will. While discussing the book, Liddell reached a point when he was unable to complete saying the word \\"surrender,\\" and instead he said \\"surren-...surren-\\" and after this his head fell back to his pillow and he died. Legacy On 5 June 1945 the Eric Liddell Memorial Committee was set up in Glasgow, seeking donations for a Fund to provide for the education and maintenance of Eric Liddell's three daughters; to fund an Eric Liddell Missionary Scholarship at the University of Edinburgh and an Eric Liddell Challenge Trophy for Amateur Athletics; and to erect a Memorial in North China to commemorate Eric Liddell's work there. Only the first and third objectives were achieved. To raise funds and to widen its appeal, the Committee published a pamphlet by D.P. Thomson: Eric Liddell, The Making of an Athlete and the Training of a Missionary. The Fund was eventually wound up in 1954, having raised ¬£3,687 15s - over ¬£88,000 in relative purchasing power. D.P. Thomson also spoke at well- attended Memorial Services held in both Edinburgh and Glasgow in 1945. In 2008, just before the Beijing Olympics, Chinese authorities claimed that Liddell had refused an opportunity to leave the camp, and instead gave his place to a pregnant woman. Apparently, the Japanese and British, with Churchill's approval, had agreed upon a prisoner exchange. However, his friends and those who had lived with him in the camp disputed the claim.Hamilton 2016 p.321. When Scotsman Allan Wells won the 100-metre sprint at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, 56 years after the 1924 Paris Olympics, he was asked if he had run the race for Harold Abrahams, the last 100-metre Olympic winner from Britain (who had died two years previously). \\"No\\", Wells replied. \\"I would prefer to dedicate this to Eric Liddell\\". In 2002, when the first men and women were inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame, Eric Liddell topped the public vote for the most popular sporting hero Scotland had ever produced. Memorial Memorial plaque at Edinburgh University Liddell was buried in the garden behind the Japanese officers' quarters, his grave marked by a small wooden cross. The site was forgotten until it was rediscovered in 1989, in the grounds of what is now Weifeng Middle School in Shandong Province, north-east China, about six hours' drive from Beijing. Its rediscovery was largely the result of the determination of Charles Walker, an engineer working in Hong Kong, who felt one of Scotland's great heroes was in danger of being forgotten. His search for the grave proved difficult because since Liddell's death, place names had changed, documents disappeared and witnesses were difficult to find. In 1991 the University of Edinburgh erected a memorial headstone, made from Isle of Mull granite and carved by a mason in Tobermory, at the former camp site in Weifang. The simple inscription came from the Book of Isaiah 40:31: \\"They shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary.\\" The city of Weifang commemorated Liddell during the 60th anniversary of the internment camp's liberation by laying a wreath on his grave. The Eric Liddell Centre was set up in Edinburgh in 1980 to honour Liddell's beliefs in community service whilst he lived and studied in Edinburgh. Local residents dedicated it to inspiring, empowering, and supporting people of all ages, cultures and abilities, as an expression of compassionate Christian values. The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) remembers Liddell with a feast day on 22 February. Eltham College's sports centre was named \\"Eric Liddell Sports Centre\\" in his memory. In 2012 the University of Edinburgh launched a high performance sports scholarship named after Liddell. It was announced during a visit by Patricia Russell, Liddell's oldest daughter. Portrayals on film and stage * The Oscar-winning 1981 film Chariots of Fire revolves around Liddell and fellow sprinter Harold Abrahams. In it, Liddell is portrayed by Ian Charleson. *In 2012, the play Chariots of Fire, based on the 1981 film, starred Jack Lowden as Liddell. *A 2016 film, On Wings of Eagles (Chinese name ÁªàÊûÅËÉúÂà©, and original English name The Last Race), produced by Beijing Forbidden City Studio, directed by Hong Kong director Stephen Shin, stars Joseph Fiennes as Liddell, and portrays his return to China and the rest of his life after the 1924 Olympics. Chariots of Fire The 1981 film Chariots of Fire chronicles and contrasts the lives and viewpoints of Liddell and Harold Abrahams. One inaccuracy surrounds Liddell's refusal to race in the 100-metre event at the 1924 Paris Summer Olympics. The film portrays Liddell as finding out that one of the heats was to be held on a Sunday as he boards the boat that will take the British Olympic team across the English Channel to Paris. In reality, the schedule and Liddell's decision were both known several months in advance, though his refusal to participate remains significant. Liddell had also been selected to run as a member of the 4√ó100-meter and 4√ó400-meter relay teams at the Olympics, but he also declined these spots as the finals were to be run on a Sunday. One scene in the film depicts Liddell falling early in a 440-yard race in a Scotland‚ÄìFrance dual meet and making up a 20-yard deficit to win; the actual race was during a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England and Ireland at Stoke-on-Trent in England in July 1923. Liddell was knocked to the ground several strides into the race. He hesitated, got up and pursued his opponents, 20 yards ahead. He caught the leaders shortly before the finish line and collapsed after crossing the tape. This scene was filmed at Goldenacre stadium in Edinburgh, the playing fields of George Heriot's School in Edinburgh. Producer David Puttnam viewed footage from a 1924 film of Liddell and Abrahams while researching the film with scriptwriter Colin Welland and Liddell's unorthodox running style as portrayed in the film, with his head back and his mouth wide open, is also said to be accurate. At an athletics championship in Glasgow, a visitor watching the 440-yard final, in which Liddell was a long way behind the leaders at the start of the last lap (of a 220-yard track), remarked to a Glasgow native that Liddell would be hard put to win the race. The Glaswegian merely replied, \\"His head's no' back yet.\\" Liddell then threw his head back and, with mouth wide open, caught and passed his opponents to win the race. In the 1945 report of his death The Guardian wrote \\"He is remembered among lovers of athletics as probably the ugliest runner who ever won an Olympic championship. When he appeared in the heats of the 400m at Paris in 1924, his huge sprawling stride, his head thrown back and his arms clawing the air, moved the Americans and other sophisticated experts to ribald laughter.\\" Rival Harold Abrahams said in response to criticism of Liddell's style: \\"People may shout their heads off about his appalling style. Well, let them. He gets there.\\" See also * Protestant missions in China 1807‚Äì1953 * David Jacobs, the first British Jew to win an Olympic Gold Medal ReferencesFurther sources=Archives * The Eric Liddell Centre's website has a comprehensive range of information, photographs, videos and stories on Eric Liddell donated and written by his family. * Papers relating to Liddell's life as a missionary are held at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London. * Papers relating to The Eric Liddell Memorial Committee and Fund are held at Lloyds Banking Group Archives (Edinburgh), reference Number GB 1830 LID. * D.P.

The result is that the users re-implement the required functions in terms of the interface, which in its turn uses the internal implementation of the same functions. This may result in implementing lower- level features in terms of higher-level ones, thus the term 'abstraction inversion'. Possible ill-effects are: * The user of such a re-implemented function may seriously underestimate its running-costs. * The user of the construct is forced to obscure their implementation with complex mechanical details. * Many users attempt to solve the same problem, increasing the risk of error.  Examples  Alleged examples from professional programming circles include: * In Ada, choice of the rendezvous construct as a synchronisation primitive forced programmers to implement simpler constructs such as semaphores on the more complex basis.Critique of DIN Kernel Lisp Definition Version 1.2, footnote 2 - says (without references) that the term derives from critiques of the Ada rendezvous, appears to be one of the earliest uses. * In Applesoft BASIC, integer arithmetic was implemented on top of floating-point arithmetic, and there were no bitwise operators and no support for blitting of raster graphics (even though the language supported vector graphics on the Apple II's raster hardware). This caused games and other programs written in BASIC to run slower. * Like Applesoft BASIC, Lua has a floating-point type as its sole numeric typeProgramming in Lua : 2.3 - Numbers Accessed 2009-10-12. when configured for desktop computers,lua-users c2: Floating Point Accessed 2009-10-12. and it had no bitwise operators prior to Lua 5.2.lua-users c2: Bitwise Operators Accessed 2013-01-15. * Creating an object to represent a function is cumbersome in object-oriented languages such as Java and C++ (especially prior to C++11 and Java 8), in which functions are not first-class objects. In C++ it is possible to make an object 'callable' by overloading the \`()\` operator, but it is still often necessary to implement a new class, such as the Functors in the STL. (C++11's lambda function makes it much easier to create an object representing a function.) * Tom Lord has suggested that Subversion version control system pays for the abstraction inversion of implementing a write-only database on a read/write database with poor performance.sourcefrog : Tom Lord on Subversion * Using stored procedures to manipulate data in a relational database, without granting programmers right to deploy such procedures, leads to reimplementing queries outside the database. For example, large datasets (in extreme cases - whole tables) are fetched and actual filtering takes place in application code. Alternatively, thousands of rows are updated (inserted or even fetched) one by one instead of running a multiple row query. Examples that are common outside professional programming circles include: * Using spreadsheet lookup functions to replicate the functionality of a database * Using variant data types as loop counters in Microsoft Visual Basic where an integer type is also available.

The most widespread form of native folk music was the likurai dance, performed by women to welcome home men after war. They used a small drum and sometimes carried enemy heads in processions through villages; a modern version of the dance is used by women in courtship. In the modern era, East Timorese music has been closely associated with the independence movement; for example, the band Dili Allstars released a song that became an anthem in the build-up to the referendum on independence in 2000, while the United Nations commissioned a song called \\"Hakotu Ba\\" (by Lahane) to encourage people to register to vote in the referendum. East Timorese popular musicians include Teo Batiste Ximenes, who grew up in Australia and uses folk rhythms from his homeland in his music . With many East Timorese people in emigrant communities in Australia, Portugal and elsewhere, East Timorese folk music has been brought to many places around the world. Refugee camps in Portugal mixed together East Timorese music with styles from other Portuguese colonies like Angola and Mozambique . The guitar has long been an important part of East Timorese music, though it is an import brought by colonisers; there are, however, native kinds of string instruments similar in some ways to the guitar. Foreign influences also include popular styles of music like rock and roll, hip hop and reggae . Lyrics of the songs can be sung in Tetum or Portuguese, official languages of East Timor.

He is a member of the Labour Party, and was New Zealand's first MP from South Asia and Pakistan. Education Choudhary was born in the Pakistani half of the Punjab region in village Jajay at the home of Chaudhry Muhammad Boota. He comes from a family of agriculture. He attended high school in the town of Sialkot, and then gained a degree in agricultural engineering from University of Agriculture, Faisalabad (UAF) in Faisalabad. He continued his studies abroad, gaining a master's degree in agricultural engineering at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, England and a PhD in agricultural engineering at Massey University, New Zealand. By profession, Choudhary was originally an environmental scientist and taught at the Massey University of New Zealand before his induction into Parliament. He has published a large number of scientific papers in his field, and is considered to be an international authority on conservation tillage. His work has a particular focus on agricultural techniques in developing countries. Choudhary has three children. Migrating to New Zealand Before entering Parliament, Choudhary had worked with a number of community organizations, including such groups as the New Zealand Federation of Ethnic Councils and FIANZ ‚Äì the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand (of which he was president in 1984‚Äì85). In his capacity as president of FIANZ he oversaw the first annual halal meat contract with the New Zealand Meat Producers Board in June 1984, with the aid of Mazhar Krasniqi, Hajji Abdul Rahim Rasheed and Dr. Mohammad Hanif Quazi. In the 2001 New Year Honours, Choudhary was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for community service. Entrance into New Zealand politics Having been a supporter of the Labour Party for some time, Choudhary was elected to Parliament as a Labour Party list MP in the 2002 election. He was sworn in on the Qur'an, something which Winston Peters (leader of the New Zealand First party) criticised as a breach of proper procedure. The rules, however, contained no prohibition against it, allowing the taker of the oath to specify any religious text they wished (or, alternatively, use none at all). Because Parliamentary officials did not have a copy of the Qur'an, they obtained a copy from the FIANZ office, which was then donated to the Parliamentary Library for use in the future. Since entering Parliament, Choudhary has served on the Primary Production, Local Government and Environment, and Education and Science select committees. He also came to public attention in 2003, when he abstained in a vote to legalise prostitution. The Muslim community were upset by his decision to abstain from voting since prostitution is seen as a violation of their faith. Retirement On 29 September 2011, Choudhary delivered his valedictory speech in Parliament and would retire from politics after the 2011 general election.Parliament Today ‚Äì Valedictory Speeches Sept 29, 2011 Since retiring Choudhary has been active in the Pakistani and Indian community circles of Auckland encouraging youth political involvement and supporting blood donor drives. At the 2016 Auckland elections, Choudhary was elected to the Otara- Papatoetoe Local Board and Counties Manukau District Health Board.

It is closely related to androstenediol (androst-5-ene-3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diol). Biological function Androstenedione is a precursor of testosterone and other androgens, as well as of estrogens like estrone, in the body. In addition to functioning as an endogenous prohormone, androstenedione also has weak androgenic activity in its own right. Androstenedione has been found to possess some estrogenic activity, similarly to other DHEA metabolites. However, in contrast to androstenediol, its affinity for the estrogen receptors is very low, with less than 0.01% of the affinity of estradiol for both the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤. Adrenarche In children aged 6 to 8 years old, there is a rise in androstenedione secretion along with DHEA during adrenarche. This rise in androstenedione and DHEA is hypothesized to play a crucial role for learning social, cultural and ecological skills, such as the development and understanding of sexual attraction. Furthermore, it is thought that androstenedione plays a role in levels of aggression and competition in boys, as a positive correlation between the two were observed, while testosterone levels were below detection. Biochemistry=Biosynthesis Steroidogenesis. Androstenedione is at center. Androstenedione is the common precursor of the androgen and estrogen sex hormones. Androstenedione can be biosynthesized in one of two ways. The primary pathway involves conversion of 17Œ±-hydroxypregnenolone to DHEA by way of 17,20-lyase, with subsequent conversion of DHEA to androstenedione via the enzyme 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The secondary pathway involves conversion of 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone, most often a precursor to cortisol, to androstenedione directly by way of 17,20-lyase. Thus, 17,20-lyase is required for the synthesis of androstenedione, whether immediately or one step removed. Androstenedione is produced in the adrenal glands and the gonads. The production of adrenal androstenedione is governed by adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), whereas production of gonadal androstenedione is under control by the gonadotropins. In premenopausal women, the adrenal glands and ovaries each produce about half of the total androstenedione (about 3 mg/day). After menopause, androstenedione production is about halved, due primarily to the reduction of the steroid secreted by the ovary. Nevertheless, androstenedione is the principal steroid produced by the postmenopausal ovary. Some androstenedione is also secreted into the plasma, and may be converted in peripheral tissues to testosterone and estrogens. Metabolism Androstenedione is converted to either testosterone or estrone. Conversion of androstenedione to testosterone requires the enzyme 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Androstenedione is released into the blood by theca cells. Conversion of androstenedione to estrone requires the enzyme aromatase. Androstenedione is a substrate for estrogen production in granulosa cells which produce aromatase. Thus, theca cells and granulosa cells work together to form estrogens. Androstanedione is a 5Œ±-reduced metabolite of 4-androstenedione which serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the androgen and neurosteroid androsterone. Levels Levels are normally 30‚Äì200 ng/dL (1.0‚Äì7.0 nmol/L) in females and 40‚Äì150 ng/dL (1.4‚Äì5.2 nmol/L) in males. Pharmacology Androstenedione has been shown to increase serum testosterone levels over an eight-hour period in men when taken as a single oral dose of 300 mg per day, but a dose of 100 mg had no significant effect on serum testosterone. However, serum levels of estradiol increased following both the 100 mg and 300 mg doses. The study also reported that the serum level of estrogens and testosterone produced varied widely between individuals. A 2006 review paper summarized several studies that examined the effect of androstenedione on strength training. At dosages of 50 mg or 100 mg per day, androstenedione had no effect on muscle strength or size, or on body fat levels. One study used a daily dosage of 300 mg of androstenedione combined with several other supplements, and also found no increase in strength when compared to a control group that did not take the supplements. The review authors speculate that sufficiently high doses may indeed lead to increased muscle size and strength. However, due to the federal ban on androstenedione supplements, it is difficult to carry out new research on its effects. The review authors conclude that individuals should not use androstenedione supplements due to the lack of evidence of beneficial effects, the wide variation in individual responses to the supplement, and the risk of unknown side effects. Medical use Under the brand name Metharmon-F and in combination with sex steroids (pregnenolone, testosterone, estrone, androstenediol) and thyroid hormone (desiccated thyroid), androstenedione is or has been marketed for medical use in Thailand.https://www.medicinescomplete.com/mc/martindale/2009/20324-x.htm Chemistry Androstenedione, also known as androst-4-ene-3,17-dione, is a naturally occurring androstane steroid and a 17-ketosteroid. It is closely related structurally to androstenediol (A5; androst-5-ene-3Œ≤,17Œ≤-diol), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; androst-5-en-3Œ≤-ol-17-one), and testosterone (androst-4-en-17Œ≤-ol-3-one), as well as to 5Œ±-androstanedione (5Œ±-androstane-3,17-dione) and estrone (estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3-ol-17-one or 19-norandrost-1,3,5(10)-triene-3-ol-17-one). History=Use as a supplement Androstenedione was manufactured as a dietary supplement, often called andro or andros for short. Sports Illustrated credits Patrick Arnold with introducing androstenedione to the North American market. Androstenedione was legal and able to be purchased over the counter, and, as a consequence, it was in common use in Major League Baseball throughout the 1990s by record- breaking sluggers like Mark McGwire.https://www.cnbc.com/id/34822812 Barry R. McCaffrey, in his capacity as director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, determined that androstenedione could not be classified as an anabolic steroid because there is no proof that it promotes muscle growth. Society and culture=Regulation Androstenedione is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, and from the Olympic Games. The International Olympic Committee in 1997 banned androstenedione and placed it under the category of androgenic-anabolic steroids. Androstenedione is banned by MLB, the NFL, USOC, NCAA, and by the NBA. On March 12, 2004, the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004 was introduced into the United States Senate. It amended the Controlled Substance Act to place both anabolic steroids and prohormones on a list of controlled substances, making possession of the banned substances a federal crime. The law took effect on January 20, 2005. However, androstenedione was legally defined as an anabolic steroid, even though there is scant evidence that androstenedione itself is anabolic in nature. On April 11, 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of androstenedione, citing that the drug poses significant health risks commonly associated with steroids. Androstenedione is currently banned by the U.S. military.

Thermal energy refers to several distinct physical concepts, such as the internal energy of a system; heat or sensible heat, which are defined as types of energy transfer (as is work); or for the characteristic energy of a degree of freedom in a thermal system kT, where T is temperature and k is the Boltzmann constant.  Relation to heat and internal energy  In thermodynamics, heat is energy in transfer to or from a thermodynamic system, by mechanisms other than thermodynamic work or transfer of matter.Bailyn, M. (1994). A Survey of Thermodynamics, American Institute of Physics Press, New York, , p. 82.Born, M. (1949). Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance, Oxford University Press, London, p. 31. Heat refers to a quantity transferred between systems, not to a property of any one system, or 'contained' within it. On the other hand, internal energy is a property of a single system. Heat and work depend on the way in which an energy transfer occurred, whereas internal energy is a property of the state of a system and can thus be understood without knowing how the energy got there. In a statistical mechanical account of an ideal gas, in which the molecules move independently between instantaneous collisions, the internal energy is the sum total of the gas's independent particles' kinetic energies, and it is this kinetic motion that is the source and the effect of the transfer of heat across a system's boundary. For a gas that does not have particle interactions except for instantaneous collisions, the term 'thermal energy' is effectively synonymous with 'internal energy'. In many statistical physics texts, \\"thermal energy\\" refers to kT, the product of Boltzmann's constant and the absolute temperature, also written as k_\\\\text{B} T.  * * In a material, especially in condensed matter, such as a liquid or a solid, in which the constituent particles, such as molecules or ions, interact strongly with one another, the energies of such interactions contribute strongly to the internal energy of the body, but are not simply apparent in the temperature. The term 'thermal energy' is also applied to the energy carried by a heat flow, although this can also simply be called heat or quantity of heat. Historical context In an 1847 lecture titled \\"On Matter, Living Force, and Heat\\", James Prescott Joule characterised various terms that are closely related to thermal energy and heat. He identified the terms latent heat and sensible heat as forms of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena, namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles, respectively. He described latent energy as the energy of interaction in a given configuration of particles, i.e. a form of potential energy, and the sensible heat as an energy affecting temperature measured by the thermometer due to the thermal energy, which he called the living force. Useless thermal energy If the minimum temperature of a system's environment is T_\\\\text{e} and the system's entropy is S, then a part of the system's internal energy amounting to S \\\\cdot T_\\\\text{e} cannot be converted into useful work.

It affects almost every physiological process in the body, including growth and development, metabolism, body temperature, and heart rate. Production of T3 and its prohormone thyroxine (T4) is activated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is released from the anterior pituitary gland. This pathway is part of a closed-loop feedback process: Elevated concentrations of T3, and T4 in the blood plasma inhibit the production of TSH in the anterior pituitary gland. As concentrations of these hormones decrease, the anterior pituitary gland increases production of TSH, and by these processes, a feedback control system stabilizes the amount of thyroid hormones that are in the bloodstream. T3 is the true hormone. Its effects on target tissues are roughly four times more potent than those of T4. Of the thyroid hormone that is produced, just about 20% is T3, whereas 80% is produced as T4. Roughly 85% of the circulating T3 is later formed in the liver and anterior pituitary by removal of the iodine atom from the carbon atom number five of the outer ring of T4. In any case, the concentration of T3 in the human blood plasma is about one-fortieth that of T4. The half-life of T3 is about 2.5 days. The half-life of T4 is about 6.5 days.  Production = Synthesis from T4  Thyroid hormone synthesis, with the end-product of triiodothyronin–µ seen at bottom right. T3 is the more metabolically active hormone produced from T4. T4 is deiodinated by three deiodinase enzymes to produce the more-active triiodothyronine: # Type I present in liver, kidney, thyroid, and (to a lesser extent) pituitary; it accounts for 80% of the deiodination of T4. # Type II present in CNS, pituitary, brown adipose tissue, and heart vessel, which is predominantly intracellular. In the pituitary, it mediates negative feedback on thyroid- stimulating hormone. # Type III present in placenta, CNS, and hemangioma. This deiodinase converts T4 into reverse T3, which, unlike T3, is inactive. T4 is synthesised in the thyroid follicular cells as follows. # The sodium-iodide symporter transports two sodium ions across the basement membrane of the follicular cells along with an iodine ion. This is a secondary active transporter that utilises the concentration gradient of Na+ to move I‚àí against its concentration gradient. # I‚àí is moved across the apical membrane into the colloid of the follicle. # Thyroperoxidase oxidises two I‚àí to form I2. Iodide is non-reactive, and only the more reactive iodine is required for the next step. # The thyroperoxidase iodinates the tyrosyl residues of the thyroglobulin within the colloid. The thyroglobulin was synthesised in the ER of the follicular cell and secreted into the colloid. # Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) released from the anterior pituitary gland binds the TSH receptor (a Gs protein-coupled receptor) on the basolateral membrane of the cell and stimulates the endocytosis of the colloid. # The endocytosed vesicles fuse with the lysosomes of the follicular cell. The lysosomal enzymes cleave the T4 from the iodinated thyroglobulin. # These vesicles are then exocytosed, releasing the thyroid hormones. reverse T3 and T2 is also shown.  Direct synthesis  The thyroid gland also produces small amounts of T3 directly. In the follicular lumen, tyrosine residues become iodinated. This reaction requires hydrogen peroxide. Iodine bonds carbon 3 or carbon 5 of tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin in a process called organification of iodine. The iodination of specific tyrosines yields monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). One MIT and one DIT are enzymatically coupled to form T3. The enzyme is thyroid peroxidase. The small amount of T3 could be important because different tissues have different sensitivities to T4 due to differences in deiodinase ubiquitination in different tissues link. This once again raises the question if T3 should be included in thyroid hormone replacement therapy (THRT).  Mechanism of action  T3 and T4 bind to nuclear receptors (thyroid hormone receptors). T3 and T4, although being lipophilic, are not able to passively diffuse through the phospholipid bilayers of target cells, instead relying on transmembrane iodothyronine transporters. The lipophilicity of T3 and T4 requires their binding to the protein carrier thyroid-binding protein (TBG) (thyroxine-binding globulins, thyroxine binding prealbumins, and albumins) for transport in the blood. The thyroid receptors bind to response elements in gene promoters, thus enabling them to activate or inhibit transcription. The sensitivity of a tissue to T3 is modulated through the thyroid receptors.  Transportation  The system of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4.References used in image are found in image article in Commons:Commons:File:Thyroid_system.png#References. T3 and T4 are carried in the blood, bound to plasma proteins. This has the effect of increasing the half-life of the hormone and decreasing the rate at which it is taken up by peripheral tissues. There are three main proteins that the two hormones are bound to. Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is a glycoprotein that has a higher affinity for T4 than for T3. Transthyretin is also a glycoprotein, but only carries T4, with hardly any affinity at all for T3. Finally, both hormones bind with a low affinity to serum albumin, but, due to the large availability of albumin, it has a high capacity. The saturation of binding spots on thyronine-binding globulin (TBG) by endogenous T3 can be estimated by the triiodothyronine resin uptake test. The test is performed by taking a blood sample, to which an excess of radioactive exogenous T3 is added, followed by a resin that also binds T3. A fraction of the radioactive T3 binds to sites on TBG not already occupied by endogenous thyroid hormone, and the remainder binds to the resin. The amount of labeled hormones bound to the resin is then subtracted from the total that was added, with the remainder thus being the amount that was bound to the unoccupied binding sites on TBG.triiodothyronine resin uptake test from Farlex Medical Dictionary, citing: Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. 2009, Elsevier.  Effects  T3 increases the basal metabolic rate and, thus, increases the body's oxygen and energy consumption. The basal metabolic rate is the minimal caloric requirement needed to sustain life in a resting individual. T3 acts on the majority of tissues within the body, with a few exceptions including the spleen. It increases the production of the Na+/K+ -ATPase (which normally constitutes a substantial fraction of total cellular ATP expenditure) without disrupting transmembrane ion balance and, in general, increases the turnover of different endogenous macromolecules by increasing their synthesis and degradation. Protein T3 stimulates the production of RNA Polymerase I and II and, therefore, increases the rate of protein synthesis. It also increases the rate of protein degradation, and, in excess, the rate of protein degradation exceeds the rate of protein synthesis. In such situations, the body may go into negative ion balance. Glucose T3 potentiates the effects of the Œ≤-adrenergic receptors on the metabolism of glucose. Therefore, it increases the rate of glycogen breakdown and glucose synthesis in gluconeogenesis. Lipids T3 stimulates the breakdown of cholesterol and increases the number of LDL receptors, thereby increasing the rate of lipolysis. Heart T3 increases the heart rate and force of contraction, thus increasing cardiac output, by increasing Œ≤-adrenergic receptor levels in myocardium. This results in increased systolic blood pressure and decreased diastolic blood pressure. The latter two effects act to produce the typical bounding pulse seen in hyperthyroidism. It also upregulates the thick filament protein myosin, which helps to increase contractility. A helpful clinical measure to assess contractility is the time between the QRS complex and the second heart sound. This is often decreased in hyperthyroidism. Development T3 has profound effect upon the developing embryo and infants. It affects the lungs and influences the postnatal growth of the central nervous system. It stimulates the production of myelin, the production of neurotransmitters, and the growth of axons. It is also important in the linear growth of bones. Neurotransmitters T3 may increase serotonin in the brain, in particular in the cerebral cortex, and down-regulate 5HT-2 receptors, based on studies in which T3 reversed learned helplessness in rats and physiological studies of the rat brain. Physiological function Thyroid hormones act to increase protein turnover. This might serve an adaptive function in regard to long-term calorie restriction with adequate protein. When calories are in short supply, reduction in protein turnover may ameliorate the effects of the shortage. Measurement Triiodothyronine can be measured as free triiodothyronine, which is an indicator of triiodothyronine activity in the body. It can also be measured as total triiodothyronine, which also depends on the triiodothyronine that is bound to thyroxine-binding globulin.Military Obstetrics & Gynecology ‚Äì Thyroid Function Tests In turn citing: Operational Medicine 2001, Health Care in Military Settings, NAVMED P-5139, May 1, 2001, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, Department of the Navy, 2300 E Street NW, Washington, D.C., 20372-5300 Uses= Treatment of depressive disorders  The addition of triiodothyronine to existing treatments such as SSRIs is one of the most widely studied augmentation strategies for refractory depression, however success may depend on the dosage of T3. A long-term case series study by Kelly and Lieberman of 17 patients with major refractory unipolar depression found that 14 patients showed sustained improvement of symptoms over an average timespan of two years, in some cases with higher doses of T3 than the traditional 50 ¬µg required to achieve therapeutic effect, with an average of 80 ¬µg and a dosage span of 24 months; dose range: 25-150 ¬µg. The same authors published a retrospective study of 125 patients with the two most common categories of bipolar disorders II and NOS whose treatment had previously been resistant to an average of 14 other medications. They found that 84% experienced improvement and 33% experienced full remission over a period of an average of 20.3 (standard deviation of 9.7). None of the patients experienced hypomania while on T3.  Use as a fat loss supplement  3,5-Diiodo-L- thyronine and 3,3‚Ä≤-diiodo-L-thyronine are used as ingredients in certain over- the-counter fat-loss supplements, designed for bodybuilding. Several studies have shown that these compounds increase the metabolization of fatty acids and the burning of adipose fat tissue in rats.  Alternative medicine  Triiodothyronine has been used to treat Wilson's syndrome, an alternative medical diagnosis not recognized as a medical condition by mainstream medicine. This diagnosis involves various non-specific symptoms that are attributed to the thyroid, despite normal thyroid function tests. The American Thyroid Association has raised concern that the prescribed treatment with triiodothyronine is potentially harmful.

It acts to reduce blood calcium (Ca2+), opposing the effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Calcitonin has been found in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Its importance in humans has not been as well established as its importance in other animals, as its function is usually not significant in the regulation of normal calcium homeostasis. It belongs to the calcitonin-like protein family. Historically calcitonin has also been called thyrocalcitonin. Biosynthesis and regulation Calcitonin is formed by the proteolytic cleavage of a larger prepropeptide, which is the product of the CALC1 gene (). It is functionally an antagonist with PTH and Vitamin D3.The CALC1 gene belongs to a superfamily of related protein hormone precursors including islet amyloid precursor protein, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and the precursor of adrenomedullin. Secretion of calcitonin is stimulated by: :* an increase in serum [Ca2+] :* gastrin and pentagastrin. Function The hormone participates in calcium (Ca2+) and phosphorus metabolism. In many ways, calcitonin counteracts parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D. More specifically, calcitonin lowers blood Ca2+ levels in two ways: :* Major effect: Inhibits osteoclast activity in bones, which break down the bone :* Minor effect: Inhibits renal tubular cell reabsorption of Ca2+ and phosphate, allowing them to be excreted in the urine High concentrations of calcitonin may be able to increase urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate via the renal tubules. leading to marked hypocalcemia. However, this is a minor effect with no physiological significance in humans. It is also a short- lived effect because the kidneys become resistant to calcitonin, as demonstrated by the kidney's unaffected excretion of calcium in patients with thyroid tumors that secrete excessive calcitonin. In its skeleton-preserving actions, calcitonin protects against calcium loss from skeleton during periods of calcium mobilization, such as pregnancy and, especially, lactation. The protective mechanisms include the direct inhibition of bone resorption and the indirect effect through the inhibition of the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. The reason provided is that prolactin induces the release of PTH related peptide which enhances bone resorption, but is still under investigation., Other effects are in preventing postprandial hypercalcemia resulting from absorption of Ca2+. Also, calcitonin inhibits food intake in rats and monkeys, and may have CNS action involving the regulation of feeding and appetite. Calcitonin lowers blood calcium and phosphorus mainly through its inhibition of osteoclasts. Osteoblasts do not have calcitonin receptors and are therefore not directly affected by calcitonin levels. However, since bone resorption and bone formation are coupled processes, eventually calcitonin's inhibition of osteoclastic activity leads to increased osteoblastic activity (as an indirect effect). Receptor The calcitonin receptor, localized to osteoclasts, the kidney, and regions of the brain, is a G protein-coupled receptor. It is coupled by Gs to adenylate cyclase, and thereby to the generation of cAMP in target cells. It may also affect the ovaries in women and the testes in men.  Discovery  Calcitonin was first purified in 1962 by Douglas Harold Copp and B. Cheney at the University of British Columbia, Canada. It was initially thought to be secreted by the parathyroid gland but was shown by Iain Macintyre and his team at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, to be secreted by parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland. Dr. Copp named the discovered hormone calcitonin because of its role in 'maintaining normal calcium tone'.  Medical significance  Calcitonin assay is used in identifying patients with nodular thyroid diseases. It is helpful in making an early diagnosis of medullary carcinoma of thyroid. A malignancy of the parafollicular cells, i.e. Medullary thyroid cancer, typically produces an elevated serum calcitonin level. Prognosis of MTC depends on early detection and treatment. Pharmacology Salmon calcitonin is used for the treatment of: * Postmenopausal osteoporosis * Hypercalcaemia * Paget's disease * Bone metastases * Phantom limb pain It has been investigated as a possible non-operative treatment for spinal stenosis. The following information is from the UK Electronic Medicines Compendium General characteristics of the active substance Salmon calcitonin is rapidly absorbed and eliminated. Peak plasma concentrations are attained within the first hour of administration. Animal studies have shown that calcitonin is primarily metabolised via proteolysis in the kidney following parenteral administration. The metabolites lack the specific biological activity of calcitonin. Bioavailability following subcutaneous and intramuscular injection in humans is high and similar for the two routes of administration (71% and 66%, respectively). Calcitonin has short absorption and elimination half-lives of 10‚Äì15 minutes and 50‚Äì80 minutes, respectively. Salmon calcitonin is primarily and almost exclusively degraded in the kidneys, forming pharmacologically inactive fragments of the molecule. Therefore, the metabolic clearance is much lower in patients with end-stage kidney failure than in healthy subjects. However, the clinical relevance of this finding is not known. Plasma protein binding is 30% to 40%. Characteristics in patients There is a relationship between the subcutaneous dose of calcitonin and peak plasma concentrations. Following parenteral administration of 100 IU calcitonin, peak plasma concentration lies between about 200 and 400 pg/ml. Higher blood levels may be associated with increased incidence of nausea, vomiting, and secretory diarrhea. Preclinical safety data Conventional long-term toxicity, reproduction, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity studies have been performed in laboratory animals. Salmon calcitonin is devoid of embryotoxic, teratogenic, and mutagenic potential. An increased incidence of pituitary adenomas has been reported in rats given synthetic salmon calcitonin for 1 year. This is considered a species-specific effect and of no clinical relevance. Salmon calcitonin does not cross the placental barrier. In lactating animals given calcitonin, suppression of milk production has been observed. Calcitonin is secreted into the milk. Pharmaceutical manufacture Calcitonin was extracted from the ultimobranchial glands (thyroid-like glands) of fish, particularly salmon. Salmon calcitonin resembles human calcitonin, but is more active. At present, it is produced either by recombinant DNA technology or by chemical peptide synthesis. The pharmacological properties of the synthetic and recombinant peptides have been demonstrated to be qualitatively and quantitatively equivalent. Uses of calcitonin=Treatments Calcitonin affecting the spine. Calcitonin can be used therapeutically for the treatment of hypercalcemia or osteoporosis. In a recent clinical study, subcutaneous injections of calcitonin have reduced the incidence of fractures and reduced the decrease in bone mass in women with type 2 diabetes complicated with osteoporosis. Subcutaneous injections of calcitonin in patients suffering from mania resulted in significant decreases in irritability, euphoria and hyperactivity and hence calcitonin holds promise for treating bipolar disorder. However no further work on this potential application of calcitonin has been reported. Diagnostics It may be used diagnostically as a tumor marker for medullary thyroid cancer, in which high calcitonin levels may be present and elevated levels after surgery may indicate recurrence. It may even be used on biopsy samples from suspicious lesions (e.g., lymph nodes that are swollen) to establish whether they are metastases of the original cancer. Cutoffs for calcitonin to distinguish cases with medullary thyroid cancer have been suggested to be as follows, with a higher value increasing the suspicion of medullary thyroid cancer: *females: 5 ng/L or pg/mL *males: 12 ng/L or pg/mL *children under 6 months of age: 40 ng/L or pg/mL *children between 6 months and 3 years of age: 15 ng/L or pg/mL When over 3 years of age, adult cutoffs may be used Increased levels of calcitonin have also been reported for various other conditions. They include: C-cell hyperplasia, nonthyroidal oat cell carcinoma, nonthyroidal carcinoma and other nonthyroidal malignancies, acute kidney injury and chronic kidney failure, hypercalcemia, hypergastrinemia, and other gastrointestinal disorders, and pulmonary disease. Structure Calcitonin is a polypeptide hormone of 32 amino acids, with a molecular weight of 3454.93 daltons. Its structure comprises a single alpha helix. Alternative splicing of the gene coding for calcitonin produces a distantly related peptide of 37 amino acids, called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), beta type. The following are the amino acid sequences of salmon and human calcitonin: * salmon: Cys-Ser-Asn-Leu-Ser-Thr-Cys-Val-Leu- Gly-Lys-Leu-Ser-Gln-Glu-Leu-His-Lys-Leu-Gln-Thr-Tyr-Pro-Arg-Thr-Asn-Thr-Gly- Ser-Gly-Thr-Pro * human: Cys-Gly-Asn-Leu-Ser-Thr-Cys-Met-Leu-Gly-Thr-Tyr-Thr- Gln-Asp-Phe-Asn-Lys-Phe-His-Thr-Phe-Pro-Gln-Thr-Ala-Ile-Gly-Val-Gly-Ala-Pro Compared to salmon calcitonin, human calcitonin differs at 16 residues.

Birthday cakes are often layer cakes with frosting served with small lit candles on top representing the celebrant's age. Variations include cupcakes, cake pops, pastries, and tarts. The cake is often decorated with birthday wishes (\\"Happy birthday\\") and the celebrant's name. History The Birthday Cake by 19th- century German genre painter . Birthday cakes have been a part of birthday celebrations in Western European countries since the middle of the 19th century. However, the link between cakes and birthday celebrations may date back to ancient Roman times. In classical Roman culture, 'cakes' were occasionally served at special birthdays and at weddings. These were flat circles made from flour and nuts, leavened with yeast, and sweetened with honey. In the 15th century, bakeries in Germany began to market one-layer cakes for customers' birthdays in addition to cakes for weddings. During the 17th century, the birthday cake took on its contemporary form. These elaborate 17th century cakes had many aspects of the contemporary birthday cake, like multiple layers, icing, and decorations. However, these cakes were only available to the very wealthy. Birthday cakes became accessible to the lower class as a result of the industrial revolution and the spread of more materials and goods. Contemporary rites Child with Snow White Cake, circa 1930‚Äì1940 The cake, pastry, or dessert is served to a person on their birthday. In contemporary Western cultures, the cake is topped with one or more lit candles, which the celebrated individual attempts to blow out. There is no standard for birthday cakes, though the \\"Happy Birthday\\" song is often sung while the cake is served in English-speaking countries, or an equivalent birthday song in the appropriate language of the country. The phrase \\"happy birthday\\" did not appear on birthday cakes until the song \\"Happy Birthday to You\\" was popularized in the early 1900s. Variations of birthday songs and rituals exist in different parts of the world. In Uruguay, party guests touch the person's shoulder or head following the singing of \\"Happy Birthday to You\\". In Ecuador, the person whose birthday it is will take a large bite of the birthday cake before it is served. In Peru, guests used to sing \\"Happy Birthday to You\\" first in English with the name of the individual whose birthday it is, then in Spanish, later they sing any other song in Spanish regarding cake or date, finally blowing candles and serving the cake. The birthday cake is often decorated with small candles, secured with special holders or simply pressed down into the cake. The cake can also be served with other sweets such as ice cream. In the UK, North America and Australia, the number of candles is equal to the age of the individual whose birthday it is, sometimes with one extra for luck. Traditionally, the person whose birthday it is makes a wish, which is thought to come true if all the candles are extinguished in a single breath. To represent a sharing of joy and a sense of togetherness, the cake is shared amongst all the guests attending the party. Candles and theories of origin Modern Celebration Candles. In many cultures the person whose birthday is being celebrated is invited to make a wish, and blow out candles. Though the exact origin and significance of this ritual is unknown, there are multiple theories which try to explain this tradition. Greek origin story One theory explaining the tradition of placing candles on birthday cakes is attributed to the early Greeks, who used candles to honor the goddess Artemis' birth on the sixth day of every lunar month. The link between her oversight of fertility and the birthday tradition of candles on cakes, however, has not been established. Pagan origin story Kinder Fest. The use of fire in certain rites dates back to the creation of altars. Birthday candles are said to hold symbolic power.(The Lore of Birthdays (New York, 1952), Ralph and Adelin Linton, pp. 8, 18-20.) In the past it was believed that evil spirits visited people on their birthdays and that, to protect the person whose birthday it was from evil, people must surround the individual and make them merry. Party-goers made noise to scare away evil spirits. German origin story Girls with birthday cake. Postcard from 1920. In 18th century Germany, the history of candles on cakes can be traced back to Kinderfest, a birthday celebration for children. This tradition also makes use of candles and cakes. German children were taken to an auditorium-like space. There, they were free to celebrate another year in a place where Germans believed that adults protected children from the evil spirits attempting to steal their souls. In those times there was no tradition of bringing gifts to a birthday; guests would merely bring good wishes for the birthday person. However, if a guest did bring gifts it was considered to be a good sign for the person whose birthday it was. Later, flowers became quite popular as a birthday gift. * In 1746, a large birthday festival was held for Count Ludwig von Zinzendorf at Marienborn near B√ºdingen. Andrew Frey described the party in detail and mentions, \\"there was a Cake as large as any Oven could be found to bake it, and Holes made in the Cake according to the Years of the Person‚Äôs Age, every one having a Candle stuck into it, and one in the Middle.\\" * Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, having spent 24-30 August 1801 in Gotha as a guest of Prince August of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, recounts of his 52nd birthday on 28 August: \\"... when it was time for dessert, the prince's entire livery in full regalia entered, led by the majordomo. He carried a generous-size torte with colorful flaming candles - amounting to some fifty candles - that began to melt and threatened to burn down, instead of there being enough room for candles indicating upcoming years, as is the case with children's festivities of this kind.\\"Shirley Cherkasky: Birthday Cakes and Candles, p. 220 books.google. \\"Meinen eintretenden Geburtstag wollte man mit gn√§diger Aufmerksamkeit bei einem solchen geschlossenen Mahle feiern; schon an den gew√∂hnlichen G√§ngen sah man einigen Unterschied; beim Nachtisch aber trat nun die s√§mtliche Livree des Prinzen in stattlich gekleidetem Zug herein, voran der Haushofmeister; dieser trug eine gro√üe, von bunten Wachsst√∂cken flammende Torte, deren ins Halbhundert sich belaufende Anzahl einander zu schmelzen und zu verzehren drohte, anstatt da√ü bei Kinderfeierlichkeiten der Art noch Raum genug f√ºr n√§chstfolgende Lebenskerzen √ºbrigbleibt.\\" Goethe's Tag- und Jahreshefte 1801 http://www.zeno.org/nid/20004859979 As the excerpt indicates, the tradition at the time was to place one candle on the cake for each year of the individual's life, so that the number of candles on top of the cake would represent the age which some one had reached; sometimes a birthday cake would have some added candles 'indicating upcoming years.' Swiss origin story A reference to the tradition of blowing out the candles was documented in Switzerland in 1881. Researchers for the Folk-Lore Journal recorded various \\"superstitions\\" among the Swiss middle class. One statement depicted a birthday cake as having lighted candles which correspond to each year of life. These candles were required to be blown out, individually, by the person who is being celebrated. Bacteriology In June 2017 researchers at Clemson University reported that some individuals deposit a large number of bacteria on the cake. Birthday cakes in different cultures There are many variations of sweets which are eaten around the world on birthdays. The Chinese birthday pastry is the sh√≤u bƒÅo (Â£ΩÂåÖ, simp. ÂØøÂåÖ) or sh√≤u t√°o bƒÅo (Â£ΩÊ°ÉÂåÖ, simp. ÂØøÊ°ÉÂåÖ), a lotus-paste-filled bun made of wheat flour and shaped and colored to resemble a peach. Rather than serving one large pastry, each guest is served their own small shou bao. In Western Russia, birthday children are served fruit pies with a birthday greeting carved into the crusts. The Swedish birthday cake is made like a pound cake that is often topped with marzipan and decorated with the national flag. Dutch birthday pastries are fruit tarts topped with whipped cream. In India there are very few people who use birth celebration in villages, but in cities and towns, birthday cakes are used similarly as in western countries, especially among people with higher education.

It is a museum of \\"architecture, design, engineering, construction, and urban planning\\". It was created by an act of Congress in 1980, and is a private non- profit institution; it is adjacent to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial and the Judiciary Square Metro station. The museum hosts various temporary exhibits in galleries around the spacious Great Hall. The building, completed in 1887, served as the Pension Building, housing the United States Pension Bureau, and hosted several presidential inaugural balls. It is an important early large-scale example of Renaissance Revival architecture, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985. Pension Building The National Building Museum is housed in the former Pension Bureau building, a brick structure completed in 1887 and designed by Montgomery C. Meigs, the U.S. Army quartermaster general. It is notable for several architectural features, including the spectacular interior columns and a frieze, sculpted by Caspar Buberl, stretching around the exterior of the building and depicting Civil War soldiers in scenes somewhat reminiscent of those on Trajan's Column as well as the Horsemen Frieze of the Parthenon. The vast interior, measuring 316 √ó 116 feet (96 √ó 35 m), has been used to hold inauguration balls; a Presidential Seal is set into the floor near the south entrance. Interior of the Pension Office, ca. 1918 After the Civil War, the United States Congress passed legislation that greatly extended the scope of pension coverage for veterans and their survivors and dependents, notably their widows and orphans. The number of staff needed to implement and administer the new benefits system ballooned to over 1,500, and quickly required a new building from which to run it all. Meigs was chosen to design and construct the new building. He departed from the established Greco-Roman models that had been the basis of government buildings in Washington, D.C., until then and which continued after the Pension Building's completion. Meigs based his design on Italian Renaissance precedents, notably Rome's Palazzo Farnese and the Palazzo della Cancelleria. The National Building Museum's Corinthian columns are among the largest in the world measuring 75 ft. (23 m) tall and 8 ft. (2.4 m) in diameter Included in his design was a frieze sculpted by Caspar Buberl. Because a sculpture of that size was well out of Meigs's budget, he had Buberl create 28 different scenes, totaling 69 feet (21 m) in length, which were then mixed and slightly modified to create the continuous 1,200-foot (365-m) parade of over 1,300 figures. Because of the 28 sections' modification and mixture, it is only in careful examination that the frieze is seen to be the same figures repeated several times. The sculpture includes infantry, navy, artillery, cavalry, and medical components, as well as a good deal of the supply and quartermaster functions, for it was in that capacity that Meigs had served during the Civil War. Meigs's correspondence with Buberl reveals that Meigs insisted that a black teamster, who \\"must be a negro, a plantation slave, freed by war\\", be included in the quartermaster panel. This figure was ultimately to assume a central position, over the building's west entrance. Built before modern artificial ventilation, the building was designed to maximize air circulation: all offices not only had exterior windows, but also opened onto the court, which was designed to admit cool air at ground level and exhaust hot air at the roof. Made of brick and tile, the stairs were designed for the limitations of disabled and aging veterans, having a gradual ascent with low steps. In addition, each step slanted slightly from back to front to allow easy drainage: a flight could be washed easily by pouring water from the top. When Philip Sheridan was asked to comment on the building, his biting reply echoed the negative sentiment of much of the Washington establishment of the day: \\"Too bad the damn thing is fireproof.\\" A similar quote is also attributed to William Tecumseh Sherman, perhaps casting doubt on the truth of the Sheridan tale. The completed building, sometimes called \\"Meigs Old Red Barn\\", required more than 15 million bricks,National Building Museum Web Site retrieved June 27, 2010 which, according to the wit of the day, were each counted by the parsimonious Meigs. Becoming a museum Logo of the National Building Museum, 2012 The building was used for federal government offices until the 1960s when it had fallen into a state of disrepair and was considered for demolition. After pressure from conservationists, the government commissioned a report by architect Chloethiel Woodard Smith of possible other uses for the building. Her 1967 report suggested a museum dedicated to the building arts. The building was then listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. In 1980, Congress created the National Building Museum as a private, non-profit institution. The building itself was formally renamed the National Building Museum in 1997. Every year, the annual Christmas in Washington program was filmed at the museum, with the President and First Lady until the show's cancellation in 2015. Museum Shop The National Building Museum Shop was honored in 2007 as the \\"Best Museum Store\\" in the country by Niche magazine, \\"Best All-Around Museum Shop\\" in the region by The Washington Post, a \\"Top Shop\\" by the Washingtonian, and named best museum shop in D.C. by National Geographic Traveler's blog, Intelligent Travel, in July 2009. In 2010, The Huffington Post included the National Building Museum in a story, \\"Museums with Amazing Gift Shops\\". The Museum Shop sells books about the built environment and an array of housewares, educational toys, watches, and items for an office, all with an emphasis on design. American politics On June 7, 2008, Hillary Clinton suspended her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination with a farewell rally inside the museum. Several of Clinton's most recognized quotes and sayings were first spoken on this date to several hundreds of supporters, including \\"If we can blast fifty women into space, we will someday launch a woman into the White House.\\"The Washington Post. \\"44 - Clinton's Last Hurrah.\\" Anne E. Kornblut. 7 June 2008. Retrieved May 12, 2012. Awards The National Building Museum presents three annual awards: the Honor Award for individuals and organizations who have made important contributions to the U.S.'s building heritage; the Vincent Scully Prize, which honors exemplary practice, scholarship, or criticism in architecture, historic preservation, and urban design; and the Henry C. Turner Prize for Innovation in Construction Technology, which recognizes outstanding leadership and innovation in the field of construction methods and processes. Outreach programs Investigating Where We Live Investigating Where We Live is a summer program for teens from the DC metropolitan area. Students spend four weeks in teams equipped with cameras, and sketchbooks to discover the local communities. Students are given an introduction to photography and then investigate neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. Documenting history, landmarks, and residential areas, students assemble the community's identity. The original photographs and writings are incorporated into an exhibition at the Museum. Since 1996, more than 500 students have participated in learning about different communities within the District of Columbia. Upon completion of the program, participants: * Receive a digital camera * Develop relationships with professional photographers, designers, museum staff, and fellow participants * Keep photographs for use in future projects, portfolios, or high school and college applications * Fulfill community service requirements for school Previous exhibits include \\"Investigating Where We Live: Recapturing Shaw's Legacy\\" which taught high school students about DC's Shaw neighborhood.

Kiwibank Limited is a subsidiary of the state-owned enterprise New Zealand Post Limited, New Zealand Superannuation and the Accident Compensation Corporation. Kiwibank provides some of its banking services through its PostShops (post offices) and more recently through financial services only branches as well. Kiwibank is owned by the New Zealand Government, with New Zealand Post owning 51% and the Accident Compensation Corporation and New Zealand Superannuation Fund owning the other 49%. The company's Board of Directors was chaired by former New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger from 2001‚Äì2010. The current Chair of the Board of Directors is Jon Hartley. https://www.kiwibank.co.nz/about-us/who-we-are/our-leaders/  History =Earlier state-owned banks Kiwibank is similar in many respects to an earlier post office-based bank owned by the New Zealand Government. The New Zealand Post Office Bank was established in 1867. In 1987, the bank was corporatised and separated from New Zealand Post and Telecom New Zealand to form a stand-alone company ‚Äì PostBank. Then in 1989 PostBank was sold by the government to ANZ. Establishment period (2002‚Äì2010) The bank originated from Alliance Party policy during the 1999‚Äî2002 term of the Labour- led coalition government. Jim Anderton revealed in his valedictory speech that after the issue had previously been discussed by cabinet for months, he had spent three hours trying to convince then Finance Minister Michael Cullen, Annette King told Cullen: \\"Michael, Jim's beaten back every argument against the bank we've ever put up. For God's sake, give him the bloody bank.\\" Cullen replied: \\"Oh, all right then.\\" Kiwibank launched in 2002 with 211 branches open nationwide by 30 June. In 2008, one analysis saw Kiwibank as having fostered a new level of competition in banking in New Zealand in terms of lower fees and growth in service. As of 2007, Kiwibank had higher customer- satisfaction ratings than the four large Australian-owned trading-banks. The Palms shopping centre in Shirley, Christchurch In 2008 Kiwibank unveiled an advertising campaign, \\"Join The Movement\\", which portrayed foreign-owned competitors as enemy occupiers. The New Zealand Herald called the campaign \\"jingoistic\\".  2010‚Äìpresent day  Kiwibank announced an after tax profit of $21.2 million for the year ended 30 June 2011. In 2012 Kiwibank celebrated its ten-year birthday. The advertising campaign used 10-year-old Kiwis pledging what they're standing up for with New Zealand artist Neil Finn agreeing to the use of his song \\"Can you hear us?\\" re-recorded by Jeremy Redmore of Midnight Youth. It was the first time the artist had allowed one of his tracks to be used by a commercial entity. The proceeds from the first 20,000 downloads of the soundtrack went to the NZ Music Foundation of which Neil is patron. In 2012, the bank also released an iPhone mobile banking app, following the roll out of a redesigned Kiwibank website. Standard & Poor lowered Kiwibank's credit rating one level from AA- to A+ (outlook stable) and Kiwibank reported a record after tax profit of $79.1 million for the year ended 30 June 2012. In 2014, Kiwibank launched its \\"Independence\\" advertising campaign where it \\"compares itself to anyone who has ever immigrated to New Zealand\\". In 2016, New Zealand Post announced a successful completion of the sale of 47 percent of Kiwibank to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (25 percent) and the Accident Compensation Corporation (22 percent). The $494 million deal values KGHL at $1,050 million and retains NZ Post as the majority owner of Kiwibank as well as keeping the bank fully New Zealand owned.

The 2018 Kiwibank FinTech Accelerator three month business growth programme resulted in seven start ups and was also supported by Xero, MasterCard and Microsoft. The businesses were: AccountingPod, Tapi (formally FlatFish), Liberac, Sharesies, Teddy, Wicket and a Xero team. In July 2019 the Kiwibank FinTech Accelerator intake included BankEngine, Cove Insurance, and Miuwi.  Corporate Social Responsibility  Kiwibank is the major sponsor of the New Zealander of the Year Awards A partnership with the children's financial literacy provider Banqer was formally launched in May 2016, setting the one-year goal at 1000 classrooms being sponsored into the programme. This was achieved by April 2017 but the programme continues to grow. In 2016 Kiwibank announced a partnership with the Predator Free New Zealand Trust and the Department of Conservation (DOC). Kiwibank worked with PFNZ to establish the Kiwibank Predator Free Communities Programme which works with communities wanting to take up the predator-free challenge. The DOC partnership is centered around the Conservation Dogs programme which piloted New Zealand's first specialist conservation dog unit with two full-time dog handlers. At the time there were 80 conservation dogs in New Zealand, 45 of whom find protected species and 35 who find pests.

He was born in the Velikiye Luki district, Pskov Oblast. He graduated from the University of St. Petersburg, where in 1920 he became a Professor. From 1934 he was a Director of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics, a position he held for the rest of his life, except for the five-year period (1941-1946) when the institute was directed by Academician Sergei Sobolev. In 1941 he was awarded the Stalin Prize. In 1951 he became a foreign member of the Polish Academy of Sciences and Letters in Krak√≥w. Mathematical contributions In analytic number theory, Vinogradov's method refers to his main problem-solving technique, applied to central questions involving the estimation of exponential sums. In its most basic form, it is used to estimate sums over prime numbers, or Weyl sums. It is a reduction from a complicated sum to a number of smaller sums which are then simplified. The canonical form for prime number sums is :S=\\\\sum_{p\\\\le P}\\\\exp(2\\\\pi i f(p)). With the help of this method, Vinogradov tackled questions such as the ternary Goldbach problem in 1937 (using Vinogradov's theorem), and the zero-free region for the Riemann zeta function. His own use of it was inimitable; in terms of later techniques, it is recognised as a prototype of the large sieve method in its application of bilinear forms, and also as an exploitation of combinatorial structure. In some cases his results resisted improvement for decades. He also used this technique on the Dirichlet divisor problem, allowing him to estimate the number of integer points under an arbitrary curve. This was an improvement on the work of Georgy Voronoy. In 1918 Vinogradov proved the P√≥lya‚ÄìVinogradov inequality for character sums.  Personality and career  Vinogradov served as director of the Mathematical Institute for 49 years. For his long service he was twice awarded the order of The Hero of the Socialist Labour. The house where he was born was converted into his memorial ‚Äì a unique honour among Russian mathematicians. As the head of a leading mathematical institute, Vinogradov enjoyed significant influence in the Academy of Sciences and was regarded as an informal leader of Soviet mathematicians, not always in a positive way: his anti-Semitic feelings led him to hinder the careers of many prominent Soviet mathematicians. Although he was always faithful to the official line, he was never a member of the Communist Party and his overall mindset was nationalistic rather than communist. This can at least partly be attributed to his origins: his father was a priest of the Russian Orthodox Church. Vinogradov was enormously strong: in some recollections it is stated that he could lift a chair with a person sitting on it by holding the leg of the chair in his hands. He was never married and was very attached to his dacha in Abramtsevo, where he spent all his weekends and vacations (together with his sister Nadezhda, also unmarried) enjoying flower gardening. He had friendly relations with the president of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mstislav Keldysh and Mikhail Lavrentyev, both mathematicians whose careers started in his institute.

The first paperback edition was published under the alternative title of Ryan's Rules. Ernest Stickley, Jr. reappears in Stick. Plot summary Frank Ryan is an almost honest used car salesman, who after deliberately not testifying against car thief Ernest \\"Stick\\" Stickley, Jr., thinks of a foolproof plan for them to perform armed robberies. The plan is about simple everyday armed robbery. Supermarkets, bars, liquor stores, gas stations, etc. Because the statistics prove that this armed robbery pays the most for the least amount of risk, they start their business and earn three to five thousand dollars a week. To prevent getting caught Frank introduces 10 golden rules for successful armed robbery: # Always be polite on the job and say please and thank you. # Never say more than necessary. Less is more. # Never call your partner by name-unless you use a made-up name. # Never look suspicious or like a bum and dress well. # Never use your own car. # Never count the take in the car. # Never flash money in a bar or with women. # Never go back to an old bar or hangout once you have moved up. # Never tell anyone your business and never tell a junkie even your name. # Never associate with people known to be in crime. For a while, Frank and Stick are able to follow the rules and the plan and they are extremely successful. They even rob the robber who just robbed the bar they were in. But, inevitably, the rules start falling by the wayside and when they see a chance for a big score, the rules go out the window, with predictably disastrous results.

Many of his novels involve the detective hero Kogoro Akechi, who in later books was the leader of a group of boy detectives known as the . Ranpo was an admirer of Western mystery writers, and especially of Edgar Allan Poe. His pen name is a rendering of Poe's name.\\"Edgar Allan Poe\\" ‚Üí„Äå„Ç®„Éâ„Ç¨„Éº„Éª„Ç¢„É©„É≥„Éª„Éù„Éº(\\"Edogaa aran poo\\")„Äç‚Üí\\"Edogaaaranpo\\"‚Üí\\"Edogawa ranpo\\"(„Åà„Å©„Åå„Çè„Éª„Çâ„Çì„ÅΩ)‚ÜíÊ±üÊà∏Â∑ù‰π±Ê≠©Ôºé The Edo River (in Japanese, Edogawa) empties into Tokyo Bay. Rampo means \\"random walk\\". Other authors who were special influences on him were Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, whom he attempted to translate into Japanese during his days as a student at Waseda University, and the Japanese mystery writer Ruik≈ç Kuroiwa. Biography=Before World War II Tar≈ç Hirai was born in Nabari, Mie Prefecture in 1894, where his grandfather had been a samurai in the service of Tsu Domain. The family moved to what is now Kameyama, Mie, and from there to Nagoya when he was age two. He studied economics at Waseda University starting in 1912. After graduating in 1916 with a degree in economics he worked a series of odd jobs, including newspaper editing, drawing cartoons for magazine publications, selling soba noodles as a street vendor, and working in a used bookstore. In 1923 he made his literary debut by publishing the mystery story under the pen name \\"Edogawa Ranpo\\" (pronounced quickly, this humorous pseudonym sounds much like the name of the American pioneer of detective fiction, Edgar Allan Poe, whom he admired). The story appeared in the magazine Shin Seinen, a popular magazine written largely for an adolescent audience. Shin Seinen had previously published stories by a variety of Western authors including Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, and G. K. Chesterton, but this was the first time the magazine published a major piece of mystery fiction by a Japanese author. Some, such as James B. Harris (Ranpo's first translator into English), have erroneously called this the first piece of modern mystery fiction by a Japanese writer, but well before Ranpo entered the literary scene in 1923, a number of other modern Japanese authors such as Ruik≈ç Kuroiwa, Kid≈ç Okamoto, Jun'ichir≈ç Tanizaki, Haruo Sat≈ç, and Kaita Murayama had incorporated elements of sleuthing, mystery, and crime within stories involving adventure, intrigue, the bizarre, and the grotesque.Angles, Writing the Love of Boys, pp. 159-160. What struck critics as new about Ranpo‚Äôs debut story \\"The Two-Sen Copper Coin\\" was that it focused on the logical process of ratiocination used to solve a mystery within a story that is closely related to Japanese culture.Kozakai Fuboku, \\"'Ni-sen d≈çka' o yomu\\", Shin seinen 4.5 (Apr 1923): 264-65. The story involves an extensive description of an ingenious code based on a Buddhist chant known as the \\"nenbutsu\\" as well as Japanese-language Braille.Edogawa, \\"The Two-Sen Copper Coin\\", pp. 270-271. Over the course of the next several years, Edogawa went on to write a number of other stories that focus on crimes and the processes involved in solving them. Among these stories are a number of stories that are now considered classics of early 20th-century Japanese popular literature: , which is about a woman who is killed in the course of a sadomasochistic extramarital affair,Edogawa, Ranpo. \\"D-zaka no Satsujin Jiken.\\" Shinseinen Jan 1925 special ed.: 26-27. , which is about a man who kills a neighbor in a Tokyo boarding house by dropping poison through a hole in the attic floor into his mouth,Translated in Edogawa, The Edogawa Rampo Reader. and , which is about a man who hides himself in a chair to feel the bodies on top of him.Translated in Edogawa, Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination. Mirrors, lenses, and other optical devices appear in many of Edogawa's other early stories, such as \\"The Hell of Mirrors\\". Although many of his first stories were primarily about sleuthing and the processes used in solving seemingly insolvable crimes, during the 1930s, he began to turn increasingly to stories that involved a combination of sensibilities often called \\"ero guro nansensu\\", from the three words \\"eroticism, grotesquerie, and the nonsensical\\". The presence of these sensibilities helped him sell his stories to the public, which was increasingly eager to read his work. One finds in these stories a frequent tendency to incorporate elements of what the Japanese at that time called . For instance, a major portion of the plot of the novel , serialized from January 1929 to February 1930 in the journal , involves a homosexual doctor and his infatuation for another main character.Angles, Writing the Love of Boys, pp. 201-224. By the 1930s, Edogawa was writing regularly for a number of major public journals of popular literature, and he had emerged as the foremost voice of Japanese mystery fiction. The detective hero Kogor≈ç Akechi, who had first appeared in the story \\"The Case of the Murder on D. Hill\\" became a regular feature in his stories, a number of which pitted him against a dastardly criminal known as the , who had an incredible ability to disguise himself and move throughout society. (A number of these novels were subsequently made into films.) The 1930 novel introduced the adolescent as Kogoro's sidekick, and in the period after World War II, Edogawa wrote a number of novels for young readers that involved Kogoro and Kobayashi as the leaders of a group of young sleuths called the . These works were wildly popular and are still read by many young Japanese readers, much like the Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew mysteries are popular mysteries for adolescents in the English-speaking world. During World War II In 1939, two years after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Edogawa was ordered by government censors to drop his story , which he had published without incident a few years before, from a collection of his short stories that the publisher Shun'y≈çd≈ç was reprinting. \\"The Caterpillar\\" is about a veteran who was turned into a quadriplegic and so disfigured by war that he was little more than a human \\"caterpillar\\", unable to talk, move, or live by himself. Censors banned the story, apparently believing that the story would detract from the current war effort. This came as a blow to Ranpo, who relied on royalties from reprints for income. (The short story inspired director K≈çji Wakamatsu, who drew from it his movie Caterpillar, which competed for the Golden Bear at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival.) Over the course of World War II, especially during the full-fledged war between Japan and the US that began after in 1941, Edogawa was active in his local neighborhood organization, and he wrote a number of stories about young detectives and sleuths that might be seen as in line with the war effort, but he wrote most of these under different pseudonyms as if to disassociate them with his legacy. In February 1945, his family was evacuated from their home in Ikebukuro, Tokyo to Fukushima in northern Japan. Edogawa remained until June, when he was suffering from malnutrition. Much of Ikebukuro was destroyed in Allied air raids and the subsequent fires that broke out in the city, but miraculously, the thick, earthen-walled warehouse which he used as his studio was spared, and still stands to this day beside the campus of Rikkyo University. Postwar In the postwar period, Edogawa dedicated a great deal of energy to promoting mystery fiction, both in terms of the understanding of its history and encouraging the production of new mystery fiction. In 1946, he put his support behind a new journal called dedicated to mystery fiction, and in 1947, he founded the , which changed its name in 1963 to the . In addition, he wrote a large number of articles about the history of Japanese, European, and American mystery fiction. Many of these essays were published in book form. Other than essays, much of his postwar literary production consisted largely of novels for juvenile readers featuring Kogor≈ç Akechi and the Boy Detectives Club. In the 1950s, he and a bilingual translator collaborated for five years on a translation of Edogawa's works into English, published as Japanese Tales of Mystery and Imagination by Tuttle. Since the translator could speak but not read Japanese, and Edogawa could read but not write English, the translation was done aurally, with Edogawa reading each sentence aloud, then checking the written English. Another of his interests, especially during the late 1940s and 1950s, was bringing attention to the work of his dear friend Jun'ichi Iwata (1900‚Äì1945), an anthropologist who had spent many years researching the history of homosexuality in Japan. During the 1930s, Edogawa and Iwata had engaged in a light-hearted competition to see who could find the most books about erotic desire between men. Edogawa dedicated himself to finding books published in the West and Iwata dedicated himself to finding books having to do with Japan. Iwata died in 1945, with only part of his work published, so Edogawa worked to have the remaining work on queer historiography published.Angles, Writing the Love of Boys, pp. 226-267. In the postwar period, a large number of Edogawa's books were made into films. The interest in using Edogawa's literature as a departure point for creating films has continued well after his death. Edogawa, who suffered from a variety of health issues, including atherosclerosis and Parkinson's disease, died from a cerebral hemorrhage at his home in 1965. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Fuchu, near Tokyo. The Edogawa Rampo Prize (Ê±üÊà∏Â∑ù‰π±Ê≠©Ë≥û Edogawa Ranpo Sh≈ç?), named after Edogawa Rampo, is a Japanese literary award which has been presented every year by the Mystery Writers of Japan since 1955.

Beatboxing today is connected with hip-hop culture, often referred to as \\"the fifth element\\" of hip-hop, although it is not limited to hip-hop music.The History of Beatboxing, humanbeatbox.comD. Stowell and M. D. Plumbley, Characteristics of the beatboxing vocal style . Technical Report C4DM-TR-08-01. 2008. The term \\"beatboxing\\" is sometimes used to refer to vocal percussion in general. History=Origins Techniques similar to beatboxing have been present in many American musical genres since the 19th century, such as early rural music, both black and white, religious songs, blues, ragtime, vaudeville, and hokum. Examples include the Appalachian technique of eefing and the blues song Bye bye bird by Sonny Boy Williamson II. Additional influences may perhaps include forms of African traditional music, in which performers utilize their bodies (e.g., by clapping or stomping) as percussion instruments and produce sounds with their mouths by breathing loudly in and out, a technique used in beatboxing today. Many well- known performers used vocal percussion occasionally, even though this was not directly connected to the cultural tradition that came to be known as beatboxing. Paul McCartney's \\"That Would Be Something\\" (1969) includes vocal percussion. Pink Floyd's \\"Pow R. Toc H.\\" (1967) also includes vocal percussion performed by the group's lead vocalist, Syd Barrett. Jazz singers Bobby McFerrin and Al Jarreau were very well known for their vocal styles and techniques, which have had great impact on techniques beatboxers use today. Michael Jackson was known to record himself beatboxing on a dictation tape recorder as a demo and scratch recording to compose several of his songs, including \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", and others. Jackson beatboxes while explaining how he composed \\"Tabloid Junkie\\", \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", \\"Who Is It\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", and \\"Streetwalker\\" (song on the Bad album 2001 Special Edition) Gert Fr√∂be, a German actor most widely known for playing Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film Goldfinger, \\"beatboxes\\" as Colonel Manfred von Holstein (simultaneously vocalizing horned and percussive instruments) in Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines, a 1965 British comedy film. Contribution to hip-hop The term \\"beatboxing\\" is derived from the mimicry of early drum machines, then known as beatboxes, particularly the Roland TR-808. The term \\"beatbox\\" was used to refer to earlier Roland drum machines such as the TR-55 and CR-78 in the 1970s.HISTORY OF BEATBOX: OLD SCHOOL, Human Beatbox They were followed by the TR-808, released in 1980, which became central to hip hop music and electronic dance music. It is the TR-808 that human beatboxing is largely modeled after. \\"Human beatboxing\\" in hip-hop originated in the 1980s. Its early pioneers include Doug E. Fresh, the self-proclaimed first \\"human beatbox\\"; Swifty, the first to implement the inhale sound technique; Buffy, who helped perfect many beatboxing techniques; and Wise, who contributed significantly to beat boxing's proliferation. Wise inspired an entire new fan base of human beatboxers with his human turntable technique. Other pioneers of beatboxing include Rahzel well known for his realistic robotic sounds and for his ability to sing and beatbox simultaneously, Scratch a beatboxer and musician well known for further revolutionizing the use of vocal scratching in beatboxing, and Kenny Muhammad The Human Orchestra, a beatboxer known for his technicality and outstanding rhythmic precision, who pioneered the inward k snare, a beatbox technique that imitates a snare drum by breathing inward. Modern beatboxing An example of modern beatboxing Biz Markie beatboxing The Internet has played a large part in the popularity of modern beatboxing. Alex Tew (aka A-Plus) started the first online community of beatboxers in 2000 under the banner of HUMANBEATBOX.COM. An early example of modern beatboxing was seen in the 2001 South Korean romantic comedy film My Sassy Girl. In 2001, Gavin Tyte, a member of this community created the world's first tutorials and video tutorials on beatboxing. In 2003, the community held the world's first Human Beatbox Convention in London featuring beatbox artists from all over the world. Beatboxing's current popularity is due in part to releases from artists such as Rahzel, RoxorLoops, Reeps One, and Alem. In the Pacific, Jason Tom perpetuates the art of beatboxing through blogging, mathematics and motivational speaking in Honolulu, the westernmost and southernmost major U.S. city of the 50th U.S. state of Hawaii.Garfield, J. . 2002. A documentary on the history of the art form, including interviews with Doug E. Fresh, Emanon, Biz Markie, Marie Daulne of Zap Mama, Kyle Faustino, and others. Sometimes, modern beatboxers will use their hand or another part of their body to extend the spectrum of sound effects and rhythm. Some have developed a technique that involves blowing and sucking air around their fingers to produce a very realistic record scratching noise, which is commonly known as the \\"crab scratch.\\" Another hand technique includes the \\"throat tap,\\" which involves beatboxers tapping their fingers against their throats as they throat sing or hum. Beat boxers these days can produce up to 8 different sounds at the same time. Today there is an increase in the variety in which we see beatboxing throughout musical culture. People have gone as far as adding beatboxing in with different instruments to create a completely different sound unlike any other. Artist Greg Patillo goes as far as adding in beatboxing while playing the flute to very iconic songs. Beatbox has become modernized and has even been seen in popular movies such as Pitch Perfect and Pitch Perfect 2. These movies showcase classical songs performed with a cappella covers in which all of the beats to the songs are done completely using the idea and technique of beatboxing to complete the sound capable to imitate the original song. Notation As with other musical disciplines, some form of musical notation or transcription may sometimes be useful in order to describe beatbox patterns or performances. Sometimes this takes the form of ad hoc phonetic approximations, but is occasionally more formal. is usually the bass drum, is usually the snare drum, and () is usually the hi-hat (in : ùÑÜb-ts-k-ts-b-ts-k- tsùÑá). Standard Beatbox Notation (SBN) was created by Mark Splinter and Gavin TyteTyTe. \\"Standard Beatbox Notation\\". HumanBeatBox.com. of Humanbeatbox.com in 2006 as an alternative to International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription, which had been used sparingly before then. In a research study published in 2013 and based on real-time MRI imaging of a beatboxer, the authors propose a notation system which combines the International Phonetic Alphabet with musical staff notation, in part motivated by their observation that many beatboxing sounds can be adequately represented by the IPA.  Phonology  Each beatboxer can produce a very large number of unique sounds, but there are three distinct linguistic categories of sound within beatboxing. Ejectives are the strong puffs of air from the voicebox that give intensity to percussive sounds. The \\"t\\", \\"p\\", \\"k\\", \\"d\\", \\"b\\" and \\"g\\" sounds can all be made into ejectives. ‚ÄúCh‚Äù and ‚Äúj‚Äù are examples of ejective affricates. Nonstandard fricatives are the mechanical sounds such as snare drums, cymbals, and other buzzing noises in beatboxing that are made with fricatives. Certain sounds, such as velar lateral fricatives, bilabial lateral fricatives, and linguolabial fricatives, are all judged impossible according to the IPA but are technically possible and are sounds that are commonly used in beatboxing. Coarticulation is the act of controlling a sound in two places at once. A common example of this is the sound created by rolling an ‚Äúr‚Äù sound while saying a ‚Äúv‚Äù sound. This is called a voiced alveolar trill with labiodental articulation. Similarly, epenthesis is the sound created when beatboxers sing and do percussion at the same time. Contrary to what the sound suggests, their tongue is not in two places at once. This effect is created by placing percussive sounds in the middle of words. Multi-vocalism Multi-vocalism is a form of vocal musicianship conceptualized by British Beatboxer and vocalist Killa Kela. It describes Beatboxers who incorporate other vocal disciplines and practices into their routines and performances such as singing, rapping, sound mimicry and other vocal arts. Beardyman is a well known multi-vocalist. World records According to the Guinness World Records, the current record for the largest human beatbox ensemble was set by Booking.com employees. The record involved 4,659 participants and was achieved by Booking.com employees together with beatboxers at the RAI Amsterdam in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on 10 December 2013 during their annual company meeting. The previous largest human beatbox ensemble involved 2,081 participants and was achieved by Google (Ireland), Shlomo (UK) and Testament (UK) at The Convention Centre, Dublin, Ireland on 14 November 2011. Before Shlomo's record, the previous record for the largest human beatbox ensemble involved 1,246 participants and was achieved by Vineeth Vincent and Christ University (India) in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, on 5 February 2011.

Ron Hubbard. Hubbard died three months after the publication of volume 1, and other volumes were published posthumously. The series' initial publisher, Bridge Publications coined the word dekalogy, meaning \\"a series of ten books\\", to describe and promote the novel. Made up of about 1.2 million words, the epic is a \\"satirical science fiction adventure set in the far future.\\" Each volume in the series topped numerous bestseller lists. The second volume, Black Genesis, was nominated for the 1987 Hugo Award in the Best Novel category, but of the five finalists, it was voted in sixth place, after \\"No Award\\". Plot The Voltars want to conquer the planet Earth as a base for their planned invasion of the galactic centre. The Voltars are convinced that Earth is about to destroy itself through pollution and possibly war, which would disrupt the future timetable of conquest. Fleet Combat Engineer Jettero Heller, a character of perfection, incorruptibility, and astonishing ability, is assigned to prevent the destruction of Earth. Reaching New York City, he investigates the problem, unaware that he is being tracked and that factions on Voltar want his mission to fail. Unknown to Heller, Earth is also the base of a secret operation conducted by the diabolically evil Lombar Hisst, Commander of the Apparatus, who seeks to usurp the Voltar throne. To gain control, Hisst has been importing illegal narcotic drugs from Earth to enslave the heads of government on Voltar. Hisst works to make Heller fail in his mission. Hisst assigns a stooge named Soltan Gris to supervise the mission to Earth, in order to sabotage it. Gris finds himself in possession of twelve tons of pure gold, which he tries to launder through a Swiss bank account and keep for himself; he becomes a prisoner of two man-hating lesbians who end up marrying him, but not before various tortures are inflicted upon him. He has terrible money and girlfriend troubles, and he hires a hit man who eventually targets him. Heller discovers a conspiracy headed by Delbert John Rockecenter who keeps the population of Earth sedated with drugs and rock and roll music. Heller's attempts to break the demonic control of Earth by Rockecenter make him a target, and the corporation uses its most dangerous weapons to destroy him: psychiatry and psychology, and a mad, idealistic public relations genius by the name of J. Walter Madison. Madison initiates a wide-reaching public relations campaign to make Heller known to the world as the \\"Whiz Kid\\", but results in destroying Heller's reputation so that all of Heller's efforts to save the planet come to naught, as Madison's employer, Rockecenter, wanted. Heller's outstanding skills and abilities are reinforced by the arrival on Earth of his fianc√©e, the Countess Krak, and the alliance and friendship of the Mafia‚Äîspecifically the Corleone family. After a series of world-shattering events, which include the impact of an ice meteor on the Soviet Union, the world's entire oil supply being turned radioactive, and a black hole orbiting the Earth, Heller returns to Voltar to find that not only have Hisst's plans to enslave the government nearly succeeded, but Madison is starting a galactic civil war. After the defeat of Hisst and Madison, a massive cover-up operation commences to wipe out the effects of PR, psychology and psychiatry. All mention of these subjects is censored and the planet Earth is eradicated from all star charts and similar items. As far as the Voltarans are concerned, planet Earth no longer exists.

Public reaction=Critical response The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction describes the series \\"whose farcical overemphases fail to disguise an overblown tale that would have been more at home in the dawn of pulp magazines.\\" The New York Times review of the first volume, The Invaders' Plan, describes it thus: \\"... a paralyzingly slow-moving adventure enlivened by interludes of kinky sex, sendups of effeminate homosexuals and a disregard of conventional grammar so global as to suggest a satire on the possibility of communication through language.\\" In L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology, a survey of Hubbard's literary career, Marco Frenschkowski of the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz described the Mission Earth series: :The satire is not humorous, but biting and harsh, which makes the novels not easy to read. Also Hubbard somehow had lost contact with developing narrative techniques: he writes exactly as he had done 40 years earlier. When read as entertainment Mission Earth is disappointing: it does not entertain. Many of the scenes (especially some sexual encounters) are incredibly grotesque, not in a pornographic sense, but they are violently aggressive about modern American ideals. The Mission Earth novels on the whole are a subversive, harsh, poignant attack on American society in the 1980s. As such they have so far received almost no attention, which perhaps they do deserve a bit more. They also have some quite interesting characters, especially when read with a deconstructionist approach. These 11 later novels by Hubbard are not Scientology literature, but have some topics in common, especially the very strong opposition against 20th century psychology and psychiatry, which is seen as a major source of evil. All open allusions to Scientology are strictly avoided. They are not as successful in their use of suspense and humour as Hubbard's early tales, but have to say perhaps more about the complex personality of their author. Censorship attempt In 1991, the town of Dalton, Georgia attempted to remove the Mission Earth books from its public library, citing what was described as \\"repeated passages involving chronic masochism, child abuse, homosexuality, necromancy, bloody murder, and other things that are anti-social, perverted, and anti- everything.\\" The attempt was unsuccessful, though this placed the Mission Earth series into the category of banned books that have been challenged in the United States. Bestseller designation The Mission Earth books were a major sales success, particularly the earlier volumes in the series, with all individual volumes reaching the New York Times bestseller list.New York Times bestseller list entries for the Mission Earth books: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 The extent to which this reflects actual popularity is questioned. A large number of booksellers, publishing executives, and former Scientologists state that, as with other Hubbard books, the Church of Scientology engaged in a massive book-buying campaign, similar to the campaign to promote Battlefield Earth, so as to deliberately inflate sales of the series in order to promote it as a best-selling work of literature. In a two-year span, Hubbard logged 14 consecutive books on the New York Times list. Adam Clymer, a New York Times executive, said that, while the books have been sold in sufficient numbers to justify their bestseller status, \\"we don't know to whom they were sold.\\" He said the newspaper uncovered no instances in which vast quantities of books were being sold to single individuals.

It measures about east- west by north-southGoogleEarth and occupies a total surface area of . It formed as sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age. The almost uniform flatness of the sea bottom and the presence of drainage channels (traceable to the mouths of island rivers) indicate that the Sunda Shelf was once a stable, dry, low-relief land area (peneplain) above which were left standing a few monadnocks (granite hills that by virtue of their resistance to erosion form the present islands).

Economic activities The southern section of the seafloor has long been recognized as geologically similar to northern Java, where oil fields occur and extend under the sea. Prospects are also favourable for oil fields in the waters off southeast Kalimantan. As the site of successful exploration for petroleum and natural gas, the Java Sea has become the basis of Indonesia's export program. Fishing is an important economic activity in the Java Sea. Over 3,000 species of marine life are found in the area. A number of national parks exist in the area such as Karimunjawa. The Thousand Islands are located north of the national capital Jakarta, and are the city's only regency. The area around the Java Sea is also a popular tourist destination.

The series aired on Rogers Television 22, a community channel in Ottawa, Ontario until 1996, when a single pilot episode was made for CBC Television. Then in 1997, \\"The Comedy Network\\" greenlit the show and it aired with them for 2 seasons from 1998-99. In January 1999, the show moved to the United States and aired on MTV. The series stopped production in March 2000, due to Green's diagnosis of testicular cancer, but continued to appear on the channel via reruns and other promotional materials. In 2002, it was ranked #41 on TV Guides 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time. In 2003, the show was revived as The New Tom Green Show. In 2006, Green launched Tom Green Live, a live call-in show for his website, which was later renamed Tom Green's House Tonight. Synopsis=Personalities The show was hosted by Tom Green, along with longtime friends Glenn Humplik and Phil Giroux. Derek Harvie, who co-wrote the show with Green, occasionally appeared in the segments. Many of the sketches were targeted at his parents, both of whom appear to be embarrassed and not impressed by their son's antics. Stunts Much of the show's humor was Tom Green's signature brand of shock comedy; numerous sketches featured Green performing bizarre or shocking acts in public, such as sucking on a cow's udder, and throwing plastic baby dolls at passing cars. This content was highly controversial, and the show quickly garnered many detractors. Perhaps most controversial was Green's treatment of his parents, who were often the targets of his pranks. In an infamous sketch, Green woke his parents in the middle of the night by placing a severed cow's head in their bed, a reference to a similar scene in The Godfather. During an interview with his parents for their 30th anniversary, he turned the discussion into asking questions about their sex life. Despite the show's reputation for scatological and transgressive humor, several sketches featured Green performing in a responsible and respectful way, making fun of his juvenile persona. One of these sketches was \\"People Helpers\\", where Green and guest star Bruce McCulloch seriously assisted wheelchair users. Recurring characters and sketches The show also had a few recurring characters and sketches, including Billy Bob (a redneck who loved caramels and shaking his leg), Hockey Guy (a hockey player who would skate up in front of people and clumsily fall down), and a police station sketch. He also explored the quirks of his friends. Green drew attention to Giroux's unusual laugh and discomfort with the smell of copper. One sketch aired when Glen had to urinate, but couldn't because Tom and the camera crew were in proximity (but still reasonably far away). They aired clips from a lengthy argument of whether a bear or a cougar would win in a fight. \\"The Bum Bum Song\\" When the show moved to MTV, Green released a single called \\"Lonely Swedish (The Bum Bum Song)\\", encouraging visitors to download the song off his website, burn it onto CDs and distribute it to friends. After airing the music video on his show and appealing to his audience to request it, the song became an instant number one hit on Total Request Live. He quickly called for the video to be retired because \\"it's not fair to 98 Degrees.\\" Later, in his autobiography, he revealed that MTV had pressured him to do so in order to maintain the image that Total Request Live was, in fact, a live request show (the next week's episodes had been pre-taped on location, and the producers of the show were completely unaware of \\"The Bum Bum Song\\" at the time).\\"The Opie & Anthony Show\\", February 16, 2010 Special episodes In one episode that aired in early 2000, Green visited his parents in Ottawa, Ontario with Monica Lewinsky, and used the occasion to fool local reporters into thinking that they would make an important \\"announcement\\" together, which turned out to be related to Monica's new interest in designing fabric handbags. In 2000, Green made a one- hour special out of his testicular cancer surgery. It focused on his reaction to the cancer diagnosis, as well as his family's, and footage of the actual surgery was included in one scene. The episode received wide critical acclaim for revealing a vulnerable, human side of an otherwise juvenile television personality. In March 2002, he also starred in and directed a one-hour special called The Tom Green Subway Monkey Hour, where he harassed strangers in Japan. The New Tom Green Show The show was briefly revived by MTV in 2003 as The New Tom Green Show, which was retooled to have more of a late-night talk show format, but was cancelled by MTV a few months after its premiere due to plummeting ratings. The show ran for 51 episodes from June 23, 2003 to September 5, 2003. Tom Green Live! / Tom Green's House Tonight On June 15, 2006, Tom Green launched Tom Green Live!, a live call-in talk show broadcast on his website TomGreen.com. It began as a partnership between Green and ManiaTV!. In 2008, the show was renamed Tom Green's House Tonight. The show takes place in Green's own living room in the Hollywood Hills overlooking the San Fernando Valley. Rumored Hitler segment A frequent rumor says that the show was cancelled because of an alleged segment where Green shows up at a Bar Mitzvah dressed as Adolf Hitler. Green, however, has repeatedly denied that such a segment exists. He mentions the rumor in his 2004 autobiography, Hollywood Causes Cancer, stating that it started when some Boston teenagers were caught videotaping themselves performing that particular stunt and, when asked by security, they used the name \\"Tom Green\\". Green says, \\"I would never do a mean-spirited, anti-Semitic joke like that‚Äîit's both abhorrent and not funny...To this day I still get asked about it, and it's annoying. So again, for the record, it didn't happen. There is nobody on this planet that has ever seen this bit on tape because it does not exist. If it did exist, it would have certainly reared its ugly, hateful head on the Internet by now. But it won't, because it doesn't exist. I've never put on a Hitler costume. In fact, I've never even been to a Bar Mitzvah.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * Category:1990s American sketch comedy television series Category:2000s American sketch comedy television series Category:1990s Canadian sketch comedy television series Category:2000s Canadian sketch comedy television series Category:American television talk shows Category:1990s Canadian television talk shows Category:MTV original programming Category:1994 American television series debuts Category:1994 Canadian television series debuts Category:2000 American television series endings Category:2000 Canadian television series endings Category:Canadian community channel television shows Category:Rogers TV original programming Category:CTV Comedy Channel original programming Category:Television controversies in Canada Category:Television controversies in the United States ","title":"The Tom Green Show"},{"id":"467156","text":"The Unionist Party was a centre-right historical political party in Canada, composed primarily of former members of the Conservative party with some individual Liberal Members of Parliament. It was formed in 1917 by MPs who supported the \\"Union government\\" formed by Sir Robert Borden during the First World War, formed the government through the final years of the war, and was a proponent of conscription. It was opposed by the remaining Liberal MPs, who sat as the official opposition. The Unionist Party continued to exist until 1922, at which time the Conservative elements re-formed the Conservative party.  Formation  Poster for Borden's Union government. In May 1917, Conservative Prime Minister Borden proposed the formation of a national unity government or coalition government to Liberal leader Sir Wilfrid Laurier in order to enact conscription, and to govern for the remainder of the war. Laurier rejected this proposal because of the opposition of his Quebec MPs, and fears that Quebec nationalist leader Henri Bourassa would be able to exploit the situation. Public opinion in Quebec was heavily against conscription, influencing the Liberal opposition to it due to the large number of Liberal MPs from Quebec. As an alternative to a coalition with Laurier, on October 12, 1917, Borden formed the Union government with a Cabinet of twelve Conservatives, nine Liberals and Independents and one \\"Labour\\" member. To represent \\"labour\\" and the working class, Borden appointed to the Cabinet Conservative Senator Gideon Decker Robertson who had been appointed to the Senate in January and had links with the conservative wing of the labour movement through his profession as a telegrapher. Robertson, however, was a Tory and not a member of any Labour or socialist party. Borden then called an election for December 1917 on the issue of conscription (see also Conscription Crisis of 1917), running as head of the \\"Unionist Party\\" composed of Borden's Conservatives, independent MPs, and members of the Liberals who left Laurier's caucus to support conscription. Supporters of the Borden government ran for parliament as \\"Unionists\\", while some of the Liberals running as government supporters preferred to call themselves \\"Liberal-Unionist\\". Prime Minister Borden pledged himself during the 1917 campaign to equal suffrage for women. He introduced a bill in 1918 for extending the franchise to women; it passed without division. This tactic split the Liberal Party: those who did not join the Unionist Party ran as Laurier Liberals. The election resulted in a landslide election victory for Borden. Borden attempted to continue the Unionist Party after the war and when Arthur Meighen succeeded him in 1920, he renamed it the \\"National Liberal and Conservative Party\\" in the hope of making the coalition permanent. The Unionists had never been officially a single party, and therefore lacked the structure of an official party and Meighen hoped to change this. In the 1921 general election, most of the Liberal- Unionist MPs did not join this party, and ran as Liberals under the leadership of its new leader, William Lyon Mackenzie King. Only a handful ran again as Liberal-Unionists or joined Meighen's renamed party. Prominent Liberal- Unionists who stayed with the Conservatives include Hugh Guthrie and Robert Manion. Following the defeat of Meighen's government, the \\"National Liberal and Conservative Party\\" changed its name to the \\"Liberal-Conservative Party of Canada\\", although it was commonly known as the \\"Conservative Party\\". During World War II, the Conservatives attempted to oppose the Liberal government of William Lyon Mackenzie King in the 1940 election by proposing a \\"national government\\" along the lines of the previous war's Unionist government. Accordingly, they ran in the election under the name National Government party, but did not repeat the success of the Unionist party and failed to form government.

He was notable for being the first MƒÅori Speaker, and for being the first Speaker since Bill Barnard in 1943 to hold office while not a member of the governing party. He was an orthopaedic surgeon before entering politics. Early life Peter Wilfred Tapsell was born in 1930. His father Pita was a grandson of the early Danish-born trader Phillip Tapsell and Hine-i-t≈´rama NgƒÅtiki. Tapsell was born and raised in Rotorua, and went to Rotorua Boys' High School. With the help of a scholarship, he studied medicine at the University of Otago, graduating in 1952. He worked at several hospitals throughout New Zealand before travelling to the United Kingdom to undertake further study. Upon his return to New Zealand, he took up a position in Rotorua. Highly active in MƒÅori cultural organisations, Tapsell was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1968 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to medicine and the MƒÅori people. Member of Parliament Tapsell stood as the Labour Party candidate for Rotorua in the 1975 election and the 1978 election, but was not successful in entering Parliament until the 1981 election, when he stood as a candidate in the Eastern Maori electorate. At various stages of his parliamentary career, Tapsell served as Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister for the Arts, Minister of Police, Minister of Civil Defence, Minister of Science, Minister of Forestry, and Minister of Defence. Speaker of the House of Representatives Tapsell as Speaker After the 1993 election, the National Party had a majority of only one seat. The appointment of the Speaker, therefore, presented a problem ‚Äì if National selected a Speaker from among its own ranks, as was traditional, it would lose its majority, since the Speaker was not permitted to vote at that time. Therefore, Prime Minister Jim Bolger decided to offer the Speaker's position to a member of the Labour Party, thereby retaining the crucial vote. Tapsell was the person chosen by Bolger for this role. Despite many objections from his Labour Party colleagues, Tapsell opted to accept the position. His elevation was not unchallenged, however, with an objection being raised by Winston Peters and his New Zealand First party. Peters claimed that his objection was on behalf of the incumbent Speaker, long-serving National MP Robin Gray, who had expected to resume his duties but was now being \\"cast aside\\" for political reasons. Critics of Peters, however, claimed that New Zealand First merely wanted to leave National and Labour deadlocked, as it would be New Zealand First that held the balance of power in that situation. Robin Gray, however, refused the nomination, and Tapsell took the Speaker's chair unopposed.  Retirement  In the 1996 election, however, Tapsell lost the electorate, now called Te Tai Rawhiti, by 4215 votes to New Zealand First's Tuariki Delamere, one of the Tight Five. Tapsell had not been put on the party list. This was part of a major shift away from the Labour Party by MƒÅori voters, with New Zealand First capturing all of the MƒÅori electorates. Whether Tapsell would have retained the Speaker's role is uncertain, as a reform of Parliamentary procedure meant the Speaker no longer lost their vote. The loss of his electorate seat, however, prompted Tapsell's retirement from politics. In 1991, Tapsell's family was struck with tragedy when his daughter killed his mother. In the subsequent trial, she was judged not guilty by reason of insanity. In the 1997 New Year Honours, Tapsell was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for public services, lately as Speaker of the House of Representatives. After his retirement, Tapsell was involved in a number of organisations, becoming the Patron of Monarchy New Zealand. He also assisted several medical charities, and the University of Waikato awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1997. In 2006, Tapsell spoke at an event with Hak Ja Han, wife of Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon, and praised their teaching of a \\"concept of the ideal family as comprising a father, a mother, children and grandparents\\" living together in a three generation extended family, as being \\"very MƒÅori.\\" References - Category:1930 births Category:2012 deaths Category:New Zealand defence ministers Category:New Zealand Labour Party MPs Category:New Zealand monarchists Category:New Zealand orthopaedic surgeons Category:People from Rotorua Category:Speakers of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:University of Otago alumni Category:New Zealand MPs for MƒÅori electorates Category:Te Arawa Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1996 New Zealand general election Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1975 New Zealand general election Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1978 New Zealand general election Category:Knights Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit Category:New Zealand Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons Category:Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh Category:New Zealand politicians awarded knighthoods ","title":"Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)"},{"id":"467164","text":"The phylum Bacteroidetes is composed of three large classes of Gram-negative, nonsporeforming, anaerobic or aerobic, and rod-shaped bacteria that are widely distributed in the environment, including in soil, sediments, and sea water, as well as in the guts and on the skin of animals. Although some Bacteroides spp. can be opportunistic pathogens, many Bacteroidetes are symbiotic species highly adjusted to the gastrointestinal tract. Bacteroides are highly abundant in intestines, reaching up to 1011 cells g‚àí1 of intestinal material. They perform metabolic conversions that are essential for the host, such as degradation of proteins or complex sugar polymers. Bacteroidetes colonize the gastrointestinal already in infants, as non-digestible oligosaccharides in mother milk support the growth of both Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium spp. Bacteroides spp., is selectively recognized by the immune system of the host through specific interactions.  History  Bacteroides fragilis was the first Bacteroides species isolated in 1898 as a human pathogen linked to appendicitis among other clinical cases. By far, the ones in the Bacteroidia class are the most well-studied, including the genus Bacteroides (an abundant organism in the feces of warm-blooded animals including humans), and Porphyromonas, a group of organisms inhabiting the human oral cavity. The class Bacteroidia was formerly called Bacteroidetes; as it was until recently the only class in the phylum, the name was changed in the fourth volume of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. For a long time, it was thought that the majority of Gram-negative gastrointestinal tract bacteria belonged to the genus Bacteroides, but in recent years many Bacteroides spp. underwent reclassification. Based on current classification, the majority of the gastrointestinal Bacteroidetes spp. belongs to Bacteroidaceae, Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae, and Porphyromonadaceae families. This phylum is sometimes grouped with Chlorobi, Fibrobacteres, Gemmatimonadates, Caldithrix, and marine group A to form the FCB group or superphylum. In the alternative classification system proposed by Cavalier-Smith, this taxon is instead a class in the Sphingobacteria phylum.  Medical and ecological role  In the gastrointestinal microbiota Bacteroidetes have a very broad metabolic potential and are regarded as one of the most stable part of gastrointestinal microflora. Reduced abundance of the Bacteroidetes in some cases is associated with obesity. This bacterial group appears to be enriched in patients suffering from irritable bowel syndromePittayanon R. et al., Gastroenterology, 2019, 157(1):97-108. and involved in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Bacteroides spp. in contrast to Prevotella spp. were recently found to be enriched in the metagenomes of subjects with low gene richness that were associated with adiposity, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia as well as an inflammatory phenotype. Bacteroidetes species that belong to classes Flavobacteriales and Sphingobacteriales are typical soil bacteria and can only occasionally detected in the gastrointestinal tract, except Capnocytophaga spp. and Sphingobacterium spp. that can be detected in the human oral cavity. Bacteroidetes are not limited to gut microbiota, they colonize a variety of habitats on Earth. For example, Bacteroidetes, together with Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, are also among the most abundant bacterial groups in rhizosphere. They have been detected in soil samples from various locations, including cultivated fields, greenhouse soils and unexploited areas. Bacteroidetes also inhabit freshwater lakes, rivers, as well as oceans. They are increasingly recognized as an important compartment of the bacterioplankton in marine environments, especially in pelagic oceans. Halophilic Bacteroidetes genus Salinibacter inhabit hypersaline environments such as salt-saturated brines in hypersaline lakes. Salinibacter shares many properties with halophilic Archaea such as Halobacterium and Haloquadratum that inhabit the same environments. Phenotypically, Salinibacter is remarkably similar to Halobacterium and therefore for a long time remained unidentified.  Metabolism  Gastrointestinal Bacteroidetes species produce succinic acid, acetic acid, and in some cases propionic acid, as the major end-products. Species belonging to the genera Alistipes, Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, Prevotella, Paraprevotella, Alloprevotella, Barnesiella, and Tannerella are saccharolytic, while species belonging to Odoribacter and Porphyromonas are predominantly asaccharolytic. Some Bacteroides spp. and Prevotella spp. can degrade complex plant polysaccharides such as starch, cellulose, xylans, and pectins. The Bacteroidetes species also play an important role in protein metabolism by proteolytic activity assigned to the proteases linked to the cell. Some Bacteroides spp. have a potential to utilize urea as a nitrogen source. Other important functions of Bacteroides spp. include the deconjugation of bile acids and growth on mucus. Many members of the Bacteroidetes genera (Flexibacter, Cytophaga, Sporocytophaga and relatives) are coloured yellow-orange to pink-red due to the presence of pigments of the flexirubin group. In some Bacteroidetes strains, flexirubins may be present together with carotenoid pigments. Carotenoid pigments are usually found in marine and halophilic members of the group, whereas flexirubin pigments are more frequent in clinical, freshwater or soil-colonizing representatives. Genomics Comparative genomic analysis has led to the identification of 27 proteins which are present in most species of the phylum Bacteroidetes. Of these, one protein is found in all sequenced Bacteroidetes species, while two other proteins are found in all sequenced species with the exception of those from the genus Bacteroides. The absence of these two proteins in this genus is likely due to selective gene loss. Additionally, four proteins have been identified which are present in all Bacteroidetes species except Cytophaga hutchinsonii; this is again likely due to selective gene loss. A further eight proteins have been identified which are present in all sequenced Bacteroidetes genomes except Salinibacter ruber. The absence of these proteins may be due to selective gene loss, or because S. ruber branches very deeply, the genes for these proteins may have evolved after the divergence of S. ruber. A conserved signature indel has also been identified; this three-amino-acid deletion in ClpB chaperone is present in all species of the Bacteroidetes phylum except S. ruber. This deletion is also found in one Chlorobi species and one Archaeum species, which is likely due to horizontal gene transfer. These 27 proteins and the three-amino-acid deletion serve as molecular markers for the Bacteroidetes. Relatedness of Bacteroidetes, Chlorobi and Fibrobacteres phyla Species from the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla branch very closely together in phylogenetic trees, indicating a close relationship. Through the use of comparative genomic analysis, three proteins have been identified which are uniquely shared by virtually all members of the Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi phyla. The sharing of these three proteins is significant because other than them, no proteins from either the Bacteroidetes or Chlorobi phyla are shared by any other groups of bacteria. Several conserved signature indels have also been identified which are uniquely shared by members of the phyla. The presence of these molecular signatures supports their close relationship. Additionally, the phylum Fibrobacteres is indicated to be specifically related to these two phyla. A clade consisting of these three phyla is strongly supported by phylogenetic analyses based upon a number of different proteins These phyla also branch in the same position based upon conserved signature indels in a number of important proteins. Lastly and most importantly, two conserved signature indels (in the RpoC protein and in serine hydroxymethyltransferase) and one signature protein PG00081 have been identified that are uniquely shared by all of the species from these three phyla. All of these results provide compelling evidence that the species from these three phyla shared a common ancestor exclusive of all other bacteria, and it has been proposed that they should all recognized as part of a single ‚ÄúFCB‚Äù superphylum.

A Complete Manual of English Literature. Ed. William Smith. New York: Sheldon & Co., 1872. 372. Print. He was most recognised for Grongar Hill, one of six early poems featured in a 1726 miscellany. Longer works published later include the less successful genre poems, The Ruins of Rome (1740) and The Fleece (1757). His work has always been more anthologised than published in separate editions, but his talent was later recognised by William Wordsworth among others. Life and career=Youth John Dyer was the fourth of six children born to Robert and Catherine Cocks Dyer in Llanfynydd, Carmarthenshire, five miles from Grongar Hill. His exact birth date is unknown, but the earliest existing record of John Dyer dates his baptism on 13 August 1699Williams, Ralph M. Poet, Painter and Parson the Life of John Dyer. New York: Bookman Associates, 1956. 21. Print. ‚Äì within fourteen days after his birth as was the tradition of the time ‚Äì in Llanfynnydd parish. His grandfather was churchwarden there and his father was a highly successful solicitor in Llanfynnydd and owned several properties in the neighbourhood. Presumably for financial opportunity and greater living space for six children, the family moved in 1710 to the mansion of Aberglasney in the nearby parish of Llangathen. Dyer was first educated in an unknown school in the countryside before attending Westminster School under Dr. Robert Freind.Williams 1956, p.25 Dyer's dislike for Westminster was chronicled in a 1714 entry in his Journal of Escapes: \\"Ran from school and my father, on a box of the ear being given me strolled for three or four days ‚Äì found at Windsor.\\" He retained little of what he learned, as evidenced later by his unfamiliarity with the Latin authors that were a school staple. Aberglasney House, home of the Dyer family from 1710 After Westminster School, Dyer worked in his father's office, learning the business. His talent in the field of law was evidenced by the lawsuits in which he was involved and he was the only one of four sons to have managed his property well.Williams 1956, p.30 John's father, who wanted his son to pursue a career as solicitor, subdued the poet's longing to channel his creativity through painting and writing. Ralph M. Williams comments that it was upon his return to Aberglasney \\"that we first begin to know something of his personality and see for the first time the conflict in him between the dreamy romantic and the practical man of business that runs through his life.\\"Williams 1956, p.28 Having grown up among the ancient stoneworks in the Aberglasney grounds, it was not surprising that Dyer had developed an interest in antiquities and the love of nature that characterises his work. Robert Dyer's death on 8 July 1720Lloyd vs. Dyer, P.R.O. C.11.995/14 and Dyer vs. Dyer, P.R.O., C.33.349, fol. 504 verso. ended John's apprenticeship to the law and he was not named in his father's will, releasing him from handling the lawsuit riddled estate bequeathed to his brother, also called Robert. John then left Aberglasney for London in 1720 or 1721 to pursue painting and poetry.Williams 1956, p.33 Painting and poetry In London, Dyer apprenticed himself under the artist Jonathan Richardson. Richardson's fundamental principle of painting was that all aspects of learning, from reading, observation of nature, studying works by masters in painting and writing poetry were necessary to provide artists with inspiration. As a result, Dyer retained such interests and translated his studies into verbal landscape art.Humfrey, Belinda. Writers of Wales ‚Äì John Dyer. Ed. Meic Stephens, R, Brinley Jones. University of Wales Press, 1980. 11. Print His first attempt in writing Miltonic octosyllabic couplets was addressed to his mentor, \\"An Epistle to a Famous Painter\\",The Poetical Works of John Dyer, Edinburgh 1779, pp.148‚Äì50 the same measure as in his second version of Grongar Hill. It was under Richardson that Dyer met his coffee house group of friends, Thomas Edwards, Daniel Wray, George Knapton and Arthur Pond. Pond would later be referred to in The Fleece (IV. 265). Dyer, with Richardson's blessing, sailed to Italy in 1724 to continue his studies and made his way straight to Rome, where he admired its objects of antiquity. The Pantheon was a favourite building and preoccupied his time during the trip,Longstaffe 1847, p. 266; Willmott, p.30. while the Colosseum and the Baths of Caracalla were also held in high regard.Willmott, p. 29. Among sculptures and reliefs, he notes the Hercules, the Apollo, the \\"Venus de Medici,\\" the Laoco√∂n group, Trajan's column, the temple of Pallas, the arches of Titus and Constantine and the Borghese Dancers (now in the Louvre).Longstaffe 1847, p.266; Willmott, p.vii. Such were the inspirations or objects of interest in Dyer's poem The Ruins of Rome, written in 1740. But though he appreciated the beauties about him, his staunch Protestantism was appalled by what he regarded as the superstitious practices of Catholicism: \\"God of our Fathers, keep us from the ways of these foul hirelings,\\" he exclaimed in a poetic fragment written at the time.Wilmott 1855, \\"Written at St Peter's, p.16-17 While there, Dyer fell ill with a malarial fever caught in the Campagna and began to contemplate his future. Resuming his journey northwards, he visited the ruins of Otricoli, where he found inspiration for his poem signifying this shift of mood, \\"Written at Ocriculum in Italy, 1725\\".Wilmott 1855, pp.18‚Äì21 Continuing on his journey to Florence, his visits to museums and buildings there instigated a shift in his interests from the classical to the Renaissance period to create one of his few surviving paintings, a copy of Antonio da Correggio's masterpiece, \\"Madonna Adoring the Christ Child.\\" On Dyer's return, a selection of six of his poems were published in Richard Savage's Miscellaneous Poems and Translations (1726), which largely consisted of the work of the coterie that had gathered about Aaron Hill, one of those literary groupings typical of the 18th century whose work interconnected and was often cross-referential. This was evident in the many 'collected' editions of Dyer's poems published after his death that were prefaced by poems addressed to him by these friends, in answer to or answered by the shorter poems of Dyer's placed at the end.As, for example, in the Edinburgh edition of 1779 Thus Dyer's poem \\"To Mr Savage, son of the late Earl Rivers\\", exhorting him to bear up under misfortune, is answered by Savage's \\"An epistle to My John Dyer in answer to his from the country\\". And Dyer's paean to living in country obscurity, \\"To a friend in town\\", becomes a Horatian exchange when complemented by Aaron Hill's \\"The Choice\\". Another cluster of poems about Dyer's portrait of Martha Fowke, who went under the name of Clio in the group,Christine Gerrard, Aaron Hill: The Muses' Projector, 1685‚Äì1750, Oxford University 2003, pp.61‚Äì80 is particularly rich. Both Dyer's \\"A Country Walk\\" and \\"The Inquiry\\" mention her with singular devotion. So also does \\"To Clio from Rome\\" (which remained uncollected in 18th century editions) with its reference to \\"the wreathed urn among the vines, whose form my pencil now designs.\\"The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse, 2009, pp.166‚Äì7 This comes aptly, since Dyer had recently painted her. Martha's reply apologises for her tardiness and compliments both his poetic and artistic tributes: \\"Your claim demands the bays in double wreath, Your poems lighten and your pictures breathe\\". Savage too paid his tribute \\"To Mr John Dyer, occasioned by seeing his picture of the celebrated Clio\\" in which, going beyond outward likeness, \\"You eye the Soul\\".The Poetical Works of Richard Savage, Edinburgh 1780, pp.157‚Äì9 The most that Dyer himself will admit in his epistle \\"To a Famous Painter\\" (his teacher Jonathan Richardson), also written from Rome, is the modest confession that \\"As yet I but in verse can paint\\". Several later poems that only exist in manuscript were addressed to different ladies. His epistle \\"To Aurelia\\",The Poems of John Dyer, Welsh Library 1903, p.29 another member of the coterie, is an appeal to \\"leave the smoky Town\\" with him for some rural retreat. Other poems cover pseudonymous flirtations with a Myra and a Celia.Longstaffe 1847, pp.425‚Äì6 Later life Following his return to England after a year and half in Italy, and then the publication of his early poems in 1726, Dyer briefly returned to Aberglasney, where he became estranged from his brother Robert. The next several years were spent between London and Herefordshire or on painting trips. In 1734 he restored to profitability a rundown farm belonging to an aunt and spent several more years as a gentleman farmer in other counties.Gerrard, Christine. \\"John Dyer (1699‚Äì1757).\\" Eighteenth-Century Poetry An Annotated Anthology (Blackwell Annotated Anthologies). 2nd ed.

From then dates the anecdotal pastoral \\"My Ox Duke\\".The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth Century Verse, 2009, p.171 He was also on the lookout for a suitable subject for a longer poem and began work on the unfinished fragment \\"The Cambro-Briton\\".Wilmott 1855, pp.22‚Äì3 Eventually, however, he fell back on the fruits of his Italian travels, published as The Ruins of Rome in 1740. It was only much later in his georgic The Fleece (1757) that he put to use the insight into the wool industry that he gained as a farmer. The master theme of The Ruins of Rome had already suggested itself to Dyer in his earlier \\"Written at Ocriculum in Italy, 1725\\". Written in a mannered imitation of Miltonic blank verse, it opens with Dyer painting among the ruins, \\"studious to excel, of praise and fame ambitious\\". As night falls, a seer comes to remind him of his mortality by pointing to the downfallen architecture of the past. Instead he is exhorted to learn from the work of the eternal Creator spread in beauty across the skies and dedicate his life to goodness. The poem's religious conclusions were also to find expression in two unpublished poems of the 1750s, \\"A Night Prospect written on Lincoln Heath\\" and \\"On the Destruction of Lisbon\\".Wilmott 1855, pp.113, 115‚Äì6 Little is known about his paintings all this time, for most have been lost. Apart from family portraits attributed to him,See two at Art UK two others on religious subjects are reported. One was a \\"Last Supper\\" at Newtown Church,David Simons, A Vision of Pengwerne, Shrewsbury 1841, p.149 the other a head of Christ owned by another family member.Wilmott 1855 p.xxxi In 1741 Dyer travelled to Worcester to paint the portrait of Bishop John Hough and while there was persuaded to seek ordination in the Church of England. In September of that year he was created a deacon and by October was made priest of Catthorpe in Leicestershire, a position he held for the next nine years.Brackett, Virginia. \\"Dyer, John.\\" Facts on File Companion to British Poetry 17th and 18th Centuries. New York 2008, pp.136‚Äì37 Now Dyer married a 26-year-old widow, Sarah Ensor Hawkins (said to be a descendant of Shakespeare), with whom he had several children. In 1751 patrons found him a more prosperous living in Belchford, Lincolnshire, and in the following year he ministered to Coningsby as well, later still moving to Kirkby on Bain, also in Lincolnshire. In 1752 he had been made a Bachelor of Laws of Cambridge and by now had begun writing The Fleece, on the title page of which the initials LL.B followed his name. Living in the Lincolnshire fens,\\"Among reeds and mud, begirt with dead brown lakes\\", as he reported in verses sent to a friend,Wilmott 1855, p.xviii proved fatal to Dyer's tubercular condition. Some months after the publication of his final poem, he died in December 1757.Humfrey, John Dyer, 97; Williams, Poet, Painter and Parson, 139; Gerrard, Christine. \\"John Dyer (1699‚Äì1757).\\" His major poems were published by Robert Dodsley in 1761, Google Books followed later by wider selections that included his earlier poems from Savage's miscellany. The contents of these varied little, until the appearance of The Poems of Mark Akenside and John Dyer,Edited by Robert Aris Wilmott, London 1855 This included manuscript poems in the possession of a family descendant, William Hilton Longstaffe, who had earlier written a commentary on some of these in The Patrician.\\"Notes on the life and writings of John Dyer, the poet\\", vol.IV (1847) Edward Thomas brought out a shorter selection in 1903 for the Welsh LibraryArchived online and there have been American studies of his poetry since then. Poems Title page of The Fleece Among Dyer's papers is a transcription that he describes as P't of Gron'. Hill as 'twas wrote first in ye year 1716. It is a discursive work in decasyllabic couplets with little relation to the poem of that title published a decade later and might just as well have served as the basis of \\"The Country Walk\\".Longstaffe 1847, p.265 The first published version of his celebration of the hill was written in Pindarics and originally appeared in Richard Savage's miscellany. In the same year, after having received some acclaim, Dyer rewrote Grongar Hill in four- stressed octosyllabic couplets roughly modelled on those of Milton's L'Allegro and contrasting strongly with the version of pastoral in Alexander Pope's Windsor Forest. Though the rhymes and grammar are uncertain, the poem was eventually to be accounted his best work and was recognised as a precursor of Romanticism. Dyer worked outside the trend of politically oriented work and kept his focus on the rural landscape, its colours and visual perspective, following his training as a painter. The Ruins of Rome was a descriptive poem in 545 lines of Miltonic blank-verse. It was published anonymously in 1740, but its reference to the earlier \\"Grongar Hill\\" that \\"I sung inglorious\\" establishes its authorship obviously enough.Title page and opening lines at Rooke Books As in Grongar Hill, Dyer's approach to antiquity is personalised and a forerunner of the \\"Age of Sensibility\\" that led poetry in the direction of Romanticism. The poem has been described as \\"largely responsible for the eighteenth-century revival of a unique subgenre of landscape poetry dealing with the ruins of the ancient world.\\"Bruce C. Swaffield, Rising from the Ruins: Roman Antiquities in Neoclassic Literature, Cambridge Scholars 2009, p.xiii The ambitious four-book The Fleece (1757), was also written in blank- verse. It was a georgic in the line of Virgilian imitations written during the 18th century that included John Philips' Cyder, Christopher Smart's The Hop- Garden (1752) and James Grainger's The Sugar Cane (1764). Dyer's poem deals with the tending of sheep, the shearing and preparation of the wool, weaving, and trade in woollen manufactures. Its lofty epic diction also addresses the reasons for England's prosperity and on a personal level reflects on the benefits that trade will bring to him. Poetic recognition, however, was not among such benefits at the time, although the work had its supporters, including Grainger, one of the few who reviewed Dyer's poem sympathetically.Wilmott 1855, pp.xxiv-xxv In the following century William Wordsworth was to address a sonnet to Dyer as the ::Bard of the Fleece, whose skilful genius made ::That work a living landscape fair and bright.Bartleby  References Bibliography *Cazamian, Louis.

The term drew a contrast with the then-familiar use of the phrase \\"gay science\\" to refer to song and verse writing. The latter phrase later appeared as the title of a book by Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science. Some modern synonyms include the term \\"the miserable science\\". Origin The phrase \\"the dismal science\\" first occurs in Thomas Carlyle's 1849 tract called \\"Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question\\", in which he argued in favor of reintroducing slavery in order to restore productivity to the West Indies: It was \\"dismal\\" in \\"find[ing] the secret of this Universe in 'supply and demand', and reducing the duty of human governors to that of letting men alone\\". Instead, the \\"idle Black man in the West Indies\\" should be \\"compelled to work as he was fit, and to do the Maker's will who had constructed him\\".As quoted in Joseph Persky, 1990. \\"Retrospectives: A Dismal Romantic,\\" Journal of Economic Perspectives, 4(4), pp. 167-169 [pp. 165‚Äì172]. Carlyle's view was attacked by John Stuart Mill as making a virtue of toil itself, stunting the development of the weak, and committing the \\"vulgar error of imputing every difference which he finds among human beings to an original difference of nature\\".Mill, John Stuart (1850). \\"The Negro Question\\", Fraser's Magazine for Town and Country, Vol. XLI, p. 29. Note that Carlyle did not originally coin the phrase \\"dismal science\\" as a response to the economically-influential theories of Thomas Malthus, who predicted that starvation would inevitably result as projected population growth exceeded the rate of increase in the food supply.Investopedia Page on The Dismal ScienceEconomics Help page on The Dismal Science However, Carlyle did earlier use the word \\"dismal\\" in relation to Malthus' theory in Chartism (1839): Beyond Carlyle Many at the time and afterward have understood the phrase in relation to the grim predictions drawn from the principles of 19th century \\"political economy\\".

Conventional semiconductors like silicon have a bandgap in the range of 1 - 1.5 electronvolt (eV), whereas wide-bandgap materials have bandgaps in the range of 2 - 4 eV. Generally, wide-bandgap semiconductors have electronic properties which fall in between those of conventional semiconductors and insulators. Wide-bandgap semiconductors permit devices to operate at much higher voltages, frequencies and temperatures than conventional semiconductor materials like silicon and gallium arsenide. They are the key component used to make green and blue LEDs and lasers, and are also used in certain radio frequency applications, notably military radars. Their intrinsic qualities make them suitable for a wide range of other applications, and they are one of the leading contenders for next-generation devices for general semiconductor use. The wider bandgap is particularly important for allowing devices that use them to operate at much higher temperatures, on the order of 300 ¬∞C. This makes them highly attractive for military applications, where they have seen a fair amount of use. The high temperature tolerance also means that these devices can be operated at much higher power levels under normal conditions. Additionally, most wide bandgap materials also have a much higher critical electrical field density, on the order of ten times that of conventional semiconductors. Combined, these properties allow them to operate at much higher voltages and currents, which makes them highly valuable in military, radio and energy conversion settings. The US Department of Energy believes they will be a foundational technology in new electrical grid and alternative energy devices, as well as the robust and efficient power components used in high energy vehicles from electric trains to plug-in electric vehicles. Most wide-bandgap materials also have high free- electron velocities, which allows them to work at higher switching speeds, which adds to their value in radio applications. A single WBG device can be used to make a complete radio system, eliminating the need for separate signal and radio frequency components, while operating at higher frequencies and power levels. Research and development of wide-bandgap materials lags behind that of conventional semiconductors, which have received massive investment since the 1970s. However, their clear inherent advantages in many applications, combined with some unique properties not found in conventional semiconductors, has led to increasing interest in their use in everyday electronic devices to replace silicon. Their ability of handle higher energy densities is particularly attractive for attempts to continue obeying Moore's law, as conventional technologies appear to be reaching a density plateau. Use in devices Wide-bandgap materials have several characteristics that make them useful compared to narrower bandgap materials. The higher energy gap gives devices the ability to operate at higher temperatures, as bandgaps typically shrink with increasing temperature, which can be problematic when using conventional semiconductors. For some applications, wide-bandgap materials allow devices to switch larger voltages. The wide bandgap also brings the electronic transition energy into the range of the energy of visible light, and hence light-emitting devices such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and semiconductor lasers can be made that emit in the visible spectrum, or even produce ultraviolet radiation. Solid-state lighting using wide-bandgap semiconductors has the potential to reduce the amount of energy required to provide lighting compared with incandescent lights, which have a luminous efficacy of less than 20 lumens per watt. The efficacy of LEDs is on the order of 160 lumens per watt. Wide-bandgap semiconductors can also be used in RF signal processing. Silicon-based power transistors are reaching limits of operating frequency, breakdown voltage, and power density. Wide bandgap materials can be used in high-temperature and power switching applications. Materials There are many III‚ÄìV and II‚ÄìVI compound semiconductors with high bandgaps. The only high bandgap materials in group IV are diamond and silicon carbide (SiC). Aluminum nitride (AlN) can be used to fabricate ultraviolet LEDs with wavelengths down to 200‚Äì250 nm. Gallium nitride (GaN) is used to make blue LEDs and lasers. Boron nitride (BN) is used in cubic boron nitride. Materials properties Wide bandgap materials are semiconductors with bandgaps greater than 3 eV. Bandgap Quantum mechanics gives rise to a series of distinct electron energy levels, or bands, that vary from material to material. Each band can hold a certain number of electrons; if the atom has more electrons then they are forced into higher energy bands. In the presence of external energy some of the electrons will gain energy and move back up the energy bands, before releasing this and falling back down the bands again. With the constant application of external energy, like the thermal energy present at room temperature, an equilibrium is reached where the population of electrons moving up and down the bands is equal. Depending on the distribution of the energy bands, and the \\"band gap\\" between them, the materials will have very different electrical properties. For instance, at room temperature most metals have a series of partially filled bands that allow electrons to be added or removed with little applied energy. When tightly packed together, electrons can easily move from atom to atom, making them excellent conductors. In comparison, most plastic materials have widely spaced energy levels that requires considerable energy to move electrons between their atoms, making them natural insulators. Semiconductors are those materials that have both types of bands, and at normal operational temperatures, some electrons are in both bands. In semiconductors, adding a small amount of energy pushes more electrons into the conduction band, making them more conductive and allowing current to flow like a conductor. Reversing the polarity of this applied energy pushes the electrons into the more widely separated bands, making them insulators and stopping the flow. Since the amount of energy needed to push the electrons between these two levels is very small, semiconductors allow switching with very little energy input. However, this switching process depends on the electrons being naturally distributed between the two states, so small inputs cause the population statistics to change rapidly. As the external temperature changes, due to the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution more and more electrons will normally find themselves in one state or the other, causing the switching action to occur on its own, or stop entirely. The size of the atoms and the number of protons in the atom are the primary predictors of the strength and layout of the bandgaps. Materials with small atoms and strong, electronegative atomic bonds are associated with wide bandgaps. Elements high on the periodic table are more likely to be wide bandgap materials. With regard to III-V compounds, nitrides are associated with the largest bandgaps, and, in the II-VI family, oxides are generally considered to be insulators. Bandgaps can often be engineered by alloying, and Vegard's Law states that there is a linear relation between lattice constant and composition of a solid solution at constant temperature. The position of the conduction band minima versus maxima in the band structure determine whether a bandgap is direct or indirect. Most wide bandgap materials are associated with a direct bandgap, with SiC and GaP as exceptions. Optical properties The bandgap determines the wavelength at which LEDs can emit light and the wavelength at which photovoltaics operate most efficiently. Wide-bandgap devices therefore are useful at shorter wavelengths than other semiconductor devices. The bandgap for GaAs of 1.4 eV, for example, corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 890 nm, which is invisible infrared light (the equivalent wavelength for light energy can be determined by dividing the constant 1240 nm-eV by the energy in eV, so 1240 nm-eV/1.4 eV=886 nm). Therefore, GaAs photovoltaics are not ideal for converting shorter-wavelength visible light into electricity. Silicon at 1.1 eV (1100 nm) is even worse. For solar-energy conversion using a single junction photovoltaic cell, the ideal bandgap has been variously estimated from around 1.0 eV up to around 1.5 eV (depending on various assumptions) because that low wavelength threshold covers nearly the entire solar spectrum that reaches the Earth's surface, but a lower-bandgap single-junction cell wastes a large portion of that power by inefficiently converting the shorter-wavelength parts of the solar spectrum. Because of this, a major area in solar energy research is developing multi- junction solar cells that collect separate parts of the spectrum with more efficiency, and wide bandgap photovoltaics are a key component for collecting the part of the spectrum beyond the infrared. The use of LEDs in lighting applications depended particularly on the development of wide-bandgap nitride semiconductors. The connection between the wavelength and the bandgap is that the energy of the bandgap is the minimum energy that is needed to excite an electron into the conduction band. In order for an unassisted photon to cause this excitation, it must have at least that much energy. In the opposite process, when excited electron-hole pairs undergo recombination, photons are generated with energies that correspond to the magnitude of the bandgap. A phonon is required in the process of absorption or emission in the case of an indirect bandgap semiconductor, so indirect bandgap semiconductors are usually very inefficient emitters, although they work reasonably well as absorbers also (as with silicon photovoltaics). Breakdown field Impact ionization is often attributed to be the cause of breakdown. At the point of breakdown, electrons in a semiconductor are associated with sufficient kinetic energy to produce carriers when they collide with lattice atoms. Wide bandgap semiconductors are associated with a high breakdown voltage. This is due to a larger electric field required to generate carriers through impact mechanism. At high electric fields, drift velocity saturates due to scattering from optical phonons. A higher optical phonon energy results in fewer optical phonons at a particular temperature, and there are therefore fewer scattering centers, and electrons in wide bandgap semiconductors can achieve high peak velocities. The drift velocity reaches a peak at an intermediate electric field and undergoes a small drop at higher fields. Intervalley scattering is an additional scattering mechanism at large electric fields, and it is due to a shift of carriers from the lowest valley of the conduction band to the upper valleys, where the lower band curvature raises the effective mass of the electrons and lowers electron mobility. The drop in drift velocity at high electric fields due to intervalley scattering is small in comparison to high saturation velocity that results from low optical phonon scattering. There is therefore an overall higher saturation velocity. Saturation velocity High effective masses of charge carriers are a result of low band curvatures, which correspond to low mobility. Fast response times of devices with wide bandgap semiconductors is due to the high carrier drift velocity at large electric fields, or saturation velocity. Bandgap discontinuity When wide bandgap semiconductors are used in heterojunctions, band discontinuities formed at equilibrium can be a design feature, although the discontinuity can result in complications when creating ohmic contacts. Polarization Wurtzite and zincblende structures characterize most wide bandgap semiconductors. Wurtzite phases allow spontaneous polarization in the (0001) direction. A result of the spontaneous polarization and piezoelectricity is that the polar surfaces of the materials are associated with higher sheet carrier density than the bulk. The polar face produces a strong electric field, which creates high interface charge densities. Thermal properties Silicon and other common materials have a bandgap on the order of 1 to 1.5 electronvolt (eV), which implies that such semiconductor devices can be controlled by relatively low voltages. However, it also implies that they are more readily activated by thermal energy, which interferes with their proper operation. This limits silicon based devices to operational temperatures below about 100 ¬∞C, beyond which the uncontrolled thermal activation of the devices makes it difficult for them to operate correctly. Wide-bandgap materials typically have bandgaps on the order of 2 to 4 eV, allowing them to operate at much higher temperatures on the order of 300 ¬∞C. This makes them highly attractive in military applications, where they have seen a fair amount of use. Melting temperatures, thermal expansion coefficients, and thermal conductivity can be considered to be secondary properties that are essential in processing, and these properties are related to the bonding in wide bandgap materials. Strong bonds result in higher melting temperatures and lower thermal expansion coefficients. A high Debye temperature results in a high thermal conductivity. With such thermal properties, heat is easily removed. Applications=High power applications The high breakdown voltage of wide bandgap semiconductors is a useful property in high-power applications that require large electric fields. Devices for high power and high temperature applications have been developed. Both gallium nitride and silicon carbide are robust materials well suited for such applications. Due to its robustness and ease of manufacture, semiconductors using silicon carbide are expected to be used widely, create simpler and higher efficiency charging for hybrid and all-electric vehicles, reduced energy loss and longer life solar and wind energy power converters, and elimination of bulky grid substation transformers. Cubic boron nitride is used as well. Most of these are for specialist applications in space programmes and military systems. They have not begun to displace silicon from its leading place in the general power semiconductor market. Light-emitting diodes In the near future, white LEDs with the features of more brightness and longer life may replace incandescent bulbs in many situations. The next generation of DVD players (The Blu-ray and HD DVD formats) uses GaN based violet lasers. Transducers Large piezoelectric effects allow wide bandgap materials to be used as transducers. High-electron-mobility transistor Very high speed GaN uses the phenomenon of high interface-charge densities. Due to its cost, aluminum nitride is so far used mostly in military applications.

His father sang tenor as a stipendiary 'Gentleman' or 'Lay Vicar Choral' in the Cathedral choir and was also the Diocesan Registrar of the church. He was a cousin of Irish composer Ina Boyle. Wood received his early education at the Cathedral Choir School and also studied organ with two Organists and Masters of the Boys of Armagh Cathedral, Robert Turle and his successor Dr Thomas Marks. In 1883 he became one of fifty inaugural class members of the Royal College of Music, studying composition with Charles Villiers Stanford and Charles Hubert Hastings Parry primarily, and horn and piano secondarily. Following four years of training, he continued his studies at Selwyn College, Cambridge through 1889, where he began teaching harmony and counterpoint. In 1889 he attained a teaching position at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, first as organ scholar and then as fellow in 1894, becoming the first Director of Music and Organist. He was instrumental in the reflowering of music at the college, though more as a teacher and organiser of musical events than as composer. After Stanford died in 1924, Wood assumed his mentor's vacant role as Professor of Music in the University of Cambridge. Like his better-known colleague Stanford, Wood is chiefly remembered for his Anglican church music. As well as his Communion Service in the Phrygian Mode, his settings of the Magnificat and Nunc dimittis are still popular with cathedral and parish church choirs, particularly the services in F, D, and G, and the two settings in E flat; during Passiontide his St Mark Passion is sometimes performed, and demonstrates Wood's interest in modal composition, in contrast to the late romantic harmonic style he more usually employs. Wood's anthems with organ, Expectans expectavi, and O Thou, the Central Orb are both frequently performed and recorded; as are his unaccompanied anthems Tis the day of Resurrection, Glory and Honour and, most popular of all, Hail, gladdening light and its lesser-known equivalent for men's voices, Great Lord of Lords. All Wood's a cappella music demonstrates fastidious craftsmanship and a supreme mastery of the genre, and he is no less resourceful in his accompanied choral works which sometimes include unison sections and have stirring organ accompaniments, conveying a satisfying warmth and richness of emotional expression appropriate to his carefully chosen texts. Wood collaborated with priest and poet George Ratcliffe Woodward in the revival and popularisation of renaissance tunes to new English religious texts, notably co-editing three books of carols. He also wrote eight string quartets, and was co-founder (in 1904) of the Irish Folk Song Society. He married Charlotte Georgina Wills-Sandford, daughter of W. R. Wills-Sandford, of Castlerea, Co. Roscommon, Ireland on 17 March 1898. Their son was killed in the First World War. He is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge,A Guide to Churchill College, Cambridge: text by Dr. Mark Goldie, pages 62 and 63 (2009) together with his wife. There is a memorial to him in the north aisle at St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh.\\"Funary Monuments & Memorials in St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh\\" Curl, J.S. pp52-53: Whitstable; Historical Publications; 2013 List of works=Stage *A Scene from Pickwick, chamber opera in 1 act (after Charles Dickens) (1921) *The Family Party, chamber opera in 1 act (1923) *several pieces of incidental music to plays Orchestral *Piano Concerto in F major (1886) *Patrick Sarsfield.

The compound is a very hard material that has a Wurtzite crystal structure. Its wide band gap of 3.4 eV affords it special properties for applications in optoelectronic, high-power and high-frequency devices. For example, GaN is the substrate which makes violet (405 nm) laser diodes possible, without use of nonlinear optical frequency-doubling. Its sensitivity to ionizing radiation is low (like other group III nitrides), making it a suitable material for solar cell arrays for satellites. Military and space applications could also benefit as devices have shown stability in radiation environments. Because GaN transistors can operate at much higher temperatures and work at much higher voltages than gallium arsenide (GaAs) transistors, they make ideal power amplifiers at microwave frequencies. In addition, GaN offers promising characteristics for THz devices. Due to high power density and voltage breakdown limits GaN is also emerging as a promising candidate for 5G cellular base station applications. Physical properties GaN crystal GaN is a very hard (12¬±2 GPaGallium Nitride as an Electromechanical Material. R-Z. IEEE 2014), mechanically stable wide bandgap semiconductor material with high heat capacity and thermal conductivity. In its pure form it resists cracking and can be deposited in thin film on sapphire or silicon carbide, despite the mismatch in their lattice constants. GaN can be doped with silicon (Si) or with oxygenWetzel, C.; Suski, T.; Ager, J.W. III; Fischer, S.; Meyer, B.K.; Grzegory, I.; Porowski, S. (1996) Strongly localized donor level in oxygen doped gallium nitride, International conference on physics of semiconductors, Berlin (Germany), 21‚Äì26 July 1996. to n-type and with magnesium (Mg) to p-type. However, the Si and Mg atoms change the way the GaN crystals grow, introducing tensile stresses and making them brittle. Gallium nitride compounds also tend to have a high dislocation density, on the order of 108 to 1010 defects per square centimeter.Preuss, Paul (11 August 2000). Blue Diode Research Hastens Day of Large-Scale Solid-State Light Sources. Berkeley Lab., lbl.gov. The wide band-gap behavior of GaN is connected to specific changes in the electronic band structure, charge occupation and chemical bond regions. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) provided the first measurement of the high field electron velocity in GaN in 1999. Scientists at ARL experimentally obtained a peak steady-state velocity of 1.9 x 107 cm/s, with a transit time of 2.5 picoseconds, attained at an electric field of 225 kV/cm. With this information, the electron mobility was calculated, thus providing data for the design of GaN devices. Developments GaN with a high crystalline quality can be obtained by depositing a buffer layer at low temperatures. Such high- quality GaN led to the discovery of p-type GaN, p-n junction blue/UV-LEDs and room-temperature stimulated emission (essential for laser action). This has led to the commercialization of high-performance blue LEDs and long-lifetime violet-laser diodes, and to the development of nitride-based devices such as UV detectors and high-speed field-effect transistors. LEDs High- brightness GaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs) completed the range of primary colors, and made applications such as daylight visible full-color LED displays, white LEDs and blue laser devices possible. The first GaN-based high-brightness LEDs used a thin film of GaN deposited via Metal-Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE) on sapphire. Other substrates used are zinc oxide, with lattice constant mismatch of only 2% and silicon carbide (SiC). Group III nitride semiconductors are, in general, recognized as one of the most promising semiconductor families for fabricating optical devices in the visible short-wavelength and UV region. Transistors The very high breakdown voltages, high electron mobility and saturation velocity of GaN has also made it an ideal candidate for high-power and high-temperature microwave applications, as evidenced by its high Johnson's figure of merit. Potential markets for high-power/high-frequency devices based on GaN include microwave radio-frequency power amplifiers (such as those used in high-speed wireless data transmission) and high-voltage switching devices for power grids. A potential mass-market application for GaN-based RF transistors is as the microwave source for microwave ovens, replacing the magnetrons currently used. The large band gap means that the performance of GaN transistors is maintained up to higher temperatures (~400 ¬∞CWhy Gallium Nitride?) than silicon transistors (~150 ¬∞C) because it lessens the effects of thermal generation of charge carriers that are inherent to any semiconductor. The first gallium nitride metal semiconductor field-effect transistors (GaN MESFET) were experimentally demonstrated in 1993 and they are being actively developed. In 2010 the first enhancement-mode GaN transistors became generally available. Only n-channel transistors were available. These devices were designed to replace power MOSFETs in applications where switching speed or power conversion efficiency is critical. These transistors are built by growing a thin layer of GaN on top of a standard silicon wafer. This allows the FETs to maintain costs similar to silicon power MOSFETs but with the superior electrical performance of GaN. Another seemingly viable solution for realizing enhancement-mode GaN-channel HFETs is to employ a lattice-matched quaternary AlInGaN layer of acceptably low spontaneous polarization mismatch to GaN. Applications=LEDs GaN-based violet laser diodes are used to read Blu-ray Discs. The mixture of GaN with In (InGaN) or Al (AlGaN) with a band gap dependent on ratio of In or Al to GaN allows the manufacture of light- emitting diodes (LEDs) with colors that can go from red to ultra-violet. Transistors GaN transistors are suitable for high frequency, high voltage, high temperature and high efficiency applications. GaN HEMTs have been offered commercially since 2006, and have found immediate use in various wireless infrastructure applications due to their high efficiency and high voltage operation. A second generation of devices with shorter gate lengths will address higher frequency telecom and aerospace applications.2010 IEEE Intl. Symposium, Technical Abstract Book, Session TH3D, pp. 164‚Äì165 GaN based MOSFET and MESFET transistors also offer advantages including lower loss in high power electronics, especially in automotive and electric car applications. Since 2008 these can be formed on a silicon substrate. High- voltage (800 V) Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) have also been made. GaN-based electronics (not pure GaN) has the potential to drastically cut energy consumption, not only in consumer applications but even for power transmission utilities. Unlike silicon transistors which switch off due to power surges, GaN transistors are typically depletion mode devices (i.e. on / resistive when the gate-source voltage is zero). Several methods have been proposed to reach normally-off (or E-mode) operation, which is necessary for use in power electronics: * the implantation of fluorine ions under the gate (the negative charge of the F-ions favors the depletion of the channel) * the use of a MIS- type gate stack, with recess of the AlGaN * the integration of a cascaded pair constituted by a normally-on GaN transistor and a low voltage silicon MOSFET * the use of a p-type layer on top of the AlGaN/GaN heterojunction Radars They are also utilized in military electronics such as active electronically scanned array radars.\\"Gallium Nitride-Based Modules Set New 180-Day Standard For High Power Operation.\\" Northrop Grumman, 13 April 2011. The U.S. Army funded Lockheed Martin to incorporate GaN active-device technology into the AN/TPQ-53 radar system to replace two medium-range radar systems, the AN/TPQ-36 and the AN/TPQ-37. The AN/TPQ-53 radar system was designed to detect, classify, track, and locate enemy indirect fire systems, as well as unmanned aerial systems. The AN/TPQ-53 radar system provided enhanced performance, greater mobility, increased reliability and supportability, lower life-cycle cost, and reduced crew size compared to the AN/TPQ-36 and the AN/TPQ-37 systems. Lockheed Martin fielded other tactical operational radars with GaN technology in 2018, including TPS-77 Multi Role Radar System deployed to Latvia and Romania. In 2019, Lockheed Martin's partner ELTA Systems Limited, developed a GaN-based ELM-2084 Multi Mission Radar that was able to detect and track air craft and ballistic targets, while providing fire control guidance for missile interception or air defense artillery. On April 8 2020, Saab flight tested its new GaN designed AESA X-band radar in a JAS-39 Gripen fighter. Saab already offers products with GaN based radars, like the Giraffe radar, Erieye, Globaleye, and Arexis EW. Nanoscale GaN nanotubes and nanowires are proposed for applications in nanoscale electronics, optoelectronics and biochemical-sensing applications. Spintronics potential When doped with a suitable transition metal such as manganese, GaN is a promising spintronics material (magnetic semiconductors). Synthesis=Bulk substrates GaN crystals can be grown from a molten Na/Ga melt held under 100 atmospheres of pressure of N2 at 750 ¬∞C. As Ga will not react with N2 below 1000 ¬∞C, the powder must be made from something more reactive, usually in one of the following ways: :2 Ga + 2 NH3 ‚Üí 2 GaN + 3 H2 :Ga2O3 \\\\+ 2 NH3 ‚Üí 2 GaN + 3 H2O Gallium nitride can also be synthesized by injecting ammonia gas into molten gallium at 900-980 ¬∞C at normal atmospheric pressure. Molecular beam epitaxy Commercially, GaN crystals can be grown using molecular beam epitaxy or metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy. This process can be further modified to reduce dislocation densities. First, an ion beam is applied to the growth surface in order to create nanoscale roughness. Then, the surface is polished. This process takes place in a vacuum. Safety GaN dust is an irritant to skin, eyes and lungs. The environment, health and safety aspects of gallium nitride sources (such as trimethylgallium and ammonia) and industrial hygiene monitoring studies of MOVPE sources have been reported in a 2004 review. Bulk GaN is non-toxic and biocompatible.Shipman, Matt and Ivanisevic, Albena (24 October 2011). \\"Research Finds Gallium Nitride is Non-Toxic, Biocompatible ‚Äì Holds Promise For Biomedical Implants\\".

It is a slit-like cavity formed in the diencephalon between the two thalami, in the midline between the right and left lateral ventricles, and is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Running through the third ventricle is the interthalamic adhesion, which contains thalamic neurons and fibers that may connect the two thalami. Structure The third ventricle is a narrow, laterally flattened, vaguely rectangular region, filled with cerebrospinal fluid, and lined by ependyma. It is connected at the superior anterior corner to the lateral ventricles, by the interventricular foramina, and becomes the cerebral aqueduct (... of Silvius) at the posterior caudal corner. Since the interventricular foramina are on the lateral edge, the corner of the third ventricle itself forms a bulb, known as the anterior recess (it is also known as the bulb of the ventricle). The roof of the ventricle comprises choroid plexus, forming the inferior central portion of the tela choroidea; immediately above the superior central portion of the tela choroidea is the fornix. The lateral side of the ventricle is marked by a sulcus - the hypothalamic sulcus - from the inferior side of the interventricular foramina to the anterior side of the cerebral aqueduct. The lateral border posterior/superior of the sulcus constitutes the thalamus, while anterior/inferior of the sulcus it constitutes the hypothalamus. The interthalamic adhesion usually tunnels through the thalamic portion of the ventricle, joining together the left and right halves of the thalamus, although it is sometimes absent, or split into more than one tunnel through the ventricle; it is currently unknown whether any nerve fibres pass between the left and right thalamus via the adhesion (it has more resemblance to a herniation than a commissure). The posterior border of the ventricle primarily constitutes the epithalamus. The superior part of the posterior border constitutes the habenular commissure, while more centrally it the pineal gland, which regulates sleep and reacts to light levels. Caudal of the pineal gland is the posterior commissure; nerve fibres reach the posterior commissure from the adjacent midbrain, but their onward connection is currently uncertain. The commissures create concavity to the shape of the posterior ventricle border, causing the suprapineal recess above the habenular, and the deeper pineal recess between the habenular and posterior commissures; the recesses being so-named due to the pineal recess being bordered by the pineal gland. The hypothalmic portion of the third ventricle (upper right), and surrounding structures The anterior wall of the ventricle forms the lamina terminalis, within which the vascular organ monitors and regulates the osmotic concentration of the blood; the cerebrum lies beyond the lamina, and causes it to have a slightly concave shape. The optic recess - marks the inferior end of the lamina terminalis, with the optic chiasm forming the immediately adjacent floor. The portion of the floor immediately posterior of the optic chiasm distends inferiorly, and slightly anteriorly, to form a funnel (the infundibulum); the recess leading to the funnel is known as the infundibular recess. The border of the funnel is the tuber cinereum, which constitutes a bundle of nerve fibres from the hypothalamus. The funnel ends in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, which is thus neurally connected to the hypothalamus via the tuber cinereum. A venous sinus (the circular sinus) surrounds the superior portion of the tuber cinereum; the circular sinus is in fact simply a portion of the two lateral cavernous sinuses, joined together by a posterior and anterior intercavernous sinus. The mammillary bodies form the floor posterior of the tuber cinereum, acting as the link between the fornix and the hypothalamus. Posterior of the mamillary bodies, the ventricle becomes the opening of the cerebral aqueduct, the inferior borders becoming the crus cerebri (sometimes historically called the cerebral peduncle) of the midbrain. Development The third ventricle, like other parts of the ventricular system of the brain, develops from the neural canal of the neural tube. Specifically, it originates from the most rostral portion of the neural tube which initially expands to become the prosencephalon. The lamina terminalis is the rostral termination of the neural tube. After about five weeks, different portions of the prosencephalon begin to take distinct developmental paths from one another - the more rostral portion becomes the telencephalon, while the more caudal portion becomes the diencephalon. The telencephalon gradually expands laterally to a much greater extent than it does dorsally or ventrally, and its connection to the remainder of the neural tube reduces to the interventricula foramina. The diencephalon expands more evenly, but caudally of the diencephalon the canal remains narrow. The third ventricle is the space formed by the expanding canal of the diencephalon. The hypothalamic region of the ventricle develops from the ventral portion of the neural tube, while the thalamic region develops from the dorsal portion; the wall of the tube thickens and becomes the hypothalamus and thalamus respectively. The hypothalamic area of the ventricle begins to distend ventrally during the 5th week of development, creating the infundibulum and posterior pituitary; an outgrowth from the stomodeum (the future mouth) gradually extends towards it, to form the anterior pituitary. The optic recess is noticeable by the end of the 6th week, by which time a bend is distinguishable in the dorsal portion of the ventricle border. Rostral of the bend, the medial dorsal portion of the ventrical begins to flatten, and become secretory (i.e. choroid plexus), forming the roof of the ventricle. Caudal of the bend, the ventricle border forms the epithalamus, and begins to distend towards the parietal bone (in lower vertebrates, it distends more specifically to the parietal eye); the border of the distention forms the pineal gland. Clinical significance The floor of the third ventricle is formed by hypothalamic structures and this can be opened surgically between the mamillary bodies and the pituitary gland in a procedure called an endoscopic third ventriculostomy. An endoscopic third ventriculostomy can be performed in order to release extra fluid caused by hydrocephalus. Several studies have found evidence of ventricular enlargement to be associated with major depression, particularly enlargement of the third ventricle. These observations are interpreted as indicating a loss of neural tissue in brain regions adjacent to the enlarged ventricle, leading to suggestions that cytokines and related mediators of neurodegeneration may play a role in giving rise to the disease. A chordoid glioma is a rare tumour that can arise in the third ventricle. Additional images File:Gray734.pngThird ventricle File:Gray717.pngCoronal section of brain immediately in front of pons.

Around 2002 and 2003, this security policy seemed to merge with the foreign policy doctrine known as China's peaceful rise. The new security concept has influenced a number of Chinese foreign policies in the 1990s and early 21st century, including better relations with ASEAN, the formation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation Between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation with Russia, as well as joint efforts with the United States to control nuclear proliferation in North Korea.

It only sold music for download through its website but added a print-CD-on-demand service in late 2004 and in October 2007 began selling complete albums and individual tracks through Amazon.com. In May 2008, Magnatune launched all-you-can-eat membership plans. From March 2010 Magnatune dropped the CD printing service and moved exclusively to all- you-can-eat membership plans. Magnatune was the first record label to license music online and as of May 2015 had sold over 7,000 licenses in its twelve years of existence. Overview Magnatune makes non-exclusive agreements with artists and gives them fifty percent of any proceeds from online sales or licensing. These kinds of policies were very unusual for a record label in 2003‚Äì2004. Users can stream or download music in MP3 format (no DRM) without charge before choosing whether to buy or not. (Some MP3s available for free download have Magnatune advertisements in them.) Buyers used to be able to purchase individual albums and choose their own price, from US$5 to $18 per album, but in March 2010 Magnatune moved to a subscriptions-only business model, where buyers have to purchase a monthly subscription (with a three- month minimum) under which they can download as much music as they like from Magnatune. Customers may download music they have purchased in WAV, FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis and AAC encoding formats. Music files sold by Magnatune do not use any form of digital rights management to prevent customers from making copies of music files they have purchased; Magnatune actually encourage buyers to share up to three copies with friends. All of the tracks downloaded free of charge are licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial- ShareAlike License. Even though using liberal licensing is not a new idea in itself, Magnatune is one of the first and most visible companies to try to build a business in music around this idea. Founder John Buckman is founder of Magnatune. In 1994, Buckman and his ex-wife Jan Hanford founded Lyris Technologies. Buckman was CEO and primary programmer of Lyris' product line: Lyris ListServer, MailShield, and MailEngine. He sold the company in June 2005. In August 2006, he launched the for-profit corporation BookMooch, an online community for the exchange of used books, which--in combination with his work with Magnatune--has associated Buckman with the Free Culture movement. In September 2007, he was elected to the Board of Directors of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and in February 2010 was appointed chairman of the board. In April 2015 Buckman launched Decent Espresso, a company that is designing a new home espresso machine. Buckman is the co-author of an article in SysAdmin Magazine (later acquired by Dr. Dobbs) entitled \\"Which OS is Fastest for High-Performance Network Applications?\\" and the author of an article in Linux Journal entitled \\"Magnatune, an Open Music Experiment.\\" Integration with media players Magnatune has an XML API that has made integration within media players possible. Amarok (from version 1.4.4, released in October 2006) allows users to preview and buy music from all signed artists from within the application. Rhythmbox 0.9.7 added this functionality in December 2006. A Slim Devices plugin for Logitech Media Server is available. A plugin for Songbird is also available. Clementine added support for Magnatune in version 0.4.

He helped to form the Scots National League, which joined with other bodies to form the National Party of Scotland, which in turn evolved into the Scottish National Party (SNP). Biography Gillies was born in the Galloway region of Scotland in 1865, but grew up in London. He was interested in Scottish History from an early age and at the age of seventeen he became friend to John Murdoch who was then the editor of The Highlander. Gillies became as enthusiastic for the rights of crofters in the Scottish highlands and joined the Highland Land League. He was at this stage enthusiastic for some form of home rule for Scotland within the United Kingdom but grew to support Scottish independence instead. Gillies also began to learn Gaelic and wrote a number of plays in the language, also serving as secretary of the Gaelic Society of London from 1904 to 1905. However he stood down as secretary when the society rejected his proposal that they should campaign to make Gaelic the national language of Scotland. Gillies, encouraged by Murdoch, also became aware of the developments in the politics of Ireland becoming an ardent supporter of Sinn F√©in, associating with prominent figures such as Art O'Brien who would become the head of the Irish Self Determination League. He supported the Easter Rising of 1916 and was deeply critical of those socialists who refused to support it, along with those in the Scottish Gaelic revival circles who refused to support it. Gillies formed a friendship with Ruairidh Erskine of Mar contributing articles to his publications, Guth na Bliadhna (Voice of the Year) and Alba. In 1920 the Scots National League (SNL) was formed and these two mean became its principal leaders. Gillies hoped that the SNL would reflect the revolutionary aims of the Irish nationalists by then engaged in a war of independence with the British state. He hoped that it would be the organisation which would lead Scotland to independence and revive the Gaelic language. Gillies became a regular contributor to the SNL's regular publication Liberty (which was in fact in part funded by Sinn F√©in). Gillies was involved in a little-known chapter of Scotland's history when he was involved in the establishment of a volunteer force which was ready to use armed force to win Scottish independence. This body (styled Fianna na hAlba) abandoned their plans on the advice of the Irish nationalist leadership. Michael Collins, in a letter to Art O'Brien stated that they were weaker than the Irish nationalist forces at even their weakest point during their war of independence and stated, \\"they do not appreciate the particular difficulties they are up against\\". In 1926 Gillies became the first editor of the SNL's newspaper, The Scots Independent. Gillies and Erskine led the SNL into the formation of the National Party of Scotland (NPS) in 1928, which was far more moderate than the SNL. This resulted in many SNL members leaving the NPS dissatisfied with their methods. Gillies died in 1932, two years before the NPS evolved in the Scottish National Party (SNP), which at the time was even more moderate than the NPS had been. Legacy Angus Clark, one of Gillies' closest friends wrote on hearing of his death, \\"he has left an example of noble effort, great faith and true devotion to his country.\\" Gillies' granddaughter, Anne Lorne Gillies, is active in politics, contesting the 1999 elections to the European Parliament as an SNP candidate.

Though allied on some issues with Democratic advocates of labor, most of those to whom the term has been applied are conservative or neoconservative. However, few occupied positions of high power within the Bush administration, instead tending to work for the Pentagon, the US Intelligence Community, private think tanks, and media outlets. Origin and application of the term The name comes from the color representing US forces in war games, in contrast to the red that represents the American opponent. It was coined by William Triplett, former counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Gertz 46. He meant to describe a divergence arising originally from changing Sino-American relations, particularly as regards the political status of Taiwan. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989,Kaiser and Mufson A1. and in the context of China's economic expansion, \\"blue\\" concerns widened in scope.Friedman 72. They worried about China's military and diplomatic ambitions not only in Asia but around the world; they worried about China's protectionist economic policies; most immediately, they worried about the tendency toward accommodation of China by many people in the US government, the unprecedented influence China has on the US economy, and the movement of American investments and industry to China. Though now applied primarily to Republicans, the terms refers to concerns not tied to a single party or perspective. Bill Clinton campaigned in 1992 against George H. W. Bush's supposed laxness toward China, but while in office uncoupled economic integration with democratic reform in China.Friedman 66. Though the Republican platform in 2000 criticized Clinton's treatment of China, George W. Bush did not fully embrace the \\"blue\\" interpretation of China's aims, nor did he reverse Clinton's policy of constructive engagement. Individuals associated with the interpretation The original core of the \\"blue team\\" was a group of Congressional aides who met in an informal study group during the 1990s.Kaiser and Mufson 11. Working largely behind the scenes, these aides influenced legislation in subtle and incremental ways. They were involved in attaching to bills riders that forced the State Department to report on human rights abuses and the Defense Department to reveal information it had collected about the Chinese military. Perhaps their largest accomplishment was the passage of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act in 2000. Christopher Cox is a semi-prominent American politician who is considered a member of the Blue Team. By and large, most high-profile American politicians have not spoken out stridently enough against China to be called members of the Blue Team.\\"Bush Policy\\" 11. Some minor politicians have been closely associated with the group or its ideas. Among them are Christopher Cox, chairman of the commission that produced the Cox Report on Chinese espionage; and Gary Bauer, who attacked China virulently during his abortive 2000 campaign for president. The Bush administration has for the most part followed the \\"pragmatic\\" approach that has been dominant in US foreign relations since the Shanghai Communiqu√©, which allows for \\"engagement\\" with China. More than the Clinton administration, it has been willing to see China as a strategic competitor,Rice. and it has been \\"far more eager...to treat China with suspicion and adopt more hard-nosed policies.\\"Ikenberry 433. Still, the dominant voices of the \\"team\\" since 2001 have come not from government but from private conservative think tanks and journalists. William Kristol, whose The Weekly Standard once described the PRC as \\"a regime of hair-curling, systematic barbarity,\\"Quoted in Gries, 5. has called repeatedly for a harsher stance against China. Robert Kagan, co-founder of PNAC. The Washington Times columnist Bill Gertz, Ross H. Munro and David Blumenthal and Peter Navarro have all written extensively about the perceived threat posed by China. Navarro 2011 book with Greg Autry, Death by China, inspired a 2012 documentary film, directed by Navarro and narrated by Martin Sheen. Beliefs The beliefs associated with \\"Blue Team\\" opinions arise largely from dissatisfaction with the general drift of American foreign policy toward accommodation with the PRC. The massacre in Tiananmen Square and China's later use of a missile test in an attempt to influence Taiwanese voters sharpened fears about China's intentions;Buszynski 128. The more virulent critics of China accused Clinton of appeasement.Timperlake passim. For some of this orientation, China's military is the focal point of concern, as it was for the original Congressional study group. They point out that China is not only modernizing its army and navy, but is also hiding its actual military expenditures. They claim that China aspires to dominate the region through, for example, the creation of a blue-water navy, and that such dominance would inevitably endanger US interests and threaten long-time allies Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Blue Team members thus harshly criticized the Commerce department's decision to allow the sale of supercomputers to China because these computers could have military applications. Influence Despite concern for maintaining the status quo, the Cold War security strategy emphasized the ideological difference between China and the US. As the Soviet Union collapsed and Russia's economy and military were still in turmoil, it seemed to some observers logical that China would seek to replace Russia as the main counterbalance to the United States.Feffer 123. Still, the \\"blue\\" perspective views with alarm China's increased military spending and the passing of the Taiwan anti-secession law in 2005.Drell 243. This was of major concern to US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld since the Pentagon had frequently complained about the lack of transparency in China's military capabilities and intentions. A recent threat report from the Pentagon reinforced the Blue Team's fears, stating that China may be attempting a military buildup aimed at capturing Taiwan and deterring outside help from the US and/or Japan. Finally, though US policy towards North Korea has depended partly on China's cooperation, some \\"hawks\\" in the US suspect China's motives with regards to that country as well.Scobell 344-5.

He learned Gestalt psychology from studying under Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang K√∂hler at the University of Berlin and applied it to art.The Intelligence of Vision: An Interview with Rudolf Arnheim His magnum opus was his book Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye (1954). Other major books by Arnheim have included Visual Thinking (1969), and The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts (1982). Art and Visual Perception was revised, enlarged and published as a new version in 1974, and it has been translated into fourteen languages. He lived in Germany, Italy, England, and America where he taught at Sarah Lawrence College, Harvard University, and the University of Michigan. He has greatly influenced art history and psychology in America. In Art and Visual Perception, Arnheim tries to use science to better understand art. In his later book Visual Thinking (1969), Arnheim critiques the assumption that language goes before perception. For Arnheim, the only access to reality we have is through our senses. Arnheim also argues that perception is strongly identified with thinking, and that artistic expression is another way of reasoning. In The Power of the Center, Arnheim addresses the interaction of art and architecture on concentric and grid spatial patterns. He argues that form and content are indivisible, and that the patterns created by artists reveal the nature of human experience. Early years Rudolf Arnheim was born into a Jewish family in 1904 on Alexanderplatz, in Berlin.Rudolf Arnheim: The Little Owl on the Shoulder of Athene Not long after he was born, his family moved to Kaiserdamm in Charlottenburg, where they stayed until the early 1930s. He was interested in art from a young age, as he began drawing as a child.A Conversation with Rudolf Arnheim His father, Georg Arnheim, owned a small piano factory, and Georg Arnheim's plan for his son was for him to take over the factory. However, Rudolf wanted to continue his education, so his father agreed that he could spend half his week at the university and the other half at the factory. Rudolf ended up spending more time at the university, and when he was at the factory he was distracting the employees with his inquisitions about the mechanics of the piano, so his father agreed to let him focus entirely on his education. Rudolf was interested in psychology as long as he could remember, with his specific memory of buying some of the first editions of Sigmund Freud's books when he was fifteen or sixteen. These fueled his interest in psychoanalysis.  Career  Arnheim attended the University of Berlin, where he wished to focus his studies on psychology. At that time, psychology was a branch of philosophy, so Arnheim ended up majoring in experimental psychology and philosophy, and minoring in art history and music. There were many prominent faculty members at the university at this time, the most notable being Albert Einstein, Max Planck, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang K√∂hler. Because Max Wertheimer and Wolfgang K√∂hler were in the psychology department, most of the psychology concerned Gestalt Psychology. The Psychological Institute of Berlin University was located on two floors of the Imperial Palace, so Arnheim worked in makeshift laboratories decorated with paintings of angels and other artwork. This institute was more of a workshop because everyone was doing experiments and using each other rather than sitting in lectures. For Arnheim's dissertation, Max Wertheimer asked him to study human facial expressions and handwriting and how they corresponded. He looked at the extent to which people perceive an expression when they look at a face and what they perceive from a person's handwriting, as well as how the two corresponded. This was the beginning of Arnheim's study of expression, which he moved to looking at with visual arts. In 1928, he received his doctorate. In the mid-20s, Arnheim started writing film criticism for the Stachelschwein. Meanwhile, he sent his works to Siegfried Jacobsohn, the chief editor at Die Weltb√ºhne, who accepted them. When Jacobsohn died in 1928, Ossietzky took over and then Arnheim came to work on the cultural section until 1933. In the fall of 1932, Arnheim had an essay published in the Berliner Tageblatt, about three months before the Nazis came to power. The essay was about the nature of Charlie Chaplin's and Hitler's moustaches and what the moustache did to the nose in terms of human character. Considering the timing of this essay, and the fact that in 1933 the sale of his book Film as Art was no longer permitted due to the Nazis, some of Arnheim's friends advised him that he should leave the country and so, in August 1933, he moved to Rome. Arnheim lived and wrote about film and radio in Rome for the next six years. When World War II broke out, he moved to London, and he worked as a wartime translator for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He moved to the United States in 1940 and was shocked by all the lights of New York City. For him it was \\"the end of exile\\" since he had been used to living with constant black outs in London. In 1943 he became a psychology professor at Sarah Lawrence College and a visiting lecturer at the New School for Social Research. Around this time he received two major awards. First, he received a Fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation. With this he worked at Columbia University with their Office of Radio Research to analyze soap-operas and how they affected American audiences. He also received the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1942 in order to study perception in art. He ideally wanted to write about applying Gestalt theory to visual arts, but felt he did not have enough research. He postponed the book in order to do more studies on space, expression, and movement. In 1951, Arnheim got another Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship so that he could take a leave from teaching and he wrote Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye. Arnheim was invited to join Harvard University as Professor of the Psychology of Art in 1968, and he stayed there for six years. The Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard was an important building to him, as it was the only building designed in America by Le Corbusier and it was based on the modular theory. He retired in 1974 to Ann Arbor with his wife Mary. He became a Visiting Professor at the University of Michigan and taught there for ten years. Arnheim was a part of the American Society for Aesthetics and was their president for two terms, and was also the president for the Division on Psychology and the Arts of the American Psychological Association for three terms. In 1976 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He died in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 2007.  Works  Although Art and Visual Perception: A Psychology of the Creative Eye took fifteen months to complete, he felt that he essentially wrote it in one long sitting. Revised in 1974, it has been translated into fourteen languages, and is one of the most influential art books of the century. In Art and Visual Perception, he tries to use science to better understand art, still keeping in mind the important aspects of personal bias, intuition, and expression. Visual Thinking (1969) challenges the differences between thinking versus perceiving and intellect versus intuition. In it Arnheim critiques the assumption that language goes before perception and that words are the stepping stones of thinking. Sensory knowledge allows for the possibility of language, since the only access to reality we have is through our senses. Visual perception is what allows us to have a true understanding of experience. Arnheim also argues that perception is strongly identified with thinking, and that artistic expression is another way of reasoning. In The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts (1982), Arnheim addresses the interaction of art and architecture on concentric and grid spatial patterns. He argues that form and content are indivisible, and that the patterns created by artists reveal the nature of human experience.  Theories  Arnheim believed that most people have their most productive ideas in their early twenties. They get hooked on an idea and spend the rest of their lives expanding on it. Arnheim's productive or generative idea was that the meaning of life and the world could be perceived in the patterns, shapes, and colors of the world. Therefore, he believed that we have to study those patterns and discover what they mean. He also believed that artwork is visual thinking and a means of expression, not just putting shapes and colors together that look appealing. Art is a way to help people understand the world, and a way to see how the world changes through your mind. Its function is to show the essence of something, like our existence. Arnheim's writing and thinking were most important to him, and his goal was to understand things for himself. Arnheim maintained that vision and perception are creative, active understanding, and that we organize perceptions into structures and form with which to understand them. Without order we wouldn't understand anything, so the world is ordered just by being perceived. Overall, he wrote fifteen books about perceptual psychology and art, architecture, and film.

Commissioned late in the war, Suwanee spent several weeks searching for the Confederate raider CSS Shenandoah without success. Suwanee was eventually wrecked off British Columbia in 1868. Construction and design Suwanee--a double-ended, iron-hulled, sidewheel-propelled gunboat--was built for the U.S. Navy by Reaney, Son & Archbold of Chester, Pennsylvania. She was 255 feet in length, with a beam of 35 feet, draft of 9 feet, hold depth of 12 feet and displacement of 1,030 tons. Suwanee was powered by a 58-inch bore, 8-foot 9-inch stroke, inclined, direct-acting steam engine, fitted with a surface condenser. Steam was supplied by four boilers: two main boilers of the horizontal, tubular type, and two superheated. The ship was also rigged as a two-masted schooner for auxiliary sail power. Total cost of the vessel was $171,000.Daniels, p. 217. Suwanee was launched on 13 March 1864, delivered to the Navy at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 14 December, and commissioned on 23 January 1865, Comdr. Paul Shirley in command. Service history Ordered to the Pacific Ocean, the new double-ender departed Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at dawn on 17 February 1865 and proceeded via New York City down the Atlantic coast of the Americas looking for Confederate commerce raiders, especially for CSS Shenandoah, which had been plaguing Northern shipping. She then steamed up the Pacific coast and arrived at Acapulco, Mexico, where she joined the Pacific Squadron on 30 July. The side-wheeler was promptly ordered to sea in quest of Shenandoah. After the Southern cruiser Shenandoah surrendered at Liverpool, England, late in the year, Suwanee cruised along the Pacific coast from Mexico to Canada. On 9 July 1868, Suwanee was wrecked in Shadwell Passage, Queen Charlotte Sound, British Columbia.

In the Second World War he served in the British Army and then the Royal Indian Navy. He supported the Indian independence movement and for much of his life was active in the Scottish National Party (SNP). McRae is remembered for his mysterious death, in which his car crashed in a remote part of the Scottish Highlands and he was found shot in the head with a revolver. The official verdict was undetermined. Life McRae was born in Carron, Falkirk, where his father was an electrician. McRae edited a local newspaper in Grangemouth at the same time as reading history at the University of Glasgow, from which he gained a first- class degree. In the Second World War he was commissioned into the Seaforth Highlanders but transferred to the Royal Indian Navy, in which he became a lieutenant commander and aide-de-camp to Admiral Lord Mountbatten. He supported the Indian independence movement. After the war McRae returned to the University of Glasgow and graduated again, this time in law. He authored the maritime law of Israel and was an emeritus professor of the University of Haifa. After his death a forest of 3,000 trees was planted in Israel in his memory. McRae became a solicitor and an SNP activist. In both of the 1974 General Elections and in the 1979 General Election he stood for Parliament as the SNP candidate for Ross and Cromarty. In October 1974 he only lost to the Conservative Hamish Gray by 633 votes, but in 1979 Gray's majority increased to 4,735. In the latter year he also contested the SNP leadership, coming third in a three-way contest with 52 votes to Stephen Maxwell's 117 votes and winner Gordon Wilson's 530 votes. McRae was a vocal critic of the British nuclear lobby. Early in the 1980s he was a key figure in a campaign against the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority plans to dispose of nuclear waste in the Mullwharchar area of the Galloway Hills. Representing the SNP in a public inquiry, McRae asked difficult questions of the UKAEA and famously declared at one meeting that \\"nuclear waste should be stored where Guy Fawkes put his gunpowder.\\" The authority's plans were rejected, and McRae was credited with \\"single-handedly\\" preventing the area from becoming a nuclear waste dump. Death Loch Loyne, Glenmoriston, Inverness-shire. McRae and his car were found just off the road here. On 5 April 1985 McRae left his Glasgow flat at 18:30 to spend the weekend at his cottage at Ardelve near Dornie, Ross-shire. He was not seen again until the next morning around 10:00, when two Australian tourists saw his maroon Volvo saloon car on a moor a short distance from the junction of the A887 and A87 roads Bun Loyne, Glenmoriston, Inverness-shire. The car was straddling a burn about from the road. The tourists flagged down the next car to pass, whose driver turned out to be a doctor, Dorothy Messer, accompanied by her fianc√© as well as David Coutts, an SNP Dundee councillor who knew McRae. It was discovered that McRae was in the car. His hands were \\"folded on his lap\\", his head was \\"slumped on his right shoulder\\", and there was a \\"considerable amount of blood on his temple\\". He was not wearing a seat belt. Another car was sent to call the emergency services. Dr Messer examined McRae and found that he was still alive and breathing. She noted that one of his pupils was dilated, indicating the possibility of brain damage, and estimated that he had been in that state for 10 hours. McRae was removed by ambulance to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, accompanied by Dr Messer. After admission it was decided to transfer him to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. At Aberdeen it was realised that the incident was more than a road accident; six hours after he had been found, a nurse washing his head discovered what appeared to be the entry wound of a gunshot. An X-ray confirmed that McRae had been shot above his right ear and a bullet was detected in his head. His brain was severely damaged and his vital functions very weak. The next day, Sunday 7 April, after consultation with his next of kin, McRae's life-support machine was switched off. Investigation The investigation was headed by Chief Superintendent Andrew Lister of Northern Constabulary CID. Despite no weapon having yet been found, McRae's car was moved at 12:00 on 7 April. It later transpired that the police had kept no record of the precise location where the car had been found, and the position stated by them was later found to be in error, and was corrected by a witness who had been present at the scene. A weapon was found the next day, in the burn over which the car had been discovered, from the vehicle. It was a Smith & Wesson .22 calibre revolver containing two spent cartridges and five remaining rounds. Controversy Although it was ruled at the time by authorities that McRae's death was undetermined, aspects of the investigation remain disputed, some claiming that the distance from McRae's car at which the gun was found and the lack of fingerprints on it rendered a suicide not credible. At the time of his death, McRae had been working to counter plans to dump nuclear waste from the Dounreay Nuclear Power Development Establishment into the sea. Due to his house being burgled on repeated occasions prior to his death, he had taken to carrying a copy of the documents relating to his Dounreay work with him at all times. They were not found following his death, and the sole other copy which was kept in his office was stolen when it was burgled, no other items being taken. Neither McRae's medical reports nor the post-mortem data have been released to the public and there was no fatal accident inquiry. Aftermath Winnie Ewing ‚Äì then President of the SNP and herself an accomplished lawyer ‚Äì was directed by the SNP's National Executive Committee (NEC) to conduct an internal investigation for the party to come to a conclusion as to whether Ewing \\"was satisfied or dissatisfied with the official version that he committed suicide\\". Having been refused access to police records of the investigation and rebuffed by both the Lord Advocate and the Procurator Fiscal in her attempts to conduct private, confidential meetings with them, Ewing, as she later wrote, came \\"up against a brick wall\\". Ewing reported to the SNP NEC that she was not satisfied with the official account of suicide: \\"I do not know what happened, but I think it is important that the truth emerges, despite the time that has passed. Why the State refuses to let the truth be known is a pertinent question.\\" In 1991 Channel 4 broadcast a \\"Scottish Eye\\" documentary investigating the mysterious circumstances of McRae's death. It found evidence to suggest that McRae had been under surveillance by UK intelligence services and that his death had likely involved foul play. In 2005 Winnie Ewing's son Fergus, by then an MSP, requested a meeting with Elish Angiolini, Solicitor General for Scotland, to discuss allegations that have persisted that McRae was under surveillance at the time of his death. The request was rebuffed, with Angiolini claiming that he had not been under surveillance and that she was satisfied that a thorough investigation into the case had been carried out. In July 2006 a retired police officer, Iain Fraser, who was working as a private investigator at the time of McRae's death claimed that he had been anonymously employed to keep McRae under surveillance only weeks before he died. In November 2006 an episode of the Scottish Television show Unsolved examined the circumstances of McRae's death. In November 2010 John Finnie, then SNP group leader on Highland Council and a former police officer, wrote to the Lord Advocate urging her to reinvestigate McRae's death and release any details so far withheld. Finnie's request was prompted by the release the previous month of further details concerning the death of David Kelly. In January 2011 the Crown Office requested the files on the case from Northern Constabulary. Also in November 2010 Donald Morrison, a former Strathclyde Police officer, alleged that McRae had been \\"under surveillance\\" by both Special Branch and MI5. Morrison had collaborated with former colleague Iain Fraser to discover more about McRae's death. Morrison called for an enquiry into McRae's death and promised that he would give it a sworn affidavit that MI5 was involved. In July 2014 two unconnected plays by George Gunn and Andy Paterson about McRae's life and death, both coincidentally titled 3,000 Trees, were staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. One of the plays explored his anti-nuclear campaigning, links with nationalist radicals and allegations that Special Branch and MI5 were surveilling him. In November 2014 a Scottish Sunday Express front-page article alleged that McRae had uncovered evidence of the alleged paedophile ring in Westminster during the 1980s. The article suggests he may have been murdered and that the evidence he possessed was stolen at the time of his death. In April 2015 there was a campaign to have a Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) on McRae's death. It attracted 6,500 signatures in 5 days. The petition eventually collected over 13,000 signatures and was handed in, in June 2015. The Crown Office rejected the proposal to hold a Fatal Accident Inquiry.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-33133211 On the Easter weekend of April 2015, the 30th anniversary of McRae's death, Scotland on Sunday ran a story claiming that McRae's Volvo was moved back to the crash site by Northern Constabulary in an attempt to hide that the car had been moved before the bullet had been found ‚Äì accounting for the discrepancies relating to the gun's distance from the car. On the same day, one of the journalists involved started crowdfunding for a book on the case titled '30 Years of Silence'. Following the rejection of the petition for a Fatal Accident Inquiry by the Crown Office, a \\"Justice For Willie\\" Campaign group was set up by Mark MacNicol. The campaign decided to launch their own investigation since no official inquiry was forthcoming. They hired two private investigators to re- interview original witnesses from the time of Willie McRae's death. The results were published in November 2016, and the campaign were unable to find any new evidence to undermine the official suicide verdict.http://markmacnicol.com/willie-mcrae/ In October 2018, fresh doubt on the official verdict was raised again by a nurse who claims to have treated Willie McRae at Forrester Hill Hospital Aberdeen. Katharine Mcgonigal disputed that the bullet wound was to the right temple, as the post-mortem claimed, and said it was instead to the back of the neck.https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-herald-1130/20181029/281878709368803 ReferencesFurther reading * A fictionalised account of events leading up to McRae's death and its aftermath.

Its southern end is at London Bridge in the London Borough of Southwark, and its northern end is the Norfolk port town of King's Lynn. From London to Royston it chiefly follows the line of Roman Ermine Street. Route A10 in the City of London A10 outside Hertford facing south towards London A10 Wadesmill bypass undergoing remedial work before opening Within the City of London, the route of the A10 comprises King William Street, Gracechurch Street, Bishopsgate and Norton Folgate. It then becomes Shoreditch High Street, Kingsland Road, Kingsland High Street and Stoke Newington Road. It runs through Stoke Newington as Stoke Newington High Street and then becomes Stamford Hill, through Stamford Hill until Tottenham. In July 2013, the Tottenham Hale gyratory was removed and the A10 now follows the route of Tottenham High Road in both directions. North of Tottenham, the A10 leaves its historical route of Tottenham High Road/Hertford Road (now A1010) to join the Great Cambridge Road via Bruce Grove and The Roundway. The Roundway is the southern end of a long dual carriageway section of the A10, which extends to just south of Buntingford. This dual carriageway section bisects the London Borough of Enfield, skirting the Enfield fringes of Enfield Town before crossing the M25 motorway at junction 25, near Waltham Cross. Until the late 1970s, the Great Cambridge Road passed through the towns of Broxbourne, Hoddesdon and Warealong what is now the A1170 road. Since then, an all-purpose road from Cheshunt by-passes these towns. The Kingsmead Viaduct takes the A10 high over the Lea Valley between Hertford and Ware and the Hertford East Branch Line railway. North of Ware, a further by-pass scheme was opened in late 2004, taking the A10 around the Hertfordshire villages of Wadesmill, Thundridge, High Cross, and Collier's End. The bypass would have opened sooner, but the lime-stabilised subsoil heaved and cracks opened up in the road surface. A substantial portion of the road surface had to be relaid. Further north, there is another section of 1970s dual carriageway road between Puckeridge and Buntingford, the contract for which was awarded to Meres Construction Ltd in April 1972. Buntingford was by-passed in the 1980s, however this is only single carriageway. From Buntingford, the road runs through the villages of Chipping, Buckland and Reed, before reaching the edge of Hertfordshire in the market town of Royston. Once in Cambridgeshire, the topography changes from undulating hills to flat agricultural and fenlands, round the villages of Melbourn and Foxton (the road going over a level crossing adjacent to Foxton railway station), through Harston and up to the M11 motorway at junction 11, near Cambridge. A10 traffic is signposted to travel north on the M11, skirting round the top of Cambridge on the A14; however, the former course of the A10 turns into the A1309 and heads for the city centre. The original A10 went through the heart of the city, past the major colleges along King's Parade, before turning north-east at Midsummer Common. The A10 reappears to the north of Cambridge at the Milton Interchange of the A14 and heads north, bypassing Ely and Downham Market before reaching the coast at King's Lynn in Norfolk. Its northern section runs along the valley of the River Great Ouse (which meets A47 and A149). Abandoned schemes Where the A10 bisects Cheshunt as an urban dual carriageway, it is prone to traffic congestion, in particular because of the many junctions with local roads. In the early 1990s properties beside the road were compulsorily purchased for a relief scheme that involved sinking the road below ground level through Cheshunt and converting the original alignment to single carriageway for local access. However, in the wake of protests against a similar scheme in Wanstead, this was dropped and the road remains a dual carriageway, with surrounding houses having been sold back to private buyers.

It runs roughly north east from London to Norwich, Norfolk, although after the M11 opened in the 1970s and then the A12 extension in 1999, a lengthy section has been downgraded between the suburbs of east London and the north-west corner of the county of Essex. It also multiplexes/overlaps with the A14 on the Newmarket bypass. Route=City of London All this part has been declassified and is now a minor road. Thus the A11 now starts at Aldgate, just inside the eastern boundary of the City of London. The first stretch is Whitechapel High Street, east of the junction with Mansell Street. In a complex reworking of the roads since the days of the Aldgate gyratory system, it is two-way, but the east-bound section is part of the ring-road that retained a one-way system south of this junction, but the west-bound section is for local access and you have to U-turn to avoid entering the congestion charging zone. Tower Hamlets East of Aldgate station, the A11 enters the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and the East End of London. It becomes Whitechapel High Street (containing Aldgate East Underground station), again part of the Aldgate one-way system. The A11 passes through Whitechapel, past Whitechapel station and the Royal London Hospital. It becomes Mile End Road at the eastern end of Whitechapel Road, at Mile End Gate, the former toll gate for the turnpike, passing The Genesis Cinema, passing Stepney Green Underground station, with Stepney to the south, and then Mile End Underground station. Next, it becomes Bow Road, passing Bow Road Underground station and Bow Church DLR station. There is a dual carriageway flyover over the Bow Interchange roundabout, a junction with the A12. However, at the end of the flyover, the A11 crosses into the London Borough of Newham and becomes a western extension to the A118. Following the opening of the A12 extension in 1999, the A11 was re-numbered to make it seem a less important road and encourage traffic to use the new dual carriageway between there and Leytonstone. This is the western limit of the downgraded section. Cambridgeshire and Suffolk A1307 Junction near to Babraham, Cambridgeshire. The road enters Cambridgeshire, with the road number A11 finally re-appearing at M11 Junction 9A, and the A11 is now a trunk road. It roughly follows the route of a Roman road for the remainder of its length. The A11 formerly went through Newmarket; that stretch is now the A1304. The Newmarket bypass, opened to traffic in July 1975, is a dual carriageway. The western end is the A11, but most of its length is a multiplex/overlap with the A14. The A11 re-appears north-east of Newmarket, and remained a dual carriageway. The road bypasses Barton Mills before entering Norfolk in the Thetford Forest, passing the 113-foot-tall () Elveden War Memorial. This section of the road opened as a dual carriageway on 12 December 2014. This completes the dualling of the trunk road between Norwich and London. Norfolk A47 and A11. The upgrading of the final section of single carriageway between Barton Mills and Thetford (opened December 2014) means the road is dual carriageway all the way to Norwich. The road continues northeast bypassing Thetford, Attleborough and Wymondham. The A11 originally ran through the centre of all three towns giving rise to congestion which frequently became the focus of delays on the route. It also passes the Snetterton Circuit motor racing venue. On entering Norwich, it becomes single carriageway again and is called Newmarket Road. It terminates at the St Stephens Street roundabout near the city centre. Various sections of the A11 between the junction the M11 in Cambridgeshire and Norwich have recently been upgraded to dual carriageway. The Roudham Heath to Attleborough section was dualled in 2003 and the Attleborough bypass was dualed in 2007. The previously single carriageway road between Thetford and the Fiveways roundabout is now dual carriageway and opened in December 2014.  Cycling = London  Cycle Superhighway 2 (CS2) runs alongside the A11 between Aldgate and the A12 in Bow. One-way cycle tracks run along either side of the A11 through Whitechapel, Mile End, and Bow, carrying cyclists from the City to Stratford. The route runs unbroken; the route is signposted and marked using blue paint and cycle icons. At Bow, where the A11 meets the A12, CS2 leaves the main carriageway along slip roads, and cyclists may congregate at an Advanced Stop Line - in both directions - to cross the roundabout, rejoining the main carriageway on the other side of the roundabout. East of Bow, CS2 runs along either side of the A118 to Stratford station, and cycle lanes are provided as far as Ilford.  Norwich  The Wymondham to Sprowston Pedalway runs along the A11/Newmarket Road. To the west, the Pedalway joins the A11 at Eaton. Westbound destinations include Cringleford, Hethersett, and Wymondham. Running northeast, the Pedalway is signposted along a shared-use path adjacent to the Newmarket-bound (westbound) carriageway. The route crosses the A140/Daniels Road and continues along Newmarket Road as a shared-use path. It leaves the A11 in a northerly direction at the junction with the A1056/Ipswich Road. The route runs through Norwich City Centre to Sprowston. Completed improvements=A11 Fiveways ‚Äì Thetford Improvement Proposals to dual 14.8 km of the road between the Fiveways Roundabout at Barton Mills, bypassing Elveden to the North and joining the western end of the Thetford Bypass had been discussed for many years without any developments being made. Draft Orders together with an Environmental Statement were published in Autumn 2008. The Labour government's Secretary of State for Transport announced the scheme would be brought forward by 18 months to 2010 with an open date of 2013 in November 2008 in response to the Financial crisis of 2007-2008. Supporters expressed concern in September 2010 that the scheme would be cancelled as part of the coalition government's comprehensive spending review noting that the report from the public inquiry had not yet been signed off by the Department for Transport. The Highways Agency has published an official map of the proposed scheme and a Google overlay map is also available. The original cost estimate was ¬£30 million rising to ¬£60 million in March 2007 and then to ¬£113-¬£157 million by August 2008. The project received strong support from local business groups and local government and was expected to reduce journey times by 3 minutes off-peak and up to 25 minutes at peak times. Environmental campaign groups believed that in a time of economic downturn it would be better to invest in local public transport rather than on costly road schemes. On 20 October 2010, the government approved the scheme, indicating that the works would continue. The works were due to start January 2013 and finish September 2014 The Elveden Bypass opened during Easter 2014 with one lane in use each way. The full dual carriageway between Barton Mills and Thetford was opened on 12 December 2014 by transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin. Former sections=City of London Originally, the A11 started at the Bank of England in the City of London, next to Bank Underground station, and went eastwards along Cornhill and Leadenhall Street, past Aldgate Pump and along Aldgate. Hence leading to the current A11 starting point at Aldgate. Newham From Bow Interchange, A118 briefly becomes a dual carriageway as it crosses the valley of the River Lea. This dual carriageway section ends in a one-way system marking Stratford town centre. The eastbound road, Great Eastern Road, passes Stratford station. The westbound road is called Broadway and The Grove; the latter road runs north-south. At the end of the one-way system, The Grove becomes two-way, still going north. The old A11 then becomes Leytonstone Road; Maryland railway station turns northwards on the corner where the name change occurs. Meanwhile, the A118 heads eastward along its route towards Ilford and Romford. The A112 also joins the one-way system, heading north-south. Waltham Forest North of Maryland, the old A11 crosses from the London Borough of Newham into the London Borough of Waltham Forest and becomes High Road Leytonstone, passing under the Gospel Oak to Barking Line. Redbridge Once past the Green Man Interchange, the former A11 route enters the London Borough of Redbridge and briefly becomes a southern extension to the A113 before turning into the A1199 (a duplicate designation, given that there is another A1199 in Islington), and is called Hollybush Hill, Woodford Road and High Road Woodford Green. It crosses over the A406 at Gates Corner (named after a Ford car showroom, which was turned into residential flats in 2006), but since the A406 was widened when the M11 was constructed there are no slip roads for interchange and the old A11 passes over the top. It merges with the A104 Woodford New Road by the Statue of Winston Churchill and becomes the A104 High Road Woodford Green. North, the road was A11 until the M11 opened in the 1970s, triggering the downgrading of the A11 between Woodford and Stump Cross (see below). Just before leaving London for Essex, the A104 becomes Epping New Road. Essex, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire Shortly after entering Essex, the A11 enters Epping Forest, following the mainly straight course of the Epping New Road turnpike constructed during the second quarter of the nineteenth century, alongside the boundary between Waltham Abbey and Loughton. It then reaches the Wake Arms Roundabout and becomes the B1393. Just after leaving the forest, it crosses the M25 motorway (here lowered into a cut-and-cover tunnel), then continuing through Epping. The B1393 ends at junction 7 of the M11, and the route of the A11 goes along the A414 through the eastern suburbs of Harlow, having been rerouted slightly to the west at the end of the 1950s to avoid passing through Potter Street. The road then becomes the A1184 and goes through Sawbridgeworth: through the rest of the Essex stretch between Harlow and Stump Cross the road follows a more traditionally English course, characterised by bends of varying and sometimes uneven radii, with just one straight mile (1.6 km) (to the south of Littlebury) along the north Essex stretch. Just south of Bishop's Stortford, the A1184 turns sharp left to become part of the Bishop's Stortford bypass, but the route of the A11 becomes the B1383 and goes through the town and through Stansted Mountfitchet and Quendon. It crosses the M11 and passes Audley End. The B1383 ends at 9A (Stump Cross), the end of a spur that comes off the M11 at Junction 9, near Great Chesterford. From there, the former A11 section aligns once more with the current A11.

The A13 route is a relatively recent addition to London's radial network, having been built at the beginning of the 19th century to connect the City with the (then) newly expanding Docklands area. Commercial Road dates from 1802, British History Online - 'Pennyfields', Survey of London: volumes 43 and 44: Poplar, Blackwall and Isle of Dogs (1994), pp. 111-113. Date accessed: 14 November 2007 while East India Dock Road was set out from 1806‚Äì1812.

Date accessed: 14 November 2007 The first iron bridge across the River Lea was built in 1810. Today the route is still largely single carriageway, though notable is the junction with the A12 and A102 at the northern portal of the Blackwall Tunnel. This section of A13 is used by the important London Bus routes 15 (as far as Blackwall) and 115. =East Ham & Barking By-pass (Newham Way and Alfreds Way)= Newham Way looking west between A406 and A117 junctions (the latter just ahead) However, just east of Blackwall, at the crossing of the River Lea, there is a TOTSO (turn-off to stay on) with the A1261 East India Dock Link Tunnel, and the road changes character dramatically, becoming a dual three-lane expressway. This grade-separated route continues all the way to the Greater London Boundary. Notable junctions include Canning Town, and the A406 junction near Beckton, as well as the single carriageway Lodge Avenue flyover near Barking, where the old A13 route (Ripple Road) merges with the new. Grade- separated in 2002‚Äì2004, the dual carriageway section through Newham is Newham Way, while through Barking it is Alfreds Way, both comprising the East Ham & Barking Bypass, and originally dualled by the 1960s. British History Online - 'West Ham: Introduction', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 6 (1973), pp. 43-50. Date accessed: 16 November 2007. This section is structurally sound and built to high standards, but was subject to a 40 mph (64 km/h) speed limit. Prior to grade-separation, the speed limit was 50 mph (80 km/h). This thread on the SABRE forums includes a letter from TfL setting out their reasons for reducing the limit from 50 to . Letter dated 5 January 2006. Works involved inserting new underpasses at Prince Regent and Movers Lane, a new flyover at Beckton Alps, and expanding Canning Town flyover from two lanes either way to three. Also inserted was the free-flow link to the A1261 tunnel. London Bus route 173 is the only route to use the A13 here, between Beckton Alps and Ripple Road. However, the speed limit was increased back to 50 mph in 2011. =Ripple Road and the Thames Gateway= East of the Lodge Avenue junction near Barking, the route then takes over the much older Ripple Road, with its last at-grade junction at Renwick Road, while the all-new grade- separated section east of the Goresbrook Interchange at Dagenham is termed the Thames Gateway, completed in 1999. This is notable for the award-winning viaduct Benaim Group webpage listing Concrete Society awards for 2000 over Fords works, opening in late 1999, Barking and Dagenham Local History website: Barking & Dagenham Post, 22 December 1999 and the causeway over Rainham and Wennington Marshes, the latter structure causing some delay to the project due to necessary studies on its environmental impact, Parliamentary debate on the A13 on 27 January 1995, first part Parliamentary debate on the A13 on 27 January 1995, second part although this section opened first, in mid-1997. Barking and Dagenham Local History website: Barking & Dagenham Post, 2 July 1997, The contract also included the Wennington to M25 motorway section (see below). It has National Speed Limit from just east of Goresbrook Interchange. London Bus routes 173 and 287 are the only routes to use the A13 here, between Ripple Road and Goresbrook. In 2005, Havering Council commissioned the Litmus Towers sculptures on the A13 junctions near Rainham which display local environmental data using large LED arrays.http://www.socalondon.com/litmus- towers/ Essex Sadlers Farm Roundabout =Wennington to Sadlers Hall Farm= The Thames Gateway section of the A13 leaves London at Wennington on the border with Thurrock, still dual three lanes, intersecting with the M25 motorway at Junction 30, close to the Dartford Crossing and Lakeside Shopping Centre. The A13 here is a much older dual carriageway, dating mostly to the 1980s, including the four-lane flyover above the M25, left incomplete for over 15 years. The Wennington to M25 section opened in late 1998. Barking and Dagenham Local History website: Barking & Dagenham Post, 16 December 1998. The next junction, the turn-off for Lakeside (A126), has only west-facing slips, so there is no exit westbound. It is then dual three lanes past the junction with the A1089, the road into Tilbury, and loses its Trunk Road status to the latter. The A13 finally drops down to two lanes each way at the nearby A128 junction. It is dual for another , bypassing Stanford-le-Hope and Basildon before it reaches the Sadlers Hall Farm (or Sadlers Farm) roundabout. Here the road meets the A130 and loses its dual and Primary Route status. The main route into Southend is now the A127 Southend Arterial Road, accessible via the A130. =A13/A130 Sadlers Farm Junction= Improvements to the A13/A130 Sadlers Farm Junction were first given government approval in July 2006 following a 2005 public consultation. The project involved by-passing the roundabout by creating a new full-depth cutting link road between the A13 and A130, building slip roads connecting traffic to the Sadlers Farm roundabout and widening the A13 to dual four lane carriageway to Pitsea and the A130 to dual three lane carriageway to the Rayleigh Spur roundabout. The scheme is part of the Thames Gateway transport infrastructure plans which gave it an estimated cost of ¬£63 million in 2007 and timelines it for 2012. The scheme was opened in 2012. =Benfleet to Shoeburyness= The A13 continues east of Sadlers Farm as mostly single-carriageway through Thundersley, Hadleigh, Leigh-on-Sea and Westcliff, before reaching the seaside resort of Southend-on- Sea. This is the last major town on the route, but it continues eastwards, including brief dual sections (London Road, Hadleigh, Queensway round the town centre, with its roundabouts with the A127 and A1160 (another TOTSO), and Southchurch Boulevard in Southchurch), and on to Shoeburyness, on the estuary east of Southend proper. It turns to the south at Parsons Corner, and then as Ness Road, it terminates at an end-on junction with the B1016, also forming part of Ness Road. History= Original route through Newham and Barking  East of the River Lea, through Newham and Barking, the original route followed the A124 Barking Road and then the A123 Ripple Road. The present A13 still uses much of the eastern end of Ripple Road. The route was replaced by the East Ham & Barking Bypass first opened in 1928, Barking and Dagenham Local History website: Dagenham Post & Barking Rainham Guardian, 1 June 1928 which was given the number A118 before being redesignated. As with the route west of the River Lea, Barking Road is a relatively new route, being built c.1812. British History Online - 'The ancient parish of Barking: introduction', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 5 (1966), pp. 184-190. Date accessed: 14 November 2007.  Original route through Dagenham and Havering  Ripple Road leads to Dagenham. The eastern end of this as well as New Road heading towards Rainham, in Havering, and the Greater London border, were bypassed by the new-build Thames Gateway in 1999. The former route was redesignated A1306. The western end between Dagenham and Rainham is still dual, but a short section near Rainham was singled in recent years. Like Barking Road further west, the original section of New Road between Dagenham and Rainham dates from c.1810, British History Online - 'Dagenham: Introduction and manors', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 5 (1966), pp. 267-281. Date accessed: 14 November 2007. and was dualled at roughly the same time as the East & Ham and Barking Bypass. New Road east of Rainham is much newer, and dates from the 1920s. It is and was single all the way towards the border at Wennington, consequently suffering congestion, especially after Lakeside shopping centre opened in 1990.  Original route in Thurrock and Basildon  The eastern half of New Road originates from 1924, British History Online - 'Wennington', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 7 (1978), pp. 180-190. Date accessed: 16 November 2007. and continues past Wennington as the A1306 Arterial Road, completed in 1925, British History Online - 'Parishes: Aveley', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 8 (1983), pp. 1-16. Date accessed: 16 November 2007 bypassing Purfleet (the project including that town's now unclassified \\"bypass\\"). It subsequently intersects with the M25 and A282 at Junction 31, heads past Lakeside and then ends at the A1012 near Grays. The route continues as the unclassified Lodge Lane before the latter becomes part of the A1013. The A1013 continues as far as Stanford-le-Hope, where the old A13 route merges with new at the A1014 junction. The eastern end of the erstwhile single- carriageway bypass is now a farm access, but can be shadowed on foot, meeting the B1420 at a roundabout just south of the modern A13 (the actual original A13 (pre-1930s) followed London Road and Southend Road through Stanford and Corringham Both original route (yellow) and old by-pass (red) can be seen in this New Popular Edition Map dated 1946). East of there, the B1420 meets the A13 at the A176 junction at Thurrock/Essex border and then the B1464 London Road continues the route south of Basildon, before meeting the newer road and the A130 at Sadlers Farm. The section of the route between the M25 and Sadlers Farm was by-passed or dualled in several stages between the mid-1970s and early 1990s, This thread on the SABRE website forums discusses opening dates for roads built in the 1970s, based on contemporary maps (The Atlas Dating Project). The A13 between the A176 and A130 was deemed to have been built some time between 1975 and 1978; no firm date, however, was arrived at. This thread on the SABRE website forums discusses opening dates for roads built in the 1980s, based on contemporary maps (The Atlas Dating Project). The A13 between the M25 and A128 was deemed to have opened in 1982, and the section between A128 and A1014 in 1985. This thread on the SABRE website forums discusses opening dates for roads built in the 1990s, based on contemporary maps (The Atlas Dating Project). The A13 between the A1014 and A176 was deemed to have been complete in 1993, largely taking over the old Stanford-le-Hope Bypass. with Wennington to M25 opening in 1998 (see above).  Original route in Southend  In Southend, the short dual carriageway Queensway bypasses the original route through the town centre, and while much of this is pedestrianised, it can be followed on foot. East of the town centre, Shoebury Road was bypassed by the single-carriageway Bournes Green Chase, just a few yards to the north, linking Southchurch with Shoeburyness. Finally, the terminus of the A13 has been truncated, the road formerly ending on Shoeburyness High Street at the railway station.  Proposed route near Southend  In the 1960s, a route along the lines of the A13 was planned to take traffic to a new airport located at Maplin Sands near Southend. Only preliminary planning was carried out for the road (which may be have been designated a motorway) before the proposals for the airport were dropped in favour of expanding Stansted Airport). The route would have followed a similar route to the current A13 through Barking and Dagenham to Rainham before heading north-east towards South Ockendon then east towards Basildon. It would have continued eastwards between Basildon and Stanford-le-Hope before passing north of Canvey Island and south of Hadleigh, Leigh-on-Sea. The last section of road would have been constructed in the Thames Estuary passing south of Southend-on-Sea and Shoeburyness to reach the proposed site of the airport. Management The section between Limehouse and Wennington is maintained by RMS (A13) Plc as part of a 30-year DBFO deal reached with the Highways Agency in 2000. AMEC (parent co. of RMS) press release, 11 April 2000. Highways Agency DBFO Project List It was RMS who undertook grade-separation of the East Ham & Barking Bypass section in 2002‚Äì2004. RMS also maintain the A1203 Limehouse Link tunnel as well as the Aspen Way and East India Dock Link tunnel sections of the A1261 through Docklands. This latter route runs just south of the A13, is dual carriageway and nearly all grade-separated and acts as an alternative to East India Dock Road and much of Commercial Road. Despite the DBFO, Transport for London (who took over responsibility for all trunk non- motorway routes in London from the Highways Agency in 2000 BBC News Online article: \\"In Depth - London Mayor - What does the Mayor get to do?\\", 16 May 2000.) still have overall responsibility for the entire A13 section inside Greater London, while the Highways Agency have responsibility for the remaining Trunk Road section between Wennington and the A1089 junction near Tilbury. From there until Sadlers Hall Farm, the A13 is a primary route and is maintained by Essex County Council, as is the non-primary section through Castle Point, although the sections through Southend-on-Sea and Thurrock are managed by their respective unitary authorities. Cycle Superhighway 3 Cycle Superhighway 3 (CS3) runs along the A13 between Poplar and Barking. To the east CS3 joins the A13 at the junction with the A1020/Leamouth Road. CS3 runs eastbound, crossing the Bow Creek and Barking Creek and passing through Canning Town and Beckton en route. To the west, CS3 ends at Greatfields Park, Barking, at the junction with Movers Lane/River Road. West from Canning Town, CS3 crosses over the A1020/Leamouth Road, heading southbound along the pavement until a junction with Sorrel Lane, where it turns right. It is signposted from Sorrel Lane and runs unbroken to Tower Hill in the City and Lancaster Gate, Hyde Park. For the entirety of its route, CS3 runs adjacent to the westbound carriageway of the A13 (to the south of the road) as a two-way bike freeway. The route is segregated from other traffic, except at some junctions. It is signposted and marked by blue paint. Between Greatfields Park and the Lodge Avenue Junction, the two-way, segregated bike freeway continues along the southern edge of the A13. The route is part of National Cycle Route 13 (NCR 13), but not the TfL Cycleways network. NCR 13 leaves the A13 to the east of Lodge Avenue Junction, crossing the A13 and joining residential streets as it runs towards Rainham. The northern terminus of NCR 13 is in Fakenham, Norfolk. Future developments= A13 Passenger Transport Corridor (Southend)  The scheme aims to improve public transport along the A13; it includes bus stop improvements, provision of real time information and bus prioritisation at signals as well as junction enhancements and road widening. The road widening is planned for a number of points on the Hatley Gardens and Kenneth Road stretch of the A13. Following a public consultation in March 2009, the scheme was approved. \\"The people of Thurrock have been calling for this for more than a decade, now at last the money is in sight and we can start to get things moving.\\" The original estimated cost of the scheme was given at ¬£4 million in the 2001-2006 Local Transport Plan and increased to ¬£4.9 million in the 2006-2011 update. \\"The government is recognising that a further ¬£80 million more is needed to actually build the scheme.\\" London Grade-separation of Renwick Road traffic lights in Barking, the final at-grade junction between Canning Town and Sadlers Hall Farm, was due to be undertaken \\"in time for the Olympics in 2012\\". This thread on the SABRE website forums includes a letter from Barking & Dagenham Council outlining plans for the Renwick Road junction, dated 22 November 2005. The works may also involve replacement of the nearby Lodge Avenue Flyover (Ripple Road Flyover), but this is subject to available funding and development of Barking Riverside. Transport for London planning decisions: Barking Riverside, London Borough of Barking and Dagenham planning application no. 04/01230/OUT, planning report PDU/0150/02, dated 28 March 2007. The junction with the A406 North Circular Road was built in 1987 Barking and Dagenham Local History website: Ilford & Barking Independent, 17 December 1987 and is incomplete. The long-awaited Thames Gateway Bridge is yet to get the go ahead, TfL Thames Gateway Bridge webpage but if built it will start at a flyover above the A13, thereby linking the A406 with the road network south of the River Thames. As of 2008, the project in its original form was cancelled by newly elected mayor Boris Johnson. Transport Briefing (9 November 2008) - \\"Mayor culls projects\\" M25 Junction 30 Improvements including widening are being made at J30 of the M25 motorway and at nearby Lakeside turn-off (A126), following a Route Management Strategy undertaken by the Highways Agency. Highways Agency A13 Route Management webpage The work commenced in late 2014 and was scheduled to be completed in autumn 2016. A13 in popular culture The A13 has inspired at least two rock songs: Billy Bragg's \\"A13, Trunk Road to the sea\\", which is a localisation of Bobby Troup's song about Route 66;A13 Trunk Road to the Sea The music video for the Underworld song \\"Scribble\\" also features the A13, with the distinctive fencing on the side of the road clearly visible during the video. There is also the spoken word track called 'A13' featured on the album Without Judgement by Jah Wobble's Invaders of the Heart, in which Wobble intones his deeper, satirical thoughts concerning the \\"hopeless highway of Essex\\" over the musical backing of the band. In 2004, British author Iain Sinclair published a psychogeographic road novel, titled Dining on Stones, which loosely follows the route of the A13 from East London to the Thames Estuary. Mike Newman published an account of attempting to walk the route of the A13 in \\"Adverse Camber: An Incomplete walk to the seaside\\" in 2018.

Radial, it carries traffic from London to the Eastbourne area of the East Sussex coast, in which town it ends. For part of its route the A22 utilises the turnpikes opened in the 18th century: * 1718: London to East Grinstead section opened as a turnpike * 1720: above road extended through East Grinstead to Highgate, Forest Row, the entrance to Ashdown Forest By 1820 the road ran for 34 miles (54 km) from Stones End Street, Borough, London to Wych Cross. The road was extended north to Westminster Bridge which was later renamed the A23. Route The A22 diverges from the A23 south of London at Purley Cross Junction (south of Purley). It runs over the North Downs into Surrey, crossing the M25 London Orbital Motorway just north of Godstone. This section incorporates the Caterham bypass, which opened in 1939 as one of the earliest such roads in the country, including the Wapses Lodge roundabout at the northern end. It then travels along the route of an ancient Roman road. To the south of the M25, the road briefly enters West Sussex at Felbridge, just to the north of East Grinstead, and the A264 between Crawley and Tunbridge Wells merges with the A22 for a short section. The A22 bypasses East Grinstead town centre, running along a disused railway cutting, part of a line which closed as a consequence of the Beeching Report, which cut large numbers of local rail services. Richard Beeching was a local resident, and as a result, some local residents wanted to call this section the \\"Beeching Cut\\".http://www.bbc.co.uk/wear/content/articles/2008/10/24/wear_beeching_feature.shtml Beeching Cut To the south of East Grinstead the A22 crosses into East Sussex, just north of Forest Row. Between Forest Row and Nutley the road crosses the ancient Ashdown Forest. The A22 is the only road through the forest not subject to 40mph speed limits. The A275 branches south to Lewes at the Wych Cross junction. Both the A272 and the A26 cross the A22 between Nutley and Uckfield. The A26 merges with the A22 for the section round Uckfield. There are bypasses of East Hoathly and Hailsham. There is a junction with the A27, to the north of the end of the A22, in Eastbourne.

It runs from its junction with the A36 at Whiteparish (near Salisbury) in the county of Wiltshire. It closely parallels the south coast in Hampshire, then passes through West Sussex and terminates at Pevensey (near Eastbourne and Bexhill) in East Sussex. It is the westernmost road in Zone 2 in the UK road numbering system. Between Portsmouth and Lewes, it is one of the busiest trunk roads in the UK. History Historically, for longer distance movement along the south coast, the M25 in combination with the M2, M20, M23 / A23, A3 / A3(M) and M3 has provided an attractive alternative to the actual south coast route of A259, A27 and M27. In 2002 an offpeak journey between Margate and Southampton via the M25 took 2 hours 30 minutes, and via the coastal route using the A259, A27 and M27 took 3 hours 50 minutes. The reason why the coastal route is so much slower than the M25 alternative is largely due to a series of bottlenecks on the A27. These include Chichester, Arundel, Worthing and Polegate. The British government announced, in its 2013 spending review, that it would go ahead with improvements to the Chichester bypass. The Highways Agency said that the proposals would be subject to public consultation in July 2015. The preferred route would then be announced in September 2015 and the plan would be to start construction in February 2018 with a completion date of December 2019. However the timescales were then revised. There was a six-week public consultation period during Spring 2016. The proposed construction would then commence in March 2019 with a completion date of March 2021. After five options were published and two dropped the government cancelled the whole project on 28 February 2017, citing lack of support from local authorities as the main reason. Chichester Bypass is scheduled to included in \\"RP3\\" which means it is planned to be constructed between 2025 & 2030, consultation should begin after 2023. A proposed scheme to bypass Lancing and Sompting (as well as other sections) was dropped in 1988. A proposed scheme to bypass Arundel was dropped in 2003, although the junction at the end of the dual carriageway has been partly made into an underpass. However, the scheme was relaunched in Spring 2018 when Highways England announced their preferred route, choosing a \\"a modified version of Option 5A\\". Although the document claims 48% of respondents support this option, there are worries that the new road may damage ancient woodland in the South Downs National Park. With lots of protests about the western end destroying an ancient woodland, Highways England did further consultation in October 2019 and in October 2020 announced a new preferred route that is 8.8km long an avoids the South Downs National Park & ancient woodland entirely. It is due to be put before the planning inspectorate in Summer 2021, if successful construction will begin in Spring 2022 & be open in 2026. At Worthing, where the possibility of a bypass has often been discussed since 1967, even getting as far as passing the inspector's report at a public inquiry, the plan was dropped in 1996 following rising costs. Arundel and Worthing are both areas of known traffic congestion during times of peak usage. A bridge over the level crossing at Beddingham was completed on 22 August 2008. The original proposal called for a dual carriageway standard link with a bridge over the crossing. However, the actual project involved improving the original single carriageway road by providing two lanes westbound and one lane eastbound between the Southerham and Beddingham roundabouts. More works are taking place in 2019-2021 between Beddingham and Polegate to improve the safety at junctions and provide a off- carriageway cycle track for the entire length. Lewes-Polegate has been included in RP3 (construction between 2025 & 2030) for a new offline limited access route. Despite the limited improvements to the A27, it is still substantially quicker (usually more than an hour difference) to travel from Southampton to Margate via the M25 route compared to the coast route of A259, A27 and M27. Because of all the delays along its route, according to West Sussex County Council, the A27 is the most unreliable all purpose trunk road in England. Further, it is widely considered by businesses on the coast to cost money and inhibit economic performance due to its unreliability and frequent congestion. Highways England commissioned a report by \\"Transport Focus\\" to undertake road user priorities. The South Central route, that is largely the A27, was one of the lower rated routes with 50% of users experiencing problems. Out of a list of strategic routes across the whole of England only two were rated worse than the South Central route: the M25 to Solent route (61%) and the London Orbital and M23 to Gatwick (58%). Further Highways England identified the A27 between Lancing and the A24; between Arundel and the A284; between the A23 and Polegate; also around Chichester as being some of worst performing links in the country for safety issues. One accident victim was Actor Desmond Llewelyn, who portrayed Q in a large portion of the James Bond film series and was fatally injured in a car accident on the A27 in 1999, at Firle, on the A23 to Polegate section. There are several sections of the A27 that fall inside the Highways Agency nationwide top 250 collision rankings: * A27 between Shoreham-by-Sea and Southwick ‚Äì ranking 123 * A27/A23 junction Brighton ‚Äì ranking 158 * A27 near the junction with the A2025 near Lancing ‚Äì ranking 158 * A27 Chichester By-Pass east of the city ‚Äì ranking 202 Shoreham Airshow crash At the Shoreham Airshow on 22 August 2015, a Hawker Hunter crashed into the A27, striking several vehicles and killing eleven people. The road was completely closed for eight days and did not fully reopen until 16 September 2015. Description A27 near Brighton and Hove, East Sussex The road starts at its junction with the A36 at Whiteparish. It runs through Romsey, Chilworth, at which point it follows a Roman Road, Swaythling, West End and Bursledon. It then closely parallels the south coast and travels on via Fareham, Cosham, Havant, Chichester, Arundel, Worthing, Lancing, Shoreham-by-Sea, Hove, Brighton, Falmer, Lewes and Polegate where it then terminates at Pevensey in East Sussex. A section of the A27 running from the eastern end of the M27 to the end of the road at Pevensey forms part of, what was known as, the South Coast Trunk Road. Much of the road has been improved to dual carriageway standard, with the westernmost section of the trunk portion even having as much as four lanes plus a hard shoulder in each direction, and on a motorway alignment with grade-separated junctions. This is perhaps a reflection that the M27 was once proposed to run as far as Chichester. The road runs east from Portsmouth to Havant then on to the Warblington/ Emsworth exit. Beyond Warblington the dual carriageway east has no junctions in it until it reaches Chichester, where the by-pass has five roundabouts and one traffic signal controlled junction, that disrupt the mainline flow of the road.Google map of Chichester retrieved 3 March 2012 The Chichester by-pass is regularly subject to congestion and although a public inquiry has proposed improvements, those improvements are currently on hold. East of Chichester the road largely retains a two-lane dual-carriageway standard. There are, however a couple of sections of single-carriageway; at Arundel and at Worthing. These are both areas of known traffic congestion during times of peak usage. At the junction of the A27 and the A24, the A27 has a brief section where the road is designated 'A27' and 'A24' before continuing from the 'Grove Lodge' roundabout where the road is named \\"Upper Brighton Road\\". After Worthing, the A27 passes Sompting on the Sompting Bypass before passing through Lancing where there are traffic lights and a roundabout which disrupt traffic flow. Just before the road crosses the River Adur near Shoreham via the 'Shoreham flyover' (constructed 1968-70), there is a traffic light-controlled intersection close to Lancing College and the headquarters of Ricardo plc which was the scene of a fatal aircrash during the Shoreham Airshow 2015 on 22 August 2015, killing eleven people on the ground. After the 'flyover' over the Adur, the A27 then runs past the Holmbush interchange (Shoreham-by-Sea) and on through the Southwick Hill Tunnel, at that point entering the City of Brighton and Hove, traditionally (though no longer administratively) part of East Sussex. Later, it passes Brighton ‚Äî where it is known as the Brighton Bypass By-pass: First proposed in 1932, My Brighton and Hove, Tim Carder, 1990 ‚Äî and around the South Downs. The junction of the A23 and the A27 is often slow in the morning rush hour. It then passes around Falmer with this section of road having three lanes in each direction but loses the third lane later. When Brighton and Hove Albion play at home this section can become congested due to its proximity to Falmer Stadium. The road passes into East Sussex proper just to the west of the Falmer junction. Afterwards, it passes south of Lewes where it meets the A26 road to Newhaven. Here, the road becomes a single carriageway standard and formerly crossed a level crossing until it was bypassed by a bridge which opened in 2008. The South Coast Multi-Modal Study (SoCoMMS) recommended a dual carriageway, but the Highways Agency built it to a cheaper single-carriageway standard. Plans are still proposed for upgrading this later. The road afterwards reverts to a dual carriageway with access to the A22, which provides links to Eastbourne and Hailsham. The road then once again becomes a single carriageway near Pevensey, where the road ends, and the South Coast Trunk Road transfers over to the A259; this coast road starts in Emsworth and shadows the route of the A27. Bexhill to Hastings link road Work on the contentious Bexhill to Hastings link road commenced in early 2013 and was completed in late 2015. The road provides a more direct link from the A27 to the A28 road via the A259 road.

It is about in diameter with a central lake-filled caldera about in size, formed during the Novarupta eruption of 1912. The caldera rim reaches a maximum elevation of . In 1975 the surface of the crater lake was at an elevation of about , and the estimated elevation of the caldera floor is about . The mountain is located in Kodiak Island Borough, very close to its border with Lake and Peninsula Borough. Geology Map showing volcanoes of Alaska Peninsula. Katmai caldera before and after surveys of 1908 and 1951 Mount Katmai is one of five vents encircling the Novarupta volcano, source of the VEI 6 eruption and associated voluminous pyroclastic flows in 1912. The volcano has caused ten known fatalities due to gas exposure. Katmai consists chiefly of lava flows, pyroclastic rocks, and non-welded to agglutinated air fall. The Quaternary volcanic rocks at Katmai and adjacent cones are less than thick. Much of the volcano is mantled by snow and ice and several valley glaciers radiate out from the flanks. Katmai volcano is built on the sedimentary rocks of the Naknek Formation of Late Jurassic age, which are exposed just west of the caldera rim at an elevation of about , as well as north and southeast of the crater. Sedimentary rocks have been reported at an elevation of over in the west wall of the caldera and near the bottom of the eastern wall near . Volcanic activity Little is known about the historical activity of Katmai volcano before the great 1912 eruption. Early U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey maps suggest a pre-caldera summit elevation of about , and local villagers reported in 1898 that one of the volcanoes in the general area \\"smoked\\" occasionally. During June 6 to 9, 1912, the most spectacular Alaskan eruption in recorded history and the twentieth century's largest measured volcanic eruption formed a large summit caldera at Katmai volcano. The eruption happened at a vent about to the west of Mount Katmai (at the Novarupta Volcano). During over 60 hours, the volcano erupted an estimated of ash flows and tephra representing of magma volume. The eruption produced a cloud of suffocating gas and ash that blackened the sky for the inhabitants of the town of Kodiak, who, with ash falling on them were led to the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Manning where they sheltered in the harbor and were cared for by the crew because Captain Perry determined \\"an attempt to leave here would be unwise\\" due to the volcanic conditions degrading navigation capabilities.\\"Sons of the Hurricane\\" by John J. Floherty copyright 1938 Reprinted January 1942 The withdrawal of magma beneath Katmai resulted in the collapse of the summit area, forming the caldera. Following the subsidence, a small dacitic lava dome known as Horseshoe Island was emplaced on the floor of the caldera; this is the only juvenile material erupted from Katmai caldera during the historical eruption. It was visible at the time of the expedition in 1916, but has since been submerged by the crater lake. Still, the eruption from Katmai had a VEI of 3, and possibly involved phreatic eruptions. In 1919, geologists noted a lake covering a large part of the caldera floor, but by 1923 the lake was gone and numerous fumaroles, mud pots, and a large mud geyser had replaced it. The lake has since refilled to a depth of over . Small glaciers have also formed on a bench within the caldera beside the lake. Pumice still floats on Naknek Lake nearby.Noted by John Harte, The Green Fuse: an ecological odyssey, University of California Press, 1993, p. 23 See also * List of volcanoes in the United States ReferencesOther sources * * Alaska Volcano Observatory: Katmai * Further reading * Erskine, Wilson Fiske.

Biography The Pusk√°s family from Ditr√≥Magyar nyelv, Volumes 38-39, Magyar Nyelvtudom√°nyi T√°rsas√°g, Akad√©miai Kiad√≥, 1942, p. 361 (today Harghita County of Romania), was part of the Transylvanian Hungarian nobility. Pusk√°s studied law and later engineering sciences. After living in England and working for the Warnin Railway Construction Company he returned to Hungary. In 1873, on the occasion of the World Exhibition in Vienna, he founded the Pusk√°s Travel Agency, the fourth- oldest in the world and the first travel agency in Central Europe. After this, Pusk√°s moved to Colorado and became a gold miner. It was while he was in America that Pusk√°s exposed the American \\"energy machine\\" inventor Keely as a fraud. Pusk√°s was working on his idea for a telegraph exchange when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone. This led him to take a fresh look at his work and he decided to get in touch with the American inventor Thomas Edison. Pusk√°s now began to concentrate on perfecting his scheme to build a telephone exchange. According to Edison, \\"Tivadar Puskas was the first person to suggest the idea of a telephone exchange\\". The first experimental telephone exchange was based on the ideas of Pusk√°s, and it was built by the Bell Telephone Company in Boston in 1877.Frank Lewis Dyer: Edison His Life And Inventions. (page: 71) In 1879 Pusk√°s set up a telephone exchange in Paris, where he looked after Thomas Edison's European affairs for the next four years. In Paris he was greatly helped by his younger brother Ferenc Pusk√°s (1848‚Äì1884), who later established the first telephone exchange in Pest. In 1887 he introduced the multiplex switchboard, which was a revolutionary step in the development of telephone exchanges.Francis S. Wagner: Hungarian Contributions to World Civilization - Page 68 His next invention was the \\"Telephone News Service\\" that he introduced in Pest, which announced news and \\"broadcast\\" programmes and was in many ways the forerunner of the radio. According to a contemporary scientific journal, at most 50 people could listen to Edison's telephone at the same time, if one more person was connected, none of the subscribers could hear anything. With Pusk√°s's apparatus, by contrast, half a million people could clearly hear the programme coming from the exchange. In 1890, Pusk√°s was granted a patent for a procedure for carrying out controlled explosions, which was the forerunner of modern techniques. He experimented with this technology when he was working on regulating the Lower Danube. Pusk√°s registered the patent of technology behind the telephone newspaper Telefon H√≠rmond√≥ in 1892, in the Patent Office of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with the title \\"A new method of organizing and fitting a telephone newspaper\\". The Telefon H√≠rmond√≥ service started on 15 February 1893, with around 60 subscribers. After Pusk√°s's death on 16 March 1893, his brother Albert Pusk√°s sold the enterprise and the patent rights to Istv√°n Popper. Tivadar Pusk√°s did not win extensive public recognition during his lifetime. However, in 2008, the Hungarian National Bank issued a 1000 Forint commemorative coin in honor of Pusk√°s and the 115th anniversary of the introduction of the Telefon H√≠rmond√≥.

BMW's own motorcycles‚Äîsold under the BMW Motorrad brand‚Äîbegan in 1923 with the BMW R 32, which was powered by a flat-twin engine (also called a \\"boxer-twin\\" engine). Production of motorcycles with flat-twin engines continues to this day, however BMW has also produced many models with other types of engines. Motorcycle history=1921‚Äì1938 At the end of World War I, the Treaty of Versailles demanded that BMW cease production of aircraft engines. To remain in business, the company began producing small industrial engines (along with farm equipment, household items and railway brakes). In 1920, BMW M2B15 flat-twin petrol engine was released. Despite being designed as a portable industrial engine, the M2B15 was also used by several motorcycle manufacturers, including for the 1920‚Äì1923 Victoria KR1 and the 1920‚Äì1922 Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFw) Helios motorcycles. BMW merged with Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, and the BFw Helios became the starting point for the first BMW motorcycle. Released in 1923, the BMW R 32 used a flat-twin petrol engine, which was longitudinally-mounted to eliminate the cooling problems of the transversely mounted engine in the Helios. This engine with , resulting in a top speed of . At a time when many motorcycle manufacturers used total-loss oiling systems, the new BMW engine featured a recirculating wet sump oiling system with a drip feed to roller bearings; a design which BMW used until 1969. The R 32 also started the tradition of shaft drive, which was used on all BMW motorcycles until 1994. The BMW R 37, produced from 1925 to 1926, was BMW's first sporting model. It was based on the R 32 and used an overhead valve engine producing . The first single-cylinder BMW motorcycle was the 1925 BMW R 39, which was BMW's smallest model and used a engine. It was not successful and was discontinued in 1927. The next single-cylinder motorcycle was the BMW R 2, which was released in 1931. It used a engine and could therefore be ridden in Germany without a motorcycle licence at that time. The lineage of single-cylinder motorcycles continued with the BMW R 4 in 1932 and the BMW R 3 in 1936. The BMW R 12 and BMW R 17, both introduced in 1935, were the first production motorcycles with hydraulically damped telescopic forks. In 1937, Ernst Henne recorded a top speed of on a BMW 500 Kompressor racing motorcycle, setting a world record that stood for 14 years. The BMW R 71 big flat-twin motorcycle was exceptional. It was the Icon of BMW, expensive to build and well engineered. Unfortunately only 2638 motorcycles could be built before production was disrupted due to the War. Original bikes are now rare and highly sought after. Around 500 are known to survive today. It was licensed to the Soviet Union in 1938, resulting in the Dnepr M-72 which was produced from 1942 to 1960. File: BMW R39.jpg BMW R 39 (1925‚Äì1927) File:BMW motorbike R 12 (aka).jpg BMW R 12 (1935‚Äì1942)  1939‚Äì1945  During World War II, the German military needed as many vehicles as it could get of all types and many other German companies were asked to build motorcycles. The BMW R 75 performed particularly well in the harsh operating environment of North Africa, partly due to the protruding cylinders of the flat-twin engine providing more effective cooling than other configurations which overheated in the sun. Shaft drives also performed better than chain-drives which were damaged by desert grit. The R 75 inspired similar models from U.S. manufacturers, such as the Indian 841 and Harley-Davidson XA. 1945‚Äì1955 In Soviet-controlled East Germany, BMW's sole motorcycle plant in Eisenach recommenced production of R35 and R75 motorcycles soon after the war, for reparations. The factory continued to use the BMW name, causing two separate companies (one in Eisenach and the other in Munich, West Germany) to be using the BMW name between 1948 and 1952. The head office of BMW, based in Munich, had no control over the operations in East Germany. Eventually in 1952, after the Soviets ceded control of the plant to the East German Government, and following a trademark lawsuit, the East German company was renamed Eisenacher Motorenwerk (EMW). Instead of BMW's blue-and-white roundel, EMW used a very similar red-and-white roundel as its logo. In West Germany, many of BMWs facilities had been badly damaged during the war, including the Munich factory which was in ruins. Initially, the terms of Germany's surrender forbade BMW from manufacturing motorcycles. In 1947, when BMW received permission to restart motorcycle production from US authorities in Bavaria, BMW had to start from scratch. There were no plans, blueprints, or schematic drawings because they were all in Eisenach. The first post-war BMW motorcycle in Western Germany, was the 1948 BMW R 24. The R 24 was reverse-engineered from the pre- war BMW R 23 motorcycle with several improvementsGantriis, Peter, The Art of BMW: 90 Years of Motorcycling Excellence, p.98 and powered by a single- cylinder engine. It was the only postwar West German model without rear suspension. In 1949, BMW produced 9,200 units and by 1950 production surpassed 17,000 units. Production of flat-twin models resumed in 1950 with the R 51/2 model, which was followed by the BMW R 51/3 and BMW R 67 twins in 1951, and the sporting BMW R 68 in 1952. Except for the R 68, all flat-twin models came with \\"bell-bottom\\" front fenders and front stands. File:R51 Tank-badge 1.jpg BMW emblem on a BMW R 51 (1938‚Äì1940) 1955‚Äì1969 Motorcycle sales in Europe plummeted as the 1950s progressed, with three of BMW's major German competitors going out of business in 1967. In 1954, BMW produced 30,000 motorcycles. By 1957, that number was less than 5,500. In 1955, BMW began introducing a new range of motorcycles with Earles forks and enclosed drive shafts. These were the BMW R 50, the BMW R 60 and the sporting model BMW R 69 with . On June 8, 1959, John Penton rode a BMW R 69 from New York to Los Angeles in 53 hours and 11 minutes, slashing over 24 hours from the previous record. By the late 1950s, the overall BMW company was in financial trouble. The company narrowly avoided a merger with Daimler-Benz through the combination of financing from brothers Herbert Quandt and Harald Quandt, increased success of the automobile division and the selling off its aircraft engine division. Changes in the motorcycle market saw BMW's last shaft-driven single-cylinder model, the BMW R 27, end production in 1967. Also, most of BMW's offerings were still designed to be used with sidecars. However, by the late 1960s, sidecars were no longer a consideration of most riders; people were interested in sportier motorcycles instead. The BMW R 50/2, R 60/2, and R 69 S were the last sidecar-capable BMWs, with the latter being the most powerful and desirable model. In the United States, sales of motorcycles were strong through the 1950s, in contrast to drastically declining sales in Europe. Later, specific \\"US\\" models were sold in the United States for the 1968 and 1969 model years: the BMW R 50 US, R 60 US and the R 69 US. These models were sold with telescopic forks (alongside other BMW models which were sold with Earles forks) and without sidecar lugs. File:Granada_red_1967_BMW_R60-2.jpeg BMW R 60/2 (1960‚Äì1969) File:2007-07-22 BMW R 69 S, Bj. 1966 (kl).jpg BMW R 69 S (1960‚Äì1969)  1969‚Äì1982  The model range was entirely revamped in 1969 with the introduction of the BMW /5 range, consisting of the 500 cc BMW R 50/5, the 600 cc BMW R 60/5 and the 750 cc BMW R 75/5 models. The engines were a complete redesign, with the crankshaft bearings upgraded from roller bearings to shell-type journal bearings (the type used in modern car engines). The camshaft was now chain- driven and located underneath the crankshaft instead of at the top of the engine, in order to lower the centre of gravity. An electric starter was available for the first time, although the traditional gearbox-mounted kick starter was also retained. The styling of the first models included chrome- plated side panels and a restyled tank. In 1973, the rear swingarm was lengthened, which improved the handling and allowed a larger battery to be installed. The introduction of the \\"/5\\" models coincided with production relocating from Munich to a new factory in Spandau, West Berlin. at a site earlier occupied by a Siemens aircraft engine factory.Gantriis, Peter, The Art of BMW: 90 Years of Motorcycling Excellence, p.120 The BMW /6 range replaced the \\"/5\\" models in 1974, with the engine being discontinued and a engine introduced. The \\"/6\\" model range consisted of the 600 cc BMW R 60/6, the 750 cc BMW R 75/6, the 900 cc BMW R 90/6 and the sporting 900 cc BMW R 90 S. Other upgrades included a five-speed gearbox, brakes and the electrical system. In 1975, the kick starter was finally eliminated.Walker, Mick, How To Restore Your BMW Twin: 1955‚Äì1985, pp. 20‚Äì22 In 1976, the BMW /7 range replaced the \\"/6\\" models. The 800 cc BMW R 80/7 model was introduced, and the 900 cc BMW R 90/6 and BMW R 90S models were replaced the 1,000 cc BMW R 100/7, BMW R 100S and BMW R 100RS models. The latter was a full-fairing design which produced and had a top speed of . Later variants of the 1,000 cc models included the BMW R 100T (\\"Touring\\"), the BMW R 100 RT and BMW R 100CS (\\"Classic Sport\\"). The 1978 BMW R 45 and BMW R 65 were entry-level 450 cc and 650 cc models that replaced the BMW R 60/7. Later variants of the BMW R 65 included the 1982 BMW R65 LS, the sporting BMW R 65 S and the 1987 dual-sport BMW R 65 GS.  1983‚Äì1992  The BMW K 100, introduced in 1983, marked a departure from BMW's tradition of air-cooled flat-twin engines. It was powered by a water-cooled inline-four engine with a displacement of , which was also BMW's first fuel- injected motorcycle engine. The frame was tubular steel and the rear suspension was a single-sided swingarm. In 1985, the BMW K 75 was added as the entry-level model. The K 75 was powered by a 750 cc inline-three engine, which was BMW's first engine to use a counterbalance shaft. In 1988, the K 100 became the first motorcycle to have anti-lock brakes (ABS) and in 1989 the K 100 RS 4V model became the first BMW motorcycle to use an engine with four valves per cylinder. The 1988 BMW K 1 sports tourer was BMW's first full- fairing sport bike. It had an aerodynamic body which was designed to minimise drag at high speeds. Production of flat-twin touring models continued with the BMW R 100 and BMW R 80 model ranges. File:BMW_K1_blue_1993_r_TCE.jpg BMW K 1 (1988‚Äì1993)  1993‚Äì2003  Beginning with the BMW R 1100 RS sports tourer in 1993, BMW began to transition from engines with air-cooled cylinder heads (\\"airhead\\" engines) to oil-cooled cylinder heads (\\"oilhead\\" engines). The BMW R 100 RS also used \\"Telelever\\" front suspension (where braking forces are transferred horizontally to minimize \\"fork dive\\") and a stressed engine. Also introduced in 1993 were the single-cylinder BMW F 650 models, which was based on the Aprilia Pegaso 650. The related BMW F650 CS began production in 2001. The \\"airhead\\" BMW R 80 GS and R 100 GS models remained in production until 1997, before being replaced by the newer \\"oilhead\\" models such as the BMW R 850 series, the 1994‚Äì1999 BMW R 1100 R standard motorcycle, the 1994‚Äì1999 BMW R 1100 GS dual-sport, the 1996‚Äì2001 BMW R 1100 RT tourer, the 1998‚Äì2005 BMW R 1100 S sports, and the 1999‚Äì2004 BMW R1150 GS dual-sport. The K Series models, powered by a water-cooled inline-four engine, included the 1996‚Äì2004 BMW K 1200 RS sports tourer, the 1998‚Äì2009 BMW K 1200 LT luxury tourer, and the 2002‚Äì2005 BMW K 1200 GT sports tourer. The BMW R 1200 C, produced from 1997 to 2004, was BMW Motorcycle's only entry into the cruiser market. At the other end of the model lineup, the 2000‚Äì2002 BMW C1 was BMW's first and only enclosed scooter model.  2004‚Äì2014  The revised K Series range of water- cooled inline-four cylinder models began in 2004 with the BMW K 1200 S a sport-tourer. The K1200S was primarily designed as a Super Sport motorcycle, albeit larger and heavier than the closest Japanese competitors. Other additions to the K Series range were the 2005 BMW K 1200 R naked bike and related 2007 BMW K 1200 R Sport semi-faired sport-tourer,K1200R Sport and the 2006 BMW K 1200 GT sport-tourer. The engine capacity of the K Series was expanded to for the 2008 BMW K 1300 S sport-tourer, the 2009 BMW K 1300 GT sport-tourer and the 2009 BMW K 1300 R naked bike. In 2011, two six-cylinder models were added to the K Series range- the BMW K 1600 GT and BMW K 1600 GTL, the former intended as a sport-tourer and the latter as a luxury-tourer. The R Series range of flat-twin models was also updated in 2004, beginning with the BMW R 1200 GS dual-sport, which was powered by a new \\"oilhead\\" engine. This was followed by the 2005 BMW R 1200 ST sport-tourer, the 2005 BMW R 1200 RT tourer, the 2006 BMW R 1200 S sport-tourer, and the 2006 BMW R 1200 R naked bike. In 2014, the redesigned BMW R1200 RT used a water-cooled engine and a wet clutch. The BMW HP2 Enduro dirt bike was introduced in 2005, based on the BMW R 1200 GS. In 2007, the HP2 Enduro was joined by the road-biased HP2 Megamoto fitted with smaller alloy wheels and street tyres. As part of the F Series range update in 2006, the BMW F 800 S sports bike and BMW F 800 ST sport-touring models were introduced, both powered by a Rotax parallel-twin engine. The BMW F 650 GS and BMW F800 GS dual-sport bikes were added to the range in 2008, both using the same 798 cc engine, despite the different names and the F 700 GS replaced the 650 in 2012. In 2009, the BMW F 800 R naked bike was introduced and in 2013 the BMW F 800 GT replaced the BMW F 800 ST sport- touring. In 2009, the BMW G 650 GS replaced the BMW F 650 GS.

Trident Volcano is an eroded volcanic complex on the Alaska Peninsula in Katmai National Park, Alaska. Up to 23 domes comprise the complex stratovolcano, with the greatest elevation of . The most recent major activity produced a dome in an amphitheater on the southwest flank of the southwest peak. According to the United States Geological Survey, the descriptive name, Trident, was given by Robert Fiske Griggs of the National Geographic Society, in 1916, because there were three major peaks. The volcano has been known by several variants of the name. The feature was officially named Mount Trident by the United States Board on Geographic Names in 1928. The board assigned the current name in 1968.  Historical volcanic activity  Map showing volcanoes of Alaska Peninsula. 1953 Eruption There is no evidence of recent eruptive activity at the summit of Trident, nor have there been any reports of historical activity, except fumarolic activity on the east side. The earliest known activity was minor eruptions in 1913, 1949 and 1950. A satellite cone formed February 15, 1953 on the southwest flank of Trident following a major explosive eruption that sent ash to an altitude of over . A succession of blocky lava flows were erupted in 1954, 1957, 1958, 1959-1960 from the new vent. Ash eruptions, some to altitudes over , were associated with several of the lava eruptions. By 1960, the dome had grown nearly high and a sequence of viscous flows, up to thick and covering an area of about south of the volcano, had been extruded. Further explosions were reported in the early to late 1960s. Lava extrusion, accompanied by explosions, was also reported from 1966 to 1968 and 1974 to 1975. In 1983, steam and/or vapor continued to rise from the central vent area of the new cone as well as from numerous fumaroles on the near-vent portion of the blocky lava flows.  Composition  Trident lavas are andesitic to dacitic in composition. The dominant phenocrysts are zoned plagioclase, hypersthene, calcic clinopyroxene, titanomagnetite, and rimmed olivine. The five flows which erupted from the new vent during the period from 1953 to 1963 are olivine-bearing, two pyroxene, high-silica andesite.

It is the administrative centre of the City of Melton local government area and its most populous centre. At June 2018 Melton had an estimated urban population of 68,765, Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018.and has grown steadily with an average annual rate of 4.88% year-on-year for the five years to 2018. It is considered part of the Greater Melbourne metropolitan area and is included in the capital's population statistical division.http://www.vcec.vic.gov.au/CA256EAF001C7B21/WebObj/MelbourneSD/$File/Melbourne%20SD.pdf Melbourne Statistical Division Melton began as a small town before being declared a satellite suburb in 1974, separated from Melbourne's urban area by a green wedge. Since the 1990s it has experienced rapid suburban growth into surrounding greenfield land and has become a commuter town in the Melbourne- Ballarat growth corridor. Changes to Melbourne's urban growth boundary passed by the state government in 2010 effectively relinquish its satellite city status as it is planned to become part of Melbourne's future conurbation.http://www.melton.vic.gov.au/Page/Page.asp?Page_Id=1526&h;=1 It is named after Melton Mowbray in the United Kingdom. History Melton was first settled by squatters establishing sheep runs in the area in the 1830s and a small settlement benefited from traffic passing through it on the way to the Ballarat gold fields during the Victorian Gold Rush. The post office opened on 1 March 1856. The area was declared a satellite city in 1974 and a green belt existed between it and the urban area of Melbourne until the late 1990s. Geography Melton is located on mostly flat, largely featureless, former volcanic plains. To the south-east of Melton Township is Mount Cottrell, a blast-shield volcano, and to the north-east of the township is Mount Kororoit. These two volcanoes are some of the easternmost volcanoes on the Victorian Volcanic Plain which extends to the South Australian border. City and suburbs Melton consists of seven suburban areas forming a single urban area with the locality of Melton at its centre. In the south of Melton are the suburbs of Melton South and Brookfield. In the north are Kurunjang and Toolern Vale while in the west is the suburb of Melton West. On the 9th of February 2017, a new division called Harkness was gazetted in the north west. High Street is the main activity centre, but the urban area lacks a true central business district, with retail, business and civic facilities largely decentralised across the urban area. Additional shopping centres can be found in Melton South at the railway station, and in Melton West (Woodgrove Shopping Centre). Woodgrove Shopping Centre expanded in 2013 and now is the area's largest shopping venue, consisting of a Coles, Woolworths, Big W, Kmart, Reading Cinemas and approximately 160 specialty stores.http://www.woodgrove.com.au/customer-service/about-us.aspx Arts and culture Community Hall Djerriwarrh Festival parade Many live performances are held at the Melton Civic Centre, on High Street, and also at the Tabcorp Park racing complex, on Ferris Road, Melton South.

It is also within the broadcast range of all commercial radio stations from Melbourne, and is an end point for digital radio broadcasts in metropolitan Melbourne. Digital radio is available in most of the city but signal diminishes towards the west. Melton has one local newspaper, Starweekly Melton. The city is also home to a radio station, 979fm. Transport Melton Station Road transport and in particular the motor vehicle are the main form of transport. Melton has been identified by the Department of Transport as one of the most car-dependent communities in Greater Melbourne.http://www.transport.vic.gov.au/DOI/DOIElect.nsf/$UNIDS+for+Web+Display/2F39BE88F87138ECCA2577C3000DB4EA/$FILE/IA-2009-MeltonDuplicationandElectrification- Stages1-6.pdf As such its residents rely heavily on its substantial network of busy roads. The Western Freeway connects Melton with Melbourne's west runs through the urban area to the south, but bypasses the city centre which is located along High Street, a very wide dual carriageway with service lanes. There are two major freeway interchanges at the centre of the urban area. Both are diamond interchanges, one at Coburns Road which is the main north-south arterial and another for Ferris Road/Melton Highway (C754) on the eastern fringe. These interchanges generate heavy traffic congestion and are major accident blackspots.Rage over Melton's Ferris RdRoad to danger in Melton shire A road reservation exists for a third diamond interchange at Bulmans Road on the western fringe. The C754 is a popular alternative route to the northern suburbs of Melbourne and branches north to the Melton-Gisborne Road (C705) at Kurrunjang connecting Melton to Gisborne. The roads play an important role in public transport with Sita Buslines routes serving the suburbs between 5:30am-9pm on weekdays and 8am-9pm on weekends connect the suburbs to the railway station and also Melbourne's outer suburbs including the 456 to Sunshine via Caroline Springs; 457 from Melton West to the railway station; 458 Kurunjang to the railway station; and 459 Arnolds Creek to the railway station via Westlake. Coach services run from a terminal at the railway station and include Bacchus Marsh Coaches operates school bus services in Melton with connections to Rockbank, Toolern Vale, Bacchus Marsh and Sunbury.http://www.bmcoaches.com.au/html/school_services.asp A shuttle bus provides direct services from Melton to Melbourne Airport.http://www.airportshuttlebus.com.au/?id=melton Rail transport includes both passenger rail and freight rail. The city's only station is Melton railway station (located in Melton South) which is on the Serviceton railway line. Despite being within Melbourne's metropolitan area and within Metropoliltan Zone 2, rail travelers rely on diesel locomotive passenger train services operated by V/Line. Some VLocity Ballarat services, Ararat services, Maryborough services as well as most N class and P class Bacchus Marsh services stop at Melton en route to and from Southern Cross station. A high frequency is available due to the different services, but the journey time to Southern Cross as a result can range from 27‚Äì48 minutes during peak travel times.

Early life Ruaraidh Erskine was born The Honourable Stuart Richard Joseph Erskine at 1 Portland Place, Brighton, East Sussex, England on 15 January 1869. He was the third of the four children born to William Macnaghten Erskine, 5th Baron Erskine (1841‚Äì1913), an army officer, and his wife, Caroline Alice Martha Grimble. The family were descendants of the Erskine Earls of Buchan. Derick S. Thomson, ‚ÄòErskine, Stuart Richard (1869‚Äì1960)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Oct 2009; online edn, Sept 2010 Erskine learned to speak Scottish Gaelic from his childhood nanny, who came from Harris, and this kindled the enthusiasm which was to be a main hallmark of his career. His imagination was fired early by the Irish nationalist movement and these combined influences, together with his family's Scottish roots, led to his development as a prominent Gaelic nationalist, whose compelling dream was of a self-governing Celtic Scotland. As essential steps towards the realization of this dream he was actively involved in the fostering of Gaelic consciousness and in the extension of Gaelic usage, especially in the written form. He hoped that a significant extension of Gaelic literary range would contribute to the raising of literary standards, in a reaction against what he saw as the down-grading influence of music-hall and ‚Äòpop‚Äô culture on Gaelic verse in the second half of the nineteenth century. He probably also viewed his activity as a response to the dominance of folk culture in the Gaelic literary world.  Journalism and the Neo-Jacobite Revival In 1890, he co- founded The Whirlwind with Herbert Vivian a weekly newspaper. Although the paper was published for less than a year, it printed works by a number of notable artists, including Walter Sickert and James NcNeill Whistler, and espoused a Jacobite philosophy, and the restoration of the House of Stuart. Erskine, along with Vivian and Melville Henry Massue founded the Legitimist Jacobite League of Great Britain and Ireland in 1891, and he was president of the organisation in 1893, 1894 and 1897. In 1891, he stood as a candidate for the Buteshire constituency as a \\"Scottish Tory Home Ruler\\", but by October of that year, he had withdrawn.  Scottish nationalism  In 1892, aged 23, he became vice-president of the Scottish Home Rule Association, but he grew to oppose the notion of home rule for Scotland within the United Kingdom and went on to support Scottish independence. In 1904 he formed the Guth na Bliadhna (Voice of the Year) publication and used it to advocate independence and a coming together of the Gaels of both Scotland and Ireland to aid each other in a campaign to establish their respective languages as the official language of their country. He also used the magazine to call for the formation of a political party to campaign for independence. His activities with the publication brought him into contact with William Gillies, with whom he formed the Scots National League (SNL) in 1920, thus going some way towards the realisation of the formation of a Scottish nationalist political party. Despite his aristocratic background, Erskine had links with the socialist figure John Maclean who was himself an advocate of an independent (socialist) Scotland. Erskine had at one stage described socialism as \\"a predatory creed\\", but by the time of the First World War he was becoming more politically radical and finding sympathy with the cause of figures such as Maclean. He championed the Easter Rising in Ireland in 1916, and attempted to foster links with the Irish nationalist community by attempting to set up a joint Scottish- Irish Celtic newspaper with Art O'Brian the president of the Irish Self Determination League. Erskine attempted to get independent representation for Scotland at the Paris Peace Conference at the end of the First World War. In this he was ultimately unsuccessful, but it did attract the support of figures such as James Maxton, a prominent figure in the Independent Labour Party at the time. Erskine and Gillies led the SNL into joining with other groups to form the National Party of Scotland (NPS) in 1928. The NPS was quite different in outlook to the SNL had been and many SNL members left the NPS due to this factor, including Erskine. After this, Erskine was to play little role in politics. Erskine has been accused of being reactionary. Some of his ideas, however, have gained in popularity over time, e.g. Scottish independence, land reform (through the land league), and even the Scottish Gaelic revival. His pan-Celticism has received some attention from the Celtic Congress and Celtic League.  Personal life  In May 1891, the engagement of Erskine and Muriel Lilias Colquhoun Graham was announced; they were married on 18 July 1891.

He was considered one of the most brilliant mathematical minds of the time in America, during a period when few academics conducted original research. He is chiefly remembered for his formulation of the method of least squares. Biography He was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Ireland, but left Ireland after being wounded in the failed uprising of the United Irishmen in 1798https://archive.org/stream/newinternational01gilm#page/127/mode/1up and moved to Princeton, New Jersey. He taught mathematics at various schools in the United States. He was president of the York County Academy in York, Pennsylvania, from 1801 to 1805. He is chiefly remembered for his formulation of the method of least squares, published in 1808. Adrain certainly did not know of the work of C.F. Gauss on least squares (published 1809), although it is possible that he had read A.M. Legendre's article on the topic (published 1806). Adrain was an editor of and contributor to the Mathematical Correspondent, the first mathematical journal in the United States. Later he twice attempted to found his own journal, The Analyst, or, Mathematical Museum, but in both the 1808 and 1814 attempts it did not attract sufficient subscribers and quickly ceased publication. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1813. In 1825 he founded a somewhat more successful publication targeting a wider readership, The Mathematical Diary, which was published through 1832. Adrain, Gauss, and Legendre all motivated the method of least squares by the problem of reconciling disparate physical measurements; in the case of Gauss and Legendre, the measurements in question were astronomical, and in Adrain's case they were survey measurements. Adrain was the father of Congressman Garnett B. Adrain. Robert Adrain died in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He is commemorated by a blue plaque, unveiled at Carrickfergus by the Ulster History Circle.

Later editions of the game moved the bulk of the game rules to the Player's Handbook, leaving information needed chiefly by the DM in the Dungeon Master's Guide. The new rules were so open-ended that game campaigns required a referee or Dungeon Master. The Players Handbook contained the information needed to play the standard character classes: clerics (including druids), fighters (including rangers and paladins), magic-users (including illusionists), thieves (including assassins), and monks. The book also included information on non-human races, such as dwarves, elves, and halflings, character abilities, armor and weapons, spell descriptions, and optional rules for psionics. The original Players Handbook was reviewed by Don Turnbull in issue No. 10 of White Dwarf, who gave the book a rating of 10 out of 10. Turnbull noted, \\"I don't think I have ever seen a product sell so quickly as did the Handbook when it first appeared on the Games Workshop stand at Dragonmeet\\", a British role-playing game convention; after the convention, he studied the book and concluded that \\"whereas the original rules are ambiguous and muddled, the Handbook is a detailed and coherent game-system, and very sophisticated.\\" Turnbull felt a bit of apprehension at the amount of time it would require to digest all the new material, but concluded by saying \\"I said of the Monster Manual that it was TSR's most impressive publication to date; that is no longer true--this accolade must belong to the Handbook which is nothing short of a triumph.\\" In 1983, TSR changed the cover art of the Players Handbook, although the interior contents remained the same.

Bird reserve The island is owned by the Duke of Northumberland. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds manages the island as a bird reserve, for its important seabird colonies. The most numerous species is the puffin, with over 18,000 pairs nesting in 2002, but the island is most important for the largest colony of the endangered roseate tern in Britain, which, thanks to conservation measures including the provision of nestboxes to protect the nests from gulls and bad weather, has risen to 118 pairs in 2018. Other nesting birds include sandwich tern, common tern, Arctic tern, black-legged kittiwake, fulmar, three other gull species, and eider duck. The island is uninhabited in winter, but seasonal wardens are present throughout the summer to protect the nesting birds. Landing on Coquet Island for the general public is prohibited, but local boating companies from Amble sail close up to the island in good weather throughout the summer, allowing visitors to get good views of the puffins and roseate terns. Coquet Lighthouse Coquet Island Lighthouse Coquet Island also holds the remaining structure of a medieval monastery on the southwestern shore, which was largely incorporated into the 19th-century lighthouse and lighthouse keepers' cottages. Coquet Lighthouse was built by Trinity House in 1841 at a cost of ¬£3,268. James Walker designed the lighthouse, which is a white square tower of sandstone, with walls more than one metre thick, surrounded by a turreted parapet. The first keeper at Coquet Lighthouse was William Darling, the elder brother of Grace Darling. The lighthouse was initially provided with a large (first-order) fixed dioptric along with a set of mirrors (which were replaced with refracting prisms ten years later); the lens was by Isaac Cookson & co. of Newcastle upon Tyne. The lamp was oil-fuelled. In 1854 red sectors were added, to warn ships of Hauxley Point to the south and Boulmer Rocks to the north. Later a second sector light was added, pointing south from a lower window in the tower. By the 1890s the main light was made occulting. In 1976 the light was electrified and 1990 the lighthouse was automated, at which point a revolving array of quartz halogen sealed beam lamps were installed in place of the old optic,Photo, 1990. with columns of lamps grouped in threes on a rotating pedestal, so as to display three flashes every 30 seconds. Subsequently, these were replaced by a small revolving optic, mounted on an AGA PRB gearless drive. Coquet's light has been solar powered since 2008. The original 1841‚Äì1851 optic is now on public display, along with the old occulting apparatus, at Souter Lighthouse, further down the coast. They had previously been part of the Trinity House National Lighthouse Museum collection.

Most such schools, where they still exist, are now denominated \\"teacher-training colleges\\" or \\"teachers' colleges\\" and may be organized as part of a comprehensive university. Normal schools in the United States, Canada and Argentina trained teachers for primary schools, while in continental Europe, the equivalent colleges educated teachers for primary, secondary and tertiary schools. In 1685, St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, founder of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, founded what is generally considered the first normal school, the √âcole Normale, in Reims, Champagne, France. The term \\"normal\\" herein refers to the goal of these institutions to instill and reinforce particular norms within students. \\"Norms\\" included historical behavioral norms of the time, as well as norms that reinforced targeted societal values, ideologies and dominant narratives in the form of curriculum. The first public normal school in the United States was founded in Concord, Vermont, by Samuel Read Hall in 1823 to train teachers. In 1839, the first state-supported normal school was established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on the northeast corner of the historic Lexington Battle Green; it evolved into Framingham State University. The first modern teacher training school in China was established by educator Sheng Xuanhuai in 1895 as the normal school of the Nanyang Public School (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in Shanghai during the Qing dynasty. Many comprehensive public or state- supported universities, such as the University of California, Los Angeles in the United States and Beijing Normal University in China, were established and operated as normal schools before expanding their faculties and organizing as research universities. Some of these universities, particularly in Asia, retain the word \\"Normal\\" in their name to recognize their historical purpose. In Canada, most normal schools were eventually assimilated into a university as its faculty of education, offering a one or two-year Bachelor of Education degree. Such a degree requires at least three, but usually four, years of prior undergraduate study. Etymology The term \\"normal school\\" originated in the early 16th century from the French √©cole normale. The French concept of an \\"√©cole normale\\" was to provide a model school with model classrooms to teach model teaching practices to its student teachers. The children being taught, their teachers, and the teachers of the teachers were often together in the same building. Although a laboratory school, it was the official school for the children‚Äîprimary or secondary.  Europe  Educating teachers was of great importance in the newly industrialized European economies and their need for a reliable, reproducible and uniform work force. The process of instating such norms within students depended upon the creation of the first uniform, formalized national educational curriculum. Thus, normal schools, as the teacher training schools, were tasked with both developing this new curriculum and developing the techniques through which teachers would instill these ideas, behaviors and values in the minds of their students.  Germany  In Germany schools of education only exist in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. These schools prepare teachers for Grundschule (primary school) and secondary schools like Hauptschule and Realschule (Mainschool and Realschool). Teachers for the Gymnasium are educated at universities.  Finland  In Finland, normal schools are under national university administration, whereas most schools are administered by the local municipality. Teacher aspirants do most of their compulsory trainee period in normal schools and teach while being supervised by a senior teacher.  France and Italy  In France, a two-tier system developed since the Revolution: primary school teachers were educated at d√©partemental √©coles normales, high school teachers and university professors at the √âcoles normales sup√©rieures. Nowadays all teachers are educated in (Graduate School of Teaching and Education). The √âcoles Normales Sup√©rieures in France and the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa in Italy now focus mainly on training researchers.  Lithuania  In Lithuania, Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences (LEU), former Vilnius Pedagogical University (VPU) is the main teachers' training institution, established in 1935.  Serbia  In Serbia, the first public normal school was founded in Sombor, Vojvodina, by Avram Mrazoviƒá in 1778 to train teachers. In 2018, the Faculty of Education in Sombor celebrated 240 years since the founding of the first school for the education of Serbian teachers called Norma. It was a teacher training college at the beginning called Norma college before it was closed in 1811 and another school was opened in its place in 1812 in Szentendre under the Declaratory Rescript of the Illyrian Nation. The new institution was named Regium Pedagogium Nationis Illiricae or Royal Pedagogium Of The Illyrian-Serbian Nation (also referred to in Latin as Preparandium or Preparadija in Serbian) which eventually was relocated back to Sombor in 1816. The Normal school - Teachers College is generally considered the first normal school or √âcole normale in Sombor. The term \\"normal\\" in this case refers to \\"the goal of the institution to instill and reinforce particular norms within students\\". Also, these \\"norms included historical behavioral norms of the time, as well as norms that reinforced targeted societal values, ideologies and dominant narratives in the form of curriculum\\". For the longest time, this was the only academy for teachers' training in Serbian. The first woman academician of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Isidora Sekuliƒá, the poet Jovan Duƒçiƒá, the composers Petar Konjoviƒá and Josif Marinkoviƒá are just some of the alumni of Norma.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, teacher training colleges were once separate institutions, and many such colleges adopted the title \\"College of Higher Education\\". A restructuring of higher education in the UK during the 1980s resulted in many of these adopting the status of \\"university\\". The University of Chester traces its roots back to 1839 as the earliest training college in the United Kingdom. Others were established by religious institutions and were single-sex until World War II. Since then, they have either become multi-discipline universities in their own right (e.g. University of Chester, St Mary's University, Twickenham, Edge Hill University) or merged with another university to become its faculty of education (e.g. Moray House). Following the recommendation in the 1963 Robbins Report into higher education, teacher training colleges were renamed colleges of education. For information about academic divisions devoted to this field outside of the United States and Canada, see Postgraduate Training in Education (disambiguation). In Wales, there were at least three institutions which included the word 'Normal' in their name: Normal School, Brecon subsequently relocated to become Normal College Swansea (where the academic and mathematician John Viriamu Jones was educated) and Normal College, Bangor (founded 1858), which survived until 1996, when it became part of University of Wales Bangor. The latter was one of the last institutions in the UK to retain the word \\"Normal\\" in its name.  Asia = China  Students of the Beiyang Women's Normal School, an early example of a normal school in China (1912) In Mainland China, the \\"normal school\\" terminology is still preserved in the official English names of former normal schools established in the late 19th and early 20th century. The Chinese term normal university (, abbreviated Â∏àÂ§ß; shƒ´d√†) refers to a modern comprehensive university established as a normal school in the early twentieth century. These \\"normal universities\\" are usually controlled by the national or provincial government. In 1895, Qing banking tycoon and educator Sheng Xuanhuai gained approval from the Guangxu Emperor to establish the Nanyang Public School in Shanghai, China. This comprehensive institution included the first normal school on the Chinese mainland. Since 1949, many former normal schools in China have developed into comprehensive research universities. As of 2012, East China Normal University and Beijing Normal University, both members of the national government's Project 985 program, have been ranked the top two among the mainland Chinese universities that originated as normal schools.  Malaysia  Trainee teachers at the college in Salatiga, Java, Indonesia (October 5, 1929) In Malaysia, the Ministry of Education runs a total of 27 Institutes of Teacher Education (ITEs), which were formerly known as Teacher Training Colleges. These ITEs function primarily to educated both undergraduate and postgraduate teacher trainees. The ministry bureau responsible for overseeing them is the Teacher Education Division. The ITEs also run in-service teacher training and continuous professional development among qualified teachers.  Philippines  In Naga City, the Philippines, one can find the oldest normal school for girls in the Far East, the Universidad de Santa Isabel. It is a sectarian school run by the Daughters of Charity. The first secular normal school was founded in 1901 by the Thomasites, the Philippine Normal School. It was converted into a college in 1949 and was elevated to its present university status in 1992 as the Philippine Normal University. In 2009, it was named National Center of Excellence for Teacher Education by virtue of Republic Act 9647. In Iloilo City, the West Visayas State University was originally established as a normal school in 1902; in 1994, it was recognized by the Philippines government as a Center for Teaching Excellence.  Taiwan  Japanese colonial era at the National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei In Taiwan, three universities served as national normal universities historically. Located in Taipei, Changhua, and Kaohsiung, the schools prepared secondary school teachers; these schools' missions have expanded since to make them de facto liberal arts universities. Ten Taiwanese teachers' colleges (, abbreviated Â∏´Èô¢; shƒ´yu√†n, \\"normal colleges\\") originated as normal schools established by the Japanese. After the end of World War 2 these were reorganized as provincial normal schools by the Kuomintang and then as provincial teachers' colleges. With the arrival of pluralistic democracy in the early 1990s these colleges came under national control, and by the mid-2000s (decade) all had been renamed as \\"universities of education\\" (ÊïôËÇ≤Â§ßÂ≠∏) or simply \\"universities\\" to signify their more comprehensive missions.  Oceania = New Zealand  In New Zealand, the term normal school can refer to a primary or intermediate school used for teacher training, such as the Epsom Normal Primary School (in Auckland), Kelburn Normal School, Palmerston North Intermediate Normal School, Papakura Normal School or Tahuna Normal Intermediate School. They were associated with a teachers' training college, such as the Auckland College of Education and the Dunedin College of Education, which became colleges of education that trained secondary as well as primary and intermediate school teachers. North and South America=CanadaAlberta= The Calgary Normal School in Calgary was initially located at 412 - 7 Street SW in Calgary in what is called the McDougall School founded shortly after Alberta became a province in 1905. Its history is part of the founding of the University of Calgary in 1966. Another Normal school was founded at Camrose (also called Rosehaven Normal school) in 1912. The Edmonton Normal School, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada was opened in 1920 in Edmonton, Alberta. In 1945 all normal schools in Alberta were merged into the University of Alberta's faculty of education. =British Columbia= In 1901 the first Provincial Normal School in British Columbia was opened in Vancouver. Classes commenced on 9 January 1901. In January 1909, the Provincial Normal school moved into a new facility and its own building located at 11th and Cambie (now part of City Square Mall). In 1915 a second Provincial Normal School opened in Victoria. Trainee teachers from greater Vancouver and the lower Mainland attended the Normal School in Vancouver. Students from Vancouver Island and students outside the Lower Mainland, that is, from the Upper Fraser Valley and communities in the interior of the province ‚Äì enrolled in the Normal School in Victoria. That school was originally located in Victoria High School and later in its own building which is now part of Camosun College.

Teachers' training is considered higher education and requires a high school diploma, but normal schools have the particularity of granting five year teacher degrees for primary school or four year degrees for kindergarten, while at the same time hosting secondary, primary school students, and kindergarten and pre-school. Teachers-to-be do intense practical training in the schools annexed to the higher education section. This is the main difference with other teachers' training institutions called Instituto de Formaci√≥n Docente and with universities that grant teaching degrees. Other Latin American nations have long traditions of normal schools. In Panama, the Escuela Normal Juan Dem√≥stenes Arosemena was founded in Santiago de Veraguas, Panama in 1938. In Colombia, normal schools were primarily associated with women's religious schools although in modern times have admitted men, thus forming escuelas normales mixtas (mixed normal schools). In Paraguay, they are known as Instituto de Formaci√≥n Docente.

The Normal School went through several name changes in the following decades‚Äîfirst to Murray State Normal School and Teachers College (1922), Murray State Teachers College (1930), Murray State College (1948), and finally Murray State University (1966). =Other normal schools in the USA= * 1861 - Edinboro State Normal School, later Edinboro University of Pennsylvania * 1862 - Mansfield State Normal School, later Mansfield University of Pennsylvania * 1862 - California State Normal School, later San Jos√© State University in San Jose and the University of California, Los Angeles in Los Angeles * 1867 - State Normal School of Marshall College, later Marshall University of West Virginia * 1869 - St. Cloud State Normal School or Third State Normal School, later St. Cloud State University * 1869 - Southern Illinois State Normal School, later Southern Illinois University Carbondale * 1882 - Normal School at Cheney, later Eastern Washington University * 1882 - Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute, then Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute, later Virginia State University * 1886 - Washington State Normal School at Bellingham or Northwest Normal School or State Normal School at Whatcom, later Western Washington University * 1887 - Northern Branch of the California State Normal School, later California State University, Chico * 1889 - State Normal School at Cheney, later Eastern Washington University * 1889 - State Normal School of Colorado, in Greeley, Colorado later University of Northern Colorado, and in 1911 in Gunnison, Colorado later Western Colorado University * 1889- Slippery Rock State Normal School, later Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania * 1890 - State Normal School at Valley City, later Valley City State University of North Dakota * 1891 - State Normal School (Athens, Georgia), later University of Georgia * 1895 - Duluth State Normal School, later University of Minnesota Duluth * 1895 - Northern Illinois State Normal School, later Northern Illinois University * 1895 - Eastern Illinois State Normal School, later Eastern Illinois University * 1899 - Western Illinois State Normal School, later Western Illinois University * 1899 - San Francisco State Normal School, later San Francisco State University * 1910 - West Texas State Normal College, later West Texas A&M; University * 1923 - Durham State Normal School, later North Carolina Central University * 1925 - Maryland State Normal School, later Salisbury University See also * √âcole normale sup√©rieure * Female seminary * List of normal schools by country * Normal, Alabama * Normal, Illinois * Normal Station, Memphis References Bibliography  * * Category:Education by subject Category:History of education Category:School types Category:Teacher training Category:Types of university or college fr:√âcole normale ","title":"Normal school"},{"id":"467368","title":"The Lone Gunmen"},{"id":"467370","text":"Jonesville may refer to:  Locations in the United States  *Jonesville, California *Jonesville, Florida *Jonesville, Indiana *Jonesville, Louisiana *Jonesville, Michigan *Jonesville, New York *Jonesville, North Carolina *Jonesville, South Carolina *Jonesville, Texas *Jonesville, Vermont *Jonesville, Virginia  See also  * Jonestown ","title":"Jonesville"},{"id":"467377","title":"List of Welsh principal areas by population"},{"id":"467379","text":"Merritt is a surname.

In time series analysis, the shift operator is called the lag operator. Shift operators are examples of linear operators, important for their simplicity and natural occurrence. The shift operator action on functions of a real variable plays an important role in harmonic analysis, for example, it appears in the definitions of almost periodic functions, positive definite functions, and convolution. Shifts of sequences (functions of an integer variable) appear in diverse areas such as Hardy spaces, the theory of abelian varieties, and the theory of symbolic dynamics, for which the baker's map is an explicit representation.

It is told in episodic form by a first-person narrator, in a series of glimpses into the mind and soul of the central character Charles Strickland, a middle-aged English stockbroker, who abandons his wife and children abruptly to pursue his desire to become an artist. The story is in part based on the life of the painter Paul Gauguin. Plot summary The novel is written largely from the point of view of the narrator, a young, aspiring writer and playwright in London. Certain chapters entirely comprise accounts of events by other characters, which the narrator recalls from memory (selectively editing or elaborating on certain aspects of dialogue, particularly Strickland's, as Strickland is said by the narrator to have a very poor ability to express himself in words). The narrator first develops an acquaintance with Strickland's wife at literary parties, and later meets Strickland himself, who appears to be an unremarkable businessman with no interest in his wife's literary or artistic tastes. Strickland is a well-off, middle-class stockbroker in London sometime in late 19th or early 20th century. Early in the novel, he leaves his wife and children and goes to Paris. (The narrator enters directly into the story at this point, when he is asked by Mrs Strickland to go to Paris and talk with her husband.) He lives a destitute but defiantly content life there as a painter, lodging in run-down hotels and falling prey to both illness and hunger. Strickland, in his drive to express through his art what appears to continually possess and compel him on the inside, cares nothing for physical discomfort and is indifferent to his surroundings. He is helped and supported by a commercially successful but hackneyed Dutch painter, Dirk Stroeve (coincidentally, also an old friend of the narrator's), who recognises Strickland's genius as a painter. After helping Strickland recover from a life-threatening illness, Stroeve is repaid by having his wife, Blanche, abandon him for Strickland. Strickland later discards the wife; all he really sought from Blanche was a model to paint, not serious companionship, and it is hinted in the novel's dialogue that he indicated this to her and she took the risk anyway. Blanche then commits suicide ‚Äì yet another human casualty in Strickland's single-minded pursuit of art and beauty; the first casualties being his own established life and those of his wife and children. After the Paris episode, the story continues in Tahiti. Strickland has already died, and the narrator attempts to piece together his life there from recollections of others. He finds that Strickland had taken up a native woman, had two children by her, one of whom died, and started painting profusely. We learn that Strickland had settled for a short while in the French port of Marseilles before traveling to Tahiti, where he lived for a few years before dying of leprosy. Strickland left behind numerous paintings, but his magnum opus, which he painted on the walls of his hut before losing his sight to leprosy, was burnt after his death by his wife per his dying orders. Inspiration > The Moon and Sixpence is not, of course, a life of Paul Gauguin in the form > of fiction. It is founded on what I had heard about him, but I used only the > main facts of his story and for the rest trusted to such gifts of invention > as I was fortunate enough to possess.Author's preface to The Selected Novels > of W. Somerset Maugham, (Volume 2), William Heinemann, 1953 (ebook at > archive.org). The life of the French artist Paul Gauguin is the inspiration for the story, however the character of Strickland as a solitary, sociopathic and destructive genius is more related to a mythological version of Gauguin's life, which the artist himself developed and promoted, than the actual course of the artist's life. The real Gauguin was a participant in the artistic developments in France in the 1880s, exhibiting his work regularly with the Impressionists, and having friendships and collaborations with many artists. Gauguin did work as a stockbroker, did leave his wife and family to devote his life to art, and did leave Europe for Tahiti to pursue his career; however none of this happened in the brutal way of the novel's character. Maugham took inspiration from the published writings about Gauguin available at the time, as well as personal experience living among the artistic community in Paris in 1904, and a visit to Tahiti in 1914. Strickland is created as an extreme version of the \\"modern artist as 'genius'\\", indifferent and frequently hostile to the people around him. Writing in 1953, Maugham describes the idea for the book arising during a year that he spent living in Paris in 1904: \\"...I met men who had known him and worked with him at Pont-Aven. I heard much about him. It occurred to me that there was in what I was told the subject of a novel\\". The idea remained in his mind for ten years, until a visit to Tahiti in 1914, where Maugham was able to meet people who had known Gauguin, inspired him to start writing. The critic Amy Dickson examines the relationship between Gauguin and Strickland. She contrasts the novel's description of Strickland, \\"his faults are accepted as the necessary complement of his merits... but one thing can never be doubtful, and that is that he had genius,\\" with Gauguin's description of himself, \\"I am an artist and you are right, you're not mad, I am a great artist and I know it. It's because I know it that I have endured such sufferings. To have done otherwise I would consider myself a brigand -- which is what many people think I am.\\" Dickson sums up the novel as follows: \\"Maugham was fascinated by the impact of the arrival of modernism from Europe on an insular British consciousness and the emergence of the cult of the modernist artist-genius -- The Moon and Sixpence is at once a satire of Edwardian mores and a Gauguin biography.\\"Amy Dickson, Gauguin: A very British reception in B. Thompson (ed.), Gauguin: Maker of Myth, Tate Publishing, 2010, pp. 68-9. About the title According to some sources, the title, the meaning of which is not explicitly revealed in the book, was taken from a review of Maugham's novel Of Human Bondage in which the novel's protagonist, Philip Carey, is described as \\"so busy yearning for the moon that he never saw the sixpence at his feet.\\"Anthony Curtis and John Whitehead, eds, W. Somerset Maugham, The Critical Heritage, Routledge, 1987, p.10. According to a 1956 letter from Maugham, \\"If you look on the ground in search of a sixpence, you don't look up, and so miss the moon.\\" Maugham's title echoes the description of Gauguin by his contemporary biographer, Meier-Graefe (1908): \\"He [Gauguin] may be charged with having always wanted something else.\\" Adaptations The book was made into a stage play in 1925 at the New Theatre with Henry Ainley as Strickland and Eileen Sharp as Ata and a film of the same name directed and written by Albert Lewin. Released in 1942, the film stars George Sanders as Charles Strickland. The novel served as the basis for a 1957 opera, also titled The Moon and Sixpence, by John Gardner to a libretto by Patrick Terry which premiered at Sadlers Wellshttp://www.johnlintongardner.co.uk/biography.htm Writer S Lee Pogostin adapted it for American TV in 1959. This production, The Moon and Sixpence (1959), starred Laurence Olivier, with Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in supporting roles. In popular culture In the opening scene of Fran√ßois Truffaut's 1966 film Fahrenheit 451, an adaptation of Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel of the same name, several firemen are preparing books for burning. In the crowd of onlookers is a little boy who picks up one of the books and thumbs through it before his father takes it from him and throws it on the pile with the rest. That book is The Moon and Sixpence. The book was mentioned in Agatha Christie's 1942 mystery (Hercule Poirot series) novel Five Little Pigs, when Poirot asks one of the suspects (Angela Warren) if she read the book at the time the crime was committed. It is also mentioned frequently in Stephen King's 1998 novel Bag of Bones and in passing in his 2015 novel Finders Keepers. Ray Noble's 1932 dance band hit \\"We've Got the Moon and Sixpence\\", sung by Al Bowlly, takes its name from the book and Jack Kerouac mentions the book in his 1958 novella The Subterraneans, and it was mentioned in James Jones's 1951 novel From Here to Eternity, in a conversation between Sergeant Warden and Corporal Mazzioli.

The freeway begins at its junction with the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405, I-405), called the El Toro Y, in Irvine, signed as I-5. From there, it generally goes southeast to northwest to the East Los Angeles Interchange, where it takes the designation of U.S. Route 101 (US 101). It then proceeds northwest to the Four Level Interchange (also known as the Bill Keene Memorial Interchange) in downtown Los Angeles. Formerly, the entirety of the route was marked as US 101 until the 1964 highway renumbering, which truncated US 101 to the East Los Angeles Interchange and designated the rest of the freeway as I-5. North of the East Los Angeles Interchange complex, I-5 follows the Golden State Freeway. South of the El Toro Y, I-5 takes on the San Diego Freeway name from I-405. An abundance of landmarks, most importantly Disneyland and Angel Stadium of Anaheim, along the Orange County portion of its route combines with a severe bottleneck beginning at the Los Angeles County line (shrinking from 10 to 6 lanes) to make it one of the most congested freeways in Southern California. The infamously busy intersection of the Santa Ana, Garden Grove, and Orange freeways in southwestern Orange is nicknamed the Orange Crush. The freeway is officially defined as Routes 101 and 5 from Route 110 (Four Level Interchange) to Route 405. History Interstate 605 (the San Gabriel River Freeway) in southeastern Los Angeles County. The Santa Ana Freeway is a bypass of the original state highway from Los Angeles to Santa Ana, which passed through Whittier and mostly became SR 72 in the 1964 renumbering. Southeast of Santa Ana, this earlier highway, added to the state highway system in 1910 as Route 2, generally followed the present freeway from Tustin past East Irvine to El Toro.Ben Blow, California Highways: A Descriptive Record of Road Development by the State and by Such Counties as Have Paved Highways, 1920 (Archive.org or Internet Archive), pp. 165, 194-195 This route was marked as part of US 101 in 1928.California Highways and Public Works, United States Numbered Highways, January 1928 In 1933, the state legislature added a number of routes to the state highway system, including two that later formed parts of the Santa Ana Freeway. Route 166 began at the new Route 172 (now SR 60), at the corner of Indiana and Third Streets, and headed south on Indiana Street and east and southeast on Mines Avenue (Olympic Boulevard) and Anaheim-Telegraph Road (now Telegraph Road) to Route 171 (now SR 39) at the intersection with Los Nietos Road near Santa Fe Springs. Route 174 began at Route 60 (then signed Alternate U. S. 101 now SR 1) in what now is known as Westchester and followed Manchester Avenue and Firestone Boulevard (then under construction alongside the Southern Pacific Railroad's Santa Ana Branch) to Route 2 (then Los Angeles Street, now Anaheim Boulevard) in southern Anaheim. A second piece began further southeast on Route 2, where it turned east on Chapman Avenue, and followed the shorter Santa Ana Boulevard diagonally to Route 2 (Main Street) in northern Santa Ana.: \\"Los Angeles, Indiana and 3rd Streets, to the Huntington Beach-Whittier Road near Santa Fe Springs.\\" \\"State Highway Route 60 via Manchester Avenue to State Highway Route 2 near Miraflores.\\" \\"State Highway Route 2 near Orange County Hospital to Main Street, Santa Ana, via Santa Ana Boulevard.\\": \\"Route 166 is from Route 172, at the intersection of Indiana and Third Streets, in Los Angeles, to Route 171 near Santa Fe Springs.\\" \\"Route 174 is from: (a) Route 60 via Manchester Avenue to Route 2 near Miraflores. (b) Route 2 near Orange County Hospital to Main Street, Santa Ana, via Santa Ana Boulevard.\\" In 1934, Route 166, except on Indiana Street, was marked as part of Sign Route 6 (which continued along Route 171 to Buena Park), and the entire length of Route 174 became Sign Route 10.H.M.

The connection between Routes 166 and 174 was made via Route 168 (Rosemead Boulevard, then and now SR 19). This resulted in SR 10 being truncated further, to the intersection of Firestone and Rosemead Boulevards, though SR 26 continued to extend east on Routes 166 and 171 to Buena Park.H.M.

Originally it was signed as US 101 before the segment of 101 between the East Los Angeles Interchange and the United States‚ÄìMexico border in San Ysidro, California was decommissioned in favor of Interstate 5. It was approved as a chargeable interstate in 1961. The Santa Ana Freeway and also portions of San Diego Freeway (before the freeway was built) south of El Toro Y went up changing the U.S. 101 signs to Interstate 5 in 1964, including full length of Golden State Freeway which was originally signed as US 99. Former Interstate 105 From 1964 to 1968, the I-105 designation was used on a stretch of road linking I-5/I-10, US 101, and SR 10 (former I-110) north of downtown Los Angeles, now known as the East Los Angeles Interchange. In 1968, this I-105 was decommissioned, and that portion of the Santa Ana Freeway was folded into US 101.

The entire route is known as the northern segment of the San Diego Freeway. I-405 is a bypass auxiliary route of I-5, running along the southern and western parts of the Greater Los Angeles urban area from Irvine in the south to near San Fernando in the north. I-405 is a heavily traveled thoroughfare by both commuters and freight haulers along its entire length and is the busiest and most congested freeway in the United States.Santa Monica College Corsair News Article The freeway's annual average daily traffic between exits 21 and 22 in Seal Beach reached 374,000 in 2008, making it the highest count in the nation. It has played a crucial role in the development of dozens of cities and suburbs along its route through Los Angeles and Orange counties. It also serves Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Long Beach Airport (LGB) and Orange County's John Wayne Airport (SNA).  Route description = Orange County  The Bristol exit near South Coast Plaza and Segerstrom Center for the Arts, with Saddleback in the background I-405 begins at the El Toro Y interchange in southeastern Irvine in Orange County, splitting from its parent I-5 and inheriting that route's San Diego Freeway title; I-5 continues north as the Santa Ana Freeway. The freeway passes immediately south of the Irvine Spectrum Center mall before intersecting with State Route 133 (SR 133). It then continues through Irvine, passing north of UC Irvine and then along the northern boundary of John Wayne International Airport. After passing the airport, the freeway enters Costa Mesa and has an interchange with SR 55\\\\. It passes South Coast Plaza before a partial interchange with SR 73, which serves as a partially-tolled bypass of I-405 between Costa Mesa and Laguna Niguel. The freeway then travels through Fountain Valley and along the edges of Westminster and Huntington Beach before entering Seal Beach, where it begins to run concurrently with SR 22\\\\. It continues along the northern edge of Seal Beach, passing between Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach and Joint Forces Training Base Los Alamitos, before SR 22 splits from I-405 and continues west while the freeway turns north. I-405 then intersects the southern end of I-605 before crossing the San Gabriel River and entering Los Angeles County.  Los Angeles County  I-405 enters Los Angeles County in the city of Long Beach. It passes to the north of California State University, Long Beach and then along the south of Long Beach Airport. The freeway then intersects with I-710 before entering Carson, where it meets I-110. It also passes near California State University, Dominguez Hills and Dignity Health Sports Park, home of Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy. After leaving Carson, I-405 briefly enters the city of Los Angeles by passing through the Harbor Gateway, a strip of land connecting San Pedro to the rest of the city. The freeway then continues to roughly parallel the contour of the coastline as it passes through the South Bay communities of Torrance, Lawndale, Redondo Beach, Hawthorne, and El Segundo. The freeway then encounters I-105 on the southeastern corner of LAX. It passes to the east of the airport, serving it with exits at Imperial Highway and Century Boulevard. I-405 next passes through Inglewood, coming near the site of SoFi Stadium, future home to the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League. It then passes through Westchester and Culver City where it meets SR 90, the Marina Freeway. It serves the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Mar Vista and West Los Angeles while passing a few miles east of Santa Monica, intersecting with I-10 in the process. The freeway continues into Westwood, passing just to the west of UCLA. It then passes the Getty Center as it ascends the Sepulveda Pass through the Santa Monica Mountains. I-405 near the interchange with the Ventura Freeway (U.S. Route 101) After cresting the mountains, I-405 descends into the San Fernando Valley, intersecting U.S. Route 101 (US 101) in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles. The freeway then continues due north through the western part of the valley, passing east of Van Nuys Airport and California State University, Northridge. It intersects SR 118 in the Mission Hills area before ending in a merge with I-5 near San Fernando. I-405 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The freeway is known as the San Diego Freeway, and parts of it are less commonly known as the Sepulveda Freeway (after Sepulveda Boulevard).  Traffic congestion  I-405 in the Sepulveda Pass The freeway's congestion problems are legendary, leading to jokes that the road was numbered 405 because traffic moves at \\"four or five\\" miles per hour, or because drivers had spent \\"four or five\\" hours to travel anywhere. Indeed, average speeds as low as are routinely recorded during morning and afternoon commutes, and its interchanges with the Ventura Freeway (US 101) and with the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10) each consistently rank among the five most congested freeway interchanges in the United States. As a result of these congestion problems, delays passing through the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area using this bypass route instead of merely using the primary route I-5 through Downtown may be present. Of the major reasons for the excessively heavy traffic on the freeway, I-405 is the only major north‚Äìsouth freeway in the densely populated areas between West Los Angeles and Downtown, crossing the Santa Monica Mountains and connecting San Fernando Valley and the Los Angeles basin. Another parallel freeway is proposed to connect the Valley and the LA basin (the Laurel Canyon Freeway or La Cienega Freeway), but has faced upper class home-owner opposition. Despite four years of construction disruptions, billions of dollars of public money, LA Times commentary claims traffic with the lane expansions is actually just as bad or worse. History 1955 map of the planned Interstates in the Los Angeles area; present-day I-405 roughly corresponds to the 1955 proposed route through the western regions of the area. Marilyn Reece and Carol Schumaker, at the Reece-designed I-10/I-405 interchange, 1964 I-405 was approved as a chargeable Interstate (in other words, an Interstate financed with federal funds) in 1955. Construction began in 1957 with the first section, mostly north of LAX Airport, completed in 1961 (signed as SR 7) followed by sections west of I-605 within the following few years. The highway was renumbered to I-405 during the 1964 renumbering. The final section covering most of Orange County opened in 1969. Construction required the already existing Mulholland Highway to be re-routed to the south along a new bridge, the Mulholland Drive Bridge, to span I-405. \\"Carmageddon\\" A section of I-405 was closed over the weekend of Friday, July 15, 2011 as part of the Sepulveda Pass Improvements Project. Before the closing, local radio DJs and television newscasts referred to it as \\"Carmageddon\\" and \\"Carpocalypse\\", parodying the notion of Armageddon and the Apocalypse, since it was anticipated that the closure would severely impact traffic. In reality, traffic was lighter than normal across a wide area. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) reported that fewer vehicles used the roads than usual, and those who did travel by road arrived more quickly than on a normal weekend. The Metrolink commuter train system recorded its highest-ever weekend ridership since it began operating in 1991. Ridership was 50% higher than the same weekend in 2010, and 10% higher than the previous weekend ridership record, which occurred during the U2 360¬∞ Tour in June 2011. In response to jetBlue Airlines' offer of special flights between Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and Long Beach Airport, a distance of only , for $4, a group of cyclists did the same journey in one and a half hours, compared to two and a half hours by plane (including a drive to the airport from West Hollywood 90 minutes in advance of the flight and travel time to the end destination). There was also some debate about whether the Los Angeles area could benefit from car-free weekends regularly. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority had full closure of a stretch of I-405 on the weekend of September 29‚Äì30, 2012, while construction crews worked to demolish a portion of the Mulholland Bridge. Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles used the closure of I-405 to study particulate matter air pollution. The researchers took air samples before, during, and after the closure. The researchers found an 83% reduction in ultrafine particles, 55% reduction in fine particle matter, and 62% less black carbon. Sepulveda Pass Improvements Project The $1 billion Sepulveda Pass Improvements Project added a high-occupancy vehicle lane and associated changes to freeway entrances, exits, and underpasses along a 10-mile stretch through the Sepulveda Pass between I-10 and U.S. 101/Ventura Boulevard. The project was completed as a design-build in contrast to the traditional design-bid-build used typically in infrastructure improvement. This section of I-405 was closed for a weekend in mid-July 2011 to demolish the Mulholland Drive Bridge, and a section was closed for the last weekend of September 2012. Jamzilla was the name for the I-405 closure on President's Day Weekend 2014. There were lane closures and complete closures on I-405 starting February 14 at 10 p.m. until February 18 at 6 a.m. to pave and re-stripe the northbound lanes. On May 23, 2014, the high-occupancy vehicle lane was opened to traffic. Future Aerial view from the north of Interstate 405's interchange with I-105 near Los Angeles International Airport from directly above Arbor Vitae Street; the hills of the Palos Verdes Peninsula are visible in the distance. Manchester and Century Boulevard interchanges Proposed changes between the Manchester and Century Boulevard interchanges in the City of Inglewood are to provide a new southbound on-ramp and a new northbound off-ramp for Arbor Vitae Street, to reconstruct and widened the Arbor Vitae Street over-bridge and replace the Century Boulevard overcrossing structure. This work would reduce congestion on the approach to LAX. The California Department of Transportation has not yet issued a start date for this work. Orange County The Orange County Transportation Authority is currently preparing the design plans to add a High-occupancy toll (HOT) express lane and one mixed flow lane in each direction between SR 73 in Costa Mesa and I-605 in Seal Beach. The I-405 Improvement Project is starting construction in 2018 and is scheduled to be completed in 2023. Incidents=UCLA protest, 1966 Following the 1966 UCLA‚ÄìUSC rivalry football game, USC was voted into the Rose Bowl despite the UCLA team's having defeated the Trojans‚Äîwith both teams having only one loss during the season. UCLA students protested by blocking the freeway's northbound lanes at Wilshire Boulevard. O.J. Simpson chase, 1994 While dangerous high-speed chases along the San Diego Freeway are not uncommon, perhaps the most famous chase in its history was also one of the slowest. On the afternoon of June 17, 1994, former athlete and actor O.J. Simpson, who was accused of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman, took to the freeway in a white Ford Bronco (driven by former teammate Al Cowlings) with police in pursuit. A widely televised low-speed chase ensued and ended hours later when Simpson returned to his Brentwood, Los Angeles, home and surrendered to law enforcement. Ennis Cosby murder, 1997 Ennis Cosby, the only son of Bill Cosby, was murdered along I-405 in Los Angeles on January 16, 1997, while fixing a flat tire. Sherman Oaks truck crash, 2019 On March 10, 2019, the portion of I-405 between the Ventura Freeway (US 101) and Burbank Boulevard in the Sherman Oaks area was closed in both directions as a propane tanker truck carrying more than of flammable gas overturned along the southbound lanes of I-405. No explosion resulted from the incident. In popular culture I-405 was the location for the short film 405. The Swedish rock band Europe's song \\"California 405\\" is featured on their 2015 studio album War of Kings. Chuck Lorre used an end-of-show vanity card in 2013 to berate workers on the Interstate for their apparent lack of progress after five years. The Jimmy Eat World song \\"If You Don't, Don't\\", from the album Bleed America includes the line \\"Don't you know I'm thinking (know I'm thinking), driving 405 past midnight\\". The Death Cab for Cutie song \\"405\\" on their second studio album, We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes, may be incorrectly associated with California's I-405. The song is actually referring to I-405 in Seattle, as the band is from Bellingham.As told in track nine of their iTunes Originals Album The song \\"Drive\\" on Halsey's 2015 album Badlands uses the story of a reckless drive on the I-405 to frame its relatively unstructured lyrics.

These minerals form as a result of alteration which occurs when hydrothermal fluids interact with a protolith of either igneous or sedimentary origin. In many cases, skarns are associated with the intrusion of a granitic pluton found in and around faults or shear zones that intrude into a carbonate layer composed of either dolomite or limestone. Skarns can form by regional, or contact metamorphism and therefore form in relatively high temperature environments. The hydrothermal fluids associated with the metasomatic processes can originate from either magmatic, metamorphic, meteoric, marine, or even a mix of these. The resulting skarn may consist of a variety of different minerals which are highly dependent on the original composition of both the hydrothermal fluid and the original composition of the protolith. If a skarn has a respectable amount of ore mineralization that can be mined for a profit, it can therefore be classified as a skarn deposit. Etymology Skarn is an old Swedish mining term originally used to describe a type of silicate gangue, or waste rock, associated with iron-ore bearing sulfide deposits apparently replacing Palaeoproterozoic age limestones in Sweden's Persberg mining district.Burt, D. M., (19770. Mineralogy and Petrology of Skarn Deposits: Societa Italiana di Mineralogia e Petrologia, 33 (2), 859-873. Petrology Skarns are composed of calcium-iron-magnesium-manganese-aluminum silicate minerals. Skarn deposits are economically valuable as sources of metals such as tin, tungsten, manganese, copper, gold, zinc, lead, nickel, molybdenum and iron. A skarn is formed by a variety of metasomatic processes during metamorphism between two adjacent lithologic units. Skarn can form in almost any lithology type such as shale, granite and basalt but the majority of skarns are found in lithology containing a limestone or a dolomite. It is common to find skarns near plutons, along faults and major shear zones, in shallow geothermal systems, and on the bottom of the sea floor. The mineralogy of skarn is highly related to the protolith. Skarn minerals are mainly garnets and pyroxene with a wide variety of calc-silicate and associated minerals. Typical skarn minerals include pyroxene, garnet, idocrase, wollastonite, actinolite, magnetite or hematite, epidote and scapolite. Because skarns are formed from incompatible-element rich, siliceous aqueous fluids a variety of uncommon mineral types are found in the skarn environment, such as: tourmaline, topaz, beryl, corundum, fluorite, apatite, barite, strontianite, tantalite, anglesite, and others. Classification Skarns can be subdivided depending on specific criteria: One way to classify a skarn, is by its protolith. If the protolith is of sedimentary origin, it can be referred to as an exoskarn and if the protolith is igneous, it can be called an endoskarn. Further classification can be made based on the protolith by observing the skarns dominant composition and the resulting alteration assemblage. If the skarn contains minerals such as olivine, serpentine, phlogopite, magnesium clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, spinel, pargasite, and minerals from the humite group, are characteristic of a dolomitic protolith and can be classed as a magnesian skarn. The other class, called calcic skarns, are the replacement products of a limestone protolith with dominant mineral assemblages containing garnet, clinopyroxene, and wollastonite. Rocks that contain garnet or pyroxene as major phases, are fine-grained, lack iron, and have skarn-like appearances, are generally given the term skarnoid. Skarnoid therefore is the intermediate stage of a fine-grained hornfels and a coarse-grained skarn. Skarn deposits have typical skarn gangue minerals but also contain ore minerals in abundance which are of economic importance. Skarn deposits are therefore classified by their dominant economic element, such as copper (Cu) skarn deposit, or molybdenum (Mo) skarn deposit to name a few. Fe (Cu, Ag, Au) skarn deposits The tectonic setting for calcic Fe skarns tends to be the oceanic island arcs. The host rocks tend to be gabbros to syenite associated with intruding limestone. The tectonic setting for magnesium Fe skarns tends to be the continental margin. The host rocks tend to be granodiorite to granite associated with intruding dolomite and dolomitic sedimentary rocks. Magnetite is the principal ore in these types of skarn deposits which its grade yields from 40 to 60 %. Chalcopyrite, bornite and pyrite are the minor ores. Cu (Au, Ag, Mo, W) skarn deposits The tectonic setting for Cu deposits tends to be the Andean-type plutons intruding older continental-margin carbonate layers. The host rocks tend to be quartz diorite and granodiorite. Pyrite, chalcopyrite and magnetite are typically found in higher abundances. Formation Generally, there are two types of skarns that form, exoskarns and endoskarns. Exoskarns are more common and form on the outside of an intrusive body that comes into contact with a carbonate unit. They are formed when fluids left over from the crystallisation of the intrusion are ejected from the mass at the waning stages of emplacement. When these fluids come into contact with reactive rocks, usually carbonates such as limestone or dolomite, the fluids react with them, producing alteration (infiltration metasomatism). Endoskarns form within the intrusive body where fracturing, cooling joints, and stockworks have been produced, which results in a permeable area. The permeable area can incorporate material from the carbonate layer. The magmatic hydrothermal fluids that were transported or created by the intrusion interact with the carbonate material and form the endoskarn. Endoskarns are considered to be rare. Both the composition and the textures of protolith strongly play a role in the formation of the resulting skarn. Reaction skarn is formed from isochemical metamorphism occurring on thinly interlayered sedimentary lithology units that involves a small scale (perhaps centimetres) metasomatic transfer of components between adjacent units.Zarayskiy, G.P., Zharikov, V.A., Stoyanovskaya, F.M., and Balashov, V.N., 1987, The Experimental Study Of Bimetasomatic Skarn Formation: International Geology Review, v. 29, p. 761-858 Skarnoid is a calc-silicate rock that is fine-grained and iron poor. It lies between hornfels and coarse-grained skarn.Korzhinskii, D.S., 1948, Petrology of the Tur'insk skarn deposits of copper: Academy nauk SSSR, Institute of Geology Nauk Trudy, vvp. 68, Ser. Rundnykh Mestorozhdenii, No. 10, 147p.Zharikov, V. A., 1970: Skarns. - Int. Geol. Rev.12,541-559,619-647,760-775. Skarnoid tends to reflect the composition of the protolith. Most large skarn deposits experience a transition from early metamorphism‚Äîwhich forms hornfels, reaction skarns, and skarnoids‚Äîto late metamorphism, which forms relatively coarser grained, ore-bearing skarns. The magma intrusion triggers contact metamorphism in the region where sedimentary rocks are present, and forms hornfels as a result. The recrystallization and phase change of hornfels reflects the composition of the protolith. After the formation of hornfels, a process called metasomatism occurs which involves hydrothermal fluids associated with magmatic, metamorphic, marine, meteoric or even a mix of these. This process is called isochemical metamorphism, and can result in the production of a wide range of calc-silicate minerals that form in impure lithology units and along fluid boundaries where small-scale metasomatism occurs (argillite and limestone, and banded iron formation). The skarn deposits that are considered economically important for containing valuable metals are a result of large-scale metasomatism, where the composition of fluid controls the skarn and its ore mineralogy. They are relatively coarser grained and do not reflect the composition of protolith or surrounding rocks. Uncommon types of skarns are formed in contact with sulfidic or carbonaceous rocks such as black shales, graphite shales, banded iron formations and, occasionally, salt or evaporites. Here, fluids react less via chemical exchange of ions, but because of the redox-oxidation potential of the wall rocks. Ore deposits The major dominant economic metals that make up skarn deposits are copper, tungsten, iron, tin, molybdenum, zinc-lead, and gold. Other minor economic minerals include uranium, silver, boron, fluorine, and rare-earth elements. Some examples of the major economic skarn deposits are *(Note; some of these are currently being mined or have been mined in the past): * Iron skarns: Dashkesan Mine, Azerbaijan * Copper skarns: Bingham Canyon Mine, Utah, U.S.A * Tungsten skarns: Sangdong mine, South Korea * Gold- bearing skarns: Hedley Mascot Mine, British Columbia, Canada * Zinc-lead skarns: Santa Eulalia, Chihuahua, Mexico * Nickel skarns: Avebury Mine, Zeehan, Tasmania (Australia) * Molybdenum skarns: Yangchiachangtze mine, China See also * References * External links Category:Metamorphic rocks ","title":"Skarn"},{"id":"467423","text":"\\"May you live in interesting times\\" is an English expression that purports to be a translation of a traditional Chinese curse. While seemingly a blessing, the expression is normally used ironically; life is better in \\"uninteresting times\\" of peace and tranquility than in \\"interesting\\" ones, which are usually times of trouble. Despite being so common in English as to be known as the \\"Chinese curse\\", the saying is apocryphal, and no actual Chinese source has ever been produced. The most likely connection to Chinese culture may be deduced from analysis of the late-19th-century speeches of Joseph Chamberlain, probably erroneously transmitted and revised through his son Austen Chamberlain. Origins Despite being widely attributed as a Chinese curse, there is no known equivalent expression in Chinese.Bryan W. Van Norden. Introduction to Classical Chinese Philosophy. (Indianapolis: Hackett, 2011; ), p. 53, sourcing Fred R. Shapiro, ed., The Yale Book of Quotations (New Haven: Yale University Press 2006), p. 669. The nearest related Chinese expression translates as \\"Better to be a dog in times of tranquility than a human in times of chaos.\\" ()May you live in interesting times, The Grammarphobia Blog The expression originates from Volume 3 of the 1627 short story collection by Feng Menglong, Stories to Awaken the World. Evidence that the phrase was in use as early as 1936 is provided in a memoir written by Hughe Knatchbull- Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China in 1936 and 1937, and published in 1949. He mentions that before he left England for China in 1936, a friend told him of a Chinese curse, \\"May you live in interesting times.\\" Frederic Ren√© Coudert Jr. also recounts having heard the phrase at the time: > Some years ago, in 1936, I had to write to a very dear and honoured friend > of mine, who has since died, Sir Austen Chamberlain, brother of the present > Prime Minister, and I concluded my letter with a rather banal remark \\"that > we were living in an interesting age\\". Evidently he read the whole letter, > because by return mail he wrote to me and concluded as follows: \\"Many years > ago I learned from one of our diplomats in China that one of the principal > Chinese curses heaped upon an enemy is, 'May you live in an interesting age. > \\"Surely\\", he said, \\"no age has been more fraught with insecurity than our > own present time.\\" That was three years ago. \\"Chamberlain curse\\" theory Research by philologist Garson O'Toole shows a probable origin in the mind of Austen Chamberlain's father Joseph Chamberlain dating around the late-19th and early 20th centuries. Specifically, O'Toole cites the following statement Joseph made during a speech in 1898: > I think that you will all agree that we are living in most interesting > times. (Hear, hear.) I never remember myself a time in which our history was > so full, in which day by day brought us new objects of interest, and, let me > say also, new objects for anxiety. (Hear, hear.) [emphasis added] Over time, the Chamberlain family may have come to believe that the elder Chamberlain had not used his own phrase, but had repeated a phrase from Chinese. The phrase is again described as a \\"Chinese curse\\" in an article published in Child Study: A Journal of Parent Education in 1943.

Griffiths, Pearson Education, Dorling Kindersley, 2007, :\\\\- \\\\mathbf{E} = abla V + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\mathbf{A}}{\\\\partial t}\\\\,! where is the electromagnetic vector potential. This last potential expression in fact reduces Faraday's law to an identity. Fluid mechanics In fluid mechanics, the velocity field describes the fluid motion. An irrotational flow means the velocity field is conservative, or equivalently the vorticity pseudovector field is zero: : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} = abla\\\\times\\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\boldsymbol{0}. This allows the velocity potential to be defined simply as: : \\\\mathbf{v} = abla\\\\phi Chemistry In an electrochemical half-cell, at the interface between the electrolyte (an ionic solution) and the metal electrode, the standard electric potential difference is:Physical chemistry, P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1978, :\\\\Delta \\\\phi_{(M,M^{+z})} = \\\\Delta \\\\phi_{(M,M^{+z})}^{\\\\ominus} + \\\\frac{RT}{zeN_\\\\text{A}}\\\\ln a_{M^{+z}} \\\\,! where R = gas constant, T = temperature of solution, z = valency of the metal, e = elementary charge, NA = Avogadro constant, and aM+z is the activity of the ions in solution. Quantities with superscript ‚äñ denote the measurement is taken under standard conditions. The potential gradient is relatively abrupt, since there is an almost definite boundary between the metal and solution, hence the interface term. Biology In biology, a potential gradient is the net difference in electric charge across a cell membrane. Non-uniqueness of potentials Since gradients in potentials correspond to physical fields, it makes no difference if a constant is added on (it is erased by the gradient operator which includes partial differentiation). This means there is no way to tell what the \\"absolute value\\" of the potential \\"is\\" ‚Äì the zero value of potential is completely arbitrary and can be chosen anywhere by convenience (even \\"at infinity\\"). This idea also applies to vector potentials, and is exploited in classical field theory and also gauge field theory. Absolute values of potentials are not physically observable, only gradients and path- dependent potential differences are. However, the Aharonov‚ÄìBohm effect is a quantum mechanical effect which illustrates that non-zero electromagnetic potentials along a closed loop (even when the and fields are zero everywhere in the region) lead to changes in the phase of the wave function of an electrically charged particle in the region, so the potentials appear to have measurable significance. Potential theory Field equations, such as Gauss's laws for electricity, for magnetism, and for gravity, can be written in the form: : abla\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{F}= X \\\\rho where is the electric charge density, monopole density (should they exist), or mass density and is a constant (in terms of physical constants , , and other numerical factors). Scalar potential gradients lead to Poisson's equation: : abla\\\\cdot ( abla\\\\phi)= X \\\\rho \\\\quad \\\\Rightarrow \\\\quad abla^2 \\\\phi = X \\\\rho A general theory of potentials has been developed to solve this equation for the potential. The gradient of that solution gives the physical field, solving the field equation.

It runs along the west shore of the San Francisco Bay, connecting San Jose with San Francisco. Within the city of San Francisco, the freeway is also known as James Lick Freeway, named after the California philanthropist. The road was originally built as a surface road, the Bayshore Highway, and later upgraded to freeway standards. Before 1964, it was mostly marked as U.S. Route 101 Bypass, with US 101 using the present State Route 82 (El Camino Real). Route description The Bayshore Freeway begins at the Blossom Hill Road interchange on US 101. The freeway curves north and northwest, bypassing downtown San Jose to the east, and then curves west-northwest, crossing I-880 and SR 87, the latter just north of the San Jose International Airport. The portion of the highway from San Jose to South San Francisco is relatively straight and flat, running near the west edge of the San Francisco Bay. Junctions here include SR 237 in Sunnyvale, SR 85 in Mountain View, SR 84 in Menlo Park and Redwood City, SR 92 in San Mateo, and the San Francisco International Airport and I-380 in San Bruno. In South San Francisco, the freeway curves northeast around San Bruno Mountain, crossing its east edge at Sierra Point, and then heads north on a causeway across the former Candlestick Cove to the San Francisco city line.Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed January 2008 via ACME Mapper San Francisco Skyway over Third Street In San Francisco, where the road is also known as the James Lick Freeway, it continues north-northwesterly between Bayview Park and McLaren Park, and crosses I-280 at the Alemany Maze. There it curves north-northeasterly around Bernal Heights and then northwest around Potrero Hill, meeting the Central Freeway at the border between the Mission District and South of Market. The Bayshore Freeway ends at the intersection of US 101 and Interstate 80,http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf which, although signed as Interstate 80, is not officially Interstate 80 until the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. The freeway that goes from US 101 to the Bay Bridge that is signed as I-80 but not officially I-80 is called the San Francisco Skyway. History=Initial construction Before the Dumbarton and San Mateo-Hayward Bridges were built across the San Francisco Bay in the 1920s, San Francisco was bottled up at the north end of a long peninsula, with driving south on El Camino Real towards San Jose as the only reasonable alternative to the ferries for crossing the bay. The first of several highways built as an alternate to El Camino Real was the Skyline Boulevard, which was added to the state highway system in 1919. A second route, the Bay Shore Highway (Route 68: \\"Route 68 is the Bay Shore Highway from San Francisco to San Jose. This route includes the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge and the approaches thereto on the San Francisco end...\\"), became a state highway in 1923, but only from the San Francisco city limits into San Mateo County, where the Dumbarton Bridge would begin.: \\"from the county line separating the city and county of San Francisco from the county of San Mateo, in, to and through the county of San Mateo, at such location or locations as the said California highway commission may select.\\" Just prior to the start of construction on the Dumbarton Bridge, San Francisco Supervisor Richard J. Welch noted that the Bay Shore Highway would need to be built all the way to San Jose as an escape valve for the additional traffic that the bridge would attract.Mel Scott, The San Francisco Bay Area: A Metropolis in Perspective, University of California Press, 1959, pp. 174, 183, 209-210, 215 Groundbreaking ceremonies were held in South San Francisco for the Bayshore Highway on September 11, 1924. The route used a right-of-way that was wide with a four-lane undivided highway wide. Sierra Point cut in Brisbane, 1929. The road crosses over Tunnel 5 of the Bayshore Cutoff rail line. The state legislature extended the highway in 1925, defining it to run from near the intersection of Army Street (Cesar Chavez Street) and San Bruno Avenue in San Francisco to a point in San Jose. The governor approved the bill with the stipulation that only the portion between the city limits of San Francisco and San Jose would be a state highway. Construction between South San Francisco and Burlingame had begun by 1924, funded by a $500,000 contribution from San Francisco, and was completed in 1928. A disconnected segment north of San Mateo was built by the state at the same time. It was not until February 1929 that the road was fully paved between San Francisco and Burlingame, and on October 20, 1929 the new highway was officially dedicated to San Mateo,Los Angeles Times, Desert Replaces Ocean and Mountains in Hearts of Those Who Roam in Motor Cars, October 20, 1929, p. 1Lawrence Kinnaird, History of the Greater San Francisco Bay Region, Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1966, pp. 243-245 several months after the connecting San Mateo-Hayward Bridge opened (at what is now Third AvenueRand McNally & Company, san Francisco & Vicinity , 1933).The New York Times, Coolidge Opens Big Bridge, March 3, 1929, p.

One segment of the so-called \\"Bloody Bayshore\\" was \\"Boneyard Hill\\", a steep grade through the Visitacion Valley near the San Francisco city line, running past a bone meal plant. Causes of the crashes included turning conflicts at intersections, and speeding drivers crossing the centerline to use the oncoming lanes as a passing lane.Paul D. Buchanan, San Mateo Daily Journal, History traces the bayshore from highway to freeway, April 15, 2002Matt Bowling, Palo Alto Daily News, Then and Now: The 'Bloody Bayshore', May 20, 2007 (Archived from the original on June 21, 2008) The roadway was entirely at-grade except for crossings of rail lines. It generally followed the present alignment of the Bayshore Freeway, but deviated in several places: Old Bayshore Highway in San Jose, Veterans Boulevard in Redwood City, Bayshore Highway in Burlingame, a destroyed section of road through San Francisco International Airport, and Airport and Bayshore Boulevards from South San Francisco through Brisbane into San Francisco. Within that city, the new highway continued three miles (5 km) along the present Bay Shore Boulevard to Army (Cesar Chavez) Street and Potrero Avenue.United States Geological Survey, San Jose (1942) , Palo Alto (1940) , Hayward (1942) , San Mateo (1939) , and San Francisco (1942) (scale 1:62500) The four-lane Bayshore Highway When the Bayshore Highway was completed in 1937, U.S. Route 101 signs were moved to it from El Camino Real, and El Camino became U.S. Route 101 Alternate. Businesses along El Camino created the El Camino Real Association to protest the move and resulting loss of business,San Mateo Times, Camino Robbed of Auto Traffic by Plot, Claim, December 23, 1937 and by 1939 the main route had been moved back, with the Bayshore Highway becoming U.S. Route 101 Bypass.Oakland Tribune, October 1, 1939: \\"The Pacheco Pass road, a good connection between coast and inland routes, is reached over pavement via U.S. 101 or U.S. 101 Bypass to San Jose...\\" The two routes split in San Jose at the junction of First and Second Streets near Keyes Street, with the El Camino route mostly following the present SR 82 and the Bayshore route using locally maintained Second, Reed, and Fourth Streets to reach the state-maintained Bayshore Highway.H.M. Gousha Company, San Jose , 1942 In San Francisco, they rejoined at the present location of the Alemany Maze, with the El Camino route following Alemany Boulevard from near the city line; from there US 101 continued north on Bay Shore Boulevard, Potrero Avenue, and 10th and Fell Streets to Van Ness Avenue, meeting the Bay Bridge approach (US 40/US 50) at Bryant and Harrison Streets.H.M.

The state legislature authorized an extension beyond San Jose back to El Camino Real near Ford Road in 1947,: \\"Route 68 is the Bayshore Highway from San Francisco to Route 2 near Ford Road south of San Jose.\\" which was already under construction, and was completed that year.California Department of Transportation, Index to California Highways and Public Works, 1937-1967, June 1997, pp. 104, 107, 109 This was the first segment built with interchanges, and included a median barrier. Despite this, most crossings were at-grade; only the two ends at Route 115 (Santa Clara Street) and regular US 101 included bridges, the former a diamond interchange and the latter a simple split with additional access to Ford Road. It also crossed over Coyote Road, though with no access, just south of the Coyote Creek bridge.United States Geological Survey, San Jose (scale 1:62500) , 1953 The original 1947 bridge over Coyote Road remains, though widened in 1990, and is one of the oldest road-road grade separations on the present freeway. Reconstruction Bayshore Freeway at Hillsdale Boulevard in 2014 The Bayshore Highway through San Francisco and San Mateo counties was considered complete in 1940, at the dawn of the freeway era; that year, the California Department of Public Works announced plans to convert the Bayshore Highway into a six-lane divided freeway between San Francisco and Palo Alto.Oakland Tribune, Bayshore Speed Road Discussed, July 26, 1940 It was the first freeway planned for Northern California, and the second in the state, after the Arroyo Seco project. In general, the goals of the Bayshore Freeway project were to grade-separate the freeway from surface streets and railroad tracks to accommodate projected traffic and to reduce the rate of accidents. At the time, it was anticipated that traffic along the San Francisco Peninsula would reach the capacity of both El Camino Real and the Bayshore Highway within ten years. In addition, the accident rate along the Bayshore Highway was 2.9 per million vehicle miles, compared with the state-wide average of 1.4; current traffic on the Bayshore Highway was estimated at 30,000 vehicles per day and in 1939 alone, there were 276 accidents, resulting in 19 fatalities and 235 injuries. Twenty years later in 1959, the accident rate on the new Bayshore Freeway had dropped to 0.75 per million vehicle miles, carrying 59,000 vehicles per day. Bayshore Freeway (center of picture) in South San Francisco and Oyster Point, looking west (2010); Sign Hill and San Bruno Mountain are in the background The first segment rebuilt as a modern freeway was finished in 1947, stretching from Peninsula Avenue (then called Peninsular) at the San Mateo-Burlingame line to Broadway Avenue in Burlingame, including the overpass for Peninsula. Contracts in 1948 and 1949 extended the freeway north to South San Francisco, a distance of . This segment converted the existing two-way traffic on Bayshore Highway to a single three-lane one-way road and added a new three-lane roadway running parallel to it. The new roadway, intended for northbound traffic, was constructed east of the existing alignment, separated by a wide median, permitting a future expansion to four lanes in each direction. This six-lane freeway followed the existing highway to Broadway in Burlingame, but then took a more inland alignment past the airport at Mills Field (now SFO), and crossed the old road at South San Francisco, running just east of it to near the south end of the cut at Sierra Point.United States Geological Survey, San Mateo (1949) , Montara Mountain (1949) , and San Francisco South (1947) (scale 1:24000) The routing had been adjusted to the west to allow an additional for airport expansion. Since this segment was being constructed on predominantly marshy land, of fill was taken from the arm of San Bruno Mountain that extended into the water as Sierra Point; the hill was essentially levelled and the remaining fill was used for airport expansion. Construction began in San Francisco in 1950 on a segment north from Augusta to 25th at a contracted cost of $6.5 million, including the cost of the right-of-way (about half the total) and grade separations over Alemany and Army. This segment opened on June 1, 1951. Also in 1951, the state legislature renamed the portion within San Francisco after James Lick, a California pioneer and philanthropist. San Francisco construction included segments to the north, opened in 1953, and the south. The connection to the upper deck of the Bay Bridge opened in June 1955.California Highways July-August 1955 Construction in San Francisco was completed by 1958. Candlestick Hill in San Francisco (2013), showing US 101 over the 1957 causeway. San Bruno Mountain and Sierra Point are in the background. The area west (right) of the freeway is part of the proposed Brisbane Baylands development. A new causeway across Candlestick Cove connected the completed section in South San Francisco with San Francisco and opened on July 11, 1957. Planning began in 1951, when bids were taken for an experimental causeway wide extending south from Candlestick Point; rather than pumping out soft bay mud and back-filling with sand, fill dirt would be dumped directly into the Bay to see if the mud underneath could be displaced instead. This section of the Bay had water up to deep, overlying soft mud deep, which in turn was overlying harder, compacted mud. The compacted mud was deemed sufficiently strong to support the weight of the freeway, but it was hoped that excavation of the soft mud layer could be avoided by dumping fill at a sufficient rate, later calculated to be per day. The experiment was deemed a success, and the remaining of causeway was put out for bid in 1954, awarded in 1955 to Guy F. Atkinson Co. By that time, over of fill had already been placed. Meanwhile construction had progressed south from San Mateo through San Carlos, with that segment completed in 1954, and continuing on into Redwood City (Marsh Road relocation, July 1958), Menlo Park (Willow Road Interchange, 1956), and Palo Alto (June 1958). A movement to make the four-lane undivided \\"Bloody Bayshore\\" safer all the way to San Jose began in Palo Alto. As a temporary measure, the state lowered the speed limit, installed traffic signals, closed minor crossroads, and prohibited left turns in places. The community convinced the state to extend the six-lane freeway.MPO Productions, Freedom of the American Road, 1955 Contracts for the projects in Santa Clara County had been awarded by 1959, and the Bayshore Freeway was completed to San Jose in 1962, officially opening on February 2 of that year. The total cost of freeway conversion was , including to acquire right-of-way. The south end of the freeway was the old El Camino Real merge near Ford Road until the early 1980s, when the South Valley Freeway was built.

It is the principal route through the Cahuenga Pass, the primary shortcut between the Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley. It is considered one of the most important freeways in the history of Los Angeles and instrumental in the development of the San Fernando Valley. It is the second oldest freeway in Los Angeles (after the Arroyo Seco Parkway). From its southern end at the Four Level Interchange to its intersection with the Ventura Freeway in the southeastern San Fernando Valley (the Hollywood Split), it is signed as part of U.S. Route 101. It is then signed as State Route 170 (SR 170) north to its terminus at the Golden State Freeway (Interstate 5). Route description Southbound approaching Hollywood Boulevard First segment built of the Hollywood Freeway through the Cahuenga Pass; Pacific Electric Railway trolleys ran down the center median of this freeway until 1952 Hollywood freeway through the Cahuenga Pass in 1972 left The freeway runs from the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles to the Golden State Freeway in the Sun Valley district of Los Angeles in the San Fernando Valley. From the Four Level Interchange to its intersection with the Ventura Freeway in the southeastern San Fernando Valley (also known as the Hollywood Split), the freeway is signed as part of U.S. Route 101. Afterwards, it is signed as State Route 170 until its northern terminus at Interstate 5. The intersection of the Hollywood and Pasadena Freeways, known as the Four Level Interchange, is one of the major landmarks in Los Angeles and a symbol of the city's post-World War II development. California State Route 170 SR 170 begins its northbound route at the junction with the Ventura Freeway, continuing the freeway northwards. US 101 leaves the freeway, merging onto the Ventura Freeway and heads west. SR 134 continues the Ventura Freeway, heading east. On the southbound side, a sign indicates \\"END Route 170\\". Curiously, there is no interchange from SR 134 West to US 101 South. This connector route was put on hold pending the construction of the Laurel Canyon Freeway, which never came to fruition. Motorists intending to go in that direction must exit SR 134 at Cahuenga Boulevard, make a left, continue on Lankershim Blvd. and follow the signs near Universal Studios to re-enter on US 101. Likewise, there is no interchange from US 101 North to SR 134 East. Motorists intending to go in that direction must exit US 101 at Vineland Ave., make a right, make another right on Riverside Dr. and enter SR 134 on the left. This interchange is also known as the \\"Hollywood Split\\". SR 170 then continues through the northeastern portion of the San Fernando Valley, finally merging onto northbound I-5. There is no connector route to I-5 South because the angle between the two freeways is too acute. There are HOV lanes in operation 24 hours a day in each direction of SR-170 between I-5 and the Hollywood Split interchange. There is a direct connection from the northbound SR-170 HOV lanes onto the northbound I-5 HOV lanes, as well as from the southbound I-5 HOV lanes onto the southbound SR-170 HOV lanes. This makes it possible to connect with the I-5 HOV lanes as well as the SR-14 HOV lanes (from the I-5) without merging into regular lanes. Both this portion of US 101 and the entirety of SR 170 are part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. As of 2018, Caltrans is planning to add soundwalls to SR-170 in both directions between Sherman Way and the Hollywood Split. There are currently some neighborhoods located near the freeway, which cause noise pollution. Now that soundwalls are in place, it can reduce the noise and reduces smog. History Plans for the Hollywood Freeway officially began in 1924 when Los Angeles voters approved a \\"stop-free express highway\\" between Downtown Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. The first segment of the Hollywood Freeway built was a one and a half mile stretch through the Cahuenga Pass. That segment opened on June 15, 1940. It was then known as the \\"Cahuenga Pass Freeway\\". Pacific Electric Railway trolleys ran down the center of this freeway until 1952. The next section of the freeway that stretched from the San Fernando Valley to Downtown Los Angeles opened on April 16, 1954 at a cost of $55 million. The final section, north of the Ventura Freeway to the Golden State Freeway was completed in 1968. A year after the Hollywood Freeway opened, it was used by an average of 183,000 vehicles a day, almost double the capacity it was designed to carry. Actor Bob Hope called it the \\"biggest parking lot in the world\\" in his routine. The segment through Hollywood was the first to be built through a heavily populated area and requiring the moving or demolition of many buildings, including Rudolph Valentino's former home in Whitley Heights. The freeway was also designed to curve around KTTV Studios and Hollywood Presbyterian Church. Much of the rubble and debris from the buildings removed for the freeway's construction was dumped into Ch√°vez Ravine, the current home to Dodger Stadium. In 1967, the Hollywood Freeway was the first freeway in California that had ramp meters. Near the Vermont Avenue exit, there's a seemingly over-wide center strip now filled with trees. This is where the never-built Beverly Hills Freeway was to merge with the Hollywood Freeway. Plans for the Beverly Hills Freeway were halted in the 1970s. The Hollywood Freeway is an expansion of the original Cahuenga Parkway, a short six-lane freeway that ran through the Cahuenga Pass between Hollywood and Studio City. The Cahuenga Parkway featured Pacific Electric Railway \\"Red Car\\" tracks in its median, but by the 1950s these tracks were out of service due to radical reductions in Red Car service. The Pacific Electric right-of-way later accommodated an additional lane in each direction. The second location of Los Angeles High School was in the path of the freeway. The school moved to its third and current location in 1917. The school buildings were converted into a school for boys with truancy problems until 1948, when it was demolished to make way for the freeway.\\"Problem Boys All Won't Be Sent to Belmont High School.\\" Los Angeles Times. Sep. 3, 1948. p. A 1 SR 170 was originally supposed to run from the I-5 interchange to I-405 near the Los Angeles International Airport as the Laurel Canyon Freeway under the Laurel Canyon Boulevard, Crescent Heights Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard alignments of today. In fact, much of La Cienega Blvd. between Manchester Avenue and Venice Blvd. was constructed to freeway standards, with several grade-separated interchanges, although it is now an expressway maintained by Los Angeles County. California's legislature has relinquished state control of the segment of SR 170 along Highland Avenue, and thus that portion is now maintained by the City of Los Angeles.

During events at the Rose Bowl, the freeway's eastern portions often resemble a parking lot. The east-west geographical alignment of the Ventura Freeway and the overall north-south (Washington-to-California) designation of U.S. 101 on freeway signs can be confusing to visitors; the same freeway entrance can often be signed as \\"101 North\\" and \\"101 West\\"; this is most common in the San Fernando Valley.Total Traffic LA 101 NORTH (WEST) AT WINNETKA IN WOODLAND HILLS CLOSED DUE TO AN OVERTURNED SUV (note 101 NORTH (WEST)) Both the SR 134 and US 101 portions of the freeway are part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. California State Route 134 The SR 134 portion of the Ventura Freeway at the western edge of Burbank, California looking west from N Pass Ave. The Ventura Freeway crosses the Los Angeles River at its confluence with Verdugo Wash Westbound SR 134 near I-5 in Glendale. The road is the main connector from the San Fernando Valley and points north to the San Gabriel Valley and points east. The future Interstate 710 dead-ends at California Blvd and is signed as State Route 710. Residents of South Pasadena have blocked efforts to extend Interstate 710 north to California Boulevard from its current end at Valley Boulevard north of Interstate 10 near the Alhambra/Los Angeles city limit. Signs on SR 134 and I-210 refer to the SR 710 stub in Pasadena as TO State Route 110, because exiting left from the SR 710 stub onto California Blvd and turning right on Arroyo Parkway leads directly to SR 110, which is Pasadena's only direct freeway link to Downtown Los Angeles. The Interstate 5 offramp at Colorado Street is old SR 134, and there are still mileposts that refer to it as such. Old SR 134 followed Colorado Street through Glendale and Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock to the ramp connecting Colorado Boulevard and Figueroa Street to the Ventura Freeway. Old SR 134 continued onto the ramp and then onto what is now the Ventura Freeway to Orange Grove Boulevard in Pasadena. The Colorado Boulevard/Figueroa Street ramps and the segment of freeway between the ramps and just east of Orange Grove Boulevard used to be known as the Colorado Freeway. History=History of State Route 134 A pre-freeway alignment of State Route 134 originated at U.S. Route 101 (Ventura Boulevard) and Fulton Avenue in Los Angeles, then along Fulton, Moorpark Street, Riverside Drive and Alameda Avenue before meeting up with U.S. 6/99 (San Fernando Road) in Burbank. It traveled along San Fernando Road to Colorado Street, then ran along Colorado Street (portions of which have been renamed Eagle Vista Drive) through Glendale, Eagle Rock and Pasadena before terminating at U.S. Route 66. The alignment was later cut back to terminate in Studio City at Lankershim and Ventura. The Interstate 5 off-ramp at Colorado Street is actually a former routing of SR 134, and there are still mileposts that refer to it as such. Old SR 134 followed Colorado Street through Glendale and Colorado Boulevard in Eagle Rock to the ramp connecting Colorado Boulevard and Figueroa Street to the Ventura Freeway. Old SR 134 continued onto the ramp and then onto what is presently the Ventura Freeway to Orange Grove Boulevard in Pasadena. The Colorado Boulevard/Figueroa Street ramps plus the segment of freeway between the ramps and just east of Orange Grove Boulevard were previously known as the Colorado Freeway. From 1964 to 1992, the Colorado Boulevard portions of Route 134 were renumbered as California State Route 248. Legal definitions Sign marking the \\"Screaming Eagles Highway\\" The official Ventura Freeway designation is Routes 101 and 134 from Route 5 to the Santa Barbara County line. This does not include the portion of Route 134 between Route 5 and Route 210 even though local usage extends the name over this portion of freeway. At the freeway's eastern terminus with Interstate 210 in Pasadena, highway signs indicate \\"Ventura\\" as the destination direction for Route 134. The interchange of SR 134 and I-5 is officially the \\"Gene Autry Memorial Interchange\\", after the Singing cowboy superstar Gene Autry. Autry's Museum of the American West is located near the interchange in Griffith Park. Assembly Concurrent Resolution 54, Chapter 85 in 2003 also designated Route 101 in Ventura County as the \\"Screaming Eagles Highway\\".Ib. at 76 This honors the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army, which formed on July 23, 1918 and has been involved in every major war that the United States has participated in since then. The California Legislature passed a resolution in 2017 to designate the easternmost segment of the SR 134 freeway between SR 2 and its terminus at I-210 as the \\"President Barack H. Obama Highway\\", in honor of the 44th U.S. President Barack Obama, who had attended Occidental College in Eagle Rock from 1979 to 1981. Signs were posted on December 20, 2018. Proposed Bus Rapid Transit Route Ventura Freeway currently carries the Los Angeles Metro express bus route 501 between Pasadena and North Hollywood. Portions of SR 134 are also being considered as part of a Bus Rapid Transit project. Exit list This exit list proceeds from east to west, since the majority of the freeway is the north-south US 101.

It was first made available as an arcade game but was subsequently offered for a number of home gaming platforms. The game is considered a precursor to the tower defense genre. Overview In Rampart, the player is in control of a set of castles, which they must defend, by alternately shooting at attacking ships (or other players), and repairing any damage done to them within a time limit. Surrounding this castle is a wall, made up of small blocks, completely surrounding a region of the board. This area is considered the player's territory, and it may contain one or more castles, and any number of cannons. The maintenance of this territory is the primary focus of the game. Once the player defeats the opponent, the player can execute the commander, by walking the plank or beheading. Gameplay The single-player game consists of six levels. The ultimate aim is to destroy a fleet of attacking ships while repairing any damage the fort sustains. At the start of each level, the player chooses the location of their fort from a number of options. This location is then surrounded by a wall to form a castle, which the player can then place cannons within. After this, an attacking round commences, followed by a repair round, where any damage to the castle must be repaired. If the player manages to survive the repair phase (by surrounding at least one castle within a time limit), they are given a short amount of time to place additional cannons within the walls of his fort (if space is available), after which the battle resumes. This cycle continues until either the player fails a repair round, or enough ships in the enemy's fleet are sunk. When the opposing navy has been sufficiently depleted, the level is won, and the player may then choose another level from the island map. Place Cannons After starting a new game or after a successful repair round, the player may gain extra cannons (the number depending on the number of castles captured) to be placed in their territory. In the SNES and PC versions only, the cannons gained can also be converted into powerups: :*The Balloon floats at the beginning of phase 1 to the most powerful enemy ship (for singleplayer) or cannon (for multiplayer) and converts it to the player side for the successive fighting round. :*The Supercannon is bigger than the usual cannons and fire red projectiles, which sink any ship in one hit or leave a permanent fire if they hit the landscape Prepare for Battle The 'battle' phase In an attacking round, the player and enemy ships fire at each other using their respective cannons. The player can sink the enemy ships, while the enemy can destroy parts of the player's perimeter. Enemy ships move around while they fire, making it necessary to lead your target like in Missile Command. Ships come in three types: * Single-sailed ships shoot at your walls and move around, but do little else. It takes two shots to sink one. * Double-sailed ships require three hits to sink, and if they reach the shore they deposit grunts, small tank-like objects that multiply and move around during the repair phase. They can be shot with cannons and destroyed by surrounding them with walls, but they tend to get in the way and are capable of destroying castles if left unchecked. Grunts adjacent to walls during battle can destroy them to get inside a player's area. (In some home versions of the game, placing a wall on top of a house also creates a grunt.) * Red ships require 5 hits to sink, and their shots leave fiery craters whenever they strike a wall. These craters must be built around during the repair phase, and each persists for three rounds. (Some home versions make this a random number of rounds.) Later levels feature \\"dark\\" versions of each of these ships, which are each capable of taking one additional hit before sinking. Build and Repair In the repair round, the player must repair the damage done to the wall surrounding their territory. They are presented with a random series of polyomino shapes, and must place them on the island within a time limit to keep their castles surrounded by walls. While superficially similar to Tetris shapes, these pieces have much greater variety, ranging from 1 by 1 squares that can fit almost anywhere to big plus and U-shapes. The pieces do not fall, but may be moved freely around the screen and placed in any spot but they cannot be placed on top of existing objects (walls, water, castles, cannons, grunts, craters, or the edge of the board). Pieces cannot be passed, they must be placed down before getting the next one. At the start of the Repair phase, any territory that is not surrounded by a complete, unbroken wall is lost. By placing wall pieces, the player attempts to \\"capture\\" territory by completing a wall around it. Before the timer expires, the player must have completed a wall around at least one castle (which may or may not be the original, \\"home\\" castle) to survive the round and continue playing. It is also advantageous to capture previously- placed cannons, as only cannons within the player's territory may be used in the subsequent battle phase. Multiplayer When playing with two or three players the game is similar, except that instead of fighting against enemy ships, the players each have their own area of land separated by a river, and they shoot at each other's walls. In multiplayer mode, cannons can be destroyed if they take enough hits, there are bonus squares that are worth extra points when captured, and there are no grunts or craters, but the game is otherwise similar. Players shoot at each other's walls during the Battle phase and try to make it difficult for them to survive the next repair round. If a player is unable to repair his wall, he must insert another credit to remain in the game, but cannot do so more than three times. The last player remaining is the winner. If all the players remain in the game for an operator-adjustable number of rounds, they engage in a \\"Final Battle\\" at the start of the last combat phase, and if there isn't a clear winner at the end of the following repair phase, the winner is determined based on score. Strategy Within Rampart each element of the game interacts with the others in subtle ways. It is generally easier to capture an unowned castle than repair the wall around a starting castle, but without the benefit of the home castle's cannons the player will have a tough time. Building close to the water will allow the player better aim, and to get more shots off during battle (each cannon may only have one cannonball in the air at once), but enemy ships will also get more shots and castles close to the water are more vulnerable to grunts. Building more cannons gives the player more shots in battle, but once placed cannons cannot be removed, and too many cannons can make it almost impossible to survive a repair phase. These tradeoffs give Rampart its charm but also make the game difficult to master.  Ports  Rampart has been ported to the SNES, Sega Master System, Mega Drive/Genesis, Atari Lynx, PC, Macintosh, Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST platforms, separate versions for Game Boy and Game Boy Color, and also separate versions for the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Famicom. MegaTech gave the Mega Drive version 90% and a Hyper Game Award, saying that it was a \\"superb blend of different game styles\\".MegaTech review, EMAP, issue 13 The NES, SNES and PC versions were all done by a group \\"Bitmasters\\", and the NES version was going to be published by Tengen (without a Nintendo license), but it switched publishing duties to Jaleco (which the company granted a Nintendo license), and the SNES and PC versions were published by Electronic Arts. The arcade version of Rampart is also included in the Midway Arcade Treasures compilation, available for the Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox and PlayStation Portable consoles, and the Midway Arcade Origins compilation, available for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/14/midway-arcade-origins-review It was also included with Gauntlet on the Game Boy Advance. Most of the home versions of Rampart change the game in non-trivial ways. The Japanese (NES) Famicom version, which was released by Konami, includes 7 training levels and 3 difficulty settings. It also features an extensive multiplayer mode for two people. Many options can be chosen, such as the number of cannons to start with and so on. There are also several open-source games based on the gameplay of Rampart, such as Kajaani Kombat and Castle Combat. A PlayStation 3 port was released on the PlayStation Network on May 10, 2007. This download is no longer available for purchase. Although it is mostly identical to the arcade version, it also supports internet multiplayer play. Games based on Rampart are also available for iOS devices, such as Hostile Tides.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Rampart on their June 1, 1991 issue as being the seventh most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Legacy Rampart influenced the first tower defense games around a decade later. Gameplay similarities include defending a territory by erecting defensive structures, and making repairs between multiple rounds of attacks.

Soviet forces under his command successfully repelled the Polish forces from Western Ukraine, driving them back to Poland, but the Red Army was defeated outside of Warsaw, and the war ended in Soviet defeat. He later served as chief of staff of the Red Army from 1925 through 1928, as assistant in the People's Commissariat of Defense after 1934 and as commander of the Volga Military District in 1937. He achieved the rank of Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1935. He was a major proponent of the modernization of Soviet armament and army force structure in the 1920s and 1930s and became instrumental in the development of Soviet aviation, mechanized, and airborne forces. As a theoretician, he was a driving force behind Soviet development of the theory of deep operations. The Soviet authorities accused him of treason and had him shot during Stalin's military purges of 1936‚Äì1938, but his reputation was rehabilitated in the late 1950s.Nikulin, Tukhachevsky: Biograficheskii ocherk [Tukhachevsky: A biographical essay] (Moskva: Voennoe Izdatel'stvo, 1964), 189-97.  Early years  Tukhachevsky family 1904 Tukhachevsky was born at Alexandrovskoye, Safonovsky District (in the present- day Smolensk Oblast of Russia), into a family of impoverished hereditary nobles.Simon Sebag Montefiore, Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar, page 252. Legend states that his family descended from a Flemish count who ended up stranded in the East during the Crusades and took a Turkish wife before settling in Russia.Norman Davies, White Eagle, Red Star: The Polish-Soviet War 1919-20, page 130.https://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/red- army/1937/wollenberg-red-army/ch03.htm His great-grandfather Alexander Tukhachevsky (1793‚Äì1831) served as a Colonel in the Imperial Russian Army. He was of Russian ethnicity. After attending the in 1912, he moved on to the , whence he graduated in 1914. World War I At the outset of the First World War he joined the Semyenovsky Guards Regiment (July 1914) as a Second Lieutenant, declaring: > I am convinced that all that is needed in order to achieve what I want is > bravery and self-confidence. I certainly have enough self-confidence.... I > told myself that I shall either be a general at thirty, or that I shall not > be alive by then.The Red Army - Page 111 - by Michel Berchin, Eliahu Ben- > Horin - 1942 Taken prisoner by the Imperial German Army in February 1915, Tukhachevsky escaped four times from prisoner-of-war camps and was finally held as an incorrigible escapee in Ingolstadt fortress in Bavaria.Weintraub, Stanley. A Stillness Heard Round the World. Truman Talley Books, 1985, p. 340  Prisoner in Ingolstadt  There he met Le Monde journalist Remy Roure and may have shared a cell with Captain Charles de Gaulle. Tukhachevsky played his violin, spouted nihilist beliefs and spoke against Jews, whom he called dogs who \\"spread their fleas throughout the world\\". The General: Charles De Gaulle and the France He Saved by Jonathan Fenby p68 Roure, under the pseudonym of Pierre Fervacque, wrote about his encounter with Tukhachevsky. He reported that Tukhachevsky highly praised Napoleon, and also in a certain conversation, Tukhachevsky said he hated jews for bringing Christianity and the \\"morality of capital\\" to Russia. Roure then asked him if he was a socialist, and he replied: According to Roure, Tukhachevsky said that he would only follow Lenin if he \\"de-europeanised and threw Russia into barbarism\\", but feared Lenin would not do that. After ranting about how he could use Marxism as a justification to secure the territorial aims of the Tsars and cement Russia's position as a world power, he laughed and said he was only joking. Roure said the laugh had an ironic and despairing tone. In another, different occasion, following the February Revolution, Roure observed Tukhachevsky carving a \\"scary idol from colored cardboard\\", with \\"burning eyes\\", a \\"gaping mouth\\", and a \\"bizarre and terrible nose\\". He inquired about its purpose, to which Tukhachevsky responded: Tukhachevsky's apparent neo-paganism was also corroborated by another prisoner at Ingolstadt, Nikolay Alexandrovich Tsurikov (ru), who recalled that he once saw a \\"scarecrow\\" in the corner of Tukhachevsky's cell, and upon asking him as to what it was, Tukhachevsky responded (to what Tsurikov interpreted as heavy sarcasm), that it was an effigy of Jarilo, which he had created during Shrovetide.Minakov, page 183. Tukhachevsky never denied, and later even confirmed, these stories about his prison in Germany, but always said that he was politically immature in 1917 and greatly regretted his early views. In France 1936, when confronted with what Roure wrote about him, he said that he had read his book and stated the following: > I was still very young... a novice at politics, and all I knew about > revolutions was the last phase of the citizens' revolution in France: the > Bonapartism whose military triumphs filled me with boundless admiration. > (...) I never think of my views at Ingolstadt without regretting them, since > they could cause doubts about my devotion to the Soviet motherland. I'm > taking advantage of our reunion to tell you my true feelings. Wether or not Tukhachevsky really gave up on his old views, the assertion he was a fully-fledged Bolshevik by the time he joined them is most probably not true. Tukhachevsky's fifth escape met with success, and after crossing the Swiss-German border, carrying in tow some small pagan idolsMinakov, page 183., he returned to Russia in September 1917. Following the October Revolution of 1917, Tukhachevsky joined the Bolsheviks and went on to play a key role in the Red Army - despite his noble ancestry. During the Civil War Tukhachevsky in 1920 He became an officer in the newly established Red Army and rapidly advanced in rank because of his great ability. During the Russian Civil War, he was given responsibility for defending Moscow. The Bolshevik Defence Commissar, Leon Trotsky, gave Tukhachevsky command of the 5th Army in 1919, and he led the campaign to capture Siberia from the anticommunist White forces of Aleksandr Kolchak. Tukhachevsky used concentrated attacks to exploit the enemy's open flanks and threaten them with envelopment. According to Tukhachevsky's close confidant Leonid Sabaneyev, in 1918, when he was in the service of the Military Department of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, in his last overt display of neopaganism, Tukhachevsky drew up a project for the destruction of Christianity and the restoration of Slavic paganism. To this end, Tukhachevsky submitted a memo on declaring paganism as the state religion of the RSFSR, which although mocked, also received some serious discussion in the Small Council of People's Commissars, which commended Tukhachevsky for his \\"joke\\" and his commitment to atheism. Sabaneyev observed that Tukhachevsky seemed \\"as happy as a schoolboy who had just succeeded in a prank.\\"Minakov, page 184. He also helped defeat General Anton Denikin in the Crimea in 1920, conducting the final operations. In February 1920, he launched an offensive into the Kuban, using cavalry to disrupt the enemy's rear. In the retreat that followed, Denikin's force disintegrated, and Novorossiysk was evacuated hastily. In the final stage of the civil war, Tukhachevsky commanded the 7th Army during the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921. He also commanded the assault against the Tambov Republic between 1921 and 1922. British historian Simon Sebag Montefiore has described Tukhachevsky as being \\"as ruthless as any Bolshevik\\".Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar, page 222. He was known for using summary execution of hostagesSuvorov, Viktor. The Chief Culprit: Stalin's Grand Design to Start World War II.

During the Polish-Soviet War Polish soldiers displaying captured Soviet battle flags after the Battle of Warsaw Tukhachevsky commanded the Soviet invasion of Poland during the Polish-Soviet War in 1920. In the leadup to hostilities, Tukhachevsky concentrated his troops near Vitebsk, which he theatrically dubbed, \\"The Gates of Smolensk\\". When he issued his troops orders to cross the border, Tukhachevsky said, \\"The fate of world revolution is being decided in the west: the way leads over the corpse of Poland to a universal conflagration.... On to Wilno, Minsk, and Warsaw -- forward!\\"Richard M. Watt (1979), Bitter Glory: Poland and Its Fate, 1918-1939, Simon & Schuster, New York. Page 126. According to Richard M. Watt, \\"The boldness of Tukhachevsky's drive westward was the key to his success. The Soviet High Command dispatched 60,000 men as reinforcements, but Tukhachevsky never stopped to let them catch up. His onrushing armies were leaving behind greater numbers of stragglers every day, but Tukhachevsky ignored these losses. His supply services were in chaos and his rear scarcely existed as an organized entity, but Tukhachevsky was unconcerned; his men would live off the land. On the day his troops captured Minsk, a new cry arose--'Give us Warsaw!' Tukhachevsky was determined to give them what they wanted. All things considered, Tukhachevsky's performance was a virtuoso display of energy, determination, and, indeed, rashness.\\"Watt (1979), page 128. His armies were defeated by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski outside Warsaw. It was during the Polish war that Tukhachevsky first came into conflict with Stalin. Both blamed the other for the Soviet failure to capture Warsaw. Tukhachevsky later lamented: His book about the war was translated into Polish and published together with a book by Pi≈Çsudski. Reform of the Red Army Tukhachevsky with the other first four Marshals of the Soviet Union in 1935. Only two would survive the Great Purge Tukhachevsky fervently criticised the Red Army‚Äôs performance during the 1926 Summer manoeuvres. He criticised the officers‚Äô inability to determine what course of action to take and communicate that with their troops especially harshly. Tukhachevsky noted that initiative among officers was lacking, that they responded slowly to changes in the situation and that communication was poor. This was not purely the officers‚Äô fault as the only way of communication from local unit headquarters to the field positions was a single telephone line. In contrast German divisions mobilised shortly after during the interwar period had telephones, radio, horse, cycle and motorcycle messengers, signal lights and flags and pieces of cloth with which messages were to be conveyed mostly to aircraft. Tukhachevsky reached the position of 1st deputy commissar for defence to commissar for defence Voroshilov. Voroshilov disliked Tukhachevsky and would later be one of the initiators of the great purge which wouldn‚Äôt benefit Tukhachevsky‚Äôs safety. According to Zhukov it was Tukhachevsky and not Voroshilov who ran the ministry in practice. While Voroshilov disliked Tukhachevsky his perception of military doctrine was nonetheless impacted significantly by Tukhachevsky‚Äôs ideas. According to Simon Sebag Montefiore, Stalin regarded Tukhachevsky as his bitterest rival and dubbed him Napoleonchik (little Napoleon).Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar, pages 221-222. Upon Stalin's ascension to Party leadership in 1929, he began receiving denunciations from senior officers who disapproved of Tukhachevsky's tactical theories. Then, in 1930, the Joint State Political Directorate forced two officers to testify that Tukhachevsky was plotting to overthrow the Politburo via a coup d'√©tat.Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar, page 58-59. According to Montefiore: Following this, Tukhachevsky wrote several books on modern warfare and, in 1931, after Stalin had accepted the need for an industrialized military, Tukhachevsky was given a leading role in reforming the army. He held advanced ideas on military strategy, particularly on the use of tanks and aircraft in combined operations. Tukhachevsky took a keen interest in the arts, and became a political patron and close friend of composer Dmitri Shostakovich; they met in 1925Elizabeth Wilson, Shostakovich: a Life Remembered, p. 39. and subsequently played music together at the Marshal's home (Tukhachevsky played the violin). In 1936, Shostakovich's music was under attack following the Pravda denunciation of his opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk. However, Tukhachevsky intervened with Stalin on his friend's behalf. After Tukhachevsky's arrest, pressure was put on Shostakovich to denounce him, but he was saved from doing so by the fact that the investigator was himself arrested.Elizabeth Wilson, pp. 124-5. Theory of deep operation Tukhachevsky in 1936 Tukhachevsky is often credited with the theory of deep operation in which combined arms formations strike deep behind enemy lines to destroy the enemy's rear and logistics,Richard Simpkin in association with John Erickson Deep battle: the brainchild of Marshal Tukhachevskii, London, Brassey's Defence, 1987 Alexander Vasilevsky The Case of All My Life (–î–µ–ª–æ –≤—Å–µ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏). 3d ed. –ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç, 1978 Chapter8 but his exact role is unclear and disputed because of shortage of firsthand sources, and his published works containing only limited amounts of theory on the subject. The theories were opposed by some in the military establishmentJohn Erickson The Soviet High Command: A Military-Political History, 1918‚Äì1941, Routledge, 2001. but were largely adopted by the Red Army in the mid-1930s. They were expressed as a concept in the Red Army's Field Regulations of 1929 and more fully developed in 1935's Instructions on Deep Battle. The concept was finally codified into the army in 1936 in the Provisional Field Regulations of 1936. An early example of the potential effectiveness of deep operations can be found in the Soviet victory over Japan at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan), where a Soviet Corps under the command of Georgy Zhukov defeated a substantial Japanese force in August and September 1939. It is often stated that the widespread purges of the Red Army officer corps in 1937 to 1939 made \\"deep operations\\" briefly fall from favour. However, they were certainly a major part of Soviet doctrine after their efficiency was demonstrated by the Battle of Khalkin Gol and the success of similar German operations in Poland and France. They were used with great success during World War II on the Eastern Front, in such victories as the Battle of Stalingrad and Operation Bagration. Fall Tukhachevsky at the Warsaw Railway Station, en route to London, 1936 On November 20, 1935, Tukhachevsky was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union when he was 42. In January 1936, Tukhachevsky visited the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Just before his arrest, Tukhachevsky was relieved of duty as assistant to Marshal Kliment Voroshilov and appointed military commander of the Volga Military District.Fyodor Mikhailovich Sergeyev, Tainye operatsii natsistskoi razvediki, 1933-1945 (In Russian). Moscow: Politizdat, 1991. : p.18 Shortly after departing to take up his new command, he was secretly arrested on May 22, 1937, and brought back to Moscow in a prison van.Barmine, Alexander, One Who Survived, New York: G. P. Putnam (1945), pp. 7-8 Tukhachevsky's interrogation and torture were directly supervised by NKVD Chief Nikolai Yezhov. Stalin instructed Yezhov, \\"See for yourself, but Tukhachevsky should be forced to tell everything.... It's impossible he acted alone.\\"Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar, page 222. According to Montefiore, a few days later, as Yezhov buzzed in and out of Stalin's office, a broken Tukhachevsky confessed that Avel Yenukidze had recruited him in 1928 and that he was a German agent in cahoots with Nikolai Bukharin to seize power. Tukhachevsky's confession, which survives in the archives, is dappled with a brown spray that was later found to be blood-spattered by a body in motion.Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar, page 223. Tukhachevsky's bloodstained confession Stalin commented, \\"It's incredible, but it's a fact, they admit it.\\" On June 11, 1937, the Soviet Supreme Court convened a special military tribunal to try Tukhachevsky and eight Generals for treason. The trial was dubbed the Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization. Upon hearing the accusations, Tukhachevsky was heard to say, \\"I feel I'm dreaming.\\"Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar, page 225. Most of the judges were also terrified. One was heard to comment, \\"Tomorrow I'll be put in the same place.\\" At 11:35 that night, all of the defendants were declared guilty and sentenced to death. Stalin, who was awaiting the verdict with Molotov, Kaganovich and Yezhov, did not even examine the transcripts. He simply said, \\"Agreed.\\" Within the hour, Tukhachevsky was summoned from his cell by NKVD captain Vasili Blokhin. As Yezhov watched, the former Marshal was shot once in the back of the head.Donald Rayfield, Donald (2005). Stalin and His Hangmen: the tyrant and those who killed for him. Random House. pp. 322‚Äì325. Immediately afterward, Yezhov was summoned into Stalin's presence. Stalin asked, \\"What were Tukhachevsky's last words?\\" Yezhov responded, \\"The snake said he was dedicated to the Motherland and Comrade Stalin. He asked for clemency. But it was obvious that he was not being straight, he hadn't laid down his arms.\\" Aftermath A 1963 Soviet stamp featuring Tukhachevsky Tukhachevsky's family members all suffered after his execution. His wife, Nina Tukhachevskaya, and his brothers Alexandr and Nikolai, both instructors in a Soviet military academy, were all shot. Three of his sisters were sent to the Gulag. His underage daughter was arrested when she reached adulthood and remained in the Gulag until the 1950s Khrushchev thaw. She lived in Moscow after her release and died in 1982.Sergeyev (1991): p.44 In his 1941 book, I paid Hitler, Fritz Thyssen claimed that members of the German military, especially Werner Von Fritsch, contacted and tried to form an alliance with Tukhachevsky and that he wanted to remove Stalin from power. No evidence has surfaced that corroborates this. Although there was a Polish newspaper at the time that reported that a document from Fritsch had been seized from Tukhachevsky. Before Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech in 1956, Tukhachevsky was officially considered a fascist and fifth columnist. Soviet diplomats and supporters in the West enthusiastically promulgated this opinion. Then, on January 31, 1957, Tukhachevsky and his codefendants were declared innocent of all charges and were rehabilitated. Although Tukhachevsky's prosecution is almost universally regarded as a sham, Stalin's motivations continue to be debated. In his 1968 book The Great Terror, British historian Robert Conquest accuses Nazi Party leaders Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich of forging documents that implicated Tukhachevsky in an anti-Stalinist conspiracy with the Wehrmacht General Staff, to weaken the Soviet Union's defence capacity. These documents, Conquest said, were leaked to President Edvard Bene≈° of Czechoslovakia, who passed them to Soviet Russia through diplomatic channels. Conquest's thesis of an SS conspiracy to frame Tukhachevsky was based upon the memoirs of Walter Schellenberg and Bene≈°.Lukes, Igor, Czechoslovakia Between Stalin and Hitler: The Diplomacy of Edvard Bene≈° in the 1930s, Oxford University Press (1996), , , p. 95 In 1989, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union announced that new evidence had been found in Stalin's archives indicating German intelligence's intentions to fabricate disinformation about Tukhachevsky with the goal of eliminating him. \\"Knowledge of personal characteristics of Stalin - like paranoia and extreme suspicion, had been possibly highest factor in it.\\"Sergeyev (1991): p. 3 According to the opinion of Igor Lukes, who conducted a study on the matter, it was Stalin, Kaganovich and Yezhov who actually concocted Tukhachevsky's \\"treason\\" themselves. At Yezhov's order, the NKVD had instructed a known double agent, Nikolai Skoblin, to leak to Heydrich's Sicherheitsdienst (SD) concocted information suggesting a plot by Tukhachevsky and the other Soviet generals against Stalin. Seeing an opportunity to strike a blow at the Soviet military, Heydrich immediately acted on the information and undertook to improve on it. Heydrich's forgeries were later leaked to the Soviets via Bene≈° and other neutral nations. While the SD believed that it had successfully fooled Stalin into executing his best generals, in reality, it had merely served as an unwitting pawn of the Soviet NKVD. Ironically, Heydrich's forgeries were never used at trial. Instead, Soviet prosecutors relied on signed \\"confessions\\" beaten out of the defendants. In 1956, NKVD defector Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov published an article in Life Magazine with \\"The Sensational Secret Behind the Damnation of Stalin\\" as title. The story held that NKVD agents had discovered papers in the tsarist Okhrana archives proving Stalin had once been an informer. From this knowledge, the NKVD agents had planned a coup d'√©tat with Tukhachevsky and other senior officers in the Red Army.Roman Brackman The secret file of Joseph Stalin: a hidden life 466 pp. Published by Routledge, 2001 According to Orlov, Stalin uncovered the conspiracy and used Yezhov to execute those responsible.Paul W. Blackstock \\"The Tukhachevsky Affair\\" Russian Review, Vol. 28, No. 2 (Apr., 1969), pp. 171‚Äì190 The article lists the Eremin letter as documentary evidence that Stalin was part of the Okhrana, but most historians agree it's a forgery. Montefiore, who has conducted extensive research in Soviet archives, states: According to Montefiore, Stalin had always known that the Red Army was the only institution that could have resisted his quest for absolute power. Stalin's paranoia about internal subversion and belief in his own infallible ability to detect traitors did the rest. Stalin and Yezhov orchestrated the arrest and execution of thousands of Soviet military officers after Tukhachevsky was shot. Ultimately, five of the eight generals who presided over Tukhachevsky's \\"trial\\" were arrested and shot by the NKVD.Barmine, Alexander, One Who Survived, New York: G.P. Putnam (1945), p. 322 According to Montefiore, Stalin's close friend and confidant Kaganovich later joked, \\"Tukhachevsky hid Napoleon's baton in his rucksack.\\" While at the time of his death the Red Army was still firmly in the grip of the cavalry Tukhachevsky had changed the Red Army‚Äôs mentality quite significantly. While many machinists were being arrested and marshal Budyonny spoke in favour of cavalry influential people, even including the less intelligent marshal Voroshilov, under who Tukhachevsky served and who took part in the arrests, began to question the cavalry‚Äôs position inside the Red Army. The horse did remain ingrained in the Red Army however. In peacetime cavalry made sense to the Red Army, it was effective in smaller actions and internal security actions, many horse riders were available without requiring significant training and there were the memories of the effectiveness of cavalry during the Civil War, all of which helped the horse in maintaining its central position inside the Red Army. When the Second World War began mixed units were set up which included both cavalry and tanks, these played a central role in use of the deep operations doctrine during WWII.

Located in the Glacier Peak Wilderness in Mount Baker‚ÄìSnoqualmie National Forest, the volcano is visible from the west in Seattle, and from the north in the higher areas of eastern suburbs of Vancouver such as Coquitlam, New Westminster and Port Coquitlam. The volcano is the fourth tallest peak in Washington state, and not as much is known about it compared to other volcanoes in the area. Local Native Americans have recognized Glacier Peak and other Washington volcanoes in their histories and stories. When American explorers reached the region, they learned basic information about surrounding landforms, but did not initially understand that Glacier Peak was a volcano. Positioned in Snohomish County, the volcano is only northeast of Downtown Seattle. From locations in northern Seattle and northward, Glacier Peak is closer than the more famous Mount Rainier, but as Glacier Peak is set farther into the Cascades and almost shorter, it is much less noticeable than Mount Rainier. Glacier Peak is one of the most active of Washington's volcanoes. The volcano formed during the Pleistocene epoch, about one million years ago, and since the most recent ice age, it has produced some of largest and most explosive eruptions in the state. When continental ice sheets retreated from the region, Glacier Peak began to erupt regularly, erupting explosively five times in the past 3,000 years. It has erupted repeatedly during at least six periods; two of these eruptions have been among the largest in Washington.  Geology  Remnants of past, prehistoric lava domes are main components of the summit of the volcano, in addition to its false summit, Disappointment Peak. Past pyroclastic flow deposits are easily visible in river valleys near the volcano, likely caused by lava dome collapse, along with ridges found east of the summit consisting of ash cloud remains. On its western flank, the volcano also has a lahar, or mudflow deposit, which runs for about into the White Chuck River Valley around 14,000 years ago. Ten other pyroclastic flow deposits are visible, all identified as relatively 10,000 years old. There is also a considerably newer mudflow, about 5,500 years old, which covers an area of between the same river valley, along with two small incidents both under 3,000 years old. Another lahar, of unidentified age, was rich in oxyhornblende dacite; and continued for into the Sauk River. There are also ash cloud deposits on the opposite eastern flank of the volcano. Studies of the mountain have to date been unable to find any correspondence with pyroclastic flows, but several past mudflows have been identified. In the Dusty Creek, located by the mountain, there is a lahar at least thick, containing pyroclastic flow deposits and other mudflows. However, this large mudflow is part of a thick concentration of past incidents at the volcano that spans the Dusty and Chocolate Creek. In the area at least ten cubic kilometers of lithic debris are contained. Tephra deposits are for the most part constrained to the left flank of the volcano, and at least nine past incidents have been identified. These form several layers of tephra constructing the mountain. Smaller eruptions involving tephra occurred between 6,900‚Äì5,500 years ago, 3,450‚Äì200 years ago, and as recent as 316‚Äì90 years ago. On the mountain, about up, are three additional cinder cones ‚Äî one at the head of White Chuck River, one at Dishpan Gap, and one near Indian Pass. The volcano has also caused thermal events such as hot springs. There were three hot springs on the mountain: Gamma, Kennedy, and Sulphur, but Kennedy Hot Springs was destroyed and buried in a slide.  Tectonic setting  Diagram of plate tectonics for Cascade Range The volcano is located in Washington, and is one of the five major stratovolcanoes there. Situated in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, the volcano was created by subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca Plate under the North American Plate. Convergence between the two continues at a rate of per year. This range has been volcanically active for about 36 million years, and the rocks that make up its volcanoes are between 55 and 42 million years old. Eruptions within the range are irregular and do not occur all at once. In an attempt to organize the volcanoes by age, scientists typically divide them into the High Cascades, younger volcanoes, and the Western Cascades, consisting of the older volcanoes. However, the vents in Washington are all of different ages so none of its volcanoes are included in either of the sections.  History  Around the area, there were many Native Americans, and along with other Washington volcanoes, the mountain was recognized by them as a spirit. When European-American explorers reached the area, they learned about the mountain, though only partially, through local legends. Although the local people described Glacier Peak as a vital part of their storytelling and beliefs; when other volcanoes in the area were mapped, Glacier Peak was left out. In 1850 natives mentioned the volcano to naturalist George Gibbs saying that the volcano had once \\"smoked\\". In 1898 the volcano was finally documented on a map. Native Americans also used the area around the Cascades for their agriculture, leading them to often congregate in the region. As a result, gold miners eventually reached the area in the 1870s‚Äì1890s, searching for resources and rich land. The first white man recorded to observe the mountain‚ÄîDaniel Lindsley‚Äîwas an employee of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company searching for possible railroad routes when he saw it in 1870.  Eruptive history  Despite its elevation of , Glacier Peak is a small stratovolcano. Its relatively high summit is a consequence of its location atop a high ridge, but its volcanic portion extends only above the underlying ridge. Another Cascade Arc volcano with similar geomorphology is the Mount Meager massif in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, which is situated on a ridge of nonvolcanic, crystalline and metamorphic rock. View from Liberty Cap across the Suiattle River Valley Of the five major volcanoes in Washington, only Glacier Peak and Mount St. Helens have had large eruptions in the past 15,000 years. Since both volcanoes generate magma of dacitic origin, the viscous magma builds up since it cannot flow through the eruptive vent. Gradually, the pressure grows, culminating in an explosion that ejects materials such as tephra, which in its simplest form, is ash. Tephrochronology and radiocarbon dating indicate that Glacier Peak eruptions occurred in 1700 AD ¬± 100 years, 1300 AD ¬± 300 years, 900 AD ¬± 50 years, 200 AD ¬± 50 years, 850 BC, 3150 BC, and in 3550 BC. The Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) for three of these was 2 to 4, small compared to the 5 of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. They were characterized mainly by a central vent eruption, followed by an explosive eruption. These eruptions varied in outcome; some produced lahars, some pyroclastic flows, and others lava domes. A little more than 13,000 years ago, a sequence of nine tephra eruptions occurred within a period of less than a few hundred years. Associated with these eruptions were pyroclastic flows. Mixed with snow, ice and water, these formed lahars that raced into three nearby rivers, filling their valleys with deep deposits. Subsequently, the mudflows drained into both the North Fork of the Stillaguamish River (at that time an outlet of the Sauk River) and Skagit Rivers. In Arlington, downstream, lahars deposited seven feet of sediment. Subsequent erosion of lahar deposits near Darrington led to the current river system with the Stillaguamish River separated from the Sauk/Skagit Rivers. Lahar debris was deposited along both the Skagit and Stillaguamish Rivers all the way to Puget Sound. A small portion of the erupted tephra was deposited locally. However, most of the tephra reached higher levels of the atmosphere, and was transported by the wind hundreds of miles. Deposits from this congregation were as thick as near Chelan and near Missoula, Montana. Glacier Peak from the southeast Since these events, Glacier Peak has produced several lahars. The largest events were 5,900 and 1,800 years ago and were associated with dome-building eruptions. In both cases, the lahars traveled down the Skagit River to Puget Sound.  Hazards  The risk of an eruption in any given year is currently estimated as 1 in 1,000. When lahars reach populated areas, they can bury structures and people. An example was the Armero tragedy at Nevado del Ruiz where 23,000 died from an enormous mudflow. Lahars from Glacier Peak pose a similar threat to the small communities of Darrington and Concrete and a lesser threat to the larger and rapidly growing towns of Mount Vernon and Burlington, as well as other communities along the lower Skagit and Stillaguamish Rivers. A 2005 study conducted by the United States Geological Survey identified nine Cascade volcanoes, including Glacier Peak, as \\"very- high-threat volcanoes with inadequate monitoring\\". At the time of the study, only one seismometer was installed on Glacier Peak that had not \\"worked in two years\\".  Glaciers  View of the northeast face from Image Lake Eleven significant glaciers cover Glacier Peak. When C.E. Rusk first saw these glaciers in 1906 they were beginning to retreat, but were still very advanced. The average retreat of Glacier Peak glaciers from the Little Ice Age to the 1958 positions was . Richard Hubley noted that North Cascade glaciers began to advance in the early 1950s, after 30 years of rapid retreat. The advance was in response to a sharp rise in winter precipitation and a decline in summer temperature beginning in 1944. Ten of the fifteen glaciers around Glacier Peak advanced, including all of the glaciers directly on the mountain's slopes. Advances of Glacier Peak glaciers ranged from and culminated in 1978. All eleven Glacier Peak glaciers that advanced during the 1950‚Äì79 period emplaced identifiable maximum advance terminal moraines. From 1984 to 2005, the average retreat of eight Glacier Peak glaciers from their recent maximum positions was . Milk Lake Glacier, on the north flank of the mountain, melted away altogether in the 1990s.  Recreation  The Pacific Crest Trail passes near Glacier Peak. The Suiattle River crossing is a well known feature on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) as it passes through the area. The Suiattle PCT crossing used to have a bridge crossing until it was flooded out by storms in late 2003. The first recorded person to climb the mountain was Thomas Gerdine, along with a group of United States Geological Survey scientists, Sam Strom, A. H. Dubor, and Darcy Bard, in 1897. The volcano is also available to skiers. To reach the mountain itself, it takes 5 miles of walking along the White Chuck River Trail (Forest Service Trail No. 643) and up the Sitkum Glacier. The trail is reached via Forest Service Road No. 23. Mainly, the slopes consist of black diamonds for both the ascent and descent.

In 2004 Yandarbiyev was assassinated while in exile in Qatar. An Islamist, he was perceived to be the most radical of the Chechen separatists, to the extant that Russian human rights activist Sergei Kovalev said that Aslan Maskhadov and even Shamil Basayev would be easier to negotiate with.Felix Corley (14 February 2004), \\"Obituaries: Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev\\", The Independent. Retrieved 16 May 2020. Life Originally a literary scholar, poet, and children's literature writer, Yandarbiyev became a leader in the Chechen nationalist movement as the Soviet Union began to collapse. In July 1989, he founded the Bart (Unity) Party, a democratic party that promoted the unity of Caucasian ethnic groups against \\"Russian imperialism\\". In May 1990, he founded and led the Vainakh Democratic Party (VDP), the first Chechen political party, which was committed to an independent Chechnya. The VDP initially represented both Chechen and Ingush until their split after Chechnya's declaration of independence from the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In November 1990 he became the deputy chairman of the newly formed All-National Congress of the Chechen People (NCChP), which was led by Dzhokhar Dudayev and which ousted the Soviet- era leadership. With Dudayev, he signed an agreement with Ingush leaders splitting the joint Chechen-Ingush republic in two. In the first Chechen parliament, from 1991‚Äì1993, Yandarbiyev headed the media committee. In April 1993 he was appointed as the Vice President of Ichkeria by Dudayev. In April 1996, following the assassination of his predecessor Dzhokhar Dudayev, he became the Acting President of Ichikeria. In late May 1996, Yandarbiyev headed a Chechen delegation that met President of Russia Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister of Russia Viktor Chernomyrdin for peace talks at the Kremlin that resulted in the signature of a ceasefire agreement on May 27, 1996. In 1997, during the signing of the Russian-Chechen Peace Treaty in Moscow, Yandarbiyev famously forced his Russian counterpart President Yeltsin to change seats at a negotiating table so he would be received like a head of sovereign state. Yandarbiyev stood in the presidential election held in Chechnya in February 1997, but was defeated by the Chechen separatist top military leader, General Aslan Maskhadov, getting 10 per cent of the votes and landing third behind Maskhadov and Shamil Basayev. Together with Maskhadov, Yandarbiyev took part of signing of the \\"lasting\\" peace treaty in Moscow. The two Chechen leaders fell out badly the following year, when Yandarbiyev was accused of being behind an assassination attempt against Maskhadov. In September 1998, Maskhadov publicly denounced Yandarbiyev, accusing him of importing the Islamic extremist philosophy of \\"Wahhabism\\" and of being responsible for \\"anti-state activities\\" including anti-government speeches and public meetings, as well as the organisation of illegal armed groups. Yandarbiyev subsequently joined forces with the hard-line Islamist opposition to Maskhadov's rule. In August‚ÄìSeptember 1999, Yandarbiyev was assumed as a key figure behind the invasion by the Islamic International Brigade-led coalition of Islamist guerrillas on the neighboring Russian Republic of Dagestan. At the beginning of the Second Chechen War, Yandarbiyev traveled abroad to Afghanistan, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates and eventually settled in Qatar in 1999, where he sought to obtain Muslim support for the Chechen cause. After being accused of involvement in the October 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis, Yandarbiyev was placed on Interpol's most wanted list and Russia made the first of several requests for extradition in February 2003, citing Yandarbiyev as a major international terrorist and financier of the al-Qaeda- backed Chechen resistance. In June 2003, his name was consequently added to the United Nations Security Council Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee's blacklist of al-Qaeda-related suspects. Yandarbiyev played a key role in directing funding from foundations in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf in order to support a radical Chechen faction dubbed the Special Purpose Islamic Regiment, a militant group responsible for the Moscow theater hostage crisis. In January 2004 he was interviewed extensively in Qatar for the BBC Four documentary The Smell of Paradise, where the film-makers called him the \\"spiritual leader of the Chechens and a poet on the road to jihad.\\" Assassination On February 13, 2004, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev was killed when a bomb ripped through his SUV in the Qatari capital, Doha. Yandarbiyev was fatally wounded and succumbed to his injuries on the way to the hospital.http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4261459/ns/world_news/t/ex-chechen- president-dies-blast/#.XpbYYsgzbDc retrieved= 15 March 2010 His 13-year-old son Daud was in critical condition. Some, but not all, reports said two of his bodyguards were killed in the blast as well, but this has not been confirmed.http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4261459/ns/world_news/t/ex-chechen- president-dies-blast/#.XpbYYsgzbDc retrieved= 15 March 2010 It was initially unclear who was responsible for the blast, but suspicion immediately fell on Russian intelligence agencies SVR and GRU, both of which denied any involvement, and cited internal feuding among the Chechen rebel leadership. Aslan Maskhadov's separatist foreign ministry condemned the attack as a \\"Russian terrorist attack\\", comparing it to the 1996 attack that killed Dzhokhar Dudayev. The car bomb eventually led to Qatar's first counter- terrorism law, declaring lethal terrorist acts punishable by death or life imprisonment. The day after the attack, Qatari authorities arrested three Russians in a Russian embassy villa. One of them, the first secretary of the Russian Embassy in Qatar, Aleksandr Fetisov, was released in March due to his diplomatic status. The remaining two, GRU agents Anatoly Yablochkov (also known as Belashkov) and Vasily Pugachyov (sometimes misspelled as Bogachyov), were charged with the assassination of Yandarbiyev, an assassination attempt of his son Daud Yandarbiyev, and smuggling weapons into Qatar. According to Moscow, Yablochkov and Pugachyov were secret intelligence agents sent to the Russian Embassy in Doha to collect information about global terrorism. Russia's acting Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov pledged state support to the suspects and declared that their imprisonment was illegal. There were some speculations that Fetisov had been released in exchange for Qatari wrestlers detained in Moscow. The trial proceedings were closed to the public after the defendants claimed that the Qatari police had tortured them in the first days after their arrest, when they had been held incommunicado; the two Russians alleged that they had suffered beatings, sleep deprivation and attacks by guard dogs. Based on these torture allegations and the fact that the two officers were arrested within an extraterritorial compound belonging to the Russian Embassy, Russia demanded the immediate release of its citizens. They were represented by the attorney of the law firm founded by Nikolai Yegorov, a friend and fellow student of Vladimir Putin at Leningrad State University. The Qatari prosecutors concluded that the suspects had received the order to eliminate Zelimkhan Yandarbiev from then Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov personally. On June 30, 2004, both Russians were sentenced to life imprisonment; passing the sentence, the judge stated that they had acted on orders from the Russian leadership. The verdict of the Doha court caused severe tensions between Qatar and Russia, and on December 23, 2004, Qatar agreed to extradite the prisoners to Russia, where they would serve out their life sentences. The agents however received a heroes' welcome on returning to Moscow on the same day but disappeared from public view shortly afterwards. The Russian prison authorities admitted in February 2005 that they were not in jail and said that the sentence handed down in Qatar was \\"irrelevant\\" in Russia.

Formed during the Pleistocene epoch, the mountain consists mainly of basaltic andesite lava and was heavily glaciated in the past. While other Oregon volcanoes that were heavily glaciated‚Äîsuch as Mount Washington and Mount Thielsen‚Äîdisplay eroded volcanic necks, Three Fingered Jack's present summit is a comparatively narrow ridge of loose tephra supported by a dike only thick on a generally north‚Äìsouth axis. Radiating dikes and plugs that support this summit have been exposed by glaciation. The volcano has long been inactive and has been highly eroded. Diverse flora and fauna can be found surrounding Three Fingered Jack. The area around the volcano was historically inhabited by the Molala people, one of the indigenous groups in the northwestern United States. Not much is known about their culture, other than that the group fished for salmon and collected berries, fruits, obsidian, and dried herbs. The first person of non-indigenous descent to reach the area was David Douglas in 1825, followed by Peter Skene Ogden the following year. The first group to ascend the volcano reached its summit in September 1923. Three Fingered Jack can still be climbed, but when its face becomes foggy, climbers can become disoriented due to the low visibility conditions of climbing the mountain, requiring rescue.  Geography  Three Fingered Jack lies in the U.S. state of Oregon, in Linn and Jefferson counties. It has a volume of and a summit elevation of , with a proximal topographic relief of and a draping relief of . Its jagged edifice rises between Mount Jefferson and the Three Sisters volcanic complex. Three Fingered Jack lies within the Mount Jefferson Wilderness and is not accessible by paved road, but can be approached by the Pacific Crest Trail. Located about northwest of the city of Sisters, it acts as a prominent landmark in the area. The Mount Jefferson Wilderness lies within the Willamette National Forest and Deschutes National Forest. The wilderness area covers , with more than 150 lakes. It also has of trails, including of the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail. Three Fingered Jack and Mount Jefferson are both prominent features of the wilderness area.  Physical geography  alt=A lake on the slope of Three Fingered Jack can be seen next to the ice of a glacier During the last major advance of glacial ice in the area during the Wisconsin glaciation, lateral and terminal moraines formed, along with glacial striations, altered vegetation patterns, and lithologies that suggest glacial transport of material. The sole glacier remaining on the volcano is the unofficially-named Jack glacier, located in a shaded cirque on the northeast side. Because the glacier is covered by tall ridges to the south and west, it resides at an unusually low altitude for the central Oregon Cascades. Jack glacier has an area of , though historically it has reached estimated areas of up to . It is likely stagnant. During the Little Ice Age, which spanned roughly 1350 to 1850, the glacier produced moraines with heights close to , which are dotted with of ash from the Sand Mountain cinder cone chain and of ash from the Blue Lake Crater cinder cone. As of 1993, the moraine for Jack glacier dammed a lake with a volume of , a surface area of , and a maximum depth of . Though this lake did not appear on United States Geological Survey topographic maps made during the 1920s, its presence was documented by a report in 1937. The lake sits precariously; moraines on the volcano are steep, unstable, and populated with boulders. Before September of 1960, there was a partial breach of this moraine-dammed lake that covered an area of near the moraine's base. Since 1960, there have been at least three incidents in which moraine-dammed lakes on the volcano have caused floods down the slopes, including a significant flood and debris flow in 2012. Local soil is thin, and it has been buried by a layer of weathered Holocene tephra from Three Fingered Jack, which has a maximum thickness of .  Ecology  alt=Mountain goats seen on the bare, rocky slope of the volcano, to the right of a forested area Along the volcano and its hiking trails, Douglas fir, Alpine fir, blue spruce, mountain hemlock, and bear grass can be found. The Cascade parsley fern can be found at Three Fingered Jack between elevations of . There are also mountain goats in the surrounding wilderness area. Carnivorous animals in the surrounding area include American black bears, coyotes, cougars, red foxes, raccoons, American martens, stoats (also known as ermines), long-tailed weasels, American minks, North American river otters, and bobcats. Deer species include Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and mule deer; insectivores include vagrant shrews, American water shrews, and coast moles. Bats at Jefferson include little brown bats and silver-haired bats, and American pikas and snowshoe hares are also present. Rodents such as yellow-bellied marmots, mountain beavers, yellow-pine chipmunks, Townsend's chipmunks, golden-mantled ground squirrels, western gray squirrels, Douglas squirrels, mountain pocket gophers, North American beavers, deer mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, water voles, Pacific jumping mice, and North American porcupines are present. Birds nearby include mallards, northern goshawks, sharp-shinned hawks, red-tailed hawks, dusky grouses, grey partridges, killdeers, spotted sandpipers, California gulls, band-tailed pigeons, great horned owls, mountain pygmy owls, common nighthawks, rufous hummingbirds, Northern flickers, pileated woodpeckers, yellow-bellied sapsuckers, hairy woodpeckers, and white-headed woodpeckers. Other bird species found in the area consist of Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, willow flycatchers, olive-sided flycatchers, tree swallows, Canada jays, Steller's jays, common ravens, Clark's nutcrackers, black-capped chickadees, mountain chickadees, chestnut-backed chickadees, red-breasted nuthatches, pygmy nuthatches, Eurasian treecreepers, American dippers, wrens, American robins, varied thrushes, hermit thrushes, Townsend's solitaires, golden-crowned kinglets, ruby-crowned kinglets, water pipits, blue-headed vireos, western tanagers, Cassin's finches, gray-crowned rosy finches, pine siskins, red crossbills, green-tailed towhees, dark-eyed juncos, white-crowned sparrows, golden-crowned sparrows, fox sparrows, and Lincoln's sparrows. Long-toed salamanders, California giant salamanders, rough-skinned newts, tailed frogs, western toads, Pacific tree frogs, northern red-legged frogs, Oregon spotted frogs, pygmy short-horned lizards, common garter snakes, and northwestern garter snakes make up some of the amphibious and reptilian animals in the vicinity. Roughly half the lakes in the Mount Jefferson Wilderness area contain rainbow trout.  Geology and subfeatures  Three Fingered Jack as seen from alt=Three Fingered Jack can be seen in the top left of the image, with a heavily forested area and a lake beneath Three Fingered Jack is a shield volcano, and it is part of the group of volcanoes known as Oregon's Matterhorns, whose tall, pinnacle spires resemble the Matterhorn in Switzerland. The volcano, along with Mount Thielsen, Mount Bailey, Diamond Peak, and Mount Washington, had a shorter lifespan than larger volcanoes in the Cascade Range, ceasing eruptive activity more than 100,000 years ago. Three Fingered Jack marks the northernmost point for this group. South of Mount Jefferson, the High Cascades of Oregon consist of a broad ridge produced by shield volcano activity and eruptions from cinder cones. Vents range from deeply eroded complexes to recently active volcanoes, with most of the region mantled by normally polarized rock produced within the past 730,000 years. The mountain also forms part of a group of more than 30 large shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes that form a segment of Pleistocene-to-Holocene-epoch volcanic vents that produced mafic lava (rich in magnesium and iron). Three Fingered Jack includes several, overlapping cinder cones and composite cones over underlying lava flows from shield volcano activity. These volcanic edifices and their lava flow deposits cover an area of . Between Three Fingered Jack and the North Sister volcano and among recently active basalt lava fields, there is an array of cinder cones encompassing an area of . alt=The volcano's bare, dissected edifice rises above a forested region The major edifice, which consists of light gray, basaltic andesite lava flow deposits, sits to the west of the first tephra cone. Variegated pyroclastic rock is embedded among these flows. Element abundance analysis suggests that lava in the Three Fingered Jack area can be grouped into discrete units based on its source magma chamber, except for the Jorn Lake basalt produced by the underlying shield volcano and basaltic andesite erupted by Three Fingered Jack. Petrological analysis shows high and low pressures for the crystallization of these lava flow deposits, and that basaltic andesite was distinct from basalt due to longer fractionation times. Though Three Fingered Jack does not have a high- level conduit-filling volcanic plug, its summit sits atop a pyroclastic cone. Another cone lies to the south of the major cone, and there are secondary craters on the sides, as well as radial dikes and volcanic plugs. Known subfeatures include two shield volcanoes, Maxwell Butte (less eroded than Three Fingered Jack) and Turpentine Peak, which have elevations of and , respectively. There are six additional known volcanic cones: Duffy Butte, at an elevation of ; Hogg Rock (a tuya), at an elevation of ; Marion Mountain, at an elevation of ; Red Butte, with an elevation of ; and Marion Peak and Saddle Mountain, which do not have elevations listed. Other shield volcanoes and cinder cones that were active during the Pleistocene epoch occur to the northwest and southwest. The volcano has a long ridge that trends from north to south. It is highly eroded; shaped like a sawtooth, it consists of tephra deposits supported by a vertical dike with a thickness of . Erosion has been so extensive that climbers claim that the summit moves in the wind. During the Pleistocene epoch, glaciers exposed its inner contents, providing evidence for its eruptive history. Though it has not been dated by radiometric approaches, the volcano is likely between 500,000 and 250,000 years old, and has been carved out by at least three glacial periods.  Eruptive history  Three Fingered Jack shows a similar eruptive history to many High Cascade volcanoes. Activity began with the formation of a pyroclastic cone over shield volcanoes. Later eruptions formed a main volcanic cone from lava flows and more pyroclastic rock. There are dikes that radiate from a micronorite plug, which deformed tephra in the surrounding strata. The northern and southern flanks of Three Fingered Jack feature lava flows made of olivine and augite basalt. Three Fingered Jack is estimated to be between 500,000 and 250,000 years old. It underwent more explosive eruptions as its eruptive history progressed, generating large amounts of tephra, which created a loose, unconsolidated summit and upper cone. Lava flows near the summit have an average thickness of . Secondary volcanic craters produced lava flows and pyroclastic material, which traveled both north and south of the volcano. Cone-building eruptions ceased before the Pleistocene epoch's glacial period, allowing the expanded glacial cover to remove most of the cone, especially on the eastern and northeastern sides. During the ongoing Holocene epoch, there has been volcanic activity between the Three Sisters volcanoes and Three Fingered Jack. Such eruptive episodes have produced tephra and lava flows that cover several hundred square kilometers in the region. These eruptions occurred after the climactic eruption of Mount Mazama, which took place roughly 6,600 years ago.  Human history  The surrounding area has traditionally been inhabited by Molala people, one of the indigenous groups in the northwestern United States. The group fished for salmon, collecting berries, fruits, obsidian, and dried herbs. Their culture was not well documented. The first person of non- indigenous descent to reach the area was David Douglas in 1825, followed by Peter Skene Ogden the following year. Sources disagree about the affiliation of the mountain's first ascenders, some calling them \\"the Boys from Bend,\\" others saying they were members of the Mazamas mountaineering club. Nonetheless, a source written by one of these first ascenders clearly states who was in the party and when they climbed. Ervin McNeal, Phil Philbrook, Armin Furrer, Wilbur Watkins, Leo Harryman, and Ronald Sellars were the first to ascend Three Fingered Jack on September 3, 1923. The origins of Three Fingered Jack's name remain unclear. One account claims that the volcano received its name from Joaquin Murrieta, a gold miner and vaquero during the California Gold Rush also known as Three Fingered Jack. Others allege that the volcano was named after a trapper with less than five fingers on one of his hands.  Recreation  Three Fingered Jack's surrounding area can be hiked, offering views of the volcano. The Canyon Creek Meadows hiking trail begins at Jack Lake, progresses through the Mount Jefferson Wilderness, and runs for about . It has an elevation gain of , and can be hiked by children and families. An additional, connected hiking trail runs for another up the rocky glacial washout plain adjacent to the volcano, becoming steeper as it approaches Three Fingered Jack and gaining in elevation. The base can also be reached on Pacific Crest Trail 2000, which runs for round trip and offers views of the volcano and its summit lake. Moreover, the Three Fingered Jack loop trail runs for around the volcano, gaining in elevation. When Three Fingered Jack's face becomes foggy, climbers have become disoriented due to the low visibility conditions of climbing the mountain, requiring rescue. The summit can be quite dangerous due steep cliffs and poor rock quality which can result in footing and hand holds giving way without warning. One such event occurred on July 19th, 2020, resulting in the death of a hiker attempting to reach the summit.  Notes  * [a] Sources disagree on the volcano's height; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Global Volcanism Program lists it at , Wood and Kienle (1990) list its elevation as , and the Geographic Names Information System lists it at . * [b] According to Hildreth's definitions, proximal relief refers to the difference between the summit elevation and the highest exposure of old rocks under the main edifice, while draping relief marks the difference between the summit elevation and the edifice's lowest distal lava flows (excluding pyroclastic and debris flows). * [c] Hildreth (2007) lists Three Fingered Jack as a stratovolcano, as do O'Connor, Harrison, and Costa (2001) and Scott (1977).

Since their popularization by companies such as Converse, Nike and Spalding in the mid 20th century, they have become attire, with variety growing in many global markets exponentially. Like other parts of the global clothing industry, manufacture of shoes is heavily concentrated in Asia with 9 in 10 shoes produced in that region. Contemporary sneakers are largely made from synthetic materials, and the materials and manufacturing process produce, on average, about 14 kgs of CO2 emissions. Names and etymology Reebok sneakers The shoes have gone by a variety of names, depending on geography and changing over the decades. The term \\"sneakers\\" is most commonly used in Northeastern United States, Central and South Florida, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Canada. However, in Australian, Canadian, and Scottish English, running shoes and runners are synonymous terms used to refer to sneakers; with the latter term also used in Hiberno-English. Tennis shoes is another term used in Australian, and North American English. The British English equivalent of sneaker in its modern form is trainer, or training shoes. However, in Geordie English, sneakers may also be called sandshoes (though these are different, being the canvas shoes worn in school gym classes), gym boots, or joggers; while they may be referred to as daps in Welsh English. Several terms for sneakers exist in South Africa, including gym shoes, tennies, sports shoes, sneaks, and takkies. Other names for sneakers includes rubber shoes in Philippine English, track shoes in Singapore English, canvas shoes in Nigerian English, and sportex in Greece. Plimsolls (British English) are \\"low-tech\\" athletic shoes and are also called \\"sneakers\\" in American English. The word \\"sneaker\\" is often attributed to American Henry Nelson McKinney, who was an advertising agent for N. W. Ayer & Son. In 1917, he used the term because the rubber sole made the shoe's wearer stealthy. The word was already in use at least as early as 1887, when the Boston Journal made reference to \\"sneakers\\" as \\"the name boys give to tennis shoes.\\" The name \\"sneakers\\" originally referred to how quiet the rubber soles were on the ground, in contrast to noisy standard hard leather sole dress shoes. Someone wearing sneakers could \\"sneak up\\" on someone while someone wearing standards could not.Mental Floss magazine, Sept-Oct 2008 Earlier, the name \\"sneaks\\" had been used by prison inmates to refer to warders because of the rubber-soled shoes they wore. History These shoes acquired the nickname 'plimsoll' in the 1870s, derived according to Nicholette Jones' book The Plimsoll Sensation, from the coloured horizontal band joining the upper to the sole, which resembled the Plimsoll line on a ship's hull. Alternatively, just like the Plimsoll line on a ship, if water got above the line of the rubber sole, the wearer would get wet. Plimsolls were widely worn by vacationers and also began to be worn by sportsmen on the tennis and croquet courts for their comfort. Special soles with engraved patterns to increase the surface grip of the shoe were developed, and these were ordered in bulk for the use of the British Army. Athletic shoes were increasingly used for leisure and outdoor activities at the turn of the 20th century - plimsolls were even found with the ill-fated Scott Antarctic expedition of 1911. Plimsolls were commonly worn by pupils in schools' physical education lessons in the UK from the 1950s until the early 1970s. British company J.W. Foster and Sons designed and produced the first shoes designed for running in 1895; the shoes were spiked to allow for greater traction and speed. The company sold its high-quality handmade running shoes to athletes around the world, eventually receiving a contract for the manufacture of running shoes for the British team in the 1924 Summer Olympics. Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell won the 100 m and 400 m events, kitted out with Foster's running gear. A pair of white athletic Nike sneakers with pink accents This style of footwear also became prominent in America at the turn of the 20th century, where they were called 'sneakers'. In 1892, the U.S. Rubber Company introduced the first rubber-soled shoes in the country, sparking a surge in demand and production. The first basketball shoes were designed by Spalding as early as 1907. The market for sneakers grew after World War I, when sports and athletics increasingly became a way to demonstrate moral fiber and patriotism. The U.S. market for sneakers grew steadily as young boys lined up to buy sneakers endorsed by football player Jim Thorpe and Converse All Stars endorsed by basketball player Chuck Taylor. During the interwar period, athletic shoes began to be marketed for different sports, and differentiated designs were made available for men and women. Athletic shoes were used by competing athletes at the Olympics, helping to popularise athletic shoes among the general public. In 1936, a French brand, Spring Court, marketed the first canvas tennis shoe featuring signature eight ventilation channels on a vulcanised natural rubber sole. Adolf \\"Adi\\" Dassler began producing his own sports shoes in his mother's wash kitchen in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, after his return from World War I, and went on to establish one of the leading athletic shoe manufacturers, Adidas. He also successfully marketed his shoes to athletes at the 1936 Summer Olympics, which helped cement his good reputation. Business boomed and the Dasslers were selling 200,000 pairs of shoes each year before World War II.  Post-War  A large pile of athletic shoes for sale at a market in Hong Kong During the 1950s, leisure opportunities greatly expanded, and children and adolescents began to wear sneakers as school dress codes relaxed. Sneaker sales rose so high, they began to adversely affect the sales of conventional leather shoes, leading to a fierce advertising war for market share in the late '50s. In the 1970s, jogging for exercise became increasingly popular, and trainers designed specifically for comfort while jogging sold well. Companies also started to target some of their products at the casual fashion market. Soon, shoes were available for football, jogging, basketball, running, etc. Many sports had their relevant shoe, made possible by podiatrist development of athletic shoe technology. During the 1990s, shoe companies perfected their fashion and marketing skills. Sports endorsements with famous athletes grew larger, and marketing budgets went through the roof. Sneakers became a fashion statement and were marketed as a definition of identity and personality rather than simply athletic aids.Pribut, Stephen M. \\"A Sneaker Odyssey.\\" Dr. Stephen M. Pribut's Sport Pages. 2002. Web. 23 June 2010. From 1970 (5 models) over 1998 (285 models) to 2012 (3,371), the number of sport shoe models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.Aichner, T. and Coletti, P. 2013. Customers' online shopping preferences in mass customization. Journal of Direct, Data and Digital Marketing Practice, 15(1): 20-35. Use in sports Road runners New Balance 750v1 after marathon event The term 'athletic shoes' is typically used for shoes utilized for jogging or road running and indoor sports such as basketball, but tends to exclude shoes for sports played on grass such as association football and rugby football, which are generally known in North America as \\"cleats\\" and in British English as \\"boots\\" or \\"studs\\". Attributes of an athletic shoe include a flexible sole, appropriate tread for the function, and ability to absorb impact. As the industry and designs have expanded, the term \\"athletic shoes\\" is based more on the design of the bottom of the shoe than the aesthetics of the top of the shoe. Today's designs include sandals, Mary Janes, and even elevated styles suitable for running, dancing, and jumping. The shoes themselves are made of flexible compounds, typically featuring a sole made of dense rubber. While the original design was basic, manufacturers have since tailored athletic shoes for their specific purposes. An example of this is the spiked shoe developed for track running. Some of these shoes are made up to unusually large sizes for athletes with large feet. Running shoes Running shoes come in a range of shapes suited to different running styles/abilities. Generally, they are divided by running style: the majority are for heel-toe joggers/runners which are further subdivided into 'neutral', 'overpronation' and 'underpronation'. These are constructed with a complex structure of \\"rubber\\" with plastic/metal stiffeners to restrict foot movement. More advanced runners tend to wear flatter and flexible shoes, which allow them to run more quickly with greater comfort. According to the NPD Group, one in four pairs of running shoes that were sold in the United States in 2016 were bought from an online retailer. Notable brands , brands with global popularity include: Types and number of models * High-tops cover the ankle. * Low-tops or oxfords do not cover the ankle. * Mid-cut sneakers are in-between high-tops and low-tops. * Sneaker boots extend to the calf. * Slip-ons like low-tops/oxfords do not cover the ankle and do not have laces. * Low-top CVO (Circular Vamp Oxford) like low- tops do not cover the ankle but unlike low-tops have a vamp in a circular form and typically four to five eyelets. * High-top CVO (Circular Vamp Oxford) like high-tops cover the ankle and also have a circular vamp.  Sneaker culture  Exhibition The Rise of Sneaker Culture at the Brooklyn Museum Sneakers have been an important part of hip hop (primarily Pumas, Nike, and Adidas) and rock 'n roll (Converse, Vans) cultures since the 1970s. Hip hop artists sign million dollar deals with major brands such as Nike, Adidas, or Puma to promote their shoes. Sneaker collectors, called \\"sneakerheads\\", regard sneakers as fashionable items. Sneaker companies encourage this trend by producing rare sneakers in limited numbers, often at very high retail prices. Artistically-modified sneakers can sell for upwards of $1000 at exclusive establishments like Saks Fifth Avenue.2014 Saks Fifth Avenue catalog In 2005, a documentary, Just for Kicks, about the sneaker phenomenon and history was released.History of Sneakers http://theidleman.com/history-of-sneakers See also * Biodegradable athletic footwear * Comparison of orthotics * List of shoe styles  References  Category:20th-century fashion Category:21st- century fashion Category:Athletic shoes Category:Footwear Category:History of clothing (Western fashion) Category:History of fashion Category:Shoes ","title":"Sneakers"},{"id":"467482","text":"Against Interpretation is a collection of essays by Susan Sontag published in 1966. It includes some of Sontag's best-known works, including \\"On Style,\\" and the eponymous essay \\"Against Interpretation.\\" In the latter, Sontag argues that the new approach to criticism and aesthetics neglects the sensuous impact of art, replacing it with tame intellectual analyses and emphasis on the \\"content\\" or \\"meaning\\" of a work. In effect, she wrote, interpretation had become \\"the intellect's revenge upon art.\\" The essay famously finishes with the words, \\"in place of a hermeneutics we need an erotics of art\\". The book was a finalist for the Arts and Letters category of the National Book Award Summary \\"Against Interpretation\\" is Sontag's influential essay within Against Interpretation and Other Essays that discusses the divisions between two different kinds of art criticism and theory: that of formalist interpretation, and that of content-based interpretation. Sontag is strongly averse to what she considers to be contemporary interpretation, that is, an overabundance of importance placed upon the content or meaning of an artwork rather than being keenly alert to the sensuous aspects of a given work and developing a descriptive vocabulary for how it appears and how it does whatever it does. She believes that interpretation of the modern style has a particular ‚Äútaming‚Äù effect: reducing the freedom of a subjective response and placing limitations or certain rules upon a responder. The modern style of interpretation is particularly despised by Sontag in relation to the previous classical style of interpretation that sought to ‚Äúbring artworks up to date‚Äù, to meet modern interests and apply allegorical readings. Where this type of interpretation was seen to resolve conflict between past and present by revamping an art work and maintaining a certain level of respect and honour, Sontag believes that the modern style of interpretation has lost sensitivity and rather strives to ‚Äúexcavate...destroy‚ÄùSusan Sontag, Against Interpretation and Other Essays, (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1966), p. 7 a piece of art. Sontag asserts that the modern style is quite harmful; to art and to audiences alike, enforcing hermeneutics -- fallacious, complicated ‚Äúreadings‚Äù that seem to engulf an artwork, to the extent that analysis of content begins to degrade, to destroy. Reverting to a more primitive and sensual, almost magical experience of art is what Sontag desires; even though that is quite impossible due to the thickened layers of hermeneutics that surround interpretation of art and that have grown to be recognised and respected. Sontag daringly challenges Marxian and Freudian theories, claiming they are ‚Äúaggressive and impious‚Äù.Susan Sontag, Against Interpretation and Other Essays, (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1966), p. 13 Sontag also refers to the contemporary world as one of ‚Äúoverproduction... material plentitude‚Äù,Susan Sontag, Against Interpretation and Other Essays, (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1966), p. 11 where one's physical senses have been dulled and annihilated by mass production and complex interpretation to the extent that appreciation of the form of art has been lost. To Sontag, modernity means a loss of sensory experience and she believes (in corroboration with her theory of the damaging nature of criticism) that the pleasure of art is diminished by such overload of the senses. In this way, Sontag asserts that inevitably, the modern style of interpretation separates form and content in a manner that damages an artwork and one's own sensorial appreciation of a piece. Though she claims that interpretation can be ‚Äústifling‚Äù, making art comfortable and ‚Äúmanageable‚Äù and thus degrading the artist‚Äôs original intention, Sontag equally presents a solution to the dilemma she sees as an abundance of interpretation on content. That is, to approach art works with a strong emphasis on form, to ‚Äúreveal the sensuous surface of art without mucking about in it.‚ÄùSusan Sontag, Against Interpretation and Other Essays, (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1966), p. 14 Reception In a contemporary review of the book, Benjamin DeMott of The New York Times praised Against Interpretation as \\"a vivid bit of living history here and now, and at the end of the sixties it may well rank among the invaluable cultural chronicles of these years.\\" He concluded, \\"Miss Sontag has written a ponderable, vivacious, beautifully living and quite astonishingly American book.\\" Brandon Robshaw of The Independent later observed, \\"This classic collection of essays and criticism from the 1960s flatters the reader's intelligence without being intimidating.\\" He added, \\"...the essays are unfailingly stimulating. Though they bear the stamp of their time, Sontag was remarkably prescient; her project of analysing popular culture as well as high culture, the Doors as well as Dostoevsky, is now common practice throughout the educated world. And the artists and intellectuals she discusses ‚Äì Nietzsche, Camus, Godard, Barthes etc ‚Äì demonstrate that she knew which horses to back.\\" In their introduction to Critique and Postcritique (2017), Rita Felski and Elizabeth S. Anker argue that the title essay from Sontag's collection has played an important role in the field of postcritique, a movement within literary criticism and cultural studies that attempts to find new forms of reading and interpretation that go beyond the methods of critique, critical theory, and ideological criticism.

It lies within Deschutes and Linn counties and is surrounded by the Mount Washington Wilderness area. Like the rest of the Oregon Cascades, Mount Washington was produced by the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the continental North American tectonic plate, forming during the late Pleistocene. Made mostly of mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) volcanic rock like subalkaline basalt and basaltic andesite, it has a volcanic plug occupying its summit cone and numerous dikes. It is surrounded by other volcanic features such as cinder cones and spatter cones. The volcano's last eruptions took place from spatter cones about 1,350 years ago, generating basaltic andesite lava deposits. Mount Washington has barren surroundings, which have seen little historical recreational use. A wagon road at McKenzie Pass was built in 1872, which was later paved during the 1930s. On August 26, 1923, the mountain was first ascended by six boys from the neighboring city of Bend. The surrounding area was designated the Mount Washington Wilderness by the federal government in 1964. The wilderness area is not heavily used, though it has a number of hiking trails. Wildlife is sparse in the region. Vegetation is mostly limited to pines and shrubs. Animal life includes deer, American black bear, cougar, various small animal species, and some fish species in the lakes.  Geography  With an elevation of above sea level, Mount Washington is located in Deschutes and Linn counties in the U.S. state of Oregon. It lies north of McKenzie Pass, and some west of city of Sisters. It is accessible by foot trails only; the western and southwestern sides of Washington intersect with the Skyline Trail about from the Big Lake trailhead near U.S. Route 20. Despite being one of the smaller volcanic peaks in the Oregon Cascades, Mount Washington is the most prominent landmark between North Sister and Three Fingered Jack, with the Cache Mountain cinder cones to the northeast and Hayrick Butte and Hoodoo Butte to the northwest. The volcano forms a crest of steep, icy mountains with North Cinder Peak and Three Fingered Jack to the south of Mount Jefferson. The volcano has a pinnacle appearance resembling the spire-like shape of Mount Thielsen. According to Harris (2005), the volcano resembles Cleopatra's Needle from certain angles and the Sugarloaf Mountain in Brazil from others. The proximal relief for the volcano is , while the draping relief is . The volcano has an overall volume of .  Physical geography  Elevations in the Mount Washington area range from to greater than . Most precipitation falls during the winter as snow, and summers are warm and dry. During the winter season, the Cascades are covered with thick snow. As a result, Oregon Route 242 over McKenzie Pass becomes impassable from fall through late spring, while the Santiam Highway and Oregon Route 126 are maintained and remain open. Within the Mount Washington Wilderness, there are outwash plains and lateral, recessional, and terminal ground moraines. Many of these glacial deposits were created during the most recent glacial advance in the late Pleistocene, though there are Holocene glacial deposits as well. There was an ice sheet during the late Pleistocene between Mount Washington and Three Fingered Jack. The McKenzie River, fed by Clear Lake, runs south for about just west of Mount Washington before it turns west for another and meets the Willamette River near the city of Eugene.  Wilderness The Mount Washington Wilderness covers an area of . First named a wild area by the United States Forest Service in 1975, it was designated as one of the original wilderness areas under the 1964 Wilderness Act. Located to the west of Bend, the Mount Washington plot is the smallest of three wilderness areas that encompass most of the High Cascades, a physiographic region located in the central part of Oregon; the two others are the Three Sisters Wilderness and Mount Jefferson Wilderness. Used mostly by hunters, hikers, and climbers, the Mount Washington area includes the Dee Wright Observatory, smaller volcanoes, and parts of the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs north‚Äìsouth through the wilderness for about . Other major features include Belknap Crater and 28 lakes. The wilderness area is jointly administered by authorities for the Willamette National Forest and Deschutes National Forest.  Mineral and geothermal potential  A mineral survey from 1980 through 1981 detected little potential for metallic mineral or fossil fuel resources in the Mount Washington Wilderness. The area contains large amounts of cinder ‚Äì more than ‚Äì but there are alternate sources in the region, which are sufficient to meet local demands. Likewise, there are no mines in the area, nor any documented history of mining claims; the closest mines are located to the west in the Blue River mining district. The volcanic vents throughout the Mount Washington Wilderness are underlain by Eocene to Pliocene volcanic rock layers, which do not contain hydrocarbons for fossil fuels. While there is relatively little potential for geothermal energy in the High Cascades, there are hot springs along the western edge of the mountain range. The Belknap Hot Spring lies to the southwest of the wilderness area, ejecting water at a rate of per minute with a temperature of .  Ecology  Described by Wuerthner (2003) as a \\"rocks and ice wilderness,\\" much of the Mount Washington Wilderness consists of lava flows and rubble. However, it does include some forested areas, as well as 28 lakes in the northern and southwestern parts of the space. Vegetation in the area includes mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, ponderosa pine, and whitebark pine. Ponderosa pine occurs at the eastern base of the volcano, with Douglas fir on the western side. Vegetation is sparse on lava-covered surfaces. Mountain hemlock, however, also grows on lava flows, and there is an understory of beargrass, huckleberry, and rhododendron. Animal life includes large animals such as deer and elk, with the rare American black bear or cougar. Smaller animals like pikas, marmots, martens, snowshoe hares, and ground squirrels are also found in the area. Lakes in the wilderness sustain populations of brook trout, cutthroat trout, and rainbow trout, and frogs can be observed around some of them.  Human history  The barrenness of Mount Washington's surroundings means that it has seen little historical recreational use. A wagon road at McKenzie Pass was built in 1872, which was later paved during the 1930s and became Oregon Route 242. It received its name from the nearby McKenzie River, which in turn derived its name from Donald McKenzie, a fur trader who explored the area in 1812. On August 26, 1923, Mount Washington was climbed for the first time by six boys from Bend: E. McNeal, P. Philbrook, A. Furrer, W. Watkins, L. Harryman, and R. Sellars. Before Mount Washington's surroundings were designated a wilderness area in 1964, the Willamette National Forest administration had planned to open them to commercial timber production to address a shortage in Lane County, asserting that the land had little aesthetic or recreational merit. The area was established anyway, as Forest Service agents argued it would improve \\"wilderness\\".  Geology  The spire- like appearance of Mount Washington Volcanism in the Oregon segment of the Cascade Range results from intra-range rifts and the subduction of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate under the North American tectonic plate. Mount Washington forms part of the High Cascades physiographic region in central Oregon, an arc of Pliocene to Quaternary lava flows, cinder cones, and fissure vents that trend from north to south, with occasional large stratovolcanoes. Near Mount Washington, the High Cascades form a lava field with high-alumina, diktytaxitic basalt erupted from cinder cones. These volcanoes have been eroded by glaciers and reduced to buttes in the Cascade arc, and much of the vents in the area were covered by Mount Washington. Some basalt lava flows occur on the edges of Mount Washington at the Cache Creek and Dry Creek canyons or as outcrops that form benches (long, relatively narrow strips of relatively level or gently inclined land bounded by distinctly steeper slopes above and below) about away from Washington from Patjens Lake to the McKenzie River. Washington is part of the informal group of volcanoes known as Oregon's Matterhorns, which includes Mount Thielsen, Three Fingered Jack, Mount Bailey, and Diamond Peak. The name originates from the spire-like appearance of the volcanoes' summits, which resembles the pinnacle of the Matterhorn in Switzerland. They all ceased eruptive activity at least 100,000 to 250,000 years ago, leading to their extensive dissection by glaciers over time. Mount Washington is also part of the Sisters Reach subsegment, which extends for and contains at least 466 volcanoes that were active during the Quaternary. Washington represents one of 30 mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) stratovolcanoes and shield volcanoes in the group, which include Pleistocene and Holocene eruptive centers. The volcano and its wilderness area sit on a lava platform with an altitude of , and they are bounded by faults to the east and west. Volcanic rocks contained within the wilderness area are either composed of older basalt or younger basaltic andesite, all of which were produced during the Quaternary, probably during the past 700,000 years. Pleistocene deposits show evidence of erosion by glaciers. Holocene deposits, dated between 3,000 and 1,500 years old, encompass about half of the wilderness area, and they also occur outside the wilderness area at its northwestern and southern borders. alt=An eroded volcanic edifice rises above a forested region Whether Mount Washington is a stratovolcano or shield volcano is debated within the literature. Wood and Kienle (1990) refer to it as a \\"mafic shield volcano,\\" and the Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution also considers it a shield volcano with a pyroclastic cone. Sherrod et al. (2004) classify Mount Washington as a \\"steep-sided\\" shield volcano. E. M. Taylor describes Mount Washington as a stratovolcano cone that reaches an elevation of above an older shield volcano, referring to it as \\"a glacially-gutted Pleistocene stratovolcano.\\" Hildreth (2007) likewise calls it a \\"a glacially sculpted mafic stratocone [...] with a broad apron of mafic lavas.\\" In his argument for classifying Mount Washington as a stratovolcano, Hildreth adds that it is made of composite materials with steep slopes and a high relief of . However, Hildreth acknowledges that there is morphological continuity from steep mafic cones into transitional, cone-shaped shield volcanoes like Olallie Butte. Mount Washington has a diameter of about . It has a summit cone, a volcanic plug comprised by cinder, lava flows, and intrusive rock that covers Washington's volcanic conduit. This plug is made of micronorite with a diameter of . There are dikes exposed throughout the summit cone, mostly oriented from north to south, with another dike swarm trending north from the central plug. The summit formed over a platform of basaltic andesite lavas from early eruptions at Mount Washington, made of thinner flows combined with pyroclastic rock. The volcano has a mafic composition, with subalkaline basalt and basaltic andesite. Lava flows from Washington exhibit breccia with plagioclase and olivine, with palagonite tuff at the northeastern slope of the mountain that might indicate a past subglacial eruption during Washington's cone-building phase. Mount Washington has been eroded over time and is now very dissected, with its inner contents exposed and U-shaped canyons and cirques. In the late Pleistocene, large glaciers extending more than to the east and west carved cirques into the slopes of the volcano. The George Lake and Dry Creek cirques, which face north and northeast, respectively, show evidence of holding glaciers similar to those documented at Canyon Creek cirque on Three Fingered Jack with moraines. Wood and Kienle (1990) estimate that Mount Washington once extended to an elevation of , with an elevation of above the basalt lava field surrounding it.  Subfeatures  The Global Volcanism Program considers Cache Mountain, Little Cache Mountain, Hayrick Butte, and Hoodoo Butte subsidiary cones of Mount Washington. The Mount Washington Wilderness includes a number of cinder cones, typically with elevations between . Composed of gray to red cinder, they also have scoria and welded spatter. Major cinder cones in the wilderness include Belknap Crater, Twin Craters, Scott Mountain, and the Sand Mountain craters. Mount Washington with Belknap Crater on the left Eruptions from a chain of spatter cones mark the most recent activity at Mount Washington. About one mile in length, they trend northeast, with their mid-section parallel to depressions in the Cache Creek valley between Mount Washington and Blue Lake Crater. The northernmost vent of Mount Washington has a depth of and likely only ever erupted volcanic gas. The first group of four spatter cones lies to the south, with depths ranging from . Farther south, there are seven other vents, including three small craters separated from three larger vents to the south by a graben, as well as a central crater with a small crater on the northern side of its rim.  Mount Washington basaltic andesite  There are four major types of basalt and basaltic andesite in the central Cascades: early high-alumina olivine tholeiitic (HAOT) basalt, normal High Cascade HAOT basalt, North Sister basaltic andesites, and Mount Washington type basaltic andesites. Hughes (1990) argues that their differences could be the result of different magma sources or magma evolution in open systems. Mount Washington basaltic andesites are also considered one of the three distinct mafic rock types in the High Cascade platform, with North Sister basaltic andesites and normal basalts. The three groups all exhibit different major and trace element abundances. Mount Washington basaltic andesite is more common than North Sister basaltic andesite, with higher levels of incompatible elements and rare-earth elements. It also extends to the east and west of the major Cascade arc. Otherwise, the Mount Washington and North Sister basaltic andesites display lithologic similarities including a dearth of pyroxene phenocrysts and augite microphenocrysts, and both groups were probably near-primary melts. According to Hughes (1982), examples of Mount Washington basaltic andesites occur at Holocene deposits from Nash Crater, Four-in-One Cone, and Little Belknap Cone, as well as undated deposits at Todd Lake Volcano, Falls Creek, Broken Top, and the abutment of Tumalo Dam.  Eruptive history  Mount Washington formed during the late Pleistocene epoch; the volcano itself is not older than a few hundred thousand years. Harris (2005) estimates that it has not erupted for more than 250,000 years, similar to Mount Thielsen; this date is supported by James, Manga, and Rose (1999). Paleomagnetic evidence suggests that the volcano and associated lava flows exhibit normal magnetic polarity. Its volcanic edifice was produced through the eruption of basaltic andesite and mafic volcanic ash, the latter being preserved as palagonite tuff along the northeastern and southwestern flanks of the summit cone. Compared to larger stratovolcanoes in the Cascade volcanic arc, Mount Washington, like the rest of Oregon's Matterhorns, had a relatively short eruptive life. Several spatter cones produced basaltic andesite on the lower northeastern side of the volcano, following a fissure that reached from Washington's summit. There were no lava flows from this eruption, nor at an eruption at the nearby Blue Lake Crater, which produced volcanic material that displayed petrographic similarities to the Mount Washington splatter cone deposits. These include similar porphyritic textures with 10 to 15 percent plagioclase phenocrysts as well as similar alignments, suggesting that they erupted simultaneously. Sherrod et al. (2004) argue that the spatter cones and activity from Blue Lake Crater represent the most recent eruptions near the McKenzie Pass and Santiam Pass region. It is still possible that new volcanic cones could be produced at the base of Mount Washington. However, according to Taylor, Causey, and MacLeod (1983), the volcano itself is unlikely to still be active.  Recreation  Fisherman at Big Lake with Mount Washington in the background While the area is not used as frequently as many other wilderness areas in the Oregon branch of the Cascade Range, it offers scenic lakes and trails. The Pacific Crest Trail passes over the western side of Mount Washington. Other trails include a loop around the Patjens Lakes, the Hand Lake trail, and the Benson Lake route.

Historically the fabric was worn in a toga-like fashion by royalty among ethnic groups including the Ashanti, the Akyem, and the Fante. In modern Ghana, the wearing of Kente cloth has become widespread to commemorate special occasions, with highly sought after Kente brands led by master weavers. Due to the popularity of Kente cloth patterns, Kente print, which is a mass-produced version, typically produced China, is popular throughout the West. Globally, the print is used in the design of academic stoles in graduation ceremonies. Kente cloth, the traditional or national cloth of Ghana, is worn by most southern Ghanaian ethnic groups including the Akan, the Ga, and the Ewe.  Etymology  Kente Weaver on Adum Street in Kumasi, Ghana, 1819 Kente comes from the word kenten, which means \\"basket\\" in the Asante dialect of Akan language, referencing its the basket-like pattern. In Ghana, the Akan ethnic group refers to kente as nwentoma, meaning \\"woven cloth\\". Ashanti folklore includes a story where weavers invented kente by seeking to replicate the patterns of Anansi the spider.  History  Ashanti king Prempeh II wearing Kente West African cultures have been weaving textiles for thousands of years. Kente may have developed from a variety of weaving traditions which existed in Ghana since before the 11th century, with excavations in the region showing instruments such as spindles, whorls, and loom weights. By the 17th century, during the rise of the Ashanti Empire, Kente became popularized among Akan royalty, and by the early 19th century master weavers and Kente houses could be seen throughout the Ashanti capital of Kumasi. Production Kente production can be classified by three versions: authentic Kente cloth made by traditional weavers, Kente print produced by brands such as Vlisco and Akosombo Textile LTD, and mass-produced Kente pattern typically produced in China for Westerners. Authentic Kente cloth is the most expensive, while Kente print varies in price depending on production style. For authentic Kente, the towns of Bonwire, Sakora Wonoo, Ntonso, Safo and Adanwomase are noted for Kente weaving, and are located in the Ashanti region. Weaving is done on a wooden loom in which multiple threads of dyed fabric are pressed together. Weavers are typically apprentice under a master weaver or company for a number of years before producing their own patterns. Rolls of cloth are then imprinted with a brand to signify authenticity. Characteristics Kente patterns varies in complexity, with each pattern having a name or message by the weaver. Ghanaians choose kente cloths as much for their names as their colors and patterns. Although the cloths are identified primarily by the patterns found in the lengthwise (warp) threads, there is often little correlation between appearance and name. Names are derived from several sources, including proverbs, historical events, important chiefs, queen mothers, and plants. The cloth symbolizes high in value. Ahwepan refers to a simple design of warp stripes, created using plain weave and a single pair of heddles. The designs and motifs in kente cloth are traditionally abstract, but some weavers also include words, numbers and symbols in their work. Example messages include adweneasa, which translates as \\"i've exhausted my skills\\", is a highly decorated type of kente with weft- based patterns woven into every available block of plain weave. Because of the intricate patterns, adweneasa cloth requires three heddles to weave.

While it was claimed to be an act of unity with African-Americans, many, including Jade Bentil, a Ghanaian-Nigerian researcher, voiced objection and said that the white Democrats had no right to wear the kente cloth stoles. On the other hand Congressional Black Caucus chair Karen Bass said, at a news conference for the introduction of the Justice in Policing Act of 2020, that the white lawmakers were showing solidarity, and April Reign, who is credited with initiating the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag, while not a fan of the symbolism, suggested that the legislation's fate is more relevant than the event in the Capitol's Emancipation Hall.

Teasing out the similarities between public perspectives on cancer (the paradigmatic disease of the 20th century before the appearance of AIDS), and tuberculosis (the symbolic illness of the 19th century), Sontag showed that both diseases were popularly associated with personal psychological traits. In particular, she said that the metaphors and terms used to describe both syndromes lead to an association between repressed passion and the physical disease itself. She wrote about the peculiar reversal that \\"With the modern diseases (once TB, now cancer), the romantic idea that the disease expresses the character is invariably extended to assert that the character causes the disease‚Äîbecause it has not expressed itself. Passion moves inward, striking and blighting the deepest cellular recesses.\\" Sontag said that the clearest and most truthful way of thinking about diseases is without recourse to metaphor. She believed that wrapping disease in metaphors discouraged, silenced, and shamed patients. Some other writers have disagreed with her, saying that metaphors and other symbolic language help some affected people form meaning out of their experiences. Synopsis Illness as Metaphor served as a way for Susan Sontag to express her opinions on the use of metaphors in order to refer to illnesses, with her main focuses being tuberculosis and cancer. The book contrasts the view points and metaphors associated with each disease. At one point, tuberculosis was seen as a creative disease, leading to healthy people wanting to look as if they were ill with the disease. However, lack of improvement from tuberculosis was usually seen as lack of passion in the individual. Tuberculosis was even seen as a sign of punishment by some religions, such as Christianity, leading the afflicted to believe that they deserved their ailment. Sontag then made the comparison between the metaphors used to describe tuberculosis and cancer, with cancer being seen in the 1970s as a disease that afflicted people who lacked passion and sensuality, and those who repressed their feelings. Sontag wrote that multiple studies found a link between depression and cancer, which she argued was just a sign of the times and not a reason for the disease, since in previous times physicians found that cancer patients suffered from hyperactivity and hypersensitivity, which were signs of their times. In the last chapter, Sontag argued that society's disease metaphors cause patients to feel as if society were against them. Her final argument was that metaphors are not useful for patients, since metaphors make patients feel as if their illness was due to their feelings, rather than lack of effective treatment. The most effective way of thinking about illness would be to avoid metaphorical thinking, and to focus on only the physical components and treatment. Context Sontag wrote the treatise while being treated for breast cancer.Olson, p. 167 She does not mention her personal experience with cancer in the work, but she addresses it in her related 1988 work, AIDS and Its Metaphors. At the time that Sontag was writing, the fad in alternative cancer treatment was psychotherapy for the patient's supposed \\"cancer personality\\". According to these proponents, patients brought cancer upon themselves by having a resigned, repressed, inhibited personality. By undergoing the often blame-filled psychotherapy offered by some groups, such as the Simonton Center, the patient would overcome cancer by consciously choosing to give up the emotional benefits he or she created the cancer for, and be healed.Olson, pp. 160-169 Others have taken her idea further, showing not that there is a real \\"cancer\\" behind the metaphors, but that all we have is metaphor‚Äîeven in science‚Äîto understand the behavior of a disease that remains mysterious. Publication The work was originally published as three long essays in the New York Review of Books. Some of the more inflammatory language was slightly toned down for republication. For example, what Sontag originally called the \\"inimitable looniness\\" of Wilhelm Reich's language was softened to the \\"inimitable coherence\\". Reception While one of Sontag's widest read and most celebrated works., Illness as Metaphor has received mostly negative reviews. Kirkus Reviews called it \\"a small, liberating book that could become the cancer patient's Common Sense.\\" The literary critic Denis Donoghue of The New York Times gave the book a negative review, describing it as \\"a deeply personal book pretending for the sake of decency to be a thesis.\\" He added: The literary critic and frequent Sontag detractor Camille Paglia described the book as \\"clumsy and ponderous, like a graduate-school seminar paper.\\"Paglia, Camille. Vamps and Tramps: New Essays. Penguin Books, 1995, p. 353. Additionally, critics also brought up the argument that metaphoric thinking about diseases hasn't stopped research about diseases from taking place and that humans deal with the reality of their lives through the help of metaphors.

Dar√≠o has had a great and lasting influence on 20th- century Spanish literature and journalism. He has been praised as the \\"Prince of Castilian Letters\\" and undisputed father of the modernismo literary movement.\\"It was in the late 1880s that the celebrated Nicaraguan poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o (1867‚Äì1916) first published the term modernism (or modernismo in Spanish). The earliest known appearance in print worldwide of this term was in 1888 in Dar√≠o's essay \\"La literatura en Centro√°merica\\" (Revista de arte y cultural, Santiago, Chile) Life His parents, Manuel Garc√≠a and Rosa Sarmiento were married on April 26, 1866, in Le√≥n, Nicaragua, after obtaining the necessary ecclesiastic permissions since they were second degree cousins. However, Manuel's conduct of allegedly engaging in excessive consumption of alcohol prompted Rosa to abandon her conjugal home and flee to the city of Metapa in Matagalpa where she gave birth to F√©lix Rub√©n. The couple made up and Rosa even gave birth to a second child, a daughter named C√°ndida Rosa, who died a few days after being born. The marriage deteriorated again to the point where Rosa left her husband and moved in with her aunt, Bernarda Sarmiento. After a brief period of time, Rosa Sarmiento established a relationship with another man and moved with him to San Marcos de Col√≥n, in Choluteca, Honduras. Rub√©n Dar√≠o was born in Metapa, Matagalpa, Nicaragua. Although, according to his baptism, Rub√©n's true surname was Garc√≠a, his paternal family had been known by the surname Dar√≠o for many years. Rub√©n Dar√≠o explained it as follows in his autobiography: > According to what some of the old people in that town of my childhood have > referred to me, my great-grandfather had Dar√≠o as his nickname or first > name. In this small town he was known by everyone as \\"Don Dar√≠o\\" and his > entire family as the Dar√≠os.

Oro de Mallorca. Introducci√≥n de Antonio Piedra. > Madrid: Mondadori, 1990 (); p. 3 The catedral-bas√≠lica de la Asunci√≥n, in Le√≥n, Nicaragua, where the poet spent his infancy. His remains are buried in this church. Dar√≠o spent his childhood in the city of Le√≥n Nicaragua. He was brought up by his mother's aunt and uncle, F√©lix and Bernarda, whom Dar√≠o considered, in his infancy, to be his real parents. (He reportedly, during his first years in school, signed his assignments as F√©lix Rub√©n Ram√≠rez.) He rarely spoke with his mother, who lived in Honduras, or with his father, who he referred to as \\"Uncle Manuel\\". Although little is known about his first years, it is documented that after the death of F√©lix Ram√≠rez, in 1871, the family went through rough economic times and they considered sending young Rub√©n as a tailor's apprentice. According to his biographer Edelmiro Torres, he attended several schools in Le√≥n before going on, during 1879 and 1880, to be educated by the Jesuits. A precocious reader (according to his own testimony, he learned to read when he was three years oldAmong the books he mentions reading are Don Quijote, the Bible and works by Leandro Fern√°ndez de Morat√≠n (ref. Rub√©n Dar√≠o, op. cit., p. 5)), he soon began to write his first verses: a sonnet written by him in 1879 is conserved, and he published for the first time in a newspaper when he was thirteen years old. The elegy, Una l√°grima, which was published in the daily El Term√≥metro (Rivas) on July 26, 1880. A little later he also collaborated in El Ensayo, a literary magazine in Le√≥n, garnering attention as a \\"child poet\\". In these initial verses, according to Teodosio Fern√°ndez,Fern√°ndez, Teodosio: Rub√©n Dar√≠o. Madrid, Historia 16 Qu√≥rum, 1987. Colecci√≥n \\"Protagonistas de Am√©rica\\" (), p. 10 his predominating influences were Spanish poets contemporary to Jos√© Zorrilla, Ram√≥n de Campoamor, Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce and Ventura de la Vega. His writings of this time display a liberalism hostile to the excessive influence of the Roman Catholic Church, as documented in his essay, El jesuita, which was written in 1881. Regarding his political attitude, his most noteworthy influence was the Ecuadorian Juan Montalvo, whom he deliberately imitated in his first journalistic articles.Rub√©n Dar√≠o, op. cit., p. 18 Around December 1881 he moved to the capital, Managua, at the request of some liberal politicians that had conceived the idea that, given his gift for poetry, he should be educated in Europe at the expense of the public treasury. However, the anti-clerical tone of his verses did not convince the president of congress, the conservative Pedro Joaqu√≠n Chamorro Alfaro, and it was resolved that he would study in the Nicaraguan city of Granada, but Rub√©n opted to stay in Managua, where he continued his journalistic endeavor collaborating with the newspapers El Ferrocarril and El Porvenir de Nicaragua. In the capital, he fell in love with an eleven-year-old girl, Rosario Emelina Murillo, whom he wanted to marry. He traveled to El Salvador in August 1882, at the petition of his friends who wanted to delay his marriage plans. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon for people of Dar√≠o‚Äôs age of 14 to marry. In El Salvador In El Salvador, Dar√≠o was introduced to the president of the republic, Rafael Zaldivar, by Joaqu√≠n Mendez, a poet who took him under his wing. There, he met the Salvadoran poet Francisco Gavidia, a connoisseur of French poetry. Under the auspices of Gavidia, Dar√≠o attempted, for the first time, to adapt the French Alexandrine metric into Castilian verse.Francisco Gavidia's influence on Dar√≠o was decisive since it was him who introduced Dar√≠o to French poetry. The Nicaraguan wrote, in Historia de mis libros: > A√±os atr√°s, en Centroam√©rica, en la ciudad de San Salvador, y en compa√±√≠a > del poeta Francisco Gavidia, mi esp√≠ritu adolescente hab√≠a explorado la > inmensa salva de V√≠ctor Hugo y hab√≠a contemplado su oc√©ano divino en donde > todo se contiene... (English: Years ago, in Central America, in the city of > San Salvador, and in the company of the poet Francisco Gavidia, my > adolescent spirit had explored the immense promise of Victor Hugo and had > contemplated his divine ocean where everything is contained...) Although he enjoyed much fame and an intense social life in El Salvador, participating in celebrations such as the centenary of the birth of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, things began to get worse. He encountered economic hardships and contracted smallpox. In October 1883, still convalescent, he returned to his native homeland. After his return, he briefly resided in Le√≥n and then in Granada but he finally moved again to Managua where he became an employee of the Biblioteca Nacional de Nicaragua (the National Library of Nicaragua) and he resumed his romance with Rosario Murillo. In May 1884 he was condemned for vagrancy and sentenced to eight days of public work, although he managed to evade the fulfillment of the sentence. During that time he continued experimenting with new poetic forms, and he even had a book ready for printing, which was going to be titled Ep√≠stolas y poemas. This second book also did not get published, it would have to wait until 1888 when it was finally published as Primeras notas. He tested his luck with theatre, and he released his first play, titled Cada oveja..., which had some success, but no copy remains. He found life in Managua unsatisfactory, and prompted by the advice of some friends, opted to embark for Chile on June 5, 1886. In Chile After making a name for himself with love poems and stories, Dar√≠o left Nicaragua for Chile in 1886, and disembarked in Valparaiso on June 23, 1886. In Chile he stayed with Eduardo Poirier and a poet by the name of Eduardo de la Barra, together they co-authored a sentimental novel titled Emelina, with which they entered in a literary contest (although they did not win). It was because of his friendship with Poirier that Dar√≠o was able to obtain a job in the newspaper La √âpoca, in Santiago in July 1886. Juan Valera, novelist and literary critic, whose letters, addressed to Ruben Dar√≠o in the periodical El Imparcial, decisively consecrated Rub√©n Dar√≠o. During his stay in Chile, Dar√≠o had to endure continuous humiliation from the Chilean aristocracy that scorned him for his lack of refinement and for the color of his skin. Nonetheless, he managed to forge a few friendships, like the one with the son of the then president, the poet Pedro Balmaceda Toro. Soon after he published his first piece, Abrojos, in March 1887. He lived in Valparaiso for several months until September 1887 where he participated in several literary contests. In the month of July 1888, Azul, the key literary work of the modernist revolution that had just begun, was published in Valparaiso. Azul... is a compilation of a series of poems and textual prose that had already been published in the Chilean media between December 1886 and June 1888. The book was not an immediate success, but like a single ladie was well received by the influential Spanish novelist and literary critic Juan Valera, who published in the Madrid newspaper El Imparcial, in October 1888, two letters addressed to Dar√≠o, in which, although reproaching him for the excessive French influence in his writings (Valera's used the expression \\"galicismo mental\\" or 'mental Gallicism'), he recognized in Dar√≠o \\"[a] un prosista y un poeta de talento\\" (\\"a prose writer and poet of talent\\"). Journey in Central America The newly attained fame allowed Dar√≠o to obtain the position of newspaper correspondent for La Naci√≥n of Buenos Aires, which was at the time the most heavily circulated periodical in Hispanic America. A little after sending his first article to La Nacion, he set off on a trip back to Nicaragua. During a brief stop in Lima he met the writer Ricardo Palma. He arrived at the port in Corinto on March 7, 1889. In Le√≥n, he was received as a guest of honor, but his stay in Nicaragua was brief, and he moved to San Salvador where he was named director of the periodical La Uni√≥n which was in favor of creating a unified Central American state. In San Salvador, he was married by law to Rafaela Contreras, daughter of a famous Honduran orator, √Ålvaro Contreras, on June 21, 1890. One day after the wedding there was a coup d'√©tat against president (and general) Men√©ndez. The coup was mainly engineered by general Carlos Ezeta, who had been a guest at Dar√≠o's wedding, which ended with the death of his wife, which led him to remarry for a brief period, only for him to separate very shortly thereafter. He decided to leave El Salvador despite job offers from the new president. He moved to Guatemala at the end of June, while his bride remained in El Salvador. Guatemalan president Manuel Lisandro Barillas was making preparations for a war against El Salvador. Dar√≠o published, in the Guatemalan newspaper El Imparcial, an article titled Historia Negra in which he denounced Ezeta's betrayal of Men√©ndez. In December 1890 he was tasked with directing a newly created newspaper, El Correo de la Tarde. That same year the second edition of his successful book Azul..., substantially expanded, and using Valera's letters, which catapulted him to literary fame, as prologue (it is now customary that these letters appear in every edition of this book), was published in Guatemala. In January 1891 his wife reunited with him in Guatemala and they were married by the church on February 11, 1891. Three months later, the periodical which Dar√≠o was editing, El Correo de la Tarde, ceased receiving government subsidies, which forced it to close. He moved to Costa Rica and installed himself in the country's capital, San Jose, in August 1891. While in Costa Rica, he was haunted by debt despite being employed and was barely able to support his family. His first son, Rub√©n Dar√≠o Contreras, was born on November 12, 1891. Travels In 1892, he left his family in Costa Rica, and traveled to Guatemala and Nicaragua, in search for better economic prospects. Eventually, the Nicaraguan government named him a member of the Nicaraguan delegation to Madrid where events were going to take place to commemorate the fourth centennial of the discovery of America. During the trip to Spain, Dar√≠o made a stop in Havana, where he met Juli√°n del Casal and other artists, such as Aniceto Valdivia and Raoul Cay. On August 14, 1892, he disembarked in Santander, where he continued his journey to Madrid via train. Among those with whom he interacted frequently were poets Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce, Jos√© Zorrilla and Salvador Rueda; novelists Juan Valera and Emilia Pardo Baz√°n; erudite Marcelino Men√©ndez Pelayo; and several distinguished politicians such as Emilio Castelar and Antonio C√°novas del Castillo. In November, he returned to Nicaragua, where he received a telegram from San Salvador notifying him of his wife's illness; she died on January 23, 1893. At the onset of 1893, Ruben remained in Managua, where he renewed his affairs with Rosario Murillo, whose family forced Dar√≠o to marry her.His biographer, Edelberto Torres, narrates the events in the following way: > It is Rosario's brother, a man completely lacking in scruples, Andr√©s > Murillo; he knows his sister's intimate drama, which rendered her incapable > of marrying any punctilious gentleman. Furthermore, Rosario's 'case' has > become public knowledge, so Andres conceives a plan to marry his sister with > Dar√≠o. He knows the poet's spineless character, and the state of apathy to > which he is reduced under the influence of alcohol. He informs his plan to > his sister and she accepts. At dawn of some ill-fated day, Rub√©n has > innocently and honestly given himself to the amorous flirts with Rosario, in > a house located in front of the lake. Suddenly, Andr√©s, who pulls out a > revolver and with insolent words threatens Dar√≠o with death if he does not > marry his sister. The poet, confused and scared, accepts. Since everything > is prepared, a priest arrives at the house of Francisco Sol√≥rzano Lacayo, > one of Andr√©s' brothers in law: who has made sure Rub√©n had plenty of > whiskey and in this drunken state he proceeds to the religious marriage, the > only type allowed in Nicaragua, on March 8, 1893. The poet has no idea about > the 'yes' he has uttered. His senses are completely dulled, and when he > wakes up the next morning and regains consciousness, he is in his conjugal > bed with Rosario, under the same blanket. He does not protest or complain; > but he realizes that he has been the victim of a perfidy, and that this > event would go down as a burden of disgrace during his lifetime. In Argentina Bartolom√© Mitre, to whom Dar√≠o dedicated his ode: Oda a Mitre. Dar√≠o was well received by the intellectual media of Buenos Aires. He collaborated with several newspapers: in addition to La Naci√≥n, to which he was already a correspondent, he published articles in La Prensa, La Tribuna and El Tiempo, to name a few. His position as the Colombian consul was merely honorific, since, as Dar√≠o has stated in his autobiography: \\"no hab√≠a casi colombianos en Buenos Aires y no exist√≠an transacciones ni cambios comerciales entre Colombia y la Rep√∫blica Argentina.\\"English translation: \\"there were hardly any Colombians in Buenos Aires and there were no transactions or commercial exchanges between Colombia and the Argentinian Republic.\\" (Source: Rub√©n Dar√≠o, op. cit., p. 74) In the Argentinian capital he led a bohemian life-style and his abuse of alcohol led to the need for medical care in several occasions. Among the personalities with whom he dealt were the politician Bartolom√© Mitre, the Mexican poet Federico Gamboa, the Bolivian poet Ricardo Jaimes Freyre and the Argentinian poets Rafael Obligado and Leopoldo Lugones. His mother, Rosa Sarmiento, died on May 3, 1895. In October 1895, the Colombian government abolished its consulate in Buenos Aires depriving Dar√≠o of an important source of income. As a remedy, he obtained a job as Carlos Carl√©s's secretary, who was the general director of the institution handling mail and telegrams in Argentina. In 1896, in Buenos Aires, Dar√≠o published two of his most crucial books: Los raros, a collection of articles about the writers that most interested him, and second, Prosas profanas y otros poemas, the book that established the most definite consecration of Spanish literary modernism. However popular it became, though, his work was not initially well received. His petitions to the Nicaraguan government for a diplomatic position went unattended; however, the poet discovered an opportunity to travel to Europe when he learned that La Naci√≥n needed a Correspondent in Spain to inform about the situation in the European country after Spain's disaster of 1898. It is from the United States military intervention in Cuba that Ruben Dar√≠o coined, two years before Jos√© Enrique Rod√≥, the metaphorical opposition between Ariel (a personification of Latin America) and Calib√°n (a monster which metaphorically represents the United States of America.)\\"Calib√°n, icono del 98. A prop√≥sito de un art√≠culo de Rub√©n Dar√≠o\\" Jauregui, Carlos A. Revista Iberoamericana 184‚Äì185 (1998) last accessed August 2008 On December 3, 1898, Dar√≠o decamped to Europe, arriving in Barcelona three weeks later. Between Paris and Spain Dar√≠o wrote a poem directed to the President of the United States at the time, Theodore Roosevelt Dar√≠o arrived in Spain committed to sending four chronicles per month to La Naci√≥n about the prevalent mood in the Spanish nation after the defeat it suffered to the United States of America, and the loss of its colonial possessions; Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and Guam. These chronicles would end up being compiled in a book that was published in 1901, titled Espa√±a Contempor√°nea. Cr√≥nicas y retratos literarios. In the writings, he expresses his profound sympathy towards Spain, and his confidence in Spain's revival, despite the state of despair he observed. In Spain, Dar√≠o won the admiration of a group of young poets who defended Modernism (a literary movement that was not absolutely accepted by the most established writers, especially those belonging to the Real Academia Espa√±ola.) Among these young modernists there were a few writers that would later have important roles in Spanish literature such as Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, Ram√≥n Mar√≠a del Valle-Incl√°n and Jacinto Benavente, and some that were prevalent in their time, like Francisco Villaespesa, Mariano Miguel de Val, director of the magazine Ateneo, and Emilio Carrere. In 1899, Rub√©n Dar√≠o, who was still legally married to Rosario Murillo, met Francisca S√°nchez del Pozo in the Casa de Campo of Madrid. Francisca was from Navalsauz in the province of √Åvila and would be his companion through the last years of his life. In April 1900, Dar√≠o visited Paris for a second time, commissioned by La Naci√≥n to cover the Exposition Universelle that took place that year in the French capital city. His chronicles about this topic would later be compiled in the book Peregrinaciones. During the first years of the 20th century, Dar√≠o lived in Paris, where in 1901 published the second edition of Prosas profanas. That same year Francisca and Rub√©n had a daughter. After giving birth she traveled to Paris to reunite with him, leaving the baby girl in the care of her grandparents. The girl died of smallpox during this period, without her father ever meeting her. In March 1903 he was appointed as consul by Nicaragua. His second child by Francisca was born in April 1903, but also died at a very young age. During those years, Dar√≠o traveled through Europe, visiting, among other countries, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany, and Italy. In 1905, he went to Spain as a member of a committee named by the Nicaraguan government whose task was to resolve a territorial dispute with Honduras. That year he published, in Madrid, the third of his most important poetry books, Cantos de vida y esperanza, los cisnes y otros poemas, edited by Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez. Some of his most memorable poems came to light in 1905, like \\"Salutaci√≥n del optimista\\" and \\"A Roosevelt\\", in which he extols Hispanic traits in the face of the threat of United States imperialism. The second poem (below) was directed at then president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt: In 1906 he participated as secretary of the Nicaraguan delegation to the Third Pan- American Conference held in Rio de Janeiro where he was inspired to write his poem \\"Salutaci√≥n del √°guila\\", which offers a view of the United States very different from that offered in prior poems: This poem was criticized by several writers who did not understand Ruben's sudden change of opinion with respect to the United States' influence in Latin America. In Rio de Janeiro, the poet was involved in an obscure romance with an aristocrat, believed to be the daughter of the Russian ambassador in Brazil. It seems that he then conceived the idea of divorcing Rosario Murillo, from whom he had been separated for years. On his way back to Europe, he made a brief stop in Buenos Aires. In Paris, he reunited with Francisca and together they spent the winter of 1907 on the island of Mallorca, which he later frequented the company of Gabriel Alomar, a futurist poet, and painter Santiago Rusi√±ol. He began writing a novel, La Isla de Oro, which he never finished, although some of its chapters were published in La Naci√≥n. His tranquility was interrupted by the arrival of his wife, Rosario Murillo, in Paris. She would not grant him a divorce unless she was guaranteed sufficient compensation, which Dar√≠o felt was disproportionate. By March 1907, when he was leaving for Paris, his alcoholism was very advanced and he fell gravely ill. On recuperating, he returned to Paris, but he was unable to reach an agreement with his wife, so he decided to return to Nicaragua to present his case in court. Ambassador in Madrid After two brief stops in New York and Panama, Dar√≠o arrived in Nicaragua where he was given a warm welcome. Regardless of the tributes offered to him, he failed to obtain a divorce. In addition, he was not paid what was owed to him from his position as consul; this left him unable to return to Paris. After a few months he managed to be named resident minister in Madrid for the Nicaraguan government of Jos√© Santos Zelaya. He had economic problems since his limited budget barely allowed him to meet all of his delegation's expenses, and he had much economic difficulty while he was Nicaraguan ambassador. He managed to get by, partly with his salary from La Naci√≥n and partly with the help of his friend and director of the magazine Ateneo, Mariano Miguel de Val, who, while the economic situation was at its toughest, offered himself as secretary to the Nicaraguan delegation at no charge and offered his house, number 27 Serrano street, to serve as the diplomatic quarters of the Nicaraguan delegation. When Zelaya was overthrown, Dar√≠o was forced to resign his diplomatic post on February 25, 1909. He remained loyal to Zelaya, whom he had heavily praised in his book Viaje a Nicaragua e Intermezzo tropical, and with whom he had collaborated in the writing of Estados Unidos y la revoluci√≥n de Nicaragua. In that work the United States and the Guatemalan dictator Manuel Estrada Cabrera were accused of planning the overthrow of the Zelaya government. During his time as ambassador, there was a rift between Dar√≠o and his former friend Alejandro Sawa, whose requests for economic assistance went unheard by Dar√≠o. The correspondence between them gives room to interpret that Sawa was the real author of several of the articles that Dar√≠o had published in La Naci√≥n.Teodosio Fern√°ndez, op. cit., p. 126 Last years Porfirio D√≠az, Mexican dictator who refused to receive the writer. In 1910, Dar√≠o traveled to Mexico as a member of a Nicaraguan delegation to commemorate a century of Mexican independence. However, the Nicaraguan government changed while Dario was abroad, and Mexican dictator Porfirio D√≠az refused to receive the writer, an attitude that was probably influenced by United States diplomacy. Dario, however, was well received by the people of Mexico, who supported Dar√≠o and not the government.Teodosio Fern√°ndez, op. cit., p. 129 In his autobiography, Dar√≠o relates those protests with the Mexican Revolution, which was about to occur: > For the first time in thirty three years of absolute control, the house of > the old Caesarean emperor had been stoned. One could say that that was the > first thunder of the revolution that brought the dethronement.Translation > of: \\"Por la primera vez, despu√©s de treinta y tres a√±os de dominio absoluto, > se apedre√≥ la casa del viejo Ces√°reo que hab√≠a imperado. Y all√≠ se vio, se > puede decir, el primer rel√°mpago de la revoluci√≥n que trajera el > destronamiento.\\" taken from: Rub√©n Dar√≠o, op. cit., p. 127 In light of the slight by the Mexican government, Dar√≠o left for La Habana, where, under the effects of alcohol, he attempted to commit suicide, perhaps triggered by the way he had been scorned. In November 1910 he returned to Paris, where he continued being a correspondent for La Naci√≥n and where he took a position for the Mexican Ministry of Public Instruction (Ministerio de Instrucci√≥n P√∫blica) which may have been given to him as a compensation for the public humiliation inflicted upon him. In 1912 he accepted an offer from the Uruguayan businessmen Rub√©n and Alfredo Guido to direct the magazines Mundial and Elegancias. To promote said publications, he went on tour in Latin America visiting, among other cities, R√≠o de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, Montevideo and Buenos Aires. It was also around this time that the poet wrote his autobiography, which was published in the magazine Caras y caretas under the title of La vida de Rub√©n Dar√≠o escrita por √©l mismo; and the work Historia de mis libros which is very important when learning about his literary evolution. After ending his journey due to the end of his contract with the Guido brothers, he returned to Paris and in 1913, invited by Joan Sureda, he traveled to Mallorca and found quarters at the Carthusian monastery of Valldemosa, where many decades into the past figures such as Chopin and George Sand had resided. It was in this island where Ruben began writing the novel El oro de Mallorca, which was a fictionalization of his autobiography. The deterioration of his mental health became accentuated, however, due to his alcoholism. In December he headed back to Barcelona, where he lodged at General Zelaya's house. Zelaya had taken Dar√≠o under his wing when he was president of Nicaragua. In January 1914 he returned to Paris, where he entered a lengthy legal battle with the Guido brothers, who still owed him a large sum of money for the work he had done for them. In May he moved to Barcelona, where he published his last important work of poetry, Canto a la Argentina y otros poemas, which includes the laudatory poem he had written to Argentina, which had been made to order for La Naci√≥n. Death Dar√≠o in 1915 Dar√≠o died on February 6, 1916, aged 49, in Le√≥n. The funeral lasted several days, and he was interred in the city's cathedral on February 13, 1973, at the base of the statue of Saint Paul near the chancel under a lion made of marble by the sculptor Jorge Navas Cordonero. Poetry=Range Dar√≠o wrote in thirty seven different metrical lines and 136 different stanza forms. Influences Paul Verlaine, a decisive influence in Dar√≠o's poetry. French poetry was a determinant influence in Dar√≠o's formation as a poet. In the first place, the romantics, particularly Victor Hugo. Later on, and in a decisive fashion, Dar√≠o was influenced by the parnassians: Th√©ophile Gautier, Catulle Mend√®s, and Jos√© Mar√≠a de Heredia. Another decisive influence was the writer of prose and poetry and national hero of Cuba, Jose Mart√≠. The final defining element of Darianian aesthetic is his admiration towards the symbolists, especially Paul Verlaine.The Parnassian and Symbolist influence in Dario's work, as well as in modernism in general, were so important that writers like Ricardo Gull√≥n have spoken about a \\"Parnassian direction\\" and a \\"symbolist direction\\" of modernism. (ref: Ricardo Gull√≥n, Direcciones del Modernismo Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 1990. .) Recapitulating his own poetic trajectory in the initial poem of Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905) Dar√≠o himself synthesized his main influences when he affirms that he was \\"strong with Hugo and ambiguous with Verlaine\\" (\\"con Hugo fuerte y con Verlaine ambiguo\\".) In the section \\"Palabras Liminares\\" of Prosas Profanas (1896) he had already written a paragraph that reveals the importance of French culture in the development of his literary work: > The old Spaniard with a white beard points towards a series of illustrious > portraits: \\"This one‚Äîhe says‚Äîis the great Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, one- > handed genius; this one is Lope de Vega, this one is Garcilaso, this one > Quintana.\\" I ask him for the noble man Graci√°n, for Teresa of √Åvila, for the > brave G√≥ngora and the strongest of all, Francisco de Quevedo y Villegas. > Then I say: \\"Shakespeare! Dante! Hugo...! (and in my head: Verlaine...!)\\" > Then, when saying goodbye: \\"-Old man, it is important to say: my wife is > from my land; my mistress is from Paris.\\"El abuelo espa√±ol de barba blanca > me se√±ala una serie de retratos ilustres: \\"√âste‚Äîme dice‚Äîes el gran don > Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, genio y manco; √©ste es Lope de Vega, √©ste > Garcilaso, √©ste Quintana.\\" Yo le pregunto por el noble Graci√°n, por Teresa > la Santa, por el bravo G√≥ngora y el m√°s fuerte de todos, don Francisco de > Quevedo y Villegas. Despu√©s exclamo: \\"¬°Shakespeare! ¬°Dante! ¬°Hugo...! (Y en > mi interior: ¬°Verlaine...!)\\" > Luego, al despedirme: \\"‚ÄîAbuelo, preciso es dec√≠roslo: mi esposa es de mi > tierra; mi querida, de Par√≠s. Taken and translated from Prosas profanas Los raros is an illustrative volume regarding literary tastes, which he published on the same year as Prosas profanas, and dedicated to briefly glossing some of the writers and intellectuals towards whom he felt profound admiration. Amongst those in the book we find Edgar Allan Poe, Villiers de l'Isle Adam, L√©on Bloy, Paul Verlaine, Lautr√©amont, Eug√©nio de Castro and Jos√© Mart√≠ (the latter being the only one mentioned who wrote their literary work in Spanish.) The predominance of French culture is more than evident. Dar√≠o wrote: \\"Modernism is nothing more than Spanish verse and prose passed through the fine sieve of the good French verse and the good French prose.\\" Setting aside his initial stage, before Azul..., in which his poetry owes a great deal to the great names of 19th-century Spanish poetry, such as N√∫√±ez de Arce and Campoamor, Dar√≠o was a great admirer of B√©cquer. Spanish themes are well represented in his work, already in Prosas profanas and, specially, after his second trip to Spain, in 1899. Conscious of contemporaneous Spanish decadence in politics and the arts (a preoccupation he shared with the so-called Generation of '98), he frequently was inspired by characters and elements of the past. Regarding authors in other languages, it is worth mentioning that he felt a profound admiration towards three writers from the United States: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman. Assessment Roberto Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a considers him the beginning of the modern era in Spanish language poetry: \\"In Spanish, there is poetry before and after Rub√©n Dar√≠o. ... the first major poet in the language since the 17th century ... He ushered Spanish-language poetry into the modern era by incorporating the aesthetic ideals and modern anxieties of Parnassiens and Symbolism, as Garcilaso had infused Castilian verse with Italianate forms and spirit in the 16th century, transforming it forever.Roberto Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, The Master of Modernismo, The Nation, posted January 25, 2006 (February 13, 2006 issue, pp. 29‚Äì33) Dar√≠o led one of the most profound poetic revolutions in Spanish according to Latin American poets Octavio Paz, who wrote a prologue to a translation of Dar√≠o's selected poems, and Giannina Braschi, who features Dar√≠o as a character in her works. Evolution The evolution of Dar√≠o's poetry is marked by the publication of the books in which scholars have recognized his fundamental works: Azul... (1888), Prosas profanas y otros poemas (1896) y Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905). Before Azul... Dar√≠o wrote three books and a great number of loose poems which make up what is known as his \\"literary prehistory\\" (\\"prehistoria literaria\\".) The books are Ep√≠stolas y poemas (written in 1885, but published until 1888, under the title Primeras notas), Rimas (1887) and Abrojos (1887). In the first of these works his readings of Spanish classics is patent, as is the stamp of Victor Hugo. The metric is classicd√©cimas, romances, estancias, tercetos encadenados, en versos predominantemente heptas√≠labos, octos√≠labos y endecas√≠labos and the tone is predominantly romantic. In Abrojos, published in Chile, the most acknowledged influence is that from the Spaniard Ram√≥n de Campoamor.Rafael Soto Verg√©s: \\"Rub√©n Dar√≠o y el neoclasicismo (La est√©tica de Abrojos), in Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos, n¬∫ 212‚Äì213 (agosto-septiembre de 1967). Rimas, also published in Chile in the same year, was written for a contest to imitate the B√©cquer's Rimas, hence, it is not strange that the intimate tone adopted in this book is very similar to the one present in the writings of the Sevillian poet. It consists of only fourteen poems, of amorous tone, whose expressive means(estrofas de pie quebrado, anaphoras, antithesis, etc.) are characteristically b√©cquerian.Let it be clear that Rub√©n Dar√≠o was a great admiror of B√©cquer, whom he knew since at least 1882 (ref: Juan Collantes de Ter√°n, \\"Rub√©n Dar√≠o\\", in Luis √ç√±igo Madrigal (ed.), Historia de la Literatura Hispanoamericana, Tomo II: Del Neoclasicismo al Modernismo. Madrid: C√°tedra, 1987 (); pp. 603‚Äì32) Azul... (1888) has as many tales in prose as poems, which caught the critics' attention through their metric variety. It presents us some of the preoccupations characteristic of Dario, such as his expression of dissatisfaction towards the bourgeoisie (see, for example, the tale \\"El rey burgu√©s\\") A new edition of the text was published in 1890, this one was augmented with several new texts, amongst which were sonnets in Alexandrine verses. Modernism's stage of plenitude and of the Darian poetry is marked by the book Prosas profanas y otros poemas, a collection of poems in which the presence of the erotic is more important, and which contains some esoteric themes (such as in the poem \\"Coloquio de los centauros\\"). In this book, we can also find Dar√≠o's own eclectic imagery. In 1905, he published Cantos de vida y esperanza, which announces a more intimate and reflexive trend in his works, without renouncing to the themes that have become linked to the identity of Modernism. At the same time, civic poetry appears in his work, with poems like \\"A Roosevelt\\", a trend that would be accentuated in El canto errante (1907) and in Canto a la Argentina y otros poemas (1914). Legacy *In honor of the centenary of Dar√≠o's birth in 1867, the government of Nicaragua struck a 50 cordoba gold medal and issued a set of postage stamps. The commemorative set consists of eight airmail stamps (20 centavos depicted) and two souvenir sheets. *There is a Rub√©n Dar√≠o street and a Rub√©n Dar√≠o museum, and his face appears on statues, paintings, and lottery tickets in his homeland of Nicaragua. The National Library of Nicaragua Rub√©n Dar√≠o was renamed in his honour. * There is a Rub√©n Dar√≠o Plaza and a Rub√©n Dar√≠o metro station in Madrid, Spain. * The Spanglish novel Yo-Yo Boing! (1998) by Giannina Braschi features an argument about Rub√©n Dar√≠o's genius versus that of other Spanish language poets Quevedo, G√≥ngora, Pablo Neruda, and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. *The postcolonial novel United States of Banana (2011) by Giannina Braschi features Rub√©n Dar√≠o as a character and credits him with inspiring the book which begins with an epigraph by him: ‚ÄúIf Hamlet grieves, Segismundo feels it.‚Äù *There is a Rub√©n Dar√≠o train station in the General Urquiza Railway in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

He began playing chess at the age of 10, and by 1890 (aged 13) was one of the leading players in Montreal. Marshall at the St. Louis tournament (1904), which he won He won the 1904 Cambridge Springs International Chess Congress (scoring 13/15, ahead of World Champion Emanuel Lasker) and the U.S. congress in 1904, but did not get the national title because the U.S. champion at that time, Harry Nelson Pillsbury, did not compete. In 1906 Pillsbury died and Marshall again refused the championship title until he won it in competition in 1909. In 1907 he played a match against World Champion Emanuel Lasker for the title and lost eight games, winning none and drawing seven. They played their match in New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Chicago, and Memphis from January 26 to April 8, 1907. In 1909 he agreed to play a match with then young Cuban chess player Jos√© Capablanca and, to most people's surprise, lost eight games, drew fourteen, and won only one. After this defeat, Marshall did not resent Capablanca; instead, he realized the young man had immense talent and deserved recognition. The American champion worked hard to ensure Capablanca had the chance to play at the highest levels of competition. Marshall insisted that Capablanca be permitted to enter the San Sebasti√°n tournament in 1911, an exclusive championship promising to be one of the strongest yet in history. Despite much protest at his inclusion, Capablanca won the tournament. Marshall finished fifth at the St. Petersburg tournament in 1914, behind World Champion Lasker, future World Champions Capablanca and Alekhine, and former World Championship challenger Tarrasch, but ahead of the players who did not qualify for the final: Ossip Bernstein, Rubinstein, Nimzowitsch, Blackburne, Janowski, and Gunsberg. According to Marshall's 1942 autobiography, which was reportedly ghostwritten by Fred Reinfeld, Tsar Nicholas II conferred the title of \\"Grandmaster\\" on Marshall and the other four finalists. Chess historian Edward Winter has questioned this, stating that the earliest known sources that support this story are Marshall's autobiography and an article by Robert Lewis Taylor in the June 15, 1940, issue of The New Yorker.Chess Note 5144, by Edward Winter In 1915 Marshall opened the Marshall Chess Club in New York City. In 1925 Marshall appeared in the short Soviet film Chess Fever in a cameo appearance along with Capablanca. In the 1930s Marshall captained the U.S. team to four gold medals at four Chess Olympiads. During one round, he returned to the board and found that his teammates had agreed to three draws. After he finished his own game, he gave each of them a stern talk individually on how draws do not win matches. In 1936, after holding the U.S. championship title for 27 years, he relinquished it to the winner of a championship tournament. The first such tournament was sponsored by the National Chess Federation and held in New York. The Marshall Chess Club donated the trophy, and the first winner was Samuel Reshevsky. Assessment Marshall was best known for his great tactical skill. One aspect of this was the \\"Marshall swindle\\", where a trick would turn a lost game around. Andrew Soltis writes that, \\"In later years his prowess at rescuing the irretrievable took on magical proportions\\".Andy Soltis, Frank Marshall, United States Chess Champion: A Biography with 220 Games, McFarland & Company, 1994, p. 168. . Not so well known now, but appreciated in his day, was his endgame skill. Opening theory Frank Marshall has a number of chess opening variations named after him. Two gambit variations that are still theoretically important today are named after him. One is the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d5). Marshall's first well-known game with this opening was against Jos√© Capablanca in 1918, although Marshall had previously played it in other games that did not gain widespread attention. Even though Capablanca won in a game widely regarded as a typical example of his defensive genius, Marshall's opening idea became quite popular. Black gets good attacking chances and scores close to 50 percent with the Marshall, an excellent result for Black. The Marshall Attack is so respected that many top players often choose to avoid it with \\"Anti-Marshall\\" variations such as 8.a4. During his early career, Marshall was primarily known as a colorful tactical player in the Morphy tradition. When playing the White pieces, he normally used e4 openings such as King's Gambit and Vienna Game. As Black, he favored the Albin Countergambit as an answer to the Queen's Gambit. By the 1920s, most elite chess players had switched entirely to d4 openings and a more positional style of play, and Marshall changed his playing style to adapt to the times. In his later years, he often used the Caro‚ÄìKann Defense and Indian Defenses. An important gambit in the Semi-Slav Defense is also named after Marshall. That Marshall Gambit begins 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 e6 4.e4 The main line runs 4...dxe4 5.Nxe4 Bb4+ 6.Bd2 (6.Nc3 saves the pawn but is not considered dangerous) Qxd4 7.Bxb4 Qxe4+ 8.Be2 with and unclear play. Another opening named after Marshall is the Marshall Defense to the Queen's Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4 Nf6). It is generally considered inferior to the Queen's Gambit Declined (2...e6), Slav Defense (2...c6), and Queen's Gambit Accepted (2...dxc4).

He believed in the idea that cultural innovations occur only once and that they spread geographically. Based on this, he traced the origins of many cultural and traditional practices across the world, including the New World, to ideas that he believed came from Egypt and in some instances from Asia. An expert on brain anatomy, he was the first to study Egyptian mummies using radiological techniques. He took an interest in extinct humanoids and was embroiled in controversy over the authenticity of the Piltdown Man. Professional career Smith was born in Grafton, New South Wales to Stephen Sheldrick Smith who had moved to Australia from London in 1860 and Mary Jane, n√©e Evans. He received his early education from Grafton Public School where his father was headmaster. When the family moved to Sydney in 1883 he went to Darlington Public School before joining Sydney Boys High School. He attended evening classes on physiology by Thomas Anderson Stuart and took an early interest in biology. In an autobiographical note Smith noted that Stuart had shown them the convolutions of the human brain and declared that nobody understood them fully. Smith decided at that point that he would work towards understanding them. Accordingly, he went to study medicine at the University of Sydney in 1888 and received a Doctor of Medicine in 1895, with a dissertation on the fore-brain of the monotremes) and developed an interest in the anatomy of the human brain. He received a James King travelling scholarship and went to St John's College, Cambridge, graduating BA in 1896. Afterwards he catalogued the human brain-collection of the British Museum. Smith obtained an appointment at the Cairo School of Medicine in 1900 on the suggestion of his anthropologist friend Alexander Macalister. Smith became archaeological advisor to the archaeological survey of Nubia in the wake of plans to construct the Aswan Dam which threatened to drown numerous archaeological sites. Smith conducted investigations on the brains of Egyptian mummies. He was the first to non-destructively use x-rays to study mummies. Smith took a special interest in the pathologies indicated in ancient skeletal remains. He noted for instance that many Egyptian skulls had biparietal thinning which had been common in European aristocrats in the past. Smith hypothesized this was the result of wearing heavy wigs or headgear. From 1909 to 1919 he was Professor in anatomy in Manchester,A report in The Times in 1912 headed \\"Conversazione of the Royal Society: recent advances in science\\" mentions the exhibition of \\"the desiccated brain of an aboriginal Tasmanian\\". The Times, Thursday, 9 May 1912; pg. 4; Issue 39894; col A : \\"A rather gruesome exhibit was that of Professor Elliot Smith, the desiccated brain of an aboriginal Tasmanian, believed to be the only Tasmanian brain now in existence.\\" 1919‚Äì1937 he held the chair of Anatomy at the University College London. He was elected President of the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland for 1924 to 1927. During World War I he took an interest in the neurology of shell shock, visiting military hospitals and serving on the British General Medical Council. Smith was the leading specialist on the evolution of the brain of his day. Many of his ideas on the evolution of the primate brain still form the core of present scholarship. He proposed the following stages of development: # a smell-dominated insectivore of the jumping shrew-type # vision-dominated animals with an expanded cortex of tree- shrew-type # acutely visioned, manually dexterous mammals of tarsius-type # monkeys # anthropoids using their hands to use and produce tools Honours and awards Smith was decorated by the Khedive of Egypt, Abbas Hilmy in 1909 with an Insignia of the Third Class of the Imperial Ottoman Order of the Osmaniah.Edinburgh Gazette, July 8, 1910. p. 720. He became Fellow of the Royal Society in 1907, FRCP, cross of the French Legion of Honour, and was knighted in 1934. In 1912 he received the Royal Medal of the Royal Society, in 1930 the Honorary Gold Medal of the Royal College of Surgeons, in 1936 the Huxley Memorial Medal from the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. European hypothesis British anthropologists Arthur Keith and Grafton Elliot Smith both supported the European origin of humankind as opposed to models of Asian and African origin. In several of his works, Smith argued that Europe was the cradle of humanity, identifying a European Mediterranean race as the occupants of the original home of modern humans. His cradle was large, as he claimed the Mediterranean race had occupied the Levant, Egypt and western Europe, including the British Isles. He especially linked the Mediterranean race to the civilization of Egypt. Smith's arguments later became known as his theory of diffusionism. According to Smith and William James Perry, Egypt was the source of all cultural innovations and the ultimate source of human civilization. According to Smith, \\"Man did not become truly erect until his brain had developed in a very particular way to make it possible for him to use his hands\\". That line of reasoning reinforced the European origin of human, which Smith and Keith supported, as the mostly large brained specimens such as the Cro-Magnon had been found in Europe. Hyperdiffusionism The term 'hyperdiffusionism' seems to have been coined by the British archaeologist Glyn Daniel in his book The Idea of Prehistory (1962) with a somewhat derogatory intention. It was intended to represent extremes of diffusionism, a theme popular in early 20th century archaeology that itself has been subject to criticism. Smith believed that all megalithic phenomena, whether in Northwestern Europe, India, Japan or Mesoamerica, had originated in Ancient Egypt. \\"Small groups of people, moving mainly by sea, settled at certain places and there made rude imitations of the Egyptian monuments of the Pyramid Age.\\" (Smith 1911, ix). Smith believed in a direct diffusion to Syria, Crete, East Africa, Southern Arabia and Sumer, and other areas were influenced by secondary diffusion. The Neolithic culture of Europe was derived from Egypt as well, according to Smith. He even interpreted a mummy from a Torres Strait island as definitely being indicative of an Egyptian influence. The concept of hyperdiffusionism is now referred to by more neutral terms (when referring to the Americas) such as Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. Smith interpreted a small carving detail in Cop√°n stela B as an elephant, an animal unknown in the New World. Alfred Maudslay had described the detail as being a stylized tapir. Smith argued that the carving shows an elephant with a mahout atop it. He went on to point out many Asian features in the sculpture in his book Elephants and ethnologists (1924). =Egypt= Egypt held a fortunate geographical position that made contacts to western Asia and the Mediterranean possible, while being safe from invasions. The fertile soil led to ample leisure, in art and the crafts could be cultivated. Smith believed that agriculture had originated in Egypt and only later spread to Mesopotamia. \\"The earliest cultivators of the soil in Egypt were in fact laying the foundations not merely of agriculture and irrigation but of all the arts and craft, the social organization and religious beliefs which became an integral part of the civilization that was being built up sixty centuries ago and in later ages was diffused throughout the world.\\" (Smith 1911, 6) Cultural diffusion map from Egypt by Grafton Elliot Smith (1929). Artificial irrigation led to cooperation and the development of a central government that was based on professional knowledge, a rule of hydraulic engineers. The prosperity of everybody depended on a successful administration and a strong central government (cf. Karl Wittfogel's hydraulic hypothesis). Later on, the leading engineer became a sacred king (cf. Henri Frankfort) and a god (Osiris) after death. Ritual and magic formed the germs of the first sciences, of biology and physics. The building of tombs initiated the development of architecture. Other inventions of the Egyptians were: *Weaving *Metal working (gold and copper) *Calendar *Seagoing ships *\\"Art of shaving\\" *Wigs *Hats *Pillows The invention of metallurgy was the most important, as it quickened the pace of invention, widened the scope of human endeavour, stimulated the advancement of arts and crafts, and awakened courage and the spirit of great adventure. The search for copper was to become the most important factor in the universal spread of civilisation. Prospectors settled in foreign countries and introduced agriculture, burial customs, and their religion as well. At first, Smith remained vague on the reasons for the spread of Egyptian influence to places without mineral deposits like Polynesia. However, in 1915 William James Perry, a professor of comparative religion at the University of Manchester, advanced the view that the \\"megalith-builders\\" were looking for pearls and precious stones, which Smith adopted as well. Smith did not believe that the spread of culture was necessarily connected to a certain race, in contrast to other diffusionists, like the German prehistorian Gustaf Kossinna. While he saw a racial affinity between the Egyptians and the first agriculturalists of southern Europe, both being of the \\"brown race,\\" the spread of civilisation was mainly a spread of ideas, not of tribes or people. However, in The Ancient Egyptians and their Influence Upon the Civilization of Europe, written in 1911, he clearly demonstrates a steep rise in \\"Asiatic traits (Armenoid, Alpine, Celtic),\\" within the Egyptian aristocracy, to Dynastic Egypt itself (amongst other pre-historical phenomena). =History= In the age of Colonialism, hyperdiffusionism proved attractive, as it showed how missionaries, engineers and prospectors had spread civilisation all over the earth, as the colonial nations believed that they were doing themselves. Later on, hyperdiffusionism supplied a single simple explanation of the complex process of neolithisation that made it attractive to amateur archaeologists worldwide. It could be used to retain a Eurocentric view on history in the face of increasing evidence for impressive autochthonous development, such as in Zimbabwe (Great Zimbabwe), Polynesia (Easter Island), and Micronesia (Nan Madol on the island of Pohnpei). Now, it is widely believed that the megalithic graves of Britain, Ireland, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, Denmark, northern Germany, and Poland are much older than the Egyptian pyramids, and the Mesoamerican pyramids are more recent and considered to be local cultural innovations.  Private life  His father had migrated to New South Wales from London. He had attended a working men's college under John Ruskin and later became a teacher and headmaster in Grafton, New South Wales. His older brother (Stephen H. Smith) was later Director of Education in New South Wales; his younger brother (Stewart Arthur Smith) was Acting Professor of Anatomy at the University of Sydney.Royal College of Physicians - Lives of the fellows He married Kathleen Macreadie in 1902 just before moving to Cairo. During his time in London, he lived variously in Hampstead, Gower Street, and at Regent's Park. During his London years, he became a friend of Dr. W. H. R. Rivers. Smith's youngest son, Stephen Smith, died in an accident in 1936. Smith spent his final year in a nursing home in London. Grafton Smith died on New Year's Day 1 January 1937 at Broadstairs in Kent.

Creation and influence Their early network consisted of a number of \\"stations\\" worldwide including TOPY-CHAOS for Australia, TOPYNA for North America and TOPY Station 23 for the United Kingdom and Europe. Smaller, \\"grass-roots\\"-level sub-stations called Access Points were located throughout America and Europe.An Introduction to Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. Brighton, Sussex, UK: Temple Press Limited, 1989 Throughout its existence, TOPY has been an influential group in the underground chaos magic sceneGreer, John Michael; New Encyclopedia of the Occult, Llewellyn Publications, 2005 and in the wider western occult tradition.Burton, Tina. \\"Intuitive Magick?\\": A Study of the Temple ov Psy-chick Youth, 1981-1989. Unpublished paper in the American Religions Collection, Davidson Library, University of California‚ÄîSanta Barbara, 1989 P-Orridge's ironic cult of TOPY has been criticized as being a front for abuses of power and developing an actual cult of personality. Theory and praxis TOPY was regarded by its founders as a loose, worldwide network of individuals dedicated to liberating themselves from the shackles of societal control via magic and other methods of individuation. The manifestation of magical concepts in TOPY specifically lacked mysticism, the worship of \\"gods\\" and other magico-religious dogma. The group focuses on the psychic and magical aspects of the human brain linked with \\"guiltless sexuality\\". TOPY's research has covered both left hand and right hand ritual magic and elements of psychology, art and music. Brion Gysin, the Process Church of the Final Judgement, William S. Burroughs, Aleister Crowley and Austin Osman Spare stand out as major influences. Potential TOPY members were encouraged to make magical sigils of a certain proscribed nature. These acts were to be performed on the 23rd hour (11:00pm) of the 23rd day of each month. If an individual chose to do so, they were invited to mail their sigils to a central location where the magical energy in them could be used to enhance others. The reason for the use of the \\"TOPY cant\\", such as the spelling of \\"thee\\" and \\"ov\\" in the network's name, derives from the writings of Genesis P-Orridge, which advocate a deconstruction of \\"normal\\" or consensus modes of communication in order to achieve a more integrated understanding of the Self (a la the cutups of William S. Burroughs). The anonymity of individual members was frequently protected via the use of pseudonyms, often including the use of \\"Kali\\" for a female and \\"Eden\\" for a male member. Schisms In the early 1990s, a \\"rift\\" occurred within the network when Genesis P-Orridge of Psychic TV, one of the few founding members still involved at that time, and probably the most famous public face of TOPY during the 1980s, announced their departure from the organization.Thee Psychick Bible, 3rd Edition (2009) p500-522 2006 This was later exacerbated with Genesis P-Orridge later claiming to have shut down the network upon leaving and requesting that the group no longer use the registered trademark of the Psychick Cross. Some of the remaining members of the network chose not to go along with this and carried on with their activities. TOPY continued to grow and evolve throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century while Genesis P-Orridge moved on to other projects such as The Process, as well as a similar project to TOPY called Topi. In 2008, some members of TOPY evolved into the Autonomous Individuals Network (AIN). Others continue to work as individual autonomous creators and practitioners in the realm of chaos magick. AIN was built on the foundations of the TOPY network and \\"all the history and knowledge that community has gathered since its creation in the 1980s\\".as stated on the Autonomous Individuals Network official site In December 2010, Genesis P-Orridge activated the One True Topi Tribe, a reactivation of sorts of the original Temple Ov Psychick Youth, this time with focus on creating an intentional artists community. In 2016, Canadian-American director Jacqueline Castel began work on the feature-length documentary about TOPY, titled A Message from the Temple.

The uprising took place in the territories of the modern Tambov Oblast and part of the Voronezh Oblast, less than 300 miles southeast of Moscow. In Soviet historiography, the rebellion was referred to as the Antonovschina (\\"Antonov's mutiny\\"), so named after Alexander Antonov, a former official of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, who turned against the government of the Bolsheviks. It began in August 1920 with resistance to the forced confiscation of grain and developed into a guerrilla war against the Red Army, Cheka units and the Soviet Russian authorities. It is estimated that around 100,000 people were arrested and around 15,000 shot dead during the suppression of the uprising. The Red Army used chemical weapons to fight the peasants. The bulk of the peasant army was destroyed in the summer of 1921, smaller groups continued until the following year. The movement was later portrayed by the Soviets as anarchical banditry, similar to other anti-Soviet movements that opposed them during this period.  Background  Alexander Antonov (centre) and his staff The Soviet government had adopted the policy war communism during the Russian Civil War. Food for the needs of the cities was obtained by compulsory requisition from the villages without financial compensation. This was met with the resistance of the peasant population, especially as the requisitions were often violent in nature. Likewise, the amount of cereals to be requisitioned were not measured according to production. Instead, commissions gave a rough estimate based on pre-war production, so that devastation, crop failures, and population decline were not included. The peasants often responded by reducing their acreage, as they no longer had the economic incentive to produce surpluses. This made the confiscations ordered from above even more draconian. Unlike in the cities, the Bolsheviks had hardly any supporters in the rural regions, where in the various elections of 1917 the Socialist Revolutionaries had always won large majorities. For the most part, the peasants were indifferent to Bolshevik ideology. The Soviet politician Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, who himself later played a leading role in the suppression of the uprising, characterized the peasants as follows: The requisition policy was implemented among other places in the Tambov Governorate, a relatively wealthy agrarian region 350 km southeast of Moscow. The peasants of the Governorate had largely supported the October Revolution, since Lenin's Decree on Land legalized the expropriation of property. Nevertheless, the Bolsheviks had problems in maintaining control of the governorate. In March 1918, their delegates were even thrown out of the local Soviets when the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was concluded. Although they managed to consolidate their rule in the next few years, the use of force was necessary again and again, in increasingly greater degrees of intensity. Peter Scheibert: \\"Lenin in power ‚Äì the Russian people in the revolution of 1918‚Äì1922\\", Weinheim 1984, pp. 389‚Äì393. Before the revolution, the peasants in the governorate produced around one million tonnes of grain. Of these, one- third was exported. On the basis of these figures, which did not include the dislocations of the civil war in the countryside, a high target for the procurement of grain was set. By January 1921, only half of the grain had been collected. Antonov-Ovseyenko noticed from his own experience that every other farmer in Tambov was starving. The revolt began on 19 August 1920 in the small town of Khitrovo, where a military requisitioning detachment of the Red Army appropriated everything they could and \\"beat up elderly men of seventy in full view of the public\\". On 2 February 1921, the Soviet leadership announced the end of the \\"prodrazvyorstka\\", and issued a special decree directed at peasants from the region implementing the \\"prodnalog\\" policy. The new policy was essentially a tax on grain and other foodstuffs. This was done before the 10th Congress of the Bolsheviks, when the measure was officially adopted. The announcement began circulating in the Tambov area on 9 February 1921. The Tambov uprising and unrest elsewhere were significant reasons that the \\"prodnalog\\" policy was implemented and the \\"prodrazvyorstka\\" was abandoned.Landis, 2004. Outbreak In August 1920, the peasants' armed resistance to re-capture grain began in a village in the Tambov province called Chitrovo. The farmers refused to deliver their grain to the Bolsheviks and killed several members of the local procurement team. A Soviet government report summarized the reasons for the violence as follows: > The commandos were guilty of some abuses. On their passage they plundered > everything, even pillows and kitchen utensils. They shared the spoils and > beat old men of 70 years old in front of everyone. Elders were punished for > failing to catch their deserting sons who were hiding in the woods (...) > What also puzzled the peasants was the fact that the confiscated corn had > been carted to the nearest train station and left to spoil there in the open > air. In anticipation of an attack by the Red Army to enforce the procurement of grain, the farmers of the village armed themselves. Since only a few rifles were available, this was partly done with pitchforks and clubs. Other villages joined in the uprising against the Soviet authorities, and succeeded in repulsing the Red Army. One factor contributing to this success was the Red Army's involvement in the simultaneous Polish-Soviet War and crackdown on Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel's White Army in the Crimea, which resulted in the stationing of only about 3,000 Red Army soldiers in the Tambov region. These soldiers had been drafted from the local villages and often had little motivation to fight members of their own class. The peasants, after their first success, attempted to capture Tambov, the capital of the governorate. There, however, they failed to defeat the Red Army. It was here that Alexander Stepanovich Antonov, a radical Left Socialist-Revolutionary, led the movement into a guerilla war with the Reds. Before the uprising, Antonov and a few comrades had fought an underground insurrection against the Bolsheviks and had been sentenced to death. Since he was able to escape capture by the Soviet authorities, he was a kind of folk hero to the peasants. He demanded that the free trade and movement of goods should be allowed to end, that the grain requisitions should be ended and the Soviet administration and the Cheka dissolved. His troops carried out surprise raids on railway junctions, kolkhoz and the Soviet authorities. They were supported by the population and used the villages for cover and rest. Likewise, they often disguised themselves as Red Army soldiers to move about the countryside or to exaggerate the element of surprise. Socialist Revolutionaries in the Tambov region also founded a \\"League of Working Peasants\\", which was to function as the political organization of the insurgents and with which Antonov worked, even though he had left the party. Antonov organized the farmers on the model of the Red Army in 18‚Äì20 regiments with their own political commissars, reconnaissance departments and communication departments. Likewise, he introduced a strict discipline. The farmers used the Red flag as their standard and thus claimed the central symbol of the revolution. Georgi Zhukov, who commanded a cavalry squadron in battles with the rebels, described the strategy of the insurgents in his [memoirs]: Georgi K. Zhukov: Memories and Thoughts , Stuttgart 1969, p. 69 f. > The tactics of the Antonovschina amounted mostly to avoiding fights with > larger units of the Red Army. They engaged in battle only if absolute > certainty of victory existed and their own forces were superior. And if > necessary, skirmishes in small groups fighting from an unfavorable > situation, and only after they set down directions to re-group at an agreed > meeting place. They were able to control large parts of the region and managed to capture railway trains transporting requisitioned grain. The grain intended to supply Red Army units was instead re-distributed by Antonov's men to local farmers. The rebellion also spread to parts of other provinces: Voronezh, Saratov and Pensa. In the areas controlled by them, all Soviet institutions were abolished. Around 1,000 members of the Communist Party of Russia were killed by the insurgents. By October 1920, the Bolsheviks had completely lost control of the rural territory of the governorate, dominating only the city Tambov itself and a number of smaller urban settlements. After numerous deserters from the Red Army joined it, the peasant army numbered over 50,000 fighters. The rebel militia proved highly effective and even infiltrated the Tambov Cheka. The seriousness of the uprising caused the establishment of the \\"Plenipotentiary Commission of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Bolshevik Party for the Liquidation of Banditry in the Gubernia of Tambov\\". With the end of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War (in March 1921) and the defeat of General Wrangel in 1920, the Red Army could divert its regular troops into the area. Alexander Schlichter, Chairman of the Tambov Gubernia Executive Committee, contacted Vladimir Lenin.Lenin to Kornev, 19 October, 1920. Retrieved 21 June 2017. In January 1921 peasant revolts spread to Samara, Saratov, Tsaritsyn, Astrakhan and Siberia. In February, the peasant army reached its peak, numbering up to 70,000 and successfully defending the area against Bolshevik expeditions.  Suppression In August 1920, the governorate of Tambov imposed martial law. The official propaganda of the Bolsheviks tried to discredit the insurgents as bandits led by the Social Revolutionaries. According to internal reports by the Soviet authorities, the leadership was well aware that it was a spontaneous uprising of the peasants without a key role being played by the party. The central organs of the Socialist Revolutionary Party actually condemned the uprising publicly and banned its party members from supporting the rebels. However, this appeal found little resonance among local party members. They also did not stop the Cheka from starting a wave of repression against members of the party in the Tambov region. Insurgents were executed and several villages burned down. However, this could not stop the uprising. In February 1921, Vladimir Antonov- Ovseyenko was sent to Tambov as Chairman of a Plenipotentiary Commission to end the uprising. The commission reported directly to Lenin and was directly under his authority. Antonov-Ovseyenko targeted the civilian supporters of the rebels in the suppression of the insurgency. He ordered, with the prior approval of Lenin, a wave of deportations and hostage shootings. In May 1921 Mikhail Tukhachevsky was ordered by Lenin as military commander-in-chief to suppress the uprising in Tambov. Assigned to him were tanks, heavy artillery and 100,000 soldiers, mostly special units of the Cheka, with additional Red Army units. As many members as possible of the communist youth organization [Komsomol] were assigned to him because they were considered politically loyal. The Red Army used armoured trains and engaged in the summary execution of civilians. The rebels responded with assassination attempts on Tukhachevsky and Ovseyenko, and the kidnapping and shooting of family members of members of the Party and Red Army. The fighting with the partisans took on [civil] warlike proportions, and the resources and organizational structures that the Soviet government offered against them were similar to those of a front in the civil war. Zhukov described a battle with an insurgent union as follows: Georgi K. Zhukov: Memories and Thoughts, Stuttgart 1969, p. 72nd Antonov- Ovseyenko reacted to the counter-terror of the partisans by intensifying his own. Civilians who refused to give their names were shot without trial. If a weapon was found in a house, the oldest working member of the family was shot. The same was true for hiding insurgents‚Äîin this case, however, the family was additionally expropriated and deported. There was also a scheme to take children or orphans of rebels. In the case of the escape of a family from a village, they were expropriated, their house burned down and the movable property distributed among loyal peasants. In March 1921, the forced collection of grain in the insurgent regions was finally stopped. As a result, the willingness of the civilian population to support the rebels declined. By May 1921, Tukhachevsky, by systematic occupation of villages, succeeded in forcing the rebels more and more into the forest areas around Tambov, isolating them. In June, Tukhachevsky received permission from Antonov- Ovseyenko's commission to begin use of chemical weapons, by direct order from the leadership of Red Army and from the Communist Party.Publisher: Posev, 2004, B.V.Sennikov. Tambov rebellion and liquidation of peasants in Russia, Full text in Russian Publications in local Communist newspapers openly glorified liquidations of \\"bandits\\" with the poison gas. Tukhachevsky and Antonov-Ovseyenko signed an order to their troops, dated 12 June 1921, which stipulated: Antonov's army was encircled and destroyed. Antonov himself escaped, but was shot only a year later by Soviet authorities. In early September 1921, only scattered groups of insurgents still operated, estimated at around 1,000 armed men. It took until the middle of 1922 for the province to be pacified completely.  Consequences  The suppression of the uprising led to very heavy civilian casualties among the population. It is estimated that around 50,000 people, including some 1,000 children, were put in dedicated concentration camps in July 1921. They suffered severely from cholera and typhus epidemics. The death rate is estimated to be around 15‚Äì20% per month for the fall of 1921. Exact figures on the victims of the uprising are not available. A total estimate amounts to about 100,000 of the detainees and about 15,000 executed by the authorities. As a result of the military operations against the rebels, around 6,000 of their fighters surrendered and were either shot or deported. The deportees were transferred from the local camps to special camps in the northern regions of Russia after the suppression of the uprising. These camps were otherwise reserved for officers of the White Army and captured insurgents from Kronstadt. In these camps there was a particularly high mortality of prisoners compared to the rest of the camp system. The devastation of the fighting and punitive measures, together with the Bolshevik agricultural policy, led to a famine in the areas of the insurgents. In addition to Tambov, large parts of Russia were affected in the following two years. Sennikov estimated the total losses among the population of Tambov region in 1920 to 1922 resulting from the war, executions, and imprisonment in concentration camps as approximately 240,000. The uprising made the Soviet leadership aware of its failure to managed relations with the peasants and is seen as one of the factors that prompted Lenin to initiate the New Economic Policy. The Russian sociologist and contemporary witness Pitirim Sorokin even concluded that the insurgents had forced the NEP by their actions. Peter Scheibert: Lenin in power ‚Äì The Russian people in the revolution 1918‚Äì1922, Weinheim, 1984, p. 393. The new policy relied more on a natural tax on actual production instead of on compulsory collection of agricultural products. In the military field it is mentioned that the Soviet Army Commander Mikhail Frunze was impressed by the guerillas' resistance to regular forces. He therefore began studying guerrilla tactics as a commander in the Red Army. This is regarded as a precondition of the Soviet partisans' strategy in their World War II campaign against the Nazi invasion. Union of Working Peasants The Union of Working Peasants () was a local political organization that emerged from the rebellion in 1920. The organization was led by the former Social-Revolutionary politician Aleksandr Antonov. The goal of the organization was the 'overthrow of the government of Communist- Bolsheviks'.Kowalski, Ronald I. The Russian Revolution: 1917‚Äì1921. Routledge sources in history. London: Routledge, 1997. p. 232. In December 1920, the Union of Working Peasants released a manifesto, stating their intention to overthrow the Bolshevik government and their aims in doing so: Recovery of documents Some documents relating to the rebellion were found by the local ethnographer Boris Sennikov in 1982 while he was engaged in clearing sand from the altar of the Winter Church of the Kazan monastery.An illustrated article about Tambov revolt from Gulag website (Russian) During the 1920s, the monastery had been requisitioned for use as the local Cheka headquarters and the church had served as the archive of the Tambov Military Commissariat. In 1933, the local government decided to burn documents that could compromise the Soviet regime. However, during the process, the fire grew out of control and had to be extinguished by water and, crucially, sand. All documents in the archive were believed to be destroyed; as the church altar was not used by the archive, the surviving documents, covered by a layer of sand, have never been found. In 1982, the local archive changed its address and the church became abandoned. When Sennikov found the documents, the Tambov department of KGB opened a criminal case against him. Later, the case was closed, but Sennikov lost his job. In 2004, the publishing house Posev published the Sennikov archive as part of The Tambov Rebellion and the Liquidation of Russian Peasantry along with documents relating to the Governorate Military Commissariat (including those dealing with Konstantin Mamontov's 1919 anti- Bolshevik raid, and those describing the Great Purge of the 1930s). The documents also included Red Army orders issued during the rebellion, correspondence, reports of the use of chemical weapons against the peasant rebels, and documents of the Union of the Working Peasants. In popular culture * Some scenes of the rebellion are depicted in 2011 movie Once Upon a Time There Lived a Simple Woman by Andrei Smirnov. * Apricot Jam and Other Stories (2010) by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. In a short story about Marshal Georgy Zhukov's futile attempts at writing his memoirs, the retired Marshal reminisces about being a young officer fighting against the Union of Working Peasants. He recalls Mikhail Tukhachevsky's arrival to take command of the campaign and his first address to his men. He announced that total war and scorched earth tactics are to be used against civilians who assist or even sympathize with the Union. Zhukov recalls how Tukhachevsky's tactics were adopted and succeeded in breaking the uprising. In the process, however, they virtually depopulated the surrounding countryside.

Biography He was born at L'Aquila (Abruzzo), then part of the Kingdom of Naples. He was a great favourite with Charles V, at whose court he resided for thirty-three years, and by whom he was employed on various foreign missions. To a perfect knowledge of Greek and Latin he added an intimate acquaintance with several modern languages. In discovering and collating ancient manuscripts, for which his travels abroad gave him special opportunities, he displayed uncommon diligence. His work entitled Diatribae in Ausonium, Solinum et Ovidium (1524) is a monument of erudition and critical skill. He was the first editor of the Letters of Cassiodorus, with his Treatise on the Soul (1538); and his edition of Ammianus Marcellinus (1533) contains five books more than any former one. The affected use of antiquated terms, introduced by some of the Latin writers of that age, is humorously ridiculed by him, in a dialogue in which an Oscan, a Volscian and a Roman are introduced as interlocutors (1531). Accorso was accused of plagiarism in his notes on Ausonius, a charge which he most solemnly and energetically repudiated.

It is a Grade I listed building. It is used for some of the City of London's official functions, including two annual white tie dinners. At the Easter banquet, the main speaker is the Foreign Secretary, who then receives a reply from the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, i.e. the longest-serving ambassador. In early June, it is the turn of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give his \\"Mansion House Speech\\" about the state of the British economy. History An 1837 view showing one of the two high attics. They were nicknamed the \\"Mayor's Nest\\" and \\"Noah's Ark\\". An early 19th century banquet in the Egyptian Hall at the Mansion House A public session at the Mansion House, circa 1840 Mansion House was built between the years of 1739 and 1752, in the Palladian style by the surveyor and architect George Dance the Elder. The site, at the east end of Poultry, London, had previously been occupied by the Stocks Market, which by the time of its closure was mostly used for the sale of herbs. The construction was prompted by a wish to put an end to the inconvenient practice of lodging the Lord Mayor in one of the City Halls. Dance won a competition over designs solicited from James Gibbs and Giacomo Leoni, and uninvited submissions by Batty Langley and Isaac Ware. Construction was slowed down by the discovery of springs on the site, which meant piles had to be sunk to lay adequate foundations. The original building had two clerestory roof extensions, nicknamed the \\"Mayor's Nest\\" (a pun on \\"mare's nest\\") and \\"Noah's Ark\\". In 1795 George Dance the Younger re-roofed the central courtyard, and had the \\"Noah's Ark\\" demolished. In the same year, the original grand staircase was removed to make way for a further two rooms. In 1835 the entrance steps were reduced to one flight, and in 1842 the \\"Mayor's Nest\\" was demolished after the ballroom was reconstructed. The Lord Mayor's private entrance in Walbrook was created in 1845, and in 1849 the former Swordbearer's Room was converted into the Justice Room, effectively the magistrates' court of the City, until 1999 when the court removed to a building on the opposite side of Walbrook. Funding Mansion House was paid for in an unusual way: the City authorities, all Church of England men, found a way to tax those of other Christian denominations, particularly the Rational Dissenters. A Unitarian named Samuel Sharpe, banker by day and amateur Egyptologist by night, wrote about it in the 1830s, striking a blow against the Test and Corporate Acts. The article was republished in 1872. Sharpe argues that Mansion House \\"remains as a monument of the unjust manner in which Dissenters were treated in the last century\\" (i.e. the 18th, in contrast to his own 19th, century). William Edward Hartpole Lecky in his History of England during the Eighteenth Century (1878) describes the funding of the construction of Mansion House as \\"a very scandalous form of persecution\\". There are over one hundred livery companies, the senior members of which form a special electorate known as Common Hall. In 1748 the City of London Corporation devised a Catch-22 situation to raise money, passing a by-law levying a heavy fine on any man who refused to stand for election, or who, once elected to office, refused to serve. In order to serve as a Sheriff of the City of London, the individual had to have \\"taken the sacrament according to the Anglican rite\\" within the past year. This was exactly what English Dissenters could not, in conscience, do. \\"It would appear almost incredible, if the facts were not widely attested, that under these circumstances the City of London systematically elected wealthy Dissenters to the office in order that they should be objected to and fined, and that in this manner it extorted no less than ¬£15,000. The electors appointed these Dissenters with a clear knowledge that they would not serve, and with the sole purpose of extorting money. One of those whom they selected was blind; another was bedridden.\\" Some tried to appeal, but the process was immensely risky and costly, with the City holding all the cards. Eventually a man named Evans began a challenge which lasted ten years; in 1767, the House of Lords, drawing on the Toleration Act 1688, agreed with Lord Mansfield and ruled to curtail the City's abuse of power. (See Harrison v. Evans (1767), 3 Bro. Parl. Cas. 465.) In order to avoid civil disabilities such as this financially ruinous persecution, some Dissenters were known to take Communion in their parish church once a year; in the phraseology of the time, \\"occasional conformity\\" (see Occasional Conformity Act 1711). Thomas Abney rose to be Lord Mayor in this fashion. The American author Mark Twain recounts the story in his own inimitable style in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889): > It reminded me of something I had read in my youth about the ingenious way > in which the aldermen of London raised the money that built the Mansion > House. A person who had not taken the Sacrament according to the Anglican > rite could not stand as a candidate for sheriff of London. Thus Dissenters > were ineligible; they could not run if asked, they could not serve if > elected. The aldermen, who without any question were Yankees in disguise, > hit upon this neat device: they passed a by-law imposing a fine of ¬£400 upon > any one who should refuse to be a candidate for sheriff, and a fine of ¬£600 > upon any person who, after being elected sheriff, refused to serve. Then > they went to work and elected a lot of Dissenters, one after another, and > kept it up until they had collected ¬£15,000 in fines; and there stands the > stately Mansion House to this day, to keep the blushing citizen in mind of a > long past and lamented day when a band of Yankees slipped into London and > played games of the sort that has given their race a unique and shady > reputation among all truly good and holy peoples that be in the earth. Architecture The Egyptian Hall in 2011 Mansion House has three main storeys over a rusticated basement. The entrance facade has a portico with six Corinthian columns, supporting a pediment with a tympanum sculpture by Sir Robert Taylor, in the centre of which is a symbolic figure of the City of London trampling on her enemies. The building originally had two prominent and unusual attic structures at either end, which were removed in 1794 and 1843. The building is on a confined site. Sir John Summerson wrote that \\"it leaves an impression of uneasily constricted bulk\\", adding that \\"on the whole, the building is a striking reminder that good taste was not a universal attribute in the eighteenth century\\". The main reception room, the columned \\"Egyptian Hall\\", was so named because Dance used an arrangement of columns deemed to be \\"Egyptian\\" by Vitruvius. No Egyptian motifs were employed. It has twenty niches for sculpture. There was originally an open courtyard, later occupied by a saloon. The residence used to have its own court of law, since the Lord Mayor is the chief magistrate of the City while in office. There were eleven holding cells (ten for men and one, nicknamed \\"the birdcage\\", for women). A famous prisoner here was the early 20th-century suffragette women's rights campaigner Sylvia Pankhurst. Art collection Mansion House is home to the Harold Samuel Collection of Dutch and Flemish Seventeenth Century Paintings, described as \\"the finest collection of such works to be formed in Britain this century\\" (Sutton 1992). It consists of 84 paintings and includes some outstanding works by artists including Hendrick Avercamp, Gerard Ter Borch, Pieter Claesz, Aelbert Cuyp, Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Jacob van Ruisdael, Jan Steen, David Teniers the Younger and Willem van de Velde. Mansion House also houses a plate collection, which includes among other treasures, the five ceremonial City of London swords. Public access Mansion House is not generally open to the public. However, tours can be arranged through the diary office, and there are public tours most Tuesdays. Mansion House Street Mansion House Street is the short street at the front of Mansion House, which connects Poultry, Queen Victoria Street and Bank junction above Bank Underground station. Other Guildhall is another venue used for important City functions. NotesReferences * Sutton, P.

It was later succeeded by the PC1640. It launched for ¬£499 and sold very well, as it was one of the first cheap PCs in Europe. It significantly helped open up the European PC market to consumers as well as businesses, and Amstrad's advertising of the PC1512 was aimed at homes rather than offices. The 1512's influence was such that the UK PC magazine PC Plus originally targeted itself at the \\"Amstrad PC 1512 and compatibles\\", since home ownership of other PCs at the time was rare. The PC1512 shipped with 512 KB of RAM; it could be upgraded to 640 KB of RAM with 16 pieces of 4164-120 Dynamic RAM chips (64KBx1 per chip) and setting a jumper. Video output was compatible with the CGA standard, with an extension allowing all 16 colours to be used in the 640√ó200 graphics mode. The CPU of both the PC1512 and the later PC1640 was an 8 MHz Intel 8086, which was sufficient for playing The Secret of Monkey Island, Maniac Mansion and Prince of Persia. The power supply was located in the monitor, which made upgrading difficult. Amstrad PC15212 in its original configuration, Performance as tested with CheckIt Amstrad licensed both MS-DOS 3.2 and Digital Research DOS Plus, which was largely compatible with MS-DOS and included some features from CP/M and the ability to read CP/M disks. Only one of these operating systems could be used at a time. They also licensed the GEM windowing system, which supported the customized CGA hardware of the 1512. The PC1512 was followed by the PC1640, which had 640 KB of RAM and an EGA- compatible graphics chipset (though only the ECD model could display all EGA modes). Either model shipped with one or two 5¬º-inch floppy drives, and optionally a hard drive (either 10 or 20 MB). Amstrad also attempted to expand its market share by selling computers in the United States. In the US the PC1512 was marketed as the PC6400 and included a 20 MB hard drive and the RAM upgrade to 640 KB. The PC1512 was also sold as the Sinclair PC500. The input devices supplied with the machine were notable. The mouse was an Amstrad Mouse, which was incompatible with serial mice common at the time. It was supported by some games, including Elite, but many DOS programs had problems with it. The keyboard sported an Atari-compatible joystick port for digital joysticks. Joystick movements and buttons were mapped to unused keyboard codes, allowing the joystick to be used in many DOS games that were written for keyboard control. The series was somewhat unusual for the fact that it had a physical volume control on the internal speaker. This allowed the user to make the machine beep quietly, or silently, from boot time onwards. This innovation is still not present in most modern PCs: the legacy beeper is typically still a fixed-volume device. Whereas IBM's PC (and almost all PC compatibles) had a power supply in a corner of the main case, the PC1512's power supply was integrated with that of its monitor. The monitor had sufficient venting to cool itself by convection, instead of needing a fan. The PC1512 was therefore quieter than other PCs. Rumours circulated that an Amstrad PC would overheat, and while existing owners would note that this did not happen, new buyers were discouraged. As a result, later models had a cooling fan integrated into the main case. Another example of rumour was the suggestion that there were issues with the 'unshielded' power supply in the monitor affecting an optional hard drive that could be installed at the back of the base unit and further that this would be solved by taping tin foil or aluminum foil over the back of the base unit or the bottom of the monitor to shield the hard drive.

He was an author and supported the Glorious Revolution. He had considerable political influence in Ireland, including for a time what amounted to a veto on judicial appointments. Early life King was born in May 1650 in County Antrim; his parents were recent settlers from Aberdeen. He was educated at The Royal School, Dungannon, County Tyrone, and thereafter at Trinity College, Dublin, graduating BA on 23 February 1670 and MA in 1673. Career On 25 October 1671, King was ordained a deacon as chaplain to John Parker, archbishop of Tuam, and on 14 July 1673 Parker gave him the prebend of Kilmainmore, County Mayo. King, who lived as part of Parker's household, was ordained a priest on 12 April 1674. His support of the Glorious Revolution in 1688 served to advance his position. He became Bishop of Derry in 1691. He was advanced to the position of Archbishop of Dublin in 1703, a post he would hold until his death. He gave ¬£1,000 for the founding of \\"Archbishop King's Professorship of Divinity\\" at Trinity College in 1718. Much of his correspondence survives and provides a historic resource for the study of the Ireland of his time. He died in May 1729. King's years as a bishop were marked by reform and the building of churches and glebe houses, and by the dispensing of charity. He was generally regarded as a man of sense and good judgment, and his political influence was considerable: he was always consulted on judicial appointments and at times seems to have had an effective veto over candidates he considered unsuitable. His influence declined after the appointment of Hugh Boulter as Archbishop of Armagh in 1724, as Boulter was also consulted on judicial appointments, and the two could rarely agree on a suitable candidate. Boulter's preferment to Armagh, passing over his own more obvious claims, was a bitter disappointment to him. He took a petty revenge at their first meeting by refusing to get up from his chair, saying that he was too old to stand. He was a vocal opponent of Wood's halfpence during the 1720s. Works As a man of letters he wrote The State of the Protestants in Ireland under King James's Government in 1691 and De Origine Mali in 1702, translated into English with extensive notes by Edmund Law in 1731 as An Essay on the Origin of Evil; it was also subject to a well-known critical discussion by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, published as an appendix to Leibniz's Th√©odic√©e.

Spiegel (November 11, 1901December 31, 1985) was an American independent film producer born in Polish speaking part of Austria-Hungary. Financially responsible for some of the most critically acclaimed motion pictures of the twentieth century, Spiegel's films won the Academy Award for Best Picture three times, a Hollywood first for a sole independent producer. Early life Spiegel was born to a Jewish family in Jaros≈Çaw, Galicia, Austria-Hungary (until 1772 in Polish Crown, now in Poland). His parents were Regina and Simon Spiegel, a tobacco wholesaler. He received his education at the University of Vienna. His brother was Shalom Spiegel, a professor of medieval Hebrew poetry. Career Spiegel worked briefly in Hollywood in 1927 following a stint serving with Hashomer Hatzair in Palestine. He then went to Berlin to produce German and French adaptations of Universal films until 1933 when he fled Germany. As an independent producer, Spiegel helped produce a number of European films. In 1938, he emigrated to Mexico and subsequently the United States. Between 1935 and 1954, Spiegel billed himself as S. P. Eagle; after that he used his real name. His nickname was the \\"velvet octopus\\" after his propensity to entwine himself with women in the back of taxis and manage Hollywood with a velvet touch according to Billy Wilder. He loved London and admired the British, as is reflected in his films The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962), both of which won seven Academy Awards including Best Picture. Starting with the 1951 film The African Queen, he produced films through his British-based production company Horizon Pictures. In a review in Variety of a Natasha Fraser-Cavassoni's biography of Spiegel, Wendy Smith notes: \\"It's all here: the sleazy financial maneuvers and creepy taste for underage girls that make Spiegel a decidedly flawed protagonist, as well as the wit, sophistication, and Old World charm that make him a titanic figure the likes of which the movie industry will not see again\\" Awards Spiegel won the Academy Award for Best Picture for Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront and a further two times for his two collaborations with British director David Lean, The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962). In 1963, he was awarded the Irving Thalberg Memorial Award at that year's Academy Awards for his many contributions to cinema. Sexual misconduct allegations American actress Theresa Russell alleged that she was sexually propositioned by Spiegel during her first casting session for his 1976 film The Last Tycoon. In another interview, Russell recalled: \\"I was 16 years old and still living at home, and he took me to the Bistro and tried to stick his tongue down my throat.\\" After she refused to sign a contract with Spiegel, Russell \\"was completely left out of the publicity for [The Last Tycoon]\\", and Spiegel threatened that he would prevent Russell from working again in Hollywood. Personal life Spiegel maintained a connection with Israel throughout his life, particularly with such personalities as Golda Meir, Ariel Sharon, Jerusalem Foundation president Ruth Cheshin (mother of Mishael Cheshin), and his close friend, then Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek. Spiegel also contributed to various Zionist causes. He spoke eight languages fluently: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Hebrew and Yiddish.Sam Spiegel appearance on What's My Line?, episode 818.

The use of the term is considered offensive and racist.  Etymology  Various dictionaries provide different etymologies of the word chink; for example, that it originated from the Chinese courtesy ching-ching, that it evolved from the word China, or that it was an alteration of Qing (Ch'ing), as in the Qing dynasty. Another possible origin is that chink evolved from the Indo-Iranian word for China ultimately deriving from the name of the Qing dynasty. That word is now pronounced similarly in various Indo- European languages.  History  The Iron Chink, a machine that guts and cleans salmon for canning, alongside a Chinese fishplant worker, was marketed as a replacement for fish-butchers, who were primarily Chinese immigrants The first recorded use of the word chink is from approximately 1880. As far as is ascertainable, its adjective form, chinky, first appeared in print in 1878. Around the turn of the 20th century, many white North-Americans perceived Chinese immigration as a threat to their living standards. However, Chinese workers were still desired on the West Coast due to a persistent labor shortage. Chinese butcher crews were held in such high esteem that when Edmund A. Smith patented his mechanized fish-butchering machine in 1905, he named it the Iron Chink which is seen by some as symbolic of anti-Chinese racism during the era.HistoryLink.org- the Free Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History Usage of the word continued, such as with the story \\"The Chink and the Child,\\" by Thomas Burke, which was later adapted to film by D.W. Griffith. Griffith altered the story to be more racially sensitive and renamed it to Broken Blossoms. Although chink refers to those appearing to be of Chinese descent, the term has also been directed towards people of other East and Southeast Asian ethnicities. Literature and film about the Vietnam war contain examples of this usage, including the film Platoon (1986) and the play Sticks and Bones (1971, also later filmed).http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Platoon.html Accessed 31 March 2007.New York Times, 26 April 1971, p. 10.  Controversy = Australia  Racism against Chinese people exists in Australia, as in other English-speaking countries. The terms Chinaman and chink became intertwined, as some Australians used both with hostile intent when referring to members of the country's Chinese population, which had swelled significantly during the Gold Rush era of the 1850s and 1860s. Assaults on Chinese miners and racially motivated riots and public disturbances were not infrequent occurrences in Australia's mining districts in the second half of the 19th century. There was some resentment, too, of the fact that Chinese miners and laborers tended to send their earnings back home to their families in China rather than spending them in Australia and supporting the local economy. In the popular Sydney Bulletin magazine in 1887, one author wrote: \\"No nigger, no chink, no lascar, no kanaka (laborer from the South Pacific islands), no purveyor of cheap labour, is an Australian.\\"Hughes, Geoffrey. An Encyclopedia of Swearing. Armonk, New York: M.E. Sharpe, 2006. Eventually, since-repealed federal government legislation was passed to restrict non-white immigration and thus protect the jobs of Anglo-Celtic Australian workers from \\"undesirable\\" competition.  Canada  On July 19, 2020, a man in Calgary was arrested after spitting on a woman of Asian descent and shouted the racial slur \\"stupid chink\\" while riding on his bicycle. The man identified as Justin Riaz Williams was a basketball manager at the University of Calgary who was sacked from his job before the COVID-19 pandemic after staff found screenshots of him using homophobic and racial slurs on his phone. Jessica Lau, the victim, uploaded the video on her Instagram account and she told Global News, ‚ÄúIn my 27 years of living in Calgary, I‚Äôve never experienced any kind of racism in my life. It was a big reality check for me and just kind of pointing out this is a thing that‚Äôs happening in the world right now. From the sources I‚Äôve heard from, this isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs done something like this. But it‚Äôs going to be his last.‚Äù The Calgary Police said that Williams was taken into custody and charged with three counts of assault and one count of possession of a weapon dangerous to the public.  India  In India, the ethnic slur chinki (or chinky) is frequently directed against people with East Asian features, including people from North-East India and Nepal, who are often mistaken for Chinese, despite being closer to Tibetans and the Burmese than to Han Chinese peoples. In 2012, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs recognized use of the term \\"chinki\\" to refer to a member of the Scheduled Tribes (especially in the North-East) as a criminal offense under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act with a penalty of up to five years in jail. The Ministry further warned that they would very seriously review any failure of the police to enforce this interpretation of the Act.  United Kingdom  The 1969 top 3 UK hit single for Blue Mink, \\"Melting Pot\\", has the lyric: \\"take a pinch of white man/Wrap him up in black skin. [...] Mixed with yellow Chinkees. You know you lump it all together/And you got a recipe for a get-along scene/Oh what a beautiful dream/If it could only come true\\".http://www.metrolyrics.com/melting-pot- lyrics-blue-mink.html Whilst at the time expressing racial harmony, a modern audience may find the use of the word insensitive, undercutting the song's intent. In 1999, an exam given to students in Scotland was criticized for containing a passage that students were told to interpret containing the word chinky. This exam was taken by students all over Scotland, and Chinese groups expressed offence at the use of this passage. The examinations body apologized, calling the passage's inclusion \\"an error of judgement.\\"  United States  The Pekin, Illinois High School teams were officially known as the \\"Pekin Chinks\\" until 1981, when the school administration changed the name to the \\"Pekin Dragons\\". The event received national attention. New York City radio station Hot 97 was criticized for airing the \\"Tsunami Song\\". Referring to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, in which over an estimated 200,000 people died, the song used the phrase \\"screaming chinks\\" along with other offensive lyrics. The radio station fired a co-host and producer, and indefinitely suspended radio personality Miss Jones, who was later reinstated. Members of the Asian American community said Miss Jones' reinstatement condoned hate speech. Sarah Silverman appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in 2001, stirring up controversy when the word chink was used without the usual bleep appearing over ethnic slurs on network television. The controversy led Asian activist and community leader Guy Aoki to appear on the talk show Politically Incorrect along with Sarah Silverman. Guy Aoki alleged that Silverman did not believe that the term was offensive. A Philadelphia eatery, Chink's Steaks, created controversy, appearing in Philadelphia Daily News and other newspapers. The restaurant was asked by Asian community groups to change the name. The restaurant was named after the original Jewish- American owner's nickname, \\"Chink\\", derived from the ethnic slur due to his \\"slanty eyes\\". The restaurant was renamed Joe's in 2013.Chink's Steaks changing its nameChink‚Äôs Steaks Sign No Longer Hanging In Northeast Philadelphia ¬´ CBS PhillyJoe's Steaks + Soda ShopTake that, racists: Eat at Joe's (formerly Chink's Steaks)Chink's Steaks Is Now Joe's Steaks + Soda Shop ‚Äì Foobooz During early 2000, University of California, Davis experienced a string of racial incidents and crimes between Asian and white students, mostly among fraternities. Several incidents included \\"chink\\" and other racial epithets being shouted among groups, including the slurs being used during a robbery and assault on an Asian fraternity by 15 white males. The incidents motivated a school-wide review and protest to get professional conflict resolution and culturally sensitive mediators. In February 2012, ESPN fired one employee and suspended another for using the headline \\"Chink in the Armor\\" in reference to Jeremy Lin, an American basketball player of Taiwanese and Chinese descent. While the word chink also refers to a crack or fissure and chink in the armor is an idiom and common sports clich√©, referring to a vulnerability, the \\"apparently intentional\\" double entendre of its use in reference to an Asian athlete was viewed as offensive.

History thumb180px Wortley Hall, the family seat until 1950 The earldom was created in 1876 for Edward Montagu- Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, 3rd Baron Wharncliffe. He was a descendant of Edward Wortley Montagu (grandson of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich,) and his wife, the author Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. Their daughter Mary married the future Prime Minister John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute. Their second son, James Stuart, succeeded to the Wortley estates in Yorkshire and Cornwall through his mother and assumed the additional surname of Wortley, becoming James Stuart- Wortley. In 1803, he also inherited the Scottish estates of his uncle James Stuart-Mackenzie and assumed the additional surname of Mackenzie. His second son, James Stuart-Wortley, was a soldier and prominent Tory politician. In 1826, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Wharncliffe, of Wortley in the County of York. The first baron was succeeded by his eldest son, John. He represented Bossiney, Perth, and the West Riding of Yorkshire in the House of Commons. On his death, the peerage passed to his eldest son, Edward, the third Baron. He was Chairman of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, which under his leadership became the Great Central Railway. In 1876 he was created Viscount Carlton, of Carlton in the West Riding of the County of York, and Earl of Wharncliffe, in the West Riding of the County of York, with remainder to his younger brother the Hon. Francis Dudley Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie (1829‚Äì1893). These titles are all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1880, Lord Wharncliffe assumed the additional surname of Montagu. He was succeeded in the viscountcy and earldom, by virtue of the special remainder, by his nephew Francis, the second Earl, the eldest son of the Hon. Francis Dudley Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie. This line of the family failed on the death of his grandson, the fourth Earl, in 1987. He was succeeded by a second cousin once removed, the fifth and present Earl, the American-born Richard Alan Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, of Portland, Maine, the elder son of Alan Ralph Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, only son of Ralph Montagu- Stuart-Wortley, only son of the Hon. Ralph Granville Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, younger brother of the second Earl. Several other members of this branch of the Stuart family have also gained distinction. John Stuart-Wortley, younger brother of the first Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Bossiney. The Hon. Charles Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie, second son of the first Baron, was also Member of Parliament for Bossiney. His daughter Victoria, Lady Welby, was a philosopher of language. Charles Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Stuart of Wortley, was the son of the Hon. James Stuart-Wortley, third son of the first Baron (see the Baron Stuart of Wortley for more information on this branch of the family). The Hon. Edward James Montague-Stuart-Wortley (1857‚Äì1934), second son of the Hon. Francis, second son of the second Baron, was a Major-General in the British Army. The Hon. Sir (Alan) Richard Montagu-Stuart-Wortley (1868‚Äì1949), younger son of the Hon. Francis, second son of the second Baron, was a Lieutenant-General in the British Army. The Hon. James Stuart-Wortley, third son of the second Baron, was a member of the first Parliament of New Zealand. The family seat was Wortley Hall but the present Earl, Richard Wortley, is a distantly-related construction worker from Maine, USA. He did not inherit the estate, which had been reduced by death duties then passed to a different line of the family, namely to Lady Rowena Montagu Stuart Wortley Hunt, second and only surviving daughter of the 4th Earl; this was because the estate did not go with the title but was in the family before they became en- nobled.

It was created in 1837 for Charles Anderson-Pelham, 2nd Baron Yarborough. The Anderson-Pelham family descends from Francis Anderson of Manby, Lincolnshire. He married Mary, daughter of Charles Pelham of Brocklesby, Lincolnshire. Their grandson Charles Anderson assumed the additional surname of Pelham and represented Beverley and Lincolnshire in the House of Commons. In 1794 he was created 1st Baron Yarborough, of Yarborough in the County of Lincoln, in the Peerage of Great Britain. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby and for Lincolnshire. Lord Yarborough married Henrietta Anne Maria Charlotte Bridgeman (d. 1813), daughter of the Hon. John Simpson and Henrietta Francis, daughter of Sir Thomas Worsley, 6th Baronet, of Appuldurcombe (a title which became extinct in 1825; see Worsley baronets). Through this marriage Appuldurcombe House on the Isle of Wight, which had previously been in the Worsley family, came into the Anderson-Pelham family (however, it was sold already in 1855). In 1837 Yarborough was created Baron Worsley, of Appuldurcombe on the Isle of Wight, and Earl of Yarborough, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He represented Newport, Isle of Wight, Lincolnshire and North Lincolnshire in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. Lord Yarborough is also remembered for giving his name to the bridge term the \\"Yarborough hand\\". His son, the third Earl, was Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby. On his early death the titles passed to his son, the fourth Earl. He held office in the second Conservative administration of Lord Salisbury as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms from 1890 to 1892 and was also Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire. In 1905 he assumed by Royal licence for himself and issue the surname and arms of Pelham only in 1905. Lord Yarborough married the Hon. Marcia Lane-Fox, daughter of Sackville George Lane-Fox, 15th Baron Darcy de Knayth and 12th Baron Conyers. The baronies of Darcy de Knayth and Conyers fell into abeyance on the latter's death in 1888. However, in 1892 the barony of Conyers was called out of abeyance in favour of Marcia, who became the thirteenth Baron Conyers in her own right. In 1903 the ancient barony of Fauconberg, which had been in abeyance since 1463, was also called out in her favour and she became the seventh Baroness Fauconberg as well. Both Lord and Lady Yarborough were succeeded in their respective titles by their second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Earl. He had no sons and on his death in 1948 the baronies of Conyers and Fauconberg fell into abeyance between his two daughters Lady Diana Mary and Lady June Wendy; they remained so until the death of Lady June Wendy in 2012. He was succeeded in the other titles by his younger brother, the sixth Earl. As of 2009 the peerages are held by the latter's grandson, the eighth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1991. Caistor Yarborough School in Caistor, Lincolnshire was named in memorial to John Edward Pelham, 7th Earl of Yarborough and is located less than a mile away from the Brocklesby House estate. A number of public places, roads and buildings in Lincolnshire are named after the Yarborough title, particularly in Grimsby, where the family were particularly prominent political figures. One of the most well known sites is the Yarborough Hotel, built in 1851 and now a pub owned by J. D. Wetherspoon. There was also an area in Grimsby called Yarborough, until it was absorbed into the conurbation of Grimsby & Cleethorpes and there continues to be a Yarborough Estate in the town, which is currently undergoing extensive re-development. Another member of this family was Sir Stephen Anderson, 1st Baronet, of Eyworth. He was the brother of Francis Anderson, grandfather of the first Baron Yarborough. The Honourable Dudley Pelham, younger son of the first Earl, was a naval commander and politician. The family crest has been adopted by HMS Brocklesby, which is named after the Brocklesby Hunt.History of HMS Brocklesby The Yarborough Monument on Bembridge Down commissioned by the Royal Yacht Squadron commemorates his life and is both a sea mark and the highest monument on the Isle of Wight at 75 ft.

Genovese rose to power during Prohibition as an enforcer in the American Mafia. A long-time associate and childhood friend of Lucky Luciano, Genovese took part in the Castellammarese War and helped shape the rise of the Mafia and organized crime in the United States. He would later lead Luciano's crime family, which was renamed the Genovese crime family in his honor. Along with Luciano, Genovese helped the expansion of the heroin trade to an international level. In 1937, he fled to Italy, and for a brief period during World War II, he supported Benito Mussolini's regime in Italy for fear of being deported back to the United States to face murder charges. He returned to the United States in 1945. Genovese had served as mentor to Vincent \\"Chin\\" Gigante, the future boss of the Genovese crime family.DeVico, Peter J. \\"The Mafia Made Easy: The Anatomy and Culture of La Cosa Nostra\\". (p. 186). In 1957, Genovese vied for the boss of bosses title by ordering the murder of Albert Anastasia and the botched murder attempt of Frank Costello. Immediately following this, he called a mafia summit to consolidate his power, but the meeting was raided by the police. In 1959, his reign was cut short as he was convicted on narcotics conspiracy charges and sentenced to 15 years in prison. While he and his underling Joe Valachi were in prison together, Valachi killed an inmate he thought to be a hitman sent by Genovese. Valachi then became a government witness. Genovese died in prison on February 14, 1969. Early life Vito Genovese was born on November 21, 1897, in Risigliano, a frazione in the comune of Tufino, in the Province of Naples, Italy. His father was Frances Felice Genovese and his mother Nunziata Aluotto. Vito had a sister Giovanna Jennie (m. Richard Prisco) along with two brothers, Michael and Carmine, who also belonged to Genovese's crime family. His cousin, Michael, became boss of the Pittsburgh crime family.Bureau of Narcotics, Sam Giancana, The United States Treasury Department. Mafia: The Governments Secret File on Organized Crime. p. 307). Genovese was He and his family lived a quiet life in a house in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey.Blackwell, Jon.

Accessed January 29, 2020. \\"The mob leader resumed control of his rackets and settled himself again in New Jersey, this time from a plush homestead in the Shore town of Atlantic Highlands. There, Vito and Anna Genovese dined on gold and platinum plates and enjoyed what was hardly a conventional Mafia marriage.\\" As a child in Italy, Genovese completed school only to the American equivalent of the fifth grade. In 1913, when Genovese was 15, his family immigrated to the United States and took up residence in Little Italy, Manhattan.Philip Carlo The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer (pp. 68‚Äì69). Genovese started his criminal career stealing merchandise from pushcart vendors and running errands for mobsters. He later collected money from people who played illegal lotteries. At 19, Genovese spent a year in prison for illegal possession of a firearm. By the 1920s, Genovese started working for Giuseppe \\"Joe the Boss\\" Masseria, the boss of a powerful Manhattan gang that would evolve into the family he would eventually lead. Charlie Luciano and his close associates started working for gambler Arnold \\"The Brain\\" Rothstein, who immediately saw the potential windfall from Prohibition and educated Luciano on running bootleg alcohol as a business.Stolberg, p. 119 Luciano, Frank Costello, and Genovese started their own bootlegging operation with financing from Rothstein. In 1930, Genovese was indicted on counterfeiting charges when police found $1 million of counterfeit US currency in a Bath Beach, Brooklyn workshop. Later in 1930, Genovese allegedly murdered Gaetano Reina, the leader of a Bronx-based gang. Reina had been a Masseria ally, but Masseria decided to kill him after he began to suspect him of secretly helping Masseria's archrival, Brooklyn gang leader Salvatore Maranzano. On February 26, 1930, Genovese allegedly ambushed Reina as he was leaving his mistress's house in the Bronx and shot him in the back of the head with a shotgun.Milhorn p. 221Sifakis p. 277 Masseria then took direct control of the Reina gang. Castellammarese War In early 1931, the Castellammarese War broke out between Masseria and Maranzano. In a secret deal with Maranzano, Luciano agreed to engineer the death of his boss, Masseria, in return for receiving Masseria's rackets and becoming Maranzano's second-in-command. On April 15, 1931, Luciano had lured Masseria to a meeting where he was murdered at a restaurant called Nuova Villa Tammaro on Coney Island.Raab, Selwyn. Five Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empires. New York: St. Martin Press, 2005. While they played cards, Luciano allegedly excused himself to the bathroom, with the gunmen reportedly being Genovese, Albert Anastasia, Joe Adonis, and Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel; Ciro \\"The Artichoke King\\" Terranova drove the getaway car, but legend has it that he was too shaken up to drive away and had to be shoved out of the driver's seat by Siegel.Sifakis, (2005). pp. 87‚Äì88 Luciano took over Masseria's family, with Genovese as his underboss. In September 1931, Luciano and Genovese planned the murder of Salvatore Maranzano. Luciano had received word that Maranzano was planning to kill him and Genovese, and prepared a hit team to kill Maranzano first. On September 10, 1931, when Maranzano summoned Luciano, Genovese, and Frank Costello to a meeting at his office, they knew Maranzano would kill them there. Instead, Luciano sent to Maranzano's office four Jewish gangsters whose faces were unknown to Maranzano's people. They had been secured with the aid of Lansky and Siegel.\\"Lucky Luciano: Criminal Mastermind,\\" Time, Dec. 7, 1998 Luciano subsequently created The Commission to serve as the governing body for organized crime. In 1931, Genovese's first wife, Donata Ragone, died of tuberculosis and he quickly announced his intention to marry Anna Petillo, who was already married to Gerard Vernotico. On March 16, 1932, Vernotico was found strangled to death on a Manhattan rooftop, and on March 28, 1932, Genovese married his widow, Anna, who was Genovese's cousin via her mother, Concetta y Cassini Genovese. Boccia murder and flee to Italy In 1934, Genovese allegedly ordered the murder of mobster Ferdinand Boccia. Genovese and Boccia had conspired to cheat a wealthy gambler out of $150,000 in a high- stakes card game. After the game, Boccia demanded a share of $35,000 because he had introduced the victim to Genovese. Rather than pay Boccia anything, Genovese decided to have him murdered. On September 19, 1934, Genovese and five associates allegedly shot and killed Boccia in a coffee shop in Brooklyn. On June 18, 1936, Luciano was sentenced to 30 to 50 years in prison as a result of his conviction on pandering. With Luciano's imprisonment, Genovese became acting boss of the Luciano crime family. On November 25, 1936, Genovese became a naturalized United States citizen in New York City. In 1937, fearing prosecution for the Boccia murder, Genovese fled to Italy with $750,000 cash and settled in the city of Nola, near Naples. With Genovese's departure, Costello became acting boss. After bribing some fascist party members, Genovese became a friend of Galeazzo Ciano, Benito Mussolini's son-in-law; it is believed Genovese provided Ciano with cocaine. Genovese donated nearly $4 million to Mussolini's fascist party by the end of World War II. He was also awarded the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and made a commendatore, after he participated in helping create a new fascist party headquarters in Nola. In 1943, Genovese allegedly ordered the murder of Carlo Tresca, the publisher of an anarchist newspaper in New York and an enemy of Mussolini. Genovese allegedly facilitated the murder as a favor to the Italian government. On January 11, 1943, a gunman shot and killed Tresca outside his newspaper office in Manhattan. The shooter was later alleged to be Carmine Galante, a member of the Bonanno crime family. No one was ever charged in the Tresca murder. Return to New York When the Allies invaded Italy in September 1943, Genovese switched sides and quickly offered his services to the U.S. Army. New York governor Charles Poletti was given a personal gift from Genovese which was a 1938 Packard Sedan, which he accepted. Genovese was appointed to a position of interpreter/liaison officer in the U.S. Army headquarters in Naples and quickly became one of Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories' (AMGOT) most trusted employees. Poletti and the entire AMGOT department were completely unaware of his history.The Mafia Restored: Fighters for Democracy in World War II , The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia, Alfred W. McCoy. Genovese established one of the largest black market operations in southern Italy, together with the Italian gangster Calogero Vizzini. Vizzini sent truck caravans loaded with all the basic food commodities necessary for the Italian diet rolling northward to hungry Naples, where their cargoes were distributed by Genovese's organization. All of the trucks were issued passes and export papers by the AMGOT administration in Naples and Sicily, and some corrupt American army officers even made contributions of gasoline and trucks to the operation. According to Luke Monzelli, a lieutenant in the Carabinieri assigned to follow Genovese during his time in Italy: \\"Truckloads of food supplies were shipped from Vizzini to Genovese ‚Äî all accompanied by the proper documents which had been certified by men in authority, Mafia members in the service of Vizzini and Genovese.\\"Fighting the Mafia in World War Two, by Tim Newark, AmericanMafia.com, May 2007 (Retrieved on January 16, 2009)Newark, The Mafia at War, p. 216 In the summer of 1944 in New York, Genovese was implicated in the Boccia murder by mobster Ernest \\"The Hawk\\" Rupolo, a former Genovese associate. Facing a murder conviction, Rupolo had decided to become a government witness. On August 27, 1944, U.S. military police arrested Genovese in Italy during an investigation into his running of a black market ring. It was revealed that Genovese had been stealing trucks, flour, and sugar from the Army. When Agent Orange C. Dickey of the Criminal Investigation Division examined Genovese's background, he discovered that Genovese was a fugitive wanted for the 1934 Boccia killing. However, there was seemingly little interest from the Army or the federal government in pursuing Genovese.Hunting Down Vito Genovese by Tim Newark, June 2007. After months of frustration, Dickey was finally able to make preparations to ship Genovese back to New York to face trial, but came under increasing pressure. Genovese personally offered Dickey a $250,000 bribe to release him, then threatened Dickey when the offer was refused. Dickey was even instructed by his superiors in the military chain of command to refrain from pursuing Genovese, but refused to be dissuaded. On June 2, 1945, after arriving in New York by ship the day before, Genovese was arraigned on murder charges for the 1934 Boccia killing. He pleaded not guilty. On June 10, 1946, another prosecution witness, Jerry Esposito, was found shot to death beside a road in Norwood, New Jersey. Earlier, another witness, Peter LaTempa, was found dead in a cell where he had been held in protective custody. Without anyone to corroborate Rupolo's testimony, the government's case collapsed, and the charges against Genovese were dismissed on June 10, 1946. In making his decision, Judge Samuel Leibowitz commented: > I cannot speak for the jury, but I believe that if there were even a shred > of corroborating evidence, you would have been condemned to the (electric) > chair. Pursuit of power With his release from custody in 1946, Genovese was able to rejoin the Luciano family in New York; however, neither Costello nor Moretti was willing to return power to him. In 1946, Lansky called a meeting of the heads of the major crime families in Havana that December. The three topics which would come under discussion were: the heroin trade, Cuban gambling, and what to do about Siegel and the floundering Flamingo Hotel project in Las Vegas. The Conference took place at the Hotel Nacional de Cuba and lasted a little more than a week. On December 20, during the conference, Luciano had a private meeting with Genovese in Luciano's hotel suite. Unlike Costello, Luciano had never trusted Genovese. In the meeting, Genovese tried to convince Luciano to become a titular boss of bosses and let Genovese run everything. Luciano calmly rejected Genovese's suggestion: > There is no Boss of Bosses. I turned it down in front of everybody. If I > ever change my mind, I will take the title. But it won't be up to you. Right > now you work for me and I ain't in the mood to retire. Don't you ever let me > hear this again, or I'll lose my temper.English, p. 28 Genovese was now a capo of his former Greenwich Village Crew. However, on October 4, 1951, Moretti was assassinated by order of the Mafia Commission; the mob bosses were unhappy with his testimony during the Kefauver Hearings, and were worried, with the syphilis now affecting his brain, he might start talking to the press. Costello appointed Genovese as the new underboss. In December 1952, Anna Genovese sued her husband for financial support, and later divorce in 1953, as well as testifying to Vito's involvement in criminal rackets, an unheard-of action by the wife of a mob figure. Two years earlier, she had moved out of the family home in New Jersey. She asked the judge for $350/week. Vito filed a counter-suit for divorce on the grounds of desertion. According to Anna Genovese, Vito Genovese ruled the Italian lottery in New York and New Jersey, bringing in over $1 million per year, owned four Greenwich Village night clubs, a dog track in Virginia, and other legitimate businesses. Both claims were ultimately dismissed in the New Jersey Superior Court appellate division, in 1954. In 1953, Genovese allegedly ordered the murder of mobster Steven Franse.Sifakis pp. 172 Genovese had tasked Franse with supervising Anna while he hid in Italy. Outraged over Anna's potential love affairs and her lawsuit against him, Genovese ordered Joseph Valachi, to set up Franse's murder.The Dying of the Light: The Joseph Valachi Story by Thomas L. Jones (TruTv Crime Library) On June 18, 1953, Valachi lured Franse to his restaurant in the Bronx, where Franse was strangled to death by Pasquale Pagano and Fiore Siano (Valachi's nephew). During the mid-1950s, Genovese decided to move against Costello. However, Genovese needed to also remove Costello's strong ally on the Commission, Albert Anastasia, the boss of the Anastasia crime family. Genovese was soon conspiring with Carlo Gambino, Anastasia's underboss, to remove Anastasia.Davis, pp. 78-79 In early 1957, Genovese decided to move on Costello. Genovese ordered Vincent Gigante to murder Genovese family boss Costello, and on May 2, 1957, Gigante shot and wounded Costello outside his apartment building. Although the wound was superficial, it persuaded Costello to relinquish power to Genovese and retire. A doorman identified Gigante as the gunman, however, in 1958, Costello testified that he was unable to recognize his assailant; Gigante was acquitted on charges of attempted murder.Vincent Gigante, Mob Boss Who Feigned Incompetence to Avoid Jail, Dies at 77, by Selwyn Raab, The New York Times, December 19, 2005 Genovese now became boss of what is known as the Genovese crime family and promoted his longtime lieutenant, Anthony Strollo, to underboss. In late 1957, Genovese and Gambino allegedly ordered Anastasia's murder. Genovese had heard rumors that Costello was conspiring with Anastasia to regain power. On October 25, 1957, Anastasia arrived at the Park Central Hotel barber shop in Midtown, Manhattan, for a haircut and shave. As Anastasia relaxed in the barber chair, two men with their faces covered in scarves shot and killed Anastasia. Witnesses were unable to identify any of the gunmen and competing theories exist today as to their identities. Apalachin meeting and prison Genovese at the time of his arrest August 2, 1958 in New York City Another one of Genovese's mugshots In November 1957, immediately after the Anastasia murder, after taking control of the Luciano crime family from Costello, Genovese wanted to legitimize his new power by holding a national Cosa Nostra meeting. Genovese elected Buffalo, New York boss and Commission member, Stefano \\"The Undertaker\\" Magaddino, who in turn chose northeastern Pennsylvania crime boss Joseph Barbara and his underboss Russell Bufalino to oversee all the arrangements for the Apalachin meeting. Cuba was one of the Apalachin topics of discussion, particularly the gambling and narcotics smuggling interests of La Cosa Nostra on the island. The international narcotics trade was also an important topic on the Apalachin agenda. The New York garment industry interests and rackets, such as loansharking to the business owners and control of garment center trucking, were other important topics on the Apalachin agenda. On November 14, 1957, powerful mafiosi from the United States and Italy convened at Barbara's estate in Apalachin, New York. The meeting agenda included the resolution of open questions on illegal gambling and narcotics dealing, particularly in the New York City area. State trooper Edgar D. Croswell had become aware that Barbara's son was reserving rooms in local hotels along with the delivery of a large quantity of meat from a local butcher to the Barbara home. That made Croswell suspicious, and he therefore decided to keep an eye on Barbara's house. When the state police found many luxury cars parked at Barbara's home they began taking down license plate numbers. Having found that many of these cars were registered to known criminals, state police reinforcements came to the scene and began to set up a roadblock. When the mobsters discovered the police presence, they started fleeing the gathering by car and by foot. Many Mafiosi escaped through the woods surrounding the Barbara estate.\\"Apalachin Raid on Mafia Reverberates 50 Years Later\\" Mafia News The police stopped a car driven by Bufalino, whose passengers included Genovese and three other men, at a roadblock as they left the estate; Bufalino said that he had come to visit his sick friend, Barbara. Genovese said he was just there for a barbecue and to discuss business with Barbara. The police let him go. On June 2, 1958, Genovese testified under subpoena in the U.S. Senate McClellan Hearings on organized crime. Genovese refused to answer any questions, citing the Fifth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution 150 separate times. Luciano allegedly helped pay part of $100,000 to a Puerto Rican drug dealer to falsely implicate Genovese in a drug deal.Sifakis, p. 186 On July 7, 1958, Genovese was indicted on charges of conspiring to import and sell narcotics. The government's star witness was Nelson Cantellops, a Puerto Rican drug dealer who claimed Genovese met with him. On April 4, 1959, Genovese was convicted in New York of conspiracy to violate federal narcotics laws. On April 17, 1959, Genovese was sentenced to 15 years in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta, where he tried to run his crime family from prison. In his book, Five Families, longtime New York Times organized-crime reporter Selwyn Raab wrote that a number of detectives, lawyers and organized crime experts have questioned the legitimacy of Genovese's conviction. For instance, longtime NYPD detective Ralph Salerno argued that \\"anyone who understands the protocol and insulation procedures\\" of the Mafia would find it \\"almost unbelievable\\" that a crime boss would be directly involved in a drug operation. In September 1959, Genovese allegedly ordered the murder of mobster Anthony Carfano. Angered at the murder attempt on Costello, Carfano had skipped the Apalachin meeting in protest. In response, Genovese decided to murder him. On September 25, 1959, Carfano and a female companion were found shot to death in his Cadillac automobile on a residential street in Jackson Heights, Queens. In April 1962, Genovese allegedly ordered the murder of Anthony Strollo after concluding that Strollo was part of the plot that put him in prison. On April 8, Strollo left his house to go for a walk and was never seen again. His body was never recovered. In 1962, an alleged murder threat from Genovese propelled mobster Joseph Valachi into the public spotlight. In June, Genovese supposedly accused Valachi, also imprisoned in Atlanta, of being an informer and gave Valachi the kiss of death. In July, Valachi supposedly mistook another inmate for a mob hitman and killed him. A $100,000 bounty for Valachi's death, had been placed by Genovese. After receiving a life sentence for that murder, Valachi decided to become a government witness. On August 24, 1964, Ernest Rupolo's body was recovered from Jamaica Bay, Queens. His killers had attached two concrete blocks to his legs and tied his hands. It was widely assumed that Genovese had ordered Rupolo's murder for testifying against him in the 1944 Boccia murder trial. Death Genovese died of a heart attack at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, on He is buried in Saint John Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens.

It is designed mainly for multiplayer gaming. The game is part of the Unreal series of games, and is a sequel to Unreal Tournament (UT99). The game set a record for the number of downloads (1.2 million) when the demo was released, which is a reflection of the popularity of the original UT.ATARI‚ÄôS UNREAL TOURNAMENT 2003 DEMO EXPLODES ONTO THE INTERNET , Atari Press Release, September 24, 2002. In addition, the game engine has been widely licensed for games such as the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series, Splinter Cell, and America's Army. Its sequel/expansion, Unreal Tournament 2004, was released on March 16, 2004.  Gameplay  The available combat modes are: * Deathmatch -- Frag other players as much as possible to gain the highest score. * Team Deathmatch -- Two teams go head to head to be the best fragger. * Capture the flag: Players must invade the enemies' base, capture their flag and bring it back to his/her base in order to score. * Double Domination -- In double domination two teams must control two points on the map. Holding both locations for a certain period of time gives points to a team. * Bombing Run -- Bombing run can best be described as Unreal-style American football where the player gets the ball, has to take it into enemy territory and score in the enemy force's goal. Players can pass to other teammates. Getting killed causes the ball carrier to fumble the ball. The ball launcher is used to carry the ball, it is not a weapon but helps the player heal when he/she is in low of health. 3 Points are awarded for field goals (shooting the ball through the goal), and 7 points are given for touchdowns (carrying the ball through the goal), although the levels are often designed such that this kills the ball carrier. * Last man standing -- All players in this gametype spawn with a limited number of lives. The last remaining player to still have lives wins the match. * Invasion -- A co-op gametype in which the players attempt to kill the invading alien AI. Each player has one life. * Mutant -- Mutant is very similar to a \\"Juggernaut\\" or a \\"King of the Hill\\" type of gameplay. The first person to make a kill becomes the mutant, which gives them unlimited ammo, camouflage, and super speed. The mutant then tries to get as many kills as he can until he is killed. The person who kills the mutant then becomes the mutant.  Reception  In the United States, Unreal Tournament 2003 sold 360,000 copies and earned $13.6 million by August 2006. At the time, this led Edge to declare it the country's 45th-best-selling computer game, and best- selling Unreal title, released since January 2000. Combined sales of all Unreal computer games released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 1.8 million units in the United States by the latter date. In December 2002, the game received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

Her work explores body art, endurance art and feminist art, the relationship between performer and audience, the limits of the body, and the possibilities of the mind. Being active for over four decades, Abramoviƒá refers to herself as the \\"grandmother of performance art\\". She pioneered a new notion of identity by bringing in the participation of observers, focusing on \\"confronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body\\". Early life, education and teaching At the Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2010 Abramoviƒá was born in Belgrade, Serbia, former Yugoslavia on November 30, 1946. In an interview, Abramoviƒá described her family as having been \\"Red bourgeoisie.\\" Her great-uncle was Varnava, Serbian Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Judith Thurman, Profiles, \\"Walking Through Walls,\\" The New Yorker, March 8, 2010, p. 24. Both of her parents, Danica Rosiƒá and Vojin Abramoviƒá were Yugoslav Partisans during the World War II. After the war, Abramoviƒá's parents became \\"national heroes\\" and were given positions in the postwar Yugoslavian government. Abramoviƒá was raised by her grandparents until she was six years old. Her grandmother was deeply religious and Abramoviƒá \\"spent [her] childhood in a church following [her] grandmother's rituals ‚Äì candles in the morning, the priest coming for different occasions\\". At the age of six, when Abramoviƒá's brother was born, she began living with her parents and took piano, French, and English lessons. While she did not take art lessons, she took an early interest in art and enjoyed painting as a child. Life in Abramoviƒá's parental home under her mother's strict supervision was difficult. When Abramoviƒá was a child, her mother beat her for \\"supposedly showing off\\". In an interview published in 1998, Abramoviƒá described how her \\"mother took complete military-style control of me and my brother. I was not allowed to leave the house after 10 o'clock at night until I was 29 years old. ... [A]ll the performances in Yugoslavia I did before 10 o'clock in the evening because I had to be home then. It's completely insane, but all of my cutting myself, whipping myself, burning myself, almost losing my life in 'The Firestar' ‚Äì everything was done before 10 in the evening.\\"Quoted in Thomas McEvilley, \\"Stages of Energy: Performance Art Ground Zero?\\" in Abramoviƒá, Artist Body, [Charta, 1998]. In an interview published in 2013, Abramoviƒá said, \\"My mother and father had a terrible marriage.\\" Describing an incident when her father smashed 12 champagne glasses and left the house, she said, \\"It was the most horrible moment of my childhood.\\" She was a student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade from 1965 to 1970. She completed her post-graduate studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, SR Croatia in 1972. Then she returned to SR Serbia and, from 1973 to 1975, she taught at the Academy of Fine Arts at Novi Sad, while implementing her first solo performances. After Abramoviƒá was married to Ne≈°a Paripoviƒá between 1971 and 1976, in 1976, she went to Amsterdam to perform a piece (later claiming on the day of her birthday) then decided to move there permanently. From 1990 to 1995 Abramoviƒá was a visiting professor at the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts in Paris and at the Berlin University of the Arts. From 1992 to 1996 she was a visiting professor at the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste Hamburg and from 1997 to 2004 she was a professor for performance-art at the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste Braunschweig. Career=Rhythm 10, 1973 In her first performance in Edinburgh in 1973, Abramoviƒá explored elements of ritual and gesture. Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the Russian game, in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she would pick up a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body ‚Äì the pain and the sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramoviƒá began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. \\"Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never normally do.\\"Kaplan, 9 Rhythm 5, 1974 In this performance, Abramoviƒá sought to re-evoke the energy of extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire at the start of the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramoviƒá cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When finished with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramoviƒá leapt across the flames into the center of the large star. At first, due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen inside the star. However, when the flames came very near to her body and she still remained inert, a doctor and others intervened and extricated her from the star. Abramoviƒá later commented upon this experience: \\"I was very angry because I understood there is a physical limit. When you lose consciousness you can't be present, you can't perform.\\"Daneri, 29 Rhythm 2, 1974 Prompted by her loss of consciousness during Rhythm 5, Abramoviƒá devised the two-part Rhythm 2 to incorporate a state of unconsciousness in a performance. She performed the work at the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, in 1974. In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as 'given to patients who suffer from catatonia, to force them to change the positions of their bodies.' The medication caused her muscles to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication 'given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.' The performance ended after five hours when the medication wore off. Rhythm 4, 1974 In this piece, Abramoviƒá kneeled alone and naked in a room with a high-power industrial fan. She approached the fan slowly, attempting to breathe in as much air as possible to push the limits of her lungs. Soon after she lost consciousness. Rhythm 4 was performed at the Galleria Diagramma in Milan. The performance was recorded with Abramoviƒá alone in a small room, and projected to the audience in the next room over. As her Rhythm series focused on pain, Abramoviƒá approaches the fan and attempts to breathe in as much air as she possibly can, exceeding the limit of her lungs, and as a result passing out on the floor. Abramoviƒá's previous experience in Rhythm 5 when the audience interfered in the performance, resulted in Abramoviƒá devising specific plans, so that her loss of unconsciousness would not intervene with continuing the performance until it was complete. Before the beginning of her performance, Abramoviƒá asked the cameraman to focus only on her face, disregarding the fan. This was so the audience would be oblivious to her unconscious state, and therefore unlikely to interfere. Ironically, after several minutes of unconsciousness, the cameraman refused to continue and sent for help.https://blogs.uoregon.edu/marinaabramovic/category/rhythm-series/ ( accessdate=14-05-2020) Rhythm 0, 1974 To test the limits of the relationship between performer and audience, Abramoviƒá developed one of her most challenging (and best-known) performances. She assigned a passive role to herself, with the public being the force that would act on her. Abramoviƒá placed on a table 72 objects that people were allowed to use in any way that they chose; a sign informed them that they held no responsibility for any of their actions. Some of the objects could give pleasure, while others could be wielded to inflict pain, or to harm her. Among them were a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel, a gun and a single bullet. For six hours the artist allowed audience members to manipulate her body and actions without consequences. This tested how vulnerable and aggressive human subjects could be when actions have no social consequences. At first the audience did not do much and was extremely passive. However, as the realization began to set in that there was no limit to their actions, the piece became brutal. By the end of the performance, her body was stripped, attacked, and devalued into an image that Abramoviƒá described as the \\"Madonna, mother, and whore.\\" Additionally, markings of aggression were written on the artist's body. There were cuts on her neck made by audience members, and her clothes were cut off her body. With an initial determination to find out how the public acts with no consequences tied to their actions, she realized by the end that the public might very well have killed her for their own personal enjoyment. In her works, Abramoviƒá affirms her identity through the perspective of others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message. Abramoviƒá's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows spectators to do as they please with her body; the audience pushes the limits of what one would consider acceptable. By presenting her body as an object, she explores the elements of danger and physical exhaustion. Initially, members of the audience reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramoviƒá described it later: \\"What I learned was that ... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you. ... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.\\" Works with Ulay (Uwe Laysiepen) Marina Abramoviƒá and Uwe Laysiepen 1978 In 1976, after moving to Amsterdam, Abramoviƒá met the West German performance artist Uwe Laysiepen, who went by the single name Ulay. They began living and performing together that year. When Abramoviƒá and Ulay began their collaboration, the main concepts they explored were the ego and artistic identity. They created \\"relation works\\" characterized by constant movement, change, process and \\"art vital\\". This was the beginning of a decade of influential collaborative work. Each performer was interested in the traditions of their cultural heritage and the individual's desire for ritual. Consequently, they decided to form a collective being called \\"The Other\\", and spoke of themselves as parts of a \\"two-headed body\\".Quoted in Green, 37 They dressed and behaved like twins and created a relationship of complete trust. As they defined this phantom identity, their individual identities became less accessible. In an analysis of phantom artistic identities, Charles Green has noted that this allowed a deeper understanding of the artist as performer, for it revealed a way of \\"having the artistic self-made available for self-scrutiny\\".Green, 41 The work of Abramoviƒá and Ulay tested the physical limits of the body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, transcendental meditation and nonverbal communication. While some critics have explored the idea of a hermaphroditic state of being as a feminist statement, Abramoviƒá herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with gender ideologies, Abramoviƒá/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: \\"The main problem in this relationship was what to do with the two artists' egos. I had to find out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self.\\"Kaplan, 14 *In Relation in Space (1976) they ran into each other repeatedly for an hour ‚Äì mixing male and female energy into the third component called \\"that self\\". *Relation in Movement (1977) had the pair driving their car inside of a museum for 365 laps; a black liquid oozed from the car, forming a kind of sculpture, each lap representing a year. (After 365 laps the idea was that they entered the New Millennium.) *In Relation in Time (1977) they sat back to back, tied together by their ponytails for sixteen hours. They then allowed the public to enter the room to see if they could use the energy of the public to push their limits even further. *To create Breathing In/Breathing Out the two artists devised a piece in which they connected their mouths and took in each other's exhaled breaths until they had used up all of the available oxygen. Seventeen minutes after the beginning of the performance they both fell to the floor unconscious, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide. This personal piece explored the idea of an individual's ability to absorb the life of another person, exchanging and destroying it. *In Imponderabilia (1977, reenacted in 2010) two performers of opposite sexes, both completely nude, stand in a narrow doorway. The public must squeeze between them in order to pass, and in doing so choose which one of them to face. *In AAA-AAA (1978) the two artists stood opposite each other and made long sounds with their mouths open. They gradually moved closer and closer, until they were eventually yelling directly into each other's mouths. This piece demonstrated their interest in endurance and duration. *In 1980, they performed Rest Energy, in an art exhibition in Dublin, where both balanced each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramoviƒá's heart. With almost no effort, Ulay could easily kill Abramoviƒá with one finger. This seems to symbolize the dominance of men and what kind of upperhand they have in society over women. In addition, the handle of the bow is held by Abramoviƒá and is pointed at herself. The handle of the bow is the most significant part of a bow. This would be a whole different piece if it were a Ulay aiming a bow at an Abramoviƒá, but by having her hold the bow, it is almost as if the she is supporting him while taking her own life. Between 1981 and 1987, the pair performed Nightsea Crossing in twenty-two performances. They sat silently across from each other in chairs for seven hours a day. In 1988, after several years of tense relations, Abramoviƒá and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey that would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called Lovers, starting from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramoviƒá described it: \\"That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the Gobi Desert and I from the Yellow Sea. After each of us walked 2500 km, we met in the middle and said good-bye.\\" She has said that she conceived this walk in a dream, and it provided what she thought was an appropriate, romantic ending to a relationship full of mysticism, energy, and attraction. She later described the process: \\"We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending ... Because in the end, you are really alone, whatever you do.\\" She reported that during her walk she was reinterpreting her connection to the physical world and to nature. She felt that the metals in the ground influenced her mood and state of being; she also pondered the Chinese myths in which the Great Wall has been described as a \\"dragon of energy.\\" It took the couple eight years to acquire permission from the Chinese government to perform the work, by the time of which their relationship had completely dissolved. At her 2010 MoMA retrospective, Abramoviƒá performed The Artist Is Present, in which she shared a period of silence with each stranger who sat in front of her. Although \\"they met and talked the morning of the opening\\", Abramoviƒá had a deeply emotional reaction to Ulay when he arrived at her performance, reaching out to him across the table between them; the video of the event went viral. In November 2015, Ulay took Abramoviƒá to court, claiming she had paid him insufficient royalties according to the terms of a 1999 contract covering sales of their joint works. In September 2016, a Dutch court ordered Abramoviƒá to pay ‚Ç¨250,000 to former co-creator and lover Ulay as his share of sales of artistic collaborations over their joint works. In its ruling, the court in Amsterdam found that Ulay was entitled to royalties of 20% net on the sales of their works, as specified in the original 1999 contract, and ordered Abramoviƒá to backdate royalties of more than ‚Ç¨250,000, as well as more than ‚Ç¨23,000 in legal costs. Additionally, she was ordered to provide full accreditation to joint works listed as by \\"Ulay/Abramoviƒá\\" covering the period from 1976 to 1980, and \\"Abramoviƒá/Ulay\\" for those from 1981 to 1988. Cleaning the Mirror, 1995 Cleaning the Mirror consisted of five monitors playing footage in which Abramoviƒá scrubs a grimy human skeleton in her lap. She vigorously brushes the different parts of the skeleton with soapy water. Each monitor is dedicated to one part of the skeleton: the head, the pelvis, the ribs, the hands, and the feet. Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramoviƒá becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece consists of a three-piece series. Cleaning the Mirror #1 was performed at the Museum of Modern Art, consisting of three hours. Cleaning the Mirror #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University. Cleaning the Mirror #3 was performed at Pitt Rivers Museum for five hours.Abramovic, M., & von Drathen, D. (2002). Marina Abramovic. Fondazione Antonio Ratti. Spirit Cooking, 1996 Abramoviƒá worked with Jacob Samuel to produce a cookbook of \\"aphrodisiac recipes\\" called Spirit Cooking in 1996. These \\"recipes\\" were meant to be \\"evocative instructions for actions or for thoughts\\". For example, one of the recipes calls for \\"13,000 grams of jealousy,\\" while another says to \\"mix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk.\\" The work was inspired by the popular belief that ghosts feed off intangible things like light, sound, and emotions. In 1997, Abramoviƒá created a multimedia Spirit Cooking installation. This was originally installed in the Zerynthia Associazione per l'Arte Contemporanea in Rome, Italy and included white gallery walls with \\"enigmatically violent recipe instructions\\" painted in pig's blood. According to Alexxa Gotthardt, the work is \\"a comment on humanity's reliance on ritual to organize and legitimize our lives and contain our bodies\\". Abramovic also published a Spirit Cooking cookbook, containing comico-mystical, self-help instructions that are meant to be just poetry. Spirit Cooking later evolved into a form of dinner party entertainment that Abramovic occasionally lays on for collectors, donors, and friends. Balkan Baroque, 1997 Abramoviƒá in this piece vigorously scrubbed thousands of bloody cow bones over a period of four days, in reference to the ethnic cleansing that had taken place in the Balkans during the 1990s. This performance piece earned Abramoviƒá the Golden Lion award at the Venice Biennale. Abramoviƒá created this piece as a response to the war in Bosnia. She remembers other artists reacting immediately, creating work and protesting about the effects and horrors of the war. Abramoviƒá could not bring herself to create work on the matter so soon, as it was to close to home for her. Eventually, Abramoviƒá returned to Belgrade, where she interviewed her Mother, Father, and a ratcatcher. She then incorporated these interviews into her piece. Clips of the hands of her father, her father holding a pistol and her mother showing empty hands then crossed hands. Abramoviƒá is dressed as a doctor recounting the story of the rat catcher. While this is happening, Abramoviƒá simultaneously sits among and tries to wash a large pile of bones. The performance was set in Venice in 1997, Abramoviƒá remembers worms emerging from the bones and the horrible smell, as it was extremely hot in Venice during the summer.https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/243/3126 Abramoviƒá explains that the idea of scrubbing the bones clean, trying to remove the blood, is impossible. The point Abramoviƒá is trying to make, is that you can't wash the blood from the bones and hands, just like you can't wash away the shame from the war. She wanted to allow the images from the performance to speak for not only the war in Bosnia, but for any war, anywhere in the world. Seven Easy Pieces, 2005 Abramoviƒá performing Bruce Nauman's Body Pressure, Guggenheim Museum, 2005 Beginning on November 9, 2005, Abramoviƒá presented Seven Easy Pieces at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. On seven consecutive nights for seven hours she recreated the works of five artists first performed in the '60s and '70s, in addition to re-performing her own Lips of Thomas and introducing a new performance on the last night. The performances were arduous, requiring both the physical and the mental concentration of the artist. Included in Abramoviƒá's performances were recreations of Gina Pane's The Conditioning, which required lying on a bed frame suspended over a grid of lit candles, and of Vito Acconci's 1972 performance in which the artist masturbated under the floorboards of a gallery as visitors walked overhead. It is argued that Abramoviƒá re-performed these works as a series of homages to the past, though many of the performances were altered from their originals. A full list of the works performed is as follows: * Bruce Nauman's Body Pressure (1974) * Vito Acconci's Seedbed (1972) * Valie Export's Action Pants: Genital Panic (1969) * Gina Pane's The Conditioning (1973) * Joseph Beuys's How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare (1965) * Abramoviƒá's own Thomas Lips (1975) * Abramoviƒá's own Entering the Other Side (2005) The Artist Is Present: March‚ÄìMay 2010 Abramoviƒá performing The Artist Is Present, Museum of Modern Art, March 2010 From March 14 to May 31, 2010, the Museum of Modern Art held a major retrospective and performance recreation of Abramoviƒá's work, the biggest exhibition of performance art in MoMA's history, curated by Klaus Biesenbach.Kino, Carol (March 10, 2010). \\"A Rebel Form Gains Favor. Fights Ensue.\\", The New York Times. Retrieved April 16, 2010. Biesenbach also provided the title for the performance, which referred to the fact that during the entire performance \\"the artist would be right there in the gallery or the museum.\\" During the run of the exhibition, Abramoviƒá performed The Artist Is Present, a 736-hour and 30-minute static, silent piece, in which she sat immobile in the museum's atrium while spectators were invited to take turns sitting opposite her. Ulay made a surprise appearance at the opening night of the show. Abramoviƒá sat in a rectangle drawn with tape in the floor of the second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramoviƒá. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less, a few sat with her for an entire day. and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for the last day of the exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramoviƒá, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramoviƒá wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramoviƒá sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed, Alan Rickman, Jemima Kirke, Jennifer Carpenter and Bj√∂rk; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramoviƒá concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep. A support group for the \\"sitters\\", \\"Sitting with Marina\\", was established on Facebook, as was the blog \\"Marina Abramoviƒá made me cry\\". The Italian photographer Marco Anelli took portraits of every person who sat opposite Abramoviƒá, which were published on Flickr, compiled in a book and featured in an exhibition at the Danziger Gallery in New York. Abramoviƒá said the show changed her life \\"completely ‚Äì every possible element, every physical emotion\\". After Lady Gaga saw the show and publicized it, Abramoviƒá found a new audience: \\"So the kids from 12 and 14 years old to about 18, the public who normally don't go to the museum, who don't give a shit about performance art or don't even know what it is, started coming because of Lady Gaga. And they saw the show and then they started coming back. And that's how I get a whole new audience.\\"\\"I've Always Been A Soldier\\", The Talks. Retrieved January 16, 2013.

In January 2011, Abramoviƒá was on the cover of Serbian ELLE, photographed by Du≈°an Reljin. Kim Stanley Robinson's science fiction novel 2312 mentions a style of performance art pieces known as \\"abramovics.\\" A world premiere installation by Abramoviƒá was featured at Toronto's Trinity Bellwoods Park as part of the Luminato Festival in June 2013. Abramoviƒá is also co-creator, along with Robert Wilson of the theatrical production The Life and Death of Marina Abramoviƒá, which had its North American premiere at the festival, and at the Park Avenue Armory in December. Abramoviƒá attempted to create the Marina Abramoviƒá Institute (MAI), a nonprofit foundation for performance art, in a 33,000 square-foot space in Hudson, New York. She also founded a performance institute in San Francisco. She is a patron of the London-based Live Art Development Agency.

In celebration of her 70th birthday on November 30, 2016, Abramoviƒá took over (once again) the Guggenheim museum (eleven years after her previous happening there) for her birthday party entitled \\"Marina 70\\". Part one of the evening, titled \\"Silence,\\" lasted 70 minutes, ending with the crash of a gong struck by the artist. Then came the more conventional part two: \\"Entertainment,\\" during which Abramoviƒá took to the stage to make a speech before watching English singer and visual artist ANOHNI (who was part of the entertainment at this summer's Watermill Benefit in the Hamptons) perform Frank Sinatra's classic number \\"My Way\\" while wearing a large black Hood.news.artnet.com > \\"See the Best Instagram Snaps from Marina Abramovic's 70th Birthday Bash at the Guggenheim\\" by Sarah Cascone (December 9, 2016) In March 2015, Abramoviƒá presented her TED talk titled, \\"An art made of trust, vulnerability and connection.\\" In 2019, IFC's mockumentary show Documentary Now! parodied Abramoviƒá's work and the documentary film Marina Abramoviƒá: The Artist Is Present. The episode, titled Waiting for the Artist, starred Cate Blanchett as Isabella Barta (Abramoviƒá) and Fred Armisen as Dimo (Ulay.) Originally set to open 26 September 2020, her first major exhibition in the UK at the Royal Academy of Arts has been rescheduled for autumn 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the Academy, the exhibition will \\"bring together works spanning her 50-year career, along with new works conceived especially for these galleries. As Abramoviƒá approaches her mid-70s, her new work reflects on changes to the artist's body, and explores her perception of the transition between life and death.\\" https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/marina- abramovic Refused proposals Abramoviƒá had proposed some solo performances during her career that never were performed. One such proposal was titled \\"Come to Wash with Me\\". This performance would take place in a gallery space that was to be transformed into a laundry with sinks placed all around the walls of the gallery. The public would enter the space and be asked to take off all of their clothes and give them to Abramoviƒá. The individuals would then wait around as she would wash, dry and iron their clothes for them, and once she was done, she would give them back their clothing, and they could get dressed and then leave. She proposed this in 1969 for the Galerija Doma Omladine in Belgrade. The proposal was refused. In 1970 she proposed a similar idea to the same gallery that was also refused. The piece was untitled. Abramoviƒá would stand in front of the public dressed in her regular clothing. Present on the side of the stage was a clothes rack adorned with clothing that her mother wanted her to wear. She would take the clothing one by one and change into them, then stand to face the public for a while. \\"From the right pocket of my skirt I take a gun. From the left pocket of my skirt I take a bullet. I put the bullet into the chamber and turn it. I place the gun to my temple. I pull the trigger.\\" The performance had two possible outcomes. The list of Mother's clothes included: # Heavy brown pin for the hair # White cotton blouse with red dots # Light pink bra ‚Äì 2 sizes too big # Dark pink heavy flannel slip ‚Äì three sizes too big # Dark blue skirt ‚Äì mid-calf # Skin color heavy synthetic stockings # Heavy orthopedic shoes with laces Collaborations Abramoviƒá maintains a friendship with actor James Franco, who interviewed her for the Wall Street Journal in 2009. Franco visited Abramoviƒá during The Artist Is Present in 2010. The two also attended the 2012 Metropolitan Costume Institute Gala together. In July 2013, Abramoviƒá worked with pop singer Lady Gaga on the singer's third album Artpop. Gaga's work with Abramoviƒá, as well as artists Jeff Koons and Robert Wilson, was displayed at an event titled \\"ArtRave\\" on November 10. Furthermore, both have collaborated on projects supporting the Marina Abramoviƒá Institute, including Gaga's participation in an 'Abramoviƒá Method' video and a nonstop reading of Stanis≈Çaw Lem's sci-fi novel, Solaris. Also in July 2013, Jay-Z showcased an Abramoviƒá-inspired piece at Pace Gallery in New York City. He performed his art-inspired track \\"Picasso Baby\\" for six straight hours. During the performance, Abramoviƒá and several figures in the art world were invited to dance with him standing face to face. The footage was later turned into a music video. She allowed Jay-Z to adapt \\"The Artist Is Present\\" under the condition that he would donate to the Marina Abramoviƒá Institute. Abramoviƒá stated that Jay-Z did not live up to his end of the deal, describing the performance as a \\"one-way transaction\\". However, two years later in 2015, Abramoviƒá publicly issued an apology stating she was never informed of Jay-Z's sizable donation. Controversy Abramoviƒá sparked controversy in August 2016 when passages from an early draft of her memoir were released, in which‚Äîbased on notes from her 1979 initial encounter with Aboriginal Australians‚Äîshe compared them to dinosaurs and observed that \\"they have big torsos (just one bad result of their encounter with Western civilization is a high sugar diet that bloats their bodies) and sticklike legs\\". She responded to the controversy on Facebook, saying she had \\"the greatest respect for the Aborigine people, to whom [she] owed everything\\". Among a tranche of emails leaked from John Podesta and published by WikiLeaks in the run-up to the 2016 US presidential election was a message from Abramoviƒá to Podesta's brother discussing an invitation to a spirit cooking, which was interpreted by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones as an invitation to a satanic ritual, and presented by Jones and others as proof that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had links with the occult. In 2013 Reddit Q&A; in response to question about occult in contemporary art she said: \\"Everything depends on which context you are doing what you are doing. If you are doing the occult magic in the context of art or in a gallery, then it is the art. If you are doing it in different context, in spiritual circles or private house or on TV shows, it is not art. The intention, the context for what is made, and where it is made defines what art is or not\\". Sculptor Nikola Pe≈°iƒá says that Abramoviƒá has a lifelong interest in esotericism and Spiritualism, but this should not be confused with Satanism, which is a different system of occult beliefs.Nikola Pe≈°iƒá, Marina Abramoviƒá, World Religions and Spirituality Project, January 15, 2017. On April 10, 2020, Microsoft released a promotional video for HoloLens 2, which featured Abramoviƒá. However, due to accusations by right-wing conspiracy theorists of her having ties to Satanism, Microsoft eventually pulled the advertisement. Abramoviƒá responded to the criticism, appealing to people to stop harassing her, arguing that her performances are just the art that she has been doing for 50 years of her life. Films Abramoviƒá directed a segment, Balkan Erotic Epic, in Destricted, a compilation of erotic films made in 2006. In 2008 she directed a segment Dangerous Games in another film compilation Stories on Human Rights. She also acted in a five-minute short film Antony and the Johnsons: Cut the World.

Located in Hudson, New York, the building was built in 1933 and has been used as a theater and community tennis center. The building was to be renovated according to a design by Rem Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of OMA. The early design phase of this project was funded by a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign was funded by more than 4,000 contributors, including Lady Gaga and Jay-Z. The project was canceled in October 2017 due to its high anticipated cost.

Since 1858, Earl of Burlington has been a courtesy title used by the Dukes of Devonshire, traditionally borne by the duke's grandson, who is the eldest son of the duke's eldest son, the Marquess of Hartington. History The first creation was for Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Cork, on 20 March 1664 (see the Earl of Cork for earlier history of the family). He had previously been created Baron Clifford of Lanesborough, in the County of York, on 4 November 1644, also in the Peerage of England. Lord Burlington was the husband of Elizabeth Clifford, 2nd Baroness Clifford. Their eldest son Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan, succeeded his mother as third Baron Clifford in 1691 but predeceased his father. Lord Burlington was therefore succeeded by his grandson (the son of Viscount Dungarvan), the third Earl of Cork and second Earl of Burlington. He had already succeeded his father as fourth Baron Clifford in 1694. His only son, the 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork, was the famous architect and patron. He had two daughters but no sons and on his death in 1753 the barony of Clifford of Lanesborough and earldom of Burlington became extinct. He was succeeded in the earldom of Cork by his third cousin, the fifth Earl of Orrery (see the Earl of Cork for further history of these titles). Lord Burlington was succeeded in his Burlington estates and in the barony of Clifford (which could be passed on through female lines) by his daughter Charlotte, the sixth Baroness. She was the wife of The 4th Duke of Devonshire. On 10 September 1831, the earldom of Burlington was revived when their third and youngest son Lord George Cavendish was created Baron Cavendish of Keighley, in the County of York, and Earl of Burlington, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1858, his grandson, the second Earl, succeeded his first cousin once removed as seventh Duke of Devonshire. Since then, Earl of Burlington has traditionally been used as a courtesy title by the Duke of Devonshire's grandson (Marquess of Hartington is the title used by the heir apparent). The current Earl of Burlington, a photographer known professionally as Bill Burlington, has opted to retain this title instead of becoming the Marquess of Hartington as he could have done following the death of his grandfather in 2014.

She is best remembered as the comic foil to the Marx Brothers in seven of their films. Groucho Marx called her \\"practically the fifth Marx brother\\". Early life Dumont was born Daisy Juliette Baker in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of William and Harriet Anna (n√©e Harvey) Baker. She spent many years of her childhood being raised by her godfather, Joel Chandler Harris at his home, Wren's Nest in Atlanta before returning to New York as a teenager. Career Dumont trained as an operatic singer and actress in her teens, and began performing on stage in the U.S. and in Europe, at first under the name Daisy Dumont and later as Margaret (or Marguerite) Dumont. Her theatrical debut was in Sleeping Beauty and the Beast at the Chestnut Theater in Philadelphia, and in August 1902, two months before her 20th birthday, she appeared as a singer/comedian in a vaudeville act in Atlantic City. The dark-haired soubrette, described by a theater reviewer as a \\"statuesque beauty\\", attracted notice later that decade for her vocal and comedic talents in The Girl Behind the Counter (1908), The Belle of Brittany (1909) and The Summer Widower (1910). In 1910, she married millionaire sugar heir and industrialist John Moller Jr. and retired from stage work, although she had a small uncredited role as an aristocrat in a 1917 film adaptation of A Tale of Two Cities. The marriage was childless. After her husband's sudden death during the 1918 influenza pandemic, Dumont reluctantly returned to the Broadway stage, and soon gained a strong reputation in musical comedies. She never remarried. Her Broadway career included roles in the musical comedies and plays The Fan (1921), Go Easy, Mabel (1922), The Rise of Rosie O'Reilly (1923/24) and The Fourflusher (1925), and she had an uncredited role in the 1923 film Enemies of Women. With the Marx Brothers In 1925, Dumont came to the attention of theatrical producer Sam H. Harris who recommended her to the Marx Brothers and writer George S. Kaufman for the role of the wealthy dowager Mrs. Potter alongside the Marxes in their Broadway production of The Cocoanuts. In the Marxes' next Broadway show Animal Crackers, which opened in October 1928, Dumont again was cast as foil and straight woman Mrs. Rittenhouse, another rich, society dowager. She appeared with the Marxes in the screen versions of both The Cocoanuts (1929) and Animal Crackers (1930). With the Marx Brothers, Dumont played wealthy, high-society widows whom Groucho alternately insulted and romanced for their money: * The Cocoanuts (1929) as Mrs. Potter * Animal Crackers (1930) as Mrs. Rittenhouse * Duck Soup (1933) as Mrs. Gloria Teasdale * A Night at the Opera (1935) as Mrs. Claypool * A Day at the Races (1937) as Mrs. Emily Upjohn * At the Circus (1939) as Mrs. Susanna Dukesbury * The Big Store (1941) as Martha Phelps Her role as the hypochondriacal Mrs. Upjohn in A Day at the Races brought her a Best Supporting Actress Award from the Screen Actors Guild, and film critic Cecilia Ager suggested that a monument be erected in honor of Dumont's courage and steadfastness in the face of the Marx Brothers' antics. Groucho once said that because of their frequent movie appearances, many people believed he and Dumont were married in real life. An exchange from Duck Soup: :Groucho: I suppose you'll think me a sentimental old fluff, but would you mind giving me a lock of your hair? :Dumont: A lock of my hair? Why, I had no idea you ... :Groucho: I'm letting you off easy. I was gonna ask for the whole wig. Dumont also endured dialogue about her characters' (and thus her own) stoutish build, as with these lines, also from Duck Soup: :Dumont: I've sponsored your appointment because I feel you are the most able statesman in all Freedonia. :Groucho: Well, that covers a lot of ground. Say, you cover a lot of ground yourself. You'd better beat it; I hear they're going to tear you down and put up an office building where you're standing. and: :Groucho: Why don't you marry me? :Dumont: Why, marry you? :Groucho: You take me, and I'll take a vacation. I'll need a vacation if we're going to get married. Married! I can see you right now in the kitchen, bending over a hot stove. But I can't see the stove. Or her age (in their last film pairing, The Big Store): :Dumont: You make me think of my youth. :Groucho: Really? He must be a big boy by now. Dumont's character would often give a short, startled or confused reaction to these insults, but appeared to forget them quickly. Decades later, in his one-man show at New York's Carnegie Hall, Groucho mentioned Dumont's name and got a burst of applause. He falsely informed the audience that she rarely understood the humor of their scenes and would ask him, \\"Why are they laughing, Julie?\\" (\\"Julie\\" being her nickname for Julius, Groucho's birth name). Dumont was so important to the success of the Marx Brothers films, she was one of the few people Groucho mentioned in his short acceptance speech for an honorary Oscar in 1974. (The others were Harpo and Chico, their mother Minnie, and Groucho's companion Erin Fleming. Zeppo and Gummo Marx, who were both alive at the time, were not mentioned, though Jack Lemmon, who introduced Groucho, mentioned all four brothers who appeared with Dumont on film.) In most of her interviews and press profiles, Dumont preserved the myth of her on-screen character: the wealthy, regal woman who never quite understood the jokes. However, in a 1942 interview with the World Wide Features press syndicate, Dumont said, \\"Scriptwriters build up to a laugh, but they don't allow any pause for it. That's where I come in. I ad lib‚Äîit doesn't matter what I say‚Äîjust to kill a few seconds so you can enjoy the gag. I have to sense when the big laughs will come and fill in, or the audience will drown out the next gag with its own laughter... I'm not a stooge, I'm a straight lady. There's an art to playing straight. You must build up your man, but never top him, never steal the laughs from him.\\"[McMurtry, Charles,] World Wide Features (March 1, 1942). \\"Straight Lady Explains Art of Timed Ad Libs. Margaret Dumont (Don't Call Her a Stooge) Can Sense Laughs, Save Them.\\" New York Herald Tribune,E-4 For decades, film critics and historians have theorized that because Dumont never broke character or smiled at Groucho's jokes, she did not \\"get\\" the Marxes' humor. On the contrary, Dumont, a seasoned stage professional, maintained her \\"straight\\" appearance to enhance the Marxes' comedy. In 1965, shortly before Dumont's death, The Hollywood Palace featured a recreation of \\"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\\" (from the Marxes' 1930 film Animal Crackers) in which Dumont can be seen laughing at Groucho's ad-libs ‚Äî proving that she got the jokes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6EnV11TkMw Writing about Dumont's importance as a comic foil in 1998, film critic Andrew Sarris wrote \\"Groucho's confrontations with Miss Dumont seem much more the heart of the Marxian matter today than the rather loose rapport among the three brothers themselves.\\"Sarris, Andrew, You Ain't Heard Nothing Yet, Oxford University Press, 1998, pg. 445 Dumont's acting style, especially in her early films, reflected the classic theatrical tradition of projecting to the back row (for example, trilling the \\"r\\" for emphasis). She had a classical operatic singing voice that screenwriters eagerly used to their advantage. Other roles Dumont appeared in 57 films, including some minor silent work beginning with A Tale of Two Cities (1917). Her first feature was the Marx Brothers' The Cocoanuts (1929), in which she played Mrs. Potter, the role she played in the stage version from which the film was adapted. She also made some television appearances, including a guest-starring role with Estelle Winwood on The Donna Reed Show in the episode \\"Miss Lovelace Comes to Tea\\" (1959). Dumont, usually playing her dignified dowager character, appeared with other film comedians and actors, including Wheeler and Woolsey and George \\"Spanky\\" McFarland (Kentucky Kernels, 1934); Joe Penner (Here, Prince 1932, and The Life of the Party 1937); Lupe V√©lez (High Flyers, 1937); W.C. Fields (Never Give a Sucker an Even Break, 1941, and Tales of Manhattan 1942); Laurel and Hardy (The Dancing Masters, 1943); Red Skelton (Bathing Beauty, 1944); Danny Kaye (Up in Arms, 1944); Jack Benny (The Horn Blows at Midnight, 1945); George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes (Sunset in El Dorado, 1945); Abbott and Costello (Little Giant, 1946); and Tom Poston (Zotz!, 1962). Turner Classic Movies‚Äô website says of High Flyers: \\"The surprise... is seeing [Dumont] play a somewhat daffy matron, more Billie Burke than typical Margaret Dumont. As the lady who's into crystal gazing and dotes on her kleptomaniac bull terrier, she brings a discreetly screwball touch to the proceedings.\\" She also appeared on television with Martin and Lewis in The Colgate Comedy Hour (December 1951). Dumont played dramatic parts in films including Youth on Parole (1937); Dramatic School (1938); Stop, You're Killing Me (1952); Three for Bedroom C (1952); and Shake, Rattle & Rock! (1956) Her last film role was that of Shirley MacLaine's mother, Mrs. Foster, in What a Way to Go! (1964). On February 26, 1965, eight days before her death, Dumont made her final acting appearance on the television program The Hollywood Palace, where she was reunited with Groucho, the week's guest host. They performed material from Captain Spaulding's introductory scene in Animal Crackers, including the song \\"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\\". The taped show was broadcast on April 17, 1965. Personal life Dumont married millionaire American Sugar Refining Company heir and industrialist John Moller Jr. in 1910 and retired from stage work. The marriage was childless. Moeller died during the 1918 influenza pandemic, after which Dumont reluctantly returned to the Broadway stage. She never remarried, and died from a heart attack on March 6, 1965. She was cremated and her ashes were interred in the vault at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles. She was 82, although many obituaries erroneously gave her age as 75.

He is best known as an early supporter of the Cooperative Movement. William King was the son of Rev. John King, a master at Ipswich School. One brother, John, was a writer of legal books, and another, Richard Henry was a naval officer who served under Philip Broke ‚Äì a former pupil at Ipswich School ‚Äì during the capture of USS Chesapeake. He was born in Lower Brooke Street, Ipswich but the family subsequently moved to Witnesham when his father retired to the rectory there in 1798. By 1827, Robert Owen had taken his ideas of a co-operative movement to the United States. But they were picked up and amplified by King. King founded a cooperative store in Brighton. Then in 1828 he started a paper, The Co-operator The Co-operator URL: https://books.google.com/books?id=4mATAAAAQAAJ to promote these ideas. The Co- operator had a wide circulation and a great influence in the emerging movement. Though only published for slightly over two years, the paper served to educate and unify otherwise scattered groups. King's articles in the paper gave the movement some philosophical and practical basis that it had lacked before. King's overriding rationale for the movement is best illustrated by the phrases repeated on the masthead of every issue of The Co-operator: :\\"Knowledge and union are power. Power, directed by knowledge is happiness. Happiness is the end of creation.\\" King lived at 23 Montpelier Road in the Montpelier area of Brighton.

HACEK is an abbreviation of the initials of the genera of this group of bacteria: Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter (previously Actinobacillus), Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella. The HACEK organisms are a normal part of the human microbiota, living in the oral-pharyngeal region. The bacteria were originally grouped because they were thought to be a significant cause of infective endocarditis, but recent research has shown that they are rare and only responsible for 1.4‚Äì3.0% of all cases of this disease. Organisms HACEK originally referred to Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella kingae. However, taxonomic rearrangements have changed the A to Aggregatibacter species and the H to Haemophilus species to reflect the recategorization and novel identification of many of the species in these genera. Some reviews of medical literature on HACEK organisms use the older classification, but recent papers are using the new classification. A list of HACEK organisms: *Haemophilus species **Haemophilus haemolyticus **Haemophilus influenzae: The incidence of endocarditis due to H. influenzae declined after the introduction of the Hib vaccine. **Haemophilus parahaemolyticus **Haemophilus parainfluenzae *Aggregatibacter **Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) **Aggregatibacter aphrophilus (previously Haemophilus aphrophilus) **Aggregatibacter paraphrophilus (previously Haemophilus aphrophilus) **Aggregatibacter segnis *Cardiobacterium **Cardiobacterium hominis: This is the most common species in the genus Cardiobacterium. **Cardiobacterium valvarum *Eikenella **Eikenella corrodens *Kingella **Kingella denitrificans **Kingella kingae: This is the most common species in the genus Kingella. Presentation All of these organisms are part of the normal oropharyngeal flora, which grow slowly (up to 14 days), prefer a carbon dioxide‚Äìenriched atmosphere, and share an enhanced capacity to produce endocardial infections, especially in young children. Collectively, they account for 5‚Äì10% of cases of infective endocarditis involving native valves and are the most common Gram-negative cause of endocarditis among people who do not use drugs intravenously. They have been a frequent cause of culture-negative endocarditis. Culture-negative refers to an inability to produce a colony on regular agar plates because these bacteria are fastidious (require a specific nutrient). In addition to valvular infections in the heart, they can also produce other infections, such as bacteremia, abscess, peritonitis, otitis media, conjunctivitis, pneumonia, arthritis, osteomyelitis, and periodontal infections. Treatment The treatment of choice for HACEK organisms in endocarditis is the third-generation cephalosporin and Œ≤-Lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone. Ampicillin (a penicillin), combined with low-dose gentamicin (an aminoglycoside) is another therapeutic option., eMedicine, HACEK organism infection. June 2005.

The film is based on the J. R. R. Tolkien novel of the same name. In April 2011, Keating began working on Goddess, a 2013 romantic comedy film co-starring British actress Laura Michelle Kelly. The film is being directed by Mark Lamprell, who wrote Babe: Pig in the City. In May 2014 Keating provided the singing voice of Postman Pat in the film Postman Pat: The Movie. In November 2014, he took over the part of 'Guy' in Once from David Hunter, at the Phoenix Theatre in London's West End, performing the role until March 2015. He was be the fourth principal 'Guy' in the West End production, and the first Irishman to have played the role since Glen Hansard in the Oscar-winning original film, on which the musical is based. His performances in Once received positive reviews from critics. In 2017, Keating starred alongside Jessica Marais in the fourth season of the Australian drama, Love Child. The same year, he also starred as Harold Le Druillenec, brother of Louisa Gould in the film Another Mother's Son, based on a true story from the German occupation of the Channel Islands. Feuds=Louis Walsh When Keating announced he wanted to take a break from Boyzone, Louis Walsh continued to manage his career. Keating achieved a number one hit with \\"Life is a Rollercoaster\\" in 2000 while his album sold 4.4 million copies. Keating and Walsh later agreed to part company and then had a bitter falling out. Walsh told the press: \\"[Keating] wasn't the most talented one ‚Äì he's not a great singer and he's got no personality.\\" Keating later told Closer magazine: \\"That man absolutely tried to ruin me and if he thinks we can ever hug and make up he can forget it. I haven't heard from him in three years and I wouldn't have a problem if I never saw him again. He's not a nice character.\\" The feud between the two men had apparently ended by March 2008, after which Keating helped in selecting the finalists in the groups category in The X Factor. However, by the time Boyzone celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2013, Walsh had stopped managing the group, claiming his tenure as manager had ended \\"badly\\". Thom Yorke Keating criticised Radiohead frontman Thom Yorke several times in the press throughout late 2008 and early 2009, calling him a \\"muppet\\" and an \\"idiot\\" due to Yorke allegedly ignoring Keating at a hotel. Shortly after Keating's remarks, Kanye West and Miley Cyrus also complained about Yorke's alleged rudeness. In response to the accusations, Yorke left a blog on Radiohead's official site for those who were not among \\"those people I have managed to offend by doing nothing.\\" Personal life In April 1998, Keating married Yvonne Connolly. Together, they have three children: a son Jack, born in 1999 and daughters Missy and Ali born in 2001 and 2005. In 2009, Keating had a seven-month affair with Boyzone back-up dancer Francine Cornell which resulted in Keating and Connolly separating in 2010; their divorce was finalized in March 2015. He met his current wife Storm Uechtritz in August 2010 and married her on 17 August 2015. Their son Cooper was born on 27 April 2017. In November 2019, they revealed they were expecting their second child together. Their daughter Coco Knox Keating was born on 27 March 2020.

It was first proposed in 1986 by John G. Cramer, who argues that it helps in developing intuition for quantum processes. He also suggests that it avoids the philosophical problems with the Copenhagen interpretation and the role of the observer, and also resolves various quantum paradoxes. TIQM formed a minor plot point in his science fiction novel Einstein's Bridge. More recently, he has also argued TIQM to be consistent with the Afshar experiment, while claiming that the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worlds interpretation are not. The existence of both advanced and retarded waves as admissible solutions to Maxwell's equations was explored in the Wheeler‚ÄìFeynman absorber theory. Cramer revived their idea of two waves for his transactional interpretation of quantum theory. While the ordinary Schr√∂dinger equation does not admit advanced solutions, its relativistic version does, and these advanced solutions are the ones used by TIQM. In TIQM, the source emits a usual (retarded) wave forward in time, but it also emits an advanced wave backward in time; furthermore, the receiver, who is later in time, also emits an advanced wave backward in time and a retarded wave forward in time. A quantum event occurs when a \\"handshake\\" exchange of advanced and retarded waves triggers the formation of a transaction in which energy, momentum, angular momentum, etc. are transferred. The quantum mechanism behind transaction formation has been demonstrated explicitly for the case of a photon transfer between atoms in Sect. 5.4 of Carver Mead's book Collective Electrodynamics. In this interpretation, the collapse of the wavefunction does not happen at any specific point in time, but is \\"atemporal\\" and occurs along the whole transaction, and the emission/absorption process is time-symmetric. The waves are seen as physically real, rather than a mere mathematical device to record the observer's knowledge as in some other interpretations of quantum mechanics. Philosopher and writer Ruth Kastner argues that the waves exist as possibilities outside of physical spacetime and that therefore it is necessary to accept such possibilities as part of reality.George Musser and Ruth Kastner; \\"Can We Resolve Quantum Paradoxes by Stepping Out of Space and Time?\\", Scientific American blog, June 21, 2013. Cramer has used TIQM in teaching quantum mechanics at the University of Washington in Seattle. Advances over previous interpretations TIQM is explicitly non-local and, as a consequence, logically consistent with counterfactual definiteness (CFD), the minimum realist assumption. As such it incorporates the non-locality demonstrated by the Bell test experiments and eliminates the observer- dependent reality that has been criticized as part of the Copenhagen interpretation. Greenberger‚ÄìHorne‚ÄìZeilinger state the key advance over Everett's Relative State Interpretation is to regard the conjugate state vector of the Dirac formalism as ontologically real, incorporating a part of the formalism that, prior to TIQM, had been interpretationally neglected. Having interpreted the conjugate state vector as an advanced wave, it is shown that the origins of the Born rule follow naturally from the description of a transaction. The transactional interpretation is superficially similar to the two-state vector formalism (TSVF)Avshalom C. Elitzur, Eliahu Cohen: The Retrocausal Nature of Quantum Measurement Revealed by Partial and Weak Measurements, AIP Conf. Proc. 1408: Quantum Retrocausation: Theory and Experiment (13‚Äì14 June 2011, San Diego, California), pp. 120‚Äì131, which has its origin in work by Yakir Aharonov, Peter Bergmann and Joel Lebowitz of 1964.Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: Protective measurements of two-state vectors, in: Robert Sonn√© Cohen, Michael Horne, John J. Stachel (eds.): Potentiality, Entanglement and Passion-At-A-Distance, Quantum Mechanical Studies for A. M. Shimony, Volume Two, 1997, , pp. 1‚Äì8, p. 2 However, it has important differences‚Äîthe TSVF is lacking the confirmation and therefore cannot provide a physical referent for the Born Rule (as TI does). Kastner has criticized some other time-symmetric interpretations, including TSVF, as making ontologically inconsistent claims. Kastner has developed a new Relativistic Transactional Interpretation (RTI) also called Possibilist Transactional Interpretation (PTI) in which space-time itself emerges by a way of transactions. It has been argued that this relativistic transactional interpretation can provide the quantum dynamics for the causal sets program. Debate In 1996, Tim Maudlin proposed a thought experiment involving Wheeler's delayed choice experiment that is generally taken as a refutation of TIQM. However Kastner showed Maudlin's argument is not fatal for TIQM. In his book, The Quantum Handshake, Cramer has added a hierarchy to the description of pseudo-time to deal with Maudlin's objection and has pointed out that some of Maudlin's arguments are based on the inappropriate application of Heisenberg's knowledge interpretation to the transactional description. Transactional Interpretation faces criticisms. The following is partial list and some replies: 1\\\\. \\"TI does not generate new predictions / is not testable / has not been tested.\\" TI is an exact interpretation of QM and so its predictions must be the same as QM. Like the many-worlds interpretation (MWI), TI is a \\"pure\\" interpretation in that it does not add anything ad hoc but provides a physical referent for a part of the formalism that has lacked one (the advanced states implicitly appearing in the Born rule). Thus the demand often placed on TI for new predictions or testability is a mistaken one that misconstrues the project of interpretation as one of theory modification.The Quantum Handshake by John G. Cramer, p. 183: \\"No consistent interpretation of quantum mechanics can be tested experimentally, because each is an interpretation of the same quantum mechanical formalism, and the formalism makes the predictions. The Transactional Interpretation is an exact interpretation of the QM formalism. Like the Many-Worlds and the Copenhagen interpretations, the TI is a \\"pure\\" interpretation that does not add anything ad hoc, but does provide a physical referent for a part of the formalism that has lacked on (e.g. the advanced wave functions appearing in the Born probability rule and amplitude calculations). Thus the demand for new predictions or testability from an interpretation is based on a conceptual error by the questioner that misconstrues an interpretation as a modification of quantum theory. According to Occam's Razor, the hypothesis that introduces the fewest independent assumptions is to be preferred. The TI offers this advantage over its rivals, in that the Born probability rule is a result rather than an independent assumption.\\" 2\\\\. ‚ÄúIt is not made clear where in spacetime a transaction occurs.‚Äù One clear account is given in Cramer (1986), which pictures a transaction as a four-vector standing wave whose endpoints are the emission and absorption events.The Quantum Handshake by John G. Cramer, p. 183: The TIQM \\"pictures a transaction as emerging from an offer- confirmation handshake as a four-vector standing wave normal in three- dimensional space with endpoints at the emission and absorption verticies. Kastner has predicted an alternative account of transaction formation in which the formation of a transaction is not a spatiotemporal process but one taking place on a level of possibility in a higher Hilbert space rather than in 3+1-dimensional spacetime.\\" 3\\\\. \\"Maudlin (1996, 2002) has demonstrated that TI is inconsistent.\\" Maudlin's probability criticism confused the transactional interpretation with Heisenberg's knowledge interpretation. However, he raised a valid point concerning causally connected possible outcomes, which led Cramer to add hierarchy to the pseudo-time description of transaction formation.Berkovitz, J. (2002). \`\`On Causal Loops in the Quantum Realm,\\" in T. Placek and J. Butterfield (Ed.), Proceedings of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Modality, Probability and Bell's Theorems, Kluwer, 233‚Äì255.The Quantum Handshake by John G. Cramer, p. 184: \\"Maulin raised an interesting challenge for the Transactional Interpretation by pointing out a paradox that can be constructed when the non-detection of a slow particle moving in one direction that modifies the detection configuration in another direction. This problem is dealt with by the TI ... by introducing a hierarchy in the order of the transactional formation ... Other solutions to the problem raised by Maudlin can be found in the references.\\"The Quantum Handshake by John G. Cramer, p. 184: Maudlin also made the claim, based on his assumption that the wave function is a representation of observer knowledge, that it must change when new information is made available. \\"That Heisenberg-inspired view is not a part of the Transactional Interpretation, and introducing it leads to bogus probability argument. In the Transactional Interpretation, the offer wave does not magically change in mid-flight at the instant when new information becomes available, and its correct application leads to the correct calculation of probabilities that are consistent with observation.\\" Kastner has extended TI to the relativistic domain, and in light of this expansion of the interpretation, it can be shown that the Maudlin Challenge cannot even be mounted, and is therefore nullified; there is no need for the 'hierarchy' proposal of Cramer. Maudlin has also claimed that all the dynamics of TI is deterministic and therefore there can be no 'collapse.' But this appears to disregard the response of absorbers, which is the whole innovation of the model. Specifically, the linearity of the Schr√∂dinger evolution is broken by the response of absorbers; this directly sets up the non-unitary measurement transition, without any need for ad hoc modifications to the theory. The non- unitarity is discussed, for example in Chapter 3 of Kastner's book The Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: The Reality of Possibility (CUP, 2012).Kastner, R. E. The Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics: The Reality of Possibility (CUP, 2012) 4\\\\. \\"It is not clear how the transactional interpretation handles the quantum mechanics of more than one particle.\\" This issue is addressed in Cramer's 1986 paper, in which he gives many examples of the application of TIQM to multi-particle quantum systems. However, if the question is about the existence of multi-particle wave functions in normal 3D space, Cramer's 2015 book goes into some detail in justifying multi-particle wave functions in 3D space.The Quantum Handshake by John G. Cramer, p. 184. Cramer's earlier publications \\"provided many examples of the application of the TI to systems involving more than one particle. These include the Freedman-Clauser experiment, which describes a 2-photon transaction with three vertices, and the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss effect, which describes a 2-photon transaction with four vertices. [Other publications contain] many examples of more complicated multi-particle systems, including systems with both atoms and photons. But perhaps the question posed above is based on the belief that quantum mechanical wave functions for systems of more than one particle cannot exist in normal three-dimensional space and must be characterized instead as existing only in an abstract Hilbert space of many dimensions. Indeed, Kastner‚Äôs \\"Possibilist Transactional Interpretation\\" takes this point of view and describes transaction formation as ultimately appearing in 3D space but forming from the Hilbert-space wave functions. ... The \\"standard\\" Transactional Interpretation presented here, with its insights into the mechanism behind wave function collapse through transaction formation, provides a new view of the situation that makes the retreat to Hilbert space unnecessary. The offer wave for each particle can be considered as the wave function of a free (i.e., uncorrelated) particle and can be viewed as existing in normal three-dimensional space. The application of conservation laws and the influence of the variables of the other particles of the system on the particle of interest come not in the offer wave stage of the process but in the formation of the transactions. The transactions \\"knit together\\" the various otherwise independent particle wave functions that span a wide range of possible parameter values into a consistent ensemble, and only those wave function sub-components that are correlated to satisfy the conservation law boundary conditions at the transaction vertices are permitted to participate in this transaction formation. The \\"allowed zones\\" of Hilbert space arise from the action of transaction formation, not from constraints on the initial offer waves, i.e., particle wave functions. Thus, the assertion that the quantum wave functions of individual particles in a multi-particle quantum system cannot exist in ordinary three-dimensional space is a misinterpretation of the role of Hilbert space, the application of conservation laws, and the origins of entanglement. It confuses the \\"map\\" with the \\"territory\\". Offer waves are somewhat ephemeral three-dimensional space objects, but only those components of the offer wave that satisfy conservation laws and entanglement criteria are permitted to be projected into the final transaction, which also exists in three-dimensional space.\\" A criticism of Cramer's 2015 account of dealing with multi-particle quantum systems is found in Kastner 2016, \\"An Overview of the Transactional Interpretation and its Evolution into the 21st Century, Philosophy Compass (2016). It observes in particular that the account in Cramer 2015 is necessarily anti-realist about the multi-particle states: if they are only part of a 'map,' then they are not real, and in this form TI becomes an instrumentalist interpretation, contrary to its original spirit. Thus the so-called \\"retreat\\" to Hilbert space (criticized also below in the lengthy discussion of note ) can instead be seen as a needed expansion of the ontology, rather than a retreat to anti-realism/instrumentalism about the multi-particle states. The vague statement (under ) that \\"Offer waves are somewhat ephemeral three-dimensional space objects\\" indicates the lack of clear definition of the ontology when one attempts to keep everything in 3+1 spacetime.

The Church of Scotland, which is Presbyterian, and the Anglican churches in Wales and Northern Ireland, which are no longer established churches, are not represented. The Lords Spiritual are distinct from the Lords Temporal, their secular counterparts who also sit in the House of Lords. Ranks and titles The Church of England comprises 42 dioceses, each led by a diocesan bishop. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York, as Primate of All England and Primate of England, respectively, have oversight over their corresponding provinces. The occupants of the five \\"great sees\\"‚ÄîCanterbury, York, London, Durham and Winchester‚Äîare always Lords of Parliament. Of the remaining 35 bishops, the 21 most senior sit in the House of Lords, although the normal operation of this rule was suspended in 2015 (following the decision of the Church to begin to appoint women as bishops), instead meaning that until 2025 every woman appointed as a bishop will automatically be appointed as a Lord Spiritual, regardless of seniority, so as to balance out the representation of female Bishops in the House. Otherwise, seniority is determined by total length of service as an English diocesan bishop (that is to say, it is not lost by translation to another see).Lords Appointment from Parliament.uk retrieved 15 June 2013 The Bishop of Sodor and Man and the Bishop of Gibraltar in Europe may not sit in the House of Lords regardless of seniority as their dioceses lie outside both of England and of the United Kingdom. (The former, however, sits on the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man ex officio.) Theoretically, the power to elect archbishops and bishops is vested in the diocesan cathedral's college of canons. Practically, however, the choice of the archbishop or bishop is made prior to the election. The Prime Minister chooses from among a set of nominees proposed by the Crown Nominations Commission; the sovereign then instructs the college of canons to elect the nominated individual as a bishop or archbishop. One of the Lords Spiritual is appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury to be the convenor of the bench; he or she coordinates the work of the bishops in the House. David Urquhart, Bishop of Birmingham, was appointed the current convenor on 18 May 2015.Church of England ‚Äî New Convenor of the Lords Spiritual announced (Accessed 16 June 2015) Peers Even during the early years of the Peerage, the position of bishops was unclear. During the reign of King Richard II, the Archbishop of Canterbury declared, \\"of right and by the custom of the realm of England it belongeth to the Archbishop of Canterbury for the time being as well as others his suffragans, brethren and fellow Bishops, Abbots and Priors and other prelates whatsoever, ‚Äî to be present in person in all the King's Parliaments whatsoever as Peers of the Realm\\". The claim was neither agreed nor disagreed to, however, by Parliament. The Lords Spiritual at first declared themselves entirely outside the jurisdiction of secular authorities; the question of trial in the House of Lords did not arise. When papal authority was great, the King could do little but admit a lack of jurisdiction over the prelates. Later, however, when the power of the Pope in England was reduced, the Lords Spiritual came under the authority of the secular courts. The jurisdiction of the common courts was clearly established by the time of Henry VIII, who declared himself head of the Church of England in place of the Pope, ending the constitutional power of the Roman Catholic Church in England. Despite their failure to be tried as temporal peers in the House of Lords, it remained unclear whether the Lords Spiritual were indeed peers. In 1688, the issue arose during the trial of the Seven Bishops‚ÄîWilliam Sancroft, Archbishop of Canterbury; Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet, Bishop of Winchester; Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells; John Lake, Bishop of Chester; William Lloyd, Bishop of Worcester; Francis Turner, Bishop of Ely and Thomas White, Bishop of Peterborough‚Äîby a common jury. The charge was that a petition sent by the Bishops constituted seditious libel; the Bishops argued that they had the right to petition the Sovereign at any time, while the prosecution charged that such a right was only permissible when Parliament was in session (which, at the time of the delivery of the petition, it was not). If the bishops were only Lords of Parliament, and not peers, their right to petition would be vitiated while Parliament was dissolved. Peers, however, were and still are counsellors of the Sovereign whether Parliament is in session or not; therefore, if the bishops were indeed peers, they would be free to send petitions. Since there was no doubt that the petition was actually sent, while the Court still ruled the bishops not guilty, it appears that it was taken for granted that the bishops were counsellors of the Crown. Nevertheless, the Standing Orders of the House of Lords provide, \\"Bishops to whom a writ of summons has been issued are not Peers but are Lords of Parliament.\\" Number In the early history of the Parliament of England, the Lords Spiritual‚Äîincluding the abbots‚Äîoutnumbered the Lords Temporal. Between 1536 and 1540, however, King Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries, thereby removing the seats of the abbots. For the first time and thereafter, Lords Spiritual formed a minority in the House of Lords.History of the Lords from Parliament.uk retrieved 15 June 2013 In addition to the 21 older dioceses (including four in Wales), Henry VIII created six new ones, of which five survived (see historical development of Church of England dioceses); the Bishops of the Church of England were excluded in 1642 but regained their seats following the Restoration; from then until the early nineteenth century no new sees were created, and the number of lords spiritual remained at 26. Bishops, abbots, and priors, of the Church of Scotland traditionally sat in the Parliament of Scotland. Laymen acquired the monasteries in 1560, following the Scottish Reformation, and therefore those sitting as \\"abbots\\" and \\"priors\\" were all laymen after this time. Bishops of the Church of Scotland continued to sit, regardless of their religious conformity. Roman Catholic clergy were excluded in 1567, but Episcopal bishops continued to sit until they too were excluded in 1638. The bishops regained their seats following the Restoration, but were again excluded in 1689, following the final abolition of diocesan bishops and the permanent establishment of the Church of Scotland as Presbyterian. There are no longer bishops in the Church of Scotland, and that church has never sent any clergy to sit in the House of Lords at Westminster. Bishops and archbishops of the Church of Ireland were entitled to sit in the Irish House of Lords as Lords Spiritual. They obtained representation in the Westminster House of Lords after the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801. Of the Church of Ireland's ecclesiastics, four (one archbishop and three bishops) were to sit at any one time, with the members rotating at the end of every parliamentary session (which normally lasted approximately one year). The Church of Ireland, however, was disestablished in 1871, and thereafter ceased to be represented by Lords Spiritual. The Bishop of Sodor and Man, although a Bishop of the Church of England, has never been included among the English Lords Spiritual, as the Isle of Man has never been part of the Kingdom of England or of the United Kingdom. The Lord Bishop is the holder of the oldest office in Tynwald (the oldest continuous parliament in the world) and remains an ex officio member of Tynwald and its Legislative Council. In the 19th century the dioceses of the Church of England began gradually to come under review again. However an increase in the bench of bishops was not considered politically expedient, and so steps were undertaken to prevent it. In 1836, the first new bishopric was founded, that of Ripon; but it was balanced out by the merger of the Bishoprics of Bristol and Gloucester. (They were later divided again.) The creation of the Bishopric of Manchester was also planned but delayed until St Asaph and Bangor could be merged. They never were; but in 1844, the Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847 went ahead anyway with an alternative means to maintain the 26-bishop limit in the House of Lords: the seniority-based proviso which has been maintained to this day. However, the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015 gives any woman appointed a diocesan bishop in England during the next decade priority in terms of succeeding those among the current 21 who retire during that period. Rachel Treweek became Bishop of Gloucester and the first woman Lord Spiritual under the Act in 2015; Christine Hardman became the second later that year. In 1920, with the independence of the Church in Wales from the Church of England and its disestablishment, the Welsh bishops stopped being eligible for inclusion. The 26 seats for the Lords Spiritual are approximately % of the total membership of the House of Lords. Politics Although the Lords Spiritual have no party affiliation, they do not sit on the crossbenches, their seats being on the Government side of the Lords Chamber, on the right-hand side of the throne. Though in a full sitting the Bishops occupy almost three rows, the Lords Spiritual's front bench is subtly distinguished by being the only one in the House with a single armrest at either end; it is on the front row, close to the throne end of the chamber, indicating their unique status.\\"What do Bishops do in Parliament?\\" Church of England website. Retrieved 15 June 2013. By custom at least one of the Bishops reads prayers in each legislative day (a role taken by the Chaplain to the Speaker in the Commons). They often speak in debates; in 2004 Rowan Williams, then Archbishop of Canterbury, opened a debate into sentencing legislation. Measures (proposed laws of the Church of England) must be put before the Lords, and the Lords Spiritual have a role in ensuring that this take place. Other religious figures as Lords Temporal Other religious figures have sat in the House of Lords as Lords Temporal in recent times: Chief Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits was appointed to the House of Lords (with the consent of the Queen, who acted on the advice of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher), as was his successor Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks. In recognition of his work at reconciliation and in the peace process in Northern Ireland, Robin Eames, the Church of Ireland (Anglican) Archbishop of Armagh, was appointed to the Lords by John Major. Other Christian clergy appointed include the Methodist minister Donald Soper, the Anglican priest Timothy Beaumont, and some Scottish clerics. There have been no Roman Catholic clergy appointed since the Reformation, though it was rumoured that Cardinal Basil Hume, the Archbishop of Westminster, and his successor, Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor, were offered peerages by James Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair respectively, but declined. Hume later accepted the Order of Merit, a personal appointment of the Queen, shortly before his death. O'Connor said he had his maiden speech ready, but ordained Roman Catholics are prohibited by the internal canon law of the Roman Catholic Church from holding major offices connected with any government other than the Holy See. Former archbishops of Canterbury, having reverted to the status of regular bishop but who are no longer diocesans, are invariably given life peerages and sit as Lords Temporal. 2011 proposed House of Lords reform Under the 2011 Coalition Government draft proposal for Lords reform, the Lords would be either 80% elected and 20% appointed, or 100% elected. In the former case there would be 12 Church of England bishops in the reformed Upper House.House of Lords Reform Draft Bill retrieved 15 June 2013 The total of 12 bishops would include the five \\"named Lords Spiritual\\" (the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and the Bishops of Durham, London and Winchester, entitled as they are to sit ex officio) plus seven other \\"ordinary Lords Spiritual\\" (diocesan bishops chosen by the church itself through whatever device it deems appropriate). The reduction from 26 to 12 bishops would be achieved in a stepped fashion: up to 21 bishops would remain for the 2015‚Äì2020 period and up to 16 for the 2020‚Äì2025 period. The ordinary Lords Spirituals' terms would coincide with each \\"electoral period\\" (i.e., the period from one election to the next), with the church able to name up to seven to serve during each electoral period. These reforms were later dropped.Politics from BBC.co.uk retrieved 15 June 2013  2015 reform temporarily giving preference to women becoming Lords Spiritual Under the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015 whenever a vacancy arises among the Lords Spiritual during the ten years (18 May 2015 ‚Äì 18 May 2025) following the Act coming into force, the vacancy has to be filled by a woman, if one is eligible. This does not apply to the sees of Canterbury, York, London, Durham and Winchester. Four women have consequently become Lords Spiritual as a result, as of December 2019. Criticism The presence of the Lords Spiritual in the House of Lords has been criticised for being an outdated and non-democratic system by some media commentators and organisations. The British Humanist Association said it was \\"unacceptable\\" that \\"the UK is the only Western democracy to give religious representatives the automatic right to sit in the legislature\\".Bishops in the House of Lords. Humanists UK. Retrieved 11 April 2018.

Budarin occupied various engineering positions at NPO Energia where he was involved in experimental investigations and testing of space technology. From 1976 he was employed as an electrician, from 1978 as an electrical foreman, from 1982 as a test engineer, from 1986 as the head of a group, from 1988 until joining the cosmonauts corps as the lead specialist, head of a group at the NPO Energia check-out and testing facility.  Cosmonaut career  Cosmonauts Nikolai Budarin and Valery Ryumin (left) reunite moments after hatch opening, following docking of Mir and . In February 1989 he was enrolled in the Energia cosmonaut detachment as a candidate test cosmonaut. From September 1989 to January 1991, he underwent a complete basic space training course at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center and passed a State examination and was qualified as a Test Cosmonaut. From February 1991 to December 1993, he took an advanced training course for the Soyuz-TM transport vehicle and the Mir Station flight. From May 1994 till February 1995 he completed training as the flight engineer of the backup crew of Soyuz TM-21 under Expedition-18/NASA-1 program, and, simultaneously, as the flight engineer of the main crew of Mir under Expedition-19 (Mir EO-19) program. From March 27 till May 1995, Budarin was trained for a mission under Mir EO-19 program as the flight engineer of the first crew, and from May 15 to June 26, he trained for the STS-71 mission in the United States.  Mir EO-19  From June 27 to September 11, 1995, Budarin participated in a space mission as a board engineer of the 19th long-term Mir expedition. He was launched into space by on the STS-71 mission. Atlantis lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center at 19:32:19 UTC on June 27, 1995. After 2 days of solo flight the space shuttle docked with the Mir station on June 29, 1995, at 13:00:16 UTC. Budarin spent 75 days, 11 hours and 20minutes in space and landed on the Soyuz TM-21 spacecraft. The Soyuz capsule carrying Budarin and cosmonaut Anatoly Solovyev landed on September 11, 1995 at 06:52:40 UTC, 108 km north east of Arkalyk. Nikolai Budarin, Expedition 6 flight engineer, is pictured in a Soyuz spacecraft that is docked to the ISS.  Mir EO-25  From January 28 to August 25, 1998, he participated in a space mission as a board engineer of the 25th long-term expedition aboard the Mir orbital station. The Soyuz TM-27 spacecraft with Budarin, cosmonaut Talgat Musabayev and ESA astronaut L√©opold Eyharts lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on January 29, 1998, at 16:33:42 UTC. Following a two-day autonomous flight the Soyuz spacecraft docked with the Mir station on January 31, 1998. Musabayev and Budarin together with NASA astronaut Andy Thomas became the 25th resident crew of Mir. First in the focus of the crew was the French mission PEGASE which was mainly dedicated to the life sciences, physical sciences physiques and space technology. They also worked on common scientific experiments. Soyuz TM-27 carrying Budarin, Musabayev and Yuri Baturin landed near Dzhezkazgan on August 25, 1998 at 05:24:44 UTC. During the Soyuz and Mir missions Budarin spent 207 days, 12 hours and 51 minutes in space.  Expedition 6  From November 23, 2002 to May 3, 2003, Budarin logged 161 days, 1 hour and 14 minutes in space as Expedition 6 Flight Engineer aboard the International Space Station. The Expedition 6 crew was launched by Space Shuttle on the STS-113 mission. Endeavour launched into space from the KSC LC-39A on November 24, 2002, at 00:49:47 UTC and docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on 25 November 2002 at 21:59 UTC. During the stay aboard the ISS, Budrain spent time between several Russian science and medical experiments. One experiment called Diatomeya involved observation of ocean surface in order to determine regions best suited for fishing. Another was to monitor glacier dynamics from space to better understand the effects of global warming. The medical research he conducted studied the effects of microgravity on the human body. Budarin returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TMA-1 spacecraft with NASA astronauts Kenneth Bowersox and Donald Pettit. The capsule landed on May 4, 2003 at 02:04:25 UTC and following a ballistic trajectory. A technical commission was established to find the cause of the problem. It revealed that the cause of switching to the ballistic descent mode was an inadequate reaction of the descent control unit within the descent control system to the signals from gyroscope and the angular rate meter. Nikolai Budarin inside the Zvezda Module of the ISS.  Spacewalks  During his two visits to the Mir orbital station, Budarin performed eight spacewalks totaling 44 hours. On July 14, 1995, Budarin conducted his first career spacewalk joined by fellow cosmonaut, Anatoly Solovyev. The two spacewalkers deployed the Spektr solar array and inspected the docking port. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 34 minutes. On July 19, 1995, Budarin conducted his second career spacewalk along with Anatoly Solovyev. The two prepared for MIRAS spectrometer deployment and retrieved the TREK experiment and changed exposure materials. The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 8 minutes. Two days later on July 21, Budarin conducted his third career spacewalk, again with Solovyev. During the 5 hour 35 minute EVA, the two installed the MIRAS spectrometer. On April 1, 1998, Budarin conducted his fourth career spacewalk. He and fellow cosmonaut Talgat Musabayev started repairing a solar panel damaged in the collision between Mir and the Progress M-34 supply ship. The spacewalk started at 13:35 UTC and ended at 20:15 UTC, lasting 6 hours and 40 minutes. On April 6, 1998, Budarin conducted his fifth career spacewalk, with Talgat Musabayev. The two completed the repair work on the broken Spektr solar panel. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 15 minutes. While the two spacewalkers were struggling with installing a brace on the solar panel, Mir suddenly went to free drift and began turning away from the sun. The two were ordered to rush through the final bracing procedure and then perform an expedited entry. The spacewalk was originally planned for March 3, but the crew was unable to open the EVA hatch leading to space, which necessitated the rescheduling of the spacewalk. Budarin failed to open the last of the 10 locks that was closed so tightly and in the process he broke three wrenches. On April 11, 1998, Budarin conducted his sixth career spacewalk. Along with Talgat Musabayev, the two removed Mir's VDU. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 25 minutes. On April 17, 1998, Budarin conducted his seventh career spacewalk. During a 6-hour 33 minute spacewalk, Budarin and Talgat Musabayev installed a new VDU which was delivered by Progress M-38. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 33 minutes. Five days later on April 22, Budarin completed his eighth career spacewalk. He and Musabayev completed the new VDU installation. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 21 minutes. During Expedition 6, on January 15, 2003, Budarin was supposed to join NASA astronaut Kenneth Bowersox in a six-hour spacewalk outside the ISS. However, after failing to meet U.S standards in tests on a stationary bicycle in December 2002, NASA barred him from making a spacewalk citing medical reasons. The claim was rejected by the Russian authorities, which pronounced Budarin was healthy despite NASA concerns about cardiovascular \\"peculiarities\\". They said that the peculiarities of Budarin's cardiovascular system were known to the authorities and that Budarin had them on previous flights as well. The spacewalk was eventually carried out by NASA astronauts Bowersox and Donald Pettit.

On 29 November 1987, the aircraft flying that route exploded in mid-air upon the detonation of a bomb planted inside an overhead storage bin in the airplane's passenger cabin by two North Korean agents. The agents, acting upon orders from the North Korean government, planted the device before disembarking from the aircraft during the first stop-over in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. While the aircraft was flying over the Andaman Sea to its second stop-over in Bangkok, Thailand, the bomb detonated and destroyed the Korean Air Boeing 707-3B5C. Everyone aboard the airliner perished, a total of 104 passengers and 11 crew members (almost all killed were South Koreans). The attack occurred 34 years after the Korean Armistice Agreement that ended the hostilities of the Korean War on 27 July 1953. The two bombers were traced to Bahrain, where they both took ampules of cyanide hidden in cigarettes when they realized they were about to be taken into custody. The man died, but the woman, Kim Hyon-hui, survived and later confessed to the bombing. She was sentenced to death after being put on trial for the attack, but was later pardoned by the President of South Korea, Roh Tae-woo, because it was deemed that she had been brainwashed in North Korea. Kim's testimony implicated Kim Jong-il, who at that time was the future leader of North Korea, as the person ultimately responsible for the incident. The United States Department of State specifically refers to the bombing of KAL 858 as a \\"terrorist act\\" and, except between 2008 and 2017, has included North Korea on its State Sponsors of Terrorism list. Since the attack, diplomatic relations between North Korea and South Korea have not significantly improved, although some progress has been made in the form of four Inter-Korean summits. Kim Hyon-hui later released a book, The Tears of My Soul, in which she recalled being trained in an espionage school run by the North Korean army, and being told personally by Kim Jong-il to carry out the attack. She was branded a traitor by North Korea, and became a critic of North Korea after seeing South Korea. Kim now resides in exile, and under constant tight security, fearing that the North Korean government wants to kill her. \\"Being a culprit I do have a sense of agony with which I must fight\\", she said at a press conference in 1990. \\"In that sense I must still be a prisoner or a captive‚Äîof a sense of guilt.\\"  Background  On 12 November 1987, the two North Korean agents traveled from Pyongyang, North Korea on an airliner to Moscow, capital of the then Soviet Union. From there, the agents left for Budapest, Hungary, the following morning, where they stayed in the home of a North Korean agent for six days. On 18 November, the pair traveled to Vienna, Austria, by car. After crossing the Austrian border, the guidance officer with whom they had stayed in Budapest gave the pair two forged Japanese passports. Posing as tourists staying in the Am Parkring Hotel in Vienna, the two purchased tickets from Austrian Airlines for flights which would take them from Vienna to Belgrade, Yugoslavia (now Serbia), then on to Baghdad, Abu Dhabi, and finally Bahrain. They also purchased tickets from Abu Dhabi to Rome, Italy, for use in escaping after planting the bomb on the KAL flight. Retrieved 16 October 2010 On 27 November, two guidance officers who had arrived in Yugoslavia by train from Vienna gave them the time bomb, a Panasonic transistor radio made in Japan, which contained explosives, a detonator, and a bottle of liquid explosive intended to intensify the blast, disguised as a liquor bottle. The next day, they left Belgrade for Saddam International Airport, Baghdad, Iraq on an Iraqi Airways flight. At the airport, they waited three hours and 30 minutes for the arrival of KAL 858‚Äîthe target of their operation‚Äîwhich took off at around 11:30 p.m. The two bombers planted the improvised explosive device above their seats, 7B and 7C, and disembarked the aircraft at Abu Dhabi International Airport. After the attack, the bombers attempted to fly from Abu Dhabi to Amman, Jordan‚Äîthe first leg of their planned escape route‚Äîbut there were complications with airport authorities regarding their travel visas; therefore, they were forced to fly to Bahrain, where they agreed they would travel to Rome. However, the bombers' passports were identified as forgeries at the airport in Bahrain. Realising that they were about to be taken into custody, they both attempted suicide by ingesting cyanide hidden inside cigarettes. Kim Sung-il was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead, but the female, 25-year-old Kim Hyon- hui, survived. The body of Kim Sung-il was sent to South Korea and subsequently buried in the Cemetery for North Korean and Chinese Soldiers. Aircraft The aircraft operating Korean Air Flight 858 was a Boeing 707-3B5C, registered . It made its first flight in 1971, and at the time of its destruction, the aircraft was 16 years of age and had accumulated 36,047 flying hours. By 1987, it had been painted in the new Korean Air livery with an official airline sticker for the upcoming 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Flight and explosion The aircraft took off from Saddam International Airport (later renamed Baghdad International Airport) in Baghdad, Iraq around 11:30 p.m., flying to Gimpo International Airport in Gangseo-gu, Seoul, South Korea, with stops at Abu Dhabi International Airport in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand. On the second leg of the flight, from Abu Dhabi to Thailand, KAL 858 was carrying 104 passengers and 11 crew members. At around 2:05 p.m. Korea Standard Time (KST), nine hours after the bomb had been planted and near the end of the flight, the bomb detonated and the aircraft exploded over the Andaman Sea (), killing all 115 on board. The pilot transmitted his final radio message shortly before the explosion: \\"We expect to arrive in Bangkok on time. Time and location normal.\\" 113 of the people aboard were South Korean nationals, along with an Indian national and a Lebanese national. Many of the 113 South Korean nationals were young workers who were returning to their home country after working for several years in the construction industry in the Middle East. Retrieved 16 October 2010 A South Korean diplomat, who worked at the embassy in Baghdad, and his wife, were also aboard the flight, though it is not known if they were the prime targets of the attack. Wreckage from the flight was found inland in Thailand around from where the detonation is thought to have occurred. The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were not located. Investigation According to testimony at a United Nations Security Council meeting, on December 15, 1987, Kim was transferred to Seoul, South Korea, where she recovered from the poison and, initially, said she was a Chinese orphan who grew up in Japan, and said that she was not connected to the attack. Authorities grew more suspicious when, while being questioned in Bahrain, she attacked a police officer and attempted to grab his firearm, before being apprehended. At the hearing, the main evidence against Kim was the cigarettes, which, analysis showed, were the type used by a number of other North Korean agents apprehended in South Korea. In January 1988, Kim said at a press conference that the Government of North Korea ordered the attack to frighten teams from attending the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Speaking at the United Nations Security Council, Choi Young-jin, representing South Korea, said that after eight days of interrogation in South Korea, she was permitted to see a film of life in the country on a television screen, and realized that \\"life ... on the streets of Seoul was entirely different from what she had been led to believe.\\" She had been taught that South Korea was an American puppet state that was fraught with poverty and corruption. However, when she saw how South Koreans actually lived, Choi said, \\"she began to realize that what she had been told while living in the North was totally untrue.\\" Kim then \\"threw herself into the arms of a female investigator\\" and confessed to the bombing. In Korean, she said, \\"Forgive me. I am sorry. I will tell you everything,\\" and said that she had been \\"exploited as a tool for North Korean terrorist activities\\", and made a detailed and voluntary confession. Retrieved 16 November 2007 The escape route, she said, was to be from Abu Dhabi via Amman to Rome, but the pair were diverted to Bahrain due to visa complications. Retrieved 16 November 2007 She added that she had been travelling undercover for three years preparing for the attack. Kim told investigators that when she was sixteen, she was chosen by the Workers' Party of Korea and trained in a number of languages. Three years later, she was educated at a secret and elite espionage school run by the North Korean Army, where she was trained to kill with her hands and feet and to use rifles and grenades. Training at the school involved enduring several years of gruelling physical and psychological conditioning. In 1987, aged 25, Kim was ordered to detonate a bomb aboard a South Korean jetliner, an attack that she was told would reunify her divided country forever. In January 1988, Kim announced at a press conference held by the Agency for National Security Planning, the South Korean secret services agency, that both she and her partner were North Korean operatives. She said that they had left a radio containing 350 grams of C-4 explosive and a liquor bottle containing approximately 700 ml of PLX explosive in an overhead rack in the passenger cabin of the aircraft. Kim expressed remorse at her actions and asked for the forgiveness of the families of those who had died. She also said that the order for the bombing had been \\"personally penned\\" by Kim Jong-il, the son of North Korean President Kim Il- sung, who had wanted to destabilize the South Korean government, disrupt its upcoming 1988 parliamentary elections, and frighten international teams from attending the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul later that year. \\"It is natural that I should be punished and killed a hundred times for my sin,\\" she said. Writing in The Washington Post on 15 January 1988, journalist Peter Maass stated that it was not clear to him if Kim was coerced in her remarks or was motivated by remorse for her actions. 15 January 1988 Retrieved 6 January 2010 Kim was subsequently sentenced to execution for the bombing of KAL 858, but she was later pardoned by the President of South Korea, Roh Tae-woo. \\"The persons who ought to be on trial here are the leaders of North Korea,\\" he said. \\"This child is as much a victim of this evil regime as the passengers aboard KAL 858.\\"  Possible discovery of aircraft wreckage  In January 2020, a South Korean television news team from Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation reported that they may have found the main wreckage at a depth of 170 ft under the Andaman Sea. Tipped off by local fishing crews they conducted sonar scans which found a wing shaped object 33 ft long and a 90 ft long section believed to be fuselage. Grainy images from underwater cameras were shown on South Korean TV and, although there was no official confirmation that this was KAL 858 or its location, some families of the victims held a news conference demanding the fuselage be salvaged Aftermath=North Korea Kim Hyon Hui's testimony implicated Kim Jong-il, the son of North Korean President Kim Il-sung, to be ultimately responsible for the bombing. The United States State Department specifically refers to the bombing of KAL 858 as a \\"terrorist act\\" and, until 2008, included North Korea on its State Sponsors of Terrorism list Retrieved 16 October 2010 based on the results of the South Korean investigation; North Korea was reclassified as a terrorist state in 2017. Charles E. Redman, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, said in January 1988 that the incident was an \\"act of mass murder,\\" adding that the administration had \\"concluded that the evidence of North Korean culpability is compelling. We call on all nations to condemn North Korea for this terrorist action.\\" The action was discussed at length in at least two United Nations Security Council meetings where the allegations and evidence was aired by all sides, Retrieved 25 November 2007 Retrieved 25 November 2007 but no resolution was passed. Retrieved 25 November 2007 North Korea continues to deny involvement in the attack on KAL 858, saying that the incident was a \\"fabrication\\" by South Korea and other countries. Kim Jong-il became the leader of North Korea in 1994, succeeding his father. In 2001, right-wing activists and relatives of the victims killed in the attack demanded that Kim Jong-il be arrested for terrorism offences when he visited Seoul later in the year. Two petitions were filed against him, with the activists and relatives stating that there was strong evidence‚Äînamely Kim's testimony‚Äîto suggest he was ultimately responsible for the bombing. They also called for him to make a public apology for the incident and formally compensate the victims' families. The leader of a right-wing South Korean group, lawyer Lee Chul-sung, said, \\"Kim Jong-il must be arrested and punished if he comes to Seoul without admitting his criminal acts and offering an apology and compensation.\\" Kim Jong-il was not arrested, however. He died in December 2011, and was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong-un. Kim Hyon Hui In 1993, William Morrow and Company published The Tears of My Soul, Kim's account of how she was trained as a North Korean espionage agent and carried out the bombing of KAL 858. A gesture of contrition for her crime, she donated all of the proceeds from this book to the families of the victims of KAL 858. The book details her early training and life in China, Macao, and across Europe, carrying out the bombing, her consequent trial, reprieve, and integration into South Korea. In the book, Kim states that Kim Jong-il masterminded the bombing, and gave her the order to carry out the attack. It is also believed that Kim Jong-il masterminded the Rangoon bombing of 1983, in which North Korea attempted to assassinate then-South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan. Her story has also been turned into a motion picture, Mayumi, directed by Shin Sang-ok in 1990. In 2010, Kim Hyon-hui visited Japan, where she met the families of Japanese people abducted by North Korea during the 1970s and 1980s who were forced to teach North Korean spies to disguise themselves as Japanese‚Äîsome of whom, it was reported, may have trained Kim Hyon-hui. The Japanese government waived immigration rules in order for the visit to take place, since Kim is regarded as a criminal in the country for her use of the false Japanese passport in the attack. The Japanese press, however, criticized the visit, for which security was tight over fears that she might be attacked. Kim arrived in the country on a private jet chartered by the Japanese government, and was ushered into a car shielded by large umbrellas. During the visit, she stayed in a holiday home owned by Yukio Hatoyama, then-Prime Minister of Japan. Kim today resides in an undisclosed location and remains under constant protection for fear of reprisals, from either victims' families or the North Korean government, which has described her as a traitor to their cause. In South Korean politics In 2007, an association of families of victims released their suspicions on the official version of the events.https://www.yna.co.kr/view/RPR20070711018100353 The Truth and Reconciliation Commission investigated the matter and found out that the bombing was \\"not a manipulation\\" by the NIS.http://www.newswatch.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=14644 In 2016, Kim Kwang-jin, a member of the National Assembly raised the suspicion that the bombing was done by the NIS during the unsuccessful filibuster of the Anti- Terrorism bill. Continuing tension A South Korean checkpoint at the Korean Demilitarized Zone in August 2005. Tension between North Korea and South Korea has not improved since the signing of the Korean War armistice in 1953. Tension between North Korea and South Korea have not subsided since the signing of the armistice in 1953, and no formal peace treaty permanently ending the conflict has been signed. In 2000, however, both countries held the first Inter-Korean summit, in which the leaders of both countries signed a Joint Declaration, stating that they would hold a second summit in 2007. Furthermore, both countries were involved in militarily and ministerial discussions in Pyongyang, Seoul and Jeju Island of that year. On 2 October 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun walked across the Korean Demilitarized Zone in travelling to Pyongyang for talks with Kim Jong-il. Both leaders reaffirmed the spirit of the 2000 Joint Declaration and had discussions on various issues related to realizing the advancement of South- North relations, peace on the Korean Peninsula, common prosperity of the Korean people, and the reunification of Korea. On 4 October 2007, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il signed the peace declaration. The document called for international talks to replace the armistice, which ended the Korean War, with a permanent peace treaty.

He is a veteran of two long-duration stays aboard the International Space Station, one space shuttle mission and a six-week expedition to find meteorites in Antarctica. As of 2018, at age 64, he is NASA's oldest active astronaut. Personal life Pettit was raised in Silverton, Oregon, and is an Eagle Scout. He is married to Micki Pettit and has twin sons. Career He earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Oregon State University in 1978 and a doctoral degree from the University of Arizona in 1983. NASA career He worked as a scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory until 1996 when he was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA. Spaceflight experienceExpedition 6 Pettit pictured during an EVA Pettit's first space mission was as a mission specialist on ISS Expedition 6 in 2002 and 2003. During his six-month stay aboard the space station, he performed two EVAs to help install external scientific equipment. During free time on his stay aboard the International Space Station, he conducted demonstrations showing how fluids react in an extremely low gravity environment in a series he called \\"Saturday Morning Science\\".http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/crew/exp6/spacechronicles_videos.html The Expedition 6 mission was extended by about two months, following the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia in February 2003. Instead of returning on a shuttle the crew returned in a Russian Soyuz capsule, the first time American astronauts had launched on the Space Shuttle and landed in a Soyuz. STS-126 Pettit was Mission Specialist 1 on the STS-126 mission to deliver equipment and supplies to the ISS. He spent 15 days 20 hours 29 minutes and 37 seconds on board Endeavour. Pettit also performed experiments on board ISS related to clumping of solid particles in microgravity. The experiments showed that particles of various materials which varied in size between 1 micrometer and 6 mm naturally clumped together in microgravity when confined to a volume of 4 liters that included a few grams of the materials. The cause was theorized to be electrostatic. This presents a plausible mechanism for the initial stages of planetary formation, since particles of this size do not have sufficient gravity to cause this phenomenon. Expedition 30/31 Pettit again launched to the International Space Station on December 21, 2011 as part of the Expedition 30/31 crew. He and fellow crewmembers Oleg Kononenko and Andr√© Kuipers arrived at the ISS on December 23. Among his off-duty video demonstrations on the space station has been on water as thin film and the Marangoni convection. On May 25, 2012, Pettit and Kuipers operated the Canadarm2 to grapple the SpaceX Dragon and berth it to the Harmony module. Pettit was the first to enter the unmanned supply ship on May 26, making him the first astronaut in the history of space exploration to successfully enter a commercially-built and operated spacecraft berthed to the ISS in orbit. Angry Birds Space Demos Pettit demonstrates microgravity using characters from 'Angry Birds.' During Expedition 30, on behalf of NASA in cooperation with Finland-based Rovio Entertainment, creator of the Angry Birds franchise, Pettit also made another video by using an Angry Birds character to explain how physics works in space, including demonstrating trajectories in microgravity by catapulting a Red Bird through the space station. NASA states that such collaboration may share the excitement of space with the game community, educate users on NASA's programs, and create interactive educational experiences for the public. The footage was released by NASA both on its official site and YouTube along with another commercial version by Rovio on March 8, 2012 to announce the launch of new game Angry Birds Space on March 22, 2012. Inventions/innovations Astronaut Pettit operates the barn door tracker he constructed for ISS-based photography of the Earth's surface. During Expedition 6 in 2002/2003, Pettit used spare parts found throughout the Station to construct a barn door tracker; the device compensates for the movement of the ISS relative to the Earth's surface, permitting sharper high resolution images of city lights at night from the orbiting space station. In November 2008, Pettit invented a zero-g coffee cup, which used the wetting angle to carry the coffee along a crease to permit drinking and avoid the necessity of a straw. This zero-g cup was featured in the May 2009 National Geographic Magazine issue, along with his notes on the relation of the internal cup angle to the contact wetting angle for various construction materials. Antarctica Pettit in 2009 From November 2006 through January 2007, Pettit joined the Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET), spending six weeks in the Antarctic summer collecting meteorite samples, including a lunar meteorite. During the expedition, he was called on to perform emergency electrical repairs to a snowmobile and emergency dental surgery. Periods of tent-confining inclement weather were spent continuing his Saturday Morning Science series‚Äî\\"on Ice\\"‚Äîwith photographic surveys of crystal sizes of glacial ice samples and collections of magnetic micrometeorites from ice melt used for cooking water. (He estimated Antarctic glacial ice to contain roughly 1 micrometeorite per liter.)

A proponent of statehood for Maine, he became its first governor when it separated from Massachusetts in 1820. Personal and business career William King was born to Richard King, a merchant and shipowner, and Mary Black, on February 9, 1768, at Scarborough, then in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. His formal education was limited to local schools (he spent one term at Phillips Academy) and ended when he was thirteen. He was largely self-educated. Starting as a hand in a saw-mill, he went on to open his own mill. King was employed in a variety of businesses, including as a shipbuilder, then a ship-owner. He became the largest merchant shipping owner in Maine. He became a successful merchant and a significant real-estate investor. He opened the first cotton mill in Maine, at Brunswick. He founded and was president of the first bank of Bath. In 1812, what is now known as the Stone House, King's summer retreat, was built on in rural Bath. King was a Scottish Rite Freemason and later -while he was the Governor of the State- he became the first (Past) Grand Master of Maine* , elected in June, 1820 by the representatives of twenty-four Lodges which \\"met, adopted a Constitution, and elected officers\\". Political career King became active politically in 1795 as a member of the Democratic- Republican Party. He represented Topsham in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1795 and 1799. After he moved to Bath, he represented that town in 1804. He served in the Massachusetts Senate for Lincoln County from 1807 to 1811. When the War of 1812 began, Massachusetts made him major general of the militia, in charge of the Maine district. He devoted much of his attention to coastal shipping and defenses. He also led recruiting efforts for the regular army, for which he was made a colonel in the United States Army. In 1813 King began a seven-year effort that started with his petition to Massachusetts for separation. In 1816 he was re-elected to the Massachusetts Senate, and finally secured their approval for Maine to become a separate state, in 1818. The Missouri Compromise allowed Maine to be recognized as a state on March 15, 1820. He was shortly thereafter elected governor of the new state. In May 1821, President James Monroe named him as one of three commissioners to settle land claims from the 1819 Onis-Adams treaty known as the Spanish Claims Commission. King resigned as governor on May 28, 1821, to take the position of U.S. commissioner, serving until 1824. In 1828 he was appointed by president Andrew Jackaon to serve as Customs Collector of Bath. With the shifting of political parties, he ran once more for governor, as a Whig in 1834, but lost. Later life King continued as a prominent business man, investor, and ship-owner. Even though he had a very limited education, he served for years as a trustee and overseer of Bowdoin College, and as a trustee of Waterville College (now called Colby College). He died at home, in Bath, Maine, on June 17, 1852, and is buried in the city's Maple Grove Cemetery.History of Bath and Environs, Sagadahoc County, Maine: 1607-1894, Parker McCobb Reed (1894) See also * William King (Simmons) Further reading * Smith, Joshua M. \\"\\"The Yankee Soldier's Might: The District of Maine and the Reputation of the Massachusetts Militia, 1800-1812,\\" New England Quarterly LXXXIV no. 2 (June 2011), 234-264. * Marion Smith; \\" _General William King: Merchant, Shipbuilder, and Maine's first Governor_ \\"; 1980, Down East Books, .

The Dungeon Master's Guide contains rules concerning the arbitration and administration of a game, and is intended for use primarily or only by the game's Dungeon Master. The original Dungeon Master's Guide was published in 1979, and gave Dungeon Masters everything they needed to run a D&D; game campaign. It is intended as a companion book to the Player's Handbook, which contains all of the basic rules of gameplay, and the Monster Manual, which is a reference book giving statistics and characteristics to various animals and monsters. The Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual are collectively referred to as the \\"core rules\\" of the Dungeons & Dragons game. Both the Dungeon Master's Guide and the Player's Handbook give advice, tips, and suggestions for various styles of play. While all players, including the Dungeon Master, are expected to have at their disposal a copy of the Player's Handbook, only the Dungeon Master is expected to refer to the Dungeon Master's Guide or Monster Manual during gameplay. Advanced Dungeons & Dragons The original AD&D; Dungeon Masters Guide (sic) was written by Gary Gygax, and published by TSR in 1979 as a 232-page hardcover with a cover by David C. Sutherland III. The 1983 printing featured a new cover by Jeff Easley. Like other volumes of Dungeons & Dragons handbooks, the Dungeon Masters Guide has gone through several versions through the years. The original edition was written by Gary Gygax and edited by Mike Carr, who also wrote the foreword. The original cover art was by David C. Sutherland III, and interior illustrations were provided by Sutherland, D. A. Trampier, Darlene Pekul, Will McLean, David S. LaForce, and Erol Otus. The first edition Dungeon Masters Guide covered all the essential rules for the Dungeon Master: creating and maintaining player characters and managing non-player characters, handling combat, and running adventures and multi-session campaigns. The book also included descriptions of magic items and treasure, random monster encounters, and statistics for the basic monsters and creatures of the game. New magic items were introduced, including the Apparatus of Kwalish. The Dungeon Masters Guide contains scores of tables and charts for figuring damage and resolving encounters in a typical adventure, tables and rules for creating characters, and lists of the various abilities of the different classes of characters. One supplement to the Guide was the Dungeon Masters Screen: two heavy-duty tri-fold boards with the most frequently used tables printed on them for easy reference. The 1979 second edition of the screen describes its purpose as \\"useful for shielding maps and other game materials from the players when placed upright, and also provide[s] instant reference to the charts and tables most commonly used during play.\\" The Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Second Edition screen came packaged with a brief adventure; later editions of that screen, and screens produced for later editions, have instead included character sheets and general reference booklets. A feature of the first edition Dungeon Masters Guide was the random dungeon generator. The generator allowed the Dungeon Master, by the rolling of dice, to generate a dungeon adventure \\"on the fly\\". A dungeon complete with passageways, rooms, treasure, monsters, and other encounters could easily and randomly be constructed as the player progressed. It could be used with several people or a single player. The generator was not included in subsequent editions of the Dungeon Master's Guide but made a re-appearance in the fifth edition Dungeon Master's Guide. The original Dungeon Masters Guide was reviewed by Don Turnbull in issue #16 of the magazine White Dwarf (December 1979/January 1980). Turnbull commented mostly on the size of the book, \\"I would say that only the most severe critic could point at a minor omission, let alone a serious one.\\" The 1st edition Dungeon Masters Guide was reproduced as a premium reprint on July 17, 2012. Reviews * Casus Belli #39 (Aug 1987) Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition The AD&D; 2nd Edition Dungeon Master Guide was released in 1989. This 192-page hardcover book was designed by David \\"Zeb\\" Cook, with cover art by Jeff Easley. The book featured interior illustrations by Easley, Clyde Caldwell, John and Laura Lakey, David Dorman, Douglas Chaffee, and Jean E. Martin. This Dungeon Master Guide featured revised second edition rules for the Dungeon Master, totally reorganized and streamlined. The book detailed options for character creation, handling alignment, new money and equipment rules, treasure and magical items, encounters, time and movement, and handling non-player characters. The book is indexed, and contains many full-page color illustrations. The second edition Dungeon Master Guide is an ORIGINS and Gamer's Choice award-winner. In his 1991 book Heroic Worlds, Lawrence Schick commented that this book contained \\"lots of excellent new advice on how to run AD&D;\\". A new version of the Dungeon Master Guide, with new art and layout but the same text, was released in 1995, as part of TSR's 25th anniversary. The 2nd edition Dungeon Master Guide was reproduced as a premium reprint on May 21, 2013. Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition The 3rd edition D&D; Dungeon Master's Guide was published in 2000. Monte Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams all contributed to the 3rd edition Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual, and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions. Cook is credited with the book's design. Cover art is by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Lars Grant-West, Scott Fischer, John Foster, Todd Lockwood, David Martin, Arnie Swekel, Kevin Walker, Sam Wood, and Wayne Reynolds. Dungeon Master's Guide was republished in 2001 as a slightly revised edition, correcting a few errors in the first edition. In 2003, the Dungeon Master's Guide was revised for the 3.5 edition. David Noonan and Rich Redman are credited for the Dungeon Master's Guide 3.5 revision. Cover art is by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Matt Cavotta, Ed Cox, Lars Grant- West, Scott Fischer, John Foster, Jeremy Jarvis, John and Laura Lakey, Todd Lockwood, David Martin, Raven Mimura, Wayne Reynolds, Scott Roller, Brian Snoddy, Arnie Swekel, and Sam Wood. When asked about the changes from the previous Dungeon Master's Guide, Rich Redman said: The D&D; Dungeon Master's Guide (v.3.5) was reproduced as a premium reprint on September 18, 2012. Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition The 4th edition D&D; Dungeon Master's Guide was released on June 6, 2008, at the same time as its companion volumes. It is a 224-page hardcover written by James Wyatt. The front cover illustration was by Wayne Reynolds and the back cover illustration is by Brian Hagan, with interior illustrations by Rob Alexander, Steve Argyle, Wayne England, Jason Engle, David Griffith, Espen Grundetjern, Brian Hagan, Ralph Horsley, Howard Lyon, Lee Moyer, William O'Connor, Wayne Reynolds, Dan Scott, Ron Spears, Chris Stevens, Anne Stokes, and Eva Widermann. In addition to a comprehensive look at how to DM a 4th Edition campaign or adventure, it contains information on building encounters, aquatic and mounted combat, skill challenges, traps and hazards, rewards, NPC creation, artifacts, monster creation, and template, along with a sample town and short adventure so that DMs can start running their first 4th Edition adventure right away. Although it does contain artifacts, it is the first Dungeon Master's Guide not to contain standard magic items, which were moved into the Player's Handbook for 4th Edition. Shannon Appelcline, author of Designers & Dragons, highlighted that the book introduced mechanical changes such as a \\"new style for adventure encounters\\" and a \\"skill challenge system\\" which were part of the key design philosophies of 4th edition. Appelcline wrote \\"besides revamping philosophies and rules, D&D; 4e also revamped the game's standard world model and its cosmology\\" and \\"Wizards also introduced a new world setting that has become most popularly known as 'Nentir Vale' (though that just designates a small part of the world)\\". In September 2009, the Dungeon Master's Guide 2 was released. It was written by James Wyatt, with Bill Slavicsek, Mike Mearls, and Robin D. Laws. Appelcline wrote \\"the original Dungeon Master's Guide had covered heroic adventuring (levels 1-10), so now the Dungeon Master's Guide 2 detailed paragon adventuring (levels 11-20). However, there is much more in the book too, including storytelling advice, skill challenge and monster customization, and the return of one of D&D;'s most beloved settings\\". The \\"fan-favorite setting of Sigil\\" was last revisited in depth in the Planescape Campaign Setting (1994) for the 2nd edition. As part of the Essentials line of products, which were intended as an easy entry point for new players, Wizards of the Coast released a Dungeon Master's Kit (2010) that included a digest- sized book for the Dungeon Master containing much of the same material as the 4th edition Dungeon Master's Guide along with a two-part adventure module and a set of cardboard tokens for monsters. Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition The 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master's Guide was released in 2014 as the last of three core rulebooks for the new edition. On the staggered release schedule, Jeremy Crawford wrote \\"our small team couldn‚Äôt finish the books at the same time and also ensure their high quality. [...] We could either stagger their releases, or we could sit on the books until all three were finished\\". Crawford and Mike Mearls co-lead design for the Fifth Edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Polygon reported that the book \\"is by far the densest of the rulebooks yet released, but shares the same cover price ‚Äî $50 in the US\\". In an interview with Escapist Magazine, Mearls said: > Basic D&D; hits core fantasy, it's stereotypical fantasy adventuring. If > you're the DM and you want to do something more exotic, you say \\"I want to > add technology to my game\\" or \\"I want to have more detailed rules for a grim > and grittier game, more of a horror game.\\" That's where the DMG comes in, > it's for really fine-tuning your campaign, and creating a different type of > experience than your standard fantasy campaign. It's also for expanding the > scope of the game. [...] The DMG also has a lot of utilities in it, like for > dungeon creation, adventure creation, creating monsters, creating spells, > even if you wanted to create a character class. [...] So it's really for > getting under the hood of how the system works and building up your > campaign.  Reception  The book won the 2015 ENnie \\"Best Supplement\\" Gold award and the 2015 Origins \\"Best Role-Playing Game Supplement\\" and \\"Fan Favorite\\" awards. Henry Glasheen, for SLUG Magazine, wrote \\"Fifth Edition, to my eyes, is the new gold standard for D20-based tabletop RPGs. It strips away the tedium of systems and statistics and replaces them with the true substance of role playing‚Äîdeep, immersive stories. I‚Äôve often found that the Dungeon Master‚Äôs Guide was the most vestigial of all the D&D; manuals, but Fifth Edition has elevated this previously tertiary book into something far more important and useful\\". Jonathan Bolding, for Escapist Magazine, wrote \\"however, on finishing the book it's clear that while many critics - myself included - thought that this system would hinge on the DMG, the DMG just confirmed what we already knew D&D; 5th Edition to be.

In medical applications, \\"spatula\\" may be also used synonymously with tongue depressor.\\"Spatula\\", Collins Dictionary of Medicine, Robert M. Youngson 2004, 2005 The word spatula derives from the Latin word for a flat piece of wood or splint, a diminutive form of the Latin , meaning 'broadsword', and hence can also refer to a tongue depressor. The words spade (digging tool) and spathe are similarly derived. The word spatula is known to have been used in English since 1525. Use Spatulas are usually used to scrape within the contours of a mixing bowl or to level off the top of a dry mixing cup. In the kitchen=American English usage scrapers. In American English, the rubber scraper (left) may be called a spatula because it is a flat utensil used for scraping or spreading. The tool on the right is also called a dough cutter. In American English, spatula refers broadly to a number of broad, flat utensils. The word commonly refers to a turner or flipper (known in British English as a fish slice), used to lift and flip food items during cooking, such as pancakes and fillets. The blades on these are usually made of metal or plastic, with a wooden or plastic handle to insulate them from heat. A cookie shovel is a turner with a larger blade, made for lifting cookies off a pan or baking sheet. A frosting spatula is also known as palette knife and is usually made of metal or plastic. Bowl and plate scrapers are sometimes called spatulas. British English usage In British English a spatula is similar in shape to a palette knife, without holes, in a flexible or detachable blade. It is used in medical examinations, for holding down the tongue or taking cell samples.  Laboratory use  In laboratories, spatulas and microspatulas are small stainless steel utensils, used for scraping, transferring, or applying powders and paste like chemicals or treatments. Many spatula brands are also resistant to acids, bases, heat, and solvents, which make them ideal for use with a wide range of compound. A common type would be stainless steel spatulas, which are widely used because they are sturdy and affordable. They are resistant to deterioration from contact with boiling water, acids, bases, and most solvents. Some of them come with a polyvinyl chloride plastic handle or riveted hardwood for better handling. Polystyrene spatulas are made for researchers because they are disposable, preventing any potential contaminations which occurs often with reusable spatulas. They are also ideal for handling lyophilized products or performing lyophilization.

He was co-discoverer of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and experimented with the possibility of phage therapy. D'Herelle has also been credited for his contributions to the larger concept of applied microbiology. Biography=Early years Hubert Augustin F√©lix Haerens His father was 30 years old when he died. At that time, F√©lix was 6 years old. From 7 to 17 years of age, d'H√©relle attended school in Paris, including the Lyc√©e Condorcet and Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand high schools. In the fall of 1891, d'H√©relle traveled to Bonn, Germany where he attended lectures at the University of Bonn \\"for several months.\\" Thus, d'H√©relle obtained only a high school education and was self-taught in the sciences. Between 16 and 24, d'H√©relle traveled extensively via money given by his mother. At 16, he started to travel through western Europe by bike. At 17, after finishing school, he traveled through South America. Afterwards, he continued his travels through Europe, including Turkey, where he, at 20, met his wife, Marie Caire. At 24, now the father of a daughter, d'H√©relle and his family moved to Canada. He built a home laboratory and studied microbiology from books and his own experiments. Through the influence of a friend of his late father, he earned a commission from the Canadian government to study the fermentation and distillation of maple syrup to schnapps. His father's friend shrewdly pointed out that Pasteur \\"made a good beginning by studying fermentations, so it might be interesting to you, too.\\" He also worked as a medic for a geological expedition, even though he had no medical degree or real experience. Together with his brother, he invested almost all his money in a chocolate factory, which soon went bankrupt. During this period, d'Herelle published his first scientific paper, \\"De la formation du carbone par les v√©g√©taux\\" in the May 1901 issue of Le Naturaliste Canadien. The paper is noteworthy for two reasons: it both shows an exceptional level of scientific development for a self-taught scientist and reveals a broad level of interest, namely the global balance of carbon in nature. However, the claims of the paper were in error, as d'H√©relle contended that the results of his experiments indicated that carbon was a compound, not an element. Guatemala and Mexico With his money almost gone and his second daughter born, he took a contract with the government of Guatemala as a bacteriologist at the General Hospital in Guatemala City. Some of his work included organizing defenses against the dread diseases of the time: malaria and yellow fever. He also studied a local fungal infection of coffee plants, and discovered that acidifying the soil could serve as an effective treatment. As a side job, he was asked to find a way to make whiskey from bananas. Life in the rough and dangerous environment of the country was hard on his family, but d'H√©relle, always adventurer at heart, rather enjoyed working close to \\"real life\\", compared to the sterile environments of a \\"civilized\\" clinic. He later stated that his scientific path began on this occasion. In 1907, he took an offer from the Mexican government to continue his studies on fermentation. He and his family moved to a sisal plantation near M√©rida, Yucat√°n. Disease struck at him and his family, but in 1909, he had successfully established a method to produce sisal schnapps. Return to France  Machines for mass production of sisal schnapps were ordered in Paris, where he oversaw the machines' construction. Meanwhile, in his spare time, he worked for free in a laboratory at the Pasteur Institute. He was soon offered the job of running the new Mexican plant, but declined, considering it \\"too boring\\". He did, however, take the time to attempt stopping a locust plague at the plantation using their own diseases. He extracted bacteria pathogenic to locusts from their guts. This innovative approach to locust plagues anticipated modern biological pest control using Bacillus thuringiensis also known as Bt. D'H√©relle and his family finally moved to Paris in early 1911, where he worked again as an unpaid assistant in a lab at the Pasteur Institute. He got attention in the scientific community the same year, when the results of his successful attempt to counter the Mexican locust plague with Coccobacillus were published. Argentina At the end of the year, restless d'H√©relle was again on the road, this time in Argentina, where he was offered a chance to test these results on a much larger scale. Thus, in 1912 and 1913, he fought the Argentinian locust plagues with coccobacillus experiments. Even though Argentina claimed his success was inconsistent, he himself declared it a full success, and was subsequently invited to other countries to demonstrate the method. France and phages During World War I, d'H√©relle and assistants (his wife and daughters among them) produced over 12 million doses of medication for the allied military. At this point in history, medical treatments were primitive, compared to today's standards. The smallpox vaccine, developed by Edward Jenner, was one of the few vaccines available. The primary antibiotic was the arsenic-based salvarsan against syphilis, with severe side effects. Common treatments were based mercury, strychnine, and cocaine. As a result, in 1900, the average life span was 45 years, and World War I did not change that to the better. In 1915, British bacteriologist Frederick W. Twort discovered a small agent that infects and kills bacteria, but did not pursue the issue further. Independently, the discovery of \\"an invisible, antagonistic microbe of the dysentery bacillus\\" by d'Herelle was announced on 3 September 1917. The isolation of phages by d'Herelle works like this: #Nutritional medium is infected with bacteria; the medium turns opaque. #The bacteria are infected with phages and die, producing new phages; the medium clears up. #The medium is filtered through porcelain filter, holding back bacteria and larger objects; only the smaller phages pass through. In early 1919, d'H√©relle isolated phages from chicken feces, successfully treating a plague of chicken typhus with them. After this successful experiment on chicken, he felt ready for the first trial on humans. The first patient was healed of dysentery using phage therapy in August 1919. Many more followed. At the time, none, not even d'H√©relle, knew exactly what a phage was. D'H√©relle claimed that it was a biological organism that reproduces, somehow feeding off bacteria. Others, the Nobelist Jules Bordet chief among them, theorized that phages were inanimate chemicals, enzymes specifically, that were already present in bacteria, and only trigger the release of similar proteins, killing the bacteria in the process. Due to this uncertainty, and d'Herelle using phages without much hesitation on humans, his work was under constant attack from many other scientists. It was not until the first phage was observed under an electron microscope by Helmut Ruska in 1939 that its true nature was established. In 1920, d'H√©relle travelled to Indochina, pursuing studies of cholera and the plague, from where he returned at the end of the year. D'H√©relle, officially still an unpaid assistant, found himself without a lab; d'H√©relle later claimed this was a result of a quarrel with the assistant director of the Pasteur Institute, Albert Calmette. The biologist Edouard Pozerski had mercy on d'Herelle and lent him a stool (literally) in his laboratory. In 1921, he managed to publish a monograph, The Bacteriophage: Its Role in Immunity about his works as an official Institute publication, by tricking Calmette. During the following year, doctors and scientists across western Europe took a heightened interest in phage therapy, successfully testing it against a variety of diseases. Since bacteria become resistant against a single phage, d'Herelle suggested using \\"phage cocktails\\" containing different phage strains. Phage therapy soon became a boom, and a great hope in medicine. In 1924, 25 January, d'H√©relle received the honorary doctorate of the University of Leiden,Jaarboek der Rijksuniversiteit te Leiden 1924 : Promoti√´n 17 September 1923 tot 12 Juli 1924, Faculteit der Geneeskunde, Doctoraal geneeskunde, p. 134 as well as the Leeuwenhoek medal, which is only awarded once every ten years. The latter was especially important to him, as his idol Louis Pasteur received the same medal in 1895). The next year, he was nominated eight times for the Nobel prize, though he was never awarded one. Egypt After holding a temporary position at the University of Leiden, d'H√©relle got a position with the Conseil Sanitaire, Maritime et Quarantenaire d'Egypte in Alexandria. The Conseil was put in place to prevent plague and cholera spreading to Europe, with special emphasis on the sanitary concerns about muslim pilgrim groups returning from Mecca and Medina. India D'H√©relle then used phages he collected from plague-infected rats during his 1920 visit to Indochina on human plague patients, with claimed success. The British Empire initiated a vast campaign against plague based on his results. In 1926, the British government in India requested anti-plague phages for trials at the Haffkine Institute. The Institute had trouble maintaining the phages. D'H√©relle took unpaid leave from the Quarantine board of Egypt and went to Bombay at his own expense. The Haffkine Institute had not used Martin's medium, which included macerated pig stomach and beef muscle that would offend Muslims and Hindus. The Institute‚Äôs medium used a hydrochloric acid digest of goat tissue. D'Herelle solved the problem by digestion with papaya juice (a source of papain). Thereafter Lt Col J. Morison, acting director of the Haffkine Institute, became convinced of the effectiveness of phages. Morison wrote to the Government of India to invite d'H√©relle noting that he was \\"a consummate technician, and a ‚Äúmost inspiring worker.\\" D'H√©relle returned to India to work on cholera. He collaborated with the assistant director of the Haffkine Institute, Major Reginald Malone and M.N. Lahiri, who conducted experiments at the Campbell Hospital in Calcutta. The Campbell Hospial team also worked with Russian bacteriologist Igor Nicholas Asheshov (1891‚Äì1961), who was working in Patna. Experiments were conducted both in hospitals and in the field. D'H√©relle and co-workers added phages to wells near camps crowded with many pilgrims. Cases of cholera in the camps were subsequently much lower. The phages were distributed to village head men in Assam and Bengal along with instructions. However, this was a period when Gandhi's Satyagraha was leading to non-cooperation by Indians. Many of the head men did not collaborate and fewer still reported back on the effectiveness. As a result, the experiment was disbanded in 1937. United States and commercial failures D'H√©relle refused a request the following year by the British government to work in India, as he had been offered a professorship at Yale University, which he accepted. Meanwhile, European and US pharmaceutical companies had taken up the production of their own phage medicine, and were promising impossible benefits. To counteract this trend, d'Herelle agreed to co-found a French phage-producing company, piping the money back into phage research. All of the companies suffered from production problems, as results from commercial phage medicine were erratic. Production problems were most likely due to the attempt to mass-produce phages when they were barely understood. The phages may have been damaged and/or too low in concentration. Another possibility is that incorrect diagnoses led to the use of the irrelevant types of phages that were not adapted to the host bacteria of interest. Many studies on the proposed healing effects of phages were also poorly designed and conducted. This situation led to many influential members of the scientific community turning against d'H√©relle. The problems may have been compounded by d'H√©relle‚Äôs reputed bad temper, which was said to have made enemies of several other scientists. Soviet Union In about 1934, d‚ÄòH√©relle went to Tbilisi, Georgia. He was welcomed to the Soviet Union as a hero, bringing knowledge of salvation from diseases ravaging the eastern states. D‚ÄôH√©relle may have accepted Stalin's invitation for two reasons. Firstly, he was said to be enamored with communism. Secondly, d‚ÄôH√©relle was happy to be working with his friend, Professor George Eliava, founder of the Tbilisi Institute, in 1923. Eliava had become friendly with d'Herelle during a visit to the Pasteur Institute in Paris in 1926, and had used that occasion to learn about phages. D'H√©relle worked at the Tbilisi Institute off and on for about a year. He even dedicated one of his books to Comrade Stalin: \\"The Bacteriophage and the Phenomenon of Recovery,\\" written and published in Tbilisi in 1935. Indeed, d‚ÄôH√©relle may have planned to take up permanent residence in Tbililsi, as he had started to build a cottage on the grounds of the Institute. The same building would later house the Georgian headquarters of the NKVD. Fortunes turned abruptly for d‚ÄôH√©relle when Eliava fell in love with the same woman as Lavrenty Beria, head of the secret police. Eliava was executed and denounced as an enemy of the people during one of Stalin's purges. As a result, d'H√©relle fled Tbilisi, never to return. His book was banned from distribution. The Georgian period in d'H√©relle's career has been investigated by author and medical scientist David Shrayer-Petrov. Final return to France Phage therapy boomed, despite all problems, driven by the military on both sides in an effort to keep the troops safe, at least from infections. D'H√©relle could not really enjoy this development; he was kept under house arrest by the German \\"Wehrmacht\\" in Vichy, France. He used the time to write his book \\"The Value of Experiment\\", as well as his memoirs, the latter being 800 pages in length. After D-Day, the new antibiotic drug penicillin became public knowledge and found its way into the hospitals in the west. As it was more reliable and easier to use than phage therapy, it soon became the method of choice, despite side effects and problems with resistant bacteria. Phage therapy remained a common treatment in the states of the Soviet Union, though, until its deconstruction. F√©lix d'H√©relle was stricken with pancreatic cancer and died a forgotten man in Paris in 1949. He was buried in Saint-Mards-en-Othe in the department of the Aube in France. In the 1960s F√©lix d‚ÄôH√©relle's name appeared on a list published by the Nobel Foundation of scientists who had been worthy of receiving the Nobel Prize but did not, for one reason or another. D'Herelle was nominated for the prize ten times.Nomination Archive. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved on 3 March 2019. However, France has not completely forgotten F√©lix d'H√©relle. There is an avenue that bears his name in the 16th arrondissement in Paris. Legacy D'H√©relle became widely known for his imaginative approaches to important problems in theoretical, as well as applied, microbiology. At the same time, he was widely reviled for his self-advertisement, his exaggerated claims of success and his sharp financial practices. He also had a talent for making enemies among powerful senior scientists. D'H√©relle's main legacy lies in the use of phage in the molecular revolution in biology. Max Delbr√ºck and the \\"phage group\\" used bacteriophages to make the discoveries that led to the origins of molecular biology. Much of the initial work on the nature of genetic expression and its regulation was performed with bacteriophages by Francois Jacob, Andre Lwoff and Jacques Monod. In fact, immediately before his studies of the structure of DNA, James Watson had earned his Ph.D. by working on a bacteriophage-related project in Salvador Luria's laboratory. A more detailed account of the use of phage in major biological discoveries can be found on the page, bacteriophage. As one of the earliest applied microbiologists, d'H√©relle's microbe-centered worldview has been noted for its prescience, since microbes are playing increasingly important roles in bioremediation, microbial fuel cells, gene therapy, and other areas with relevance to human well-being. Literary note The novel Arrowsmith written by Sinclair Lewis with scientific help from Paul de Kruif was based to a certain extent on the life of d'H√©relle. The novel The French Cottage (Russ.

After establishing himself as one of the exponents of Regietheater, Flimm was called to manage renowned theaters and festivals. His operatic productions in Germany led to an international career, with operas staged in the Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, England, Italy, and the United States. Life and career Flimm studied theory of drama, literature and sociology at the University of Cologne and started his career with his first position as assistant director at the Munich Kammerspiele in 1968. He had positions as director at the National Theatre Mannheim and as senior director at the Thalia Theater in Hamburg (1973/74), then he worked as freelance director and director at the Schauspiel Cologne. In 1985, he once more joined the Thalia Theatre, where he worked as leading director for the next fifteen years and which became, under his executive, one of the artistically and economically most successful voice theatres in Germany. Among his most important productions in Hamburg are plays by Anton Chekhov (Platonov, 1989; Uncle Vanya, 1995; Three Sisters, 1999), Henrik Ibsen (Peer Gynt, 1985; The Wild Duck, 1994), Arthur Schnitzler (Liebelei, 1988; Das weite Land, 1995) and William Shakespeare (Hamlet, 1986; King Lear, 1992; As You Like It, 1998). With the 1978 production of Luigi Nono‚Äôs Al gran sole carico d‚Äôamore in Frankfurt, Flimm for the first time emerged as an opera director. Three years later, the production of Jacques Offenbach's Les contes d'Hoffmann followed at the Hamburg State Opera, and in 1990 Cos√¨ fan tutte was performed in Amsterdam. For the latter production, Flimm co-operated for the first time with the Austrian conductor Nikolaus Harnoncourt, who became his most important artistic partner. During the last years, Flimm has produced works by Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Verdi, Gounod, Stravinsky, Franz Schreker and others at La Scala in Milan, the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the Berlin State Opera, the Zurich Opera, the Vienna State Opera, and the Hamburg State Opera. In summer 2000, he staged a new version of Wagner's Ring for the Bayreuth Festival, and in June 2002, he was responsible for the scenic realisation of the world premiere of Der Riese vom Steinfeld by Friedrich Cerha at the Vienna State Opera. Flimm was professor at the University of Hamburg and is a member of the Academies of Arts in Hamburg, Munich, Berlin and Frankfurt. He received the title of an honorary doctor of the University of Hildesheim. Amongst his prizes and awards are, amongst others: the Medal for Art and Science of the Free and Hanse Town Hamburg, the Konrad-Wolf-Prize of the Academy of Arts in Berlin, the Bundesverdienstkreuz (Order of the FRG) and the √ñsterreichische Ehrenkreuz f√ºr Kunst und Wissenschaft (Austrian Cross of Honour for Arts and Sciences). Between 1999 and 2003, Flimm was the president of the Deutsche B√ºhnenverein (German Stage Association), 2002 until 2004 director for drama at the Salzburg Festival. From 2005 until 2007, Flimm was the director of the RuhrTriennale, following founding director Gerard Mortier.

On 23 September 1983, while the Boeing 737-2P6 was on approach to Abu Dhabi International Airport, a bomb exploded in the baggage compartment. The plane crashed in the desert near Jebel Ali between Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the UAE. All five crew members and 107 passengers died. Crew and passengers The flight's cockpit crew consisted of the following: * Captain Saoud Al Kindy, an Oman citizen * First officer Khazal Al Qadi, a Bahrain citizen The cabin crew were of mixed nationalities, with only one Bahraini. Two of the crew were from the United Kingdom, the latter who was a native of Peterborough. Other nationalities of the passengers included a Filipino, Indian, Pakistani, and an American. There were 96 Pakistani nationals, many returning to jobs in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain after spending the Eid al Adha holiday with their families in Pakistan. There were also seven passengers from the United Kingdom, one from the United States, and one from Iran.The Gulf Times, Qatar, (24 September 1983)  Bombing  The bomb explosion led to a fire in the baggage compartment. Despite this, the crew managed to send a short distress signal. The aircraft then crashed into the ground, killing all 112 people on board. Investigation The investigation was carried out by the American National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and they released a 400-page report on their findings, which was not immediately published in the Persian Gulf region. The report was revealed in September 1987 by British politician Sir Dudley Smith, under pressure from the parents of British stewardess Lyn Farthing who perished in the crash. The report included a description of the last moments in the cockpit, including a description of Omani captain Saoud Al Kindy praying as the plane nose-dived into the desert.. The report mentioned that everything on board the flight was perfectly normal and voice transcripts showed the crew chatting among themselves. One asked the other if he was on duty the next day, to which he replied \\"No, I've got a day off tomorrow\\". That was followed by a sudden interruption and the recording showed the pilots making a frantic attempt to control the plane. The report indicated a bomb in the baggage hold as the primary cause of the accident, due to the following factors: * A passenger who checked in baggage at Karachi but never boarded the plane. * The nature of injuries to passengers who were seated above the baggage hold. * A sudden interruption to an otherwise normally operating flight. * Data obtained from the aircraft's flight data recorder. Aftermath The bomb was apparently planted by the Abu Nidal Organization (named after Abu Nidal himself), to convince Saudi Arabia to pay protection money to Nidal so as to avoid attacks on their soil. Death certificates issued for the passengers on board showed the cause of death as asphyxiation. As of August 2017, Gulf Air still uses the flight number 771, operating scheduled services between Islamabad and Bahrain.

The party displayed monarchist leanings because many Bavarians had never accepted the overthrow of the House of Wittelsbach in 1918 and there was a period of near separatism in the early 1920s, culminating in Gustav von Kahr's unwillingness to abide by rulings from Berlin during the autumn crisis of 1923. This only came to an end with the shock of Adolf Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch. Following the establishment of a more stable situation throughout Germany, the party came around to a more moderate line under the leadership of Ministerpr√§sident Heinrich Held and party president Fritz Sch√§ffer. Heinrich Held with Friedrich Ebert in January 1925 During the Weimar Republic, the BVP was consistently the most popular party in Bavaria and the party with the most seats in the Landtag of Bavaria. In the second round of the 1925 German presidential election, the main contenders were Paul von Hindenburg and Wilhelm Marx. If either the BVP or the Communist Party (KPD), who put up Ernst Th√§lmann in the second round, had supported Marx, he would have become President instead of the elderly von Hindenburg, who died in 1934 and was succeeded by Hitler. The party may be seen as a precursor to the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU), but alongside the CSU the Bavaria Party which has members elected to city councils in some Bavarian regions and the Bavarian Centre Party were also refounded after World War II and are explicitly claiming the historical heritage of the BVP.

Kaya. In The Penguin Archaeology Guide, edited by Paul Bahn, pp. 228‚Äì229. Penguin, London. growing out of the Byeonhan confederacy of the Samhan period. The traditional period used by historians for Gaya chronology is 42‚Äì532 CE. According to archaeological evidence in the third and fourth centuries some of the city-states of Byeonhan evolved into the Gaya confederacy, which was later annexed by Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The individual polities that made up the Gaya confederacy have been characterized as small city-states.Barnes, Gina L. (2001). Introducing Kaya History and Archaeology. In State Formation in Korea: Historical and Archaeological Perspectives, pp. 179‚Äì200. Curzon, London. The material culture remains of Gaya culture mainly consist of burials and their contents of mortuary goods that have been excavated by archaeologists. Archaeologists interpret mounded burial cemeteries of the late third and early fourth centuries such as Daeseong-dong in Gimhae and Bokcheon-dong in Busan as the royal burial grounds of Gaya polities.Barnes 2001:188‚Äì198. Names Although most commonly referred to as Gaya (Í∞ÄÏïº; Âä†ËÄ∂, ‰ºΩËÄ∂, ‰ºΩÂÄª; ), probably due to the imprecision of transcribing Korean words into hanja, historical sources use a variety of names, including Garak (Í∞ÄÎùΩ; ÈßïÊ¥õ, Ëø¶ËêΩ; ), Gara (Í∞ÄÎùº; Âä†ÁæÖ, ‰ºΩÁæÖ, Ëø¶ÁæÖ, ÊüØÁæÖ; ), Garyang (Í∞ÄÎüâ;Âä†ËâØ; ), and Guya (Íµ¨Ïïº; ÁãóËÄ∂; ).Barnes 2001:182-184. According to Christopher I. Beckwith, \\"The spelling Kaya is the modern Korean reading of the characters used to write the name; the pronunciation /kara/ (transcriptionally *kala) is certain.\\" In Japanese, Gaya is referred to as Mimana (‰ªªÈÇ£), a name with considerable political connotations. However, a word kara („Åã„Çâ, Èüì 'Korea', Âîê '[Tang] China', Êº¢ '[Han] China'), which is probably from the name of Gaya on the Korean Peninsula of antiquity, has been preserved in Japanese with the sense \\"China or Korea, mainland East Asia\\" and, more recently, an even more vague sense of \\"the nations overseas, foreign country.\\"„Äé„Éá„Ç∏„Çø„É´Â§ßËæûÊ≥â„Äè \\"Digital Daijisen\\" (by Â∞èÂ≠¶È§®/SHOGAKUKAN) at Goo Dictionary  Languages  Linguists, including Vovin and Janhunen, suggest that Japonic languages were spoken in large parts of the southern Korean Peninsula. According to Vovin, these \\"Peninsular Japonic languages\\" were replaced by Koreanic-speakers (possibly belonging to the Han-branch).Vovin, Alexander (2013). \\"From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean\\". Korean Linguistics. 15 (2): 222‚Äì240. The later Gaya language likely belonged to the Koreanic Han languages. History According to a legend recorded in the Samguk Yusa written in the 13th century, in the year 42 CE, six eggs descended from heaven with a message that they would be kings. Six boys were born, and within 12 days they grew mature. One of them, named Suro, became the king of Geumgwan Gaya, and the other five founded the remaining five Gayas, namely Daegaya, Seongsan Gaya, Ara Gaya, Goryeong Gaya, and Sogaya.Barnes 2001:180-182. The Gaya polities evolved out of the chiefly political structures of the twelve tribes of the ancient Byeonhan confederacy, one of the Samhan confederacies. The loosely organized chiefdoms resolved into six Gaya groups, centered on Geumgwan Gaya. On the basis of archaeological sources as well as limited written records, scholars such as Sin have identified the late 3rd century as a period of transition from Byeonhan to Gaya, with increasing military activity and changing funerary customs.Sin, K.C. (2000). Relations between Kaya and Wa in the third to fourth centuries CE. Journal of East Asian Archaeology 2(3‚Äì4), 112‚Äì122. SinSin, K.C. (2000). further argues that this was associated with the replacement of the previous elite in some principalities (including Daegaya) by elements from the Buyeo kingdom, who brought a more militaristic ideology and style of rule. The Gaya Confederacy disintegrated under pressure from Goguryeo between 391 CE and 412, although the last Gaya polities remained independent until they were conquered by Silla in 562, as punishment for assisting Baekje in a war against Silla. Economy Polities were situated in the alluvial flats of tributary river valleys and the mouth of the Nakdong. In particular, the mouth of the Nakdong has fertile plains, direct access to the sea, and rich iron deposits. Gaya polities had economies that were based on agriculture, fishing, casting, and long-distance trade. They were particularly known for its iron-working, as Byeonhan had been before it. Gaya polities exported abundant quantities of iron ore, iron armor, and other weaponry to Baekje and the Kingdom of Wa in Yamato period Japan. In contrast to the largely commercial and non-political ties of Byeonhan, Gaya polities seem to have attempted to maintain strong political ties with those kingdoms as well. Politics Several ancient historical records list a number of polities of Gaya. For example, Goryeo Saryak (Í≥†Î†§ÏÇ¨Îûµ; È´òÈ∫óÂè≤Áï•) lists five: Geumgwan Gaya, Goryeong Gaya, Bihwa Gaya, Ara Gaya, and Seongsan Gaya. The various Gaya polities formed a confederacy in the 2nd and 3rd centuries that was centered on the heartland of Geumgwan Gaya in modern Gimhae. After a period of decline, the confederacy was revived around the turn of the 5th and 6th centuries, this time centered on Daegaya of modern Goryeong. However, it was unable to defend itself against the incursions and attacks of the neighboring kingdom of Silla. Mimana/Imna controversy Political and trade relations with Japan have been a source of nationalist controversy in both Korea and Japan. Japanese publicists during the twentieth century looked to the Nihon Shoki, which claims that Gaya (named \\"Mimana\\" also \\"Kara\\" in Japanese) was a military outpost of Japan during the Yamato period (300‚Äì710). While there is no evidence to support this, the claim has nonetheless been advocated at various times by Japanese imperialists, nationalists and press to justify the Japanese colonial rule of Korea between 19th and 20th centuries.. Page 150, Page 169Lee, Peter H & Wm. Theodore De Bary. Sources of Korean Tradition. Columbia University Press, 1997. . Page 14 Archaeological evidence suggests that Gaya polities were the main exporter of technology and culture to Kyushu at that time. The theory of a Japanese outpost is widely rejected in Korea as there was no Japanese local groups at the time that had a strong enough military power to conquer Gaya or any other part of Korea. The technology of Gaya was more advanced than that of the Japanese dynasties of the time. Gallery File:Korea-Gaya royal tombs inside.jpgAn exhibition of royal tomb of Daegaya.

The fastball is the most common type of pitch thrown by pitchers in baseball and softball. \\"Power pitchers,\\" such as former American major leaguers Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens, rely on speed to prevent the ball from being hit, and have thrown fastballs at speeds of (officially) and up to (unofficially). Pitchers who throw more slowly can put movement on the ball, or throw it on the outside of home plate where batters can't easily reach it. Fastballs are usually thrown with backspin, so that the Magnus effect creates an upward force on the ball. This causes it to fall less rapidly than expected, and sometimes causes an optical illusion often called a rising fastball. Although it is impossible for a human to throw a baseball fast enough and with enough backspin for the ball to actually rise, to the batter the pitch seems to rise due to the unexpected lack of natural drop on the pitch. A straight pitch is achieved by gripping the ball with the fingers across the wide part of the seam (called a \\"four-seam fastball\\") so that both the index and middle fingers are touching two seams perpendicularly. A sinking fastball is thrown by gripping it across the narrow part (a \\"two-seam fastball\\") so that both the index and middle fingers are along a seam. Lateral motion is achieved by holding a four-seam fastball off-center (a \\"cut fastball\\"), and sinking action with a lateral break is thrown by splitting the fingers along the seams (a \\"split-finger fastball\\"). Colloquially, a fastball pitcher 'throws heat' or 'puts steam on it', among many other variants. Pitches An animated diagram of a four-seam fastball Four-seam fastball The four-seam fastball is the most common variant of the fastball. The pitch is used often by the pitcher to get ahead in the count or when he needs to throw a strike. This type of fastball is intended to have minimal lateral movement, relying more on its velocity. It is often perceived as the fastest pitch a pitcher throws, with recorded top speeds above 100 mph. The fastest pitch recognized by MLB was on September 25, 2010, at Petco Park in San Diego by then Cincinnati Reds left- handed relief pitcher Aroldis Chapman. It was clocked at 105.1 miles per hour. April 19, 2011 Chapman lit up the stadium radar gun at 106 MPH (the TV-reading had his pitch at 105 MPH, and the pitchF/X reading was actually 102.4 MPH). Two general methods are used to throw a four-seam fastball. The first and most traditional way is to find the horseshoe seam area, or the area where the seams are the farthest apart. Keeping those seams parallel to the body, the pitcher places his index and middle fingers perpendicular to them with the pads on the farthest seam from him. The thumb then rests underneath the ball about in the middle of the two fingers. With this grip, the thumb will generally have no seam on which to rest. The four seam fastball is widely regarded as the main key to advancing to the next level of play. One of a baseball scout's main criteria when scouting a prospect is how fast he throws a four seam fastball. The game of baseball keeps on progressing, and as research on the physics of throwing is published and recognized, fastball velocity training has become more effective. This can be shown by looking at the average fastball velocity in the major leagues as time progresses. In 2008 the average fastball thrown in the MLB was 90.9 mph. 5 years later it had risen to 92.0. To show the effect that this increase in velocity has had on hitters in the big leagues, we can look at the runs scored stat. In 2008, the average number of runs a team scored a game was 4.6; 5 years later as the velocity increased, the average dropped by half a run a game, to 4.0. The pitch velocity gone up so much mostly by the development of better training and clearer communication within the baseball community that velocity is so valued. People like Tom House, Eric Cressey, Kyle Boddy, and Ron Wolforth have all pushed the edge and dedicated careers to research on what makes the ultimate pitcher. Pitchers are getting bigger, faster and stronger, and pushing their bodies in the weight room as well as with weighted ball throwing. All of this has created a faster, more powerful game for pitchers on the mound today. Higher pitch velocities has resulted a fewer hits and other imbalances. A more distant pitcher's mound and other changes have been proposed to restore balance. Two-seam fastball A two-seam fastball, sometimes called a two-seamer, tailing fastball, running fastball, or sinker is another variant of the straight fastball. It is designed to have more movement than a four-seam fastball, so the batter cannot hit it hard, but it can be more difficult to master and control. Because of the deviation from the straight trajectory, the two-seam fastball is sometimes called a moving fastball. The pitcher grabs a baseball and finds the area on it where the seams are the closest together, and puts his index and middle fingers on each of those seams. A sinker is a similar pitch that drops 3 to 6 inches more than a typical two-seam fastball; this causes batters to hit ground balls more often, mostly due to the tilted sidespin on the ball. Each finger should be touching the seam from the pads or tips to almost the ball of each finger. The thumb should rest underneath the ball in the middle of those two fingers, finding the apex of the horseshoe part of the seam. The thumb needs to rest on that seam from the side to the middle of its pad. If the middle finger is used, more whipping action occurs, making the pitch go around 10 mph faster. This ball tends to move for the pitcher a little bit depending on velocity, arm slot angle, and pressure points of the fingers. Retired pitchers Greg Maddux and Pedro Mart√≠nez were known for their effective two-seamers. Depending on the grip and pressure applied with the fingers, sometimes the two-seam fastball features more sink than lateral movement. Sinkerballers tend to induce a lot of ground ball outs because hitters tend to swing over the ball due to the late downward movement, thus often end up beating the ball into the ground. Roberto Hern√°ndez of the Philadelphia Phillies, Justin Masterson of the St. Louis Cardinals, Derek Lowe of the New York Yankees, Tim Hudson of the San Francisco Giants, Aaron Cook of the Colorado Rockies, Clay Buchholz of the Boston Red Sox, Roy Halladay of the Philadelphia Phillies, Chris Volstad of the Chicago White Sox, Trevor Cahill of the Chicago Cubs, and Bronson Arroyo of the Arizona Diamondbacks are or were well known for their sinkers, consistently ranking high in the league in ground ball-to-fly ball ratio. Rising fastball The rising fastball is an effect perceived by some batters, but is a baseball myth. Some batters are under the impression that they have seen a \\"rising\\" fastball, which starts with the trajectory of a normal fastball, but which as it approaches the plate rises several inches and gains a burst of speed. Tom Seaver, Jim Palmer, Sandy Koufax, Dwight Gooden, Nolan Ryan and Chan Ho Park have been described as paramount pitchers with this kind of ball action. Such a pitch is known to be beyond the physical capabilities of pitchers, due to the very high backspin required to overcome gravity with the Magnus effect. While not physically impossible (conservation of momentum is maintained through imparting the required opposing momentum to air, as an airplane does at takeoff), the amount of spin required is beyond the capabilities of a human arm. It has been explained as an optical illusion. What is likely happening is that the pitcher first throws a fastball at one speed, and then, using an identical arm motion, throws another fastball at a higher speed. The higher-speed fastball arrives faster and sinks less due to its high speed. The added back-spin from the higher speed further decreases the amount of sink. When the pitch is thrown, the batter expects a fastball at the same speed, yet it arrives more quickly and at a higher level. The batter perceives it as a fastball which has risen and increased in speed. A switch from a two-seam to a fastball can enhance this effect. This perception may also be created by a tall, hard-throwing pitcher who throws the ball from a higher release point on an elevated mound (the pitcher's rubber is 10 inches above the field level). Factoring in the element of depth perception when the hitter watches the pitcher from 60 ft 6 in away from the pitcher's mound, and the hitter perceives the pitcher's size and positioning on the mound to be less elevated than it actually is. Hence, to the hitter, an overhand pitch will appear to be thrown at a hitter's shoulder level (or even belt level), as opposed to several inches above the hitter's head, from where the pitch is actually released from the pitcher's hand. This perception enhances the apparent \\"rising\\" motion of the fastball when the pitch passes the hitter at a higher level than where the hitter perceived the pitch to have left the pitcher's hand. It is possible for a rising fastball to be thrown by a submarine pitcher because of the technique with which they throw the ball. Because they throw almost underhanded with their knuckles near the field surface, the batter perceives the sensation of the ball going upward because of its low starting point and flight trajectory. This is not the traditional rising fastball batters believe they see. This type of movement is similar to a rising fastball in fast-pitch softball. Left-hander Sid Fernandez was known for throwing a rising fastball from a slightly \\"submarine\\" motion. An animated diagram of a cutter Cutter A cut fastball, or \\"cutter\\", is similar to a slider, but the pitcher tends to use a four-seam grip. The pitcher shifts the grip on a four-seamer (often by slightly rotating the thumb inwards and the two top fingers to the outside) to create more spin. This usually causes the pitch to shift inwards or outwards by a few inches, less than a typical slider, and often late. A cutter is effective for pitchers with a strong four- seamer since the grip and delivery look virtually identical. The unexpected motion will often fool batters into hitting the ball off-center, or missing it altogether. Mariano Rivera, a now retired reliever for the New York Yankees, was known for throwing a cutter. In his prime, Rivera could deliver late motion while throwing the ball around 96 mph. Al Leiter rode his cutter to 162 career wins and a no-hitter. Roy Halladay threw a cut fastball, but claimed that overusing it had given him forearm trouble. This may have prematurely ended Halladay's 2006 season due to forearm stiffness, since the grip causes more stress than a standard four-seamer. Yankee Andy Pettitte is another pitcher who throws the cutter. On a June 3, 2007, game against the Red Sox, announcer Joe Morgan estimated that of Pettitte's 87 pitches, 83 of them were cutters. Jamie Moyer used a cutter that became an important pitch due to his relatively low velocity late in his career. Many other major league pitchers have added the cut fastball, as well. Split-finger fastball The split- finger fastball, or \\"splitter\\", is truly an off-speed pitch rather than a type of fastball. Like the changeup, to which it is a close relative, it is thrown with the same arm motion as a normal fastball, but the adjusted grip causes it to behave quite differently. The ball does not have the characteristically tight spin of a fastball. The ball appears to tumble in a knuckleball-like fashion; but it is much faster than a knuckleball. The ball is gripped tightly with the index and middle fingers \\"split\\" along the outside of the horseshoe seam. It is important that at least one finger is touching the seam, as the ability to control the release of the ball is derived from this contact. The release is the same as a fastball. A splitter usually drops as it approaches the plate, and breaks to either the right or left. The forkball is a similar pitch, though it is slower and gripped with a more exaggerated split of the fingers. A pitcher generally needs long, flexible fingers to effectively throw this pitch. Due to similarities in speed and movement, some pitchers' split- finger fastballs are misidentified as changeups. It helps to have larger hands to throw this pitch. Because the fingers are spread wider than normal on the baseball, this pitch produces more stress from the hand up through the arm. While the mechanics are the same as a normal fastball, the stress it places on the hand and arm is different. Over time it is possible to damage the arm. It is therefore not recommended for younger pitchers to learn this pitch. Older pitchers should feel comfortable deploying this pitch, but to use it in moderation. The splitter is an effective pitch because the hitter generally picks up the movement later and either swings over the ball or produces a weakly hit ground ball. The split-finger is used currently by pitchers such as Jonathan Papelbon, and Masahiro Tanaka. Former players noted for use of the split-finger fastball include Bruce Sutter, Mike Scott, John Smoltz, Jack Morris, Kazuhiro Sasaki, Bryan Harvey, Roger Clemens, Dan Haren, and Fred Breining. Incurve The incurve was a term used until about 1930 used to describe a simple fastball. As a curveball was often called an \\"outcurve\\", one might assume that an incurve is the opposite of a curveball, in other words, the modern screwball. However, this does not appear to be so, as cited by John McGraw. :All balls that are twisted out of their natural course are called curves. The outcurve, the drop, down shoot, and so on, are simply a curve ball to the professional player. To us there is no such thing as an incurve. That is what we call a fastball. Of course, I am assuming the pitcher is right- handed. A so-called incurve is nothing more than a ball thrown in a natural way with great force. A ball thus thrown will naturally curve inward, to a certain extent. Side-arm fastball A side-arm fast ball is thrown from an angle different from the normal one. It is at a lower angle and is thrown from the side, hence the name \\"side\\"-arm. It will have a sinking motion to the right if the pitcher is right-handed, or to the left if the pitcher is left- handed. It is usually slower than a normal four-seam fastball.

While a corona discharge (CD) is usually revealed by a relatively steady glow or brush discharge (BD) in air, partial discharges within solid insulation system are not visible. PD can occur in a gaseous, liquid or solid insulating medium. It often starts within gas voids, such as voids in solid epoxy insulation or bubbles in transformer oil. Protracted partial discharge can erode solid insulation and eventually lead to breakdown of insulation. Discharge mechanism PD usually begins within voids, cracks, or inclusions within a solid dielectric, at conductor- dielectric interfaces within solid or liquid dielectrics, or in bubbles within liquid dielectrics. Since PDs are limited to only a portion of the insulation, the discharges only partially bridge the distance between electrodes. PD can also occur along the boundary between different insulating materials. A partial discharge within solid insulation. When a spark jumps the gap within the gas-filled void, a small current flows in the conductors, attenuated by the voltage divider network Cx, Cy, Cz in parallel with the bulk capacitance Cb Partial discharges within an insulating material are usually initiated within gas-filled voids within the dielectric. Because the dielectric constant of the void is considerably less than the surrounding dielectric, the electric field across the void is significantly higher than that across an equivalent distance of dielectric. If the voltage stress across the void is increased above the corona inception voltage (CIV) for the gas within the void, PD activity will start within the void. PD can also occur along the surface of solid insulating materials if the surface tangential electric field is high enough to cause a breakdown along the insulator surface. This phenomenon commonly manifests itself on overhead line insulators, particularly on contaminated insulators during days of high humidity. Overhead lines use air as their insulation medium. PD equivalent circuit The equivalent circuit of a dielectric incorporating a cavity can be modeled as a capacitive voltage divider in parallel with another capacitor. The upper capacitor of the divider represents the parallel combination of the capacitances in series with the void and the lower capacitor represents the capacitance of the void. The parallel capacitor represents the remaining unvoided capacitance of the sample. Partial discharge currents Whenever partial discharge is initiated, high frequency transient current pulses will appear and persist for nanoseconds to a microsecond, then disappear and reappear repeatedly as the voltage sinewave goes through the zero crossing. The PD happens near the peak voltage both positive and negative. PD pulses are easy to measure using the HFCT method. The HFCT is a \\"high frequency\\" current transducer which is clamped around the case ground of the component being tested. The severity of the PD is measured by measuring the burst interval between the end of a burst and the beginning of the next burst. As the insulation breakdown worsens, the burst interval will shorten due to the breakdown happening at lower voltages. This burst interval will continue to shorten until a critical 2 millisecond point is reached. At this 2 ms point the discharge is very close to the zero crossing and will fail with a full blown discharge and major failure. The HFCT method needs to be used because of the small magnitude and short duration of these PD events. The HFCT method is done while the component being tested stays energized and loaded. It is completely non-intrusive. Another method of measuring these currents is to put a small current-measuring resistor in series with the sample and then view the generated voltage on an oscilloscope via a matched coaxial cable. When PD, arcing or sparking occurs, electromagnetic waves propagate away from the fault site in all directions which contact the transformer tank and travel to earth (ground cable) where the HFCT is located to capture any EMI or EMP within the transformer, breaker, PT, CT, HV Cable, MCSG, LTC, LA, generator, large hv motors, etc. Detection of the high-frequency pulses will identify the existence of partial discharge, arcing or sparking. After PD or arcing is detected, the next step is to locate the fault area. Using the acoustic emission method (AE), 4 or more AE sensors are placed on the transformer shell where the AE and HFCT wavedata is collected at the same time. Bandpass filtering is used to eliminate interference from system noises. Discharge detection and measuring systems With the partial discharge measurement, the dielectric condition of high voltage equipment can be evaluated, and electrical treeing in the insulation can be detected and located. Partial discharge measurement can localize the damaged part of an insulated system. Data collected during partial discharge testing is compared to measurement values of the same cable gathered during the acceptance-test or to factory quality control standards. This allows simple and quick classification of the dielectric condition (new, strongly aged, faulty) of the device under test and appropriate maintenance and repair measures may be planned and organized in advance. Partial discharge measurement is applicable to cables and accessories with various insulation materials, such as polyethylene or paper-insulated lead-covered (PILC) cable. Partial discharge measurement is routinely carried out to assess the condition of the insulation system of rotating machines (motors and generators), transformers, and gas-insulated switchgear.  Partial discharge measurement system  A partial discharge measurement system basically consists of: * a cable or other object being tested * a coupling capacitor of low inductance design * a high-voltage supply with low background noise * high-voltage connections * a high voltage filter to reduce background noise from the power supply * a partial discharge detector * PC software for analysis A partial discharge detection system for in-service, energized electric power equipment: * a cable, transformer, or any MV/HV power equipment * Ultra High Frequency Sensor (UHF) Detection Bandwidth 300 MHz-1.5GHz * High Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT) Bandwidth 500 kHz-50 MHz * Ultrasonic microphone with center frequency 40 kHz * Acoustic Contact Sensor with detection bandwidth 20 kHz - 300 kHz * TEV sensor or coupling capacitor 3 MHz-100 MHz * Phase- resolved analysis system to compare pulse timing to AC frequency  The principle of partial discharge measurement  A number of discharge detection schemes and partial discharge measurement methods have been invented since the importance of PD was realised early in the last century. Partial discharge currents tend to be of short duration and have rise times in the nanosecond realm. On an oscilloscope, the discharges appear as evenly spaced burst events that occur at the peak of the sinewave. Random events are arcing or sparking. The usual way of quantifying partial discharge magnitude is in picocoulombs. The intensity of partial discharge is displayed versus time. An automatic analysis of the reflectograms collected during the partial discharge measurement ‚Äì using a method referred to as time domain reflectometry (TDR) ‚Äì allows the location of insulation irregularities. They are displayed in a partial discharge mapping format. A phase-related depiction of the partial discharges provides additional information, useful for the evaluation of the device under test. Calibration setup The actual charge change that occurs due to a PD event is not directly measurable, therefore, apparent charge is used instead. The apparent charge (q) of a PD event is the charge that, if injected between the terminals of the device under test, would change the voltage across the terminals by an amount equivalent to the PD event. This can be modeled by the equation: :q= C_b \\\\Delta(V_c) Apparent charge is not equal to the actual amount of changing charge at the PD site, but can be directly measured and calibrated. 'Apparent charge' is usually expressed in picocoulombs. This is measured by calibrating the voltage of the spikes against the voltages obtained from a calibration unit discharged into the measuring instrument. The calibration unit is quite simple in operation and merely comprises a square wave generator in series with a capacitor connected across the sample. Usually these are triggered optically to enable calibration without entering a dangerous high voltage area. Calibrators are usually disconnected during the discharge testing. Laboratory methods * Wideband PD detection circuits *:In wideband detection, the impedance usually comprises a low Q parallel-resonant RLC circuit. This circuit tends to attenuate the exciting voltage (usually between 50 and 60 Hz) and amplify the voltage generated due to the discharges. * Tuned (narrow band) detection circuits * Differential discharge bridge methods * Acoustic and Ultrasonic methods Field testing methods Field measurements preclude the use of a Faraday cage and the energising supply can also be a compromise from the ideal. Field measurements are therefore prone to noise and may be consequently less sensitive.D. F. Warne Advances in high voltage engineering, Institution of Electrical Engineers, 2004 , page 166 Factory quality PD tests in the field require equipment that may not be readily available, therefore other methods have been developed for field measurement which, while not as sensitive or accurate as standardized measurements, are substantially more convenient. By necessity field measurements have to be quick, safe and simple if they are to be widely applied by owners and operators of MV and HV assets. Transient Earth Voltages (TEVs) are induced voltage spikes on the surface of the surrounding metalwork. TEVs were first discovered in 1974 by Dr John ReevesDavies, N., Tang, J.C.Y., Shiel, P., (2007), Benefits and Experiences of Non-Intrusive Partial Discharge Measurements on MV Switchgear, CIRED 2007, Paper 0475. of EA Technology. TEVs occur because the partial discharge creates current spikes in the conductor and hence also in the earthed metal surrounding the conductor. Dr John Reeves established that TEV signals are directly proportional to the condition of the insulation for all switchgear of the same type measured at the same point. TEV readings are measured in dBmV. TEV pulses are full of high frequency components and hence the earthed metalwork presents a considerable impedance to ground. Therefore, voltage spikes are generated. These will stay on the inner surface of surrounding metalwork (to a depth of approximately 0.5 ¬µm in mild steel at 100 MHz) and loop around to the outer surface wherever there is an electrical discontinuity in the metalwork. There is a secondary effect whereby electromagnetic waves generated by the partial discharge also generate TEVs on the surrounding metalwork ‚Äì the surrounding metalwork acting like an antenna. TEVs are a very convenient phenomenon for measuring and detecting partial discharges as they can be detected without making an electrical connection or removing any panels. While this method may be useful to detect some issues in switchgear and surface tracking on internal components, the sensitivity is not likely to be sufficient to detect issues within solid dielectric cable systems. Ultrasonic measurement relies on fact that the partial discharge will emit sound waves. The frequency for emissions is \\"white\\" noise in nature and therefore produces ultrasonic structure waves through the solid or liquid filled electrical component. Using a structure borne ultrasonic sensor on the exterior of the item under examination, internal partial discharge can be detected and located when the sensor is placed closest to the source. HFCT Method This method is ideal for detecting and determining the severity of the PD by burst interval measurement. The closer the bursts get to \\"zero voltage crossing\\" the more severe and critical the PD fault is. Location of the fault area is accomplished using AE described above. Electro Magnetic Field detection picks up the radio waves generated by the partial discharge. As noted before the radio waves can generate TEVs on the surrounding metalwork. More sensitive measurement, particularly at higher voltages, can be achieved using in built UHF antennas or external antenna mounted on insulating spacers in the surrounding metalwork. Directional Coupler detection picks up the signals emanating from a partial discharge. This method is ideal for joints and accessories, with the sensors being located on the semicon layers at the joint or accessory.Craatz P., Plath R., Heinrich R., Kalkner W.: Sensitive On-Site PD Measurement and Location using Directional Coupler Sensors in 110kV Prefabricated Joints, 11th ISH99, London, paper 5.317 P5 Effects of partial discharge in insulation systems Once begun, PD causes progressive deterioration of insulating materials, ultimately leading to electrical breakdown. The effects of PD within high voltage cables and equipment can be very serious, ultimately leading to complete failure. The cumulative effect of partial discharges within solid dielectrics is the formation of numerous, branching partially conducting discharge channels, a process called treeing. Repetitive discharge events cause irreversible mechanical and chemical deterioration of the insulating material. Damage is caused by the energy dissipated by high energy electrons or ions, ultraviolet light from the discharges, ozone attacking the void walls, and cracking as the chemical breakdown processes liberate gases at high pressure. The chemical transformation of the dielectric also tends to increase the electrical conductivity of the dielectric material surrounding the voids. This increases the electrical stress in the (thus far) unaffected gap region, accelerating the breakdown process. A number of inorganic dielectrics, including glass, porcelain, and mica, are significantly more resistant to PD damage than organic and polymer dielectrics. In paper-insulated high-voltage cables, partial discharges begin as small pinholes penetrating the paper windings that are adjacent to the electrical conductor or outer sheath. As PD activity progresses, the repetitive discharges eventually cause permanent chemical changes within the affected paper layers and impregnating dielectric fluid. Over time, partially conducting carbonized trees are formed. This places greater stress on the remaining insulation, leading to further growth of the damaged region, resistive heating along the tree, and further charring (sometimes called tracking). This eventually culminates in the complete dielectric failure of the cable and, typically, an electrical explosion. Partial discharges dissipate energy in the form of heat, sound, and light. Localized heating from PD may cause thermal degradation of the insulation. Although the level of PD heating is generally low for DC and power line frequencies, it can accelerate failures within high voltage high-frequency equipment. The integrity of insulation in high voltage equipment can be confirmed by monitoring the PD activities that occur through the equipment's life. To ensure supply reliability and long-term operational sustainability, PD in high-voltage electrical equipment should be monitored closely with early warning signals for inspection and maintenance. PD can usually be prevented through careful design and material selection. In critical high voltage equipment, the integrity of the insulation is confirmed using PD detection equipment during the manufacturing stage as well as periodically through the equipment's useful life. PD prevention and detection are essential to ensure reliable, long-term operation of high voltage equipment used by electric power utilities. Monitoring partial discharge events in transformers and reactors Utilizing UHF couplers and sensors, partial discharge signals are detected and carried to a master control unit where a filtering process is applied to reject interference. The amplitude and frequency of the UHF partial discharge pulses are digitized, analyzed and processed in order to generate an appropriate partial discharge data output, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) alarm. Depending on the provider of the system, the partial discharge outputs are accessible through either a local area network, via modem or even a via web-based viewer.

In 2002, Herrington became the first enrolled member of a Native American tribe to fly in space. He is married to Debra Ann Farmer. Early life Herrington was born in Wetumka, Oklahoma, into the Chickasaw Nation. He grew up in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Riverton, Wyoming, and Plano, Texas, where he graduated from Plano Senior High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in applied mathematics from the University of Colorado Colorado Springs before receiving his commission in the United States Navy in 1984. To honor his Chickasaw heritage, Herrington, an enrolled member of the Chickasaw Nation, carried its flag on his thirteen-day trip to space. The flag had been presented to him by Chickasaw Nation Governor Bill Anoatubby. United States Navy career Herrington received his commission in the U.S. Navy from the Aviation Officer Candidate School at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida in March 1984. In March 1985 he was designated a Naval Aviator and proceeded to Patrol Squadron Thirty-One (VP-31) at Moffett Field, California for training in the P-3C Orion. His first operational assignment was with Patrol Squadron Forty-Eight (VP-48) where he made three operational deployments, two to the Northern Pacific-based from Naval Air Facility Adak, Alaska and one to the Western Pacific-based from the Naval Air Station Cubi Point, Philippines. While assigned to VP-48, Herrington was designated a Patrol Plane Commander, Mission Commander, and Patrol Plane Instructor Pilot. Following completion of his first operational tour, Herrington returned to VP-31 as a Fleet Replacement Squadron Instructor Pilot. While assigned to VP-31, he was selected to attend the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland in January 1990. After graduation in December 1990, he reported to the Force Warfare Aircraft Test Directorate as a project test pilot for the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System. Herrington conducted additional flight test assignments flying numerous variants of the P-3 Orion as well as the T-34C and the de Havilland Canada Dash 7. Following his selection as an Aeronautical Engineering Duty Officer (AEDO), Herrington reported to the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, where he attained a Master of Science degree in aeronautical engineering in June 1995. Herrington was assigned as a special projects officer to the Bureau of Naval Personnel Sea Duty Component when selected for the astronaut program. During his military service, he was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal, Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation, Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation, Coast Guard Special Operations Service Ribbon, National Defense Service Medal, Sea Service Ribbons (3), and various other service awards. NASA career Selected by NASA in April 1996, Herrington reported to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in August 1996. He completed two years of training and evaluation, and qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Herrington was assigned to the Flight Support Branch of the Astronaut Office where he served as a member of the Astronaut Support Personnel team responsible for Shuttle launch preparations and post-landing operations.

He was politically active, successively, in the Liberal Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. A life peer since 1967, he became the first Green Party member of either of the British Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom when he joined the Green Party in 1999. Early and private life Beaumont's father, Michael Beaumont, was a Conservative MP for Aylesbury, and his paternal grandfather, Hubert Beaumont, was the Radical MP for Eastbourne from 1906 to 1910 and son of Wentworth Beaumont, 1st Baron Allendale. Beaumont's mother, Faith Pease, died when he was six; his maternal grandfather was the Liberal politician Jack Pease, 1st Baron Gainford. Beaumont was educated at Eton College and Gordonstoun School. He studied agriculture at Christ Church, Oxford, where he joined the Bullingdon Club and founded the Wagers club, devoted, in the words of one author, to \\"bringing back the devil-may-care atmosphere of the Regency Bucks\\". He graduated with a Fourth, and then trained for holy orders at Westcott House in Cambridge. He was ordained as a deacon in 1955 and as a priest in 1956. He married Mary Rose Wauchope (a cousin of Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon) in 1955, with whom he had two sons and two daughters (Hubert Wentworth, Alaric Charles Blackett, Atalanta Armstrong, and Ariadne Grace Beaumont), and a total of ten grandchildren. His son, Alaric, died in a road traffic accident in 1980. Also in that year, Hubert married Katherine Abel Smith, a great-great-great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. Church career He became an Anglican priest in Kowloon, Hong Kong. He served as assistant chaplain at St John's Cathedral in Hong Kong from 1955 to 1957 and then was vicar of Christ Church, Kowloon Tong, until 1959. Having received a substantial inheritance in that year, he returned to England to live in Mayfair and then Hampstead. Meanwhile, he was an honorary curate at St Stephen's Church in Rochester Row, Westminster, from 1960 to 1963. He represented the Diocese of London in the Church Assembly from 1960 to 1965. He became involved in church reform, supporting the Parish and People movement, and was owner of the political weekly Time and Tide and then the church reform magazine Prism (later New Christian, which merged with American Christian Century). Considering his views and lifestyle incompatible with his position as a priest, he resigned from active ministry in 1973. In 1984, however, he returned to active ministry and became priest-in-charge of St Philip and All Saints with St Luke, Kew in the Diocese of Southwark, and then retired to Clapham in 1991. The Mary Rose School, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, a special school for students with severe and complex learning needs, is named after his wife. Political career After making a substantial donation to the Liberal Party, he became its joint honorary treasurer in 1962‚Äì1963. He was made a Liberal Life peer as Baron Beaumont of Whitley, of Child's Hill in Greater London, in 1967. He was chair of the Liberal Party in 1967‚Äì1968 and then President in 1969‚Äì1970. In Parliament he was Liberal spokesman on education and the arts until 1986. He also served as leader of the Liberals in the Council of Europe. He was co-ordinator of the Green Alliance from 1978 to 1980. He joined the Liberal Democrats, but, objecting to their support for free trade, he moved to the Green Party in 1999, and became the Green Party spokesman on agriculture. He stood for election to Lambeth Council for the Green Party in Clapham Common ward in 2006. Beaumont was a Eurosceptic, and for many years he was a vice-president of the cross-party Campaign for an Independent Britain, which campaigned against British membership of the European Union.Beaumont is shown as one of the patrons, and later one of the vice-presidents, of the CIB on CIB literature from the early 1990s to his death in 2008, such as the following CIB press release: British fishermen protest plans to \\"celebrate\\" the EU's fifty years of disaster, Campaign for an Independent Britain, 01/05/2007. In a memorable action, Beaumont put forth in May 1996 a bill to \\"draw up a plan to prohibit piped music and the showing of television programmes in the public areas of hospitals and on public transport; and to require the wearing of headphones by persons listening to music in the public areas of hospitals and on public transport.\\" Other achievements Beaumont was a patron of transgender equality campaign group Press for Change. He was chairman of the Albany Trust between 1969‚Äì1971, chairman of the Institute of Research into Mental and Multiple Handicap between 1971‚Äì1973, president of the British Federation of Film Societies between 1973‚Äì1979, and a member of the executive of Church Action on Poverty. He was chairman of \\"Exit\\" (as the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, the present- day Dignity in Dying, was known in the early 1980s) in 1980. He edited The Selective Ego, an abridged volume of the diaries of James Agate, published in 1976, and a Liberal Cookbook, published in 1972. He also wrote a food column for the Illustrated London News from 1976‚Äì80, and wrote the book The End of the Yellowbrick Road, published in 1997. Baron Beaumont of Whitley died at St Thomas' Hospital in London after being hospitalised for several weeks. He was survived by his wife, one of their two sons, and their two daughters.

Related to the split-finger fastball, the forkball is held between the first two fingers and thrown hard, snapping the wrist. The forkball differs from the split-fingered fastball, however, in that the ball is jammed deeper between the first two fingers. The result is that the forkball is generally thrown slightly slower than the splitter, but has more of a \\"tumbling\\" action akin to the movement of a 12‚Äì6 curveball, as it will drop off the plate before it gets to the catcher's mitt. Use in the Major Leagues The forkball has been favored by several current and former major league pitchers, including Tom Henke, Kevin Appier, Hideo Nomo, Jos√© Valverde, Jos√© Arredondo, Ken Hill, Justin Speier, Kazuhiro Sasaki, Jos√© Contreras, Chien-Ming Wang, Junichi Tazawa, Robert Coello, and Edwar Ram√≠rez. Two-time Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum used a changeup with forkball movement as his strike-out pitch. Hall of Famer Gaylord Perry, winner of the Cy Young Award in both leagues, was arguably the greatest practitioner of the forkball. In addition, a number of NPB players throw forkballs, including Kazumi Saito of the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, who has ridden his forkball to two Eiji Sawamura Awards. In actuality, the forkball is more popular than the splitter in Japan, and the majority of the best pitchers in Japan have one in their arsenal. Former Major League pitchers Dave Stewart and M√©lido P√©rez were two of the most highly regarded forkball pitchers in the late 1980s. Late in his career, the forkball was also used by Sandy Koufax. Jack Morris used a forkball as his primary strikeout pitch while winning more games than any other pitcher in the 1980s. Roy Face and Lindy McDaniel were relief pitchers who pitched for 16 and 21 years, respectively, in the Major Leagues and were forkballers. Face started his career in 1953 and McDaniel in 1955. Throwing mechanics The forkball is thrown with the same arm motion and speed of a fastball, but at release point, the wrist is snapped downward. Additionally, allowing the ball to spin off the middle or index finger may result in additional movement. Origin of the forkball \\"Bullet\\" Joe Bush of the Boston Red Sox is credited with the invention of the forkball, shortly following World War I. However, it was popularized by former relief pitcher Elroy Face of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Face single-handedly made the forkball a topic of popularized discussion through his effective use of the pitch. Medical concerns The forkball, if thrown correctly, is known to be a cause of significant and increasingly common damage to the shoulder and elbow. Famous forkballers, particularly Japanese players, have often required surgery to repair bone fractures or damaged tendons, sometimes several times in their careers. Younger players are discouraged from attempting to throw the forkball before reaching the age of 17‚Äì18. One such pitcher was former Yokohama BayStars and Seattle Mariners closer Kazuhiro Sasaki. However, these injuries are avoidable; if the pitcher does not snap his wrist in the motion, then the forkball theoretically should have no damaging effect to his arm. The only tradeoff is a slight decrease in speed; the pitch should still break the same way.

He was a journalist and businessman. He is best known for allegations of political corruption during this congressional term. The House of Representatives did not specify his offense, but decided it was constitutionally unable to punish him for actions that took place before he entered Congress. He did not run for reelection.Mark Grossman, Political Corruption in America: In encyclopedia of scandals, power, and greed (2003) p. 207. King was born in Malone, New York in Franklin County where he grew up and attended the local schools and did agricultural work. In 1846, he moved to Otsego County, New York and worked as a solicitor for mutual insurance companies. He became editor of the Free Democrat of Cooperstown, New York in 1852. In 1858, King moved to Minneapolis, where he continued in journalism and raising cattle. He founded the State Atlas newspaper in 1859. King became known for his strong editorials. Later, he helped create the Minneapolis Tribune, and became a major stockholder in the Pioneer Press in neighboring Saint Paul. There are also indications that he became a principal owner of the Minneapolis Journal. King served as postmaster of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1861 to 1865 and 1867 to 1873. In 1874, he served as surveyor general of logs and lumber in the . Following that, he served one term during the 44th congress. In Minnesota, Colonel King also became involved in railroads and related pursuits. There are indications he was among the first people to lay streetcar rails in Minneapolis, perhaps as early as 1867. In 1877, he built a large pavilion at Lake Calhoun in the city. A tourism boom was occurring at the time. He later sold it to Louis F. Menage, who converted it to a hotel. However, the hotel was eventually destroyed by a fire. During the 1870s, built his acclaimed estate. Lyndale Farm reached south from 34th Street to Lake Harriet, allowing ample room to gather choice breeds of cattle for breeding purposes. His herd, including Shorthorn, Ayrshire, and Jersey, evolved into the best in the nation‚Äîto some, the world's finest. King's land, originally located in Richfield, was annexed to Minneapolis in 1867 by the state legislature.Johnson, Fred (2008) Richfield: Minnesota's Oldest Suburb, Richfield Historical Society Upon his death in Minneapolis in 1900, his body was interred at Lakewood Cemetery. It appears that the \\"Colonel\\" prefix is probably a nickname rather than an official military rank.

The break on the pitch is shorter than that of the curveball, and the release technique is 'between' those of a curveball and a fastball. The slider is similar to the cutter, a fastball pitch, but is more of a breaking ball than the cutter. The slider is also known as a yakker or a snapper. Slider continuum Depending on velocity, a pitch can fall anywhere on the continuum from \\"fastball\\" to \\"slider\\": * fastball ¬ª cut fastball ¬ª hard slider ¬ª slider ¬ª slurve ** cut fastball: slower than fastball ** hard slider: slower than fastball ** slider: slower than fastball The difference between a slider and curveball is that the curveball delivery includes a downward yank on the ball as it is released in addition to the lateral spin applied by the slider grip. The slider is released off the index finger, while the curveball is released off the middle finger. If the pitcher is snapping his wrist as he throws, and the movement is more downward than sideways, then he is probably throwing a curveball or slurve, and not a true \\"slider\\". It is important when throwing a slider, or any breaking pitch in baseball, not to come \\"around\\" the baseball. When the pitcher \\"comes around\\" the ball, the pitcher puts extra tension on his pitching arm to throw that pitch. A slider is thrown with a regular arm motion, just like a fastball. Slider movement is a direct result of the fingertip pressure and grip. The pitcher may visualize throwing his fingers at the catcher in order to improve follow through and finish the pitching motion. Standout sliders A Hall of Fame pitcher famous for his slider was lefty Steve Carlton. Right-handed pitcher David Cone was famous for his slider, which he was able to use many different ways, as was Bob Gibson of the Cardinals. To right-handed batters, Cone would throw it to hook sharply outside the strike zone, getting hitters to chase and miss it. He threw the pitch from various arm angles to further confuse the hitter. Cone's slider was also a strikeout pitch to left-handed hitters, throwing it to curve back over the outside corner and catch the hitter looking. Cone used the slider effectively during his perfect game on July 18, 1999‚Äîthe final out was recorded via a slider resembling a wiffle ball. In the first game of the 1988 World Series, Dennis Eckersley tried to strike out Kirk Gibson with a backdoor slider, but Gibson was sitting on that exact pitch and hit a game-winning home run. Joe Carter ended the 1993 World Series with a home run on a slider thrown by Mitch Williams. A remarkable slider was John Smoltz's, which would come in looking like a strike and then break out of the strike zone. Brad Lidge featured a slider in his perfect season as a closer in 2008, and used the pitch to strike out the final batter of the 2008 World Series for the Philadelphia Phillies. Closer Francisco Cordero also throws a slider. Other top pitchers to throw a slider included Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers, who used the pitch to win a Cy Young Award in 1981, and Seattle Mariners and Arizona Diamondbacks starter Randy Johnson, whose slider's lateral movement eventually spawned its own nickname, \\"Mr. Snappy\\". At times, Johnson's slider was faster than most pitchers' fastballs. Mike Jackson, who tied Paul Assenmacher with the most games pitched in the 1990s (644), also threw a slider. Ron Guidry threw a slider, which he was taught by Sparky Lyle. Armando Galarraga threw sliders 38.9% of the time in 2008, more than any other starting pitcher in the majors, and Ryan Dempster threw them 32.9% of the time, more than any other NL starting pitcher. In 2008 CC Sabathia had the most effective slider, among major league starting pitchers. Zack Greinke won the AL Cy Young award in 2009 in large part because of his slider, one of the better pitches in all of baseball. In 2011, Clayton Kershaw won the Pitching Triple Crown by allowing only a .117 average against his slider. History The innovator of the slider is debated, but some credit Chief Bender as the first to use the pitch. George Blaeholder was credited with using it with the St. Louis Browns in the 1920s, when the slider was known as a \\"nickel curve,\\"\\"WISCONSIN Magazine of History\\",Wisconsin Historical Society Press, Spring 2004 issue. Accessed July 8, 2007. and George Uhle and Harry O'Neill have also been given credit for developing the pitch. Bender used his slider to help him pitch a no-hitter and win 212 games in his career. Bender was the first pitcher to win six World Series games. More recently, New York Yankee pitcher Ron Guidry mastered the pitch to great effect in 1978 when he went 25‚Äì3 and won the Cy Young Award. It is also the name of the Cleveland Indians mascot who was recently inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame.

It was created in 1711 for Sir Thomas Willoughby, 2nd Baronet, who had previously represented Nottinghamshire and Newark in Parliament. The Willoughby Baronetcy, of Wollaton in the County of Nottingham, had been created in the Baronetage of England in 1677, for his elder brother Francis Willoughby, with special remainder to the latter's only brother Thomas, who succeeded him in 1688. Lord Middleton was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He sat as Member of Parliament for Nottinghamshire and Tamworth. On the death of his younger son, the fourth Baron (who had succeeded his elder brother), the line of the eldest son of the first Baron failed. He was succeeded by his cousin Henry Middleton, the fifth Baron. He was the son of the Hon. Thomas Willoughby (c. 1694‚Äì1742), second son of the first Baron. On the death of his son, the sixth Baron, this line of the family also failed. The late Baron was succeeded by his cousin Digby Willoughby, the seventh Baron. He was the son of a younger son of the aforementioned the Hon. Thomas Willoughby, second son of the first Baron. He was a captain in the Royal Navy. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his cousin, the eighth Baron. He was the grandson of Reverend the Hon. James Willoughby, younger son of the aforesaid the Hon. Thomas Willoughby, second son of the first Baron. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the ninth Baron, who in his turn was succeeded by his younger brother, the 10th Baron. On the latter's death the titles passed to his second but eldest surviving son, the 11th Baron. He was Lord Lieutenant of the East Riding of Yorkshire. Since 2011, the titles are held by his grandson, the 13th Baron. Extensive estate and personal papers of the Willoughby family are held in the Middleton collection at the department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham. The current family seat is Birdsall Hall, near Malton, North Yorkshire. The Middleton family owned Wollaton Hall, a stately home near Nottingham on which Mentmore Towers was based, and Middleton Hall in Warwickshire until they were sold by the 11th Baron in the 1920s.

Varieties of curveball include the 12‚Äì6 curveball and the knuckle curve. Its close relatives are the slider and the slurve. The \\"curve\\" of the ball varies from pitcher to pitcher. The expression \\"to throw a curveball\\" essentially translates to introducing a significant deviation to a preceding concept. Grip and action Grip of a curveball The curveball is gripped much like a cup or drinking glass is held. The pitcher places the middle finger on and parallel to one of the long seams, and the thumb just behind the seam on the opposite side of the ball such that if looking from the top down, the hand should form a \\"C shape\\" with the horseshoe pointing in towards the palm following the contour of the thumb. The index finger is placed alongside the middle finger, and the other two extraneous fingers are folded in towards the palm with the knuckle of the ring finger touching the leather. Occasionally some pitchers will flare out these two fingers straight and away from the ball to keep them clear of the throwing motion. The curveball and slider share nearly identical grips and throwing motion. The delivery of a curveball is entirely different from that of most other pitches. The pitcher at the top of the throwing arc will snap the arm and wrist in a downward motion. The ball first leaves contact with the thumb and tumbles over the index finger thus imparting the forward or \\"top-spin\\" characteristic of a curveball. The result is the exact opposite pitch of the four-seam fastball's backspin, but with all four seams rotating in the direction of the flight path with forward-spin, with the axis of rotation perpendicular to the intended flight path much like a reel-type mower or a bowling ball. The amount of break on the ball depends on how hard the pitcher can snap the throw off, or how much forward spin can be put on the ball. The harder the snap, the more the pitch will break. Curveballs primarily break downwards, but can also break toward the pitcher's off hand to varying degrees. Unlike the fastball, the apex of the ball's flight path arc does not necessarily need to occur at the pitcher's release point, and often peaks shortly afterwards. Curveballs are thrown with considerably less velocity than fastballs, because of both the unnatural delivery of the ball and the general rule that pitches thrown with less velocity will break more. A typical curveball in the major collegiate level and above will average between 65 and 80 mph, with the average MLB curve at 77 mph. From a hitter's perspective, the curveball will start in one location (usually high or at the top of the strike zone) and then dive rapidly as it approaches the plate. The most effective curveballs will start breaking at the apex of the arc of the ball flight, and continue to break more and more rapidly as they approach and cross through the strike zone. A curveball that a pitcher fails to put enough spin on will not break much and is colloquially called a \\"hanging curve\\". Hanging curves are usually disastrous for a pitcher because the low velocity, non-breaking pitch arrives high in the zone where hitters can wait on it and drive it for power. Diagram of the movement of a thrown curveball The curveball is a popular and effective pitch in professional baseball, but it is not particularly widespread in leagues with players younger than college level. This is with regard for the safety of the pitcher ‚Äì not because of its difficulty ‚Äì though the pitch is widely considered difficult to learn as it requires some degree of mastery and the ability to pinpoint the thrown ball's location. There is generally a greater chance of throwing wild pitches when throwing the curveball. When thrown correctly, it could have a break from seven to as much as 20 inches in comparison to the same pitcher's fastball. Safety Due to the unnatural motion required to throw it, the curveball is considered a more advanced pitch and poses inherent risk of injury to a pitcher's elbow and shoulder. There has been a controversy, as reported in The New York Times, March 12, 2012, about whether curveballs alone are responsible for injuries in young pitchers or whether it is the number of pitches thrown that are the predisposing factor. In theory, allowing time for the cartilage and tendons of the arm to fully develop would protect against injuries. While acquisition of proper form might be protective, Dr. James Andrews is quoted in the article as stating that in many children, insufficient neuromuscular control, lack of proper mechanics, and fatigue make maintenance of proper form unlikely. The parts of the arm most commonly injured by the curveball are the ligaments in the elbow, the biceps, and the forearm muscles. Major elbow injury requires repair through elbow ligament reconstruction, or Tommy John surgery. The \\"12‚Äì6 curveball\\" vs. the \\"Roundhouse Curveball\\" vs. the \\"Slurve\\" Curveballs have a variety of trajectories and breaks among pitchers. This chiefly has to do with the arm slot and release point of a given pitcher, which is in turn governed by how comfortable the pitcher is throwing the overhand curveball. Pitchers who can throw a curveball completely overhanded with the arm slot more or less vertical will have a curveball that will break straight downwards. This is called a 12‚Äì6 curveball as the break of the pitch is on a straight path downwards like the hands of a clock at 12 and 6. The axis of rotation of a 12‚Äì6 curve is parallel with the level ground and perpendicular to its flight path. Pitchers throwing their curveballs with the arm slot at an angle will throw a curveball that breaks down and toward the pitcher's off-hand. In the most extreme cases, the curve will break very wide laterally. Because the slider and the curveball share nearly the same grip and have the same unique throwing motions, this curveball breaks much like a slider, and is colloquially termed a \\"slurve\\". The axis of rotation on a slurve will still be more or less perpendicular to the flight path of the ball; the latter however will not be parallel to the ground. With some pitchers, the difference between curveball and other pitches such as slider and slurve may be difficult to detect or even describe. A less common term for this type of curveball is a 1‚Äì7 (outdrop,outcurve, dropping roundhouse) or 2‚Äì8 (sweeping roundhouse curveball). A curveball spinning on a vertical axis completely perpendicular to its flight path and thus with complete side spin that is either 3‚Äì9 for a right handed pitcher or 9‚Äì3 for a left handed pitcher is called a sweeping curveball, flat curveball, or frisbee curveball. The flat curveball will still drop because of gravity, but due to the lack of top spin the drop is only a small amount compared to the 12‚Äì6, 1‚Äì7/11‚Äì5, or 2‚Äì8/10‚Äì4 curveballs. Most often this side spin happens due to a pitcher having an arm angle that is either side arm or at a very low 3/4 arm angle. However, sometimes complete side spin happens for a pitcher who has a higher arm slot due to the person throwing the pitch with a twisting motion causing the fingers to move around the side of the ball instead of over the top of the ball. Using this twisting motion around the ball is said to cause injury to the arm near the elbow. A slider's spin axis is almost parallel to the ball's flight path similar to a football or bullet, but tilted slightly upwards pointing to 12 o'clock. When a slider's spin axis points to 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock, then the pitch becomes a slurve. This slurve tends to happen when a pitcher uses too much force on the curveball and less finesse. This happens because the pitcher may lazily pronate slightly at the release point instead of following through with complete supination at the end of the throw for the curve. At other times the slurve will happen due to the pitcher supinating a little too much at the release point when throwing a slider, which may be called a slurvy slider. A slurvy slider with the same velocity of a power slider (5-8mph slower than a fastball) may impart a greater break. Physics Generally the Magnus effect describes the laws of physics that make a curveball curve. A fastball travels through the air with backspin, which creates a higher pressure zone in the air ahead of and under the baseball. The baseball's raised seams augment the ball's ability to develop a boundary layer and therefore a greater differential of pressure between the upper and lower zones. The effect of gravity is partially counteracted as the ball rides on and into increased pressure. Thus the fastball falls less than a ball thrown without spin (neglecting knuckleball effects) during the 60 feet 6 inches it travels to home plate. On the other hand, a curveball, thrown with topspin, creates a higher pressure zone on top of the ball, which deflects the ball downward in flight. Instead of counteracting gravity, the curveball adds additional downward force, thereby giving the ball an exaggerated drop in flight. Real or illusion? There was once a debate on whether a curveball actually curves or is an optical illusion. In 1949, Ralph B. Lightfoot, an aeronautical engineer at Sikorsky Aircraft, used wind tunnel tests to prove that a curveball curves. On whether a curveball is caused by an illusion, Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Dizzy Dean has been quoted in a number of variations on this basic premise: \\"Stand behind a tree 60 feet away, and I will whomp you with an optical illusion!\\" However, optical illusion caused by the ball's spinning may play an important part in what makes curveballs difficult to hit. The curveball's trajectory is smooth, however the batter perceives a sudden, dramatic change in the ball's direction. When an object that is spinning and moving through space is viewed directly, the overall motion is interpreted correctly by the brain. However, as it enters the peripheral vision, the internal spinning motion distorts how the overall motion is perceived. A curveball's trajectory begins in the center of the batter's vision, but overlaps with peripheral vision as it approaches the plate, which may explain the suddenness of the break perceived by the batter. A peer-reviewed article on this hypothesis was published in 2010. Nicknames Popular nicknames for the curveball include \\"the bender\\" and \\"the hook\\" (both describing the trajectory of the pitch), as well as \\"the yakker\\" and \\"Uncle Charlie\\". New York Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden threw a curve so deadly that it was nicknamed \\"Lord Charles\\" and the great hitter Bill Madlock called it \\"the yellow hammer‚Äù - apparently because it came down like a hammer and was too yellow to get hit by a bat. Because catchers frequently use two fingers to signal for a curve, the pitch is also referred to as \\"the deuce\\" or \\"number two\\". History Baseball lore has it that the curveball was invented in the early 1870s by Candy Cummings (it is debatable). An early demonstration of the \\"skewball\\" or curveball occurred at the Capitoline Grounds in Brooklyn in August 1870 by Fred Goldsmith. In 1869, a reporter for the New York Clipper described Phonney Martin as an \\"extremely hard pitcher to hit for the ball never comes in a straight line‚Äö but in a tantalizing curve.\\" If the observation is true, this would pre-date Cummings and Goldsmith. In 1876, the first known collegiate baseball player to perfect the curveball was Clarence Emir Allen of Western Reserve College, now known as Case Western Reserve University, where he never lost a game. Both Allen, and teammate pitcher John P. Barden, became famous for employing the curve in the late 1870s. In the early 1880s, Clinton Scollard (1860‚Äì1932), a pitcher from Hamilton College in New York, became famous for his curve ball and later earned fame as a prolific American poet. In 1885, St. Nicholas, a children's magazine, featured a story entitled, \\"How Science Won the Game\\". It told of how a boy pitcher mastered the curveball to defeat the opposing batters. Records of the Princeton University (then the College of New Jersey) game from September 26, 1863 in the New York Clipper of the Nassaus facing the Athletics refer to F. P. Henry, Princeton Class of 1866, \\"slow pitching with a great twist to the ball achieved a victory over fast pitching.\\" By 1866, many Princeton players were pitching and hitting \\"curved balls\\". Harvard President Charles Eliot was among those opposed to the curve, claiming it was a dishonest practice that Harvard students should not want to partake in. At an athletics conference at Yale University in 1884 a speaker (thought to be from Harvard, likely Prof. Charles Eliot Norton, a cousin of the Harvard President ) was reported to have stated: \\"For the pitcher, instead of delivering the ball to the batter in an honest, straightforward way, that the latter may exert his strength to the best advantage in knocking it, now uses every effort to deceive him by curving‚ÄîI think that is the word‚Äîthe ball. And this is looked upon as the last triumph of athletic science and skill. I tell you it is time to call halt! when the boasted progress in athletics is in the direction of fraud and deceit.\\" In the past, major league pitchers Bob Feller, Virgil Trucks, Herb Score, Camilo Pascual and Sandy Koufax were regarded as having outstanding curveballs.

The name of the park comes from the Pleistocene megafauna fossils found there. Mammoths are believed to have been drawn to this location by a salt lick deposited around the sulfur springs. Other animals including forms of bison, caribou, deer, elk, horse, mastodon, moose, musk ox, peccary, sloth, and possibly tapir also grazed the vegetation and salty earth around the springs that the animals relied on for their diet. The area near the springs was very soft and marshy causing many animals to become stuck with no way to escape. It bills itself as \\"the birthplace of American paleontology\\", a term which dates from the 1807 expedition by William Clark undertaken at the direction of President Thomas Jefferson. In Nicholas Cresswell's journal, dated 1774 to 1777, he records a visit in 1775 to what was then called \\"Elephant Bone Lick.\\" In this account, Cresswell describes finding several bones of \\"prodigious size\\", as well as tusk fragments, and teeth‚Äîone weighing approximately 10 pounds.

Activities and amenities The visitors center (opened 2004) features indoor and outdoor exhibits of fossils, American art, and a 1,000 pound mastodon skull as well as a gift shop. The park features several nature trails, including a Discovery Trail that includes a boardwalk around a marsh bog diorama with recreations of a woolly mammoth, a mastodon, a ground sloth, bison, and scavengers feeding on carcasses and skeletal remains. The Discovery Trail winds through several habitats, including grassland, wetland and savanna, and is accessible to the physically challenged. A small bison herd is also maintained on-site. The park has picnicking facilities and a 62-site campground.

Daegaya was located in present-day Goryeong County, in North Gyeongsang Province of South Korea. (It should not be confused with Goryeong Gaya, which was located around present-day Sangju.) According to \\"Geographies\\" in the Samguk sagi, Daegaya existed for about 520 years from the first king, Ijinasi (Ïù¥ÏßÑÏïÑÏãúÏôï), to the last, Doseolji (ÎèÑÏÑ§ÏßÄÏôï). Daegaya had sixteen kings from King Ijinasi to King Doseolji, but only five of those are known. The first king was Ijinasi, the ninth king Inoe, the sixteenth king Doseolji, and King Haji, whose generation is uncertain. King Haji (ÌïòÏßÄ, Ëç∑Áü•) sent an embassy to Namje (ÂçóÈΩä, in Southern Qi) in 479. According to Chinese records, he received a rank of the third order, one rank below Baekje and Silla. Daegaya developed quickly and played a major role in the Gaya confederacy in the 5th century AD, partly because of its advanced steel-making craft, but its progress and that of the confederacy were limited by the neighboring kingdoms of Baekje and Silla, which were more fully developed as centralized political entities. Incidental historical records and archaeological findings indicate a highly stratified aristocratic society in Daegaya and the Gaya confederacy at this time. King Haji allied with Baekje and Silla to attack Goguryeo in 481. Daegaya allied with Baekje to attack Silla (which, for Baekje, was in response to Silla's breach of their 120-year truce) at the battle of Gwansan Fortress in 554, but both Baekje and Gaya suffered heavy losses. This confrontation policy alienated the other member states of the Gaya confederation, and Daegaya lost its leadership of Gaya to Ara Gaya. Daegaya fell to the armies of Silla under general Kim Isabu in 562; Silla, having already begun to absorb much of the Gaya confederacy, had invaded Daegaya as punishment for having allied with Baekje in 554. Etymology of the name the name daegaya is suspected to be first used around the late gaya confederacy. The name itself were also used by geumgwan gaya during the early days of gaya confederacy.

It is the first in a series of 15 (as of 2004) Mitchell and Markby Mysteries. Although they feel curiously attracted to each other, the two protagonists who solve the case, Mitchell and Markby, are not a team. Rather, they work against each other. Meredith Mitchell, aged 35 at the beginning of the series, is a British civil servant who, unmarried and without relatives to take care of, embarks on a career in the diplomatic service and, at the beginning of the novel, has spent many years abroad, most recently in Yugoslavia. On her arrival back home, she metamorphoses into an amateur sleuth. Chief Inspector Alan Markby is a 42-year-old divorced policeman working from the fictitious town of Bamford somewhere in the Cotswolds. The two meet when the police have to investigate a death in a small village near Bamford where Mitchell is staying. Granger is renowned for writing traditional detective fiction but also for bringing the classic whodunnit up to date. As opposed to, say, Miss Marple's St. Mary Mead, the village of Westerfield is a soulless place with a dwindling population, with all the young people leaving. There is no village shop; no village school; no doctor's practice; no vicarage, with the old church boarded up and only to be opened for special occasions. In spite of all that, the villagers are reluctant to accept, and suspicious of, any newcomers to their rural community. Plot summary Eve Owens, a British film star who is now in her mid-forties and who has settled down in the small village of Bamford, invites her cousin Meredith Mitchell to her daughter Sara's wedding, which is to take place in a couple of weeks' time in the old village church. But shortly after Mitchell's arrival one of Eve Owens's neighbours, a young artist called Philip Lorrimer, is found dead in his cottage‚Äîpoisoned. The autopsy reveals that it has been a slow death, that Lorrimer has been poisoned over a longer period of time. At first there are no suspects, especially as no one seems to have had a motive for killing Lorrimer. But when one night Lorrimer's 80-year-old neighbour Bert Yewell is slain in his pyjamas next to his garden shed, it becomes clear that Yewell must have known a secret which he was about to give away. In the end, it turns out that Eve Owens, her daughter, and one of the guests staying at Owens's house are not as innocent as they seemed at the beginning.

The changeup is the staple off-speed pitch, usually thrown to look like a fastball but arriving much more slowly to the plate. Its reduced speed coupled with its deceptive delivery is meant to confuse the batter's timing. It is meant to be thrown the same as a fastball, but farther back in the hand, which makes it release from the hand slower while still retaining the look of a fastball. A changeup is generally thrown to be 8‚Äì15 miles per hour slower than a fastball. If thrown correctly, the changeup will confuse the batter because the human eye cannot discern that the ball is coming significantly slower until it is around 30 feet from the plate.Walsh, John (September 19, 2007). \\"Pitch Identification Tutorial\\". The Hardball Times. Retrieved 2007-09-19. For example, a batter swings at the ball coming at him as if it were a 90 mph fastball, but instead the ball is coming in at 75 mph‚Äîthis means he will be swinging too early to hit the ball well. Other names include change-of-pace, change or off-speed pitch. Although that term can also be used simply to mean any pitch that is slower than a fastball. In addition, before at least the second half of the twentieth century, the term \\"slow ball\\" was used to denote pitches that were not a fastball or breaking ball, which almost always meant a type of changeup. Therefore, the terms slow ball and changeup could be used interchangeably. The changeup is analogous to the slower ball in cricket. Delivery The changeup is thrown with the same arm action as a fastball, but at a lower speed due to the pitcher holding the ball in a special grip. Former pitcher and pitching coach Leo Mazzone stated: > \\"When a pitcher throws his best fastball, he puts more in it; the changeup > is such that one throws something other than his best fastball. By having > this mindset, the pitch will have less velocity on it in addition to the > change in grips. This difference from what is expected by the arm action and > the velocity can confuse the batter into swinging the bat far too early and > thus receiving a strike, or not swinging at all. Should a batter be fooled > on the timing of the pitch and still make contact, it will cause a foul ball > or the ball being put into play weakly, usually resulting in an out. In > addition to the unexpectedly slow velocity, the changeup can possess a > significant amount of movement, which can bewilder the batter even further. > The very best changeups utilize both deception and movement.\\"Mazzone, Leo, > and Rosenthal, Jim (1999). Pitching Like a Pro: A Guide for Young Pitchers > and Their Coaches, Little League Through High School. St. Martin's Press. . Popularity Since the rise of Pedro Mart√≠nez, a Dominican pitcher whose changeup was one of the tools that led to his three Cy Young Awards, the changeup has become increasingly popular in the Dominican Republic.The Pitch of an Island, James Wagner Dominican pitchers including Edinson V√≥lquez, Michael Ynoa, and Ervin Santana are all known to have developed effective changeups in the Dominican Republic after Mart√≠nez's success with the pitch. Probably the most famous changeup thrower of the last 30 years, Atlanta Braves southpaw Tom Glavine utilized a two-seam changeup as his number one pitch on the way to winning two Cy Young Awards, a World Series MVP, and 305 wins in a celebrated Hall of Fame career. A Gripping Tale 13 July 1992. Sports Illustrated. Hall of Famer reliever Trevor Hoffman had one of the best changeups in his prime and used it to record 601 saves. In recent years, some of the game's best pitchers have relied heavily on the changeup. A 2013 article published by Sports Illustrated noted that Justin Verlander, F√©lix Hern√°ndez, Stephen Strasburg, David Price, and Max Scherzer have revolutionized the pitch and used it abundantly in their arsenal.How the changeup has changed the game Variations The grip used for a circle changeup. There are several variations of changeups, which are generated by using different grips on the ball during the pitch. The circle changeup is one well-known grip. The pitcher forms a circle with the index finger and thumb and lays the middle and index fingers across the seams of the ball. By pronating the wrist upon release, the pitcher can make the pitch break in the same direction as a screwball. More or less break will result from the pitcher's arm slot. Pedro Mart√≠nez used this pitch throughout his career to great effect, and many considered it to be his best pitch.James, Bill and Rob Neyer. The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers Simon and Schuster, 2004. Pg. 12. . The most common type is the straight changeup. The ball is held with three fingers (instead of the usual two) and closer to the palm, to kill some of the speed generated by the wrist and fingers. This pitch generally breaks downward slightly, though its motion does not differ greatly from a two-seam fastball. Other variations include the palmball, vulcan changeup and fosh. The split- finger fastball is used by many pitchers as a type of changeup.

It is believed to have been located around the modern-day city of Gimhae, Southern Gyeongsang province, near the mouth of the Nakdong River. Due to its geographic location, this kingdom played a dominant role in the regional affairs from the Byeonhan period onward to the end of the Gaya confederacy. According to the Samguk Yusa, Geumgwan Kaya was made of 9 villages united by King Suro of Gaya. His wife and queen Heo Hwang-ok, whom he married in 48 AD, is believed to be from an Ayuta kingdom.\\"The Relations Between Korea and India: Korean-Indian Relations in Ancient History.\\" http://www.korea.net/news/issue/attach/PDF%20Format_india_2.pdf, page 3 of 9. During this early time in the history of Gaya, several waves of migration from the north, including the earlier-extant Gojoseon, Buyeo, and the Goguryeo, arrived and integrated with existing populations and stimulated cultural and political developments. A sharp break in burial styles is found in archaeological sites dated near the late 3rd century AD, when these migrations are to have taken place. Burial forms associated with North Asian nomadic peoples, such as the burial of horses with the dead, suddenly replace earlier forms in the tombs of the elite. In addition, evidence exists indicating that earlier burials were systematically destroyed. In the early 1990s, a royal tomb complex was unearthed in Daeseong-dong, Gimhae, attributed to Geumgwan Gaya but apparently used since Byeonhan times.Cheol, S.K. (2000). Relations between Kaya and Wa in the third to fourth centuries AD. Journal of East Asian Archeology 2(3-4), 112-122. After Geumgwan Gaya capitulated to Silla in 532 AD, its royal house was accepted into the Sillan aristocracy (probably because by that time, a major house of Silla, of the Gyeongju Kim clan, was related to the Gaya royal house, which was Gimhae Kim clan) and given the rank of \\"true bone,\\" the second-highest level of the Silla bone rank system. General Kim Yu- shin of Silla (also of the Gimhae Kim clan) was a descendant of the last king of Gaya.

There are twelve towns in Luxembourg, as defined by statute. Despite the status as towns, they are not all contiguous urbanised areas. They are similar to communes, but have been given a separate legal status. There is a technical difference between the status of commune and towns, but this is limited in practicality. One difference is that √©chevins in towns are formally appointed by the Grand Duke, whereas √©chevins for other communes are appointed by the Minister for the Interior.  Terminology  The officially used terms for a town in the sense of this article are Stad (plural Stied) in Luxembourgish, Stadt (plural St√§dte) in German, and ville (plural villes) in French. All of these terms may be translated as either \\"town\\" or \\"city\\". However, apart from the capital, Luxembourg, most of the places have none of the qualities that would award them the status of a \\"city\\" according to English usage.  History  Historically, this status was derived from a town's possession of a town charter, but town rights are now granted and regulated by statute. In the modern era, the status was first conferred on 24 February 1843, when seven of the eight towns that had previously been granted charters were reinstated as towns (Clervaux was not). They were (in the order given in the law): Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Grevenmacher, Echternach, Wiltz, Vianden, and Remich. For over sixty years, no more towns have been added, but the vast demographic shift during the last part of the nineteenth century made it impossible to leave the arrangements unchanged. Thus, on 29 May 1906, Esch- sur-Alzette was promoted; Esch was followed by Differdange, Dudelange, Ettelbruck, and Rumelange on 4 August 1907. An area of the (now extinct) commune of Hollerich was conferred the title on 7 April 1914, under the title of 'Hollerich-Bonnevoie'; this status was lost when Hollerich was merged into Luxembourg City on 26 March 1920. The last such statute affecting town status in Luxembourg was the Loi communale du 13 d√©cembre 1988. In the order outlined in that legislation (i.e. alphabetical, except with Luxembourg City first), the twelve communes with town status are: Luxembourg City, Diekirch, Differdange, Dudelange, Echternach, Esch-sur-Alzette, Ettelbruck, Grevenmacher, Remich, Rumelange, Vianden, and Wiltz. In spite of their town status, some of the municipalities are very small and more like villages than towns. There are also municipalities without town status that have more inhabitants than some of the official towns (especially in the Luxembourg and Red Lands agglomerations, but also elsewhere, such as Mersch). Apart from the capital, Luxembourg, which is a city with now over 110,000 inhabitants, only the three or five next largest municipalities (Esch-sur-Alzette, Differdange, Dudelange, plus possibly Ettelbruck and Diekirch) have long been urbanised enough to be described as towns. However, most municipalities are now growing with the continuously high figures of immigration to Luxembourg. There is a town planning project that aims at developing Ettelbruck, Diekirch and four bordering municipalities into a new centre called Nordstad (\\"North Town\\") with an expected population of 30,000.

Aridisols (from the Latin aridus, for \\"dry\\", and solum) form in an arid or semi-arid climate. Aridisols dominate the deserts and xeric shrublands, which occupy about one third of the Earth's land surface. Aridisols have a very low concentration of organic matter, reflecting the paucity of vegetative production on these dry soils. Water deficiency is the major defining characteristic of Aridisols. Also required is sufficient age to exhibit subsoil weathering and development. Limited leaching in aridisols often results in one or more subsurface soil horizons in which suspended or dissolved minerals have been deposited: silicate clays, sodium, calcium carbonate, gypsum or soluble salts. These subsoil horizons can also be cemented by carbonates, gypsum or silica. Accumulation of salts on the surface can result in salinization.

Earl Cathcart is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. History The title was created in 1814 for the soldier and diplomat William Cathcart, 1st Viscount Cathcart. The Cathcart family descends from Sir Alan Cathcart, who sometime between 1447 and 1460 was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord Cathcart. He later served as Warden of the West Marches and Master of the Artillery. His great-great-grandson, the third Lord, was killed at the Battle of Pinkie in 1547 (his father Alan Cathcart, Master of Cathcart, was one of many Scottish noblemen killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513). He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Lord. He fought at the Battle of Langside in 1568 and was Master of the Household to King James VI. His great-great- great-grandson, the eighth Lord, was a soldier. He was a major-general in the army and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1734 to 1740. In 1740 Lord Cathcart was appointed commander-in-chief of the British Forces in America. However, he died on the passage out and was buried on Dominica. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Lord. He was a lieutenant- general in the army and also served as British Ambassador to Russia. Between 1752 and 1776 Lord Cathcart sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer. His son, the tenth Lord, was a noted military commander and diplomat. He was a general in the army and like his father served as British Ambassador to Russia. From 1788 to 1843 Lord Cathcart was a Scottish Representative Peer in the House of Lords. In 1807 he was created Baron Greenock, of Greenock in the County of Renfrew, and Viscount Cathcart, of Cathcart in the County of Renfrew, and in 1814 he was made Earl Cathcart. These titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the second Earl. Like his father he was a general in the army and also served as Governor General of Canada from 1846 to 1847. On his death the titles passed to his second but eldest surviving son, the third Earl. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire and President of the Royal Agricultural Society. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, was also a Deputy Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. His son, the sixth Earl, was a major-general in the army and served as a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords from 1976 to 1989. The titles are held by the latter's only son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 1999. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits on the Conservative benches. Lord Cathcart lost his seat in 1999 but was able to return in 2007 in a by-election caused by the death of Lord Mowbray. He is also chief of Clan Cathcart. Several other members of the family may also be mentioned. The Hon. Sir George Cathcart, fourth son of the first Earl, was a general in the army. The Hon. Charles Cathcart, younger son of the ninth Lord, was a colonel in the British Army and represented Clackmannanshire in the House of Commons. The Hon. Louisa Cathcart, daughter of the ninth Lord, married David Murray, 7th Viscount of Stormont. In 1793, on the death of her and Lord Stormont's uncle William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield and Mansfield, Louisa inherited (under a special remainder in the letters patent) the earldom of Mansfield created in 1776, and became the second Countess of Mansfield, while her husband inherited the earldom of Mansfield created in 1792, and became the second Earl of Mansfield (see the Earl of Mansfield and Mansfield for later history of these titles).

The Navy Cross is awarded primarily to a member of the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard (when operating as a part of the Department of the Navy) for extraordinary heroism.SECNAVYINST 2006, 1650.1H, P. 2--22&23 The medal is equivalent to the Army's Distinguished Service Cross, the Air Force Air Force Cross, and the Coast Guard Cross. The Navy Cross is bestowed by the Secretary of the Navy and may also be awarded to members of the other armed services, and to foreign military personnel while serving with the U.S. naval services. The Navy Cross was established by Act of Congress (Public Law 65-253) and approved on February 4, 1919. History The Navy Cross was instituted in part due to the entrance of the United States into World War I. Many European nations had the custom of decorating heroes from other nations, but the Medal of Honor was the sole U.S. award for valor at the time. The Army instituted the Distinguished Service Cross and Distinguished Service Medal in 1918, while the Navy followed suit in 1919, retroactive to 6 April 1917. Originally, the Navy Cross was lower in precedence than the Medal of Honor and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, because it was awarded for both combat heroism and for \\"other distinguished service\\". Congress revised this on 7 August 1942, making the Navy Cross a combat-only decoration that follows the Medal of Honor in order of precedence. Since the medal was established, it has been awarded more than 6,300 times. It was designed by James Earle Fraser. Since the 11 September attacks the Navy Cross has been awarded 47 times, with two of them having the name of the recipient held in secret. One of those secret awardings was due to actions during the 2012 Benghazi attack. Criteria The Navy Cross may be awarded to any member of the U.S. Armed Forces while serving with the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard (when a part of the Department of the Navy) who distinguishes himself in action by extraordinary heroism not justifying an award of the Medal of Honor. The action must take place under one of three circumstances: # In combat action while engaged against an enemy of the United States; or, # In combat action while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force; or, # In combat action while serving with friendly foreign forces, who are engaged in armed conflict in which the United States is not a belligerent party. The act(s) to be commended must be performed in the presence of great danger, or at great personal risk, and must be performed in such a manner as to render the individual's action(s) highly conspicuous among others of equal grade, rate, experience, or position of responsibility. An accumulation of minor acts of heroism does not justify an award of the Navy Cross. As originally authorized, the Navy Cross could be awarded for distinguished non-combat acts, but legislation of 7 August 1942 limited the award to acts of combat heroism. Wear The Navy Cross originally was the Navy's third-highest decoration, after the Medal of Honor and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. On 7 August 1942, Congress revised the order of precedence, placing the Navy Cross above the Distinguished Service Medal in precedence. Since that time, the Navy Cross has been worn after the Medal of Honor and before all other awards. Additional awards of the Navy Cross are denoted by gold or silver inch stars affixed to the suspension and service ribbon of the medal. A gold star would be issued for each of the second through fifth awards, to be replaced by a silver star which would indicate a sixth award. To date no one has received more than five awards. Description and symbolism USS Intrepid: AtM2/c Jonell Copeland; StM Que Gant; StM Harold Clark, Jr.; StM James Dockery; StM Alonzo Swann; and StM Eli Benjamin, were awarded the Navy Cross for being the only gun crew who would fire one of their aircraft carrier's anti-aircraft guns into a kamikaze dive bomber as it was diving towards the carrier's flight deck and their battle station(s) during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944 ; Medal The earliest version of the Navy Cross (1919‚Äì1928) featured a more narrow strip of white, while the so-called \\"Black Widow\\" medals awarded from 1941 to 1942 were notable for the dark color due to over-anodized finish. The medal is similar in appearance to the British Distinguished Service Cross. Obverse: The medal is a modified cross patt√©e one and a half inches wide. The ends of its arms are rounded whereas a conventional cross pat√©e has arms that are straight on the end. There are four laurel leaves with berries in each of the re-entrant arms of the cross. In the center of the cross a sailing vessel is depicted on waves, sailing to the viewer's left. The vessel is a symbolic caravel of the type used between 1480 and 1500. Fraser selected the caravel because it was a symbol often used by the Naval Academy and because it represented both naval service and the tradition of the sea. The laurel leaves with berries refer to achievement. Reverse: In the center of the medal, a bronze cross patt√©e, one and a half inches wide, are crossed anchors from the pre-1850 period, with cables attached. The letters USN are evident amid the anchors. ; Service Ribbon The service ribbon is navy blue with a center stripe of white identical to the suspension ribbon of the medal. The blue alludes to naval service; the white represents the purity of selflessness.

From its inception, the band's line-up included songwriters Rory Macdonald and Calum Macdonald. The line-up during most of the 1980s and 1990s (the band's most successful period) also included Donnie Munro, Malcolm Jones, Iain Bayne, and Pete Wishart. Munro left the band in 1997 to pursue a career in politics and was replaced by Bruce Guthro. Wishart left in 2001 and was replaced by Brian Hurren. The band released fourteen studio albums, with a number of their songs sung in Scottish Gaelic. Initially formed as a three- piece dance band known as 'The Run Rig Dance Band', the band played several low key events, and has previously cited a ceilidh at Kelvin Hall, Glasgow as their first concert. Runrig's music is often described as a blend of folk and rock music, with the band's lyrics often focusing upon locations, history, politics, and people that are unique to Scotland. Songs also make references to agriculture, land conservation and religion. Since 1999, the band has gained attention in Canada, following Nova Scotian singer Bruce Guthro's entry to the band. In 2016, the band announced that it would retire from studio recording after the release of its 14th studio album, The Story and announced their final tour The Last Mile in 2017. On 17 and 18 August 2018, Runrig performed the final shows of their farewell tour, entitled The Last Dance, in Stirling City Park beneath the castle ramparts. An estimated 52,000 fans attended The Last Dance.  History = Formation and early years (1973‚Äì1987)  The band was formed in 1973 with brothers Calum and Rory Macdonald and their friend Blair Douglas. Donnie Munro joined the following year and they started to expand outside their native Isle of Skye. Douglas left the band in late 1974 and was replaced by Robert Macdonald. This line-up continued until 1978, when Douglas re-joined and Malcolm Jones became guitarist, both displacing Robert Macdonald. In the same year, Runrig's first album, entitled Play Gaelic, was released. All the songs were in Gaelic. It was re-released in 1990 as Play Gaelic, the first legendary recording. In 1979, Blair Douglas left Runrig again to pursue a solo career. 1979 also saw the release of Runrig's second album, The Highland Connection on the band's own label, Ridge Records. A somewhat transitional album, it features wailing electric guitars and ballads. The album also included the original version of \\"Loch Lomond\\". A later version was to become their signature song and closing song at concerts. The third Runrig album, Recovery (released in 1981), was a thematic record dealing with the rise and politics of Scotland's Gaelic community. 1980 saw the arrival of drummer Iain Bayne (from Scottish folk/rock band New Celeste) and keyboard player Richard Cherns. In 1982, Runrig re- recorded \\"Loch Lomond\\" as their first single. They signed to a small label called Simple Records in 1984, and two singles were released. The first was \\"Dance Called America\\". A longer version of the second single \\"Skye\\" appeared on the Alba Records compilation A Feast Of Scottish Folk Music, Volume One along with an early version of \\"Lifeline\\", both of which were previously unreleased on albums, and \\"Na h-Uain a's t-Earrach\\" which was the B-side to \\"Dance Called America\\". The band then engaged the services of producer Chris Harley who brought to their recordings the benefit of his experience as a solo artist and a singer with The Alan Parsons Project and Camel. Runrig's fourth independent studio album, 'Heartland' (released in 1985), combined Gaelic sounds with anthemic rock music. Richard Cherns left the band in February 1986 and was replaced by ex-Big Country member Pete Wishart.  Major label and mainstream success (1987‚Äì1997)  The period from 1987 to 1997 marked Runrig's most successful run, during which they achieved placings in both the UK albums and singles charts, and toured extensively. With (for the first time) major-label support (from Chrysalis), Runrig's fifth studio album, The Cutter and the Clan (1987), which had originally been released on the independent Ridge Records label before being re-released on Chrysalis, brought the band wider audiences in the United Kingdom, as well as in other parts of Europe. From 1987 to 1995, Runrig released a total of five studio albums through Chrysalis Records. Along with The Cutter and the Clan, the other four albums were: Searchlight (1989), The Big Wheel (1991), Amazing Things (1993), and Mara (1995). On 22 June 1991, the band attracted around 50,000 people to an outdoor concert held in Balloch Country Park, near Loch Lomond. This was the largest number of people to attend a Runrig concert. Following the release of Mara, lead singer Donnie Munro grew more involved in politics. In 1997, he left Runrig to stand for a seat in the House of Commons for the Labour Party. However, he was not elected. Runrig began searching for a new frontman, and in 1998 they announced their selection of Bruce Guthro, a singer-songwriter from Nova Scotia.  Transitional challenges (1997 to 2001)  Runrig's tenth album, In Search Of Angels (1999), was released amidst some uncertainty about the band's future. Since their contract with Chrysalis had ended, Runrig chose to release In Search Of Angels on their own label, Ridge Records. As a result, the record received much less promotion than the previous five, and sales were considerably smaller. Runrig was also faced with the challenge of acclimatising their fans to a new lead vocalist. The band toured extensively in support of the record, and in 2000, they also released a live album called Live at Celtic Connections 2000, allowing fans to hear older Runrig songs sung by their new frontman. The year 2000 concluded with the release of an authorised songbook, Flower of the West ‚Äì The Runrig Songbook. The book included lyrics, sheet music, photographs, and background information for 115 of Runrig's songs ‚Äì nearly every album track and single from the band's first ten studio albums. Renewed popularity (2001‚Äì2009) Having established that they could continue without Donnie Munro, Runrig set to work on their eleventh studio album. Among their independently-released studio albums, The Stamping Ground (2001) was Runrig's most successful. Moreover, critics who had given mixed reviews to In Search Of Angels, praised The Stamping Ground as the quintessential Runrig album. The band continued to enjoy support in the UK, Germany, and Denmark. However, with a Canadian frontman, Runrig began finding new fans in Canada and the United States. In 2001, Pete Wishart, the band's keyboard player, left after being elected Member of Parliament for the constituency of Tayside North for the Scottish National Party. In the 2005 election he was again elected, this time for the new constituency of Perth and North Perthshire and again for the SNP. Brian Hurren stepped in to take Wishart's place in the band. Wishart has been re-elected in each subsequent general election, albeit with a very slim majority in 2017. The 2001 album The Stamping Ground was seen very much as a return to form after the lacklustre In Search Of Angels (1999), but 2003's Proterra divided opinion. In August 2003, Runrig played their 30th Anniversary concert on the esplanade at Stirling Castle, celebrating 30 years since the band's formation, and including visitors from previous line-ups, as well as guest artists including the Glasgow Islay Choir and Paul Mounsey. Runrig played their first U.S. concert, a benefit for the charity \\"Glasgow the Caring City\\", on 4 April 2006 at the Nokia Theatre in New York City. Founding member Blair Douglas joined the band onstage, playing accordion on several numbers. In the audience were fans from as far away as Texas, Alabama, Florida, Colorado, Minnesota, Norwich (England) and Scotland. While the bulk of their 2007 tour was scheduled for Denmark, Germany, and England, an outdoor show, titled \\"Beat The Drum\\", was held at Loch Ness on 18 August 2007. It was staged at Borlum Farm, Drumnadrochit and attended by 18,500 people in heavy rain. Because of the unusually large number of support acts, it had been likened to an all-day music festival, Runrig being the headline act. This was the first in what was to become a staple for Runrig ‚Äì annually staging big outdoor shows in Scotland in summer. Runrig re- recorded \\"Loch Lomond (Hampden Remix)\\" to raise funds for the BBC's annual Children in Need appeal. This was released on 12 November [2007] and includes the 'Tartan Army' (Scotland's Hampden Football Supporters), including Rod Stewart, on backing vocals. It reached No. 9 in the UK Singles Chart. \\"Loch Lomond (Hampden Remix)\\" was named \\"The Best Scottish Song Of All Time\\" in November 2008. The band were presented the award by Lulu. On 5 December 2008, during the penultimate tour date at The Barrowlands, Glasgow, the band was inducted into the Scottish Traditional Music Hall Of Fame, by the Scottish Traditional Music Awards Director. On 29 August 2009, Runrig performed at Scone Palace for their third annual outdoor summer show (the second being at Edinburgh Castle in 2008). They were supported by acts such as the Peatbog Faeries, piper Fred Morrison, King Creosote, Kathleen Macinnes, and Blair Douglas (a former member of the group) and his band. Attendance numbered ~15,000. The show was part of Scotland's Year of Homecoming 2009. To underline this, First Minister Alex Salmond made an appearance on stage (introduced by his SNP colleague and former band member Pete Wishart), and launched an initiative called 'SconeStone.' This aims to promote Scotland as a kind and compassionate nation through the \\"journey of kindness\\" made by the SconeStone across the world. Its keepers, each holding it for a week before passing it on, are expected to undertake a good deed. Its first keeper was the Reverend Neil Galbraith, who was presented with the stone on the same day.  Health concerns (2009‚Äì2010)  In March 2009, guitarist Malcolm Jones suffered a heart attack in Edinburgh whilst running to catch a train. This forced the band to cancel a sizable tour of Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and Germany. After undergoing minor surgery, he took to the stage with Runrig again in May of the same year. During a routine check up with his doctors in June 2009, he was strongly advised to have heart bypass surgery, which forced the band to cancel a tour of Denmark. The operation was a success and, although the band was forced to cancel their show at the 35th T√∏nder Festival in T√∏nder, Denmark, Malcolm returned to the stage in late August 2009, at the band's big outdoor Scottish Homecoming show for 2009 at Scone Palace, Perthshire, Scotland. However, on 28 February 2010, just a week prior to an extensive German tour, it was announced that Malcolm would have to have yet another operation which in turn forced the band to cancel/postpone their Spring dates in Germany, due to start on 3 March 2010. In a statement released by the band on their official website they noted that Malcolm's health was \\"good\\" and that the problem was \\"purely a technical one\\". They also emphatically stated that \\"All other concerts planned for 2010 will go ahead.\\" It was announced that the winter tour scheduled for winter 2010 would be the last tour for a year with the band planning no concerts in 2011 so that they can focus on other projects. The final date for 2010 was in the Barrowland Ballroom, Glasgow which is traditionally where the band finishes their Scottish tours. In a statement released by the office, they promised it to be \\"quite a party\\". On 1 November 2010, the band released a four-disc compilation, entitled 50 Great Songs. The release includes both studio and live performances, focusing primarily upon Bruce Guthro's time within the band.  Year off and Rewired (2011‚Äì2012)  After the end of the 2010 tour the band collectively made the decision to take a year off. Calum and Rory had been concentrating on a long gestating project outside of Runrig. The duo call themselves The Band from Rockall and released their debut album outside of Runrig at the end of April 2012. Keyboardist Brian Hurren also released his debut solo album, which he wrote, performed and produced himself, under the name A Hundred Thousand Welcomes, the inspiration for the name coming from Bruce Guthro shouting the Gaelic equivalent of the phrase during \\"Beat the Drum\\" at Loch Ness. Guthro released another solo album, while drummer Iain Bayne was appointed manager of English folk-rock band Coast. The band re-united as a six-piece again in the summer of 2012 for the Rewired Tour, with the big Scottish outdoor show held in August at the Northern Meeting Park in Inverness.  40th anniversary (2013‚Äì2014)  In November 2012, ahead of their planned Rewired Tour, the band announced a special 40th Anniversary Concert at the Black Isle Show Ground in Muir of Ord, near Inverness. The 40th Anniversary show was a weekend of live entertainment featuring 'special guests', entitled \\"Party on the Moor\\". Shortly after that they announced another \\"special\\" concert at Edinburgh Castle in July, entitled \\"Celebration in the City\\". On 28 April 2013 (to mark Runrig's first ever concert 40 years earlier) Runrig released their first single in 5 years entitled \\"And We'll Sing\\". At Party on the Moor former members Donnie Munro and Pete Wishart performed onstage alongside the current lineup and Blair Douglas made an appearance via a short video highlighting the changes in the band's lineup since 1973. This was the first time Munro had performed with Runrig since 1997, and for many it was a powerful statement seeing Guthro and Munro singing together as there had been heated debates about who should be the band's frontman, and who was the better frontman among many fans and critics. The gig was hailed as a success by fans and critics many calling it one of the best concerts Runrig have ever staged. Bassist, Rory Macdonald said that \\"in many ways, it was the perfect Runrig gig\\" whilst drummer, Iain Bayne called it \\"the culmination of a lifetime's work\\". In late 2013 it was announced that Runrig would embark on a Spring 2014 tour of England to continue the 40th Anniversary celebrations. Entitled \\"Party on the Tour\\" it would \\"draw inspiration\\" from the Party on the Moor show. Alongside the English dates, several European music festivals were announced for 2014. In December 2013 it was officially confirmed that Party on the Moor would be released on DVD. In January further details for the DVD were released. On 31 March 2014 Runrig released the full, uncut concert on both DVD, CD and, for the first time ever for Runrig, Blu-ray. The Story (2014‚Äì2017) The band announced in issue 74 of The Wire magazine and on their official Twitter feed that they had begun work on their 14th studio album. It was also announced (informally) that to accommodate for the time it takes to write, record and produce an album they would not be playing any further live shows in 2014 after the T√∏nder Festival, due to be held on 28 and 29 August 2014. In the summer 2015 issue of The Wire it was revealed that the album would be called The Story, and would be released in spring 2016. On 12 November 2015 the title track, and lead single, received its first radio play on BBC Radio nan G√†idheal. During an interview with the show's host Derek Murray, Calum Macdonald said that the upcoming album would likely be the last studio album that the band would release, also confirming the album's release date as 29 January 2016. On 13 November 2015, the single was released in both CD and digital download form accompanied by a music video. Shortly after the single was released, the band announced that along with a sizeable tour of the UK and Europe in 2016 they would both be headlining the 21st HebCelt Festival on the Isle of Lewis and staging an outdoor show at Edinburgh Castle in July 2016. The Last Dance and disbandment (2017‚Äì2018) Runrig on stage during The Last Dance in Stirling On 26 September 2017 Runrig announced that after 45 years they would be \\"pulling the curtain down\\" on their music careers. The band announced one final tour named The Final Mile, taking part in Germany, Denmark and UK, ending with one final show in Stirling's City Park called The Last Dance. Tickets for The Last Dance sold out in minutes and, after a few days of behind the scenes planning, Runrig announced another concert in the same location the night before. Tickets for this night sold out in less than six hours.

A ricochet ( ; ) is a rebound, bounce, or skip off a surface, particularly in the case of a projectile. Most ricochets are caused by accident and while the force of the deflection decelerates the projectile, it can still be energetic and almost as dangerous as before the deflection. The possibility of ricochet is one of the reasons for the common firearms safety rule \\"Never shoot at a flat, hard surface.\\" Ricochets can occur with any caliber, and short or round ricocheting bullets may not produce the audible whine caused by tumbling irregular shapes. Ricochets are a hazard of shooting because, for as long as they retain sufficient velocity, ricocheting bullets or bullet fragments may cause collateral damage to animals, objects, or even the person who fired the shot. Variables Ricochets occur when a bullet or bullet fragment is deflected by an object rather than penetrating and becoming embedded in that object. Ricochet behavior may vary with bullet shape, bullet material, spin, velocity (and distance), target material and the angle of incidence.Bullet Ricochet: A Comprehensive Review , Burke, TW, Rowe, WF, Journal of Forensic Sciences, September 1, 1992 Velocity High-velocity rifle cartridges have higher probability of bullet penetration, because increased energy released by an identical bullet may fracture or temporarily melt the target at the point of impact. Alternatively, the same energy release may melt and/or disintegrate the bullet to reduce size and range of deflected particles. Ricochets are more likely with handgun cartridges and low velocity rifle cartridges such as .22 Long Rifle. Buckshot and shotgun slugs have similarly high ricochet probability, but ricochet range of smaller shot is lower than intact rifle or handgun bullet ricochets. Bullet Sectional density, or mass of the bullet divided by the frontal area of the bullet, increases penetration of resistant surfaces. Elongated, spin-stabilized bullets fired from rifled firearms have greater sectional density than spherical bullets of the same diameter made from the same material; and elongated rifle cartridge bullets have greater sectional density than short bullets of the same diameter handgun cartridges. Bullet velocity is reduced by as much as 35% by each ricochet deflection, and velocity is further reduced by air resistance as cohesive bullet fragments often produce an audible whine tumbling after losing stability. Target material Comparative hardness and density determine the results of collisions with bullets. Bullets tend to penetrate low density materials like air with little deflection, although friction causes rotated projectiles to drift in the direction of rifling twist as the bullet falls through the atmosphere under the influence of gravity. Ricochets may be similarly deflected in the direction of rotation of the side of a spin- stabilized bullet contacting a resistant surface. Dense objects tend to prevail in collisions with less dense objects; so dense bullets tend to penetrate less dense materials, and dense materials tend to deflect light bullets. Resistance to penetration can be evaluated as the sectional density of the target material along the axis of bullet movement in front of the bullet. Metallic foil will be more easily penetrated than metal ingots, and sectional density of sheet metal increases as orientation of the sheet diverges from perpendicular to, toward parallel with, the bullet path. Bullets are more likely to ricochet off flat, hard surfaces such as concrete, rock or steel, but a ricochet can occur from irregular surfaces within heterogeneous materials including soil and vegetation. Uniformly soft, flexible materials like sand have a lower incidence of ricochet. Though it may not be intuitive, bullets easily ricochet off water;Haag, L.C., \\"Bullet Ricochet from Water,\\" AFTE Journal, Vol. 11, No. 3, July 1979, pp. 27-34.Nennstiel, R., \\"Study of Bullet Ricochet on a Water Surface,\\" AFTE Journal, Vol. 16, No. 3, July 1984, pp. 88-93. compare stone skipping. Angle The angle of departure, both vertically and horizontally, is difficult to calculate or predict due to the many variables involved, not the least of which is the deformation of the bullet caused by its impact with the surface it strikes.Jauhari, M., \\"Approximate Relationship Between the Angles of Incident and Ricochet for Practical Application in the Field of Forensic Science,\\" Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology and Police Science, Vol. 62, 1970, pp. 122-125. Probability of ricochet is highest from surfaces approximately parallel to the axis of bullet movement, and grazing ricochets typically depart the surface at a smaller angle than the angle of incidence (or approach). Probability of bullet penetration increases as the axis of bullet movement becomes perpendicular to the target surface; but penetration may create a depression or crater within which the bullet may ricochet more than once, possibly following the arc of the crater floor to depart the crater at a greater angle from the original surface than the angle of incidence. In an extreme case, a strong, cohesive bullet striking a nearly perpendicular elastic surface may ricochet directly back at the shooter.\\"A case of ‚Äúboomerang‚Äù bullet ricochet\\", International Journal of Legal Medicine, October 1, 2001 This situation is sometimes observed when hardened armor-piercing bullet cores fail to completely penetrate steel plate. The United States Army noted increased ricochet range after adopting the M855A1 green bullet with a larger steel core than the M855 bullet it replaced. Buckshot and subsonic bullets may be similarly reflected from rubber vehicle tires. Consequences abrasions and asymmetrical jacket damage were caused when this recovered bullet ricocheted from a hard, granular surface. Not all ricochets are accidental. Some bullets are fired to intentionally ricochet, just as in ricochets of some ball games like basketball and pool. Bullet traps at indoor shooting ranges often include durable steel plates to deflect bullets downward into a material intended to stop and capture the bullets. Cannonballs were often fired to strike the ground or water in front of their target in anticipation of ricochets which would keep the projectile at an effective distance above the ground or water surface through massed troops or ships. The behavior of iron cannonballs documented during the era of muzzle-loading cannon may be a useful approximation for a BB gun or steel pellets fired from a shotgun, but inelastic collisions between the various shapes and materials of high-velocity bullets and the objects they may strike make bullet ricochets less predictable than the intuitive symmetry of low-velocity game spheres. The problem with unintentional ricochets is potential damage caused to objects outside the intended path of the bullet. A responsible shooter anticipates potential bullet interactions within a cone of space around the aim point. The shooter is at the apex of the cone, and the cone is symmetrical around the intended bullet path. The angle of that cone may initially be defined by the accuracy of the firearm and the skill of the shooter; but any ricochet potential within the cone becomes the apex of a ricochet cone with a broader angle. The ground surface is a frequent source of ricochets. A bullet may be deflected more than once before it comes to rest. Damage potential of ricochets, like bullets, is proportional to the mass of the bullet fragment and the square of its velocity. Ricochet velocity is always lower than collision velocity, but may be close to collision velocity for small angles of deflection. Ricochet mass may be similarly close to original bullet mass for full metal jacket bullets or green bullets replacing soft lead with solid copper or a steel core. Frangible bullets or lead core varmint hunting bullets are more susceptible to collision damage, and produce smaller ricochet fragments. Lower initial mass gives small fragment ricochets less damage potential, and distance of travel is reduced by more rapid loss of velocity from air resistance. Reduced ricochet range is one of the reasons the newer .17 HMR round with its frangible bullet has gained popularity against the older non-fragmenting .22 WMR. Ricochets can be lethal. A notable death caused by ricochet was the hostage Katrina Dawson during the Lindt cafe siege in December 2014, killed by a ricochet from a police bullet when tactical officers stormed the building.

An inspection might also be referred to as a Fagan inspection after Michael Fagan, the creator of a very popular software inspection process. Introduction An inspection is one of the most common sorts of review practices found in software projects. The goal of the inspection is to identify defects. Commonly inspected work products include software requirements specifications and test plans. In an inspection, a work product is selected for review and a team is gathered for an inspection meeting to review the work product. A moderator is chosen to moderate the meeting. Each inspector prepares for the meeting by reading the work product and noting each defect. In an inspection, a defect is any part of the work product that will keep an inspector from approving it. For example, if the team is inspecting a software requirements specification, each defect will be text in the document which an inspector disagrees with. Inspection process The inspection process was developedIBM Technical Report RC 21457 Log 96856 April 26, 1999. in the mid-1970s and it has later been extended and modified. The process should have entry criteria that determine if the inspection process is ready to begin. This prevents unfinished work products from entering the inspection process. The entry criteria might be a checklist including items such as \\"The document has been spell-checked\\". The stages in the inspections process are: Planning, Overview meeting, Preparation, Inspection meeting, Rework and Follow-up. The Preparation, Inspection meeting and Rework stages might be iterated. * Planning: The inspection is planned by the moderator. * Overview meeting: The author describes the background of the work product. * Preparation: Each inspector examines the work product to identify possible defects. * Inspection meeting: During this meeting the reader reads through the work product, part by part and the inspectors point out the defects for every part. * Rework: The author makes changes to the work product according to the action plans from the inspection meeting. * Follow-up: The changes by the author are checked to make sure everything is correct. The process is ended by the moderator when it satisfies some predefined exit criteria. The term inspection refers to one of the most important elements of the entire process that surrounds the execution and successful completion of a software engineering project. Inspection roles During an inspection the following roles are used. * Author: The person who created the work product being inspected. * Moderator: This is the leader of the inspection. The moderator plans the inspection and coordinates it. * Reader: The person reading through the documents, one item at a time. The other inspectors then point out defects. * Recorder/Scribe: The person that documents the defects that are found during the inspection. * Inspector: The person that examines the work product to identify possible defects. Related inspection types=Code review A code review can be done as a special kind of inspection in which the team examines a sample of code and fixes any defects in it. In a code review, a defect is a block of code which does not properly implement its requirements, which does not function as the programmer intended, or which is not incorrect but could be improved (for example, it could be made more readable or its performance could be improved). In addition to helping teams find and fix bugs, code reviews are useful both for cross-training programmers on the code being reviewed and for helping junior developers learn new programming techniques. Peer reviews Peer reviews are considered an industry best-practice for detecting software defects early and learning about software artifacts. Peer Reviews are composed of software walkthroughs and software inspections and are integral to software product engineering activities. A collection of coordinated knowledge, skills, and behaviors facilitates the best possible practice of Peer Reviews. The elements of Peer Reviews include the structured review process, standard of excellence product checklists, defined roles of participants, and the forms and reports. Software inspections are the most rigorous form of Peer Reviews and fully utilize these elements in detecting defects. Software walkthroughs draw selectively upon the elements in assisting the producer to obtain the deepest understanding of an artifact and reaching a consensus among participants. Measured results reveal that Peer Reviews produce an attractive return on investment obtained through accelerated learning and early defect detection. For best results, Peer Reviews are rolled out within an organization through a defined program of preparing a policy and procedure, training practitioners and managers, defining measurements and populating a database structure, and sustaining the roll out infrastructure.

Maintenance check of electronic equipment on a U.S. Navy aircraft. An inspection is, most generally, an organized examination or formal evaluation exercise. In engineering activities inspection involves the measurements, tests, and gauges applied to certain characteristics in regard to an object or activity. The results are usually compared to specified requirements and standards for determining whether the item or activity is in line with these targets, often with a Standard Inspection Procedure in place to ensure consistent checking. Inspections are usually non-destructive. Inspections may be a visual inspection or involve sensing technologies such as ultrasonic testing, accomplished with a direct physical presence or remotely such as a remote visual inspection, and manually or automatically such as an automated optical inspection. Non-contact optical measurement and Photogrammetry have become common NDT methods for inspection of manufactured components and design optimisation. A 2007 Scottish Government review of scrutiny of public services (the Crear Review, 2007Crerar, Professor Lorne D, September 2007 The Crerar Review: The report of the independent review of regulation, audit, inspection and complaints handling of public services in Scotland.) defined inspection of public services as \\"... periodic, targeted scrutiny of specific services, to check whether they are meeting national and local performance standards, legislative and professional requirements, and the needs of service users.\\" A surprise inspection tends to have different results than an announced inspection. Leaders wanting to know how others in their organization perform can drop in without warning, to see directly what happens. If an inspection is made known in advance, it can give people a chance to cover up or to fix mistakes. This could lead to distorted and inaccurate findings. A surprise inspection, therefore, gives inspectors a better picture of the typical state of the inspected object or process than an announced inspection. It also enhances external confidence in the inspection process. See section 4.12 of the Crear report. Specific inspection= Manufacturing  Inspection and measurement of the thickness of the different layers of an electronic chip using THz and X-ray radiation. THz has the privilege of being non-ionizing (non-destructive) but the resolution of X-ray is higher. Quality related in-process inspection/verification is an essential part of quality control in manufacturing. characteristics of a product or process and comparing the results with specified requirements to determine whether is the requirements are met for each characteristic.AS9100 Revision C, Clause 7.6 Control of Monitoring and Measurement Equipment Common examples of inspection by measurement or gauging include using a caliper or micrometer to determine if a dimension of a manufactured part is within the dimensional tolerance specified in a drawing for that part, and is thus acceptable for use. Design for Inspection (DFI) is a concept that should complement and work in collaboration with Design for Manufacturability (DFM) and Design for Assembly (DMA) to reduce product manufacturing cost and increase manufacturing practicality. Photogrammetry is a modern way of visual inspection, delivering high accuracy and traceability for various industries. The portable 3D system is a versatile optical coordinate measuring machine (CMM) with a wide range of capabilities. Highly accurate point measurements can be taken with inspection carried out directly to CAD models, geometry or drawings.(DFI) Fire Equipment Most fire equipment needs to be inspected to make sure in the event of a fire, every effort has been taken to make sure it doesn't get out of control. Extinguishers are to be inspected every month by law and inspected by a servicing company at least once a year. Fire extinguishers can be heavy, so it's a good idea to practice picking up and holding an extinguisher to get an idea of the weight and feel. Business In international trade several destination countries require pre-shipment inspection. The importer instructs the shipper which inspection company should be used. The inspector makes pictures and a report to certify that the goods that are being shipped and produced are in accordance with the accompanying documents. Commodity inspection is other term that is used between buyers and sellers. The scope of work for commodity inspection depends to the buyers. Some buyers hire the inspection agencies only for pre-shipment inspections i.e. visual quality, quantity, packing, marking and loading inspections and some others request for higher level inspections and ask inspection agencies to attend in the vendor shops and inspect commodities during manufacturing processes. Normally inspection is done based on an agreed inspection and test plan (ITP). Government In government and politics, an inspection is the act of a monitoring authority administering an official review of various criteria (such as documents, facilities, records, and any other assets) that are deemed by the authority to be related to the inspection. Inspections are used for the purpose of determining if a body is complying with regulations. The inspector examines the criteria and talks with involved individuals. A report and evaluation follows such visits. The Food Safety Inspection Service is charged with ensuring that all meat and egg products in the United States are safe to consume and accurately labeled. The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to order meat inspections and condemn any found unfit for human consumption. The United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission is a regulatory body that inspects for weapons of mass destruction. The Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care regulates and inspects care services in Scotland. An Oregon Air National Guardsman makes an inspection of a radio-tower Road vehicles A vehicle inspection, e.g., an annual inspection, is a necessary inspection required on vehicles to conform with laws regarding safety, emissions, or both. It consists of an examination of a vehicle's components, usually done by a certified mechanic. Vehicles pass a pre-warranty inspection, if, and only if, a mechanic provide evidence for the proper working condition of the vehicle systems specified in the type of inspection. Engineering, mechanics A mechanical inspection is usually undertaken to ensure the safety or reliability of structures or machinery. In Europe bodies involved in engineering inspection may be assessed by accreditation bodies according to ISO 17020 \\"General criteria for the operation of various types of bodies performing inspection\\". This standard defines inspection as \\"examination of a product, process, service, or installation or their design and determination of its conformity with specific requirements or, on the basis of professional judgment, with general requirements\\".BS EN ISO/IEC 17020: \\"Conformity assessment - Requirements for the operation of various types of bodies performing inspection\\", pp. 1 (2012) Non-destructive examination (NDE) or nondestructive testing (NDT) is a family of technologies used during inspection to analyze materials, components and products for either inherent defects (such as fractures or cracks), or service induced defects (damage from use). Some common methods are visual, industrial computed tomography scanning, microscopy, dye penetrant inspection, magnetic- particle inspection, X-ray or radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing, eddy- current testing, acoustic emission testing, and thermographic inspection. In addition, many non-destructive inspections can be performed by a precision scale, or when in motion, a checkweigher. Stereo microscopes are often used for examining small products like circuit boards for product defects. Inspection and technical assistance during turnarounds helps to decrease costly downtime as well as ensures restart of operations quickly and safely. Medical A medical inspection is the thorough and unhurried visualization of a patient, this requires the use of the naked eye. Military An examination vessel is a craft used to inspect ships entering or leaving a port during wartime. Railroad The railroad's inspection locomotive were special types of steam locomotives designed to carry railroad officials on inspection tours of the railroad property. Real estate A property condition assessment is the examination for purposes of evaluating a commercial or business property's condition often as a part of a due diligence investigation for a company to know what it is buying. Building code officials do a building inspection to determine code compliance in new or altered buildings before issuing a certificate of occupancy. Residential inspections not for code compliance are called a home inspection. There are numerous types of more specific real estate and infrastructure inspections such as windstorm inspection, energy audit, and pipeline video inspection.

The setting was also used for a PC game (Emperor of the Fading Suns), a live action role-playing game (Passion Play), and for a space combat miniature game (Noble Armada). History After the computer game Machiavelli the Prince, Holistic Design decided to do something new - a space strategy computer game, which would eventually become Emperor of the Fading Suns (1996). Holistic brought on two experienced world designers, Andrew Greenberg and Bill Bridges, to create a cohesive and interesting universe for the game, which would also be used as the basis for a tabletop role-playing game to be released simultaneously. Greenberg and Bridges had helped define the style of White Wolf Publishing's World of Darkness and, according to Shannon Appelcline, people noticed this game's similarity to the \\"White Wolf style\\". Appelcline comments further: \\"Fading Suns is unique mainly for its distinctive setting. It is a hard science-fiction game, but much of the universe has fallen back to Medieval technology: noble houses, guilds and a monolithic church control most of the power in the universe. Many people compare the universe to that of Frank Herbert's Dune, though Bridges points to Gene Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun, Isaac Asimov's Foundation and others as his inspiration.\\"Over the next few years Fading Suns was supported extensively with supplements and for a time the line did well. Holistic released the table-top miniatures game Noble Armada (1998) ‚Äì co-designed by Ken Lightner and Chris Wiese ‚Äì a spaceship combat game compatible with Fading Suns. Passion Play (1999) was a LARP for Fading Suns. Holistic printed a d20 version of Fading Suns (2001), and then dual-statted later Fading Suns supplements to use both d20 and their own \\"Victory Point System\\". Over the next few years Holistic announced a third edition of Fading Suns as well as new games called variously Diaspora, Dystopia, Inc, and Sathranet, which would have been designed using d20 Modern and would have looked into different periods in Fading Suns' history. However, none of these products were released. In 2007 Holistic Design licensed Fading Suns to RedBrick, and in 2012 the license passed to FASA Games, Inc, which released a revised edition of Fading Suns later that year. In 2014 FASA Games announced they would be releasing a new version of Noble Armada. In 2016 Holistic Design licensed the publishing rights for Fading Suns to Ulisses Spiele, who announced they were planning a new edition, with products published in both English and German. FASA Games retained the license for Noble Armada products and miniatures.  Game setting  The action is set in the Known Worlds, a future medieval-analogue empire built on the remains of a previous, more sophisticated human space-faring civilization made possible by ancient \\"jumpgates\\". The jumpgates are relics left by the mysterious Anunnaki, an ancient civilization (or civilizations) which seem to have influenced the evolution of lesser species, such as humans, for their own end, and waged a devastating war many millennia ago using them as tools and weapons. The atmosphere is strongly reminiscent of Frank Herbert's Dune and of the Hyperion stories by Dan Simmons, but is influenced by many other science fiction and horror books and movies as well, including the Cthulhu Mythos. The Known Worlds are a very superstitious and dangerous place. Power is administered by five major Noble Houses, five major guilds within the Merchants League, and six major sects of the Universal Church of the Celestial Sun. While most role-playing situations arise from the strict codes regulating the everyday life of the empire's citizens, the Imperial Age is rife with opportunities for adventure. Following the fall of the old regime, and centuries of darkness and warfare, most worlds have slipped backward to a technology level not much more advanced than 21st century Earth, and a number of alien threats lurk in the shadows. Pushing at the borders of the Known Worlds lurk the mutangenic horror of the Symbiots, the ancient and enigmatic Vau, and the barbarian empires of the Kurgan and the Vuldrok, all waiting for their chance to throw humanity into darkness and chaos. Players can take the role of either a member of a Noble House, of one the various merchant guilds, or a member of one of the numerous religious sects. A number of alien species, most notably the human-like 'psychic' Ukar and Obun, and the six-limbed, bestial Vorox, are also available as player characters. Two separate types of occult abilities exist within the game universe: psychic powers and Theurgy. Psychic powers manifest, generally, from the practitioners' own mental abilities. Psionicists, castigated as 'demon worshippers' and heretics, are often hunted down and killed by the Church, or enrolled in the Church's ranks (after a good bit of 're-training'). Theurgy is a kind of ordained divine sorcery practiced by the Church through various approved rites and is capable of producing miracles, often by calling on the assistance of various saints and angels. A large library of supplements provides descriptions of locales (planets, space stations, whole sections of space), alien societies, minor houses, guilds and sects, monsters and secret conspiracies, thus expanding the thematic possibilities offered by the setting.  Game system  The Fading Suns engine uses a simple attribute and skill, level and classless, single d20-powered system, called the Victory Point System (VPS). The second edition of the game's rules solved many issues raised by the earlier rule book, while increasing the amount of data available. The current Revised Edition further updated and streamlined the VPS mechanics. While generally stereotypical in their template-like form, characters are easily personalized through either life path or points-buy systems. In 2000, an adaptation of the setting to the popular 3rd edition OGL system was also published - D20 Fading Suns. For several years, supplements carried rules for both systems. Holistic Design has released a LARP version of Fading Suns entitled Passion Play. A fourth edition of Fading Suns is in development, helmed by original writer Bill Bridges.  Authors  Fading Suns was written by Andrew Greenberg and Bill Bridges, known for their involvement with the original Vampire: The Masquerade and Werewolf: The Apocalypse role- playing games both published by White Wolf Publishing.

It is a biology-based interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach (holism instead of the more traditional reductionism) to biological research. When it is crossing the field of systems theory and the applied mathematics methods, it develops into the sub-branch of complex systems biology. Particularly from year 2000 onwards, the concept has been used widely in biology in a variety of contexts. The Human Genome Project is an example of applied systems thinking in biology which has led to new, collaborative ways of working on problems in the biological field of genetics. One of the aims of systems biology is to model and discover emergent properties, properties of cells, tissues and organisms functioning as a system whose theoretical description is only possible using techniques of systems biology. These typically involve metabolic networks or cell signaling networks.  Overview  Systems biology can be considered from a number of different aspects. As a field of study, particularly, the study of the interactions between the components of biological systems, and how these interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system (for example, the enzymes and metabolites in a metabolic pathway or the heart beats). As a paradigm, systems biology is usually defined in antithesis to the so-called reductionist paradigm (biological organisation), although it's fully consistent with the scientific method. The distinction between the two paradigms is referred to in these quotations: \\"The reductionist approach has successfully identified most of the components and many of the interactions but, unfortunately, offers no convincing concepts or methods to understand how system properties emerge ... the pluralism of causes and effects in biological networks is better addressed by observing, through quantitative measures, multiple components simultaneously and by rigorous data integration with mathematical models.\\" (Sauer et al.) \\"Systems biology ... is about putting together rather than taking apart, integration rather than reduction. It requires that we develop ways of thinking about integration that are as rigorous as our reductionist programmes, but different. ... It means changing our philosophy, in the full sense of the term.\\" (Denis Noble) As a series of operational protocols used for performing research, namely a cycle composed of theory, analytic or computational modelling to propose specific testable hypotheses about a biological system, experimental validation, and then using the newly acquired quantitative description of cells or cell processes to refine the computational model or theory. Since the objective is a model of the interactions in a system, the experimental techniques that most suit systems biology are those that are system-wide and attempt to be as complete as possible. Therefore, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and high- throughput techniques are used to collect quantitative data for the construction and validation of models. As the application of dynamical systems theory to molecular biology. Indeed, the focus on the dynamics of the studied systems is the main conceptual difference between systems biology and bioinformatics. As a socioscientific phenomenon defined by the strategy of pursuing integration of complex data about the interactions in biological systems from diverse experimental sources using interdisciplinary tools and personnel. This variety of viewpoints is illustrative of the fact that systems biology refers to a cluster of peripherally overlapping concepts rather than a single well-delineated field. However, the term has widespread currency and popularity as of 2007, with chairs and institutes of systems biology proliferating worldwide.  History  Systems biology finds its roots in the quantitative modeling of enzyme kinetics, a discipline that flourished between 1900 and 1970, the mathematical modeling of population dynamics, the simulations developed to study neurophysiology, control theory and cybernetics, and synergetics. One of the theorists who can be seen as one of the precursors of systems biology is Ludwig von Bertalanffy with his general systems theory. One of the first numerical simulations in cell biology was published in 1952 by the British neurophysiologists and Nobel prize winners Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Andrew Fielding Huxley, who constructed a mathematical model that explained the action potential propagating along the axon of a neuronal cell. Their model described a cellular function emerging from the interaction between two different molecular components, a potassium and a sodium channel, and can therefore be seen as the beginning of computational systems biology. Also in 1952, Alan Turing published The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, describing how non-uniformity could arise in an initially homogeneous biological system. In 1960, Denis Noble developed the first computer model of the heart pacemaker. The formal study of systems biology, as a distinct discipline, was launched by systems theorist Mihajlo Mesarovic in 1966 with an international symposium at the Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio, titled \\"Systems Theory and Biology\\". The 1960s and 1970s saw the development of several approaches to study complex molecular systems, such as the metabolic control analysis and the biochemical systems theory. The successes of molecular biology throughout the 1980s, coupled with a skepticism toward theoretical biology, that then promised more than it achieved, caused the quantitative modeling of biological processes to become a somewhat minor field. Shows trends in systems biology research by presenting the number of articles out of the top 30 cited systems biology papers during that time which include a specific topic However, the birth of functional genomics in the 1990s meant that large quantities of high-quality data became available, while the computing power exploded, making more realistic models possible. In 1992, then 1994, serial articles B. J. Zeng, \\"On the holographic model of human body\\", 1st National Conference of Comparative Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine and West Medicine, Medicine and Philosophy, April 1992 (\\"systems medicine and pharmacology\\" termed).Zeng (B.) J., On the concept of system biological engineering, Communication on Transgenic Animals, No. 6, June, 1994.B. J. Zeng, \\"Transgenic animal expression system ‚Äì transgenic egg plan (goldegg plan)\\", Communication on Transgenic Animal, Vol.1, No.11, 1994 (on the concept of system genetics and term coined).B.

Zeng, \\"The structure theory of self-organization systems\\", Communication on Transgenic Animals, No.8-10, 1996. Etc. on systems medicine, systems genetics, and systems biological engineering by B. J. Zeng was published in China and was giving a lecture on biosystems theory and systems-approach research at the First International Conference on Transgenic Animals, Beijing, 1996. In 1997, the group of Masaru Tomita published the first quantitative model of the metabolism of a whole (hypothetical) cell. Around the year 2000, after Institutes of Systems Biology were established in Seattle and Tokyo, systems biology emerged as a movement in its own right, spurred on by the completion of various genome projects, the large increase in data from the omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics) and the accompanying advances in high-throughput experiments and bioinformatics. Shortly afterwards, the first departments wholly devoted to systems biology were founded (for example, the Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School ). In 2003, work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was begun on CytoSolve, a method to model the whole cell by dynamically integrating multiple molecular pathway models. Since then, various research institutes dedicated to systems biology have been developed. For example, the NIGMS of NIH established a project grant that is currently supporting over ten systems biology centers in the United States. As of summer 2006, due to a shortage of people in systems biology several doctoral training programs in systems biology have been established in many parts of the world. In that same year, the National Science Foundation (NSF) put forward a grand challenge for systems biology in the 21st century to build a mathematical model of the whole cell. In 2012 the first whole-cell model of Mycoplasma genitalium was achieved by the Karr Laboratory at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. The whole-cell model is able to predict viability of M. genitalium cells in response to genetic mutations. An important milestone in the development of systems biology has become the international project Physiome.  Associated disciplines  Overview of signal transduction pathways According to the interpretation of Systems Biology as the ability to obtain, integrate and analyze complex data sets from multiple experimental sources using interdisciplinary tools, some typical technology platforms are phenomics, organismal variation in phenotype as it changes during its life span; genomics, organismal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence, including intra- organismal cell specific variation. (i.e., telomere length variation); epigenomics/epigenetics, organismal and corresponding cell specific transcriptomic regulating factors not empirically coded in the genomic sequence. (i.e., DNA methylation, Histone acetylation and deacetylation, etc.); transcriptomics, organismal, tissue or whole cell gene expression measurements by DNA microarrays or serial analysis of gene expression; interferomics, organismal, tissue, or cell-level transcript correcting factors (i.e., RNA interference), proteomics, organismal, tissue, or cell level measurements of proteins and peptides via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry or multi-dimensional protein identification techniques (advanced HPLC systems coupled with mass spectrometry). Sub disciplines include phosphoproteomics, glycoproteomics and other methods to detect chemically modified proteins; metabolomics, measurements of small molecules known as metabolites in the system at the organismal, cell, or tissue level; glycomics, organismal, tissue, or cell-level measurements of carbohydrates; lipidomics, organismal, tissue, or cell level measurements of lipids. In addition to the identification and quantification of the above given molecules further techniques analyze the dynamics and interactions within a cell.The interactions studied include organismal, tissue, cell, and molecular interactions within the cell (interactomics). Currently, the authoritative molecular discipline in this field of study is protein-protein interactions (PPI), although the working definition does not preclude inclusion of other molecular disciplines. These molecular disciplines include; neuroelectrodynamics, an organismal network where the brain's computing function as a dynamic system includes underlying biophysical mechanisms and emerging computation by electrical interactions; fluxomics, measurements of molecular dynamic changes over time in a system such as a cell, tissue, or organism; biomics, systems analysis of the biome; and molecular biokinematics, the study of \\"biology in motion\\" focused on how cells transit between steady states such as in proteins molecular mechanism. In approaching a systems biology problem there are two main approaches. These are the top down and bottom up approach. The top down approach takes as much of the system into account as possible and relies largely on experimental results. The RNA-seq technique is an example of an experimental top down approach. Conversely, the bottom up approach is used to create detailed models while also incorporating experimental data. An example of the bottom up approach is the use of circuit models to describe a simple gene network. Various technologies utilized to capture dynamic changes in mRNA, proteins, and post-translational modifications. Mechanobiology, forces and physical properties at all scales, their interplay with other regulatory mechanisms; biosemiotics, analysis of the system of sign relations of an organism or other biosystems; Physiomics, a systematic study of physiome in biology. Cancer systems biology is an example of the systems biology approach, which can be distinguished by the specific object of study (tumorigenesis and treatment of cancer). It works with the specific data (patient samples, high-throughput data with particular attention to characterizing cancer genome in patient tumour samples) and tools (immortalized cancer cell lines, mouse models of tumorigenesis, xenograft models, high-throughput sequencing methods, siRNA-based gene knocking down high-throughput screenings, computational modeling of the consequences of somatic mutations and genome instability). The long-term objective of the systems biology of cancer is ability to better diagnose cancer, classify it and better predict the outcome of a suggested treatment, which is a basis for personalized cancer medicine and virtual cancer patient in more distant prospective. Significant efforts in computational systems biology of cancer have been made in creating realistic multi-scale in silico models of various tumours. The investigations are frequently combined with large-scale perturbation methods, including gene-based (RNAi, mis-expression of wild type and mutant genes) and chemical approaches using small molecule libraries. Robots and automated sensors enable such large-scale experimentation and data acquisition. These technologies are still emerging and many face problems that the larger the quantity of data produced, the lower the quality. A wide variety of quantitative scientists (computational biologists, statisticians, mathematicians, computer scientists and physicists) are working to improve the quality of these approaches and to create, refine, and retest the models to accurately reflect observations. The systems biology approach often involves the development of mechanistic models, such as the reconstruction of dynamic systems from the quantitative properties of their elementary building blocks. For instance, a cellular network can be modelled mathematically using methods coming from chemical kinetics and control theory. Due to the large number of parameters, variables and constraints in cellular networks, numerical and computational techniques are often used (e.g., flux balance analysis).  Bioinformatics and data analysis  Other aspects of computer science, informatics, and statistics are also used in systems biology. These include new forms of computational models, such as the use of process calculi to model biological processes (notable approaches include stochastic œÄ-calculus, BioAmbients, Beta Binders, BioPEPA, and Brane calculus) and constraint-based modeling; integration of information from the literature, using techniques of information extraction and text mining; development of online databases and repositories for sharing data and models, approaches to database integration and software interoperability via loose coupling of software, websites and databases, or commercial suits; network-based approaches for analyzing high dimensional genomic data sets. For example, weighted correlation network analysis is often used for identifying clusters (referred to as modules), modeling the relationship between clusters, calculating fuzzy measures of cluster (module) membership, identifying intramodular hubs, and for studying cluster preservation in other data sets; pathway-based methods for omics data analysis, e.g. approaches to identify and score pathways with differential activity of their gene, protein, or metabolite members. Much of the analysis of genomic data sets also include identifying correlations. Additionally, as much of the information comes from different fields, the development of syntactically and semantically sound ways of representing biological models is needed.  Creating biological models  A simple three protein negative feedback loop modeled with mass action kinetic differential equations. Each protein interaction is described by a Michealis Menten reaction. Researchers begin by choosing a biological pathway and diagramming all of the protein interactions. After determining all of the interactions of the proteins, mass action kinetics is utilized to describe the speed of the reactions in the system. Mass action kinetics will provide differential equations to model the biological system as a mathematical model in which experiments can determine the parameter values to use in the differential equations. These parameter values will be the reaction rates of each proteins interaction in the system. This model determines the behavior of certain proteins in biological systems and bring new insight to the specific activities of individual proteins. Sometimes it is not possible to gather all reaction rates of a system. Unknown reaction rates are determined by simulating the model of known parameters and target behavior which provides possible parameter values. Plot of Concentrations vs time for the simple three protein negative feedback loop. All parameters are set to either 0 or 1 for initial conditions. The reaction is allowed to proceed until it hits equilibrium. This plot is of the change in each protein over time.

British musicologist Jim Samson described ≈†tolcer-Slavenski as \\"undoubtedly one of a very small handful of truly major composers from South East Europe in the first half of the twentieth century\\". Life and career Josip ≈†tolcer-Slavenski was born in ƒåakovec in 1896. His father gave him his first instruction in music, then in 1913 he entered the Budapest Conservatory where his teachers included Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, Albert Sikl√≥s, and B√©la Bart√≥k. His studies were interrupted in 1916 by army service and at the end of the war he returned to his father's bakery business in ƒåakovec. In 1921 he went to study in Nov√°k's masterclasses at the Prague Conservatory. While in Prague, he joined the International Society for Contemporary Music. Having completed his studies in 1923 he returned to Croatia and taught for a year at the music school of the Zagreb Music Academy. In 1924 he moved to Belgrade, where he stayed for the rest of his life (except for a period in 1925‚Äì6 spent in Paris); he taught first at the Stankoviƒá School of Music, then at the music school of the Belgrade Academy (1937‚Äì45), becoming in 1945 professor of composition at the latter. Slavenski first attracted attention when in 1920 his orchestral Notturno op.1 was performed in Zagreb; in 1924 his First String Quartet was performed with success at the Donaueschingen Festival. Kleiber conducted his symphony Balkanophonia, first in Berlin in 1927 and then in various musical centres in Europe and the USA. Slavenski thus became the first Yugoslav composer of the 20th century to make an international reputation. At home, however, after the first success in 1920, he had to face the hostility of the then conservative Belgrade public and critics. After 1938 he composed very little; his works were seldom performed between 1940 and 1956 and he was almost forgotten. He died in Belgrade in 1955. It was only after his death that his stature was recognized. Work Initially Slavenski developed as an autodidact. The rich folk music of his native region, Medjimurje in north-western Croatia, left a decisive impact on him, and his youthful fascination with the sounds of church bells and the intricate combinations of their upper partials greatly contributed towards the formation of his harmonic idiom. His early compositions, dating from the time of his Budapest studies, show a blend of spontaneity with a strong desire for experiment. Polytonality and bold dissonances occurred in his piano pieces as early as 1913, at a time when many southern Slav composers were still treating material borrowed from folk tradition in a predominantly Romantic way. Such interests brought him close to the music of Kod√°ly and Bart√≥k, and his academic studies deepened the mastery of counterpoint, which remained a vital ingredient of his style. He continued to experiment with new ideas throughout the 1920s: the Sonata for violin and organ contains sonorities which foreshadow electronic music, and the Piano Sonata uses aleatory technique. Slavenski's interest in folk music broadened in the late 1920s to encompass that of the whole of the Balkans, and the culminating result of this was his Balkanophonia. He was equally attracted by the mystical and ritual aspects of music, as may be seen from Chaos, a movement from the unfinished Heliophonia, and Religiophonia, the latter generally considered to be his masterpiece. During the 1920s and 30s he was one of the very few Yugoslav composers who showed an awareness of the searching spirit of the avant garde abroad. His imaginative use of percussion instruments may occasionally recall Var√®se, whose works he did not know. He had no predecessors in Yugoslav music and no followers in his lifetime. When after his death his music became better known, it was already too late for it to exercise a direct influence on Yugoslav composers, though his creative use of folk music and his experiments of the 1920s provided a necessary impulse.

He is an \\"Honoured Man of the Aktubinsk region\\". Military career After graduation from pilot school, Lonchakov served as a second crew commander, crew commander, squadron senior pilot, and aviation brigade commander in the Russian Navy. Lonchakov has logged over 1400 hours of flight time, is a Class 1 Air Force pilot, and a paratroop training instructor with 526 jumps. Cosmonaut career Lonchakov is pictured translating through the passageway between the mid deck and flight deck of Space Shuttle Endeavour. Lonchakov was selected as a test-cosmonaut candidate of the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center Cosmonaut Office in December 1997. In July 2004 he took part in the training for survival in extreme situations at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.  STS-100  Lonchakov's first spaceflight was the Space Shuttle mission STS-100 that installed the International Space Station's robotic arm, Canadarm2. Other major objectives for mission were to berth the Raffaello logistics module to the station, activate it, transfer cargo between Raffaello and the station, and reberth Raffaello in the shuttle's payload bay. Space Shuttle Endeavour lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center at 18:40:42 UTC on 19 April 2001. Lonchakov served as a mission specialist. After nearly two days of flight, Endeavour docked with the ISS on 21 April 2001 at 13:59 UTC. After 8 days of docked operations, the shuttle undocked from the ISS at 17:34 UTC on 19 April. Landing was originally planned at KSC however continuing cloud cover, rain showers and gusty winds forced Endeavour to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The mission duration of STS-100 was 11 days, 21 hours, 31 minutes, 14 seconds.  Soyuz TMA-1/TM-34  On 25 March 2002, Lonchakov passed training for a spaceflight as the backup crew commander of the Soyuz-TM, Soyuz-TMA spacecraft, 4th visiting crew under the ISS program. On 1 October 2002, he was selected for the prime crew as flight engineer-2 and remained the backup crew commander. Lonchakov returned to the ISS in October 2002 as a crewmember of the Soyuz taxi flight Soyuz TMA-1. The Soyuz spacecraft carrying commander Lonchakov, flight engineer cosmonaut Sergei Zalyotin and ESA astronaut Frank De Winne lifted off from the Baikonour Cosmodrome on 30 October 2002, at 03:11 UTC. Thick fog on the ground obscured the launch from the cameras, which showed only a silhouette of the rocket and the flame exhaust. The successful docking between the Soyuz TMA-1 and the ISS did take place at 05:01 UTC on 1 November 2002. After spending 10 days, 20 hours and 53 minutes in space Lonchakov returned to Earth on Soyuz TM-34. The Soyuz TM-34 spacecraft, undocked from the nadir port of the Zarya module of the ISS on 9 November at 20:44 GMT and landed 100 km north east of Arkalyk on 10 November 2002 at 00:04 UTC. Soyuz TM-34 was the last of the Soyuz-TM spacecraft and was replaced by the Soyuz-TMA. Expedition 18 Yury Lonchakov, Expedition 18 flight engineer, in the Zarya module of the ISS. Lonchakov was originally selected to be a Flight Engineer on Expedition 19, but was transferred to the Expedition 18 crew as a Flight Engineer and Soyuz Commander, after Salizhan Sharipov was removed from the crew. The Soyuz TMA-13 spacecraft with Lonchakov, Expedition 18 commander Michael Fincke and space tourist Richard Garriott launched on 12 October 2008 at 7:01 UTC. Lonchakov served as the Soyuz commander. After a two-day autonomous flight, Soyuz TMA-13 successfully docked to the Earth-facing docking port of the Zarya module of the ISS on 14 October at 08:26 GMT, seven minutes ahead of schedule. Lonchakov joined the ISS Expedition 18 crew as a flight engineer. While Richard Garriott was aboard, Lonchakov participated during his personal time (along with Michael Fincke, Gregory Chamitoff and Richard Garriott) in filming and starring in a science-fiction movie made in space, Apogee of Fear. On 12 March 2009, a piece of debris from the upper stage of a Delta II rocket used to launch a GPS satellite in 1993, passed close to the ISS. The Expedition 18 crew prepared to evacuate the ISS by closing hatches between modules, and boarding the Soyuz spacecraft that was docked to provide emergency crew escape. The debris did not hit the space station and safely passed by at 16:38 UTC, and the crew were cleared to resume operations about five minutes later. Lonchakov returned to Earth with NASA astronaut Michael Fincke and spaceflight participant Charles Simonyi. The Soyuz TMA-13 capsule landed in Kazakhstan on 8 April 2009, at 7:16 UTC.  Spacewalks  Yuri Lonchakov participates in a spacewalk on 23 December 2008. Yuri Lonchakov participates in a spacewalk on 10 March 2009. Lonchakov has performed two career spacewalks totalling 10 hours and 27 minutes. On 23 December 2008, Lonchakov performed his first career spacewalk with NASA astronaut Michael Fincke. They installed an electromagnetic energy measuring device, (Langmuir probe) on Pirs, removed the Russian Biorisk long-duration experiment, installed the Exposing Specimens of Organic and Biological Materials to Open Space (Expose-R) experiment package on Zvezda, but subsequently removed it after it failed to activate and transmit telemetry on ground command. The two spacewalkers also installed the Impulse experiment which measures disturbances in the ionosphere around the space station. The EVA was conducted from Pirs airlock in Russian Orlan space suits. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 38 minutes. On 10 March 2009, Lonchakov performed his second career spacewalk, again with Fincke. The two spacewalkers installed the EXPOSE-R experiment onto the universal science platform of the Zvezda module, removed tape straps from the area of the docking target on the Pirs airlock and docking compartment, inspected and photographed the exterior of the Russian portion of the station. The spacewalk was conducted from Pirs Docking Compartment airlock in Russian Orlan space suits. and came to a close at 21:11 UTC when the airlock hatch was closed. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 49 minutes and marked the 120th spacewalk in support of space station assembly and maintenance.  Resignation  In 2013, he submitted his resignation, effective 14 September. It was announced that he was resigning for a more interesting job. Lonchakov had been scheduled to fly on Expedition 44 to the International Space Station, and at the time of announcement, no replacement had been named. Gennady Padalka will be his replacement.  Post-space career  Lonchakov resigned from the cosmonaut corps under pressure from his wife to make more money. He took up a position at Gazprom, earning more than twice his income at the space agency. On 31 March 2014 Lonchakov was officially declared as acting head of GCTC.

Belize is a country with a rich variety of wildlife, due to its unique position between North and South America, and a wide range of climates and habitats for plant and animal life. Belize's low human population, and approximately of undistributed land, provides an ideal home for more than 5000 species of plants, and hundreds of species of animals ‚Äî including armadillos, snakes, and monkeys.  Mammals  Birds  The avifauna of Belize include a total of 590 species, of which two are globally endangered and four have been introduced by humans. Amphibians There are many species of salamanders, toads, and frogs found in the tropical forests of Belize such as the rufescent salamander, red-eyed tree frog, Maya rain frog, marine toad, and Mexican burrowing toad. Out of 450 species of salamanders found in the world, only six types are found in Belize, all of which belong to the family Plethodontidae. This group of salamanders are the lungless salamanders, meaning they do not breath through lungs, but instead through the pores of their moist skin. There are three species of toads living in Belize, out of more than 300. The largest known toad can be found in Belize, the marine toad. It can grow up to 20 cm (8 in), and weight as much as 1.2 kg (2.5 lb.). These toads are more commonly found in human settlements rather than in the wild, so they are easily seen by tourists. They have adapted to human settlements, so they will eat cat or dog food left out for house pets. There are more than 800 species of rain frogs that exist, and eight of them are found in Belize. They vary in size, from the Maya rain frog which is about 2.5-3.5 cm (1 in), to the Central American rain frog which can be 9 cm (3.5 in) long. Rain frogs are usually terrestrial, so they can be found on the forest floors, in or near pools, ponds, and streams. They are different from tree frogs in their color; usually having more earth tones with dark markings on their backs and legs. Out of more than 700 species of tree frogs, 12 of them can be found in Belize. Unlike rain frogs, they have more bright colors such as orange, blue, red and yellow to warn predators that they are poisonous. Tree frogs, like their name, are most commonly found in trees. Despite their skinny legs, they are very good jumpers and climbers. Reptiles In Belize, there are 2 species of crocodilians that roam around the waters, the American crocodile and Morelet's crocodile. Although both of these species are not particularly aggressive, they are found as a danger to humans. The American crocodile can grow up to 6.4 m (21 ft), on average being about 4 m (13 ft). They are usually found in the swamps and lowlands of Belize. Morelet's crocodile, which is smaller, can grown up to 4 m (13 ft) but the average size is 2.5 m (8 ft). These crocodiles are mostly seen along the coast of Northern and Central Belize in freshwater. Belize has many species and types of turtles. There are three species of hard-shelled sea turtles such as the loggerhead, which on average is 2.3 m (7.5 ft) long and 540 kg (1190 lb.). They are found in the open oceans and coastal waters of Belize. Another is the green sea turtle which on average is 1.5 m (5 m) and can weigh up to 100 kg (220 lb.). Green sea turtles migrate across open seas but are primarily found in shallow coastal waters. The third type of hard-shelled sea turtle that can be found in Belize is the hawksbill turtle. This sea turtle is only about 1 m (3.3 ft) and does not exceed 50 kg (110 lb.), and they are usually found near coral reefs or rocky areas of the sea. Five species of mud and musk turtles are found in the fresh water bodies of Belize: narrow-bridged musk turtles, Tabasco mud turtles, white-lipped mud turtles, scorpion mud turtles, and Mexican giant musk turtles. Two of the species of turtles that live primarily on land in Belize are the furrowed wood turtle and the slider turtle. Some other species of turtles commonly found in Belize are Central American river turtles which live in fresh water and their average size is about 65 cm (25 in), and snapping turtles which can tolerate any type of body of water, and on average are about 47 cm (18 in). Belize is home to many tropical snake species, including both venomous and nonvenomous snakes. The families found in Belize consist of Colubridae, Boidae, Elapidae and Viperidae, of which the latter two families are highly venomous and may present a potential health hazard to humans if provoked. Out of 1500 species of colubrids known, 60 of these species live in the tropical habitats of Belize. Many of the colubrid species found in Belize are often Neotropical forms of the Neartic colubrids found in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, with some of the species of colubrid snakes consisting of the water snakes, brown snakes, garter snakes, whip snakes, green snakes, rat snakes, and king snakes. Colubrid snakes differ from other Belize snakes in a few ways. Colubrids typically do not have a definable jaw line, and often have heads that are not much thicker than the neck, if at all. In addition, they have several rows of teeth on the roof of their mouth, as well as single row of teeth on the bottom jaw, but they do not have elongated, hollow fangs in the upper jaw as some of the venomous snakes often do. The only species in the family Boidae that is found in Belize is the boa constrictor, which includes a separate locality form (potentially a separate subspecies) from Crawl Cay. A dwarf form, Belizean boa constrictors can reach up to a maximum length of but typically only reach a length of . Their patterns typically consists of brown or black squarish markings on a grey or brown background that become progressively rounder, larger, and darker towards the tail, and this pattern helps them to camouflage in their surroundings, often in leaf litter, bushes, and tree canopies, to remain hidden from both prey and predators. Both the nonvenomous boa constrictors and much of the colubrid species primarily kill their prey via constriction, grabbing their prey within their jaws before throwing coils of their muscular bodies around the prey item and squeezing a great amount of pressure, killing their prey by asphyxiation and ruptured blood capillaries. Boa constrictors are ambush hunters, while colubrids will vary between being either active hunters or ambush hunters. The venomous snakes in Belize can be split into two families: the Viperidae, and the Elapidae. The Viperidae of Belize contains pit vipers such as rattlesnakes, lanceheads, and the cantils. Most of the venomous snakes in Belize are in this family. Some of the specific species found in Belize are the fer-de-lance, (Bothrops asper) which can grow up to 2.5 m (8 ft) in length, the eyelash viper (Bothriechis shlegelii), which can grow up to 1 m (3 ft), and the Neotropical rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus), with can reach a length of 1.5 m (5 ft). Pit vipers, much like the nonvenomous boa constrictor, are usually ambush hunters that will remain hidden, laying in wait in a single general area, potentially up for several days, before striking a prey item that crosses their path with immense speed. There are only 3 species of the family Elapidae that are found in Belize, all of which are classified as different species of coral snakes. Coral snakes are often found in bright vivid patterns which represent a warning to potential predators or aggravators, also of which are known to be mimicked by the colubriod milk snakes as a form of Batesian mimicry. Coral snakes from Belize are typically small, rarely ever grow longer than 1 m (3 ft). However, their venom is known to be a very powerful neurotoxin. There are eight species of geckos that inhabit Belize. They are very small, harmless lizards, that can climb walls due to their big toes and claws that allow them to cling easily. This is why they are often found in homes of people in Belize, hanging on the walls. They are usually a length of 5‚Äì10 cm (2‚Äì4 in), not including the tail. The size of the tail can vary dramatically because of the gecko's ability to detach it and grow another. There is one species of gecko that can only be found in Belize, which is the Belize leaf-toed gecko. The world's smallest reptile, the Caribbean dwarf gecko, which on average is 4 cm (1.5 in) long, has also made its home in Belize.

History Medical software has been in use since at least since the 1960s, a time when the first computerized information-handling system in the hospital sphere was being considered by Lockheed. As computing became more widespread and useful in the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the concept of \\"medical software\\" as a data and operations management tool in the medical industry ‚Äî including in the physician's office ‚Äî became more prevalent. Medical software became more prominent in medical devices in fields such as nuclear medicine, cardiology, and medical robotics by the early 1990s, prompting additional scrutiny of the \\"safety-critical\\" nature of medical software in the research and legislative communities, in part fueled by the Therac-25 radiation therapy device scandal. The development of the ISO 9000-3 standard as well as the European Medical Devices Directive in 1993 helped bring some harmonization of existing laws with medical devices and their associated software, and the addition of IEC 62304 in 2006 further cemented how medical device software should be developed and tested. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also offered guidance and driven regulation on medical software, particularly embedded in and used as medical devices. A portable heart rate variability device is an example of a medical device that contains medical device software. Medical device software The global IEC 62304 standard on the software life cycle processes of medical device software states it's a \\"software system that has been developed for the purpose of being incorporated into the medical device being developed or that is intended for use as a medical device in its own right.\\" In the U.S., the FDA states that \\"any software that meets the legal definition of a [medical] device\\" is considered medical device software. A similar \\"software can be a medical device\\" interpretation was also made by the European Union in 2007 with an update to its European Medical Devices Directive, when \\"used specifically for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes.\\" Due to the broad scope covered by these terms, manifold classifications can be proposed for various medical software, based for instance on their technical nature (embedded in a device or standalone), on their level of safety (from the most trivial to the most safety-critical ones), or on their primarily function (treatment, education, diagnostics, and/or data management). Software as a medical device The dramatic increase in smartphone usage in the twenty-first century triggered the emergence of thousands of stand-alone health- and medical-related software apps, many falling into a gray or borderline area in terms of regulation. While software embedded into a medical device was being addressed, medical software separate from medical hardware ‚Äî referred to by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) as \\"software as a medical device\\" or \\"SaMD\\" ‚Äî was falling through existing regulatory cracks. In the U.S., the FDA eventually released new draft guidance in July 2011 on \\"mobile medical applications,\\" with members of the legal community such as Keith Barritt speculating it should be read to imply \\"as applicable to all software ... since the test for determining whether a mobile application is a regulated mobile 'medical' application is the same test one would use to determine if any software is regulated.\\" Examples of mobile apps potentially covered by the guidance included those that regulate an installed pacemaker or those that analyze images for cancerous lesions, X-rays and MRI, graphic data such as EEG waveforms as well as bedside monitors, urine analyzers, glucometer, stethoscopes, spirometers, BMI calculators, heart rate monitors and body fat calculators. By the time its final guidance was released in late 2013, however, members of Congress began to be concerned about the how the guidance would be used in the future, in particular with what it would mean to the SOFTWARE Act legislation that had recently been introduced. Around the same time, the IMDRF were working on a more global perspective of SaMD with the release of its Key Definitions in December 2013, focused on \\"[establishing] a common framework for regulators to incorporate converged controls into their regulatory approaches for SaMD.\\" Aside from \\"not [being] necessary for a hardware medical device to achieve its intended medical purpose,\\" the IMDRF also found that SaMD also couldn't drive a medical device, though it could be used as a module of or interfaced with one. The group further developed quality management system principles for SaMD in 2015. International standards IEC 62304 has become the benchmark standard for the development of medical device software, whether standalone software or otherwise, in both the E.U. and the U.S. Leading industry innovation in software technologies has led key industry leaders and government regulators to recognize the emergence of numerous standalone medical software products that operate as medical devices. This has been reflected in regulatory changes in the E.U. (European Medical Devices Directive) and the U.S. (various FDA guidance documents). Additionally, quality management system requirements for manufacturing a software medical device, as is the case with any medical device, are described in the U.S. Quality Systems Regulation of the FDA and also in ISO 13485:2003. Software technology manufacturers that operate within the software medical device space conduct mandatory development of their products in accordance with those requirements. Furthermore, though not mandatory, they may elect to obtain certification from a notified body, having implemented such quality system requirements as described within international standards such as ISO 13485:2003.

In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), they belong mainly to the Ferralsols, but some are Plinthosols or Nitisols. Some oxisols have been previously classified as laterite soils. Formation The main processes of soil formation of oxisols are weathering, humification and pedoturbation due to animals. These processes produce the characteristic soil profile. They are defined as soils containing at all depths no more than ten percent weatherable minerals, and low cation exchange capacity. Oxisols are always a red or yellowish color, due to the high concentration of iron(III) and aluminium oxides and hydroxides. They also contain quartz and kaolin, plus small amounts of other clay minerals and organic matter. Etymology The word \\"oxisol\\" comes from \\"oxide\\" in reference to the dominance of oxide minerals such as bauxite. In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources, oxisols are known as ferralsols. Occurrence Present-day oxisols are found almost exclusively in tropical areas, in South America and Africa, almost always on highly stable continental cratons. In Southeast Asia, oxisols are found on remnants of the Cimmerian microcontinent, and on the Shan‚ÄìThai Terrane. In Thailand, rhodic ferralsols, called Yasothon soils, are said to have formed under humid tropical conditions in the early Tertiary, on an extensive plain later uplifted to form the Khorat Plateau. Characterized by a bright red color, these relict soils occur on uplands in a great semicircle around the southern rim, overlying associated gravel horizons said to have been cleared of sand by termites, in a prolonged and still on-going process of bioturbation. Xanthic ferralsols of the Khorat and Udon series, characterized by a pale yellow to brown color, developed in midlands in processes still under investigation; as are those forming lowland soils resembling European brown soils.Lofjle, E.; Kubiniok, J. Landform development and bioturbation on the Khorat plateau, Northeast Thailand, Nat.Hist.Bull.Siam Soc. (56), 1996 In Australia vast areas formerly covered in rainforest have become so dry that oxisols have formed a hard ironstone cover upon which only skeletal soils can form. Genesis Fossil oxisols are known from the first appearance of free oxygen in the atmosphere about 2,200 million years ago. In warm periods like the Mesozoic and Paleocene, oxisols extended to areas that now have quite cool climates, extending well into North America and Europe. It is believed oxisols became vegetated later than ultisols or alfisols, probably because vegetation took a long time to adapt to the infertility of oxisols. History Scientists originally thought that the heavy vegetation of tropical rain forests would provide rich nutrients, but as rainfall passes through the litter on the forest floor the rain is acidified and leaches minerals from the above soil layers. This forces plants to get their nutrition from decaying litter as oxisols are quite infertile due to the lack of organic matter and the almost complete absence of soluble minerals leached by the wet and humid climate. Uses Oxisols are often used for tropical crops such as cocoa and rubber. In some cases, rice is grown on them. Permanent cropping of oxisols in low-income areas is very difficult because of low cation exchange capacities and high phosphorus fixation on iron and aluminium oxides (ligand exchange mechanism; inner sphere complex with phosphate). However, many oxisols can be cultivated over a wide range of moisture conditions. On this account, oxisols are intensively exploited for agriculture in some regions which have enough wealth to support modern agricultural practices (including regular additions of lime and fertilizer). A recent example of exploitation by modern methods involves the growing of soybeans in Brazil. Suborders Oxisols are divided into the following suborders: * Aquox ‚Äì oxisols with a water table at or near the surface for much of the year * Perox ‚Äì oxisols of continuously humid climates, where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in all months * Torrox ‚Äì oxisols of arid climates. Because the present climate can never produce enough weathering to produce oxisols, torrox soils are always paleosols formed during periods of much wetter climates. They occur mainly in Southern Africa. * Ustox ‚Äì oxisols of semiarid and subhumid climates * Udox ‚Äì oxisols of humid climates  See also   *  Notes  References  * Buol, Hole, and McCracken, (1997). ‚ÄòSoil Genesis and Classification.‚Äô 4th edition.

A. Cross, was a British statesman and Conservative politician. He notably served as Home Secretary between 1874 and 1880 and 1885 and 1886. Background and education Cross was born in Red Scar, near Preston, Lancashire, the son of William Cross (1771‚Äì1827) and his wife Ellen, daughter of Edward Chaffers. He was educated at Rugby School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was the President of the Cambridge Union in 1845. He was called to the Bar by the Inner Temple, in 1849, attaching himself to the Northern Circuit. Political career Carlo Pellegrini) in 1874. Cross entered Parliament as one of two representatives for Preston in 1857, a seat he held until 1862. He was out of Parliament for the next year. While out of Parliament, Cross was a partner at Parr's Bank, of which he became chairman in 1870. In 1868 he was elected for South West Lancashire, topping the poll and defeating Gladstone, and continued to represent this constituency until his elevation to the peerage in 1886. Cross first came to prominence as Home Secretary in Disraeli's second government (1874‚Äì1880), to which post he had been appointed without first holding junior office. He remained Home Secretary in Lord Salisbury's first government (1885‚Äì1886). The latter year he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Cross, of Broughton-in-Furness in the County Palatine of Lancaster, and was moved over to the India Office (1886‚Äì1892), where he oversaw the passage of the Indian Councils Act 1892. Lord Cross was very briefly Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in Salisbury's third government (1895‚Äì1902) before being elevated to the sinecure post Lord Privy Seal. In 1898 he chaired the Joint Select Committee on Electrical Energy (Generating Stations and Supply), which recommended granting compulsory purchase powers for the building of power stations. He retired in 1900. In 1884, Cross was elected to the Board of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, and he remained a Director of that company, and of its successor the Great Central Railway (GCR), until his death. During Board meetings, he would occasionally murmur \\"Where is the money to come from?\\" In June 1909, when he was senior Director of the GCR, that railway named one of its class 8D express passenger locomotives The Rt. Hon. Viscount Cross G.C.B., G.C.S.I. in his honour. Family Lord Cross married Georgiana, daughter of Thomas Lyon, in 1852. His eldest son, the Hon. William Cross, represented Liverpool West Derby in Parliament. Lady Cross died in January 1907. Lord Cross survived her by seven years and died in January 1914, aged 90. He was succeeded in the viscountcy by his grandson, Richard Assheton Cross, the only son of the Honourable William Cross.

The word \\"film\\" in the phrase dates back to the early decades of TV news when footage was regularly recorded on film. 11 o'clock is the traditional time slot for late evening local news broadcasts in the Eastern and Pacific time zones of the United States, while the news comes at 10:00 in much of the rest of the country.  History  Television news gathering originally involved crews using 16 mm film (or, at lower-budget stations, Super 8 mm film) that would be processed at the station and had to be edited before it could be aired. The time taken for this process meant that film of an early evening event would only be available in time for the late newscast.Kovalchik, Kara (25 March 2014). The Origins of 8 Nearly Obsolete Phrases, mental floss The purpose of these \\"Film at 11\\" promotions was to attract viewers and increase the program's ratings. However, news broadcasts were not counted in ratings during the time 16mm film was used in newsgathering and hence promotions typically took the form of \\"newsflashes\\" or \\"special reports\\" that conveyed the facts of the story. The phrase entered popular culture in the 1970s, often describing ordinary or mundane events with an implication that the said events were being overly sensationalized, or as a short-hand expression akin to \\"tell you later.\\" Whether he is to be credited with originating the phrase, in West Coast local news the phrase is commonly attributed to Jerry Dunphy during his time with KABC-TV in Los Angeles. The phrase was used in many TV shows and movies from the 1960s through the 1980s. The phrase became obsolete with the advent of videotape as the medium of choice for news reporting. In the 21st century, this has transitioned even further to digital video. See also *Do you know where your children are?

It entered service with the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service in the autumn of 1916. With pleasant flying characteristics and good manoeuvrability, the aircraft proved very successful. The Pup was eventually outclassed by newer German fighters, but it was not completely replaced on the Western Front until the end of 1917. Remaining Pups were relegated to Home Defence and training units. The Pup's docile flying characteristics also made it ideal for use in aircraft carrier deck landing and takeoff experiments. Design and development Sopwith Pup in flight (1917) In 1915, Sopwith produced a personal aircraft for the company's test pilot Harry Hawker, a single-seat, tractor biplane powered by a seven-cylinder 50 hp Gnome rotary engine. This became known as Hawker's Runabout; another four similar aircraft have been tentatively identified as Sopwith Sparrows. Sopwith next developed a larger fighter that was heavily influenced by this design, though more powerful and controlled laterally with ailerons rather than by wing warping.Bruce 1992, pp. 509‚Äì512. The resulting aircraft was a single-bay, single-seat biplane with a fabric-covered wooden framework and staggered equal-span wings. The cross-axle type main landing gear was supported by V-struts attached to the lower fuselage longerons. The prototype and most production Pups were powered by the 80 hp (60 kW) Le Rh√¥ne 9C rotary engine. Armament was a single 0.303 inch (7.7 mm) Vickers machine gun synchronized with the Sopwith-Kauper synchronizer. A prototype was completed in February 1916 and sent to Upavon for testing in late March. The Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) quickly ordered two more prototypes, then placed a production order. Sopwith was heavily engaged in production of the 1¬Ω Strutter, and produced only a small number of Pups for the RNAS. Deliveries commenced in August 1916. The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) also placed large orders for Pups. The RFC orders were undertaken by sub-contractors Standard Motor Co. and Whitehead Aircraft. Deliveries did not commence until the beginning of 1917. A total of 1,770 Pups were built by Sopwith (96), Standard Motor Co. (850), Whitehead Aircraft (820), and William Beardmore & Co. (30). Operational history Sopwith Pup side view, 1916 In May 1916, the RNAS received its first Pups for operational trials with \\"A\\" Naval Squadron. The first Pups reached the Western Front in October 1916 with No. 8 Squadron RNAS, and proved successful, with the squadron's Pups claiming 20 enemy machines destroyed in operations over the Somme battlefield by the end of the year.Bruce 1954, p. 9. The first RFC Squadron to re-equip with the Pup was No. 54 Squadron, which arrived in France in December. The Pup quickly proved its superiority over the early Fokker, Halberstadt and Albatros biplanes. After encountering the Pup in combat, Manfred von Richthofen said, \\"We saw at once that the enemy aeroplane was superior to ours.\\"\\"Sopwith Pup.\\" theaerodrome.com. Retrieved: 16 July 2010. The Pup's light weight and generous wing area gave it a good rate of climb. Agility was enhanced by installing ailerons on both wings. The Pup had half the horsepower and armament of the German Albatros D.III, but was much more manoeuvrable, especially over 15,000 ft (4,500 m) due to its low wing loading. Ace James McCudden stated that \\"When it came to manoeuvring, the Sopwith [Pup] would turn twice to an Albatros' once ... it was a remarkably fine machine for general all-round flying. It was so extremely light and well surfaced that after a little practice one could almost land it on a tennis court.\\" However, the Pup was also longitudinally unstable. At the peak of its operational deployment, the Pup equipped only four RNAS squadrons (Nos. 3, 4, 8 and 9), and three RFC squadrons (Nos. 54, 46 and 66). By the spring of 1917, the Pup had been outclassed by the newest German fighters. The RNAS replaced their Pups, first with Sopwith Triplanes, and then with Sopwith Camels. The RFC soldiered on with Pups, in spite of increasing casualties, until it was possible to replace them with Camels in December 1917. Home Defence duties Pup with 100 hp Gnome Monosoupape engine The raids on London by Gotha bombers in mid-1917 caused far more damage and casualties than the earlier airship raids. The ineffective response by British interceptor units had serious political repercussions. In response, No. 66 Squadron was withdrawn to Calais for a short period, and No. 46 was transferred for several weeks to Sutton's Farm airfield near London. Two new Pup squadrons were formed specifically for Home Defence duties, No. 112 in July, and No. 61 in August. The first Pups delivered to Home Defence units utilised the 80 hp Le Rh√¥ne, but subsequent Home Defence Pups standardised on the more powerful 100 hp Gnome Monosoupape, which provided improved rate of climb. These aircraft were distinguishable by the addition of vents in the cowling face.Bruce 1954, p. 10. Shipboard use Sqn Cdr E. H. Dunning attempting a landing on HMS Furious in a Sopwith Pup (August 1917) Sopwith Pups were also used in many pioneering carrier experiments. On 2 August 1917, a Pup flown by Sqn Cdr Edwin Dunning became the first aircraft to land aboard a moving ship, . Dunning was killed on his third landing when the Pup fell over the side of the ship.Bruce 1954, p. 11. The Pup began operations on the carriers in early 1917; the first aircraft were fitted with skid undercarriages in place of the standard landing gear. Landings utilised a system of deck wires to \\"trap\\" the aircraft. Later versions reverted to the normal undercarriage. Pups were used as ship-based fighters on three carriers: , Furious and . A number of other Pups were deployed to cruisers and battleships where they were launched from platforms attached to gun turrets. A Pup flown from a platform on the cruiser shot down the German Zeppelin L 23 off the Danish coast on 21 August 1917. The U.S. Navy also employed the Sopwith Pup with famed Australian/British test pilot Edgar Percival testing the use of carrier-borne fighters. In 1926, Percival was catapulted in a Pup off the battleship at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. Training duties The Pup saw extensive use as a trainer. Student pilots completing basic flight training in the Avro 504k often graduated to the Pup as an intermediate trainer. The Pup was also used in Fighting School units for instruction in combat techniques. Many training Pups were in fact reserved by senior officers and instructors as their personal runabouts while a few survived in France as personal or squadron 'hacks' after the type was withdrawn from combat. Nomenclature The Pup was officially named the Sopwith Scout. The \\"Pup\\" nickname arose because pilots considered it to be the \\"pup\\" of the larger two-seat Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter. The name never had official status as it was felt to be \\"undignified,\\"\\"Sopwith Pup.\\" Royal Air Force Museum. Retrieved: 18 August 2008. but a precedent was set, and all later Sopwith types apart from the Triplane acquired animal names (Camel, Dolphin, Snipe etc.), which ended up with the Sopwith firm being said to have created a \\"flying zoo\\" during the First World War.

Built by Standard Motors in 1917 and delivered to a Home Defence squadron. This aircraft was originally fitted with a 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome Monosoupape engine, along with the distinctive three-quarter vented cowling. It was refitted by the 80 hp (60 kW) Le Rh√¥ne engine sometime in 1918. B1807 was sold at Croydon in 1920 and entered the civil register as G-EAVX. It appeared on 16 July at the 1921 Aerial Derby at Hendon, where it was groundlooped by its pilot. The wings were removed and the fuselage disappeared until 1973, when the current owner discovered the remains of the aircraft in a barn in Dorset. * N5182 ‚Äì Pup on static display at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in Cosford, Shropshire. Built by Sopwith Aviation Co. at Kingston upon Thames in 1916. N5182 was operated by several RNAS squadrons in Belgium and Northern France. It was flown by the noted aces Edward Grange and Robert A. Little, both of whom scored victories with the aircraft. A private collector acquired N5182 from the French Air Force in 1959 and restored it to airworthy condition. N5182 was acquired by the museum in 1982. * N5195 ‚Äì Pup on static display at the Museum of Army Flying in Middle Wallop, Hampshire.

Native Americans Urban Indians, communities developed by small enclaves of Native Americans/First Nations and Alaskan Natives since the 1930s. They tend to form small percentages of the urban areas' population. Virtually every major city in the US has an American Indian community. See Rancherie/ Rancher√≠a for urban Indian parts of Las Vegas, Nevada and Reno, Nevada. In Canada, Urban Indian Reserves were designated within Canadian cities and other urban areas, which may allow for aboriginal commercial ventures which enjoy the tax exemptions offered to traditional reserves.\\"Relationships: Treaty awareness in Saskatchewan / Urban Reserves\\" (PDF). Office of the Treaty Commissioner (Saskatchewan). Archived from the original (PDF) on 6 July 2011. Retrieved 2 March 2008.

They are sometimes also called \\"power\\" maneuvers, as they are meant to emphasize a wrestler's strength. Many of these moves are used as finishers by many wrestlers. Many maneuvers are known by several different names. Professional wrestlers frequently give their \\"finisher\\" (signature moves that usually result in a win) new names that reflect their gimmick. Moves are listed under general categories whenever possible. Armbreaker An armbreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams the opponent's arm against a part of the wrestler's body, usually a knee or shoulder. Diving armbreaker A wrestler dives from the ropes and lands on the opponent's arm. Double knee armbreaker The wrestler grabs one of the opponent's arms, jumps and connects both their knees against the opponent's stretched arm. As the wrestler falls onto their back they forces the opponent's arm down into both knees, thus damaging it. Arm drag A move in which the wrestler uses their opponent's momentum to the opponent's disadvantage. The wrestler hooks the opponent's arm and flips them over on to the mat. The wrestler may roll on to their side to give the move extra momentum. Japanese arm drag This move is performed when an opponent runs towards the wrestler facing them. When the opponent is in range, the wrestler hooks the opponent's near arm with both hands and falls backwards forcing the wrestler's own momentum to cause them to flip forwards over the head of the wrestler and on to their back. Despite its name, it actually comes from Mexican lucha libre, not Japanese puroresu. Over-the-shoulder arm drag The wrestler grabs their opponent's arm, then turns to face the other direction and pulls the opponent over their shoulder. It is essentially the same as the ippon seoi nage found in judo. Tilt-a- whirl arm drag An arm drag which sees the wrestler being spun in front of the opponent's body in a tilt-a-whirl, and then ending it up with an arm drag. Wheelbarrow arm drag This arm drag sees the wrestler being held in a wheelbarrow hold by the opponent, and then going for an over the shoulder arm drag as they free their legs off of the opponent's waist. It was used by AJ Lee as a Transition Move. Arm wringer An arm wringer or spinning wristlock is a move in which the wrestler grabs the opponent's wrist with both hands and twists it over the wrestler's head to spin the arm around, either with enough force to flip the opponent to the mat or just to hyperrotate the joints while standing. When used as a hold, the wrestler often yanks the arm for added effect. Atomic drop A move in which the wrestler goes behind an opponent, then puts their head under the opponent's shoulder. They then lift their opponent up, and drops them tailbone-first on the wrestler's knee. Known in Mexico's Lucha Libre as Silla El√©ctrica (Spanish for electric chair). Inverted atomic drop Periodically called a Manhattan Drop, this is a move in which the wrestler puts their head under the opponent's shoulder and lifts the opponent up and then drops their \\"lower abdomen region\\" or groin first on the wrestler's knee. Even though this move is an indirect low blow, it is considered a legal move because the groin is not being targeted. Sitout full nelson atomic drop Better known as a full nelson bomb, this move sees the wrestling apply a full nelson hold to the opponent from behind. The wrestler then lifts the opponent into the air and falls into a seated position, driving the opponent tailbone-first on to the mat. This move is used by Bubba Ray Dudley, who dubbed it the Bubba Bomb/Bully Bomb. Backbreaker A backbreaker refers to professional wrestling moves in which a wrestler drops an opponent so that the opponent's back impacts or is bent backwards against a part of the wrestler's body, usually the knee. Back body drop A back body drop or backdrop (also sometimes called a shoulder back toss), is a move in which a wrestler bends forward or crouches in front of their opponent, grabs hold of the opponent, and stands up, lifting the opponent up and over and dropping them behind the back. It is applied frequently against a charging opponent. In Japan, a backdrop is the term for what is called a belly-to-back suplex in America, so in Japan, it is called shoulder throw. Mountain Bomb Innovated by Hiroyoshi Tenzan. This move sees the opponent runs towards the wrestler. The wrestler ducks, hooks one of the opponent's legs with one of their arms, stands up and falls backwards, flipping the opponent and driving them back first down to the mat, with the wrestler landing on top of the opponent. Beel throw The wrestler stands slightly to the side of their opponent, grabs the opponent by the nape in a single or double collar tie, and throws them forward, causing the opponent to flip over onto their back. It is considered a very basic technique, so basic that a forward rolling fall is commonly called a biel bump and is mainly used by very large wrestlers to emphasize power and strength over finesse. Brainbuster Austin Aries performing a Brainbuster to Mark Haskins. A brainbuster is a move in which a wrestler puts their opponent in a front facelock, hooks their tights, and lifts them up as if they were performing a vertical suplex. The wrestler then jumps up and falls onto their back so that the opponent lands on their head while remaining vertical. Bulldog A bulldog, originally known as bulldogging or a bulldogging headlock or the headlock jawbreaker, is any move in which the wrestler grabs an opponent's head and jumps forward, so that the wrestler lands, often in a sitting position, and drives the opponent's face into the mat. This move plus some other variations are sometimes referred to as a facebuster. Cobra clutch bulldog The wrestler applies a cobra clutch and then leaps forward, falling into a sitting position and driving the face of the opponent into the ground. Cutter A cutter is a three-quarter facelock bulldog. This move sees an attacking wrestler, while facing away from the opponent, apply a three-quarter facelock (reaching back and grabbing the head of the opponent, thus pulling the opponent's jaw above the wrestler's shoulder) before falling backwards (sometimes after running forwards first) to force the opponent face-first to the mat below. Diving bulldog The wrestler jumps from the turnbuckle behind the opponent. then applies a headlock, driving the opponent's face into the mat. Diving leg drop bulldog Also known as diving Famouser. Sees the wrestler springboarding off one of the ropes or jumping from the top turnbuckle, dropping a leg across the nape of a leaning forward opponent. This move was popularized by John Cena as one of his signature moves. Fireman's carry bulldog The attacking wrestler picks up the opponent in a fireman's carry. The wrestler then proceeds by holding their opponent's legs with one arm and applying a headlock with their other arm in a similar fashion to an Air Raid Crash. From here, the attacking wrestler twists the opposite way and quickly switches back, throwing the opponent's legs out backwards and drops down to the mat while holding the opponent's head, forcing them to fall face first into a bulldog position. This move is used by TNA wrestler James Storm, who dubbed it the Eight Second Ride. Full nelson bulldog Begins with the wrestler holding the opponent in a full nelson. The wrestler then falls forward onto their back or into a sitting position, driving the opponent face-first. The move was popularized by Jillian Hall. Half nelson bulldog The wrestler hooks a half nelson hold on their opponent with one arm and their opponent's waist with the other, then leaps forward into a sitting position, driving the face of the opponent into the ground. This move is also incorrectly referred to as a faceplant, which is a different move altogether. Inverted bulldog The attacking wrestler stands side-to-side and slightly behind the opponent, facing in the opposite direction, then leaps in the air and drops to a seated position, driving the opponent neck- and back-first to the mat. In another variation, the attacker runs to the opponent and executes the move. This is usually referred to a lariat takedown. Knee drop bulldog A version that involves the wrestler placing one knee against the base of a bent over opponent's neck, then dropping to force the opponent down to the mat, landing on the opponent's upper body. There is also a diving version. Leg drop bulldog The wrestler jumps in the air and uses one leg to push down on the head of an opponent who is leaning forward, which drives the opponent face-first into the mat. The move was innovated by Johnny Ace calling it The Ace Crusher II and later popularized by Billy Gunn, who called it the Famouser (which was also used by Dolph Ziggler) or Fame-Ass-Er, the latter name used when he wrestled as \\"Mr. Ass.\\" Marty Jannetty performed a version of the move where he applied a wristlock to the opponent first, which became known as the Rocker Dropper. Kelly Kelly later adopted the same variation as her finishing maneuver, calling it K2. =Inverted leg drop bulldog= Melina performing an inverted leg drop bulldog on Alicia Fox An inverted version of this sees the attacking wrestler drop the opponent on the back of their head, as done in a reverse bulldog. This can be achieved by first holding an opponent in an inverted facelock or by simply grabbing the opponent and forcibly leaning them back before lifting their far (or sometimes inside) leg, rotating so the leg is over the opponent's head, and dropping to a sitting position, kneeling, or a split-legged position and maintained into a pin. WWE wrestler Melina popularized this move. One-handed bulldog Chris Jericho performing a one-handed bulldog on Booker T. The one-handed bulldog is in fact more of a facebuster than an actual bulldog and generally sees a wrestler run up from behind their opponent, grab the opponent's head with one hand, and leap forward. Kenny Omega has used a variation, called the Kotaro Krusher, where he performed a jump from the canvas to 6 feet before hitting the bulldog. Reverse bulldog Standing next to or diagonally behind an opponent, the attacking wrestler leaps up, grabs the opponent's head and pulls backwards, resulting in both individuals landing supine. WWE wrestler Dolph Ziggler uses this move, which he calls the Zig Zag. Slingshot bulldog Similar to a hangman, where the wrestler catches the opponent in a side headlock, running towards any set of ropes. The wrestler then jumps over them and bulldogs the opponent, driving the chin/face of the opponent into the top rope. The wrestler would eventually either land standing or seated on the apron or the outside of the ring. The same maneuver can be used to a cornered opponent (who is facing away from the ring/towards the outside) to drive their face into the top turnbuckle. Spinning bulldog The wrestler stands to the side of the opponent and applies a side headlock. The wrestler then spins around in a circle and drops into a seated position, driving the opponent face-first into the mat. Springboard bulldog Trish Stratus hits the Stratusfaction (springboard bulldog) on Victoria. The wrestler applies a headlock on the opponent, then runs towards the ropes and bounces off, driving the opponent face-first into mat as they land. WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus popularized this move and is known as Stratusfaction and by Bo Dallas as the Bo-Dog. Two-handed bulldog The wrestler places both hands behind the opponent's head, then falls into a seated position, slamming the opponent's face into the canvas. Another variation sees the wrestler placing one hand behind the opponent's head and the other behind the back, then falling backwards into a bulldog. WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley used this move as his signature move. Wheelbarrow bulldog This bulldog sees the opponent clutching the wrestler in a wheelbarrow bodyscissors. The wrestler then falls downwards while still scissoring their legs around the opponent's waist, and pushes by hitting their palms against the canvas. As they gets rebounded back to the opponent, the attacker releases their legs, quickly places their hand behind the opponent's head, and goes for a bulldog. The bulldog is usually one-handed rather than a headlock bulldog. Catapult A catapult or slingshot catapult is a throw that typically starts with the opponent on their back, and the wrestler standing and facing them. The wrestler hooks each of the opponent's legs in one of their arms, then falls backwards to slingshot the opponent into a turnbuckle, ladder, rope, mat, etc. This can also be held for a backbreaker. Chokeslam A chokeslam is any body slam in which the wrestler grasps their opponent's neck, lifts them up, and slams them to the mat, causing them to land on their back. The move is used by numerous wrestlers, often larger ones who portray \\"monster\\" characters. Iron claw slam This move is performed in the same style as a chokeslam, but instead the wrestler grabs the opponent with a clawhold. Rowan uses this move as a finisher and Lars Sullivan uses it as a signature. Armpit slam This move is performed in the same style as a chokeslam, but instead the wrestler grabs the opponent by their armpit and slams them to the mat, causing them to land on their back. Cobra clutch slam In this slam a wrestler places the opponent in a cobra clutch and then lifts the opponent into the air by their neck before jumping backwards, falling face down or into a sitting position, driving the opponent back first down to the mat. This move is popularized by Ted DiBiase Jr., who named it the Dream Street. Jinder Mahal uses this move calling it the Khallas. DDT Animated DDT move The DDT is a move innovated by Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts and performed by putting the opponent's head underneath the attacker's arm in a front facelock and then falling back, driving the opponent's head into the mat. Driver A driver is a move in which the wrestler clutches the opponent's body in some form before falling into a sitout position while dropping the opponent on their back, neck, and/or shoulders. Cobra clutch driver The wrestler stands behind an opponent and applies a cobra clutch on their opponent, placing one of their hands against the opponent's neck after hooking the opponent's arm with it. He/she then scoops the opponent's near leg with their other arm and lifts the opponent up, flips the opponent upside down, and then either kneels or sits down, driving the opponent down to the mat on their neck. Another variation has the attacking wrestler apply a pumphandle prior to executing this technique and is used by wrestlers like Jinder Mahal Electric chair driver Also known as a Joker Driver, In this variation of a driver, the wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in an electric chair sitting position and then takes hold of the opponent and pulls him/her over their shoulder and down to the mat while falling to a sit out position so that the opponent lands on their upper back and neck between the legs of the wrestler, facing towards him/her, usually resulting in a pin. A one-handed variation is used by Kenny Omega, known as One-Winged Angel, or Katayoku no Tenshi, and Killian Dain as the Ulster Plantation. Fisherman driver The wrestler places the opponent in a front facelock and hooks one of the opponent's legs with their free arm. The wrestler then lifts the opponent upside down or on to their shoulders, and then sits down, driving the opponent between their legs, head and shoulder first. A wrist-clutch variation of this driver exists which sees the wrestler lift the opponent on to their shoulders, and while the opponent is on their shoulders, he/she uses the hand hooking the opponent's leg to reach upwards and clutch the wrist of the arm opposite the hooked leg. While maintaining the wrist-clutch, they then perform the driver. There is a further variation that does not include the shoulder lift that sees the wrestler hook the leg and wrist while the opponent is standing in front of him/her, lift the opponent upside down and then fall to the sitout position. This move was made popular by wrestler Low Ki who calls it the Ki Krusher. A cross legged version is used by CIMA, who calls it the Perfect Driver. Travis Banks also uses this move calling it the Kiwi Crusher. =Wrist-Clutch Fisherman Driver= This variation, innovated by Kenta Kobashi as the Wrist-Clutch Burning Hammer, involves grabbing and pulling by the opponent's wrist, then lifting them up into the air, before falling to their back, driving the opponent to the ground on the back of their head/neck.This was popularized by Shingo Takagi as The Last Falconry,now used as The Last of the Dragon. Half nelson driver The wrestler stands behind an opponent and applies a half nelson hold on their opponent, placing one of their hands against the opponent's neck after hooking the opponent's arm with it. They then scoop the opponent's near leg with their other arm and lift the opponent up, flip the opponent upside down, and then either kneel or sit down, driving the opponent down to the mat on their neck. Another variation has the attacking wrestler apply a pumphandle prior to executing this technique. It is used by Jordynne Grace and P√©ntagon Dark. Nick Aldis performing the Michinoku Driver II on Christopher Daniels. Ayako Hamada performing a Michinoku Driver II on Daffney. Michinoku Driver II Innovated by Taka Michinoku, and technically known as a sitout scoop slam piledriver. Facing their opponent, the wrestler reaches between their opponent's legs with their right arm and reaches around the opponent's neck from the same side with their left arm. They then lift the opponent up and turn them around so that they are held upside down, as in a scoop slam, before dropping down into a sitout position, driving the opponent down to the mat neck and shoulder first. Many people call it the Michinoku Driver because it is used more often than the original Michinoku Driver. =Michinoku Driver II-B= A variation of the Michinoku Driver II in which the wrestler stands behind the opponent, applies an inverted facelock, lifts them upside down, and then drops down to a sitting position, driving the opponent down to the mat between the wrestler's legs upper back first. The move was also used by Vampiro with the name Nail in the Coffin. Samoan driver The attacking wrestler drapes an opponent over their shoulders in a fireman's carry position and then takes hold of the opponent and pulls them over their shoulder and down to the mat while falling to a sitting position so that the opponent lands on their upper back and neck between the legs of the wrestler, facing towards them. A cross-legged and wrist-clutch version of this move also exists. It is used as finishing moves by wrestlers such as Chris Sabin (Cradle Shock), Dana Brooke (Brooke Driver), El Hijo del Fantasma and Su Yung (Panic Switch) Wheelbarrow driver Similar to the wheelbarrow facebuster but instead of dropping their opponent face first, they drop their opponent so that the opponent lands on their upper back and neck between the legs of the wrestler, facing towards them, usually resulting in a pin. Electric chair drop The wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in an electric chair sitting position and then falls backwards driving the opponent back-first into the mat. There is also a driver, a facebuster and a suplex variation of the move. Facebreaker A facebreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams their opponent's face against a part of the wrestler's body, usually the knee. Double knee facebreaker This facebreaker involves an attacking wrestler, who is standing face-to-face with an opponent, hooking both hands around the opponent's head and then leaping to bring both knees up to the face of the opponent. The wrestler then falls backwards to the mat, thus forcing the opponent to fall forwards and impact the exposed knees. The move was originated by Phillip Michael Grant, and later popularized by Chris Jericho, who named it the Codebreaker. Bushi uses a diving variation called MX where he dives from the top rope to hit the double knee facebreaker. Liv Morgan's 201 Facebreaker (formerly the Jersey Codebreaker) is a variation where she stands 90 degrees from the opponent, and delivers the double knees or shins while she is landing. Inverted stomp facebreaker Also known as the Foot Stunner. The user applies a standing wrist lock on their opponent, then places their foot on the opponent's face and falls backwards, forcing the opponent's face into their foot. This move is used as a finishing move by Gail Kim (called Eat Defeat), Chuckie T (called Sole Food), Xavier Woods (called Lost in the Woods) and Enzo Amore of WWE recently started using this move as his finisher (called JawdonZo). Colt Cabana used the move (calling it Eat The Feet) and Mia Yim also uses it (called Seoul Food) as her signature move. Knee smash facebreaker The move is a standard facebreaker which involves the wrestler facing an opponent and grabbing him or her by the head or hair and pulling the opponent's face down, dropping it on to the wrestler's knee. Often used by a wrestler to stun an opponent and set him or her up for another move. Many other facebreakers use the knee to inflict the damage; one variation sees the wrestler apply a standing side headlock, and simultaneously pull the opponent forward and smash the wrestler's knee to the opponent's head. Shoulder facebreaker Also described as a hangman's facebreaker or an over the shoulder facebreaker, this facebreaker is performed when an attacking wrestler, who is standing in a back to back position with an opponent, reaches back to pull the opponent's head over their shoulder before (while keeping a hold of the opponent's head) spinning round to twist the opponent's head over as they drop down to one knee forcing the opponent face-first into the wrestlers exposed knee in one quick fluid motion. Single knee facebreaker Similar to the double knee facebreaker, but with only one knee. Tye Dillinger uses this move calling it Perfect 10. Facebuster A facebuster, also known as a faceplant, is any move in which the wrestler forces their opponent's face down to the mat which does not involve a headlock or facelock. Fallaway slam ODB performs a fallaway slam on Roxxi. Also known as a table-top suplex. The wrestler lifts the opponent up so the opponent is horizontal across the wrestler's body then falls backward, throwing the opponent over their head down to the mat back- first. This slam can be either bridged into a pin, or the wrestler can float over into another fallaway slam. This move is sometimes used as a continuation move from catching the opponent's high-cross body, to emphasize the wrestler's strength. Fallaway moonsault slam This moves shows the wrestler grab an opponent like a fallaway slam but instead of just throwing them backwards the wrestler while, hanging onto the opponent, does a backflip slamming the opponent back first into the mat while landing on top of them chest first. The attacker may also chose maintain their hold on the opponent after the landing in an attempt to score a pinfall. This move was innovated by Scott Steiner and is currently used by Cameron Grimes primarily as a counter to a charging opponent performing a running crossbody. This move requires a great deal of lower body strength and agility to perform as it can be dangerous to the wrestler performing the backflip as he/she can land head first and risk serious injury from failing to rotate properly. Fireman's carry throws A fireman's carry involves the wrestler holding the opponent in place over both shoulders. From this position, various throws can be performed. Airplane spin A wrestler lifts the opponent on to their shoulders and spins around and around until they get dizzy and crash to the ground. This move has been made famous notably by WWE Hall of Famer Gorilla Monsoon. Death Valley driver Derek Wylde executing a Death Valley driver which will put Scotty O'Shea (in green) through a table. Also known as the Death Valley Bomb in Japan, this move is performed from a fireman's carry. The wrestler throws the opponent off their shoulders and falls in the direction that the opponent's head is facing, driving the opponent's head or back into the mat. Similar to the fireman's carry takeover, with more of an emphasis on targeting the neck. The Death Valley driver was innovated by Louie Spicolli (although he credited Etsuko Mita as the DVD originator). =Inverted Death Valley driver= Also known as the Victoria Driver or Burning Hammer, this move is executed from an Argentine backbreaker rack position. The wrestler then falls sideways, driving the opponent's head to the mat. This is considered an extremely dangerous move, as the opponent's body cannot roll with the natural momentum of the move to absorb the impact. In a cut-throat variation of this driver, instead of holding the body of the opponent, a wrestler holds the far arm of the opponent across the opponent's own throat and maintains it by holding the opponent's wrist before performing the inverted Death Valley driver. The Inverted Death Valley Driver was innovated by Kotetsu Yamamoto in the 1970s but popularized by Kenta Kobashi as the Burning Hammer. Michael Elgin uses a sit-down variation of the burning hammer so not to hurt the head or neck of his opponent allowing them to roll left or right, while Tyler Reks' Burning Hammer saw him flip the opponent onto their stomach before impact (as in an inverted Attitude Adjustment). The move is generally forbidden in WWE, but made a surprise appearance in the WWE Cruiserweight Classic when Brian Kendrick performed the Burning Hammer on Kota Ibushi. =Side Death Valley driver= A variation between the regular Death Valley driver and the inverted one. The opponent lies on their side on the shoulders of the wrestler, facing either the opposite or the same direction as the wrestler, with the wrestler holding the opponent by the lower leg and either the head or lower arm. The wrestler then falls sideways, driving the opponent down to the mat shoulder and neck first. Cesaro used this move a few times and now uses it as his signature move, named the Swissblade. Fireman's carry drop The attacking wrestler first lifts their opponent over their shoulders in a fireman's carry position. The attacking wrestler then pushes the opponent forward and off their body, slamming the opponent face-down onto the mat. The wrestler may land in a kneeling or squatting position. This move was used by Mojo Rawley. Fireman's carry Emerald Flowsion The wrestler performs the fireman's carry from a standing position, then swings the opponent around and drops them into a Emerald Flowsion. The move is used by Hiromu Takahashi as the Dynamite Plunger. Fireman's carry headlock Elbow Drop The wrestler performs the fireman's carry from a standing position, then tosses the opponent off their shoulders and drops the opponent into a Headlock Elbow Drop. It is currently used by Hirooki Goto as the GTW. Fireman's carry slam Wade Barrett preparing to perform a fireman's carry slam (Wasteland) on Randy Orton The wrestler first drapes an opponent over their shoulders in a fireman's carry position. The wrestler then takes hold of the thigh and arm of the opponent, which are hung over the front side of the wrestler, and leans forward, pulling the opponent over their head and shoulders, slamming them down on their back in front of the wrestler. A rolling fireman's carry slam is a variation that sees the wrestler keep hold of the opponent and run forward before slamming the opponent to the ground, using the momentum to roll over the opponent. A swinging leghook fireman's carry slam is another variation that involves a wrestler holding the wrist of the opponent while putting their head under the opponent's chest. Then after grabbing the opponents nearest leg, the wrestler lifts the opponent's leg outward before swinging forward using the opponent's momentum and slamming them down back-first. A neckbreaker variation also exists where the wrestler lifts the opponent on their shoulders in a fireman's carry, then lifts their opponent over and grabs the head before slamming them down in a neckbreaker slam. Bobby Roode used the neckbreaker version as a finisher, which he calls Roode Bomb. Fireman's carry takeover John Cena performs an Attitude Adjustment (standing fireman's carry powerslam) on Kane. There are two versions of the fireman's carry takeover used in professional wrestling. The first is borrowed from amateur wrestling and sees the wrestler kneel down on one knee and simultaneously grab hold of one the opponent's thighs with one arm and one of the opponent's arms with their other arm. The wrestler then pulls the opponent onto their shoulders and rises up slightly, using the motion to push the opponent off their shoulders, flipping them to the mat onto their back. The other closely resembles a Death Valley driver. The wrestler performs the fireman's carry from a standing position, then tosses the opponent off their shoulders as they drop down to their knees, causing the opponent to land on their back. The standing variant is a higher impact version of the move because the wrestler falls from a greater height, and is a move closely associated with John Cena through his use of it as his finishing maneuver, which he calls the Attitude Adjustment. Another variation sees the move done from the top or middle rope, used occasionally by Cena as the Super Attitude Adjustment. Olympic slam The wrestler holds the opponent's wrist while putting their head underneath the opponent's chest, grabs the inside of one of the opponents legs, then lifts the opponent up onto their shoulders while falling backwards. This move was popularized by and named in reference to Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle, who also dubbed it the Angle Slam as an alternate name.WWE: The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man in Sports Entertainment (Amazon DVD Link) - Triple Threat Match featuring The Undertaker, The Rock, and Kurt Angle for the WWE Undisputed Championship Samoan drop Jillian Hall setting up to perform the Samoan drop on Xandra Bale. The wrestler drapes an opponent over their shoulders in a fireman's carry position then falls backwards, driving the opponent down to the mat on their back. A one-handed, swinging leg hook, and a twisting version are also possible. This move is most often performed by wrestlers of Samoan heritage (typically from the Anoa'i family, including The Rock, Rikishi, Umaga, and Roman Reigns (who uses the one-handed variant), as well as a pop-up version used by Nia Jax and The Usos. A top rope variant was also regularly performed by Scott Steiner, while Ronda Rousey uses the twisting version as a finisher, calling it Piper's Pit. Alley oop Also known as a reverse powerbomb or a fallaway powerbomb. The wrestler lifts their opponent so that they are seated on the wrestler's shoulders, facing away from them, as in a powerbomb. The wrestler then falls backwards while throwing the opponent the same way, dropping them down to the mat on their chest. Another version sees the wrestler pick the opponent up on to their shoulders in a powerbomb position and dropping backwards while throwing the opponent so that the opponent flips forward and lands on their neck and upper back. A bridging variant is also available. =Package fallaway powerbomb= This variation of the alley oop sees the wrestler lifting the opponent so that they are seated on the attacking wrestler's shoulders as in a powerbomb. The wrestler then grabs the opponent's head and forces them into a \\"package\\" position. From there the wrestler falls backwards, throwing the opponent over their head, forcing them to land on their upper back and neck. A bridging variation is also possible. This move is used by Dragon Lee, Kota Ibushi (both are calling it the Phoenix- Plex) and it was formerly used by Kevin Steen. Double leg flapjack Just like a normal flapjack, however, this sees the wrestler reaching both the opponent's legs rather than one. From this point, the wrestler lifts the opponent up while holding them from both legs, and then falls backwards, throwing the opponent face-first into the mat. The double flapjack is usually used when associating with tag-teams to perform a death drop. Hotshot A hotshot is referred to when a flapjack is performed so that the opponent falls across the ring ropes. Innovated by \\"Hot Stuff\\" Eddie Gilbert. It was used Stone Cold Steve Austin as the Gun Stun in his WCW career. Pop-up Also called a \\"free-fall\\" or \\"push-up flapjack\\". A pop-up is a flapjack where the attacker, upon facing an opponent rushing towards them, flings the opponent vertically up into the air without holding on to the opponent. The standing attacker or the airborne opponent is free to carry out an attack after the pop-up. Examples of attacks from the standing wrestler include performing a European uppercut to the falling opponent, or catching the opponent and then performing a sitout powerbomb. Examples of attacks from the airborne opponent include executing a dropkick on the standing opponent. Tag teams may also utilize the pop-up by throwing an opponent to a teammate who would execute an attack. Full nelson Mason Ryan performing a full nelson slam on Curt Hawkins Full nelson slam In this move, the attacker places their opponent in a full nelson hold and uses it to lift them off the ground. With the opponent in the air, the attacker removes one arm (so their opponent is now in a half nelson) and slams the opponent back-first into the mat. Another similar variation, known as a double chickenwing slam, sees the wrestler apply double chickenwing instead of a full nelson before slamming the opponent. Damien Sandow used the full nelson version =Inverted full nelson slam= Also known as the reverse full nelson slam, this variation sees the attacker tuck and slide their arms under the opponent's armpits and then clutch the opponent's lower jaw. Then, the attacker lifts the opponent before falling forward to slam the opponent back-first into the mat. Half nelson slam The wrestler stands behind, slightly to one side of and facing the opponent. The wrestler reaches under one of the opponent's arms with their corresponding arm and places the palm of their hand on the back of the opponent's neck, thereby forcing the arm of the opponent up into the air to complete the half nelson. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up, turns, and falls forward, slamming the opponent back-first into the mat. Giant swing Cesaro performing the Cesaro Swing (giant swing) on Sin Cara A giant swing starts with an opponent lying on the mat, face up, and the wrestler at the opponent's feet. The wrestler takes the opponent's legs up under their arms, similar to the setup for a catapult, but instead pivots, spinning around to lift the opponent off the mat. The attacker may release the opponent to send them flying, or simply slow until the back of the opponent returns to the ground. WWE's Cesaro uses the giant swing as a signature move. Guillotine drop This move sees the attacking wrestler lift the opponent in a standing guillotine choke and drop the opponent to the mat, lower spine first. This causes an effect to the whole spine and neck. A variation involving a standing double underhook rather than the guillotine choke also exists. It is used by Angel Garza as the Wing Clipper. Gorilla press Also known as a Military press, the attack sees the wrestler lift their opponent up above their head with an overhead press as used in weight lifting. The attacking wrestler may repeatedly press the opponent overhead to show their strength prior to dropping them. Gorilla press drop The wrestler lifts their opponent up over their head with arms fully extended, then drops the opponent down face- first in front or back. This was the finisher for wrestlers Chyna and the Ultimate Warrior. It is a popular technique for very large wrestlers because it emphasizes their height and power. Gorilla press gutbuster A maneuver in which the user drops the opponent directly in front of them while putting their own knee out in front of them. The victim lands stomach or ribs first on the knee, made more impactful by the long drop. Gorilla press slam This slam sees a wrestler first lift their opponent up over their head with arms fully extended, before lowering the arm under the head of the opponent so that the opponent falls to that side, while flipping over and landing on their back. This move is also called the military press slam. Gorilla press spinebuster A gorilla press in which the user drops the opponent and turns them 90 degrees, dropping then onto their shoulder facing the opposite direction to the attacker, before being driven to the ground in a spinebuster maneuver. Goldberg used the move as a signature. Gutbuster A gutbuster is any move in which the wrestler lifts their opponent up and jumps or drops him/her so that the opponent's stomach impacts against part of the wrestler's body, usually the knee. A basic gutbuster is often called a stomach breaker and is essentially the same as a backbreaker but with the opponent facing the opposite direction. This similarity with backbreakers is reflected in almost every gutbuster variation, which if inverted would become backbreakers and vice versa. Elevated gutbuster Roderick Strong in the last moments of executing an elevated gutbuster on Davey Richards. This was transitioned from a fireman's carry, a common version of the gutbuster. This variation of a gutbuster sees an opponent first elevated into a high lifting transition hold before being dropped down for a gutbuster. Taiji Ishimori uses a Single underhook version of the move as his finisher calling it the Bloody Cross. =Fireman's carry gutbuster= This is the most common version of the elevated gutbuster and sees the attacking wrestler first lift the opponent up across their shoulders; a position known as a fireman's carry, before then dropping down to one knee while simultaneously elevating the opponent over their head forcing them to drop down and impact their exposed knee. Former WWE Superstar Kaitlyn uses this as one of her signature move. A slight variation of this uses a modified double knee gutbuster and sees the attacking wrestler drop down to their back while bringing both knees up for the opponent to land on. Darren Young used the move as his finisher calling it Gutcheck. WNA wrestler Kyle Mckayal uses a jumping version of it as his second hand finisher calling it The Project Mckayal. =Tombstone Gutbuster= The Wrestler puts their opponents into a Tombstone Piledriver position,but instead of delivering the Piledriver, the wrestler drops their opponents into a Gutbuster. Popularized by Taiji Ishimori. =Gutbuster drop= An elevated gutbuster in which an attacking wrestler would lift an opponent up, stomach-first, across one of their shoulders before dropping down to their knees forcing the opponent's stomach to impact on the wrestler's shoulder. Rib breaker A rib breaker is a version of a gutbuster that involves the wrestler scooping the opponent up by reaching between the legs of the opponent with one arm and reaching around their back from the same side with their other arm. The wrestler then lifts their opponent up so they are horizontal across the wrestler's body. From here the wrestler drops down to one knee, forcing the opponent to drop stomach/rib-first against the wrestler's raised knee. Headlock takedown Also known as a spinning headlock takedown. This throw starts with the wrestler catching the opponent in a side headlock. The wrestler turns and twists their body so their back is horizontally against the opponent's torso. The wrestler turns to one side (depending on which hand is used to catch the opponent) while still catching the opponent with the headlock. Therefore, the opponent is slammed back-first into the mat after being almost \\"forcibly flipped\\" over the wrestler's back (as the wrestler turns to their sides). Headlock driver Dean Ambrose setting up his finisher Dirty Deeds (headlock driver) on The Miz. Similar to the snapmare driver, the wrestler applies a side headlock before dropping down on either their chest or their knees and driving the opponent's head down to the mat forehead first, with the side headlock. This was the original version of the finisher used by Dean Ambrose, known as Dirty Deeds. Ethan Carter III (EC3) uses this as his finisher and he calls it the One Percenter. Headscissors takedown Flying Scissors to the neck, executed during the 2004 \\"Gio-To- Festival\\" in Minden, Germany. The move is performed with the wrestler's legs scissored around the opponent's head, dragging the opponent into a forced forward somersault as the wrestler falls to the mat. It is often erroneously called the Hurricanrana in American wrestling, but due to the lack of a double leg cradle pinning combination, it is a standard headscissors takedown. Handstand headscissors takedown This move is performed when the attacking wrestler, in a handstand position, scissors their legs around the opponent's head and follows with the headscissors takedown. There are multiple variations of the handstand headscissors takedown. For example, in one variation, the attacking wrestler rolls forward after scissoring their legs around their opponent's head; in another, the opponent rolls backwards into a handstand position to follow with a headscissors and the takedown. It is commonly used by Kalisto and Cedric Alexander. This move was also popularized by Trish Stratus, who used it as a signature move, called the Stratusphere. Tilt-a-whirl headscissors takedown This move is actually a counter. Usually, the opponent grabs the attacking wrestler (as if he were performing a sidewalk slam), the attacking counters and swings their body upwards, then scissors their legs around the opponent's head, spins around the opponent's body, and swings their legs downwards, resulting in the headscissors takedown. Hurricanrana Though it is commonly referred to as a Hurricanrana, the original Spanish name for this maneuver is the Hurac√°nrana. The name was taken from its innovator, Mexican luchador Hurac√°n Ram√≠rez. Sometimes referred to as a reverse victory roll, it is a headscissors takedown that ends in a double leg cradle pinning hold.Von Erich, Erick. \\"World Class Championship Wrestling - November 28, 1986\\". DaWrestlingSite.com. Retrieved July 25, 2017. (A rana is any double-leg cradle.) A somersault version also exists, called the Dragonrana. =Frankensteiner= This move is derived from the original hurricanrana. It is described as a head scissors take down that is performed against a running opponent. The wrestler jumps on the shoulders of the charging opponent and performs a back flip. The move varies from the hurricanrana as when the opponent lands - he/she would land on their head as opposed to their back. It was named the \\"Frankensteiner\\" by Scott Steiner, who used it as a finishing move. The move also has a variation where the opponent is sitting on the top rope, that variation is also referred to as frankensteiner. Another variation of the Frankensteiner sees a grounded wrestler first \\"kip-up\\" on to a standing opponent's shoulders, this is where a wrestler rolls on to the back of their shoulders bringing their legs up and kicking forward to build momentum to lift themselves off the floor and on to the standing opponent. Reverse frankensteiner Also known as an inverted frankensteiner or a poison rana, this move uses a standard Frankensteiner, but instead of performing the move facing the opponent's face, it is done facing the back of the opponent. =Hurricanrana driver= The wrestler performs a headscissors takedown to a seated or kneeling opponent, driving them head first into the mat. Ruby Riott and Kalisto use this move in some of their matches. =Rope-aided hurricanrana= Mickie James performing an rope-aided hurricanrana on Katie Lea Burchill This maneuver is also known as swinging hurricanrana. The attacking wrestler, beginning on the corner, uses the top ropes for leverage to scissor their legs around the opponent (usually an oncoming opponent) and swings to perform the hurricanrana. This hurricanrana variation was popularized by Mickie James, as she named the move herself Mick-a-rana. Hip toss The wrestler stands next to the opponent with both facing the same direction, and the wrestler hooks their closest arm underneath and behind the opponent's closest armpit. The wrestler then quickly lifts the opponent up with that arm and throws them forward, which would lead the wrestler to flip the opponent on to their back to end the move. There is also a sitout variation, in which the wrestler performs a normal hip toss and then lands in a seated position. Iconoclasm This top rope flipping slam sees a wrestler stand under an opponent, who is situated on the top turnbuckle, turn their back to this opponent while taking hold of the opponent's arms from below, often holding underneath the opponent's arm pits. The wrestler would then throw the opponent forward while falling to a seated position, flipping the opponent over in midair, and slamming them down to the mat back first. Irish whip Gene Snitsky Irish whips Brian Kendrick to the turnbuckle. Also called a hammer throw. A move in which the wrestler grabs one of their opponent's arms and spins, swinging the opponent into an obstacle such as the ring ropes, a turnbuckle, or the stairs leading into the ring. An Irish whip into the ring ropes is usually used to set the opponent up for another technique as he/she bounces off. An Irish whip into the turnbuckles usually sees the opponent remain in the corner, allowing a follow-up attack from the wrestler; the opponent may remain standing or slump to the ground, usually in a seated position, which will vary the attack. One occasional use of the Irish whip is to try to \\"hit for the cycle\\" by whipping one's opponent into each corner in turn. Some professional wrestlers can use this move as an advantage by running up the turnbuckle and using a high flying move. The move acquired its name due to its association with Irish wrestler, Danno O'Mahony. Jawbreaker A jawbreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams their opponent's jaw against a part of the wrestler's body, usually their knee, head or shoulder. Shoulder jawbreaker Also known as an inverted stunner, the wrestler stands facing the opponent, places their shoulder under the jaw of the opponent and holds the opponent in place before falling into a sitting or kneeling position, driving the jaw of the opponent into their shoulder. Sitout jawbreaker A standard jawbreaker is seen when a wrestler (either stands facing or not facing opponent) places their head under the jaw of the opponent and holds the opponent in place before falling into a sitting or kneeling position, driving the jaw of the opponent into the top of their head. Sometimes it is also used to counter a headlock by the opponent. Stunner A stunner is a three-quarter facelock jawbreaker. It involves an attacking wrestler applying a three-quarter facelock (reaching behind the head of an opponent, thus pulling the opponent's jaw above the wrestler's shoulder) before falling to a seated position and forcing the defender's jaw to drop down on the shoulder of the attacking wrestler. This move was innovated by Mikey Whipwreck and popularized by Stone Cold Steve Austin. Mat slam A mat slam is any move in which the wrestler forces the back of the opponent's head into the mat which does not involve a headlock or facelock. If these are used then the move is considered a type of DDT (if the wrestler falls backwards) or bulldog. Some neckbreakers also slam the back of the opponent's head into the mat, but the attacker is back-to-back with the attack's receiver. A standard mat slam involves the wrestler grabbing hold of the opponent by their head or hair and pulling back, forcing the back of the opponent's head into the mat. Belly-to-back inverted mat slam Styles Clash on Matt Hardy. Styles performing the Styles Clash on Matt Hardy. From a position in which the opponent is bent forward against the wrestler's midsection, the wrestler grabs around his or her opponent's midsection and lifts so that the opponent is held upside down, facing in the same direction as the wrestler. The wrestler then hooks both arms of the opponent using his or her legs, and then falls forward planting the opponent's body into the mat face-first. The move often sees the wrestler keep their legs hooked under the arms of the opponent after hitting the move, using the underhooking technique to turn the opponent on to their back into a Rana style pinning position. This move was innovated by Col. DeBeers and was made famous by A.J. Styles, who refers to the move as the Styles Clash. Styles performs the maneuver with a variation, as seen in the photos to the right: he does not hook the opponent's arms before performing the slam, but takes two steps and moves his legs in front of the opponent's arms enabling him to use his legs to cover the shoulders for a pin. This variant is later utilized by former WWE Diva Michelle McCool, who referred to the move as the Faith Breaker. Cesaro uses a variation called the Neutralizer where he grapevines the opponents leg with his arm similar to a cradle piledriver. El Phantasmo uses a cross-arm Variation called ELP,where he lifts his opponent up and he lets him fall face first into the mat. Double underhook mat slam The wrestler faces an opponent, overhooks both arms, and then pivots 180¬∞ so that the opponent is facing upwards with his or her head pressed against the upper back or under an arm of the wrestler. The wrestler then drops down to their back, driving the back of the opponent's head and neck into the mat. Rear mat slam As well known as a falling rear mat slam. This move starts with the wrestler standing behind the opponent, and then takes hold of the front of the neck or head, and then falls onto his stomach, driving the opponent's back of the head into the mat first. Another variation of this move sees the wrestler performing a backflip from the top turnbuckle, and as he floats over the opponent, he quickly grabs the opponent's head or neck with both hands and falls on his stomach to complete the rear mat slam. =Sitout rear mat slam= The wrestler takes hold of their opponent from behind, holding them by either their hair or head. The wrestler then jumps backwards and falls to a sitting position, driving the back of the opponent's head into the ground between their legs. This was a signature move for Edge, which he called Edge-O-Matic. A variation sees the wrestler run up the corner turnbuckles, perform a backflip over a chasing opponent, and at the same time grab hold of the opponents head and perform the slam. Sleeper slam This slamming version of a headlock takedown sees a wrestler apply a sleeper hold to the opponent, then falls face first to the ground, pulling the opponent down with them and driving the back and head of the opponent into the ground. Heath uses a jumping variation of the move. A lifting version also exists, where a wrestler applies a sleeper hold to the opponent, lifts the opponent up and slams the opponent into the ground Sling Blade A spinning sit-out variation of a sleeper slam that makes use of the wrestler's own momentum. The attacking wrestler starts by running and extending his arm like a lariat takedown but instead performs a revolution around the opponent's shoulders. This causes the wrestler to switch to his opposite arm before taking his opponent down to the mat while simultaneously landing in a seated position. Another variation involves the wrestler leaping off the ropes before performing the movement. The move is used by Hiroshi Tanahashi, with some commentators even calling the move a 'Tanahashi' when anybody performs it due to how associated it is with him. Other users include Pentagon Jr., JTG, Seth Rollins, Masato Yoshino and Finn B√°lor, with JTG calling it Da Shout Out. Tilt-a-whirl mat slam As the name suggests the wrestler would first use a tilt-a-whirl to raise the opponent into a belly-to- belly (piledriver) position, from here the wrestler would fall forward planting the opponent into the mat back-first. Monkey flip This move, often referred to as a monkey climb in British wrestling, involves an attacking wrestler, who is standing face-to-face with an opponent, hooking both hands around the opponent's head before then bringing up both legs so that they place their feet on the hips/waist of the opponent, making the head hold and the wrestlers' sense of balance the only things allowing both wrestlers to be in an upright position. At this point, the attacking wrestler shifts their weight so that they fall backwards to the mat while forcing the opponent to fall forwards with them, only to have the attacking wrestler push up with their legs, forcing the opponent to flip forward, over the wrestler's head and onto their back. This move is most commonly performed out of a ring corner. This is due to it being easier to climb on an opponent while in the corner as balance is easily retained, and it allows the maximum length of ring to propel the opponent across. Muscle buster Cody Rhodes performing a Muscle Buster on Seth Rollins. This move is performed when an attacking wrestler hooks both an opponent's legs with their arms and tucks their head in next to the opponent's before standing and lifting the opponent up, so that they are upside down with their head resting on the attacking wrestler's shoulder. From this position, the attacking wrestler jumps up and drops down to the mat, driving the opponent shoulder first down to the mat with the opponent's neck impacting both the wrestler's shoulder and the mat. This can see the wrestler pick up an opponent who is standing but bent forward, but it often begins with an opponent who is sitting on an elevated position, usually on a top turnbuckle, because it is easier to hook and lift an opponent when they are positioned higher than the wrestler. The move also has a neckbreaker variation, which focuses more of the attack on the opponent's neck. This move originated from the Kinnikuman manga, originally known as the Kinniku Buster (kinniku being Japanese for \\"muscle\\"), with the move ending with the opponent crashing down on their neck against the attacking wrestler's shoulder. Samoa Joe used this as one of his finishers (he uses an electric chair version falling backwards, sparing the opponent's neck) until 2015 when he accidentally injured Tyson Kidd, which ended his wrestling career and almost paralyzed him, while Ryback uses a different variation as his finisher, called Shell Shocked, where he lifts the opponent into position with a fisherman's suplex and only hooks one of the opponent's legs before running forward and dropping them off his shoulders, in a Samoan drop-esque motion. Neckbreaker There are two general categories of neckbreaker, which are related only in that they attack the opponent's neck. One category of neckbreaker is the type of move in which the wrestler slams their opponent's neck against a part of the wrestler's body, usually their knee, head or shoulder. A neckbreaker slam is another technique in which the wrestler throws their opponent to the ground by twisting the opponent's neck. Piledriver Whilst giving the illusions of slamming the opponent's head into the ground, a properly executed standard piledriver has the opponent's head barely touching the ground, if at all. The technique is said to have been innovated by Wild Bill Longson. Powerbomb A powerbomb is a move in which an opponent is lifted into the air and then slammed down back-first to the mat. The standard powerbomb sees the opponent placed in a standing headscissors position (bent forward with their head placed between the wrestler's thighs), lifted on the wrestler's shoulders, and slammed back-first down to the mat. The move was innovated by Lou Thesz. This move was used as a finisher for wrestlers such as Batista, The Undertaker, Kevin Nash, Chyna, JBL, among others. Powerslam A powerslam is any slam in which the wrestler performing the technique falls face-down on top of their opponent. The use of the term \\"powerslam\\" usually refers to the front powerslam and the scoop powerslam. Pumphandle=Pumphandle drop Also known as a tilt slam or a pumphandle falling powerslam, the wrestler stands behind their opponent and bends them forward. One of the opponent's arms is pulled back between their legs and held, while the other arm is hooked. The wrestler then lifts their opponent up until they are parallel with the wrestler's chest, then throws themselves forward, driving the back of the opponent into the ground with the weight of the wrestler atop them. Pumphandle fallaway slam The wrestler hooks up the opponent as a pumphandle slam, then the wrestler goes through the body movements for the fallaway slam, executing the release of the opponent as they enter the apex of the throw, instead of at or just past the apex of the throw like when one executes the fallaway slam. Usually the opponent then adds effort to gain extra rotations in the air for effect or to ensure that they do not take the bump on their side. Pumphandle slam The wrestler stands behind their opponent and bends them forward. One of the opponent's arms is pulled back between their legs and held, while the other arm is hooked (pumphandle). The attacking wrestler uses the hold to lift the opponent up over their shoulder, while over the shoulder the attacking wrestler would fall forward to slam the opponent against the mat back-first, normally the type of powerslam delivered is a front powerslam. The move can also see other variations of a powerslam used, particularly into a sidewalk slam position. Ben Davis and Titus Carell use the pumphandle slam as finishers, Davis uses a implant slam calling it The Plantation Punk Slam while Carell uses a spinning slam calling it Spinerella Slam. =Sitout pumphandle slam= The wrestler lifts the opponent as with a pumphandle slam, but falls to a sitting position and drops the opponent between their legs as with a michinoku driver II. Scoop=Body slam A body slam is any move in which a wrestler picks up and throws an opponent down to the ground limp back-first. When used by itself, this term generally refers to a very basic variant for a scoop slam. Scoop slam Ivory setting up to perform a scoop slam on Trish Stratus Facing their opponent, the wrestler reaches between their opponent's legs with their stronger arm and reaches around their back from the same side with their weaker arm. The wrestler lifts their opponent up and turns them upside down so that they are held up by the wrestler's arm cradling their back. The wrestler then throws the opponent to the ground so that they land on their back. The opponent will often assist the slammer by placing their arm on the slammer's thigh. Shin breaker The wrestler faces the opponent from the side, slightly behind, then tucks their head under the opponent's near armpit and grabs hold of the opponent's near leg, bending it fully. The wrestler then lifts the opponent up and slams them downwards, driving one of the wrestler's knees into the opponent's bent leg. This move is used to weaken the leg for a submission manoeuvre. Shoulderbreaker A shoulderbreaker is any move in which the wrestler slams their opponent's shoulder against any part of the wrestler's body, usually the shin or knee. This move is normally used to weaken the arm for a submission maneuver or to make it more difficult for the opponent to kick out of a possible pinfall attempt. The most common version sees the wrestler turn the opponent upside-down and drop the opponent shoulder-first on the wrestler's knee. Usually the opponent is held over the wrestler's shoulder in either a powerslam position, or less commonly an inverted powerslam position for what is sometimes called the inverted shoulderbreaker. Snake eyes This move sees the standing wrestler place the opponent stomach down on their shoulder so that they both are facing the same direction. The attacking wrestler then drops the opponent face-first into the turnbuckle or ropes. This move is most commonly used by The Undertaker. Johnny Gargano uses a variation called Lawn Dart, where he throws the opponent face first onto the second turnbuckle. Snapmare With the wrestler's back to the opponent, he/she applies a three-quarter facelock (also known as a cravate), and either kneeling down or bending over pulls the opponent forward, flipping them over their shoulder down to the mat, back first. Another variation, sometimes called a \\"flying mare\\", sees the wrestler pull the opponent by the hair over their shoulder before slamming them to the mat. Rolling snapmare This variation of the snapmare sees the application of the facelock with the takeover to the opponent, but rather than the wrestler remaining stationary, he rolls with the opponent's momentum. Snapmare driver A high impact variation of the snapmare where instead of flipping the opponent over, the wrestler drops down either on their chest or down on their knees and drives the opponent's head down to the mat forehead first, with the three-quarter facelock much like a cutter. An inverted variation of this move also exists. However, the wrestler holds their opponent's head in a back to back position, before performing the move. Adam Rose used this as the Party Foul. Melina used this move after her return in 2010, most notably to win her second Diva's championship at SummerSlam 2010. Snapmare neckbreaker A high impact combination of the snapmare and the falling neckbreaker. With the wrestler's back to the opponent, he/she applies a three- quarter facelock and then pulls the opponent forward, flipping them over their shoulder, before turning to land in a neckbreaker. Was briefly used as a signature by Tyson Kidd. Spinebuster The wrestler starts by facing their opponent and then grabs them around their waist, lifts them up, and then either slams the opponent down while landing on top of them, or tosses them forward on to their back. Although it can be used on a stationary opponent, it is usually performed against a charging opponent, using the opponent's own momentum to make the throw more powerful.  Double leg slam  alt= Also called the Alabama Slam. This variation of the spinebuster starts with the wrestler facing his opponent. The wrestler catches and grabs the opponent from either his waist or both legs, and lifts the opponent so he would either face the mat while being vertically elevated off the mat (with both his legs grabbed over the wrestler's shoulders) or literally facing the wrestler's back while being lifted upside down with the wrestler still taking hold of both the opponent's legs (back-to-belly position). The wrestler then tosses the opponent overhead by throwing both the opponent's legs forward, slamming the opponent back-first. A sitout or inverted version is also possible. This move was popularized by Hardcore Holly and named after his fictional hometowns of Talladega and later Mobile, Alabama. Sitout spinebuster Titus O'Neil executing the Clash of the Titus (Sitout spinebuster) on Heath Slater The wrestler starts by facing his opponent. He then grabs the opponent around the waist or under the arms, lifts him up, and tosses him forward on to his back or slams him down while dropping to a seated position. The wrestler hangs on to the opponents legs for a pin-fall attempt. This move is used as a finisher by Titus O'Neil who calls it the Clash of the Titus. A slight variation is the sitout side slam spinebuster where the opponent is lifted like a side slam but dropped into a sitout spinebuster. Spinning spinebuster This version of the spinebuster sees the wrestler lifting the opponent, turning 180¬∞, and then slam him or her forward on to his or her back or slam him or her down while landing on top of him or her. It is usually performed against a charging opponent, using the opponent's own momentum to make the throw more powerful, but can also be performed against a stationary opponent. Innovated and popularized by Arn Anderson, this version is also known as a Double A Spinebuster in tribute to Anderson. Thrust spinebuster This variation of the spinebuster sees the wrestler lift the opponent by their waist as in the standard version, but then place their dominant hand onto the opponent's chest in order to slam them, similarly to a chokeslam. There is also a variation of this move in which the wrestler stands besides his or her opponent, grabs their waist as in a side slam, and then hooks the opponent's leg with his or her free arm before lifting and slamming the opponent. The release variation was popularized by Ron Simmons. Suplex A suplex is the same as the amateur suplex, a throw which involves arching/bridging either overhead or twisting to the side, so the opponent is slammed to the mat back-first. Though there are many variations, the term suplex (without qualifiers) can also refer specifically to the vertical suplex. Trips and sweeps=Armbar legsweep The wrestler stands beside their opponent to either side, crosses their arm against the opponent's opposite hand in front of it (as the wrestler stands beside the opponent, and uses for example their right arm, they would cross it against the opponent's left arm, and vice versa). From this point, the wrestler places their leg in front of the opponent's opposite leg, and falls backwards, causing the opponent's arm to be slammed into the mat. Cobra clutch legsweep The wrestler places his opponent in the cobra clutch, then stands to one side of the opponent, hooks their nearest foot behind their opponent's nearest leg and throws themselves backwards, forcing their opponent backwards to the ground. Double leg takedown A tackle where the intention is to force the opponent down on their back by tackling them at their waist or upper thighs. This usually involves grabbing the opponent with both arms around the opponent's legs while keeping the chest close to the opponent, and using this position to force the opponent to the floor . Dragon screw legwhip Dragon screw legwhip (or simply Dragon screw) is a legwhip where a wrestler grabs an opponent's leg and holds it parallel to the mat while they are facing each other. The attacking wrestler then spins the leg inwards causing the opponent to fall off balance and twist in the air bringing them to the ground in a turning motion. It is used by the \\"Ace of the Universe\\" Hiroshi Tanahashi Drop toe-hold The wrestler falls to the ground, placing one foot at the front of the opponent's ankle and the other in the back of the calf. This causes the opponent to fall face first into the ground. It is sometimes used illegally to force an opponent into a chair or other elevated weapon; it is also used occasionally to force an opponent face-first into the turnbuckles, stunning them momentarily. Half nelson legsweep The wrestler stands behind, slightly to one side of and facing the opponent. The wrestler reaches under one of the opponent's arms with their corresponding arm and places the palm of their hand on the neck of the opponent, thereby forcing the arm of the opponent up into the air (the half nelson). The wrestler then uses their other arm to pull the opponent's other arm behind the opponent's head, so both opponent's arms are pinned. The wrestler then hooks the opponent's near leg and throws themselves backwards, driving the opponent back-first to the ground. Arm-Trap Cradle Somersault STO The wrestler faces the opponent, ducks under the opponent's arm closest to them, wraps their closest arm around the waist of the opponent and then quickly performs a forward flip whilst sweeping the opponent's leg, thereby dropping the opponent on their back, ending up in a cradle pin. This move was innovated by Madoka as Ranhei. It was also made popular by Kofi Kingston, who calls it the S.O.S. Russian legsweep Damien Sandow performing a Russian Legsweep on Rob Van Dam. Also known as a side Russian legsweep and called a neckbreaker by Gorilla Monsoon. This is a move in which a wrestler stands side-to-side and slightly behind with the opponent, facing in the same direction, and reaches behind the opponent's back to hook the opponent's head with the other hand extending the opponent's nearest arm, then while hooking the opponent's leg the wrestler falls backward, pulling the opponent to the mat back-first. There is also a jumping variation of the Russian legsweep, which is similar in execution to that of the leaping reverse STO and different modified versions of the move. =Forward Russian legsweep= The wrestler grabs the opponent by the arm and goes behind him while holding the arm and hooking the opponent's leg. The wrestler then bends the opponent's back and slams their face to the mat. The forward Russian legsweep was popularized by Jeff Jarrett, who began using the maneuver as a finisher in the late 1990s and calls it The Stroke. Full nelson forward Russian legsweep A slight variation of the forward Russian legsweep, the wrestler approaches the opponent from behind and places them in a full nelson before hooking their leg. The wrestler then falls forward in an almost identical way, slamming the opponent face-first into the mat. The most notable practitioner of this variant is The Miz, who calls the move the Skull Crushing Finale and has used it as a finisher since August 2009. =Three-quarter facelock Russian legsweep= The wrestler stands in front of, facing away from and slightly to one side of the opponent. The wrestler then reaches behind themselves and applies a three-quarter facelock to the opponent. The wrestler then hooks the opponent's near leg with their own near leg and sweeps the leg away, simultaneously throwing themselves backwards, thus driving the opponent to the ground (with the weight of the wrestler on top of them) and wrenching the opponent's neck. Schoolboy sweep This technique gives its name to the schoolboy bump and is performed when the wrestler gets behind their opponent, drops down to their knees, puts their hand through the opponent's legs, hooking the opponent's hips, and pulls backwards. This pulls the opponent backwards, with straightened and trapped legs, forcing the opponent to fall backwards, over the wrestler, flat on the floor. STO The STO (Space Tornado Ogawa) is a sweep in which a wrestler wraps one arm across the chest of their opponent and sweeps the opponent's leg with their own leg to slam the other wrestler back-first. This can also be a lariat-legsweep combination to slam down the opponent. This is also a move used often in Judo and in other grappling martial arts. This maneuver can be used running and standing. Innovated by Japanese silver medalist judoka Naoya Ogawa.Used by Evil as Evil. =Chokehold STO= Shelly Martinez executing the FTS (chokehold STO) on Alexia Nicole. This move is an STO where the wrestler would first apply a chokehold with one hand before sweeping their opponent's leg. Alexa Bliss uses this as a signature move, normally followed by her rope-assisted repeated stomps. =Front facelock STO= This variation of the STO sees the attacker apply a front facelock on his opponent and sweeping the opponent's leg and falling forward, with the opponent landing on his neck and shoulders. A pinning variation also exists where the attacker keeps the front facelock applied as he covers the opponent slightly. =Reverse STO= Well known as the Complete Shot or Flatliner, this is a move in which a wrestler stands side-to-side and slightly behind with the opponent, facing in the opposite direction, and reaches around the opponent's torso with one arm across the opponent's chest with their hand holding on to their other hand which is behind the opponent's head. The wrestler then falls backward, driving the opponent into the mat face-first. The wrestler can also cross their leg between the opponent's leg before hitting the reverse STO, with this slight variation being known as a leg hook reverse STO.It was innovated by Gedo. Arm trap reverse STO This move sees the wrestler stand side to side with the opponent, tucking his arm behind the opponent's head at a 90¬∞ angle and putting his near leg in front of the opponent's closest leg. The wrestler then pushes the opponent forward and quickly pulls them backward, with the attacker landing on their back whilst the opponent falls face first. Elevated reverse STO In this variation the wrestler first locks the opponent in a standard Reverse STO lock, then sees the opponent and put his ankles on some elevated surface (usually top rope, or turnbuckle, or barricade outside of the ring), the wrestler then falls backward, driving the opponent face-first into the mat. Another variation of this move including the opponent standing on the apron outside of the ring, and attacking wrestler first grabs opponent and pulls him over the top rope until opponent's ankles match the ropes, the attacking wrestler then falls backward, driving the opponent face- first into the mat. Tommaso Ciampa used this move at NXT TakeOver: Toronto in a match against Scott Dawson. Gory Special Swinging Reverse STO The wrestler locks a Back-to Back Backbreaker Submission in,better known as the Gory Special and drops the opponent into a Swinging Reverse STO. Popularized by Brian Cage as Weapon X. Leaping reverse STO A variation of the reverse STO, this move see the wrestler jumping up towards the side of an opponent and grabbing his head before falling backwards onto the mat, planting the opponent face-first. The move has been used by various professional wrestlers such as Mil Muertes (the Flatliner), Shelton Benjamin (the Paydirt), Montel Vontavious Porter (the Play of the Day/305) and R-Truth (Lil' Jimmy). Lifting reverse STO A slight variation of the reverse STO, this move sees a wrestler perform exactly the same set-up but instead of falling backward immediately, they lift the opponent before dropping them face-first into the mat, making it similar to a flapjack. It was innovated by Chris Kanyon. Baron Corbin's finisher is a variant of this move called the End of Days while Angelina Love uses the move as a signature (previously a finisher) called Lights Out. Another variation of this move involves using a pumphandle lift where the wrestler sets the opponent up for a pumphandle hold and then lifts them into the execution of the move. Pete Dunne uses this variation as a finisher previously calling it Drop Dead but now known as the Bitter End. Swinging reverse STO Another variation of the reverse STO, this move sees a wrestler grab their opponent around their neck and lean them backwards. The wrestler then swings their opponent around, slamming them face-first into the mat. Bray Wyatt uses this maneuver as his finisher, which he calls Sister Abigail. NJPW wrestler Switchblade Jay White uses a variation called Blade Runner. Knux, a Former WWE jobber, calls it The Knuxout.

The right hand holds a bu≈Çawa. ≈ªupan (; , , , , , ) is a long lined garment of Oriental origin which was worn by almost all males of the nobility in the multi-ethnic Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. It was a typical upper class male attire from the late 16th to the first half of the 18th century.  Derivation  The name ≈ºupan has other spelling variations‚Äîczupan (from czupkan, a Crimean Tatar word or alternatively from zuban or ziban‚Äîa Turkish word according to Julian Horoszkiewicz), and etymologically related to the Central Asian chapan. Alternatively, the name originates from the Italian word giuppa (gown) which in turn might have come from Arabic (jubba), although the garment itself probably is of Central Asian nomadic origin.Turnau I. (1994) European occupational dress from the fourteenth to the eighteenth century, translated by Izabela Szyma≈Ñska. Institute of the Archaeology and Ethnology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw. or from Middle English / Middle French jupon (an overcoat for armour). Whether the garment came from Central Asia or Ottoman Turkey or Iran still remains a question, and the same applies to the allied male garment‚Äîthe kontusz. The Central Asian origin of this garment may be also deduced from the method of closure of the pre-1680s zupans, for they were closed from right to left‚Äîtypical to Central Asian fashion, while the sleeve- ends terminated with dog-ears that were almost like gloves without covering the fingers, and were usually upturned to show the differently colored lining. Eventually an agraffe (clasp) or button was attached to this dog-ear sleeve- end to pin it to a sleeve once upturned and thus a cuff was created. This style of cuff was known in the Louis XIV period in France as the Polish cuff and might have led to the development of colorful military cuffs used in Western armies from 18th century onwards. cossack clerk wearing a blue ≈ºupan under a kontusz (1786) After the partition of Ukraine in 1663 (The Ruin), the inhabitants of Left Bank Ukraine continued to wear ≈ºupan, the name transliterated into , and also adopted the kontusz from their Right Bank counterparts as part of their dress, and therefore ≈ºupan was worn by Ukrainian nobility, wealthy merchants, cossacks, wealthier peasants and town dwellers as well as new Russian inhabitants - administrators, soldiers, and settlers. ≈ªupan, along with kontusz, was worn also in Russia, especially during the second half of the 17th century, when Polish male costume became popular at the Tsarish court.  Development  During the course of the 16th century the ≈ºupan was a popular male costume worn in lands ruled by the Polish Kingdom and Grand Duchy of Lithuania (after 1569 the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth). It was worn by males of all social classes, although the most expensive and colorful textiles were used only by the nobility szlachta while other social classes were restricted in color and richness of textiles due to legal restrictions and/or expense costs. The first mention of ≈ºupan appeared in 1393 but it was only gradually adopted as national male garment, first by nobility and later by other social classes, during the course of the 16th century. It was a long robe-like garment, always opened in the front, with long sleeves and a row of buttons (later very often decorative buttons called guzy) and since the 1570s, also a collar. This basic design did not change much but for the size and cut of the collar and type of fabric. Until the 1660s the collars were high, then gradually they became lower and with open, rounded corners. Also at first ≈ªupan served as outer garment made from sturdy cloth or wool and often lined with fur and worn with a belt from which, in the case of nobility, a sword was hung. It was worn underneath the typical outer garments like bekiesza, delia, ferezja, szuba and burka by nobility and wealthier people like merchants. Only gradually it became a lighter garment to be worn underneath the kontusz, while the belt became a colourful affair worn over the kontusz. In case of the poor nobility members and lower social classes it remained the outer garment until its demise, while wealthier burghers would use it as an inner garment along with kontusz and other outer garments in the fashion of nobility. In Polish military use the ≈ºupan served as the outer garment worn on its own by both cavalry and infantry. In the case of heavy cavalry (Polish hussars) and medium cavalry (pancerni) it was worn immediately beneath armour. There was also a padded version after the Central Asian traditions and it then might be called an arming coat, (there is an example of padded ≈ºupan in the Polish Army Museum). ≈ªupan was often used in its shorter cavalry version, known as the ≈ºupanik. After the 1680s, the ≈ºupan was typically worn beneath a kontusz and in such union those two garments became the typical attire for Ukrainian cossacks as well as the Polish national costume until the mid-19th century.  Construction and color  ≈ªupans were made of many fabrics as were available to the szlachta or the lower classes. Magnates generally wore ≈ºupans sporting golden or jewelled buttons, and tailored from the most expensive fabrics of their times such as the very expensive Persian fabric known as crimson, which won their wearers the name, karmazyni or \\"crimson men\\", then from various expensive silkbased fabrics like satins, brocades and damascs. Richer szlachta emulated the magnates with cheaper versions of silk-and-linen fabrics while the lower levels of szlachta usually wore ≈ºupans made out of cheaper white linen (summer) or duller in colour varieties of wool (winter), hence their nickname, szaraczkowie ‚Äî \\"grey men\\". Colors of ≈ªupan varied, however the lining was always of a different color than the outer fabric. Other social classes tried to emulate the szlachta. Poorer townsfolk often wore yellowish ≈ºupans made from hemp, which resulted in them being nicknamed ≈Çyczki. Polish Jews wore black ≈ºupans, and peasants wore simple, white (summer) and greyish (winter) ≈ºupans from wool or simple cloth. In 18th-century Poland, the ≈ºupan became even lighter, with long and narrow sleeves, while the unseen back was tailored from some inexpensive fabrics such as linen or cotton. It then assumed its final version (when worn with the kontusz and wide, colourful fabric belt) and survived into the 19th century as a part of the Polish \\"national dress\\" ‚Äî integral to regional male costumes, including those of peasants. Use of the ≈ºupan finally started to decline in the 19th century with the coming of the modern western male dress, but the holiday regional peasant costumes in Poland still have zupans as part of their attire. Currently, and for the last 20 years, many reenactment groups in Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania, and the USA have been reconstructing and wearing zupans during their shows and gatherings, e.g. Vivat Vasa, Choragiew Jakuba Wejhera or ChorƒÖgiew Husarska marsza≈Çka Woj.

It was mentioned for the first time in the 8th century. It was initially used by the South and West Slavs, denoting various territorial units of which the leader was the ≈æupan. In modern Bosnian, Croatian and Slovenian, the term ≈æupa also means an ecclesiastical parish, while term ≈æupanija is used in Bosnia and Croatia (in Bosnia also kanton as synonymous) for lower state organizational units. Etymology The word ≈æupa or ' (Serbian and Bulgarian: –∂—É–ø–∞; adopted into and rendered in Greek as Œ∂ŒøœÖœÄŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ± (, \\"land ruled by a ≈æupan\\")), is derived from Slavic. Its medieval Latin equivalent was '. It is mostly translated into \\"county\\" or \\"district\\". According to Kmietowicz, it seems that the territorial organization had been created in Polish territories before the Slav Migrations. Some Slavic nations changed its name into \\"opole\\", \\"okolina\\" and \\"vierw\\", but it has survived in ≈æupan. Some scholars consider the word's older meaning was \\"open area in the valley\\". This interpretation is confirmed by the Bulgarian ≈æupa (tomb), Polish zupa and Ukrainian ≈æupa (salt mine), and Old Slavonic ≈æupi≈°te (tomb). As such, the Proto-Slavic *≈æupa wouldn't derive from ' (with ' meaning \\"bend, distort\\"), yet from Indo- European ' meaning \\"cavity, pit\\", which derives from Nostratic *gopa meaning \\"hollow, empty\\". However, Albert Bruckner suggested the opposite evolution; ≈æupa as a back formation from title ≈æupan (for the etymology see corresponding article), which is a borrowing from Iranian languages (*fsu-pƒÅna, \\"shepherd\\"). Usage of the division The division had a widespread distribution, and did not always had a concrete institutional definition. The term ≈æupa signified the territorial and administrative unit of a tribe, and later only an administrative unit without tribal feature. The South Slavs that settled in Roman lands to a certain degree adopted Roman state organization, but retained their own tribal organization. Slavic tribes were divided into fraternities, each including a certain number of families. The territory inhabited by a tribe was a ≈æupa, and its leader was the ≈æupan. The zhupa (plural zhupi) was an administrative unit in the First Bulgarian Empire, a subdivision of a larger unit called comitatus. In these countries, the equivalent of \\"county\\" is \\"judet\\" (from Latin judicium). The Croats and the Slovaks used the terms ≈æupanija and ≈æupa for the counties in the Kingdom of Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary. German language translation of the word for those counties was komitat (from Latin comitatus, \\"countship\\") during the Middle Ages, but later it was gespanschaft (picking up the span root that previously came from ≈æupan). Bosnia Territorial-political organization in medieval Bosnia was intricate, and composed on several levels. In this scheme in the territorial- political organizational order of the medieval Bosnian state, ≈æupa or parish was basic unit of the state organization, with feudal estate at the bottom, followed by village municipality, both below ≈æupa, and county or zemlja above it, with the state monarch at the top. Croatia The Croatian word ≈æupa signifies both a secular unit (county) and a religious unit (parish), ruled over by a \\"≈æupan\\" (count) and \\"≈æupnik\\" (parish priest). Croatian medieval state was divided into eleven Œ∂ŒøœÖœÄŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ±œÇ (zoupanias; ≈æupas), and the ban ruled over additional three ≈æupas Krbava, Lika, and Gacka). Today the term ≈æupanija is the name for the Croatian regional government, the counties of Croatia. Mayors of counties hold the title of ≈æupan (pl. ≈æupani), which is usually translated as \\"county prefect\\". In the 19th century, the counties of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia were called ≈æupanija. The Croats preserved the term ≈æupa until the modern times as the name for local clerical units, parishes of the Catholic Church and of the Protestant churches. The parish priest is called ≈æupnik. Hungary In c. 1074, the ≈æupa is mentioned in Hungary as -sp√°n, also as hat√°risp√°ns√°gok (march, frontier county). The derivative titles were isp√°n, nominated by the king for not defined time, and gradually replaced by f≈ëisp√°n in the 18-19th century; megy√©sisp√°n, also nominated by the king but could be expelled anytime; alisp√°n was the leader of the jurisdiction in the county if the 'megy√©sisp√°n' was not available; v√°risp√°n was more linked to the \\"v√°r\\" (fortress) in Hungary in the times of √Årp√°d. Serbia The Serbs in the Early Middle Ages were organized into ≈æupe, a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local ≈æupan (a magistrate or governor). Thus the title of Grand ≈Ωupan in Ra≈°ka in 11th-12th century meant \\"supreme ≈æupan\\" of ≈æupans who ruled over ≈æupas. Du≈°an's Code (1349) named the administrative hierarchy as following: \\"lands, cities, ≈æupas and kraji≈°tes\\", the ≈æupas and kraji≈°tes were one and the same, with the ≈æupas on the borders were called kraji≈°tes (frontier).Radovanoviƒá 2002, p. 5 The ≈æupa consisted of villages, and their status, rights and obligations were regulated in the constitution. The ruling nobility possessed hereditary allodial estates, which were worked by dependent sebri, the equivalent of Greek paroikoi; peasants owing labour services, formally bound by decree.p. 290 Though the territorial unit today is unused, there are a number of traditional ≈æupe in Kosovo, around Prizren: Sredaƒçka ≈Ωupa, Siriniƒáka ≈Ωupa, Gora, Opolje and Prizrenski Podgor. The Serbian language maintains the word in toponyms, the best known being that of the ≈Ωupa Aleksandrovaƒçka. Slovakia The term ≈æupa was popularized in Slovak professional literature in the 19th century as a synonym to contemporary Slovak term stolica (county). After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, it was used as the official name of administrative units of Slovakia within Czechoslovakia in 1919 - 1928 and then again in the Slovak Republic during WWII in 1940‚Äì1945. Nowadays, the term is used semi-officially as a short alternative name for the self-governing regions of Slovakia. President of the self-governing region is semi-officially called ≈æupan. Slovenia During World War II, when Slovenia was partitioned between Italy, Hungary, and Germany on 17 April 1941, in the Italian portion, named province of Ljubljana, the new administration was led by an Italian High Commissioner, but there also were Presidents of the Council of Zhupans of Ljubljana: Marko Natlaƒçen (1941), Leon Rupnik (1942-1943).

It was created in 1925 for the Liberal politician H. H. Asquith. He was Home Secretary from 1892 to 1895, Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1905 to 1908, Leader of the Liberal Party from 1908 to 1926 and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1908 to 1916. Asquith was made Viscount Asquith, of Morley in the West Riding of the County of York, at the same time, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title is used as a courtesy title by the heir apparent to the earldom. Asquith had originally wanted to be created simply Earl of Oxford. However, this greatly offended the relatives of the dormant earldom of Oxford, held for many centuries by the de Vere family, and Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, held by the Harley family in the second creation. In the face of opposition from them, another title had to be selected ‚Äì the formal title 'Earl of Oxford and Asquith' was finally decided as a compromise, with it being abbreviated to 'Earl of Oxford' in everyday conversation and letters, which still irritated the other family members. The first Earl was succeeded in 1928 by his grandson, his eldest son Raymond Asquith having been killed in World War I. The second Earl was a diplomat and administrator and served as Governor of the Seychelles from 1962 to 1967. He died in 2011 and was succeeded by his son, the third Earl and current holder of the title. The current Lord Oxford and Asquith is a retired diplomat. Several other members of the Asquith family have also gained distinction. Raymond Asquith, eldest son of the first Earl and father of the second, was a barrister and intellectual. Herbert Asquith, second son of the first Earl, was a poet, novelist and lawyer. Arthur Melland Asquith (1883‚Äì1939), third son of the first Earl, was a Brigadier-General in the Army. Cyril Asquith, fourth son of the first Earl, was a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and was created a life peer as Baron Asquith of Bishopstone in 1951. Violet Asquith, better known under her married name of Violet Bonham Carter, was a Liberal politician and was created a life peer as Baroness Asquith of Yarnbury in 1964. Her eldest son Mark Bonham Carter was a publisher and politician and was created a life peer as Baron Bonham-Carter in 1986. His daughter is the life peer Jane Bonham Carter, Baroness Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury. Raymond Bonham Carter, second son of Baroness Asquith of Yarnbury, was a banker and the father of the noted actress Helena Bonham Carter and of Edward Bonham Carter. Elizabeth Asquith (better known by her married name of Elizabeth Bibesco), the only daughter from the second marriage of the first Earl, was a writer. She married the Romanian lawyer, diplomat and writer Prince Antoine Bibesco in 1919. Anthony Asquith, only son from the second marriage of the first Earl, became a successful film director. Dominic Asquith, second son of the second Earl, is a prominent diplomat and served as British Ambassador to Iraq from 2006 to 2007. Margot Asquith (n√©e Tennant), second wife of the first Earl, a socialite, author and wit, became the Countess of Oxford and Asquith upon her husband's becoming the first Earl.

In the 1930s, a large number of users of Jamaica ginger were afflicted with a paralysis of the hands and feet that quickly became known as Jamaica ginger paralysis or jake paralysis. Early use and Prohibition Since the 1860s, Jamaica ginger had been widely sold at drug stores and roadside stands in bottles. In small doses, mixed with water, it was used as a remedy for headaches, upper respiratory infections, menstrual disorders, and intestinal gas. Despite its strong ginger flavour, it was popular as an alcoholic beverages in dry counties in the United States, where it was a convenient and legal method of obtaining alcohol. It was often mixed with a soft drink to improve the taste. When Prohibition was enacted in 1920, sale of alcohol became illegal nationwide, prompting consumers to search for substitutes. Patent medicines with a high alcohol percentage, such as Jamaica ginger, became obvious choices, as they were legal and available over the counter without prescriptions. By 1921, the United States government made the original formulation of Jamaica ginger prescription-only. Only a fluid extract version defined in the United States Pharmacopeia, with a high content of bitter- tasting ginger oleoresin, remained available in stores. Because of the taste, it was classified as nonpotable, and was therefore legal to sell despite the alcohol content. Manufacturers of Jamaica ginger began to illegally replace the ginger oleoresin in their product with cheaper ingredients like molasses, glycerin, and castor oil, cutting costs and significantly diminishing the unpleasant ginger flavor. United States Department of Agriculture agents audited Jamaica ginger manufacturers for these illegal alterations by boiling samples and weighing the resulting solids. Victims= Organophosphate- induced delayed neuropathy  When the price of castor oil increased in the latter portion of the 1920s, Harry Gross, president of Hub Products Corporation, sought an alternative additive for his Jamaica ginger formula. He discarded ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol as being too volatile, eventually selecting a mixture containing triorthocresyl phosphate (TOCP), a plasticizer used in lacquers and paint finishing. Gross was advised by the manufacturer of the mixture, Celluloid Corporation, that it was non-toxic. TOCP was originally thought to be non-toxic; however, it was later determined to be a neurotoxin that causes axonal damage to the nerve cells in the nervous system of human beings, especially those located in the spinal cord. The resulting type of paralysis is now referred to as organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy, or OPIDN. In 1930, large numbers of Jake users began to find they were unable to use their hands and feet. Some victims could walk, but they had no control over the muscles which would normally have enabled them to point their toes upward. Therefore, they would raise their feet high with the toes flopping downward, which would touch the pavement first followed by their heels. The toe first, heel second pattern made a distinctive \\"tap- click, tap-click\\" sound as they walked. This very peculiar gait became known as the jake walk and the jake dance and those afflicted were saidhttp://www.ibiblio.org/moonshine/drink/jake.html to have jake leg, jake foot, or jake paralysis. Additionally, the calves of the legs would soften and hang down and the muscles between the thumbs and fingers would atrophy. Within a few months, the TOCP-adulterated Jake was identified as the cause of the paralysis, and the contaminated Jake was recovered. But by that time, it was too late for many victims. Some did recover full, or partial, use of their limbs. But for most, the loss was permanent. The total number of victims was never accurately determined, but is frequently quoted as between 30,000 and 50,000. Many victims were immigrants to the United States, and most were poor, with little political or social influence. The victims received very little assistance. Several blues songs on the subject were recorded in the early 1930s, such as \\"Jake Walk Papa\\" by Asa Martin, and \\"Jake Liquor Blues\\" by Ishman Bracey. Although this incident became well known, later cases of organophosphate poisoning occurred in Germany, Spain, Italy, and, on a large scale, in Morocco in 1959, where cooking oil adulterated with jet engine lubricant from an American airbase led to paralysis in approximately 10,000 victims, and caused an international incident.

He had already been created Viscount Jellicoe, of Scapa in the County of Orkney, on 15 January 1918, created with remainder to the heirs male of his body, and in default of such issue to his eldest daughter and the heirs male of her body, with the like remainder in default of such issue to every other daughter successively in order of priority of birth, and to the heirs male of their bodies. (PDF) The Jellicoe viscountcy was created with remainder to his daughters and their heirs male because, at the time of the creation, Jellicoe had five daughters and no sons. His only son was born three months later. The title of Viscount Brocas is used as a courtesy title for the Earl's eldest son and heir apparent. Brocas was chosen due to the descent of Admiral Jellicoe's great-grandmother, Jane Elizabeth, daughter of Sir James Whalley-Smythe-Gardiner, 2nd Baronet, of Roche Court, Fareham, from the last of the Brocases of Beaurepaire (purchased 1353, sold 1873), Sherborne St John, Hampshire. This was a family with Gascon roots that produced two Masters of the Horse and a 300-year (14th to 17th century) line of hereditary Masters of the King's Buckhounds. The 1st Earl Jellicoe was succeeded by his only son, George Patrick John Rushworth Jellicoe. The second earl served in the Coldstream Guards, No. 8 Commando, the Special Air Service and commanded the Special Boat Service during the Second World War. He later became a diplomat and a Conservative politician and served as the last First Lord of the Admiralty from 1963 to 1964 and as Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords from 1970 to 1973. In 1999 he was given a life peerage as Baron Jellicoe of Southampton, of Southampton, in the County of Hampshire, and remained a member of the House of Lords despite the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999 which removed the hereditary peerage's automatic right to sit in the Lords. Until his death in 2007, the second Earl Jellicoe was the longest-serving member of the Lords, and technically the longest-serving parliamentarian in the world, having taken his seat in 1939.

It is usually applied to governments, corporations, and other large organizations. Things often described as \\"red tape\\" include filling out paperwork, obtaining licenses, having multiple people or committees approve a decision and various low-level rules that make conducting one's affairs slower, more difficult, or both. Origins Bundle of US pension documents from 1906 bound in red tape It is generally believed that the term originated with the Spanish administration of Charles V, King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, in the early 16th century, who started to use red tape in an effort to modernize the administration that was running his vast empire. The red tape was used to bind the most important administrative dossiers that required immediate discussion by the Council of State, and separate them from issues that were treated in an ordinary administrative way, which were bound with ordinary string. Although they were not governing such a vast territory as Charles V, this practice of using red tape to separate the important dossiers that had to be discussed was quickly copied by the other modern European monarchs to speed up their administrative machines. In this age of civil servants using computers and information technology, a legacy from the administration of the Spanish Empire can still be observed where some parts of the higher levels of the Spanish administration continue the tradition of using red tape to bind important dossiers that need to be discussed and to keep them bound in red tape when the dossier is closed. This is, for example, the case for the Spanish Council of State, the supreme consultative council of the Spanish Government. In contrast, the lower Spanish courts use ordinary twine to bundle documents as their cases are not supposed to be heard at higher levels. The Spanish Government plansto phase out the use of paper and abandon the practice of using twine. The tradition continued through to the 17th and 18th century. In David Copperfield, Charles Dickens wrote, \\"Britannia, that unfortunate female, is always before me, like a trussed fowl: skewered through and through with office-pens, and bound hand and foot with red tape.\\" The English practice of binding documents and official papers with red tape was popularized in Thomas Carlyle'sp.1152, Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase & Fable, 17th Edition; Revised by J Ayto, 2005 writings, protesting against official inertia with expressions like \\"Little other than a red tape Talking-machine, and unhappy Bag of Parliamentary Eloquence\\". To this day, most defense barristers' briefs, and those from private clients, are tied in a pink-coloured ribbon known as \\"pink tape\\" or \\"legal tape\\". Even in modern times, Spanish bureaucracy is notorious for unusually extreme levels of red tape (in the figurative sense). As of 2013, the World Bank ranked Spain 136 out of 185 countries for ease of starting a business, which took on average 10 procedures and 28 days. Similar issues persist throughout Latin America. As of 2009 in Mexico, it took six months and a dozen visits to government agencies to obtain a permit to paint a house, and to obtain a monthly prescription for gamma globulin for X-linked agammaglobulinemia a patient had to obtain signatures from two government doctors and stamps from four separate bureaucrats before presenting the prescription to a dispensary. Red tape reduction The expression \\"cutting of red tape\\" generally refers to a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles to action. It is also used as a cover to justify the reduction or removal of protective standards or regulations. Business representatives often claim red tape is a barrier to business, particularly small business. In Canada, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business has done extensive research into the impact of red tape on small businesses. The European Commission has a competition that offers an award for the \\"Best Idea for Red Tape Reduction\\". The competition is \\"aimed at identifying innovative suggestions for reducing unnecessary bureaucracy stemming from European law\\".European Commission In 2008, the European Commission held a conference entitled 'Cutting Red Tape for Europe'. The goal of the conference was \\"reducing red tape and overbearing bureaucracy,\\" in order to help \\"business people and entrepreneurs improve competitiveness\\".

Etymology The name Fritillaria comes from the Latin fritillus meaning dice-box, possibly referring to the chequered pattern on the flowers although this derivation has been disputed.http://www.thepoisongarden.co.uk/atoz/fritillaria.htm The name meleagris means \\"spotted like a guineafowl\\". The common name \\"snake's head\\" probably refers to the somewhat snakelike appearance of the nodding flower heads, especially when in bud, on their long stems. Vita Sackville-West called it \\"a sinister little flower, in the mournful colour of decay\\". Description and habitat The flower has a chequered pattern in shades of purple, or is sometimes pure white. It flowers from March to May and grows between in height. The plant has a button-shaped bulb, about 2 cm in diameter, containing poisonous alkaloids. It grows in grasslands in damp soils and river meadows at altitudes up to . Distribution Fritillaria meleagris is native to Europe and western Asia but in many places it is an endangered species that is rarely found in the wild but is commonly grown in gardens. In Croatia, the flower is known as kockavica and is associated by some with the country's national symbol. It is the official flower of the Swedish province of Uppland, where it grows in large quantities every spring in the meadows of Kungs√§ngen (King‚Äôs Meadow), just outside Uppsala, which gives the flower its Swedish name, kungs√§ngslilja (king‚Äôs meadow lily). It is also found for example in Sandemar Nature Reserve, a nature reserve west of Dalar√∂ in Stockholm Archipelago. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom there is some disagreement amongst botanists as to whether F. meleagris is a native species or a long-established garden escapee. The plant was first described in the 16th century by herbalist John Gerard who had only known of it as a garden plant and it was not recorded in the wild until 1736, which has led some to argue that it must be an escapee. However, the fact that its habitat is usually confined to ancient hay meadows and it does not easily spread to adjoining land, leads others to the conclusion that it is a native species which became isolated from the European population when Britain was cut off from mainland Europe after the last glacial period. Clive Stace (2010) says that it is \\"doubtfully native\\". The plant was once abundant in the UK, particularly in the Thames Valley and parts of Wiltshire, and was collected in vast quantities to be sold as a cut flower in the markets of London, Oxford and Birmingham. During World War II most of the ancient meadows were ploughed up and turned over to the production of food crops, destroying much of the plant's habitat. A popular garden plant, it is now rare in the wild, although there are some notable sites where it is still found, such as the meadows at Magdalen College, Iffley Meadows, Oxford and the Oxfordshire village of Ducklington, which holds a \\"Fritillary Sunday\\" festival. It is also found in the North Meadow National Nature Reserve, Wiltshire, Clattinger Farm Nature Reserve, Wiltshire and Fox Fritillary Meadow and Mickfield Meadow nature reserves in Suffolk.Fox Fritillary Meadow, Framsden, SSSI citation, Natural England. Retrieved 2013-05-30.Fox Fritillary Meadow, Suffolk Wildlife Trust. Retrieved 2013-05-30.Mickfield Meadow, SSSI citation, Natural England. Retrieved 2013-05-30. In 2002 it was chosen as the County flower of Oxfordshire following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife.Plantlife website County Flowers page  Cultivation  Now easily available as an ornamental spring bulb for the garden, it is commonly sold as a mixture of different coloured cultivars. The species and the pure white-flowered variety F. meleagris var. unicolor subvar. alba have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Like many plants in the lily family, F. meleagris is susceptible to the scarlet lily beetle, which can seriously damage or kill it.

It is managed by the ISO Technical Committee 159. It was originally titled Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs). From 2006 on, the standards were retitled to the more generic Ergonomics of Human System Interaction. As part of this change, ISO is renumbering some parts of the standard so that it can cover more topics, e.g. tactile and haptic interaction. For example, two zeros in the number indicate that the document under consideration is a generic or basic standard. Fundamental aspects are regulated in standards ending with one zero. A standard with three digits other than zero in the number regulate specific aspects. The first part to be renumbered was part 10 (now renumbered to part 110). Part 1 is a general introduction to the rest of the standard. Part 2 addresses task design for working with computer systems. Parts 3‚Äì9 deal with physical characteristics of computer equipment. Parts 110 and parts 11‚Äì19 deal with usability aspects of software, including Part 110 (a general set of usability heuristics for the design of different types of dialogue) and Part 11 (general guidance on the specification and measurement of usability). Ergonomics of Human System Interaction The revised multipart standard is numbered in series as follows: *100 series: Software ergonomics *200 series: Human system interaction processes *300 series: Displays and display related hardware *400 series: Physical input devices - ergonomics principles *500 series: Workplace ergonomics *600 series: Environment ergonomics *700 series: Application domains - Control rooms *900 series: Tactile and haptic interactions Within those series, the standard currently includes the following parts: *Part 100: Introduction to standards related to software ergonomics *Part 110: Dialogue principles *Part 112: Principles for the presentation of information *Part 125: Guidance on visual presentation of information *Part 129: Guidance on software individualization *Part 151: Guidance on World Wide Web user interfaces *Part 143: Forms *Part 154: Interactive voice response (IVR) applications *Part 161: Guidance on visual user interface elements *Part 171: Guidance on software accessibility *Part 210: Human-centred design for interactive systems *Part 300: Introduction to electronic visual display requirements *Part 302: Terminology for electronic visual displays *Part 303: Requirements for electronic visual displays *Part 304: User performance test methods for electronic visual displays *Part 305: Optical laboratory test methods for electronic visual displays *Part 306: Field assessment methods for electronic visual displays *Part 307: Analysis and compliance test methods for electronic visual displays *Part 308: Surface-conduction electron-emitter displays (SED) *Part 309 (TR): Organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays *Part 310 (TR): Visibility, aesthetics and ergonomics of pixel defects *Part 400: Principles and requirements for physical input devices *Part 410: Design criteria for physical input devices *Part 910: Framework for tactile and haptic interaction *Part 920: Guidance on tactile and haptic interactions  ISO 9241-110  :(formerly ISO9241-10, withdrawn) Dialogue principles (2006) In 2006, it revised ISO 9241-10:1996, Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs) -- Part 10: Dialogue principles. This part deals with general ergonomic principles which apply to the design of dialogues between humans and information systems: * suitability for the task, * suitability for learning, * suitability for individualization, * conformity with user expectations, * self-descriptiveness, * controllability, and * error tolerance.  ISO 9241-210  :(formerly ISO 13407, withdrawn) Human-centred design processes for interactive systems (1999) ISO 9241-210, Ergonomics of human-system interaction, updated in 2019, provides guidance on human-system interaction throughout the life cycle of interactive systems. With its introduction in 2008, it revised ISO 13407, Human-centred design for interactive systems.  ISO-9241-302, 303, 305, 307:2008 pixel defects  Of particular interest to the lay computer user are the definitions of flat-panel TV and monitor pixel defects provided in the ISO-9241-3xx series of standards (which renders obsolete ISO 13406-2). These identify three classes for measuring pixel defects in flat panel monitors: * Class 0 panels are completely defect-free, including no full pixel or sub-pixel defects. * Class 1 panels permit any or all of the following: ** 1 full bright (‚Äústuck on white‚Äù) pixel ** 1 full dark (‚Äústuck off‚Äù) pixel ** 2 single or double bright or dark sub-pixels ** 3 to 5 ‚Äústuck on‚Äù or ‚Äústuck off‚Äù sub-pixels (depending on the number of each) * Class 2 panels permit any or all of the following: ** 2 full bright pixels ** 2 full dark pixels ** 5-10 single or double bright or dark sub-pixels (again, depending on the number of each; no more than 5 bright (‚Äústuck on‚Äù) subpixels are permitted). * Class 3 panels permit any or all of the following: ** 5 full bright pixels ** 15 full dark pixels ** 50 single or double sub-pixels stuck on or off (allowed pixed defects per 1 (one) million pixels in the TFT/LCD matrix) As of 2010, most premium branded panel manufacturers specify their products as Class 0, expecting a small number of returns due to early failure where a particular item fails to meet Class 0 but would meet Class 1. Budget panel manufacturers tend to specify their products as Class 1. Most premium branded finished product manufacturers (retail TVs, monitors, Laptops, etc.) tend to specify their products as meeting Class 1 even when they have a Class 0 specified panel inside. Some premium branded finished product manufacturers have started to specify their products as Class 0 or offer a Class 0 guarantee for an additional premium.http://bizsupport2.austin.hp.com/bc/docs/support/SupportManual/c01634493/c01634493.pdfhttp://www.acer.com/acer/service.do;jsessionid=FC40358EEEA4A55F9AB6178CF4B0337C.public_a_14c?LanguageISOCtxParam=hi&sp;=page15e&CountryISOCtxParam;=IN&miu10einu23.current.attN2B2F2EEF;=3767&ctx2.c2att1;=158&miu10ekcond13.attN2B2F2EEF;=3331&miu10ekcond12.attN2B2F2EEF;=3767&ctx1.att21k;=1&CRC;=836628430 Previous version ISO 9241 was originally titled Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs) and consisted of the following parts: *Part 1: General introduction *Part 2: Guidance on task requirements *Part 3: Visual display requirements *Part 4: Keyboard requirements *Part 5: Workstation layout and postural requirements *Part 6: Guidance on the work environment *Part 7: Display requirements with reflections *Part 8: Requirements for displayed colors *Part 9: Requirements for non-keyboard input devices *Part 10: Dialogue principles *Part 11: Guidance on usability *Part 12: Presentation of information *Part 13: User guidance *Part 14: Menu dialogues *Part 15: Command dialogues *Part 16: Direct manipulation dialogues *Part 17: Form filling dialogues *Part 20: Accessibility guidelines for ICT equipment and services ISO 9241-1 Part 1: (1997) Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs) : General Introduction This part introduces the multi-part standard ISO 9241 for the ergonomic requirements for the use of visual display terminals for office tasks and explains some of the basic underlying principles. It provides some guidance on how to use the standard and describes how conformance to parts of ISO 9241 should be reported. ISO 9241-2 Part 2: (1993) Guidance on task requirements This part deals with the design of tasks and jobs involving work with visual display terminals. It provides guidance on how task requirements may be identified and specified within individual organisations and how task requirements can be incorporated into the system design and implementation process. ISO 9241-3 Part 3: (1993, deprecated) Visual display requirements This part specifies the ergonomics requirements for display screens which ensure that they can be read comfortably, safely and efficiently to perform office tasks. Although it deals specifically with displays used in offices, it is appropriate to specify it for most applications that require general purpose displays to be used in an office- like environment. ISO 9241-4 Part 4: (1998) Keyboard requirements This part specifies the ergonomics design characteristics of an alphanumeric keyboard which may be used comfortably, safely and efficiently to perform office tasks. Keyboard layouts are dealt with separately in various parts of ISO/IEC 9995: 1994 Information Processing - Keyboard Layouts for Text and Office Systems ISO 9241-5 Part 5: (1998) Workstation layout and postural requirements This part specifies the ergonomics requirement for a Visual Display Terminal workplace which will allow the user to adopt a comfortable and efficient posture. ISO 9241-6 Part 6: (1999) Environmental requirements This part specifies the ergonomics requirements for the Visual Display Terminal working environment which will provide the user with comfortable, safe and productive working conditions. ISO 9241-7 Part 7: (1998, deprecated) Display requirements with reflections This part specifies methods of measurement of glare and reflections from the surface of display screens, including those with surface treatments. ISO 9241-8 Part 8: (1997, deprecated) Requirements for displayed colors This part specifies the requirements for multicolour displays which are largely in addition to the monochrome requirements in Part 3. ISO 9241-9 Part 9: (2000) Requirements for non-keyboard input devices This part specifies the ergonomics requirements for non-keyboard input devices which may be used in conjunction with a visual display terminal. It also includes a suggestion for a user-based performance test as an alternative way of showing conformance. The standard covers such devices as the mouse, trackball and other pointing devices, but it does not address voice input. ISO 9241-10 Part 10 (1996, withdrawn) \\"Dialogue principles\\": Gives ergonomic principles formulated in general terms; they are presented without reference to situations of use, application, environment or technology. These principles are intended to be used in specifications, design and evaluation of dialogues for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs). ISO 9241-11 Part 11: (1998) To examine the quality of how well tasks are fulfilled by the users (usability testing), ISO 9241-11 framework can be employed. There are three components in the framework: System Effectiveness to examine the users‚Äô ability to complete the given tasks, System Efficiency to examine the required user resources to complete the tasks, and System Satisfaction to record the users‚Äô opinions and feedback. System Effectiveness: Participants are asked to complete six tasks, and the success or failure rate of completing each task is measured to evaluate the app‚Äôs efficiency. Task completion is considered successful when the user completed the task without producing an error or asking for assistance. System Efficiency: For evaluating system efficiency, the researcher records the time (in seconds) that participants took to complete each task. Each task is initiated by expressing the word ‚Äòstart‚Äô and finished when the user mentioned the end. Upon completing each task, the user is asked to fill out the Single Ease Questionnaire (SEQ) to examine the level of task difficulty. The questionnaire is a seven-point Likert scale in which scale 1 indicates the task as ‚Äòvery difficult‚Äô, and scale 7 indicates the task as ‚Äòvery easy‚Äô. System Satisfaction is used to evaluate the overall usability of the apps through System Usability Scale (SUS), which is a usability assessment questionnaire with reliable and valid results. It includes ten questions, each with five items ranging from ‚Äòstrongly agree‚Äô to ‚Äòstrongly disagree‚Äô. The score range is from 0 to 100 and scores higher than 80 are considered high usability while those below 70 are considered low usability. ISO 9241-12 Part 12: (1998) Presentation of information This part contains specific recommendations for presenting and representing information on visual displays. It includes guidance on ways of representing complex information using alphanumeric and graphical/symbolic codes, screen layout, and design as well as the use of windows. ISO 9241-13 Part 13: (1998) User guidance This part provides recommendations for the design and evaluation of user guidance attributes of software user interfaces including Prompts, Feedback, Status, On-line Help and Error Management. ISO 9241-14 Part 14: (1997) Menu dialogues This part provides recommendations for the ergonomic design of menus used in user-computer dialogues. The recommendations cover menu structure, navigation, option selection and execution, and menu presentation (by various techniques including windowing, panels, buttons, fields, etc.). ISO 9241-15 Part 15: (1998) Command language dialogues This part provides recommendations for the ergonomic design of command languages used in user-computer dialogues. The recommendations cover command language structure and syntax, command representations, input and output considerations, and feedback and help. ISO 9241-16 Part 16: (1999) Direct manipulation dialogues This part provides recommendations for the ergonomic design of direct manipulation dialogues, and includes the manipulation of objects, and the design of metaphors, objects and attributes. It covers those aspects of Graphical User Interfaces that are directly manipulated, and not covered by other parts of ISO 9241. ISO 9241-17 Part 17: (1998) Form-filling dialogues This part provides recommendations for the ergonomic design of form filling dialogues. The recommendations cover form structure and output considerations, input considerations, and form navigation.

She returned to Earth with the crew of STS-119 Discovery on March 28, 2009, after having spent 134 days in orbit. She was assigned to the crew of STS-135, the final mission of the Space Shuttle. She is also a licensed amateur radio operator with the call sign KE5FYE. From 2012 until 2018 Magnus was the executive director of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Biography=Early life and education Magnus was born and raised in Belleville, Illinois. She earned degrees in physics and electrical engineering from the University of Missouri‚ÄìRolla (now known as the Missouri University of Science and Technology) before earning a PhD in materials science and engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1996. Research for her dissertation, entitled \\"An Investigation of the relationship between the thermochemistry and emission behavior of thermionic cathodes based on the BaO-Sc2O3-WO3 ternary system,\\" was supported by a fellowship from the NASA Lewis Research Center. Engineering career During the 1980s, Magnus worked on stealth aircraft design as an engineer for McDonnell Douglas. She worked on the propulsion system for the A-12 Avenger II until the project was canceled by the Navy in 1991. NASA career Sandra Magnus, STS-119 mission specialist, exercises on the Cycle Ergometer with Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS) in the Destiny laboratory. Magnus was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1996. Following training for two years from January 1997 until May 1998, Magnus was assigned to the Payloads/Habitability branch in the Astronaut office. Her work included coordinating with the European Space agency and the Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) and Brazil. In May 1998 she was assigned to work in Russia supporting payload hardware development and testing. In 2000 she was CAPCOM for the International Space Station. =STS-112= She flew her first space mission, STS-112, in October 2002 as a mission specialist. The main objective of Space Shuttle Atlantis' mission was the installation of the S1 truss section on the International Space Station (ISS) and consumables delivery. Magnus operated the space station's robotic arm during the three spacewalks required to install and activate the S1 truss. The flight duration was 10 days 19 hours 58 minutes and 44 seconds. =Survival training= From January 29‚Äì31, 2006, together with Oleg Artemiev and Michael Barratt, Magnus took part in a two-day examination for the ability to survive in an uninhabited area in case of the Soyuz descent module making an emergency landing. She passed this examination in the forest near Moscow. =NEEMO 11= From September 16‚Äì22, 2006, Magnus served as the commander of NASA's NEEMO 11 mission, an undersea expedition at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Aquarius laboratory located off the coast of Florida. With fellow astronaut/aquanauts Timothy Kopra, Robert Behnken and Timothy Creamer, all of whom were training for possible assignment to missions to the International Space Station, Magnus imitated moonwalks, tested concepts for mobility using various spacesuit configurations and weights to simulate lunar gravity. Techniques for communication, navigation, geological sample retrieval, construction and using remote-controlled robots on the moon's surface also were tested. National Undersea Research Center support crew members Larry Ward and Roger Garcia provided engineering support inside the habitat. =Expedition 18= Magnus served as Flight Engineer on board the International Space Station as part of Expedition 18. Magnus was a Mission Specialist on STS-126 for the trip to the station, which launched on November 14, 2008. She served as Mission Specialist on STS-119 when it returned on March 28, 2009. She logged 133 days in orbit and received warm greetings from NASA on her return. Her replacement, JAXA astronaut Koichi Wakata, was launched aboard Discovery on March 15, 2009. =STS-135= Cupola aboard the International Space Station during STS-135.

He was a veteran of three space shuttle missions. Sellers attended Cranbrook School, Cranbrook, Kent, United Kingdom, until 1973, and achieved a bachelor's degree in ecological science from the University of Edinburgh in 1976. In 1981 he gained a doctorate in biometeorology from the University of Leeds. In 2011, Sellers retired from the NASA Astronaut Corps. Before joining the astronaut corps, Sellers worked at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on research into how the Earth's biosphere and atmosphere interact. This work involved climate system computer modelling and field work utilising aircraft, satellites and ground support input. Personal life Sellers was born in Crowborough, Sussex, the second born of five boys for mother Lindsey. His education started at Tyttenhanger Lodge Pre- preparatory School in Seaford, East Sussex, and Cranbrook School, Kent, from which he graduated in 1973 and where he was trained as a Royal Air Force cadet to pilot gliders and powered aircraft. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in ecological science from the University of Edinburgh and a doctorate in biometeorology from the University of Leeds. Sellers married Amanda Lomas, a nurse from Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, before they moved to the US. This marriage ended in divorce. In January 2016, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Sellers died 23 December 2016 at the age of 61. Sellers appeared in the Leonardo DiCaprio-produced documentary film Before the Flood. Career Sellers and his wife left the UK in 1982, moving to the United States, where he began his NASA career as a research meteorologist at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Sellers's work in the field of meteorology focused primarily on computer modelling of climate systems, but he maintained his aircraft pilot skills. Sellers began applying annually to become an astronaut in 1984, but his lack of US citizenship was a problem. In 1991 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. NASA career Sellers performing a spacewalk during STS-121 Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in April 1996, Sellers reported to the NASA Johnson Space Center in August 1996. He completed two years of training and evaluation and was initially assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Computer Support Branch, followed by service in the Astronaut Office Space Station Branch. During that time, he worked part-time in Moscow as a technical liaison on ISS computer software. Sellers logged over 559 hours in space, including almost 41 EVA hours in 6 spacewalks. He retired as an astronaut in 2011 and then served as deputy director of sciences and exploration at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Spaceflight experience STS-112 (7‚Äì18 October 2002) was an International Space Station assembly mission during which the crew conducted joint operations with the Expedition-5 in delivering and installing the S-One Trussb (the third piece of the station's 11-piece Integrated Truss Structure). To outfit and activate the new component, Sellers performed three spacewalks and logged a total of 19 hours and 41 minutes of EVA. The crew also transferred cargo between the two vehicles and used the shuttle's thruster jets during two manoeuvres to raise the station's orbit. STS-112 was the first shuttle mission to use a camera on the External Tank, providing a live view of the launch to flight controllers and NASA TV viewers. The mission was accomplished in 170 orbits, travelling 4.5 million miles in 10 days, 19 hours, and 58 minutes. STS-121 (4‚Äì17 July 2006) was a return-to-flight test mission and assembly flight to the International Space Station. During the 13-day flight, the crew of Discovery tested new equipment and procedures that increased the safety of space shuttles, and produced never-before-seen, high-resolution images of the Shuttle during and after its 4 July launch. The crew also performed maintenance on the space station and delivered and transferred more than 28,000 pounds of supplies and equipment, and a new Expedition 13 crew member to the station. Sellers and Mike Fossum performed three EVAs to test the 50-foot robotic arm boom extension as a work platform. They removed and replaced a cable that provides power, command and data and video connections to the station's mobile transporter rail car. They also tested techniques for inspecting and repairing the reinforced carbon-carbon segments that protect the shuttle's nose cone and leading edge of the wings. The STS-121 mission was accomplished in 306 hours, 37 minutes and 54 seconds. Sellers brought a velvet patch of the University of Edinburgh crest into space on this flight, which was sewn to the graduating bonnet used during the University's graduation ceremonies. STS-132 mission poster STS-132 (14‚Äì26 May 2010) was an International Space Station assembly mission. The primary payload was the Russian Rassvet Mini-Research Module along with an Integrated Cargo Carrier- Vertical Light Deployable (ICC-VLD). This was the final scheduled mission of Atlantis. Sellers took a four-inch wood sample of Sir Isaac Newton's apple tree‚Äîa piece from the original tree that supposedly inspired Newton's theory of gravity‚Äîalong with a picture of Newton. The wood is part of the collection of the Royal Society archives in London, and was returned there following the flight. He also took an original watercolor portrait of Cranbrook School painted by Brenda Barratt. Honours and awards * 1994 NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal * 1995 Arthur Fleming Award * 1996 Fellow of the American Geophysical Union * 1997 American Meteorological Society Houghton Award & Fellow of the American Meteorological Society Sellers was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 New Year Honours for services to science, and in June 2016 received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal. In April 2017, James Ellis, the retired U.S. Navy admiral and chair of the Space Foundation's Board of Directors, honored Sellers posthumously with the General James E.

In June 1991, she attended the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Upon her graduation, she was assigned to the C-17 Combined Test Force, where she served as a test pilot until her selection for the astronaut program. She has logged over 5,000 hours of flight time in over 50 different aircraft. Melroy retired from the Air Force in February 2007. NASA career Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in December 1994, Melroy reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. She completed a year of training and evaluation and was qualified for flight assignment as a shuttle pilot. Initially assigned to astronaut support duties for launch and landing, she also worked Advanced Projects for the Astronaut Office. She also performed CAPCOM duties in mission control. Melroy served on the Columbia Reconstruction Team as the lead for the crew module and served as deputy project manager for the Columbia crew survival investigation team. In her final position, she served as branch chief for the Orion branch of the Astronaut Office. Melroy served as pilot on two flights (STS-92 in 2000 and STS-112 in 2002), and was the mission commander on STS-120 in 2007, making her the second woman to command a space shuttle mission (after Eileen Collins). The STS-120 crew visited the station during Expedition 16, commanded by Peggy Whitson. Whitson was the first female ISS commander, making the STS-120 mission the first time that two female mission commanders were in orbit at the same time. She has logged over 924 hours (over 38 days) in space. Spaceflight experience STS-92 Discovery (October 11‚Äì24, 2000) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 13-day flight, the seven member crew attached the Z1 Truss and Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 to the International Space Station using Discovery's robotic arm and performed four spacewalks to configure these elements. This expansion of the ISS opened the door for future assembly missions and prepared the station for its first resident crew. The STS-92 mission was accomplished in 202 orbits, traveling 5.3 million miles in 12 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes and 25 seconds. STS-112 Atlantis (October 7‚Äì18, 2002) launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. STS-112 was an International Space Station assembly mission during which the crew conducted joint operations with the Expedition-5 by delivering and installing the S1 Truss (the third piece of the station's 11-piece Integrated Truss Structure). It took three spacewalks to outfit and activate the new component, during which Melroy acted as internal spacewalk choreographer. STS-112 was the first shuttle mission to use a camera on the External Tank, providing a live view of the launch to flight controllers and NASA TV viewers. The mission was accomplished in 170 orbits, traveling 4.5 million miles in 10 days, 19 hours, and 58 minutes. STS-120 Discovery (October 23 ‚Äì November 7, 2007) launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the mission, the Node 2 element named Harmony was delivered to the International Space Station.

Wolf has been to space four times. Three of his spaceflights were short-duration Space Shuttle missions, the first of which was STS-58 in 1993, and his most recent spaceflight was STS-127 in 2009. Wolf also took part in a long-duration mission aboard the Russian space station Mir which lasted 128 days, and occurred during Mir EO-24. He was brought to Mir aboard STS-86 in September 1997, and landed aboard STS-89 in January 1998. In total Wolf has logged more than 4,040 hours in space. He is also a veteran of 7 spacewalks totaling 41hrs 17min in both Russian and American spacesuits. Education David A. Wolf was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States and graduated from North Central High School. Wolf then went on to earn a degree in electrical engineering from Purdue University, where he graduated with distinction and became a brother in the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. In 1982, he earned a medical degree from Indiana University School of Medicine. He subsequently trained as a flight surgeon with the United States Air Force. Wolf joined the staff of Johnson Space Center in 1983 and investigated the physiological effects of microgravity. Honors and organizations David Wolf has received numerous awards and honors. He is a recipient of the NASA Exceptional Engineering Achievement Medal in 1990 and NASA Inventor of the Year in 1992. Wolf received an Academic Achievement Award upon graduation from medical school.

The City of Indianapolis honored Wolf by naming Marion County Bridge 0501F (carrying E. 82nd St. over the White River) the \\"Astronaut David Wolf Bridge.\\" NASA career David Wolf began his NASA career in the Medical Sciences Division at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. He was responsible for engineering development and spacecraft avionics integration of the American Flight Echocardiograph for investigating cardiovascular physiology in microgravity. Upon completion, he was assigned as chief engineer for design of the Space Station medical facility, directly responsible for multidisciplinary team management, requirements definition, system design, spacecraft systems integration, project schedule, functional and safety verification, and budgetary authority. Dave Wolf was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in 1990. He completed 18 months of training before being qualified for flight. He was assigned to Kennedy Space Center in Florida where he was involved in Orbiter vehicle processing and testing and as a Capcom (including for the historic docking of Space Shuttle Atlantis with Space Station Mir in 1995). He is an expert in Extravehicular Activity (Spacewalk), Spacesuit design, and Rendezvous navigation. Some of his other qualifications include Robotic Manipulator System (Robot Arm) operations, on-orbit systems repair, computer networking, and as Shuttle re-entry flight deck engineer. During his training for a Mir expedition, he lived and trained in Star City, Russia at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center. Wolf became fluent in Russian, as all of his training there was in Russian. Wolf and fellow Jewish astronaut Jeffrey A. Hoffman had \\"a running battle, a running argument on who has the longest dreidel spin.\\" Other Jewish artifacts he took into space and brought back include \\"a yad ‚Äì a Torah pointer, and .. a small menorah.\\" Spaceflight experience Wolf performing an experiment during the STS-58 mission. STS-58 David Wolf served as mission specialist 3 aboard Columbia during the STS-58 mission. STS-58, designated Spacelab Life Sciences 2, was the second dedicated mission to study regulatory physiology, cardiovascular/cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and neuroscience. The mission lasted 14 days, 0 hours, 12 minutes and 32 seconds. Columbia landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California. At the time of landing STS-58 was the longest duration mission flown. Mir Expedition 24 Wolf flew aboard Atlantis on STS-86 in September 1997. Wolf was only on board for a short time as he was being transported to the Russian Mir space station. Atlantis docked with the Mir space station on September 27, 1997, which marked the start of Dave Wolf's stay on Mir. David Wolf spent 128 days aboard space station Mir. He conducted a number of experiments and studies including, advanced microgravity tissue engineering techniques, electromagnetic levitation platform capability, colloid behavior, Radio-tracer studies of altered human erythropoetic function, and human microgravity physiology studies. During his stay, there were a number of systems failures including multiple failed spacecraft systems, including atmospheric life support, three total power system failures, loss of attitude control, primary computer system failure, humidity separation system loss. An emergency ingress had to be made during an EVA performed in the Russian Orlan space suit due to airlock hatch failure. The entire mission and training were conducted solely in Russian. While aboard Mir, Wolf became the first American to vote from space, casting a ballot in a 1997 local election. STS-89 was David Wolf's return ride home to earth. STS-89 docked with Mir on January 24, 1998, marking the end of Wolf's stay on Mir. Endeavour touched down on January 31, 1998. STS-112 Dave Wolf flew aboard Atlantis during the STS-112 mission. STS-112 delivered the S1 truss segment the International Space Station (ISS). Atlantis launched on October 7, 2002 from Kennedy Space Center. Wolf conducted 3 spacewalks, to install the S1 truss segment and other EVA hardware. He spent a total of 19hrs and 1 minute outside the ISS. Atlantis landed on October 18, 2002, ending STS-112 at 10 days, 19 hours, 58 minutes and 44 seconds. STS-127 David Wolf last flew on Endeavour during the STS-127 (2J/A) mission. The STS-127 launched on July 15, 2009, and the mission delivered the Japanese Experiment Logistics Module ‚Äì Exposed Section (ELM-ES) and new expedition member Timothy Kopra. STS-127 was originally scheduled to launch in June 2009 but was delayed after a leak was detected at the gaseous hydrogen vent line. A second attempt was made 3 days after the first try but was scrubbed for the same problem. A third launch attempt was canceled due to bad weather and a further delay occurred when lightning struck near the pad. Wolf conducted 3 spacewalks, totaling 18hrs 24min. STS-127 landed on July 31, 2009 and lasted 15 days, 16hrs, 44min and 58seconds.

Bettman was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2018. Under Bettman, the NHL has seen rapid growth of league revenues, from $400 million when he was hired to over $3 billion in 2010‚Äì11. He also oversaw the expansion of the NHL's footprint across the United States, with eight new teams added during his tenure, bringing the NHL to 32 teams, starting as of the 2021‚Äì22 season.

Bettman's tenure in the NHL has been controversial. He has often been criticized for attempting to give the game a mass appeal, and for expanding the league into non-traditional hockey markets such as the Sun Belt at the expense of the more traditional markets in Canada and the Northern United States. Bettman has also been a central figure of three labour stoppages, including the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout that saw the entire season canceled.

Bettman rose to third in command of the NBA, spending many years as the league's general counsel and senior vice president. Bettman played a key role in the development of the soft salary cap system implemented and agreed by the NBA in 1983,USATODAY.COM: \\"NBA players cry foul over team incomes\\" Retrieved December 13, 1991 a system it continues to use today. NHL commissioner On February 1, 1993, Bettman began his tenure as the first commissioner of the National Hockey League, replacing Gil Stein, who served as the NHL's final president. The owners hired Bettman with the mandate of selling the game in the U.S. market, ending labour unrest, completing expansion plans, and modernizing the views of the \\"old guard\\" within the ownership ranks. Expansion, relocation and realignment When Bettman started as commissioner, the league had already expanded by three teams to 24 starting with the 1991‚Äì92 season, and two more were set to be announced by the expansion committee: the Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, who would begin play in 1993‚Äì94. Led by Bettman, the league focused expansion and relocation efforts during the rest of the 1990s on the American South, working to expand the league's footprint across the country. The Nashville Predators (1998), Atlanta Thrashers (1999), Minnesota Wild (2000) and Columbus Blue Jackets (2000) completed this expansion period, bringing the NHL to 30 teams. In addition, four franchises relocated during the 1990s under Bettman: The Minnesota North Stars to Dallas (1993), the Quebec Nordiques to Denver (1995), the original Winnipeg Jets to Phoenix (1996) and the Hartford Whalers to North Carolina (1997). This move towards southern markets was heavily criticized as well, however, with fans in Canada and the Northern United States lamenting the move away from \\"traditional hockey markets\\". Critics have also accused Bettman of having an \\"anti-Canadian\\" agenda, citing the relocation of the franchises in Quebec City and Winnipeg and his apparent refusal to help stop it, along with the aborted sale of the Nashville Predators in 2007 to interests that would have moved the team to Hamilton, Ontario. Jim Balsillie accused Bettman of forcing the Predators to end negotiations with him to purchase the team. Bettman was satirized in this vein as the character \\"Harry Buttman\\" in the 2006 Canadian movie Bon Cop, Bad Cop. However, Bettman also championed the Canadian assistance plan, a revenue sharing agreement that saw American teams give money to help support the four small-market Canadian teams ‚Äì Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa, and Vancouver ‚Äì throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. The results of expanding to southern markets has been mixed. There has been significant growth in the sport of hockey at the grassroots level with children in the U.S. South playing the game in increasing numbers. However, some of these southern teams have not been financially successful. The Phoenix Coyotes eventually filed for bankruptcy in May 2009, after incurring several hundred million dollars of losses since their 1996 move from Winnipeg. Under Bettman, the league then took control over the team later that year in order to stabilize the club's operations and then resell it to a new owner who would be committed to stay in the Phoenix market. It took several years for the League to find a viable ownership group. After joining the league in 1999, the Atlanta Thrashers suffered financial losses and ownership struggles, while only appearing in the playoffs just once. They were eventually sold to True North Sports and Entertainment in 2011, who then relocated the team to Winnipeg, a stark reversal of the league's attempts to expand into the southern markets. During the late 1990s round of expansion, the league revised its four division alignment into one containing six divisions that eventually each contained five teams. At the time, seventeen of the league's thirty teams were based in the Eastern Time Zone, meaning that the two westernmost such teams (Detroit Red Wings and Columbus Blue Jackets) were compelled to compete in the Western Conference, which gave a large proportion of their road games an unfavorably late start on local television. There were other grievances with the alignment ‚Äì for example, the Dallas Stars, being in the Central Time Zone were not pleased to be in the same division as the Coyotes and the three Californian teams. Detroit and Columbus were fierce opponents of Balsillie's bids for a team in Hamilton (proposals which would have seen another team added to the Eastern Time Zone) but also strong backers of Winnipeg's bid for the Thrashers, largely since this took the franchise out of the Eastern Time Zone and thus provided them a path to be realigned into the Eastern Conference. Following intense negotiations brokered by Bettman among the owners and with the players, the NHL reverted to a four- division alignment in time for the 2013‚Äì14 season, with two divisions of seven teams each for the West and two divisions containing the sixteen remaining Eastern Time Zone teams for the East. An expansion occurred in the summer of 2017, with Las Vegas, Nevada, gaining the league's 31st team, the Vegas Golden Knights. Bettman later explained that the NHL's new divisional alignment precluded the adding of more franchises in the Eastern Time Zone at least for the time being. The most recent expansion occurred on December 4, 2018, with the announcement that Seattle would be the league's 32nd team. The team will start in the 2021‚Äì22 NHL season. Bettman chose Seattle as it is one of the fastest growing cities. Labour unrest Although Bettman was tasked with putting an end to the NHL's labour problems, the league has locked out its players three times during Bettman's tenure. =1994‚Äì95 lockout= The 1994‚Äì95 lockout lasted 104 days, causing the season to be shortened from 84 to 48 games. A key issue during the lockout was the desire to aid small-market teams. Led by Bettman, the owners insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries, the union instead proposed a luxury tax system. The negotiations were at times bitter, with Chris Chelios famously issuing a veiled threat against Bettman, suggesting that Bettman should be \\"worried about [his] family and [his] well- being\\", because \\"Some crazed fans, or even a player [...] might take matters into their own hands and figure they get Bettman out of the way.\\" Last-ditch negotiations saved the season in January 1995. And while the owners failed to achieve a full salary cap, the union agreed to a cap on rookie contracts; changes to arbitration and restrictive rules for free agency that would not grant a player unrestricted free agency until he turned 31. The deal was initially hailed as a win for the owners. =2004‚Äì05 lockout= By the end of the deal in 2004, the owners were claiming that player salaries had grown far faster than revenues, and that the league as a whole lost over US$300 million in 2002‚Äì03. As a result, on September 15, 2004, Bettman announced that the owners again locked the players out prior to the start of the 2004‚Äì05 season. Five months later, Bettman announced the cancellation of the entire season: The NHL therefore became the first North American professional sports league to cancel an entire season because of a labour stoppage, and the second league to cancel a postseason (the first being Major League Baseball, which lost its postseason in 1994 due to a strike). As in 1994, the owners' position was predicated around the need for a salary cap. In an effort to ensure solidarity amongst the owners, the league's governors voted to give Bettman the right to unilaterally veto any union offer as long as he had the backing of just eight owners. The players initially favored luxury tax system, and a 5% rollback on player salaries‚Äîlater increased to 24 percent. As the threat of a canceled season loomed, the players agreed to accept a salary cap, but the two sides could not come to terms on numbers before the deadline expired. Following the cancellation of the season, negotiations progressed quickly, as a revolt within the union led to National Hockey League Players Association president Trevor Linden and senior director Ted Saskin taking negotiations over from executive director Bob Goodenow. Goodenow would resign from the NHLPA in July 2005. By early July, the two sides had agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement. The deal featured a hard salary cap, linked to a fixed percentage of league revenues, a 24% rollback on salaries, and free agency beginning after seven years of service. After being panned as one of the worst managers in business in 2004 for canceling the season, Bettman was lauded as one of the best in 2005 for his role in bringing \\"cost certainty\\" to the NHL. =2012‚Äì13 lockout= The 2012‚Äì13 NHL lockout lasted from September 15, 2012 to January 19, 2013, after the owners and players failed to agree on a new collective bargaining agreement. The owners' original offer retained the framework established following the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout but made numerous changes to player salary and movement rights, including reducing the players' share of hockey-related revenues from 57 percent to 46 percent, introduce term limits on contracts, eliminate salary arbitration, and change free agency rules. As the deadline for work stoppage approached, the union unsuccessfully challenged the league's ability to lock out players of the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers (appealing to the Alberta Labour Relations Board), and the Montreal Canadiens (appealing to the Quebec Labour Relations Board). After unsuccessful negotiations, the NHL and NHLPA agreed to mediation under the auspices of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service on November 26.McGran, Kevin (November 26, 2012). NHL lockout: Mediators called in for meetings this week. The Hamilton Spectator. Retrieved November 26, 2012.

ESPN. November 29, 2012. Retrieved November 29, 2012. After talks broke down again in December, rumours leaked that the NHLPA planned on filing a \\"disclaimer of interest\\" (a quicker, less formal way to dissolve the player's union, compared with decertification) and, with collective bargaining no longer in effect, pursuing an antitrust lawsuit against the NHL. The NHL responded on December 14 by filing a class action suit with the U.S. District Court in New York seeking to establish that its lockout is legal. Included in the lawsuit was a request for all existing player contracts to be \\"void and unenforceable\\", should the NHLPA be dissolved, resulting in all NHL players becoming free agents.\\"NHL will seek to cancel contracts if NHLPA dissolves\\". Toronto Sun. December 15, 2012. Retrieved December 16, 2012.

On January 6, 2013, a tentative deal was reached on a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout.NHL lockout timeline: Let's remember the whole nightmare SB Nation The terms included a limit of eight years on contract extensions and seven years on new contracts, a salary floor of US$44 million and a salary cap of US$60 million (a two-year transition period will allow teams to spend up to US$70.2 million in the deal's first season, prorated for the season length, and up to a salary cap of US$64.3 million in the second season), a maximum 50-percent variance in the salaries over the course of a contract, mandatory acceptance of arbitration awards under US$3.5 million, no realignment, and an amnesty period to buy out contracts that do not fit under the salary cap.Wyshinski, Greg (January 6, 2013). NHL lockout deal details: League moves on salary cap, limits player contracts. Yahoo! Sports. Retrieved January 6, 2013. After the union ratified the deal, the lockout officially ended. A 48-game regular season schedule was then played, starting on January 19, 2013 and ending on April 28, 2013, with no inter-conference games. Despite the lockout, the average attendance for the season was 17,768, up 2.6 percent from the previous year, while TV ratings in both Canada and the United States also increased.\\"Despite Lockout, Fans of N.H.L. Have Tuned In\\". nytimes.com. June 22, 2013. Retrieved June 25, 2013. Television Bettman quickly accomplished one of his stated goals, signing a five-year, $155 million deal with the Fox Broadcasting Company to broadcast NHL games nationally in the U.S. beginning in the 1994‚Äì95 season. The deal was significant, as a network television contract in the United States was long thought unattainable during the presidency of John Ziegler. The Fox deal is perhaps best remembered for the FoxTrax puck, which while generally popular according to Fox Sports, generated a great deal of controversy from longtime fans of the game. Canadians were also upset as the league gave preference to Fox ahead of CBC for scheduling of playoff games, as Pat Hickey of the Montreal Gazette wrote that the schedule was \\"just another example of how the N.H.L. snubs its nose at the country that invented hockey and its fans.\\" The controversy repeated itself in 2007, as CBC was once again given second billing to Versus' coverage of the playoffs. Despite falling ratings, Bettman negotiated a five-year, $600 million deal with ABC and ESPN in 1998. It was the largest television contract the NHL ever signed. The $120 million per year that ABC and ESPN paid for rights dwarfed the $5.5 million that the NHL received from American national broadcasts in 1991‚Äì92. The NHL's television fortunes faded after the ABC/ESPN deal. In 2004, the league could manage a revenue sharing deal with only NBC, with no money paid up front by the network. Also, coming out of the lockout, ESPN declined its $60 million option for the NHL's cable rights in 2005‚Äì06. While wishing to retain the NHL, it stated the cost was overvalued. However, Bettman was able to negotiate a deal with Comcast to air the NHL on the Outdoor Life Network channel, which was later renamed Versus in 2006. The three-year deal was worth $207.5 million. Bettman has been heavily criticized for the move to Versus, as detractors have argued that the league has lost a great deal of exposure since moving to the much smaller network. The TV deal with Versus was later extended through the 2010‚Äì11 season. In January 2011, Comcast officially acquired NBC Universal, and then in April of that year Bettman negotiated a new 10-year deal with the merged media company, worth nearly $2 billion. Comcast/NBC also announced that both Versus and NBC would increase its number of games. In signing this new TV deal, Bettman rejected offers from ESPN and others. Reaction to this new TV deal was mixed, noting that the NHL still lacks the exposure that ESPN can provide, while at the same time acknowledging that ESPN might not devote as much attention and promotion as Comcast/NBC would since the former is committed to various other sports properties. Comcast/NBC then renamed Versus as the NBC Sports Network on January 2, 2012. On November 26, 2013, Bettman and NHL announced that it had sold twelve seasons' worth of exclusive Canadian national broadcast rights to Rogers Media, who would broadcast games across its numerous platforms, including Sportsnet, Sportsnet One, and City, from at a price of C$5.2 billion. Hockey Night in Canada would continue on the CBC for the next four seasons, but under a sub-licensing deal the public broadcaster would give Rogers free airtime to air the broadcasts. CBC would be allotted time during the broadcasts to promote its other programming. These moves left Bell Media and its TSN networks shut out of NHL broadcasts except for its regional properties. XM Satellite Radio Bettman hosts an hour-long weekly radio show on NHL Home Ice (XM 204). The show provides fans with an opportunity to speak directly with the commissioner and voice any questions, comments, or concerns related to ice hockey. NHL at the Olympic Games The NHL first participated in ice hockey at the Olympic Games in the 1998 tournament in Nagano. The hockey tournament has since become one of the biggest and most profitable events at the Olympics. Bettman spoke at the World Hockey Summit in 2010, and stated that being in the Olympics was a \\"mixed bag\\" for the NHL, and its experiences outside of North America tended not to be positive. He gave a list of issues that he wanted to see resolved in consultation with the National Hockey League Players' Association, which included more control over marketing and promotion, timing of games being televised in North America, the hiatus in the NHL regular season schedule, ability for NHL team executives to access their players, travel concerns, and risk of injuries. Salary For the lockout-shortened 2012‚Äì13 season, Bettman received $8.8 million in total compensation by the NHL. By 2013‚Äì14, his salary had increased to $9.5 million, according to the NHL's filings with the Internal Revenue Service. For the 2008‚Äì09 season, Bettman was paid $7.23 million, of which $5,529,490 was his base salary. It was $3.77 million prior to the 2004‚Äì05 lockout. Public perception Bettman presents the Stanley Cup to Dustin Brown at the end of the 2012 Stanley Cup Finals Bettman's controversial decisions, as well as presiding over three labor stoppages, have made him unpopular among many NHL fans. He is regularly booed in various arenas around the league, ranging from his appearances at the yearly NHL Entry Draft to his annual presentation of the Stanley Cup to the league champions at the end of the playoffs. When asked if the booing ever bothers him, Bettman said, \\"Not doing this job, no. You're always going to have critics. What I've always told people: If I take the ice and it's completely silent, then I'll know I'm in trouble.\\" In another interview, he replied that he says to himself, \\"You know what, [the fans] got an opinion. We may not agree on everything, but they care, and I'll take that.\\" Still, writers such as Adam Proteau of The Hockey News and James O'Brien of NBC Sports' Pro Hockey Talk have advocated that someone else should hand out the Cup instead of Bettman so that the incessant booing does not spoil the ceremony. In 2013, the sports blog Grantland stated that Bettman's Cup presentations have \\"evolved into one of the most awkward traditions in all of sports\\". Playing upon those perceptions, 2006 Canadian movie Bon Cop, Bad Cop cast Rick Howland as \\"Harry Buttman\\", a Gary Bettman parody, a hockey league commissioner who wants to move Montreal's hockey team to Houston.

In April 2017, Bettman announced that the NHL would not be taking part in the 2018 Winter Olympics, a decision that was confirmed in November 2017 and was widely unpopular among players. Honours On May 21, 2014, Bettman was named \\"Sports Executive of the Year\\" by the SportsBusiness Journal and SportsBusiness Daily at the publications' annual Sports Business Awards event in New York. At the same ceremony, the NHL was named \\"Sports League of the Year\\", the second time in four years the NHL has been so honoured. The 2014 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic was named \\"Sports Event of the Year.\\" Bettman said, \\"It's almost an out-of-body experience. This time of year, I‚Äôm normally presenting a trophy and getting booed. To receive one and get applause is really quite novel.\\" CBS Sports hockey writer Chris Peters said, \\"There's no question the game has grown throughout the United States with participation in the sport at an all-time high, in addition to rising revenues for the NHL itself. The game is also reaching its best exposure through its TV deal with NBC Sports. That could be one of Bettman's crowning achievements. The remarkable thing about the NHL is that it remains incredibly strong, if not stronger coming out of two lockouts in the last decade. Gary Bettman‚Ä¶may not be perfect‚Ä¶but (he) is a good leader for the NHL and probably deserves some recognition for it.\\" In 2016, Bettman was inducted as a member of the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. Bettman is currently the longest- serving active commissioner in professional sports. In November 2018, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.
