Its rocky southern foreshore marks the boundary between England and Wales. Above high water mark, the island is reckoned administratively to Monmouthshire, South Wales. The island also marks the north-western limit of the City of Bristol's water boundary in the Severn estuary. It is located approximately three miles north of Portishead, midway between Redwick in Wales and Avonmouth in England. It is surrounded by sandbanks known as the Welsh Grounds. Its foreshore area changes dramatically according to the state of the tide, because tides in the estuary and Bristol Channel are amongst the highest in the world, reaching at the spring equinox. It is known as a nesting-place for gulls, cormorants and other seabirds, which are regularly seen and ringed there.  History  Denny Island appears in the historical record for the first time as Dunye, in the charter recording the creation of the county of Bristol in 1373. This suggests that the name means, in Old English, 'island shaped like a down (i.e. a hill with a rounded profile)'. It gives its name to the Denny Island Fault Zone, a part of the Avon-Solent Fracture zone. In 2004, the island was subject to an unsuccessful appeal under Section 6(1) of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 against it appearing on a map of registered common land.

He co- founded Veritas Genetics and its European and Latin American subsidiary, Veritas Intercontinental, with the idea of bringing the benefits of genomic data to millions of people globally. Research Church is known for his professional contributions in the sequencing of genomes and interpreting such data, in synthetic biology and genome engineering, and in an emerging area of neuroscience that proposes to map brain activity and establish a \\"functional connectome.\\" Among these, Church is known for pioneering the specialized fields of personal genomics and synthetic biology. He has co-founded commercial concerns spanning these areas, and others from green and natural products chemistry to infectious agent testing and fuel production, including Knome, LS9, and Joule Unlimited (respectively, human genomics, green chemistry, and solar fuel companies). , according to Google Scholar, his most cited research has been published in peer reviewed scientific journals including PNAS, Nature Genetics, nature reviews genetics the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference, Nature Biotechnology, Science, the Journal of Molecular Biology, the Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB) conference, the Journal of Bacteriology, Nature, Nature Methods, Genome Biology, Bioinformatics, PLOS Genetics, and Nucleic Acids Research. Genome sequencing and interpretation technologies With Walter Gilbert, Church published the first direct genomic sequencing method in 1984. Described in that publication were the cyclic application of fluids to a solid phase alternating with imaging, plus avoidance of bacterial cloning, strategies that are still used in current dominant Next-Generation Sequencing technologies. These technologies began to affect genome-scale sequencing in 2005. Church also helped initiate the Human Genome Project in 1984. He invented the broadly applied concepts of molecular multiplexing and barcode tags. Technology transfer from his Harvard laboratory of automated sequencing and software to Genome Therapeutics Corp. resulted in the first bacterial genome sequence and first commercial genome (the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori) in 1994. Church was also co-inventor of nanopore sequencing in 1995, which are now commercially available (e.g. Oxford Nanopore Technologies), but not in the form embodied in Church's contribution to the original patents. To aid in the interpretation and sharing of genomes, Church, in 2005, initiated the Personal Genome Project (PGP), which provides the world's only open-access human genome and trait data sets. Eight trios (mother, father, and child) from the Personal Genome Project are in the process of being chosen to act as the primary genome standards (Reference Materials) for the NIST+FDA genomeinabottle.org program. To further advance personal genomics and sharing of genomic data, in 2018 Church co-founded Nebula Genomics, a company that uses blockchain and privacy-preserving computing to make genomic data available to medical researchers, while maintaining privacy. In February 2020, Nebula Genomics started offering personal genome sequencing for $299. Synthetic biology and genome engineering He has co-developed \\"genome engineering\\" technologies since 1997 via either general homologous recombination (recA and lambda-red) or via sequence-specific nucleases. Since 2004, his team has developed use of DNA array (aka DNA chip) synthesizers for combinatorial libraries and assembling large genome segments. He co-developed Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) and optimized CRISPR/Cas9 discovered by Jennifer Doudna and Emanuelle Charpentier for engineering a variety of genomes ranging from yeast to human. His laboratory's use of CRISPR in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS) is the latest contender for precise gene therapy. His team is the first to tackle a genome-scale change in the genetic code. This was done in a 4.7 million basepair genome of an industrially useful microbe (E. coli) with the goal of making a safer and more productive strain; this strain uses non-proteinogenic amino acids in proteins and is metabolically and genetically isolated from other species. He has co- invented several uses for DNA, including detectors for dark matter – Weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), anti-cancer \\"nano-robots\\", and strategies for digital data storage that are over a million times denser than conventional disk drives. Together with polymerase, DNA can be used to sense and store variation in photons, nucleotides, or ions.  The BRAIN initiative He was part of a team of six who, in a 2012 scientific commentary, proposed a Brain Activity Map, later named BRAIN Initiative (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies). They outlined specific experimental techniques that might be used to achieve what they termed a \\"functional connectome\\", as well as new technologies that will have to be developed in the course of the project, including wireless, minimally invasive methods to detect and manipulate neuronal activity, either utilizing microelectronics or synthetic biology. In one such proposed method, enzymatically produced DNA would serve as a \\"ticker tape record\\" of neuronal activity.  Woolly mammoth cloning  In March 2015, Church and his genetics research team at Harvard successfully copied some woolly mammoth genes into the genome of an Asian elephant. Using the CRISPR DNA editing technique, his group spliced genetic segments from frozen mammoth specimens, including genes from the ears, subcutaneous fat, and hair attributes, into the DNA of skin cells from a modern elephant. This marked the first time that woolly mammoth genes had been functionally active since the species became extinct. Their work has not been subject to peer review, however. Church stated that \\"Just making a DNA change isn't that meaningful. We want to read out the phenotypes.\\" To do that, the team plans to perform further tests to get the hybrid cells into becoming specialized tissues, and from there attempting to turn the hybrid elephant/mammoth skin cells into hybrid embryos that can be grown in artificial wombs. Technology transfer and translational impact Church has co-founded 22 companies, including Veritas Genetics (human genomics, 2014, with Mirza Cifric, Preston Estep, Yining Zhao, Joe Thakuria), Warp Drive Bio (natural products, 2011, with Greg Verdine and James Wells), Alacris (cancer systems therapeutics, 2010, with Hans Lehrach, Bernhard Herrmann, and Shahid Imran), Knome (human genomics, 2007, with Jorge Conde and Sundar Subramaniam), Pathogenica (microbe and viral NGS diagnostics, 2009, with Yemi Adesokan), AbVitro (immunomes, 2010, with Francois Vigneault), Gen9 Bio (synthetic biology, 2009, with Joseph Jacobson and Drew Endy), EnEvolv (Genome Engineering), Joule Unlimited (SolarFuels, 2007, with Noubar Afeyan and David Berry), and LS9 (green chemistry, 2005, with Chris Somerville, Jay Keasling, Vinod Khosla, Noubar Afeyan, and David Berry) He has participated in technology development, licensing patents and advising most of the Next-Generation Sequencing companies, including Complete Genomics, Life Technologies, Illumina, Danaher Corporation, Roche Diagnostics, Pacific Biosciences, Genia, and Nabsys. He was on the Scientific Advisory Board of Cambrian Genomics Support of open consent Church spearheaded the concept and implementation of open access sequencing hardware and shareable human medical data. He has noted the potential for re-identification of human research participants and the tendency for consent forms to be opaque – proposing an alternative \\"open consent\\" mechanism. He has participated in the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, cautioning about the risk of synthetic DNA and proposing risk-reduction via licensing and surveillance. His laboratory has a major bio-safety engineering focus. TED 2010, picture by Steve Jurvetson. Support of open education He has been an early advocate of online, open education since 2002. He is advisor to the Personal Genetics Education Project and has spent a day teaching at The Jemicy School. He has championed citizen science, especially in the fields of synthetic biology and personal genomics. Since 2008, his team has been hosting an annual Genomes, Environments and Traits (GET) Conference with free online videos. Controversies Harvard and MIT geneticist George Church lists the nonprofit Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, a private foundation established by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as a source of funding. According to George Church's Harvard website, this funding started in 2005 and continued to 2007. Church's Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation affiliation is listed as for cutting edge science & education. Church met with Epstein many times after Epstein's 2008 conviction. In his 2019 apology for \\"poor awareness\\" of Epstein's sex offender status, Church said he had \\"nerd tunnel vision\\" and articles on Epstein's crimes were unclear, placing responsibility on vetting donors on the development office. Controversy found Church in early 2013, in response to his spoken speculations as to what was required to engineer the birth of a Neanderthal. In response to a question from Der Spiegel, Church speculated that it could be technically possible to make a Neanderthal by reconstructing the DNA of a Neanderthal and modifying living human cells accordingly. Church pointed out that he was not working on such a project. Popular science In his science and popular efforts, Church has also promoted open access genome sequencing and shareable human medical data, as well as online, open education and citizen science.

In September 2010, Dr Church was honored for his work in genetics with the Mass High Tech All-Star Award. He is a member of the Research Advisory Board of SENS Research Foundation. Personal life Church is married to fellow Harvard Medical School faculty member in genetics Ting Wu. Church has been outspoken in his support of following a vegan lifestyle, for reasons concerned with health, and with environmental and moral issues. When asked about his dietary choice, Church replied, \\"I've been vegan off-and-on since 1974 when I was inspired by participating in an MIT nutritional study, and quite strictly since 2004.\\" He goes on to elaborate 4 reasons: > \\"medical (cholesterol in fish & dairy), energy conservation (up to 20-fold > impact), cruelty (\\"organic\\" animals are deprived of medicines that humans > use), and risks of spreading pathogens (not just the flu)… [noting that] > veganism is an issue for which personal and global love of life, health and > wealth align. It's a pity to lose parts of our humanity and planet just due > to a lack of recipes.\\" George identifies as a sentientist. Sentientism is a naturalistic worldview that grants moral consideration to all sentient beings. In the context of the Personal Genome Project, journalists at Forbes and Wired have noted Church's openness about his health issues, including dyslexia, narcolepsy, and high cholesterol (one of the motivations for his vegan diet).

Upon graduating high school, he studied music at The College of Idaho from 1923 to 1925 before he was accepted into the Bush Conservatory of Music in Chicago, Illinois. His abilities in theory and composition earned him a scholarship to study music theory at Juilliard, however, it is unclear if he ever pursued this invitation. Smith spent much of his life working at Disney as composer for many of its films' scores, animated and live-action alike, movie and television alike; from 1962 to 1963, he also composed music for Leave It to Beaver. In Fantasia, he is one of the studio employees in the orchestra. He also composed the scores for several of the True-Life Adventures episodes. In 1950, Smith and Oliver Wallace composed the musical score of Disney's Cinderella. Smith's main collaborator and partner was Hazel \\"Gil\\" George, who wrote the song title for The Light in the Forest with him and Lawrence Edward Watkin. Another one of Smith's collaborator was George Bruns who worked with him on films like Westward Ho the Wagons!.

Biography Waldman was born in São Paulo on 2 December 1955, to a Jewish family originally from Poland and Italy. As an activist, he collaborated with Chico Mendes and several organizations, including Comitê de Apoio aos Povos da Floresta (Forest People Committee), the African Studies Centre of São Paulo University (USP), and Centro Ecumênico de Documentação e Informação – CEDI (Ecumenical Centre of Documentation and Information, in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro). He also participated in activist movements against dams, anti-nuclear demonstrations, and especially against water pollution in São Paulo. From the 1980s to 1992, Waldman was an active member of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), working on political papers and as a party organizer. He founded the PT Jewish Committee (1988) and Ecological Commission (1989). He also became involved in the Executive branch of government as Chico Mendes Park's Coordinator in the east of São Paulo (1990) and Environmentalist Administrator in São Bernardo do Campo (1991–1992), a city in the ABC Region, the industrial region next to São Paulo where PT began. However, anti-ecological measures taken by the city administration and members of the party created a serious conflict between Waldman and the mayor, and in 1992 he left the PT and returned to the university and to his professional life. Waldman received his Anthropology M.Sc. degree from USP in 1997. He became Director of the Children Homeless’ School of São Paulo in 1998, Director of the Fundação Estadual do Bem Estar do Menor' School in 1999, coordinator of São Paulo Recycling Service in 2000, and Editor of the Brazilian Geographers' Association (AGB) São Paulo Sector from 2002 to 2003. Waldman launching his last book Lixo: Cenários e Desafios. São Paulo International Book Fair, 2010 Waldman received his Ph.D. degree from the Geography Department of USP in 2006. His thesis, \\"Water and Metropolis: Limits and Expectations of the Time\\", is one of the most detailed academic works on Brazilian water resources and Water management in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. Subsequently, with the support of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Waldman conducted post- doctoral research from 2010 to 2011 at the Geography Department of the Geoscyenses Institute at the University of Campinas. This research, focused on municipal solid waste in Brazil, led to several papers and lectures, and finally a book, Lixo: Cenários e Desafios (\\"Waste: Scenarios and Challenges\\"), launched in August 2010 at São Paulo International Book Fair. In September 2011, this book was selected as a finalist of the Prêmio Jabuti literary awards. Also in 2011, Waldman began his second Postdoctoral Research project, at USP's Faculty of Philosophy, Languages-Literature and Human Sciences (FFLCH-USP). The focus of this research was the Angolan basin management policy, evaluating the role of Angola in Southern-Central Africa's hydro resources, in terms of International Relations. This Postdoctoral Research was linked to the FFLCH-USP Sociology Department and supported by São Paulo State's Foundation for Research Support. This work took place under the supervision of Professor Fernando Augusto Albuquerque Mourão, a Brazilian Africanist and expert in International Relations and Multilateralism. In December 2013 Waldman finished this research, and began a third Postdoctoral Research project, again supported by CNPq. The focus of this project was the incineration of municipal solid waste, recycling management policies and the Waste picker movement, and it concluded in December 2015. In 2016 Mauricio Waldman founded the Kotev publishing house in São Paulo, intending to launch e-books and e-texts on the Kobo platform. He has contributed articles to magazines Cultura Verde, and Ambiente Urbano, among others, and is a columnist for the O Imparcial, Think & Rethink Column. He has also written a large number of papers, scientific and technical reports, e-books and e-papers, articles, and essays, and given lectures at a variety of conferences and universities. He has translated work by authors such as Michael Shellenberger, Joan Martinez Allier and Diané Collinson. Books *Água: Escassez e Coflitos no Império da Sede. Coleção Água em Foco, Nº. 1.

The term is Old Irish, and derives from the word déis, meaning \\"vassal\\" or \\"subject\\"; in its original sense, it designated groups who were vassals or rent-payers to a landowner.Ó Cathasaigh, pp. 1-33. Later, it became a proper name for certain septs and their own subjects throughout Ireland.MacNeill, pp. 1-41. The various peoples listed under the heading déis shared the same status in Gaelic Ireland, and had little or no actual kinship, though they were often thought of as genetically related. Déisi groups included the Déisi Muman (the Déisi of Munster), Déisi Temro (of Tara), Déisi Becc (located in the Kingdom of Mide) and the Déisi Tuisceart (the Northern Déisi; a sept of which would become famous as the Dál gCais). During the Early Middle Ages some Déisi groups and subgroups exerted great political influence in various parts of Ireland, and certain written sources suggest a connection to Britain as well. During early medieval Munster, the Déisi were under the hegemony of the Eoganachta confederacy. History and contexts The early histories of the Déisi groups are obscure. As a class that evolved from peoples tied by social status rather than kinship, groups had largely independent histories in different parts of Ireland. While some medieval texts attempt to give the Déisi an aristocratic origin, these are later fabrications dating to the period after the Déisi had gained political power.Ó Cathasaigh, pp. 3-5, 22-24 Despite their tributary origins, representatives of at least one Déisi population would eventually achieve spectacular success, founding a powerful medieval dynasty which is still in existence. There were a number of different groups called Déisi, from south-west counties Waterford and Tipperary (Déisi Muman), up to north- westwards counties Limerick and Clare (Déis Becc). Déisi Muman 240px The Déisi Muman were a prominent enough power to form their own regional kingdom in Munster from a fairly early date. In a recent title, Paul MacCotter states \\"The regional kingdom of Déisi Muman must have existed in roughly its present location from a very early period. Oghams dating perhaps from the fifth century record unique first names associated with its kings.\\"MacCotter 2008, p. 245. According to Francis John Byrne, there are certain inscriptional hints that both the Eóganachta and their Waterford Déisi vassals may have been of fairly recent Gaulish origins.Byrne 2001, p. 72. The ancestors of the Eóganachta are known as the Deirgtine and they are also believed to have been active in Roman Britain, one piece of evidence being the name of their capital Cashel, thought to be inspired by the Roman castella they observed on raids.Byrne 2001, pp. 72, 184. The Déisi Muman enjoyed a position in the later Eóganachta overkingdom suggesting of a special relationship. Byrne mentions it was noticed by Eoin MacNeill that a number of the early names in the Eóganachta pedigrees are found in oghams in the Déisi country of Waterford, among them Nia Segamain (NETASEGAMONAS), after the Gaulish war god Segomo.Byrne 2001, p. 182 According to MacNeill, the Waterford Déisi and the Eóganachta at Cashel \\"cannot well be disconnected\\".MacNeill 1911, p. 73 The Uí Liatháin dynasty were western neighbors of the proto-Déisi Muman along the southern Irish coast and raided and colonized parts western Britain. They are the best characterized of the South Irish colonists because of clear references to them by name in both early Irish and early British sources, while a presence of the Déisi Muman cannot actually be confirmed.The Uí Liatháin and their colonies are mentioned in the Irish Cormac's Glossary and the British Historia Brittonum (ch. 14); neither source mentions the Déisi. See Charles-Edwards, p. 163. Also noted are the Laigin, particularly in North Wales.Ó Corráin 2001, p. 6 =Possible presence in Britain= The Déisi Muman are the subjects of one of the most famous medieval Irish epic tales, The Expulsion of the Déisi.Meyer, pp. 101–135. This literary work, first written sometime in the 8th century, is a pseudo-historical foundation legend for the medieval Kingdom of Déisi Muman, which seeks to hide the historical reality that the kingdom's origins lay among the indigenous tributary peoples of Munster. To this end it attributes to \\"the Déisi\\" an entirely fictive royal ancestry at Tara. The term \\"Déisi\\" is used anachronistically in The Expulsion of the Déisi, since its chronologically confused narrative concerns \\"events\\" that long predate the historical development of déisi communities into distinct tribal polities or the creation of the kingdom of Déisi Muman. The epic tells the story of a sept called the Dal Fiachach Suighe, who are expelled from Tara by their kinsman, Cormac mac Airt, and forced to wander homeless. After a southward migration and many battles, part of the sept eventually settles in Munster. At some point during this migration from Tara to Munster, one branch of the sept, led by Eochaid Allmuir mac Art Corb, sails across the sea to Britain where, it is said, his descendants later ruled in Demed, the former territory of the Demetae (modern Dyfed). The Expulsion of the Déisi is the only direct source for this \\"event\\". The historicity of this particular passage of the epic apparently receives partial \\"confirmation\\" from a pedigree preserved in the late 10th-century Harleian genealogies, in which the contemporary kings of Dyfed claim descent from Triphun (fl. 450), a great- grandson of Eochaid Allmuir, although the Harleian genealogy itself presents an entirely different version of Triphun's own ancestry in which he descends from a Roman imperial line traced back to St. Helena, whose alleged British origin the genealogist stresses. Harleian genealogy 2. This manifest fiction apparently reflects a later attempt to fabricate a more illustrious and/or indigenous lineage for the Dyfed dynasty, especially as other Welsh genealogical material partially confirms the Irish descent of Triphun.Bartrum, pp. 45, 106; Dumville, pp. 172-93; Miller, pp. 37-40; Coplestone-Crow, p. 17-18; Ó Cathasaigh, pp. 19-22; Rance, pp. 252-3, 263-6. If the relocation of some of the \\"Déisi\\" to Dyfed is indeed historical, it is unclear whether it entailed a large-scale tribal migration or merely a dynastic transfer, or both as part of a multi-phase population movement.Coplestone-Crow, pp. 1-24; Ó Cathasaigh pp. 1-33. However this movement is characterised, scholarship has demonstrated that it cannot have taken place as early as the date implied in The Expulsion of the Déisi (i.e. shortly after the blinding of Cormac mac Airt, traditionally dated AD 265), but must have begun during the second half of the 4th century at the earliest,Pender (1947), pp. 206-17; Bartrum, p. 124; Coplestone-Crow, pp. 1-24; Ó Cathasaigh, pp. 11-12; Rance, pp. 255-6. while commencement in the sub-Roman period in the early 5th century cannot be excluded.Miller, pp. 33-61 It is further entirely possible that the historians and genealogists of the Déisi Muman were guilty of lifting these \\"verified\\" ancestors, who could have originally belonged to another Irish kindred entirely. Genealogical feats of this kind were famously performed by the Déisi Tuisceart or \\"Dál gCais\\". The term déisi is also virtually interchangeable with another Old Irish term, aithechthúatha (meaning \\"rent-paying tribes\\", \\"vassal communities\\" or \\"tributary peoples\\"). From the 18th century it had been suggested that this term might be the origin of the Attacotti who are reported attacking Roman Britain in the 360s, although the argument has been doubted on etymological grounds. This argument has recently been reopened, however, by a proposed equation of déisi – aithechthúatha – Attacotti in a late 4th-century context.Rance, pp. 243–270. Finally, MacNeill discusses the movements of the Uí Liatháin mentioned above at considerable length, arguing their leadership in the South Irish conquests and founding of the later dynasty of Brycheiniog, figures in the Welsh genealogies matching Uí Liatháin dynasts in the Irish genealogies. He argues any possible settlement of the Déisi would have been subordinate until the ousting of the Uí Liatháin by the sons of Cunedda.MacNeill 1926, pp. 128-32 Déisi Tuisceart Byrne later discusses how the rise of the Dál gCais sept of Déisi Tuisceart in North Munster at the expense of the Eóganachta was not unlike the rise of that dynasty at the expense of the Dáirine several centuries before, and this may in fact have been the inspiration for Dál gCais claims.Byrne, pp. 180-1. An earlier and frequently cited argument by John V. Kelleher is that this was a political scheme of the Uí Néill, Ireland's most dominant dynasty, whom he argues created the Kingdom of Thomond in the 10th century to further weaken the position of the already divided Eóganachta.Kelleher, pp. 230-41. If true, the Uí Néill were creating who would soon become their greatest military rivals in nearly the last four centuries, threatening Tara as much as Cashel. The Déisi Muman, on the other hand, remained prominent supporters of the Eóganachta throughout their career. The movement of the Déisi Tuisceart into the modern County Clare is not documented, but it is commonly associated with the \\"annex\\" of the region to Munster after the decline of Uí Fiachrach Aidhne power in south Connacht. Byrne suggests this dates from the victory of the king of Cashel, Faílbe Flann mac Áedo Duib, over the celebrated king of Connacht Guaire Aidne mac Colmáin at the Battle of Carn Feradaig in 627.Byrne, p. 239 A famous early 12th-century propaganda text detailing the rise of the Dál gCais is the Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib.Ed. & tr.

It is regarded as the world's oldest art fair of its kind. The fair runs for six days and brings together galleries from more than 20 countries at the Cologne Exhibition Centre, one of the world’s largest exhibition centers.Laurie Rojas (April 16, 2015), Sweet smell of success for reborn Art Cologne The Art Newspaper. It is open to the public and attracts about 60,000 visitors.http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/37333/when-in-cologne-for- art-cologne/  Background  The Art Cologne was the first art fair organized by and for commercial galleries to exhibit and sell Modern and Contemporary art. This kind of art fair distinguished itself from earlier art fairs such as the 57th Street Art Fair in Chicago or the Ann Arbor Art Fairs in Michigan, in which artists themselves marketed their works directly to the public from stands set-up in the streets. The Art Cologne and other international art fairs that followed offer private galleries conditions similar to their own back home: booths in buildings enabling them to present art works of high value.  History  catalogue cover The Kölner Kunstmarkt was founded by gallerists Hein Stünke and Rudolph Zwirner in 1967 in an attempt to reinvigorate the weak market for contemporary art. With Bonn as the new capital city of Germany, the Rhineland – an industrial powerhouse at the centre of Europe driving the West German economy and acting as a hub for the entire western European economy – took over as the centre of the West German art world. The first Kölner Kunstmarkt took place in the Gürzenich festival hall in the medieval part of the city; the following year Kunsthalle Köln was added as an additional location. The fair helped to establish Cologne as a new center of contemporary art. A West German dealer and a West German artist set new records at the 1969 edition of Kölner Kunstmarkt: René Block sold a work by Joseph Beuys – known later as Das Rudel – at DM 110,000, making Beuys the first West German artist to beat the one-hundred-thousand-mark mark. In 1974, Art Cologne moved to its current location, the tradeshow halls at the district of Deutz. On this occasion the name was changed to Internationaler Kunstmarkt (IKM). Between 1976 and 1983, the fair alternated between Cologne and Düsseldorf and began to establish its international credentials.Melanie Gerlis (April 12, 2016), Fifty editions on, can Art Cologne regain top billing? The Art Newspaper. Today's name Art Cologne was adopted in 1984.

With the emergence of the Berlin art scene, a bevy of remedies — special events and exhibitions, prizes and promotional gags — were devised to rejuvenate the fair, but they proved of little avail. An unattractive shift of venue within the fairgrounds and a change of dates from autumn to spring only exaggerated the unease of public and professionals alike. In 2007, the fair was moved to April from the fall to avoid coinciding with other events. Still, Art Cologne drew just 60,000 visitors that year, 10,000 fewer than in 2006, and the 2008 edition had only 55,000 visitors.Catherine Hickley (April 21, 2008), Art Cologne Sells Picasso, Warhol, Kirchner as Visitors Decline Bloomberg.

Its cidery is located at Aspall Hall in the village of Aspall, Suffolk, England. It was bought by Molson Coors Beverage Company in 2018. History The business was originally established in the early-18th century. Production was based on apple trees initially introduced for the use of the Chevalliers of Aspall Hall, the owners of the estate, from their native Jersey. In 1946 the company was a founding member of the Soil Association. In addition to cider, Aspall also produce an unfermented apple juice, organic apple cider vinegar and apple-based balsamic vinegar. The company also imports and markets: Spanish Red wine vinegar and White Wine Vinegar, and an Italian Organic Balsamic Vinegar. On 7 January 2018, it was announced that the Aspall company had been sold to Molson Coors Brewing Company, ending 290 years of independently owned manufacturing. The deal is understood to give the company an enterprise value of £40m, although this figure includes debt (roughly £19m in 2016 accounts) and promise of investment from Molson.

The championships are held over a two-day period, with the skaters racing one 500 m and one 1,000 m each day. Since the higher speeds towards the end of the race tend to favour the skater who skates the last outer lane, each skater starts both distances once in the inner lane and once in the outer lane. The times on those distances are then converted to points using the samalog system, and the skaters are then ranked according to the fewest points. The International Skating Union has organised the World Sprint Championships for Men and the World Sprint Championships for Women since 1970 and both are held at the same time and venue. The first two years (1970-1971), they were called the ISU Sprint Championships. Medal winners=Combined all-time medal count=Notes # - Using the world record per 2012 as an example: at the world championships on 28/29 January 2012, Stefan Groothuis skated his 500 m races in 34.84 and 34.74 seconds, respectively, and his 1,000 m races in 1:07.50 and 1:06.96.

Sometimes called \\"earl\\", he is more surely the first recorded high-reeve of Bamburgh and the man who, after assisting in the death of its last independent ruler Erik Bloodaxe, administered the York-based Kingdom of Northumbria when it was taken over by the Wessex-based King Eadred of England in 954. Origins Osulf appears at least five times in witness lists for charters, some of which may be genuine, in the years 946, 949, and 950. In 946 and 949 he witnessed charters as \\"high reeve\\" Sawyer 520 (PASE) & Sawyer 544 (PASE) In 949 he witnessed an Evesham grant as well as a grant by King Eadred to Canterbury Cathedral as dux.Sawyer 550 (PASE) & Sawyer 546 (PASE) And in 950 an Osulf Bebbanburg is alleged to have witnessed as Eorl.Sawyer 552a (PASE) He is the first man specifically designated \\"high-reeve\\" of Bamburgh. High-reeve is Old English heah-gerefa, which Alfred Smyth thought was influenced by the Scottish word mormaer, which possibly has the same meaning (\\"High Steward\\").Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men, p. 235 Judging by the North People's Law, a high-reeve was not the same as an ealdorman (dux), having only half an ealdorman's wergild.Seebohm, Tribal Custom in Anglo-Saxon Law, p. 363; North People's Law (Halsall) Osulf's origins are unclear. A genealogy in the text De Northumbria post Britannos, recording the ancestry of Waltheof Earl of Northampton (and, briefly, Northumbria), suggests that Osulf was the son of Eadulf of Bamburgh, the ′King of the Northern English′ who died in 913.McGuigan, ′Ælla and the descendants of Ivar′, pp. 24–25. Richard Fletcher and David Rollason thought he might be the Osulf Dux who had witnessed charters further south in the 930s, which if true would extend Osulf's floruit back to 934.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, p. 42; Rollason, Northumbria, p. 266; see also Erik Bloodaxe and domination of all Northumbria Though Eadulf and Ealdred appear to have ruled Northumbria, in the years running up to 954 the kingdom was controlled by the Scandinavians Amlaíb Cuarán and Eric Bloodaxe.Costambeys, \\"Erik Bloodaxe\\"; Hudson, Viking Pirates, pp. 37—8 According to Roger of Wendover's Flores historiarum (early 13th century), Osulf was responsible for a conspiracy with a certain Maccus that led to the betrayal and death of Eric Bloodaxe, King of Northumbria, \\"in a certain lonely place called Stainmore\\".Forte, Oram and Pedersen, Viking Empires, p. 117 Following this, Osulf is said to have taken control of all Northumbria.Rollason, Northumbria, pp. 65—6 Although this part of the Flores historiarum was compiled centuries later and contains some obvious anachronisms, Roger of Wendover appears to have used certain earlier sources, no longer extant, which would add credibility to the story.Costambeys, \\"Erik Bloodaxe\\" The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle names King Eadred as the new ruler of Northumbria following the expulsion of Erik: > Her Norðhymbre fordrifon Yric, 7 Eadred feng to Norðhymbra rice > In this year the Northumbrians drove out Eric and Eadred succeeded to the > kingdom\\".ASC D (etc), s.a. 954 This is why Richard Fletcher thinks Osulf was working at Eadred's instigation, and that a grateful Eadred promoted Osulf ruler of the entire Northumbrian sub-kingdom.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, p. 41 However he got there, it was with Eadred's consent and overlordship, at least according to our sources. De primo Saxonum adventu summarises his status as follows: > Primus comitum post Eiricum, quem ultimum regem habuerunt Northymbrenses, > Osulf provincias omnes Northanhymbrorum sub Edrido rege procuravit. > First of the earls after Erik, the last king whom the Northumbrians had, > Osulf administered under King Eadred all the provinces of the > Northumbrians.Arnold (ed.), Symeonis Monachi Opera Omnia, vol. ii, p. 382; > trans. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 77 Similar sentiments were expressed in the related Historia Regum: \\"Here the kings of Northumbrians came to an end and henceforth the provinces was administered by earls\\".Quoted in Woolf, Pictland to Alba, p. 190 Eadred's takeover and Osulf's rule thus represent the beginning of permanent West Saxon control of the North. Historian Alex Woolf argued that this take-over was a personal union of crowns rather like that between Scotland and England in 1603.Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp. 190, 191 Death and legacy Little else is known about Osulf's period in power. The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says that in the time of Indulf (King of Scots from 954 to 962), Edinburgh was abandoned to the Scots, though nothing is said about the involvement of Northumbrians or Osulf.Smyth, Warlords, p. 232 The date of Osulf's death is not known. He was probably dead before 963, as that is the date Oslac appears for the first time as ealdorman in York.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, p. 44; Rollason, Northumbria, pp. 266—7 It is unclear whether Oslac was related to Osulf.Fletcher, Bloodfeud, p. 44 According to the De primo Saxonum adventu, Northumbria was divided into two parts after Osulf's death.Arnold (ed.), Symeonis Monachi Opera Omnia, vol. ii, p. 382 De Northumbria post Britannos says that Osulf had a son named Ealdred, father of Waltheof of Bamburgh (fl. 994), father of Uhtred of Northumbria.McGuigan, ′Ælla and the descendants of Ivar′, pp. 25, 33.

It was the first film made by Hecht and Lancaster's production company, Norma Productions. Plot Bill Saunders (Lancaster) is a former prisoner of war now living in England, whose experiences have left him unstable and violent. He gets into a bar fight in which he kills a man and then flees. He hides out with the assistance of a nurse, Jane Wharton (Joan Fontaine), who believes his story that the killing was an accident. Saunders is involved in another fight—this time with a police officer. He ends up behind bars, but Jane, who is now in love with Saunders, gets him a job driving a truck delivering drugs for her medical clinic when he's released. Meanwhile, hoodlum Harry Carter, who witnessed the earlier bar fight, threatens to expose Saunders to the police. In return for his silence, Carter demands that Saunders cooperate with a planned robbery of his next drug shipment. When Saunders does do the delivery, Jane rides with him, forcing Saunders to make the delivery as planned to avoid getting Jane involved in the possibly dangerous theft. This betrayal of Carter puts the lives of Saunders and Jane in even greater danger.

The Film Daily, trade magazine, Sept 8, 1947. Accessed: October 9, 2019. According to Hollywood Reporter news items, the film's title was to be changed from Kiss the Blood Off My Hands to the less graphic Blood on My Hands. A New York Times news item indicates that the PCA initially blocked the full title, but that decision was later overturned on appeal. During filming, Fontaine was absent for 12 days due to her pregnancy. Reception=Critical response When the film was released, The New York Times reviewer wrote: \\"Norman Foster has directed Kiss the Blood Off My Hands with keen appreciation for the story's emotional content and he has handled the scenes of violence with striking sharpness. The long chase that starts the film on its way, with Lancaster desperately racing through winding streets and alleyways of the London waterfront, vaulting fences and scrambling up on roofs, is high-tension excitement. Mr. Lancaster's performance is good, but he would do well to drop some of his tenseness and get more flexibility into his acting. Robert Newton, as a cockney schemer who witnessed the killing and attempts to blackmail Saunders, is somewhat flamboyant but still he gets over an effective characterization.\\" Fan magazine Modern Screen listed in as their Picture of the Month, while referencing some controversy, stating: \\"But there are those who will hold that it should never have been released. Some will say that while it does point a moral ...yet at the same time it presents as the main character a contemptible rat who, since impersonated by the glamorous Mr. Lancaster, may well be sympathetically looked upon by many impressionable young spectators as an attractively ruthless and possibly model fellow.\\" Radio Version Joan Fontaine and Burt Lancaster recreated their roles for the Lux Radio Theatre broadcast on February 21, 1949 under the title The Unafraid.

Typically, the protection is achieved by a process of surface finishing or treatment. Depending on mechanical wear or environmental conditions, the degradation may not be stopped completely, unless the process is periodically repeated. The term is particularly used in the automobile industry. Vehicle rustproofing=Factory In the factory, car bodies are protected with special chemical formulations. Typically, phosphate conversion coatings were used. Some firms galvanized part or all of their car bodies before the primer coat of paint was applied. If a car is body-on-frame, then the frame (chassis) must also be rustproofed. In traditional automotive manufacturing of the early- and mid-20th century, paint was the final part of the rustproofing barrier between the body shell and the atmosphere, except on the underside. On the underside, an underseal rubberized or PVC-based coating was often sprayed on. These products will be breached eventually and can lead to unseen corrosion that spreads underneath the underseal. Old 1960s and 1970s rubberized underseal can become brittle on older cars and is particularly liable to this. The first electrodeposition primer was developed in the 1950s, but were found to be impractical for widespread use. Revised cathodic automotive electrocoat primer systems were introduced in the 1970s that markedly reduced the problem of corrosion that had been experienced by a vast number of automobiles in the first seven decades of automobile manufacturing. Termed e-coat, \\"electrocoat automotive primers are applied by totally submerging the assembled car body in a large tank that contains the waterborne e-coat, and the coating is applied through cathodic electrodeposition. This assures nearly 100% coverage of all metal surfaces by the primer. The coating chemistry is waterborne enamel based on epoxy, an aminoalcohol adduct, and blocked isocyanate, which all crosslink on baking to form an epoxy-urethane resin system.\\" E-coat resin technology, combined with the excellent coverage provided by electrodeposition, provides one of the more effective coatings for protecting steel from corrosion. For modern automobile manufacturing after the 1990s, nearly all cars use e-coat technology as base foundation for their corrosion protection coating system. Aftermarket Aftermarket kits are available to apply rustproofing compounds both to external surfaces and inside enclosed sections, for example sills/rocker panels (see monocoque), through either existing or specially drilled holes. The compounds are usually wax-based and can be applied by aerosol can, brush, low pressure pump up spray, or compressor fed spray gun. An alternative for sills/rocker panels is to block drain holes and simply fill them up with wax and then drain most of it out (the excess can be stored and reused), leaving a complete coating inside. Anti-rust wax like phosphoric acid based rust killers/neutralizers can also be painted on already rusted areas. Loose or thick rust must be removed before anti-rust wax like Waxoyl or a similar product is used. Structural rust (affecting structural components which must withstand considerable forces) should be cut back to good metal and new metal welded in, or the affected part should be completely replaced. Wax may not penetrate spot-welded seams or thick rust effectively. A thinner (less viscous) mineral-oil-based anti-rust product followed by anti-rust wax can be more effective. Application is easier in hot weather rather than cold because even when pre-heated, the products are viscous and don't flow and penetrate well on cold metal. Aftermarket \\"underseals\\" can also be applied. They are particularly useful in high-impact areas like wheel arches. There are two types - drying and non-drying. The hardening and drying products are also known as \\"Shutz\\" and \\"Anti Stone Chip\\" with similar potential problems to the original factory underseals. These are available in black, white, grey and red colors and can be overpainted. These are best used for the area below the bumpers on cars that have painted metal body work in that location, rather than modern plastic deep bumpers. The bitumen based products do not dry and harden, so they cannot become brittle, like the confusingly named \\"Underbody Seal with added Waxoyl\\" made by Hammerite, which can be supplied in a Shutz type cartridge labelled \\"Shutz\\" for use with a Shutz compressor fed gun. Mercedes bodyshops use a similar product supplied by Mercedes-Benz. There are many manufacturers of similar products at varying prices, these are regularly group tested and reviewed in the classic car magazine press. The non drying types contain anti-rust chemicals similar to those in anti-rust waxes. Petroleum-based rust-inhibitors provide several benefits, including the ability to creep over metal, covering missed areas. Additionally, a petroleum, solvent-free rust inhibitor remains on the metal surface, sealing it from rust-accelerating water and oxygen. Other benefits of petroleum-based rust protection include the self-healing properties that come naturally to oils, which helps undercoatings to resist abrasion caused by road sand and other debris. The disadvantage of using a petroleum-based coating is the film left over on surfaces, rendering these products too messy for top side exterior application, and unsafe in areas where it can be slipped on. They also cannot be painted. There are aftermarket electronic \\"rustproofing\\" technologies claimed to prevent corrosion by \\"pushing\\" electrons into the car body, to limit the combination of oxygen and iron to form rust. The loss of electrons in paint is also claimed to be the cause of “paint oxidisation” and the electronic system is also supposed to protect the paint. However, there is no peer reviewed scientific testing and validation supporting the use of these devices and corrosion control professionals find they do not work.NACE International Article Electronic Rust Prevention Baboian, R., \\"State of the Art in Automobile Cathodic Protection,\\" SAE Technical Paper 912270, 1991, doi:10.4271/912270 Rate of corrosion The rate at which vehicles corrode is dependent upon: *Local climate and use of ice-melting chemicals (salt) upon the roads *Atmospheric pollution, such as acid rain or salt spray, which can cause paint damage *Quality, thickness, and composition of metal used, often an alloy of mild steel *Improper use of some dissimilar metals, which can accelerate the rusting of steel bodywork through electrolytic corrosion *Design of \\"rust traps\\" (nooks and crannies that collect road dirt and water) *Particular process of rustproofing used *Plastic/under-seal protection on the car underside *Exposure to salt water, which strips off the protective paint and also causes rust much quicker than ordinary rain water would Rustproof alloys Stainless steel, also known as \\"inox steel\\" does not stain, corrode, or rust as easily as ordinary steel. Pierre Berthier, a Frenchman, was the first to notice the rust-resistant properties of mixing chromium with alloys in 1821, which led to new metal treating and metallurgy processes and eventually the creation of usable stainless steel. DeLorean cars had innovative fiberglass body structure with a steel backbone chassis, along with external brushed stainless-steel body panels. Some cars have been made from aluminum, which may be more corrosion resistant than steel when exposed to water, but not salt or certain other chemicals.

The disease also may occur in the eye, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Lymphoma in dogs Lymphoma is one of the most common malignant tumors to occur in dogs. The cause is genetic, but there are also suspected environmental factors involved, including in one study an increased risk with the use of the herbicide 2,4-D. This risk was not confirmed in another study. Breeds that are commonly affected include Boxer, Scottish Terrier, Basset Hound, Airedale Terrier, Chow Chow, German Shepherd, Poodle, St. Bernard, Bulldog, Beagle, Rottweiler and Golden Retriever. The Golden Retriever is especially susceptible to developing lymphoma, with a lifetime risk of 1:8. Classification The cancer is classified into low and high grade types. Classification is also based on location. The four location types are multicentric, mediastinal, gastrointestinal, and extranodal (involving the kidney, central nervous system, skin, heart, or eye). Multicentric lymphoma, the most common type (by greater than 80 percent), is found in the lymph nodes, with or without involvement in the liver, spleen, or bone marrow. Mediastinal lymphoma occurs in the lymph nodes in the thorax and possibly the thymus. Gastrointestinal lymphoma occurs as either a solitary tumor or diffuse invasion of the stomach or intestines, with or without involvement in the surrounding lymph nodes, liver or spleen. Classification is further based on involvement of B-lymphocytes or T-lymphocytes. Approximately 70 percent are B-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous lymphoma can be classified as epitheliotropic (closely conforming to the epidermis) or non-epitheliotropic. The epitheliotropic form is typically of T-cell origin and is also called mycosis fungoides. The non-epitheliotropic form is typically of B-cell origin. Signs and symptoms General signs and symptoms include depression, fever, weight loss, loss of appetite, loss of hair or fur and vomiting. Lymphoma is the most common cancerous cause of hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels) in dogs. It can lead to the above signs and symptoms plus increased water drinking, increased urination, and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypercalcemia in these cases is caused by secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein. Multicentric lymphoma presents as painless enlargement of the peripheral lymph nodes. This is seen in areas such as under the jaw, the armpits, the groin, and behind the knees. Enlargement of the liver and spleen causes the abdomen to distend. Mediastinal lymphoma can cause fluid to collect around the lungs, leading to coughing and difficulty breathing. Hypercalcemia is most commonly associated with this type. Gastrointestinal lymphoma causes vomiting, diarrhea, and melena (digested blood in the stool). Low serum albumin levels and hypercalcemia can also occur. Lymphoma of the skin is an uncommon occurrence. The epitheliotropic form typically appears as itchy inflammation of the skin progressing to nodules and plaques. The non-epitheliotropic form can have a wide variety of appearances, from a single lump to large areas of bruised, ulcerated, hairless skin. The epitheliotropic form must be differentiated from similar appearing conditions such as pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, and lupus erythematosus. Signs for lymphoma in other sites depend on the location. Central nervous system involvement can cause seizures or paralysis. Eye involvement, seen in 20 to 25 percent of cases, can lead to glaucoma, uveitis, bleeding within the eye, retinal detachment, and blindness. Lymphoma in the bone marrow causes anemia, low platelet count, and low white blood cell count. Diagnosis Cytology of lymphoma in a dog Biopsy of affected lymph nodes or organs confirms the diagnosis, although a needle aspiration of an affected lymph node can increase suspicion of the disease. X-rays, ultrasound and bone marrow biopsy reveal other locations of the cancer. There are now a range of blood tests that can be utilised to aid in the diagnosis of lymphoma.

The stage of the disease is important to treatment and prognosis. *Stage I - only one lymph node or lymphoid tissue in one organ involved. *Stage II - lymph nodes in only one area of the body involved. *Stage III - generalized lymph node involvement. *Stage IV - any of the above with liver or spleen involvement. *Stage V - any of the above with blood or bone marrow involvement. Each stage is divided into either substage a, those without systemic symptoms; or substage b, those with systemic symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue. Treatment Due to the high risk of recurrence and ensuing problems, close monitoring of dogs undergoing chemotherapy is important. The same is true for dogs that have entered remission and ceased treatment. Monitoring for disease and remission/recurrence is usually performed by palpation of peripheral lymph nodes. This procedure detects gross changes in peripheral lymph nodes. Some of the blood tests used in diagnosing lymphoma also offer greater objectivity and provide an earlier warning of an animal coming out of remission. Complete cure is rare with lymphoma and treatment tends to be palliative, but long remission times are possible with chemotherapy. With effective protocols, average first remission times are 6 to 8 months. Second remissions are shorter and harder to accomplish. Average survival is 9 to 12 months. The most common treatment is a combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, L-asparaginase, and doxorubicin. Other chemotherapy drugs such as chlorambucil, lomustine (CCNU), cytosine arabinoside, and mitoxantrone are sometimes used in the treatment of lymphoma by themselves or in substitution for other drugs. In most cases, appropriate treatment protocols cause few side effects, but white blood cell counts must be monitored. Allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantations (as is commonly done in humans) have recently been shown to be a possible treatment option for dogs. Most of the basic research on transplantation biology was generated in dogs. Current cure rates using stem cell therapy in dogs approximates that achieved in humans, 40-50%. When cost is a factor, prednisone used alone can improve the symptoms dramatically, but it does not significantly affect the survival rate. The average survival times of dogs treated with prednisone and untreated dogs are both one to two months. Using prednisone alone can cause the cancer to become resistant to other chemotherapy agents, so it should only be used if more aggressive treatment is not an option. Isotretinoin can be used to treat cutaneous lymphoma. Prognosis Untreated dogs have an average survival time of 60 days. Lymphoma with a histologic high grade generally respond better to treatment but have shorter survival times than dogs with low grade lymphoma. Dogs with B-lymphocyte tumors have a longer survival time than T-lymphocyte tumors. Mediastinal lymphoma has a poorer prognosis than other types, especially those with hypercalcemia. Clinical stage and substage have some prognostic value, with poorer prognosis associated with Stage V disease, and with substage b (clinical illness at time of presentation).Withrow,2001 Lymphoma in cats Lymphoma is the most common malignancy diagnosed in cats. Lymphoma in young cats occurs most frequently following infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) or to a lesser degree feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). These cats tend to have involvement of lymph nodes, spine, or mediastinum. Cats with FeLV are 62 times more likely to develop lymphoma, and cats with both FeLV and FIV are 77 times more likely. Younger cats tend to have T-cell lymphoma and older cats tend to have B-cell lymphoma. Older cats tend to have gastrointestinal lymphoma without FeLV infection, although tests more sensitive to low level FeLV infections and replication-defective FeLV have found that many of these cats have been previously exposed. The same forms of lymphoma that are found in dogs also occur in cats, but gastrointestinal is the most common type. Lymphoma of the kidney is the most common kidney tumor in cats, and lymphoma is also the most common heart tumor. Classification Gastrointestinal lymphoma is classified into low grade, intermediate grade, and high grade. Low grade types include lymphocytic and small cell lymphoma. High grade types include lymphoblastic, immunoblastic, and large cell lymphoma. Low grade lymphoma is only found in the small intestine, while high grade can commonly be found in the stomach. Symptoms Cats that develop lymphoma are much more likely to develop more severe symptoms than dogs. Whereas dogs often appear healthy initially except for swollen lymph nodes, cats will often be physically ill. The symptoms correspond closely to the location of the lymphoma. The most common sites for alimentary (gastrointestinal) lymphoma are, in decreasing frequency, the small intestine, the stomach, the junction of the ileum, cecum, and colon. Cats with the alimentary form of lymphoma often present with weight loss, rough hair coat, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhea, although vomiting and diarrhea are commonly absent as symptoms. The tumor can also cause life-threatening blockage of the intestine. Cats with the mediastinal form often have respiratory distress and fluid in the thoracic cavity. If lymphoma develops in the kidney, the cat may have increased water consumption and increased urination. Lymphoma of the kidney presents as bilateral kidney enlargement and failure. If the lymphoma is located in the nose, the cat may have discharge from the nose and facial swelling. Lymphoma of the heart causes congestive heart failure, pericardial effusion, and cardiac arrhythmias. Ocular lymphoma in cats often presents as anterior uveitis (inflammation of the inside of the eye). Cats who are also infected with FeLV often present with pale mucous membranes due to anemia. Anemia is a common problem in all cats with lymphoma, but hypercalcemia is rare. Diagnosis is similar to dogs, except cats should be tested for FeLV and FIV. It is important to differentiate the alimentary form of lymphoma from inflammatory bowel disease because the signs are so similar in cats. A biopsy is necessary to do this. One approach to differentiate inflammatory bowel disease from is to test the infiltrating lymphocytes for their monoclonal origin in lymphomas. Treatment and prognosis Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for lymphoma in cats. Most of the drugs used in dogs are used in cats, but the most common protocol uses cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone. Gastrointestinal lymphoma has also commonly been treated with a combination of prednisolone and high dose pulse chlorambucil with success. The white blood cell count must be monitored. Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs. Lower stage lymphoma has a better prognosis. Multicentric lymphoma has a better response to treatment than the gastrointestinal form, but infection with FeLV worsens the prognosis. About 75% of cats treated with chemotherapy for lymphoma go into remission. Unfortunately, after an initial remission, most cats experience a relapse, after which they have a median survival of 6 months. However, about one-third of cats treated with chemotherapy will survive more than 2 years after diagnosis; a small number of these cats may be cured of their disease. Untreated, most cats with lymphoma die within 4–6 weeks. Most cats tolerate their chemotherapy well, and fewer than 5% have severe side effects. Cats do not lose their fur from chemotherapy, though loss of whiskers is possible. Other side effects include low white blood cell count, vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, or fatigue. These can typically be controlled well, and most cats have a good quality of life during treatment. If a cat relapses after attaining remission, the cat can be treated with different chemotherapy drugs to try for a second remission. The chances of a second remission are much lower than the chances of obtaining a first, and the second remission is often shorter than the first.  Lymphoma in ferrets  Lymphoma is common in ferrets and is the most common cancer in young ferrets. There is some evidence that a retrovirus may play a role in the development of lymphoma like in cats. The most commonly affected tissues are the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, intestine, mediastinum, bone marrow, lung, and kidney. In young ferrets, the disease progresses rapidly. The most common symptom is difficulty breathing caused by enlargement of the thymus. Other symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, depression, and coughing. It can also masquerade as a chronic disease such as an upper respiratory infection or gastrointestinal disease. In older ferrets, lymphoma is usually chronic and can exhibit no symptoms for years. Symptoms seen are the same as in young ferrets, plus splenomegaly, abdominal masses, and peripheral lymph node enlargement. Diagnosis is through biopsy and x-rays. There may also be an increased lymphocyte count. Treatment includes surgery for solitary tumors, splenectomy (when the spleen is very large), and chemotherapy. The most common protocol uses prednisone, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide. Doxorubicin is used in some cases. Chemotherapy in relatively healthy ferrets is tolerated very well, but possible side effects include loss of appetite, depression, weakness, vomiting, and loss of whiskers. The white blood cell count must be monitored. Prednisone used alone can work very well for weeks to months, but it may cause resistance to other chemotherapy agents. Alternative treatments include vitamin C and Pau d'Arco (a bark extract). The prognosis for lymphoma in ferrets depends on their health and the location of the cancer. Lymphoma in the mediastinum, spleen, skin, and peripheral lymph nodes has the best prognosis, while lymphoma in the intestine, liver, abdominal lymph nodes, and bone marrow has the worst.

It follows an Italian orchestra as the members go on strike against the conductor. The film was shown out of competition at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival. The picture has been interpreted as a metaphor for Italian politics, with the orchestra quarreling instead of working together. Considered by some to be underrated, Orchestra Rehearsal was the last collaboration between composer Nino Rota and Fellini, due to Rota's death in 1979. Plot An off- screen Italian television camera crew (voice enacted by Fellini) conducts documentarian-style 'roving eye' interviews with musicians preparing for a low-budget rehearsal in a run-down auditorium (formerly converted from a 13th- century church — presently slated for demolition, apparently). Speaking candidly and often cynically about their craft, interviewees are seen routinely interrupting one another as their artistic claims are contested or derided by orchestral peers, each self-importantly regarding his own instrument as the most vital to group performance, the most solitary in nature or spiritual in relation — these varied opinions reflecting each listener's intensely personal experience with music, one of the recurring themes of the film. The conductor arrives (speaking Italian but with an affected German accent), proving theatrically critical of the ensuing performance quality and equally quarrelsome with trade union representatives on site, wearing down the orchestra members as he commands them to play with exceedingly particular nuances bordering on absurd abstraction, leading several musicians to strip away clothing under the strain of this taxing effort. Protesting the conductor's authoritarian abuses, the union reps intervene, spitefully announcing that all musicians will be taking a 20-minute double break. While one camera follows the players to a local tavern to further catalog their ideological musings, in a backstage interview the defeated conductor expresses his frustrations regarding the impossible contradictions of his leadership role, opining on the subjective power of music just as a power outage in the building prompts his return to the auditorium hall. There he discovers the darkened auditorium space has been thoroughly defaced with spray-painted revolutionary slogans and rubbish being flung about by the musicians who chant a discordant chorus of protest against their oppressive taskmaster and then against music itself (\\"The music in power, not the power of music!\\"). This increasingly anarchistic bacchanal culminates in a violent crescendo of gunshots and in-fighting, until finally an impossibly large wrecking ball — its presence going unexplained — smashes with God-like wrath through a wall of the building (at the altar of this former church), causing the death of the harpist beneath an avalanche of rubble. As the silenced fellow musicians reflect on this tragedy in a cloud of settling dust, the conductor steps in to eulogize with a motivational speech declaring that music requires them to play through the pain of life, to find strength, identity and guidance in the fated notes of its composition. Amid the ruins, the newly inspired musicians accommodatingly take to their instruments to deliver a tour de force redemptive performance. At its conclusion, however, the conductor's former words of fleeting praise once again sour to perfectionist dissatisfaction, resuming his comically agitated critique at the dais as the picture fades to black, to the swelling accompaniment of a classical opus. As the credit roll commences, the conductor's continued Italian dialogue berating the orchestra is heard to slip into dictatorial German barking, suggesting a sharper political allegory at play in the movie's message all along.

It has an open admissions policy and welcomes enrollment from any adult with a high school diploma or GED. The student body is composed of Crow Tribal members (95 percent), members of American Indian Tribes from around the intermountain west (3 percent), and non-Indian residents of the Big Horn County area (2 percent).American Indian Higher Education Consortium Campus The LBHC facility consists of 35,000 square feet of educational space. The LBHC campus is situated on two acres of wooded river valley. Programs LBHC offers eight associate of arts and two associate of science degree programs. The courses of study are directed to the economic and job opportunities in the Crow Indian Reservation area. Governance The college is directed by the Board of Trustees elected by districts within the reservation. History Little Big Horn College was chartered in 1980 by the Crow Tribe of Indians as a public two-year community college. Dr. Janine Pease advocated the college's founding and was the college's first president. The name Little Big Horn comes from the smaller of the two rivers on the reservation, both receiving the distinction by the Big Horn Mountains, where the rivers originate. Under the 1994 Equity in Education legislation of the US Congress, Little Big Horn College became a Land Grant Institution, joining the ranks of the 1864 and 1890 land grant colleges. Partnerships The college is member of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, which is a community of tribally and federally chartered institutions working to strengthen tribal nations and make a lasting difference in the lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives. ANC was created in response to the higher education needs of American Indians. ANC generally serves geographically isolated populations that have no other means accessing education beyond the high school level.

It is a descriptive term which may be used for inflammation related to a bacterial infection or non-infectious causes (e.g. pancreatitis). Most commonly, it is used in contradistinction to a \\"walled-off\\" pus-filled collection (abscess), although a phlegmon may progress to an abscess if untreated. A phlegmon can localize anywhere in the body. The Latin term phlegmōn is from the ancient Greek φλέγω (phlégō, “burn”). Signs and symptoms As with any form of inflammation, phlegmon presents with inflammatory signs dolor (localized pain), calor (increase local tissue temperature), rubor (skin redness/hyperemia), tumor (either clear or non-clear bordered tissue swelling), functio laesa (diminish affected function). There may be systemic signs of infection, such as fever, general fatigue, chills, sweating, headache, loss of appetite. Cause Commonly caused by bacterial infection, as in the case of cellulitis or diverticulitis. Non-infectious causes of phlegmon include acute pancreatitis, where inflammation is caused by leaking of pancreatic digestive enzymes into the surrounding tissues. Factors affecting the development of phlegmon are virulence of bacteria and immunity strength. Diagnosis In modern medicine, phlegmon is mostly used descriptively in the fields of surgery/surgical pathology and medical imaging. The ultrasound and CT imaging findings of phlegmon are those of focal tissue edema, with no loculated fluid collection to suggest the formation of an abscess. Treatment Since phlegmon describes an area of inflammation, and not a specific disease process, the treatment depends on the cause and severity of the inflammation. Bacterial infections such as cellulitis may be treated by antibiotic therapy, depending on the severity.

Setting The game is set in the Southwestern United States in an alternate version of the year 1982, during the Reagan Administration. The game is less complex than its predecessor, Interstate '76, lacking the detailed armor and weapon management of the original. Its play-style is closer to console-based vehicular combat games like Twisted Metal, with a single health bar displaying both armor and chassis strength, as opposed to '76s armor/chassis strength system. The vehicle models have been updated to reflect the change in era, and overall, the game has a new wave feel, with several hitherto-unreleased Devo songs being on the soundtrack, as opposed to the first game's funk-inspired style. Interstate '82 features a story-mode like its predecessor, with one new option: the player can exit his vehicle and enter another, adding some strategy to the game's storyline. Another new addition is the ability to skin the new vehicle models. Reception Eric Bratcher reviewed the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Some of the '80s nods may be missed by those who weren't paying attention back then, but the game is still fun.\\" The game received a bit more mixed reviews than the original according to the review aggregation website GameRankings.

A friend of Robert Burns, who made him a collection of his poems which later became famous, and wrote a poem 'Sonnet On The Death Of Robert Riddell' in memory of him when he died.  The Glenriddell Manuscripts  The Glenriddell Manuscripts, an important autograph text of two volumes, one containing more than 50 poems, and the other 27 letters by Burns, were written for Riddell between 1791 and 1793. The poet's friendship with the Riddell family ended suddenly in December 1793 as the result of a mysterious drunken incident at Friars Carse, the estate owned by Riddell in Nithsdale. Burns asked successfully for the return of the poetry volume which had already been given to Riddell; the second had not been completed. The Glenriddell Manuscripts are now in the possession of the National Library of Scotland.  The Interleaved Scots Musical Museum  Robert Burns produced the Interleaved Scots Musical Museum for Robert Riddell, consisting of four volumes of James Johnson collection of Scots songs with his personal notes added.  A Collection of Scotch Galwegian and Border Tunes  Riddell was the author of \\"A Collection of Scotch, Galwegian and Border Tunes\\",A Collection of Scotch, Galwegian and Border Tunes, Edinburgh, 1794. Digitised at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/musicfiles/manuscripts/riddell/ a collection of music mostly from the western Border country, which was published posthumously. While the title page describes the music as \\"for the violin and pianoforte\\", many of the tunes have the characteristic idiom, 9-note range and mixolydian mode of music for the Border pipes, and is a very late source for the music of this instrument. Riddell points out that 'the tunes were collected in various parts of Scotland, and on the Borders ... and chiefly wrote from performers, who could not write or read music'. There are significant parallels between several of the tunes, and those in the Peacock collection of music for Northumbrian smallpipes. Some of his variants differ principally in the title, so Peacock's \\"I saw my love come passing by me\\" appears here with minor changes as \\"The Drunken Wives of Carlisle\\". Other variants are much more distinct - Riddell's variation set on \\"Cut and Dry Dolly\\" is very different from Peacock's, though they do have material in common. Some minor differences are significant - Peacock's \\"Johnnie stays long at the Fair\\", and Riddell's \\"Willie stays lang at the Fair\\" are melodically very similar, but Peacock's version is an adaptation to Northumbrian pipes, while Riddell's makes more sense on Border pipes. Comparison of the two suggests that Peacock adapted a tune from Border pipes to Northumbrian pipes, making some melodic changes to fit the instrument.

Plot summary Two people, who have been renamed Eiros and Charmion after death, discuss the manner in which the world ended. Eiros, who died in the apocalypse, explains the circumstances to Charmion, who died ten years previously: A new comet is detected in the solar system; comets are well understood by astronomers, who believe that, being very tenuous, they could have no effect on the Earth, and are not related to ancient prophecies of the destruction of the world. Astronomers calculate that the comet is approaching the Earth; as it does so, they study it, and people increasingly take an interest. When it is almost upon Earth, people experience exhilaration, which is at first assumed to be relief that the comet has no harmful effects; but this is followed by pain and delirium; it is as though the ancient prophecies, once dismissed by astronomers, have been confirmed. This effect on people's behavior is discovered to be caused by the loss of nitrogen from the atmosphere, leaving pure oxygen, which finally bursts into flame when the comet nucleus hits. Publication history \\"The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion\\" was first published in the December 1839 issue of Burton's Gentleman's Magazine and was included that same month in the collection Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 212. . Analysis Poe, writing this story in 1839, was capitalizing on the excitement in the 1830s caused by William Miller's predictions of the end of the world.Campbell, Killis. \\"The Origins of Poe\\", The Mind of Poe and Other Studies. New York: Russell & Russell, Inc., 1962: 169. He predicted in 1831 that the world would end in 1843. The conversation of Eiros and Charmion, by Thomas Ollive Mabbott The Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore. Accessed 20 March 2016. In the early 19th century, several comets were seen; in particular, Halley's Comet returned in 1835, and there was interest in Encke's Comet, whose periodicity had recently been calculated; it appeared in 1838, and its return was expected in 1842. All this aroused people's interest; comets were traditionally associated with prophesies of the end of the world. Donald Olson and Shaun B. Ford at Texas State University speculate that Lexell's Comet and Biela's Comet inspired the story. Biela's Comet was reputed to have caused a \\"comet panic\\" in 1832, after a miscalculation of the comet's trajectory suggested collision with Earth. Astronomers in Paris, like the astronomers in the story, sought to allay the public's fear by noting that Biela's Comet was believed to have no mass. In the story, it is indeed a vaporous comet that strikes the Earth depleting the atmosphere of nitrogen. Olson and Ford also suggest possible sources of Poe's knowledge of both comets: Elijah Hinsdale Burritt's The Geography of the Heavens and John Herschel's 1835 A Treatise on Astronomy. Another astronomy study-book for young people, James Ferguson's 1819 Edition of An Easy Introduction to Astronomy for Young Gentlemen and Ladies, might have been available to a young Poe. Poe's foster father John Allan provided Poe with a telescope as a teenager, and the researchers speculate Ferguson's book may have also been a gift. The book includes a passage of dialogue between a brother and sister (Neander and Eudosia) discussing the possibility of a comet setting the world on fire and then dismissing that possibility because of the tenuous nature of comets. Eiros and Charmion are named after Cleopatra's attendants, Iras and Charmion (or Charmian); they are mentioned by the Greek historian Plutarch in his biography of Mark Antony (in his work Parallel Lives); they appear in William Shakespeare's play Antony and Cleopatra, and John Dryden's play about Antony and Cleopatra, All for Love.

Early life  Joe grew up in Tonawanda, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. He attended Sweet Home High School in Amherst, New York. He did not start his boxing career until he was about 19 years of age.  Boxing career  He was a New York State Golden Gloves champion, and as an amateur boxer he defeated future two-time Heavyweight champion Hasim Rahman. Mesi made it all the way to the finals in the 1996 Olympic Trials, but lost to eventual US heavyweight representative Lawrence Clay-Bey. In Buffalo, for a brief period, Joe was once considered by some to be the city's \\"third professional franchise\\", with the Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bills being the other two. Joe is still often seen at Bills and Sabres games and also supports many local charities.  Philanthropy  In 2002, Mesi started a non-profit to raise awareness about organ donation and transplantation upon finding out his cousin was in need of a kidney transplant, and to help others in the Upstate New York area who needed such surgeries. His cousin, Ganelle Shanor, died in an accident before she was able to receive the operation. In January 2004, Mesi donated $7,500 to the Golisano Children's Hospital in Rochester, New York as a way of giving back to the Rochester community and to promote an upcoming fight at the Blue Cross Arena, with kidney transplant recipient Dillon Gonzalez and his family in attendance. The foundation was funded in part by admission fees to victory parties.  Injury and suspension  Mesi's promising boxing career was set back greatly when an MRI indicated he had suffered at least one, perhaps two subdural hematomas The injuries came from a 2004 bout with former cruiserweight champion Vassiliy Jirov. In round 9, Mesi was knocked down from a right hook and in the tenth round he was knocked down two more times. Mesi managed to finish the fight on his feet and the bout was scored 94-93 for Mesi by all three judges. In June 2005, Mesi, along with his attorneys and three doctors supporting his reinstatement, went before the Nevada State Athletic Commission to argue Mesi's hematomas had healed, and, he was, \\"in no more danger than any other boxer.\\" Mesi's appeal was denied by a 5-0 vote. In response to Dr. Julian E. Bailes, chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the West Virginia University School of Medicine, opinion that: \\"Football players and other athletes who had even more severe head injuries than Mesi were allowed to continue their careers without further harmful effects.\\" Dr. Tony Alamo, one of the board's commissioners, replied, \\"You play football, you don't play boxing.\\" The suspension effectively blacklisted him from boxing anywhere in the United States under the premise of the full faith and credit clause. He launched several ineffective lawsuits against parties they claimed had leaked news of his health, while also appealing to Nevada representatives that he should be allowed to box. The suspension was officially lifted when Mesi's Nevada boxing license expired at the end of 2005. However, he was unable to renew the license due to the concerns of Nevada boxing officials. In 2006, Mesi was again licensed by boxing commissions in Puerto Rico, Louisiana, Arkansas and Michigan, with a handful of other states to follow suit in 2007. Over that time, Mesi won all of his handful of fights, though effectively retired from boxing in 2007. Joe Mesi had one of the longest active undefeated professional boxing records in the world for a heavyweight. Ranked #1 heavyweight contender by the WBC prior to his two-year layoff, Mesi was #16 in the December 2007 rankings. In 2018, Mesi was inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame and the New York State Boxing Hall of Fame. Politics and life after boxing On February 14, 2008, Mesi publicly expressed his interest to run for the New York State Senate. He attempted to fill the 61st District seat vacated by Mary Lou Rath. He won the Democratic primary for the seat on September 9, 2008. Mesi lost the general election to Republican Michael Ranzenhofer. Most recently, Joe has taken a position with the Democratic Senate Majority heading up a local Buffalo liaison office. Mesi's name was circulated as a potential Democratic candidate to replace the retiring Jim Hayes in the New York State Assembly. The assembly seat was won by Raymond Walter. Professionally, Mesi is a medical supply salesman with Abbott Medical. Mesi and his wife, Michele, have three children.

It was directed by Bret Haaland. It stars Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, and is the first short of these characters produced after the death of Chuck Jones. The film was included in the DVD release of Looney Tunes: Back in Action as a special feature. The animation was produced by Rough Draft Studios. Plot The short begins with a magical battle between two different stereotypes of sorcerers (a short Gandalf-like wizard that holds a large book of magic in one hand and a staff in the other, and a tall Doctor Strange-like warlock with a black cat on his shoulder) where they zap each other until they kill each other in a final energy blast. Their possessions escape unharmed and fall on Wile E. Coyote, just as he was about to catch Road Runner, causing considerable pain to him (especially the cat, who viciously scratches to his face out of fear). Coyote notices the ACME book of magic and becomes delightfully happy (as his hare-like ears fall off), as he now has a new weapon against the Road Runner. * 1: The first spell that Coyote tries is to turn the black cat into a feral beast. He succeeds, and the cat transforms into a black panther, but unfortunately, it proves to be too feral, and he quickly slices his body into strips, deflating Coyote like a balloon. * 2: Coyote buys an ACME flying broomstick and, after some trial and error, begins to chase the Road Runner through the air. However, when he enters a gloomy tunnel, Coyote mistakes his beeps with a horn of an approaching truck and suddenly changes his direction to the sky, only to be hit by two meteorites and get his broom \\"out of gas\\". Wile E. starts to fall and dials the Acme Flying Broom Customer Service on his phone for help but gets a recording telling him all operators were busy. After a long drop, Coyote manages to stop his broomstick in mid-air and land safely, but as he feels relieved, he gets scared off a cliff by the Road Runner and becomes a victim to gravity as usual. * 3: In his second spell, Coyote tries to turn himself in a giant, but much to his chagrin, the spell only affects his head, whose weight crushes his own body. * 4: Coyote uses invisible ink to make a bomb transparent and disguise it as a crystal ball in order to lure an unsuspecting Road Runner to his death. However, the fake crystal ball actually works and the Road Runner sees Coyote's future where he's caught-- a future that quickly turns into reality when the bomb rolls straight to him and explodes. * 5: In his third spell, Coyote learns levitation and uses his classical \\"seeds trap\\" to temporarily stop the Road Runner and smash him with a large rock. Unfortunately, the rock does not fall under his command, giving enough time for the Road Runner to finish his lunch and leave. After several unsuccessful attempts to make the rock fall, Coyote leaves in disgust, only for the rock to follow and crush him. * 6: In his last spell, Coyote once again tries to shape shift the cat into another creature, this time into a Pegasus, to once again chase the Road Runner though the air, but they inadvertently fly through a load of poisonous snakes (prompting the Pegasus to use the Coyote as a stick to get rid of them), and to make matters worse, the Pegasus quickly turns into a flying carpet, and much to Coyote's anguish, they fly straight to a reserve of scorpions and to a field of cacti. The carpet is then turned into a monitor lizard (who promptly devours his snout), a lawnmower, and then into a great white shark, and he and the Coyote land in a lake. However, it turns out that the reason for the cat's uncontrollable transformations was the Road Runner, who found the book of magic and decided to test his powers. He turns a mailbox into a gracious and beautiful female roadrunner and the two leave, walking and holding hands, while the Coyote suffers being shark food. However, this leaves the Coyote's death unknown. Production This Coyote and Roadrunner short is notable for being the only one so far to use the real taxonomic names Geococcyx californianus (greater roadrunner) and Canis latrans (coyote) instead of the usual pseudo-Latin names.

History The New Basin Canal was constructed by the New Orleans Canal and Banking Company, incorporated in 1831 with capital of 4 million US dollars. The intent was to build a shipping canal from Lake Pontchartrain through the swamp land to the booming uptown or \\"American\\" section of the city, to compete with the existing Carondelet Canal in the downtown Creole part of the city. Work commenced the following year. Yellow fever ravaged workers in the swamp in back of town, and the loss of slaves was judged too expensive; so most of the work was done by Irish immigrant laborers. The Irish workers died in great numbers, but the Company had no trouble finding more men to take their place, as shiploads of poor Irishmen arrived in New Orleans. Many were willing to risk their lives in hazardous, back-breaking work for a chance to earn $1 a day. By 1838, after an expense of $1 million, the wide long canal was complete enough to be opened to small vessels drawing , with $0.375 per ton charged for passage. Over the next decade the canal was enlarged to deep, wide, and with shell roads alongside. No official count was kept of the deaths of the immigrant workers; estimates ranging from 4,000 to 30,000 have been published, with most historical best guesses falling in the 8,000 to 20,000 dead range. Many were buried without a grave marker in the levee and roadway-fill beside the canal. Small pleasure boats now moor on the only remaining portion of the canal that was important to regional commerce in the 19th century The canal originally joined with Lake Pontchartrain around the present day intersection of Robert E. Lee and West End Boulevards, but jetties were added on both sides extending it farther into the lake. The New Canal Lighthouse or more commonly New Basin Canal Lighthouse was built on the far end of one of the jetties at the entrance to the canal. Starting from the entrance of the canal, it headed south through the swamp, cut through the high ground of Metairie Ridge, through the mid-city lowlands, into the city, ended in a turning basin at Rampart Street and Howard Avenue in what is now the New Orleans Central Business District. The canal was commercially important through the 19th century, and served additional uses such as improving drainage in nearby areas and being used to harvest the bald cypress trees in what is now the Lakeview neighborhood. They were brought into the city near the River, via the canal, and used to build many uptown houses. The importance of the canal declined after World War I, especially with the opening of the Industrial Canal in 1923. In 1936 the Louisiana State Legislature passed a state constitutional amendment to close the canal. In 1937-38 the area back to Claiborne Avenue was filled in, but the rest of the length continued functioning on a more limited scale until after World War II. It was filled in by about 1950, except for a half-mile-long stretch at the lakefront by the lighthouse, which has been used as a harbor for small boats and yachts and continues to exist. Much of the route became the Pontchartrain Expressway in the 1950s, which was incorporated into I-10 the following decade. The stretch from the Interstate to just shy of Robert E. Lee Blvd was developed into the present-day New Basin Canal Park, a linear green space paralleling West End Boulevard. On November 4, 1990, the Irish Cultural Society of New Orleans dedicated a large Kilkenny marble Celtic cross in the park to commemorate the Irish workers who constructed the canal. The lighthouse which stands at the entrance to the canal, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 as the New Canal Lighthouse. It was heavily damaged during the 2005 hurricane season by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The first floor had collapsed and its cupola had fallen off. In 2006, the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation signed a lease with the United States Coast Guard to repair the damaged lighthouse. It was disassembled and the building was put into storage. Reconstruction of the lighthouse began in February 2012 and was completed in 2013.

The trust operates the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Edgbaston (QEHB), adjacent to its older namesake and connected to it by a footbridge. QEHB began receiving patients at its Emergency Department on 16 June 2010, and replaced Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Selly Oak Hospital. The trust is currently under the leadership of chair Rt Hon Jacqui Smith and chief executive Dr David Rosser who succeeded retired chief executive Dame Julie Moore on 1 September 2018. On 30 June 2004, the Trust received authorisation to become one of the first NHS Foundation Trusts in England, under the leadership of ex-chief executive Dame Julie Moore, who succeeded Mark Britnell. NHS Foundation Trust website From 2006 to November 2013 the Chair of the Trust was Sir Albert Bore. Former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith took over as Chair in December 2013. In September 2016 it announced plans to merge with the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust. The merger finally took place on 1 April 2018. The combined organisation will have a turnover of £1.6bn and 2,700 beds across four main hospitals. All the executive directors are white. There has not been a director who was not white in the last 20 years though more than 40% of the city’s population is from a black, Asian or ethnic minority background. In 2017 36% of the trust’s overall workforce were from a BAME background and in 2020 about half the medical staff. Development In December 2013 it emerged that the Trust was interested in expanding into Primary Care, a proposal which was not welcomed by all the local General Practitioners. In 2013 the trust established a subsidiary company, UHB Facilities Ltd, to which 3 staff were transferred. The intention was to achieve VAT benefits which arise because NHS trusts can only claim VAT back on a small subset of goods and services they buy. The Value Added Tax Act 1994 provides a mechanism through which NHS trusts can qualify for refunds on contracted out services. The trust has one of the 11 Genomics Medicines Centres associated with Genomics England which will open across England in February 2014. All the data produced in the 100,000 Genomes project will be made available to drugs companies and researchers to help them create precision drugs for future generations. It is one of the biggest providers of specialised services in England, which generated an income of £327.7 million in 2014/5. It arranged a deal with Hospital Corporation of America in 2017 to build 138 bed specialist hospital on the trust’s Edgbaston campus. The £65 million development will have 66 private beds, run by HCA Healthcare, and 72 NHS beds, run by the trust, a new radiotherapy unit and operating theatres. Construction, by Vinci Construction UK started in May 2019. The Department of Health and Social Care lent the combined trust £162 million in May 2018. £87 million is for a new ambulatory care and diagnostics centre at Heartlands Hospital. The trust opened an office in Beijing in October 2018, hoping to find business opportunities in China, which could include consultancy, the trust’s in house clinical software, and advice about construction of new hospitals. In May 2019 it was negotiating with Babylon Health with plans to use the technology for virtual outpatient consultations, chronic disease management, and triage both before and after patients arrived at the emergency department using Babylon’s symptom checker app. The ambition is that the symptom checker could to refer patients directly to specialist clinics, avoiding the A&E; department. The Birmingham Local Medical Committee said this was “a truly frightening prospect that is going to be nothing but massively damaging for healthcare in Birmingham”. The trust was one of the biggest beneficiaries of Boris Johnson's announcement of capital funding for the NHS in August 2019, with an allocation of £97.1 million for a purpose built building for outpatient, treatment and diagnostic services. It began trials of a Remote Diagnostic Station in 2020. This enables multi-disciplinary teams to give remote clinical support using digital stethoscopes and ECGs to review and provide diagnoses for patients. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times- and-activity/ In December 2013 the Trust was one of thirteen hospital trusts named by Dr Foster Intelligence as having higher than expected mortality indicator scores for the period April 2012 to March 2013 in their Hospital Guide 2013. In August 2014 the trust wrote to local Clinical Commissioning Groups advising them that it would no longer accept referrals into pain, dermatology and general surgery from GPs outside the boundary of the trust because of capacity problems. The Trust had been forced to fully re-open the former Queen Elizabeth Hospital, which was supposed to be closed after the new site was opened in 2010. In October 2014 Julie Moore called for a major overhaul of financial rules to help popular hospitals cope with the extra demand their reputations attract. The trust expected to finish 2015-16 with a deficit of more than £31 million as a result of changes to the NHS tariff. In June 2014 the trust reported that Accident and Emergency Department activity had continued to rise with more than 102,000 attendances, a 4.9% increase over the previous year. It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 7712 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 3.86%. 82% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 70% recommended it as a place to work. In March 2016 the Trust's cardiac surgery service was heavily criticised in a Care Quality Commission report, having been identified as a significant mortality outlier when compared to similar services. In September 2016, the trust was selected by NHS England as one of twelve Global Digital Exemplars.

It is set in London, and directed by Andrei Konchalovsky. The story is based on the life of cellist Jacqueline du Pré, who was diagnosed with MS, and her husband, conductor Daniel Barenboim, and only marginally fictionalized. Synopsis Stephanie Anderson, a world-famous violinist, becomes unable to play because of multiple sclerosis. A depressed psychiatrist she sees is unable to help with her rage and frustration. Her star pupil, realizing he will learn nothing more, leaves her. Her husband departs with his young secretary, and her accompanist dies. Her fierce desire to be alone in her pain alienates everybody except her faithful maid. She gives all her musical effects to a totter (an itinerant scrap merchant), who she asks into her bed as well. Watching a videotape of a concert triumph, she takes an overdose but the maid breaks in to try and save her. In an epilogue, which may be a dream, the psychiatrist has become a friend while her ex-husband and former pupil come back to see her, as does the ghost of her accompanist.

Awards Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama Role: Julie Andrews (Nominated) Stage play Duet for One premiered at the Bush Theatre in 1980 with Frances de la Tour and David de Keyser in the leading roles. Kempinski and de la Tour were married at the time, and he wrote the role with her in mind. It had a successful run in the West End. The Broadway version, starring Anne Bancroft and Max von Sydow, opened December 17, 1981, and ran until January 2, 1982, for a total of 20 performances. A major revival was staged by the Almeida Theatre in 2009, starring Juliet Stevenson and Henry Goodman. This revival too was lauded by the critics, and it subsequently transferred to the Vaudeville Theatre in the West End.

The role of the sonority cycle in core syllabification. In J. Kingston and M. E. Beckman (eds.) Papers in Laboratory Phonology I: Between the grammar and the physics of speech. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 283-333. or Sonority Sequencing Constraint is a phonotactic principle that aims to outline the structure of a syllable in terms of sonority. The SSP states that the syllable nucleus (syllable center), often a vowel, constitutes a sonority peak that is preceded and/or followed by a sequence of segments – consonants – with progressively decreasing sonority values (i.e., the sonority has to fall toward both edges of the syllable). The sonority values of segments are determined by a sonority hierarchy, though these differ to some extent from language to language. Typically they are vowel > glide > liquid > nasal > obstruent (or > fricative > plosive > click). That is, the segment order in a syllable tends to be of the pattern Ʞ-P-F-N-L-G-V-G-L-N-F-P. The fricative–plosive and nasal–plosive rankings may be reversed. Wright (2004: 51–52) notes,Wright, Richard (2004). A review of perceptual cues and robustness. In Bruce Hayes, Robert Kirchner & Donca Steriade (eds.) Phonetically based phonology. Cambridge University Press, 34–57. A good example for the SSP in English is the one-syllable word \\"trust\\": The first consonant in the syllable onset is t, which is a stop, the lowest on the sonority scale; next is r, a liquid which is more sonorous, then we have the vowel u – the sonority peak; next, in the syllable coda, is s, a sibilant, and last is another stop, t. The SSP explains why, for example, \\"trend\\" is a valid English word but *\\"rtedn\\" (flipping the order of consonants) is not. Some languages possess syllables that violate the SSP (Russian and dialectal Arabic, for example) while other languages strictly adhere to it, even requiring larger intervals on the sonority scale: In Italian for example, a syllable-initial stop must be followed by either a liquid, a glide or a vowel, but not by a fricative (except: [ps] borrowed words like: pseudonimo, psicologia). Some languages allow a sonority \\"plateau\\"; that is, two adjacent tautosyllabic consonants with the same sonority level. Modern Hebrew is an example of such language. A number of unrelated languages that typically follow the SSP will violate it with /s/ + stop clusters. For example, in the English word \\"string\\" or Italian \\"spago\\" the more sonorous /s/ comes before a less sonorous sound in the onset. In native English words, no phoneme other than /s/ ever violates the SSP. Latin also was able to violate the principle in this way -- however the Vulgar Latin dialects that evolved into the Western Romance languages lost this ability, causing the process of I-prosthesis to occur, whereby an /i/ was inserted at the beginning of such a word, to make the /s/ instead a coda consonant rather than an onset consonant. As a result, Western Romance languages like Spanish and French will have \\"espada\\" and (\\"espee\\">) \\"épée\\" respectively where a non-Western Romance language like Italian has something akin to \\"spada\\".

The earlier part of the work deals with the history of Buddhism outside of Burma. This is based on the Mahavamsa, and other well- known Sri Lankan works, and has no independent value. The latter part of the work, about three-fifths of the whole, deals with Buddhism in Burma, and contains information not obtainable elsewhere. Up to the 11th century the Sasana Vamsa is mythical or legendary. After that date it is sober, intelligible and in all probability accurate. This portion occupies about one hundred pages (eight volumes) in the excellent edition of the text prepared by the Pali Text Society in 1897 by Dr. Mabel Bode. It shows a continuous literary effort through the eight and a half centuries, and constantly renewed ecclesiastical controversy. The latter is concerned for the most part with minor questions relating to rules of the order, there being a tendency, as relaxations of the rules crept in with the lapse of time, to hark back to the original simplicity. Of differences in matters of doctrine there is no mention in this manual. Dr Bode has prefixed to her edition a detailed summary of the contents of the book. The Dhammikarama Temple in Penang, Malaysia contains a Sasana Vamsa Sima Shrine Hall in honour of Bode's work. N. R.

Helme Heine (born 4 April 1941 in Berlin) is a best- selling German writer, children's book author, illustrator and designer. He currently lives in New Zealand, writing screenplays, audiobook scripts and creating satirical drawings and sculptures. Biography Helme (Helmut) Heine was born in Berlin in 1941. His parents ran different restaurants and hotels.Er löste Probleme mit dem Hackebeil, Focus, 5 March 2012. Helme Heine is the brother of author and architect Ernst Wilhelm Heine. Among other places, he spent his childhood in Lübbecke and from 1953 in Wülfrath. When he graduated from high school in 1958, he had attended thirteen schools. As a student, he was characterised as \\"playful, non-conformist and with a broad artistic talent\\". He went on to study business and art. Afterwards, in the early 1960s, although planned, he did not take over the parental hotel in a moated castle in Wülfrath-Düssel, an old, small village at the town boundary to Wuppertal. Instead he traveled through Europe, Asia, and South Africa, where he settled down and worked in Johannesburg until 1977. He created a political and literary cabaret called \\"Sauerkraut\\", ran a satirical magazine, drew and worked as a director, stage designer and actor. At the beginning of the 1970s, Heine started painting. In 1975, Helme Heine created his first children's book, \\"The secret of the elephant's poohs\\". In the same year, he met with editor Gertraud Middelhauve on the Frankfurt Book Fair, who published the book in 1976. It won an honourable mention for the \\"Premio Grafico\\" of the Bologna Children's Book Fair. The first major success followed in 1977 with \\"The Pigs' Wedding\\". In 1977, Helme Heine pulled up stakes in South-Africa and returned to Germany with his family. He has since published over 50 children's books which have been translated to over 35 languages. Two of them were featured in the New York Times' \\"Best Illustrated Children's Books of the Year\\": \\"Mr. Miller the Dog\\" (1980) and \\"The Marvelous Journey through the Night\\" (1991).New York Times Best Illustrated Children's Books of the Year, 1952–2002, 17 November 2002. His most famous work is \\"Friends\\" from 1982. Helme Heine has done theater and musical work in different locations, including the 1970 World's Fair in Osaka. He has created a theme park for the Hanover Zoo and has had numerous expositions in Europe, the United States and Asia. In 1983, Heine created another popular children's character in the form of a little green dragon called \\"Tabaluga\\" together with Peter Maffay and Gregor Rottschalk. Different \\"Tabaluga\\" musicals have toured Germany with great success and an en-suite production was played at Metronom Theater in Oberhausen in 1999. The Tabaluga cartoon series ran for 78 episodes and aired in 18 countries. \\"Sauerkraut\\" became the name of a children's cartoon series Heine created in 1992. In the late 1980s, Helme Heine traveled to Ireland and went on to New Zealand. Today, he lives and works in Russell in the Bay of Islands together with his wife, author Gisela von Radowitz. Heine writes novels for adults, radio and film scripts such as the film \\"Mollywoop\\" (2009), he draws and paints and designs sculptures and furniture. In his free time, Heine enjoys sailing and fishing. Helme Heine supports the \\"Stiftung Freunde\\" (\\"Friends Foundation\\"), a charity run by Rotary clubs in Bavaria, Saxony and Austria, named after his most famous book. The foundation is aimed at teaching life skills to young children and preventing violence and addictions. As an author and illustrator, Helme Heine has won numerous national and international prizes, including the European children's book award.Kürschners Deutscher Literatur-Kalender 2012/2013, De Gruyter, Berlin 2012, Vol. 2, p. 405.

The show was first broadcast on CBS for 13 episodes from September 13 to December 6, 1986. Plot As a baby, Princess Sara (voiced by Georgi Irene) of Thurinia was saved from the clutches of the evil Lady Diabolyn (voiced by Jessica Walter) by a mystic talking horse named Wildfire (voiced by John Vernon) following the death of Sara's mother Queen Sarana (voiced by Amanda McBroom) who is Lady Diabolyn's step-sister. Wildfire took her away from the planet Dar-Shan and deposited her in Montana where she is taken in by a farmer named John Cavanaugh (voiced by David Ackroyd). Lady Diabolyn was a stepsister to Queen Sarana, whom she always considered weak and unfit to rule. To gain her \\"rightful\\" throne, she learned dark magic and allied herself with the demonic Spectres. Twelve years later when Sara was ready to fight evil, Wildfire brought her back to Dar-Shan to regain her kingdom. Wildfire summons Sara through her magic amulet and transports her across dimensions to her real home in Dar-Shan. Sara joins with her friends consisting of a sorcerer named Alvinar (voiced by René Auberjonois), a young boy named Dorin (voiced by Bobby Jacoby), and his cowardly colt Brutus (voiced by Susan Blu) in order to thwart her wicked step-aunt. John and Sara's Indian friend Ellen (voiced by Lilly Moon) provide moral support on Earth. Lady Diabolyn is helped by the Goons, mischievous creatures consisting of Dweedle (voiced by Billy Barty), Nerts, Booper, Mudlusk (voiced by Frank Welker), and Thimble. They were formerly Diabolyn's personal guards until they gained their monstrous appearances by the Spectres upon opening the urn containing them when Diabolyn told them not to. Each episode revealed more and more of the mythical world of Dar-Shan and gave its audience a new puzzle piece to help reason out the past events that led up to the current state of affairs. It was later revealed that Sara's adopted father John was actually Prince Cavan, her biological father, sent to Earth to protect him from the curse which Lady Diabolyn and the Spectres had placed on Dar-Shan. Sara and Wildfire are the only ones who know John's true identity, which has been kept secret even from him.

In adult life, he used the style Earl of Tyrconnell, Baron of Donegal and Lifford, Lord of Sligo and Lower Connaught, and Knight Commander of the Order of Alacantara.* Biography O'Donnell was the son of Rory O'Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell and his wife Bridget, the beautiful daughter of Henry FitzGerald, 12th Earl of Kildare. O'Donnell was three weeks shy of his first birthday when he sailed from Lough Swilly during the Flight of the Earls. He accompanied his father to Rome, where his father and uncle Cathbarr O'Donnell died of fevers. His aunt Rosa, the wife of Cathbarr, met and married Owen Roe O'Neill, and it is probable that O'Donnell was in her care, because both he and his cousin, also named Hugh O'Donnell, received a modest pension from Archduke Albert, governor of the Low Countries, from 1615, and were raised in Leuven where they were educated by Franciscan colleagues of Archbishop Conry. He was a page to the Infanta Isabella, daughter of King Philip III of Spain. In time he joined the service of King Philip, and was commissioned colonel of a tercio in 1632. He was killed in action when his ship engaged a French vessel in August or September 1642 and caught fire. O'Donnell left no immediate heirs, although the Earldom, were it not attainted in 1614, would have passed by remainder to his uncle Cathbarr O'Donnell, whose line was extinct by then, and thence, to his 1st cousin Donal Oge O'Donnell, according to the terms of the letters patent.The text of the Letters Patent is referenced in G.O. Ms. 169 (National Library of Ireland) and in several slight variations as follows: (a) in pages 2388-2389 of the Appendix in Volume VI of the Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland by the Four Masters (De Burca’s 1990 re-print of the 1856 edition by John O’Donovan); (b) in page 39 of the Fate and Fortunes of the Earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnel, by Rev. C.P. Meehan (1870); (c) in a partial translation of the Latin original of the Letters Patent held by Count O’Donnell von Tyrconnell in Austria, and recounted in O’Domhnaill Abu (the O’Donnell Clan Newsletter no. 12 of Winter 1989). Versions (a) and (b) referenced above make explicit reference to the remainder to Donal Oge O’Donnell As Hugh had never recognised James VI and I as his monarch, he had no hope of being recognised as the 2nd Earl, under the principle of the \\"Fount of honour\\". He had an undoubted claim to the title, but took no steps in 1614 to defend it when it was debated in the Irish House of Lords. He would at least have had to submit to King James to take his place in the House of Lords, and until then he did so the title was \\"in abeyance\\". Family O'Donnell married Anna-Margaret, daughter of Maximilien II de Hénin, 5th Count of Bossu, Knight of the Golden Fleece (died 8 December 1625) and Alexandrine Franeoise de Gavre; and a near kinswoman of the last eccentric Charles, Duke of Guise.

In 1997 she was promoted from reporter to editor at the Washington Bureau, and worked there until 2001, marrying in 2000 to Hadi Dadashian. In 2001 Kenna became the Star's South-east Asia Bureau chief. After the September 11 attacks in the U.S., Kenna went to Afghanistan to report on the war. Kenna was injured in an attack in Afghanistan on March 4, 2002. While traveling with her husband Hadi Dadashian, Toronto Star photographer Bernard Weil, and an Afghan driver on the road from Kubul to Gardez, a grenade thrown into the car exploded underneath Kenna's seat, seriously injuring her. Following the attack she was taken to a medical facility in Gardez with the help of Agence France-Presse journalists who were also on the road at the same time. After treatment at the medical compound she airlifted by helicopter to Bagram air base in Kabul and then transported to a United States air base in Karshi-Khanabad Uzbekistan where two operations were performed, then to Rammstein Air Base in Germany for further treatment and finally back to Canada. On January 16, 2006 Abdul Zahir was charged by a Guantanamo military commission for allegedly playing a role in the attack on Kenna.Summarized transcripts (.pdf) , from Abdul Zahir's Combatant Status Review Tribunal pages 1-8 Education In 2004 Kenna became a visiting scholar at the University of California, Berkeley during a one year fellowships in Journalism and Canadian studies at the Graduate School of Journalism. She delivered the September 23, 2004 Sproul lecture, entitled: \\"Heroism in the Desert: a Canadian journalist and her American rescuers in Afghanistan.\\" After finishing the fellowship at Berkeley, Kenna studied at San Francisco State University between 2005 and 2008 towards a masters qualification in rehabilitation counseling and became involved in helping people who have suffered severe and traumatic wounds deal psychologically with their injuries. Kenna wrote an op-ed about her feelings about Abdul Zahir's trial on December 27, 2009. She wrote that she and her companions weren't interested in retribution. She wrote that she hopes Abdul Zahir has a truly fair trial. She wrote that she and her companions couldn't identify their attackers. She wrote that she had witnessed an aerial bombardment, in the area, earlier that day, and she speculated that her attackers may not have been prepared to distinguish between the foreigner forces bombarding Afghanistan and foreign journalists reporting on the conflict.

The performer is called a singjay, a combination of singer and deejay. The fusion of singing and deejaying occurred early in reggae music. Artists like Big Youth combined singing and toasting on tracks like \\"Sky Juice\\", \\"Every Negro Is A Star\\" and \\"Hit The Road Jack\\". However, the term \\"singjay\\" more accurately describes the transition from singer to deejay, rather than deejay to singer. This phenomenon happened years after the deejay style had gone mainstream. Among the earliest performers of what would later be known as singjaying is Michael Rose, who used to integrate highly rhythmic but completely meaningless deejay \\"scatting\\" in his roots songs. As the rhythm of reggae changed in the late 1970s and became what is now known as \\"rockers\\" style reggae, the themes changed as well. The classic roots themes were slowly being replaced by songs inspired by life at the dancehall. A change in vocal delivery accompanied this thematic change. Artists such as Echo Minott and Little John represent this \\"rockers\\" singjay style. Half Pint, known mostly for his \\"lovers\\" style, incorporated a singjay vocal style into his classic hit \\"Greetings\\". Around the mid-80s, the singjay style became the dominant and mainstream form of expression in Jamaican music. Eek-A-Mouse, Anthony Red Rose, King Kong, Pinchers, Wayne Smith, Courtney Melody, Conroy Smith, Lilly Melody, Triston Palma, Eccleton Jarrett, Nitty Gritty and Yami Bolo are all original singjays. Today's singjays include artists such as Mr. Vegas and Mavado, among others.http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/singjay/ References Category:Reggae genres ","title":"Singjay"},{"id":"3814347","text":"Jim Shekhdar is a British ocean rower and was the first person to complete a solo unassisted non-stop crossing of the Pacific Ocean. Career Shekhdar was born in Leamington Spa, England in 1946 and lived in India from the age of seven to twelve, where he learned Hindi. Back in England, he went to university where he studied civil engineering. Shekhdar was a keen water polo player but stopped playing after a falling out with the British Water Polo Administration for claiming airfare to an International match. He stayed in Australia for a year and a half playing Rugby and working as an engineer. He then moved on to Papua New Guinea, Africa, the Middle East, New Zealand and Las Vegas. He finally returned to England where he was permitted to play water polo again, but was banned for life one more time after throwing a referee into the water. He is now married to Nina shekhdar (ne Hlochova) and has two young daughters Natalie (born 2008) and Alice (born 2011). They all live on the beach in cornwall. Ocean rowing Shekhdar became interested in ocean rowing after reading John Ridgway's book about his transatlantic row with Chay Blyth. He initially wanted to start a corporate team building style venture with either Ridgway or Blyth but neither were interested. In 1997, he heard about the Port St Charles Atlantic Rowing Race organised by Sir Chay's company, Challenge Business, and entered with David Jackson. They rowed from Tenerife to Barbados in sixty five days. Rowing the Pacific The Atlantic race had given Shekhdar a taste for ocean rowing and his sights soon turned to the Pacific. Peter Bird had rowed across the Pacific already but he had stopped in Hawaii and eventually ended up being rescued by the Australian Navy 33 miles from the Australian mainland. The way was still open therefore for a solo unassisted non-stop crossing. Shekhdar had an arthritic hip and was on the waiting list for a replacement but decided to delay the operation in order to complete the row even though he was in pain. Bird had set off from San Francisco and had run aground on Hawaii. To avoid the same fate, Shekhdar decided to set out from South America which he felt offered a clearer route across the Pacific. He originally chose Chile but was denied permission and set off from Peru instead. Jim Shekhdar describes his boat (\\"Le Shark\\") as a \\"big boat\\", weighing 800 kg with a steel keel (and not custom designed for this event). Its length is estimated at 7 meters. Shekhdar set off from Peru on 29 June 2000 and arrived in Australia on 30 March 2001 having rowed approximately 8,000 miles in 274 days. During the voyage, he had ten encounters with sharks and a near miss with a tanker. Shekhdar originally thought the voyage would take only eight months and towards the end he almost ran out of food. On arriving at North Stradbrooke Island off Brisbane, his boat overturned and he had to swim the remaining thirty meters where his wife and children were waiting. Other adventures In 2003, Jim Shekhdar unsuccessfully attempted to row solo from Bluff, NZ, to Cape Town, and had to be rescued by New Zealand organisations, He tried again later, and had to be rescued again, in an operation costing a six-figure sum.

It won Best Film honors at the Busan International Film Festival and the Rotterdam Film Festival and was the directorial debut of Park Chan-ok. It was inspired by the poem of the same name by Ki Hyung-do. Plot Quiet, intelligent, solemn and recently dumped by his girlfriend, graduate student Lee Weon-san (Park Hae-il) takes a job at a literary magazine, ostensibly to supplement his income, but really to get close to the editor - the reason he's now single. The editor (Moon Sung-keun), unaware of who Lee is, takes a shine to him and makes him his personal assistant. He likes having him around as he's the only person he feels comfortable with, which means he often takes advantage of Lee's passive nature, making him run errands for him all over town. The fiercely independent Lee, however, works without complaint, having started a new relationship with part-time photographer/part-time vet Park Seong-yeon (Bae Jong-ok). When she takes a full-time job at the magazine, however, Lee pleads with her not to get involved with the editor, a plea that goes unheeded and sets Lee thinking once again about vengeance. It's here that the film really starts to veer from the conventional path.

The Gaelic family name now most frequently found in English as Lawlor was Ó Leathlobhair. The earliest historical record now extant tells us that Lethlobar was a king of Ulaid who died in 871 AD. Ancient kings of Dál Riata and Ulaid and the Ulster family of Lawlors followed. After the 10th century, the annals do not continue the story of this particular sept, but a family of the same name did rise to prominence in the Irish midlands. They were one of the \\"Seven Septs of Laois\\" and were kinsmen of the O'Mores. Their clan lands surrounded the famous Rock of Dunamase in County Laois (formerly spelled Laoighis or Leix) within the province of Leinster. Their family seat was Dysart Enos where they held sway until the time of Queen Elizabeth and the English colonization of this land. As punishment for their courageous battles to protect their religious faith and national independence, the Lawlor chieftains who survived the infamous Massacre of Mullaghmast in 1577 were, with the O'More, dispossessed of their property and forced to settle in County Kerry where some descendants remain. County Laois was renamed Queen's County by the English during their occupation. Still, many Lawlor clansmen managed to remain in the homeland of their ancestors and survive the Elizabethan, Cromwellian and Williamite Wars. In 1922, the name County Laois was restored. Today, the greatest number of Lawlors appear in County Laois and lands eastward. The Lawlor family motto \\"Strong and Faithful\\" to Ireland and the cause of liberty characterizes their story on the pages of Irish history as well as in the English-speaking world. James Fintan Lalor (1817–1849), son of patriot father Patrick \\"Patt\\" Lalor (1781-1856), was a noted revolutionary thinker and leader of his time. His brothers included Peter Lalor (1823–1889), leader of the insurgent miners at Eureka in 1854 in Australia and later Minister and Speaker in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and Richard Lalor(1821-1893) a nationalist member of the British House of Commons. Their cousins included Alice Lalor (1768-1846), founder of the Order of Visitation Sisters in the United States, Dr Joseph Lalor (1811-86) a reformist Irish mental health leader, and Don Joseph O'Lawlor (1768-1850), a Spanish general and governor of Granada. In the United States, Brigadier General Michael Kelly Lawler (1814–1882) was a noted officer under Grant in the Civil War. John Lalor (1820–1901) was a sculptor of international renown.

He was an unlikely star for the Cowboys in Super Bowl X. He played college basketball at Austin Peay University. Early years Howard attended Dillard High School where he lettered in basketball, football and track, specializing in the 100 and 200 yard dash. In football, he had 13 touchdowns receptions at wide receiver and 9 interceptions at safety. He accepted a basketball scholarship from Austin Peay University, where he averaged 12.4 points and 7.3 rebounds per game during three varsity seasons (1972-73 through 1974-75). The 6-4, 215-pound forward was an All-OVC selection in 1974-75 and averaged seven points and seven rebounds per game in four NCAA Tournament contests in 1973 and 1974. He was also a teammate of the legendary James \\"Fly\\" Williams. Professional career Although Howard didn't play football at Austin Peay University, the Dallas Cowboys saw a tremendous athlete and signed him to an undrafted free agent contract in 1975. He became one of only a handful of college athletes to reach the NFL without playing any college football. In the first preseason game, while returning a kick against the Los Angeles Rams, his cheekbone was fractured when one of his teammates knocked a defender into his path just as he was speeding toward a hole. The injury delayed his development several weeks, but he still made the team as a wide receiver and kickoff returner. Howard was the third receiver on the Cowboys during the 1975 season. Unfortunately for him, the top two receivers Drew Pearson and Golden Richards played virtually every offensive snap, and the Cowboys did not use formations with three receivers. He played primarily on special teams during the regular season, and his only statistical contributions were a pair of kickoff returns for 51 total yards. That season the team reached Super Bowl X, which ended up being something of a homecoming for Howard, because the Cowboys were encamped in Fort Lauderdale. In fact, when the Dallas charter landed at the airport, the Dillard High School marching band was there to greet him. Late in Super Bowl X, Howard got a rare opportunity to play on offense, when Richards broke a rib. With the Pittsburgh Steelers leading by 11 points with less than two minutes to go, Howard caught a 34-yard touchdown pass from Roger Staubach over Mel Blount, cutting the deficit to four points. A late turnover by the Steelers gave the Cowboys a shot to win the game at the end, and Howard was again involved on a last- second Hail Mary pass by Staubach, but he had three Steelers on him and when he leaped to make the catch, the ball was tipped away. His Super Bowl touchdown made him the second rookie ever to score a Super Bowl touchdown after Duane Thomas in Super Bowl V. The following year big things were expected from Howard, but in a 1976 preseason game against the Denver Broncos, he severely injured his right knee while running a reverse. He spent the rest of the season rehabilitating the knee, only to be injured again during a veteran's orientation session in the 1977 training camp, causing him to miss the entire season. For Super Bowl XII he served the Cowboys in a scouting role since he was still trying to recover from his injury. He was released by Dallas before the 1978 season and claimed by the Green Bay Packers, but failed his physical with the Packers as his knee had never fully recovered. The 34 yard touchdown catch in Super Bowl X, turned out to be Howard's only career reception and his last game in the NFL. Still, he would become part of the Cowboys lore and was named #6 on NFL Top 10's Top Ten One-Shot Wonders.

A veteran of both World War I and World War II, he fought in all the inter-war conflicts of Poland. During the Invasion of Poland of 1939 he commanded the Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division.  Biography  Wincenty Kowalski was born on 11 September 1892 in Warsaw to a family of humble workers. After graduating from a lyceum of Stanisław Konarski, he joined the high school of Hipolit Wawelberg, the only institution of higher education in Warsaw to allow Polish language (though not openly). Afterwards he moved to Liège in Belgium, where he graduated from the Machinery Building faculty of the Polytechnical Institute. During that time he joined the Związek Walki Czynnej, a secret Polish anti-tsarist organization preparing the cadres for a future anti-Russian uprising aimed at liberation of Poland. He was also a member and a tutor of the Związek Strzelecki (ZS). Drafted into the Russian Army, between 1912 and 1913 he studied at the Officers' School of Artillery in Smolensk. After that he moved to Austro-Hungarian Galicia, where he settled in Kraków. There he continued his military training at the NCO and officers' school of the ZS. After the outbreak of the Great War, in August 1914 he joined the Polish Legions. Initially a member of the legendary 1st Cadre Company, with time he became a battalion commander within the 1st Legions Infantry Regiment. After the Oath Crisis of 1917 he was interned in Beniaminów, along with most of the Legionaries with official Russian citizenship. In November 1918, after Poland regained her independence, he joined the newly formed Polish Army and was promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant. As one of the first experienced officers to join the army, he was immediately dispatched to Lwów, where he took part in the battle for that city and the Polish-Ukrainian War. He also fought with distinction in the Polish- Bolshevik War, for which he was promoted to the rank of Captain (in 1919) and then Major (1920). After the Peace of Riga he remained in active service. Initially both a tutor and a student at the Centre for Infantry Training in Rembertów, with time he became one of the professors of the Warsaw-based Higher War School. After finishing his studies he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in 1922 and then to Colonel in 1928. After that he returned to active service in line units and served in a number of detachments based in Wilno and Modlin, among them the Wilno Fortified Camp (since 1932). Between 1937 and 1938 he served as the commanding officer of the 8th Infantry Division and then the garrison of the Modlin Fortress. As one of the more skilled Polish officers of the time, on 19 March 1939 he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General and became the commander of both the prestigious Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division and the Wyszków Operational Group formed around it. After the outbreak of the Invasion of Poland in 1939, during the opening stages of World War II, Kowalski proved to be one of the most successful commanding officers in the Polish Army at that time. The units under his command entered in contact with the enemy on 4 September in the forests around Długosiodło, to the north of Warsaw. Delaying the German forces in a number of skirmishes and battles along the Narew and near Różan, Kowalski's units managed to retain most of their combat readiness. After the battle for Pułtusk, on 7 September, the Poles were outnumbered 3:1 and ordered to retreat southwards. On the road Gen. Kowalski managed not only to withdraw most of his forces, but also to rally the defeated forces of Modlin Army and Independent Operational Group Narew crowded near the bridge in Wyszków. Thanks to Kowalski's actions, overnight 2 divisions and (33rd Infantry and 41st Infantry), as well as the Mazowiecka Cavalry Brigade were not only rallied but also safely transported to the other side of the Bug River. Kowalski then withdrew with his forces to the area between Wyszków and Kamieńczyk, and organized a successful defence of the line there. After repelling a German assault on Brańszczyk, his forces started to slowly move southwards while performing delaying actions and keeping the combat readiness almost intact. After the German forces seized the town of Kałuszyn thus cutting out Kowalski's men from the safe passage towards the Romanian Bridgehead, on 13 September the division broke through enemy lines and retook the city in what became known as the battle of Kałuszyn. Despite heavy losses on the Polish side, Wincenty Kowalski managed to yet again rally a large part of his forces and continued his move towards Włodawa, Lublin and Lwów. Near Chełm, on September 18 and 19th Kowalski's division (then reduced to merely a regiment after two weeks of constant fights against numerically and technically superior enemy) was reorganized and reinforced with an improvised detachment under Stanisław Tatar. From there the division proceeded towards Tomaszów Lubelski. After a successful break through German panzers on 21 September and the German 8th Infantry Division in the battle of Falków the following day, the division arrived to the battlefield of the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski. Outnumbered, lacking artillery, supplies, food and reduced to not more than a regiment, the division's assault on Tarnawatka was stopped on 23 September and wounded General Kowalski was taken prisoner of war by the Germans. After half a year in a prison hospital, in early 1940 Kowalski was transported to Oflag VII-A Murnau POW camp, where he spent the entire war. Liberated by the forces of USA on 30 April 1945, Kowalski joined the Polish Army in the West. Demobilized in May 1946, he settled in London and then moved to New York. There he took active part in a variety of Polish organizations of the local Polish diaspora. Among his most notable deeds was organization of a funeral of Jan Lechoń, one of the most renowned Polish poets to die in exile. He was also the head of the Association of Polish Combatants, the Józef Piłsudski Institute of America () and the head of the Polish Brotherly Help, a non- profit venture aimed at helping the Polish political emigrants living in the United States. He died suddenly on 29 November 1984 in River Forest. Following his last will, on 6 September 1986 his ashes were buried at Kałuszyn war cemetery, among the fallen men of his division.

One US gallon Plastic bottles with indentations for handles Plastic milk containers are plastic containers for storing, shipping and dispensing milk. Plastic bottles, sometimes called jugs, have largely replaced glass bottles for home consumption. Glass milk bottles have traditionally been reusable while light-weight plastic bottles are designed for single trips and plastic recycling. Materials Packaging of milk is regulated by regional authorities. Use of Food contact materials is required: potential food contamination is prohibited. Strict standards of cleanliness and processing must be followed. The most common material in milk packaging is high density polyethylene (HDPE), recycling code 2. Low density polyethylene (LDPE), and polyester (PET) , are also in use. Polycarbonate had been considered but had concerns about potential contamination with Bisphenol A. Container forms Blow molded plastic milk bottles have been in use since the 1960s. HDPE is the primary material but polyester is also used. A wide variety of milk bottle designs are available. Some have a round cross section while others have a more square or rectangular shape. A special flat-top square milk jug was recently developed to maximize shipping and storing efficiency but had some difficulties in dispensing. Many milk bottles have integral handles. Milk bags are also in use. The milk is sold in a plastic bag and put into a pitcher for use. Small individual containers of milk and cream are often thermoformed or injection molded and have a peelable lid. These are often used in restaurants. Shelf life The shelf life of pasteurized milk in HDPE bottles and LDPE pouches has been determined to be between 10 and 21 days when stored at 4-8 °C. Other factors such as light and temperature abuse have effects. Shelf life can be extended by ultrapasteurisation and aseptic processing. Volume control The indentation on the left side of a milk bottle adjusts the volume of the bottle. Milk containers for retail sale must contain the same amount of milk as indicated on the label. To be acceptable to consumers, the containers must also appear to be completely full. Therefore, the volume of the container must be precisely controlled. The designer of a die for a blow moulded bottle can never be completely sure of how much the finished bottle will hold. Shrinkage always occurs after the item is released from the mould. The amount of shrinkage depends upon many factors, including cycle time, inflation air pressure, time in storage prior to filling, storage temperature, and more. A volume adjuster insert is one way to slightly adjust the volume of a bottle, without building a completely new mould. A volume insert attaches to the inside of a mould, creating a circular indentation on the side of the finished bottle. Different size inserts can be used as manufacturing circumstances change, for example mould temperature or cooling rate. The volume of finished bottles is periodically measured, and volume inserts are changed as needed. Environmental comparisons Many potential factors are involved in environmental comparisons of returnable vs non- returnable systems. Researchers have often used life cycle analysis methodologies to balance the many diverse considerations. Often the comparisons show benefits and problems with all alternatives. Reuse of bottles requires a reverse logistics system, cleaning and, sanitizing bottles, and an effective Quality Management System. A key factor with glass milk bottles is the number of cycles of uses to be expected. Breakage, contamination, or other loss reduces the benefits of returnables. A key factor with one-way recyclables is the recycling rate: In the US, only about 30-35% of HDPE bottles are recycled.

The Firth of Lorn or Lorne () in origin refers to the waters off the coast of a now obsolete geopolitical region, Lorn or Lorne. A firth in Scottish English is a long estuary, the same as or similar to a fjord, although somewhat arbitrary in application. The name of Lorn descends from the proto-history of Scotland. A nineteenth-century geographical reference defines it as being a district in the county of Argyllshire, where the –shire segment reflects a former political status of Argyll. Lorn was a maritime district, located on Scotland's west coast, on the eastern shore of Loch Linnhe and the Firth of Lorn. The northern border was Loch Leven. The eastern and southern borders were the line of Loch Awe, Loch Avich, and Loch Melfort. Lorne lost its geopolitical status with the passage of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, effective in 1975. It had survived the same act of 1947 and again 1972, which retained most of the traditional local structure. In 1975, two Lorne's appeared, North and South, both now burghs in the county of Argyll, in the region of Strathclyde. With the abolition of the counties in 1996, Argyll and Bute and part of Dumbarton were united into the Argyll and Bute Council Area. It contains only \\"towns and villages.\\" None of them are Lorn. Lorn shattered, so to speak, under the exigencies of time and politics. The firth, however, which had long since acquired the name, remains a living concept. In 2005 much of the eastern side became a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) according to European Union's Habitats Directive. The reefs and skerries of the small islands on that side are deemed habitats of interest. Two of Scotland's 40 defined national scenic areas are also to be found in the firth: the Lynn of Lorn National Scenic Area covers the island of Lismore and the surrounding seas, along with neighbouring areas on the mainland such as Benderloch and Port Appin; whilst the Scarba, Lunga and the Garvellachs National Scenic Area covers the islands of Scarba, Lunga and the Garvellachs lower down the loch.  Geography of the firth  Ordnance Survey map of the northern Firth of Lorn and surrounding area Ordnance Survey map of the southern Firth of Lorn and surrounding area The naming of the firth after Lorn, a major province on its eastern shore, reflecting the geopolitical power distribution of the times, became less apt as Lorn receded and disappeared. Much of Lorn bordered Loch Linnhe, a fiord to the north that, for whatever reason, escaped being included in the firth. Moreover, the firth extended far to the south of Lorn. To some writers, the name was to be extended south to Colonsay, but to others it went only as far south as the Garvellachs. The official maps of the British Empire did not resolve the exact borders of the firth. Admiralty chart 2724, mapping the coast from the North Channel, places the label, “Firth of Lorn,” on only the narrowest part of the firth, leaving the reader to guess how far south it applied, and the concomitant Ordnance Survey map follows the same convention. The waters between the open Atlantic to the north of the North Channel and the named inner firth are an undefined and unnamed lagoon. In the last two or three decades the firth has become the subject of geologic, hydrologic and biologic field studies undertaken by research organizations working for, or with the permission of, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), a Non-Departmental Public Body of the Scottish Government, which implements the acts of the Scottish Parliament. The recommendations of SNH are usually binding. It has responsibility for the study, protection, and allowed use of Scotland’s natural resources including the Firth of Lorn. Although there is no universally binding geopolitical terminology apart from that defined by legislation, the SNH – in promulgating research – has in fact endorsed a more precise definition of the firth. Prior to the establishment of the SAC of 2005, the SNH was one organization of a consortium funding the Broadscale Mapping Project, 1996-1998, conducted by the SeaMap Research Group. It conducted surveys by a variety of methods, mainly electronic, mapping the presence of benthic communities in a number of areas, including the Firth of Lorn. The report of this survey, which was instrumental in getting the SAC designated, defines the firth as follows. The “Inner Firth of Lorn” is the waters directly south of the peninsula between Loch Buie and Loch Spelve on Mull and east of the peninsulas between Loch Spelve and Duart Bay. The waters around the islands on the east side of the firth are included, being in the current SAC, even though they may have their own names. The “Outer Firth of Lorn” is the waters south of the Ross of Mull as far as the west coast of the Isle of Jura. There is no indication that the Sound of Jura is to be considered in the firth, even though its northern portion was in the study area. The inner firth's northeast end forms a junction with several other arms of the sea, namely Loch Linnhe, the Lynn of Lorne, Loch Etive, and the Sound of Mull. Loch Spelve and Loch Don on the Isle of Mull and Loch Feochan on the mainland are inlets of the Firth of Lorn. On the southeast side, there are also several channels and sounds in the Slate Islands. The Ordnance Gazetteer of 1882 cites a length of from the intersection of Loch Linnhe and the Sound of Mull, with widths of from , inclusive of the islands on the east side, such as Kerrera and the Slate Islands. The west side is an ample deep-water channel leading ultimately inland to the Caledonian Canal. Language and legend Although the English word firth, the Gaelic equivalent linne (as in Linne Foirthe, Firth of Forth), and all the major firth names, have been in use since proto-historic times in Scotland, the combination “Firth of Lorn” was not innovated until the late 19th century. Lorn is presumed in modern Gaelic dictionaries to be a syncope of its Gaelic form Latharna, as is the parallel Larne, of northern Ireland.For example, such an implication is to be found in . An explicit statement of the syncope can be found in Whether the –th- originated as a phoneme or as a non-phonetic grapheme, and to what degree Latharna was ever pronounced as such, or whether the syncope took place entirely in English, are matters of regional and historical Scottish Gaelic orthography. Moreover, the etymology of Latharna remains uncertain.Different theories exist. In one, Lorne and Larne are remnants of the kingdom of Dál Riata, a post-classical state populated by the earliest known Scots extending over both County Antrim in northern Ireland and Argyll in Scotland. Its dissolution left Scots in Britain, to find union with the British Picts, and others to remain Irish. The proto-Celtic form of Latharna is uncertain. Certainly, Lorn or Lorne, earlier Loarn, has been attested for at least several centuries in Latin (Lorna) and English. For example, the 11th Scottish Parliament of James VI in 1587 called for a roster of clans pending legislation that affected them as landlords. Present were the “Stewartes of Lorne, or of Appin” from the “Hielandes and Isles.”. At that time Lorn, like the rest of the highlands, was speaking mainly Gaelic. A Stuart ownership of Appin and Lorne is entirely consistent with the Dál Riata theory;The descent of the royals of Scotland is a tortuous path of many branches, to which much legend is attached, but according to the gist of history and linguistic classification there can be no doubt that Lorne was colonized by Irish speakers, a language that originated in Ireland. moreover, there is easy access through the valleys of the east to Perth, ancient capital of Scotland. The firth of Lorn was a major conduit to the west of Scotland, yet there was no language concept of it as a separate body of water. It remained the Atlantic, or at most the coast of Lorne. Some historical considerations There was an exception to this early Scottish refusal to demark the firth as a separate body: the island of Lismore, Scotland (not to be confused with the various Irish Lismores), blocks the entry to Loch Linnhe in such a way as to create a shelter from weather in the Firth of Lorn. In 1816 the commissioners appointed by the British government to complete the Caledonian Canal reported that ships of 300-400 tons were running into Linnhè Loch to shelter from the weather in the firth. The loch was recognized far earlier, but not under that name. Some crown-sponsored sailing directions by a pilot, Alexandre Lindsay, who navigated for James V of Scotland on his voyage around Scotland in 1535, have survived in French from 1583. The book suggests legs for transit of the vessels of the time down the west coast of Scotland, being careful to avoid dangerous waters, which it also lists. From Ardnamurchan one sails WSW to Lismore, Scotland, necessarily in that direction through the Sound of Mull. Lismore is stated to be located in the mouth of Loch Abir, which is evidence that Loch Linnhe was then called Loch Abir. The name, however, had already transferred itself to the district, Loquahabir, or Lochaber. Lorn is not mentioned among the other fourteen “provinces” of Scotland, but “Argadia,” or Argyll, is, suggesting that Lorn was part of Argyll. The Coast of Lorne is mentioned in connection with the tides. The islands along the coast of Lorn are listed. The next leg of the circumnavigation doubles back on itself to the harbor of Loch Spelve on Mull, from there to Colonsay, from there to Islay, and from there to Kintyre. This preference for the west of the firth is perhaps clarified by Lindsay’s description of the passage between Jura and Scarba as “the most dangerous waters of Europe.” The same definition of Lochaber used by Lindsay can also be found in the ‘’Britannia’’ of the Elizabethan choreographer, William Camden. He said: This quote is from the 3rd edition and translation by Gibson, but the passage is the same but for minor differences as in the 1st edition of 1586. :”Logh-Aber. a Lake that insinuates it self so far into the Land out of the Western Sea, that it would meet the Lake of Ness, did not the hills, which lie between, separate them....”  Geology of the firth  The long narrow basin forming the firth is part of the Great Glen Fault, which runs through its namesake, the Great Glen, and Loch Linnhe before joining with the Firth of Lorn, whence it runs further southwest across Ireland. Climate Tidal conditions in and around the Firth of Lorn cause a number of phenomena, such as the Falls of Lora at the outlet of Loch Etive, and whirlpools and standing waves in the Gulf of Corryvreckan between Scarba and Jura. In popular culture The Firth of Lorne featured as the location for the boat chase near the end of the second James Bond film From Russia with Love, released in 1963.

First performance The play was first performed at London's Wyndham's Theatre on 9 October 1900 and ran for 209 performances. The original cast included Charles Wyndham as Sir Daniel Carteret, Mary Moore as Lady Eastney and Lena Ashwell as Mrs. Dane (her performance in this role launched Lena Ashwell's career). A touring cast played in the US from 31 December 1900 to April 1901. Structure and setting The play has four acts. All the action takes place in the imaginary village of Sunningwater, about twenty-five miles from London. The first and second acts are set in the blue drawing room at Lady Eastney's, two or three weeks apart. The third and fourth acts are set in the library at Sir Daniel Carteret's on the following Wednesday afternoon and Saturday evening. Plot The story focuses on Mrs. Dane's betrothal to Lionel, adopted son of Sir Daniel who is a famous judge. Rumours have been spread in Sunningwater that young widow Mrs. Dane is actually Felicia Hindermarsh, involved in a tragic scandal following an affair with a married man in Vienna. Before Sir Daniel consents to the marriage, he attempts to put down the rumours and clear Mrs. Dane's reputation. With others, such as Lady Eastney, he starts looking into Mrs. Dane's past, guided by his experience as a judge. Mrs. Dane produces plausible evidence of her identity and everyone involved is quite convinced of her innocence. Yet in the end Sir Daniel's professional approach exposes Mrs. Dane's real identity in a famous cross-examination scene. Sir Daniel begins his examination convinced of her story, only wanting to get some final detail. A slip of the tongue by Mrs. Dane (when she says “We had governesses”) reveals the presence of a cousin she has tried to conceal. This sets Sir Daniel on the right track and he follows up skillfully and mercilessly, finally drawing the confession out of her that she is indeed Felicia Hindermarsh and has taken her late cousin's identity. The truth is kept secret, though (mostly due to Lady Eastney's intervention), and Mrs. Dane's reputation in Sunningwater can be reinstated. Nevertheless, they all decide she should leave the village after her marriage with Lionel has become impossible and she complies. In perspective The play follows under the late Victorian/Edwardian tradition of work by playwrights such as Arthur Wing Pinero, which feature a “fallen woman,” or “woman with a past,” who must be punished for past actions. Instead of dying or committing suicide, like many of the women in these plays (as in Pinero's famous play The Second Mrs. Tanqueray), Mrs. Dane is merely exiled to her hometown and the marriage called off. Reception Mrs. Dane's Defence was generally well received, though the morals promoted may have seemed old- fashioned by young, more liberal audiences who had seen the plays of George Bernard Shaw or William Archer. There are a number of cinema versions of Mrs. Dane's Defence. The first, a silent film in black and white, was released in 1918, directed by Hugh Ford, starring Pauline Frederick as Mrs. Dane, Frank Losee as Sir Daniel and Maude Turner Gordon as Lady Eastney. Another black and white film Mrs. Dane's Defence was produced by A.V. Bramble and released in 1933, starring Joan Barry as Mrs. Dane, Basil Gill as Sir Daniel and Evelyn Walsh Hall as Lady Eastney.

Nearly all the women in the Leavitt family attended Mount Holyoke. was a college classmate and lifelong friend of Frances Perkins, the first woman appointed to a Presidential Cabinet.Frances Perkins Collection, Mount Holyoke College, fivecolleges.edu On his mother's side Roswell Gilpatric was related to Harvard College astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt, whose father was the Congregational minister George Roswell Leavitt.George Roswell Leavitt, father of Henrietta Swan Leavitt was born in 1838 in Lowell, Massachusetts, the son of Erasmus Darwin Leavitt, son of Dr. Roswell Leavitt of Cornish, New Hampshire, (born in Charlemont, Massachusetts to Rev. Jonathan Leavitt and Sarah Hooker Leavitt) and his wife Dorothy Ashley of Deerfield, Massachusetts. Rev. Horace Hall Leavitt, American missionary to Japan and grandfather of Roswell Leavitt Gilpatric, was born in 1846 in Lowell, Massachusetts, the son of Erasmus Darwin Leavitt and brother of Rev. George Roswell Leavitt, father of the well- known Harvard astronomer. The two Leavitt brothers had a third brother, Burke Fay Leavitt, who also entered the ministry, as did his son Ashley Day Leavitt. Gilpatric attended Poly Preparatory Country Day School from 1917 to 1920, when the family moved to White Plains, where he attended high school for two years before transferring to the Hotchkiss School, where he was a member of the remarkable class of 1924 that included Charles W. Yost, Paul Nitze, and Chapman Rose. His duties as a scholarship boy, which included waiting on tables and cleaning rooms, kept down his participation in extracurricular activities at Hotchkiss, but he was a member of the Cum Laude Society. He graduated from Yale University in 1928, Phi Beta Kappa; and then from Yale Law School in 1931, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal. Following his graduation, Gilpatric went to work for the New York City law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where he became a partner and where he practiced when not serving in government. Gilpatric owed much of his political cachet to his special relationship with the celebrated lawyer, diplomat and investment banker Robert A. Lovett, to whom Gilpatric was a protégé. Gilpatric served as Under Secretary of the Air Force from 1951-1953. During 1956 and 1957, Gilpatric was a member of the Rockefeller Brothers' Special Studies Project. Gilpatric was a childhood friend of Governor Nelson Rockefeller.Obituary: Roswell Gilpatric, The Independent (London), March 21, 1996 Deputy Secretary of Defense EXCOMM meeting, Cuban Missile Crisis, October 29, 1962: Roswell Gilpatric at second from President Kennedy's left Gilpatric joined the new Kennedy administration in 1961 as part of the wave of Kennedy appointments. His appointment was unusual: he was one of the few Pentagon leaders handpicked by the new President. Fearing that the new Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, was inexperienced in Washington's ways, Kennedy chose Gilpatric to add experience to his Defense team.Brains Behind the Muscle, TIME Magazine, April 7, 1961 McNamara was known as a \\"whiz kid\\", a Midwestern industrial production wunderkind. But Kennedy sensed that McNamara would need a strong lieutenant who was savvy in the ways of Washington. Kennedy chose Gilpatric as the Pentagon's number two, passing over Paul Nitze, Gilpatric's old classmate from Hotchkiss, who had wanted the job.The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made: Acheson, Bohlen, Harriman, Kennan, Lovett, McCloy, by Walter Isaacson, Evan Thomas, Simon and Schuster, New York, 1986 It was a propitious appointment: within a few months, the dashing Eastern lawyer and his Midwestern boss were finishing each other's sentences. McNamara frequently started out with the expression: \\"Ros and I....\\" As the Cuban crisis began to unfold, Gilpatric was appointed to the EXCOMM team, the top-level working group appointed by President Kennedy to assess the Soviet missile threat in Cuba. At one point during the tense standoff of the Cuban Missile Crisis, McGeorge Bundy was arguing for United States bombing of Cuba to eliminate the threat of a Soviet nuclear attack. McNamara countered, arguing that there should be no bombing because the Soviet Russian response was unpredictable. It was at this critical moment that Gilpatric stepped in to settle the argument. \\"Essentially, Mr. President,\\" Gilpatric was recorded telling Kennedy, \\"this is a choice between limited action and unlimited action, and most of us think it is better to start with limited action.\\" It was Gilpatric's intervention that changed the direction of the discussion, according to Harvard professor and former Department of Defense official Graham T. Allison, who authored a book, Essence of Decision, about the crisis. Proposing the blockade was McNamara and Gilpatric's solution to providing President Kennedy with a strong response - but short of the airstrike that McGeorge Bundy and others were pushing. By crafting their solution, and with the normally reticent Gilpatric speaking up forcefully for it, the two managed to change the thrust of policy.Roswell L. Gilpatric, Lawyer and Kennedy Aide, Dies at 89, The New York Times, March 17, 1996 The President followed Gilpatric and McNamara's recommendation. President Kennedy signing order authorizing naval blockade of Cuba, as urged by Roswell Gilpatric Gilpatric was not always so dovish. He often took a hard line against the Communist threat, and was not above using force in other matters of international security. In the Eisenhower administration, Gilpatric headed a secret task force charged with \\"preventing Communist domination of Vietnam.\\" Gilpatric argued forcefully for U.S. commitment to halt the Communist threat in South Vietnam.At one point Gilpatric's name was bandied about by President Johnson as a replacement for the job of U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam following the resignation of Henry Cabot Lodge. Then-National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy told the President that Gilpatric would be an able replacement for the departing Lodge. In his position with the Kennedy administration, Gilpatric later signed off on the overthrow of the Diem government.Although Gilpatric signed off on an overthrow of the pro-American Diem government by military coup, there is no indication that Gilpatric or his boss knew that the Diem family would be murdered. Gilpatric was also a member of a special task force which hatched \\"Operation Mongoose\\", a dirty tricks campaign aimed at destabilizing the government of Fidel Castro in Cuba. At the same time, Gilpatric showed that he could be intellectually flexible on occasion. When it came to the admission of China into the United Nations, for instance, Gilpatric argued forcefully in a letter to The New York Times, written during his Eisenhower years, that the United States should stop trying to block the Communist country's admission into the international governing body. \\"By no longer trying to block Communist China's admission to the United Nations the United States might be able to bring about a reduction in tensions in southeast Asia that would lessen the chances of further Communist 'nibbling' or 'brush-fire' type of aggression.\\" Robert Kennedy and His Times, Arthur Meier Schlesinger, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Houghton Mifflin Books, 2002 Gilpatric did not always face an easy task while acting as go-between for the Pentagon generals and the White House. For example, President Kennedy developed such an intense dislike of General Curtis Lemay The excitable General Lemay is said to have inspired the part of the crazed general played by actor George C. Scott in Stanley Kubrick's film Dr Strangelove that every time his name came up, Kennedy went ballistic. \\"I mean he just would be frantic at the end of a session with LeMay\\", Gilpatric recalled, \\"because, you know, LeMay couldn't listen or wouldn't take in, and he would make what Kennedy considered ... outrageous proposals that bore no relation to the state of affairs in the 1960s. And the President never saw him unless at some ceremonial affair, or where he felt he had to make a record of having listened to LeMay, as he did on the whole question of an air strike against Cuba. And he had to sit there. I saw the President right afterwards. He was just choleric.\\"JFK's Second Term, Robert Dallek, The Atlantic, June 2003 It was Gilpatric's calm demeanor and good judgment, wrote Robert F. Kennedy, that led his brother the President to rely on Gilpatric, especially in times of crisis. When Robert McNamara met the Brooklyn-born lawyer at Kennedy's suggestion, according to historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., he found Gilpatric \\"easy, resourceful and intelligent, and the partnership was immediately sealed.\\" Gilpatric made himself an \\"indispensable\\" figure in the Kennedy administration, wrote longtime JFK aide Ted Sorensen. As an attorney, Gilpatric represented aviation inventor and high-tech pioneer Sherman Fairchild, who left Gilpatric a bequest in his will. Gilpatric was awarded an honorary degree by Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, citing his years of government service, as well as his part-time residency in Maine. Alleged lover of Jackie Kennedy Gilpatric sometimes attracted the attention of the press in his personal life, and he was often linked romantically to former First Lady Jackie Kennedy.\\"Dear Ros,\\" TIME magazine, Feb. 23, 1970 A fellow Wall Street attorney offered for sale in the 1970s a trove of personal letters between Gilpatric and the former First Lady. The correspondence spanned five years. The controversial airing of his private correspondence with the former First Lady so annoyed Gilpatric that he formally requested that four letters written to him by the wife of Aristotle Onassis be withdrawn for sale by the auction house as they had been stolen from his New York City law office at Cravath. Mount Desert Island, Maine, burial place of Roswell Leavitt Gilpatric After her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, Jackie Kennedy Onassis wrote to Gilpatric: \\"I hope you know all you were and are and will ever be to me. With my love, J.\\" Gilpatric maintained that he and the former First Lady had been only friends, although he was her frequent escort and many press accounts suggested they had a romantic relationship. \\"In private,\\" said The Independent in its obituary, \\"he was widely believed to have been the lover of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.\\" Between marriages, Gilpatric had frequently accompanied the former First Lady to Palm Beach, Florida, where Gilpatric had a home.Reaching for Glory, Lyndon Johnson's Secret White House Tapes, 1964-1965, Michael R. Beschloss, Lyndon Baines Johnson, Published by Simon and Schuster, New York, 2001, Watergate Another strange twist involved Gilpatric after his death, when a 2008 book by former acting director of the FBI L. Patrick Gray alleged that Gilpatric, back in private practice and with Time magazine as a client at the time of the Watergate break-in, learned from sources at the magazine that a senior official at the FBI was leaking to Sandy Smith, one of its reporters. Gray claimed that outraged by such behavior, Gilpatric tipped off Nixon administration officials to the identity of the official.Gray III, L. Patrick; Gray, Ed (2008), In Nixon's Web: A Year in the Crosshairs of Watergate, Times Books/Henry Holt, , p. 133 In Gray's version of events, Gilpatric called his acquaintance former Attorney General John Mitchell and told Mitchell that the informer was FBI official W. Mark Felt, the same official later identified by other sources to be Deep Throat. Mitchell in turn, Gray claimed, urged then- Attorney General Richard G. Kleindienst to pressure Gray to fire Felt. In early 2008, Gilpatric's son John threw cold water on the claim. Roswell Gilpatric had never mentioned knowing John Mitchell, his son told The New York Times.Ex-F.B.I. Chief's Book Revisits Watergate, The New York Times, March 9, 2008 But as recorded by the then-secret Nixon White House taping system, Nixon, Gray and chief domestic adviser John Ehrlichman appear to confirm Gray's version in a conversation recorded on February 16, 1973 as the three discussed the alleged press leaks by Mark Felt. During the discussion, Nixon suggested that they bring in Felt's accuser: > President: Well, why don't you get in the fellow that's made the charge, > then. > Ehrlichman: Well, maybe that's (unintelligible) > President: Of course he's, of course he's, he's not a newsman, on the other > hand. > Ehrlichman: No. > President: He's a lawyer... > Ehrlichman: That's right. > President: ...for Time. > Gray: I know who he is, Mr. President.Transcript of a Recording of a > Conversation of February 16, 1973 between President Nixon, John Ehrlichman > and L.

Die Synagoge in Rödelsee was a Hebrew bibliographer, publisher, and teacher. He was born in Rödelsee, Germany. He embraced Christianity in Rome. He was employed in copying Hebrew manuscripts, and for this purpose visited the libraries of Paris, Louvain, and Rome. In 1544 he edited and printed at Augsburg a Judaeo- German translation of the Pentateuch and the Haftarot, dedicating it to Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter, custodian of the Hebrew department of the Munich Library. Grünbaum (Jüdisch-Deutsche Chrestomathie, p. 14) thinks that Æmilius copied from the Cremona edition of 1540. The translation is, on the whole, the same which was used in 1901 in Poland. Perles supposes that Æmilius, together with Isaac of Günzburg, was the editor of the Judaeo-German Sefer midot (Book of Virtues), published at Isny in 1542. In 1547 Æmilius was appointed professor of Hebrew at Ingolstadt; and in the following year he published an anti-Jewish pamphlet. In 1562 he edited a Judaeo-German translation (in German characters) of the Books of Samuel, without, however, making known that it was a copy of a similar translation—though in Hebrew letters—published in Augsburg, 1543, by Chayyim Schwarz. In 1574 he was engaged for forty-six weeks at the Munich Library in making and revising the catalogue of Hebrew manuscripts and books. Thus Paulus Æmilius was the first Jewish bibliographer.

It is also known as pilonidal sinus. However, unlike pilonidal sinus in humans, the dermoid sinus in dogs is a neural tube defect.ACVS. Dermoid Sinus. https://www.acvs.org/small-animal/dermoid-sinus. Dermoid sinus is sometimes also confused with dermoid cyst (a teratoma). A dermoid sinus is rare in dogs and cats. It can appear as single or multiple lumps on the dorsal midline. The sinus is caused in the embryonic stage of development. In normal development, the neural tube from which the spine develops separates from the skin. In the case of a dermoid sinus, this separation has not fully taken place. The result is that in some cases, the dermoid sinus remains connected to the animal's spinal cord; in other cases, the sinus terminates in a \\"blind sac\\" that is less dangerous to remove.PetPlace.com. \\"Dermoid Sinus.\\" Dr. Bari Spielman, Dr. Rhea Morgan (ed.) http://www.petplace.com/dogs/dermoid-sinus/page1.aspx Histologically, the dermoid sinus contains hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. If the sinus becomes infected, it can result in meningitis and myelitis, symptoms of which are spinal pain, rigidity, and fever. In serious cases, the condition can be life-threatening.RRCUS. \\"Dermoid Sinus in the Rhodesian Ridgeback. Diane Jacobsen. http://rrcus.org/assets/html/breedinfo/dermoid/dermoid.htm . See this page also for a detailed discussion of how to locate dermoid sinuses in puppies. The dermoid sinus gene is believed by some to be recessive, meaning that the animal must receive one defective gene from each parent in order to develop the condition. Where one parent carries the gene and the other does not, the offspring remain carriers and can continue to pass the defective gene on to their offspring in turn.See Spielman, supra. http://www.petplace.com/dogs/dermoid-sinus/page1.aspx Others believe that the dermoid sinus condition is more appropriately characterized as polygenic, involving multiple genes.See Jacobsen, supra. http://rrcus.org/assets/html/breedinfo/dermoid/dermoid.htm In any case, because of the genetic nature of this potentially dangerous condition, most breeders and veterinarians advise against breeding animals that have a dermoid sinus, or have a parent that is known to carry the gene. Surgical excision is the only remedy for this condition, with veterinary surgeons removing abnormal tissue and closing any connections to the spine, In some cases, regrowth of the sinus occurs. A variety of tests, such as a myelogram or a fistulogram may be undertaken to determine how deep the sinus goes. Other, more basic tests, such as a complete blood count, biochemical profile, and urinalysis can be performed to determine if infection or other problems exist.

They are co-founders of Soma Quality Recordings. Their music style consists of house and techno. History McMillan and Meikle's first club event was a weekly Thursday night called Black Market, in the Glasgow club, Fury Murrys. They played a mix of house, funk and rap. In early 1988, they were approached by Steven Sleepman (aka Steven Workman), after he heard his first acid house track on DJ Segun's late night show on Radio Clyde. During a brief stint PRing for Club Eden, Sleepman secured a Saturday night at Glasgow's Tin Pan Alley, which was to become the home of Slam. Dave Clarke, an original founding partner of Black Market ran PR with Sleepman. Prior to the launch of her musical career Dot Allison (a future musical collaborator) worked with the PR team, and DJ Harri was a regular guest on the turntables. Slam then launched a Friday night at the Sub Club called Joy. Black Market still kept its own musical identity throughout the Second Summer of Love, playing an eclectic mix of musical genres. Shortly after, Tennent's Lager’s marketing agency approached Slam with a sponsorship deal to tour Scotland's clubs over a period of two years. The tour ultimately led to Slam's residency at T in the Park and increased their nationwide profile. Slam have released singles since the mid-1990s, including \\"Positive Education\\", \\"Eterna\\" and \\"Lifetimes\\". They co-founded Soma Quality Recordings in 1991, along with label boss Dave Clarke. More recently, Slam Events was launched - a subdivision of Soma that deals mainly with the promotion of Slam and Slam nights. Slam were the resident DJs at Pressure, a monthly event promoted by Soma and Slam Events which occurred on the last Friday of every month at The Arches in Glasgow, which was later relocated to SWG3 and rebranded as Maximum Pressure after The Arches nightclub was closed in 2015. They also have a residency at the Sub Club in Glasgow at another Soma and Slam Events night called Return to Mono. They have also been resident DJs at Fabric in London. For the last 10 years Slam have curated and played in the Slam Tent, at T in the Park, and they have appeared on BBC Radio 1's \\"Essential Mix\\" six times between 1994 and 2008, as well as appearing at Bestival in 2008.

The chain operates about 563 locations (as of June 2018) in 49 U.S. states and in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Philippines, Mexico, Taiwan, and South Korea. It is known for its free buckets of peanuts at each table along with free dinner bread rolls. History Texas Roadhouse was founded on February 17, 1993, at the Green Tree Mall in Clarksville, Indiana; across the Ohio River from Louisville. Founder W. Kent Taylor lived in Colorado and worked at nightclubs and restaurants there, having aspirations to attend a culinary school. In 1990, Taylor returned to his hometown of Louisville. He began work as a Kentucky Fried Chicken manager, and had dreams to open a Colorado-themed restaurant. Former Kentucky Governor John Y. Brown, Jr. helped Taylor fulfill his dream by backing him with $80,000. In 1991, Taylor opened Buckhead Hickory Grill, the chain that would eventually become Buckhead Mountain Grill. Taylor was his own executive chef. Brown invested more money and wanted to open a second store in Clarksville, but complications in the partnership caused it to fall apart. Brown had elected to pursue another steak concept without Taylor, leaving Taylor with the decision to either stay committed to Buckhead, or attempt to start a new business. He decided to go with the latter, however, he had trouble finding investors to help him launch the new concept. Taylor was turned down by many potential investors and found himself wondering if his idea for a new concept was a mistake. Finally, Taylor met someone while he was managing at Buckhead through Scott Canfield that seemed interested in investing. Dr. John Rhodes became interested in Taylor's proposition of the new steak restaurant concept that Taylor showed to him through drawings on papers and cocktail napkins. Taylor was able to convince Dr. Rhodes and several of his colleagues to invest $100,000 each in 1992. A year later in 1993, the first Texas Roadhouse in Clarksville, Indiana opened its doors.The Legendary Journey, Texas Roadhouse. Page 6-8 In 1994, Taylor sold his shares in Buckhead Mountain Grill to focus solely on Texas Roadhouse. In 1993, the second Texas Roadhouse opened in Gainesville, Florida. In 1994, three additional restaurants opened in Cincinnati, Ohio, Clearwater, Florida, and Sarasota, Florida. These three locations would all close due to lack of strong management, poor building locations, and poor food quality. Kent Taylor was forced to decide how to continue the success of the first two restaurants in Clarksville and Gainesville, while dealing with the failures of the three new stores. Taylor decided that better in-store training, building designs, and restaurant decor would help improve Roadhouse's growth. Taylor also hired a promising chef who worked in Louisville, Kentucky, named Jim Broyles. Broyles was hired as the director of food and beverages, and transformed the way Roadhouse prepared and served food. He helped bring the restaurant up to the 'legendary' standards it holds itself to today.The Legendary Journey, Texas Roadhouse. Page 10-11 The chain expanded rapidly in the late 1990s, and by the end of 1999, 67 restaurants had been opened. In 2004, Roadhouse became a public company. In September 2011, Texas Roadhouse started their international expansion, with the first international location in Dubai, UAE. In April 2020, CEO Kent Taylor announced he would give up his base salary and bonus for the remainder of the calendar year in order to pay \\"front-line\\" employees amid the coronavirus pandemic.

After a gunman had opened fire at the station, eventually killing two officers, police cordoned off the area, forcing some local businesses to close for a few hours. Due to large crowds lining the route of the funeral procession for the fallen officers, several businesses were forced to close a second time. The current manager of Texas Roadhouse claimed losses of $9,000 due to these closures and requested that this lost revenue offset the $5,000 of fines the store had accrued due to alarm malfunctions. The claim was denied and prompted the FCPD to contact the firm's corporate headquarters in Louisville. Chain officials apologized weeks later and made a donation to a trust fund for the officers' families. They also said the manager had been disciplined. The story of this controversy has been circulating as a viral email beginning around 2006, and verified by urban legend and fact checking website Snopes.com. Also, a crisis management firm has used this controversy as an example of poor crisis management and public relations.

Early life and career Keyes was born in Brimfield, Massachusetts. While still a youth, he moved with his family to Kennebec County, Maine. Although his father, Justus, was renowned as a physician and surgeon, Erasmus decided to pursue a military career and enrolled in the United States Military Academy. He graduated 10th out of a class of 45 in 1832, and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery. Keyes served in Charleston Harbor during the nullification crisis of 1832-33, and served as an aide to General Winfield Scott from 1837 to 1841. Keyes was promoted to captain on November 30, 1841. He served in various garrisons until 1844 and then functioned as an artillery and cavalry instructor at West Point.There are inconsistencies in the cited sources as to the years that Keyes served at West Point. Meehan has service until 1848, yet Boatner has until 1858. This latter date is in error as Keyes was in Oregon and Washington Territory from at least December 1855, per Bancroft, p. 123. During 1844, he was a member of the Academy's Board of Visitors. After his service at West Point, he was then sent with the 3rd U.S. Artillery Regiment in 1854 around Cape Horn to California and served on the Pacific frontier in garrison duty and campaigns until 1860.Rodenbough and Haskin, pp. 328-50. While there Keyes served in the Pacific Northwest from the winter of 1855 in the Puget Sound War. Keyes's artillery Company M was sent to Fort Steilacoom. While there, in January 1856, he made two attempts to capture Chief Leschi but without success.Bancroft, pp. 123-25. March 4, 1856, he and 100 Regulars fought a skirmish at the White River and Muckleshoot Prairie.Bancroft, p. 163. During the Spokane – Coeur d'Alene – Paloos War Captain Keyes was sent ahead with a detachment of dragoons to establish Fort Taylor and a ferry crossing the Snake River for Colonel George Wright's army. In the following campaign he commanded four companies of rifle armed artillerymen against the allied tribes at the Battle of Four Lakes.Bancroft, p. 185. Shortly after this battle, Keyes received his commission of major on October 12, 1858. General Scott appointed Keyes his military secretary on January 1, 1860, a position Keyes filled until April 1861. Civil War At the outbreak of the Civil War, Keyes was promoted to colonel of the 11th U.S. Infantry on May 14, 1861. He then served briefly on the staff of New York Governor Edwin D. Morgan until June 25, 1861, overseeing that state's raising of militia. Keyes in uniform as a colonel in the 11th U.S. Infantry before his promotion to brigadier general. At the First Battle of Bull Run, Keyes commanded the 1st Brigade, 1st Division (Tyler), and then led Keyes's Brigade, before assuming command of a division from November 9, 1861, to March 13, 1862. In August 1861 he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general of volunteers with date of rank of May 17, 1861, the third-ranking brigadier general in the Army.Eicher, pp. 331, 775. The two higher ranking brigadier generals were Samuel P. Heintzelman and David Hunter. On March 14, 1862, President Lincoln issued an order forming the Army of the Potomac into corps, Keyes receiving command of the new IV Corps. When Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Peninsula Campaign against Richmond was organized in the spring of 1862, Keyes led in unexceptionable fashion. Keyes saw action at Lee's Mill, Yorktown, Bottom's Bridge, Savage's Station, Seven Pines (Fair Oaks), Charles City Cross Roads, Malvern Hill, and Harrison's Landing. For gallantry at Fair Oaks, Keyes received the brevet of brigadier general in the regular army. After the Seven Days Battles, McClellan promoted all his corps and division commanders to the rank of major general, aside from Keyes, who did not receive a promotion and remained a brigadier general. When the army returned to Washington D.C. in early August, Keyes and one of the two IV Corps divisions were permanently left behind on the Peninsula as part of General John Dix's Department of the James. On March 12, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Keyes for promotion to the grade of major general, U.S. Volunteers, to rank from May 5, 1862 and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 13, 1863.Eicher, John H. and Eicher, David J. Civil War High Commands, p. 704. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001. In addition to the IV Corps, he commanded the Yorktown District, VII Corps, and the division at Suffolk. Among Keyes's other actions were the raid to White House, Virginia, on January 7, 1863, and the expedition to West Point, Virginia, on May 7, 1863. During the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863, Keyes fell afoul of General John Adams Dix's strategic plan to demonstrate heavily against Richmond in order to divert Confederate reinforcements from General Robert E. Lee's army in Pennsylvania. Keyes retreated from a position near what is now Talleysville, Virginia, in the face of what Dix deemed to be inferior forces, so Dix had Keyes removed from command. Although Keyes asked for an investigation of the charges that led to his removal, the request was never granted. He then served on various boards and commissions, including the board for retiring disabled officers from July 15, 1863, until his resignation and retirement from the army on May 6, 1864. Postbellum activities thumb Following his war service, Keyes moved to San Francisco, where he soon became financially successful and prominent. He converted to Catholicism in San Francisco in 1866. He was president of a Mexican gold mining company in 1867-1869, and vice president of the California vine-culture society from 1868 to 1872. He also was engaged in the savings and loan business. General Keyes became a member of the California Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States - a military society of Union officers and their descendants. Keyes was the author of The Rear Guard at Malvern Hill as part of The Century Company's Battles and Leaders of the Civil War series, as well as Fifty Years' Observation of Men and Events (New York, 1884). This was later reprinted as Fighting Indians in Washington Territory (Fairfax, Washington, 1988). His work From West Point to California was published posthumously in 1950.Eicher, p. 331. While on a trip to Europe with his wife, Keyes died in Nice, France, at age 85. He is buried in West Point Cemetery.

Life and Works He was born as Luka Mušicki in Temerin on 27 January 1777. His early education was most carefully conducted by his parents, first he was sent to a Serbian grammar school in Temerin; a German school in Titel; gymnasia (high schools) in Novi Sad and Szeged; and finally took up studying philosophy and law at the University of Pest, though aesthetics and poetry were always his favourite subjects. Edmund Burke, Johann Ludwig Schedius (1787–1847), Győrgy Alajos Szerdahelyi (1740–1808), and German poets Karl Wilhelm Ramler and Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock made a big impact on him. He was also learning Greek and English at the time. On leaving school with little means of support, he devoted himself to letters, and in 1800 published a collection of poems in Serbian magazines and journals. With Georgije Magarašević and Pavel Jozef Šafárik he published the Serpski Letopis.History of the literary cultures of East-Central Europe Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer - 2004 Volume 3 - Page 41 9027234558 \\"In addition to books, it published the journal Serbski Letopis, founded two years earlier by Georgije Magarašević, Pavel Jozef Šafárik, and Lukijan Mušicki in Novi Sad, where Magarašević was professor and Šafárik the director of the Serbian gymnasium.\\" The poems encountered some adverse criticism from the Serbian ecclesiastical hierarchy, but secured for their poet the approbation and friendship of Vuk Karadžić. Henceforward Mušicki's life was steadily devoted to literary production and criticism. Shortly afterwards he became one of the secretaries of Metropolitan Stefan Stratimirović at Sremski Karlovci where he was subjected to a rigorous ecclesiastic supervision. His superiors were suspicious of his translating ancient Latin-speaking poets, like Horace, Lucian, Virgil and Ovid, whenever he had free time, but even more so when they found out that he knew Horace's De arte poetica by heart. Here his intentions of entering upon an academic career was for a time thwarted by his collision with his superiors. In 1802, after he had taken monastic vows and a new name (\\"Lukijan\\"), he was permitted to establish himself as privatdozent, lecturing at the Theological Seminary in Karlovci. Mušicki wrote extensively on aesthetic subjects, and poetry, and as a critic he had considerable influence, but only outside of the monastic community. It was not until 1812, however, that he attained the rank of archimandrite at the Šišatovac Monastery. In 1828, at the age of 51, he was finally elevated from archimandrite to bishop of the Diocese of Upper Karlovci where he spent the remainder of his life. He died in Sremski Karlovci on 15 March 1837, at the age of sixty. Mušicki is principally remembered for his classical poetry and the many translations from the Latin of Horace. Most of his prose, in substance if not in manner, is that of a literary journalist. His lyrics, however, rank high in the context of Serbian 18th-century literature, in pseudo-classicism. As a poet he was imitative: reminiscences of Dositej and Vezilić are noticeable in his patriotic songs; of Goldoni in his lyrical poems. He wrote hastily to satisfy artistic canons; but despite his faults he also had the merits of a pioneer, and in Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and other parts where Serbs live his name will endure. His collected poems and writings first appeared under the title Lukijana Mušickog stihodvorenia (The Works of Lukijan Mušicki) posthumously in Budapest in 1838 and 1840 (in two volumes), and the other two volumes were released in Novi Sad in 1844 and 1847. Legacy A portrait of Lukijan Mušicki done by Novak Radonic in 1858 Born in Temerin, he became a monk, and later abbot of a monastery in Fruška Gora, whose religious poetry in Church Slavonic, a language distant from the spoken koine, but the only literary language of his time, was recognised and valued by the Serbian Orthodox Church. His secular poetry in vernacular tongue was frowned upon, to the point that he was threatened with defrocking, unless he repented, which in the end he did and stopped writing in what will only be justified as a written language by Vuk Karadžić. In the opinion of his contemporaries, Mušicki revived the glories of the 18th century period of pseudo-classicism, and scholars such as Pavel Jozef Šafárik called Mušicki \\"Prince of Serbian Poetry\\", Petar I Petrović-Njegoš referred to him as \\"a genius of our race,\\" while Đura Daničić said Mušicki was \\"the father of contemporary Serbian literature;\\" this is friendly hyperbole. Jernej Kopitar hailed him as \\"the Serbian Horace\\". While such judgements are naturally somewhat exaggerated, there is no doubt that Mušicki takes a very high place among Serbian poets of his day. Indeed, Lukijan Mušicki ranks, like some of his contemporaries, Jovan Muškatirović, Aleksije Vezilić, Emanuil Janković, Vićentije Rakić, Pavle Solarić, Atanasije Stojković among the authors who have both a historical and an intrinsic importance in Serbian literature and science (Janković and Stojković in particular). They represented for the 18th century the literature of their time, and kept alive, the torch handed on to them by their maister Dositej Obradović.

He is most noted for the creation of the character Bob Morane, a hero whose adventures spanned fifty years and went from straight adventure and science-fiction to fantasy. Vernes also wrote the text of many comics albums and animated movies. Dewisme used a number of other pseudonyms, including Jacques Colombo, Robert Davids, Duchess Holiday, C. Reynes, Jacques Seyr, Lew Shannon, Ray Stevens, as well as his real name. Biography Henri Vernes is the child of Valérie Dupuis and Alphonse Léon Dewisme. After his parents separated, he was raised by his maternal grandparents. At age sixteen he dropped out of high school and worked for a time as helper in his father's butcher shop, but eventually went back to school at Enghien. In 1937 he fell in love with a Chinese woman, \\"Madame Lou\\", and went with her on a two-month trip to Canton, using a fake passport. Back in Tournai, in 1938 he married Gilberte, daughter of a diamond cutter; but the marriage dissolved in 1941. During World War II he served in the army's intelligence services. In 1944 he published his first book, La Porte Ouverte (The Open Door). In 1946 he moved to Paris and wrote for a while for an American news agency and French newspapers. Still, he continued writing novels. In 1949 he published La Belle Nuit pour un Homme Mort (Good Night for a Dead Man), and moved back to Belgium. Between 1949 and 1953 Vernes wrote several tales for weekly magazines like Heroïc Albums and Mickey Magazine, under various pen names. In 1953 he was invited to write an adventure novel for the series Marabout–Junior (Éditions Gérard). His Conquérants de l'Everest (Conquerors of the Everest) was an instant success, and he became a leading writer of that collection. Those books saw the debut of Vernes's most popular hero, Bob Morane, and of his main companions Bill Ballantine, Frank Reeves, Aristide Clairembart; as well as of his first villain, Roman Orgonetz. The first comics album, L'oiseau de feu (The Fire Bird) came out in 1959, drawn by Dino Attanasio, and was another resounding success. Between 1959 and 1967 Bob Morane was the star of many more books, albums, a short film, L'espion aux cent visages (The Spy with a Hundred Faces (1960), and a TV series that ran through 26 episodes. Through that period Vernes started several other adventure cycles and introduced several other characters, such as the villain Monsieur Ming (also known as \\"L'Ombre jaune\\" or the Yellow Shadow), Dr Xathan, and Miss Ylang-Ylang. After 1967 the Marabout–Junior collection was reformatted and renamed Pocket Marabout. Vernes continued writing for the series, with old and new characters. His popularity remained strong, and by 1970 the series had sold over 15 million books. In 1974 he started the cycle of Ananké, considered by many to be his masterpiece. However, this success did not save Marabout from the publishing crisis of the 1970s, and in 1977 the series came to an end with issue 142, Bob Morane dans le Triangle des Bermudes (Bob Morane in the Bermuda Triangle). Over the next 28 years, Vernes authored scores of new titles, including the adult Don cycle (whose books he signed \\"Jacques Colombo\\") and supervised many re-issues of his older works. His 200th novel, the Bob Morane adventure La guerre du Pacifique n'aura pas lieu (The Pacific War Will Not Happen) was issued in 1996. Vernes was the subject of a documentary, Henri Vernes, un aventurier de l'imaginaire (1997), and in 1999, at age 81, he was decorated as Officier in the Belgian Order of Arts and Letters. A fan club, Club Bob Morane, was created in 1986 on the hero's 33rd anniversary.

Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser. The greatest variation in the design of steam-electric power plants is due to the different fuel sources. Almost all coal, nuclear, geothermal, solar thermal electric power plants, waste incineration plants as well as many natural gas power plants are steam-electric. Natural gas is frequently combusted in gas turbines as well as boilers. The waste heat from a gas turbine can be used to raise steam, in a combined cycle plant that improves overall efficiency. Worldwide, most electric power is produced by steam- electric power plants, which produce about 89% of all electric generation. The only other types of plants that currently have a significant contribution are hydroelectric and gas turbine plants, which can burn natural gas or diesel. Photovoltaic panels, wind turbines and binary cycle geothermal plants are also non-steam electric, but currently do not produce much electricity. History Reciprocating steam engines have been used for mechanical power sources since the 18th Century, with notable improvements being made by James Watt. The very first commercial central electrical generating stations in New York and London, in 1882, also used reciprocating steam engines. As generator sizes increased, eventually turbines took over due to higher efficiency and lower cost of construction. By the 1920s any central station larger than a few thousand kilowatts would use a turbine prime mover. Efficiency The efficiency of a conventional steam-electric power plant, defined as energy produced by the plant divided by the heating value of the fuel consumed by it, is typically 33 to 48%, limited as all heat engines are by the laws of thermodynamics (See: Carnot cycle). The rest of the energy must leave the plant in the form of heat. This waste heat can be removed by cooling water or in cooling towers. (cogeneration uses the waste heat for district heating). An important class of steam power plants is associated with desalination facilities, which are typically found in desert countries with large supplies of natural gas. In these plants freshwater and electricity are equally important products. Since the efficiency of the plant is fundamentally limited by the ratio of the absolute temperatures of the steam at turbine input and output, efficiency improvements require use of higher temperature, and therefore higher pressure, steam. Historically, other working fluids such as mercury have been experimentally used in a mercury vapour turbine power plant, since these can attain higher temperatures than water at lower working pressures. However, poor heat transfer properties and the obvious hazard of toxicity have ruled out mercury as a working fluid. Steam plant=Condenser Diagram of a typical water-cooled surface condenser Steam- electric power plants use a surface condenser cooled by water circulating through tubes. The steam which was used to turn the turbine is exhausted into the condenser and is condensed as it comes in contact with the tubes full of cool circulating water. The condensed steam, commonly referred to as condensate. is withdrawn from the bottom of the condenser. The adjacent image is a diagram of a typical surface condenser.Air Pollution Control Orientation Course from website of the Air Pollution Training InstituteEnergy savings in steam systems Figure 3a, Layout of surface condenser (scroll to page 11 of 34 pdf pages) For best efficiency, the temperature in the condenser must be kept as low as practical in order to achieve the lowest possible pressure in the condensing steam. Since the condenser temperature can almost always be kept significantly below 100 °C where the vapor pressure of water is much less than atmospheric pressure, the condenser generally works under vacuum. Thus leaks of non-condensable air into the closed loop must be prevented. Plants operating in hot climates may have to reduce output if their source of condenser cooling water becomes warmer; unfortunately this usually coincides with periods of high electrical demand for air conditioning. If a good source of cooling water is not available, cooling towers may be used to reject waste heat to the atmosphere. A large river or lake can also be used as a heat sink for cooling the condensers; temperature rises in naturally occurring waters may have undesirable ecological effects, but may also incidentally improve yields of fish in some circumstances. Feedwater heater A Rankine cycle with a two-stage steam turbine and a single feedwater heater. In the case of a conventional steam-electric power plant using a drum boiler, the surface condenser removes the latent heat of vaporization from the steam as it changes states from vapor to liquid. The condensate pump then pumps the condensate water through a feedwater heater, which raises the temperature of the water by using extraction steam from various stages of the turbine. Preheating the feedwater reduces the irreversibilities involved in steam generation and therefore improves the thermodynamic efficiency of the system.Fundamentals of Steam Power by Kenneth Weston, University of Tulsa This reduces plant operating costs and also helps to avoid thermal shock to the boiler metal when the feedwater is introduced back into the steam cycle. Boiler Once this water is inside the boiler or steam generator, the process of adding the latent heat of vaporization begins. The boiler transfers energy to the water by the chemical reaction of burning some type of fuel. The water enters the boiler through a section in the convection pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum, from where it goes down the downcomers to the lower inlet waterwall headers. From the inlet headers the water rises through the waterwalls. Some of it is turned into steam due to the heat being generated by the burners located on the front and rear waterwalls (typically). From the waterwalls, the water/steam mixture enters the steam drum and passes through a series of steam and water separators and then dryers inside the steam drum. The steam separators and dryers remove water droplets from the steam; liquid water carried over into the turbine can produce destructive erosion of the turbine blades. and the cycle through the waterwalls is repeated. This process is known as natural circulation. Geothermal power station in Iceland Geothermal plants need no boiler since they use naturally occurring steam sources. Heat exchangers may be used where the geothermal steam is very corrosive or contains excessive suspended solids. Nuclear plants also boil water to raise steam, either directly passing the working steam through the reactor or else using an intermediate heat exchanger. Superheater After the steam is conditioned by the drying equipment inside the drum, it is piped from the upper drum area into an elaborate set up of tubing in different areas of the boiler, the areas known as superheater and reheater. The steam vapor picks up energy and is superheated above the saturation temperature. The superheated steam is then piped through the main steam lines to the valves of the high-pressure turbine.

MK is for Musiek Kanaal (Music Channel) and 89 was the original channel number on DStv satellite decoders. When the channel number was changed to 324, the channel was renamed to MK. At the end of July 2013 DSTV cancelled the channel and opted to move it to its audio bouquet due to lack of viewers. MK maintained an active online presence on their YouTube Channel, Facebook Page and Website. Even though the channel does not feature exclusively Afrikaans music, it has seen a tremendous boost for the resurging Afrikaans music scene, especially \\"indie\\" type of music. The coincidence of the channel's launch with a resurgence in South African filmmaking has helped stimulate the creation of high quality music videos, which has driven the look of the channel to a level that few could have anticipated at launch. While the MTV influence in MK is apparent, it has managed to create an identity that is generally preferred compared to the international nature of the big music channels. MK ceased to exist on the linear platform and is now trying to compete in a digital way on an international platform. Shows on the channel *\\"Hoordosis\\" (A wordplay on the word oordosis which means overdose, and hoor means hear in Afrikaans). This show has the most airtime as it is a random collection of music videos. *\\"MyMK\\".

Tries to negotiate to keep Letterman on NBC. * John Agoglia: NBC executive from 1980 to 1998 and supporter of Leno. Reception In a review of The Late Shift for The New York Times Book Review, Jon Katz wrote, \\"[This] is a reporter's book, unfailingly balanced, thoroughly researched, filled with scoops and fresh details. Even though CBS's wooing and winning of Mr. Letterman was the subject of enormous publicity, Mr. Carter's book makes clear that we knew less than we thought about what was really going on.\\" Katz criticized the book for not going into more depth about Letterman's switch to CBS, writing, \\"As readable as it is, 'The Late Shift' needed to take a more critical, detached look at the long-term significance of Mr. Letterman's move. A number of questions are not addressed.\\" He concluded, \\"'The Late Shift' is nonetheless a powerful story, and ultimately a sad one, filled with casualties as well as winners. Mr. Leno, who has been made to seem a second choice by the very people who elevated him, has been betrayed by his employers in the most basic of ways, and he has not yet recovered.\\" Kim Campbell reviewed the book for The Christian Science Monitor, and commented, \\"More than just a play-by-play account of the actions that followed Johnny Carson's 1991 retirement announcement, Carter's well-written book is a look at the history of the late- night franchise, and of the men who host the shows that we would rather watch instead of going to bed.\\" Campbell described the book as revealing in its assessment of NBC's decision to pass over Letterman for The Tonight Show, concluding, \\"Carter's eye-opening book leaves the impression that NBC will be remembered more for its loss of Letterman, than for its role as creator of late-night television.\\" Lawsuit Helen Kushnick, Jay Leno's manager at the time of Carson's retirement who was pushed out following her heavy-handed tactics, filed a $30 million lawsuit against Bill Carter, claiming libel. Specifically, her case related to a claim that she planted a story about Carson's retirement in a New York City tabloid.Fleming, Michael. \\"Dish: Fox backing off the gay buss\\", Variety, 21 April 1994. The then-pending lawsuit was noted in the closing credits of the film, as the Broadway tune \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" plays. The lawsuit settled out of court for an undisclosed sum; Kushnick died of cancer in August 1996. Film adaptation A film adaption of the book was produced in 1996 by HBO, directed by Betty Thomas, and starring John Michael Higgins as Letterman and Daniel Roebuck as Leno. The film received seven Emmy Award nominations in categories including \\"Outstanding Made for Television Movie\\", makeup, casting, writing, and directing, acting. For her role in the film as Helen Kushnick, actress Kathy Bates won awards from the American Comedy Awards, the Golden Globe Awards, the Satellite Awards, and the Screen Actors Guild Awards. The film was recognized with an award for \\"Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Specials\\" from the Directors Guild of America Awards. Sequel A sequel to The Late Shift called The War for Late Night, based on the controversy involving Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien, The Tonight Show and NBC was released on November 4, 2010.

The war was fought roughly between 1886 and 1894, primarily between Samoans fighting over whether Malietoa Laupepa or Mata'afa Iosefo would be King of Samoa. However, the German military intervened on several occasions. There was also a naval standoff between the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. After the 1889 Apia cyclone destroyed six of the German and American ships stationed at Samoa, the three countries decided that Laupepa would be the King.  Background  Germany fought in Samoa in defense of Tamasese, their choice for Tafa'ifa, the King of Samoa, after the reigning king Malietoa Laupepa was usurped and exiled. Tamasese and his German allies faced a rival faction, headed by popular Samoan chief Mata'afa Iosefo. Germany was looking to expand its new empire and its commercial interests. America, also looking to protect its commercial interests in Samoa, sent three warships—USS Vandalia, Trenton, and Nipsic—to monitor the island. Britain also sent a ship to protect its interests, HMS Calliope. Hawaiian envoys and Malietoa Laupepa on board of the Kaimiloa in 1887. The prime minister of the kingdom of Hawaii Walter M. Gibson had long aimed to establishing an empire in the Pacific. In 1887 his government sent the \\"homemade battleship\\" Kaimiloa to Samoa looking for an alliance against colonial powers. It ended in suspicions from the German Navy and embarrassment for the conduct of the crew.  War  Tensions heightened with the United States after a German shelling of Mata'afa's rebel villages also resulted in destruction of American owned property in 1887. One battle at Vailele in September 1888, following German bombardment of his rebel villages, resulted in Mata'afa's warriors destroying an invading German contingent and plundering their plantations. Throughout the war, the German, American, and British ships were in a naval standoff known as the Samoan crisis. The three western powers finally agreed that Malietoa Laupepa would be restored as King of Samoa in 1889 after a cyclone destroyed both American and German warships at Apia harbour, halting hostilities between the powers. However, the conflict on Samoa went on until 1894, when Laupepa became king again.  Second Samoan Civil War  Nine years later, with the death of Malietoa Laupepa, hostilities broke out again in 1898 in the Second Samoan Civil War. However, this conflict was quickly ended by the partitioning of the island chain at the Tripartite Convention of 1899.

Allies The allies were the Samoan followers of Malietoa Tanumafili I and supporting naval forces from the United States and the United Kingdom who fought against the rebels of Mata'afa Iosefo.Mains, P. John; McCarty, Louis Philippe (1906). The Statistician and Economist: Volume 23. pg. 249 History As result of Malietoa Laupepa's death, Mata'afa Iosefo returned from exile and was elected to power by a council of Samoan chiefs. In response, the British Royal Navy and the U.S. Navy landed forces at Apia in support of Laupepa's son Malietoa Tanumafili I against the German-backed Mataafa. The first battle of the conflict involving the British and Americans was fought at Apia, when the naval forces landed they occupied much of the city, Mataafan forces attacked, so British and U.S. warships in Apia Harbour began bombarding enemy positions around the city. After the conflict, Mataafaite forces retreated to the stronghold of Vailele and thus began several U.S. and British expeditions into the dense jungle to find the chief's men.Mains, pg. 24 At the end of March, a joint expedition of British, U.S., and Samoan forces marched along the coast from Apia towards Vailele. Skirmishes were fought and two villages destroyed as the Samoan rebels retreated. On April 1, the expedition of 26 marines, 88 sailors and 136 Samoans left the coast for an attack on the landward side of Vailele, leaving the protection of naval gunfire support. The cruisers , HMS Tauranga, and the corvette HMS Royalist landed the sailors and marines, Royalist was sent ahead of the expedition to bombard the two forts guarding Vailele plantation.Mains, pg. 24 The Second Battle of Vailele on 1 April was a defeat for the expeditionary forces, they retreated back to Apia and reported their casualties to their commanders who decided to plan for future operations in the area. On April 13, the British frontline was extended just south of Vailele and that day the Matafaans attacked but were repulsed. Another expedition later fought again within Vailele, this time the rebels won again when they withstood a British led attack on the two forts. The engagements occurred near the battlefield where Samoan rebels had defeated German troops in 1889 during the first civil war on the island. A statue of Ensign Monaghan was erected in Spokane, Washington to commemorate the young officer's bravery.Mains, pg. 24 A second battle in Apia took place on 25 April when a small force of Samoans attacked a patrol of U.S. Marines, but were driven off without inflicting any casualties on the Americans. The war eventually resulted, via the Tripartite Convention of 1899, in the partition of the Samoan Islands into American Samoa and German Samoa.

Biography Ma Hualong became the leader of the Jahriyya ca. 1849, succeeding the menhuan's fourth shaykh, Ma Yide (late 1770s - 1849Lipman (1998), p. 179). Although the Jahriyya had been originally created by Ma Mingxin in the central Gansu, by the time of Ma Hualong's succession to the leadership position the order was centered in the northern Ningxia (which in the 19th century was also part of Gansu Province), its headquarters being located in Jinjipu (),Some authors, e.g. Michael Dillon and Kim Hodong, transcribe the town's as Jinjibao (since , meaning \\"fort\\", has pronunciation bao). However, Lipman's Jinjipu is probably more correct, because dictionaries also say that , when used as a suffix in place names, is pronounced pu. a few kilometers south from today's Wuzhong City. Lipman (1998), p. 125 The town of Jinjipu became an important religious and commercial center, and the menhuan's leaders grew wealthy thanks to the order's profitable participation in the caravan trade across Inner Mongolia, between Baotou, Huhhot and Beijing. Since the beginning of the Muslim Rebellion in 1862, Ma Hualong was based at the Jahriyya headquarters in Jinjipu.Lipman (1998), p. 125 The area of his direct influence included the Jahriyya-heavy eastern parts of the 19th-century Gansu Province,Until the early 20th century, Gansu Province also included today's Ningxia and Qinghai i.e. today's Ningxia and easternmost sections of today's Gansu.Dillon (1999), pp. 66-68 While the rebels elsewhere within the 19th- century borders of Gansu had their own leaders - notably, Ma Zhan'ao in Hezhou (now Linxia), Ma Guiyuan in Xining, and Ma Wenlu in Suzhou (Jiuquan), -who, in the view of modern historians, were acting essentially independent from each other, there were Jahriyya members (all owing allegiance to the Ma Hualong) participating in the rebellion throughout the region.Lipman (1998), p. 121 At some points during the rebellion Ma Hualong negotiated with the authorities, and at least once he even surrendered, taking a new name, \\"Ma Chaoqing\\" (\\"one who attends on the Qing\\"). However, instead of disbanding his militias, he continued fortifying Jinjipu, and collaborating with the rebels who had retreated to Gansu from Shaanxi. Ma was besieged in Jinjipu in July 1869 by the Qing forces led by General Zuo Zongtang.Dillon, p. 66. The book does not actually state the year, but it appears to be 1869 from the context. After fortifications outside of the town itself had been captured by the government troops, and starvation started inside the walls, Ma Hualong surrendered in January 1871, hoping to spare the lives of his people. However, once Zuo's troops entered Jinjipu, a massacre followed, with over a thousand people losing their lives. and the town being destroyed. Existing accounts on Ma Hualong's death differ. It is likely that he was executed on Zuo's orders on March 2, 1871, along with his son Ma Yaobang and over eighty rebel officials (supposedly, Zuo sentenced them to death by slicing), although it was said by some that he had been murdered by a traitor from within his own ranks. Family and succession Few of Ma Hualong's family survived the massacre at Jinjipu. Two his grandsons, Ma Jincheng and Ma Jinxi, were sentenced to castration upon reaching the age of 12. Ma Jincheng ended his days as a eunuch slave in Kaifeng in 1890, although the new Jahriyya leader, Ma Yuanzhang (the 1850s - 1920), managed to secretly provide him with some support until his death. The younger grandson, Ma Jinxi, was spirited away, intact, from his Xi'an confinement by Ma Yuanzhang, and was hidden at a Hui household in Hangzhou.Lipman (1998), pp. 179-181). Zuo executed a lot of Ma's relatives, except his daughter and grandson, who was sent to Yunnan. The grandson's name was Ma Tsen-wu. Many years later, Ma Yuanzhang managed to obtain a pardon for Ma Jinxi, and Ma Hualong's grandson returned to Ningxia. A split within the Jahriyya followed, with some members becoming followers of Ma Jinxi, and others holding for Ma Yuanzhang (who claimed descent from the order's founder Ma Mingxin, and was also related to Ma Hualong's family through his marriage). Legacy Siqiliangzi Gongbei According to Jahriyya adherents in Ningxia, Ma Hualong's grave is in Dongta Town, which now is a suburb of Wuzhong City. Accordingly, a tomb shrine called Siqiliangzi gongbei () has been established there. More than 10,000 people from all over China attended a commemoration ceremony (ermaili) at that site in 1985.Gladney, Dru. \\"Muslim Tombs and Ethnic Folklore: Charters for Hui Identity\\" Journal of Asian Studies, August 1987, Vol. 46 (3): 495-532. Adherents of a rival tradition within Jahriyya, however, believe that Ma Hualong's true tomb is in Xuanhuagang, in Gansu's Zhangjiachuan County,Dillon (1989), p. 126; Gladney (1996), p. 50; the place is called \\"Zhanquanchuan\\" in Dillon, however which, coincidentally, was the base of Ma Hualong's successor, Ma Yuanzhang. Some authors try to reconcile the two traditions, by saying that Ma Hualong's body is in Dongta, and the head is in Zhangjiachuan.Gladney (1996), p. 50  References  Jonathan N.

It started in 2000 on WLII-TV Tele Once as a late night show with comedian Silverio Pérez as host, but has evolved into a more youth-oriented format with a focus on celebrity news and interviews. The show usually features interviews to artists and other personalities, music performances, celebrity news, curious facts, and comedy sketches, among other things. Aside of its regular hosts, the show features a team of collaborators that offer their opinions on a wide range of topics from sexuality, movies, and Internet. Despite its hosting changes, the show remained one of the most successful in the island, edging its direct rival, No te Duermas, of Telemundo. Show history=2000: Silverio Pérez In 2000, Anda Pa'l Cara began, with Silverio Pérez as host. During this first year, Pérez focused more on a late night talk show format with a slight focus on political commentary. During this time the show counted with Gabriel Ferri as creative director. 2001-2003: Luis Raúl and Gricel Mamery When Pérez left the show, most people thought its popularity would decline. However, the combination of new hosts - comedian Luis Raúl and Gricel Mamery - and their chemistry, kept the show alive on the charts. During their run, the show changed its format to one more oriented to comedy sketches benefitting from Luis Raúl talent. He brought most of his well-known characters, and several new ones, to the show, infusing it with a lighter format. 2003-2005: Luis Raúl leaves Again, when Luis Raúl left the show in 2003, many thought that audiences would reject the change. A long casting process ensued, and Venezuelan host Daniel Sarcos was picked to join Mamery. Known Puerto Rican host, Sonya Cortes, was also chosen to complete the trio of hosts. This decision angered many local celebrities, who argued the election of a foreign host over a Puerto Rican one. However, after a few months, legal problems concerning Sarcos visa didn't allow him to continue working, and Puerto Rican Rafael José was chosen to replace him. José mostly kept the previous format intact doing comedy sketches, albeit with a slight turn into a more celebrity oriented show. Most audiences embraced the selection and the show kept performing well. José would remain in the show until 2006 when he left to work in the United States. The year before, Mamery had also left the show. 2006-2009: Youngest vision, Rony, Sonya and Alexandra In 2005, when Mamery left the show, she was replaced by young host Alexandra Fuentes. Curiously enough, Fuentes used to play a parody of Mamery in the show Salvese Quien Pueda on WKAQ-TV.

Its route is entirely within the south-central portion of Gwinnett County, connecting the Lilburn area with Snellville. It is named after Ronald Reagan, the 40th president. The highway was spearheaded by then-Gwinnett County chairman Wayne Mason in the mid-1990s. Route description The parkway begins at an intersection with Pleasant Hill Road, northeast of Lilburn. It passes just north of Browne Lake and has an interchange with U.S. Route 29 (US 29) and State Route 8 (SR 8; Lawrenceville Highway). On the northeast side of Bethesda Park is an interchange with Bethesda Church Road, which partially travels through the park. After crossing over the Yellow River, it curves to the southeast and has an interchange with Five Forks–Trickum Road. Then, it meets Webb Gin House Road SW and passes to the west of Eastside Medical Center. At Presidential Circle, the freeway portion of the parkway ends and it continues to the southeast at-grade. Approximately later, the parkway intersects SR 124 (Scenic Highway SW). Here, the roadway continues to the southeast as Pinehurst Road SW. All of Ronald Reagan Parkway is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History The parkway was established in 1995 along the same alignment it runs today. For a short period of time, the parkway had an unsigned designation of State Route 864 (SR 864), even though it is considered a county road. In 2009, new plans were developed to extend Ronald Reagan Parkway as a toll road to directly connect with I-85. On June 23, 2009, Gwinnett County voted to approve a partnership with a private firm to study extending the Ronald Reagan Parkway to I-85. The study cost $1.4 million and was funded by the County. The plans were abandoned in February 2013 due to public concerns about tolls, potential traffic and the road path.

Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge History Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge The swamp has a rich human history including Native American settlement, explorations by Europeans, a massive drainage attempt, and intensive timber harvesting. Native Americans inhabited Okefenokee Swamp as early as 2500 BC.http://www.fws.gov/okefenokee/refugehistory.htm Peoples of the Deptford Culture, the Swift Creek Culture and the Weeden Island Culture occupied sites within the Okefenokee. The last tribe to seek sanctuary in the swamp were the Seminoles. Troops led by General Charles Rinaldo Floyd during the Second Seminole War, 1838–1842, ended the age of the Native Americans in the Okefenokee. The Suwannee Canal Company purchased 238,120 acres (963 km2) of the Okefenokee Swamp from the State of Georgia in 1891 to drain the swamp for rice, sugar cane, and cotton plantations. When this failed, the company began industrial wetland logging as a source of income. Captain Henry Jackson and his crews spent three years digging the Suwannee Canal 11.5 miles (18.5 km) into the swamp. Economic recessions led to the company's bankruptcy and eventual sale to Charles Hebard in 1901. Logging operations, focusing on the cypress, began in 1909 after a railroad was constructed on the northwest area of the swamp. More than 431 million board feet (1,020,000 m3) of timber were removed from the Okefenokee by 1927, when logging operations ceased. The Okefenokee Preservation Society, formed in 1918, promoted nationwide interest in the swamp. With the support of State and local interests and numerous conservation and scientific organizations, the Federal Government acquired most of the swamp for refuge purposes in 1936. In 1937, with Executive Order 7593 (later amended by Executive Order 7994), President Franklin Delano Roosevelt established the refuge, designating it as \\"a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife.\\" The establishment of Okefenokee Refuge in 1937 marked the culmination of a movement that had been initiated at least 25 years earlier by a group of scientists from Cornell University who recognized the educational, scientific, and recreational values of this unique area. In 1974, to further ensure the protection of this unique ecosystem, the interior sections of the refuge were designated a National Wilderness Area. In 1986, the Okefenokee Refuge was designated by the Wetlands Convention as a Wetland of International Importance. Geography Map of Okefenokee NWR Okefenokee NWR has an approved acquisition boundary of 519,480 acres (2,102 km2), which is 123,480 acres (500 km2) larger than its current area. Approximately 371,000 acres (1,500 km2) of the Okefenokee Swamp wetlands are incorporated into the refuge. 353,981 acres (1,432 km2) within the swamp were designated as the Okefenokee Wilderness, a part of the National Wilderness Preservation System when the Okefenokee Wilderness Act was passed in 1974, making it the third largest wilderness east of the Mississippi River. The Okefenokee Swamp is a vast bog inside a huge, saucer-shaped depression that was once part of the ocean floor. The swamp now lies 103 to above mean sea level. Peat deposits, up to thick, cover much of the swamp floor. These deposits are so unstable in spots that trees and surrounding bushes tremble by stomping the surface. Native Americans named the area \\"Okefenokee\\" meaning \\"Land of the Trembling Earth\\". Swamp habitats include open wet \\"prairies\\", cypress forests, scrub-shrub vegetation, upland islands, and open lakes.http://www.fws.gov/Refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=41590 The Okefenokee Swamp is one of the world's largest intact freshwater ecosystems. It has been designated a Wetland of International Importance by the United Nations under the Ramsar Convention of 1971. The swamp is compared through research to wetlands worldwide. It is world-renowned for its amphibian populations that are bio-indicators of global health. Water from the Suwannee River Sill area is used as a standard reference by scientists throughout the world. The slow- moving waters of the Okefenokee are tea-colored due to the tannic acid released from decaying vegetation. The principal outlet of the swamp, the Suwannee River, originates in the heart of the Okefenokee and drains southwest into the Gulf of Mexico. The swamp's southeastern drainage to the Atlantic Ocean is the St. Mary's River, which forms the boundary between Georgia and Florida. The swamp contains numerous islands and lakes, along with vast areas of non-forested habitat. Prairies cover about 60,000 acres (240 km2) of the swamp. Once forested, these expanses of marsh were created during periods of severe drought when fires burned out vegetation and the top layers of peat. The prairies harbor a variety of wading birds: herons, egrets, ibises, cranes, and bitterns. Controlled burn at Okefenokee NWR Refuge staff manages 33,000 acres (130 km2) of uplands which are being restored to once-abundant longleaf pine and wiregrass habitat. Refuge staff and volunteers work to preserve the natural qualities of the swamp, provide habitat for a variety of wildlife, and provide recreational opportunities for visitors. They also conduct prescribed burns in upland areas, thin forests, create wildlife openings, plant longleaf pines, and monitor, manage, and improve wildlife populations and habitat. The Okefenokee is a rainfall-dependent system, and when periods of drought occur, the area becomes susceptible to wildfire.http://www.fws.gov/okefenokee/okefenokee_amphib_fish_mam_rep98.pdf A 20-to-30-year cycle of drought and fire has allowed the Okefenokee to exist as the unique wetland it is. These periods cause changes in the abundance of certain plants (more grasses growing in exposed areas) the nesting success of certain wading birds (failure in extreme drought), and the location of some species of wildlife (fish migrate into deeper lakes and channels and are followed by predators). Wildlife and protected species Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge With its varied habitats, the Okefenokee has become an area known for its abundance of plants and animals. There are 621 species of plants growing in the swamp, including the Longleaf Pine tree. Animals include 39 fish, 37 amphibian, 64 reptile, 234 bird, and 50 mammal species. The Okefenokee Swamp is world renowned for its amphibian populations that are bio- indicators of global health. Wildlife species include Florida raccoons, wading birds, ducks, American alligators and other reptiles, a variety of amphibians, North American river otters, Florida bobcats, raptors, Eastern American red foxes, wild boars, common minks, Virginia white-tailed deer, gray foxes, Florida skunks, Florida black bears, and songbirds. The swamp habitat also provides for threatened and endangered species, such as red-cockaded woodpeckers, wood storks, indigo snakes, gopher tortoises and a wide variety of other wildlife species. Facilities Canoeing in the Okefenokee NWR There are opportunities for hiking, hunting, fishing, canoeing, boating, photography and wildlife observation. Visitor center The Richard S. Bolt Visitor Center at Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was built in 1967, with an auditorium addition in the early 1980s. The building is cedar-sided with open, vaulted ceilings and flagstone floors. It houses exhibits, Okefenokee Wildlife League bookstore sales area, office space for staff and volunteers, storage, and a 100-seat surround-sound auditorium. Chesser Island In the late 19th century, W.T. Chesser and his family settled a small island on the eastern edge of the Okefenokee Swamp. He settled on a 592‑acre (2.4 km2) island, now known as Chesser Island. The Chesser homestead still stands on the island. The last of the Chessers left the island in 1958, but many members of the Chesser family remain in the local area. Fishing Lakes and slow- flowing water trails, called \\"runs,\\"cover much of the Okefenokee. More than 60 lakes dot the refuge, with depths ranging from a few feet to . The largest, Billy's Lake, is 3½ miles long and 100 to wide. Fishing is permitted year round in accordance with Georgia State fishing laws. Using live bait fish or trot lines is prohibited. Canoeing and boating There are of trails in the swamp, of which 70 are open to day-use motorboat and under. Seven overnight shelters are available in the swamp's interior. The refuge has six different boating trails (Red, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, and Brown) giving users a choice of twelve different overnight canoe trips. Trails *Swamp Island Drive – a driving, biking and walking loop. Scattered throughout the drive are walking trails, wildlife openings and hardwood plots.

In modern statutes, the term \\"sexual penetration\\" is widely used, though with various definitions. Biblical source The term derives from carnal, meaning \\"of the flesh\\", and the Biblical usage of the verb know/knew, a euphemism for sexual conduct. Examples of this usage include the first part of the Bible, the Book of Genesis, which describes how Adam and Eve conceived their first child: :\\"And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with [the help of] Jehovah.\\" — Genesis 4:1. And in Lot's plea to the people of Sodom to whom he offered his virgin daughters, in place of his guests: :5 and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. :6 And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him. :7 And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly. :8 Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing, forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof. — Genesis 19:5-8. Legal usage In criminal law, the term has had different meanings at different times and in different jurisdictions. While commonly a mere euphemism for sexual intercourse (not necessarily unlawful), different jurisdictions have defined carnal knowledge (as well as sexual intercourse) as a specific sex act such as contact between a penis and vagina, some laws elaborating this to include even \\"slight penile penetration of female sex organs\\". The definition sometimes includes a set of sex acts that include sodomy, while some statutes specifically exclude such acts. Some laws do not define the term, and leave it to the courts to give it meaning, which also allows them to take into account changing community standards. Carnal knowledge has also sometimes meant sexual intercourse outside of marriage, and sometimes refers to sex with someone under the age of consent. The phrase is often found in this sense in modern legal usage, being equivalent to statutory rape in some jurisdictions, as the term rape implies lack of consent. A related term is carnal abuse, which is defined by Dictionary.com as \\"any lascivious contact with the sexual organs of a child by an adult\\". Usually, but not always, this does not involve penetration. England and Wales Section 18 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828 reads as follows: The crimes of carnally abusing girls referred to were those created by section 17 of the Act. In cases decided under this section it was held that the slightest penetration was sufficient.R v R'Rue (1838) 8 C & P 641; R v Allen (1839) 9 C & P 31 This section was replaced by section 63 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. The term was not used in the Sexual Offences Act 1956, which replaced it, where it appeared, with the term sexual intercourse, in all the provisions consolidated by that Act.

Originally part of Steyr-Daimler-Puch, it became independent when the conglomerate was broken up in 1989. Prior to 1 January 2019, the company was named Steyr Mannlicher AG (). History The company logo 1869–1926 Share of the Oesterreichischen Waffenfabriks-Gesellschaft, issued February 1920 Steyr has been on the \\"iron road\\" to the nearby Erzberg mine since the days of the Styrian Otakar dukes and their Babenberg successors in the 12th and 13th century, and has been known as an industrial site for forging weapons. The privilege of iron and steel production, particularly for knives, was renewed by the Habsburg duke Albert of Austria in 1287. After the Thirty Years' War, thousands of muskets, pistols, and carbines were produced annually for the Habsburg Imperial Army. In 1821, Leopold Werndl (1797–1855), a blacksmith in Steyr, began manufacturing iron parts for weapons. After his father's death, 24-year-old Josef Werndl (1831–1889) took over his factory. On April 16, 1864, he founded the \\"Josef und Franz Werndl & Comp. Waffenfabrik und Sägemühle in Oberletten\\" (Josef and Franz Werndl & Partners Weapons Factory and Sawmill in Oberletten), from which later emerged the \\"Österreichische Waffenfabriksgesellschaft\\" (ŒWG, Austrian Arms-Manufacturing Company), a stock company (AG) since 1869, of which the Steyr Mannlicher firearm production was a part. Werndl's cooperation with engineer Ferdinand Mannlicher (1848–1904), who had patented an advanced repeating rifle in use by the Austro-Hungarian Army, made ŒWG one of the largest weapon manufacturers in Europe. First applied in 1890, the Mannlicher M1901, and the Steyr-Hahn M1912 became milestones in auto-loading pistol technology. At the beginning of World War I, with more than 15,000 employees, production output was 4,000 weapons per day. Aftermath of World War I After the war, weapons production in Steyr was all but entirely prohibited according to the 1919 Treaty of Saint- Germain, and the company faced bankruptcy. To survive, the ŒWG converted their machinery to concentrate on producing Steyr automobiles under chief designers Hans Ledwinka and Ferdinand Porsche, as well as bicycles (colloquially called Waffenräder (\\"weapon bicycles\\")). In 1926 the company changed its name to \\"Steyr-Werke\\". The production of Steyr Mannlicher weapons continued in cooperation with Patronenfabrik Solothurn AG at Zuchwil in neutral Switzerland. World War II After the Austrian Anschluss to Nazi Germany in 1938, the Steyr factories were incorporated into the Reichswerke Hermann Göring industrial conglomerate and the outbreak of World War II provided a brief revival in weapons production. Like many other companies, Steyr Mannlicher relied on forced labour, employing from the Steyr-Münichholz subcamp of KZ Mauthausen. 1950s During the 1950s the Mannlicher–Schönauer full stock rifle experienced a renaissance. Simultaneously, the re-emergence of the Austrian Armed Forces in the Second Republic was the base for new military weapons production. The AUG In the 1970s, Steyr developed an innovative assault rifle, the StG 77. A bullpup design, the StG 77 extensively utilized synthetic materials, and integrated fixed optics.

Life He received a Masters of Arts at Trinity College, Oxford, on 24 July 1567, and became a fellow (although one source says president) there. In 1570, he left for the English College, Douai, and was one of its first three students to be ordained, receiving his orders March 1573 in Brussels. Soon after receiving his Bachelor of Divinity in Douai, on 2 May 1576, he left for England. There he settled in Berkshire, becoming the chaplain of James Braybrooke at Sutton Courtenay, and then of Francis Yate and the Bridgettine nuns who were staying with Yate at Lyford Grange. On 17 July 1581, he was arrested by the government spy, George Eliot, along with Edmund Campion. On 22 July of that same year, he was put in the Tower, where he was tortured. Ford was taken to court along with John Shert on 16 November with a faked charge of conspiracy. It is said he had conspired in places he had never been (Rome and Rheims), on days he had been in England.

In fall 1929, Conrad Hilton began construction. Nineteen days later the stock market crashed and the Great Depression began, yet construction continued. On November 30, 1930, the Hilton Hotel opened. At 239 feet (73 m) it surpassed the O. T. Bassett Tower to become the tallest building in El Paso; it is still the city's fifth tallest building. Designed by Trost & Trost, the hotel is an Art Deco styled 19-story reinforced cast-in-place concrete structure with setbacks at the 16th and 17th floors. It is faced with brown brick and concrete and crowned with a Ludowici clay tile pyramidal roof. The exterior remains largely unaltered from its original form.

The film was remade in 1938 as Crime School with Humphrey Bogart taking over James Cagney's role and Hell's Kitchen with Ronald Reagan in 1939. Plot Racketeer Patsy Gargan is made deputy commissioner of a reform school as a reward from his corrupt political cronies. Initially, he has no interest in the school, but his sympathy for the boys, who are abused and battered by a brutal, heartless warden and his thuggish guards convince him to take the job seriously, as does an attractive resident nurse named Dorothy. Gargan sends Thompson, the superintendent, on vacation and, while he is gone, puts Dorothy's reform ideas into action. The school is functioning well under a system of self-government when Patsy is called back to the city to take care of some political business. Patsy shoots another man during a fight and has to go into hiding. Thompson returns to the school and convinces the boys that Patsy has abandoned them. He then starts running things the old way and, when Dorothy protests over the poor quality of the food served, he fires her. Then one of the boys, Johnny \\"Skinny\\" Stone, dies while in solitary confinement and the boys rebel. Thompson is put on trial by the boys, who find him guilty. Thompson, in a panic, jumps out a window to escape. Pursued by the boys, many of whom carry torches, he scrambles up onto the roof of a barn. The boys immediately set fire to the barn. Dorothy, meanwhile, finds Patsy in his hideout and tells him the whole story. Patsy races back to the school to restore order, but Thompson is dead, having fallen from the roof of the barn. At the picture's end, Patsy decides to give up his political career and stay at the school permanently. CastProduction The film originally went under the title Reform School. It took 36 days to shoot with a cost of $229,000. Reception On July 1, 1933, The New York Times review praised the film, saying: “The Warner Brothers, who made \\"I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang,\\" have very nearly produced its equal in \\"The Mayor of Hell,\\"...[they] have uncovered a stimulating subject in the dark hard places of a boys' reform school. If James Cagney's affection for Madge Evans is a definite encumbrance in the film, the impact of its mounting bitterness and resentment against the penal system at the reform school is not to be denied. The wild fury of the boys in the closing scenes becomes contagious. There only can be tears to meet that touching scene in which Johnny, the little consumptive, dies on his cot while the other lads stand silently around him....The story is badly balanced because of an obtrusive gangster element and it bulges here and there to make room for Madge Evans... But the power, the vigor, the surge and flow of real issues and important psychological problems make ‘The Mayor of Hell’ an interesting and stimulating drama almost in spite of itself. Dudley Digges gives a superb portrait of a sniveling, knee-bending, wantonly domineering office holder as the warden. Arthur Byron is wise and troubled as the judge of the children's court. Mr. Cagney fills the part of the reformed ward heeler with the gusto and swagger one expects of him. As the leader of the boy inmates, Frankie Darrow gives a hard-faced performance that is genuinely disturbing. He is a boy prematurely bitter and cynical, prematurely grown out of the ways of boyhood. An excellent diversity of types has been collected for the school's population, and the lads provide many anonymously touching moments.” Reviews David Cornelius of DVD Talk wrote: \\"To its credit, the film pushes to make several of its minority characters complex and intelligent, but still, an ugly stereotype is an ugly stereotype...\\" He believed that Cagney's performance and many of the others were \\"quite strong\\". TimeOut wrote: \\"Cloud nine tosh from the days when Warner movies preached that delinquents were just good kids in need of a helping hand\\", but concluded that \\"Despite the risible script, Cagney is as watchable as ever, and Mayo directs sleekly.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1933 films Category:1933 crime drama films Category:American films Category:American crime drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English- language films Category:Films directed by Archie Mayo Category:Films directed by Michael Curtiz Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:Warner Bros. films ","title":"The Mayor of Hell"},{"id":"3815123","text":"Hear Me Now is a compilation album by the Scottish singer/songwriter Donovan.

Biography He was born in Nouméa, New Caledonia on 10 August 1901, the son of a French baker. He came to Australia in 1919 and took a clerical position with a commercial house doing translations during the day and spending the evenings taking classes at the Julian Ashton Art School. In the early 1920s following the sale of one of his drawings to a Sydney newspaper he quit his job to make a living from drawing. Constrained by his limited command of English and unable to sell further drawings Mercier took a variety of jobs, including office boy, working on coastal ships, a spruiker at the Royal Easter Show, acting in stage melodramas. From the 1920s to 1940 he worked as a freelance artist selling cartoons and illustrations to Melbourne Punch, Smith's Weekly, The Bulletin and other smaller publications. In 1940 he obtained regular freelance work with Truth and The Daily Mirror. He created two comic strips for Truth, News Splashes and Week Spots. In 1941 Pen Pushers commenced in the ABC Weekly and soon after he linked up with Frank Johnson Publications. In 1949 Mercier was employed as a cartoonist on a full-time basis with Sydney's The Sun newspaper, a position he held until his retirement in 1968. Mercier's work was aimed squarely at the lower-middle class Australian reader. His daily single-panel newspaper cartoons were often topical, and mildly satirical. His humour took a neutral stance in politics, preferring to poke fun at politicians in general, rather than any recognisable figure. Generally, Mercier encouraged his readers to laugh at the vicissitudes of daily life. Some of his regular targets included drunks and tramps, fads and fashions in dress or house design, horse- racing, golf, food prices and motoring, all of interest to 1950s Australians. Mercier enjoyed including strange words in his cartoons, like 'ETAOIN' and 'SHRDLU'; nonsense words formed by the first two rows of keys on the old Linotype machines; words which sometimes – to Mercier's amusement – were accidentally included in real-life newspaper articles. 'CMFYP', the third line of keys on the keyboard, was sometimes used by Mercier as the name of a fictitious politician; the Honorable C. M. FWYP. Mercier also found the word 'GRAVY' humorous and included it a variety of contexts, including a trio of racehorses who were named 'GRAVY BONES', 'GREY SHRDLU' and 'CURLAMO' on signs above their stalls. Other Mercier's whims were depicting buildings, footpaths on floors supported by bed-springs, eccentric three-wheeled automobiles, yaks, and portraits of 'Uncle Ezra' on the walls of rooms. There was also a cast of frequently recurring secondary characters who starred in background gags of their own, including a bearded old gentleman (occasionally referred to as \\"Argylle\\"), who wore pince-nez glasses, a striped blazer and either a deerstalker hat or a straw boater – and who sometimes appeared carrying a euphonium, driving one of the above-mentioned three-wheeled cars, or, more often, on stilts; and a seedy old drunk in a battered brass fireman's helmet. Mercier even occasionally appeared as himself in his own cartoons, usually in a self-deprecating role. Mercier also had a naughty 'Gallic' sense of humour, and would often include double meanings in his jokes. His cartoon 'My wife's swallowed a bishop!' shows a woman who appears to have accidentally ingested a chess-piece, but the allusion is to fellatio.Partridge, Eric. Dictionary of Historical Slang. Penguin, 1972. In another, a crow is showing another crow several golf-balls among the eggs in her nest, complaining that '... my husband has a detestable habit of leaving his balls lying all over the place!' (I'm Waiting For an Earthquake, p. 52) While on the staff of Smith's Weekly, Mercier contributed a cartoon which included a cat in the foreground. Mercier added a cross under the cat's tail, representing its anus. The Smith's Weekly art editor rejected the cartoon and gave Mercier an angry lecture about including 'smutty gimmicks' in his work. Mercier then drew a down-drawn holland blind under the cat's tail, which hid the cat's anus but emphasised its presence, and re-submitted the cartoon. Mercier retired from The Sun in 1968 and died on 17 March 1981 in Sydney from Parkinson's disease. Cartoon comic-book characters invented by Mercier include: * Tripalong Hoppity (a parody of Hopalong Cassidy); * Wocko the Beaut; * Supa Dupa Man (a parody of Superman); * Mudrake the Magician (a parody of Mandrake the Magician); * Speed Umplestoop (a parody of Flash Gordon); * Three Gun Ferdie (a cowboy who carries an extra gun in his chest....); * Yes, What? (a popular radio comedy show of the 1940s); * Doc McSwiggle. Emile Mercier's works make up part of the storyline of Australian pop fiction author, Robert G Barrett's book, Les Norton and the Case of the Talking Pie Crust. Mercier illustrated the Mark Vizzers novel She'll do Me!She'll do Me! Jacaranda Press, Brisbane, 1960, as well as several collections of yarns by Australian folklorist Keith Garvey.

They follow the life of Henry Smart from Ireland to America spanning most of the 20th century. The series is narrated by Henry as well, providing us the \\"Omniscient Narrator.\\" Three books have now been published: A Star Called Henry (1999); Oh, Play That Thing! (2004); and The Dead Republic (2010). Volume I: A Star Called Henry (1999) Henry S. Smart, born in Dublin, 1901, becomes a character of epic proportions from the moment of his birth. His one-legged father, known by the name of Henry Smart as well, vanishes without a trace, forcing Henry to abandon his mother, Melody Smart, and takes to the streets of Dublin with his younger brother Victor, where they are forced to survive by any means possible. Henry is five years old, and Victor two years younger. By age fourteen, Henry has survived long enough to take part in the Easter Rising, becoming well known for his guerrilla combat skills, and even famous in his escape from execution. Months after the Rising of 1916, working (under an alias) in the shipyards of Dublin, Henry learns about how his amazing escape has made him a modern legend in the pubs of Dublin, by former Easter Rising member, Jack Dalton. Henry, on hearing this news, takes part in the Rebellion once again, and soon discovers how much of his (and his father's) past will come back to haunt him. Key Plot Points: *Henry's father was murdered by Alfie Gandon, even after Mr. Smart served him loyally for many years *Henry & Victor live off the streets at an early age. Although Henry survives, Victor does not. *Henry takes part in the Easter Rising, as well as the War of Independence. *Henry's duties for the IRA have a heavy price: Smart's own head. *Henry marries, and a daughter is born. However, life on the run forces him to leave his family behind. *Henry is constantly on the search for any information about his parents, especially the eventual fate of his father. *Aliases: **Henry Smart **Fergus Nash **Michael Collins **Brian O'Linn Volume II: Oh, Play That Thing! (2004) In the second novel, Henry is forced to flee Ireland due to the final events that take place in A Star Called Henry. He travels to Liverpool, the English town with a large Irish influence, and eventually makes his way to America. By March 16, 1924, Henry reaches Ellis Island, and sets up a new life in America. However, Henry remains haunted by his past. Over the course of the novel, Henry is forced to flee from New York City all the way to Chicago. There, he meets a young man playing the trumpet by the name of Louis Armstrong. Because segregation is all too alive in the city, Armstrong needs a man - a white man - to become his personal guard. Henry's fighting days may not be over . . . Key Plot Points: *Henry remains hunted by the IRA, even as he escapes into England, and even America. *Once in New York, Henry takes up bootlegging as well as sandwich board advertising. *In Chicago, Henry meets Louis Armstrong, as well as Henry's long lost family. *Henry & Louis make their way back to New York, and eventually work with \\"Olaf's Half-Sister\\" *Henry is finally caught by those who've always kept an eye out for him, the surviving IRA. *Henry and family journey into the western Dustbowl, just at the Great Depression begins. *Henry loses his family (and his leg) after failing to catch a freight train, and searches for them throughout the 1930s and 1940s, following the rumors and campfire tales left in their wake. *Aliases: **Henry Glick (homonymous with glic, Gaelic for cunning, clever, smart) **Henry Dalton (a reference to the deceased Jack Dalton of the IRA) **Henry S. (actually Henry S. Smart, his full name, but merely known as this in Chicago) **Henry O'Glick (On the run in the West, during the Great Depression) **One Leg O'Glick (On his own during his stay in the many Hoovervilles he lived in) Volume III: The Dead Republic (2010) In the final volume, an ageing Henry Smart attempts to cement his reputation. John Ford plans a movie based on Henry's life, but Henry eventually realizes the film that Ford has planned will reduce his story to sentiment. Henry plans to kill Ford, but his callousness has faded, and he drifts into the Dublin suburbs, where he meets a respectable widow who may possibly be his long-disappeared wife. Henry ages in obscurity until the 1970s, when the Provisional IRA uses a distorted version of Henry's story as a public relations ploy. Historical appearances Many characters in The Last Roundup are, in fact, historical. Here is a brief list of them: *James Connolly *Countess Markievicz *Michael Collins *Éamon de Valera *Louis Armstrong *Dutch Schultz *Owney Madden *Louis Lepke *John Ford *Henry Fonda Also, many events that Henry walks through are historical as well.

He is a full member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Life Bećković was born in Senta, in the multiethnic province of Vojvodina (then Danube Banate, Kingdom of Yugoslavia), to a military family of Montenegrin Serbs. He graduated from the Valjevo Gymnasium in Valjevo in 1958. It was during his gymnasium years in Valjevo that he published his first poem, in the journal 'Mlada Kultura'. Furthermore, it was also in Valjevo that Bećković met Vera Pavladoljska, to whom the poem of the same name, published in 1960, was dedicated. Bećković went on to marry Pavladoljska, and he remained married to her until her death. Upon graduating from the Valjevo gymnasium, he entered the University of Belgrade, graduating with a degree in Yugoslav and world literature. He became a corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1983, becoming a full member in 1991. Bećković is a close friend of Serbian former Prime Minister Vojislav Koštunica, and an active supporter of his Democratic Party of Serbia. He has been living in Belgrade since 1960. On the Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006, Bećković did not have a right to vote since he lives in Serbia. However, as a prominent Serb nationalist he fiercely advocated against Montenegrin independence, actively supporting the State Union during the pre-referendum campaign. Poetic style A distinguishing feature of Bećković's poetry is its regionalism. Distinctly Serbian archaic dialect and phraseology permeate his work. This aspect of his work is most often lost when one reads it in translation.

He also used the pseudonyms Charles Calhoun and Chuck Calhoun. His best-known composition as Calhoun was \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\". Ahmet Ertegun once stated that \\"Jesse Stone did more to develop the basic rock 'n' roll sound than anybody else.\\" Early life Stone was born in Atchison, Kansas, United States, and raised in Kansas. His grandparents were former slaves from Tennessee. Stone was influenced by a wide array of styles. He came from a musical family who put on minstrel shows, and performed with them by age of five. He was part of a trained dog act at the age of four. Career By 1926, Stone had formed a group, the Blue Serenaders, and cut his first record, \\"Starvation Blues\\", for Okeh Records in 1927. For the next few years he worked as a pianist and arranger in Kansas City, recording with Julia Lee among others, and then in the 1930s organised a larger orchestra. New York in the 1930s and 1940s Duke Ellington got Stone's orchestra booked at the Cotton Club in 1936, and Ellington put Stone up free of charge in his apartment for four months. Over the next few years Stone worked as a bandleader at the Apollo Theatre, and more widely in Harlem as a songwriter and arranger, with Chick Webb's band (which included Louis Jordan), Jimmie Lunceford, and many others. He made some recordings under his own name in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1941, Stone became musical director for the all-female jazz band, the International Sweethearts of Rhythm. He left after two years. Stone was interviewed in the 1986 documentary film International Sweethearts of Rhythm about his time with that band. Stone's early writings show a deep blues influence. An early success was \\"Idaho\\", recorded by several artists, with the Benny Goodman version peaking at number 4 (pop) in 1942. The recording by Guy Lombardo sold three million copies. Jimmy Dorsey recorded his composition \\"Sorghum Switch\\", later retitled \\"Cole Slaw\\" by Louis Jordan. Stone also recorded novelty blues records for RCA Records, and wrote the standard \\"Smack Dab in the Middle\\". Atlantic Records In 1945, with his friend Herb Abramson, he went to work for Al Green at National Records, and two years later the pair joined the staff at Atlantic Records. At the time, Stone was the only black person on the Atlantic payroll. Stone worked for Atlantic as a producer, songwriter, and arranger. During a trip to the South in 1949 with Ahmet Ertegun and Herb Abramson, Stone discovered that Atlantic's records were not selling in the southern states because they lacked a certain danceable quality. Stone later said: \\"I listened to the stuff that was being done by those thrown-together bands in the joints down there, and I concluded that the only thing that was missing from the stuff we were recording was the rhythm. All we needed was a bass line. So I designed a bass pattern, and it sort of became identified with rock'n'roll - doo, da-DOO, DUM; doo, da-DOO, DUM - that thing. I'm the guilty person that started that.\\" In 1953 he wrote Ray Charles' hit \\"Losing Hand\\" (1953), and also wrote \\"Money Honey\\", which became the first hit record for The Drifters, topping the national R&B; chart for 11 weeks. The following year, he arranged \\"Sh-Boom\\" by The Chords. As Charles Calhoun On Ertegun's advice, Stone used the pseudonym of Charles E. Calhoun, a name appropriated from an unknowing local builder, on his BMI tunes to avoid conflict with his membership in the other music licensing society, ASCAP. His best-known composition as Calhoun was \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\". The song was first recorded by Big Joe Turner in 1954 for Atlantic and was a major hit for the rhythm and blues artist, often cited as one of the first rock and roll records. An even bigger success was a cover version of the song recorded later in 1954 for Decca Records by Bill Haley & His Comets. This version became one of the first rock and roll recordings to sell a million copies and be an international success. It predated Haley's better-known \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" by nearly a year. Stone also co-wrote \\"Flip, Flop and Fly\\" with Big Joe Turner, which was another hit. Haley was also fond of the song, and recorded it three times during his career. Stone also had additional Haley connections. Haley's hit, 1955's \\"Razzle-Dazzle\\", was another written by Stone under the Calhoun pseudonym. Stone was also credited as co-writer (along with James E. Myers aka Jimmy DeKnight, co-writer of \\"Rock Around the Clock\\") of \\"Rattle My Bones\\", a song recorded in 1956 by the Comets spin-off group, The Jodimars. As a bandleader, Stone recorded several singles in the late 1940s and mid 1950s, on RCA Victor, Atlantic and other labels, either under his own name or as \\"Chuck\\", \\"Charles\\" or \\"Charlie\\" Calhoun. Later career In 1960, he served as arranger and orchestra director for a session for LaVern Baker which produced four songs including the hit \\"Bumble Bee\\". In 1961, after a brief and temporary retirement, Stone was recruited to run Randy Records in Chicago. However, he left after a few years. Honors and awards Stone was honored by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1992 with a Pioneer Award. He was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame in 1992. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. Personal life After leaving Randy Records, Stone relocated to New York and then Florida. In 1975, he married Evelyn McGee (1922-1996), formerly of the International Sweethearts of Rhythm. Stone died \\"after a long illness\\" at age 97 in Altamonte Springs, Florida.

As such the GB abbreviation stand for Gasbremse (gas brake). It was designed in 1968, intended as a replacement for older handguns in Austrian military service. The weapon went into general civilian production in 1982, and in 1988 production ceased. In the late 1970s, an American company founded by Les Rogak, LES Incorporated of Morton Grove, Illinois marketed the Rogak P-18, a close derivative of the Austrian original, but without great commercial success, Originally published in: due to significantly lower manufacturing standards which affected both the appearance and function of the pistol.Rogak P18: A Cautionary Tale of Manufacturing at Forgotten Weapons Both weapons are now regarded as collector's items, the original (Steyr) model commanding higher prices in the American market. Operating mechanism The Steyr GB is a semi- automatic, blowback-operated firearm. It features a unique gas-delayed blowback system based on the Barnitzke system, first used in the Volkssturmgewehr 1-5, and subsequently in the Swiss Pistole 47 W+F (Waffenfabrik Bern) prototype pistol. The Barnitzke system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge and feeds it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to retard the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by using the fixed piston formed by the outside of the barrel, inside a moving cylinder formed by the inside of the slide, gas pressure in the space between them opposing the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined (at which point the bullet has left the muzzle) thereby allowing the slide to continue its rearward motion. Thereafter the Steyr GB follows the conventional semi-automatic cycle: opening the breech; ejecting the empty cartridge case; stripping a new round from the magazine; loading a new cartridge; returning to battery (unless the magazine is empty).  Development History of GB  Steyr Pi 18, produced in limited capacity to be tested by potential customers. The design would be tweaked before released in 1981 as Steyr GB. At the end of the 1960s, Steyr-Daimler-Puch in Austria started re-examining the Barnitzke locking system and started a follow-up development. This led directly to the development of what would eventually become Steyr GB. The final patent specification from December 6, 1972 by the Steyr designer Hannes Kepplinger is based on the Barnitzke system, although this was significantly improved in terms of design.Günter Wollert, Reiner Lidschun, Wilfried Kopenhagen: Schützenwaffen. (1945–1985). In: Illustrierte Enzyklopädie der Schützenwaffen aus aller Welt. 5. Auflage. Band 1+2. Brandenburgisches Verlagshaus, Berlin 1988, , Waffen, S. 334, 335. The GB was designed as a full-size military sidearm with the goal of replacing the ageing Walther P38 and Colt P11 from the army stocks, as well as the Belgian FN M35 used by Austrian police. Even though there were no base specifications for the pistol, Steyr-Daimler-Puch - because of their relationship with Austrian armed forces - were well-informed of the properties that the army expected from a new service pistol. Thus, the company considered the pistol project as an “unofficial” development contract for the Austrian Armed Forces. Günter Wollert, Reiner Lidschun, Wilfried Kopenhagen: Schützenwaffen.

The original design introduced numerous novel features never before combined in a handgun: double-action mechanism (without safety); a gas-bleed delayed- blowback system; fixed barrel (that theoretically yields greater accuracy); polygonal rifling; and a reduced number of working parts. During the development phase, the pistol was given the working designation \\"Pi 18\\", meant to refer to the magazine capacity of 18 rounds, which was above average for a handgun in the 1970s. When reintroduced in the 1980s, the name of the pistol was changed to the abbreviation \\"GB\\", from the term \\"GasBremse.“ Günter Wollert, Reiner Lidschun, Wilfried Kopenhagen: Schützenwaffen. (1945–1985). In: Illustrierte Enzyklopädie der Schützenwaffen aus aller Welt. 5. Auflage. Band 1+2. Brandenburgisches Verlagshaus, Berlin 1988, , Waffen, S. 334, 335. The first working models were fielded by the Austrian armed forces in 1972. Although the military authorities were supportive of the pistol, the business negotiations fell short. The reason for this is due to Steyr simultaneously trying to market the MPi 69 submachine gun to the Austrian army, while also pushing the army to buy the stocks of Pi 18 alongside them. Steyr-Daimler-Puch and Austrian army failed to reach an agreement and neither MPi 69 nor Pi 18 was purchased by Austrian Army. This left both weapons in flux and discouraged Steyr from releasing the Pi 18 for the civilian market. Günter Wollert, Reiner Lidschun, Wilfried Kopenhagen: Schützenwaffen. (1945–1985). In: Illustrierte Enzyklopädie der Schützenwaffen aus aller Welt. 5. Auflage. Band 1+2. Brandenburgisches Verlagshaus, Berlin 1988, , Waffen, S. 334, 335. The pistol received a handful of modifications before being reintroduced in 1981. Its trigger guard was altered to more jagged look, with redesigned controls such as safety and slide release, as well as a Sterling-style crinkle-finish on the pistol frame. Reasons for this is both, to make the pistol more contemporary for the 1980s markets and to differentiate it from Rogak P18, which closely followed the appearance of the original Pi 18. In certain markets, the pistol is also referred to as \\"GB-80\\".Günter Wollert, Reiner Lidschun, Wilfried Kopenhagen: Schützenwaffen. (1945–1985). In: Illustrierte Enzyklopädie der Schützenwaffen aus aller Welt. 5. Auflage. Band 1+2. Brandenburgisches Verlagshaus, Berlin 1988, , Waffen, S. 334, 335.  Plagiarism, ROGAK/L.E.S. P-18  In the mid-1970s, Steyr's then US representative Rogak, acquired the production documents for \\"Pi-18\\" the pre-series/prototype of the Steyr GB from an unidentified Steyr manager. How this was precisely achieved still remains undetermined. There was never an official licensing or related agreement for production between Rogak and Steyr. When inquired about the matter by a trade journal in 1980, Steyr-Daimler-Puch (quote) \\"at no time were there any official agreements between Steyr and Rogak ...\\". Rogak started production of the pistol in the USA around late 1970s under the name of his \\"L.E.S. Rogak P-18“ and started to market it worldwide through its own sales companies. Owing to the performance data of the Austrian \\"Pi 18\\", Rogak saw very high market opportunities, which he intended to exploit as quickly as possible. Rogak produced three “cosmetically” slightly different versions made of stainless steel. Rogak was either overwhelmed and/or unwilling to adequately follow the correct dimensions and/or get the required materials to make a product comparable to the original Austrian \\"Pi 18\\". As a result, these “Quick-and-Dirty P-18s” were manufactured in a way that was structurally inadequate in essential details. The general quality of workmanship can only be described as extremely poor compared to Steyr's own GB produced in the 1980s. After releasing to strongly negative reception, Steyr came to realize that Rogak P-18 would harm their GB, which they were eyeing to launch in the American market. Steyr prepared a lawsuit against Rogak, but it did not occur, as Rogak ceased production of the pistol on its own volition. Roughly 2300 pistols were sold before production ceased in 1981.Günter Wollert, Reiner Lidschun, Wilfried Kopenhagen: Schützenwaffen. (1945–1985). In: Illustrierte Enzyklopädie der Schützenwaffen aus aller Welt. 5. Auflage. Band 1+2. Brandenburgisches Verlagshaus, Berlin 1988, , Waffen, S. 334, 335.  Reception and Legacy = Rogak P-18  At the time of its release, the Rogak P-18 was received highly negatively by both; the reviewers of American Firearms Magazines and customers. Its substandard build and awful reliability earned it unflattering nicknames like \\"Jammatic\\" or \\"polished junk\\" by the American public. It was as one of the earliest \\"Wonder-nine\\" type of pistols in the civilian market. However, Rogak's innovation factor has been undermined because of its plagiarism of Steyr Pi-18/GB. Rogak P-18 would develop reputation as one of worst semi-automatic pistols of all time. However, it remains a curiosity amongst firearm collectors.  Steyr GB, Military Contracts  Steyr GB was unsuccessful in acquiring major military contracts. Steyr's expectations of an Austrian military contract were upset with the victory of the Glock 17, which won military trials despite the novelty of its extensive employment of large high-strength polymer components, while the 1983 US military pistol competition, in which the Steyr GB competed, was won by the Beretta 92F. Consequently, Steyr decided to re-focus on the police and civilian market. In the years that followed, Steyr received smaller international orders for military, paramilitary and police special forces, including the special outfits in the USA, Lebanon and Pakistan. Well-known secret services were also interested in the GB, including the Ministry for State Security of the DDR, which procured around 100 pieces from the USA. The West German Federal Office for Defense Technology and Procurement (predecessor of Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In- Service Support) also bought 10 pieces. However, none of these smaller contracts were able to compensate for the loss of failing to procure the Austrian and US military contracts.Günter Wollert, Reiner Lidschun, Wilfried Kopenhagen: Schützenwaffen.

Steyr GB, Legacy  While much appreciated by users trained and familiar with the weapon, and well received by customers who understood the mechanism, which was intended to result in a robust, accurate, reliable, and functional weapon when used with standard military (full metal jacket) ammunition, the anticipated civilian sales remained low while major official (police) sales never materialized: between the American military's selection of the Beretta 92F, coupled with European military and police forces' selection of the competing SIG-Sauer (P226 full-size and P228 compact high-capacity pistols—the latter adopted by the US Army as the M11) led to a cessation of manufacture of the Steyr GB in November 25, 1988 after a total production of between 15,000 and 20,000 pistols—most of them commercial models. In the firearms book Schützenwaffen, its collaborative writers arrive to the following conclusion about Steyr GB: > The case of \\"Steyr GB\\" shows that it is not just the performance that > determines the success of a weapon. Time of launch, negative as well as > positive side effects, political and economic context as well as > inadequacies in marketing are more likely to determine whether a weapon is > successful on the market or not.Günter Wollert, Reiner Lidschun, Wilfried > Kopenhagen: Schützenwaffen.

Prior to his activism Goff had a long career in the U.S. armed forces, serving in the United States Army from 1970 to 1996 with two breaks in service. After retiring from the military he became a political activist, adopting anti-imperialist, feminist, and socialist/Marxist views, and is now a Christian. He is an active blogger and is the author of several books, including Hideous Dream (2000), Full-Spectrum Disorder: The Military in the New American Century (2004), Energy War (2006), Sex & War (2006), Borderline - Reflections on War, Sex, and Church (2015), \\"Mammon's Ecology - Metaphysic of the Empty Sign\\" (2018), and \\"Tough Gynes - Violent Women in Film as Honorary Men\\" (2019). He has also been a contributor to CounterPunch and Huffington Post.Huffington Post Bio Military career Goff was sent to Vietnam in 1970-71 during the Vietnam war. He served with the 173rd Airborne Brigade as an infantryman, after which he was reassigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina following a bout with drug-resistant malaria. In 1973, he was honorably discharged with the rank of sergeant. During a break in service, he attended college at the University of Arkansas in Monticello and married Elizabeth Mackall. Their daughter, Elan Mackall Goff, was born September 1, 1976. In 1977, he enlisted again in the Army and was assigned to the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) as a Private First Class, re-earning his sergeant's stripes in 1979. That same year, he joined the 75th Ranger Regiment, and after graduation from indoc, was reassigned to the 2nd Ranger Battalion on Fort Lewis, Washington. After two years with the 2nd Ranger Battalion, Goff earned the rank of Staff Sergeant, and reenlisted on condition of reassignment to the Jungle Operations Training Center in Panama working as a small unit tactics instructor. He volunteered for the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (SFOD-D) during that assignment. After unit selection and training, Goff participated in operations in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Grenada (see Operation Urgent Fury). In December, 1986, Goff was relieved from Delta with the rank of Sergeant First Class, based on an accusation that he denies related to having taken a woman into the Ambassador to El Salvador's residence for sex. He admits, however, that during the time of the alleged encounter, he was walking around the block with a local prostitute to smoke marijuana with her. He was reassigned to the staff and faculty at the United States Military Academy at West Point. He served as the NCOIC of the Service Orientation Course, and developed the Ranger Orientation Program that selected cadets to attend Ranger School during their Junior-Senior summer. He permitted his enlistment to expire in 1987 - working for a time training SWAT teams for the Department of Energy Y-12 nuclear weapon facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. He rejoined the US Army in 1988, as a Staff Sergeant, and was assigned to the 1st Ranger Battalion. Goff then volunteered for Special Forces training in 1989, and became a Special Operations Medical Sergeant assigned to the 7th Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg. While with 7th Group, he performed training and operational missions in Central and South America. Many of these missions were presented officially to the public as \\"counter-narcotics\\" operations supporting the War on Drugs. Goff later wrote that this dissonance was formative in his political shift to the left. In 1990, he was divorced from Elizabeth Mackall. He was remarried in 1992 to Sherry Long in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He has three step- children from the marriage: Jessie Hobbs, Jayme Hobbs and Jeremy Hobbs. Goff was reassigned to the 75th Ranger Regiment as a Special Operations Medical Sergeant in 1993, and was attached to 3rd Ranger Battalion as part of Task Force Ranger for the operation in Mogadishu, Somalia. Goff was redeployed to Fort Benning before the infamous Bakara firefight after a dispute with a Ranger captain that verged upon violence. Not long after, he was promoted to Master Sergeant, effectively changing his job description from Special Forces Medic to SF Operations Sergeant. Goff was then reassigned back to Fort Bragg, to the 3rd Special Forces Group, where he was given the task of running a Special Forces team, called an A-Detachment (in this case, Operational Detachment - A (ODA) 354, a military free-fall parachute specialty team). The story of his time with this team, up to and including his retirement from the Army in February 1996 (with special emphasis on Operation Restore Democracy in Haiti in 1994) is recounted in detail in his first book, Hideous Dream - A Soldier's Memoir of the US Invasion of Haiti (Soft Skull Press, 2000). Activism Goff became politically active almost immediately after his military career ended, and quickly took up the study of Marxism. He joined the Communist Party USA for a brief period, but left the party in response to what he describes as the demand for \\"ideological conformity,\\" and his belief that the party was hostile to feminism. This is a criticism he levels frequently at the entire left, which he describes as \\"male-dominated, and tokenizing of women.\\". In 1996, Goff secured a job as organizing director for Democracy South, a non-profit organization which did research and advocacy on money-and- politics in the South, and stayed there for the next five and a half years. In 2001, he did a short stint as the military technical adviser for the Arnold Schwarzenegger action film Collateral Damage, which he describes as one of the most miserable jobs in his life, and for which he publicly apologized after the film was altered, in the wake of 9-11, into what Goff called \\"yet another male revenge fantasy\\". Throughout this post-military period, he remained in touch with Haitian political issues, and developed a close working relationship with Katharine Kean, a film maker who has worked in Haiti for decades, and the political cadres of the National Popular Party, a left party in Haiti with a peasant popular base. He returned to Haiti dozens of times since then, and has written extensively on the political developments there. After the September 11 attacks and the resulting push for war, Goff was in demand as a public speaker. His military career and his opposition to the coming war gave him a degree of immunity from many criticisms made against anti-war advocates. He also became involved with the Freedom Road Socialist Organization around the same time, drawn primarily by the organization's analysis of Black nationalism, and the organization's stated goal of the \\"refoundation\\" of the American Left. In the process of writing a column called \\"Military Matters\\" for the organization, he began his second book, Full Spectrum Disorder - The Military in the New American Century, (Soft Skull Press, 2004). Activism against the Iraq War In 2003, after President George W. Bush (whom Goff referred to as a \\"de facto\\" president) remarked \\"Bring 'em on\\" during an interview, Goff wrote a response for the on-line journal CounterPunch, called \\"Bring 'em on?\\". He received thousands of emails in response to the CounterPunch article, many of them from veterans and military families. He contacted Dennis O'Neil, a colleague in New York, and told him about the supportive reaction from vets and military families. They then contacted Dave Cline, the president of Veterans For Peace, along with Nancy Lessin and Charlie Anderson of the nascent group Military Families Speak Out, and within a week a campaign had been inaugurated called \\"Bring Them Home Now!\\". He has also worked as an organizational development consultant with Iraq Veterans Against the War. Goff is referred to in Mary Tillman’s Book, Boots on the Ground by dusk” as being a major influence and assistance in getting to the truth behind the death of NFL player, turned Soldier, Pat Tillman After the publication of Full Spectrum Disorder, Goff became interested in the connections between militarism and the social construction of masculinity. He studied feminist writings and theory over the next two years in the process of writing his third book, Sex & War (Lulu Press, 2006).Americans Who Tell The Truth In March 2006 Goff helped to organize the Veterans and Survivors March of the Iraq Veterans Against the War, Veterans For Peace, Military Families Speak Out, and Gold Star Families for Peace to call attention to the cost of the war in Iraq and its impact on relief efforts along the Gulf coast after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. After the Veterans and Survivors March, Goff pulled back from public engagement and worked as a landscape helper, an apprentice stonemason, and a home deconstruction crew with Wake County (NC) Habitat for Humanity. He took up a study of the historical Jesus in 2006, and from that study gained an interest in theology. In 2008, he was baptized and is a professed Christian and pacifist, eschewing political labels like socialist or anarchist. In 2009, he wrote a tract entitled \\"Why I won't call myself progressive\\", that reflected the influences of Christian writers John Howard Yoder, Stanley Hauerwas, Amy Laura Hall, and Ivan Illich. He is an advocate of non-coercive, community re-localization efforts and what he calls \\"food praxis,\\" or practical activities that promote food sovereignty. Goff resided with his wife, Sherry, for a year - 2009-2010 - in Grecia, Costa Rica; and now lives in Michigan. He worked with the Adrian Dominican Sisters on a long term permaculture land use project until 2017, and now devotes full time to writing. Books by Goff * (2000) Hideous Dream.

Biography Born in Mikata District Fukui prefecture (present-day city of Wakasa, Fukui), to the family of a Shinto priest, Sakuma graduated from the 29th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1901. One of his classmates was the future Navy Minister and Prime Minister of Japan Mitsumasa Yonai. He was assigned to the cruiser shortly before the start of the Russo-Japanese War. He subsequently served with the 15th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, and was on board the cruiser during the Battle of Tsushima on May 26, 1905. After completing the torpedo warfare school, Sakuma served on the submarine tender and was later a squad leader on the . He started to get involved in the submarine service in 1906, first taking the command of the No.4 submarine, and eventually the Japan-built Holland-type No.6 in 1908. On April 15, 1910, while engaged in a practice dive in the Inland Sea off of the coast of Yamaguchi Prefecture, the submarine suffered a malfunction resulting in the loss of the ship and crew. Two days later the submarine was recovered by Japanese authorities, and Sakuma's journal was found, with a detailed analysis of what may have caused the accident, ending with an apology to Emperor Meiji for the loss of the submarine and 14 crew members before the ship's air ran out. The journal was posted in later press reports, and Sakuma became a posthumous national hero and an example for courage and steadfastness within the Imperial Japanese Navy.

Some of his most significant peer-reviewed contributions were coauthored with Motoo Kimura, including those leading to the neutral theory of molecular evolution. He also wrote an influential introductory textbook on genetics and a more advanced one with Kimura. His graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs includes Alexey Kondrashov, James Bull, Joe Felsenstein, Russell Lande, Dan Hartl, and Wen-Hsiung Li. He was a president of both the Genetics Society of America and the American Society of Human Genetics. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, The American Philosophical Society, the World Academy of Art and Science, the National Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS). Biography=Early life and education Crow was born in 1916 in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, where his father was a teacher at Ursinus College. The family moved to Wichita, Kansas, two and a half years later, in 1918, where Crow was part of the 1918 flu pandemic. He went to school in Wichita, then to Friends University, at the time a Quaker school, also in Wichita, graduating in 1937. At school, he enjoyed physics and chemistry, but pursued chemistry more strongly at university. He picked up biology as well, and double majored in chemistry and biology. A genetics course in his junior year was his first exposure to that field, even though the syllabus omitted the modern synthesis. Delaying the decision of whether to become a biologist or chemist, Crow applied for graduate fellowships in both biology and biochemistry. He took up the first positive reply, a position with H. J. Muller at the University of Texas at Austin, in spite of knowing that Muller was in Russia at the time. It turned out that Muller had no intention of returning to his position in Texas, and so J. T. Patterson became Crow's supervisor there. Under the influence of Muller, Patterson was starting to switch to Drosophila genetics, having previously worked on the embryology of the armadillo, and so it was that Crow came to study the genetic isolating mechanisms in the Drosophila mulleri group. This included a combination of doing mating crosses between species and looking for chromosome rearrangements using polytene chromosomes. (Polytene chromosomes are large aggregations of actual chromosomes which, once appropriately stained, facilitate the discovery of chromosome rearrangements through an ordinary light microscope. Polytene chromosomes are mostly found in the salivary glands of some species.) In his studies of pre-mating isolation, Crow was one of the first to study genetic reinforcement, and also observed that species occurring together were sexually isolated, while those living apart were not. A great influence on Crow at the time was W.S. Stone, who encouraged him to learn more mathematics, while he himself knew none. Later on, Crow admitted to struggling with some of the advanced maths and physics courses he took as a result, but also said they had been rewarding. Dartmouth College and the war Crow graduated with his PhD in 1941 and moved to Dartmouth College just prior to the American entry into World War II, where he remained until 1948. The original plan had been to get a postdoctoral fellowship to work with Sewall Wright at the University of Chicago, but this proved difficult just at the start of the war. His appointment in Dartmouth was to teach genetics and general zoology, but as faculty were drafted off into military endeavors, Crow took on an increasing number of courses. Crow particularly delighted in being able to teach embryology and comparative anatomy. When it seemed likely that he himself would be drafted, Crow took a course in navigation, at which, owing to his mathematical training, he proved so adept that he was asked to teach it. As parasitology became relevant to the war (as it did on the opposing front, where Willi Hennig was active in this area), he was asked to also teach parasitology and haematology. Not long after, he was also teaching statistics. It may be that, having to teach many hours each day, Crow discovered his love for teaching at this point. He later recounted that there were several students all of whose courses were taught by him. He, like many of his colleagues of the era, had college-time involvement with pacifist groups that had communist leanings. During WWII, he tried to enlist, but was deferred until the end due to his teaching commitments. Race and IQ controversy Crow wrote \\"Genetic Theories and Influences: Comments on the Value of Diversity,\\" an article in the Harvard Educational Review reprinted in the review's reprint series responding to Arthur Jensen's 1969 article, \\"How Much Can We Boost IQ and Academic Achievement?\\" Paternal age effect on DNA Crow also did research and writing in how DNA in sperm degrades as men age, through repeated copying, and can then be passed along to children in permanently degraded form, which they likely then pass on as well. As a result, he said in 1997 that the \\"greatest mutational health hazard to the human genome is fertile older males\\". He described mutations that have a direct visible effect on the child's health and also mutations that can be latent or have minor visible effects on the child's health; many such mutations allow the child to reproduce, but cause more serious problems for grandchildren, great-grandchildren and later generations A 2009 review prematurely concluded that the absolute risk from paternal age for genetic anomalies in offspring was low, and stated that \\"there is no clear association between adverse health outcome and paternal age but longitudinal studies are needed.\\" However, newer studies supported Crow's claims. A study in 2006 of 132,000 Israeli adolescents discovered men in their 30s are 1.6 times as likely to have a child with autism as men under 30, with men in their 40s having a sixfold increase in risk Further studies in Sweden (2.6 million children), Denmark (2.98 million), and an international dataset of 5.7 million children showed a definite link between increased paternal age and autism risk. A widely-referenced Icelandic whole-genome sequencing effort led by Kári Stefánsson of DEcode Genetics and published in Nature also concluded similarly. Research Much of Crow’s research was in the area of theoretical population genetics, but he has often ventured into the laboratory. Over a career that spanned more than 50 years, Crow and his collaborators studied a variety of traits in Drosophila, dissected the genetics of DDT resistance, measured the effects of minor mutations on the overall fitness of populations, described the behavior of mutations that do not play the selection game by Darwin’s rules, and investigated many other subjects. His theoretical work has touched virtually every important subject in population genetics. Crow developed the concept of genetic load, has contributed to the theory of random drift in small populations, has studied the effects of non-random mating and age-structured populations, and has considered the question, “What good is sex?” He also developed ways to estimate inbreeding in human populations by making use of the way in which surnames are “inherited,” and was a world expert on the genetic effects of low level ionizing radiation. In addition to his many research publications, Crow published many reviews and appreciations of the work of his colleagues. His textbook/monograph on population genetics, written with Motoo Kimura, has had a notable impact on its field. Public service Crow chaired the Department of Medical Genetics for five years and the Laboratory of Genetics (Genetics plus Medical Genetics) for a total of eight years. He also served as Acting Dean of the UW Medical School for 2 years. He was President of the Genetics Society of America and the American Society of Human Genetics. He was the co-editor-in-chief of the journal GENETICS and edited its perspectives section from 1987 until 2008. Crow served at the national level as a member of the General Advisory Committee to the Director of NIH and of the executive council of the National Committee on Radiation Protection, chaired the NIH Genetics Study Section and the NIH Mammalian Genetics Study Section, and chaired several committees for the National Academy of Sciences including a committee to study forensic uses of DNA fingerprinting. In addition, Crow for many years played viola for the Madison Symphony Orchestra and served as President of the Madison Civic Music Society and of the Madison Symphony Orchestra. He led a fund-raising drive to establish an endowment for the Pro Arte String Quartet. Crow was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, The American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the World Academy of Art and Science. He was an honorary Fellow of the Japan Academy and a Fellow of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters.

Downloaded on 9 December 2014 Database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is listed as extinct. the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has not, and keeps it on the Endangered Species List. History The Maryland Darter was originally discovered in 1912 in Swan Creek, a tributary of the larger Susquehanna River drainage basin located near Havre de Grace, Maryland. The two biologists responsible for the discovery, Lewis Radcliffe and William W. Welsh, promptly published a description of the newly discovered species in an early scientific journal in 1913. Despite initial detection of the species in Swan Creek, it was never found there again. However, in 1962 the Maryland darter was \\"re-discovered\\" after an adult female specimen was collected in nearby Gasheys Run, a tributary of Swan Creek. Perhaps the most significant detection of the Maryland darter occurred in 1965, when over 70 individuals were collected from Deer Creek. Additional sightings of the species in Deer Creek occurred irregularly between 1974 and 1988, where between 1 and 10 individuals were detected by seining sampling or snorkeling. However, the last significant sighting of the Maryland darter occurred in 1988. It has not been seen since, and is believed to be extinct. This species is the only member of the subgenus Mooreichthys.Stephens, R.R., Johnson, K.A. & Grady, M.P. (2014): Phylogenetic Placement of the Extinct Etheostoma sellare and Other Darters with a Compilation of Morphological Character State Polarizations for Darters. Copeia, 2014 (3): 540-555 Characteristics The Maryland darter is a member of the Genus Etheostoma and a member of the Darter family of fishes. A relative of the Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) and Walleye (Sander vitreus), the Maryland darter is a bottom-dwelling fish. Ideal habitat consists of highly oxygenated, swiftly flowing portions of streaming containing moderate amounts of vegetation. characterized by rubble and gravel-like substrate. Additionally, the species favors sloped rock riffles and crevasses which provide ample shelter from predators. The Maryland darter is a relatively smaller darter species with a maximum size of just under three inches. The species favors small insects, frequently foraging on small snails, caddis fly larvae, mayfly larvae, and stonefly nymphs. Spawning presumably occurs in late April as is characteristic of most other darter species, however the Maryland darter has never been observed during reproduction. Species status The Maryland darter is listed as endangered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that due to difficulty of detection, in spite of infrequent observations since initial discovery in 1912, that is not sufficient evidence to declare the species extinct. However, other organizations such as the IUCN has listed the Maryland darter as extinct on the IUCN list of threatened species. The state of Maryland has the species listed as SH, indicating that, historically, the species occurred in the state but is believed to be extirpated, having not been observed for a period of over 20 years. Recovery efforts The Maryland Darter Recovery Plan is a plan implemented by the Wildlife and Heritage Service of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, devised in cooperation with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The intent of the plan is to implement widespread detection efforts using a variety of techniques. including electro-fishing equipment and electro trawls, in an effort to learn more about this rare species. The plan also recommends the protection of the Deer Creek watershed through the use of improved farming and forestry practices. In addition, strips of naturally vegetated lands are to be constructed adjacent to Deer Creek in an effort to insulate the watershed from harmful nearby agricultural runoff. The root systems and leaf cover established by these buffers would, in addition to preventing erosion, would help to absorb toxic chemicals and filter solid waste before it has a chance to enter the watershed.MDDNR Wildlife and Heritage Service \\"Maryland Darter\\". Retrieved 11 December 2014 Additionally, surveys have been conducted by the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) in 2001 through 2006. Six sites in Deer Creek were surveyed by MBSS as well as 22 additional sites in the greater Deer Creek watershed. One site in Gasheys Run, one site in the mainstem of Swan Creek, and four more sites within the greater Swan Creek Watershed were also sampled. Again, all of these surveys resulted in inconclusive evidence. Attempts to locate the Maryland darter remain largely unsuccessful.

It is situated immediately west of the town of Stonehaven in Kincardineshire, slightly to the west of the A90 dual carriageway. Other notable historic fortified houses or castles in this region are Dunnottar Castle, Muchalls Castle, Fiddes Castle, Cowie Castle and Monboddo House. Prehistory From cropmarks in the \\"policies\\" (improved areas) around Fetteresso Castle, there is evidence of a ring-ditch sited at the north end of a cursus. A cursus is a prehistoric set of parallel linear structures of unknown purpose that were, somewhat fancifully, considered by antiquarians as used for some type of athletic competition, possibly related to hunting or archery; this is unsubstantiated. In 1822 a cairn was discovered near Fetteresso Castle with some human remains inside. The size and shape of the chamber made of unhewn whinstone clearly show that the burial site was a Bronze Age construct. Some legends tell that this is the grave of Malcolm I, who is recorded to have been slain at Fetteresso in 954 AD. The burial hillock has become known as Malcolm's Mount, even though it is not likely from current archaeological analysis that the crypt could be so recent. In 1998 a burial urn from the Beaker people was found at Fetteresso Castle. The Roman Camp of Raedykes is located several miles northwest, where a full legion encamped and many archeological recoveries have been made. This location is one of a string of marching camps that connected Angus to Moray. Middle Ages The property is recorded to have been owned by the Strachans. Robert de Bruce opposed the Balliol (and later the Comyn) claim to the throne of Scotland, which culminated at the Battle of Barra Hill (1308). Castlehill of Strachan was in fact burned out by Robert de Bruce, and the Barony of Strachan later disinherited from the de Strachan family and granted by Robert de Bruce to Sir Alexander Fraser in c. 1316 (Robertson Index, 1-15). The Strachan family were supporters and kinsmen of John Comyn, Earl of Buchan. The barony of Fetteresso eventually passed to William Keith, the Earl Marischal of Scotland, who inherited the barony through his mother, the daughter of Sir Alexander Fraser in the 14th century to the Clan Keith Earls Marischal, who built the tower house. The Earls Marischal also held the nearby fortress, Dunnottar Castle. 17th and 18th centuries The characteristic Scottish designs of crow- stepped gables and the battlement crenellation elements were introduced. A dovecote of considerable height was constructed in the 17th century to the south of the castle. In 1659 Jean Hunter lived at Fetteresso. She was accused of witchcraft and hanged at her home. An artist and wright named Alexander Charles worked at Fetteresso as an overseer. Charles flourished in 1671 to 1678 and published his drawings in at least one book. Late in the 17th century, the Duff family controlled Fetteresso and expanded the building around the old tower house. 20th and 21st centuries In the 1940s, the castle was owned by Maurice Simpson and Geraldine Simpson (née Pringle). She was the heir to the Pringle knitware fortune. Subsequently, the Simpsons acquired and lived in nearby Muchalls Castle. After the Simpsons' tenure at Fetteresso, the roof was off the castle for some period starting around 1954, and the castle bought by a local landowner and then left to the Don family in his will. In the latter part of the 20th century, the castle was restored, greatly modified, to yield seven houses, which is its present use. As of 2006 Mrs Simpson still resides in the local area.

His best known work, A Concise Natural History of East and West Florida, published in 1775, is a valuable source of information about the Floridas during the period of British control. His maps and charts are considered better than any produced before, and also for many years after, their publication. Biography Romans was born Barend Romans in Delft, son of Pieter Barendsz Romans and Margareta van der Linden.Delft Genealogical DatabaseDenise Knapp, Bernard Romans in \\"The Genealogy of Denise Lemon and Bruce Knapp\\" He was raised and educated there, but emigrated to Great Britain as a youth or young man, and then to British North America around 1757, during the Seven Years' War, known as the French and Indian War in British North America. On March 3, 1761, Romans married Maria Wendel (born 1739) at the Dutch Reformed Church in colonial Albany, New York. A son, Peter Milo Romans, was born in Albany on January 16, 1762, who would marry in 1785 in Albany and have ten children. There is no further record of Maria Wendel Romans, who may have died young Romans remarried in 1779. By his own account, in about 1761 Bernard Romans entered into the King's service as a commodore, \\"sometimes at the head of a large body of men in the woods, and at the worst of times ... master of a merchantman, fitted out in a warlike manner.\\" After the war ended, Romans continued to go to sea. He sailed widely, both as a privateer during the war and as a merchant, reaching points as far north as Labrador, and as far south as Curaçao, Cartagena, and Panama. Travels in the Floridas In 1766-67, he commanded the sloop Mary. On his first voyage, the ship went aground on the Dry Tortugas, but he was able to get the ship off and reach port. On his second voyage, the ship was lost near Cape Florida (Key Biscayne). Having lost much of his personal wealth with the wreck of the Mary, Romans turned to surveying. He obtained employment as deputy surveyor of Georgia. He also accepted private commissions to survey land grants in East Florida, which had come under British control at the end of the French and Indian War. In 1768, Romans became principal deputy surveyor for the Southern District (the British Colonies of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, East Florida, and West Florida). Starting in 1769, Romans surveyed the coastal waters of East Florida. Later that year, his boat sank in the Manatee River near Tampa Bay. Romans walked overland from there to St. Augustine. Well aware of the historical significance of where he walked, he later wrote that he had been \\"on Ferdinando Soto's tract\\". He outfitted another boat, at his own expense, and resumed surveying the coast in September 1770. He reached Pensacola, Florida in August 1771, having recorded depth soundings, good harbors, and sources of fresh water, and drafted coastal charts, for much of the East Florida coast. Upon reaching Pensacola, Romans was hired to survey the western part of West Florida and the lands of the Choctaws and Chickasaws. The survey was not without its dangers; the Choctaws and the Creeks were at war. Rumors even reached Mobile that Romans and his party had been killed by Creeks. Roman's survey work in West Florida continued into 1772. In Pensacola, a John Lorimer recruited Romans to explore for new plant specimens. Romans soon discovered what he believed to be true jalap, which was much in demand in Europe as a cathartic. Jalap had previously been available only from New Spain, and the prospect of a supply under British control pleased many in West Florida. It was later realized that Roman's jalap was not the Mexican jalap, but a relative in the family Convolvulaceae, probably Solanum jamesii. This \\"wild jalap\\" or \\"wild potato\\" was in the Pharmacopoeia of the United States from 1820 until 1863. Romans pursued his botanizing enthusiastically, collecting many plant specimens and seeds, and began seeking support for a plan to establish a botanical garden in West Florida. Publishing A Concise Natural History of East and West Florida In early 1773, Romans left West Florida to travel to the northern colonies. He wanted to publish his nautical charts and navigational instructions, along with material on the natural history of the Floridas that he had gathered in his surveys. He also took rare seeds and plant specimens he had collected. His ship was \\"over-set at sea\\", and the seeds and plant specimens were lost or ruined. His navigational charts and the manuscript of the book he was writing on the natural history of the Floridas were saved. Romans was now planning an ambitious book of some 300 pages with copper plate engravings and two large maps of the Floridas and the Caribbean. He needed to find financial backers and sign up subscribers to meet the costs of publishing the book. This effort led him into many new contacts. In August 1773, Romans was admitted into the Marine Society of the City of New York. In January 1774, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. A paper by Romans on an improved sea compass was published in the society's Transactions, and he presented descriptions of new plants he found in Florida to the society. Although no longer resident in West Florida, Romans had also been appointed botanist for West Florida. During this time, Romans proposed to William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, Secretary of State for the Colonies and President of the Board of Trade and Foreign Plantations, an expedition to the northeastern parts of Asia. Romans gave more details of his scheme to Hugh Williamson, a fellow member of the American Philosophical Society. To Williamson, Romans expounded his plan for an expedition to explore the Mississippi River basin and the Great Lakes, then moving westward to the Pacific coast. From there, the expedition would cross the Pacific Ocean to Asia, and travel through Russia, eventually reaching Great Britain. This was thirty years before President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the Lewis and Clark Expedition, and almost twenty years before Alexander MacKenzie's crossing of the Canadian Arctic. Romans continued to work to get his book published. Romans had originally conceived his book as a guide to mariners, and one-quarter of his subscribers were involved in shipping. But Romans also was receiving questions from people who were interested in moving to the Floridas, and Romans expanded his book to accommodate them. From the originally planned 300 pages, the book grew to about 800 pages, and it had to be split into two volumes. Romans promised his subscribers that the second volume would be forwarded to them at no additional charge (the first volume had to be printed and sent off before the presses could be set up for the second volume). Romans placed ads in many newspapers, and traveled extensively seeking subscribers to the book. Romans had selected James Rivington, publisher of Rivington's New-York Gazetteer, to be his printer, and engaged Paul Revere to engrave most of the plates for the book. Romans also collaborated with Paul Revere on other projects, including the map that accompanied Rivington's printing of John Hawkesworth's book on the voyages of James Cook. The first volume of A Concise Natural History of East and West Florida was finally ready for delivery in late April 1775. Romans announced in Rivington's New-York Gazetteer that his subscribers should tell him where to deliver the books. Romans's announcement was published eight days after the Battles of Lexington and Concord. A second printing of the volume was required in 1776 to fulfill all subscriptions. Revolutionary War activities Romans' sympathies with the Revolution had developed before his book was published. He had appeared before the Boston Marine Society on December 1, 1773, and was in the city when the Boston Tea Party occurred. In his book, Romans described tea as a despicable weed, and of late attempted to be made a dirty conduit, to lead a stream of oppressions into these happy regions. In early April 1775, Romans was appointed a captain by the Connecticut Committee of Safety, with a charge to take Fort Ticonderoga and nearby British fortifications. He was given £100 with which to raise troops. Within a few days, Romans had over 200 men with him. While Benedict Arnold and Nathanael Greene took command of the large body of troops headed for Fort Ticonderoga, Romans' company was sent to capture Fort George on Lake George, a neglected post which surrendered without a fight. Romans went on to Ticonderoga, where he helped assess the ammunition that had been captured. Benedict Arnold reported favorably on Romans as an engineer after this service. Romans soon returned to Connecticut. It is not known if Romans was present at the Battle of Bunker Hill, but he published an illustration of it, An Exact View of the Late Battle at Charlestown, June 17, 1775. Romans also published a map of the area around Boston, The Seat of Civil War in America, and dedicated it to John Hancock. Romans' earlier work was also used by the British in their maps, particularly in A General Map of the Southern British Colonies, which was included in the American Military Pocket Atlas, intended for the use of mounted British officers. In New York, James Rivington had proved to be too neutral in his coverage of the growing conflict between the colonies and Britain, and, in November 1775, a mob of patriots destroyed his print shop. The second volume of Romans' book was in production at the time and was lost. Later, in 1775, the Continental Congress recommended Romans to the New York Commissioners for Fortifications in the Highlands to oversee the construction of a fort at Martelaer's Rock, across the Hudson River from West Point. Romans set to work surveying the river and designing fortifications. When the commissioners inspected the site, they were unhappy both with Romans' plans and with the site, which was exposed to the superior positions available across the river on West Point. Romans went to New York City and presented his plans to the Committee of Safety without mentioning the doubts expressed by the Commissioners. the Committee of Safety forwarded Romans' plan and expenses to the Continental Congress and, according to Romans, promised him that he would be appointed principal engineer for New York with the rank and pay of a Colonel. A struggle ensued for control of the project between Romans and the Commissioners for Fortifications in the Highlands. Romans proceeded with much of the work, but eventually went to Philadelphia to report and seek support. While Romans appeared to win approval from the congress, it was generally recognized that his work had not been very fruitful. In George Washington's words, Romans's fortifications were \\"very neat\\" and \\"very picturesque\\" but \\"upon the whole, Mr. Romans has displayed his genius at a very great expense and to very little publick advantage.\\" Romans was next given a commission of captain of the First Pennsylvania Company of Artillery, which soon joined the campaign against Quebec. After the Americans were defeated in Quebec, Romans's company was reassigned, in July 1776, to Fort Ticonderoga. Shortly after, General Horatio Gates sent Romans to investigate the preparations being made under the direction of Major General Philip Schuyler to defend Lake Champlain against the expected British invasion. Romans was shocked by the sight of the vessels being prepared for the lake fleet, but was unable to do anything. This fleet was soon defeated at the Battle of Valcour Island. Fortunately for the Americans, the battle had also been costly for the British, and they delayed their invasion southwards. In November 1776, the Pennsylvania Council of Safety appointed Romans Engineer and ordered that he be furnished with the means to conduct an experiment in \\"destroying distant objects by fire.\\" Unfortunately, there is no further record of this experiment. Romans also continued to produce maps, including two of Connecticut, one centered on Philadelphia, including most of New Jersey and Delaware, and portions of Maryland and Pennsylvania, showing the location of the Grand American Winter Camp 1778 at Valley Forge, and a map of the Northern Department of North America. Romans resigned his commission on June 1, 1778. He continued working on a history of the oppression of the Netherlands by the British. By the end of 1778, he had finished the two-volume Annals of the Troubles in the Netherlands, and the first volume was in the bookstores in January 1779. The second volume did not appear until 1782. On January 28, 1779, Romans married Elizabeth Whiting of Wethersfield, Connecticut, who was just 19 years old. A son, Hubertus Romans, was born on October 23, 1779. Romans joined the Southern Campaign in 1780. It is not clear what Romans's assignment was to be, but an application for a pension filed by Elizabeth Romans in 1848 states that Romans \\"was ordered to go to the State of South Carolina, there to join the Southern Army\\". The ship on which Romans was traveling from New London, Connecticut, to Charleston, South Carolina, was captured by the Royal Navy. Romans was held prisoner until the war ended. He died aboard ship while returning home. Both his widow, Elizabeth Whiting, and at least one early historian believed that Romans had been murdered on the voyage.

Popularly named the Perfect Repeater at its introduction, it largely set the standard for pump action shotguns over its 51-year high-rate production life. From August 1912 until first discontinued by Winchester in May 1964, nearly two million Model 12 shotguns were produced in various grades and barrel lengths. Initially chambered for 20 gauge only, the 12 and 16 gauge versions came out in 1913 (first listed in the 1914 catalogs), and the 28 gauge version came out in 1934. A .410 version was never produced; instead, a scaled-down version of the Model 12 known as the Model 42, directly derived from scaled drawings of the Model 12, was produced in .410. Description The Model 1912 (shortened to Model 12 in 1919) was the next step from the Winchester Model 1897 hammer- fired shotgun, which in turn had evolved from the earlier Winchester Model 1893 shotgun. The Model 12 was designed by Winchester engineer T.C. Johnson, and was based in part on the M1893/97 design by John M. Browning, in that it used a sliding forearm or \\"pump action\\" to cycle the mechanism. It was initially available in 20 gauge only (12 and 16 gauge guns were not sold until late 1913). The Model 12 was a very successful internal hammer pump-action shotgun. Its tubular magazine was loaded through the bottom of the gun. Empty shotgun shells ejected to the right. Depending on the particular wooden plug installed in the magazine, two, three, or four shells could be loaded into the tubular magazine. The magazine holds six 2¾-inch 12 ga. shells, when no plug is installed, unlike most shotguns of today which hold four or five shells. With forged and machined steel parts, the ultimate reason for discontinuation in 1964 was that it was too expensive to produce at a competitive price. The primary competition at this time came from the much less expensive Remington Model 870, which had been introduced in 1950. The majority of \\"modern\\" Model 12 shotguns manufactured after 1927 were chambered for 2¾-inch shotgun shells only, although some specialized models such as the Heavy Duck Gun Model 12 were chambered for 3\\" Super Speed and Super X shells (basically a 3\\" magnum). The early 20 gauge Model 12 guns had chambers that were 2½\\", and the 16 gauge Model 12s were chambered for a 2 9/16-inch shotgun shell. To add further confusion, some of these early Model 12s have subsequently been modified, with their chambers lengthened to accept 2¾-inch shotgun shells, while others remain in their factory-stock chamber lengths. Careful inspection by a gunsmith is always recommended to determine whether or not it is safe to fire a modern 2¾-inch shotgun shell in older Model 12s. Special production examples were produced by Winchester, the U.S. Repeating Arms Company, and Miroku after 1964 through 2006 through specialized gun collector purchase programs, but the Perfect Repeater shotgun was never mass-produced after 1964. The U.S. Repeating Arms Company (a subsidiary of FN) announced a complete closing of the New Haven, Connecticut factory facility in January 2006, thus ending the Model 12's long and illustrious career at the age of 95 years. Military use The United States armed forces used various versions of the Model 12 in World War I, World War II, Korea, and in the early part of the Vietnam War, until inventory was exhausted after the Model 12's initial production ceased in 1964. Versions of the Model 12 were type classified as the Model 12 or M12 for short. Approximately 20,000 Model 12 trench guns were purchased by the US Army in World War I, differing from the civilian version by having a shorter barrel, a perforated steel heat shield, and a M1917 bayonet adapter. Winchester Model 12 Trench Gun More than 80,000 Model 12 shotguns were purchased during World War II by the United States Marine Corps, Army Air Forces, and Navy, mostly for use in the Pacific theater. Riot gun versions of the Model 12, lacking the heat shield and bayonet, were purchased by the Army for use in defending bases and in protecting Air Forces aircraft against saboteurs when parked. The Navy similarly purchased and used the riot gun version for protecting Navy ships and personnel while in foreign ports. The Marine Corps used the trench gun version of the Model 12 to great success in taking Japanese-occupied islands in the Pacific. The primary difference in Model 12 shotguns between the World War II trench gun version versus the World War I trench gun version was that the original design, containing six rows of holes in the perforated heat shield, was reduced to only four rows during 1942. During the Korean War, the Marines used the Model 12 extensively. Likewise, the Marines and U.S. Army used the Model 12 during the Vietnam War. However, production of the Model 12 ended in 1964, which led to the Model 12 no longer being purchased by the military. However, there were numerous firearms already in the American arsenal, and the Model 12 would continue to see combat service until the end of the 1960s. During the middle 1960s, the Ithaca 37 shotgun was acquired for combat use, and it began replacing the Model 12 as the primary shotgun employed by the United States military. The Ithaca 37 eventually became the most commonly-used shotgun of the Vietnam War. Other shotguns which were used in that conflict included the Winchester Model 1897 trench gun, the Stevens Model 77 shotgun, and the Remington 870 Wingmaster, the latter of which was used more by the U.S. Navy than other branches. Unlike most modern pump-action shotguns, the Winchester Model 12 had no trigger disconnector. Like the earlier Model 1897, it fired each time the action closed as long as the trigger remained depressed from the prior shot. While the trigger remained depressed, as fast as one could pump the action open and closed another round would fire (\\"slam firing\\"). That capability and its 6-shell magazine capacity made it effective for close-combat.

The award was first launched in 1990 and ran for five years before falling into abeyance. It was revived in 2001 with the financial support of Arts Council England. Beginning in 2011 the administration of the prize was taken over by BookTrust, but retaining the \\"Independent\\" in the name. In 2015, the award was disbanded in a \\"reconfiguration\\" in which it was merged with the Man Booker International Prize. Entries (fiction or short stories) were published in English translation in the UK in the year preceding the award by a living author. The prize acknowledged both the winning novelist and translator, each being awarded £5,000 and a magnum of champagne from drinks sponsor Champagne Taittinger.

The convention of the was introduced by German musicologists such as Heinrich Besseler in the 1920s and became common in editorial practice by the mid-20th century. It is frequently applied in academic editions of 15th and 16th century music such as those in the multi-volume Corpus mensurabilis musicae published by the American Institute of Musicology. A few modern composers (such as Hugo Distler, whose vocal music is reminiscent of Renaissance vocal polyphony) have made a practice of using it in their music in order to minimize the regularity of meter.

Kostić wrote around 150 lyrics, 20 epic poems, three dramas, one monograph, several essays, short stories, and a number of articles. Kostić promoted the study of English literature and together with Jovan Andrejević- Joles was one of the first to begin the systematic translation of the works of William Shakespeare into the Serbian language. Kostić also wrote an introduction of Shakespeare's works to Serbian culture. Biography Laza Kostić was born in 1841 in Kovilj, Vojvodina—which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire—to a military family. Kostić graduated from the Law School of the University of Budapest and received a Doctor of Philosophy in jurisprudence at the same university in 1866. A part of his thesis was about the Dušan's Code. After completing his studies, Kostić occupied several positions and was active in cultural and political life in Novi Sad, Belgrade, and Montenegro. He was one of the leaders of Ujedinjena omladina srpska (United Serb Youth) and was elected a Serbian representative to the Hungarian parliament, thanks to his mentor Svetozar Miletić. Because of his liberal and nationalistic views, Kostić had to leave the Hungarian-occupied part of Serbia but he returned home after several years in Belgrade and Montenegro. From 1869 to 1872, Kostić was the president of Novi Sad's Court House and was virtually the leader of his party in his county. He was a delegate in the clerico- secular Sabor at Sremski Karlovci several times. He served as Lord Mayor of Novi Sad twice and also twice as Sajkasi delegate to the Parliament in Budapest. After Svetozar Miletić and Jovan Jovanović Zmaj, Laza Kostić was the most active leader in Novi Sad; his politics were distinct from those of his associates but he was convinced his mission to save Serbia through art had been baulked by obscurantist courtiers. In 1867, the Austrian Empire became Austria-Hungary and the Kingdom of Hungary became one of two autonomous parts of the new state. This was followed by a policy of Hungarization of the non- Hungarian nationalities, most notably promotion of the Hungarian-language and suppression of Romanian and Slavic languages, including Serbian. As the chief defender of the United Serbian Youth movement, Kostić was especially active in securing the repeal of some laws imposed on his and other nationalities in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. When Mihailo Obrenović III, Prince of Serbia, was assassinated, the Austro-Hungarian authorities sought to falsely implicate Laza, his mentor Miletić, and other Serbian intellectuals in a murder plot. Kostić was arrested and incarcerated but like the rest of them he was later released. In 1868, the new Prince of Serbia was the fourteen-year-old Milan IV Obrenović, who had fallen in love with Laza's most recent work Maksim Crnojević, which had been released that year. Milan's first act as monarch was to send for Kostić, \\"that great Serbian poet and activist for Serbian rights in Austria-Hungary\\". At the time, Kostić was back in Novi Sad after making a vitriolic speech against the Habsburgs at Milan's inauguration in Belgrade. He was returned to prison and a accused of high treason. The charges came to naught and he was eventually freed. With more false accusations pending against him, Kostić sought refuge in Belgrade. Front page of Kostić's play Maksim Crnojević, 1866 Kostić moved to Belgrade, where he became a popular figure as a poet. Through Milan's influence, Kostić obtained the position of editor of Srpsku nezavisnost (Serbian Independence), an influential political and literary magazine. Milan chose him to be Jovan Ristić's principal assistant at the 1878 Congress of Berlin and in 1880 Kostić was sent to Saint Petersburg as a member of the Serbian delegation. Belgrade's opposition parties began taking issue with Kostić's writings; he had boasted of his power over the King in jest but had disdain to make influential friends at court so in 1883 King Milan ask him to leave Belgrade for a time. Despite his bizarreness, Kostić was ranked a great poet and writer. Soon after, he took up residence in Cetinje and became editor-in-chief of the official paper of the Kingdom of Montenegro Glas Crnogoraca (The Montenegrin Voice), where he met intellectuals Simo Matavulj, Pavle Rovinski, and Valtazar Bogišić. In 1890, Kostić moved to Sombor where he married Julijana Palanački in September 1895 and spent the rest of his life there. In Sombor he wrote a book which describes his dreams Dnevnik snova (Diary of Dreams), and the popular poem Santa Maria della Salute, which is considered the finest example of his love poems and elegies.Scribd: Laza Kostić: Autobiografija (Autobiography of Laza Kostić) Kostić has been following two lines in his work and research: theoretical mind cannot reach absolute, not having the richness of fascination and life necessary to its universality. He was opposed to the anthropological philosophy of Svetozar Marković and the views of revolutionist and materialist Nikolay Chernyshevsky. He died on 27 November 1910 in Vienna while on a visit to the city. Verse and prose Laza Kostić in traditional clothes from Montenegro In his poetry, Kostić often touched upon universal themes and human concerns, especially the relationships between man and God, society, and fellow humans. He contributed stylistic and linguistic innovations, experimenting freely, often at the expense of clarity. His work is closer to European Romanticism than that of any other Serbian poet of his time. Kostić attempted unsuccessfully in numerous, incomplete theoretical essays to combine the elements of the native folk song with those of European Romanticism. The lack of success can be attributed to the advanced nature of his poetry, the ideas of his time, and his eccentricity. Of Kostić's plays. Maksim Crnojević (1863) represents the first attempt to dramatize an epic poem. Pera Segedinac (1875) deals with the struggle of the Serbs for their rights in the Austro- Hungarian Empire and his play Gordana (1890) did not receive much praise. Kostić was a controversial personality; he was more celebrated than understood in his youth and became less popular in his old age, only achieving real fame after his death. Today, it is generally accepted that Kostić is the originator of modern Serbian poetry. Translation of works in English At the age of eighteen, in 1859, Kostić undertook the task of translating the works of William Shakespeare. Kostić researched and published works on Shakespeare for around 50 years. The cultural ideals that motivated Kostić to translate Romeo and Juliet into Serbian were part of the Serbian literary revival that originated with Dositej Obradović in the eighteenth century. At the time, theatre emerged following the Serbian people's campaign for national independence in the late eighteenth century. During the 1850s and inter-war years, Kostić and his collaborator Andrejević made efforts to introduce Shakespeare to the Serbian public. He tried to bring closer the Balkan cultures and the Antiquity, experimenting with the translation of Homer into the Serbian-epic decametre. He translated the works of many other foreign authors, notably Heinrich Heine, Heinrich Dernburg, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton's The Last Days of Pompeii, and Hungarian poet József Kiss. All Serbian intellectuals of the period believed the existence of their country was bound to the fate of their native tongue, then spoken widely throughout the two foreign empires. This premise provided for Kostić's translation of Romeo and Juliet. The Serbian translation of Richard III was the joint effort of Kostić and his friend, the physician and author Jovan Andrejević-Joles. Andrejević also participated in the founding of Novi Sad's Serbian National Theatre in 1861. The year of the appearance of Richard III (1864) in Novi Sad coincided with the 300-year anniversary of Shakespeare's birth; for that occasion, Kostić adapted two scenes from Richard III using the iambic verse for the first time. Richard III was staged in Serbia and directed by Kostić himself. Later, he translated Hamlet but his work was met with criticism by notable literary critic Bogdan Popović. Kostić's translation of the fourteenth stanza from Byron's Canto III of Don Juan expresses Byron's advice to the Greek insurgents: :Trust not for freedom to the Franks – :They have a king who buys and sells :In native swords, and native ranks :The only hope of courage dwells, :But Turkish force, and Latin Fraud :Would break your shield, however broad. Personality and private life Laza Kostić may be characterized as an eccentric but had a spark of genius. He was the first to introduce iambic meter into dramatic poetry and the first translator of Shakespeare into Serbian. At a European authors' convention at the turn of the 20th century he tried to explain the relationship between the culture of Serbia and those of major Western European cultures. Kostić was friends with Lazar Dunđerski, the patriarch of one of the most important Serbian noble families in Austria-Hungary. He was in love with Jelena Lenka Dunđerski, Lazar's younger daughter, who was 29 years his junior. Although Lenka returned his love, Lazar Dunđerski did not approve of their relationship and would not allow them to marry. He arranged a marriage between Kostić and Juliana Palanački. Kostić attempted to arrange a marriage between Lenka and the Serbian-American scientist Nikola Tesla but Tesla rejected the offer. Lenka died, probably from an infection, on her 25th birthday but some authors believe she committed suicide.

The Creature Walks Among Us is a 1956 American monster horror film and the third and final installment of the Creature from the Black Lagoon series from Universal Pictures, following the previous year's Revenge of the Creature. The film was directed by John Sherwood, the long-time Universal-International assistant director, in his directorial debut. Jack Arnold, who had directed the first two films in the series, had moved on to \\"A-list\\" films, and felt he had no more to contribute to the horror genre. He suggested that his assistant director, Sherwood, could move up to full director, which partly affected Universal's decision to allow him to direct the film.Weaver et al. 2014, p. 234. The Creature Walks Among Us starred Jeff Morrow, Rex Reason, Leigh Snowden, Gregg Palmer, and Maurice Manson. The Creature was played by Don Megowan on land, and for his final appearance as the Gill-man, played by Ricou Browning underwater. And, like the original Creature from the Black Lagoon, had music composed by Henry Mancini, who at the time was under contract with Universal. It is considered to be the last film in the Universal Classic Monsters series. Plot Following the Gill- man's escape from Ocean Harbor Oceanarium in Florida, a team of scientists led by the deranged and cold-hearted Dr. William Barton (Jeff Morrow) board the Vagabondia III to capture the creature in the Everglades. Barton is mentally unstable and apparently an abusive husband to his wife Marcia (Leigh Snowden), as he becomes very jealous and paranoid when Marcia is with other men. Their guide Jed Grant (Gregg Palmer) makes numerous passes on Marcia (which she constantly rebuffs), with Barton becoming paranoid about the two. Marcia accompanies Jed and Dr. Tom Morgan (Rex Reason) on their initial dive to look for the Gill-man, despite her husband's fierce objections. During the dive, Marcia swims too deep and is overcome with the \\"raptures of the deep,\\" temporarily losing her mind, removing all her scuba gear. This forces Jed and Tom to abandon their hunt for the Gill-man to swim back and save her. When he is eventually captured, the Gill-man is badly burned in a fire leading to a surgical transformation performed by Barton, Tom and their colleagues Dr. Borg (Maurice Manson) and Dr. Johnson (James Rawley). While bandaging the Gill-man, the doctors notice that he is shedding his gills and even breathing using a kind of lung system. Now that the creature has more human-like skin, he is given clothing. The doctors attempt to get the Gill-man used to living among humans. Although his life is saved, he is apparently unhappy, staring despondently at the ocean. Barton ruins the plans when, in a murderous rage, he kills Jed, jealous that he had made romantic advances towards his wife. Realizing what he has done, Barton then tries to put the blame on the Gill- man. The Gill-man, witnessing the killing, and apparently realizing that he is being blamed for the murder, goes on a rampage. After ripping down the confining electric fence, he kills Barton and then slowly walks back to the sea. He is last seen on a beach, advancing towards the ocean.

It was produced by Eugene Frenke, directed by John Huston, and stars John Wayne, Sam Jaffe, and Japanese actress Eiko Ando. The film was shot primarily on location in Japan. Townsend Harris is appointed the first Consul General to Japan. Upon his arrival, Harris discovers that the Japanese thoroughly mistrust all foreigners, despite a two- year old treaty between Japan and the United States. Harris slowly earns the respect of the local governor and trust of the local townsfolk and is eventually granted an audience with Japan's military dictator, the Shōgun. Plot In 1856, Townsend Harris (John Wayne) is sent by President Franklin Pierce to serve as the first U.S. Consul General to Japan, following the treaty written by Commodore Matthew Perry two years before. Accompanied only by his translator-secretary, Huesken (Jaffe), Townsend comes ashore at the town of Shimoda prefecture, as specified in the treaty as the location for an American consulate. However, the Japanese governor (Sō Yamamura) refuses to accept his credentials, denying him any official status, due to a conflict between interpretations of the treaty terms. While Harris believes that the Consul shall be present whenever either country requires, the Japanese believe the terms to permit a consul only when both countries require. The governor holds to his interpretation, largely because of objections over the threats under which the treaty was forced upon them. Harris is permitted to remain in Shimoda, but only as a private citizen, with no recognition of his official status. He is provided the use of an abandoned home, adjacent to the town cemetery. The governor explains that, in the two years following Perry's visit, various natural disasters had taken place. Some Japanese believed them to be warnings from the gods to avoid foreign influences. In the weeks that follow, Harris is the target of distrust and hostility, to the extent that Tamura orders townspeople to not even sell him food. Some in Japan wanted the country opened, but many others feared the corruption of foreign influences, and invasion by the barbarians of other lands. For this reason, Harris is not permitted to leave Shimoda, nor to go any closer to the capitol in Edo, 100 miles away. For his own part, Harris does his best to cooperate with the Governor, even obeying orders to take down the American flag which had been raised to mark the location of the Consulate. His cooperation noted, after several months, Harris is eventually invited to dine with the Governor, a dinner following which Tamura sends a geisha named Okichi (Eiko Ando) to take care of Harris' needs. The relationship between Harris and Okichi grows closer and more intimate, and she helps him understand Japanese culture. Harris helps rid the village of a cholera epidemic and out of this comes Harris' opportunity to go to Edo, where he must then convince the Shogunate to open the country, while facing his greatest crisis.

Exteriors were shot on location in Japan at Kyoto and the Tōdai-ji shrine in Nara. Interiors and additional scenes were completed at Toho Studios in Tokyo and 20th Century Fox Studios, Los Angeles. During filming, Wayne and director John Huston did not get along; in one altercation, Wayne throttled and punched Huston on set.John Wayne:American (biography) p.436-437Emanuel Levy, comment on Barbarian and the Geisha: John Wayne on John Huston The film was heavily re-edited by 20th Century Fox before release. Director John Huston denounced this version and even wanted to have his name removed from the credits.The Innocent Bystander Robinson, David. Sight and Sound; London Vol. 42, Iss. 1, Huston had wanted to make a particularly Japanese film in terms of photography, pacing, color and narration but according to him only a few edits – representing his vision – were left intact in the theatrical version. Reception The film performed disappointingly at the box office. Despite Huston's anger at studio interference, the New York Times Bosley Crowther liked the film's cinematography calling it a \\"whole picture out of patience and pageantry\\". Blu-ray.com's Casey Broadwater observed this about the film: \\"Wayne's restrained and uncomfortable \\"other-ness\\" as a gaijin in Japan is essential to the story. With his cowboy swagger and deep commanding drawl, Wayne typifies every Japanese stereotype about brash, take-charge Americans, and Barbarians specific frisson comes from seeing his character stumped and stymied by a culture that values group-think over individualism\\". Historical background Lithograph of \\"Shimoda as seen from the American Grave Yard\\" looking towards the harbor – artist, Wilhelm Heine (1856). The film is based on American diplomat Townsend Harris and his time in Japan during the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate. President Franklin Pierce named Harris the first Consul General to the Empire of Japan in July 1856. He opened the first U.S. Consulate at the Gyokusen-ji Temple in the city of Shimoda, Shizuoka Prefecture. This consolidated the mission by Commodore Perry who established the first trade agreement between the U.S. and Japan in 1853.\\"Townsend Harris: America's First Consul to Japan\\" – biography by the Consulate General of Japan in New York Japanese Delegation Visits CCNY July 24 2006 to honor founder Townsend Harris: Visit Coincides With 150th Anniversary of Harris' Appointment as First U.S. Consul to Japan Harris left Japan in 1861. In Harris' time, Japan was living through the final years of its period when the country remained in international isolation and adhered to strict customs and regulations intended to promote stability. In 1868, just seven years after Harris' departure, the Meiji Restoration started Japan's emergence as a modernized nation in the early twentieth century through massive industrialization, and enormous reforms to its political and social structure. The film incorporates the enduring Japanese legend about Harris and a 17-year- old geisha named . The story says she was pressured by Japanese authorities into forming a relationship with Harris in order to make the trade meetings go more smoothly. However, after Harris departed Japan to return to America, she was insultingly called the \\"Barbarian Okichi\\" and was ostracized by her people; as a result, she began drinking and eventually committed suicide in 1892. According to historians, however, most of the story is simply untrue. Although Okichi was a real person, she was merely one of Harris' housekeepers, and he apparently fired her after only three days of working for him.

Set on a train journey from Ostend to Istanbul, the book was renamed Orient Express when it was published in the United States. The novel appeared in 1932 and was Greene's first true success. It was taken on by the Book Society and in 1934 adapted as the film Orient Express. Introduction Stamboul Train is one of a number that the author classed as an \\"entertainment\\". But though some elements in the novel have been described as \\"melodramatic incidents that could find a place in the most conventional of thrillers\\", Greene’s aim is to use them to go beyond their basic paradigm in order \\"to produce work that can be taken as art while also reaching a large audience\\".Brian Diemert, Graham Greene's Thrillers and the 1930s, ch.2 \\"Exploring the popular in two early novels\\", pp.47 – 61 His book followed two unsuccessful novels that Greene later disowned, The Name of Action (1930) and Rumour at Nightfall (1932). Writing in his autobiography, he describes how \\"for the first and last time in my life I deliberately set out to write a book to please, one which with luck might be made into a film\\". Among the preparations for writing his book, he mentions taking notes on a train journey to Cologne – \\"you may be sure the allotments outside Bruges were just where I placed them in April, 1931\\". He also plotted key scenes in which the characters were to be established through dialogue and he put himself in the mood by daily playing Arthur Honegger's \\"Pacific 231\\" on his gramophone at home.Ways of Escape, p.26 – 30 The characters include capitalist, a lesbian, and a revolutionary intellectual. The character of a self-regarding popular author Q. C. Savory got Greene into trouble even before the book appeared. J. B. Priestley was given a review copy and, coming to the conclusion that Savory was based upon him, threatened a libel suit and also to leave their joint publisher, Heinemann. Greene was therefore forced to make changes that involved the replacement of some twenty pages.Ways of Escape, p.27 – 29  Plot summary  The novel focuses on the lives of individuals aboard a luxury express making a three-day journey from Ostend to Istanbul (though Greene uses the old name for the city, Constantinople). The novel opens on board the ferry, on which several of the novel's major characters have travelled from England. Mabel Warren and Janet Pardoe join the train later in Cologne and Josef Grünlich joins it in Vienna. Although these characters are travelling for different purposes, their lives are intertwined in the course of the journey. Other scenes in places through which the train passes are also described, as well as Myatt's high-speed journey by car through the snow-laden countryside to and from the railway station at Subotica. A major part of the plot focuses on Carleton Myatt, a shrewd and practical businessman who trades in currants and has business interests in Istanbul. He is travelling because he is concerned that the firm's agent in Turkey, Eckman, has been cheating him. As he crosses interwar Europe, Myatt has to face antisemitic attitudes, both on and off the train. Because he feels sorry for the sick dancer Coral Musker, who is travelling 2nd class to join a show in Turkey, he buys her a 1st class ticket. The grateful Coral falls in love with him and spends the night in his compartment, during which, to his surprise, he discovers that she is a virgin. After she disappears from the train at Subotica he travels back to rescue her, but fails and barely escapes after rescuing the crook Grünlich under gun fire. Dr. Czinner is an escaped communist leader and former physician, travelling on a forged British passport after five years teaching in an English boys' school. He plans on leading a communist revolution in Belgrade, but discovers that the uprising has taken place too early and failed. Nonetheless, he decides to go back to Belgrade to stand trial as a political gesture. But he has been recognised by Mabel Warren, a lesbian journalist living in Cologne, who is travelling with her partner, Janet Pardoe. Warren now believes that she is onto a major news story. When the train arrives at Vienna, she leaves the carriage to phone her office but is stranded in the city when her bag is stolen. The thief is Grünlich, who has just killed a man during a failed robbery and now boards the train with Warren's money. Left behind, the angry Warren vows to get Czinner's story through other means. At Subotica the train is stopped on the Yugoslav border and Czinner is arrested. Also arrested are Grünlich, for having a revolver, and Coral, to whom Czinner has given a letter to deliver for him. A court martial is held at which Czinner is allowed to give the pointless political speech he intended for his show trial. He is sentenced to be shot that evening, while Grünlich is to be imprisoned for a month and then deported back to Vienna, where the police will be looking for him. Coral is to be deported back to England the next day. The three prisoners are kept in a waiting room, but when they realise that Myatt has returned in a car, the resourceful Grünlich breaks open the door and all three make a run for it. Only Grünlich escapes; Czinner is wounded and Coral hides him in a barn, where he dies. Next morning, Mabel Warren arrives at Subotica in pursuit of her news story and takes Coral back to Cologne. Mabel fancies Coral as a new partner but the account breaks off as Coral has a heart attack in the back of the car and her ultimate fate is left open. After the train arrives at Istanbul, Myatt discovers that Janet Pardoe is the niece of Stein, a rival businessman and potential business partner. He steals her from the proprietorship of the Cockney novelist Savory, who is travelling to the East in search of copy for his next book. Despite his own brief encounter with Coral, Myatt now considers marrying Janet and confirming the contract, signed by Eckart, to take over Stein's currant business.  Themes  The novel communicates a sense of unease which, in part, reflects the author's financial circumstances at the time he wrote it, and partly the gloom of the Depression era in England. In 1971, Greene judged that \\"The pages are too laden by the anxieties of the time and the sense of failure. […] By the time I finished Stamboul Train the day of security had almost run out. Even my dreams were full of disquiet.\\"A Sort of Life, 1971, pp. 212–13 The epigraph given the book is from George Santayana, \\"Everything is lyrical in its ideal essence; tragic in its fate and comic in its existence\\", which indicates its ambivalence of mood.Neil McEwan, Graham Greene, New York 1988, p.22 A major theme there is also the issue of fidelity, the duty to others vis-à-vis duty to self, and whether or not faithfulness to others pays; this theme is most clearly shown in the mental struggles of Czinner and Coral. The portrayal of anti-semitism, shown by several characters and particularly impacting on Myatt, was later to become a subject of controversy. The question has been raised how far Greene shared these views himself and was demonstrating them in his portrayal of Myatt. This was Michael Shelden’s view in his \\"prosecutional and problematic\\" Graham Greene: The Man Within (1994).Leo Mellor, \\"Early Graham Greene\\", Oxford Handbooks Online For David Pearce, however, \\"Anti-Semitism is not Greene. It is society in 1932.\\" He also quotes Maria Aurora Couto, who interviewed Greene in 1980. \\"Myatt is the underdog and the outsider, and a character treated with great sympathy. I interpret these [early] novels as an attack upon capitalism rather than against the Jewish race, or religion.\\"David R. A. Pearce, \\"Stamboul Train: the time table for 1932\\", in Dangerous Edges of Graham Greene, The Continuum International Publishing Company 2011, pp.33-5  Adaptations  Two films were adapted from Greene’s novel: The 1934 Orient Express and the BBC TV adaptation 1962 Stamboul Train.BFI The author was dismissive of both. \\"This film manufactured from my book came last and was far and away the worst [of several others on the same theme], although not so bad as a later television production by the BBC.\\"Ways Of Escape, p.26 Two versions were also written for radio. Shelden Stark’s Orient Express was broadcast in the CBS Escape series on 19 February 1949. This was only a half-hour drama very approximately based on the novel. Its American businessman narrator is Myatt, while Czinner, whom he rescues from death, is a naturalised US citizen.The broadcast is available on YouTube Jeremy Front’s ninety-minute Stamboul Train was broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on 18 November 2017.BBC Radio Drama Bibliography *Greene, Graham: Ways of Escape, 1980, Vintage reprint 1999 *Mellor, Leo: Early Graham Greene, Oxford Handbooks Online, 2014 References Category:Novels by Graham Greene Category:1932 British novels Category:Novels set on the Orient Express Category:Heinemann (publisher) books Category:British novels adapted into films ","title":"Stamboul Train"},{"id":"3815577","text":"A countermovement in sociology means a social movement opposed to another social movement. Whenever one social movement starts up, another group establishes themselves to undermine the previous group. Many social movements start out as an effect of political activism towards issues that a group disagrees with. “Researchers have used resource mobilization to study all manner of social and political movements such as environmentalism, father's rights groups, religious movements, and abortion rights”.Peckham, Michael. \\"New Dimensions of Social Movement/Countermovement Interaction: The Case of Scientology and its Internet Critics.\\" Canadian Journal of Sociology 23.4 (1998): 317. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 8 Mar. 2010. The reason for the start of countermovement groups is that people are competing for resources for political influence. Countermovement groups are a part of American society that try to compete for government legislation to support their own views. The resource mobilization theory is an important issue in countermovements. “Research mobilization theory was a response to social psychological theories that focused on grievances and viewed movements as collective identities”. This theory suggests that social movements organize their resources to make changes in society that fits in their views. As a social movement starts growing, there are those who oppose their views and in time start countermovements. For example, anti-abortion and abortion rights movements are countermovements to each other. There are countermovements relating to fathers’ rights, religion, and war. These movements and countermovements will never have a resolution so they try to pass their views into government legislation. Countermovements main goal is to oppose the other movement to get their views into the mainstream. Many of these movements try to recruit people to gain popularity and in time gain political support. In some cases an apparent countermovement group may be crerated deliberately by a party with a financial stake, a process known as Astroturfing. The Global warming countermovement is one example.Challenging Climate Denial, DOI: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199356102.001.0001 Environment An example of a countermovement has to deal with the environmental issues. Even with scientific facts and statistics that global warming exists, there are still groups that disagree that our environment is changing. As Jacques states, \\"the reality of doubt in environmental problems is not due to science, but has to deal with politics--global politics to be specific\\".Jacques, Peter. \\"The Rearguard of Modernity: Environmental Skepticism as a Struggle of Citizenship.\\" Global Environmental Politics 6.1 (2006): 76-101. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 4 Mar. 2010. Many who are “environmental skeptics” are saying that there are no environmental problems that will threaten humanity. Many of these skeptics are blaming environmentalist for stopping human progress to make standard of living rise. Environmentalists on the other hand blame factions within right-wing politics for this skepticism and becoming an anti-environmental countermovement. Jacques explains that, \\"The concentration of skeptical claims from the 1990s onwards indicates an intense burst of interest in the environmental skeptical program and is consistent with a conservative countermovement against global environmental concern\\". Fathers' rights movement Fathers’ Rights Groups have become a growing issue in American society. In response to the perceived high number of violent crimes committed against women by their male partners, the battered women’s movement (BWM) has been campaigning for greater awareness of domestic violence.Crowley, Jocelyn Elise. \\"Fathers' Rights Groups, Domestic Violence and Political Countermobilization.\\" Social Forces 88.2 (2009): 723-755. Academic Search Complete. EBSCO. Web. 4 Mar. 2010. (p. 723) With the widespread understanding that domestic violence is a serious problem in the United States and elsewhere, the BWM has found public support to create “tougher penalties against offenders and public vigilance against potential batterers, including fathers from dissolving families” (p. 723). At least partly in response to this, there has been a counter-movement of activists from the fathers’ rights movement (FRM) who argue that the battered women’s movements have created laws that targets men unfairly. Fathers’ rights groups have grown in numbers since the 1980s in Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Australia, and the United States (p. 727). The fathers’ rights movement has argued that the legal system is making it difficult for them to be 'good fathers.' The FRM employs the argument that being a biological father is different from being a social father because a biological father is simply the individual who makes a genetic contribution, while a social father is one who engages in all of their children’s activities (p. 727) The FRMs \\"have tapped into the emerging cultural notion that in the healthiest families fathers are involved in all aspects of their children's daily lives.(p. 727). Abortion The most controversial of countermovements are about whether abortion should be legal or not, which is fought by pro-life and pro-choice groups. The pro- life group is opposed to abortion under most grounds, notably those \\"on request\\". Some pro-life proponents believe abortion to be justifiable when serious health issues are present for the mother, while other proponents believe that abortion is unjustifiable under any circumstance. The pro-choice group believes that a woman has a right to abortion under all circumstances, often citing human rights do not encompass fetuses before fetal viability. Both of these groups tend to be adamant towards their views and neither sides' arguments seem to convince towards otherwise. “Although the issue of abortion is very controversial, most surveys indicate liberalization of public attitudes towards pregnancy termination between 1965 and the years immediately following Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision which legalized abortion. Recent polls demonstrate that between 80% and 90% of Americans approve of abortion in the case of poor health, defective fetus, or rape, and between 40% and 50% indicate approval for other reasons. Only 10% would like to prohibit abortion under all circumstances”.Shain, R.N. “A cross-cultural history of abortion.” PubMed.gov. U.S. National Library of Medicine, Mar. 1986. Web. 10 Mar. 2010. There is also information that people who are usually pro-choice or pro-life come from very different backgrounds and have different values. “Sociodemographic analyses indicate that individuals who disapprove of abortion are usually committed to organized religion, such as Roman Catholicism or fundamentalist Protestants, are usually very traditional/conservative with regard to women’s role in life, and are less educated than those who are pro-choice”. Both groups will create logical fallacies because both of these countermovements will not agree to each other's issues. Both of these countermovements try to use emotional appeal by “abortion advocates tie their cause to the importance of ‘choice’, while pro- life activist point out the significance of protecting all forms of life”. Conclusion In summary, countermovements have been a part of every movement. Many of the countermovements have tried to stop the opposing movements to get rid of their movement and control the politics of the issue. All countermovements are competing for resources whether it is political influence, money, or enforcing their doctrine on others. No matter the movement that comes up now or in the future, there is another group who will disapprove and make a countermovement.

They are an anadromous fish species ranging in the Eastern Pacific; from the Gulf of Alaska to Monterey, California. However, some are landlocked in the Columbia River Drainage, Montana, and Lake Shasta in California, with reported sightings in northern Baja California, Mexico.[Acipenser transmontanus summary page. (n.d.). Retrieved October 04, 2017, from http://www.fishbase.org/Summary/SpeciesSummary.php?ID=2594&AT;=White%2BSturgeon] Description A. transmontanus is distinguished by the two rows of four to eight ganoid bony plates between the anus and anal fin, with about 45 rays present in the dorsal fin. Coloring can range from gray to brownish on the dorsal side, paler on the ventral side, and gray fins. Barbels are situated anterior to the mouth, closer to the snout than the mouth. At sexual maturity, A. transmontanus can reach in length, while the maximum length recorded of any age class is , with common lengths around . While age at maturity is uncertain, possible age ranges of known A. transmontanus specimens range from 11–34 years old. The maximum published weight known was with a reported age of 104 years. Taxonomy Alternate common names include: Pacific Sturgeon, Oregon Sturgeon, Columbia Sturgeon, Snake River Sturgeon and Sacramento Sturgeon. The specific name is derived from the Latin acipenser (sturgeon), trans (beyond), and montanus (mountain). The white sturgeon is part of a Pacific clade of species including Kaluga (Huso dauricus), Sakhalin (Acipenser mikadoi), Green (Acipenser medirostris), Chinese (Acipenser sinensis) and Amur (Acipenser schrenkii) Sturgeon. Recent genetic analysis supports a close relationship between (A. transmontanus) and (A. schrenckii), which is only found in Asia, showing a common ancestor between the two around 45.8 million years ago. Using microsatellites, genetic differentiation between different river systems in the Pacific Northwest and California is high enough to be able to distinguish between white sturgeon populations and validate a structure in which watershed (A. transmontanus) resides in. Extant sturgeon species are polyploid, containing more than two paired sets of chromosomes, derived from an extinct ancestor containing 60 chromosomes. Genome duplication during sturgeon evolution has led to three different groups of species with 120, 240, and 360 chromosomes. Recent study of microsatellite inheritance in white sturgeon supports that it is an ancestral octoploid, with 240 chromosomes. Distribution and habitat White sturgeon are native to several large North American rivers that drain to the Pacific Ocean. They primarily live in estuaries of large rivers, but migrate to spawn in freshwater, and travel long distances between river systems. Reproducing populations have been documented along the West Coast, from northern Mexico up to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. White sturgeon are commonly found in deep, soft bottomed areas of estuaries, where movements in the water column is dependent on salinity.[Kohlhorst, D. W.; Botsford, L. W.; Brennan, J. S.; Caillet, G. M. (1991): Aspects of the structure and dynamics of an exploited central California population of White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). In: Acipenser. Actes du premier colloque international sur l’esturgeon. P. Williot (Ed.). CEMAGREF, Bordeaux, France, pp. 277–293. 518 pp. ()] Historical ranges have been modified substantially by overharvesting, habitat changes due to dams, and river regulations; all affecting habitat quality, suitability and connectivity. In the lower Fraser River, British Columbia, movement and abundance are assessed by acoustic tags and mark recapture methods. While the model developed by Robichaud, English and Nelson assumes a closed homogenous population, acoustic tags and mark-recapture data shows that they are sedentary during the winter months and mobile in the spring and fall, with data indicating that they leave the Fraser River and enter the Strait of Georgia during their mobile periods; this conclusion has been validated by microchemical evidence of marine exposure in Fraser River white sturgeon fin rays. Construction of dams for hydroelectric power production affects seasonal movement of white sturgeon in many river systems, with the Columbia River Basin being a large contributor to shifts in the distribution and movement. The dams present in the basin have largely blocked the upstream movement of sturgeon, due to designs of fish ladders being more specified for salmon and steelhead. While downstream passage of sturgeon through the dams has been reported, the route of passage was never identified. Downstream movement through the dams are only possible through operating turbines, open spill gates and the ice and trash sluiceway. Diet Larval white sturgeon in TL experience the highest mortality when they transition from endogenous to exogenous feeding, around 8–14 days post-hatch depending on conditions. Once larvae metamorphose into young of the year (YOY) and juveniles, they actively feed on the substrate, dominantly (Corophium) spp., relying on water currents to carry them downriver to areas of suitable food. The availability of (Corophium) spp. could play a key role in the survival of larval and YOY white sturgeon in the Columbia River and could possibly explain the apparent poor survival of larvae and YOY in some Snake and Columbia River reservoirs that apparently have successful spawning but poor recruitment.[Muir, W. D., McCabe, G. J., Parsley, M. J., & Hinton, S. A. (2000). Diet of first-feeding larval and young-of-the-year White Sturgeon in the lower Columbia river. Northwest Science, 74(1), 25-33] Juveniles less than TL are known to feed on tube- dwelling amphipods, mysids, isopods, (Corophium) spp, and other benthic invertebrates, as well as on the eggs and fry of other fish species. Adults greater than consume a variety prey species, adjusting to a piscivorous diet of herring, shad, starry flounder, and goby, as well as benthic items such as invasive overbite clam. With feeding movements influenced due to tidal cycles, studies show more active movement at night, hinting that white sturgeon may be nocturnal foragers. Studies have shown that dietary lipid requirements on larval white sturgeon effect overall body composition, plasma biochemical parameters and liver fatty acids. With increasing dietary lipid levels, whole body and muscle lipid content increases, as well as increased plasma triglycerides and cholesterol content. This shows that larval sturgeon post- hatch grow faster on high lipid diets, reducing glycogen stores but increasing stores of lipid in the liver. The importance of this can help to understand growth rates in changing environments with varying food sources. Reproduction A juvenile white sturgeon White sturgeon are iteroparous breeders with blank into river systems in the late fall and winter, spawning occurring in the spring months. There is much uncertainty around reproduction timing of events in white sturgeon, with many papers reporting differing results dependent on the river system observed. Chapman, Van Enennaam and Doroshov witnessed sexually mature females FL in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River system estimated around 9 years old by using the Von Bertalannfy growth function, while the youngest sexual mature was a male FL estimated to be six years old. However, other reports have sexual maturity for white sturgeon at 12 and 10 years old for females and males. Uncertainty around age estimates from fin ray annulus may account for any disparity. Spawning periodicity is thought to be 2 to 4 years for females and 1 to 2 years for males. Behavior during spawning is not well known, but it is known that they are communal broadcast spawners, where a female's eggs are fertilized by many males. When ready to spawn, white sturgeon choose a variety of substrates dependent on the river system, spawning on gravel or rocky substrate in moderate to fast currents, with observed depths of , and water velocities at the bottom on a range of 0.6-2.4 m/sec. When eggs are released by the female, they are negatively buoyant, and develop an adhesive coat upon contact with water, which allows them to attach to the substrate near where they were spawned. Hatching time is temperature dependent, and can range from 3–13 days. Optimal temperature is between , with mortality observed below and above . Importance to humans A white sturgeon farm in California White sturgeon are a resource to a variety of different social and economic groups around the world. Aquaculture facilities cultivate white sturgeon in California and juveniles can be sold to aquarist. They were once the main food source for First Nations people in the 1800s, until overfishing by commercial fleets for caviar drove them to near extinction by the early 1900s.[Israel, J., Drauch, A., Gingras, M. (2009). Life history conceptual model for white sturgeon. Unpubl. technical report to Bay Delta Ecosystem Restoration and Improvement Program, Sacramento, CA, USA, 54 pp.] Besides their meat, other important economic products associated with caught sturgeon are caviar, isinglass, and oil. While selling a wild white sturgeon and eggs is illegal in California, it is legal to buy legal caviar from California White sturgeon farms. Poaching is an ongoing issue, in which caviar can sell on the black market for 100-150 dollars a pound, while a consumer buying legally made caviar from California sturgeon farms pays anywhere from 40-700 dollars for an ounce. White sturgeon also play a role in sport fishing in the Pacific Northwest, while closed to retention in the Columbia River Basin, catch and release fishing is allowed, with enough popularity for guiding services to offer fishing trips targeted specifically at white sturgeon. Conservation status Trends in white sturgeon abundance has been monitored in California for decades, with data showing large variations in recruitment, including 5 or more consecutive years of low or no recruitment, with probable cause being due to low flows during winter and/or spring months. Although some present white sturgeon populations have been reduced over the past 30 years, some population trends in California are promising, resulting in new angling regulations, monitoring, research efforts, fish passage and habitat restoration. Despite being a relatively robust population that includes tens of thousands of sub-adults and adults, management is complicated due to exposure of pollutants, freshwater and estuary alteration, harvest, and because of its long life span, which can mask detection of reproductive success. NatureServe ranks white sturgeon globally secure, but imperiled in California due to anthropogenic impacts on their habitats. The American Fisheries Society considers them to be Endangered. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) of Wild Fauna and Flora has white sturgeon listed as Appendix II, which includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled to avoid utilization incompatible with their survival.How CITES works.

It was recorded in CBS Television City's Studio 43 in Los Angeles. The series debuted on Lifetime on February 5, 1990 and ran until May 4, 1990, and was hosted by comedian Louise DuArt, with Burton Richardson as announcer. Jay Wolpert created and produced the show. After the last first-run episode aired, the show went into reruns until August 31, 1990. Format=Round one Seven hidden words, numbered 1 through 7 and pertaining to a celebrity, were displayed on a monitor behind the contestants. The contestant in control chose a number, and the word was shown to both opponents and the home audience. He/she then had 15 seconds to describe the celebrity; saying the word awarded a point value from 100 to 250 based on its difficulty. If the contestant did not say the word, he/she received 5 points for any other hidden words that were said. Before time started, the opponents each secretly predicted whether the contestant would say the word, receiving 50 points for a correct guess. Three different celebrities were played in this round, with each contestant describing one and predicting on the other two. If two or more contestants were tied for the lead at the end of this round, a statement about a celebrity was read as a toss-up. The first contestant to buzz-in and correctly identify it as a fact or rumor scored one point and earned the advantage; a miss awarded both to the opponent. Round two The contestants were seated in descending order of their scores from round one. Beginning with the high scorer, each was given a series of statements and had to classify them as fact or rumor. Correct answers were worth 100 points each, while a miss gave control to the next contestant in line. DuArt occasionally performed impersonations of the celebrities mentioned, and one question was related to a teaser that she gave at the beginning of the show. This round lasted for approximately seven minutes, with a bell as a two-minute warning. When time ran out, the high scorer won $500 and advanced to the bonus round; ties were broken as in round one. Rodeo Drive (Bonus Round) The contestant had an opportunity to increase the amount of money in the bank on Rodeo Drive by answering five questions. He/she was given the names of two celebrities and a statement that was true about one, the other, or both. Each correct answer added $200 to the bank, which began at $1,000 after it was won. The contestant then got the chance to stroll down Rodeo Drive, which included four stores (each displaying a different prize) and the bank. At each location, the contestant had to identify a celebrity based on overhearing gossip about him/her. A correct guess allowed the contestant to advance to the next location. If the contestant cleared all five locations within 60 seconds, he/she won all four prizes and the money in the bank. Otherwise, the contestant received a prize of his/her choice from the successfully cleared stores and the bank value rolled over to the next show. Champions remained on the show until they were defeated or had played the bonus round five times.

The GMCLA was formed on July 12, 1979 as a volunteer effort of 99 gay men from all over the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. Since 1979 GMCLA has grown in size, gained professional artistic and administrative staff, toured nationally and internationally, released 16 CDs, and appeared with numerous stage, film, and television celebrities including Billy Porter, Lily Tomlin, Angela Lansbury, Bea Arthur, Malcolm Gets, Doris Roberts, Jerry Herman, Melissa Manchester, Mary McDonnell, Levi Kreis, Joanna Gleason, Alex Newell, Amber Riley, Charles Pierce, Miss Coco Peru, Valarie Pettiford, Jane Lanier, Randi Driscoll, Margaret Cho, Michael Jeter, Stephen Schwartz, Liz Callaway, Lance Bass, Jennifer Holliday, Tierney Sutton and LeAnn Rimes. The Chorus has appeared on several television broadcasts including the 85th Academy Awards, Access Hollywood, Will & Grace, $#*! My Dad Says, The Ren & Stimpy Show, Mad TV, and a six-episode arc on Six Feet Under.  Community involvement and history  The chorus first formed in July 1979 at Plummer Park Community Center, Los Angeles, with 99 members. The first major public event the GMCLA participated in was the March on Washington D.C. The GMCLA also participated in the first ever national LGBT concert at the Washington Memorial. The GMCLA continued to grow throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s. The AIDS crisis did not spare the chorus' members, The chorus suffered the loss of its musical director, Jerry Carlson, to HIV/AIDS as well as over 20 other members by 1988. Ultimately, over 150 members were lost to the AIDS pandemic leaving only eight original members of the chorus as members, who are known as 'First Nighters'. The Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles was under the direction of Christopher Verdugo from 2011 until September 9, 2016 when Verdugo decided to step down as director in search of new opportunities. Verdugo was a member of the choir for ten years, beginning as a choral member and later transitioning to his executive role in 2011. Under his leadership the chorus grew to 250 members. During his time with GMCLA, Verdugo drew inspiration from the \\"It Gets Better\\" project, a nonprofit organization founded by Dan Savage formed in response to the alarming rise of LGBT suicides among teenagers in the United States, to launch a national tour partnered with Speak Theater Arts. The main goal of the It Gets Better tour is, with the use of song and storytelling, to tackle a variety of issues that affect LGBT folk throughout their lives. The cast of the shows consists of eight members of the GMCLA who tour around the country. The cast partners up local schools and community members to deliver relatable content to youth at risk of bullying and their potential allies. The final show aims to shed light on the lives of LGBT peoples through musical performance. Dr. Joe Nadeau was named artistic director in the fall of 2013 and has worked alongside Kevin Bolling (Director of Philanthropy), Gavin Thrasher (Assistant Conductor), Brianne Cohen (Events and Tour Manager), Taylor Hartley (Marketing Operations Manager), and James Geiger (Online Development - Photographer). In January 2017, Jonathan Weedman was named the new Executive Director of GMCLA. Jonathan is an ardent supporter of the arts and of LGBT equal rights advocacy, and former esteemed longtime Wells Fargo Foundation Senior Vice President. At the end of December, 2018 Dr. Joe Nadeau resigned to return to Kansas City with his husband Eric, and has been succeeded by Gavin Thrasher, now Interim Artistic Director. GMCLA also started the Alive Music Project (AMP) in 2007, which has reached over 60,000 teenage students in middle and high schools in Los Angeles. Much like the chorus' partnership with the It Gets Better Project, the goal is to spread a message of love and hope to teens who may be struggling with their sexuality. The schools Gay Straight Alliances form partnerships with GMCLA to help improve the experience of LGBT youth in American schools. The members of GMCLA utilize their own stories and experiences to deliver a message of acceptance. The emphasis is placed on the impact singing with members of their own community has had in the creation of a safe space. The students and the members of the GMCLA come together at an assembly to participate in musical performances and a question and answer period. GMCLA is supported by many corporate and government partners. Notably, Foresters Financial helped launch GMCLA's Voice Awards. This annual award show is running on its 6th consecutive year and it aims to honor those who use their platforms for social change and advancement towards equality. In 2016, the award show raised funds in support of GCMLA's outreach programs: the Alive Music Project and the it gets better Tour. Hosted by Ross Mathews, television host from the popular show Hollywood Today Live, and Pauley Perrette, actress most commonly known for her role as Abby Sciuto in NCIS, the show was held on April 23 at the Dolby Ballroom Hollywood and had over 600 attendees. Notable performances GMCLA became the first gay chorus to tour central Europe in 1991. That historic tour was featured in a documentary entitled \\"Out Loud\\" and was broadcast on the PBS television network. GMCLA became the first gay men's chorus ever to perform for a sitting President of the United States, Bill Clinton. In September 2011, GMCLA sang for President Barack Obama at a fundraiser in West Hollywood, CA. GMCLA became the first openly gay performers ever to be broadcast nationally over Russian television during their 1999 concert tour (sold-out concert in Tchaikovsky Hall, Moscow). In 2006, GMCLA was the first openly gay chorus to tour South America (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile), performing at some of the most revered theatres and concert venues. Repertoire included North American and European classical and popular music from Bacharach to Verdi, as well as new works commissioned for the tour by Daniel Catán, Rosephanye Powell, and Daniel Alfonso. New music for the Tour was funded by the National Endowment for the Arts, the James Irvine Foundation, and Los Angeles County Arts Commission. In each of the four countries, the Chorus raised money for LGBT and HIV organizations, as well as helping to start the first gay chorus in South America, in Rio de Janeiro. Each year the Chorus presents three mainstage concerts in such venues as the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, California, Walt Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles, California and the historic Alex Theatre in Glendale, California; GMCLA performed over 100 times on the Alex stage since 1994, more than any other musical group in the theater's history. GMCLA was featured in the song \\"Shia LaBeouf\\" by Rob Cantor. In 2010 GMCLA recorded a music video of Cyndi Lauper's \\"True Colors\\" as part of the It Gets Better campaign in support of gay and lesbian teens. Singers LeAnn Rimes and Sheryl Lee Ralph joined the Chorus in December 2010 for their \\"Comfort and Joy\\" concerts, which also addressed bullying and teen suicide. In 2013 GMCLA performed in the 85th Academy Awards, now the Oscars, in the opening musical sequence \\"We Saw Your Boobs\\" with host Seth MacFarlane. The following year they were featured at the Hollywood Bowl in \\"The Simpsons Take The Bowl\\" with Conan O'Brien, Beverly D'Angelo and the cast and creators of The Simpsons, celebrating the show's 25th Anniversary.

It tells the story of a young African-American man whose talent for poetry is hampered by his social background. It won the Grand Jury Prize for a Dramatic Film at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival as well as the Caméra d'Or at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Raymond \\"Ray\\" Joshua (played by Saul Williams) is a young man growing up in the Southeast, Washington, D.C. neighborhood of Dodge City, slang for a real Southeast D.C. neighborhood.[A] Despite his innate gift for poetry and his aspiration to be a rapper, he finds it difficult to escape the pressures of his surroundings: violence and drug dealing. While participating in a drug deal gone wrong, Ray's close friend Big Mike is shot. Ray is caught by the police and sent to the District of Columbia Department of Corrections' central detention facility. He is arraigned for possession of a controlled substance at the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse and bail is set at $10,000. When his public defender explains his options (\\"cop out\\" and plead guilty), \\"rock\\" (stand trial), or \\"cooperate\\" (serve as an informant), Ray despairs, particularly as he is being pressured to participate in a drug culture \\"inside\\" very similar to what he was a part of \\"outside\\". Ray takes no sides, unwilling to believe that his options are limited to the choices he is being presented with. When threatened with violence in the prison yard, he retaliates with words, speaking the truths that he's witnessed in the form of a poetic rap meant to show the other inmates how their power and energy is being diverted into petty struggles with each other, rather than being directed toward the system that is keeping them down. In prison, he participates in the writing class of teacher Lauren Bell (Sonja Sohn), whom he comes to respect and admire. She advises him to pay more attention to his talents. When Ray is unexpectedly released on bail for a few days prior to his court date by an incarcerated drug dealer whom Ray had inspired with his revolutionary ideas, he is able to convince his friends and their Dodge City crew not to retaliate with more violence for the shooting — to break the cycle instead. He explains that the \\"projects\\" where they all live and die are a government experiment and that continuing to kill each other is exactly what those who set up the experiment want them to be doing. On the outside, he also reunites with Bell, and is welcomed into her circle of friends at a poetry reading at her home. They wind up spending the night together, despite her reservations about the future. The next day, she urges him to settle his legal troubles by agreeing to serve a year or two of prison time, rather than fighting the charges and potentially being put away for much longer. They quarrel, because Ray feels that Bell doesn't understand his situation. He leaves, but shows up that night at a poetry slam event in D.C.'s Cleveland Park neighborhood that Bell had invited him to, just in time to see her perform an extremely powerful and empathetic piece that was clearly written for him. When the crowd demands an encore, she invites Ray onto the stage to perform instead, and he delivers an impromptu dramatic poem — scrawled as he crossed the city on public transit on his way to the slam — an emotional piece about black males and the criminal justice system. When the crowd demands an encore, Ray tells Lauren he needs to get some air, then leaves again. He wanders the streets until he is drawn to the Washington Monument.

He served in the Marine Corps for over 29 years. Military service Richard Spooner was living in Northern California when World War II broke out; he subsequently enlisted in the Marines at age 17 as a rifleman. Spooner participated in several operations during the war, including the Battle of Saipan, where he was briefly taken prisoner by the Imperial Japanese Army. He also fought in the Battle of Okinawa. After the war, he was promoted to gunnery sergeant and eventually commissioned as a second lieutenant. During the Korean War, Spooner served in with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing and also taught infantry tactics at Camp Pendleton. During his subsequent career, he commanded five companies and the Marine detachment aboard a heavy cruiser. By the time the Vietnam War broke out, Spooner had achieved the rank of major. During the war, he served in the Provost Marshal Division and as an adviser to the South Vietnamese police. Spooner received a medical discharge and retired from the Marine Corps in 1972. Published works Spooner has written two books, the first in 2004 being The Spirit of Semper Fidelis, a historical novel about the Pacific War which is actually a personal memoir. He wrote the book after a conversation with several Marine captains who were unaware that the Marine Corps had fought on Saipan during World War II.

Château Ducru-Beaucaillou is also the name of the red wine produced by this property. The wine produced here was classified as one of fifteen Deuxièmes Crus (Second Growths) in the original Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. History Bruno Borie The estate Château Ducru-Beaucaillou was purchased by Francois Borie in 1941 and has remained in the family since then. The family also owns other estates, Château Grand-Puy-Lacoste and Château Haut-Batailley. In the mid-1980s the estate battled an infestation of TCA in their cellars that marred several vintages including the 1988, 1989, and 1990. The Chateau has since corrected the problem, and today the wines are fermented and aged in a new underground cellar created in the late 1990s. Today the estate is managed by Bruno Borie. Vineyard Ducru-Beaucaillou's vineyards consist of 50 hectares of well-drained gravel with stones up to 2.5 inches in diameter. (beaucaillou means \\"beautiful stones\\".) The vineyards are planted in Cabernet Sauvignon (70%) and Merlot (30%); previous plantings of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot having been uprooted. The vines' average age in 2005 was 38 years. Wine The château of Château Ducru-Beaucaillou Ducru- Beaucaillou produces two wines. The grand vin called Château Ducru- Beaucaillou, and a second wine produced since 1995 to which lesser-quality lots are relegated, La Croix de Beaucaillou. The wines are aged for 18 months in 50% to 80% new oak barrels according to the richness of the vintage, fined with egg whites, lightly filtered, and then bottled.

NASKEF was closed on 8 September 2006, and its facilities were taken over by the Icelandic Defence Agency as their primary base until 1 January 2011, when the Agency was abolished and the base handed over to the Icelandic Coast Guard, which has since then operated the base. The base was built during World War II by the United States Army as part of its mission to maintain the defense of Iceland and secure northern Atlantic air routes. It served to ferry personnel, equipment, and supplies to Europe. Intended as a temporary wartime base under an agreement with Iceland and the British, US forces withdrew by 1947 but returned in 1951 as the Iceland Defense Force resident on a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) base. The base was regularly visited by the American military and other NATO allies for military exercises, NATO Air Policing, and other tasks. In 2017, the United States announced its intention to modify the largest hangar on the Icelandic base in order to house the new Boeing P-8 Poseidon ASW aircraft being introduced. History Emblem of the Icelandic Base Command Lockheed P-38F-5-LO Lightning 42-12596 of the 50th Fighter Squadron in Iceland, 1942 After gaining independence from Denmark in 1918 with the signing of the 25-year Danish-Icelandic Act of Union, Iceland followed a policy of strict neutrality. In 1939, with war imminent in Europe, the German Reich pressed for landing rights for Lufthansa's aircraft for alleged trans-Atlantic flights. The Icelandic government turned them down. A British request to establish bases in Iceland for the protection of the vital North Atlantic supply lines after German forces occupied Denmark and Norway in April 1940 also was turned down in accordance with the neutrality policy. Nevertheless, the British government felt that it could not do without bases in Iceland and on 10 May 1940 the people of Reykjavík awoke to the sight of a British invasion force. The government of Iceland protested the invasion but asked the populace to treat the occupying force as guests. Following talks between British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States, Iceland agreed to a tripartite treaty under which United States Marines were to relieve the British garrison in Iceland on the condition that all military forces be withdrawn from Iceland immediately upon the conclusion of the war in Europe. In addition to their defense role, U.S. forces constructed the Keflavik Airport as a refueling point for aircraft deliveries and cargo flights to Europe. The airport was built by the United States military during World War II, as a replacement for a small British landing strip at Garður to the north. It consisted of two separate two-runway airfields, built simultaneously just 4 km apart. Patterson Field in the south- east opened in 1942 despite being partly incomplete. It was named after a young pilot who died in Iceland. Meeks Field to the north-west opened on 23 March 1943. It was named after another young pilot, George Meeks, who died on the Reykjavík airfield. Patterson Field was closed after the war, but Meeks Field and the adjoining structures were returned to Iceland's control and were renamed Naval Air Station Keflavik, for the nearby town of Keflavík. In 1951, the U.S. military returned to the airport under a defense agreement between Iceland and the U.S. signed on 5 May 1951. With the end of the war in Europe, Keflavik Airport became a transit point for aircraft returning from the European Theater of Operations to the United States. With American air activities greatly reduced in Europe in the immediate postwar months, U.S. flying operations were similarly reduced in preparation for transfer of the base to the Icelandic government at the end of 1946. With all noncritical surplus equipment and supplies disposed of, all U.S. air activity ended at the airfield on 11 March 1947.

The United States provided all the maintenance and operation of the airport through an American civilian contractor. American Overseas Airlines, followed by Airport Overseas Corporation personnel, operated the military portion of Keflavik Airport after its reversion to Icelandic control at the end of March 1947. In 1949, Iceland voted to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) among protests about the US militarizing the country, and the base became a Cold War base. Joining NATO required neither the establishment of an Icelandic armed force, nor the stationing of foreign troops in the country during peacetime. However, with the developing Cold War with the Soviet Union, and world tensions increasing, Iceland's leaders reconsidered. Icelandic officials decided that membership in the NATO alliance was not a sufficient defense and, at the request of NATO, entered into a defense agreement with the United States. This was the beginning of the Iceland Defense Force. Over the next four decades, the Defense Force was \\"at the front\\" of the Cold War and was credited with playing a significant role in deterrence. On 25 May 1951 the U.S. Air Force reestablished a presence at Keflavik Airport with the establishment of the 1400th Air Base Group. Jurisdiction of the airport was assumed by Military Air Transport Service (MATS). MATS re-established a military air terminal and refueling point for trans-Atlantic air service between the United States and Europe at Keflavik. MATS (later MAC and Air Mobility Command) units remained at the airport until the withdrawal of United States military units from Iceland in 2006. During 1947–51, while the base was operated by a US civilian contractor company most of the World War II temporary structures were left empty and became badly deteriorated. The airfield complex, one of the largest in the world during the war, also required upgrading to accommodate modern aircraft. The contractor had extended one runway, constructed a new passenger terminal and hotel building, one aircraft hangar, a hospital, housing units and other facilities for the staff. But this was insufficient for the new Defense Force, so additional facilities had to be provided quickly. A crash reconstruction program was initiated and temporary housing was erected during the construction of permanent housing. The airfield was extended by the Nello L. Teer Company and two new aircraft hangars were constructed. Most of this work was completed by 1957. Soon after the return of US forces to Keflavik. Air Defense Command (ADC) established a temporary radar station at the airport, equipped with World War II-era AN/TPS-1 and AN/TPS-3A radars that operated until a permanent radar station could be constructed at nearby Rockville AS. Between 1952 and 2006, Air Forces Iceland provided air defense for Iceland, operated Keflavik Airport, and furnished base support for all U.S. military forces in Iceland participating in its defense under NATO. Also Air Force component of NATO Iceland Defense Force. ADC, later renamed Aerospace Defense Command used the facility for air surveillance of Iceland and the North Atlantic, employing F-102 Delta Dagger and then F-4C Phantom II fighters as interceptors. Over 1,000 intercepts of Soviet aircraft took place inside Iceland's Military Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). The United States Navy assumed the responsibility of running the air station from MATS in 1961. In 1974, the left-wing Government of Iceland's new proposal to close the base triggered a petition that garnered 55,000 signatures, about a quarter of the population of the entire nation. This led to the ruling coalition collapsing and the 1974 Icelandic parliamentary election being held. On 1 October 1979 Tactical Air Command (TAC) absorbed ADC's assets, and the F-4E Phantom II aircraft of the 57th Fighter Interceptor Squadron (57 FIS). In July 1985, F-15Cs and F-15Ds replaced the aging F-4s, and the tail code \\"IS\\" was assigned to Air Forces Iceland (AFI). During the height of the Cold War in the 1980s, Keflavik also hosted rotational E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft and KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft from CONUS to support the air defense mission and rotational HC-130 Hercules aircraft from RAF Woodbridge from the 67th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron to support their detachment of Keflavik-based HH-3 Jolly Green Giant and later HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters in their search and rescue mission. Beginning in 1984, the 932d Air Control Squadron established a Radar Operations Control Center at Keflavik which coordinated the 57th FIS interceptors to contacts passing through the GIUK gap. It received long-range radar inputs from 5 radar sites: the four sites in Iceland plus a data-tie from the Thorshavn AS radar in the Faroe Islands. Thorshavn was located atop Mount Sornfelli. The ROCC remained active until the turnover of the facility in 2006. Air Forces Iceland continued the air defense mission of Iceland as a tenant organization at Keflavik. Under ADC until 1979 and under TAC until 1992. On 1 June 1992, Air Combat Command (ACC) assumed command and control of AFI and the 57 FIS. Less than a year later, the 57 FIS was redesignated as the 57 Fighter Squadron (57 FS) and reassigned to the 35th Fighter Wing that was transferred from the closing George AFB, California. On 1 October 1994, the 35th Wing was inactivated at Keflavik and reactivated that same day at Misawa Air Base in Misawa, Japan. The 35th Wing was replaced by the newly activated 85th Wing. On 1 March 1995, the 57th FS was inactivated and the interceptor force was replaced by Regular Air Force and Air National Guard F-15 Eagle fighter aircraft rotating every 90 days to Iceland until the USAF inactivated the 85th Group in 2002. United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) took over ACC responsibilities at Keflavik on 1 October 2002 as part of a larger restructuring of the unified commands. The 85th was reduced to a Group level and supported rotational deployments.

The major commands stationed on the base were the USAF's 85th Group, Fleet Air Keflavik, the headquarters of the U.S.-provided Iceland Defense Force, Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station (NCTS) Keflavik, U.S. Naval Hospital Keflavik and the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) shore terminal at Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Keflavik. The positions of Commander, Fleet Air Keflavik and Commander, Iceland Defence Force were held by the same U.S. Navy rear admiral. There were more than 25 different commands of various sizes and personnel from the US Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard in Iceland. Also present were representatives from Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark. NASKEF was responsible for providing all support facilities, including the runways, housing, supply and recreational facilities. The primary mission of Naval Air Station Keflavik was to maintain and operate facilities and provide services and material to support operations of aviation activities and units of the operating forces of the Navy and other activities and units, as designated by the Chief of Naval Operations. A U.S. Navy P-3C Orion of Patrol Squadron 56 (VP-56) at Keflavik, 1977. U.S. Navy use of the facility allowed the housing of rotational P-3 Orion squadrons, aircraft, flight crews, maintenance and administrative support personnel from their CONUS home bases for six-month deployments in support of antisubmarine warfare and maritime patrol missions until 2004. As a NATO mission, the U.S. Navy P-3s were frequently augmented by U.S. Navy Reserve P-3 squadrons and detachments of Canadian Forces CP-140 Aurora, Royal Netherlands Navy P-3, German Navy Breguet Atlantique and Royal Air Force Hawker Siddeley Nimrod MR2 maritime patrol aircraft. Army National Guard units and Interim Marine Security Forces stormed the lava fields surrounding the base during training exercises such as Northern Viking. NAS Keflavik employed approximately 900 Icelandic civilians who worked with military personnel, providing the services necessary to operate the base. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, the airfield was available for maritime patrol activities, air defense and for transiting aircraft between North America and Europe, in addition to supporting Iceland's international civilian aviation. The flag of Iceland being raised and the flag of the US being lowered as the US hands over the Naval Air Station to the Government of Iceland The NATO base did not have a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) with the Icelandic Government and the base lacked the roadway entrance security gates characteristic of most military installations, having only Icelandic Customs officials instead. Icelandic nationals had unrestricted access to most of the base, especially since the civilian international airport terminal was also located on the base at the time. Icelandic nationals were only barred from actual security-restricted military facilities such as aircraft parking areas, squadron and hangar facilities and classified operations centers. During the height of the Cold War, this access situation created definitive operational security (OPSEC) concerns by U.S. and NATO officials due to potential espionage activities by Soviet operatives masquerading as Icelandic nationals. In addition, during this same time period, the former Soviet Union constructed one of their largest embassy facilities in the nearby capital, Reykjavik, which doubled as a diplomatic cover for intelligence collection activities against U.S. and NATO military forces. Access to the base was restricted to authorized military and civilian personnel after the construction of a new civilian passenger terminal on the opposite side of the airfield in the mid-1980s. The base offered a wide variety of recreational services which included bowling, swimming, gymnasium, theater, social clubs, a Wendy's restaurant, and hobby centers. Other services included a Navy Exchange, commissary, bank, credit union, hospital, beauty shop, tour office and morale flights to the rest of Europe and the United States. Golfing was available in a nearby community. The American base staff had their own names for various places in Iceland, e.g., \\"Kef\\" for Keflavík and \\"Hurdygurdy\\" for Hveragerði.

The 1965 decision to deploy the Sound Surveillance System to the Norwegian Sea was followed by establishment of Naval Facility Keflavik, in which output of the array at sea was processed and displayed by means of the Low Frequency Analyzer and Recorder (LOFAR), in 1966 and the first deployment of a 3 X 16 element array system. NAVFAC Keflavik was commissioned 1 March 1966 with nine officers and sixty-nine enlisted personnel, eventually reaching 15 officers and 163 enlisted. The first detection of Soviet Victor- and Charlie-class submarines was in 1968 with systems terminating at the facility followed by the first detection of a Soviet Delta Class Nuclear submarine in 1974. The first detection of a Soviet nuclear submarine had been by United States Naval Facility, Barbados on 6 July 1962 of a submarine off the coast of Norway as it entered the Greenland- Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gap. The facility was decommissioned on 13 December 1996.  Deactivation  On 15 March 2006, the U.S. Ambassador to Iceland announced that the United States had decided to substantially reduce the size of the Iceland Defense Force. During a six-month transition to reduce the military presence in Iceland, most facilities closed and most of the service members departed, leaving behind a core team of active duty and Reserve personnel to finish the job. By mid-July 2006, many of the military spouses and military active duty staff had transferred. On 8 September 2006, NASKEF's last commanding officer, Capt. Mark S. Laughton, presided over a ceremony effecting the disestablishment of the air station.Gone since September 30, 2006 ) On 26 October the government of Iceland established the Keflavik Airport Development Corporation or Kadeco which was given the task of converting those portions of the base no longer needed into civilian use.

Since May 2008 Keflavik has periodically hosted NATO fighter, AWACS and support aircraft participating in Icelandic Air Policing deployments. In January 2010, Verne Holdings announced that it had received equity funding from the Wellcome Trust to build a data center at Keflavik. The data center will take advantage of the available geothermal power and free cooling to minimize its carbon footprint. In September 2015, news media reported U.S. government officials expressed a desire to reopen aspects of the NATO base of Keflavik Naval Air Station, to cope with increasing Russian military activity around Iceland. In 2016 the United States began preparations to establish regular patrol rotations at the base, and in 2017 announced its intention to build new hangars to house Navy P-8 Poseidon aircraft.

History  The company was first established in 1972 as Kitty Music Corporation under Hidenori Taga. It was a subsidiary of Polydor and MCA Inc., producing TV drama soundtracks. Their first was for the 1972 film Hajimete no Tabi. By 1979 the company began to branch off into live action with the films Kagirinaku toumei ni chikai buru and The Rose of Versailles (Kitty had no association with the 1979 anime version of the latter, which was made by Tokyo Movie Shinsha). However, major success first came with their anime version of Rumiko Takahashi's Urusei Yatsura. Starting in 1981, it marked Kitty's entry into anime production. Over the next two decades, Kitty Films would become noteworthy in and outside Japan as the producer of most of the animated versions of Takahashi's manga series, including Maison Ikkoku and Ranma ½. Takahashi had in fact attended the same college as Shigekazu Ochiai, the planner of most of Kitty's anime productions. Despite their fame as producer, the actual animation of Kitty's works was handled by several independent anime studios, some of which still exist today. Studio Pierrot did the animation for the first half of Urusei Yatsura, Studio Deen animated the second half (except for several of the OVAs) and all of Maison Ikkoku and Ranma, while Madhouse handled the final Urusei Yatsura movie, some of the later Urusei Yatsura OVAs, Legend of the Galactic Heroes, and YAWARA! a fashionable judo girl! Unfortunately, the company had suffered financial troubles from early on, which started to come to a head towards the end of the Ranma TV series in 1992. Hidenori Taga had in fact helped finance Kitty's film division by spending money from their music branch, and that year was forced to step down due to an unknown scandal, while Shigekazu Ochiai transferred to Pao House Studios (he died in 1999). Kitty continued to produce less well- known shows such as Ping Pong Club (1995), but their output shrank to almost nothing by the end of the 20th century. Rumiko Takahashi did not work with Kitty again after the last Ranma OVA was released in 1996; Sunrise handled the animation duties on Inuyasha, and TMS animated Rumiko Takahashi Theater. Kitty also had a subsidiary animation studio that produced a few anime series and OVAs. The studio's name was Kitty Film Mitaka Studio and never became as famous or successful as its parent. The studio was eventually disbanded. Kitty Films was eventually reincorporated as Kitty Group and mainly exists as a talent agency, having sold off the rights to most of the Kitty Films library.

General Giannou was educated at the University of Toronto Schools. After a year of studies at McGill University, Giannou left Canada to spend a year teaching in Mali. There he fell sick, and was cared for by a team of two French-trained Malian doctors. Recognizing the doctor's frustration at the disparity between the facilities in which they had been trained and those available to them for practice, Giannou resolved to study medicine within the developing world in order to practice within it. After studies in Algiers, Algeria; Angers, France; and Cairo, Egypt, Giannou went on to begin a surgical career which has taken him to many of the contemporary world's most mediatized conflict zones, including Afghanistan, Chechnya, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia and Somalia. Although he had trained as a cancer surgeon in Egypt, Giannou began to develop a specialized expertise in war surgery. Giannou is reportedly known among humanitarian workers for his efficiency. He is reputed to be one of the few non-Palestinians to have sat as a member of the Palestine National Council, and is noted for his work as the only surgeon, alongside thousands of Palestinians, during the Lebanese Shiite militia Amal's siege of the Palestinian refugee camp Shatila in 1985–86, documented in his Besieged: A Doctor's Story of Life and Death in Beirut (1991). Chechnya controversy In 1996 the ICRC decided to build a surgical hospital in the city of Novye Atagi, 25 kilometres south of the capital, Grozny. Giannou and others based their decision on the success of the Kesanyeh hospital in Somalia, which was able to treat thousands of victims of the war and is still operating successfully today. By the time the hospital in Chechnya was completed, however, relatively few wounded remained in the area. The hospital would treat 300 war-wounded, among whom about 45 land-mine victims, but staff faced growing hostility from the local population. On 17 December 1996 ICRC staff in Novye Atagi were attacked by as-yet-unidentified assassins in the worst single attack on Red Cross workers in the organization's history, leaving six members dead and one severely wounded. Giannou returned to Novye Atagi to help return the bodies for burial, calling the experience \\"one of the worst experiences of my life\\". Following the attacks the ICRC evacuated some 70 employees from Chechnya; other international aid agencies followed their lead. Today Giannou left his official post with the ICRC after 7 years as the head of Unit Surgery, and today carries out international surgical missions around the world on their behalf. He is the topic of the Cineflix film \\"On the Border of the Abyss\\" which covers his lifetime of work in helping less-fortunate people and in mastering the concepts of war surgery. The documentary was aired, as \\"War Surgeon: Chris Giannou\\", by the Canadian public television station TVO on 10 April 2002. Recently, Giannou was the lead author on a new War Surgery book published by the International Committee of the Red Cross. Volume 1 of the book, called \\"War Surgery: Working with Limited Resources in Armed Conflict and Other Situations of Violence\\" is currently available on the ICRC website. He continues to inspire many to become war surgeons (such as FTH). Awards In 1991, Giannou was inducted as a member of the Order of Canada.

Biography He was born at Sremska Kamenica in 1730. His original surname was Dimitrijević, but later the nickname \\"Kračun\\" stuck. He studied art under Dimitrije Bačević, a well-known icon- and portrait painter, before taking monastic vows and entering the Vienna Academy in 1769. During his lifetime he produced numerous icons and altarpieces that are still extant today in Serbian Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches and cathedrals throughout the province of Vojvodina. He was an acknowledged master of the Baroque period, considered the first great modern Serbian painter, and the most renowned of the Baroque and Rococo painting style in northern Serbia. His contemporaries were Stefan Tenecki, Dimitrije Popović, another student of Bačević, and Jakov Orfelin, among others. His first famous work was the iconostasis in the Church of St. George in Sombor, of which only the throne of Christ is preserved (in the museum of Kula). Several of his icons, with the representations of Apostles and Prophets, from Hopovo Monastery was also preserved. Kračun's iconostasis from Neštin (dated to 1773) and Susek (1779) bear his signature. The new themes, like the cycle with the Passion of Christ, appear differently arranged because of the influence of the Roman Catholic church and Ukraine. Also, unusual is the placement of Emperor Uroš and Prince Lazar on the north and south doors. His greatest and most important works, done between 1771-1781, are the two iconostases in the Cathedral Church of St. Nicholas in Sremski Karlovci. The smaller one in the chapel of St. George in the choir area (now in the Gallery of Matica Srpska, Novi Sad) and the other, larger one, in the church which was the most representative structure of the Serbian baroque built between 1752 and 1762, by Metropolitan Pavle Nenadović. on the small iconostasis, the Orthodox icon of the Mother of God was transformed \\"into a baroque genre scene of washing over the water pool surrounded by nobles and the clergy, the poor and the rich, gathered together.\\" The Large iconostasis was made by Kračun, together with Jakov Orfelin. His were the throne icons: St. Simeon and Saint Sava St. Basil and St. John the Theologian, twelve Feast icons several icons from the cycle of the Passion of Christ. The rest of the throne icons were done by Orfelin. Christ, Mother of God, St. John, the Descent of the Holy Spirit unto the Apostles, and the large icon of the Holy Trinity which bears his signature. For the Cathedral Church, Kračun did ten icons mounted on wood and for the upper church in Karlovci a series of icons. Several iconostasis icons in the Church of the Holy Archdeacon Stefan in Sremska Mitrovica, are also attributed to him. Some of the historians point out the resemblance of Kračun's painting to the art of the great El Greco, which is characterized by the light-dark effects, vibrating movements and the interplay of draperies and the background. In Kračun's work, the elements or rocaille art are also present. He also painted portraits. His best work is the portrait of Archimandrite Jovan Jovanović of Novo Hopovo Monastery. According to the records of St. Nicholas Church in Sremski Karlovci, Kračun died on 10 April 1781.

Its student body derives from portions of Arvin, California and from the unincorporated, rural Di Giorgio, California. History Two versions of the campus exist: an old, discontinued building alongside a basketball court, and the modern 33 acre campus. The two are right across the street from one another. Prior to being named Di Giorgio, the campus consisting of the discontinued building (single room schoolhouse) carried the name of Rockpile School. Following the first years of operation, the school would close eight years after its opening due to low attendance rates. However, it would later open again. Enrollment would then \\"triple\\" during the 1930s. Following the burning of the original schoolhouse, agricultural entrepreneur Joseph Di Giorgio would donate $150,000 dollars and 40 acres of land on Christmas Eve, 1945. Rockpile school would then change its name to Di Giorgio School to honor the gift. Today, Di Giorgio Elementary School has an enrollment of approximately 220 students, taught by nine teachers, and supported by 22 staff members in total. Air monitoring station Controversy arose when the California Air Resources Board moved an air monitoring station to the school in November 2009, where, when compared with the original Bear Mountain site, had reportedly cleaner air. The original Bear Mountain monitor later shut down in late 2010, with the Di Giorgio school monitor becoming the board's sole monitor of Arvin's air. The findings prompted the Committee for a Better Arvin to allow residents to take matters in their own hands and implement a \\"bucket-brigade\\" system, which will be placed around critical parts of Arvin, providing a more thorough analysis of Arvin's air quality.

Twice every day the Jew recites the Shema Yisrael, which contains the words: \\"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might\\" (Deut. vi. 5). This verse is understood to enjoin him to willingly surrender life and fortune whenever the cause of God demands it, while it at the same time urges him to make God beloved by all his creatures through deeds of kindness, as Abraham did (Sifre, Deut. 32). Although only asked about the first commandment, Jesus included the second commandment in his answer. This double reference has given rise to differing views with regard to the relationship that exists between the two commandments, although typically \\"love thy God\\" is referred to as \\"the first and greatest commandment\\", with \\"love thy neighbour\\" being referred to as \\"the second great commandment\\". It may simply reflect the \\"seven rules (Middot) of Hillel\\", in this case the first one, called Ḳal wa-ḥomer (Hebrew: קל וחומר). Love thy neighbor as thyself When asked which is the greatest commandment, the Christian New Testament depicts Jesus paraphrasing the Torah: \\"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind,\\" before also paraphrasing a second passage; \\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\\" Most Christian denominations view these two commandments as, together, forming the core of the Christian religion.

The film stars William Campbell, Patrick Magee, and Luana Anders. It was released in the United States by American International Pictures during the fall of 1963 as the bottom half of a double feature with Corman's X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes. Although Coppola had been involved in at least two sexploitation films previously, Dementia 13 served as his first mainstream \\"legitimate\\" directorial effort. Corman offered Coppola the chance to direct a low-budget horror film in Ireland using funds left over from Corman's recently completed The Young Racers, on which Coppola had worked as a sound technician. The producer wanted a cheap Psycho copy, complete with gothic atmosphere and brutal killings, and Coppola quickly wrote a screenplay with Corman's requirements. Although he was given total directorial freedom during production, Coppola found himself at odds with Corman after the film was completed. The producer declared it unreleasable and demanded several changes be made. Corman eventually brought in another director, Jack Hill, to film additional sequences. The film's title appears on a theater marquee in the Coppola-produced film American Graffiti (1973), even though the film was set in 1962, before the theatrical release of Dementia 13. A remake by director Richard LeMay was released on October 6, 2017. Plot While out rowing in the middle of a lake after dark, John Haloran and his young wife Louise argue about his rich mother's will. Louise is upset that everything is currently designated to go to charity in the name of a mysterious \\"Kathleen.\\" The argument, combined with the exertion of rowing the boat, causes John to have a heart attack. He informs Louise that, should he die before his mother, Louise will receive none of the inheritance, after which he promptly dies. Thinking quickly, the scheming Louise dumps his fresh corpse over the boat's side, where it sinks to the bottom of the lake. Her plan is to pretend that he is still alive so that she can ingratiate her way into the will. She types up a letter to her mother-in-law, Lady Haloran, inviting herself to the family's castle in Ireland while her husband is \\"away on business.\\" Dementia 13 (full film) At the castle, she immediately notices that things are a little odd. John's two brothers, Billy, and Richard, take part in a bizarre, ritualistic ceremony with their mother, part of a yearly tribute to their deceased younger sister Kathleen, who died years before in a freak drowning accident. Lady Haloran still mourns for her daughter, and during the ceremony, she faints dead away as she does every year. As Louise helps her mother-in-law into the castle, Lady Haloran tells her that she fainted because one of the fresh flowers she had thrown died as it touched Kathleen's grave. Louise, realizing that Lady Haloran is emotionally overwrought and superstitious, devises a plan to convince the old woman that Kathleen is trying to communicate with her from beyond the grave. The plan involves stealing some of the dead girl's old toys and placing them at the bottom of the estate's pond, where they will float to the surface in a ghostly way during the middle of the day. That night, Louise swims underwater and begins placing the toys, as planned. She is shocked to see what appears to be Kathleen's perfectly preserved corpse at the bottom of the pond. Horrified, she surfaces and is abruptly attacked with an axe by an unknown assailant; her killer drags Louise's bloody corpse away. Concerned family doctor Justin Caleb arrives and becomes determined to solve the mystery. He intensely questions the family. The murderer, meanwhile, strikes again, decapitating a man named Simon, who has been poaching on the estate. Dr. Caleb has the pond drained, revealing a stone statue shrine, engraved with the words \\"Forgive Me, Kathleen.\\" The following night, Lady Haloran is attacked by a shadowy figure, but she eludes him and collapses in the castle's courtyard. Dr. Caleb finally uses an obscure nursery rhyme (\\"Fishy, fishy, in a brook, Daddy caught you on a hook\\"), recited by Billy under hypnosis, to help him discover Louise's frozen corpse hidden away in a meat locker. Next to the bloody body is a wax figure of Kathleen. Dr. Caleb places the figure in a public square to lure out the killer. Taking the bait, a gibbering Billy, who has gone insane with guilt over causing the death of his sister Kathleen, attempts to kill Richard's fiancée Kane with an axe. Dr. Caleb saves her life by shooting Billy to death with a pistol he was carrying in his pocket. Cast * William Campbell as Richard Haloran. Dementia 13 was one of several Roger Corman productions the veteran B-movie character actor appeared in, but it was the first that was completed on such a small budget. Coppola had convinced Campbell (and his The Young Racers co-star Patrick Magee) to appear in the film. The actor originally felt that it would turn out to be a strictly \\"amateur endeavor\\", but he soon became impressed by Coppola's leadership abilities, talent, and energy on the set. Campbell recalled years later, \\"There were all kinds of promises as to what he [Coppola] would do for me later. It was one of those 'I-owe-you-one' things, but he never did anything! I tried to get to him when he was doing The Godfather, thinking that a cop or gangster part might be good for about 17 weeks, but after Dementia 13, I was never able to get through to him again!\\"Campbell, William. Interviewed by Tim Lucas in Video Watchdog magazine, issue #4, pg. 48, from the article \\"The Trouble with TITIAN: Francis Ford Coppola's Lost Thriller\\" * Luana Anders as Louise Haloran. Anders' role as the scheming wife of a rich but prematurely dead heir to a fortune is one of the actress's most notable screen roles. Dementia 13 was one of several appearances that she made in AIP productions. Most of these films had been directed by Roger Corman, including a major role co-starring with Vincent Price in The Pit and the Pendulum (1961). Like Campbell and Patrick Magee, Anders had been borrowed by Coppola from the cast of Corman's just-completed film The Young Racers. After Dementia 13, Anders never had such a sizable role again, appearing in numerous small parts in both television and film until her death from breast cancer in 1996. * Patrick Magee as Dr. Justin Caleb. Magee's role as the family doctor who manages to solve the mystery in Dementia 13 was one of many horror film parts the Tony Award-winning actor accepted during the course of his distinguished career. He had just finished shooting Corman's The Young Racers when Coppola convinced him, along with his Racers co-stars Campbell and Anders, to appear in Coppola's debut feature. Years later, Campbell warmly remembered Magee as being a brilliant performer although a little prone to overacting. * Bart Patton as Billy Haloran * Mary Mitchel as Kane * Eithne Dunne as Lady Haloran * Peter Read as John Haloran * Karl Schnazer as Simon, the poacher * Ron Perry as Arthur * Derry O'Donovan as Lillian, the maid * Barbara Dowling as Kathleen Haloran Production Patrick Magee as Dr. Caleb and William Campbell as Richard Haloran Francis Ford Coppola worked as a sound man on Corman's The Young Racers (1963), a racing film which starred Campbell and Magee. That film was shot in several different countries, and after production was completed in Ireland, Corman still had $22,000 of the film's allocated $165,000 budget remaining. Corman originally thought of using the funds to direct a \\"quickie\\" film himself, but his schedule made this impractical. Instead, Corman suggested that Coppola remain in Ireland with a small crew and direct a low- budget horror film, to be produced by Corman.Lucas, Tim. Video Watchdog magazine, issue #4, pg. 48, from the article \\"The Trouble with TITIAN: Francis Ford Coppola's Lost Thriller\\" Coppola later recalled, \\"Roger wanted to make Dementia 13 cheaply. He wanted it to be homicidal, sort of a copy of Psycho. You know, gothic and psychological, with some kind of terrible knife-killing scene thrown in. So I wrote the script to order\\".DiFranco, J. Philip. The Movie World of Roger Corman, Chelsea House Publishers, 1979. Coppola wrote a brief draft story idea in one night. The next morning, he described to Corman the most vividly detailed sequence: a half-naked woman ties several dolls to the bottom of a lake, then surfaces to find herself at the feet of an axe murder: \\"axed to death!\\", Coppola exclaimed. Corman was impressed enough to immediately provide Coppola with the $22,000 for the film. The young director was able to arrange an additional $20,000 in financing himself by pre-selling the European rights to a producer named Raymond Stross.McGee, Mark Thomas. Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland & Company, Inc., 1996. Coppola did not inform Corman of the production's additional funding ... and quickly moved the initial $22,000 into a bank account in case an angry Corman ever attempted to reclaim his original investment.Goodwin, Michael and Wise, Naomi. On the Edge: The Life & Times of Francis Ford Coppola, William Morrow & Co,, 1989. Coppola's friend Al Locatelli served as the film's art director and helped Coppola write the final script in three days, uncredited. The speed at which the screenplay was completed resulted in unrealistic, “stilted” dialogue that Campbell recalled as being very difficult for the actors to speak.Campbell, William. Dementia 13 DVD, The Roan Group/Troma Entertainment, 2001, audio commentary. The majority of the American actors in the cast were friends of Coppola's from UCLA, and many of them paid their own way to Ireland for the opportunity to appear in a film. Most of the Irish cast members were from the Abbey Theatre and were paid strictly minimum wage salaries. Eithne Dunne received approximately $600 for her performance. The cast and crew lived together in a farm house located outside of Dublin. Howth Castle, located in the Dublin suburb of Howth, depicted the fictitious \\"Castle Haloran\\" in the film. During filming, Coppola kept Corman updated on the status of the production in letters that promised much sex and violence would appear in the film, \\"enough to make people sick\\". Coppola was left entirely on his own while directing the film, without interference of any kind from Corman. When the completed film was shown to him, Corman stormed out of the screening room and demanded that several changes be made, changes that Coppola did not agree with. According to Coppola, Corman \\"insisted on dubbing the picture the way he wanted it, adding voiceovers to simplify some of the scenes. Worse, he wanted extra violence added, another axe murder at least...\\" Jack Hill was later hired by Corman to shoot some brief sequences featuring actor Karl Schanzer as a comical poacher, who is beheaded by the murderer. Corman also complained the film was too short and insisted that it be padded out with at least another five minutes of footage. Gary Kurtz, one of Corman's assistants at the time, recalled, \\"So we shot this stupid prologue that had nothing to do with the rest of the film. It was some guy who was supposed to be a psychiatrist, sitting in his office and giving the audience a test to see if they were mentally fit to see the picture. The film was actually released with that prologue\\".Naha, Ed. The Films of Roger Corman: Brilliance on a Budget, Arco Publishing Inc., 1982. The prologue was directed by Monte Hellman. This cheap William Castle-style gimmick also included a \\"D-13 Test\\" handout that was given to theater patrons. It was devised by a supposed \\"medical expert\\" to weed out psychologically unfit people from viewing the film. The test consisted of such questions as, \\"The most effective way of settling a dispute is with one quick stroke of an axe to your adversary's head?\\" and \\"Have you ever been hospitalized in a locked mental ward, sanitarium, rest home or other facility for the treatment of mental illness?\\" \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" were the only possible answers. The rockabilly song that is played during the film's opening is \\"He's Caught\\" by Buddy and The Fads, written by Arthur \\"Buddy\\" Fowler. The song was recorded in 1959 in Hollywood, CA. for Accent Records. Release=Home media The Roan Group released the film on LaserDisc and DVD, both of which included an audio commentary by Campbell. The DVD also featured the original \\"D-13 Test\\" in digital form as an extra; the film's five-minute added prologue, which featured the test, has not been included on any of the film's numerous home video releases. Dementia 13 was released on Blu-ray April 26, 2011.Dementia 13 Press Release Reception The film was released in the fall of 1963 as the bottom half of a double bill with Corman's X: The Man with the X-ray Eyes. Because of its rushed production and a somewhat incomprehensible screenplay, reviews of Dementia 13 have been mixed: The New York Times dismissed the film: \\"Under the stolid direction of Francis Coppola, who also wrote the script, the picture stresses gore rather than atmosphere and all but buries a fairly workable plot\\". Michael Weldon, in The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film, noted it had \\"[A] great trick ending, some truly shocking, gory axe murders, and lots of inventive photography\\".Weldon, Michael. The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film, Ballantine Books, 1983. Tom Raynes, in the Time Out Film Guide, said \\"The location (an Irish castle) is used imaginatively; the Gothic atmosphere is suitably potent, and there's a wonderfully sharp cameo from Patrick Magee\\". Danny Peary, in his Guide for the Film Fanatic, stated that \\"despite the hopelessly confusing storyline ... the horror sequences are very exciting\\".Peary, Danny. Guide for the Film Fanatic, Simon & Schuster, 1986. Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror opined, \\"[O]ne senses the presence of a director right from the moody opening sequence ... A piece of high gothic melodrama ... The weakness of the film is in the script, which gives every indication of having been bundled together at the last minute\\"...Hardy, Phil (editor). The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror, Aurum Press, 1984. Reprinted as The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Horror, Overlook Press, 1995, John Charles, in Video Watchdog, wrote that the film was \\"a remarkably confident and proficient thriller. Several of its components hint at the creativity that was still to come from Coppola ... and the finished product is a testament to his ingenuity\\".Charles, John. Video Watchdog magazine, issue #37, pgs. 54 - 56. Review of Dementia 13 laserdisc Kim Newman opined, \\"Coppola ... works fast and creative in Dementia 13... making memorable, shocking little sequences out of the killings and the implied haunting, using his locations well and highlighting unexpected eeriness like a transistor radio burbling distorted pop music as it sinks into a lake, along with a just-murdered corpse\\". At the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Dementia 13 has a 65% favorable rating out of 23 reviewers surveyed.

Background In February 1999, the Ontario Provincial Police received a tip that Walter Tessling was running a marijuana grow operation. In the course of the investigation, the police checked with Ontario Hydro for significant amounts of electricity usage, often indicative of a grow operation, on Tessling's property. Failing to find any unusual power usage, the police then attempted a visual surveillance of the residence, which also failed to show anything unusual. The police then opted to use an infra-red heat-sensor to detect any amounts of heat upon his property that would suggest a grow operation. Without any warrant, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) flew over Tessling's property with a Forward Looking Infra-Red (\\"FLIR\\") camera and got a heat profile of the land. Using the results of the FLIR profile and other evidence, the police were able to establish a reasonable and probable grounds that there was a grow operation on Tessling's property which allowed them to get a search warrant to search the property. The police searched the property and found the marijuana growing operation that was estimated at $15,000 to $22,500. Tessling was charged with drug trafficking and possession of weapons. At trial, Tessling argued that the FLIR scan was a violation of his right against unreasonable search and seizure, and that the evidence should be excluded from trial. Tessling was convicted however his conviction was overturned by the provincial Court of Appeal. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the use of a thermal imagery such as the FLIR camera violates the right against unreasonable search and seizure. The Court held that the thermal imagery did not violate the accuser’s right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, with Iacobucci and Arbour JJ abstaining.

As might be expected, the hall was principally noted for evangelistic meetings, orchestral, choral and vocal concerts, operas and brass band competitions. There were also minstrel and variety shows, magic lantern and from 1896 moving picture shows. By 1919 it had a proscenium stage and about that time it became a more or less regular picture house with occasional variety, but it was subsequently steadily overtaken by purpose-built cinemas. The Albert Hall was gutted by fire in 1937 and demolished some years later. Terraced properties and shops which once occupied one side of the square were demolished in 1912 to make way for The Regent Cinema which opened the following year. The Regent Cinema continued at the same site, later to become the Gaumont (this has also since been demolished). Other terraced properties and shops at the other side of the square were demolished around 1923 to make way for the construction of the Sheffield City Hall, which opened in 1932. In 1925 a memorial was built to commemorate those fallen in the First World War. Public Art Research Archive The Sheffield War Memorial was located on a traffic island in the middle of the road running across the front of the City Hall. Pedestrianisation In 1989 the road in front of the City Hall was closed to motor traffic and the area was made a permanently pedestrianised area.Rupert Harris Conservation who restored the memorial In 2005 the square was renovated and relaid in Yorkshire stone. Two glass-cased fountains (Chap Fountains) were installed outside the City Hall; these are illuminated at night, and several seated areas are also illuminated in colours that match the ground lighting of the nearby Millennium Square. The renovation won Gold in the 2006 Town Centre Environment Awards,info in BCSC award from Sheffield City Council website run by the BCSC, held on 7 November 2006 in Manchester. Barkers Pool was one of two projects in Sheffield City Centre to be nominated, the other being the Station gateway at Howard Street. Women of Steel statue The Women of Steel statue, is located where Barker's Pool meets Holly Street, directly to the left of the City Hall entrance steps. The statue was commissioned by Sheffield City Council in 2016 and was created by sculptor, Martin Jennings. The statue commemorates the women of Sheffield who worked in the city's steel factories during the First World War and Second World War.

Carey has released six albums under the Planet P Project name: Planet P (1983, later retitled Planet P Project), Pink World (1984), Go Out Dancing, Part I (1931) (2005), Go Out Dancing, Part II (Levittown) (2008), Go Out Dancing, Part III (Out in the Rain) (2009) and Steeltown (2013). Music videos for singles from the first albums received heavy to moderate airplay on MTV, when originally released. Pink World was originally a two-record set, released on bright-pink- colored vinyl. Planet P's most well known singles were \\"Why Me?\\" (a sweeping, energetic romp about outer space and isolation), and the downbeat \\"Static\\". Go Out Dancing, Part I (1931) is the first of the trilogy, with part two titled Go Out Dancing, Part II (Levittown) and part three as Go Out Dancing, Part III (Out in the Rain). The project's name was inspired from the fictional \\"Planet P\\" in Robert A. Heinlein's book Starship Troopers. History \\"Planet P Project\\" is a pseudonym used by rock musician Tony Carey to distinguish his more progressive and experimental music from his pop-oriented rock releases. Tony Carey before Planet P Project Tony Carey signed his first recording contract in the early 1970s with his band Blessings, though the band never finished recording an album. Carey successfully auditioned as the keyboardist for Ritchie Blackmore's band Rainbow and played with the band for two years. He recorded one studio album with Rainbow, the highly acclaimed Rising, and live concert material from two world tours was subsequently released as two double LPs and a six-disc CD box set. Carey left Rainbow in 1977 and moved to Germany in 1978. He co-owned Hotline recording studio in Frankfurt, West Germany, with producer Peter Hauke, and he spent many hours over the next five years with his friend and recording engineer Nigel Jopson, recording as he wanted, often working twenty-hour days. As Carey states, he suffered the consequences of excessive drug use during this period. He recorded all of his early albums at that studio. He released his first solo album, In the Absence of the Cat, in 1982, on the indie label X-Records. Carey released his second solo album, I Won't Be Home Tonight, on the Rocshire label in 1982, along with the single (and music video) \\"West Coast Summer Nights\\". The title track was also released as a single. 1983: Planet P Project Carey was signed to Geffen Records for his third solo album (later to be released as Some Tough City), but he had a great deal of music written that didn't fit the style of that album. He was able to sign a second record deal with Geffen to record and release that material under the Planet P Project pseudonym. He released his first album under the name Planet P Project in 1983, called Planet P Project (originally titled Planet P). Planet P Project received modest reviews (e.g., ref and). The album, however, contained the more highly acclaimed song \\"Why Me\\", which was released as Planet P Project's first popular single, reaching #64 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and #4 in the magazine's Top Rock Tracks chart. According to Carey, the video for \\"Why Me\\" made a \\"slight impact on early MTV.\\" Tom Demalon, writing for MTV, was less modest: :With heavy exposure of the accompanying video on MTV, the single \\"Why Me?\\" clicked at album rock outlets, climbing into the Top Ten while it also managed to crossover over onto the pop charts. \\"Why Me\\" was described in Billboard by Cincinnati'shttp://webn.iheart.com/ WEBN-FM program director, Denton Marr, as \\"unusual, eclectic, and very entertaining.\\" The song was one of 30 songs to be included in the 1995 MTV compilation album MTV Class of 1983. Two other, lesser-known songs on the album which received some airplay were \\"King for a Day\\" (which preceded \\"Why Me?\\" in release) and \\"Power Tools\\". 1984: Pink World In 1983 and 1984, Carey recorded his third solo album, Some Tough City, and his second Planet P Project album, Pink World. A dispute with the label arose when, according to Carey, Geffen's representative was not satisfied with the lyrics to \\"A Fine, Fine Day\\" and \\"The First Day of Summer\\", both of which would later be released as singles, from the album Some Tough City, and Carey refused to rewrite them. The Pink World album was recorded with minimal input from Geffen, and the finished product was not well received by the label. Carey had this to say about the response from Geffen: :I delivered Pink World [to Geffen], and the shit REALLY hit the fan. Some of the comments that filtered back to me were \\"unreleasable\\" and \\"this kid's crazy.\\" And some bad ones, too. Long story short, I got traded like a baseball player to MCA Records, which went ahead and released both of these records. In late 1984 MCA released Planet P Project's double LP rock opera, Pink World, which peaked at #121 on The Billboard 200. The single \\"What I See\\" reached #25 on Billboard's Top Rock Tracks. Both the double LP and the single were released on pink vinyl. A single music video, titled Pink World (though the song \\"Pink World was not included in the video), which featured two songs from the Pink World album, \\"What I See\\" and \\"Behind the Barrier\\", was released on MTV and remained in power rotation or active rotation for ten weeks on the network. 21-year hiatus and return of Planet P Project Given the relative success of Some Tough City, Carey focused his attention on recordings to be released under his own name. However, after a 21-year hiatus, Carey resurrected the Planet P Project name for a trilogy of albums collectively called Go Out Dancing (G.O.D.). The albums were 1931 (2005), Levittown (2008), and Out In The Rain (2009). After officially dismantling \\"Planet P Project\\" in 2009 with the 3rd & final part to the \\"G. O. D.\\" trilogy, \\"Out In The Rain\\", Carey again revived the project with the release of \\"Steeltown\\" in 2013, this time merging his solo career name with the project's name (\\"Tony Carey's Planet P Project\\"). \\"Steeltown\\" is based on Norway & its history, after Carey played and travelled there extensively, both as a solo artist, and with a band consisting of mostly Norwegian musicians. Influenced by the occupation years of World War II and the way Norway as a nation handled this, the work is also a statement about the eternal religious conflicts world wide. In 2013, Carey announced plans to tour with \\"Tony Carey's Planet P Project\\" in the near future. In 2014 a box set of the three Go Out Dancing CD's was released, 'the G.O.D.B.O.X.', which included an earlier bootleg of promotional recordings for the project.

Sweed (January 23, 1949 – April 1, 2019) was an American entertainer and author, known for his late-night television horror host character \\"The Ghoul\\". Early life and career Sweed was born on January 23, 1949 in Euclid, Ohio. His mother is Irene Barnard. His father was Robert Sweed. He grew up in Cleveland. In an interview with his mother, Metro Times reporter Anita Schmaltz asked, \\"Did you ever expect to give birth to a Ghoul?\\" She responded, \\"Ron was very different right from the time he came out of the chute.\\" Sweed was 3 or 4 when he went to downtown Cleveland with his grandfather to see Santa Claus and buy him a Christmas present. He picked out a puppet. When Sweed was 8 or 9, he was given marionettes. Sweed would put on shows for the neighborhood kids with the marionettes. His fourth grade teacher at one time could not keep his attention. Every Wednesday Sweed would put on a show for the class with his Jerry Mahoney dummy. In 1963, 13-year-old Sweed and his friends went to an afternoon matinee of “Dr. Silkini and his live stage show of horrors, on stage in person, the Frankenstein monster, Dracula, King Kong and 45 horror movies”. On the way home, he found a gorilla suit in an open trunk of Silkini's. He wore the gorilla suit to a live appearance by Ghoulardi, a popular Cleveland television personality played by Ernie Anderson on WJW. Ghoulardi took note of the costume and brought Sweed on stage, and over the next few weeks, Sweed became Anderson's production assistant. After Anderson left Cleveland for Los Angeles in 1966, Sweed left for Bowling Green State University, but continued to help with the production of the Hoolihan and Big Chuck show, which was Ghoulardi's replacement on WJW.Sweed interview - Utter Trash.net The Ghoul Show In 1970, Sweed approached Ernie Anderson with a proposal to revive Anderson's \\"Ghoulardi\\" character. Anderson was not interested, but gave Sweed his blessing to revive the character on his own. With that blessing, Sweed took \\"The Ghoul\\" to Cleveland's Kaiser Broadcasting station WKBF-TV in 1971.Introduction at www.ghoulfinger.com, first paragraph Though it started as a tribute to Ghoulardi, Sweed soon developed his own eye- catching gags and energetic style. Known for his zany, early-adolescent humor (particularly surrounding his abuse of a rubber frog named \\"Froggy,\\" his well- known penchant for blowing up model ships and aircraft with firecrackers, and his habitual smearing of Cheez Whiz over everything in sight), late night monster movies were a unique experience for Cleveland viewers in the 1970s.Ghoul profile - Non-Productive.com Catch phrases included \\"zingy-zingy,\\" \\"Overdey!\\" and \\"stay sick, turn blue\\". The Ghoul would typically take an unbelievably bad horror movie and dump in sound bites at appropriate moments, using audio clips from novelty records, George Carlin, Firesign Theater and rock albums of the '60s and early '70s. And whenever a character took a drink of something on-screen, The Ghoul would supply a good, loud belch.NE Ohio movie hosts - Retro Junk.com \\"Shooting from no-budget studio sets, the Ghoul inserted his own dialogue and sound effects over insufferably bad B movies, blew up food, model cars and figurines with firecrackers, and produced strangely compelling, culturally relevant skits and parodies. The show was destructive and childish enough for little kids, subversive and timely enough for young adults.\\" Later in the 1970s, Kaiser Broadcasting syndicated The Ghoul Show to Detroit, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Los Angeles. It bombed in Chicago (where Sweed had the thankless task of replacing the popular Svengoolie) and in Boston, but was huge in Detroit at WKBD TV-50, and enjoyed varying degrees of success in the other markets. Despite the show's popularity, Kaiser eventually canceled it in 1975 amid complaints from parents about the content of some of Sweed's skits, as well as the permanent closure of WKBF by Kaiser itself. But The Ghoul resurfaced in 1976 on independent Detroit station WXON TV-20, and on WKBF's successor station, WCLQ TV-61. Meanwhile, Kaiser Broadcasting 's successor, Field Communications bought back Horror Film Features by airing Son of Svengoolie on Chicago's WFLD on June 16, 1979. As a result, Sweed never appeared on air in Chicago again. Sweed was on and off the air in Cleveland and Detroit for over three decades, at times even branching out into radio and the internet.Introduction at www.ghoulfinger.com, second paragraph The Ghoul returned to Cleveland TV in 1998 on WBNX-TV Channel 55 where he remained for the next six years airing on Friday, then later Sunday nights. He also did a Saturday night request show on classic rock station WNCX FM 98.5 during the same time period. The same year, Sweed co-authored (with Mike Olszewski) ' (), a book collecting memories, on- set photographs, transcripts, correspondence, and memos from his years on the air. Said Robert St Mary, a Detroit journalist and author of The Orbit Magazine Anthology: Re-Entry: “Ron understood that times had changed from the beatnik version of Ernie. It was spectacle. It was blowing stuff up. He was using the crazy hip lingo that Ernie had, and tweaking it a bit more.” In 2015, Sweed appeared at the Redford Theatre. It would be his final appearance there as he was scheduled to perform there in October 2018, but due to health problems, it was canceled. In an October 2017 interview with Metro Times Jarrett Koral, he stated how he gets ready for a show: \\"smoke a good kielbasa,\\" further remarking that \\"smoking a kielbasa will take you to places Steppenwolf never imagined on his magic carpet ride.\\" For a boost of instant insanity? \\"Snort a couple blobs of Cheez Whiz.\\" Influence The Ghoul was well known enough in the Cleveland and Detroit markets that some of his catch phrases (\\"Overdey!\\", \\"Hey group!\\", \\"Scratch glass, turn blue\\", \\"Stay sick, climb walls\\", \\"Pluck your magic twanger, Froggy!\\", \\"Holy Parma\\", \\"Amrap\\" and Froggy's \\"Hiya gang, hiya hiya hiya!\\") are still widely recognized among the children of the 1970s. An interesting side element is that the aforementioned rubber toy referred to simply as \\"Froggy\\" (and much abused by the Ghoul) was a toy dating from 1948 by a company named Rempel and featured often in comedic skits on the 1955 television show Andy's Gang where he was named Froggy the Gremlin. The Ghoul's oft-uttered catch phrases \\"Hiya, gang. Hiya, hiya, hiya\\" and \\"Pluck your magic twanger, Froggy\\" originate from that earlier show. Awards and honors On March 5, 2016, Sweed was presented with a Certificate of Recognition by Cleveland mayor Frank G. Jackson to commemorate the 45th anniversary of his debut on Cleveland TV, and to honor his continuing popularity in the city. Lawsuit Sweed sued Keven Scarpino, a.k.a. the Son of Ghoul, in 1987 for infringing upon The Ghoul's character, but eventually lost the case. The judge ruled that no infringement occurred, as most horror show hosts portrayed the same basic character - a ghoulish individual who pranced about in costume, performed comedy routines, and showed horror movies.Son of Ghoul - Utter Trash.com Personal life and death Sweed met his first wife, Barbara J. King, when she was 17, and she was 18 when they married. They were married for 14 years. King and Sweed remained friends. He met Mary Therese Matousek in 1988. Sweed later married Matousek around 1993 as they were married for 26 years. Sweed died on April 1, 2019, five months after suffering a massive heart attack. He had undergone triple bypass surgery on November 7, 2018.

An experienced glazer will apply the putty by hand, and then smooth it with the knife. Modern insulated glazing may use other ways of securing the glass to the window frame. A spackle knife (called a scraper in British English, also known as a spatula in American English) is also commonly called a \\"putty knife\\", and is used for scraping surfaces or spreading material such as plaster in various construction trades. Widths from 1\\" to 5\\" or 6\\" are commonly available. Wider- bladed knives up to about 12\\" are used for sheet rocking. Larger blades are made, but generally lack the stability of the smaller blades and do not make a perfectly flat surface. Stiff-blade knives, typically 1 mm or .040\\" thick, are suitable for scraping. Flexible-blade knives, typically 0.5 mm or .020\\" thick, are suitable for spreading. Due to the conductive nature of metallic blades, they should be kept a safe distance from extreme heat and electrical components. Disposable putty knives, known for having a recyclable straight handle and blade, are suitable for hundreds of home and workplace chores, such as gently removing decals, water sealing a small crack or filling a chipped walk to avoid slips and falls. Plastic putty knives are sometimes substituted for metallic ones because they are resistant to electrical shock. However, disposable putty knives can be damaged from extreme heat, and should be kept a safe distance from furnaces, stoves, hot water heaters, and other high heat sources. Thinning solvents and degreasers in certain oven cleaners and lacquers may weaken various putty knives and are not recommended for combined use.

The school was founded in 1937 by Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik and his wife Tonya Soloveitchik. It is named after Rabbi Moses Maimonides. Today, Maimonides is a Torah institution with approximately 550 students from early childhood (2-4 years) through grade twelve with over 2,000 alumni, including multiple Rhodes Scholars, National Merit Scholars, prominent professors, scientists and business leaders. More than 325 of them are living in Israel. Student body Most Maimonides Students reside in Newton (40%), Brookline (22%), and the Sharon area (Sharon, Stoughton, Canton, Malden [21%]). As of 2020, Maimonides has 3 students in Rhode Island. Other areas include Watertown, Natick, Needham, Boston, Cambridge, Westborough, Melrose, Waltham, and Bedford. Occasionally, a student from a distant state or European country joins the student body, after making independent boarding arrangements. Each year several Israelis whose families are temporarily studying or working in Greater Boston join the student body. Students from several feeder day schools augment the student population at transition points such as Grade 6 or 9. Campus Maimonides School currently is situated on a campus in central Brookline, and is housed in one building. Saval Campus The Saval campus, named after Maurice Saval, a longtime school Chairman and benefactor, includes the Elementary School (kindergarten through grade five), Middle School (grades six through eight), Upper School (grades nine through twelve), business office, and other administrative offices. Other features of the Saval campus are the Judge J. John Fox gymnasium, S. Joseph Solomont Synagogue, 22,000 volume Levy library and Beit Midrash (house of religious Judaic study), laboratories, a student lounge, and additional office and study space. The inner courtyard includes a SprinTurf playing surface -- the Ezra Schwartz Field -- for outdoor play. The Esther Edelman Learning Center has undergone a cosmetic upgrade with new furniture, computers, air-conditioning and thermal pane windows. The Middle School level includes the Study Zone, a nurse's office, an art room, a science lab and a social worker's office. Brener building Between 1998-2019, the elementary school was housed in the Brener building, which is across the street from the Saval building, where the Elementary School had formerly been. In addition to classrooms, the building contained a lunchroom, small gym, admissions office, and library. Grades E2 - 5 also had their own playground for recess. The Brener building is named for Leonard Brener, noted philanthropist (to Maimonides and the Perkins School for the Blind among other worthy educational causes). A decorated detective with the Boston Police Department, Mr. Brener was known affectionately as 'Brennan' to his (mostly Irish) coworkers. After his retirement from law enforcement, he became a financial advisor, achieving the rank of Senior Vice President with Dean Whitter Reynolds. In addition to the Brener building itself, Mr. Brener donated the art room on the Saval campus in memory of his sister. Nearing the end of the 2018-2019 school year, it was announced that due to decreased enrollment and a tighter budget, the following year the Elementary School would be moving back into the Saval building. Brookline Public Schools currently rent out the Brener building. The Maimonides preschool, however, is currently located at a nearby synagogue, Congregation Beth El.

The 2008 game was particularly exciting, as the seniors raced back from a large deficit to tie and win the game in the last few minutes. In 2009 the faculty won the game for the first time, only to lose again by one point in 2010. In 2011 the game was an easy win for the seniors, but the faculty won again in 2012 and 2013. The faculty won in 2017. In an incredibly close game in 2018, the seniors beat the faculty. =Faculty Matball Game= This game is a relatively new tradition that matches the female members of the senior class against the female faculty in a game of matball. This tradition began in 2017, with the students winning the game by a large margin. The match did not take place in 2018. Major school events=Annual Gala Discontinued in 2012 Chanukah Chagiga Every Chanukah, the Student Council and student activities director plan an upper school black-tie banquet/chagiga. Each year's banquet has a different theme, which is expressed through decor and furnishings. The upper school jazz band performs before and during the festive catered meal and there is generally some other form of live entertainment afterwards. Magicians, hypnotists, Blue Fringe, and Hello Sid have performed in the past. Many students choose to invite friends from other schools, transforming the banquet into an annual gathering of the local high school Jewish community. Student chessed leaders typically run chessed (charity) drives throughout the year and run a Toy Drive in memory of beloved English teacher Sharon Steiff and beloved parent Judy Epstein during the holiday season. The leaders often coordinate with the administration for students to pay reduced admission to the chaggiga when they bring a toy for the Toy Drive. Upper School plays A scene from the Drama Club's 2006 production, Lend Me A Tenor, by Ken Ludwig. The drama production is performed once a year by the Maimonides Drama Club, generally in mid-March, in the Fox gymnasium. It is directed and acted by students exclusively with no financial assistance from the school. Past plays: * The Glass Menagerie - 2018- directed by * The Importance of Being Ernest - 2017- directed by * The 39 Steps by Patrick Barlow - 2013- Directed by Joseph Ehrenkranz and Etai Shuchatowitz * Twelfth Night by William Shakespeare - 2012- Directed by Eitan Kahn * Awkward 2011, an original play written and directed by Naftali Ehrenkranz * Flip 2010- Directed by Stephanie Guedalia * Lost in Yonkers by Neil Simon - 2009- Directed by Jesse Turk * The Mousetrap by Agatha Christie - 2008- Directed by Davida Wolfson * The Children's Hour by Lillian Hellman - 2007- Directed by Doron Bloomfield * Lend Me a Tenor by Ken Ludwig - 2006- Directed by Ross Eisenberg * Noises Off by Michael Frayn - 2005 * Rumors by Neil Simon - 2004 * The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) by the Reduced Shakespeare Company - 2003 Directed by Chanan Berkovits * A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare Don't Drink the Water (1995) Directed by Eliav Bock The Man who Came to Dinner (1994) Directed by Avi Weiss Arsenic and Old Lace (1993) Directed by David Galper * The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde - 1985 * Arsenic and Old Lace by Joseph Kesselring - 1984 In 2006, the school Drama Club introduced the Secondary play (renamed The S.P.O.T.Y, or The Second Play Of The Year), a short play directed by the next year's producer of the Primary production. The one-acts, which are considerably shorter and of lower budget than the main production, bring drama to students who have no prior experience acting, or who cannot commit the time to the full-length play. Past short plays: *Sorry, Wrong Number by Lucille Fletcher -Directed by Stephanie Guedalia 2009 *Plaza Suite by Neil Simon - Directed by Jesse Turk 2008 (only the third act) *Act III, Scene V by Terry Ortwein - Directed by Jessica Kasmer-Jacobs 2007 *The Actor's Nightmare by Christopher Durang - Directed by Doron Bloomfield 2006 Purim Shpiel Each year the Shpiel is performed by the Senior Class as a series of comedy skits with the intent of poking fun at faculty members. Shpiels have traditionally featured only stage performances, but recent spiels include multimedia comedy. The Purim Shpiel is an annual source of tension between administrators, who review drafts for defamatory and unsavory material, and students, who often sneak in inappropriate material. The Purim Shpiel was shut down mid- performance by the faculty in 1996 and 2006. In light of certain teachers taking particular offense to the 2009 Shpiel, though it was reviewed by the administration, the administration took further precautionary measures and watched a full run-through of the 2010 shpiel before granting full approval. The 2012 Shpiel ended in a suspension for one of the students. The 2013 Shpiel involved controversy over content that was barred by the administrators and inappropriate distribution of censored material. The 2014 shpiel, though initially canceled by the administration due to worry about inappropriate content may be re instituted due to student complaints. Chagigat HaSiddur The Chagigat HaSiddur is an annual event, commonly known as the \\"Siddur Play\\", where the 1st graders receive their first siddur (prayerbook). Before the Chagigah they pray from either abbreviated siddurim or siddurim owned by the school. Afterwards they pray each day from their very own complete siddur. At the Chagigah, each 1st grade class performs a musical skit that addresses some aspect of prayer. The ceremony concludes with the teachers and principals calling up each student individually to receive his or her inscribed and specially bound siddur. The event is looked forward to with great anticipation by the students and their families, and usually ends with a festive party for the students and community. Chagigat HaChumash The Chagigat HaChumash is an annual event where the second grade students receive their first chumash (Bible). At the Chagigah, each 2nd grade class performs a musical skit that addresses some aspect of Torah learning. The ceremony concludes with the teachers and principals calling up each student individually to receive his or her inscribed and specially bound Chumash. After the students receive their Chumashim, everyone enjoys light refreshments. The students start learning from their new Chumashim after parshat Lech Lechah. Chesed Day (Also known as Yom Chesed) For the past few years, the Upper School Chesed (charity) Committee, with assistance from the student activities director, has organized a day when the entire middle and upper school student body leave school for a day and volunteer at different area community service destinations. Past recipients have included the Blue Hills, Pine Street Inn, the Esplanade Association, the Coolidge House nursing home, the Department of Conservation and Recreation, Greater Boston Food Bank, Hebrew Rehabilitation Center, Rosie's Place, Cradles to Crayons, The Franklin Park Zoo and the New England Veterans Shelter. Currently, in order to make planning of Chesed Day easier, each grade has its own Chesed Day. Battle of the Bands Every holiday of Sukkot (Festival of Tabernacles), the school holds a Battle of the Bands. Bands typically form for the sole purpose of competing in Battle of the Bands. The competition is generally made up of rock, jazz, and blues bands, though there has been music of other genres. The method of choosing a winner varies year to year from student voting to faculty judges. Past champions include two-time winner Brown Iris and One Fish, Jew Fish. For the first time in Maimonides history, in the 2008 Battle of the Bands, a 7th grade band (\\"Etai and the Others\\") won, beating four other bands including Brown Iris. Color War and MaccabiaColor War= Color War takes place annually in the Elementary School. Teams are led by 5th grade captains, who coordinate the action as their teammates compose songs and cheers, make a poster, write a D'var Torah, perform skits and motivate their teammates to win. =Maccabia= The Maccabia is a series of sporting events that takes place every few years in grades seven through twelve. Generally organized by the Student Council, it is led by two captains from each class. Upper school Maccabia took place in 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. Controversies=Finances and governance In late 2005, the school faced mounting budget deficits. To help alleviate the deficit, the School's Board of Directors initiated cost-cutting, layoffs, and an extraordinary fund- raising effort. The school successfully balanced its budget for 2006–07 and seemed to have achieved that with which most Jewish Day Schools continually struggle—correcting financial course without severely damaging enrollment or the quality of its education. At the same time, the school's governance structure changed. Formerly managed by a 7-member school committee, the school was now governed by a new board and a new board chair, Timberland CEO Jeff Swartz. The school committee became much smaller (3 members) and supervised only one person, the school's Rosh Yeshiva. After the cost-cutting measures, the school was sued for age and gender discrimination by three of the laid-off teachers. On July 3, 2009, The Jewish Advocate reported on the outcome of the Deborah Onie case: \\"The court found, however, that the reason the school gave for not renewing the contract was non-discriminatory, as it related only to her refusal to accept the authority of [principals] Klammer and Posner. In 2005, Onie brought the allegation of age discrimination to the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, the state's chief civil rights agency, which was unable to conclude that there was a violation of statutes.\\" The Evelyn Berman and Phyllis Schwartz cases were settled out of court. According to varying news reports, the private Maurice Saval trust, whose sole beneficiary is the school, lost between three and eight million dollars due to the Bernard Madoff scandal. In April 2009, the school did not renew several teacher contracts due to the financial crisis caused by the Madoff scam, and to increased demand for financial aid caused by the recession. The school also raised tuition 9.9% to meet rising expenses, its highest increase. Additional teacher layoffs occurred in the spring of 2010 due to a decline in enrollment in the elementary and upper school divisions. Class sizes were increased and the number of high school sections was decreased. With these decreases in the number of faculty came an increase in the size of the administration. In 2009, Barry Ehrlich, a former NH high school history teacher and Head of NYU's school for children with Asperger's Syndrome was hired as the school's K-12 Director of Curriculum. In 2010, the administration was expanded again with the hiring of a high school assistant principal, Rabbi Dov Huff, an alumnus. The school announced on May 6, 2018 that for the 2019 - 2020 school year that they plan on renting out the Brener building and consolidating all of the school into the Saval building in order to further reduce expenses.

More recently it was brought back by the Fifth Grade Chorus at the 2010 Maimonides Gala. It is sung to \\"Ode to Joy\\" from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. It was written by Ralph Tucker, an English teacher in the early years of the school. The following text is taken from the 1965 yearbook. > Praise to thee our alma mater; > Hail to thee Maimonides; > Homage at this time we pay thee > Whom we laud for all of these: > > For the wisdom of the Torah, > For our training secular, > For the light of learning shining > Bright before us like a star. > > Guide us in our way of living; > Teach us as the torch we seize > Values true and everlasting, > Hail to thee, Maimonides. In addition, there is a Hebrew version of the song.

A film adaptation of the book was released in 2002. The title comes from a line attributed to studio head Darryl F. Zanuck, who was defending Evans after some of the actors involved in the film The Sun Also Rises (1957) had recommended he be removed from the cast. The film adaptation was directed by Nanette Burstein and Brett Morgen and released by USA Films. It was screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. Synopsis=Book The book chronicles Evans' rise from childhood to radio star to film star to production chief of Paramount Pictures to independent producer, his marriage to Ali MacGraw, his downfall including his 1980 cocaine bust and implication in the murder of Roy Radin, aka \\"The Cotton Club Murder\\", his banishment from Paramount Pictures, and his return to the studio in the early 1990s. The audiobook version was read by Evans himself, with (presumably impromptu) additions. A revised edition of the book, published in 1995, adds several chapters of new material, including material on his projects after his return to Paramount Pictures. Film The film version, released in 2002, utilizes Evans' narration interspersed mostly with photographs from Evans' life as well as brief film footage from films such as Love Story, The Sun Also Rises, Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, and The Godfather, along with interviews to tell the story from his discovery by Norma Shearer for Man of a Thousand Faces (1957) to his return to Paramount Pictures. According to the commentary by directors Burstein and Morgen on the DVD, many elements from the book, such as Evans' childhood and his other marriages (the film focuses only on his marriage to Ali MacGraw), were dropped because they felt they did not move the story along. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on 112 reviews, with an average rating of 7.69/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Though not objective by any means, The Kid Stays in the Picture is irresistibly entertaining.\\" Stage production An adaptation of the book—along with material from a further, unpublished volume of Evans' memoirs—for the Broadway stage was announced in 2010, to be written by Jon Robin Baitz and directed by Richard Eyre, but the production was canceled in 2011. Another stage adaptation of the book was first performed at the Royal Court Theatre in London in 2017. It was adapted by the Complicite theatre company and directed by Simon McBurney. The cast included Danny Huston, son of John Huston, who worked with Evans on Chinatown.

These recordings made use of a mixture of traditional musical instruments along with a vacuum cleaner, a radio, an oil drum, a doll, and a set of dishes. Moreover, the speed of the tape recording was manipulated, further distorting the sounds being recorded. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Merzbow took Lou Reed's album Metal Machine Music as a point of departure and further abstracted the noise aesthetic by freeing the sound from guitar based feedback alone, a development that is thought to have heralded noise music as a genre. According to Paul Hegarty (2007), \\"In many ways it only makes sense to talk of noise music since the advent of various types of noise produced in Japanese music, and in terms of quantity this is really to do with the 1990s onwards ... with the vast growth of Japanese noise, finally, noise music becomes a genre\\". Other key Japanese noise artists that contributed to this upsurge of activity include Hijokaidan, Boredoms, C.C.C.C., Incapacitants, KK Null, Yamazaki Maso, Solmania, K2, The Gerogerigegege, Mayuko Hino and Hanatarash.

Meduna's original formula was 5% CO2 and 95% oxygen, but the term carbogen can refer to any mixture of these two gases, from 1.5%Prisman E, Slessarev M, Azami T, Nayot D, Milosevic M, and Fisher J.

Jul;83(7):457-62. to 50%Erowid Carbogen Vault: Basics. CO2.  Mechanism  When carbogen is inhaled, the increased level of carbon dioxide causes a perception, both psychological and physiological, of suffocation because the brain interprets an increase in blood carbon dioxide as a decrease in oxygen level, which would generally be the case under natural circumstances. Inhalation of carbogen causes the body to react as if it were not receiving sufficient oxygen: breathing quickens and deepens, heart rate increases, and cells release alkaline buffering agents to remove carbonic acid from the bloodstream.  Psychotherapy  Carbogen was once used in psychology and psychedelic psychotherapy to determine whether a patient would react to an altered state of consciousness or to a sensation of loss of control. Individuals who reacted especially negatively to carbogen were generally not administered other psychotherapeutic drugs for fear of similar reactions. Meduna administered carbogen to his patients to induce abreaction, which, with proper preparation and administration, he found could help clients become free of their neuroses. Carbogen users are said to have discovered unconscious contents of their minds, with the experience clearing away repressed material and freeing the subject for a smoother, more profound psychedelic experience. One subject reported: \\"After the second breath came an onrush of color, first a predominant sheet of beautiful rosy-red, following which came successive sheets of brilliant color and design, some geometric, some fanciful and graceful …. Then the colors separated; my soul drawing apart from the physical being, was drawn upward seemingly to leave the earth and to go upward where it reached a greater Spirit with Whom there was a communion, producing a remarkable, new relaxation and deep security.\\" Carbogen is rarely used in therapy anymore, largely due to the decline in psychedelic psychotherapy.  Uses  A carbogen mixture of 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide can be used as part of the early treatment of central retinal artery occlusion. Carbogen is used in biology research to study in vivo oxygen and carbon dioxide flows,Arnold JF, Kotas M, Fidler F, Pracht ED, Flentje M, Jakob PM. (2007). Quantitative regional oxygen transfer imaging of the human lung. Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Aug 8;26(3):637-645 as well as to oxygenate the aCSF solution and stabilize the pH to about 7.4 in research on acute brain slices. Its use in combination with nicotinamide is also being investigated in conjunction with radiation therapy in the treatment strategy of certain cancers.http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00147732 Because increased tumor oxygenation improves the cell-killing effects of radiation, it is thought that the inhalation of these agents during radiation therapy could increase its effectiveness.

They also produced the O-Cedar line of brooms, mops, sponges and scrubbers.  Company beginnings  Philip Drackett, born to a Cleveland shipbuilding family in 1856, decided to cut his own swath, apprenticing to a pharmacist while in school, and opening his own Cleveland drugstore upon his marriage. He was fascinated by chemicals, though and eventually sold the drugstore, becoming a sales representative for drug supply houses, first in Chattanooga, Tennessee, then in Cincinnati. At the age of 54, his sons grown, he and his wife Sallie opened their own brokerage, providing chemicals with such items as soda ash, caustic soda, chlorinated lime, and denatured alcohol to janitor-supply companies, laundries, and other industrial users throughout the midwest, south and west. He did well; five years later, his sons Harry and Philip Jr. were working for the firm, and instead of selling bulk chemicals, they were packaging them. During the 1920s, P. W. Drackett and Sons was the nation's largest manufacturer of medicinal quality epsom salts.  Once every week, Drāno in every drain  With an increasing number of homes incorporating indoor plumbing, Drackett saw a need for a good chemical drain opener. Clogs are largely caused by grease and hair going down the drain. Lye turns grease into soap, a process known as saponification, but in hard water, soap curdles, adding to the problem. One approach was to use concentrated nitric acid, or sulfuric acid. These attack both hair and soap curd, and generate heat as well, but they also attack metal pipes. Drackett used a mixture of dry lye crystals and aluminum pellets, producing much heat. When he used machined shards of aluminum instead of smooth aluminum beads, the sharp aluminum in churning mix physically would cut through most ordinary clogs, yet the aluminum was soft enough to not cut into metal pipes. About 50 Drackett salesmen carried glass plumbing around so they could do dramatic demonstrations of Drāno's action in department stores and in home shows. Drāno also contains salt which has been dyed. It does little to open drains, but is added for psychological appeal.  History of Drāno Mrs. Drackett, who for years effectively served as the company's front office, is credited with naming the company's first major consumer-product breakthrough in 1923. An English purist, she insisted on using a macron - a small dash - above the a to ensure the correct pronunciation of Drāno and leave no doubt as to its intended purpose.  Windex introduced  With increased numbers of cars, and greater use of glass in buildings, the introduction of Windex shortly thereafter would be a natural, except that in 1933, the USA was in a depression. As laundry soap was replaced with laundry detergent in the post- WWII years, the Windex's formula changed as well. The new Windex was mostly water, with small amounts of sodium dodecyl sulfate (an ionic surfactant) and solvent. The product was colored blue for consumer appeal, and packaged in glass bottles with an attached sprayer. Although this formula was cheaper to produce, the large amount of water requires users to polish the glass for a longer time as they dry the window, yelding better results. The greatest difficulty in reformulating Windex was finding a proper dye. Many dyes were tried, but they would either fade in a few weeks, or else they would stain the window frames. After spending thousands of man-hours developing the proper dye, the patent attorneys revealed exactly what dye was being used when they filed for a German patent - and Windex's competitors all had the trademark blue appearance within months. Drackett emphasized packaging, and bought major positions in companies that made sprayers, aerosol valves, and a contract packer of aerosol products.  Soybeans  In 1931, Henry Ford announced that soybeans were the new miracle crop. The seeds produced a healthful edible oil, a meal extremely high in protein, a residue high in fiber, were low in water, and they stored well. Soy made nationwide headlines at the Century of Progress Chicago World's Fair in 1934, and by 1935, 60 pounds of soybeans went into the paint and molded plastic parts of every Ford car. Other companies were quick to hop on the soy bandwagon, either to sell to Ford or to follow his lead with this exciting new technology. Archer-Daniels-Midland built facilities in 1933 and MacMillan changed his plans, founding Central Soya in 1934, instead of the Central Sugar company based on sugar beets he had planned only a year earlier. Drackett raised soybeans on his farms, invested heavily in soybean crushing mills, and produced a variety of products ranging from dog treats to sponges made from a soybean plastic. By 1940, Robert Allen Boyer, head of Ford's industrial soy applications research, had developed a synthetic wool made from soybeans, and as Ford was importing 125,000 short tons of wool annually from Australia and Argentina, and World War II threatened that supply, Ford pressed forward with promotion of the fiber. Soon, the sidewall upholstery in Ford autos was a 25% soy wool 75% sheep's wool blend - but when Ford was unable to convince the armed forces to use soy wool for uniforms, he sold his fabrication process and machinery to Drackett in November, 1943. Boyer was part of the deal; he became director of research at Drackett. Drackett couldn't make soy wool commercially feasible, either. In 1947, Boyer wrote an article for the Soybean Digest titled \\"A Modern Shirt from Ancient Soybean,\\" summarizing this work. Boyer wanted to develop food products made from soybeans. Drackett was only interested in industrial products. In 1949, Drackett sold their soybean operations, and Boyer left the company.  Bristol-Myers  In 1965, the Drackett family sold the business to Bristol- Myers. Bristol-Myers at that time included a variety of high-margin businesses such as Playtex and Clairol, and Drackett's business of narrow margins on inexpensive products was not a good fit. After years of trying to find someone who could buy the entire company, the company was sold to S. C. Johnson & Son in 1992. As expected, the Federal Trade Commission had anti-trust concerns and ordered Johnson not only to divest itself of the Behold and Endust furniture care products and the Renuzit air freshener products within 12 months, but to seek prior approval for a decade before acquiring another furniture care or air freshener company. They placed the furniture brands with Sara Lee and the air freshener with Dial, and were released early from the prior approval requirement. Johnson has since jettisoned some other lines, such as Twinkle metal polish and O'Cedar handle goods. Drackett's Professional Products Division, established in 1968 to market to commercial and institutional users, was retained as a separate operating unit in Cincinnati. In 2002, Johnson bought DiverseyLever. Their professional brands division and Drackett's were folded together to form JohnsonDiversey Consumer Branded Professional Products.

He was the son of a celebrated engraver and received a first-rate education in his craft. Flameng initially received renown for his history painting and portraiture, and became a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. He decorated such important civic buildings as the Sorbonne and the Opera Comique, and also produced advertising work. Flameng was granted France's highest civilian honor, the Legion d'Honneur, and designed France's first bank notes. He was also made an honorary Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in the 1908 Birthday Honours. Flameng later received renown for his painting of World War I. He was named honorary president of the Society of Military Painters and an accredited documenter for the War Ministry. His work was displayed in the Hôtel des Invalides in Paris, as well as being reproduced in newsmagazines. At the time they were painted, Flameng's war paintings were derided by many critics for being too realistic and not including heroic drama (although his paintings seem romantic to eyes which have seen photographs of genocide and nuclear war). Most of his war paintings were donated to the Musée de l'Armée in 1920. In 1919 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Corresponding Academician.

It was built in 1914, to replace a ferry, by the Midland Bridge Company of Kansas City, Missouri, under authority of the Caddo Parish Police Jury. The lift span has been inoperable since the 1940s. With . This vehicular bridge illustrates the \\"Vertical-Lift\\" design of John Alexander Low Waddell of the firm of Waddell & Harrington. This design allowed the entire center span to lift in a vertical direction to allow tall oil equipment to pass through, especially Gulf Oil Company's pile driver. This design was invented in 1893 and was successfully introduced in Chicago with the South Halsted Street Bridge. The Caddo Lake Drawbridge is a direct descendant of this structure. In the summer of 1941, just prior to World War II, the United States Army held maneuvers in and around Mooringsport as a means of preparing the soldiers for war. During the maneuvers, Generals Dwight D. Eisenhower and George S. Patton came to Mooringsport and led the Red and Blue armies in the \\"capture\\" of the bridge. They also bombed the bridge with sacks of flour. In the mid-1940s, ownership of the bridge was transferred away from Caddo Parish to the Louisiana Department of Highways (LA Department of Transportation & Development, abbreviated as DOTD). Shortly after the transfer, the Department of Highways realized that there was no longer a need for the bridge to open. Consequently, the concrete counterweights were removed from the bridge's tower and dropped in the lake. In the late 1970s, due to the narrow width of the bridge, the flow of vehicular traffic was changed to one alternating lane. At this time, the DOTD determined that the useful life of the bridge had been exhausted and it was time to consider its replacement. In 1989, the DOTD received funds from the Federal Highway Administration for a bridge replacement project. The project called for the construction of a new two lane bridge approximately fifty feet to the east of the old bridge. The construction proposal also called for the old bridge to be destroyed when the new one was completed. A citizen's campaign was launched with involvement of Local, State and Federal officials and political leaders. The objective was to save the Historic Caddo Lake Drawbridge and convert its use into a pedestrian walkway, landmark, and tourist attraction. After two years of negotiations, the DOTD and the Federal Highway Administration agreed to use the funds appropriated for removing the structure to refurbish the bridge instead. This agreement was made with the stipulation that Caddo Parish agrees to assume ownership and liability. On June 26, 1991, the Caddo Parish Commissioners voted to accept the bridge into the Caddo Parish Department of Parks and Recreation. On July 24, 1991, The Historic American Engineering Record (U.S. Dept. of the Interior/National Park Service) rendered their evaluation of the bridge. The evaluation indicated that the bridge is nationally significant due to its designer, its unique design, and the fact that it is the sole surviving example of this bridge type in the State of Louisiana. With this determination, the bridge was eligible to be presented for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Due to a unique state law that forbade the application process, this was delayed until ownership changed. After the bridge was cleaned, painted and barricaded to vehicular traffic, ownership of the bridge was transferred back to the Parish of Caddo on October 3, 1995. A rededication ceremony was held in Mooringsport later that month to mark the saving of the town's chief landmark and to honor those who had contributed to the endeavor.

Biography Wilkinson Call, nephew of Territorial Governor of Florida Richard K. Call and cousin of Florida governor David S. Walker and U.S. Senator from Arkansas James D. Walker, was born on January 9, 1834, in Logan County, Kentucky. He was the son of Dr. George W. Call and Lucinda Lee. His mother was a member of the prominent Lee family of Virginia. Kentucky senator John J. Crittenden was his uncle by marriage. By the late 1830s, his parents relocated to Tallahassee, Florida. Call subsequently moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where he studied law and was admitted to the bar and entered practice. By the late 1840s, he entered into a law practice with his cousin David S. Walker in Tallahassee. Call served as adjutant general in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. Call was elected to represent Florida in the United States Senate as a Democrat on December 29, 1865, but was not permitted to enter office by the Republican majority there, like many other Confederate leaders. He subsequently served as a member of the Democratic National Committee and again practiced law in Jacksonville. He was elected, again, as a Democrat to the United States Senate January 21, 1879, but this time was not prevented from taking the seat. He was reelected to his seat January 20, 1885, and May 26, 1891, and served from March 1879 to March 1897 (with a brief vacancy due to the legislature's failure to elect by March 1891). Along with Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, Call became a leader of the Democratic Party's populist agrarian faction, influenced by Florida's agrarian movement of the 1890s. Call actively supported and campaigned for William Jennings Bryan when the latter ran for President of the United States in the 1896 election. Florida Governor William D. Bloxham named John A. Henderson to serve until the state legislature selected a successor for Call. The U.S. Senate, believing Bloxham had overstepped gubernatorial authority, refused to allow Henderson to take office, leaving the matter to the Florida legislature. After several ballots and no decisive victor, Call withdrew and threw his support behind Stephen Mallory II, who won the seat. In the U.S. Senate, Call served as chairman of the Committee on Civil Service and Retrenchment during the 53rd Congress and also served on the Committee on Patents. Upon retiring from the United States Senate, Call resided in Washington, D.C., until his death on August 24, 1910. He was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery. His daughter Lucy Lee Call was a noted opera singer who performed for the New York Metropolitan Opera. A nephew Rhydon M. Call was a long-serving federal court judge in Florida.

It was founded in October 2002 by a group of U2 fans who were inspired by frontman Bono's May 2002 visit to poor sections of Africa along with former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill. The organization was inspired by Bono's charitable work throughout Africa, but is not directly connected to the band. The organization is partnered with Africare, and is staffed entirely by volunteers to minimize overhead. Although most of the donations come from North Americans and Western Europeans that are not actually there to observe the people benefiting from their help, leaps towards progress occurred in African communities due to global concern and global participation, as well as cooperation and understanding amongst the people.  History  Take one of the first well projects that cost a mere one thousand dollars. Access to water in southern Uganda in 2002 was limited due to the Great African War. It must have been a terrifying place to go out to get water for your mother, and your siblings. Children or their mothers in the village of Ntungamo had to travel long distances through the district to collect water for bathing and cooking. But, the water sources were stagnant, just holes in the ground. People often bathed in them, and children just cleaned the algae off of the surface of the water when collecting it. This spread disease in an area of the world where HIV/AIDS is often a taboo topic of discussion, and people are not always properly educated about the severity of the issue because of this. The construction of a well with running water actually helped bring people together, and Africare water experts were able to educate people about the issue of HIV/AIDS, as well as how important it is to do their part in maintaining the well.  Celebrity involvement  By donating money and spreading awareness about issues that people may be struggling with far away, people often feel more connected with the people they're trying to help. For Bono's 50th birthday, U2 fans attempted to raise 50,000 dollars for the Buhara District in Zimbabwe. ReferencesExternal links *The African Well Fund's website.

He is frequently cited as one of known Yugoslav painters, and a member of Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Life Djordje was born to the Serbian father and a German mother in Germany, but most of his education was carried out in Berlin and Belgrade. He was a graduate of the \\"Belgrade Academy of Art\\". He further studied in Italy (1926–1928) and Paris, France (1928–1929). In 1931, his design won First Prize for the Coat of Arms of the City of Belgrade, which it remains today. In 1931 and 1932, he had one-man shows in Belgrade, Zagreb, and Novi Sad. In 1934, he joined in forming the Život group (AKA Life Group) of Yugoslavian artists. His woodcut set Blood-soaked Gold (Krvavo zlato) was published in 1937. He fought with the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War during which time his woodcut set For Freedom (Za sloboda) was published in 1939. The next year he published his collection Sketches, Drawing, And Studies (Skice, crtezi, studije) in Spain. From 1941 to 1945, he was a member of the \\"Yugoslav National Liberation\\" forces. In 1946, his drawings Partisans (Partizani) were awarded the Yugoslav Federation Prize for Graphics, and in 1949, his oil work Witnesses of Horror (Svedoci užasa), the Yugoslav Federation Prize for Painting. In 1951–1953 he belonged to the Independents (Samostalni). In 1945, he joined the faculty, as full-professor, of the \\"Academy of Fine Arts\\" in Belgrade, and, from 1959 to 1963, he was Dean of the Department of Fine Arts of the University of Belgrade, after the Academy had been incorporated into the University. In 1950, he was elected a corresponding member of the \\"Academy of Arts and Sciences\\", and in 1958, a full member. From 1957 to 1960, he was president of the Yugoslav Federation of Artists. In the years following World War II, he had one-man shows in Belgrade (1953 and 1959), Kragujevac, Čačak, Niš, Skopje, Zemun, and Sombor, and in Berlin in 1963. The inventory of his work lists some 300 paintings, among them the monumental as well as the small and intimate. More than 60 are in museums in the country and abroad, about as many are owned by government institutions and enterprises, and the rest are in private collections. Over 1000 drawings are listed; most of them are in museum collections. The few surviving complete, first-print sets of Blood-soaked Gold and For Freedom are owned by museums in Belgrade. He has three mosaics, one at the War Memorial in Ivanjica, a second on the façade of a public building in Kragujevac, and the third at the Holocaust Museum in Paris.

Controversy During 1944 wide purges under bolshevik auspices in Belgrade following the city's liberation from the Nazis by the Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav Partisans, 40-year-old Andrejević-Kun and his wife Nada moved into the apartment belonging to painter Branko Popović only few days after Popović got executed by the new communist authorities. The speed and the manner with which Andrejević-Kun took over his dead colleague's property (Popović's surviving family: his wife Divna and their three children Simeon, Prijezda, and Borivoje were in the meantime kicked out of the apartment by the authorities) raised questions that Popović's prominently located property at 24 Knez Mihailova Street was the real reason behind Popović's execution without trial.

He may have been son or grandson of Osulf I and was father of Uhtred the Bold, Ealdorman of Northumbria. His name is Scandinavian and implies that he had Viking ancestors. The name 'Waltheof' remained in his family when Earl Siward married his great-granddaughter and named his son Waltheof. This son of Siward became Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria, and one of his descendant being Saint Waltheof of Melrose. Additionally, another branch of the family would use the Waltheof name including: Waltheof of Allerdale who was son of Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. Waltheof of Inverkeithing and Dalmeny was son of Cospatric, and grandson of Waltheof of Allerdale. Another descendant of Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria was Waltheof, Earl of Dunbar. In 1006 Malcolm II of Scotland invaded Northumbria and besieged the newly founded episcopal city of Durham. At that time the Danes were raiding southern England and King Æthelred was unable to send help to the Northumbrians. Ealdorman Waltheof was too old to fight and remained in his castle at Bamburgh. Ealdorman Ælfhelm of York also took no action. Waltheof's son Uhtred, acting for his father, called together an army from Bernicia and Yorkshire and led it against the Scots. The result was a decisive victory for Uhtred. Local women washed the severed heads of the Scots, receiving a payment of a cow for each, and the heads were fixed on stakes to Durham's walls. Uhtred was rewarded by King Æthelred II with the ealdormanry of Bamburgh even though his father was still alive. Sources *Stenton, Sir Frank M. Anglo-Saxon England; 3rd edition.

Two teams of two unacquainted players went on a shopping spree at six stores, each with four prizes, on a fictional street on stage. The object of the game was to match the desired prizes with visual clues given by the contestant in the quickest amount of time. The show was hosted by Ron Pearson, announced by Burton Richardson and produced by Jay Wolpert Enterprises and MTM Enterprises. Main Game Prior to the show, one contestant from each team was shown the six stores, and from each store chose one prize they would like to have. At the beginning of the round, one player was isolated while the other stood on a pedestal in the \\"town square\\" at center stage wearing various objects on his/her body that would give clues to their partner about the prizes he/she selected. The player and host Pearson went over the items the contestant was wearing. At that point, a randomly selected member of the studio audience helped to reveal the six stores for that day's show. This audience member was always referred to as \\"Denise DuJour\\" or \\"Dennis DuJour\\", depending on their gender. After the prizes and stores were revealed, the contestant was asked to strike a pose, after which the contestant's partner was brought out. The partner was given 20 seconds to analyze the items on the posing contestant. When the 20 seconds expired, the contestant was released from his/her pose and met his/her partner for the first time. However, if the dressed contestant made a gesture or other action that led to a hint, that team was assessed a 10-second penalty. On Pearson's cue, the partner ran to the first store, chose one of the four prizes and ran back with it to show what prize he/she chose. If the prize the partner chose matched the first contestant's choice, a bell rang, the partner put the prize in the over-sized shopping bag and moved on to the next store. If the partner was wrong, a buzzer sounded, he/she had to listen to a clue posed by Pearson, then returned to that store and chose another prize. The first team established a time for the second team to beat, and the clock stopped after all six stores were completed. After a commercial break, the second team attempted to beat the first team's time in the manner described. The runner on the winning team received a gift certificate for his/her own $500 shopping spree, and their partner kept the prizes they chose. In addition, the winning team advanced to the Birthday Party. In season two, if the runner on the team made it through all six stores without making a mistake, they won a $500 bonus. Bonus round In the bonus round, titled \\"the Birthday Party\\", the contestants chose from among a selection of \\"gifts\\" for which celebrities might have a particular use. The game was played for a vacation package and a cash prize. Double Up Derby Beginning halfway through the first season, the winning team played a game called \\"Denise/Dennis DuJour's Double Up Derby\\" to determine how much money they would play for at the Birthday Party. Before the show, that day's Denise/Dennis selected a prize from one of the six stores. The team was given a brief description of Denise/Dennis, and was then asked to guess which prize they believe Denise/Dennis had chosen. If the team guessed correctly, Denise/Dennis won that chosen prize and the team played for $2,000 in addition to a vacation package at the Birthday Party. If they were unsuccessful, the team played for $1,000 and the package. Regardless of the outcome, Denise/Dennis received a $100 salary for the day. Birthday Party A contestant sliding a gift toward a celebrity. After the team listened to a description of the potential bonus prize, the three pieces of the set rotated 180 degrees to reveal the Birthday Party. The left panel revealed the playing area, the center piece held a large representation of a birthday cake, and the rightmost panel held a wall of 12 to 14 items labeled the \\"Birthday Board\\". One team member shopped for gifts and the other had to wrap and deliver them to the celebrities. Pearson showed the contestants and the home audience each item on the Birthday Board. The game began with a caricature of a famous celebrity (real or fictional, past or present) appearing at the end of a table. The shopper took down an item from the board that he/she thought was connected to the celebrity in some way (a chef's hat would be connected to Wolfgang Puck) and threw it to the wrapper. The wrapper then placed it in the box and slid it down the table to the celebrity. If the team was correct, the gift was accepted and another celebrity appeared. If not, the celebrity \\"rejected\\" the gift and pushed it back. Teams could pass and go back to that celebrity if there was any time remaining. Each correct gift was worth $100, and getting all seven gifts within one minute and 15 seconds awarded each team member a vacation package and $1,000 ($2,000 if the team won the Double Up Derby). During the second season, the shopper could not cross a line on the floor when throwing gifts to the wrapper. If this occurred, a five-second penalty was assessed.

Plot Timothy Young, at five, enjoys having to go to his neighbor's shelter during the Blitz, partly because he gets to sleep with his friend Jill. However, Jill and her mother are killed in an air raid. Timothy spends some of the war in the country before he and his rather narrow-minded Catholic parents return to their lower-middle-class neighbourhood in London. He sees his sister Kath, who is eleven years older, only on her rare visits home, as she is now working in Germany with the occupying forces. In 1951, he faces a decision of whether to apply his mathematical and artistic talent to an apprenticeship as a draughtsman or to the study of architecture at university. Kath invites him to visit her in Heidelberg during the summer. After some trepidation, he agrees. The boat and train journey is highly unpleasant, but he is befriended by a young American man with unconventional views, Don Kowalski. Kath's life in Heidelberg is far more luxurious than anything Timothy knew in England, where some basic foods are still rationed and economic growth is slow. He joins in the good meals, games, and pleasure trips Kath has with her fun-loving friends, especially two Americans, Greg and Vince. Timothy lives surreptitiously in an empty room in a woman's hostel. When he spends a day with Rudolf, the young German porter of Kath's residence, and his family, he sees the much lower German standard of living and deals with his conflicted feelings about the Germans. He also visits an American family with boys his own age and the American school where Don teaches, but doesn't get along well there. His sexual awakening includes hearing his neighbor in the hostel having sex, seeing Kath in bed with Don (who has been sacked because he'd been a conscientious objector), refusing a sexual offer from a woman in the hostel, and developing an infatuation with an American girl. He finally meets her at another American girl's birthday party on a riverboat and then has an erotic encounter with her in his room. Kath's routine is disturbed when Greg and Vince disappear on a trip to Berlin, but they return a few days later, apparently having strayed into the Russian zone and been interrogated as possible spies. Timothy goes to a party with Kath where she and her friends dress up in Vince's collection of Nazi uniforms and medals. Don breaks up this nightmarish scene and reveals that Vince has had a sexual relationship with Rudolf, possibly extorting sexual favours in return for help denazifying Rudolf's father. An epilogue takes place in a motel in California, where Timothy, now a thirty-year-old academic in Environmental Studies, and his wife and sons are visiting Kath, who's still single. It's revealed that Vince and Greg were both homosexual and their disappearance in Berlin was an attempt to defect to the Soviets. Don is now a professor and has been married and divorced. Timothy reflects on how lucky he is to have a good career and a loving family when things have not gone so well for others. Origins The most autobiographical of Lodge's novels, it reflects the author's own rite of passage in Heidelberg visiting a young aunt, though he points out a number of differences between his visit and what happened in the novel. The naive tone of the narration, especially that of Timothy's early childhood, alters as he matures. In the afterword to the 1984 edition, Lodge explains the novel's origins, as well as the serious problems with the typesetting of the earlier edition.

Bryan's stint in the Senate was brief, having been appointed to fill a vacancy the day after Christmas of 1907 — less than three months before his own death at the age of 31. Biography=Early years William James Bryan was born in Orange County, Florida, (now Lake County, Florida) on October 10, 1876. He was the son of a planter named John Milton Bryan and his wife, the former Louise Margaret Norton.\\"William James Bryan,\\" National Cyclopedia of American Biography: Volume 14. New York: James T. White and Co., 1910; pp. 236-237. Bryan counted one of his great, great grandfathers as an early pioneer from England to the Province of North Carolina. His grandfather had first moved from North Carolina to Florida and his father had become prominent in the politics of the state. Bryan attended public schools, graduating from Osceola High School of Kissimmee, Florida. He studied extensively at home and gained admission to Emory College in Oxford, Georgia (forerunner of today's Emory University) at the age of 16. Bryan graduated from Emory with a B.A. degree in 1896. Following graduation, Bryan taught school for one year and worked on a plantation for another, all the while studying for law school. Bryan then enrolled in the law department of Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, from which he graduated in 1899.\\"William James Bryan,\\" Biographical Directory of the United States Congress, 1774-Present. United States Congress, www.bioguide.congress.gov/ Bryan was admitted to the bar later in 1899 and began the practice of law in Jacksonville, Florida. Bryan initially opened a partnership but separated from his partner to open his own private office the following year. In 1903 Bryan married Janet G. Allan, the daughter of a staff officer to Stonewall Jackson during the American Civil War who had gone on to become a mathematics professor at Washington and Lee University. The couple had two children. Political career In 1902 Bryan was elected as Duval County solicitor in its Criminal Court of Record. He was re-elected to this office in 1906, remaining in that capacity throughout 1907. Bryan assumed office in May 1903 and took action to ensure the enforcement of the Florida legislature's prohibition against Sunday operation of saloons and oversaw a crackdown against gambling in Jacksonville.James Taliaferro, \\"Address of Mr. Taliaferro of Florida,\\" William James Bryan (Late a Senator from Florida): Memorial Addresses, 60th Congress, 1st Session: Senate of the United States, May 2, 1908; House of Representatives, May 3, 1908.

Bryan achieved prominence in the Florida Democratic Party during this interval, serving on the party's State Committee and elected as a delegate to the 1904 Democratic National Convention in St. Louis, Missouri. On December 26, 1907, Bryan was appointed to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Stephen Mallory II. Bryan traveled to Washington, DC to take the seat on January 8, 1908,Taliaferro, \\"Address of Mr. Taliaferro of Florida,\\" p. 44. thereby becoming the second youngest member in the body's history, following Henry Clay. Death and legacy About a month after his arrival in the nation's capital, Bryan was stricken with typhoid fever, an illness which caused his premature death on March 22, 1908, at the age of 31. Bryan was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Jacksonville, Florida. Bryan's older brother, Nathan Philemon Bryan (1872–1935), would be elected to the United States Senate in 1910 and served a full term in Washington before becoming a Federal Circuit Court judge.\\"Nathan Philemon Bryan,\\" United States Congress, www.bioguide.congress.gov/ See also *List of United States Congress members who died in office (1900–49) FootnotesFurther reading * William James Bryan (Late a Senator from Florida): Memorial Addresses, 60th Congress, 1st Session: Senate of the United States, May 2, 1908; House of Representatives, May 3, 1908.

His contributions include linking attribution theory, the psychology of motivation, and emotion. Life and career Weiner received his undergraduate degree in Liberal Arts from the University of Chicago in 1955 and an MBA, majoring in Industrial Relations, from the same university in 1957. Following two years of service in the U.S. Army, Weiner enrolled in a PhD program in personality at the University of Michigan, where he was mentored by John Atkinson, one of the leading personality and motivational psychologists of that era. Weiner completed his PhD in 1963, and spent two years as an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota before joining the psychology faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1965, where he remained active into the early 2000s.Graham, Sandra. Weiner, Bernard 1935-. Retrieved December 16, 2019. Weiner has published 15 books and many articles on the psychology of motivation and emotion, and has been a Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles since 1965. He is the father of Mark Weiner, a professor of law at Rutgers School of Law–Newark. Research Professor Weiner's primary research interests are Social Cognition, Helping, Prosocial Behaviour, Judgment and Decision Making, Motivation, Goal Setting, Causal Attribution, Law and Public Policy, Interpersonal Processes and Emotion, Mood, Affect.Bernard Weiner. Social Psychology Network Weiner got interested in the field of attribution after studying achievement motivation. He used TAT to identify differences in people's achievement needs and then turned to the study of individual issues people face when they think of their own successes and failures. He further conducted research into the cognitive processes that have motivational influence. Attribution theory Attribution theory seeks to explain the causes of an event or behavior. A three stages process, they are observations, determination of behavior, and attributing to causes. There are two types of attributions, namely external and internal. External attribution relates causality to outside agents, whereas, internal attribution assigns the person himself for any behavior. In an 1996 interview, Weiner elaborated how attribution contributes to \\"high ability, high achievement, and giftedness\\", stating that \\"other-perception and self-perception form a unity, together, which influence task persistence and, therefore, actual ability.\\" According to Weiner, everyone all have similar psychodynamics in the classroom and students tend to seek explanation for personal failure. Weiner raised the question on what is considered \\"sin\\" and what is \\"sickness.\\" The construals he gave surrounded obesity: obesity due to overeating is a sin; obesity because of a thyroid problem is a sickness. Bernard hoped that these type of scenarios would help him come up with a general theory of social conduct. Publications and partial bibliography * * Weiner, B. (1986).

It is also referred when programmers offer something different from the rival's program as an alternative, to increase the audience size. United States The main events counterprogrammed in the United States are the Super Bowl, the Oscars, and the Olympic Games. Super Bowl The Super Bowl, being among the most watched sports television events in the United States, became a notable target of counterprogramming during the 1990s due to its previous halftime shows; which critics felt were dated and not representative of modern pop culture. During Super Bowl XXVI, Fox aired a live, football-themed episode of In Living Color against halftime (featuring an onscreen countdown clock so fans would know when to switch back to the game); the special drew 22 million viewers; Nielsen estimated that CBS lost 10 ratings points during halftime as a result of the special. The success of the special alarmed the National Football League, who took steps to increase interest and viewership of the halftime show by inviting major pop musicians to perform, beginning with Michael Jackson at Super Bowl XXVII. This pattern continued until 2005, when an incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII's halftime show where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts, led to a string of halftime shows with a single, headlining classic rock act (such as The Rolling Stones, Prince, and Bruce Springsteen) in an effort to prevent a repeat of the \\"wardrobe malfunction\\" (since Super Bowl XLV, the NFL has returned to inviting pop artists to play halftime). Despite Michael Jackson's performance helping to increase interest in subsequent halftime shows, Fox's success inspired imitators, and influenced other specials such as Animal Planet's annual Puppy Bowl (featuring dogs playing in a model football stadium), and the Lingerie Bowl, a series of pay-per-view broadcasts of all- female football games played in lingerieproving popular enough to be spun off into its own Lingerie Football League. Under an unsaid gentlemen's agreement, all four major networks (including CBS, Fox, and NBC, who also alternate airing the Super Bowl on a yearly cycle; ESPN is under the same ownership as ABC) will typically not schedule any new programming (nor air counterprogramming) on the night of the Super Bowl. Fox provided an exception in 2010 when it aired two new episodes of 'Til Death against Super Bowl XLIV; however, the network had been in the process of burning off the low-rated sitcom in unusual timeslots so its distributor would have enough episodes to syndicate it. As to preempt the possibility that the 2022 Winter Olympics would counterprogram the game, CBS agreed to swap Super Bowl LVI—which, for the first time, is scheduled during an ongoing Olympic Games—to NBC for Super Bowl LV, so that both events are aired by the same network. NFL Network also suspends programming during the game in favor of Super Bowl Game Center, a static screen with the game's radio broadcast and a live scoreboard. Academy Awards In 2007, the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series' Auto Club 500 at Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, California was held on the same day as the 79th Academy Awards, although it was held during the early afternoon with a 1:00 p.m. PT (4:00 p.m. ET) start. The 2008 Auto Club 500 was plagued by rain delays and unintentionally aired against a portion of the 80th Academy Awards; its start time was pushed back to around 3:00 p.m. PT (6:00 p.m. ET), while the race itself was halted again at around 6:00 p.m. PT (9:00 p.m. ET). In 2009, the race was intentionally scheduled with a 3:00 p.m. PT start, which would overlap into the telecast of the 81st Academy Awards. Fox Sports' senior vice president of programming and research Bill Wanger supported the idea, believing that NASCAR races \\"[could] hold their own against any competition\\", arguing that the Oscars and the race appealed primarily to female and male audiences respectively. For the 2010 season, the race was moved to a 12:00 p.m. PT (3:00 p.m. ET) start due to standardized start times for all races introduced that season. For a number of years, the championship game of the NCAA men's basketball tournament aired on the day of the Academy Awards ceremony, leading into primetime. The 1976 NCAA Final Four, broadcast on NBC, ended with the Indiana Hoosiers defeating the Michigan Wolverines, 86–68; the game ended just as the Best Film Editing Oscar was about to the announced. That year's Academy Awards ceremony acknowledged its competition when the final score of the game was announced before Verna Fields was announced as the winner of the award. By the time CBS had taken over broadcasting the NCAA Final Four, the Academy Awards ceremony had by now taken place the week before the Final Four, and has since moved well away into mid or late February (except during Winter Olympic years) due to ABC's want to have the awards take place during the February sweeps period, along with the general consolidation of the film awards season into a shorter period. The 2012 NBA All-Star Game was played opposite the 84th Academy Awards. The presentation drew an estimated 39.3 million viewers, a 4% increase over the previous year. Conversely, viewership for the All Star Game on TNT measured at 7.1 million, a 22% decline from last year's 9.1 million.NBA All-Star Game's 7.1 Million Viewers Down 22% From Telecast In '11 The Alliance of American Football scheduled one of its contests opposite the 91st Academy Awards in 2019. The game drew 515,000 viewers, a bump of approximately 20% from the previous week's and following week's matchup on the same network, NFL Network.https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/02/27/aaf-ratings-climb- for-week-three-on-nfln/ College football The move is harder in the sport, especially with ESPN games competing against CBS games. Because of a CBS contract with the Southeastern Conference that gives the conference exclusivity at the 3:30 p.m. ET slot, and ESPN's games being regional (parts of the country may receive games from different conferences, with ABC now airing primarily the Atlantic Coast Conference and most Notre Dame away games), and even a Fox game with one of their three conferences, college football schedules are intentionally made flexible in order to allow networks to choose the best game when possible. The SEC opened their exclusivity up slightly in the 2014 for ESPN with the launch of their SEC Network with the conference, which now allows that ESPN to air up to two SEC games (one on the main SEC Network feed, with a lower-tier matchup carried by the SEC Network's alternate feed), though CBS retains first choice for their preferred game.  Professional wrestling  In 1995, the professional wrestling promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) began to schedule a live, weekly show on TNT, Monday Nitro, to compete directly with the rival WWF's (now WWE) Raw on USA Network (which, at the time, did not always broadcast live), resulting in an intense rivalry dubbed the \\"Monday Night Wars\\". Aided by WCW's popular New World Order (nWo) angle with Hulk Hogan, Nitro regularly beat Raw in viewership for 84 consecutive weeks. In 1997, the WWF began to shift its programming in a more \\"mature\\" and adult-oriented direction dubbed the \\"Attitude Era\\" to compete with WCW, . By April 1998, bolstered by the popularity of performers such as Stone Cold Steve Austin, and his in-universe feud with WWF owner Vince McMahon, Raw began to overtake Nitro in viewership for the first time since 1996. As the show only aired live on occasion, WCW commentators occasionally discussed Raw spoilers on-air, as a ploy to keep viewers from tuning away. This tactic infamously backfired during its January 4, 1999 episode, when a spoiler that Mick Foley (who formerly performed for WCW as Cactus Jack) would win the WWF Championship as Mankind had the opposite effect, causing Nitro to lose around 600,000 viewers to the final hour of Raw. The Nitro main event (featuring Hulk Hogan defeating Kevin Nash for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship) was also marred by its unusual build-up and controversial finish—dubbed the \\"Fingerpoke of Doom\\". Critics credited the episode's events as one of several missteps that led towards WCW's eventual demise, and the sale of its assets to WWF. A renewed wrestling rivalry between TNT and USA emerged in 2019, between WWE and the new promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW) — which has been seen as the first major promotion since WCW to compete financially with WWE. TNT began to air AEW's first weekly program, Dynamite, on Wednesday nights beginning on October 2, 2019. On August 2, WWE announced that it would expand WWE NXT—a popular WWE Network program that focuses on a developmental brand of the same name—to a two-hour format on USA Network beginning the same night (soft-launching on September 18 with only the first hour airing on USA, as lead-ins for the final episodes of Suits). The decision was seen as a move to counterprogram the upstart AEW, and also came alongside USA losing WWE's second flagship program SmackDown to Fox the same month. Both AEW and NXT held two-week events on their July 1 and 8, 2020 episodes, with AEW holding Fyter Fest (which had originally been planned as a PPV), and NXT holding The Great American Bash (a former pay-per-view brand originating from WCW). Other NBC, the long-time broadcaster of the Macy's Fourth of July fireworks in New York City, has historically aired an encore presentation of the special at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT, immediately following its live broadcast. The Boston Pops Orchestra's own concert and fireworks special on CBS aired live at the same time as the NBC encore. While NBC claimed that this was for budgetary reasons, Boston Pops executive producer David G. Mugar believed that NBC had done so to intentionally pull viewers away from the Boston Pops. After ratings fell by 1 million viewers for 2012, CBS ended its national broadcasts of the event in 2013; the concert was still aired in full, as before, by its Boston station WBZ-TV. The national broadcast was revived on CBS for 2016 with an expanded two-hour format, before moving to Bloomberg Television in 2017 due to Bloomberg's new sponsorship of the event. On the day of Donald Trump's inauguration as president of the United States, Comedy Central broadcast an all-day marathon of the 20th season of South Park — which had featured an ongoing storyline where Mr. Garrison is elected president in a parody of Trump and his campaign. During the 2018 Winter Olympics, which were broadcast by NBC, other networks generally placed their main lineups of scripted programming on hiatus, barring The CW for selected series. However, the networks continued to air most of their unscripted reality programs as an alternative, with ABC airing The Bachelor and Shark Tank, and CBS airing The Amazing Race. ABC and CBS also scheduled spin-offs of their other signature reality franchises to specifically compete against the Olympics, including The Bachelor Winter Games (which featured alumni of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette competing in winter sports challenges), and the first U.S. edition of Celebrity Big Brother (which aired its season finale against the closing ceremony). ABC had planned a follow-up to air in August 2020 against the 2020 Summer Olympics, The Bachelor Summer Games, but production was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic (which led said Games to be postponed to 2021). United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, Ofcom can punish broadcasters who deliberately counterprogram another broadcaster for the intent of damaging the other broadcaster's ratings. In 2000, the coincidental scheduling of the first million-pound winner on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? opposite the final episode of One Foot in the Grave drew accusations of counterprogramming; the ITC, after investigating the matter, exonerated Millionaire and its broadcaster of any wrongdoing.

The purpose of the organization was to promote the welfare of American sculptors, although its founding members included several renowned architects. The founding members included such well known figures of the day as Daniel Chester French, Augustus St. Gaudens, Richard Morris Hunt, and Stanford White as well as sculptors less familiar today, such as Herbert Adams, Paul W. Bartlett, Karl Bitter, J. Massey Rhind, Attilio Piccirilli, and John Quincy Adams Ward—who served as the first president for the society. Since its founding in the nineteenth century, the National Sculpture Society (NSS) has remained dedicated to promoting figurative and realistic sculpture. During the years 1919 to 1924, four works commissioned from members of the National Sculpture Society were funded by philanthropist Paul Goodloe McIntire, including George Rogers Clark (1921) by Robert Ingersoll Aitken at Charlottesville, Virginia. Membership worldwide in 2006 was around 4,000 members, including sculptors, architects, art historians, and conservators. Its headquarters, library, and gallery are located in midtown Manhattan. In 1951, the NSS started publishing Sculpture Review, a quarterly magazine. It is now published for NSS by Sage Publishing in conjunction with Policy Studies Organization. Past presidents of the society have included John Quincy Adams Ward, James Earle Fraser, Chester Beach, Wheeler Williams, Leo Friedlander, Neil Estern, and Cecil de Blaquiere Howard. The first woman to gain admission into the NSS was Theo Alice Ruggles Kitson, in 1893. She was followed a few years later by Enid Yandell and Bessie Potter Vonnoh in 1898; Janet Scudder in 1904; Anna Hyatt Huntington in 1905 and Evelyn Longman and Abastenia St. Leger Eberle in 1906. In 1946, Richmond Barthé was likely the first African-American to be admitted. In 1994, the NSS held their first exhibition outside the United States at the Palazzo Mediceo Di Seravezza in Italy. Titled “100 Years of the National Sculpture Society of the United States of America in Italy” it ran from the 16th of July through the 4th of September and was curated by Nicky and Stanley Bleifeld along with Costantino Paolicchi in collaboration with Lodovico Gierut and Paolo Giorgi. Among the 60 notable American sculptors whose work was selected for the exhibition were Stanley Bleifeld, Andrew DeVries, Neil Estern, Leonda Finke, Bruno Lucchesi, Barbara Lekberg, Richard MacDonald and Elliott Offner.National Sculpture Society, Finito di stampare nel mese di luglio 1994 dalle EDIZIONI ETS Pisa ReferencesExternal links * National Sculpture Society website Category:American artist groups and collectives Category:American sculpture Category:Art societies Category:Art and design-related professional associations Category:Arts organizations established in 1893 Category:1893 establishments in the United States ","title":"National Sculpture Society"},{"id":"3816564","text":"A sitz bath or hip bath is a bath in which a person sits in water up to the hips. It is used to relieve discomfort and pain in the lower part of the body, for example, due to hemorrhoids (piles), anal fissures, perianal fistulas, rectal surgery, an episiotomy, uterine cramps, inflammatory bowel disease, pilonidal cysts and infections of the bladder, prostate or vagina. It works by keeping the affected area clean and increasing the flow of blood to it. Such hip baths were originally a European custom,. although modern sitz baths are used mainly for therapeutic purposes. The term sitz bath is derived from the German word Sitzbad, meaning a bath (Bad) in which one sits (sitzen). Preparation A sitz bath may be created simply by filling a bathtub with some water and sitting in it for a few minutes. Alternatively, a large basin can be used. There are also special devices that fit into toilet bowls. Sitz baths may either be warm or cool, or alternating between the two. Substances such as salt, baking soda, or vinegar may be added to the water. Warm baths are recommended for reducing the itching, pain and discomfort associated with conditions such as hemorrhoids and genital problems. An ordinary bathtub can be filled with of hot water (about ), and sat in for 15–20 minutes or until the water cools down. Alternatively, a large basin can be used, and there are specially built devices that fit into toilet bowls.. Cool sitz baths are said to be helpful in easing constipation, inflammation and vaginal discharge, and, in cases of fecal or urinary incontinence, in toning the muscles. Several variations of the procedure can be used, with different therapeutic effects depending on the temperature of the water, the length of time spent immersed and the method of immersion (such as dipping and 'hot and cold alternate'). Some people find that alternating three to five times between a hot bath for 3–4 minutes and an ice-cold bath for 30–60 seconds is soothing. A towel soaked in cold water can be used in place of a cold bath. For most purposes sitz baths with water are sufficient, though some people prefer to use saline water or water mixed with baking soda. The use of such additives helps to reduce infections. Women with candidiasis (a vaginal yeast infection) may benefit from a warm bath with salt and vinegar. Electronic bidets which irrigate the anal region with a flow of warm water have been compared with sitz baths, and found to produce very similar reduction in anal pressure, with no change in temperature, if used with low-pressure warm water. Some electronic bidets have a dedicated \\"sitz\\" function. A typical electronic bidet with a \\"sitz\\" function. Benefits A warm sitz bath could be helpful to relieve congestion and edema by aiding venous return from the perianal area. Its major effect is thought to be due to the reductions of spasms by relaxing the anal sphincter pressure, reducing anal pain. It has benefits for patients with elevated anal pressure due to anorectal diseases such as anal fissure or inflamed haemorrhoids, and after surgical operations involving the anus. Risks Sitz baths are considered very low risk. Because hot baths cause blood vessels to dilate, on rare occasions some people can feel dizzy or have palpitations (rapid or abnormal heartbeat). People prone to such occurrences are advised to have someone standing by to assist them. References *.

It is an orchestral adaptation of an ancient legend, the Butterfly Lovers. Written for the western style orchestra, it features a solo violin played using some Chinese techniques. It bears considerable likeness to \\"The Lark Ascending\\" written by English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, which was written in 1914. The Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto is written in traditional 5-note technique (pentatonic scale), it uses many Chinese melodies, chord structures and patterns. This gives the piece a distinctive \\"Chinese\\" sound, though it uses tonal harmonies. The Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto was written in 1959 by two Chinese composers, He Zhanhao (何占豪, born 1933) and Chen Gang (陈钢, born 1935), while they were students at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. The music did not attain popularity before the late 1970s, when China loosened its restrictions after the Cultural Revolution. Once released from censorship, it became an embodiment of China in transition. The work is a common feature in figure skating and in concert halls worldwide. This concerto is now often performed with Chinese instruments playing the violin part, the most common being Erhu, Pipa and Liuqin. In such cases the soloist is often accompanied by an orchestra consisting of Chinese instruments. He Zhanhao is more widely credited for the composition of the concerto. However, his main contribution was the famous opening theme while most of the development was in fact written by Chen Gang. This was revealed in an interview of by China Central Television with several artists contributed in the creation and popularity of this piece of work in China and worldwide. The 1959 premiere of the Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto featured 18-year-old violinist Yu Lina and took place in Shanghai as part of the celebration of the 10th anniversary year of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It was first recorded in 1959 with soloist Shen Rong on violin and the Symphony Orchestra of Shanghai Music Conservatory conducted by Fan Cheng-wu. Story and musical elements The concerto is in one movement, but is broken into seven distinct sections. Each tells a different part of the story of the Butterfly Lovers. Some of the melodies come from the Chinese Opera of the same name or from traditional Chinese folk songs. The solo violin of the concerto is symbolic of Zhu Yingtai, the story's protagonist, and the cello part is symbolic of Liang Shanbo, her lover.  I. Adagio Cantabile  The concerto begins with two fifths in D by the harp, after which a solo flute opens with a flowery melody, setting the scene of the story. A solo oboe enters with the strings in G major, after which the solo violinist enters and begins a simple melody. This melody comes from a Chinese folk song of the Yellow River (Huanghe), and tells the story of Zhu Yingtai's childhood. The solo violin is accompanied by a harp and other elements of the orchestra. On the road to Hangzhou for her studies, Zhu (disguised as a man) meets Liang for the first time; a cello solo intertwines with the violin, bringing a new, but still melodious theme and modulating to D major. As the cello exits, the orchestral tutti plays the same melody of the solo violin, with occasional violin entrances in between. As the first buds of love begin to blossom, a short violin cadenza using mostly the G-pentatonic scale expresses Zhu's joy of her and Liang's oath of fraternity.  II. Allegro  The orchestra begins the next section in E major, the violin entering with a fast and jovial melody, representing Zhu and Liang's busy three years of school. Many examples of violin technique are represented, namely spiccato, fast playing over a wide range of notes, and even arpeggiatos, in a standard display of difficulty for a violin concerto.  III. Adagio assai doloroso  As the end of their schooling draws near, Liang and Zhu grow sad as they realize that their time together is nearly over. Zhu invites Liang to visit her family and to court her sister. He doesn't know that Zhu is really inviting him to marry her. Liang promises to see Zhu again, but Liang waits before doing so.  IV. Pesante – Piu mosso – Duramente  When Zhu returns home, she finds that her father has promised her to the son of a rich family. The solo violin struggles against the forces of the orchestra, representing her protests against her father.  V. Lagrimoso  When Liang arrives, he sees Zhu and realizes that she is a woman, and they fall in love. The solo violin and cello solo play an emotional duet, one of the most famous and powerful sections of the work.  VI. Presto resoluto  The love duet between the two is replaced by anger as Liang learns that in his absence, Zhu has been betrothed to another. The solo violin launches into a brilliant and difficult passage, supported by chords from the orchestra, but eventually returns to the original melody representing love, accompanied again by the cello solo. Liang becomes sick and dies as the duet draws to a close. Another virtuosic section for the solo and orchestra combines both the slow melodies and the fast energetic passages introduced before. The section ends with the suicide of Zhu as the solo violin ends with an abrupt high note.  VII. Adagio cantabile  The lovers' parts are united by a final section, with the solo violin and the orchestra redeveloping the opening theme to build to a triumphant climax. The concerto ends bittersweetly with a final melodic phrase from the solo violin, concluding mysteriously on a high D from the strings. In the legend, Liang's grave opens and Zhu throws herself into the chasm; the ending portraying the lovers' transformation into butterflies, never to be separated again.

The Lalaing family came from Hainaut and had a tradition of governing. His father was Philip de Lalaing, count of Hoogstraten; his mother, Anna of Rennenberg. Life Rennenberg (as he was known in the Netherlands) was after the Pacification of Ghent appointed stadtholder of the Northern provinces by the States General of the Netherlands in 1577 on a proposal from William of Orange. He allowed a number of important reforms in Friesland, such as the introduction of the Gedeputeerde Staten (Delegated States), and the forming of a fourth quarter in the States of Friesland to represent the eleven Frisian cities. He was a firm believer in the Pacification of Ghent as a means to reconcile the rebellious Calvinists with their Catholic king. When the treaty resulted in Protestantism gaining ground, notably in Brussels, Ghent and Bruges, he abandoned the cause of the rebels for the king on 3 March 1580, with the support of the city of Groningen, according to tradition convinced by his sister Cornelia van Lalaing.Erik Swart, Lalaing, Cornelia van, in: Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland.

In 1966, Castrol was acquired by Burmah, which was renamed Burmah-Castrol. BP Amoco (now BP) purchased the company in 2000. History The company was founded as the Rangoon Oil Company in Glasgow in 1886, by David Sime Cargill to develop oil fields in the Indian subcontinent. In the late 1890s, it passed into the ownership of Sir Campbell Kirkman Finlay, whose family already possessed vast colonial interests through their trading vehicle James Finlay and Co. In the first decade of the 20th century, Burmah Oil created a subsidiary company named Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) – later Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, then British Petroleum and eventually BP. It restricted its downstream interests to the Indian subcontinent, where BP had no business interests. In 1923, the company gave £5,000 (£236,000 in 2011 money) to future Prime Minister Winston Churchill to lobby the British government to allow them sole control over oil resources in Persia.Irish Independent: Churchill mythology It played a major role in the oil industry in the Indian subcontinent for about a century through its subsidiaries, and in the discovery of oil in the Middle East through its significant influence over British Petroleum.The coloured history of the Burmah Oil Company It marketed itself under the BOC brand in Burma, Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan) and Assam (in India) and through a joint venture Burmah-Shell with Shell in the rest of India. Until 1901, when the Standard Oil Company started operations in Burma, Burmah Oil enjoyed a monopoly in the region. The company operated in Burma until 1963, when Ne Win nationalised all industries in the country. Based on nationalized assets of Burmah Oil, the Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise was created. The company was involved in a landmark legal case in 1964, Burmah Oil Co. v Lord Advocate, concerning the destruction of oil fields in Burma by British forces in 1942, winning a 3-2 decision in the House of Lords, but the effect of this was reversed by the War Damage Act 1965.Law of War: Burmah Oil Company v. Lord Advocate In 1966, Castrol was acquired by Burmah, which was renamed Burmah- Castrol.British entrepreneurs and brand names The Bank of England came to the rescue of Burmah Oil after the company made large losses on its tanker fleets in 1974. The core of the rescue operation was the provision of a year's grace so that the company could become smaller and more viable. In 2000, Burmah- Castrol was acquired by the then BP Amoco (now renamed BP).BP buys Burmah Castrol Burmah in Australia Until the 2000 acquisition of Burmah-Castrol, the company operated a number of service station sites in Australia. Many of the service station sites were acquired by independent retailer United Petroleum and convenience store giant 7-Eleven. Burmah also operated sites under the branding Astron and Major. A majority share in Astron was acquired by Burmah-Castrol from Avi Silver and Eddie Hirsch (founders of United Petroleum) in 1990. Sponsorship Burmah sponsored Swindon Town Football Club from 1991 to 1995, during which time they were promoted to the Premier League but then suffered two successive relegations. Burmah had a head office based within the town. For a short period they also sponsored the Airedale and Wharfedale Senior Cricket League's Trophy, awarded for the highest combined points total achieved by a member club's first and second XI teams.

The station's studio is located at the GMA Network Center Complex, EDSA corner Timog Avenue, Diliman, Quezon City, with transmitter located at GMA Tower of Power Barangay Culiat, Tandang Sora, Quezon City, Philippines. DWLS-FM operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (with exception of the Paschal Triduum, during the annual Holy Week on terrestrial FM radio only). Barangay LS 97.1 was recognized as the #1 FM radio station in Mega Manila, according to the Nielsen Radio Audience Measurement survey conducted in the month of May, 2017. History=1955–1976: DZXX It first aired in June 1955, when \\"Uncle Bob\\" Stewart opened the DZXX-AM 890 kHz station, the first pop music station in the country on AM format. 1976–1992: WLS FM/The Giant On July 1976, GMA launched 97.1 WLS FM as an adult standards and jazz station. In 1981, at the height of popularity of pop music, it switched to Adult Top 40 format, with the slogan The Best Music. It was known for playing hourly Beatles music every weekday early mornings, which was later on adopted by 100.3 RJFM. In November 1988, upon the completion of GMA's Tower of Power, WLS earned the brand, The Giant 97.1 WLS FM. 1992–2007: Campus Radio When GMA was renamed as the \\"Rainbow Satellite Network\\" in early 1992, the station was reformatted on April 30, 1992 as Campus Radio 97.1 WLS FM, with a Top 40 format. This was to target teens & early adults. Its notable programs were the longest-running program on the station, the legendary \\"Top 20 at 12\\" (anchored by Milo Cavarlez aka The Triggerman, which was first heard on Kiss FM 101.1 (now 101.1 Yes The Best), where the top 20 songs of the day were counted down in the mold of BBC Radio 1's The Official Chart Show at noontime, and \\"Campus Aircheck\\", an institution of sorts for aspiring DJs to get hired by Campus Radio, touted as \\"the first school on the air\\". In 1995, when Mike Enriquez took over the radio operations, Campus Radio was reformatted to a contemporary MOR format, earning its slogan \\"Forever!\\". At this time, a few programs were introduced, notably the Message Center, wherein one's message must not be a greeting. By the end of 1999, it shifted back to Top 40. During their heydays as an English- language radio station, they used jingles designed for the station by JAM Creative Productions. 2007–present: Barangay LS On February 14, 2007, Campus Radio rebranded as Barangay LS 97.1, using its old slogan, \\"Forever!\\". It reverts to a masa format. Despite Campus Radio's dominant ratings performance in the pop category, GMA's FM radio sales unit failed to sell the format. With consistently low sales figures, this paved the way for Mike Enriquez to successfully persuade the network's upper management to agree to shift WLS to a seemingly more profitable \\"masa\\" format. Most of the staff were retained, albeit changing their names. Unfortunately, the industry reception is lukewarm and Barangay LS has yet to regain the revenue losses incurred by the shift of advertisers to competing FM stations. Barangay LS 97.1 logo (2009–2011) Last January 16, 2008 at around 6 pm, the station launched its new tagline, \\"Ayos!\\", which is also the tagline for RGMA's provincial Campus Radio stations. That same day, almost all of the staff who were also from the former Campus Radio format, and after years of loyal service to GMA Network, were summarily dismissed by Mike Enriquez. Despite rising from #7 to #4 in the ratings, Enriquez deemed them unfit to take the format to the ratings game. In turn, they were replaced unceremoniously by jocks from RGMA provincial radio stations as well as jocks from other masa stations. Barangay LS 97.1 logo (2011–2014) On January 17, 2011, facing competition with the latest masa stations, the new tagline \\"Tugstugan Na!\\" was launched and the station adopted the \\"crazy fun\\" sound brand in the market. Mike Enriquez was replaced by Glenn F. Allona as program director/station manager, aiming Barangay LS to bring back the focus on the staple of FM Programming which is music. Barangay LS 97.1 logo (2015–2017) On February 17, 2014, Barangay LS 97.1 was rebranded with reformatted programs, new jingle, a new logo & a new slogan called \\"Isang Bansa, Isang Barangay\\". Along its reformat, RGMA's FM radio stations carrying the Campus Radio brand (including 99.5 RT in Cebu, 103.5 Wow FM in Davao and Super Radyo DYRU 92.9 in Kalibo) adopted the Barangay FM branding. The network rebranding was made to compete with its rival FM radio network My Only Radio, owned by the network's competitor ABS-CBN, following the relaunch of DWRR-FM as MOR's flagship station seven months earlier. Barangay LS 97.1 logo (2017–2019) In July 2019, the station readapted its original slogan \\"Forever!\\" (after it was dropped in 2008). Ken Chan and Rita Daniela performed its station's new jingle entitled Tayo ay Forever under GMA Music. On March 20, 2020, the station implements a scaled-down programming operation due to the present situation and conditions affecting the radio station's staff due to the enhanced quarantine against COVID-19. On the same day, the station began its hookup with the sister AM-station Super Radyo DZBB 594.

Examples of the commercial use of space include satellite navigation, satellite television and commercial satellite imagery. Operators of such services typically contract the manufacturing of satellites and their launch to private or public companies, which form an integral part of the space economy. Some commercial ventures have long-term plans to exploit natural resources originating outside Earth, for example asteroid mining. Space tourism, currently an exceptional activity, could also be an area of future growth, as new businesses strive to reduce the costs and risks of human spaceflight. The first commercial use of outer space occurred in 1962, when the Telstar 1 satellite was launched to transmit television signals over the Atlantic Ocean. By 2004, global investment in all space sectors was estimated to be $50.8 billion. As of 2010, 31% of all space launches were commercial.https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/faq/ History The first commercial use of satellites may have been the Telstar 1 satellite, launched in 1962, which was the first privately sponsored space launch, funded by AT&T; and Bell Telephone Laboratories. Telstar 1 was capable of relaying television signals across the Atlantic Ocean, and was the first satellite to transmit live television, telephone, fax, and other data signals. Two years later, the Hughes Aircraft Company developed the Syncom 3 satellite, a geosynchronous communications satellite, leased to the Department of Defense. Commercial possibilities of satellites were further realized when the Syncom 3, orbiting near the International Date Line, was used to telecast the 1964 Olympic Games from Tokyo to the United States. Between 1960 and 1966, NASA launched a series of early weather satellites known as Television Infrared Observation Satellites (TIROS). These satellites greatly advanced meteorology worldwide, as satellite imagery was used for better forecasting, for both public and commercial interests. On April 6, 1965, the Hughes Aircraft Company placed the Intelsat I communications satellite geosynchronous orbit over the Atlantic Ocean. Intelsat I was built for the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), and demonstrated that satellite-based communication was commercially feasible. Intelsat I allowed for near- instantaneous contact between Europe and North America by handling television, telephone and fax transmissions. Two years later, the Soviet Union launched the Orbita satellite, which provided television signals across Russia, and started the first national satellite television network. Similarly, the 1972 Anik A satellite, launched by Telesat Canada, allowed the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to reach northern Canada for the first time. Beginning in 1997, Iridium Communications began launching a series of satellites known as the Iridium satellite constellation, which provided the first satellites for direct satellite telephone service. Spaceflight Delta IV Medium launch carrying DSCS III-B6 The commercial spaceflight industry derives the bulk of its revenue from the launching of satellites into the Earth's orbit. Commercial launch providers typically place private and government satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO) and geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO). The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has licensed four commercial spaceports in the United States: Wallops Flight Facility, Kodiak Launch Complex, Spaceport Florida, Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and the Vandenberg Air Force Base. Launch sites within Russia and China have added to the global commercial launch capacity. The Delta IV and Atlas V family of launch vehicles are made available for commercial ventures for the United States, while Russia promotes eight families of vehicles. Between 1996 and 2002, 245 launches were made for commercial ventures while government (non-classified) launches only total 167 for the same period. Commercial space flight has spurred investment into the development of an efficient reusable launch vehicle (RLV) which can place larger payloads into orbit. Several companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin are currently developing new RLV designs. In the United States, Office of Commercial Space Transportation (generally referred to as FAA/AST or simply AST) is the branch of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that approves any commercial rocket launch operations--that is, any launches that are not classified as model, amateur, or \\"by and for the government.\\"  Satellites and equipment  ;Satellite manufacturing Commercial satellite manufacturing is defined by the United States government as satellites manufactured for civilian, government, or non-profit use. Not included are satellites constructed for military use, nor for activities associated with any human space flight program. Between the years of 1996 and 2002, satellite manufacturing within the United States experienced an annual growth of 11 percent. The rest of the world experienced higher growth levels of around 13 percent. ;Ground equipment manufacturing Operating satellites communicate via receivers and transmitters on Earth. The manufacturing of satellite ground station communication terminals (including VSATs), mobile satellite telephones, and home television receivers are a part of the ground equipment manufacturing sector. This sector grew through the latter half of the 1990s as it manufactured equipment for the satellite services sector. Between the years of 1996 and 2002 this industry saw a 14 percent annual increase. ;Transponder leasing Businesses that operate satellites often lease or sell access to their satellites to data relay and telecommunication firms. This service is often referred to as transponder leasing. Between 1996 and 2002, this industry experienced a 15 percent annual growth. The United States accounts for about 32 percent of the world's transponder market.  Subscription satellite services  In 1994, DirecTV debuted direct broadcast satellite by introducing a signal receiving dish 18inches in diameter. In 1996, Astro started in Malaysia with the launch of the MEASAT satellite. In November 1999, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act became law, and local stations were then made available in satellite channel packages, fueling the industry's growth in the years that followed. By the end of 2000, DTH subscriptions totaled over 67 million. Satellite radio was pioneered by XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio. XM's first satellite was launched on March 18, 2001 and its second on May 8, 2001.Kevin Bonsor, \\"How Satellite Radio Works,\\" HowStuffWorks. Accessed May 1, 2013.

Satellite imagery  Satellite imagery (also Earth observation imagery or spaceborne photography) are images of Earth or other planets collected by imaging satellites operated by governments and businesses around the world. Satellite imaging companies sell images by licensing them to governments and businesses such as Apple Maps and Google Maps. Satellite navigation Magellan GPS receiver in a marine application. A satellite navigation or satnav system is a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning. It allows small electronic receivers to determine their location (longitude, latitude, and altitude/elevation) to high precision (within a few centimeters to metres) using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites. The system can be used for providing position, navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver (satellite tracking). The signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision, which allows time synchronisation. These uses are collectively known as Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT). Satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception, though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated. Space tourism Virgin Galactic VMS Eve Space tourism is human space travel for recreational purposes. There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital, suborbital and lunar space tourism. To date, orbital space tourism has been performed only by the Russian Space Agency. Work also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic. In addition, SpaceX (an aerospace manufacturer) announced in 2018 that they are planning on sending space tourists, including Yusaku Maezawa, on a free-return trajectory around the Moon on the Starship. Commercial recovery of space resources  Artist's concept of asteroid mining Commercial recovery of space resources is the exploitation of raw materials from asteroids, comets and other space objects, including near-Earth objects. Minerals and volatiles could be mined then used in space for in-situ utilization (e.g. construction materials and rocket propellant) or taken back to Earth. These include gold, iridium, silver, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium and tungsten for transport back to Earth; iron, cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, aluminium, and titanium for construction; water and oxygen to sustain astronauts; as well as hydrogen, ammonia, and oxygen for use as rocket propellant. There are several commercial enterprises working in this field, including Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries and Planetoid Mines. Regulation  Beyond the many technological factors that could make space commercialization more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of private property, the difficulty or inability of individuals in establishing property rights in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for both human habitation and commercial development. Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty, which had been, , ratified by all spacefaring nations. In November 25, 2015 President Obama signed the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act (H.R. 2262) into law. The law recognizes the right of U.S. citizens to own space resources they obtain and encourages the commercial exploration and utilization of resources from asteroids.

In the important case of univariate polynomials over a field , this means that f \\\\in k[X] is square-free if and only if b^2 mid f for every polynomial b \\\\in k[X] of positive degree.Yun, David Y.Y. (1976). On square-free decomposition algorithms SYMSAC '76 Proceedings of the third ACM symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation, pp. 26–35. In applications in physics and engineering, a square-free polynomial is commonly called a polynomial with no repeated roots. Such polynomials are called separable, but over a perfect field being separable is the same as being square-free. A square-free decomposition or square-free factorization of a polynomial is a factorization into powers of square-free factors : f = a_1 a_2^2 a_3^3 \\\\cdots a_n^n =\\\\prod_{k=1}^n a_k^k\\\\, where those of the that are not equal to 1 are pairwise coprime square-free polynomials. Every non-zero polynomial with coefficients in a field admits a square-free factorization, which is unique up to the multiplication of the factors by non- zero constants. The square-free factorization is much easier to compute than the complete factorization into irreducible factors, and is thus often preferred when the complete factorization is not really needed, as for the partial fraction decomposition and the symbolic integration of rational fractions. Square-free factorization is the first step of the polynomial factorization algorithms that are implemented in computer algebra systems. Therefore, the algorithm of square-free factorization is basic in computer algebra. In the case of univariate polynomials over a field, any multiple factor of a polynomial introduces a nontrivial common factor of f and its formal derivative f ′, so a sufficient condition for f to be square-free is that the greatest common divisor of f and f ′ is 1\\\\. This condition is also necessary over a field of characteristic 0 or, more generally, over a perfect field, because over such a field, every irreducible polynomial is separable, and thus coprime with its derivative. Over a field of characteristic 0, the quotient of f by its GCD with its derivative is the product of the a_i in the above square-free decomposition. Over a perfect field of non-zero characteristic , this quotient is the product of the a_i such that is not a multiple of . Further GCD computations and exact divisions allow computing the square-free factorization (see square-free factorization over a finite field). In characteristic zero, a better algorithm is known, Yun's algorithm, which is described below. Its computational complexity is, at most, twice that of the GCD computation of the input polynomial and its derivative. More precisely, if T_{n} is the time needed to compute the GCD of two polynomials of degree n and the quotient of these polynomial by the GCD, then 2T_{n} is an upper bound for the time needed to compute the square free decomposition. There are also known algorithms for the computation of the square-free decomposition of multivariate polynomials.Gianni P., Trager B. (1996). Square-Free Algorithms in Positive Characteristic Applicable Algebra In Engineering, Communication And Computing, 7(1), pp. 1–14. Yun's algorithm This section describes Yun's algorithm for the square-free decomposition of univariate polynomials over a field of characteristic 0. It proceeds by a succession of GCD computations and exact divisions. The input is thus a non-zero polynomial f, and the first step of the algorithm consists of computing the GCD a0 of f and its formal derivative f'. If : f = a_1 a_2^2 a_3^3 \\\\cdots a_k^k is the desired factorization, we have thus : a_0 = a_2^1 a_3^2 \\\\cdots a_k^{k-1}, : f/a_0 = a_1 a_2 a_3 \\\\cdots a_k and : f'/a_0 = \\\\sum_{i=1}^k i a_i' a_1 \\\\cdots a_{i-1} a_{i+1} \\\\cdots a_k. If we set b_1=f/a_0, c_1=f'/a_0 and d_1=c_1-b_1', we get that : \\\\gcd(b_1,d_1) = a_1, : b_2=b_1/a_1 = a_2 a_3 \\\\cdots a_n, and : c_2=d_1/a_1 = \\\\sum_{i=2}^k (i-1) a_i' a_2 \\\\cdots a_{i-1} a_{i+1} \\\\cdots a_k. Iterating this process until b_{k+1}=1 we find all the a_i. This is formalized into an algorithm as follows: The degree of c_i and d_i is one less than the degree of b_i. As f is the product of the b_i, the sum of the degrees of the b_i is the degree of f. As the complexity of GCD computations and divisions increase more than linearly with the degree, it follows that the total running time of the \\"repeat\\" loop is less than the running time of the first line of the algorithm, and that the total running time of Yun's algorithm is upper bounded by twice the time needed to compute the GCD of f and f' and the quotient of f and f' by their GCD. Square root In general, a polynomial has no square root. More precisely, most polynomials cannot be written as the square of another polynomial. A polynomial has a square root if and only if all exponents of the square-free decomposition are even. In this case, the square root is obtained by dividing by 2 these exponents. Thus the problem of deciding if a polynomial has a square root, and of computing it if it exists, is a special case of square-free factorization.

Recorded between July 1971 and March 1972, \\"Rocks Off\\" is one of the songs on the album that was recorded at Villa Nellcôte, a house Keith Richards rented in the south of France during the summer and autumn of 1971. Overdubs and final mixing for the song were later done at Sunset Sound studios in Los Angeles, California between December 1971 and March 1972. Lyrics and composition The lyrics to the song, difficult to hear since the vocals were mixed very low, describe subjective dissociation, as if from intravenous drug injection: The song features a sudden divergence near the two minute fifteen second mark into what has been called a psychedelic jam of sorts, with Mick Jagger's vocals electronically distorted and the guitar chords stretched: \\"Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene. Feel so mesmerized, all that inside me\\". Recording and releases The song's mix is notoriously haphazard, as many instruments, and even the lead vocals, fade in and out of prominence. The villa's basement, where many of the songs were recorded, was extremely hot and many of the guitars could not stay in tune as a result. Jimmy Miller produced the track, and it features session men Nicky Hopkins on piano, Jim Price and Bobby Keys on brass, as well as regular band members Jagger (lead vocals), Richards (backing vocals, guitar), Charlie Watts (drums), Mick Taylor (guitar), and Bill Wyman (bass). \\"Rocks Off\\" was released as a single in Japan.

The company is a state-owned Navratna under the administrative control of India's Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas with its corporate offices in Noida in the New Delhi-NCR region. OIL is engaged in the business of exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas, transportation of crude oil and production of liquid petroleum gas. The company's history spans the discovery of crude oil in the far east of India at Digboi and Baghjan, Assam in 1889 to its present status as a fully integrated upstream petroleum company. Exploration and production Oil India Limited was formed by the Burmah Oil Company Limited as its subsidiary in India 1887 to explore in the Assam Basin, India (Corley, T A B, 1983, The History of the Burmah Oil Company, 1886-1983). Staff at the Burmah Oil Company Limited had heard from a geologist with the colonial British Indian Geological Survey, Thomas Oldham, that oil was found on the feet of elephants that were being used as beasts of burden in the vicinity of the Digboi village (Arun Metrie, pers. comm., former Burmah Oil economist, 1988). The oil on the elephants' feet was traced to the Digboi area, where a surface fold (anticline in geological parlance) had formed a broad hill. A successful technique for exploration for hydrocarbons at the time was drilling beneath seeps on anticlines (Thornton, S E, 2015, The history of Oil Exploration in the Union of Myanmar, Paper No. 10807), so Oil India drilled beneath the Digboi seeps and found a giant oil field. Several other oil fields were subsequently found by Oil India Limited in what became India's first oil production. Recoverable oil reserves. the company produced 3.466 MMT of crude oil, 2625.81 million cubic metre at standard conditions of natural gas and 46,640 tonnes of LPG. Most of this was produced from its traditionally rich oil and gas fields concentrated in the Northeastern part of India and contribute around 80% of total oil and gas produced in the region. The search for newer avenues has seen OIL spreading out its operations in onshore / offshore Orissa and Andaman, Cauvery offshore, Tamil Nadu, Arabian Sea, deserts of Rajasthan, onshore Andhra Pradesh, riverbeds of Brahmaputra and logistically difficult hilly terrains of the Indian state Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh. In Rajasthan, OIL discovered gas in 1988, heavy oil / bitumen in 1991 and started production of gas in 1996. The company has accumulated over a hundred years of experience in the field of oil and gas production, since the discovery of Digboi oilfield in 1889. The company has over of licensed areas for oil and gas exploration. It has emerged as a consistently profitable International company and present in Libya, Gabon, Nigeria, Sudan, Venezuela, Mozambique, Yemen, Iran, Bangladesh and United States. OIL has recently emerged in the offshore giant gas-field project of Mozambique and also made discovery of oil & gas in Gabon as an Operator and Libya as non-operator. OIL acquired Shale oil asset in United States during 2012. In recent years, OIL has stepped up exploration and production activities significantly in north-eastern India. OIL has set up its NEF (North East Frontier) project to intensify its exploration activities in the frontier areas in North East, which are logistically very difficult and geologically complex. Presently, exploration activities are in progress along the Trust Belt areas of Arunachal, Assam including Mizoram. The Company operates a crude oil pipeline from Duliajan to Barauni, in Bihar. History Oil India was founded on 18 February 1959, with its registered office in Duliajan, Assam, as a privately-held oil exploration company. Burmah Oil Company originally held two-thirds of the stock and the Government of India (via the Office of the President) held the rest. In the Spring of 1961 the company became publicly listed, and later that year the Government of India acquired 50% ownership interest. In 1981, the Government of India acquired 100% of the equity interest in the company. The company was created to exploit the oil fields of Naharkatiya and Moran in north-eastern India, which had then been just recently discovered. In 1961, construction of the company's first gas-powered power plant was completed in Duliajan, Assam. IN 1962, a 401 km (16-inch diameter) pipeline from Duliajan to Guwahati was completed. The following year, a 756 km (14-inch diameter) extension to the pipeline from Guwahati to Barauni in Bihar was completed. A long fully automated telemetric pipeline with of looping and a total capacity to transport over 6.0 million tonnes per year remains the lifeline of the company. Commissioned in 1962, the double skinned crude oil pipeline traverses 78 rivers including the Brahmaputra River as it meanders through paddy fields, forests and swamps. There are 11 pumping stations, 18 repeater stations and two terminals at Numaligarh and Rongapani in Udalguri district. The engines that drive the giant pumps along the pipeline have more than two hundred thousand hours of service and established a world record of machine hours. OIL completed the construction of a pipeline from Numaligarh to Siliguri in November 2007. The company also sells its gas to different customers in Assam: Brahmaputra Valley Fertilizer Corporation Limited (BVFCL), ASEB, NEEPCO, Indian Oil Corporation's retail Assam Oil Division, and APL as well as to the Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam formerly part of the Rajasthan State Electricity Board (RSEB). It also produces liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) at its plant in Duliajan,Assam.

Plot summary The story begins with Bernard, a laicised Catholic priest, escorting his unwilling father Jack to Hawaii at the request of his aunt Ursula, who is dying of cancer. On the day after arrival, Jack is hit by a car and sent to hospital. Bernard spends much time travelling between Jack's bedside and Ursula's nursing home, and through this, gets the opportunity to discover their past. Ursula, always portrayed as the selfish black sheep, had been sexually abused as a child by her oldest brother Sean, who was venerated as a hero by the family for his death in the war. Ursula explains to Bernard that the experience ruined her marriage and her life. She wants Jack's apology for Jack knew of the abuse but kept silent. In the midst of this, Bernard strikes up a tentative relationship with Yolande Miller, the driver of the car that hit his father. Bernard's gradual sexual awakening parallels Ursula's struggle with her illness. The narrative switches between third-person prose, Bernard's diary, a long letter from Bernard to Yolande, and postcards and notes sent from Hawaii by various characters encountered by Bernard and Jack on the plane journey from England, concluding with a letter from Yolande to Bernard.

He was born in Fort Dodge, Iowa. Son of Fred A. Garrison and Anna Timms. Garrison studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia and with Gutzon Borglum. He made his home in Denver, Colorado where he served on the faculty of the University of Denver and some of his work can be found. Garrison worked mainly in stone and bronze. In 1919 he moved to Denver and became a Director of the Denver Academy of Applied Art. During his tenure there he taught modeling, drawing and applied design. While in Denver he became acquainted with George William Eggers, the Director of the Denver Art Museum and president of the Municipal Art Commission of Denver. Garrison received commissions for many of Denver's architectural ornaments in the 1920s, including works for the Ideal Building, Midland Savings Building, National Jewish Hospital’s B'nai B'rith Building, Park Hill Branch Library, Denver University’s football stadium, and South High School. In 1930 Garrison moved to New York City and began completing several projects there. These included the three sculptural panels for the RKO Building at the Sixth Avenue entrance of Rockefeller Center in New York City. He also completed a heroic figure at West Point, and sculptural details for the Boston Avenue Methodist Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a National Historic Landmark. Additional works include architectural sculptures in the style of medieval grotesques at South High School, Denver and the figures of the four evangelists on the bell tower of the former St. Thomas Seminary, Denver. The Denver Botanical Gardens has a terracotta frieze depicting 2 hunters with shotguns shooting at a buffalo. This frieze originally was part of the Midland Savings Bank but was removed when the bank was renovated in 1964 and moved to the botanical gardens. His two monumental molded concrete figures of athletes were integral to the University of Denver's Hilltop Stadium (1926), and were demolished along with the stadium in 1971. A public debate ensued about what should be done with Garrison's 27-foot-high sculpted figures that graced the outside walls. The male and female figures were said to be “The spirit and significance of coeducational college athletics.” As the Hilltop Stadium figures were hollow and considered fragile, they were not saved. Garrison also designed the Civic Center Park's Seal Pool fountains, a pair of bronze mountain lions for the entrance of the State Office Building and the gargoyles at Denver’s South High School. Winter 2006 University of Denver Magazine Garrison's work was cited by the National Park Service in the National Register of Historic Places Registration formhttp://www.nps.gov/nhl/Spring2012Nominations/DenverCivicCenter.pdf for Denver's Civic Center and State Capital to be registered as a landmark in 2011. A veteran of World War I, he served overseas in World War I from 14 July 1918 to 22 March 1919. Garrison also enlisted in World War II. He died in 1943 while teaching camouflage painting.

The two models differ only in their screen: The 190 had a 9.5\\" greyscale display, while the 190cs featured a 10.4\\" color display. Apple's target sales audience for this model was the college student in need of a no-frills portable computer. In terms of hardware, along with the PowerBook 150, the 190 has much in common with Apple's \\"professional\\" laptop of the same period, the PowerBook 5300 series. In exchange for the cheaper price point (approximately US$2200 compared to over US$6000 for the cutting- edge PowerBook 5300ce), the 190 was equipped with a passive matrix LCD rather than a crisper active matrix screen. More significantly, while the 5300s ran PowerPC 603e processors at 100 or 117 MHz, the 190 had only a Motorola 68LC040 clocked at 33 MHz - in fact, the 190s were the last Macintoshes to use a 68k CPU. However, Apple offered a PPC upgrade for the 190, a heavily marketed selling point for all new 68040 Macs at the time. In addition, a rather cramped 500 MB IDE hard drive was standard, and factory models shipped with System 7.5.2. It is the only one of the 100 series PowerBooks that does not use the original 140 case design, thus was the only one to include a 68040 processor, a trackpad rather than the standard trackball, and along with the 150 the only ones to provide for more than 14MB RAM expansion and larger, less-expensive IDE drives. The 190 was the de facto replacement for the PowerBook 500 series, which was completely discontinued with the introduction of the 5300 and the only 68040-based PowerBook Apple offered. Sales figures for the 190 are unavailable, but in any event it did not benefit from reports of \\"exploding battery syndrome,\\" where the similar 5300 factory-default lithium-ion battery could short-circuit and burst into flames. Apple quickly offered a recall on all such batteries. The PowerBook 190 series used a nickel metal hydride battery which did not exhibit this problem. Production of the 190 halted in June 1996, while the 190cs was sold until October of that year, when it was replaced by the PowerBook 1400cs. With the discontinuation of the 190, Apple abandoned its market strategy of having two strata of laptops, instead offering low- and high-end configurations of the same model number. The concept would not return to Apple's product lineup until the 1999 introduction of the consumer-oriented iBook.

Life Arakkal was born in Chavakkad, Kerala. Both his parents died when he was young. Leaving the comforts of his house behind, he left for Bangalore, lonely but with a passion to become a painter. The hardships that he faced at Bangalore honed the artist in him and sharpened his sensibility. He took a diploma in painting from Karnataka Chitrakala Parishat (KCP), Bangalore and later specialized in graphic print making from National Academy community studios, Garhi, Delhi. Arakkal received the prestigious Lorenzo De Medici Gold Medal, at Florence Internazionale Biennale, in Florence, Italy for his work Bacon’s Man with the Child and Priest. The artist produced a large collection of miscellaneous works consisting of drawings, paintings, sculptures, murals, paper works, prints and writing. He won several other awards including Karnataka Lalithkala Academy award in 1979 and 1981, a national award in 1983, a special award at the third Asian Art Biennale Dhaka, Bangladesh in 1986 and the Karnataka Lalithkala Academy honor in 1989. Arakkal's paintings are singularly expressionistic in style. In them one could trace the artist's \\"deep concern for man and society. Set against a dark, oppressive background are the faceless figures of ordinary people expressing brooding loneliness and despair brought on by a society obsessively drawn towards material success where ordinary people have no place\\".

It is probably based on the tea preparation approaches originated in FujianJoseph Needham. Science and Civilization of China, V.6, P.V, od Science pp 561 Cambridge University Press and the Chaoshan area of eastern Guangdong.陳宗懋, 中國茶經, pp 590 上海文化 The term literally means \\"making tea with skill\\". Today, the approach is used popularly by teashops carrying tea of Chinese origins, and by tea connoisseurs as a way to maximize the taste of a tea selection, especially a finer one.  History  Attention to tea-making quality has been a classic Chinese tradition.The Classic of Tea All teas, loose tea, coarse tea, and powdered tea have long coexisted with the \\"imperially appointed compressed form\\". By the end of the 14th century, the more naturalistic \\"loose leaf\\" form had become a popular household product and by the Ming era, loose tea was put to imperial use. In Japan, tea production began in the 12th century following Chinese models, and eventually evolved into the Japanese tea ceremony, meant to be exclusive to political and military elites. The related teaware that is the tea pot and later the gaiwan lidded cup were evolved. It is believed that the gongfu tea preparation approach began only in around the 18th century. Some scholars think that it began in Wuyi in Fujian, where the production of oolong tea for export began; others believe that it was the people in Chaozhou in the Chaoshan area in Guangdong started this particular part of the tea culture.南強，烏龍茶 pp 132 中國輕工業出版社 Senchadō in Japan started in the early Edo period influenced from China. Oral history from the 1940s still referred to Gongfu Cha as \\"Chaoshan Gongfu Cha\\". It is likely that regardless of the earliest incidence of the approach, the place that first successfully integrated it into daily life was Chaoshan area. Chaozhou is recognized by some as the \\"Capital\\" of gongfu tea. Chemistry and physics In essence, what is desired in Gongfu Cha is a brew that tastes good and is satisfying to the soul. Tea masters in China and other Asian tea cultures study for years to perfect this method. However, method alone will not determine whether a great cup of tea will be produced. Essentially, two things have to be taken into consideration: chemistry and temperature. Water chemistry Water should be given careful consideration when conducting Gongfu Cha. Water which tastes or smells bad will adversely affect the brewed tea. However, distilled or extremely soft water should never be used as this form of water lacks minerals, which will negatively affect the flavor of the tea and so can result in a \\"flat\\" brew. For these reasons, most tea masters will use a good clean local source of spring water. If this natural spring water is not available, bottled spring water will suffice. Yet high content mineral water also needs to be avoided. Hard water needs to be filtered. Temperature During the process of Gongfucha, the tea master will first determine what is the appropriate temperature for the tea being used, in order to extract the aroma of the tea. An optimal temperature must be reached and maintained. The water temperature depends on the type of tea used. Guidelines are as follows: * 75–85 °C for green tea (80 °C Typical) * 85–90 °C for white tea (90 °C Typical) * 95–100 °C for oolong tea * 100 °C (boiling) for compressed teas, such as pu-erh tea The temperature of the water can be determined by timing, as well as the size and the sizzling sound made by the air bubbles in the kettle. * At 75–85 °C, the bubbles formed are known as \\"crab eyes\\" and are about 3 mm in diameter. They are accompanied by loud, rapid sizzling sounds. * At 90–95 °C, the bubbles, which are now around 8 mm in diameter and accompanied by less frequent sizzling sounds and a lower sizzling pitch, are dubbed \\"fish eyes\\". * When the water is boiling, neither the formation of air bubbles nor sizzling sounds occurs. At high altitudes water boils at lower temperatures, so the above rules cannot be applied. Tools and equipment Below is a list of the main items used in a gongfu tea ceremony in Taiwan, known there as 老人茶 (Pinyin: Lăorénchá). # brewing vessel, Yixing teapot, porcelain teapot, or a covered bowl gaiwan. # tea pitcher (chahai), or any matching size decanting vessel, used to ensure the consistency of the flavor of the tea (Chinese: 公道杯, Pinyin: gōng dào bēi) # hot water kettle, e.g. an electric kettle # brewing tray, or a deep, flat bottom porcelain plate to hold spills (spills are typical) # tea towel or tea cloth, usually dark colored # tea knife or tea pick for clearing the teapot spout and separating leaves from tea cakes # tea cups (traditionally three cups are used in most instances), matching size. Also named Pinming Cup (). Fragrance smelling cup: is intended to capture the aroma and essence of the brewed tea, and is matched with the Pinming cups. # timer # strainer, a tea strainer () sometimes built into the tea pitchers # tea holder, tea leaf holder for weighing and dispensing, or a wooden tea spoon to measure the amount of tea leaves required (Chinese: 茶匙, Pinyin: chá chí) # optional: tea basin or bowl used as the receptacle for used tea leaves and refuse water # optional: scale # optional: kitchen thermometer # optional: scent cup (snifter cup) used to appreciate the tea's aroma (Chinese: traditional 聞香杯, simplified 闻香杯, Pinyin wén xiāng bēi) # optional: A pair of tongs called \\"Jiā\\" (Chinese: 挾) or \\"Giab\\" () in both the Chao Zhou and Min Nan dialects. # optional: a calligraphy-style brush with a wooden handle, which is used to spread the wasted tea evenly over the tea tray to ensure no part dries out and the tea \\"stain\\" is spread evenly to ensure a pleasing colour to the tray A tea pet, usually made from the same clay as a Yixing teapot, is fun to have. One kind of \\"tea pet\\" is a \\"tea boy.\\" Prior to the tea ceremony, he is soaked in cold water. Hot water poured over him during the tea ceremony will make him \\"pee.\\" Traditionally these 'pets' are classical Chinese figurines, such as a Dragon, Lion Turtle, or Toad, and are used as a receptacle over which the wasted tea is poured, usually to develop a patina.

Miranda had been a regular with The Times of India and other newspapers in Mumbai, including The Economic Times, though he got his popularity with his works published in The Illustrated Weekly of India. He was awarded India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, in 2012. Life and career=Early life Miranda was born in Daman, then in Portuguese India, to Catholic parents. At an early age, he would draw caricatures and sketch on the walls of his home, until his mother brought him a blank book. He then began making personalised postcards for his friends, charging them a token amount, in the 1930s and 1940s. He even started getting into trouble at school, for sketching Catholic priests. Mario Miranda's early cartoons presented vignettes of Goan village life, a theme he is best known for even today. He would maintain diaries from the age of 10, sketching the life around him. He studied at St. Joseph's Boys' High School, Bangalore and then did a B.A. in History at St. Xavier's College, Mumbai, while focusing on the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). Thereafter he started studying architecture at the behest of his parents, though he soon lost interest. He then began getting small commissions and would sketch people in his private diaries in 1949. He loved good food and red wine in moderation but would mainly visit eateries and taverns to document the lives of the patrons. Career beginnings Miranda started his career in an advertising studio, where he worked for four years, before taking up cartooning full-time. He got his first break as a cartoonist with The Illustrated Weekly of India which published a few of his works. His drawings & cartoons also brought him an offer to work at the Current magazine. A year later, the Times of India offered him a slot, even though they had rejected him at first. Thereafter, his creations, such as Miss Nimbupani and Miss Fonseca, appeared on a regular basis in Femina, Economic Times, and The Illustrated Weekly of India. Mario then won a grant by the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and lived in Portugal for year, helping him \\"broaden his horizons\\". He then moved to London, working for different newspapers and even working in television animation. During his five years spent there, his caricatures were published in magazines like Mad, Lilliput and Punch. He then travelled to many countries, either working or conducting exhibitions. Return to Mumbai Miranda returned to India for good in the late 1980s and was offered back his old job with the Times of India in Mumbai, where he worked with noted cartoonist, R.K. Laxman. Thereafter, Miranda met artist Habiba Hydari. They got married and had two sons, Rahul and Rishad. Recognition and fame Miranda's big break came in 1974, when, at the invitation of the United States Information Services, he travelled to America, which enabled him to promote his art and interact with other cartoonists in the United States and also got a chance to work with Charles M. Schulz, the creator of Peanuts) and met Herblock, the editorial cartoonist of the Washington Post. He held solo exhibitions in over 22 countries, including the United States, Japan, Brazil, Australia, Singapore, France, Yugoslavia, and Portugal. Later years and death After retirement, Miranda lived in his ancestral home, at Loutolim, a village in Salcete, Goa, with his wife Habiba. Even after he retired, Miranda's work was seen regularly in Mumbai publications, and he was invited to travel to countries such as Mauritius and Spain, and draw their local cultures. On 11 December 2011, Miranda died of natural causes at his home in Loutolim. His funeral was held on 12 December 2011 at Loutulim Saviour of the World Church, Mario's body was then taken to the Hindu Crematorium in Pagifond, Margao, where he was cremated as per his wishes. Indian cartoonist Graphi and fine artist, Vijay N Seth (Vins) paid tribute to Miranda, whom he considered as a mentor: Style According to Aaron Renier (who created the Google Doodle commemorating Miranda on his 90th birth anniversary in 2016), Miranda's most popular style of cartooning was \\"very flat with criss-crossing interactions\\". Renier went on to explain: Miranda's cartoons often indulged in sexist stereotypes, with the women being drawn as curvaceous and having bulging eyes. He would observe people everywhere (like eateries, taverns, weddings, the bus stop, the post office) and document their social life. However, he always stayed away from drawing political cartoons. Art critic Uma Nair describes how all his work was subtly witty. Describing his drawing style, she finds that his tales were told through cubism and the nature of the contours of his work, stating that his \\"geometric jiggles\\" coupled with subtle colours helped convey the emotions of the characters. His works would include people from all walks of life interacting with one another. Additionally, he would capture the essence of Goan life. She goes on to describe: Beyond cartooning Besides cartooning, Miranda's murals are present on various buildings in Goa and other parts of India. Late in life he took to paintings which received wide response. Over the years, he published several books, including Laugh it Off, Goa with Love, and Germany in Wintertime. Besides his own books, he illustrated books by Dom Moraes (A Journey to Goa), Manohar Malgonkar (Inside Goa) and Mario Cabral e Sá (Legends of Goa). He also illustrated many children's books, including Dul-Dul, The Magic Clay Horse (1968), The Adventures of Pilla the Pup (1969), and Lumbdoom, The Long-Tailed Langoor (1968), all written by Uma Anand and published by India Book House, Mumbai, under its Echo imprint. In 1951, he collaborated with Sanskrit scholar Jose Pereira and IAS officer Alban Couto (Maria Aurora Couto's husband) to publish a special issue of Marg on Goan art and culture. He loved to travel and listening to music and it was his ambition to experiment further with water colours and to write memories of his early years in Goa, on retirement. He was not able to fulfil these two latter ambitions. In the 1990s, Rushi Yazdegardi (then owner) of Café Mondegar asked Mario Miranda to draw murals (cartoons) on two opposite walls. Both walls have different themes. Whilst one wall is dedicated to the Life in Mumbai, the other wall is dedicated to Atmosphere in the Café. File:Cafe Mondegar bar with mural.JPGCafe bar with murals File:Cafe Mondegar, Colaba Causeway, interior wall murals.jpgMurals on restaurant walls In 1998, Miranda requested Wendell Rodricks to write a chapter on the history of the Pano Bhaju, a traditional outfit worn to perform the mando in Goa. This inspired Rodricks to research it in detail, finally publishing the results of his years of research in his first book, Moda Goa: History and Style, in 2012. When the new municipal market of Panjim was inaugurated in 2004, Miranda was invited to paint a mural on its walls by then Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar. Delighted with how the new complex had turned out, he refused to charge fees from the government for his work. Legacy Miranda's house features in the 1985 Shyam Benegal film, Trikaal, which is loosely based on Miranda's family. Benegal admitted to having been deeply influenced by Miranda's house and family after a visit. He recalls how during his visit, he was told of how one of Miranda's ancestors accidentally killed the wrong Rane during the revolt of the Ranes in Goa, a story which inspired him to make the film. In 2005, Gerard da Cunha began working on a book on the artist and collected 13,000 of Miranda's works, tracking them down through various sources. In 2016, an exhibition titled \\"A pocketful of chuckles\\" on the works of Mário de Miranda was held at Gallery Gitanjali at Panaji. This was the largest exhibition of the original cartoons and paintings of Mario de Miranda. The Life of Mario: 1949, a compilation of caricatures drawn by the 23-year old Mario Miranda in 1949, was also released by da Cunha. This was the third in a series that includes the years 1950 and 1951. Awards and accolades In 1988, Miranda was featured in the national integration \\"Mile Sur Mera Tumhara\\" video, which included multiple notable Indians in arts, films, literature, music, and sports. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1988, the Padma Bhushan in 2002 and All India Cartoonists's Association, Bangalore, honoured him with a lifetime achievement award.Mario at International Centre, Dona Paula The King of Spain, Juan Carlos, conferred on Mario the highest civilian honour of \\"Cross of the Order of Isabel the Catholic\\" which was presented to him on 11 November 2009 at his family home in Loutulim by tourism counsellor Don Miguel Nieto Sandoval. On 29 December 2009 Portugal, under the President of the Republic Aníbal Cavaco Silva, made him \\"Commander of the Order of Prince Henry\\", a Portuguese National Order of knighthood. Mario Miranda was posthumously awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian award, by the President of India on 4 April 2012. After his death in 2011, the Goa Legislative Assembly made an obituary reference to him in March 2012. In 2013, a road junction in Mumbai was named after Miranda. In May 2016, Google honoured him with a doodle on his 90th birth anniversary. The doodle showcased a typical Mumbai neighbourhood scene during the rains.

The story concerns a successful sitcom writer, Laurence Passmore, plagued by middle-age neuroses and a failed marriage. His only problem seems to be an \\"internal derangement of the knee\\" but a mid-life crisis has struck and he is discovering angst. His familiar doses of cognitive therapy, aromatherapy, and acupuncture all offer no help, and he becomes obsessed with the philosophy of Kierkegaard. Moreover, Tubby, as Passmore is nicknamed, and referred to by several characters in the novel, undertakes a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in order to find his first love.  Structure of the novel  The novel is divided into four parts. The first part is written as a journal, the second part is written in dramatic monologues, the third part consists of journal entries and a memoir and the fourth part is a narrative written after the events happened and Tubby has returned to London. In the first part, Tubby starts writing a journal triggered by a description he had to write for his cognitive behavior therapist. Before that Tubby wrote only screenplays but no narrative texts. During the writing Tubby reflects upon his problems and depression. The dramatic monologues seem to present an outward look on Tubby but the reader finds out later that the monologues were written by Tubby himself which ruins the objectivity of this part. The reader cannot step out of Tubby's perspective but reads everything filtered through his eyes. In the third part, the reader is presented the memoir about Maureen, Tubby's first love and his first girlfriend. It is by writing down their story that Tubby realizes what his problem is: he betrayed Maureen by dumping her in front of their friends. The fourth part is written by Tubby looking backward on the events. He tells about his travel to Spain where he searched for Maureen on the Way of St. James. It is there, that Tubby comes to terms with his problems and finds peace.  Kierkegaardian philosophy  While writing his journal and looking up words and names, Tubby encounters the writings of Søren Kierkegaard. A list of Kierkegaard book titles catches his attention and motivates him to delve into Kierkegaard's journals and publications. Tubby feels that he and Kierkegaard have experienced similar difficulties. For example, Tubby likens his being mocked in a magazine article to Kierkegaard's Corsair Affair; and the way Tubby dumps Maureen, he feels, is akin to Kierkegaard's breakup with Regine. Tubby struggles to find a way out of his depression. Even though Tubby denies Christianity it may be interpreted that he undergoes the three (Kierkegaardian) existential stages of 'the Aesthetic', 'the Ethical' and 'the Religious' and takes leaps of faith to move from one stage to another.

The estate was originally owned by the Monastery of Westminster and granted to Robert Palmer by King Henry VIII in 1540. History The foundation stone was laid in 1577 by the 2-year-old Thomas Palmer, and Parham has been a family home ever since. Thomas Bishopp (later Sir Thomas Bishopp, 1st Baronet) bought Parham House in 1601. For over 300 years his descendants continued to live at Parham House Estate until January 1922. Then in 1922 the Hon. Clive Pearson, younger son of Viscount Cowdray, bought Parham from Mary,17th Baroness Zouche in her own right,Mary Cecil Frankland née Curzon (1875-1965), 17th Baroness Zouche in her own right, wife of Sir Frederick Frankland 10th Baronet and he and his wife Alicia opened the house to visitors in 1948, after the Second World War when it had also been home to evacuee children and Canadian soldiers. The Long Gallery Off the Long Gallery at the top of the house there is an exhibition which touches on the period between 1922 and 1948, with many family photographs as well as photographs of the building works which took place during that time. Mr and Mrs Pearson, followed by their daughter Veronica Mary Tritton (died 1993), spent more than 60 years restoring Parham and filling it with a collection of period furniture, paintings and textiles, also acquiring items that had originally belonged to the house. There is a particularly important collection of early needlework, including bed hangings supposed to have been worked by Mary, Queen of Scots. During the Second World War, the house was home to 30 children evacuated from Peckham in London. In June 1942, the War Department requisitioned the house and estate, relocating the evacuees to make way for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Divisions. After the Second World War, the house was opened to the public. Lady Emma Barnard, the daughter of Benjamin Guinness, 3rd Earl of Iveagh, inherited the house from Mrs Tritton, who was her great-aunt, and lives in one wing with her family. Now owned by a charitable trust, Parham House and Gardens are surrounded by of working agricultural and forestry land. The radical reformer Henry 'Orator' Hunt was buried on Saturday 21 February 1835 in the churchyard of St Peter's Church in Parham Park. The Times published a lengthy report of the funeral. Deer park Around the house stretches of ancient deer park whose Fallow Deer are descendants of the original herd first recorded in 1628. Parham Park SSSI is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It has special biological interest for its epiphytic lichen flora, as an area for two rare beetles and its large heronry. Eighteenth-century smuggling Parham House had connections with an infamous smuggling raid on the Customs House at Poole in 1747 by the notorious Hawkhurst Gang. The body of one of the other smugglers was later found in the pond of the Parham House estate after being dumped there some 12 miles from where he had been beaten to death by his accomplices. Film location The 1995 film Haunted by British director Lewis Gilbert was filmed extensively at Parham. It is based on a novel of the same name by James Herbert, who had strong connections to Sussex, residing at the time of his March 2013 death in Woodmancote, West Sussex.

The school caters to Years 7-13 (Forms 1-7), and currently has a roll of approximately 1097. Founded in 1962 by Father Catcheside, the school was named after Antonio Rosmini, founder of the Institute of Charity. The school's motto is Legis Charitas Plenitudo, translated as 'Charity Fulfills the Law', or sometimes translated as 'Love Fulfills the Law'. Tom Gerrard was the school's principal from 1976 until 2014, making him New Zealand's longest serving principal. Catholic Character The school's curriculum mirrors that of state schools, apart from the addition of Religious Education classes, and its associated Prayers, Retreats, and Masses. These religious activities and the promotion of Christian values constitute the school's Catholic character. The school's enrolment policy favours boys from Catholic primary schools, although students of other denominations fill the remaining space on the roll, in accordance with government funding legislation for integrated schools. Facilities The school's buildings include the Tindall Auditorium and school chapel, a purpose-built music block, the Maire Technology Block, the Sormany Science Centre, main block (containing classrooms, computer labs, administration facilities, staff offices, and the school library), and several prefabs. The school also has two gymnasiums as well as extensive sports fields and courts. A new gymnasium is the most recent facility. The gym was formally opened in July 2009 by Bishop Pat Dunn, and was named the Tom Gerrard Gymnasium. Academic New Zealand's national secondary qualification, the National Certificate of Educational Achievement, is offered to all Year 11-13 students. In 2007 the school obtained pass rates of 83%, 86%, and 81% in Years 11, 12, and 13 respectively, figures well above the national average. Sports Sport is an integral part of Rosmini life, and the school has enjoyed success at regional level in many sports, particularly rugby. The College's Senior basketball team won a New Zealand National Secondary Schools title in 2011, 2017 and 2018. In 1980, the College's Senior football team won the National Secondary Schools Football Championship. Music and Performing Arts The College has purpose-built facilities for the teaching of music and performing arts. The school has a small jazz band and choir, in addition to solo performers and rock bands. The school also holds drama productions with sister school Carmel College, the most recent of which were Grease, Jesus Christ Superstar, Oliver, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. In 2017 the school put on a performance of Bugsy Malone in conjunction with Carmel College. Students of the College also formed the seminal New Zealand rock band, the Screaming Meemees.

Bell was a tail- end right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler. He made his first-class debut for Western Province in two matches in 1925–26 without making much impact, but returned to the team in the 1928–29 season. In his first match back, he took five Orange Free State wickets for 53 runs (and three more in the second innings). That and good performances in two other matches saw him selected for the 1929 South African tour of England. Tour to England in 1929 As a junior member of the team, Bell played in few of the early matches, but towards the end of May he took six Gloucestershire wickets for 68 in the match at Bristol. He was then given limited opportunities in the first team in the matches leading up to the first Test match, for which he was not selected. Injuries before the second Test to the bowlers Neville Quinn and Cyril Vincent, however, meant that he was called up for the game at Lord's. He took his opportunity: in England's first innings, following an early three- wicket burst by Denys Morkel, and then a fourth wicket for the same player, Bell took the remaining six wickets at a cost of 99 runs. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote that Bell \\"maintained an excellent length and owed most of his success to his ability to make the ball swerve\\". The bowling analysis remained the best of Bell's Test career. He was not able to maintain that form, failing to take a wicket in England's second innings. But the performance, and the team's worsening injury crisis, meant he retained his place in the team for the third Test, played at Headingley. In this match, he was not successful with his bowling, but he made instead an unexpected impact with the bat: in South Africa's second innings, he came in at No 11, his customary place in the batting order, with the score on 172 for nine, a lead of only 80. He and Tuppy Owen-Smith, who made 129, then proceeded to add 103 runs for the final wicket in 65 minutes, with Bell's share an unbeaten 26, which remained his highest Test innings. The partnership was South Africa's highest for the 10th wicket and remained the record until beaten by AB de Villiers and Morne Morkel in 2010–11. Bell retained his place for the fourth match in the series, but was successful with neither ball nor bat and, after a heavy defeat for the South African team which settled the rubber in favour of England, he was dropped for the final game. In all first-class matches on the tour he took 61 wickets at an average of 27.83. Test cricket in South Africa In his first match in South African domestic cricket after the tour, for Western Province against Eastern Province, Bell produced the best innings and match figures of his career: eight for 34 in the first innings was followed by five for 27 in the second, with all 13 victims bowled. The following year, 1930–31, England toured South Africa, and Bell kept his name in front of the selectors by taking six for 44 (and three for 44 in the second innings) for Western Province against Griqualand West in one of a limited first-class fixture list outside the tour matches that season. Bell missed out on the first Test match, which was won narrowly by South Africa, but was called into the team for the second game on an easy-paced wicket at Cape Town; he caused a small flurry of excitement by taking three quick wickets, those of Maurice Leyland, Maurice Turnbull, and Percy Chapman in a small England middle-order collapse, but the game petered out to a draw. He retained his place for the rain-ruined third Test at Durban, but the South Africans took only one wicket in the whole match, and he was dropped after this game. He was recalled for the fifth match of the series, but again made little impact. The match proved to be the last that he played in South Africa. Test cricket overseas After 1930–31, Bell's first-class cricket was confined to two tours with the South African Test side, one to Australia and New Zealand in 1931–32 and the other to England in 1935, with a solitary further appearance for Rhodesia in 1938–39. Bell finally became a regular Test player on the tour to Australia and New Zealand, playing in all seven Tests on the tour. The first Test was heavily influenced by the weather, rain preventing play for two days after Australia had made a total of 450, including 226 by Donald Bradman, and the South Africans then losing by an innings. Bell was the most successful South African bowler with four wickets for 123 runs. Wisden noted that \\"Bell bowled splendidly throughout the long innings\\". In terms of the result, the second Test was similar, but there was no weather excuse this time, and the South Africans lost by an innings in three days: Bell was again the most successful South African bowler in Australia's single innings, taking five wickets for 140 runs. He was much less expensive and no less effective in Australia's first innings in the third match of the series: Bell and Quinn dismissed the hosts for 198, with Bell taking five for 69 and Quinn four for 42. However, he took only one wicket in the second innings when, with a total of 554, the Australians reasserted their dominance to win the game easily. The fourth match of the Australia series was dominated by two players: Bradman, who made an unbeaten 299 in Australia's first innings and Clarrie Grimmett, who took 14 wickets in the match. Bell was once again the most successful South African bowler and for the third match in succession took five wickets in an innings: he finished with figures of five for 142, though he failed once again to dismiss Bradman and did not take his wicket during the series. The fifth and final Test produced a similarly convincing victory for the Australians as all the other Tests, though the circumstances were very different: the South Africans were dismissed for totals of just 36 and 45 to lose by an innings to a total of just 153. Bell took three wickets for 52 runs, including the Australian captain Bill Woodfull for a first-ball duck; he also went in as nightwatchman in South Africa's second innings at the end of the first day (two innings of the match having already been completed) and stayed longer at the wicket, 45 minutes, than any of his colleagues in either innings except for Syd Curnow. Bell was comfortably the most successful South African bowler of the series, taking 23 wickets at an average of 27.26; the nearest to him in terms of both aggregate and average was Quinn was 13 wickets at 39.38. In contrast to the whitewash suffered in Australia, the South Africans won both games against New Zealand, though Bell was not personally successful, taking only three wickets in the two games. After the Australasian tour, Bell played no first-class cricket in any of the next three South African domestic cricket seasons. Yet he was picked for the 1935 tour to England and, in the first first-class match of the tour, took eight Worcestershire wickets for just 28 runs, including five for 22 in the second innings. Those, however, proved to be his best bowling figures of the season and he struggled with both form and fitness. He was not in the side for the first Test, but was recalled for the second match of the series at Lord's, where South Africa recorded their first- ever victory over England in England; Bell's own contribution was limited and he took only one wicket. He was a little more prominent in the third Test, taking three second innings wickets and bowling tightly when England were pushing for quick runs. And there were three further wickets for him in England's first innings in the fourth Test. On the final day of the match, however, he was unable to bowl because of what Wisden reported as \\"fluid on the elbow\\". The injury effectively ended his tour: he returned for one more match against Essex but was again unable to bowl on the last day of the match because of his injured elbow. On the tour as a whole, Bell had taken 52 first- class wickets at an average of 22.03 runs per wicket. Bell played only one further first-class match after this, appearing for Rhodesia against the MCC team in 1938–39 and taking two expensive wickets in a game severely restricted by the weather.

Travelling west, Stanley is the second-last major township on the north-west coast of Tasmania, Smithton being the larger township in the Circular Head municipality. According to the , Stanley had a population of 553. History 1936 Stamp: Cable to Tasmania depicting Amphitrite Stanley, Tasmania, as seen from the top of The Nut In 1825 the Van Diemen's Land Company was granted land in north-western Van Diemen's Land, including the Stanley area. Employees of the company from England settled in the area in October 1826. The site (originally called Circular Head) was named after Lord Stanley, the British Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in the 1830s and 1840s, who later had three terms of office as British Prime Minister. A port opened in 1827 and the first school opened in 1841. There was a short-lived bay whaling station in operation on the fore-shore in the 1830s. Stanley officially became a town in 1842 and by 1843 more than 8,000 acres had been sold or leased to almost 70 people.Jones, E 2015, Along the terrace: the owners and occupiers of Stanley 1843–1922, Stanley Discovery Museum, Stanley, Tasmania, p. vii The Post Office opened on 1 July 1845 and was known as Circular Head post office until 1882. In 1880 the first coach service between Stanley and Burnie was established. In 1936 a submarine telephone cable from Apollo Bay to Stanley provided the first telephone to Tasmania from the mainland. The town today Today Stanley is a tourist destination and the main fishing port on the north-west coast of Tasmania. The most distinctive landmark in Stanley is Munatrik, commonly called The Nut an old extinct volcano. Bass and Flinders sighted it on their circumnavigation of Van Diemen's Land (now called Tasmania) in 1798 and named it Circular Head. It has steep sides and rises to 143 metres with a flat top. It is possible to walk to the top of The Nut via a steep track or via a chairlift. Tourists regularly travel to Highfield (a farming region on the north west of the township) to view the picturesque northern beaches with The Nut in the background. The port on the southern side of The Nut is also a regularly used fishing spot. Notable people associated with Stanley * John Lee Archer - the \\"Father of Tasmanian architecture\\".

They are being used for military purposes and for high performance racing boats as well as model racing boats. This article distinguishes a supercavitating propeller from a subcavitating propeller running under supercavitating conditions. In general, subcavitating propellers become less efficient when they are running under supercavitating conditions. The supercavitating propeller operates submerged with the entire diameter of the blade below the water line. Its blades are wedge-shaped to force cavitation at the leading edge and to avoid water skin friction along the whole forward face. As the cavity collapses well behind the blade, the supercavitating propeller avoids the spalling damage due to cavitation that is a problem with conventional propellers. An alternative to the supercavitating propeller is the surface piercing, or ventilated propeller. These propellers are designed to intentionally leave the water and entrain atmospheric air to fill the void, which means that the resulting gas layer on the forward face of the propeller blade consists of air instead of water vapour. Less energy is thus used, and the surface-piercing propeller generally enjoys lower drag than the supercavitating principle. The surface-piercing propeller also has wedge- shaped blades, and propellers may be designed that can operate in both supercavitating and surface-piercing mode. Supercavitating propellers were developed to usefulness for very fast military vessels by Vosper & Company. The pioneer of this technology and other high speed offshore boating technologies was Albert Hickman (1877–1957), early in the 20th century. His Sea Sled designs used a surface piercing propeller.

Early cricket career Born in Germiston, Transvaal, McMillan was a right- handed middle- or lower-order batsman and a right-arm leg-break and googly bowler. He had a curious first-class cricket career in that only nine of his 50 first-class matches were played in his native South Africa and five of those were Test matches; there were 25 games on the 1929 tour to England and 16 on the tour to Australia and New Zealand in 1931–32. He started with three matches for Transvaal cricket team in the series of games around Christmas that took the place of the Currie Cup in the 1928–29 season, and was immediately successful. In his first game, he made 61 against Eastern Province and followed that with bowling figures of three for 24 and six for 48 in an innings victory inside two days. He followed that in the very next match with an innings of 185 not out, including a stand of 265 for the fourth wicket with Jock Cameron, against Orange Free State. The innings proved to be the highest of his first-class career and his only century. Tour to England On the 1929 South African cricket tour to England, McMillan took more first-class wickets, 91, than any other bowler and he also made 749 first-class runs, mostly batting in the lower-order. Yet he was largely overlooked for the Test matches, playing only in the second game of the five-match series, when Cyril Vincent was injured, and in the last game when the series was already lost. In early matches, he took five wickets for 36 in Glamorgan's second innings, but was overshadowed by Vincent's match figures of 11 for 89. And against Cambridge University he took five for 45. McMillan's Test debut came at Lord's but as a bowler he was unable to make any impact, failing to take a wicket; he scored 17 in his only innings. His Test innings, according to later reports, included a hit for six off England captain and off-spinner Jack White which landed on the head of a lieutenant-general in the stands. Vincent was fit again for the third and fourth Tests, but immediately after the fourth Test, McMillan took eight first-innings wickets for 50 runs against Somerset and 10 for 86 in the match. This led to his recall for the final Test of the series at The Oval and, on a batsman's wicket, he did better than he had done at Lord's, taking three wickets for 78 runs in England's innings and then making an unbeaten 50 in a big South African total. This was to be his only Test match half-century. Home series against England Back home in South Africa, McMillan all but disappeared from first-class cricket outside Tests. There was a single appearance in the 1929–30 season and none at all in the 1930–31 season, apart from the five Test matches against England touring team, where he played in every match. The first game prived to be decisive in the series: South Africa won by 28 runs and all the other games in the series were drawn. McMillan's contribution to the victory came with bat rather than ball. With South Africa reduced to 81 for nine wickets, McMillan and last batsman Bob Newson put on 45 for the 10th wicket, and McMillan was left unbeaten on 45, his highest score of the series, when Newson was bowled by Maurice Tate. He scored 14 in the second innings but took only one English wicket. The second Test was a high-scoring draw, and McMillan took five wickets in the match at a cost of 35 runs apiece. The third match was ruined by rain, and McMillan contributed little with either bat or ball. In the fourth Test, there were a couple of wickets from him and some useful runs in the second innings when, after a competitive declaration by England, South Africa was fleetingly in danger of losing the match. With South Africa needing only to draw the final Test to secure the series victory, McMillan again chipped in with scores of 29 not out and 28, and a couple of wickets as a slow match drifted to a draw. In the series as a whole, McMillan had contributed 180 runs at an average of 30 and 10 wickets at an average of 40.90. Tour to Australia and New Zealand Though McMillan's Test figures had been modest, he was cited as \\"the best slow bowler of the tourists\\" in a syndicated Louis Duffus article in Australian newspapers at the start of the 1931–32 tour to Australia and New Zealand. The same article described him as \\"short and tubby\\". In fact, the tour marked the end of McMillan's first-class cricket career, and it began very well for him, with a career-best bowling performance of nine wickets for 53 runs in South Australia's second innings in one of the warm-up matches before the first Test. That Test, by contrast, was a personal failure: he failed to score in either innings and took no wickets in 10 expensive overs as Donald Bradman hit the first of four centuries (in five innings) in the series. McMillan was dropped for the second Test, but returned for the third match of the rubber. He took no wickets in the first innings, but then scored 29 and shared in an eighth wicket partnership of 104 with Ken Viljoen in South Africa's first innings. He followed that with four wickets for 150 in Australia's second innings, his best in Test cricket to that point. The fourth Test was not a success for McMillan: he made scores of 19 and 3 and took no wickets. And though there were three wickets for him for 29 runs in the fifth and final Test, the match was decided by South Africa's batting woes in difficult conditions, which saw the whole team dismissed first for 36 and then for 45; McMillan recorded his second \\"pair\\" of the series. Having lost the Australian series 5–0, the South Africans then moved on to New Zealand to play two Test matches against much less demanding opposition, winning both games. McMillan had his two best Test bowling performances in these games. In the first of them, he took four for 61 in the first innings and followed that with five for 66 in the second innings. In the second match he took five for 125 in the first innings and a further two wickets in the second. End of cricket career The second Test in New Zealand was McMillan's final game of first- class cricket. He did not appear in South African domestic cricket in later seasons. He retired to a career in business and died 3 July 1948 in Randfontein, Transvaal, aged 44.

He was born in Rustenburg, Transvaal and died at Auckland Park, also in Transvaal. Van der Merwe was a lower-order right-handed batsman and wicketkeeper whose first-class cricket career extended over 11 years and included two important tours in the South African team, but which amounted to only 27 matches in all. He had played only three times for Transvaal when he was picked as the second wicketkeeper to Jock Cameron on the 1929 tour of England. With Cameron one of the key players of the team, his opportunities were limited and he played in only 14 of the 34 first-class matches on the tour, but they included the third Test match at Headingley, as Cameron had not recovered from being knocked unconscious while batting against Harold Larwood in the preceding Test at Lord's. Van der Merwe took two catches and, batting at No 10, scored 19 and 1. But Cameron, a far better batsman, resumed his place in the side for the next match in the series. The last game of the sequence of five consecutive tour matches played by van der Merwe while Cameron was injured was the first-class game against Scotland at Perth, and, still batting at No 10, he made an unbeaten 35, and this would prove to be the highest score of his career. Van der Merwe returned to South Africa after the England tour, but his cricket over the next two seasons was only intermittent: one match for Transvaal in 1929–30 and two, both for Transvaal against the England touring team, in 1930–31. But in 1931–32 he was chosen again for an overseas tour as Cameron's deputy wicketkeeper: this time the tour to Australia and New Zealand. As in England in 1929, van der Merwe was not called on for many games: he played in only three first-class matches, none of them on the New Zealand leg of the tour, and none in Tests. After this tour, van der Merwe disappeared from first-class cricket for four years. He was recalled in 1935–36, straight into the South African Test team for the fifth and final match in the Australian series. Cameron had died suddenly on his return from the 1935 tour of England and his deputy on that tour, Robert Williams, had remained in England. In the first four matches of the Australian series, wicketkeeping had been in the hands of Frank Nicholson; he had taken only three catches in the four games, and fielding lapses were cited as a reason the series was being lost. Van der Merwe was unable to stop the losses, and took only one catch in his single match, scoring 7 not out and 0 as Australia won by an innings. This proved to be van der Merwe's final Test appearance; and he made only three more first-class appearances for Transvaal in the 1937–38 season before leaving cricket.

Maxell cassette type demagnetizer HE-44. Over time, the passage of magnetically-charged cassette tape over the metallic parts of the tape deck will impart a magnetic polarity that can impair the ability of subsequent tapes to record accurately. Cassette demagnetizers (sometimes known as degaussers) were developed to remove this polarity. Cassette demagnetizers of the \\"cassette\\" type physically resemble a cassette tape shell but contain circuitry to demagnetize the tape heads of the tape deck. Another type of demagnetizer, the \\"wand\\" type can demagnetize anything that it is brought into contact with, including the tape heads and capstans. Nakamichi manufactured a \\"wand\\" type demagnetizer in the 1980s. This design had the advantage that it could be used to demagnetize other metal parts of the tape path (not just the actual record/playback heads) however it required careful use (to avoid increasing the magnetization of the heads) and if used too close to actual cassette tapes could inadvertently act as a \\"bulk eraser\\". Demagnetizers contain electronic circuitry and require a power source — either a battery or a power cord. A third design consisted of a cassette shell with a head cleaning tape wound on the spools and a disc shaped magnet mounted above the head cleaner tape such that when the play button was activated the head cleaner physically cleaned the head surface and simultaneously made the magnet rotate, creating the alternating magnetic field required for demagnetizing. Some cassette deck manufacturers even produced decks with a self-demagnetize button. These worked by feeding the record head with a strong high frequency signal, which was gradually reduced in amplitude to zero over a few seconds.

He was born in Benoni, Transvaal and died at Perth, Western Australia, having emigrated there in the early 1970s. His father was W. S. Curnow, a South African mining engineer, and his mother was a Miss Francis McAuliffe who came from Launceston, Tasmania. Test cricket Curnow was a right-handed opening batsman. He made his first-class debut for Transvaal in 1928–29. In his third first-class match, the first of the 1929–30 season, he hit 99 against Natal. He followed this up with 108 in the next match, which was against Griqualand West. Then in his third match of the season he made 162 against Orange Free State. There was no Test cricket in South Africa that season, but the following year, England toured, and Curnow made an unbeaten 83 in an early-season match against the touring side. That led to his selection for the first Test match of the five-game series, but he was not a success, scoring just 13 and 8. He was dropped for the second Test, but reappeared in the South Africa side for the third and fourth Tests. In the first of these games he made 2 and 9; in the second, his scores were 7 and 12. He was dropped for the fifth Test, having scored just 51 runs in six innings in his first series. Despite this modest record, he was picked for the South African tour to Australia and New Zealand in 1931–32, and decent scores in warm-up matches brought him back to the Test team for the first game of the five-match series. Again, he was not successful, scoring 11 and 8 – the second innings 8 taking him 71 minutes against the wiles of the 49-year-old Bert Ironmonger, who took nine wickets in the match. Dropped for the second Test, he came back into favour after an innings of 158 in a non-first-class game against a Victoria Country XI where, despite the doubtful calibre of the opposition bowling attack, the other South African front-line batsmen failed. That brought him back into the Test team for the third Test and at last, in his fifth Test match, he made some runs, scoring 47 in the first innings and 9 in the second: the 47 would prove to be his best Test score. The success was fleeting: in the fourth Test, he was out for 20 and 3. The fifth game of the series was Curnow's last-ever Test appearance and one of the most remarkable Tests of all time: a \\"timeless\\" match, spread out, because of bad weather, over three days but amounting in all to only five hours and 33 minutes of cricket, in which South Africa were dismissed in the first innings for 36 all out and then for 45 all in the second innings. Perversely, Curnow emerged from the match with some credit: his second innings 16, following a first innings 3, was South Africa's highest score of the match and the only double-figure score of the second innings (Jock Cameron had scored 11 in the first innings). Ironmonger took 11 wickets in the match and Clarrie Grimmett, who had taken 33 wickets in the first four games of the series, did not even get to bowl. The South African team moved on from Australia to play matches in New Zealand, including two Tests, but Curnow was not picked for any of the games there. Later career After the tour to Australia and New Zealand, Curnow was a part-time and domestic-only cricketer, restricted to a few appearances each season always around the Christmas period. On his return to domestic cricket in South Africa in 1932–33 he had his most successful season, with 641 runs in four matches and a batting average of 91.57. In the first match of the season for Transvaal against Western Province he made an unbeaten 192 to lead his team to a six-wickets victory after they had been 156 behind on the first innings. Then a week later in a first-class match between North and South he made 224, the highest score of his career. But he was less successful in 1933–34 and 1934–35, failing to pass 50 in either season and he did not feature in the 1935 tour to England. He continued to play sporadically through to the Second World War, making centuries in three of the four seasons between 1936 and 1940, with a further century in a wartime first-class match in 1942–43. When more normal cricket resumed in 1945–46, he played three further games for Transvaal, but with limited success, and those were his final games in first- class cricket.

It is one of over 70 nationally organised sections or national offices of the global Amnesty movement. The first New Zealand Amnesty group was founded in 1965, and the organisation was incorporated in 1966. Since being founded, the organisation has worked to free prisoners of conscience, fight human rights violations around the world, and promote human rights in New Zealand through lobbying and education. It works to achieve human rights for everyone as defined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international standards for human rights. It now has 9,000 members. Amnesty International New Zealand acts primarily with a focus on rights within the Asia-Pacific region, and is a consulting member of the Council for International Development and part of the Human Rights Network of Aotearoa New Zealand. Structure Amnesty International New Zealand is financially independent from all governments and corporations, funded entirely by individual supporters. The International Movement is made up of 70 “sections” or national offices with 8.5 million fee-paying members. Its Secretariat is based in London although it has many offices around the world. In Asia- Pacific, it has offices in Hong Kong, Bangkok and Colombo. It is led at the New Zealand national level by the Governance Team; members are elected by members at the Annual General Meeting and help set out policy and strategic goals that guide operations. Its current chair is Ros Noonan with Heather Hayden its deputy. The immediate past chair, Tiumalu Peter Fa'afiu, was the first Chair of Pacific descent for any Section in the international movement's 52-year history. In August 2019, Peter was appointed Global Director on Amnesty’s International Board making him only the third New Zealander to sit on the IB and the first of Polynesian descent. The New Zealand office is located in Auckland, and run by Executive Director / CEO, Meg de Ronde. The office comprises a campaigning team, fundraising team, and general operations team, with both paid and volunteer staff. Campaigns Current priority campaigns include Crisis Response, Stop Torture, Refugees Crisis, and Individuals at Risk. Amnesty International New Zealand also works to end human rights violations in the Asia-Pacific region and promote human rights awareness in New Zealand. Crisis Response Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand works to respond to global crises as they occur. Its current campaigns are to end human rights abuses in Israel and Gaza, Syria, Egypt and Central African Republic. Stop Torture Amnesty International is working worldwide for governments to end the practice of torture. It is actively lobbying the governments of Mexico, Nigeria and the Philippines to ban torture. Individuals at Risk When individuals suffer grave human rights abuses, Amnesty International New Zealand takes action for their support. Recent successes include the release of Meriam Ibrahim, condemned to death in Sudan for apostasy; Nasrin Sotoudeh, an imprisoned Iranian human rights lawyer; and a reduced sentence for Dr Tun Aung, an imprisoned community leader in Myanmar. Refugees and Asylum Seekers Amnesty International campaigns to ensure the rights of refugees and asylum seekers are protected by working to prevent human rights violations that cause people to flee their homes. At the same time, it opposes the forcible return of any individual to a country where he or she faces serious human rights violations. One such case is of former Islamic Salvation Front member Ahmed Zaoui, who was seeking asylum in New Zealand. Amnesty International didn't take a position on whether Ahmed Zaoui is guilty of the charges laid against him, but argued that he had not received fair criminal trials in Algeria, Belgium, or France, and that Switzerland's rejection of his refugee claim and subsequent deportation to Burkina Faso was improper. Zaoui was bailed in 2004 and the New Zealand government withdrew objections to his refugee status in 2007. Asia- Pacific With no official Amnesty presence in the Pacific, Amnesty International New Zealand has a unique responsibility to protect human rights in the region. It campaigns to end violence against women in countries like Papua New Guinea with extremely high rates of sexual and gender-based violence, and works to protect freedom of expression in countries like Fiji. Other Campaigns Amnesty International strongly supports the creation of a United Nations treaty to control small arms. Amnesty International New Zealand gathered over 12,000 faces in a photo-petition it handed in to the New Zealand Government. Minister for Disarmament Phil Goff declared New Zealand's strong support for such a treaty after receiving the petition. New Zealand is the first nation in negotiations for a free trade agreement with China. As a result of this, and New Zealand's proximity to the nation, Amnesty International New Zealand is trying to highlight human rights in the People's Republic of China. The organisation is particularly concerned about freedom of speech issues, and censorship of the internet by the government and companies such as Google and Yahoo. The Darfur conflict in Sudan is one of Amnesty International's top priorities, as a result of the large-scale human rights abuses occurring. AIANZ has called for the introduction of a United Nations peacekeeping force to prevent conflict and stop further unnecessary suffering. Amnesty International also supports the implementation of the New Zealand Government's Action Plan for Human Rights. Following years of campaigning, the New Zealand government in September 2018 announced an increase of 500 more refugees to its refugee quota. International Board In August 2019, Peter Fa'afiu was elected to the International Board of the Global Movement. He is the third New Zealander and is the first Pacific Islander on the International Board.

He is best known for his publications in the history of psychiatry, including two critical volumes on the life and work of Carl Gustav Jung and his books and articles on the history of dementia praecox and schizophrenia. He is also known for his publications in anthropology on shamanism. His books and articles have been translated into fifteen foreign languages and he has delivered invited presentations in nineteen countries on six continents. He grew up in the Belton-Mark Twain Park neighborhood in southwest Detroit, Michigan (until April 1971), and in Phoenix, Arizona, where he received his high school education at Brophy College Preparatory, a Jesuit institution. From 1977 to 1979 he lived in Tucson and studied political science at the University of Arizona. In the fall of 1978 he spent a National Collegiate Honors Council semester at the United Nations in New York, returning to complete his B.A. in political science in May 1979. From 1979 to 1984 he was employed in the resettlement of Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian and Hmong refugees for both Church World Service and the International Rescue Committee in New York City. From 1985 to 1988 he was a staff psychologist on various wards at Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Hammonton, New Jersey. He received his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the New School for Social Research in 1992. His dissertation research was an experimental study of cognitive style differences between paranoid and nonparnoid schizophrenia, and was supervised by L. (\\"Nikki\\") Erlenmeyer-Kimling of the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Before assuming a position as a professor of psychology at DeSales University in August 2000, he taught and conducted research at Harvard University for four years as a postdoctoral fellow and as Lecturer on the History of Science. During the 1995–1996 academic year he was a Visiting Scholar at MIT and a Resident Fellow at the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology. On 25 December 2017 he was awarded a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Invitational Fellowship for Research in Japan. As a JSPS fellow, in June 2018 he delivered invited lectures on shamanism at the University of Shiga Prefecture in Hikone, the National Museum of Ethnology (MINPAKU) in Osaka, and at the Research Institute of Islands and Sustainability at the University of the Ryukyus in Naha, Okinawa. Together with anthropologist Ippei Shimamura, he also conducted fieldwork among the indigenous female yuta (mediums/shamans in Ryukyuan religion) on Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands and the ascetic monastic yamabushi / shugenja community on Mount Omine in Nara Prefecture who practice the form of Esoteric Buddhism known as Shugendo. While at the Ominesan-ji temple they observed a goma fire ritual involving the ritual invocation of Fudō Myōō 不動明王. Shugenja yamabushi monk, Ominesan-ji Temple, Mt. Omine, Nara, Japan, 20 June 2018 On 15 June 2018 he was appointed Honorary Visiting Professor by the University of Shiga Prefecture in Hikone, Japan. He was only the third scholar in the history of that university to be awarded that title. Previous awards went to Umesao Tadao, an anthropologist and founder of the National Museum of Ethnology (MINPAKU) in Osaka, and to Kenichi Fukui, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1981.  Scholarship on Carl Gustav Jung  In February 1995 Noll received an award for Best Professional/Scholarly Book in Psychology published in 1994 from the Association of American Publishers for his book, The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement. The resulting controversy over the book made front-page headlines worldwide, including a front-page report in the 3 June 1995 issue of The New York Times. Princeton University Press submitted The Jung Cult to the Pulitzer Prize competition that year, without success. The background to the controversy over Noll's research on Jung can be found in the \\"Preface of the New Edition\\" of The Jung Cult published in paperback by Free Press Paperbacks in 1997 and in an article he wrote for a Random House, Inc., promotional publication, At Random, in that same year. An August 2016 interview with Noll added new details. At the urging of the Jung family and estate, Princeton University Press cancelled the publication of a second book edited by Noll which had already made it into final page proofs form, Mysteria: Jung and the Ancient Mysteries: Selections from the Writings of C.G. Jung (). A pdf of the page proofs containing only Noll's contributions to the book is available online. A summary of his controversial conclusions was outlined in a short piece in The Times Higher Education Supplement on 22 November 1996. Noll also summarized his views in a 7 October 1997 interview by Terry Gross on NPR's \\"Fresh Air.\\" The full broadcast is available on the NPR website. https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1109865 In his intellectual history of the 20th century, historian Peter Watson noted that \\"[Noll's] books provoked a controversy no less bitter than the one over Freud . . . .\\" Frederick Crews lauded The Jung Cult as \\"an important study.\\"Crews, Frederick. Follies of the Wise: Dissenting Essays. New York: Counterpoint, 2007 (page 247). Noll was praised for his \\"groundbreaking analyses\\" of Jung's life and work by cultural historian Wouter Hanegraaff in his comprehensive 1996 study of New Age religion.Wouter J. Hanegraaff, New Age Religion and Western Culture: Esotericism in the Mirror of Secular Thought (Leiden: Brill, 1996) page 497 In a recent work, noting the absence of any reference to Noll's scholarship on Jung in the publications of prominent Jung historians in the decade after the backlash to Noll ended after 2005, Hanegraaff remarked, \\"Unfortunately, Noll's historical scholarship is simply discarded along with the 'cult' thesis . . . .\\"Wouter J. Hanegraaff, Esotericism and the Academy: Restricted Knowledge in Western Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014), page 283. This absence has also been noted by other critics of Noll's work. According to an article by Sara Corbett, \\"The Holy Grail of the Unconscious,\\" published in The New York Times Magazine on Sunday, 20 September 2009, the Jung family's fear of \\"the specter of Richard Noll\\" was cited as a contributing factor in the decision to allow Jung's \\"Red Book\\" to be edited and published by W.W. Norton in October 2009. The most significant academic criticism of Noll's scholarship and conclusions came from the historian of psychology Sonu Shamdasani. In his 1998 book Cult Fictions, Shamdasani disputed the attribution and interpretation of a central item of documentary evidence adduced by Noll, and also challenged the claim that Jung established a 'cult'.Sonu Shamdasani, Cult Fictions: C. G. Jung and the Founding of Analytical Psychology (London: Routledge, 1998) p. 107 However, documents deposited by Noll in 2014 in the Cummings Center for the History of Psychology in Akron, Ohio, reveal that prior to the publication of Noll's book in September 1994 Shamdasani and John Kerr held nearly identical views to Noll's concerning the cult hypothesis, the importance of Jung's deification experiences, and the interpretation of the contested document as authored by Jung. Shamdasani's letter to Noll of 29 July 1992 and Princeton University Press editor Eric Rohmann's fax to Shamdasani dated 11 March 1994 in the Cummings archives document this. Both Shamdasani and Kerr pressured Noll and the editors of Princeton University Press to remove the document prior to the publication of the book. \\"We cannot ask Richard to remove this document simply because you have also read it and interpreted it as being what Richard presents it as, i.e., the inaugural address at the Zurich Psychological Club,\\" wrote Rohmann to Shamdasani. Having lost this battle, Shamdasani later argued that the document was actually authored by Jung's associate Maria Molzer. However, Noll himself had previously raised this as a possible alternative interpretation. In a letter to Noll from Shamdasani dated 29 July 1992, which resides in the collections of the Cummings Center for the History of Psychology in Akron, Ohio, Shamdasani wrote: \\" . . . in focusing on the deification experience and the forming of a cult, you are more right than you realise.\\" This quote was referenced without full citation in a book by historian of religion Carrie B. Dohe. In a book review published on 17 January 2020 in the Los Angeles Review of Books classicist Gregory Shaw credited Noll for being the first to document in 1994 that Jung's concept of \\"individuation\\" was actually a recipe for \\"deification.\\"https://marginalia.lareviewofbooks.org/the-cry-of-merlin-carl- jung-and-the-insanity-of-reason/ Further critics emerged among Jung's family, Jungian analysts and others who were self-identified Jungians. Franz Jung, the son of C.G. Jung, reportedly told a German journalist that Noll's work was \\"Mist\\" (bullshit).Richard Noll, At Random(Fall 1997), p. 59,https://www.academia.edu/6662539/_A_Christ_Named_Carl_Jung_Fall_1997_ In 1999 Anthony Stevens (Jungian analyst) added an \\"Afterword\\" to the second edition of his book, On Jung, entitled \\"Jung's Adversary: Richard Noll.\\" Using the term \\"adversary\\" as an allusion to the Biblical \\"Satan,\\" Stevens wrote that it was necessary to counter \\"the gravest of Richard Noll's charges\\" because, \\"I believe . . . he has been so effective in promoting his ideas that there is a danger that they will enter public consciousness as received wisdom\\" and tarnish \\"Jung's memory\\" and \\"the whole tradition of psychotherapy practiced in his name.\\"Anthony Stevens, On Jung: An Updated Edition with a Reply to Jung's Critics(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1999, p. 275. In a video of a 2014 classroom lecture on Jung posted on YouTube, University of Toronto professor and clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson characterized Noll as \\"crooked.\\" He also incorrectly accused Noll of deliberately using \\"Nazi imagery\\" on the cover of his books to gain \\"economic utility,\\" when in fact no Nazi images appear in Noll's books. In a 1998 interview the noted Jungian analyst and \\"archetypal psychologist\\" James Hillman was asked by interviewer Cliff Bostock what he thought of Noll's books on Jung. \\"I hate them,\\" Hillman replied. \\"I think he's a shit.\\"Cliff Bostock, \\"James Hillman: On Richard Noll, Therapy and the Image,\\" Creative Loafing (Atlanta), 11 April 1998, http://www.soulworks.net/writings/paradigms/site_026.html  Criticism of American Psychiatry's Role in the Satanic Cult Moral Panic of the 1980s and 1990s He was an early public critic of the American psychiatric profession's complicity in the moral panic of the late 1980s and early 1990s concerning Satanic ritual abuse. \\"Except for the work of very few mental-health professionals, such as psychologist Richard Noll and psychiatrists George K. Ganaway and Frank W. Putnam, what little psychiatric writing has emerged on survivors and their therapy has uncritically embraced the literal truth of survivors' claims.\\" At the invitation of psychiatrist and researcher Frank Putnam, then the Chief of the Dissociative Disorders Unit at the National Institute of Mental Health, Noll was one of four members on a plenary session panel that opened the 7th International Conference on Multiple Personality/Dissociative States in Chicago on 9 November 1990. In a ballroom filled with television cameras and more than 700 conference participants (including feminist intellectual Gloria Steinem, who was a firm believer in the veracity of \\"recovered memories\\" of satanic ritual abuse) the members of the panel presented, for the first time in a public professional forum, a skeptical viewpoint concerning SRA reports. The panel cast doubt on the corroborating evidence for the thousands of claims from patients in treatment that they were recovering memories of childhood abuse at the hands of persons (often family members) who were members of satanic cults. Such satanic cults were claimed to be intergenerational in families and had been abusing and ritually sacrificing children in secret for almost 2000 years. When American psychiatrists published purported historical evidence supporting these beliefs in the peer-reviewed journal Dissociation in March 1989, Noll challenged their extraordinary claims in a subsequent issue. His December 1989 conclusion that SRA beliefs were \\"a modern version of (a) paranoid mass delusion -- and one in which all too many clinicians and law enforcement officials also share\\" was the first unambiguous skepticism of the moral panic to be published in a medical journal. It may have also been the first publication to explicitly link claims of recovered memory of satanic ritual abuse to claims of recovered memories of UFO abductions, the other cultural firestorm that was raging in American culture in the late 1980s. Noll continued his public skepticism elsewhere. Noll's 1990 panel presentation was an elaboration of this earlier published critique. Other members of the 1990 conference panel were anthropologist Sherrill Mulhern and psychiatrist George Ganaway. Noll's participation on the panel was viewed by SRA believers as part of a deliberate disinformation campaign by Frank Putnam, who was skeptical of the reality of satanic cults. This set Putnam apart from other prominent American psychiatrists who were less critical, such as conference organizer Bennett G. Braun, a member of the Dissociative Disorders work group for the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual, DSM-III-R (1987). According to an account based on interviews, \\"conference attendees characterized (Noll) as a professional expendable who had no idea he was being used. Through him, they contended, Putnam could cast doubt on the contentious issue of linking MPD to ritual abuse.\\" However, Noll's skeptical presentation did have an effect: \\"Mulhern and Noll cut a line through the therapeutic community. A minority joined them in refusing to believe sacrificial murder was going on; the majority still believed their patients' accounts.\\" Psychiatric Times published Noll's memoir of the 1990 conference online on 6 December 2013.Noll, Richard.

Along with the article was commentaries by three American psychiatrists who were discussed in the article as well a response from Noll.Ivan Oransky, \\"Psychiatric Times reinstates retracted essay on 'satanic ritual abuse'\\", 25 March 2014 Allen Frances added additional comments reproducing his blog posts from other websites. In April 2014 Douglas Misicko (alias Doug Mesner, alias Lucien Greaves), co-founder of the international nontheistic religion and political activist organization The Satanic Temple, published a lengthy article on his website Dysgenics in support of Noll's stance against mental health professionals who promote satanic cult conspiracies and the discredited \\"recovered memory\\" psychotherapy. Mesner's initial formation of The Satanic Temple on a Facebook page in 2013 was inspired by his longstanding public opposition to SRA proponents and the fact they continued to exist long after scientific and legal challenges had discredited their claims. Along with religion scholars Massimo Introvigne and Joseph Laycock, on 14 July 2018 Noll participated in a panel discussion entitled \\"Scholars Confront The Satanic Temple\\" at the Salem Art Gallery in Salem, Massachusetts, and publicly affirmed his strong support for the Grey Faction and The Protect Children Project initiatives of TST. The controversy drew to a close in August 2014 with two letters to the editors of Psychiatric Times in response to an article by psychologist and attorney Christopher Barden who sharply criticized Noll for failing to address the \\"repressed/recovered memory\\" controversy and the fact that legal challenges in the courts effectively ended the ability of mental health professionals to perpetuate the moral panic.R.

But perhaps they should. Cautionary tales may prevent the recurrence of pyrogenic cultural fantasies and the devastating clinical mistakes they inspire.\\"  Anthropological fieldwork  Chuonnasuan, the last shaman of the Oroqen. In 1994 Richard Noll and his colleague from Ohio State University, anthropologist Kun SHI, explored Manchuria (just south of the Amur river, the natural border with Russian Siberia) and Inner Mongolia and interviewed the last living Tungus Siberian shamans who had openly practiced prior to being forced to abandon their nomadic life and spirits after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. All visual media, fieldwork notes and other supporting correspondence and documents from this project became part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Studies Film Archives in October 2014. The story of the life, initiatory illnesses, and shamanic training of the last living shaman of the Oroqen people, Chuonnasuan (1927–2000), was published in 2004 in the Journal of Korean Religions and is also available online. It describes the life of Chuonnasuan, the last shaman of the Oroqen of Northeast China. Noll's photograph of Chuonnasuan appears as the fronticepiece in Le chamanisme de Siberie et d'Asie centrale (Paris: Gallimard, 2011) by anthropologists Charles Stepanoff (l'Ecole practique des hautes etudes, Paris) and Thierry Zarcone (also EPHE [Sorbonne], Paris). A second published report of this fieldwork concerning the life and training of the Solon Ewenki shamaness Dula'r (Ao Yun Hua) (born 1920) appeared in the journal Shaman in 2007 (15: 167-174). The Wenner-Gren Foundation supported the fieldwork that produced these reports. The rationale for the research was provided in a 1985 article in Current Anthropology which examined the ethnographic literature on shamanism from the perspective of cognitive science. Tanya Luhrmann, the Watkins University Professor of Anthropology at Stanford University, lauded Noll's 1985 article as a novel turning point in the anthropological study of religion.t.M. Luhrmann and Rachel Morgain, \\"Prayer as Inner sense Cultivation: An Attentional Learning Theory of spiritual Experience,\\" Ethos, 2012, 40 (4): 359-389 T.M. Luhrmann, \\"Hallucinations and Sensory Overrides,\\" Annual Review of Anthropology, 2011, 40:71-85 In June 2017 Noll and Canadian psychologist Leonard George of Capilano University conducted fieldwork in Mongolia and observed the practices of shamans and Buddhist lamas who follow the Tibetan (Vadrayana) tradition and practice visualization meditations. Their fieldwork was conducted in both the Ulaanbaatar area and near Sainshand in the southeastern Gobi Desert in Dornogovi Province. Both Noll and George delivered presentations to the Institute of Philosophy of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulaanbaatar at the invitation of Chuluunbaatar Gelegpil, Mongolia's Minister of Education and Culture. Video clips by Noll of the multi-hour summer solstice \\"fire ritual\\" for the Ulaan Tergel (literally \\"Red Disk\\") performed by Mongol shamans which was held out on the steppes 15 km from Ulaanbaatar on 21 June 2017 can be found on YouTube Noll and George were invited to this event by Jargalsaikhan, the head of the Mongolian Corporate Union of Shamans. According to the Austrian Mongolist Walther Heissig (1913-2005), this same \\"renewal of life\\" ritual is recorded in the earliest historical reports concerning the Mongols from the 11th and 12th centuries and was performed by Genghis Khan (1162-1227): \\"A great festival of religious character was the 'Day of the Red Disk,' the summer solstice on the sixteenth day of the first month of summer.\\" Mongol shamans in a \\"fire ritual\\" to celebrate the summer solstice (Ulaan Tergel) on the night of 21 June 2017 Noll was introduced to both the scholarly study and techniques of shamanism in the fall of 1980 by the anthropologist Michael Harner, then a professor at the New School for Social Research in New York City. \\"Noll has trained with me firsthand in the classic shamanic methods,\\" wrote Harner.Michael Harner. Comment. Current Anthropology1985, 26(4): 452.  Scholarship on the history of dementia praecox and schizophrenia  Noll's most recent book, American Madness: The Rise and Fall of Dementia Praecox, was published by Harvard University Press in October 2011. A brief interview with Noll appears on the Harvard University Press Blog (30 January 2012). In April 2012 it was announced that American Madness: The Rise and Fall of Dementia Praecox was the winner of the 2012 Cheiron Book Prize from Cheiron, International Society for the History of the Behavioral and Social Sciences. On 13 September 2012 it was announced in London that American Madness: The Rise and Fall of Dementia Praecox won a 2012 BMA Medical Book Award - Highly Commended in Psychiatry from the British Medical Association. In March 2013 Scientific American Mind incorporated findings from American Madness in its print and online \\"timeline\\" on the history of schizophrenia. A brief favorable review of the book, along with a photo of its cover, appeared in the 27 October 2011 issue of Nature. \\"Tales of personal drama enliven Noll's story in a way that few would imagine possible for a historical account of nosology,\\" said a reviewer in the American Journal of Psychiatry. According to sociologist Andrew Scull in the Journal of American History, \\"Richard Noll's American Madness is an important book that deserves a wide readership among those interested in understanding the development of American psychiatry between 1896 and the 1930s.\\" In a September 2012 review in Isis historian John C. Burnham noted, \\"It is clearly written and is based on a remarkably thorough literature search and reading of primary sources. . . . Noll's book will become a useful narrative for much of the modern history of psychiatry in the United States.\\" He further added, \\"the research and thinking that went into this book make it refreshing and valuable.\\"  Collaborative biomarkers research on schizophrenia  Since 2011 Noll has occasionally collaborated with an interdisciplinary group of schizophrenia researchers at the Bahn Laboratory at the University of Cambridge (UK) and the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam (the Netherlands). Their research program seeks to identify valid biomarkers that might serve as molecular endophenotypes of schizophrenia and become the basis of a valid biological diagnostic test for psychosis and its developmental risk factors.Sabina bahn, Richard Noll, Anthony Barnes, Emmanuel Schwarz, and Paul C.

Career  Newson was a lower-order right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. He had a 20-year first-class cricket career, but as the career included two gaps of more than six years without a single first-class game (one of the gaps being the Second World War), he totalled only 24 matches in all, including his three Test appearances. Newson had played just three first-class matches for Transvaal when he was picked for the first Test of the 1930–31 series against England at the age of just 20. According to his obituary in the 1989 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he had not been notified of his selection and arrived at work on the morning of the Test as normal; his father brought his clothes to the ground in time for the start, but Newson appeared in the official match photograph in borrowed cricket gear. He batted at No 11 and in the first innings scored 10 out of a last-wicket partnership of 45 with Quintin McMillan; but he failed to take a wicket in a narrow South African victory by 28 runs, and was dropped for the next game. He did not play again that season and after two matches for Transvaal the following season he dropped out of cricket altogether for more than six years. He reappeared in the Transvaal side at the end of the 1937–38 season and, after a couple of matches the following year, was back in the South African Test team for the fourth and fifth Tests against England in 1938–39, having taken only 21 wickets in his career and with best bowling figures to that point of just four wickets for 51 runs. In the fourth Test, which was drawn, he took one wicket in each England innings and scored 16 in South Africa's only innings. The final Test was a timeless Test, though it ended as a draw after 10 days' cricket (one of them rained off) when the English team had to leave to catch their ship home; Newson scored 1 and 3 and took two wickets in England's first innings, but failed to take any in the final innings of 654 for five. Newson played two more games for Transvaal in 1939–40 but then first-class cricket was suspended for the war. After the war, Newson played for Rhodesia for four seasons as an all-rounder. Captaining the Rhodesia side in the match against Griqualand West in 1946–47 he scored 114, batting at No 3. And two seasons later, when the 1948–49 England team visited Rhodesia for two matches, he took five wickets in an innings for the only time in his career.

History When the Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt, Ras Muhammad was declared for protection from fishing and other human activities. Some of the fishing methods, such as using dynamite and knives also were impacting the coral reef and the fish populations. In 1983, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) established the area as a marine reserve for the protection of marine and terrestrial wildlife. The park was also established to protect against urban sprawl from Sharm El Sheikh and other coastal development. The name literally means \\"Mohammad's Head\\", where \\"head\\" in this instance means \\"headland\\". There is a saying in the area that the name arose because in side view the contour of the cliff looks like the profile of a bearded man's face, with horizontal hard strata providing the nose and bearded chin. Geography The park is situated in the tourist region of the Red Sea Riviera, located 12 km from the city of Sharm El Sheikh. The park spans an area of 480 km2, including 135 km2 of surface land area and 345 km2 area over water. Marsa Bareika is a small bay inlet in Ras Mohammed, and Marsa Ghozlani is a very small inlet located across from the park visitors center. Winch parts visible on the wreck of the SS Thistlegorm, which sunk off the coast of Ras Muhammad Ras Mohammad encompasses two islands, Tiran and Sanafir. Tiran Island is located approximately 6 km offshore from the Sinai Peninsula. Underwater caves formed as the result of earthquakes are located in Ras Mohammad. About 0.9 hectare of mangrove forest cover a 1.16 km shallow channel at the southernmost end of Ras Mohammad peninsula. Near the mangrove and approximately 150 m inland, there are open cracks in the land, caused by earthquakes. One of the cracks is approximately 40 m length and 0.20−1.5 m in width. Within the cracks, there are pools of water, some with a depth of over 14 m. The inland area includes a diversity of desert habitats such as mountains and wadis, gravel and coastal mud plains and sand dunes. The area also plays a role in bird migration, serving as a place of rest and nourishment. Climate Ras Mohammad National Park experiences a very dry climate, with only minimal rainfall during the winter. During the summer, temperatures often exceed 40 °C (104 °F) and low temperatures around 27 °C (81 °F). Temperatures are mild during the winter, with daytime high temperatures averaging around 23 °C (73 °F) and low temperatures 14 °C (56 °F). Ecology Coral reef, of the fringing and hermatypic types, exist along the coast around Ras Mohammad close to the shoreline. More than 220 species of coral are found in the Ras Mohammad area, 125 of them soft coral. The coral reefs are located 50 to 100 cm below the sea surface, and they have a width of 30 to 50 m in most places. Though in some spots on the western coast, the coral reef is 8 to 9 km wide. Shark Reef and Yolanda Reef are popular areas of coral reef in the park for divers. Other coral reef sites include South Bereika, Marsa Ghozlani, Old Quay, and Shark Observatory. The wreckage of the SS Thistlegorm, located off the coast of Ras Mohammad, is a popular area for divers. The area is home to more than 1000 species of fish, 40 species of star fish, 25 species of sea urchins, more than a 100 species of mollusc and 150 species of crustaceans. Among others, sea turtles, such as the green turtle (Chelonia mydas) and the hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) appear regularly in Ras Mohammad. On the Ras Mohammad peninsula, there are acacia trees and dum palms (Hyphaene thebaica) around the wadi mouths. Ephermal herbs and grasses also exist in Ras Muhammad.

He appeared for Rhodesia, Western Province, Worcestershire and South Africa. Though his Test bowling average lay over 37.00, Crisp had a successful first-class cricket career, with 276 wickets at 19.88. He is the only bowler in first-class cricket to have taken four wickets in four balls more than once. He went on to a career in journalism and writing, publishing several accounts of his career in World War II and earning a reputation as an adventurer. Cricket career=Domestic debut Crisp was born in Calcutta, Bengal in British India. He made sporadic appearances for Rhodesia between 1929 and 1931, taking only seven wickets before moving to Western Province for the 1931–32 season. He took 33 wickets that season at 14.93, including an eight-wicket haul against Griqualand West. He took three more five-wicket hauls in his 26 wicket-haul during the 1932–33 season, and scalped 27 more batsman in the 1933–34 season, including a career best 9/64 for Western Province. England tour Crisp toured England in 1935, taking 107 wickets in all at 19.58. He took 5/99 at Old Trafford for South Africa, to help earn his team their first victory in England. This was one of eight five-wicket hauls on the tour. Thirteen of those wickets came in his five Test matches, at 34.15. He returned to South Africa to take nine expensive wickets at 45.33 - seven of these in four Test matches against Australia before returning to England once more and taking a four-wicket haul in a first-class match that summer. He toured Ceylon and Malaya with Sir Julien Cahn's XI in the 1936–37 season, taking six wickets in the first-class match against Ceylon, before returning to England once more in 1938 to take 44 wickets for Worcestershire including a spell of 5/0. World War II and later life Crisp served during World War II in the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment, later writing two books documenting his experiences: The Gods Were Neutral and Brazen Chariots, the latter of which is considered one of the classic memoirs of tank warfare. These books covered his combat during the early part of the war. The Gods Were Neutral describes the British retreat in Greece in the spring of 1941. Brazen Chariots covers the period from the summer of 1941 through Crisp's participation in Operation Crusader, up to his wounding. He was decorated for his bravery during the North African campaign and after being wounded there, nearly died several times from shrapnel in his skull as well as subsequent infection. Bernard Montgomery, commanding, intervened to restrict Crisp's decorations given the latter's disrespect for authority. Crisp ended the war with a Military Cross, Distinguished Service Order, and four \\"Mentioned in Dispatches\\". Crisp was also noted for his womanising, \\"crooning in the nightclubs\\" of Alexandria and his wide-ranging travel - including climbing Mount Kilimanjaro (he is the only Test cricketer to have climbed it twice) and swimming Loch Lomond. He went on to a career as a journalist, writing for Wisden and several newspapers. He helped found Drum for black South Africans, sailed Greece, farmed minks in England and wrote for the East Anglian Daily Times. During the 1970s, Crisp was diagnosed with cancer and responded by walking around Crete for a year, supporting himself by selling his account to the Sunday Express. He remained outspoken on apartheid, advocating \\"a federation of semi-autonomous states, black and white\\" and arguing that \\"nothing else is feasible\\". The end of segregation \\"startled\\" him. He lived to see South Africa reintegrated into the international Test scene before dying in 1994. Books Crisp wrote a number of books, including: * The Gods Were Neutral: A British Tank Officer's Very Personal Account of the Ill-Fated Greek Campaign in WWII, 1959 * Brazen Chariots: An Account of Tank Warfare in the Western Desert, November–December 1941, 1959, * The Outlanders: The Men Who Made Johannesburg, 1964, * Zen and the Art of Donkey Maintenance, 2015, Bloomsbury compiled from his travel journalism serialised in the Daily Express in the 1960s and 1970s.

Gifford is best known for his series of novels about Sailor and Lula, two star-crossed protagonists on a perpetual road trip. Published in seven novels between 1990 and 2015, the Sailor and Lula series is described by professor Andrei Codrescu as written in \\"a great comic realist\\" style that explores \\"an unmistakably American universe [...] populated by a huge and lovable humanity propelled on a tragic river of excess energy.\\"Andrei Codrescu, forward to The Rooster Trapped in the Reptile Room: The Barry Gifford Reader; edited by Thomas A. McCarthy; NY: Seven Stories Press (2003), p xi The first book of the series, Wild at Heart, was adapted by director David Lynch for the 1990 film of the same title. Gifford went on to write the original screenplay for Lost Highway (1997) with Lynch. Perdita Durango, the third book in the Sailor and Lula series, was adapted into a 1997 film by Alex de la Iglesia with a script co-written by Gifford. Gifford also writes non-fiction and poetry. Life and career Gifford was born in a Chicago hotel room in 1946. His father was Jewish and his mother was of Irish Catholic background. Gifford's father was in organized crime, and he spent his childhood largely in Chicago and New Orleans living in hotels. After college he joined the Air Force Reserves. After a short stint pursuing a possible career in baseball, Gifford focused on writing, both as a journalist and a poet. Gifford's fourth novel, Wild at Heart: The Story of Sailor and Lula, caught the eye of director David Lynch, who adapted it into the screenplay and movie Wild at Heart. The movie won the Palme d'Or, the highest honor, at the Cannes Film Festival in 1990. The success of this film boosted interest in Gifford's novels.

Some modern scholars identify Mithridates I with the King Flavius Dades, known from a single Greek inscription around the edge of the base of a large silver dish found at Armazi. The dish was part of the inventory of a rich Roman-era burial conventionally known as \\"the Bersoumas burial\\" after the high dignitary Bersoumas to whom, the inscriptions says, this piece was presented by the King Flavius Dades. There is no mention of him in the medieval Georgian written tradition and appears to be the only Roman name attested in the Iberian ruling house, evidently indicating that he held Roman citizenship. The identification of this monarch and his place in the Iberian royal dynasty remains problematic, however. Mithridates I was succeeded by his son, Amazaspus I.

He made his first-class cricket debut for Rhodesia in 1927–28 and played intermittently for the same side until 1947–48, also playing a single match in 1928–29 for Border. His first-class cricket was restricted, however, by the limited number of matches played by Rhodesia: the side did not contest the Currie Cup competition between 1932–33 and the end of the Second World War. In his limited appearances, though, Tomlinson was successful. In his only match of the 1930–31 season, he took five wickets for 106 runs in the match against the MCC touring team, though he was not then selected for any of the Tests. Further good performances followed across the following two seasons. Against Eastern Province in 1931–32, opening the batting, he scored 109, his only first-class century. And playing for \\"The Rest\\" against Western Province in 1932–33, he took 10 wickets in the match for the only time in his career. That match, however, was his last first-class appearance before his selection, more than two years later, for the 1935 South African tour to England. Test player in England Tomlinson played 19 first- class matches during the 1935 tour of England but was not rated as a success in the tour write-up in the 1936 Wisden: \\"Tomlinson revealed early promise but accomplished nothing when given a chance in the first of the Tests,\\" it wrote. \\"He seemed unable to pitch the steady length so essential for a spin bowler.\\" Tomlinson played more first-class matches than expected because Xen Balaskas was injured for much of the season, but his inability to seize his chances meant that he appeared in only the first Test, and thereafter, South Africa's spin needs were covered by Cyril Vincent, with support from Bruce Mitchell. In his solitary Test, the only one of his career, Tomlinson scored nine in South Africa's first innings and did not bat in the second; in 10 overs of bowling, he failed to take a wicket and conceded 38 runs. After this Test match, Tomlinson fell so far out of favour that he was picked for only one match in the following six weeks. On the tour as a whole, he took 52 wickets at an average of 26.53, the most expensive of the regular bowlers, and his 282 runs came at an average of 20.14. On the way home from the tour, Tomlinson, like his captain, Jock Cameron, caught enteric fever; Tomlinson survived, though he was ill for a long time, but Cameron did not. Later cricket Illness aside, Rhodesia's limited first-class programme included only two further matches for Tomlinson before the Second World War, both of them against the 1938–39 England team. After the war, however, Rhodesia re-entered the Currie Cup competition and Tomlinson played a full season in 1946–47 in which he took the best bowling figures of his career: six wickets for 56 runs in the match against Western Province. He continued to play in a few matches in 1947–48, but then retired.

Early cricket Robertson was a lower- order right-handed batsman and a right-arm bowler who could bowl either medium-pace or off-breaks. He played first-class cricket for Western Province from 1931 to 1932 to 1936–37 and had occasional bowling success, including taking six Griqualand West first-innings wickets for 22 runs in 1933–34. He was not, however, picked for the 1935 South African tour to England. The following winter, however, the Australians toured South Africa and, playing for Western Province in one of the warm-up matches before the Test series, Robertson took eight Australian wickets for 96 runs in the touring team's only innings of the game. They were the best bowling figures of his career and they propelled him into the South African team for the first Test. Test cricket Robertson played in the first three Tests of a five-match series that showed the limitations of the South African side against the great spin bowling combination of Clarrie Grimmett and Bill O'Reilly. In his first match, Robertson bowled 55 overs in Australia's first innings, and took three wickets for 143 runs, which would prove to be his best Test figures. In the second match, there was only a single wicket, but he made his highest Test score of 17. The third match yielded two further wickets, but with that, his Test career was over, as an innings defeat left South Africa two down with two to play. Robertson appeared in only two further matches for Western Province in the 1936–37 season before leaving first-class cricket for good. He reappeared in a non-first-class game in wartime, playing for the South African Combined Services side against Western Province and taking seven wickets in the match.

Nicholson was a right- hand batsman and wicket-keeper who was a mainstay of the often-weak Griqualand West cricket team for 20 years from 1927, sometimes acting as captain and often opening the batting. It was as an opener that he scored his first century, an innings of 131 against Western Province in the 1929-30 season; with a double century from Ken Viljoen and 101 from Xen Balaskas, Griqualand West totalled 603, which remains the team's highest first-class total. He improved on that innings with a score of 148 in 1933-34 against Orange Free State. Then a year later against the same opposition, he was opening batsman, wicketkeeper and captain and he scored 185, which remained his highest first- class score. He was not, however, selected for any representative sides and was not picked for the 1935 tour of England. In the South African season of 1935-36, though, Nicholson was drafted into the South African Test team for the series against Australia after the shock death of Jock Cameron, who had been such a success on the tour to England and the decision by Robert Williams, Cameron's deputy on the England tour, to remain in the UK. In a one- sided series which Australia won 4-0, with one match drawn, Nicholson took only three catches in the first four matches, and, after making 0 in both innings of the fourth Test, was dropped for the fifth match in favour of Edward van der Merwe. He batted low in the order and made just 76 runs in eight innings, one of them not out.

Geography Ersa is the northernmost commune of Corsica. It extends from Centuri to the West, to Rogliano to the East. Ersa is covered with shrubs and arid summits. The coast, which is carved to the West by the Cape Grossu (Cape Grosso) and the Punta of Corno of Becco, has beautiful beaches of sand and pebbles. The commune is watered by the streams Acqua Tignese and Granaghjulu on its undulating slopes of the Mount Maghjore (364 m). History The ancient Latin name of Ersa is Arsia. Human occupation predated Roman conquest. The commune experienced Turkish occupation during 1555 to 1571. In 1592 the Republic of Genoa annexed Ersa, which allied itself to Pasquale Paoli in 1757. Until the 17th century, the Cape Corse was the target of frequent incursions of barbaric pirates. When Corse joined France at the end of the 17th century there were 1130 inhabitants, highly involved in the cultivation of grapes for wine. Since then the population has dropped to about 135 inhabitants. Villages The villages of the commune of Ersa lie between the two summits.

The ancient small port of Barcaghju, situated at the rear of the bay, near to the mouth of river Acqua Tignose, offers a panorama of the island of Giraglia. It occupies the location of a pre-Roman village. One finds here the chapel of Saint Peter and to the south the wrecked chapel Saint-Lucie. Its grand beach of fine sand presents a spectacular sand-dune. Near the commune of Rogliano, is the Genoese tower of Agnello, framing on the headland of Cape Agnello. The second sea-front, Tollare, at the mouth of the River Granaghjulu, extends its ancient mansions around that of its chapel Saint-Anne and its round Genoese tower.

It is a resident breeder in forests from southern Mexico and Trinidad, through Central America, south to southern Brazil, Paraguay and northwestern Argentina. There are six subspecies. One is occasionally treated as a separate species called the short-browed or brown spectacled owl but the consensus is that it is still merely a race until more detailed analysis can be done. Distribution and habitat Chan Chich Lodge area, Belize - flash photo The spectacled owl is found in Mexico, Central America (Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama), Trinidad and Tobago, and South America (Colombia, Venezuela, Suriname, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina). The spectacled owl is primarily a bird of tropical rain forests, being found mostly in areas where dense, old-growth forest is profuse. However, it may enter secondary habitats, such as forest edges, especially while hunting. On occasion, they have been found in dry forests, treed savanna plains, plantations and semi- open areas with trees. In areas such as Costa Rica, they may inhabit subtropical montane forests of up to , although are generally associated with lowland forests. Description Video from Disney's Animal Kingdom The spectacled owl can range from in length. Mass in males can range from , where as females can weigh from . 10 males from the nominate subspecies (P. p. perspicillata) were found to average while 8 females averaged .Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK Adult (2005), CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses, 2nd Edition by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (2008), . It is unmistakable in most of its range (except with other Pulsatrix owls) with blackish brown upperparts, head and upper breast, white facial markings and whitish to yellowish-ochre underparts. The eyes are yellow, the only Pulsatrix with this eye color, and the beak is pale. The juvenile is even more distinctive than the adult, being completely white apart from a chocolate brown facial disc. The head is typically darker than the back and mantle but the shade of this area besides the composition of the breast band is the main distinguishing external feature of the subspecies.Owls of the World by Konig, Weick & Becking. Yale University Press (2009), Compared to the band-bellied owl (P. melanota), it is of similar or slightly larger size, but that species has dark eyes, white eyebrows and a brown chest band broken by buffy-whitish barring the rest of broadly the underparts being whitish with reddish-brown barring. The spectacled owl is generally found at lower elevations than the band-bellied but their ranges overlap or abut from Colombia to northern Bolivia. The tawny- browed owl (P. koeniswaldiana), found from northeastern Argentina to eastern Brazil, is fairly similar in appearance to the spectacled but is marked smaller with ochraceous-tawny from the eyebrows down to the belly and dark chestnut eyes. Each of the three currently recognized species also has a distinct song. Vocal activity tends to be most prominent on calm, moonlit nights. The primary sound made by the spectacled owl consists of guttural knocking or tapping sounds with a popping effect: PUP-pup-pup-pup-po, POK pok pok bog bog bog bobobo or BOO Boo boo boo boo. Each progressive note becomes weaker and lower in pitch but faster in pace as the call continues. The male is the primary singer to proclaim a territory, often singing from the upper third of a tall tree. However, females also sing, uttering the same song but with a higher pitch. Duets between pairs have been heard on moonlit nights. Females also make a hawk-like scream with an emphasis on the drawn-out second syllable, ker-WHEEER, which has often been compared to a steam-whistle. Young spectacled owls beg with a harsh, high-pitched keew call. In Colombia, an author noted that the song is similar to the tapping pattern of the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). In Brazil, spectacled owls are known locally as \\"knocking owls\\".Owls of the World: A Photographic Guide by Mikkola, H. Firefly Books (2012),  Subspecies  The following subspecies are currently recognized: * Pulsatrix perspicillata boliviana (Kelso, 1933)- Distributed in Bolivia. Most similar to P. p. chapmani, with slightly lighter color on mantle than that race and a lighter, more buff underside color. The feathers appear to be relatively long on this race especially on the flanks, probably due to the cooler climates it inhabits. Specimens had wing of and a tail length of Kelso, L. (1934).

Nominate as described above. Wing is , tail is from long, and bill from cere is . * Pulsatrix perspicillata pulsatrix (Wied-Neuwied, 1820)- Or the \\"Short-browed Owl\\"; native to southeastern Brazil from about Bahia south to Rio Grande do Sul in the area of Aparados da Serra National Park and also bordering over into northeastern Argentina. This species has creamy-buff instead of white on the spectacles of the face. P. p. pulsatrix is lighter brown than in any other spectacled owl, with no contrasting darker plumage on the crown and nape as in other races. The breast band is brown and distinctly broken in the center. Main proposed difference (leading to it being considered a full species) is that territorial song is not as accelerated as in other races. Apparently, where the ranges of more typical spectacled owls overlap with the short-browed types, they do not seem to hybridize. This is the largest variety of Spectacled Owl. Wing is long and tail is . Weight of a single male and single female was and , coincidentally exactly the same of the maximum weight recorded for the nominate race of Spectacled Owl. * Pulsatrix perspicillata saturata (Ridgway, 1914)- Found from southern Mexico to northern Costa Rica. P. p. saturata differs from the typical spectacled owl only in that it is black on the head and the back, with black barring on the sides. It is one of the more distinct and widely described subspecies. Wing is and tail is long. The bill from the cere is . Weight is from in males and from in females. * Pulsatrix perspicillata trinitatis (Bangs & T. E. Penard, 1918)- Found on Trinidad and Tobago. This poorly-known race is sometimes treated as synonymous with the nominate by some authorities. Today, authorities believe that the race is extinct. Behaviour Male and female with their chick at the London Zoo. This species is largely nocturnal, starting activity right around the time of last light at dusk and usually being back on their roosts for the day around first light. It is a solitary, unsocial bird, usually roosting singly each day and only peaceable associating with others of their own species for reproductive purposes. The spectacled owl is typically the largest and most dominant owl in its range, with the larger great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) rarely venturing into true rainforest habitats. Most hunting starts with the owl perched on a branch and scanning the area, then dropping with a quick pounce when prey is located. It preys principally on a wide array of mammals, eating almost anything that is nocturnally active. Various rodents may be primary but virtually any type of small mammal in its habitat is vulnerable. The primary food by far in Oaxaca, Mexico was the Peters's climbing rat (Tylomys nudicaudus) followed by mouse opossums (Marmosa ssp.) of unidentified species.De Silva, H. G., Pérez-Villafaña, M., & Santos-Moreno, J. A. (1997). Diet of the spectacled owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata) during the rainy season in Northern Oaxaca, Mexico. Journal of Raptor Research, 31(4), 385-387. Numerous bats, such as greater spear-nosed bats (Phyllostomus hastatus) and broad-eared bats (Nyctinomops laticaudatus), are also rather vulnerable apparently.Knörnschild, M., & Tschapka, M. (2012).

Paternity, Relatedness, and Socio-Reproductive Behavior in a Population of Wild Red-Bellied Tamarins (Saguinus labiatus). Ann Arbor, Michigan: ProQuest Information and Learning Company. Prey species can be heavier than the preying owl, weigh over , possibly up to in Didelphis opossums, Mephitis skunks and agoutis (Dasyprocta ssp.). Even the three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) has been reported to have been killed, specifically an adult female estimated at in weight or more than four times the weight of the owl itself.Voirin, J. B., Kays, R., Lowman, M. D., & Wikelski, M. (2009). Evidence for Three-Toed Sloth (Bradypus variegatus) predation by spectacled owl (Pulsatrix perspicillata). Edentata, 8, 15-20. Invertebrates are eaten regularly as well, second only in importance to mammals, and may be comprised mainly by caterpillars, but also crabs, snails, large insects and spiders. Insects may be gleaned directly from foliage while the large owls actively forage. Frogs are also recorded amongst their prey. Birds are also taken, including mainly medium-sized species in the average weight range of , such as jays, oropendolas (Psarocolius ssp.), motmots (Momota ssp.), and pigeons (Patagioenas ssp.), which are taken off of their nocturnal perches and perhaps smaller types of owl. Little is known how spectacled owls interact with other owls but a study where playback of a number of owl species were played in Costa Rica, spectacled owls appeared to the least responsive, neither vocally stimulated by the calling of other owl species nor by playback of calls of their own species.Enriquez, P. L., & Salazar, J. L. R. (1997). Intra-and Interspecific Calling in a Tropical Owl Community. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FOREST SERVICE GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT NC, 525-532. Reproduction The young In Costa Rica, eggs are laid variously in the dry season (November–May), or at the start of the wet season (June–July). This owl typically nests in an unlined tree cavity but may also use the crutch of a large tree. Like all owls, they do not build a nest so just lay their nest on the bare surface of the wood given, usually rotting wood in the case of tree cavities. Spectacled owls lay 1-2 eggs, which are incubated entirely or almost so by the female for about 5 weeks. If two eggs are hatched, often only one of the chicks will survive, the smaller chick usually perishing via starvation or by aggression from the larger nestling. Chicks leave the nest for surrounding branches at about 5–6 weeks but cannot usually fly well at this stage. However, they tend to depend on their parents for several months after leaving the nest and may be cared for and fed for up to a year once fledged, inhibiting the pair's ability to have young the following year. Spectacled owls may breed while still in immature plumage since it may take up to five years before full adult plumage is obtained. Status The spectacled owl occurs over a very large range and is still a resident in much of its range. Due to this, it is classified as Least Concern by the IUCN. However, being a large, slow-maturing bird of prey with a strong sense of territoriality, it as a rule occurs at low densities. In areas where prey populations are hunted by people and habitats are destroyed or compromised, they may decrease. This is the likely source of extinction for an entire race on Trinidad (P. p. trinitatis). Occasionally, when roads are cut into the forest, they are killed by automobile collisions.Bencke, G. A., & Bencke, C. S. C. (1999). The potential importance of road deaths as cause of mortality for large forest owls in southern Brasil. Cotinga, Bedfordshire, 11, 79-80.

He was born in King William's Town and died in Port Alfred, both in Cape Province. Davies was a left-handed tail-end batsman and a right-arm fast bowler with a short first- class cricket career spread over many seasons. He first appeared for Eastern Province in three matches in the 1929–30 season and took four wickets for 36 against Rhodesia in the third of these. He then played just one match in 1930–31 and a further single game in 1934–35, with little success in either. Test cricket In 1935–36, the Australians toured South Africa and with the season half over played a first-class match against Eastern Province. The Australians won the game easily by an innings inside two days, but Davies scored a personal success by taking six Australian wickets for 80 runs in the Australian innings. That led to his selection for the fourth Test of the five- match series; the game was a crushing defeat inside two days for the South Africans, but Davies performed well, taking four Australian wickets for 75 runs in the touring team's only innings. Davies retained his place for the fifth Test where the result was a similarly heavy defeat, though South Africa batted better and the match lasted to the fourth day; Davies, however, was not successful and failed to take a wicket. After this flurry of cricket activity, Davies played in only one match in 1936–37 and none at all the following season. But in 1938–39 he had an almost identical experience to 1935–36, turning out in a single first-class match for a provincial side against the touring team, doing well and then being inserted into the Test team. This time, he played for Transvaal against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team, and took six wickets for 82 runs in the tourists' only innings. He also \\"felled\\" the England opening batsman Len Hutton with the third ball of the innings. His subsequent selection in the Test team for the first game of a five-match series may have looked inspired when he took the wicket of Bill Edrich in the first over of the first Test, but it proved to be his only wicket of the game. It was not much different in the second game of the series: Davies took one wicket, that of Wally Hammond, but Hammond had made 181 by that time and England's total reached 559 before they declared, though the match ended as a draw. And there was a third single wicket for Davies in the third match, and this time his 15 eight-ball overs went for 106 runs. He was dropped from the Test team after this match and did not play international cricket again. In fact, he played very little further first-class cricket: in the ad hoc cricket of the 1945–46 season in South Africa, with no official tournaments organised for the first season after the Second World War, he turned out three times for North-Eastern Transvaal and those were his final first-class games. Outside cricket, he was a schoolmaster.

Harvey was a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. He played first-class cricket for Natal in two matches in 1933–34 without success. But when he was picked again two years later for Natal in the match against the 1935–36 Australians, he scored 16 and 104. Although eventually bowled by Clarrie Grimmett, he resisted for three and three-quarters hours, and \\"alternated periods of hard hitting with rigid defence\\". After Grimmett (and Bill O'Reilly) had led Australia to two Test victories in the first three matches of a five-game series, with no South African batsman apart from Dudley Nourse making more than 66 runs in any one innings, Harvey was picked for the fourth Test. He had limited success, scoring 5 and 17 as the South Africans suffered their worst defeat of the series, though he did hit one six off Grimmett. The only first-class match between the fourth and fifth Tests was the second game between Natal and the Australians, and this time Harvey scored 138, slightly more than half the Natal first-innings total of 272; he shared a second-wicket stand of 135 with Herby Wade who was captain of both the Natal and the South African teams. Harvey was retained for the fifth Test and made scores of 28 and 1 in another heavy defeat being, in the second innings, the first out of five dismissals (of the last six batsmen in the team) to be caught by Vic Richardson off the bowling of Grimmett. On the whole tour of South Africa by the Australians, only four centuries were scored off them: two by Nourse (one in a Test) and two by Harvey. Those centuries, though, were the only ones in Harvey's first- class cricket career. He remained as a batsman and, increasingly, a bowler with Natal up to the 1939–40 season but although he passed 50 on 11 further occasions, he did not reach 100 again. At the end of the Second World War, as a temporary captain in the South African forces, he was awarded an MBE.

Len Brown was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a right-arm fast-medium bowler who turned to bowling leg-breaks and googlies later in his career. His first-class cricket career began with two matches for Transvaal against the 1930–31 English touring team and he took seven wickets in his first match, including Wally Hammond and Percy Chapman twice each. He was then picked, as the youngest member of the team, for the 1931–32 tour to Australia and New Zealand. Brown was rarely part of the touring team's first eleven in the major matches, but after a bad showing in the first Test match, which was lost by an innings and 163 runs, he played in a non-first-class match against a New South Wales Country XI and, bowling throughout the Country XI's first innings, took five wickets for 57 runs, with another couple of wickets in the second innings. That led to his call-up to the Test team for the second match of the series. The result, though, was almost identical to the first game – defeat by an innings and 155 runs – and Brown took only one wicket at a cost of 100 runs. He also scored 2 and 8 in his two innings. He played in only a few of the other matches on the tour until the South Africans crossed to New Zealand where, in a less taxing series, he was recalled for the second Test match against the New Zealanders, the first game having been won by an innings. In this second (and last) Test of his career, Brown took a single wicket in each innings and scored 7 in the South Africans' only completed innings. Brown played regularly for Transvaal in 1932–33 and the season included his best first-class bowling performance, six wickets for 30 runs in the match between Transvaal and a team representing the \\"Rest of South Africa\\". But he then left South African domestic cricket for three seasons and he was not selected for the 1935 tour to England. Instead, Brown played as a professional for Church in the Lancashire League for the 1935 and 1936 seasons. He returned to South Africa in 1936–37, playing for Transvaal in that season and in 1945–46, for North Eastern Transvaal from 1937 to 1940 and for Rhodesia from 1946 to 1948; he continued to take wickets and, after his stint in League cricket, his batting had improved, but he was not picked for any further representative matches. He later worked as the sports editor for the Rhodesia Herald.Brian Bassano, Cricketer, November 1983, p. 39.

He was born and died at Cape Town.  Career  Bond was a right-handed middle- or upper-order batsman and a right-arm medium-pace bowler. He played irregularly for Western Province from 1929-30. His best season was 1936-37 when he scored his only first-class century, a score of 170 for Western Province against Natal which was insufficient to prevent his side losing the match by an innings. In the following game, opening the Western Province bowling against Border, he took four wickets for 17 runs with his medium-pace, the best bowling performance of his career. Bond's Test career was fleeting. He took two wickets (including Wally Hammond) in Western Province's match against the England team in 1938-39 and scored 13 in each innings. He was then picked for the first Test of a five-match series. When England batted, he was the sixth bowler used and was given only two overs, in which he failed to take a wicket and conceded 16 runs; in the South African innings, the unsuccessful promotion of a nightwatchman meant that he batted at No 9 instead of No 3 or No 4 as he generally did for Western Province, and he was dismissed first ball, one of three first-ball dismissals in the innings. He was not selected for South Africa again and in fact did not play any further first-class cricket either.

Gordon became the oldest-ever Test cricketer on 23 March 2011, when he surpassed New Zealander Eric Tindill, who died on 1 August 2010, approximately four months before his 100th birthday. Personal life Gordon was Jewish, and was born in Boksburg, Transvaal. Cricket career Gordon played first-class cricket for Transvaal from 1933–34 as a right-handed fast bowler and a tail-end right-handed batsman. He made his Test debut against England in December 1938, playing every Test of the five-match series. In the first Test, he took his best Test match figures of 7–162, including 5–103 in the first innings. He was stumped by Les Ames off the bowling of Tom Goddard for a first-ball duck in the drawn match. In the second match he took 5–157 in England's only innings, but was again stumped by Ames off the bowling of Goddard for 0 in another drawn match. In the third match, Gordon took 2–127 in England's only innings and was out for 1 and 0, falling to Ken Farnes and Hedley Verity as England won by an innings and 13 runs. In the fourth match, he took 2–47 and 3–58 but did not bat in the drawn Test. In the final Test Gordon took match figures of 1–256 and was not out in each innings, scoring 0 and 7. This match was the famous Timeless Test, which took 10 days and was eventually declared a draw by agreement between the teams. It was Gordon's final Test match. He took his best innings figures of 6–61, followed by 3–86 in the second innings, for Transvaal against Natal at Johannesburg in 1939–40. He continued playing for Transvaal until the 1948–49 season.

Connecting State Route 70 at Wicks Corner with State Route 99 east of Durham, it forms part of the primary north-south highway through the eastern Sacramento Valley, a Focus Route of the Interregional Road System.California Department of Transportation, Focus Routes, January 2005 SR 149 was formerly part of the Oroville-Chico Highway; the majority of the latter was merged into other routes. In the mid-1970s, the highway was reallocated onto a newer two- lane alignment. A project to widen the two-lane road to a four-lane expressway was completed in late 2008, removing the bottleneck from the Oroville-Chico highway.California Department of Transportation, Butte 70/149/99 Highway Improvement Project. Retrieved February 2008. Route description State Route 149 begins at Wicks Corner as a divided highway, at an interchange with SR 70 several miles north of Oroville. This is the north end of the State Route 70 freeway, which passes through a gap between the Campbell Hills and South Table Mountain on its way from Oroville. SR 149 heads northwest across gently rolling terrain before descending into the valley of the Dry Creek. As it begins to climb out of the valley, SR 149 ends at an interchange with SR 99. The latter highway continues the corridor northwest to Chico, quickly dropping back into the Butte Creek valley. The route is a divided highway with four lanes. SR 149 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History By the late 1910s, a \\"natural prairie road\\" linked Oroville to State Highway Route 3 southeast of Chico, following the present Table Mountain Boulevard, Openshaw Road, and Oroville- Chico Highway to Midway (Route 3). The primary route between these two cities was the all-state highway route, following Route 21 (now SR 162) west from Oroville to Route 3 near Richvale.Automobile Club of Southern California, Automobile Road Map of California, 1917Official Automobile Blue Book, Volume Eight, 1919, pp. 222-223 Butte County dedicated a newly improved Oroville- Chico Highway on July 4, 1926;Oakland Tribune, Near-Beer Will Christen New Road, June 18, 1926 it became part of the state highway system in 1933 as the northern portion of the Woodland-Chico Route 87.: \\"State Highway Route 3 near Chico to State Highway Route 21 near Oroville.\\": \\"Route 87 is from: (a) Route 7 near Woodland to State Highway near Yuba City. (b) Route 15 near Marysville to Route 21 near Oroville. (c) Route 21 near Oroville to Route 3 near Chico.\\" (The rest of Route 87 became part of Sign Route 24, which turned east at Oroville along present State Route 70, in 1934.California Highways and Public Works, State Routes will be Numbered and Marked with Distinctive Bear Signs, August 1934) In the 1950s and 1960s, about three-quarters of the Oroville- Chico Highway was absorbed by other routes.United States Geological Survey, Oroville (1944) and Chico (1949) (scale 1:62500): these maps show the road before it was absorbed A new two-lane alignment of U.S. Route 99E (Legislative Route 3, now SR 99) between east of Richvale and Chico opened in the mid-1950s, using part of the Oroville-Chico Highway south of Durham Dayton Highway and bypassing the remainder to the junction south of Chico.California Department of Transportation, Index to California Highways and Public Works, 1937-1967, June 1997, p. 75 In the early 1960s, U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Legislative Route 21, now SR 70) was relocated due to the damming of Lake Oroville across its old alignment. The bridge over the West Branch Feather River northwest of the dam opened in August 1962, resulting in US 40 Alt. using the Oroville-Chico Highway (which was relocated to a new four-lane freeway alignment) south of Wicks Corner.Oakland Tribune, Bridge Dedicated, August 15, 1962Oakland Tribune, Man, Machines Change Face of Earth in Gigantic Dam Project at Oroville, June 8, 1964 The remainder, which was never part of a sign route,H.M.

Caltrans began studies for interchanges at each end in September 1992. The California Transportation Commission approved funding for four-laning SR 149 in April 1994 and the two interchanges in May 1996, with construction to begin in 1998 and cost $47 million. Due to state budget problems and the need to study environmental impacts, the project was repeatedly pushed back; these impacts and inflation had more than doubled the cost to $120 million in 2004. In particular, an endangered species of meadowfoam was discovered on the south embankment, forcing a redesign. Construction began in September 2005 on a new freshwater marsh near the State Route 70 intersection to replace beaver ponds in the path of the highway, and it was completed in March 2006. Ground was broken for the highway project in April 2006, with major construction beginning in May.Chico Enterprise-Record, Project has taken a long time to get to this point , July 21, 2006 Caltrans estimated completion in late 2009 for the completion of the four-lane expressway, including a new directional interchange at each end, at which State Route 70 and State Route 99 will exit and enter to the right of the main Oroville-Chico movement. Most access was closed, with Shippee Road providing the sole at-grade crossing of the expressway, and an overcrossing near State Route 70 giving access to local property. Shippee Road was relocated to the southeast, allowing for the future construction of an interchange. In addition, State Route 70 was relocated to the west between SR 149 and State Route 191, and local access on State Route 99 between SR 149 and the Durham Dayton Highway interchange was replaced by frontage roads.Chico Enterprise- Record, Closing the gap: The Highway 149 project (map) Retrieved February 2008.

His son, Vintcent, also had a successful first-class cricket career. The son of one Western Province cricketer and the nephew of another, Pieter van der Bijl was educated at Diocesan College, Rondebosch, Cape Town, and was then a Rhodes Scholar at Brasenose College, Oxford University from 1928. A newspaper report in 1930 said that van der Bijl was \\"reputed to be the tallest man in Oxford\\". In many reports then and later, his surname was spelled \\"van der Byl\\". Early cricket His first-class cricket career for Western Province began in 1925–26 and he played regularly for the team in 1926–27, acting as wicketkeeper. Aside from an innings of 60 not out against Eastern Province he did not make much impression as a batsman. After a single game in the 1927–28 season he disappeared from first-class cricket for almost four years. English experience At Oxford, van der Bijl initially made a mark in athletics and boxing more than in cricket. In athletics, his event was \\"putting the weight\\", as the shot put was termed. He was fourth in the freshman's trial in his first year and later won a half-blue. The following day, he was the heavyweight in the university boxing match against Cambridge University and won his bout, which was the last of the tournament and won the rubber for Oxford by four to three. In cricket, he was not picked for the freshmen's trial match in 1929, and though he played in the seniors' match in 1930, he was not then selected for any of the first-class games; in 1931, he played in a single match, but after scoring 16 not out and 0, he was not chosen again that season. In 1932, van der Bijl scored a century in one of the Oxford University cricket trial matches and that led to his selection for early matches: once in the team, he did well enough to justify continued selection. Sometimes opening the innings, sometimes batting in the middle order, he scored consistently and totalled 540 runs and an average of 45.00. His best match was against Essex when he made an unbeaten 97 in the first innings and followed that with 60 in the second. Despite his success, however, van der Bijl's batting attracted criticism. The Times, reporting on his 97 not out against Essex, wrote: \\"His driving too often had the dead and muffled sound that comes from bad timing and a lack of follow-through. Still, his defence was good and if he took an unconscionable time to reach his 50 he deserved the century that he just missed.\\" Wisden Cricketers' Almanack too, in its review of the 1932 Oxford season, was also somewhat faint in its praise: \\"Van der Bijl semed to play an unnecessarily laboured game for a man of such fine physique,\\" it wrote. \\"Patient, with very strong defence, he usually took a long time to settle down and seldom allowed himself the luxury of an attempt to force the game.\\" In a year when Oxford were not strong in cricket, however, van der Bijl was one of the early selections for the University Match, though in a high-scoring drawn game with Cambridge he scored only 7 in his single innings. Back in South Africa Leaving Oxford, van der Bijl returned to South Africa, but did not play first- class cricket over the next couple of seasons. He reappeared in three games in the 1934–35 season for Western Province with no great success, and was not in the 1935 South African team in England. The following year, he played only one match, right at the end of the season, and did not feature in the Tests against the Australians. From 1936–37, however, he played more regularly and in 1937–38, he was the captain of the Western Province side. Regular cricket brought more success: he finally hit a first-class century, more than 10 years after his debut, in making 195 against Griqualand West in 1936–37, which would remain his highest first-class score – in this match he also opened the bowling, though he did not take any wickets, and he was never a regular bowler. The following season, in a dozen innings, there were two further centuries and five other scores of more than 50, and he averaged 60.30. By this time, Van der Bijl's reputation for stodgy batting was well in the past. In the match against Eastern Province at the end of the 1937–38 season, he hit 28 off six balls of the final over of the match to win the game. Test cricketer As was usual at that time, the Currie Cup domestic first-class competition was cancelled for the 1938–39 season as there was a tour of South Africa by an England team. Van der Bijl played in an early game for Western Province against the tourists and scored just 19 and 14. He was then picked as an opening batsman for the first Test of a five-match series, making his debut on Christmas Eve 1938; in this drawn game, he had limited success, scoring 4 and 38. He was more prominent in the second Test, another draw, scoring 37 in the first innings and then, when South Africa was forced to follow on making 87 and sharing a second wicket stand of 147 with Eric Rowan which saved the game. The Times reported: \\"Van der Byl (sic) played his usual stolid defensive game for the first part of his innings, but later used his great height to hit with vigour.\\" There were no such heroics in the third game which England won by an innings; Van der Bijl scored 28 and 13. Having opened the innings with Bruce Mitchell in the first three matches, van der Bijl had a new opening partner in Alan Melville for the fourth Test, and they responded in South Africa's only innings of the game with a partnership of 108, at which score both batsmen were out, van der Bijl for 31 and Melville for 67. With the series still undecided (England were winning 1–0 with three matches having been drawn), the final Test was intended to be played to a finish: in the event, after a match of unprecedented high scoring, it was left drawn to enable the England team to return home. Van der Bijl had his best match, with innings of 125 and 97. In the first innings, van der Bijl put on 131 for the first wicket with Melville, and batted for the whole of the first day, at the end of which he was 105 not out. His batting was mixture of dour defence and pugnacious stroke-making, according to Wisden's report: \\"Van der Byl spent forty-five minutes before opening his score and three hours elapsed before he hit a boundary,\\" it wrote. \\"He did not take the slightest risk though he astonished everyone when he punished Wright for twenty-two in one over, including five boundaries. Next he pulled a ball into the grand stand for 6.\\" In the second innings, Mitchell was restored as van der Bijl's opening partner, and they put on 191 for the first wicket, van der Bijl failing by three runs to become the first South African to score two centuries in a match against England. In the series as a whole, van der Bijl scored 460 runs at an average of 51.11; his was the second highest aggregate of runs for South Africa in the series, beaten only by Mitchell's 466. Later career The Second World War brought an end to competitive cricket in South Africa. Van der Bijl played in a few first-class friendly matches in 1939–40 and in a war- time first-class game a couple of years later, but there was no more Test or Currie Cup cricket for him. He was badly wounded while serving in North Africa during the war, and played no more cricket after that.E.W. Swanton, Sort of a Cricket Person, William Collins, London, 1972, p. 102. His career was as a schoolmaster and he became the headmaster of the Diocesan College Preparatory School in Cape Town. His son, Vintcent van der Bijl, another very tall man, became a successful fast bowler for teams in South Africa and England, though his career coincided with the exclusion of South Africa from international sport because of apartheid and he did not play Test cricket.

Originally Sekiguchi Shinsuke, the son of an Edo bookseller, from Motozaimokuchō Itchōme in Edo, he took on Torii Kiyonaga as an art name. Although not biologically related to the Torii family, he became head of the group after the death of his adoptive father and teacher Torii Kiyomitsu. The master Kiyomitsu died in 1785; since his son died young, and Kiyotsune, Kiyonaga's senior, was a less promising artist, Kiyonaga was the obvious choice to succeed Kiyomitsu to leadership of the Torii school. However, he delayed this for two years, likely devoting time to his bijin-ga and realizing the immense responsibility that would fall on his shoulders once he took over the school. Thus, in 1787, he began organizing the production of kabuki signboards and the like, which the school held a near monopoly on. He also began to train Kiyomitsu's grandson, Torii Kiyomine, who was to succeed him. Artistic career Cooling on Riverside Torii Kiyonaga began his training under Torii Kiyomitsu in 1765 at the age of 14 years old. It is suspected that prior to entering the Torii school he may have trained under Isoda Koryūsai, Suzuki Harunobu, and Kitao Shigemasa, as much of Kiyonaga’s work shows influence from these other ukiyo-e masters. Many of his early works were billboards and depictions of actors based on his visits to nearby kabuki theatres. The highlight of his career is when he began to produce pieces of beautiful women. In addition Torii Kiyonaga created illustrations for books and picture programs called banzuke. Kiyonaga is considered one of the great masters of the full-color nishiki-e print and of bijin-ga, images of courtesans and other beautiful women. Like most ukiyo-e artists, however, he also produced a number of prints and paintings depicting Kabuki actors and related subjects, many of them promotional materials for the theaters. He also produced a number of shunga, or erotic images. In the field of bijin-ga, only the works of Suzuki Harunobu and a handful of others are generally regarded comparable with those of Kiyonaga. Kiyonaga produced a great many bijin-ga prints in the 1780s, and this is generally regarded as his high point; this is particularly true because he nearly stopped doing art entirely in the early 1790s. Some scholars point out the beauty of his paintings as being particularly exceptional given his commoner heritage and upbringing. Adopted into the Torii family, Kiyonaga's biological father was the owner of a number of tenements near a fish market; though his family may not have been particularly poor, he was certainly not brought up in an environment of high culture. Meanwhile, contemporary artists of the samurai class, who would be expected to have a better innate sense of the aesthetics and details of aristocratic culture, produced images quite arguably inferior to those of Kiyonaga. The women in Kiyonaga's prints are often described as exceptionally tall, seeming fuller, and more mature than those of his predecessor Harunobu, whose prints often depict women who seem younger and thinner. Though a difference of personal styles accounts for this primarily, it also comes in part from Kiyonaga's use of larger sheets of paper (ōban, rather than chūban or hosobanKenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, Kenkyusha Limited, ). Kiyonaga’s works broke the mold of many previous artists. A great proportion of Kiyonaga's work is in diptych or triptych form, making the work seem larger and more impressive overall. Due to the large size of his prints many of his works with beautiful women also feature a scenic background illustrated with the Western concept of perspective. His prints are also well known for the variance and richness in colors. Just as Kiyonaga can be said to have replaced the earlier Harunobu as the most popular bijinga artist of his time, so Kiyonaga can be said to have been replaced by Utamaro, whose women are even fuller and more mature than those of the former. Kiyonaga's Kabuki prints, depicting scenes on stage and the like, show a great attention to detail, and seek to depict real Kabuki scenes, rather than idealized versions. There is something very plain about much of his depictions, showing that those depicted are in fact actors and not the true idealized characters they represent; however, he did not make the leap to portraying the individual features and personalities of the actors as some other artists (including the Katsukawa school) did. Some scholars label his style as an important intermediary step leading to the bombastic, yet realistic, style of Sharaku. In 1794, when Utamaro became the lead bijin-ga artist, Torii Kiyonaga shifted his artistic focus to surimono, illustrations, and paintings. His last known print dates from 1813, two years before he died.

Its common names include crocodile monitor, Papua(n) monitor, Salvadori's monitor, and artellia. It is the largest monitor lizard known from New Guinea, and is one of the longest lizards in the world, verified at up to . The tail of the species is exceptionally long, so some specimens have been claimed to exceed the length of the world's largest lizard, the Komodo dragon; however, V. salvadorii is far less massive. Varanus salvadorii is an arboreal lizard with a dark green body marked with bands of yellowish spots. It has a characteristic blunt snout and a very long tail. It lives in mangrove swamps and coastal rainforests in the southeastern part of the island, feeding on birds, small mammals, eggs, and carrion. Its teeth are better adapted than those of most monitors for seizing fast-moving prey. Like all monitors, V. salvadorii has anatomical features that enable it to breathe more easily when running than other lizards can, but it may have even greater stamina than most other monitor species. Little is known of its reproduction and development, as the species is difficult to breed in captivity. V. salvadorii is threatened by deforestation and poaching, and is protected by the CITES agreement. The lizard is hunted and skinned alive by tribesmen to make drums, who describe the monitor as an evil spirit that \\"climbs trees, walks upright, breathes fire, and kills men\\", yet the tribesmen maintain that the monitor gives warnings if crocodiles are nearby. Taxonomy and etymology V. salvadorii was first described as Monitor salvadorii by Wilhelm Peters and Giacomo Doria in 1878 from a female specimen with a snout-to-vent length of , and a tail measuring in length. The generic name, Varanus, is derived from the Arabic waral (), meaning \\"lizard\\". The term \\"monitor\\" is thought to have come about from confusion between waral and the German ', meaning \\"warning\\". The term \\"goanna\\" came about as a corruption of the name \\"iguana\\". The specific name, salvadorii, is derived from a Latinization of Tommaso Salvadori,Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Varanus salvadorii, p. 232). an Italian ornithologist who worked in New Guinea. Later, in 1885, it was renamed Varanus salvadorii by George Albert Boulenger. The Papua monitor is occasionally confused for the Asian water monitor (V. salvator) because of their similar scientific names. Evolutionary origins The evolutionary history of V. salvadorii started with the genus Varanus, which originated in Asia about 40 million years ago (Mya). Around 15 Mya, a tectonic connection between Australia and Southeast Asia allowed the varanids to spread into what is now the Indonesian archipelago. Based upon DNA sequences of three nuclear and two mitochondrial genes, cladistic analysis identifies V. salvadorii as a member of a species cluster that includes the lace monitor (V. varius) and the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis). Morphological considerations suggest that Varanus priscus was also a member of the group. Monitors apparently colonized Australasia from Asia about 32 Mya; the varius clade then arose about 17 Mya. The Torres Strait separating New Guinea from Australia is less than long, a distance that could have been covered fairly easily with island hopping. Distribution The largest of the seven species of monitors found on the island of New Guinea, V. salvadorii occurs in both the state Papua New Guinea and the Indonesian region of West Papua. It inhabits the high and low canopies of the lowland rainforests and coastal mangrove swamps, sometimes venturing out of these areas during floods in the rainy seasons. No detailed field investigation data are available for V. salvadorii, so the full extent of its range is unknown. Its remote and generally inaccessible habitat is an obstacle to detailed study of this monitor in its natural habitat. Biology and morphology Detail of bulbous snout - taken at the Cincinnati Zoo The most characteristic feature of V. salvadorii is its blunt, bulbous snout, which makes this species look different from every other monitor on New Guinea, and suggested the common name tree crocodile. The body of the lizard is dark green with rings of yellow spots. The tail is banded yellow and black and is extremely long, more than twice as long as the snout-to-vent length. Its teeth are long, straight, and sharp. Its claws are prominent and strongly curved. No clear external sexual dimorphism is seen. Various descriptions are mutually inconsistent, but agreement exists that V. salvadorii is unique among extant varanid species, in that the animal's tail is much longer than the snout-to-vent length in both juveniles and adults. One figure gives the tail as two-thirds longer, whereas another states that the tail is 210% of the animal's body length. At hatching, V. salvadorii is about long. Reports of the maximal length vary greatly and are the subject of much dispute. It possibly attains the greatest length among extant species of lizards, although it is considerably less massive than the Komodo dragon. Specimens are known to reach at least in length. but it has been claimed to grow much longer. A specimen measuring reportedly was caught in Konedobu by Dr. F. Barker. Claims that some specimens considerably exceed such lengths are so far unsupported. Claims of V. salvadorii attaining large weights also are unverified; the species is much more slender than Komodo dragons of comparable length. The typical reported length of this species is less than with a matching body mass of about .Pianka, E., D. King, R. King. 2004. Varanoid Lizards of the World. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press.Turner, F., R. Jennrich, J. Weintraub. 1969. Home ranges and body size of lizards. Ecology, 50: 1076-1081. However 10 adult specimens were found to weigh only at a length of , so even the aforementioned weight is fairly optimistic for this species. However, one must note that these specimens weren't fully mature since wild caught specimen have been known to grow over and breeders of this lizard have estimated that wild specimens can weigh up to . The average size of V. salvadorii caught in one study was with a weight of , but these must have been young specimens.Iyai, D.A., Murwanto, A.G. & Killian, A.M. (2011) Hunting and Ethnozoology Systems of Monitor Lizards (Fam. Varanidae) Utilized by Yaur Tribe at National Park of Cenderawasih Gulf. Biota Vol. 16 (2): 278−286. Varanus salvadorii has mammal-like aerobic abilities; a positive pressure gular pump in the animal's throat assists lung ventilation. Unlike most lizards that cannot breathe efficiently while running, because of Carrier's constraint, the gular pump of monitor lizards enables them to overcome the effect of one lung at a time being compressed by their running gait. The evolutionary development of the gular pump is functionally analogous to that of the diaphragm in mammals, which ventilates the lung independently of locomotion. V. salvadorii may be the species that achieves the greatest running endurance as a result of its gular pump. Investigation supports the idea that gular breathing is an evolutionary development that masks the effect of Carrier's constraint. Behavior A specimen of V. salvadorii at the Oklahoma City Zoo V. salvadorii is a highly arboreal lizard. It can hang onto branches with its rear legs, and occasionally using its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary function of the tail, however, is as a counterbalance when leaping from branch to branch. As in some other Varanus species, the tail also may be used for defense, as captive specimens may attempt to lash keepers with their tails. This species occasionally is seen in the pet trade, but has a reputation for aggression and unpredictability. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water. These monitors rise up on their hind legs to check their surroundings, behavior that also has been documented in Gould's monitors (V. gouldii). They are known to exhibit a warning posture, in which they carry their tails rolled up behind them. According to native belief, they give a warning call if they see crocodiles. In general V. salvadorii avoids human contact, but its bite is capable of causing infection, like the Komodo dragon's. One fatality was reported from a bite in 1983 when a Papuan woman was bitten and later died from an infection. Diet The teeth of V. salvadorii do not resemble those of other monitor species, which typically are blunt, peglike, and face slightly rearward. Their upper teeth are long, fang-like, set vertically in the jawbone, adapted to hooking into fast-moving prey such as birds, bats, and rodents. Their lower teeth are housed in a fleshy sheath. In the wild, V. salvadorii is the top predator in New Guinea, feeding on birds, eggs, small mammals, and carrion. Natives have reported that it can take down pigs, deer, and hunting dogs, and hauls its prey into the canopy to consume it. Captive specimens have been known to eat fish, frogs, rodents, chickens, and dog food. This species has been observed hunting prey in a unique fashion for monitor lizards. Rather than following its prey to ambush it from behind, V. salvadorii may stalk its prey and anticipate where it will run, meeting it headlong. Reproduction Reproduction of V. salvadorii has only been observed in captivity, so nothing is known about its reproduction in the wild. The egg clutches, comprising four to 12 eggs, are deposited around October to January, with the eggs showing a remarkable difference in dimensions, a phenomenon for which no explanation is known. Dimensions may vary from , while weight may vary from . Most clutches laid in captivity have been infertile, and only four successful breedings have been documented thus far. Hatchlings are about long and weigh around . Like those of many other monitors, the hatchlings of V. salvadorii are more colorful than adults, and feed primarily on insects and small reptiles. Conservation status Varanus salvadorii is currently protected under the CITES Appendix II, which requires an exportation permit for international trade. It is not listed on the IUCN Red List or the Endangered Species Act. It faces threats from deforestation and poaching, as it is hunted and skinned alive by native peoples, who consider the monitor an evil spirit that \\"climbs trees, walks upright, breathes fire, and kills men\\", to make drums . In 2008, 52 individuals were maintained at 17 zoological parks in the United States, with an unknown number in private collections.

He was born and died in Johannesburg, South Africa. He attended Parktown Boys' High School in 1922 and thereafter attended St John's College, Johannesburg from 1923 until 1926 where he matriculated.  Career  As a cricketer, Grieveson was a right-handed middle-order batsman and a wicketkeeper, though he did not always keep wicket for Transvaal, which had the services of Test wicketkeeper Jock Cameron until his death in 1935. Grieveson made his first-class cricket debut in 1929–30 and played for Transvaal intermittently over the next dozen seasons. He hit just one century: an unbeaten 107 against Griqualand West in 1933–34. In the 1938–39 season, the England touring team won a crushing victory in the third Test, after two drawn games, partly through misfielding by the South Africans; wicketkeeper Billy Wade was singled out for errors that were \\"particularly expensive\\". Wade was dropped for the fourth Test and Grieveson was his replacement as wicketkeeper. In a better performance by the South Africans in a rain-affected drawn match, he did not bat, but he took five catches and kept wicket \\"capably\\". Grieveson retained his place for the fifth and final Test of the series which, as neither side had a decisive lead in the rubber, was scheduled to be played out to a finish: a so-called \\"Timeless Test\\". In the event, the match was the longest ever played and was still left drawn, after the England team had to leave to catch their ship home at the end of the 10th day of play (one day of the 10 had been entirely lost to rain). Grieveson batted in both South African innings, scoring 75 and 39. The 75 was the highest debut score by a wicketkeeper from any Test-playing nation in a Test match to that time. He also took two catches and made three stumpings, and he conceded only eight byes in England's second innings of 654 for five wickets. The two Test matches represented virtually the end of Grieveson's cricket career: he played one further first-class match in 1939–40, but did not return to first-class cricket after the Second World War. He served in the War, reaching the rank of major and being awarded the OBE.

He was most famous for reviving and in part reinventing an otherwise lost late-15th- to early-16th-century textile dye technique known as (lit., flowers at the crossroads), which became the main focus for much of his life's work. Biography At the age of 14, left school to become the apprentice of , a Tokyo-based kimono artist who specialized in hand-painted dyework (a paste-resist-dyeing technique). also studied other techniques for decorating fabrics, as well as Japanese-style landscape painting and portraiture. first saw a fragment of fabric dyed in the style at the age of 20 in the Tokyo National Museum, and decided to devote his life to recreating it. Because no instructions survive that explain how to reproduce the complex decorative techniques seen in , and because the silk fabric necessary for its successful production (known as ) is no longer woven, was forced to experiment by himself for decades. In 1962, decided that there were too many technical problems surrounding his mission to recreate traditional , instead deciding to develop his own technique, known as using a modern smooth crepe fabric (known as ) for and synthetic dyestuffs for natural ones. In 1977, when was 60 years old, he displayed his decorated kimono for the first time in an exhibition in Tokyo.

As a missionary he travelled to Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya and has written books on Christianity. He was the founding prior of the Priory of Saints Louis and Mary (later Saint Louis Abbey) in Saint Louis, Missouri. Biography=Early years Born in London in 1903, Evelyn Cary-Elwes was one of eight children of Charles and Edythe Cary-Elwes. His father and maternal grandfather, Sir John Roper Parkington, were champagne shippers, the family all speaking fluent French. He was educated by the Jesuits at Saint Michel, Brussels, between 1913 and 1914, and then at Ampleforth College, a leading English Catholic school, then worked in the family wine business until in 1923 he was clothed in the Benedictine order at Ampleforth, his abbot giving him the name of Columba. In 1925 he professed his simple vows and the following year made his solemn vows. In 1927 he matriculated at Oxford to study modern languages (French and Spanish) at the university's Benedictine foundation, St Benet's Hall. After graduating in 1930, Cary-Elwes went on to study theology at Blackfriars, London, until 1933, when he was ordained a priest. He then returned to Ampleforth, where he served as Monastic Librarian, as a language teacher in the school, and as housemaster of St. Wilfrid's House (1937–51). He led services at the chapel at Helmsley for several years. Later years In 1951, he was appointed Prior of Ampleforth, and four years later, was selected to be the founding prior of the new foundation at Saint Louis, where he served until June 1967. Columba left in 1968 for East Africa to conduct spiritual retreats and inquire about establishing a monastic foundation in that region. In 1968, his travels took him to Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. During 1969, he taught at a major seminary in Nairobi. In 1970, he served as French interpreter during the Pope's visit to Uganda, after which he returned to Ampleforth. In 1972, he was \\"loaned\\" (as his Ampleforth obituary describes it), to the Benedictines of Glenstal Abbey in Ireland, to help establish a monastery in Eke, Nigeria, in 1974, where he served as Prior beginning in 1975. Columba was a close friend of the noted historian Arnold J. Toynbee, who educated several of his sons at Ampleforth. In 1986, their correspondence, edited by the Saint Louis lawyer Christian Peper, is collected in An Historian's Conscience.A Historian's Conscience, at Amazon.com.An Historian's Conscience, edited by Christian Peper During this period he also helped to establish a Catholic seminary in Cameroon. In his later years, he returned to Ampleforth, but made ecumenical and spiritual renewal visits to Catholic communities and clerical establishments in the Philippines, Australia, India, and Chile. At nearly 90, he was appointed the Titular Abbot of Westminster in 1992. Columba died on 22 January 1994 at York Hospital. He was buried at Ampleforth. Family Columba Cary-Elwes is related to the painters Dominick Elwes and Simon Elwes and the diplomat and tenor Gervase Cary Elwes, respectively the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather of the actor Cary Elwes, the painter Damian Elwes, and the film producer Cassian Elwes.

In 1958, a series experiments using a miniature rocket sled began at Holloman AFB under the supervision of Colonel John Stapp and Captain Beeding. Participants rode the \\"Daisy Sled\\" (so-called because it was originally designed to be air, and not rocket, powered) at various speeds and in many different positions — even head first — in an attempt to learn more about the g-force limits of the human body. On May 16, Capt. Eli Beeding prepared to make a 40 g run. The Daisy shot down the track, reached a top speed around 35 mph, and came to a screeching halt in less than a tenth of a second. \\"When I hit the water brake,\\" Beeding recalled in a recent interview, \\"It felt like Ted Williams had hit me on the back, about lumbar five, with a baseball bat.\\" Beeding had barely informed flight surgeon Capt. Les Eason of his troubles when he began to experience tunnel vision and passed out. It was a scary moment, since the standard protocol for shock would be to elevate Beeding's feet. Yet there was a chance his back was broken, in which case he shouldn't be touched. Taking a calculated risk, Eason and Tech. Sgt. Roy Gatewood gently moved Beeding onto the side of the sled and elevated his feet. Ten minutes later, Beeding emerged from shock and was rushed to the base hospital. Doctors determined his back was only badly bruised. \\"I thought that was the big excitement of the day,” Beeding recalls. \\"But later my boss came to me and said, ‘The chest accelerometer tracing shows you got 82.6 g!’\\" Subsequent tests with bears showed that the reading was not a fluke, and that Beeding had indeed endured a massive g load. When word got out, the young captain made headlines as the man who had topped John Stapp's g-force record. Beeding however is quick to point out that he rode the sled backwards, and that his time at 83 gs was “infinitesimal” compared to the 1.1 second durations Stapp faced during his own tests. “That doesn’t sound like much (time),” Beeding notes, “But I guarantee you, having been through it at lesser durations, one second is an eternity.” Still, the incident was wholly remarkable and made Beeding a hero and, for several decades thereafter, his name appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records. Guinness and many other sources incorrectly reported that Beeding endured 82.6 gs for 0.04 seconds. Beeding's sled in fact deccelerated at 40.4 gs for 0.04 seconds as it slowed from 35 mph to a stop over a distance of one foot. 82.6 gs was a brief peak acceleration measured by a sensor on his chest due to elastic response of his rib cage. Beeding retired from the Air Force in 1971, later moving to Colorado where he died in 2013 at the age of 85.

Her husband insisted that she was married to him, and her sexual fidelity was owed to him, not God. She was therefore physically abused for her refusal to submit to him, and for her late night visits to churches. When widowed, she was still a virgin, and dedicated herself to charity. Veneration The cult of Pharaildis has been documented as early as the ninth century. She carries a goose as her insignia. Her feast day is January 4, and her feast, Fru Verelde, was a major festival in Ghent in the late 19th century (according to Acte de Pharailde 1882). Several miracles are attributed to the saint. Legend says that Pharaildis caused a well to spring up whose waters cured sick children, turned some bread hidden by a miserly woman into stone, and there are accounts of a \\"goose miracle,\\" in which Pharaildis resuscitated a cooked bird working only from its skin and bones.

He was the only ruler of Former Liang to formally declare a break from Jin Dynasty (265-420), and historical sources variously report him as having declared himself an emperor (per Jin Shu) or a prince (per Zizhi Tongjian). He was commonly viewed as a usurper (having seized the throne from his nephew Zhang Yaoling after his brother Zhang Chonghua's death) and initially not acknowledged as a Former Liang ruler, but his brother Zhang Tianxi later nevertheless gave him the posthumous name of Wei.  During the reigns of Zhang Chonghua and Zhang Yaoling  Little is known about Zhang Zuo's personal background, other than that he was Zhang Jun's oldest son, but was not designated heir apparent. His younger brother Zhang Chonghua was, even though neither was born of Zhang Jun's wife Princess Yan. Neither his mother nor his birth year was recorded in history. He was praised for being strong, brave and knowledgeable, and either Zhang Jun or Zhang Chonghua created him the Marquess of Changning. During the reign of his brother Zhang Chonghua, Zhang Zuo was trusted by his brother, and despite warnings by Chang Ju () and Xie Ai, Zhang Chonghua, for a long time, intended for Zhang Zuo to serve as regent for his son Zhang Yaoling. Late in 353, however, as Zhang Chonghua was gravely ill, he ordered that Xie be recalled to be warrant—but Zhang Zuo and Zhang Chonghua's attendants Zhao Zhang () and Wei Qi (), who had conspired to take over power, blocked Zhang Chonghua's order and instead forged an order making Zhang Zuo regent. Zhang Chonghua soon died, and he was succeeded by Zhang Yaoling, at age nine, but real power was in Zhang Zuo's hands. Zhang Zuo, who had by this point engaged in an affair with Zhang Chonghua's mother Princess Dowager Ma, soon made his move to formally take over. With Princess Ma's approval, Zhang Yaoling was deposed in early 354 and replaced with Zhang Zuo, who soon showed his cruel side, as he put Xie Ai and Zhang Chonghua's wife Princess Pei to death.  Reign  Early in 354, Zhang Zuo declared a clear break from Jin—a move that none of his predecessors had dared to do. He completely repudiated the Jin era name Jianxing (declared by Emperor Min of Jin and used in at least some facility by every Zhang patriarch since his grandfather Zhang Shi () and changed the era name to Heping. He also declared himself a greater title than the Jin-bestowed Duke of Xiping—although what that title was is a matter of historical controversy, as Jin Shu indicated that he declared himself emperor (and created his wife Lady Xin empress and his sons princes) and Zizhi Tongjian indicated that he declared himself Prince of Liang, although the inclusion by Jin Shu of a declaration of independence by Zhang Zuo appears to lend credibility to the Jin Shu account. Later that year, Zhang Zuo nevertheless sent his general Wang Zhuo () to assist the Jin general Sima Xun, who was commanding an auxiliary force in conjunction with the main force commanded by Huan Wen against Former Qin. Wang submitted a report to Zhang Zuo stating that Huan was capable of commanding large armies and had great ambition, which caused Zhang Zuo to panic. Oddly, he decided to assassinate Wang, but failed. He then mobilized his troops, ready to resist Huan or to flee in case Huan destroyed Former Qin and then turned his attention on him. After Huan was forced to withdraw after his food supplies ran out, however, Zhang Zuo attacked Wang, forcing Wang to surrender to Former Qin. Zhang Zuo's rule, according to traditional accounts, was one filled with debauchery, cruelty, and extravagance. He was said to not only had an affair with Princess Dowager Ma, but committed incest with all of Zhang Chonghua's daughters. He became apprehensive of his general Zhang Guan (), so he sent Zhang Guan on an expedition, but sent another army to ambush him. The news leaked, however, and Zhang Guan turned his army against the capital Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu). He declared that Zhang Zuo should be deposed and Zhang Yaoling should be restored. He was soon joined by another major general, Song Hun (). In response, Zhang Zuo had his young nephew put to death by beating. That action could not save him, however, as Zhang Guan and Song continued their advances on the capital. Zhang Zuo ordered that Zhang Guan's brother Zhang Ju () and son Zhang Song () be arrested and executed, but instead Zhang Ju and Zhang Son started an uprising within Guzang and opened the city gates to welcome in Song's forces. Zhang Zuo's former coconspirators Zhao Zhang and Wei Qi became apprehensive and forced Princess Dowager Ma to declare Zhang Chonghua's younger son Zhang Xuanjing as the new ruler. Guards still loyal to Zhang Zuo killed Zhao and Wei, but soon fell apart in the confusion, and Zhang Zuo was killed. Song cut off his head and put his two sons to death.

A republican sympathiser who briefly served under Sun Yat-Sen, he was a teacher of and an important influence on Zhang Zuolin's son, Zhang Xueliang. Citing desire to avoid civil war, he led a three-month rebellion against Zhang Zuolin which led to his defeat and execution. Youth and formative years Guo Songling was born in 1883 in a village on the outskirts of Mukden, the capital of Fengtian Province, Qing China, which is modern day Shengyang, with a traditional ancestral hometown of Taiyuan in Central China. In 1905, the Viceroy of Manchuria Zhao Erxun set up the Fengtian Primary Army School, to which 22 year old Guo Songling was admitted. On high marks, he was recommended the following year to enter the Baoding Military Academy, Northern China's premier military academy. In 1907, he graduated and joined the Qing Dynasty's Qing New Army as a sergeant in Mukden. In 1909, general Zhu Qinglan became the guard commander, and Zhu became a close patron of Guo. When Zhu's post was rotated, Guo followed Zhu to a new post in Sichuan province. In divisions overseen by Zhu, the revolutionary secret society Chinese Revolutionary League (Tongmenghui), was active and was tolerated. Guo Songling joined the Tongmenghui in 1910.  Military career  In 1911, during the Railway Protection Movement, the Sichuan Tongmenghui erupted in protest against the Qing government, encircling Chengdu. Guo Songling however did not participate in this uprising and, now the battalion commander for Northern Chengdu, was able to diplomatically put it down without bloodshed. Suspected of republican sympathies, Guo Songling was relieved of his command by Sichuan Governor-General Zhao Erfeng, only recovering it after the appeals of his patron Zhu Qinglan. Late in the same year, the Xinhai Revolution broke out and spread to Sichuan. Sichuan declared independence and in Chengdu formed the \\"Chinese Military Government of Sichuan\\". During this period out-of-province officers like Zhu Qinglan were pushed out of the military government in favor of local Sichuanese officers. With his patron removed, Guo Songling resigned decided to return to Manchuria.  Constitution Protection Movement  In July 1917, Sun Yat-Sen declared the Constitution Protection Movement in opposition to the Beiyang clique warlords that had taken over the national government, establishing a military government in Guangzhou. Guo's patron Zhu Qinglan allied himself with Sun and took up a post as governor of Guangdong Province under Sun, and Guo Songlian followed his mentor to Guangdong. During this period Guo served on the staff of the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan Border Supervision Offices, and the head of the Guangdong Military Battalion. As a young officer, he gained the praise of Sun Yat-Sen. In May 1918, Sun Yat- Sen dissolved the Guangzhou military government under pressure from warlords, and Guo Songlian returned to Fengtian.  Fengtian Clique General  In 1919, Zhang Zuolin formed the Manchurian Army Military Academy 东三省陆军讲武堂, and Guo Songling was appointed as instructor in military tactics. One of his students was Zhang Xueliang's son Zhang Xieliang, who held Guo's capability in deep esteem. In 1920, Zhang Xueliang graduated from the Military Academy and was appointed a brigade commander in the Fengtian Army, and upon Zhang Xueliang's recommendation Guo was appointed to be the younger Zhang's chief of staff. As chief of staff, Guo trained the younger Zhang's brigade into one of the best brigades in the Fengtian army. In July of that year, the Zhili–Anhui War erupted, and Guo was appointed by Zhang Zuolin as commander of an allied force with the Zhili clique against the Anhui clique. Guo's forces decisively beat the Anhui forces in Tianjin, and he grew more and more in Zhang Zuolin's confidence. In 1921, Zhang Zuolin expanded the Fengtian army into ten mixed brigades, with the third directed by Zhang Xueliang and the eighth directed by Guo Songling. The third and eighth brigades formed a united command, and Guo Songling took charge of operations and training for both divisions. In May 1922, the First Zhili–Fengtian War broke out, and the Fengtian clique suffered heavy losses, but the elite third and eighth brigades were able to retreat without much casualties. Afterwards Zhang Zuolin established the Army Organizational Department 陆军整理处, with Zhang Xueliang as Chief-of-Staff and Guo Songling as Acting Chief of staff, in charge of military organization, order and training. Dissatisfaction with Zhang Zuolin and rebellion During the Second Zhili–Fengtian War a personal grievance over a friend's removal from command caused him to retreat and nearly cost his army the war. A sense that he was being under-appreciated, along with gradual encouragement by Guominjun rival Feng Yuxiang to help put Zhang's more liberal son on the Manchurian throne, led to his mutiny in mid-1925. Marching his division north towards Zhang's headquarters at Shenyang on 22 November, Guo met success in the early weeks of the offensive. However, when the city's Japanese garrison interfered in defence of Zhang and neither the expected popular support or assistance of the Guominjun appeared, his rebellion stalled. Within the month his forces were surrounded by the Fengtian Army and annihilated. Guo and his wife were captured on 24 December 1925 and executed the next day. ReferencesSources *Dupuy, Trevor N.

It is most commonly found in English poetry produced in the 16th and 17th centuries. Fourteeners often appear as rhymed couplets, in which case they may be seen as ballad stanza or common metre hymn quatrains in two rather than four lines. The term may also be used as a synonym for quatorzain, a 14-line poem, such as a sonnet. Background Poulter's measure is a meter consisting of alternate Alexandrines combined with Fourteeners, to form a poem of 12 and 14 syllable lines. It was often used in the Elizabethan era. The term was coined by George Gascoigne, because poulters, or poulterers (sellers of poultry), would sometimes give 12 to the dozen, and other times 14 (see also Baker's dozen).Attridge, Derrick. The Rhythms of English Poetry. p.93. Longman: New York When the poulter's measure couplet is divided at its caesurae, it becomes a short measure stanza, a quatrain of 3, 3, 4, and 3 feet. Examples of this form are Nicholas Grimald's A Truelove; Lord Brooke's Epitaph on Sir Phillip Sydney; Nicholas Breton's Phyllis in the Oxford Book of Sixteenth Century Verse.Boultom Marjorie, The Anatomy of Poetry, Routledge and Kegan, London, 1953 In the early 17th century, George Chapman famously used the fourteener when he produced one of the first English translations of Homer's Iliad. Two centuries later, in his \\"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer,\\" John Keats expressed his appreciation for what he called the \\"loud and bold\\" quality of Chapman's translation, which he implicitly contrasted with the more prestigious but more tightly controlled heroic couplets of Alexander Pope's 18th-century translation, thereby using one type of fourteener (a sonnet) to comment on the other (iambic heptameter). Samuel Johnson in his Lives of The English Poets comments upon the importance of fourteeners to later English lyric forms saying \\"as these lines had their caesura always at the eighth syllable, it was thought in time commodious to divide them; and quatrains of lines alternately consisting of eight and six syllables make the most soft and pleasing of our lyric measures\\".Johnson, Samuel, Lives of the English Poets—Dryden, 1779 These quatrains of eight and six syllables (or more loosely, lines of 4, 3, 4, and 3 beats) are known as common meter. C. S. Lewis, in his English Literature in the Sixteenth Century, castigates the 'lumbering' poulter's measure (p. 109). He attributes the introduction of this 'terrible' meter to Thomas Wyatt (p. 224). In a more extended analysis (pp. 231–2), he comments: > The medial break in the alexandrine, though it may do well enough in French, > becomes intolerable in a language with such a tyrannous stress-accent as > ours: the line struts. The fourteener has a much pleasanter movement, but a > totally different one: the line dances a jig. The poets Surrey, Tuberville, Gascoigne, Balassone, Golding and others all used the Poulter's Measure, the rhyming fourteener with authority.Schmidt, Michael, Lives of the PoetsWeidenfeld & Nicholson,The Orion Publishing Group,1998  Illustrations  *William Blake used lines of fourteen syllables, for example in The Book of Thel.

Islam is the predominant religion in Senegal. 96 percent of the country's population is estimated to be Muslim, mainly Sunni of Maliki school of thought with Sufi influences. Islam has had a presence in Senegal since the 11th century. Sufi brotherhoods expanded with French colonization, as people turned to religious authority rather than the colonial administration. The main Sufi orders are the Tijaniyyah, the Muridiyyah or Mourides, and to a lesser extent, the pan- Islamic Qadiriyyah and the smaller Layene order. Approximately 5-10% of the Muslims are Shiites and 1% of the Muslims follow the Ahmadiyya thought.  History = Introduction of Islam  A mosque in Ndar, Senegal. For nearly a millennium, there has been an Islamic presence in Senegal. Islam's influence in the area began with the conversion of King of Takrur, War Jabi in 1040, likely as a result of the Trans-Saharan trade between North and West Africa. The King attempted to convert his subjects, who are now referred to as Tukulors or the Toucouleur people, in the first attempt to convert an entire region in this area. Other empires, such as the Jolof empire, were more resistant to Islam in favor of their traditional religion. Even in areas where an Islamic presence was found, many continued traditional animist practices, according to Portuguese accounts.  Expansion of Islam  During the 17th and 18th centuries, Islam was used as a structure of power and militarism. In the 17th century, Islam became the religion of the elite and merchant classes. In 1776, the Tukulors overthrew the Denianke Dynasty and constructed a theocratic ogliarchy. Influenced by other Islamic movements throughout West Africa, they worked militaristically to convert traditional religious states and establish Muslim theocratic states. This expansion ceased temporarily when the Tukulors failed to convert the traditional states of the Serer, who defeated them and killed their 19th-century leader Maba Diakhou Ba at the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune in order to preserve their Serer religious faith. One such movement from Western Sudan was the Qadiriyya Sufi brotherhood, who traversed the Senegalese countryside gaining followers. This movement was eclipsed by the Tijaniyyah brotherhood.  French colonialism and Islam  During the 18th century, the French began to colonize the nation. Senegalese Muslims took a variety of responses to French colonization. Especially in the countryside, the Senegalese joined Sufi brotherhoods to unite against colonization. The popularity of the Tijaniyyah brotherhood marks this shift; Islam became “a rallying point for African resistance to the French.\\" El Hadj Umar Tall first created a Tijani brotherhood in West Africa after he was initiated into the Tijaniyya during his hajj to Mecca. In his attempt to create a Tijani Islamic empire in Senegal, Tall is described as the “most eminent of the Muslim clerical warriors.\\" The marabouts, leaders and sources of guidance in Sufi brotherhoods, became alternative sources of authority in dissidence from the French. Later, the Mouride brotherhood would serve this same role of resistance for the Senegalese. Many Mourides were former political authorities who lost their positions as the French took over, and were searching for a new source of power. The French felt threatened and targeted the leaders of these movements. The founder of the Mourides, Cheikh Amadou Bamba was arrested twice by the colonial administration. This injustice only furthered his popularity and the Mourides’ extreme veneration of their leader. To this day, Cheikh Bamba is honored as an important leader of resistance in Senegal. Other Muslims chose to cooperate with the French, and even gain positions of power within the French government. Senegal was the only colony in Black Africa in which the French used “assimilationist tactics”, allowing elite Senegalese citizenship and political power if they became assimilated into French culture. In the cities, especially the Four Communes the French created, Muslim Sufi marabouts, religious authorities, were involved in Senegalese politics. Some argue that the marabouts collaborated with the French out of best interests for Senegal, because they felt they had no other choice. However, Muslim Reform movements responded angrily to the marabouts’ collaboration with French authorities, calling these moves hypocritical. The most common of these Reformists was the Union Culturelle Musulmane, founded by Cheikh Toure in 1953, led by religious scholars, some of whom studied in Cairo universities. These Reformists were responding to French colonial repression of Islamic culture in Senegal. As Mbacke’ states, the administration's “ultimate aim was to dominate minds” in order to take over the nation, and they saw Islam as standing in their way. Having enforced a secular state, the French also limited the establishment of Qur'anic schools, created secular rather than Islamic curriculum in public schools, restricted public access books on Islamic topics, limited contacts with Senegal and the Middle East, restricted hajj pilgrimages to Mecca, arrested and killed Muslim scholars.  Sufi Islam = Sufi brotherhoods  In Senegal, 95% of Muslims belong to a Sufi brotherhood, more than any Muslim population in the world. The two largest orders are the Tijaniyyah and the Muridiyyah or Mourides, although the pan-Islamic Qadiriyyah and the smaller Layene brotherhood are also represented in parts of the country. In creating a brotherhood, each founder often has the objective of uniting all Muslims. However, in practice, those within a brotherhood often emphasize the superiority of their brotherhood's path over others. Mosques are created by specific brotherhoods, though individuals are free to attend whichever mosque they prefer. The Qadiriyyah is the smallest and oldest brotherhood in Senegal. It was introduced in the 18th and 19th century by missionaries from Mauritania and the Niger Bend. More Senegalese Sufis identify with the Tijaniyya order than any other. This order was brought to Senegal by El Hadj Umar Tall (1780-1840), who attempted to create an Islamic empire and organize all Muslims. Though he largely failed during his lifetime, the order has since expanded greatly. The Tijanis place a strong emphasis on Koranic education, and have created schools for girls as well. There are three dynasties of Tijanis, depending on the marabout a following owes most allegiance to: the Sy and Niasse in Wolof and Serer, and the Tall in Tukulor. The Niasses are sometimes seen as radical and a threat to Senegalese national authority, but Tijanis have otherwise maintained strong relationships with the Senegalese government. The Mouride order is the most tightly organized and influential of Senegal's Sufi brotherhoods. When first created, the Mourides proclaimed their superiority over the Tijaniyya, who in turn responded with violent repression of the Mourides. The Mourides were founded by Cheikh Ahmadou Bamba (1850-1927) who strongly rejected the French colonial powers, and this position attracted many political leaders who lost their positions due to French occupation. Every year, thousands of Senegal make a pilgrimage to Touba for a religious festival held by the Mourides to honor Cheikh Bamba. Many have written of the Mourides because a deviationist faction of this brotherhood has become radical and at times dangerous. This faction does not represent a majority of Mourides and a Pew Report on Senegalese religion revealed that 92% of Senegalese do not associate the word \\"violent\\" with Muslims. The Layene are a small but growing Sufi brotherhood. They are often rejected by the larger Muslim population for beliefs some call un-Islamic, including their founder's assertion that he was a Prophet. A mosque in Kaolack, Senegal.  Practices  The Sufi brotherhoods or tariqas in Senegal are organized in elaborate hierarchies. The most powerful leader is the caliph-general, a term enforced by the colonial French and only used in Mouride and Layene orders. The founder of the brotherhood is its first caliph-general, and his position is inherited by succeeders. Secondary to the caliph-generals are shaykhs or marabouts, who act as intermediaries and provide instruction for their murids, or aspirants. Marabouts rely on donations from their followers, called murids or taalibes. In turn, marabouts work with their followers, often arranging marriages or resolving disputes. Followers perform the harsh work of tending to the caliph's peanut or grain fields, and \\"the most ambitious or lucky ones\\" assist the caliph with his private or public affairs with the hope of receiving spiritual teachings. Traditionally, parents often sent their children to live with their marabout and become taalibes. These children may engage in harsh work in the countryside, or beg for donations in urban areas. This practice has sparked a response from UNICEF and other human rights organizations, who argue call these practices child abuse. These Western organizations often claim this problem is new and on the rise. They associate this practice with parents' inabilities to raise their children, economic strain, or uncontrolled fertility. On the contrary, scholars have found that this practice has existed for centuries, acts as a source of moral training for children, and is actually in decline. Members of brotherhoods also create smaller associations or daairas within their communities. These groups meet informally to sing religious songs, pray, engage in other types of devotion, and discuss the history of their brotherhood. They also organize religious activities, such as trips to see their marabout. Daairas may be created by residents of a neighborhood, employees of a business, or students at a university. These associations revitalize the connection between marabout and follower, even when separated by distance. Daairas are present in all Senegalese brotherhoods.  Women and leadership  Senegalese women are active in Sufi brotherhoods. They often organize or play significant roles within daairas, a brotherhood's smaller community associations. Women play a public role in the community doing volunteer work, collecting money for the marabout, organizing religious visits, or promoting the daaira's activities on the radio or television. Though rare, women can even become spiritual leaders or marabouts within the brotherhood. The Mourides have had one female marabout, Sokhna Magat Diop, who inherited her father's position. Qadiriyya women have also attained the position of marabout. Senegal has already had a female Muslim prime minister, Mame Madior Boye.  Shia Islam  Shia Islam in Senegal is practiced by a growing number of Senegalese people, as well as by the Lebanese community in Senegal. Shia Islam is the primary religion of the Lebanese community in Senegal, which has been established in Senegal for over a century. It is also practiced by a growing number of native Senegalese, including the Wolof and Fula peoples. Since the 1970s, and especially with the arrival of the Mozdahir community and their leader Cherif Mohamed Aly Aidara in the early 2000s, the number of native Shi'i Senegalese has steadily increased in both urban and rural areas.Leichtman, Mara A. (2016). Interview on book with ISLAMiCommentary, a Public Scholarship Forum Managed by the Duke Islamic Studies Center. Transcultural Islam Research Network. According to Leichtman (2017), Mozdahir's various rural development projects help bridge the urban-rural divide among Shi'i Muslims in Senegal, and have helped to increase the number of Shi'i Muslims in Senegal.Leichtman, Mara A. (2017). The NGO-ization of Shi'i Islam in Senegal: Bridging the Urban-Rural Divide. ECAS7: 7th European Conference on African Studies. Basel, 29 June - 1 July 2017.  Popular culture  The importance of Sufism is evident in Senegal's modern popular culture. Nearly every Senegalese singer has a song incorporating themes of Sufi history. Especially common are praise songs honoring individual Sufi leaders, as well as work having to do with the controversy of spiritual leaders involving themselves in politics. International stars such as Baaba Maal and Youssou N'Dour incorporate Sufi themes into their work. Youssou N'Dour's entire album Egypt deals with Sufism. N'Dour describes the album as an exploration of his own personal faith, as well as a means of connecting North African and Arab Islam to West African Sufism.

Personal life  Kornbluth was born in 1959 to mother \\"Bunny\\" and father Paul, the oldest of four children. Raised in New York City, he briefly attended Princeton University but dropped out, never completing his undergraduate degree. He worked as a copyeditor in New York before moving to San Francisco in 1987. He is married to wife Sara Sato, with whom he has a son, Guthrie. Since 2012, Kornbluth has participated in the annual Team in Training endurance bike ride, a fundraiser for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. In 2014, Kornbluth served as the inaugural artist in residence for the Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco. In 2017, Kornbluth served as an Atlantic Fellow with the Global Brain Health Institute at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center.  Career =Overview Kornbluth's live and filmed works are almost entirely solo monologues based closely on events and people his life, his upbringing, and his career. As such he is among a small group of artists that includes Eric Bogosian, Lily Tomlin, and Spalding Gray. Most of Kornbluth's monologues relate to personal and societal ethics, self- fulfillment, and the role of the individual in society, drawing a connection between his own personal foibles and larger issues of citizenship. Playing a hapless, sincere, and sometimes buffoonish everyman caught up in world events, he demonstrates the relevance of these concepts to daily life.

Bhinamal was a bhil kingdom in past It is south of Jalore town. Bhinmal was the capital of Gurjaradesa, comprising southern Rajasthan and northern Gujarat of modern times. The town is the birthplace of the Sanskrit poet Magha and mathematician-astronomer Brahmagupta.  History  The original name of Bhinmal was bhillamala, the plateau of Bhils. It was the early capital of the kingdom of Gurjaradesa, a name derived from the Gurjara people. The kingdom is first attested in Bana's Harshacharita (7th century AD). Its king is said to have been subdued by Harsha's father Prabhakaravardhana (died c. 605 AD). The surrounding kingdoms were mentioned as Sindha (Sindh), Lāta (southern Gujarat) and Malava (western Malwa), indicating that the region included northern Gujarat and southern Rajasthan. Xuanzang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim who visited India between 631-645 AD during Harsha's reign, mentioned the Gurjara country (Kiu-che-lo) with its capital at Bhillamala (Pi-lo-mo-lo) as the second largest kingdom of Western India. He distinguished it from the neighbouring kingdoms of Bharukaccha (Bharuch), Ujjayini (Ujjain), Malava (Malwa), Valabhi and Surashtra. The Gurjara kingdom was said to have measured 833 miles in circuit and its ruler was a 20-year old kshatriya, who was distinguished for his wisdom and courage. It is believed that the king must have been the immediate successor of the Chavda dynasty ruler Vyāgrahamukha, under whose reign the mathematician- astronomer Brahmagupta wrote his famous treatise in 628 AD. The Arab chroniclers of Sindh (an Arab province from 712 CE onward), narrated the campaigns of Arab governors on Jurz, the Arabic term for Gurjara. They mentioned it jointly with Mermad (Marumāda, in Western Rajasthan) and Al Baylaman (Bhinmal).; ; The country was first conquered by Mohammad bin Qasim (712-715) and, for a second time, by Junayd (723-726). Upon bin Qasim's victory, Al-Baladhuri mentioned that the Indian rulers, including that of Bhinmal, accepted Islam and paid tribute. They presumably recanted after bin Qasim's departure, which made Junayd's attack necessary. After Junayd's reconquest, the kingdom at Bhinmal appears to have been annexed by the Arabs. A new dynasty was founded by Nagabhata I at Jalore, in the vicinity of Bhinmal, in about 730 CE, soon after Junayd's end of term in Sindh. Nagabhata is said to have defeated the \\"invincible Gurjaras,\\" presumably those of Bhinmal. Another account credits him for having defeated a \\"Muslim ruler.\\" Nagabhata is also known to have repelled the Arabs during a later raid. His dynasty later expanded to Ujjain and called itself Pratihara. Nagabhata's successor Vatsaraja lost Ujjain to the Rashtrakuta prince Dhruva, who claimed to have driven him into \\"trackless desert\\", which might mean that Vatsaraja withdrew to Bhinmal. An inscription in Daulatpura from 843 AD mentions Vatsaraja having made grants near Didwana. In due course, the Pratiharas became the dominant force of the entire Rajasthan and Gujarat regions, establishing a powerful empire centered at Kannauj, the former capital of Harshavardhana. Ala ud din Khilji as the second ruler of the Khilji dynasty also destroyed and looted Srimala (ancient Bhinmal) when he conquered Jalore in 1310 AD. Prior to that, Srimala was a premier city of northwestern India. The city was laid out in the shape of a square. It has 84 gates. The mid-15th- century chronicle Kanhadade Prabandha provides descriptions of indiscriminate attacks by Muslims on Bhinmal. The city of Bhinmal had four gates. At a distance of 8 kilometres in the north there was the Jalori gate, in the south Laxmi gate, in the east the Sun gate and in the west Sanchori gate.  Hinduism and Jainism  According to the Chinese traveller Xuanzang, the King of Bhinmal was a believer in Buddhism and Jainism and a man of exceptional abilities. Brahmanism and Jainism dominated the city. There was only one Buddhist monastery with 100 monks in 'Buddha Vaas' neighbourhood. There were several temples of Jain Tirthankar and Hindu gods such as Ganapati, Kshetrapala, Chandikadevi, and Shiva. The Sun temple of Bhinmal known as Jagatsvami was one of the earliest and most famous temples of Rajasthan. The temple had beautiful torana (archway). The temple was perhaps built during the reign of Gurjara Pratiharas who were sun worshippers. In ancient time, the festival was held at temple in the Hindu calendar month of Asvin. There were also a number of Jain temples, the one of Mahavira (Mhaveerji) being the most famous. This temple was built by king Kumarapala and established by Acharya Hemachandra, dedicated to 1st Jain Tirthankar Rishabha. Currently, the temple is dedicated to the 24th Jain Tirthankar Mahavira, re-established by Vidhyachandra Suri of Tapagachha, belonging to the Tristutik sect. Stone inscriptions of the year 1333 of the Vikrama Samvat (1277 AD) are found among ruins of some ancient temples across the town. There are signs that Lord Mahavira Swami, the 24th Jain Tirthankar, wandered here, known as 'jeevit swami'. This city has witnessed many rises and falls. Stone inscriptions of the year 1333 of the Vikrama Samvat (1277 AD) are found among ruins of temples. There are signs here and there showing that Lord Mahavira Swami, the 24th Jain Tirthankar wandered about here. They can provide historical evidence to researchers. There was a time when this city had a circumference of 64 kilometres and the fort had 84 gates. This city looked beautiful with hundreds of pinnacled temples. From the 7th to the 10th century, talented Jain monk/writer Acharya Haribhadra, Mundas Gani, Udayprabhsuri, Mahnedrsuri, Rajendrasuri and many more created here valuable Jain literature and sanctified and beautified this place. The temple of the 23rd Jain Tirthankar Parshvanatha in Hathi pole area is regarded to be very ancient. This temple has great archaeological importance. A golden idol of Shri Parshvanatha in Padmasana posture is the presiding deity. Apart from the many ancient Jain temples across the town, there is a temple of Jains called 72 Jinalayas - the 72 temple complex with the 72 Tirthakar (24 past + 24 future + 24 current) as per Jainism. It is the largest Jain temple which conclude 19 years of its making. It was made by a family of builders loonkars the owners of a modern leading company Sumer. Another significant temple complex dedicated to Mahavir Swami and Osia Mataji called as Bafna Waddi Tirth is there just outside the town. Out of 108 Parshvanatha, \\"Shri Bhaya-Bhanjan Parshvanatha\\" is also located in the town where thousands of Jain and other pilgrims come to the town and offer their prayer here.

He is known for the composition of two texts on mathematics and astronomy: The Brahmasphutasiddhanta in 628, and the Khandakhadyaka in 665. The Sanskrit poet Magha, the author of Sisupalavadha, lived here in 680 AD. The Jain scholar Siddharshi Gani, a resident of Bhinmal wrote Upmitibahava prapancha katha in 905 AD.

The size of Pulau Bukom is about . Pulau Bukom is also known as Pulau Bukom Besar, which has a small companion islet to its south called Pulau Bukom Kechil. This companion islet is currently connected to Pulau Ular and Pulau Busing by reclaimed land, making the three of them appear as one large island on satellite imagery. Etymology The island's name is thought to come from the Malay name for a seashell called rangkek bukom, which is wide at one end and tapers to a narrow point, the shape of the island prior to land reclamation. Bukum is said to be the same as hukum, and there is a tradition that the Raja used to try cases on the island, hence the name, probably through the intermediate form berhukum.Moey, N. (1991). The Shell endeavour: First 100 years in Singapore. Singapore: Shell Companies in Singapore, p. 28 History The island was home to the native Malay islanders before government efforts to relocate them back to mainland Singapore for redevelopment. Pulau Bukom appears in Franklin and Jackson's 1828 map as Po. Bukum. The island, originally a mangrove swamp, was also a source of fresh water for ships. In 1884, a trader named Gagino established a water company on the island to supply water to passing ships.

It depicts the gritty life of the Mumbai underworld, including prostitution, dance bars and gun crime. The film stars Tabu and Atul Kulkarni in lead roles. It also stars Ananya Khare, Rajpal Yadav, Minakshi Sahani and Vishal Thakkar. The film was a critically acclaimed hit and it won four National Film Awards.  Plot  Mumtaz (Tabu) is a naive young rural woman whose family is killed in communal riots. After her village is burnt to the ground, she moves to Mumbai with her uncle, the only family member she has left. They are desperately poor and her uncle persuades her to become a bar girl (dancer) at Chandni Bar and emotionally blackmails her when she refuses. He promises her that this is merely temporary, until he is able to get a job. Mumtaz is shy and loathes the work, but she forces herself to dance and flirt. However, her uncle doesn't keep his word; he lives on her earnings, drinking them away, and never gets a job. One night, after spending time drinking and watching the girls dance at the bar, Mumtaz's uncle rapes her. Mumtaz is distraught and emotionally confides in the other dancers. Even though they console her, Mumtaz is given a reality check when she realises that many other women at the bar have equally disturbing and painful stories. She manages to pull herself together and immerses herself in her work at the bar. Eventually, Mumtaz catches the eye of a gangster called Pottya Sawant (Atul Kulkarni). He attempts to seduce her and finally resorts to paying her for sex. Mumtaz, however, cannot go through with the deed and tells Pottya about her rape. Enraged, Pottya kills her uncle and marries Mumtaz. Mumtaz leaves the bar, and Pottya rises up the criminal ranks quickly, despite his volatile temper. The couple live a happy life with their son, Abhay, and daughter, Payal. Mumtaz wishes for Abhay and Payal to be educated, and stay far away from her world of dancing girls and Pottya's world of gangsters. Pottya's attitude and temper cause him to prematurely kill a police informer, which results in him losing friends and connections in the criminal world. He becomes a target for the police. He is captured and killed in an operation to 'eliminate' various Mumbai gangsters. A grieving Mumtaz slowly runs out of money and soon realises that Pottya has left behind a large amount of debt. With no source of income, she is forced to return to work at Chandni Bar. Years pass and Mumtaz still works at Chandni Bar: now as a waitress. She manages to provide a stable environment for Abhay and Payal, who are teenagers. Mumtaz encourages her children to do well in school, so that they can move away from their surroundings of crime and gangs. Abhay is very studious and performs well in classes, but soon befriends a group of troublemakers and delinquents. Despite being warned by Mumtaz, he continues to see his friends. One day, Abhay and his group are arrested by police for extortion and held in a juvenile prison. Even though he was not part of the crime, his reputation as Pottya's son causes the police to ignore his pleas of innocence. At the prison, Abhay is raped by a pair of older inmates. Mumtaz attempts to talk to the police, to no avail. She meets with some influential people, who have police connections and can get Abhay released. They agree to help her but demand a high price, which she must bring to them in less than two days. Mumtaz has no choice and sells her body to obtain the money. She is still short. Seeing her mother's plight, Payal takes up dancing at Chandni Bar and brings the money to her troubled mother. Having secured the money, Mumtaz is able to get Abhay released. However, she notices that he is not the same happy boy he was a few days earlier. Instead, he is cold, ruthless, and is looking for revenge. Abhay makes connections in the crime world and gets a gun, which he uses to kill the boys who raped him. Mumtaz arrives on the scene and is devastated to find that her son has become a killer. It is implied that Payal is following in her mother's footsteps, and Abhay is set to be another Pottya.  Cast  Awards  Chandni Bar won four National Awards.
