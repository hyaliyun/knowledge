The son of Petrus Apianus (1495‚Äì1552), he is also known as the cartographer of Bavaria.  Life  He was born in Ingolstadt as Philipp Bienewitz (or Bennewitz). At age eleven, the son of mathematician, astronomer and cartographer Peter Apian started to study mathematics at the University of Ingolstadt. Later, aged 18, he studied in Burgundy, Paris and Bourges. Returning in 1552 he became a professor. As a Protestant he had to leave in 1569 due to Jesuits and the counter reformation. At the University of T√ºbingen he lectured for 14 years until he lost this position in 1583 for refusing to negate Calvinism. He died in T√ºbingen.  Cartography  In 1554, Duke Albrecht of Bavaria ordered Apian to create a map of Bavaria for the Bairische Chronik of Johannes Aventinus written 1526 to 1533. Over the course of seven years, Apian travelled through Oberbayern and Niederbayern, Oberpfalz, Archbishopric Salzburg and Bishopric Eichst√§tt. After two years work, a 5 x 5 meter sized map in scale 1:45.000 was finished, to be coloured by Bartel Refinger. The map, which had been in the residence's library since 1563, was destroyed by a fire in 1782. Smaller Bairische Landtafeln based on the map were ordered by Philipp Apian in 1566 from Jost Amman as 24 tables of scale 1:144.000. This second version was issued in 1568. It was considered the official map of Bavaria until the 19th century. Amman, Jost. Philipp Apian‚Äôs Drawings, Watercolors, and Woodcuts. Accessed May 11, 2015.

(1995). Radiation Effects Research Foundation, pp.1-3. Available at: http://rerf.jp/shared/introd/introRERFe.pdf [Accessed 26 Feb. 2018]. The organization is located in Hiroshima, Japan. The studies have been going on for 70 years, which makes RERF the only institution that has been conducting epidemiological studies on a population of more than 120,000 individuals for this long.A Brief Description. (2014). Radiation Effects Research Foundation, p.1. Available at: http://rerf.jp/shared/briefdescript/briefdescript_e.pdf [Accessed 26 Feb. 2018]. RERF continues to conduct research until this day because the effects of A-bomb radiation on human health have not been fully elucidated. RERF conducts research in multiple fields of science including epidemiology, clinical medicine, genetics, and immunology. Findings from RERF‚Äôs studies have been used not only for the medical care and welfare of the A-bomb survivors but also for the establishment of international radiation protection standards.  History  The preceding organization to RERF was the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission which was established in 1948 by the U.S National Academy of Sciences. It was established to determine how, over long- term, exposure to radiation affected the health of A-bomb survivors. An extensive interview survey was conducted in the 1950s, based on which records were compiled for each A-bomb survivor. These records concerned location and structure of the building the survivor may have been at the time of the bombing. Based on these records, radiation doses were calculated for most A-bomb survivors. RERF was established on April 1, 1975, as a nonprofit foundation under the jurisdiction of the Japan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Health and Welfare. On April 1, 2012, RERF transitioned to a public interest incorporated foundation upon authorization by Japan‚Äôs Prime Minister.  Research Programs  RERF studies the effects of radiation on the survivors of the atomic bombings in Japan.  Life Span Study  This study gathers samples from the general population of both sexes and all ages. It is the most informative epidemiological study in the world, because of its long duration. It provides information about cancer incidence, cancer mortality and non-cancer effects on the survivors. RERF wants to continue the studies for complete lifetimes of the participants.  Adult Health Study  This is a clinical study of a sub-cohort of the Life Span Study, conducted every two years. It is investigating age and radiation-related physiological changes.  Children of Atomic-bomb Survivors Study  The study‚Äôs goal is to determine whether genetic effects may appear in the children of the atomic bomb survivors. RERF has observed no radiation effects in the study of birth defects, chromosome abnormalities, and serum proteins. Currently, molecular studies on DNA are being conducted.  In Utero Study  This study investigates the effects of radiation on the people who were in utero at the time of the bombing (about 3,600 persons).  Radiation Biology  Radiation biology studies seek to understand the result of physical phenomena involved in radiation response. The studies are directed to DNA indications that cause breast and thyroid cancer.  Immunology  This study focuses on the changes in the immune system of people exposed to atomic-bomb radiation.  Molecular Epidemiology  This is a newly emerging field of study at RERF, which investigates the radiation effects by looking at molecular changes in DNA. It is used to understand the mechanisms and causes of disease better.  Cytogenetics  Cytogenetics helps assess radiation exposure (biological dosimetry) by evaluating the structural damage in chromosomes.  Statistics  This study assesses the risks through the application of mathematical models to rates of disease occurrence or death to identify radiation effects. The statisticians also take part in other studies done at RERF to develop better methods for analysis of data.  Atomic-bomb Dosimetry  This study provides survivors with radiation exposure dose estimates, based on the knowledge of physics and sensitive measurements that detect minute traces of the atomic bomb radiation in various materials. The information is also combined with historical interview data.  Facilities  RERF has 2 facilities: one based in Hiroshima and one in Nagasaki.

Third Aladdin edition, p. 4. She doesn't yet have any friends when she meets Jennifer on her way back to school after lunch on Halloween day. Although dressed as a Pilgrim, Jennifer claims to be a real witch. After one Saturday meeting, Jennifer takes Elizabeth as an apprentice and sets weekly meetings with assignments. \\"For the first week ... you must eat a raw egg every day. And you must bring me an egg every day. Make mine hard boiled.\\" Third Aladdin edition, p. 32. They meet only in school, the library, the park, or the woods between home and school. The apprenticeship is difficult for Elizabeth. Sometimes she gets mad at Jennifer, but \\"before I'd got Jennifer, I'd had no one.\\" Third Aladdin edition, p. 40. After several weeks, they choose a long project--to prepare an ointment that conveys the ability to fly. It will also be a test for Elizabeth's promotion from apprentice. The final ingredient will be a live toad, selected in advance. During the intervening months, the toad becomes a pet. Elizabeth stops Jennifer from adding him to the brew, which terminates the ointment and their friendship. Later she realizes that her affection for the toad was part of the test. Finally Elizabeth deduces that Jennifer's father is gardener at \\"The Estate\\" across the street, and they live on site. As Elizabeth proudly puts the clues together, Jennifer is walking to her door. Inside, Jennifer soon laughs and admits that she is not a real witch. The two girls become normal friends.

He was the father of Arthur Schnitzler. Life and work Johann Schnitzler, son of a carpenter, was a native of Nagykanizsa in Hungary (then part of the Austrian Empire). He studied medicine at the universities of Budapest and Vienna, where in 1860 he earned his medical doctorate and from 1863 to 1867 worked as an assistant to Johann von Oppolzer (1808‚Äì1871). He habilitated for percussion, auscultation and illnesses of respiratory organs in 1864. Schnitzler was among the founders of the Vienna General Policlinic in 1872 and became head of its laryngological department. In 1880 he was appointed associate professor of laryngology at the University of Vienna, and in 1884 became medical director of the policlinic. He married Luise Markbreiter (1838‚Äì1911), daughter of the renowned Viennese doctor Philipp Markbreiter, and they had four children: the doctor and playwright Arthur Schnitzler (1862‚Äì1931); Joseph Emil, who died shortly after his birth in 1864; Julius Schnitzler (1865‚Äì1939), who also was a surgeon and professor; and Gisela (1867‚Äì1953). Schnitzler was a pioneer of modern laryngology, the author of numerous works and specialist articles on diseases of the throat and larynx. His best known written work was Klinischer Atlas der Laryngologie (\\"Clinical Atlas of Laryngology\\"), which was published posthumously in 1895. In 1860, with Philipp Markbreiter (1810‚Äì1882), he founded the Wiener Medizinische Presse, a publication of which he remained as editor until 1886. His reputation as laryngologist made him a sought after physician in theatre circles; likewise his son Arthur cared for celebrated actors like Adolf von Sonnenthal and Charlotte Wolter, and numerous singers of the Viennese Court Opera. Johann Schnitzler died in Vienna aged 58 and was buried in the Zentralfriedhof cemetery. His son Arthur perpetuated parts of his life in the 1912 drama Professor Bernhardi.

History Thomas No. 1 of the Nene Valley Railway Thomas on the Watercress Line Alresford Toby the Tram Engine (replica) at Bitton Station on the Avon Valley Railway Thomas the Tank Engine (replica) at the NSW Rail Transport Museum The Nene Valley Railway at Peterborough in England was the very first railway in the world to possess a full-scale replica of Thomas. This was an industrial tank engine built by Hudswell Clarke in 1947. It has been nicknamed \\"Thomas\\" due to its bright blue livery and resemblance to the famous tank engine. In 1971, the Rev. W. Awdry made the name official. Later HiT Entertainment tried unsuccessfully to sue the Nene Valley Railway claiming that this locomotive was breaching their trademark. However, as the name was given by the Rev. Awdry, it has been allowed to remain. Since then other tank engines around the world have been dressed up as Thomas. Some heritage railways, most notably the Strasburg Rail Road and Mid Hants Railway, built working locomotives from original engines. This caused some controversy among railway preservationists who claimed it disfigured historic locomotives and trivialized the preservation movement. However, those in favor claimed the new projects would draw much-needed visitors and would help associate interest into steam and diesel engines and historical train travel with young children. Since then, railways experienced an increase of income with appearance fees for \\"Thomases\\" to railways that do not have a Thomas replica of their own. From 2008 onwards, many heritage railways in the UK have withdrawn their \\"Day Out With Thomas\\" events due to HiT's revised licensing conditions, which includes the requirement for enhanced criminal records (CRB) checks on all the railway's staff and volunteers.R. Jones: Major lines pull out of Thomas. Heritage Railway magazine, Issue 106, Dec. 2007, page 26 However, the \\"Day Out With Thomas\\" events have thrived in the United States and Canada. Events by country=Australia In Australia, several railways have hosted Day Out With Thomas events: in New South Wales the Zig Zag Railway (Closed), Lithgow, and the NSW Rail Transport Museum, Thirlmere; in Queensland, the Workshop Rail Museum; and in Victoria the Puffing Billy Railway and the Bellarine Railway. Netherlands In the Netherlands annually, these events are held at Het Spoorwegmuseum in Utrecht. New Zealand In New Zealand, Mainline Steam's Bagnall tank locomotive has appeared as Thomas on a number of different locations, including at the Britomart Transport Centre in Auckland and has also appeared at the extremely popular biannual \\"Day out with Thomas the Tank Engine\\" weekends at the Glenbrook Vintage Railway, south of Auckland. United Kingdom Many heritage railways up and down the UK have hosted Day Out With Thomas events over the years; some events feature just Thomas himself, whilst others, such as the Watercress Line, Llangollen Railway, East Anglian Railway Museum, Kirklees Light Railway, Bo'ness and Kinneil Railway and the Caledonian Railway (Brechin) also feature some of Thomas' friends such as Percy, Diesel, Mavis and Daisy. As of 2020, 14 Heritage Railways in the UK host Day Out With Thomas events. As a result of the licensing costs and other demands imposed by Mattel/HiT, some railways have replaced their Thomas events with similar ones which also feature engines with faces.

All were built or rebuilt by the Strasburg Rail Road, with the steam engine being rebuilt from Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal No. 15. The dummy engines usually consist of a steam or diesel locomotive operated as a pusher, with an unpowered Thomas engine at the opposite end. Thomas's whistle is powered by the train's compressed air system.Pusher/dummy seen 4 August 2008 at Roaring Camp and Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad, operated on standard gauge tracks to Santa Cruz by Santa Cruz Big Trees and Pacific Ry. Two are narrow gauge, while the other five are standard gauge. While in transit between events, Thomas' face is covered. The standard gauge replicas (and the one narrow gauge replica) are transported from location to location via flatbed truck. Thomas appears in full dress at Day Out With Thomas events hosted by railroads in arrangement with HiT Entertainment. Many of the larger railroad museums and tourist railroads across the United States host Day out with Thomas events periodically. The same trains are also used for the three Canadian events (in BC, Alberta and Ontario). The National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin was the first railroad museum in the United States to host a \\"Day Out With Thomas\\" event, unveiling a small Thomas replica in December 1996. In 2014, all of the Thomas locomotives had their old faces replaced with an animatronic CGI style face. In September 2014, a full-scale replica of Percy was built. This Percy is also a dummy engine. In 2019, Mavis the diesel engine (introduced in the book Tramway Engines) was introduced at the Strasburg Rail Road's event \\"Thomas, Mavis, and the Strasburg Spooktacular\\". Strasburg's SW8 #8618 switcher was redressed as Mavis for the event. In 2020 the Strasburg Railroad introduced Rusty. It is a repainted Plymouth Gas Locomotive in a similar fashion to how Mavis was created. So far Rusty has not run any trains but is instead on display for photo opportunities.

In 2015, the JNR Class C56 (No. 44) was decorated as James and operated its own trains alongside Thomas. Also for 2015, a JNR Steam Locomotive that no longer operated on the railway was turned into a Percy replica and sits alongside the Class 9600 that is decorated as Hiro. In 2016, a red bus, decorated into Bertie, was introduced alongside the Troublesome Trucks, which are pulled by the Rusty replica. In 2018, a replica of Winston was introduced and guests can ride and operate him by pedalling. A replica of Flynn was introduced in 2019. Bulgy is announced to appear in the events in 2020.

It is famous as one of the most impressive pieces of Baroque architecture in northern W√ºrttemberg and is now used by the Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart as a retreat and training centre. History The Cistercian monastery was founded in 1153 in Neusass by Wolfram von Bebenburg and was settled by monks from Maulbronn Abbey. The original site proved unsuitable and the new community moved to the present location in Sch√∂ntal on the Jagst between 1157 and 1163. The land for the new site was provided by the von Berlichingen family in exchange for rights of burial in the monastery. The monastery was under the protection of the Bishops of W√ºrzburg. thumb Despite a promising beginning, the abbey found itself in financial difficulties by the early 13th century. Maulbronn Abbey was also in financial trouble and gave Sch√∂ntal to Kaisheim Abbey, which settled its debts in 1283. After this, Sch√∂ntal made a recovery, and in 1418 at the Council of Constance was granted the status of Imperial abbey, although it only retained this until 1495. It was plundered several times and suffered severe damage during the German Peasants' War in 1525. Although it survived the Reformation the buildings became uninhabitable and an emergency block had to be constructed in 1617‚Äì18, now known as the Alte Abtei (\\"the old abbey\\"). The monastery was besieged during the Thirty Years' War and the monks were eventually forced to flee in 1631, abandoning what remained of the buildings to looting and plunder. In 1648 the premises were several times used as soldiers' billets. The abbey finally experienced a revival under abbot Benedikt Knittel (in office from 1683 to 1732). Under his leadership was built the Baroque abbey church, designed by Leonhard Dientzenhofer, in which G√∂tz von Berlichingen is buried. Abbot Benedikt was also responsible for the palatial claustral buildings with the grand staircase by Balthasar Neumann. Some forty monks lived in the community, besides about thirty conversi or lay brothers, who lived outside the monastery while following a monastic way of life. The abbey was secularised in 1802, when it was taken over by the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. The furnishings and contents were removed to Stuttgart, and the buildings used initially for the accommodation of local government administration. From 1810 to 1975, Sch√∂ntal Abbey was one of the buildings used for the Evangelical Theological Seminary (Evangelisch-theologisches Seminar or Seminar Maulbronn), now the Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren. Today the buildings are used by the Diocese of Rottenburg- Stuttgart as a centre for conferences, retreats and training, as well as the town hall of the community of Sch√∂ntal. Most of the Baroque buildings and the monastery gardens have survived.

Nygard and under the pen name Ada M. Oredigger (August 25, 1906 ‚Äì April 26, 1984), was an American Communist politician who became the first Communist mayor in the United States when he was elected President of the Village Council of Crosby, Minnesota in 1932. Political life The son of Swedish-speaking immigrants from Finland, Nygard ran for mayor in 1930 and 1931 but lost by 250 and 48 votes, respectively. In the November 8, 1932 general election, he ran unsuccessfully for state railroad and warehouse commissioner, polling 9,458 votes statewide. In the December 6, 1932 village election, he won the mayoralty on the Workers Ticket with 529 votes, against 359 votes for incumbent F. H. Kraus and 301 votes for Ernest B. Erickson; he was inaugurated on January 3, 1933. Saying that he was \\"under the strict discipline of the Communist party\\", Nygard incorporated the Workers Advisory Committee into the municipal government by allowing it to pass bills before they went before the Village Council. On a controversial trip to New York City in 1933, he was accused of exaggerating his influence in front of Communist audiences and boasted of his challenges to the authority of Crosby police and businessmen. One of his other acts in office was to declare May Day an official holiday. Nygard was defeated for reelection in December 1933 and made his last run in 1934. Personal life Nygard married Helen Koski in 1936 and they raised their family in Becker County. Though he distanced himself from the Communist Party, he reportedly remained committed to Marxism for the rest of his life. Nygard died in 1984.

The site, an area of 3 ha on the northern bank of the Yishui River, contains artifacts of a culture contemporaneous with the Cishan and Xinglongwa cultures of about 8000-7000 BP, two known Neolithic cultures east of the Taihang Mountains, and thus fills an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures. The total excavated area is more than 1,200 square meters and the collection of neolithic findings at the site has been conducted in two phases. This archaeological site was voted Number One in the Top Ten most outstanding archaeological findings in 2004 by Chinese archaeologists in their annual poll. Findings The most significant discovery in the first phase of the site's excavation is the large number of pottery masks in the shape of human and animal faces, the oldest extant carvings to date. A dozen carved clay masks, in cat, monkey and pig as well as human likenesses, have been unearthed at Beifudi. One mask of a human face has a mouth and nose in carved relief and the eyes are pierced out. The first engraved clay artifacts ever found in ruins of this age, the masks add several millennia to China's history of carving. These artifacts, along with raised platforms, or altars, may provide information on various early religious practices. Although the beliefs of these Neolithic people are not known, the early Chinese almost certainly performed ritual ceremonial sacrifices and burned burials (fanyi) on the raised platforms, as both human and animal burials have been found. The masks are believed to be part of the ritual performances accompanying sacrifices and burials. Excavations in the second phase, dating to 6500-7000 BP include pottery and stone tools, ceramic pots (including the round-bottom fu vessel, the vessel seat, and the bo bowl) and small-mouth-double-handled pots. Archaeologists have unearthed the ruins of ten well-preserved cave shelters concentrated in one location, arranged systematically with cooking and living areas located in the center of the dwellings. Artifacts excavated from dwellings include stone blocks, building materials, and broken pottery. Ash pits, and sacrificial sites have been excavated as well as pieces of jade and very well preserved carved ceramic masks. Conclusions Drawing on archaeology, geology and anthropology, modern scholars do not see the origins of the Chinese civilization or Chinese history as one story but rather the history of the interactions of many different cultures and many different ethnic groups that influenced each other's development. As the prehistoric Beifudi site is in northern China where the climate is drier than in the south, it is likely that this culture cultivated millet although no direct evidence of cultivation has been found. The finding of stone tools for food processing does not reliably prove that the culture had developed agriculture as such tools were used before the cultivation of crops. The importance of the prehistoric Beifudi site lies in its potential to provide archaeological information on the beliefs and ceremonial practices of this ancient culture through the ancient carved artifacts found there, as well as further understanding of the beginnings of Chinese architecture.

This process in some cases may be implemented through the use of equipment systems that are also used for roll stabilisation while underway. Vessels at anchor, at moorings, adrift, or keeping station are subjected to roll and pitch generating forces similar to those that affect vessels underway. Different strategies for mitigating the effects of these forces have been adopted. A variable system that uses \\"active fins\\" designed specifically for roll attenuation of a vessel while underway achieves lifting force through the flow of water over the fin's surface. By increasing the angle of attack of the fin to the water flow to some maximum working angle, a maximum lift force can be achieved for stabilising the hull. When these same systems are used for roll stabilisation of stationary vessels, the lift force available from water flow over the fin while underway is not available. For a stationary vessel, the ability to generate a lifting force (i.e. roll-resisting force) is limited to that achieved by any powered fin movements, and by the water volume displaced while stroking the fins in one direction at a precise point in time. Active fin systems can provide incremental add-on stability for vessels at rest, but these systems will usually have larger actuators and fins, and will likely have special power source requirements in comparison to systems designed for stability underway. Various commercial suppliers produce a range of stabilization systems that can be used at rest, on-anchor, or at zero-speed.

The breed was developed by Klim Sulimov for Aeroflot airline. The breed has primarily been used for airport security as sniffer dogs. Breed development Their breeding program dates back to 1975, but was not applied to bomb detection until 2002. At the start of the breeding process, male jackal pups had to be fostered on a Lapponian Herder bitch to imprint the jackals on dogs. Female jackals accepted male dogs more easily. The half-breed jackal-dogs were hard to train and were bred back to Huskies to produce quarter-bred hybrids (quadroons). To improve trainability, other dogs were bred into the line: a reindeer herding hound, a fox terrier, and a Spitz. These hybrids were small, agile, and trainable and had excellent noses. The jackal-dog hybrids were bred together for seven generations to establish the breed. The result was an easily trainable dog with a superior sense of smell, called Sulimov dogs after their creator. As described by Sulimov: > My dogs combine the qualities of Arctic reindeer herding dogs, which can > work in temperatures as low as ‚àí70¬∞C, and jackals which enjoy the heat up to > +40¬∞C. They're perfect for our country.\\" Twenty-five Sulimov dogs are used by Aeroflot at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, for functions which include bomb-sniffing. They may one day be registered as a breed of working dog, but at present only about 40 Sulimov dogs exist, and all are the property of Aeroflot. They are trained from puppyhood to recognize 12 components of explosives. Unlike more common sniffing dogs, they take the initiative in searching.

It is the grandest plantation house ever built in Marengo County and is one of the most significant remaining examples of Greek Revival architecture in Alabama.Gamble, Robert Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930, page 76. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1990. . The house was built with the profits of forced labor, and much of the actual construction was performed by enslaved people. It was completed on the eve of the American Civil War after a construction period of almost 20 years. The house and grounds are currently operated by the Alabama Historical Commission as a historic house museum. History Gaineswood was designed and built by General Nathan Bryan Whitfield, beginning in 1843 as a dog-trot cabin-an open-hall log dwelling. Whitfield was a cotton planter who had moved from North Carolina to Marengo County, Alabama in 1834. In 1842, Whitfield bought the property from George Strother Gaines, younger brother of Edmund P. Gaines. By 1860, Whitfield owned as many as 7,200 acres; he enslaved 235 people to work his land, which produced nearly 600 bales of cotton that year, though not all at Gaineswood. The grounds had been the site of a notable historic event while owned by George Gaines. When Gaines was serving as the U.S. Indian Agent, he is said to have met with the famous chief Pushmataha, of the Choctaw Nation, under an old post oak tree on what would become the Gaineswood estate. They were negotiating the terms of the treaty that would lead to the Choctaw removal to Indian Territory. The tree became known as the Pushmataha Oak.Hammond, Ralph Ante-bellum Mansions of Alabama, pages 114-120. New York: Architectural Book Publishers, 1951. In 1843, Whitfield gave his forced-labor farm the name of Marlmont; in 1856, he renamed it Gaineswood in honor of Gaines.Marengo County Heritage Book Committee: The heritage of Marengo County, Alabama, page 18. Clanton, Alabama: Heritage Publishing Consultants, 2000. The Whitfield family tradition maintained that Gaines' original log house was the nucleus around which Whitfield had the mansion built, and that it was located at the present site of the south entrance hall and office.\\" Gen. Whitfield sold the house to his son, Dr. Bryan Watkins Whitfield, in 1861. The second generation of Whitfields maintained Gaineswood as a residence. Mary Foscue Whitfield inherited the nearby Foscue‚ÄìWhitfield House in 1861 upon her father's death and used that as a residence as well. In 1923 the Whitfield family sold Gaineswood. After years of use as a private residence, Gaineswood was purchased in 1966 by the state of Alabama from Dr. J.D. McLeod, for preservation as a house museum. Architecture Gaineswood was completed in its current Greek Revival form in 1861. It is considered to be \\"Alabama's finest neoclassical house\\" and one of America's most unusual neoclassical mansions. Gaineswood is one of the few Greek Revival homes in the United States that uses all three of the ancient Greek architectural orders: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Built when tastes were shifting to the Italianate style, it features a partially asymmetrical layout. Whitfield is known to have designed most of the house from pattern books by James Stuart, Minard Lafever, Nicholas Revett and others. Much of the work on the house was executed by highly skilled artisans who, being enslaved, were forced to do it without pay. Exterior The front elevation, showing the porte-coch√®re of the main entrance, side porticoes, the flanking parterre walls, as seen from the front all√©e. The exterior has a decorative stucco over brick treatment, intended to simulate ashlar blocks. The exterior features the use of eighteen fluted Doric columns and 14 plain square pillars to support the three porches, the main portico, and the porte-coch√®re. The assorted porches surround most of three sides of the structure. Parterre gardens off of the main north portico and south porch are surrounded by low masonry and wood balustrades and feature period-appropriate plantings and marble statuary. A rooftop observation ring with a vasiform balustrade surmounts the house and was used for observing the estate. The estate has three surviving outbuildings: a cook's house, a garden pavilion with eight fluted Corinthian columns, and a monumental gatehouse that date to the antebellum period. The tripartite entrance gate features massive pillars crowned by large metal finials and elaborate cast iron gates. The gatehouse and gates had to moved closer to the house as the city streets were widened in the 20th century. No quarters for the enslaved residents were preserved, although some may have existed into the early 20th century for use as residences for workers on the plantation. Interior The lantern dome, used to admit daylight into the interior, in the library. A matching dome is in the dining room across the hall. The elaborate plasterwork in the ballroom. The interior features decorative plasterwork throughout the main floor. The library and the dining room both feature elaborate domed ceilings with central skylights. The hallway features fluted Ionic columns in the main entrance hall with reception rooms to either side, one for each sex. The master's bedroom also features two fluted Ionic columns supporting a cornice that visually divides the room into bedroom and sitting room. The mistress' bedroom features a large floor-to-ceiling semicircular bay with curved windows and is fronted by two fluted Corinthian columns. Doors to either side of the bay provide access to the semicircular porch outside. The ballroom features four fluted Corinthian columns and 24 fluted Corinthian pilasters, vis-√†-vis mirrors, an elaborate plaster cornice, and a coffered ceiling. The second floor is much simpler in decor and contains a boudoir, a nursery, and four large bedrooms. Whitfield canal Whitfield directed the digging of a drainage canal 1845 and 1863 to prevent water from overflowing and flooding the plantation. His slaves dug it by hand. The rainfall on a large section of the Gaineswood estate originally had to follow a course to reach the Tombigbee River. About one mile (1.6 km) long, the canal was dug to a depth of more than deep through the underlying chalk in some areas; it quickly diverts the surface water into the river at Demopolis. Present Gaineswood is on the National Register of Historic Places and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973. The estate is owned by the state of Alabama and is administered by the Alabama Historical Commission. Severe moisture damage to the ceiling and dome in the dining room was corrected under a Save America's Treasures grant. The Whitfield family has donated or sold much of the original family furniture and some statuary to the Historical Commission to be used in the house. The Burning of the Eliza Battle, painted by Nathan B. Whitfield, still hangs at Gaineswood. He was a witness to the steamboat disaster in 1858.

It was directed by W.S. Van Dyke and based on the novel by James Hilton. It features Robert Montgomery, Ingrid Bergman, and George Sanders.. Plot The film opens with the following quote: \\"Heaven hath no rage like love to hatred turned.\\" which is incorrectly attributed to Milton (quote is from William Congreve's The Mourning Bride). At a mental institution in Paris, Doctor Rameau (Oscar Homolka) discusses with the British consul the case of a man who identifies himself as Ward Andrews. The doctor believes Andrews to be English and wants the consul's assistance in verifying this. Outwardly the man may seem sane, but underneath he suffers from paranoia, suicidal tendencies and is capable of murder. The doctor takes the consul to meet Andrews, but they discover he has escaped. George Sanders and Ingrid Bergman Phillip Monrell (Robert Montgomery) and his former college roommate Ward Andrews (George Sanders) run into each other in London and Monrell invites his old friend back to his family home. When they arrive, they meet Stella Bergen (Ingrid Bergman), the secretary of Phillip's mother (Lucile Watson). Both men are strongly attracted to her. She is friendly with the more responsible, hardworking Ward but prefers and marries the idle Phillip instead. Ward leaves for a job in Scotland. Phillip is put in charge of the family steel mill but is not suited to the position. He begins to exhibit signs of mental illness, in particular, abnormal suspicion that his wife and Ward are in love. Despite this jealousy, he invites Ward for a visit and hires him to be the chief engineer at the mill. Eventually, Phillip's paranoia drives him to try to kill his perceived rival at work. Ward confronts him, admits his love for Stella, quits the steel mill, and returns to London. After a frightening moment with her husband, Stella leaves him and goes to Ward. Phillip promises to grant her a divorce if Ward will return to talk with him in person. Having prepared a plan designed to frame Ward, Phillip provokes a loud argument with him which he knows is being overheard by a servant. Afterwards, Phillip kills himself, after ensuring that Ward will be arrested for murder. Ward is convicted and sentenced to be executed. The day before the execution, Stella is visited by Dr. Rameau. He has seen a photo of Phillip in a newspaper and informs her that her husband was a patient who masqueraded as Ward Andrews and escaped from the institution. He is convinced that Phillip committed suicide and that he would have left some message bragging about it. Phillip's mother reveals that her son kept diaries; then, Clark (Aubrey Mather), the butler, remembers that he mailed a package to Paris the night Ward visited and Phillip died. Stella and Rameau take a flight to France and find the book, which exonerates Ward.

Prior to becoming a state park the land of Holts Landing State Park was the Holt family farm. The Holts sold the land to the state of Delaware in 1957 and Holts Landing State Park was opened to the public in 1965. The park is on the southern shore of Indian River Bay. Holts Landing State Park is open for year-round recreation and features the only pier on the east coast of Delaware that has been purpose-built for crabbing, the recreational harvesting of blue crabs. History Holts Landing State Park, on Indian River Bay, has long been a center of crabbing, fishing, hunting, and farming dating back to the Pre-Columbian history of what is now southeastern Delaware. Native peoples took advantage of the abundant seafood that was harvested in the shallow waters of the inland bays. They also hunted wildlife in the surrounding marshes and forests. The arrival of colonists from Europe signalled the end of the way of life that the Native Americans had known. They were driven out by war and disease and were displaced by people of European ancestry who began farming the land on the southern coast of Indian River Bay. These colonists continued the practice of harvesting seafood from the bay and expanded their farming operations slowly over the years. The Holt family operated a small family farm and boat landing for many years before selling their property to the state in 1957. Holts Landing State Park was opened for public use in 1965. By 2014, Holts Landing State Park had begun to show signs of neglect. An estimated 6,000 people visited the park that year and, thanks to a Delaware Division of Parks and Recreation funding formula that allocated funding for maintenance and improvements based on annual visitor totals, the park had received little funding over the previous 10 to 12 years due to its limited number of annual visitors. A negative cycle had begun in which fewer and fewer visitors came to the park as its facilities deteriorated, resulting in fewer and fewer funds with which to correct deficiencies there. To address the situation, local residents formed a volunteer organization, the Friends of Holts Landing State Park, in October 2014 to sponsor clean-up and maintenance activities at the park and to partner with Delaware Parks and Recreation officials in maintaining the park's grounds and facilities and constructing improvements at the park. Between January and May 2015, the Friends of Holts Landing State Park cleaned up the park's trails, installed new trail signs and markers, worked with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to reconfigure trails to avoid anticipated problems with a rise in sea level expected over the next 20 years, and installed new benches and picnic tables. In the summer of 2015, the park celebrated its 50th anniversary and its recent improvements with its first summer music concert series, held as part of a summer series of monthly \\"Family Fun Nights\\" that began that year.\\"Holts Landing to celebrate anniversary facelift with Family Fun Nights,\\" Coastal Point, June 18, 2015. In October 2015, the park's old single-lane boat ramp closed. It was removed and replaced with an updated, two-lane concrete ramp leading to a newly dredged channel. The new ramp opened in April 2016.Guyette, Leann, \\"Holts Landing State Park boat ramp to close for expansion,\\" October 9, 2015, 1:24 p.m. EDT.Anonymous, \\"New State-Of-The-Art Boat Ramp At Holts Landing State Park,\\" delaware-surf-fishing.com, April 22, 2016. Recreation Shoreline of Indian River Bay at Holts Landing State Park Holts Landing State Park has 2,000 feet (610 meters) of shoreline along the south coast of the Indian River Bay. The park's 220-foot (67-meter) crabbing pier on the bay was constructed in 2001 to provide visitors with easy access to the abundant blue crabs of the park; crabbers lower a baited basket into the waters of the bay and wait for the crabs to take the bait before pulling them out of the water. The pier also is open for fishing; the common game fish in the bay are sea trout, flounder, bluefish, and perch. Visitors may also wade into the shallow waters of the bay to harvest clams. The park's two-lane concrete boat ramp provides the only public boat and kayak access on the south shore of the Indian River Bay between Millsboro to the west and the Indian River Inlet to the east; the launching facilities lead to a channel 60 feet (18.3 meters) wide by 4 feet (1.2 meters) deep, and the ramp can accommodate boats up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) in length. The ramp has its own parking area and is popular with fishermen and recreational boaters. The park encompasses 204 acres (82.5 hectares) of upland forest, within which are several hidden fresh water ponds which have evolved naturally from borrow pits left behind by the Delaware Department of Transportation after road construction.destateparks.com Holts Landing State Park, Millville, Delaware The park has three 20-acre (8-hectare) wilderness campsites, all located within the forest, and two main trails ‚Äì the Sea Hawk Trail and the Seahorse Trail ‚Äì and three lesser trails with a combined length of 3.1 miles (5 km) and open for easy hiking, biking, and equestrian use:destateparks.com Trails: Holts Landingdestateparks.com Horse Trails in Delaware State Parks * The Sea Hawk Trail, accessible from the park's main parking area and from the Seahorse Trail, is laid out as a 1.3-mile (2.1-km) three-quarter loop that affords bird and wildlife viewing opportunities in the park's various coastal bay environments, passing through mixed hardwood and conifer forest, alongside a number of the fresh water ponds, and through a grassy meadow that is home to many types of birds, including ospreys, before terminating near the Indian River Bay shoreline. * The Seahorse Trail is a 1.8-mile (2.9-km) loop accessible from the Sea Hawk Trail or via the Connector Trail. Built on packed earth, the Seahorse Trail provides access to the western portion of the park, passing the campsites and running along the forest's edge, along the edge of the large meadow, and through dense forest areas that include some of the fresh water ponds. * The Connector Trail is a short trail along the southern boundary of the park that leads from Holts Landing Road to the Seahorse Trail, following the edge of the forest. * An unnamed trail runs through the forest south of the campsites. It allows visitors to shorten the Seahorse Trail loop by skipping the southern portion of the Seahorse Trail. * A remnant of a portion of the Sea Hawk Trail that once ran along the Indian River Bay shoreline still exists, although it no longer connects to the Sea Hawk Trail. This remnant runs for about 200 feet (61 meters) from a grassy area between the main parking area and the crabbing pier eastward to the Indian River Bay shoreline. Holts Landing State Park's picnic facilities include picnic tables located in shady sections of the park. There are nearby charcoal grills and a large lawn for the spreading of picnic blankets. A pavilion with a large grill and a seating capacity of 80 people is available to rent for events such as family reunions, church gatherings, and company picnics. Holts Landing State Park also features a playground and horseshoes pits. Public toilet facilities are located between the main parking area and the crabbing pier. The Assawoman Canal, which connects Indian River Bay to the north with Little Assawoman Bay to the south, is part of Holts Landing State Park. Immigrant laborers initially dug the canal by hand in the 1890s. Last dredged in the 1950s, the canal is no longer deep enough to handle the boat traffic that once passed through it when it was part of the Intracoastal Waterway. Although a privately owned marina lies within the park at the northern end of the canal, most of the rest of the canal is too shallow and narrow for recreational motorboats to navigate safely. The canal has become a haven for recreational kayakers. The recreational facilities at Holts Landing State Park are open daily from 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time until sunset except for the boat ramp, which is open 24 hours a day. In 2015, an annual summer music concert series began at Holts Landing State Park as part of a series of monthly summer \\"Family Fun Nights\\" at the park, sponsored during their first year by the Delaware Division of Parks and Recreation in honor of the park's 50th anniversary. In 2016, the Friends of Holts Landing State Park volunteer group took over sponsorship of the Family Fun Nights and their associated concert series.Walter, Laura, \\"Holts Landing summer concerts begin June 28,\\" Coastal Point, June 24, 2016, p. A22. Wildlife Holts Landing State Park is home to a wide variety of wildlife. Commonly seen wading birds include herons, egrets and ibises. Hawks and ospreys are the most often seen birds of prey at the park. The forests are populated with songbirds, white- tailed deer, raccoons, foxes, muskrats, and opossums. The small ponds that evolved when the abandoned road construction pits filled with fresh water have created habitats for local animals and plants. The Assawoman Canal also provides a habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. Possible development along the canal has drawn the attention of the Sierra Club.

The lighthouse was designed by Paul J. Pelz, who also designed Point Adams's sister stations, Point Fermin Light in San Pedro, California, East Brother Island Light in Richmond, California, Mare Island Light, in Carquinez Strait, California (demolished in the 1930s), Point Hueneme Light in California (replaced in 1940), and Hereford Inlet Light in North Wildwood, New Jersey, all in essentially the same style. It operated from February 15, 1875 until 1899, when it became obsolete by the extension of the south jetty and the establishment of the Lightship Columbia in 1892. The lighthouse was considered a fire hazard and demolished in 1912. It was located about a mile south of Point Adams‚Äînamed by Captain Robert Gray in 1792 ‚Äînear what is now Battery Russell in Fort Stevens State Park. The combination of the Point Adams Light with the Cape Disappointment Lighthouse on the north side of the river effectively framed the entrance to the Columbia. The keeper's quarters and light were a combined structure, similar to the Yaquina Bay Light, in Newport, and used the same structure, materials, and optics as Point Fermin Light south of Los Angeles, California. The light was changed from alternating red and white to fixed red on January 21, 1881 to reduce confusion with the nearby just-completed Tillamook Rock Light. The change caused HMS Fern Glen to run aground, evidently unaware of the change. At the same time, the fog signal was removed: it had long been criticized by mariners as being inaudible over waves crashing on shore. The keeper considered the biggest maintenance problem to be the prevention of sand accumulation at the base of the lighthouse. Fences were unsuccessfully attempted at one point. After decommissioning, the light was replaced by the Desdemona Sands Light in December 1901. It was finally burned down by the Lighthouse Service in 1912.

He wrestled primarily for independent promotions in the Southeastern United States. He was most active throughout the 1980s and 1990s in the Tennessee- based United States Wrestling Association (USWA) and Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), and had two short stints with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) under the ring names of T.L. Hopper and Uncle Cletus. Professional wrestling career=AWA and NWA runs (1980‚Äì1988) Trained by Steve Keirn and Ron Wright, Anthony worked as a jobber in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling in 1981 and 1982. He won his first major title teaming with Len Denton as \\"The Grapplers\\" in the AWA. They defeated The Fabulous Ones (Keirn and Stan Lane) to win the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship on August 8, 1983. After losing the title, The Grapplers continued to team elsewhere, winning the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship twice in 1984. After The Grapplers disbanded, Anthony continued to wrestle on the independent circuit, splitting his time between singles competition and tag team action. He teamed with Jerry Stubbs in Southeast Championship Wrestling to win the NWA Southeast Tag Team Championship four times before the promotion closed. After it became the Continental Wrestling Federation, Anthony and Stubbs won the tag team title twice more. As a singles wrestler, Anthony won the NWA Alabama Heavyweight Championship on four occasions. He beat Wendell Cooley to begin both of his first two reigns, Bob Armstrong to begin his third and Tom Prichard for his fourth. His last reign ended when the title was retired in 1988. United States Wrestling Association (1989‚Äì1991) In 1989, Anthony defeated Dustin Rhodes in a United States Wrestling Association (USWA) tournament final to become the first USWA Southern Heavyweight champion. The following year, he won the USWA Tag Team Championship on three occasions, once with Tom Burton and twice with Doug Gilbert. Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1992‚Äì1995) Anthony competed primarily as a singles wrestler in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). He was quickly pushed as a main event wrestler, and won the SMW Heavyweight Championship from Brian Lee on August 8, 1992. After dropping the title to Tracy Smothers the following April, Anthony (under his masked Mighty Yankee gimmick) won the SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship in June 1993. While holding this title, he defeated Brian Lee to regain the Heavyweight Championship. He was involved in an angle in which he was kayfabe forced to vacate the Television Championship on August 16, after a series of defenses. The rules stipulated that any wrestler who successfully defended the title five times would be awarded $5000, but be forced to vacate it. Anthony regained the title by beating Robert Gibson on September 13. He won his final SMW Heavyweight Championship on July 5, 1994, by defeating Jake Roberts. He held the title for over six months before losing it to Jerry Lawler on January 28, 1995. Anthony's performance in 1994 earned him his highest ever ranking (No. 25) in the annual PWI 500. Anthony won his final title in SMW on July 6, 1995, teaming with Tracy Smothers (as The Thugs) to defeat The Dynamic Duo (Al Snow and Unabomb) for the SMW Tag Team Championship. World Wrestling Federation (1996‚Äì1997) In 1996, Anthony joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He was given the gimmick of T.L. Hopper, a wrestling plumber. After a series of vignettes showing Hopper at work, he debuted wearing low hanging jeans and a stained undershirt. He would carry his plunger (named \\"Betsy\\") to the ring with him, and celebrate his victories by sticking it in his opponent's face. His biggest win was a \\"home improvement\\" match, where he defeated Duke \\"The Dumpster\\" Droese. Although he did not wrestle on any WWF pay-per-views, he made an appearance during the \\"Bikini Beach Blast- Off\\" segment, on the Free For All show immediately preceding SummerSlam 1996. Based on his experience as a plumber, Hopper was chosen to investigate a brown object resembling feces on the bottom of the swimming pool. The segment parodied a scene in the movie Caddyshack. After taking a brief hiatus, he returned to the WWF in September 1997 as Uncle Cletus, coming from the audience to help the heel tag team of The Godwinns (Henry and Phineas Godwinn) in a match against The Headbangers. He hit Mosh in the head with a horseshoe, allowing Phineas to make the pin. He was then billed as the uncle of the Godwinns, and became the team's manager. At Badd Blood 1997, The Godwinns won the WWF Tag Team Championship, with Cletus in their corner. On October 13, Cletus interfered in another match, but his interference backfired and allowed the Legion of Doom to win the title. Following this, the Godwinns attacked Cletus, who was never seen in the WWF again. Independent circuit (1997‚Äìpresent) After leaving the WWF, Anthony returned to his home state of Tennessee (where he had maintained considerable fame and popularity) and wrestled for various independents around East Tennessee until retiring from active competition in 2006. In recent years, he played a prominent role in Knoxville's Tennessee Xtreme Wrestling, as its face commissioner.

Though some of his early work is Late Baroque in manner, his name is particularly associated with blocky neoclassical forms veneered with richly detailed marquetry vignettes, often within complicated borders. His workshop's output is somewhat repetitive, making attributions to Maggiolini a temptation. His clientele reached to AustriaThe desk sold from the collection of the earl of Bute, Christie's 3 July 1996, lot 10, made for an Austrian patron about 1784. and Poland.A panel of marquetry designed by Giuseppe Levati made in 1783 for Stanislas II Poniatowski, king of Poland (illustrated in Alvar Gonz√°lez- Palacios, Il gusto dei principi: arte di corte del xvii e xviii secolo Milan 1993). Born in Parabiago, near Milan, he was the son of Gilardo Maggiolini, a forester in the service of the Cistercian monastery of Sant'Ambrogio della Vittoria, and after apprenticeship in a woodworking shop he opened his own bottega in the town's central piazza, which today bears his name. In 1757 he married Antonia Vignati, from Villastanza; they had a single son, Francesco, born the following year. The painter Giuseppe Levati consigned to Maggiolini work for marchese Pompeo Litta at Villa Litta, Lainate, near Milan, to Levati's designs, with unexpectedly fine results. Maggiolini was invited to collaborate on designs for the wedding of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, the Habsburg governor of Lombardy, with Maria Beatrice d'Este, initiating Maggiolini's work for the Habsburgs, rulers of Lombardy, for which he opened a second workshop, in Milan. In 1771 Maggiolini produced the marquetry flooring in the Palazzo di Corte in Milan, being rebuilt under the direction of Giuseppe Piermarini, which put Maggiolini in contact with a wider circle of artists and designers: the painter Andrea Appiani and the architect Giocondo Albertolli. In 1777 he produced marquetry floors and furniture for the royal villa near Monza. Named intarsiatore to the Habsburg granducal court, by 1780 Maggiolini in his turn was able to commission from Piermarini a new fa√ßade for the Church of Saints Gervasio and Protasio in his natal Parabiago, and from Albertolli its internal redecoration. Maggiolini's characteristic furniture consists of commodes and chests, coffers and writing-desks and tables, inlaid with a wide varietyEighty different woods is the conventionally quoted number. of European woods and exotic woods imported from abroad, used in their natural colors or tinted green, like blue or rose. Cartoons for execution in marquetry were provided by artists such as Levati and Appiani, and panels of pictorial marquetry were produced purely for displays as tours de force. With the introduction of the more severe Empire style, featuring sober mahogany relieved by gilt-bronze mounts, and the flight of his patron the Archduke in 1796, Maggiolini was forced to retrench. In 1806, however, on extremely short notice, he was commissioned to produce a writing table in connection with Napoleon's coronation in Milan; this brought a resurgence of commissions, this time from Prince Eug√®ne de Beauharnais and other Bonapartes, but in 1809 Maggiolini withdrew into retirement, as antipathy to the Napoleonic system and all connected with it increased in Milan. Drawings from the workshop, which was continued by his son Carlo Francesco in partnership with Cherubino Mezzanzanica (died 1866), are in the Fondo Maggioliniano in the Antique Furniture & Wooden Sculpture Museum of Sforza Castle, Milan.

Nicknamed the Dudley Bug or Dudley Locust by 18th-century quarrymen it became a symbol of the town and featured on the Dudley County Borough Council coat-of-arms. Calymene blumenbachii is commonly found in Silurian rocks (422.5‚Äì427.5 million years ago) and is thought to have lived in the shallow waters of the Silurian, in low-energy reefs. This particular species of Calymene (a fairly common genus in the Ordovician-Silurian) is unique to the Wenlock series in England, and comes from the Wenlock Limestone Formation in Much Wenlock and the Wren's Nest in Dudley. These sites seem to yield trilobites more readily than any other areas on the Wenlock Edge, and the rock here is dark grey as opposed to yellowish or whitish as it appears on other parts of the Edge, just a few miles away, in Church Stretton and elsewhere. This suggests local changes in the environment in which the rock was deposited.

Development The prototype, called L-2, was built in 1926-27. It has a steel tube fuselage, and rectangular wooden wing. The tail was two fins, one above and one below the fuselage. The entire plane was fabric covered, except the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9A Jupiter engine, which was left uncowled. The prototype was flown to Copenhagen, and demonstrated there to several countries. Six prototype L-3s were constructed. They had a larger Jupiter, steel spars instead of wood, and stronger struts, allowing for shipboard catapult launching. After successfully testing the L-3, the French navy ordered 14 production GL-810 HY aircraft. The first production 810 HY flew on 23 September 1930, taking off from the Seine at Les Mureaux. In 1931, 20 GL-811 HYs were ordered, for operation from the seaplane carrier Commandant Teste and from 1933 to 1934 twenty-nine GL-812 HYs and thirteen GL-813 HYs were ordered.

Until 2005 he served as the Coordinator of Cultural Activities for Literature and Arts at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM); he is once again a faculty member there and directs the cultural magazine Revista de la Universidad de M√©xico. He formerly served as director of the Department of Theater and Dance and the Division of Literature at UNAM. He also edits the cultural supplement to the weekly magazine Siempre. Solares is known for mystical occurrences and \\"dislocations of reality\\" in his fiction.See Mario Saavedra, ‚ÄúIgnacio Solares, un devoto de la espiritualidad.‚Äù Babab 23 (January 2004). John S. Brushwood, \\"La realidad de la fantas√≠a. Las novelas de Ignacio Solares,\\" La Semana de Bellas Artes 143 (August 27, 1980). In Anonimo (Anonymous Note, 1979), a work that has been compared to Kafka's \\"The Metamorphosis\\" for its protagonist‚Äôs metamorphosis into another person, we see Solares‚Äô rejection of much organized religion (especially the Roman Catholic Church), but his simultaneous search for the transcendent and religious on the borders of human experience. He has written, \\"I believe in every possible manifestation of spiritual strangeness. I believe in all possible escapes. The only thing I cannot endure is reality, whatever it may be. I believe that the writer is defined by the constant necessity of creating a world, to depart from this world. Literature is more concerned with misery than with happiness. Writing is directly related to frustration. It is a reflection of personal desperation. The writer is profoundly disgusted with his reality.\\"As quoted in Carlos Rojas, \\"La materia de los sue√±os, \\" a short biography of Solares. Solares was born in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, but much of his fiction is set in Mexico City. Casas de encantamiento (Houses of Enchantment, 1987), which won the Novedades prize in 1988, tries to capture Mexico City through time. He has written a number of historical novels over the years, beginning with Madero, el otro (Madero's Judgment, 1989), and including La invasion. The latter, though it vividly describes the grim reality of the United States' invasion of Mexico and occupation of Mexico City in 1847, during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, focuses on the protagonist's personal relationships during and many years after the invasion.Javier Rodr√≠guez Marcos. \\"Entrevista: Ignacio Solares. El Novelista Llena Los Huecos Que Deja La Historia.\\" (\\"The Novelist Fills the Bones that History Leaves.\\") At the website R√≠o Abierto. Columbus (1996), on the other hand, deals with Pancho Villa's invasion of the United States. Nen, la in√∫til (Nen the Useless, 1994) is concerned with the advent of the Conquistadores into Precolumbian central America; Nen is an Aztec girl who is raped by a Spanish soldier. The essays in Cartas a una joven psic√≥loga (Letters to a Young Psychologist, 2000) and the play La moneda de oro ¬øFreud o Jung? (The Golden Coin, Freud or Jung? 2004) reflect Solares' interest in psychotherapy. Solares' Delirium tremens (1979, published in English in 2000 as Delirium Tremens: Stories of Suffering and Transcendence) is a work of non-fiction that collects stories of nightmarish visions experienced by alcoholics when undergoing delirium tremens. It is both a penetrating study of addiction, and a harrowing study of descents into personal hells. Solares' father had experienced delirium tremens when Solares was a boy. Eladio Cort√©s, in his Dictionary of Mexican Literature, has written that \\"Solares' novels have the simplicity of a fairy tale and the complexity of a metaphysical treatise. The author's ability to capture and hold the reader's interest is one of his main assets. He is one of contemporary Mexico‚Äôs best novelists.\\"\\"Solares, Ignacio,\\" in Eladio Cort√©s, Dictionary of Mexican Literature, Greenwood Press, 1992.

The Tuba Mirabilis stop was removed in the 1980s and replaced with an Oboe stop. An unusual feature of Hope-Jones' planned organ design was a Great to Swell 2nd Touch coupler, and a knob for this exists on the console, though it appears to have never been connected.Fisher, R: All Saints Church, Higher Kinnerton - Organ, p. 1-2, 2003 See also *List of new churches by John Douglas References Category:Churches in Flintshire Category:Churches completed in 1893 Category:19th-century Church of England church buildings Category:John Douglas buildings ","title":"All Saints Church, Higher Kinnerton"},{"id":"13333532","text":"USS Courlan (AMc-44) was an Accentor-class coastal minesweeper acquired by the U.S. Navy for the dangerous task of removing mines from minefields laid in the water to prevent ships from passing.

Composed of three separate stories, the film vividly portrays Taiwan during the cold war period when the country developed its economy with help from the United States. It is regarded as a hallmark of Taiwanese New Cinema. The English title of the film is derived from the film's first vignette, directed by Hou Hsiao-hsien, which tells about a man who ekes out a living for his young family by carrying advertisement sandwich boards. The second vignette tells of two ambitious young men who discover too late that a product they are trying to sell is defective.

Barnabas Root (Fahma Yahny) Barnabas Root, born Fahma Yahny, (Sherbro Island, Sierra Leone, West Africa \\\\- Paper presented by Matt Norman at the annual meeting of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History) was the grandson of an American-born slave who had moved to Africa through the efforts of the American Colonization Society. Yahny attended the original Mendi Mission school in Mendiland, Sierra Leone, where he was educated by Mary McIntosh, an alumna of Knox College, in Galesburg, Illinois, which was founded in the Calvinist tradition. The College and many of the Congregational churches of the city were active with the American Missionary Association. Yahny was brought to the United States twice by alumni of the College, first in 1859, and then again in 1863, in the company of C. F. Winship, a missionary at the Mission, for a higher education at their alma mater. At that time Yahny took the name of the Illinois man who had organized the effort to pay for his education. Root was one of the first Black men to receive a college degree in Illinois, very likely the first. Even in the strongly anti-slavery environment of Knox, though, Root was not shielded from prejudice. He was discouraged enough by what he faced that he considered transferring to Oberlin College in Ohio, which had been admitting African Americans for nearly thirty years by then.A letter by Root dated September 23, 1868 Nevertheless, he decided to stay there, completing a bachelor's degree at Knox College in 1870.Knox College website \\"Obama's Speech\\" June 27, 2007 He was Knox's first \\"international\\" student and presumably its first Black male graduate, He went on to earn a Bachelor of Divinity at Chicago Theological Seminary in 1873.

C. McClurg in 1926. Plot summary Set in the fictional European kingdom of Lutha, the protagonist is a young American named Barney Custer, of Beatrice, Nebraska, who is the son of an American farmer and a runaway Luthan princess, Victoria Rubinroth. Unaware of his royal blood, much less that he is a dead ringer for his relative Leopold, the current king of Lutha, Barney visits Lutha on the eve of the First World War to see for himself his mother's native land. As he arrives in Lutha, King Leopold has just escaped from his ten years' imprisonment at the hands of his scheming uncle, Prince Peter of Blentz. Much to his own and everyone else's confusion, Barney is naturally mistaken for the king, leading to numerous complications. Barney meets and falls in love with Princess Emma Von Der Tann, Leopold's promised bride and then becomes intimately involved in Luthan affairs, working to help the king and ultimately allowing himself to be proclaimed as king while impersonating Leopold to prevent Prince Peter from seizing the throne. He finally succeeds in foiling Peter's plans to become king himself by rescuing and fighting for the real king. Unfortunately, after his coronation, King Leopold discovers the shared love between Barney and Princess Emma, and Barney is forced to leave Lutha, mimicking the flight of his father years earlier, though his father left with a princess‚ÄîBarney has only a soldier. Thus ends part one. In the second part of the novel, the European skies are darkening as World War I has begun. In Lutha, King Leopold has proven himself to be a bad ruler and has not yet persuaded Princess Emma to marry him. In Nebraska, Barney's soldier friend leaves the farm to return to Lutha. Barney himself is attacked by one of Prince Peter's henchmen and he decides to return to Lutha as well. After an adventurous trip across war-torn Europe, which includes being mistaken for a spy by the Austrians and barely escaping a firing squad, Barney finally reaches Lutha, where he once again is forced to impersonate the king in order to save Lutha from the advancing Austrians. He makes a diplomatic alliance with Serbia, and defeats the Austrians in person, thereby saving Lutha. The real king Leopold, who has been his antagonist throughout the second part of the novel, is mistaken for Barney and killed by one of Prince Peter's henchmen. Barney then consents to remain as king of Lutha, married at last to Princess Emma. The Mad King was serialized in All- Story Weekly in 1914. Historical background Unlike Anthony Hope's Ruritanian novels, The Mad King is set in a real world situation. Lutha's location is easy to find, as Burroughs describes it as being between Austria and Serbia. Lutha's circumstances mirror those of many Balkan nations forced to choose sides in the opening phase of the First World War. Burroughs also clearly chooses sides in the conflict, portraying Austria (and by extension her German allies) as the bad guys. Serbia is represented as being a good power. At the time of writing and publication in 1914-15, developments in the actual war‚Äîwhere Serbia seemed able to hold its own in the fighting with the Austrians‚Äîmade the book's ending plausible. This was, however, decisively changed by the entry of Bulgaria into the war; Serbia was completely overrun, devastated, and occupied until the end of the war. If Lutha were real, it would probably have shared Serbia's fate. If liberated from Austrian occupation in 1918, Lutha might have struggled to preserve independence and avoid incorporation in the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Had Lutha remained independent, having an American citizen on its throne might have come under close international scrutiny in the Versailles Conference. Interlude The Eternal Lover‚Äîa collection of two novellas written in 1914/1915 and first published together in 1925Tarzan.com, The Eternal Lover‚Äîhas as its protagonist Barney's sister Victoria Custer. These stories take place between Barney's two Luthan adventures, when he and his sister are the guests of Tarzan on the latter's African estate. When cave man Nu is released from suspended animation, Victoria discovers that she is the reincarnation of his great love Nat-ul. The story covers her adventures with Nu.

Among members of the clan in powerful positions in the shogunate was its founder Hayashi Razan, who passed on his post as hereditary rector of the neo-Confucianist Sh≈çhei-k≈ç school to his son, Hayashi Gah≈ç, who also passed it on to his son, Hayashi H≈çk≈ç; this line of descent continued until the end of Hayashi Gakusai's tenure in 1867. However, elements of the school carried on until 1888, when it was folded into the newly organized Tokyo University. Hayashi clan position The Hayashi family's special position as personal advisors to the sh≈çguns gave their school an imprimatur of legitimacy that no other contemporary Confucian academy possessed.Yamshita, Samuel Hideo. \\"Yamasaki Ansai and Confucian School Relations, 1650‚Äì1675,\\" Early Modern Japan. 9:2, 3‚Äì18 (Fall 2001). This meant that Hayashi views or interpretation were construed as dogma.Ooms, Herman. Tokugawa Ideology: Early Constructs, 1570-1680, pp. 107‚Äì108. Anyone challenging the Hayashi status quo was perceived as trying to challenge Tokugawa hegemony; and any disagreements with the Hayashi were construed as threatening the larger structure of complex power relations within which the Confucian field was embedded.Bourdieu, Pierre et al. (1992). An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology, p. 106. Any disputes in the Confucian field in the 1650s and 1660s may have originated in personal rivalries or authentic philosophical disagreements, but any issues became inextricably intertwined with the dominating political presence of the sh≈çgun and those who ruled in his name. In this period, the Tokugawas and the fudai daimy≈ç were only the most powerful of the nearly 250 domain-holding lords in the country. By filling the high offices of the shogunate with his trusted, loyal daimy≈ç, the sh≈çguns paradoxically increased the power of these office holders and diminished the powers which were once held by Ieyasu alone.,Totman, Conrad. (1967). Politics in the Tokugawa Bakufu, 1600‚Äì1843, p. 208. which caused each to more zealously guard against anything which might be seen to minimize intertwined power and prestige; and the varying characters of the sh≈çguns further exacerbated this development.Yamashita, p. 16; Bourdieu, p. 106. The Edo period power structure itself discouraged of dissent from what became the accepted Hayashi orthodoxy. In the spectrum of the Tokugawa retainer band, the Hayashi family head himself was a high-ranking hatamoto (thus coming under the jurisdiction of the wakadoshiyori), and possessed an income of 3,500 koku.Ogawa, Edo no hatamoto jiten, p. 85.

It was formerly the capital of Royal Kingdoms in the area. With the fading away of the kingdoms, the town lost much of its importance. History Rajnagar was founded by Bir Singh, a great Hindu Raja in ancient times on whose name the district Birbhum was formed. In 1206, Rajnagar was occupied by Muhammad Shiran, a General of Muhammad Bakhtiyar, and annexed by Ali Mardan, on 1211. However, Pathans do not seem to have enjoyed undisputed control over the entire district or area. At least the western part of the district, with Rajnagar as its capital, seems to have been ruled by the descendants of Bir Singh, the Bir Rajas. The rent roll of Todar Mal leads to the conclusion that by the middle of the 16th century the entire district was brought under the administration of the Mughals through numerous wars raged on this 'Gateway of Bengal'. The later Muslim Zamindars of Rajnagar, known as \\"Nagar Raj\\", were feudatories of the Mughals.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, The Economic Life of a Bengal District: Birbhum 1770 - 1857, pp. 2 - 9, The University of Burdwan, 1984. Nagar Raj Rajnagar Raj Palace in a ruined condition Jonad Khan, an adventurous Pathan, is said to have established the House at Nagar in 1600, having treachouresly killed the Bir Raja under whom he served. He was succeeded by his son, Bahadur Khan, alias Ranmast Khan. Asadullah Khan (1697-1718), grandson of Bahadur Khan, was a pious man who was on good terms with Murshid Quli Khan, the Nawab of Bengal. A devout person, he enjoyed full autonomy. His son, Badi-uz-zaman Khan (1718‚Äì52) made an abortive attempt at shaking off the nominal allegiance to Murshidabad. He was invested with the title of Raja by Murshid Quli Khan. During his reign Birbhum was ravaged by the Marathas. They also overran Rajnagar. It was during the reign of his son, Asad-uz-Zaman Khan (1752-1777) that the Nagar Raj witnessed the zenith of its power and then started declining. The Raja was faithful to the Nawab and after the Battle of Plassey, was on bad terms with the British. He was defeated by the combined forces of the British and Mir Qasim in 1761. He fled, regrouped and fought back again. He was completely routed at the Battle of Hetampur in 1765. By a treaty, he was restored to his estate but much of his autonomy was lost. In the course of time, they lost their supremacy to the Hetampur Raj. The British set up their district headquarters at Suri, and by the early 19th century, Rajnagar had been reduced to a deserted town with dilapidated palaces and ruins of habitation, and the forest slowly encroaching.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, p. 14 Nostalgia The last Pathan ruler held sway over the area in the mid-19th century, but Rafiqul Alam Khan, a successor of the Nagar Raj family, is still honoured as the Raja by the town's residents, the descendants of the one-time tenants of his predecessors. On the occasion of the Muslim festivals of Muharram and Eid, he regains his position as the Raja of Rajnagar. The present Raja did not get a realm from his ancestors but is the proud owner of a royal attire with a royal diadem made of silk. The attire is tattered, but Raja Saheb still wears it when he becomes the \\"ruler\\" ‚Äî twice a year.

Economy Proximity to the supply centres of raw material, as well as the royal court and an aristocratic community, gave rise to certain centres of cottage industries for cotton and tasar silk in the Tantipara-Bhabanipur- Karidhya zone. The famine of 1770 left both agriculture and industry in a bad shape. Trade also suffered. People had sunk to a depth of poverty which the magistrate of Birbhum emphatically said he had not seen anywhere in India. The Maratha raids of 1742-45 had earlier laid waste not only the countryside but also Rajnagar itself.Gupta, Dr. Ranjan Kumar, pp. 14,20,26 Transport=Railway The nearest railway station is Siuri. Road The State Highway 6 originates from Rajnagar. Buses are available in the town for larger cities like Suri, Bolpur etc. Education Rajnagar Mahavidyalaya was established at Rajnagar in 2009.

History The Mishpacha Publishing Group was founded in 1984 with the publication of the Hebrew Mishpacha magazine. Publisher and CEO Eli Paley teamed with Rabbi Moshe Grylak towards the goal of producing a magazine that would serve as a conduit for the exchange of ideas and values between the varying streams within Jewish orthodoxy, among them the Hasidic, Yeshivish, Sephardic, and Modern Orthodox communities. With no other weekly or monthly magazines geared towards Orthodox Jewish readership at that time, Mishpacha quickly gained popularity, in effect launching the Jewish Orthodox magazine industry. The first editor for the Hebrew edition was Asher Zuckerman (now the editor of the Hebrew newspaper Sha'ah Tova). First beginning as a monthly, it became a weekly in the beginning of 1991. After a while the newspaper split into two competing weekly papers. One is left with the original name \\"Mishpacha\\" and the other is called \\"Hashavua\\" (This Week). According to a TGI (Target Group Index, a subsidiary of market research company Kantar Group) survey of September 2016, the Hebrew \\"Mishpacha\\" exposure rate is 24.1%. In light of this, it is the most popular Haredi weekly and weekend in Israel. A magazine \\"Te'imot\\" (tasting), which is also published by Mishpacha, is rated 6.7% according to this survey. In the years 2011‚Äì2013, Hebrew \\"Mishpacha\\" released a Free newspaper which was distributed in the middle of the week, but its publication was halted due to pressure from the Yated Ne'eman editorial board, which also publishes a free edition in the middle of the week. English edition The English Mishpacha launched in 2004 with a weekly package including the flagship Mishpacha Magazine and Mishpacha Junior. Mishpacha was the first full-color weekly magazine targeting the Anglo- Orthodox population worldwide, with the standalone children's magazine also serving as an innovation. Family First, introduced to the package in 2005, was also the first of its kind, a full-color weekly magazine by and for Jewish women. \\\\---- Mishpacha frequently addresses social problems. For example, it has addressed issues such as the shababniks (Haredi street youth) and violence in the family; and has waged a battle against educational institutions‚Äô discrimination against Mizrahim and the newly religious. But it brings up these issues without mentioning names, so no one will be hurt. Mishpacha's publications, as a rule, do not print photos of women. There have been rare exceptions to this. For example, when Hillary Clinton was running for president against Donald Trump, the magazine chose to print her face, although very obscured by a blue field. Some attribute the significant increase in Haredim joining Israel's army to Mishpacha as well as mental health awareness and mental health services access over the past decade amongst Orthodox Jewish populations to the public dialogue stimulated by Mishpacha magazines and other Jewish publications such as Ami. Mishpacha has been banned by many rabbinical leaders including Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv. However, Mishpacha has turned to the rabbinical court of the Haredi community (Badatz) which forbade harassment of the magazine. Haaretz, the newspaper of Israel's secular left, describes the Hebrew version of Mishpacha as one of the \\"most powerful\\" newspapers in the Haredi community.

The Roman Catholic Latin Rite Basilica is dedicated to Our Lady of Good Health. Devotion to Our Lady of Good Health of Velankanni can be traced back to the mid-16th century, and is attributed to three separate miracles at the sites surrounding the Basilica: The apparition of Blessed Mary and the Christ Child to a slumbering shepherd boy, the healing of a handicapped buttermilk vendor, and the rescue of Portuguese sailors from a deadly sea storm. These accounts are mere oral lore with no written record or attested sources to support them. Initially, only a simple and modest chapel was built by the Portuguese sailors who washed ashore safely. More than 500 years later, the nine-day festival and celebration is still observed and draws nearly 5 million pilgrims each year. The Shrine of Our Lady of Vailankanni is also known as \\"the Lourdes of the East\\" because it is one of the most frequented pilgrimage centres in India. History There are no historical documents about the apparitions of the Virgin Mary at Velankanni. Oral tradition is the source for the two apparitions of the Blessed Mother of Velankanni in the 16th century, and the saving of the Portuguese sailors from a tempest in the Bay of Bengal in the later 17th century.History of the Basilica on its home page This well/pool is situated where the first apparition had occurred. The first Marian apparition is said to have occurred in May 1570, when a local shepherd boy was delivering milk to a nearby house. Along the way he met a beautiful woman holding a child, who asked for some milk for the little one. After giving her the milk, he continued on his way, and upon making the delivery discovered that the jug was now completely full of fresh, cool milk. A small shrine was built near the site where the boy encountered the woman, a location that came to be called Matha Kulam, which means Our Lady‚Äôs Pool.Thomas, William. \\"Our Lady of Health, Velankanni, India\\", Catholic Voice, 2 August 2009 Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health The second Marian apparition is said to have happened in 1597, not far from Matha Kulam. A beautiful woman with a young boy in her arms appeared to a young crippled boy selling buttermilk. The little boy asked for some buttermilk, and after he drank it, the woman asked the boy selling buttermilk to visit a gentleman in the next town and ask him to build a chapel in her honor at that location. The boy set out quickly and realized that he was no longer lame. A small thatched chapel was quickly built in honor of Our Lady of Health, called in Tamil \\"Arokia Matha\\". The third incident occurred when a Portuguese ship sailing from Macao to Sri Lanka was caught in a storm in the Bay of Bengal. They invoked the help of the Blessed Virgin under her title \\"Star of the Sea\\". The storm subsided and the 150 men on board were saved. It was 8 September, the Feast of the Nativity of Mary. In thanksgiving, the sailors rebuilt the Shrine to Our Lady of Good Health, and continued to enhance it whenever their voyages brought them to the area. The shrine that started as a thatched chapel in the mid-sixteenth century became a parish church in 1771 when Catholics in India were under persecution from the Dutch. Later in 1962 it was granted a Special status of a Minor Basilica by Pope John XXIII.VAILANKANNI - an Overview on Tamil Nadu government website The shrine of Vailankanni was elevated to the status of 'Minor Basilica' and merged with the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome on 3 November 1962 by Pope John XXIII.

Virgin Mary is depicted wearing a sari. The usual time for pilgrimage is during the annual festival between 29 August to 6 September and Christmas.\\"Thousands of pilgrims throng Velankanni for Christmas\\" news from The Hindu Some pilgrims, instead of using a mode of transport, perform \\"walking pilgrimages\\" to it. They attend mass, novenas, flag-hoisting and carry a palkhi of Mary in a procession. A major event is the procession, where only women are allowed to pull the first car and a statue of Mary is in the last and most decorated one. People of other religions also take part. The pilgrims sometimes shave their heads as an offering and perform ear-piercing ceremonies, both being Hindu traditions. Another ritual considered sacred is dipping oneself in the pond. There is a holy flag which is lowered to signal the end of the festival. Due to the number of pilgrim visits during festival season, the Indian Railways introduced special train services to the town of Velankanni. Architecture Layout of the Basilica complex: 1.

The building is painted in white, except for the roof that is made of red tiles. Annai Velankanni Church Annai Velankanni Feast 2012 The early part of the 20th century marked rivalry between Jesuits and Franciscans regarding their influence on missionary work in Velankanni. In 1928, the Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (managed by the Jesuits) was demolished and the statues were brought to the Shrine of Our Lady of Good Health; in 1933 the Shrine was expanded with two new wings, to the right and to the left of the 'Main Altar', meeting the nave at right angles. A spacious vestry was provided immediately behind the altar. Thus the entire sacred edifice began to assume the shape of a Latin Cross. Right over the center of the ancient main altar was the miraculous image of Our Lady of Good Health. In 1956, a new welcome arch was blessed and opened by Bishop Sundaram. The illuminated arch stood to show the way to eager pilgrims who sought the protection of Mary. In January 1961, a new central altar, executed in white marble, replaced the former one made of cement concrete. In 1974-75, an extension of the basilica was built behind the existing central altar to accommodate the multilingual pilgrims. The extension included a two-storied church with high dome and high gothic spirals. It was designed to resemble the Basilica in Lourdes, France.All roads lead to Velankanni on The Hindu news.

Timothy Wesley John Brady (born 11 July 1956) is a Canadian composer, electric guitarist, improvising musician, concert producer, record producer and cultural activist. Working in the field of contemporary classical music, experimental music, and musique actuelle, his compositions utilize a variety of styles from serialism to minimalism and often incorporate modern instruments such as electric guitars and other electroacoustic instruments. His music is marked by a synthesis of musical languages, having developed an ability to use elements of many musical styles while retaining a strong sense of personal expression. Some of his early recognized works are the 1982 orchestral pieces Variants and Visions, his Chamber Concerto (1985), the chamber trio ...in the Wake... (1985, 1988), and his song cycle Revolutionary Songs (1994).Timothy Brady, Encyclopedia of Music in Canada, by James Hale, August 30, 2019 He is internationally recognized as one of the world's leading experimental/new music guitarists (1997, Guitar Player: \\"One of the 30 Most Important Guitarists for the Future of the Instrument\\"), and in recent years has gained a strong reputation as one of Canada's leading composers of chamber, orchestral and music theatre works (2003 Prix OPUS Composer of the Year award, given by the Conseil qu√©b√©cois de la musique; 2006 Jan V. Matejcek award, given by SOCAN). Biography=Early years and studies Brady was born in Montr√©al on July 11, 1956. He began playing guitar at age eleven and was largely self-taught until the age of nineteen, with the exception of 18 months of basic beginner guitar lessons (chords and strumming, playing acoustic folk music). He switched from acoustic to electric guitar at sixteen, and started his own rock band soon after. The band (going under the names Tosh and Mystrale) quickly became a vehicle for not only playing, but also for composing music and by nineteen his interest in jazz and other instrumental music had eclipsed the abilities of the rock (now almost jazz-fusion) group. Brady studied music at Concordia University in Montreal (1975‚Äì1978, composition with Alan Crossman, guitar with Claude Dyotte), followed by graduate studies at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston (1978‚Äì1980, composition with W. Thomas McKinley and guitar with the legendary Mick Goodrick). The Toronto period (1980‚Äì1986) In 1980 Brady moved to Toronto where he began working both as a contemporary classical composer and as a jazz guitarist. In Toronto his work as a composer was still strongly influenced by modernist tendencies (i.e.: Elliott Carter, Anton Webern, Pierre Boulez), including his earliest professional chamber piece for voice and ensemble, 4 Songs and an Intermezzo, and other early works such as his String Quartet #1, the chamber work Five Settings (1983, commissioned by Arraymusic), and the Chamber Concerto (1985, commissioned by New Music Concerts). A series of imaginative but conventional modernist chamber and orchestral works would start to make Brady's reputation as a composer across Canada, and would win him 5 composition awards from CAPAC (now SOCAN) from 1982 to 1986, and he was a finalist in the 1986 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Young Composers' Competition, with the work Visions. His most ambitious and complex modernist work, the 1982 orchestral score Variants, was premiered by the Esprit Orchestra in Toronto in the 1987‚Äì1988 season, recorded by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, as a result of winning the 1986 Micheline Coulombe St-Marcoux Prize (CAPAC). However, two works of the Toronto period point to the future vision of music as a more unified means of expression, without stylistic boundaries: SOUND OFF (1983), for 40 saxes, 30 trombones, 30 trumpets and 8 bass drums (an outdoor performance piece ‚Äì unperformed until 1999) and Visions (1984), for improvising soloist and string orchestra. This latter work was to become his first CD release in 1988, in a remarkable performance by trumpeter Kenny Wheeler, with the Orchestre de chambre de Montr√©al. First recordings, first productions Brady also recorded and produced his first 4 records in Toronto ‚Äì an ECM-influenced jazz trio set of original tunes called Chalk Paper, a recording of 3 chamber works for solo piano (performed by Marc Wider), and two digitally recorded LPs of music for solo guitar and electronics: dR.E.aM.s (1985) and The Persistence of Vision (1987). These two solo recordings began to make his reputation as a guitar innovator both in Canada and internationally. Brady's Toronto years also mark the beginning of his work as a concert producer. In 1982 he founded the production company Contemporary Music Projects, and he would produce and perform in major jazz orchestra events with iconic American jazz arranger Gil Evans (1984) and maverick Canadian trumpeter/composer Kenny Wheeler (1985). During this period his various jazz groups/big bands performed in clubs and concerts in Toronto and Montr√©al, and did recordings of his original jazz works for the CBC Radio programme Jazz Beat, as well as for the new music/contemporary classical programme Two New Hours. Brady had his first major international collaboration in 1983, performing a duo concert at the Edmonton Jazz City Festival with the Hungarian bass virtuoso Aladar Pege. London interval (1986‚Äì1987) From 1986 to 1987 Brady lived in London, England, studying conducting privately with Odaline de la Martinez, playing jazz gigs with well-known UK jazz musicians such as Clark Tracey and Guy Barker, and recording a studio concert of originals for the BBC. Montreal, part 1: Bradyworks (1987‚Äì1997) Upon returning to Montreal in 1987, Brady founded his own chamber group and production company in order to have some control over his work, and his new vision of creative music. The group was named simply \\"Bradyworks\\". The first major Bradyworks project was Inventions, a 90-minute music and dance collaboration, created in conjunction with Ottawa choreographer Julie West. The work included the 5 musicians of Bradyworks plus the jazz soloists Barre Phillips (bass) and John Surman (saxophones). A CD of the project was released in the autumn of 1991, to coincide with the groups‚Äô first major tour, including 13 concerts across Canada, plus a performance at Roulette, New York's well-known experimental music space. The tour featured a chamber work entitled The Songline, which had been commissioned by and premiered at the Festival international de musique actuelle de Victoriaville (FIMAV). This project, as with almost all of his recorded productions since 1988, was produced in collaboration with engineer and producer Morris Apelbaum, who also works as live sound engineer for the Bradyworks ensemble. 1992 saw the release of his landmark solo guitar and electronics CD Imaginary Guitars. This was followed by several other solo guitar CDs, all focusing on composing new music for guitar with electronics and tape: Scenarios (1994), Strange Attractors (1997) and the double CD 10 Collaborations (2000). All these recordings were on the Justin Time Records label, out of Montreal. Brady toured extensively in the 1990s as a solo guitarist, including performances at the 1993 Printemps de Bourges music festival, the 1993 Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra New Music Festival (with his first electric guitar concerto, LOUD), the 1993 Bang On A Can Festival, a 1994 collaboration with the Rel√¢che ensemble in Philadelphia, a 1995 UK tour for the Sonic Arts Network with a performance for the BBC at The South Bank (London), a commission and a solo performance at Maison Radio-France (INA-GRM, Paris) in 1996 (and again in 2001), the 1997 Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, and the 1999 Strange Attractor's world tour, with 23 concerts in Canada, the United States, Europe, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong, including a performance at the Festival international de Jazz de Montr√©al. The Body Electric Festival (1997) Since 1994 Brady had been running the concert production company Innovations en concert, producing many different events in Montreal, some with his music, but also producing concerts by many touring and local musicians as well. In 1995 Brady had the idea of producing the first-ever international festival of contemporary chamber and orchestral music for electric guitar. In collaboration with partners in Toronto, Jonqui√®re, Winnipeg, Victoria, Vancouver, and New York City, he created the festival The Body Electric / Guitar√©volution, which was held in 1997, presenting a total of 23 concerts. The event featured performances by David Torn, the Fred Frith Quartet, Elliott Sharp, Ren√© Lussier, Ron Samworth, Greg Lowe, John Oliver, Kapser Toeplitz, Scott Johnson and Paul Dresher. Brady also premiered his second electric guitar concerto, The Body Electric (1997), on the closing night of the event, a work commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and performed by the Esprit Orchestra. A second, somewhat smaller version of the festival was held in 2002. Bradyworks ‚Äì vocal music (1997‚Äì2000) Parallel to his work as a guitarist, his interest in opera, music theatre and vocal music had become one of his main artistic preoccupations. From 1989 to 1992 he worked on a chamber opera version of the Man Booker prize-winning novel The Bone People, by New Zealand author Keri Hulme. The project was never completed due to difficulties in working with Hulme, but it sparked a keen interest in vocal music and music theatre which continues in his current works. Out of this failed opera experience came his first major song-cycle, entitled Revolutionary Songs (1993), based on a variety of poems in English, French and Spanish. Sung by soprano Nathalie Paulin, and scored for Bradyworks, the work was premiered at the Mus√©e d‚Äôart contemporain de Montr√©al and later released on CD in 1996, supported by a 5-city Canadian tour. The work combines pulsing, jazz and minimalist inflected harmonies with distorted rock guitar and a large range of electronic tape sounds to create a 40-minute portrait of the experience of political revolution. The work had three American performances in 2001, at The Kitchen (New York City, performed by Bradyworks), in Kansas City (New Ear Ensemble), and in Boston (Auros New Music Ensemble). A second Bradyworks song-cycle followed, entitled The Knife Thrower's Partner (1997), using only a quartet of acoustic instruments in setting a text by Canadian poet Douglas Burnet Smith (whose work Brady would use again in 2009). Bradyworks toured this piece across Canada in 2000, giving 8 performances with mezzo-soprano Anne-Marie Donovan. Montreal, part 2: operas, Ambiances magn√©tiques, CNMN (2002‚Äì2005 ) In 2002 Brady parted company amicably with Justin Time Records and began working with Ambiances Magn√©tiques based in Montreal. The first release was of his work 20 Quarter Inch Jacks, a piece for 20 electric guitars, commissioned by the Festival Les Coups de Th√©√¢tre. In 2003 he released Unison Rituals, a CD of his music for saxophone and chamber ensemble, including the first of many collaborations with the Quasar saxophone quartet, and an overdubbed and reduced performance of the 1983 work SOUND OFF, for 100 winds and 8 bass drums. Later in 2003 Bradyworks performed its first European tour, with concerts in London (for the BBC at Maida Vale), Aberdeen University (Scotland) and at the Project Arts Centre in Dublin (Ireland) as part of the Crash Ensemble's New Music Festival. 2002 saw the premiere of his 45-minute, multi-movement work Playing Guitar: Symphony #1, for solo electric guitar, sampler and 15 musicians. The work was performed in Montreal (Oscar Peterson Hall, Concordia University ‚Äì Oct. 2002), Marseille (G.M.E.M. ‚Äì Festival Les Musiques ‚Äì May 2003) and New York (Interpretation Series, Merkin Hall ‚Äì November 2002) by its commissioner, the Nouvel Ensemble Moderne, and was released on CD in 2004. 2002 also saw the premiere of his orchestral work Three or Four Days After the Death of Kurt Cobain by the Orchestre symphonique de Montr√©a under conductor Rafael Frubek de Burghos, followed by a performance by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra in 2004. The next few years would be occupied with the creation and production of Brady's two chamber operas: The Salome Dancer (2005 ‚Äì libretto by John Sobol, commissioned and produced by NUMUS concerts at the Open Ears Festival, with Bradyworks in the pit, conducted by Paul Pulford, with stage direction by Anne-Marie Donovan), and Three Cities in the Life of Dr. Norman Bethune (2003 ‚Äì found-text libretto by the composer, commissioned by La Soci√©t√© Radio-Canada, premiered by Bradyworks and baritone Michael Donovan in Montreal. Bethune had subsequent productions in Lennoxville, Toronto and Guelph (conducted by Pierre Simard), and was released on CD in 2005. Brady left the Innovations en concert production company in 2004 to focus on his own projects (running under the Bradyworks banner), and to work on the beginnings of what would eventually become the Canadian New Music Network (CNMN, 2005).http://www.newmusicnetwork.ca/en/about/tim-brady-qc- president-2005-present/ The CNMN is a large, pan-Canadian movement to make contemporary creative concert music a more vibrant part of Canadian society. The organization brings artists together in an annual event entitled FORUM, held in a different Canadian city each year (Winnipeg ‚Äì 2007, Toronto ‚Äì 2008, Montreal ‚Äì 2009).http://www.newmusicnetwork.ca/en/forum/ Brady is the current president of the CNMN (2005‚Äì2010). Since 2004 he has served on the board of directors of The Music Gallery.  Return of the solo (now multi-media) guitarist / orchestral maneuvers (2006‚Äìpresent)  In 2006 Brady released his first solo CD in 6 years, GO [guitar obsession], signaling a renewed interest in electric guitar music. The CD combined several of his works with pieces by composers Alex Burton, Tristan Murail, Jean-Fran√ßois Laporte and Laurence Crane. He toured music from the CD to the Netherlands in January 2007 in collaboration with the Quasar saxophone quartet (concerts in Eindhoven, Utrecht and at the BIMHAUS in Amsterdam), and in July of the same year he toured the project to Australia, performing in Brisbane (The Powerhouse, with Topology), Perth (Tura Concerts), and at the Darwin International Guitar Festival. He was back in the Netherlands in September 2007 for several performances, and also to give a lecture on new music and the electric guitar, at the OUTPUT Electric Guitar Festival, held in the Muziekgebouw, in Amsterdam. 2006 saw the first of two major collaborations with Montr√©al video artist Martin Messier: the work was entitled My 20th Century, a music/video/theatre work for the Bradyworks ensemble. The work toured Qu√©bec in 2008, including a performance at the Festival international de musique actuelle de Victoriaville, and undertook a 9-city Canadian tour in the autumn of 2009, to coincide with the release of the CD and DVD on Ambiances magn√®tiques. Brady's renewed interest in solo performance led to his second collaboration with Messier: the 65-minute work for video and electric guitar entitled 24 Frames, premiered in Montreal in October 2008. Another long-term collaborator, the Topology ensemble of Brisbane. Australia, brought out a CD of Brady's chamber work in 2007, entitled SCAT, on Ambiances magn√®tiques. His 2002 work 20 Quarter Inch Jacks was given its American premiere in January 2009, produced by CALARTS at the REDCAT Hall of the Disney Auditorium, in Los Angeles, and at Rosza Hall in Calgary in 2012. After many years away from the orchestral composition, 2007 onwards saw a major increase in orchestral works by Brady. This new orchestral music is very different from his earlier, modernist works. Recent orchestral scores include The Choreography of Time: Symphony #2 (for saxophone quartet and orchestra, another collaboration with the Quasar group and the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra), Opposites Attract, a bass clarinet concerto commissioned by the CBC Radio Orchestra for Lori Freedman, The Guess Who Symphony, a series of radical deconstruction of songs by the 1960s/1970s rock group The Guess Who (also a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation commission), Requiem 21.5 (for solo violin and orchestra) and Un Amour, un Hiver, for voice and orchestra, with text by Qu√©bec pop icon Michel Rivard. The last two works are part of his work with the Orchestre symphonique de Laval, where he served as composer in residence (2008‚Äì2013). The relationship with Laval created the first version of his work \\"Requiem 21.5 - concerto for violin and orchestra\\", as well as his \\"Viola Concerto\\", written for OSL violist Jutta Puchhammer-S√©dillot. From 2011 - 2015 Brady worked closely with Symphony Nova Scotia, in Halifax, premiering both final version of \\"Requiem 21.5\\" as well as a commissioned work: \\"The How and the Why of Memory: Symphony #4\\". These two works, along with the Viola Concerto, were recorded for Centrediscs, and released in 2015. The CD won an East Coast Music Award for Best Classical CD. His work \\"Atacama: Symphony #3\\" was premiered in 2012, released in ATMA Classique in 2013, and nominated for a Juno that year. It was performed as well at the Festival international de musique actuelle de Victoriaville (2013) and in New York at National Sawdust in 2015, but David T. Little's Newspeak Ensemble and Trinity Wall Street Choir, conducted by Julian Wachner. 2015 saw the premier of his chamber opera \\"Ghost Tango\\" (libretto by Douglas Smith) in Halifax (NS), and Kitchener (ON), and 2016 saw the release of the first CD of his new electric guitar quartet, Instruments of Happiness, on the US Starkland Records label. From 2014 - 2017 he also worked on the music for choreographer Isabelle van Grimde's multi-media piece \\"Symphonie 5.1\\", in collaboration with drummer Thom Gossage. The work toured to Canada, The Netherlands and France. The Instruments of Happiness Quartet did a major Canadian tour in 2017, performing in Edmonton, Halifax, Regina, Brandon, Winnipeg, Victoria, and Montreal. 2015 also saw his fort work for 100 spatialised electric guitars \\"100 Very Good Reasons Why\\", performed at the Montreal/Nouvelles Musiqeu Festival. A YouTube video of that work has proved quite popular. In 2016 he presented another work for 100 guitars - \\"100 questions, 100 r√©ponse\\", this time in a church. The work was featured in an article on the history of the electric guitar in UK's Guardian newspaper in August 2016. In 2014, after 9 years at the head of the Canadian New Music Network, he stepped down as President. He served on the board until 2017, but is still active in cultural policy development. He was awarded the Canadian Music Centre/Canadian League of Composers, \\"Friends of Canadian Music Award\\" in 2016 for his work at CNMN. His most recent major works were premiered at the 2017 Festival international de musique actuelle de Victoriaville: \\"D√©sir: concerto for electric guitar and large ensemble\\" and \\"8 Songs about: Symphony #7\\". Brady was the soloist in the concerto, and conducted the symphony, which featured the voices of Vincent Ranallo and Sarah Albu. Both works are for a chamber group of 13 players, and were recorded for release in 2018.

The family served the Matsudaira (later Tokugawa) clan from its days in Mikawa Province. It became a family of hatamoto under the Tokugawa shogunate; in 1825, upon receiving a raise in income to 10,000 koku (thanks to the family head Tadafusa, who was then a wakadoshiyori), the Hayashi family entered the ranks of the daimy≈çs. The Hayashi family was famous during the Boshin War because of the actions of its head, Hayashi Tadataka, in the fight against the imperial army. The Hayashi became commoners after Tadataka's surrender late in 1868; however, later on in the Meiji period, Tadataka's adopted son Tadahiro received the title of Danshaku (Baron) in the new kazoku system of peerage.

Radio waves are introduced into the inside of the resonator material from the transmitter circuit and bounce back and forth between the resonator walls, forming standing waves. The walls of the resonator are partially transparent to radio waves, allowing the radio power to radiate into space. An advantage of dielectric resonator antennas is they lack metal parts, which become lossy at high frequencies, dissipating energy. So these antennas can have lower losses and be more efficient than metal antennas at high microwave and millimeter wave frequencies. Dielectric waveguide antennas are used in some compact portable wireless devices, and military millimeter-wave radar equipment. The antenna was first proposed by Robert Richtmyer in 1939. In 1982, Long et al. did the first design and test of dielectric resonator antennas considering a leaky waveguide model assuming magnetic conductor model of the dielectric surface . An antenna like effect is achieved by periodic swing of electrons from its capacitive element to the ground plane which behaves like an inductor. The authors further argued that the operation of a dielectric antenna resembles the antenna conceived by Marconi, the only difference is that inductive element is replaced by the dielectric material. Features Dielectric resonator antennas offer the following attractive features: * The dimension of a DRA is of the order of \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_0} {\\\\sqrt{\\\\epsilon_r}}, where \\\\lambda_0 is the free-space wavelength and \\\\epsilon_r is the dielectric constant of the resonator material. Thus, by choosing a high value of \\\\epsilon_r (\\\\epsilon_r\\\\approx10-100), the size of the DRA can be significantly reduced. * There is no inherent conductor loss in dielectric resonators. This leads to high radiation efficiency of the antenna. This feature is especially attractive for millimeter (mm)-wave antennas, where the loss in metal fabricated antennas can be high. * DRAs offer simple coupling schemes to nearly all transmission lines used at microwave and mm- wave frequencies. This makes them suitable for integration into different planar technologies. The coupling between a DRA and the planar transmission line can be easily controlled by varying the position of the DRA with respect to the line. The performance of DRA can therefore be easily optimized experimentally. * The operating bandwidth of a DRA can be varied over a wide range by suitably choosing resonator parameters. For example, the bandwidth of the lower order modes of a DRA can be easily varied from a fraction of a percent to about 20% or more by the suitable choice of the dielectric constant of the material and/or by strategic shaping of the DRA element. *Use of multiple modes radiating identically has also been successfully addressed. * Each mode of a DRA has a unique internal and associated external field distribution. Therefore, different radiation characteristics can be obtained by exciting different modes of a DRA.

He carried out his footballing activities in several countries, he was most noted for his association with Italian football. Biography Erbstein, first on the right with the Grande Torino Erbstein carried out the majority of his playing career with Budapesti AK, with whom he spent almost a decade, either side of a brief spell with Hakoah Arad in 1922. After first getting a taste for Italian football with Olympia Fiume (Fiume was the Italian name for the present-day Croatian city of Rijeka) he moved to Vicenza for a season. As a manager Bari gave him his first chance, but his forward thinking tactics were ineffective with the group of players at that time, but the fast flowing attractive football caught the eye of the Italian public despite Bari's relegation which saw him relieved of his duties. Short spells at Nocerina, Cagliari and Bari again before moving on to Lucchese where he spent five years gaining promotion to 'Serie A' during this period. Erbstein moved to Torino after that, but because of World War II and the fact that he was Jewish meant that the implementation of the 'Manifesto of Race' which stripped Jewish people of their right to work. Despite these restrictions, he continued to offer his advice through an unofficial role, before leaving Italy and returned to Hungary when it became too unsafe to remain. He was sent to a Nazi forced labor camp near Budapest. He escaped in December 1944, just before he was about to be sent to Auschwitz concentration camp, together with B√©la Guttmann, another famous Jewish-Hungarian player and coach.Alan McDougall (2020). Contested Fields; A Global History of Modern Football After the war Erbstein rejoined Torino, this time in the capacity of a trainer; this was one of the most noted spells in Italian football where they secured the Serie A title. During this successful period, this Torino side became known as Grande Torino.http://theinsideleft.com/searching-erbstein/ Erbstein (as technical director) along with Englishman Leslie Lievesley (as trainer) were co-managers during the 1948‚Äì49 season. Torino were defending champions of Italy and on track to progress further. Disaster struck on 4 May 1949 when Erbstein and the majority of the Torino team died in the Superga air disaster.

Most of these (28) were in county cricket for Worcestershire, but he also appeared at first-class level for the Gentlemen, Army, Free Foresters, North of England and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He made his debut for the Army at Fenner's, in a drawn match against Cambridge University, at the end of May 1922; he claimed the solitary wicket of Cambridge wicket-keeper Dar Lyon. Two further Army appearances that summer produced one more wicket in each of his four bowling innings, while a single match for Free Foresters in 1923 brought him 2-65; he did not score more than 5 in any of his six visits to the crease during those two seasons. Hill was then out of the first-class game for several years, returning in 1926 for one unproductive match (no wickets; no runs) for the Army against Oxford University. The main part of his cricketing career commenced the next year, when he began to play for Worcestershire. His County Championship debut, versus Kent in early May 1927, brought him a first- innings haul of 4-139, though Worcestershire lost the game by an innings. A fortnight later he recorded a career-best return of 6-59 against Northamptonshire, hitting 31 from number eleven for good measure, though again his county were defeated. He ended 1927 with 34 first-class wickets at 26.88, but it was to be 1928 when he achieved his greatest success. Making 23 first- class appearances, by some distance his most of any season, Hill took 73 wickets at 27.23 and claimed five or more in an innings on four occasions. In September he was selected for the Gentlemen against the Players at Dean Park, Bournemouth, and picked up seven wickets in the match, his second-innings 12* also contributing to a nail-biting one-wicket win. Immediately afterwards he played for North of England v South of England at the same venue, and again claimed seven victims in the game. After 1928, Hill was to play only once more for Worcestershire, against the touring South Africans at Worcester in early May 1929. However, he did turn out twice more for MCC and once for the Army, as well as making a minor appearance for MCC against Ireland; all four of these games were at Lord's. His final first-class match was MCC v Wales in late August 1929, in which he took three wickets; his final victim was Harry Symonds. He then went to Malaya and in 1930 played for the Straits Settlements against the Federated Malay States at Kuala Lumpur. During the Second World War, he was a Japanese Prisoner of War and had the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel.

In his public lectures, he frequently speculates that, if we had a history of every advanced species in the universe, we would find that they all had to pass through two large, difficult and unavoidable transitions: (1) accepting conscious responsibility for the future of all life on their planets, and (2) recognizing that their systems of symbolic communication‚Äîsuch as language and mathematics‚Äîdon‚Äôt merely describe reality, but participate in creating it. Most of his major writing efforts have engaged one or both of these evolutionary themes. His defining statement on the first was To Govern Evolution: Further Adventures of the Political Animal. Its vision of human impacts on Earth‚Äôs life systems had been foreshadowed in his earlier book on American natural history, A Place of Power: The American Episode in Human Evolution, and was further developed in Evolution Isn‚Äôt What It Used To Be and All Connected Now. He is now at work on a new book that explores the evolutionary challenges and frontiers of the 21st century. His major statements on the second (constructivist) theme were Reality Isn‚Äôt What It Used to Be and the subsequent anthology The Truth About the Truth. In other books on related subjects, The Future of the Self described changing ways that people are constructing personal identities in contemporary global society, and The Next Enlightenment points out the similarities between Western constructivist thought and Eastern spiritual traditions such as Buddhism. He is currently President Emeritus of the World Academy of Art and Science (having served as president 2000-2008); a founding Fellow of the Meridian International Institute; a Fellow of the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute (LaJolla, CA); and a Distinguished Consulting Faculty member of Saybrook University in San Francisco. In his book Radical Middle, author Mark Satin characterizes Anderson as a radical centrist thinker.Satin, Mark (2004). Radical Middle: The Politics We Need Now. Westview Press and Basic Books, p. 10. . Biography Anderson spent his early years on his family‚Äôs cattle ranch in northeastern Nevada, but has also lived and worked in Germany, Spain, England, and Southern California. His undergraduate education was in political science at the University of California, Berkeley. Later, after military service and several years in magazine journalism, he began graduate studies part-time, completing a doctorate in political science and social psychology at the University of Southern California. For most of his adult life he has been an independent author, lecturer and consultant. He has also taught part-time at various institutions including the University of California, Berkeley; Saybrook University; the California School of Professional Psychology; and California State University, Northridge. In the 1980s and 90s he was also a contributing editor with Pacific News Service in San Francisco, where he wrote many newspaper op-ed columns as well as investigative feature stories. He is on the editorial boards of several journals including The Journal of Humanistic Psychology, Futures: The Journal of Policy, Planning, and Futures Studies, The Journal of Futures Studies (Tamkang University, Taiwan), and Cadmus: The Journal of the South East Asian Division of the World Academy of Art and Science (Zagreb).

US 231 enters the state from Florida south of Madrid and exits into Tennessee, running councurrently with US 431 north of Hazel Green. US 231 passes through the major cities of Dothan, Troy, Montgomery, and Huntsville. From the Florida state line to Wetumpka, US 231 is a major four- lane divided thoroughfare that connects Central Alabama to the Florida Gulf Coast and Panama City. Between Wetumpka and Arab, excluding its overlap with US 280 between Sylacauga and Harpersville as well as portions through major towns, the road is largely rural and two lanes. Between Arab and the Tennessee state line, the route returns to a four-lane divided highway; the route is upgraded to a limited-access freeway and adjoining frontage roads named Memorial Parkway within the city of Huntsville. During its route through the state, US 231 runs concurrently with three state highways. Between the Florida state line and southern Dothan as well as between Huntsville and the Alabama state line, US 231 runs concurrent with unsigned State Route 1 (SR 1). Between northern Dothan and Huntsville, the route is overlaid with SR 53, which is unsigned along its portion with US 231 but does have a signed segment north of Huntsville. Finally, while bypassing Dothan, US 231 is overlaid with the signed SR 210). Route description In Alabama, US 231 is paired with unsigned State Route 53 (SR 53) from Huntsville to Dothan. The route passes through mostly straight terrain between the Tennessee state line and Meridianville, which is home to its junction with Bob Wade Lane, which eventually becomes SR 255. The route descends down a slight hill and enters Huntsville. It becomes a freeway (Memorial Parkway). It junctions with US 72 east/ Sparkman Drive. After a short concurrency with US 72, it splits off onto University Drive. The route almost immediately junctions with Interstate 565 (I-565). It then junctions with a two-part interchange (Clinton Avenue/US 431 South/SR 53 North; Governors' Drive). Here, it gains SR 53 and loses US 431. The route continues south as a freeway until it reaches a specific point when it becomes a four-lane divided highway. It passes by Redstone Arsenal Gate 3's access road, Hobbs Road. The route continues south until it reaches the Clement C. Clay Bridge. It promptly crosses the Tennessee River into Morgan County. The route eventually junctions with SR 36. It climbs up Brindlee Mountain into Union Hill. While climbing, the route makes a slight curve from the southwest to the southeast that is easily noticeable on road maps. It then passes through Morgan City and enters Marshall County. However, the climb up Brindlee Mountain is closed as of March 2020 due to severe erosion and cracks in both directions of the road. Traffic is being rerouted along SR-36, SR-67, Interstate 65, and local roads around Morgan County.https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/2020/02/no-quick-solution-expected- to-repair-closed-highway-231.html The route heads through mountainous terrain to Arab, which is home to its junction with SR 69. This junction is a diamond interchange and is directly above the line with Cullman County. There are no major junctions in Cullman County. It eventually crosses the line into Blount County. The road turns to the southwest and junctions with SR 67. It quickly junctions with US 278. Eventually, the route reaches Blountsville, and past Blountsville, the route junctions with SR 79 North. It reaches Cleveland and splits off from SR 79, which continues on its right of way to Birmingham. US 231 then junctions with SR 160 West, which continues on its next right-of-way. It passes through mountains until it reaches Oneonta, which is home to its junction with SR 75. The route climbs up a high hill and descends it, now crossing into St. Clair County. The route eventually junctions with US 11 and then I-59. It enters Ashville. It junctions with SR 23 and US 411/SR 25 North. After a moderate concurrency with the two routes, US 411 and SR 25 turn southwest towards Leeds. US 231 heads directly south towards Pell City. The route heads through extremely hilly terrain as a two-lane and three-lane road. It reaches Coal City and junctions with SR 144. It continues down through the same terrain to I-20. It reaches US 78 and then SR 34. US 231 reaches Shelby County. It parallels the Coosa River as it reaches Vincent, which is home to its next junction with SR 25. They continue south to Harpersville. SR 25 junctions with US 231 for the last time here as US 231 turns onto US 280. The routes then cross into Talladega County. After a long journey to Sylacauga, the route turns off of US 280 at its junction with SR 21, which is a Diamond Interchange. The route enters Coosa County near this point. In Coosa County, the route junctions with SR 22 in Rockford. It then enters Elmore County after a long journey south. In Elmore County, there are no major junctions until it reaches SR 9. This point is the line with the city of Wetumpka. The route junctions with SR 14 and SR 170 north of the city. Within the city, the routes (SR 9, US 231, and SR 21) junction with SR 111.

The routes turn from east to south and junction with Atlanta Highway. The routes junction with I-85 and gain US 80. The routes turn to the west. US 231 and US 82 turn to the south. SR 21, US 80, and SR 9 continue onward with US 82 west to I-65, US 331, and US 31. US 82 and US 231 continue onward to Pike Road, which is not a road, but a town. South of here, US 82 turns off of US 231 and US 231 continues onward on a four-lane divided highway into Pike County. There are no major junctions in Pike County until US 231 reaches Troy. Here, the route junctions with US 29, SR 10 west, and SR 87. US 231 continues southeast to Brundidge, which is home to its junctions with SR 10 east, SR 93, and SR 125. The route then cuts a corner of Coffee County. There are no major junctions in Coffee County. The route then enters into Dale County. The route junctions with SR 123 and SR 51 in the far-vicinity of Ariton, Alabama. The route reaches Ozark, which is home to its junctions with SR 27, SR 249, and once again SR 123. In Midland City, the route junctions with SR 134 and SR 605. The route has officially entered the Dothan Metropolitan Area. In Houston County, the route has no major junctions until it reaches the Ross Clark Circle, which is US 84 and SR 210. This same junction is the junction with US 231 Bus. and the point where SR 53 ultimately leaves its state-wide concurrency with US 231. The route turns south onto the Ross Clark Circle and heads to the junction with US 84 Bus. East/US 84 West. Here, US 84 leaves the Ross Clark Circle. It then continues southeast until it reaches SR 52. SR 52 does not have a business route, unlike US 231 and US 84. The route turns to the full east and junctions with US 431 once again, for the first time since Huntsville, Alabama, alongside US 431 Bus.. This junction marks the southern terminus of US 431. The route turns south off of the Ross Clark Circle with SR 1. It then heads south for the Florida state line. The route junctions with SR 109 in Hodgesville and SR 605 once again in Madrid, before finally crossing the state line into Campbellton, Florida. History When US 231 was first assigned along with the rest of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926, the route ran only as far north as Montgomery. In 1952, the route was extended through the rest of the state and on to Indiana. The section of US 231 in Huntsville was built as a bypass around the downtown area. The original route ran up what is now Whitesburg Drive on the south side of the city, and Meridian Street in the north.

It travels westward through remote forests to the terminus of Highway 667 at Sultan approximately to the west. The road is one of the only intersections along Highway 144 apart from its termini. The route also provides the only terrestrial road access to the community of Biscotasing and the ghost towns of Jerome Mine and Ramsey.

This agreement opened the road for public use under the maintenance of the company. The road has remained unchanged since, with the exception of the responsibility for its maintenance, which is now under the jurisdiction of Eacom. In the 1990s, provincial MPP Floyd Laughren lobbied for the road to be fully paved, and secured a commitment from the Ministry of Transportation to do so shortly before the 1995 election; however, following the election the plan was cancelled by the new government of Mike Harris.

It was a short-lived mining community and is located on Lake Opeepeesway. Established in 1937 to house gold mine workers, the community had a population of 150 at its peak but was abandoned by 1945 after the mine ceased operations.Jerome Mine profile at ghosttowns.com The nearby community of Ramsey, also established as a company town for workers in the same mine, survived until 1988 as a lumber town. The townsite is accessible via the Sultan Industrial Road. History The Jerome Gold Mine is named in honor of Bert Jerome, an experienced gold prospector who was commissioned to search for gold by the Mining Corporation of Canada and the Ashley Gold Mining Corporation in July 1938. That July, Jerome began searching for gold in a region west of some existing claims that were held by two gentlemen, named Gifford and Shannon, in the main portion of Lake Opeepeesway. By July 11, he had discovered gold by panning in a rusty out- cropping on the southern shore of the lake. This was a remarkable find as it was seemingly out in the open but somehow overlooked by previous prospectors which enabled him to stake six claims by the 17th of July . By September 1938, the Mining Corporation of Canada staked an additional 42 claims. The discovery lead to revelation of an ore body that stretched 700 feet in length and varied in width up to 33 feet. The Jerome Gold Mine was operated by the Mining Corporation of Canada and produced 62,000 ounces of gold between 1939 and 1945. World War II placed increased demands on Canadian mining operations, from the beginning of the war effort in 1939. Pressures were placed on nickel mining for metal usage and gold mining to help finance the war effort and, in particular, increase the spending potential with the United States. Pressure to increase gold production was placed upon the Sudbury area by the Canadian Government in Ottawa. In 1945, the milling tower was destroyed in a fire and capital could not be obtained to rebuild due to the tight financial situation after World War II. The mine was owned by E. B. Eddy Forest Products Company until 1998 when it was purchased by Domtar Incorporated. Present day Geologists have estimated that the mine could potentially hold 2,100,000 troy ounces of gold, of which 25% is silver content.

Analgesia occurs within 32 minutes of oral administration, and lasts for 4‚Äì6 hours. It is similar to tramadol in its dual mechanism of action; namely, its ability to activate the mu opioid receptor and inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine. Unlike tramadol, it has only weak effects on the reuptake of serotonin and is a significantly more potent opioid with no known active metabolites. Tapentadol is not a pro-drug and therefore does not rely on metabolism to produce its therapeutic effects; this makes it a useful moderate-potency analgesic option for patients who do not respond adequately to more commonly used opioids due to genetic disposition (poor metabolizers of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6), as well as providing a more consistent dosage-response range among the patient population. The potency of tapentadol is somewhere between that of tramadol and morphine, with an analgesic efficacy comparable to that of oxycodone despite a lower incidence of side effects. It is generally regarded as a weak-moderate strength opioid (a category shared by many better-known opioids such as hydrocodone and pethidine). Tapentadol was approved by the US FDA in November 2008, by the TGA of Australia in December 2010 and by the MHRA of the UK in February 2011. In India, Central Drug Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) approved tapentadol immediate-release (IR) preparations (50, 75 and 100 mg) for moderate to severe acute pain and extended-release (ER) preparations (50,100,150 and 200 mg) for severe acute pain in April 2011 and December 2013 respectively. Medical use Tapentadol is used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain for both acute (following injury, surgery, etc.) and chronic musculoskeletal pain. It is also specifically indicated for controlling the pain of diabetic neuropathy when around-the-clock opioid medication is required. Extended-release formulations of tapentadol are not indicated for use in the management of acute pain. Tapentadol is Pregnancy Category C. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of tapentadol in pregnant women, and tapentadol is not recommended for use in women during and immediately prior to labor and delivery.Nucynta Label, last updated October 2013. Main FDA index page is here to check for updates. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of tapentadol in children. Contraindications Tapentadol is contraindicated in people with epilepsy or who are otherwise prone to seizures. It raises intracranial pressure so should not be used in people with head injuries, brain tumors, or other conditions which increase intracranial pressure. It increases the risk of respiratory depression so should not be used in people with asthma. As with other mu- opioid agonists, tapentadol may cause spasms of the sphincter of Oddi, and is therefore discouraged for use in patients with biliary tract disease such as both acute and chronic pancreatitis. People who are rapid or ultra rapid metabolizers for the CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 enzymes may not respond adequately to tapentadol therapy. Due to reduced clearance, tapentadol should be administered with caution to people with moderate liver disease and not at all in people with severe liver disease. Adverse effects The most commonly reported side effects of tapentadol therapy in clinical trials were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sleepiness, itchiness, dry mouth, headache, and fatigue. According to the World Health Organization there is little evidence to judge the abuse potential of tapentadol. Although early pre-clinical animal trials suggested that tapentadol has a reduced abuse liability compared to other opioid analgesics the US DEA placed tapentadol into Schedule II, the same category as stronger opioids more commonly used recreationally, such as morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl. Tapentadol has been demonstrated to reduce the seizure threshold in patients. Tapentadol should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures, and in patients who are also taking one or more other drugs which have also been demonstrated to reduce the seizure threshold. Patients at high risk include those using other serotogenic and adrenergic medications, as well as patients with head trauma, metabolic disorders, and those in alcohol and/or drug withdrawals. Tapentadol has been demonstrated to potentially produce hypotension (low blood pressure), and should be used with caution in patients with low blood pressure, and patients who are taking one or more other medications which are also known to reduce blood pressure. Interactions Combination with SSRIs/SNRIs, SRAs, serotonin receptor agonists may lead to potentially lethal serotonin syndrome. Combination with MAOIs may also result in an adrenergic storm. Use of tapentadol with alcohol or other sedatives such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, nonbenzodiazepines, phenothiazines, and other opiates may result in increased impairment, sedation, respiratory depression, and death. Tapentadol is partially metabolized by the hepatic enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 so it innately has interactions with drugs that enhance or repress the activity/expression of one or more of these enzymes, as well as with substrates of these enzymes (due to competition for the enzyme); some enzyme mediators/substrates require dosing adjustments to one or both medications. The combination of tapentadol and alcohol may result in increased plasma concentrations of tapentadol and produce respiratory depression to a degree greater than the sum of the two drugs when administered separately; patients should be cautioned against alcohol consumption when taking tapentadol as the combination may be fatal. Tapentadol should be used with caution in patients who are taking one or more anticholinergic drugs, as this combination may result in urine retention (which can result in serious renal damage and is considered a medical emergency). Pharmacology Tapentadol is an agonist of the Œº-opioid receptor and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI). Analgesia occurs within 32 minutes after oral administration, and lasts for 4‚Äì6 hours. It is 18 times less potent than morphine in terms of binding to human mu- opioid receptors in in vitro research on human tissue. In vivo, only 32% of an oral dose of tapentadol will survive first pass metabolism and proceed to the bloodstream to produce its effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems of the patient. It is similar to tramadol in its dual mechanism of action but unlike tramadol, it has much weaker effects on the reuptake of serotonin and is a significantly more potent opioid with no known active metabolites. Commercial preparations contain only the (R,R) stereoisomer, which is the weakest isomer in terms of opioid activity. The free base conversion ratio for salts includes 0.86 for the hydrochloride. The peak plasma concentration (Cmax; amount of active drug in the bloodstream) when taken after eating is increased by 8% and 18% for tapentadol IR and ER preparations, respectively. This difference is not clinically significant, and tapentadol may be administered orally with or without food as circumstances allow, and the patient will generally not notice any change in the efficacy and/or duration of analgesic effects if the drug is not consistently administered in fasting or fed states (patients will receive the same benefits from their dose regardless of what and when they last ate). The plasma concentration of tapentadol differs to a relevant degree based on the administered dose, with the highest tested dose (250 mg) resulting in a higher Cmax than would be expected via the dose-proportionate plasma concentration expectations. Increased doses of tapentadol should be anticipated to be slightly stronger than predicted by linear functions of the previous dose- response relation. History 75 mg Nucynta (tapentadol) tablets Tapentadol was invented at the German pharmaceutical company Gr√ºnenthal in the late 1980s led by Helmut Buschmann; the team started by analyzing the chemistry and activity of tramadol, which had been invented at the same company in 1962.Helmut Buschmann.

Rotella. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA. 2013. Tramadol has several enantiomers, and each forms metabolites after processing in the liver. These tramadol variants have varying activities at the Œº-opioid receptor, the norepinephrine transporter, and the serotonin transporter, and differing half- lives, with the metabolites having the best activity. Using tramadol as a starting point, the team aimed to discover a single molecule that minimized the serotonin activity, had strong Œº-opioid receptor agonism and strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, and would not require metabolism to be active; the result was tapentadol. In 2003 Gr√ºnenthal partnered with two Johnson & Johnson subsidiaries, Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development and Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical to develop and market tapentadol; Johnson & Johnson had exclusive rights to sell the drug in the US, Canada, and Japan while Gr√ºnenthal retained rights elsewhere.Dan Froicu and Raymond S Sinatra. Tapentadol. Chapter 31 in The Essence of Analgesia and Analgesics, Eds. Raymond S. Sinatra, Jonathan S. Jahr, J. Michael Watkins-Pitchford. Cambridge University Press, 2010. In 2008 tapentadol received FDA approval; in 2009 it was classified by DEA as a Schedule II drug, and entered the US market. Tapentadol was reported to be the \\"first new molecular entity of oral centrally acting analgesics\\" class approved in the United States in more than 25 years. In 2010 Gr√ºnenthal granted Johnson & Johnson the right to market tapentadol in about 80 additional countries.J&J; Press Release. June 7, 2010 Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V.

Jun 1, 2012 Pain Management Market Ripe with Immediate Opportunities In 2011, Nucynta ER, an extended release formulation of tapentadol, was released in the United States for management of moderate to severe chronic pain and received FDA approval the following year for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. After annual sales of $166 million, in January 2015, Johnson & Johnson sold its rights to market tapentadol in the US to Depomed for $1 billion.Staff, The Pharma Letter. January 16, 2015 Depomed pays over $1 billion for US rights to Janssen‚Äôs Nucynta franchise The drug was manufactured at a plant located on the island of Puerto Rico that was hit by Hurricane Maria in 2017 causing a major shortage in the drug's availability. In January 2018 Depomed sold off the manufacturing of the drug and licensed it to Collegium Pharmaceutical for $10 million up front with an annual royalty payment of a minimum $135 million for the next 4 years. This combination of events has caused additional short supply of the drug leaving patients who depend on it to seek alternative treatments. Abuse and controls There have been calls for Tapentadol to be only marketed in countries where appropriate controls exist, but after performing a critical review, the United Nations Expert Committee on Drug Dependence in 2014 advised that tapentadol not be placed under international control but remain under surveillance. Since 2009 the drug has been categorized in the US as a Schedule II narcotic with ACSCN 9780; in 2014 it was allocated a 17,500 kilogram aggregate manufacturing quota. In 2010, Australia made tapentadol an S8 controlled drug. The following year, tapentadol was classified as a Class A controlled drug in the United Kingdom, and was also placed under national control in Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Latvia and Spain. More recently, Canada made the opioid a Schedule I controlled drug. In India (except the state of Punjab), multiple brands of Tapentadol remain available over the counter. Recent reports have suggested increasing tapentadol abuse and dependence in India, where, users have improvised injections with 50 and 100 mg tablets.

Changes of sentiment during the 17th century When Poland and Lithuania were merged by King Sigismund Augustus into one commonwealth (in the Union of Lublin of 1569) the provinces of Volhynia, Podilia and the rest of Ukraine were separated from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and came under the direct rule of Poland. The Zaporozhian Cossacks were generally indifferent to religious matters and bore no particular ill will toward the Jews up to the time of Hetman Nalyvaiko.Jewish Encyclopedia - Cossacks, Early Uprisings They often included religious Jews among their company, but after the Union of Brest Mazur immigration introduced a negative feeling against the Jews from Poland to Ukraine during the reign of Sigismund III (1587‚Äì1632), and Cossacks wanted to baptize Jews now. The guilds that were established, which always feared the competition of the Jews, played a prominent part in connection with various accusations. The higher nobility, however, depended largely on some part of Jews to act as their leaseholders-arendators, agents, and financial managers, and this served in a significant measure as a bar to persecution. Historical records Cossack society was ethnically diverse and some Cossacks may have had their origins as far away as Scotland. Maxym Kryvonis was a mercenary soldier from Scotland. Ivan Pidkova was from Moldavia. Jews also served in the ranks of the Cossacks, although the mechanism of their entry into the Cossack ranks is unclear. The Cossack regiments in Ukraine served administrative purposes, besides military, and had constant demand for able administrators, educated diplomats and scribes. Jews could fulfill those tasks because of their level of literacy and command of several languages.–ë–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∏–π –°. –ê. –Ñ–≤—Ä–µ—ó –≤ –ó–∞–ø–æ—Ä–æ–∑—å–∫—ñ–π Ci—ái. //–ü—Ä–∞—Ü—ñ –Ü–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç—É —î–≤—Ä–µ–π—Å—å–∫–æ—ó –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∏ –í–£–ê–ù. - –ö., 1930. Although the Cossacks were not known for religiosity before the 17th century it is presumed that conversion was a requirement for promotion in the Cossack ranks by the early 17th century. In 1681 Ahmad Kalga, chief councilor of the Khan of Crimea, complained to the Polish ambassador, Piasaczinski, that the Cossacks of the Lower Dnieper had attacked Crimea. Piasaczinski replied that the Cossacks were not subjects of the king of Poland, and that he therefore could not be held responsible for the \\"acts of uncontrollable rovers of the desert that were apostates from all faiths, Poles, Muscovites, Wallachians, Turks, Tatars, Jews, etc., among them\\".(Kostomarov, l.c. p. 55) The responsa of Joel S√§rkes discusses \\"Berakha the Hero\\", who fought in the ranks of Petro Sahaidachny's Cossacks and fell in battle against the Muscovites. The deposition of Berakha's fellow-cossack \\"Joseph son of Moses\\" in the rabbinical court-case of Berakha's widow's permission to remarry states that there were at least 11 Jews in the cossack ranks of the Sahaidachny army in the battle in which Berakha was killed.(1601; Harkavy, \\"Yevrei-Kazaki,\\" in \\"Russki Yevrei,\\" 1880, p. 348; from Responsa Bayit Chadash hayeshanot (◊©◊ï\\"◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊ó◊ì◊© ◊î◊ô◊©◊†◊ï◊™), 57) In 1637 Ilyash (Elijah) Karaimovich was one of the officers of the registered Cossacks, and became their \\"starosta\\" (elder) after the execution of Pavlyuk. Karaimovich is presumed to be born a Karaim (a Turkic ethnic group adherent to Karaite Judaism.)(Kostomarov, l.c. p. 135 In 1594 a Jew known only by his first name Moses served as a deputy to Stanislav Khlopitsky, the Cossack emissary to the court of Emperor Rudolph II. Both Khlopitsky and Moses took oath on the Cossack Host's behalf in their treaty with the Emperor. Historian of the Cossacks Yuri Mytsyk describes a case in which, in 1602 a Jew from the town of Berestye converted to Christianity and joined Zaporozhian Host. His children and property were seized by the qahal, and he had to apply to king Sigismund III for assistance in restitution of his children and property. His quest was successful, and his children joined him. Saul Borovoy In the 1930s a cache containing a large number of documents written in Hebrew and Ukrainian written in Hebrew script was found by the historian and linguist Saul Borovoy (ru) in the archives of the Zaporozhian Sich. Kept at the State Archive in Moscow since the razing of the Sich by General Peter Tekeli in 1775, the documents dealt with foreign and fiscal policies of the Sich, and evidenced not only the presence of (presumably converted) Jews in the upper stratum of the Cossack society (at least 4 are mentioned by name in the Borovoy dissertation), but also in the regiments as well. The Sich Archive became the basis of Borovoy's 1940 tripartite doctoral dissertation. Parts I and II were published in 1940 in Leningrad and 1941 in Moscow respectively. Borovoy could not return to this subject in the post-War anti-semitic climate in Soviet Union, and the 3rd part of his dissertation was never printed and the typographic 'formes' already assembled were destroyed. Borovoy's articles on the subject first came under attack from the anti-semitic circles in Soviet academia, because his research refuted the label of cowardice and timidity commonly applied to the Jews by the anti-semites. Borovoy demonstrated that Jewish society in Poland became polarized due to a large stratum of destitute Jews that were marginalized by the Qahal, and these Jews were likely to lapse and seek their fortunes with the Cossacks. Later Borovoy was criticized by some Jewish circles unwilling to admit the class-related antagonism that made possible Jewish presence on the Cossacks' side. During the 18th century There are many known instances of Jews joining Cossacks in the era that preceded the Destruction of Sich in 1775. One notable case is Simon Chernyavsky who was baptised at the Sich in 1765. He later served as the Sich emissary to the court of Empress Catherine II. Moisey Gorlinsky served the Sich as an interpreter, and Ivan Kovalevsky (who was already baptised prior to his arrival at the Sich) reached the rank of a colonel. Some Jews joined cossacks as teenage fortune seekers, one such was Vasyl Perekhryst, son of Aizik, who joined the Host in 1748. Another Jew received exactly the same surname in baptism at the Sich two years later. Ivan Perekhryst was abducted with his entire heder class during a Cossack raid in 1732. Yakov Kryzhanovsky became a Cossack before 1768, he also served as a deacon at the Sich church. He was literate in many languages, and distinguished himself under the command of Petro Kalnyshevsky during the Russo-Turkish War of 1769-1774. In Folklore In the ancient epics known as dumy sung by the Ukrainian kobzari there is a reference made to a colonel named Matviy Borokhovych (1647), whose family name (meaning \\"son of Baruch\\") indicates Jewish origin.Jewish Encyclopedia- Cossacks, Complaint of Cossack Depredations Cossack surnames of Jewish origin Susanna Luber's study of registration books of the Registered Cossacks contain many surnames that indicate Jewish origin.http://www.patent.net.ua/intellectus/cossacks/337/ua.html Cossack families of Jewish origin include Hertzyk, Osypov-Perekhrest, Perekhryst, Kryzhanovsky, Markevych/Markovych, Zhydenko, Zhydok, Zhydovynov, Leibenko, Yudin, Yudaev, Khalayev, Nivrochenko, Matsunenko, Shabatny, Zhydchenkov, Shafarevich, Marivchuk, Magerovsky, Zrayitel' and others.–ú—ñ—à–∞–ª–æ–≤ –ú. –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫—ñ –∫–æ–±–∑–∞—Ä—Å—å–∫—ñ –¥—É–º–∏. –î–æ –ø–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–Ω—è –≤–∏–Ω–∏–∫–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—è —Ä–æ–∑–≤–∏—Ç–∫—É —Ç–∞ —Å—É—á–∞—Å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω—É —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–±–∑–∞—Ä—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ –µ–ø–æ—Å—É. ‚Äî –°—ñ–¥–Ω–µ–π, 1990 (Ukrainian) Mishalow M. Ukrainian kobzar dumy. Regarding the question of the development and contemporary state of Ukrainian kobzar epos - Sydney, 1990 The Israilovsky Regiment In December 1787, Prince Potemkin, Catherine the Great's favourite and minister, founded a regiment of Jewish Cossacks for the purpose of liberating Jerusalem‚Äîthe culmination of his philo-Semitism.Simon Sebag Montefiore on Russia's treatment of the Jews -in The Spectator Sep 16, 2000 The first partition of Poland in 1772 brought large numbers of Jews into the Russian empire. Catherine granted Potemkin a huge estate, named Krichev, in the newly acquired lands. Potemkin thus came into contact with Jews for the first time. Potemkin was embarking on the task of populating the empty southern steppes around the Black Sea with settlers, and he immediately tried to attract Jews from both Poland and the Mediterranean to his new settlements, in particular those Jews that were active in viticulture. He resettled these Jews in empty smallholdings left by the Zaporozhians. He also gathered around him a coterie of rabbis with whom he would discuss theology. One in particular, Joshua Zeitlin, a wealthy merchant and scholar, became his close friend. \\"The two men - consort of the Russian Empress and rabbi in yamulka and ringlets - would ride together chatting amicably. Zeitlin 'walked with Potemkin like a brother and friend'. He achieved a position that no practising Jew in Russia has ever achieved before or since, remaining proudly unassimilated, steeped in rabbinical learning and piety, yet standing high in the Prince's court. Potemkin promoted Zeitlin to 'court counsellor' with a title of nobility. Russian Jews called him 'HaSar Zeitlin' (lord Zeitlin).\\" After discussions with Zeitlin and his perambulant rabbis about the fighting prowess of the Biblical Israelites, the Prince decided to arm the Jews. Potemkin had raised a Jewish cavalry squadron on his estate, and when the Russo-Turkish war started, he wanted to liberate Constantinople for the Orthodox Church; he supported the idea of helping the Jews liberate Jerusalem. Then Potemkin founded the Israelovsky Regiment of Jewish Cossacks. The Jewish Cossacks were commanded by a German, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick. The Prince de Ligne, doyen of 18th-century cosmopolitanism and a philo‚ÄîSemite wrote: 'Prince Potemkin formed the singular project of raising a regiment of Jews,' he wrote to his master, the Habsburg emperor Joseph II. 'He intends to make Cossacks of them. Nothing amused me more.' Soon two squadrons of Jewish Cossacks were on patrol against the Turks, but Ligne claimed that they were not a success. After seven months' training, he sadly decided to end his rare experiment. This matter remains controversial, since no documents to corroborate the Potemkin regiment are present in the State Military Archive in Moscow. It has been suggested that some of the Jewish Cossacks followed Colonel Berek Joselewicz and joined Napoleon's Polish cavalry formations. Joselewicz was killed in a night ambush by the Hungarians during Napoleon's 1809 campaign. It has been suggested that there were veterans of the Potemkin's regiment fighting for the Emperor at some of his most celebrated victories. Jewish Polish Cossacks The great Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz (who was a descendant of a Frankist family) helped to form another regiment of Jewish Cossacks, Hussars of Israel, to fight against the Russian Empire, alongside Britain, France and Turkey, in the Crimean War. These lancers fought alongside dissident Cossacks against the Russians outside Sevastopol. Civil War in Russia During the Civil War (1918‚Äì1920) that ensued after the Russian Revolution of 1917 many Jews served both in the Red Cossacks (–ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–µ –ö–∞–∑–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ), cavalry regiments of the Red Army, and in the White Cossacks. One such regiment of Red Cossacks in the Kotovsky Brigade was commanded by the anarchist Sholom Schwartzbard. On the other hand, Jewish students also played an important role in the battalion of White Don Cossacks led by Vasily Chernetsov, so that a whole regiment of the battalion was called the ‚ÄúJewish Legion‚Äù. The Chernetsov Cossacks (Chernetsovtsy) gained prominence by initiating armed resistance against Bolsheviks in the Don area.http://slavakazakam.ru/donarm5?start=12 White Cossack Resistance against Bolsheviks ReferencesSources * –ï–≤—Ä–µ–∏-–∫–∞–∑–∞–∫–∏ –≤ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–µ XVII –≤. // –ö–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∞. ‚Äì 1890. ‚Äì ‚Ññ 5. ‚Äì –°. 377-379. * Iokhvodova, A. \\"Jewish Zaporozhians and the Hadjibey Fortress\\" Vestnik * Borovoy, S. ¬´–ï–≤—Ä–µ–∏ –≤ –ó–∞–ø–æ—Ä–æ–∂—Å–∫–æ–π –°–µ—á–∏ (–ø–æ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–∞–º —Å–µ—á–µ–≤–æ–≥–æ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏–≤–∞)¬ª (¬´–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫¬ª, –õ., 1934, —Ç. 1) * Kostomarov, M.

Starting 14 May at St. Johns, Newfoundland, these activities threatened merchantmen as far as St. Lucia in the West Indies. Marabout, a coastal minesweeper, had the mission of ensuring safe passage to Allied shipping through the entrances of the ports.  Reassigned to the 5th Naval District  On 13 June, Marabout was assigned to the 5th Naval District, where mines laid by , 12 June, sank a tanker, a trawler, and a coal barge; and damaged another tanker and destroyer . Joining ServRon 5 in the fall, she supported units of the Fleet Operation Training Command, in particular task group TG 23.1, until ordered to New London, Connecticut, 7 November 1944, for duty under ComSubLant. There, for the next year and a half, she performed widely varied duties including radar jamming and sonar operations with other Naval and Coast Guard units in the area and at the Submarine School.  Deactivation  On 16 May 1946, she steamed for Boston, where she decommissioned on 29 May. Transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal, she was sold to the City of Boston, 31 July for service as a fireboat.

At the core of this approach is the practice of listening to children's mathematical thinking and using it as a basis for instruction. Research based frameworks of children's thinking in the domains of addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, base-ten concepts, multidigit operations, algebra, geometry and fractions provide guidance to teachers about listening to their students. Case studies of teachers using CGI have shown the most accomplished teachers use a variety of practices to extend children's mathematical thinking. It's a tenet of CGI that there is no one way to implement the approach and that teachers' professional judgment is central to making decisions about how to use information about children's thinking. The research base on children' mathematical thinking upon which CGI is based shows that children are able to solve problems without direct instruction by drawing upon informal knowledge of everyday situations. For example, a study of kindergarten childrenCarpenter, et al., 1993 showed that young children can solve problems involving what are normally considered advanced mathematics such as multiplication, division, and multistep problems, by using direct modeling. Direct modeling is an approach to problem solving in which the child, in the absence of more sophisticated knowledge of mathematics, constructs a solution to a story problem by modeling the action or structure. For example, about half of the children in a study of kindergartners' problem solving were able to solve this multistep problem, which they had never seen before, using direct modeling: 19 children are taking a mini-bus to the zoo. They will have to sit either 2 or 3 to a seat. The bus has 7 seats. How many children will have to sit three to a seat, and how many can sit two to a seat? :Example: Fred had six marbles at school. On the way home from school his friend Joey gave him some more marbles. Now Fred has eleven marbles. How many marbles did Joey give to Fred? Students may solve this problem by counting down from eleven or by counting up from six. With the use of manipulatives students would be able to represent their thoughts for this problem multiple ways. For instance, they might make a row of six counting blocks next to a row of eleven counting blocks and then compare the difference. The CGI philosophy is detailed in Children's Mathematics which is co-authored by Thomas Carpenter, Elizabeth Fennema, Megan Loef Franke, Linda Levi, and Susan Empson. References ;Notes *Carpenter, T.

Hiebert is credited with building Alaska's first television station, KTVA in Anchorage in 1953. He is often called the \\"father of Alaskan television.\\" Early life Augie Hiebert was born in Trinidad, Washington. Fascinated with electronics as a teenager, he built his first amateur radio in Bend, Oregon, when he was only 15. He landed his first job in Wenatchee, Washington, at a radio station after graduating from high school. He worked his way up from an announcer to a station engineer at another radio station in Bend.  Alaskan television and radio = Alaskan radio  In 1939, Hiebert followed one of his Bend, Oregon, co-workers, Austin E. \\"Cap\\" Lathrop, to Fairbanks, Alaska, where they built the city's first radio station, KFAR. On December 7, 1941, Heibert, at his KFAR radio station in Fairbanks, was the first Alaskan to hear the news of the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor. He alerted the military.John Strohmeyer, Historic Anchorage: An Illustrated History (HPN Books, 2001), 127. Accessed 11 December 2012. Hiebert helped to set up KENI, another AM station, in Anchorage in 1948. Additionally, Hiebert established Alaska's first FM radio station, KNIK, in Anchorage in 1960. Hiebert's first Satellite AM radio station was KBYR programmed and formatted by Broadcasters Hall Of Fame Inductee Rod Williams.  Alaskan television  Augie Hiebert founded Northern Television, an Alaska-based production and broadcasting company. Hiebert and his small company would help found many of Alaska's original television station. (Hiebert sold Northern Television in 1997.) In 1953 Hiebert and his company built Alaska's first television station, KTVA, in Anchorage. The station initially offered local news, as well as some television programs and feature films. KTVA only broadcast for a few hours a day in its early years. All of its network programming had to be physically flown in as film or kinescope from the mainland United States, since there were no satellite broadcasting or nearby antenna broadcasts available in Alaska in those days. In 1955, just two years after launching KTVA, Hiebert founded KTVF, Alaska's second television station, in Fairbanks. Hiebert worked behind the scenes to bring live coverage of Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon on July 20, 1969. The lunar live coverage was a coup for Hiebert and Alaska, since live coverage of events usually had to be pre-taped and shipped to the state in the late 1960s. Hiebert and other station owners negotiated with the U.S. military and the Alaskan congressional delegation to bring a live satellite feed of the landing to Alaska.\\"Augie Hiebert, 90; broadcaster built first Alaska TV station,\\" LA Times, September 17, 2007. Accessed 11 December 2012. Hiebert was advocate for the special needs of Alaska's broadcasters. He organized 'Alaska Days' for Federal Communications Commission to educate members about the difficulties of broadcasting in a vast and sparsely populated state such as Alaska.  Retirement  Hiebert retired in 1997 at the age of 80 and sold his company, Northern Television the same year. However, he continued to be active in broadcasting after his retirement. He focused much of his energy on establishing a video-news program for Mirror Lake Middle School. He also worked with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to get Mirror Lake's FM radio station, KAUG, federally licensed. KAUG was the first middle school radio station in the United States to be licensed by the FCC. In 2003, Heibert was commended by the U.S. Senate for his service to the Alaska Communications industry.Senate Resolution 186, June 27, 2003. thomas.loc. gov. Accessed 11 December 2012.

Kropp achieved popular acclaim after the publication of his third and fourth novels One Hundred Times to China and Greencastle. Greencastle was nominated for a Penn/Faulkner Award and was named to one of the American Library Association's \\"Best Books of the Year\\" lists in 1985. For this novel the author received the \\"Illinois Author of the Year\\" award from the Illinois Association of Teachers of English (IATE). His books have been favorably reviewed in many journals and newspapers in the United States, Great Britain, and Spain. Career Kropp was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan and attended both the University of Pittsburgh and Ohio State University. His first short story was published in a university magazine and he also published poems and critical essays in a small-press journals. Never very prolific as a writer of short stories, Kropp developed an early discipline for the novel form. His first novel, The Drift, was published in hardcover in 1969 (Doubleday) and in another hardcover edition in Great Britain (Victor Gollancz) and enjoyed mass market paperback reprints in 1971 (Belmont Books) and 1979 (Leisure Books). The story is a fantasy based on an old nautical legend about an island made of derelict ships floating in the Sargasso Sea. For the denizens of the island, land is only a legend. Kropp's second novel, Who Is Mary Stark?, was published in hardcover (Doubleday) in 1974 and in paperback (Avon) in 1980. In Madrid it was republished by Martinez-Roca translated into Spanish. The plot of Who Is Mary Stark? centers around a mysterious woman who commits suicide in a mental hospital and the subsequent attempt of two young men to discover what part she played in their respective lives years earlier. Instead of moving chronologically, the novel moves in reverse toward the secret of the woman's identity. Who Is Mary Stark? garnered many positive reviews in journals and newspapers across the United States. Kropp's 1979 opus, One Hundred Times to China was also published by Doubleday and became a staple of many American high schools' required reading lists. Although not a novel targeted toward young adults, the book was very popular with a generation of literate young readers throughout the 1980s and 1990s. This post-apocalyptic tale of a man trying to shepherd his wife and children to the safety of a secret mountain cabin resonates with Kropp's impeccably crafted tension and trademark gentleness, with a focus on humanity's better angels. In 1987 Kropp published Greencastle (Freundlich Books), the award-winning novel for which he is best known. A lyrical coming-of-age story set in the early 1950s, Greencastle tells the tale of three boys who love mystery and science fiction. Roger, the protagonist, organizes a club called The Denizens of the Sacred Crypt. He finds that in his small, conservative New Jersey town, he must face down bigotry, class-struggles, teen-age cruelty, and serious misunderstandings at the hands of his school teachers. In spite of some strange and unsettling events, Greencastle is a nostalgic look at a lost world. In the late 1960s Lloyd Kropp taught for two years at Otterbein College. From 1970 to 1975 He taught in the Creative Writing program at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro where he also taught American Literature, Victorian Literature, and a course of his own design in fantasy and science fiction. In 1975 he joined the English faculty at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville where he taught until he retired as a senior professor in 2002. While at SIUE he taught a wide range of courses: fiction and poetry writing, The American Novel, Shakespeare, American Literature, Victorian Literature, Classical Mythology, Literary Criticism, Literary Editing, Egyptian Hieroglyphs, summer seminars in Creativity and Composition for high school teachers, and courses in music and writing for psychotic adolescents at the Alton Mental Health Clinic. His formal academic specialty was in Literary Theory. During his years teaching at SIUE he won a Distinguished Performance Award from the School of Humanities and was twice nominated for the Distinguished Teaching Award. Other projects Kropp is also an accomplished musician and composer. In addition to his concert work, he composed the background score for Lawrence Lee's The American as Faust, which was performed in concert in Pittsburgh and also broadcast on Public Television. Recent At the present time (2007) Kropp lectures around the country, most recently at the Archon (convention) in Collinsville, Illinois where he gave a presentation on \\"Ancient Egypt: an Alien Mind.\\" At the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities at the University of Toronto, Kropp lectured on \\"How Does a Story Mean?: Narrative Structure in an Ancient Egyptian Tale.\\" His fourth novel, Greencastle, is currently in development with a major motion picture company. He has written two additional novels, The Book of Thoth and Lady of the Lake, both of which are currently in submission. His current project is The Devil at Simon Episcopus, the story of a brutal murder at a conservative Christian college somewhere in the Midwest. Kropp is still composing music and working as a cafe pianist at Nerudas in Edwardsville, Illinois. He is married to Dr. Carolyn Kropp, a former dancer and teacher at the English Department at SIUE. They have two children. Bibliography * The Drift (1969) * Who Is Mary Stark (1974) * One Hundred Times to China (1979) * Greencastle (1987) Quotes \\"Writing is a lonely profession.

Thornton Charles Inglis Thornton (20 March 1850 - 10 December 1929), nicknamed \\"Buns\\", was an English cricketer who played more than 200 first- class matches in the later 19th century, for no fewer than 22 different teams. He was also the founder of the Scarborough Festival. Thornton was born in Llanwarne, Herefordshire, the son of the Rural Dean of Hereford. He was orphaned before the age of five. and adopted, along with his brother, by Archdeacon Harrison of Canterbury. This is where he began to play cricket playing with children in the neighbourhood in informal single wicket competitions. He played his first organised game at Great Mongeham in 1861 making 22 not out. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. His career at Eton was slow to win approval. The master in charge of cricket, Fred Bell, did not like his attacking play. Thornton remarked that it was because he hit all the best balls into the trees.Cricketer ibid He had success in both Eton v Harrow and Oxford v Cambridge matches, then very much part of the London season. He must have had independent means because on graduation he was able to rent a hunting box in Oxford with his cousin, hunting three days a week and playing cricket the other four.Cricketer ibid He was considered one of the biggest hitters in cricket, with one shot at Hove in 1876 claimed to have exceeded 160 yards. He hit the ball over the pavilion at Lord‚Äôs in the 1868 Eton v Harrow match. This, however was over the old pavilion. The only person to have struck a ball over the current pavilion (built 1889-90) is AE Trott.Cricketer ibid Other claims made by Thornton included a 156 yard hit at Ranelagh, a 152 yard hit at Canterbury and a 136 yard hit at Scarborough, the ball landing in Trafalgar Square (Scarborough).Cricketer ibid Thornton founded the Orleans Club which was active for ten years from 1878.ACS, p.26. His own private team -- C. I. Thornton's XI -- played most of their early games at Fenner's, but after his retirement from playing in 1897 their home became Scarborough, where they continued to play first-class cricket until 1929, the year of Thornton's death. He died aged 79 in Marylebone, London. Thornton had some interesting ideas about cricket. He wanted bowlers‚Äô run ups limited to 10 yards, and the wearing of leg guards (pads) to be forbidden. The only protection he advocated was football style shin pads.Cricketer ibid ReferencesBibliography * External links * Category:1850 births Category:1929 deaths Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:English cricketers Category:Kent cricketers Category:Middlesex cricketers Category:Cambridge University cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Sportspeople from Herefordshire Category:Gentlemen of the South cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Orleans Club cricketers Category:North of the Thames v South of the Thames cricketers Category:Gentlemen cricketers Category:Gentlemen of England cricketers Category:C.

As the popularity of the game grew throughout the late-1970s and 1980s, it became referenced in popular culture more frequently. The complement of games, films and cultural references based on Dungeons & Dragons or similar fantasies, characters, and adventures became ubiquitous after the end of the 1970s. Dungeons & Dragons, and tabletop role-playing games in general, have exerted a deep and persistent impact on the development of all types of video games, from \\"first-person shooters to real-time strategy games and massively multiplayer online games\\", which in turn play a significant and ongoing role in modern popular culture. In online culture, the term dungeon has since come to mean a virtual location where people can meet and collaborate. Hence, multi-user dungeons emerged throughout the 1970s and 1980s as a form of social networks or a social virtual reality. By creating a means for players to assemble and explore an imaginary world, the Dungeons & Dragons rules provided a transition from fantasy literary settings, such as those of author J. R. R. Tolkien, to fully virtual worlds. Public figures who play or have played Dungeons & Dragons include comedians Stephen Colbert and Chris Hardwick, musician Moby, and actors Vin Diesel, Matthew Lillard, Joe Manganiello, Mike Myers, Patton Oswalt, Wil Wheaton, and Robin Williams. Literature= Books  Independent fiction derived from the Dungeons & Dragons game appeared with the Endless Quest series of books, published by TSR, Inc between 1982 and 1987. The Endless Quest books provided a form of interactive fiction in the style of the Choose Your Own Adventure series. The continuing success of Dungeons & Dragons then sparked an even more extensive series of novels, also published by TSR, Inc. The first of these were based upon the Dragonlance campaign setting, and were released in 1984. There proved to be a lucrative market for these works, and by the 2000s a significant portion of all fantasy paperbacks were being published by Wizards of the Coast, the American game company that acquired TSR, Inc in 1997. The impact of Dungeons & Dragons on players and culture has inspired reflective non-fiction works: * Fantasy Freaks and Gaming Geeks: An Epic Quest for Reality Among Role Players, Online Gamers, and Other Dwellers of Imaginary Realms, by journalist and gamer Ethan Gilsdorf; a travel memoir about Dungeons & Dragons, role-playing games, and other fantasy and gaming subcultures. * The Elfish Gene: Dungeons, Dragons and Growing Up Strange, by novelist Mark Barrowcliffe; a memoir of playing Dungeons & Dragons and other role playing games in the 1970s. * Author Shelly Mazzanoble wrote a humorous self-help guide called Everything I Need to Know I Learned from Dungeons & Dragons: One Woman's Quest to Trade Self-help for Elf- help. This followed her guide book, Confessions of a Part-time Sorceress: A Girl's Guide to the Dungeons & Dragons Game. * American Nerd: The Story of My People is Time magazine writer Benjamin Nugent's study of the history and culture of people labeled nerds. It includes insights into why people play and enjoy Dungeons & Dragons. Several characters created for playing Dungeons & Dragons, or games derived from Dungeons & Dragons, have later spawned popular fantasy series. Other novels make off-hand references to the game:  Comics  Begun in 1986, the comic books The Adventurers and Redfox were inspired by Dungeons & Dragons. Several commercial comic strips are based entirely upon the game or make reference to the game in specific panels. * Knights of the Dinner Table is a multiple award-winning comic-sized magazine featuring comic strips with a variety of characters who play \\"HackMaster,\\" a parody of Dungeons & Dragons. (HackMaster would later go on to become an actual role- playing game.) Early strips appeared in the official Dungeons & Dragons magazine Dragon. * The Order of the Stick is an award-winning satirical webcomic that features a cast of characters in a world that loosely operates by the rules of Dungeons & Dragons. * Penny Arcade, A longstanding webcomic, created by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik, references and even depicts humorous instances of bizarre campaigns, and other Dungeons & Dragons subject matter; implementing dice-rolling humor and other game dynamics. Visual media= Film  Several films include instances of characters playing the game of Dungeons & Dragons. There have also been three feature films released that were based upon the game: Dungeons & Dragons (2000), Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God (2005), and Dungeons & Dragons: The Book of Vile Darkness (2012). As of 2019, Paramount Pictures, RatPac-Dune Entertainment, Sweetpea Entertainment, Vertigo Entertainment, Hasbro Studios and Allspark Pictures are currently developing a new Dungeons & Dragons film scheduled for release on July 23, 2021. The film was reportedly star Ansel Elgort and be directed by Rob Letterman. Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley are in talks to direct the film after Chris McKay was going to direct the film. * In scene 2 of Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra Terrestrial, the character Elliott, his older brother, and his friends are shown playing Dungeons & Dragons. Prior to the production of the film, Spielberg ran a Dungeons & Dragons session with the young cast members. * The Futurama film Bender's Game includes Dungeons & Dragons as a crucial plot device, in which the main characters end up in a fantasy realm after the game is played. The film was already in production upon Gygax's death and debuted later that year, so it was dedicated in his honor. The film included parodies of Dungeons & Dragons- influenced films. * The short film Fear of Girls is a spoof of two heavy Dungeons & Dragons gamers. The filmmakers used viral marketing to attract attention to the film. * The films The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising by the Dead Gentlemen are parodies of Dungeons & Dragons.  Television  The CBS network ran a Saturday morning cartoon series called Dungeons & Dragons, in which a group of teenagers visiting a Dungeons and Dragons-themed theme park dark ride are magically transported into the fantasy world of Dungeons and Dragons. The show included the voice talents of Willie Aames of Eight is Enough, and ran from 1983 to 1985.

Internet *On March 13, 2015, the first episode of Critical Role aired. Critical Role is a live show which uses Twitch to stream their game of D&D.; Voice actor Matthew Mercer leads a group of several other fellow voice actors through D&D.; So far, over two hundred episodes have been produced. Initially, episodes would be streamed live and then uploaded onto the Geek & Sundry website. On June 18, 2018, Critical Role announced their departure from Geek & Sundry, forming their own company. The group also started a Kickstarter in March 2019, raising over US$11 million in order to fund the first campaign of the group being turned into an animated series. This broke the previous record for the most-funded TV or film project on the crowdfunding website. The animated series was later picked up by Amazon, resulting in a second season being ordered. The first season is currently planned to be released in late 2020. Audio media= Music  Dungeons & Dragons is referenced in popular music: * Flashlight Brown's song \\"Ready to Roll\\" is a veiled reference to a group playing Dungeons & Dragons. * Owen Pallett's album He Poos Clouds is roughly based on the concept of the eight schools of magic from Dungeons & Dragons. * Stephen Lynch has a comedic song titled \\"D&D;\\" on his album Superhero. * Weezer's song \\"In The Garage\\" mentions the Dungeon Master's Guide and a twelve-sided die, among other nerdy elements. *Jumpsteady's song from the album \\"Master of the Flying Guillotine\\", \\"Dungeon Master\\" references the game.  Podcast  * A special episode of the McElroy Brothers' flagship podcast My Brother, My Brother and Me called \\"The Adventure Zone\\" was released on August 18, 2014. It featured the brothers playing a game of Dungeons & Dragons with their father, Clint. \\"The Adventure Zone\\" was later developed into its own podcast on the Maximum Fun network. Interactive media Dungeons & Dragons is referenced in popular video games: * Borderlands 2 downloadable content Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep involves Tiny Tina serving as a game master of Bunkers and Badasses, the \\"Borderlands version of Dungeons & Dragons\\". * Canadian video game designer and developer merritt k created the 2015 Twine game (ASMR) Vin Diesel DMing a Game of D&D; Just For You based on American actor Vin Diesel's D&D; fandom. * In Life Is Strange: Before the Storm, there is a part where the player can choose the option for the main character Chloe to join in on a D&D; campaign.  Players  Stephen Colbert developed an intense interest in the game during his youth, which he later credited for his talent at character creation. Ethan Gilsdorf credited the game for bestowing upon him \\"gifts of creativity and self-actualization\\". Actor Vin Diesel, in his introduction to the book Thirty Years of Adventure, wrote that he was \\"attracted to the artistic outlet the game provided\\" and that the game was \\"a training ground for our imagination and an opportunity to explore our own identities\\". Vin Diesel, Mike Myers, and Robin Williams also participated in the 2006 Worldwide Dungeons & Dragons Game Day, demonstrating that the game was then still a lively and active hobby. Director Chris Weitz pointed out that there \\"are a lot of people who played and are horribly embarrassed about it and won't admit it, because it's part of their lives they put behind\\". He developed a fervent interest in the game, even greater than in making movies, and said the experience \\"had such an influence on his life\\". Director Jon Favreau was drawn into the game by the fantasy elements and the sense of story, saying \\"it gave me a really strong background in imagination, storytelling, understanding how to create tone and a sense of balance\\". Political reporter John J. Miller said that Dungeons & Dragons was a big part of his life during his school years, and argued that, \\"there's a lot to admire about D&D; and what it can do for kids by encouraging them to read, do math, and think creatively\\". Fantasy author China Mi√©ville said that playing Dungeons & Dragons as a youth was one of the most enduring influences on his writing. The two things that particularly influenced him were \\"the mania for cataloging the fantastic\\" and \\"the weird fetish for systematization\\", in that everything is reduced to \\"game stats\\". In contrast, author Mark Barrowcliffe considers his years playing Dungeons & Dragons to be a wasted youth and all of the players to be nerds. He has tried to put the experience behind him.

Biography=Early life and career Comber was born in New Plymouth in 1939. He received his education at St Joseph's Convent, New Plymouth Boys' High School, and Victoria University. He married Diane Holyoake, a daughter of Sir Keith Holyoake, in 1966, and they had three children together. He was a senior rugby player, representing North Island Universities as a student, and was later a member of the Wellington Rugby Football Union's management committee. He trained as an accountant and was chief accountant for National Electric (1969‚Äì1972), and then general manager of John H. Walker and Co. Ltd (1972‚Äì1973). Political career Comber joined the National Party in 1967 and was the secretary of the Wellington Branch (1970‚Äì1972). Holyoake \\"neither encouraged nor discouraged\\" Comber in his decision to seek the National nomination for Wellington Central when Dan Riddiford announced his retirement. Comber felt his father-in-law hadn't given him much chance of beating local lawyer Barry Brill for the candidacy, but he prevailed. After a closely fought campaign, he trailed Labour candidate David Shand on election night by 51 votes but 12 days later after special votes were counted Comber overturned Shand's majority by 27 votes giving him the ironical nickname 'Landslide' in Parliament. Despite the closeness of the result there was no hint of animosity between the two candidates and when he heard he had won Comber said he genuinely felt for his opponent. He represented the electorate in Parliament from to 1981, when he was defeated by Labour's Fran Wilde. In the Muldoon cabinet, he was under- secretary for Internal Affairs, Local Government, Recreation and Sport, Civil Defence, and Arts. As an under-secretary he promoted physical fitness among MPs and encouraged flag-flying in workplaces to promote a sense of national pride. A conservative on most issues, Comber staunchly defended Muldoon's refusal to intervene on the issue of sporting contacts with South Africa. As he represented a well educated urban electorate this put him out of step with his liberally minded constituents, and contributed to his loss at the following the divisive Springbok tour earlier that year. In 1977, Comber was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1990 he received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. He made two attempts to win the centre-right Citizens' Association nomination to run for Mayor of Wellington. In 1992 he was successful, beating, the Citizens' leader on the council Les Stephens, Eastern Ward councillor Ruth Gotlieb, former councillor Bryan Weyburne and former mayor Ian Lawrence. Comber's win was labeled a surprise by the media. The mayoralty race pitted him against Wilde in a \\"grudge match\\" repeat of 1981. Comber finished third with 15% of the vote to Wilde's 33%. Later life and death In 1991 he was appointed chairman of the New Zealand Fire Service, holding the position until 1996 when he became commissioner. In 1997 he was replaced by Roger Estall and Comber publicly opposed the appointment of Estall as his successor (which he first learned of over the radio news). He went as far as to resign from the National Party, to which he had belonged for 30 years, in protest calling the party \\"morally bankrupt\\" and glad that Holyoake was not alive to see the state of his old party. Comber said his disillusionment with National started in 1991, when it reneged on its pledge to scrap the superannuation surcharge, but was also disappointed by Prime Minister Jim Bolger's decision not to fully endorse Mark Thomas, National's Wellington Central candidate at the . Comber died of cancer in Wellington on 6 December 1998, survived by his wife, two daughters and son.

Pleasure Point The Pleasure Point Night Fighters were the first to use the name Pleasure Point. This designation is used to define the surfing community on Soquel Point in the county of Santa Cruz. It is defined by Moran Lagoon, Portola Dr, 41st Ave and the Pacific Ocean. The Prohibition era During the time of Prohibition (1919 to 1933), the Pleasure Point, Santa Cruz, California community was not served by the Santa Cruz City Fire Department after dark. In response to this lack of fire service in the night time, a group of volunteer's organized to fill this need. The Pleasure Point Night Fighters began as a volunteer fire fighters organization. They helped to fight many fires that were started by drunken revelers who came to this remote area between Santa Cruz and Capitola during Prohibition. PPNF was also renowned as a vigilante organization that kept the peace in unincorporated area of Pleasure Point. The people who were at the mercy of those who came into the area turned to this local organization for protection. The rumors of the many valiant actions and the heroes of this time are still told among the older members of Pleasure Point surfing community. WWII During World War II, many of the members joined the service to protect the USA from the greater world threat and their activities were suspended. 1950s The PPNF was revived in the 1950s when \\"Pleasure Point Night Fighters\\" became the call to arms and rebel yell for the locals. Jim Phillips, world-renowned for his surf art and contributions to surf culture, designed the PPNF calling cards. He and Harry Conti, reincarnated the Night Fighters in the 1970s.

It was the palace where the erstwhile ruler of Hyderabad State, Sir Mir Osman Ali Khan, lived.  Etymology  Initially, Kamal Khan constructed this palace for his personal residence: Thus, the main gate, passerby corridors, windows and doors were engraved with the sign of \\"KK\\". Later when Nizam purchased this palace, the young Nizam felt against his pride to have the abbreviations of other nawabs; he passed a firman and changed the abbreviation \\"KK\\" to \\"King Kothi,\\" meaning king's mansion. Thus the name King Kothi came into existence. History The palace was constructed by Kamal Khan, and sold to Nizam once he expressed his desire for the palace. The young Nizam moved in when he was only 13. After his accession to the throne in 1911, he continued to stay at the palace and did not move to Chowmahalla Palace where his father lived. In the sprawling palace, various kinds of expensive items were stored in steel trunks, fastened with English-made padlocks.The treasure at King Kothi Palace The palace has three main buildings, divided into two groups. It also has a huge library used by the last Nizam. The eastern half, now occupied by a state government hospital, was used by the Nizam for official and ceremonial purposes. The western half, which is now walled, has the main residential buildings known as Nazri Bagh or Mubarak Mansion and still belongs to the Nizam‚Äôs private estate.Soldiers from the Nizam's army guarding the Purdah gate of the King Kothi palace The main entrance to Nazri Bagh always had a curtain draped across it, so it has come to be known as the purdah gate. When Nizam went out of the palace, the purdah was lifted to indicate the king was not home. The gate was guarded by Maisaram Regiment, police and Sarf-e-Khas Army bearing lances.The King Kothi Palace The Nizam lived here until his death in 1967.  Architecture  The palace is marked by large arched entrances and columns, intricate woodwork on canopied windows, and a large portico at the entrance. Present status Of the three principal buildings of the King Kothi complex, only the main building (now housing a hospital) and the Mubarak Mansion (Nazri Bagh) accommodating the offices of the Nizam‚Äôs private estates (Sarf E Khas) survive. Both the surviving buildings are in European style.Present status of the King Kothi Palace The third building, Usman Mansion, was demolished in the early 1980s. In its place a new hospital building was constructed by the state government. The VII Nizam, Sir Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last ruling Nizam (1911‚Äì1948), lived here and died in this building on 24 February 1967. The palace is also home to the Judi Mosque. Khan willed that he be buried in the mosque that faced his residence. To the east of Mubarak Mansion stands the Ghadial Gate, the gate with a clock. The King Kothi complex has various European styles. The canopies over windows, the intricate woodwork, the sloping tiled roofs in octagonal pyramid shapes of the Ghadial Gate complex, and the classical semicircular arches are among the characteristic features.

It is located at the corner of South Avenue (NY 9D) and East Main Street in the village of Wappingers Falls, Dutchess County, New York. History It was originally built in 1940 as the village's new post office, a Works Progress Administration project. President Franklin D. Roosevelt took a personal interest in the project, as he already had with new post offices in other Dutchess County communities. He wanted it to be built of fieldstone in the style of many Dutch colonial houses in the Hudson Valley, and chose the Brewer-Mesier House in the village as the model for its design. R. Stanley Miller, a local architect who had already designed the similar Rhinebeck post office, was assigned the job. Note: This includes and Accompanying five photographs In 1989, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It had already been a contributing property to the Wappingers Falls Historic District, added to the Register five years earlier. The U.S. Postal Service has since had to move to a larger building a few blocks away on East Main. The village moved most of its functions here and built a new wing ‚Äî clapboard, not stone, but otherwise consistent with the original design ‚Äî on the rear of the building to house its police department. Murals The old post office, now police station contains two Treasury Section of Fine Arts murals by Henry Billings. The paintings by Henry Billings show two views of the town's waterfall at different points in time. The building itself is walking distance from the actual waterfall. The murals are painted on chestnut panels and fill the triangular space where the ceiling of the building is pitched. The two views, one from 1780 and the other from 1880, face each other from opposite ends of the small building. The 1780 picture was inspired by the diary of the Marquis de Chastellux, who is shown in conversation with Peter Mesier, whose house the post office was modeled after. The 1880 scene was taken from an old painting of the falls when they were a major industrial water power source.\\"Living New Deal\\", Department of Geography, Univ. of California, Berkeley See also *Wappingers Falls Historic District :Other area post office buildings whose design Roosevelt influenced: *U.S. Post Office (Beacon, New York) *U.S. Post Office (Ellenville, New York) *U.S. Post Office (Hyde Park, New York) *U.S. Post Office (Poughkeepsie, New York) *U.S. Post Office (Rhinebeck, New York) References Category:Former post office buildings Category:Village halls in the United States Category:Works Progress Administration in New York (state) Category:Government buildings completed in 1940 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Dutchess County, New York Category:Post office buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Historic district contributing properties in New York (state) Category:Individually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in New York (state) Category:Presidency of Franklin D.

Because most now use GPS, aircraft track flight routes with extremely high accuracy. As a result, if an error in height occurs, there is a much higher chance of collision. SLOP allows aircraft to offset the centreline of an airway or flight route by a small amount, normally to the right, so that collision with opposite direction aircraft becomes unlikely. In the North Atlantic Region pilots are expected to fly along the oceanic track center-line or 1 or 2 nautical miles to its right, randomly choosing one of these three offsets on each entry to oceanic airspace. The aim is to not achieve an overall even distribution of one-third of all flights on each of the three possible tracks, as one might assume. When the procedure was originally developed, 4.9 percent of aircraft in most oceans could not offset automatically, so the centerline had to remain as an option. Because of the possibility of opposite direction traffic on the centerline, it is the least desirable option, with the highest risk. The procedure lowers the overall risk of collision should an aircraft move vertically away from its assigned level. This randomization has the advantage over a planned assignment of offsets to each individual aircraft in that it mitigates the collision hazard for same-direction flights should an aircraft be erroneously flown along a track that was not assigned by ATC. SLOP is recommended for use in modern flight management system-based, RVSM (reduced vertical separation minima)-equipped aircraft operations to mitigate the midair collision hazard, which is amplified by the accuracy of modern aircraft navigational technology and onboard flight instruments. Lateral navigation (left‚Äìright) based on global positioning system (GPS), and RVSM quality altimetry (up‚Äìdown), are each so accurate in their own dimension that opposite-direction aircraft which are erroneously flying the same altitude on the same navigational path are very likely to collide. In addition to mitigating en route midair collision hazard, SLOP is used to reduce the probability of high-altitude wake turbulence encounters. During periods of low wind velocity aloft, aircraft which are spaced 1000 feet vertically but pass directly overhead in opposite directions can generate wake turbulence which may cause either injury to passengers/crew or undue structural airframe stress. This hazard is an unintended consequence of RVSM vertical spacing reductions which are designed to increase allowable air traffic density. Rates of closure for typical jet aircraft at cruise speed routinely exceed 900 knots. Wake turbulence is thought likely to be experienced by the lower of two aircraft when it arrives approximately 15‚Äì30 nm behind an opposite-direction aircraft which has crossed directly overhead on the same route. On 13 November 2015, ICAO published a revised version of Document 4444, Pans ATM Paragraph 16.5 that includes provisions for applying SLOP in a continental/domestic air space for aircraft that are capable of offsetting in tenths of a mile. Centerline is not an option as aircraft can offset up to one-half mile right of course, in tenths of a mile, providing 5 alternative offsets. In January 2017, the ICAO SPG (Authority for the NAT region) published updated guidance indicating that SLOP is now a requirement on the North Atlantic, rather than a recommendation.

Along with colleague William Aspley, Smethwick was one of the \\"junior partners\\"F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 170. in the publishing syndicate that issued the First Folio collection of Shakespeare's plays in 1623. As his title pages specify, his shop was \\"in St. Dunstan's Churchyard in Fleet Street, under the Dial.\\" Career He was the son of a London draper, and began a nine-year apprenticeship under a Thomas Newman at Christmas 1589 (though he was emancipated early by his master's widow). Like Aspley, Smethwick enjoyed a career of unusual longevity: he became a \\"freeman\\" (a full member) of the Stationers Company on 17 January 1597,Joseph Ames, Typographical Antiquities, London, 1790; Vol. 3, p. 1384. and continued in business for more than four decades. In the earlier phases of his career, Smethwick was repeatedly fined for selling books to which he lacked the rights; but in later years he rose to be successively Junior Warden (1631), Senior Warden (1635), and Master (1639) of the Stationers Company. For a portion of his career Smethwick was partnered with John Jaggard, the brother of William Jaggard, the printer of the First Folio.Halliday, p. 458. Shakespeare Smethwick's connection with the Shakespeare canon began in 1607: in an entry in the Stationers' Register dated 19 November that year, stationer Nicholas Ling transferred the copyrights of Romeo and Juliet, Love's Labor's Lost, and Hamlet to Smethwick. (At the same time, Smethwick acquired from Ling the rights to The Taming of a Shrew, the early alternative version of Shakespeare's The Shrew.) Two of these plays were subsequently published in quarto by Smethwick -- Romeo and Juliet in 1609 (the third quarto) and Hamlet in 1611 (also Q3).E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethn Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol 3, pp. 483, 487. Smethwick's possession of these copyrights eventually involved him in the First Folio project. When Edward Blount and William and Isaac Jaggard were preparing to print the Folio, c. 1620, they had to obtain the rights to eighteen plays that had already been printed. Two copyright holders, Aspley and Smethwick, chose to participate in the Folio project as partners with Blount and the Jaggards.Sonia Massai, Shakespeare and the Rise of the Editor, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2007. Again like Aspley, Smethwick retained his Shakespearean copyrights to join in Robert Allot's Second Folio in 1632. A few Shakespearean plays continued to be printed in quarto editions after 1623 -- and Smethwick was responsible for several of these late quartos. He issued the second quarto of Love's labor's Lost in 1631. He published the undated Q4 of Romeo and Juliet (1623?), and followed it with Q5 in 1637. In the same era he issued the undated Q4 of Hamlet (1625?) and the Q5 of 1637.R. Carter Hailey, \\"The Dating Game: New Evidence for the Dates of Q4 Romeo and Juliet and Q4 Hamlet,\\" Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 58 No. 3 (Fall 2007), pp. 367-87. Others Inevitably, Smethwick also published a large body of non- Shakespearean literature as well. Notably, he issued an important collection of the Poems of Michael Drayton, in seven editions from 1608 to 1637. He published Sir David Murray's The Tragical Death of Sophonisba and Coelia in 1611, and an edition of Thomas Lodge's Rosalynde: Euphues' Golden Legacy in 1612. He produced the second and third edition of Francis Beaumont's The Knight of the Burning Pestle (both 1635).

The Kremer K8 Spyder, along with its predecessor, the K7 (1992-1993), were open- cockpit prototypes built by Kremer Racing for use in multiple sportscar series, such as the IMSA GT Championship, Interserie, and International Sports Racing Series. The cars shared many components from the retired Porsche 962 and would eventually go on to win the 24 Hours of Daytona and several championships. Development=K7 During 1992, Kremer Racing had abandoned the World Sportscar Championship due to heavy costs brought on by the new engine formula which had gone into effect in 1991. The racing company therefore turned to the smaller Interserie championship, which continued to allow Kremer's 962CK6s to compete alongside a wide variety of machinery. However, teams in the Interserie at the time were opting more and more for open-cockpit Formula One or CART-based machines with bodywork attached to them for more downforce. This left the closed-cockpit prototypes like the 962CK6 at a disadvantage due to their heavier weight. Kremer Racing, as well as other teams in the series, chose to therefore turn their coup√©s into open-cockpit cars in an attempt to lower weight and increase speed. Kremer initially took one of their existing 962CK6s and began extensive modifications to the bodywork. The roof and windshield of the cockpit was removed, while the doors were replaced with new bodywork to surround the open cockpit. This bolstering of the side bodywork moved the driver to a more central position, similar to an open-wheel formula car. Because of the elimination of the doors, the large intakes on either side of the cockpit were also reshaped, with a large cut made to allow air to flow in from the side of the car. The engine cover was retained in order to give the driver rollover protection as well as to maintain some of the 962CK6's original aerodynamics. Underneath the bodywork, most of the mechanicals of the 962 were retained, including the Type-935 3.2 litre Flat-6 engine. These cars became known as the Kremer K7 Spyder, with at least two built specifically for Interserie use. K8 Following on the success of the K7s in Interserie use, Kremer saw the opportunity to adapt their design to the new open-cockpit formulas that were allowed in the IMSA GT Championship and at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Once again, the 962CK6s were used as a base, although some styling elements were changed between the CK7 and the new K8 Spyder in order to conform to the rules used in these events. The K8s would be required to maintain their two-seater layout as had been used on the 962CK6s. This meant that the large bodywork replacing the doors was replaced with a much lower design which incorporated a windshield. The rules also necessitated the addition of a rollbar to the top of the engine cover, to better protect a driver's head in the event of a rollover. Also, to meet engine requirements, Kremer chose to use a smaller variant of the Type-935 Flat-6, running only a 3.0 litre displacement. The large snorkels for feeding the turbochargers were also replaced with a more discreet inlet. Four K8 Spyders were built by Kremer. Racing history The initial K7 made its debut during the 1992 Interserie season. Running alongside an unmodified 962CK6, the K7 was able to perform well in its first event at the N√ºrburgring on 17 May, winning one heat and finishing second overall before going on to win the Brands Hatch event overall on July 26. The K7 would go on to take victories at Zolder Circuit and Autodrom Most, leading to Kremer Racing winning the team's championship and Manuel Reuter winning the driver's championship. For 1993, a second K7 would be completed, replacing the older 962CK6. The team would immediately show their dominance in the series, finishing in first and second place at Jarama. Both cars would have top three finishes for the rest of the season until the final round when a lone K7 would suffer problems and finish in seventh. With four wins on the season, Giovanni Lavaggi was able to win the driver's championship, but Kremer would ultimately finish second to S.C.I. in the team's championship. In 1994, Kremer concentrated solely on the development of the new K8 Spyder for its debut at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Backed by Gulf Oil sponsorship, the K8 Spyder would be the only open-cockpit car competing in the LMP1/C90 class. The design proved its speed by qualifying second on the grid alongside a Courage-Porsche. Driver's Derek Bell, Robin Donovan, and J√ºrgen L√§ssig would run towards the top of the field for most of the race, but eventually they finished the race in sixth, nearly thirty laps behind the winning Dauer 962. After Le Mans, Kremer Racing chose to prove the endurance capabilities of the K8 again by entering the car into the IMSA GT Championship debut event of the 1995 season, the 24 Hours of Daytona. Although the car did not qualify well, the driving team of Giovanni Lavaggi, J√ºrgen L√§ssig, Marco Werner, and Christophe Bouchut were eventually able to take the race victory by five laps over the nearest competitor. The team followed to the next event, the 12 Hours of Sebring, but the K8 suffered mechanical problems and finished a distant 30th place. The team therefore returned to Europe, where the second K8 was now completed and waiting competition. Both cars were entered in Le Mans once again. Now in a field full of open-cockpit prototypes, the K8s faced stiffer competition from the likes of Courage and the new custom-built Ferrari 333 SP. One K8 would muster only a fifth place qualifying spot, which the team was eventually able to turn into a sixth-place finish. The second car lacked pace for most of the race and eventually withdrew with electrical problems. After Le Mans, Kremer chose to finish the year in Interserie once again, using a CK7 in two of the final three rounds, earning themselves a sole victory. For 1996, Kremer began to concentrate more on the new BPR Global GT Series, running Porsche 911 GT2s. However, two K8 were once again brought out for Le Mans following slight evolutions to their bodywork. The age of the cars led to them slipping further down in qualifying, managing to only make 13th. During the race, both cars failed to finish: One due to an accident and the other suffering an engine failure. The team would perform even worse in 1997, when one of two cars failed to qualify for the race. The lone entry dropped out of the event in the first half with an engine failure. However, the K8 saw regular competition once again during 1997. The team would enter into the 1000km Monza victory for John Nielsen and Thomas Bscher. After Le Mans, the team would enter the new International Sports Racing Series. Two K8s would compete in the final round of the series' debut season, earning third and seventh places. For the next year, the two evolved cars would be entered in the full season. The season opener would see the best result for the K8 with a second place, with the team eventually finishing in eighth place in the team's championship. A lone K8 would also again be entered at Le Mans, where the evolved car was able to improve on its previous performances by finishing in 12th, yet second in the LMP1 class. 1999 would be the final year of competition for the K8 Spyders, as Kremer Racing purchased a new Lola B98/10 for use in the ISRS. However, before their Lola was completed, the team used a K8 in the first two rounds of the season and finishing ninth in one of the events. A second K8 was sold to the privateer Dutch team BPR Competition who had success early in the season, but eventually withdrew from the series.

AJOP was the first major Jewish Orthodox organization of its kind that was not affiliated with the Chabad Hasidic movement. Rabbis, rebbetzens, and activists in the field of \\"Jewish outreach\\" working in the various areas of Orthodox Jewish education are often referred to as \\"kiruv professionals\\" or \\"kiruv workers\\" as well as \\"kiruv volunteers\\" in the Orthodox community. AJOP as a response to the kiruv movement The growth of the Baal teshuva movement (\\"returnees\\" [to Orthodox Judaism]) that gained strides in the 1960s, went hand in hand with, and was often the result of, \\"kiruv\\" efforts (\\"kiruv\\" means \\"bringing close [to Judaism]\\") by rabbis and Orthodox Jews all over the world. The worldwide efforts of the Chabad Hasidic movement were guided by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson the leader of Chabad who encouraged many of his followers to leave the confines of Brooklyn and to set up synagogues and communities in non-Orthodox settings and to \\"mekarev\\" (\\"bring closer\\" [secular Jews to Judaism]) and to the Chabad-Lubavitch brand of Hasidism in particular. These Shluchim or Shlichim did the work of \\"outreach\\" that was meant to attract Baal teshuvas to Judaism. AVI CHAI Foundation founds AJOP With the passage of time there came the recognition that not only Chabad was doing this work but that many other rabbis and volunteers from all branches of the Orthodox, Haredi, and Hasidic world were involved in the same kind of \\"outreach\\" kiruv work. During the mid-1980s Sanford C. Bernstein the founder and director of the investment house Sanford C. Bernstein and Company had become a devoted follower of Rabbi Shlomo Riskin and decided to establish the AVI CHAI Foundation to research and help all manner of Jewish education and particularly Jewish outreach (\\"kiruv\\") if it met the criteria of his foundation (no opposition to Zionism and to accept the value of secular knowledge.) The AVI CHAI Foundation granted several million dollars each to both AJOP and to what was meant to be a \\"sister\\" effort the National Jewish Outreach Program (NJOP) and their similar sounding names were chosen deliberately and were meant to reinforce each other's work. While AJOP was geared to the \\"Outreach Professional\\" doing the \\"outreach\\" at the same time NJOP was directed at the non-Orthodox Jewish public who were to be offered a variety of introduction to Judaism programs. The first president of both organizations was Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald a foremost Modern Orthodox outreach rabbi who is also the head of outreach efforts at Lincoln Square Synagogue in Manhattan. AJOP founded in New York During its first decade AJOP was known as the Association for Jewish Outreach Professionals. Upon its founding in 1987, AJOP was based in Manhattan, New York City. The first director was Gerald Weisberg who was not a rabbi but an administrator in the public school system of New York. It was he who was given the initial mandate to build the organization. His first and most successful innovation was the annual AJOP convention, held in January, that has always attracted hundreds of Orthodox rabbis and their wives, some serving as pulpit rabbis and others as teachers and principals of Jewish day schools. A governing board of rabbis was chosen and the most prominent was Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg the rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Ner Yisroel who served as AJOP chief rabbinical advisor until the time of his death in 1999. AJOP's second president was Rabbi Shaya Milikowsky who was affiliated with the Yeshivas Ner Yisroel MAOR Institute training young rabbis to become \\"outreach professionals\\" as Rabbi Buchwald became AJOP's honorary president. Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald has served as AJOP's Honorary President during the entire lifespan of the organization. AJOP's second director was Rabbi Herschel Leiner. Rabbi Leiner was endorsed personally and publicly by Rabbi Avraham Yaakov Pam the rosh yeshiva of Yeshiva Torah Vodaas at one of AJOP's annual conventions. The appointment of Rabbi Milikowsky as President and Rabbi Leiner as Director was an indication that AJOP was officially moving in a more Haredi direction. Rabbi Leiner's tenure was brief as he went on to a leadership role in the Haredi yeshiva Sh'or Yoshuv that traditionally had a Baal teshuva student base. As the AVI CHAI Foundation announced that it would wind down funding for AJOP the decision was made to align with the National Council of Young Israel (NCYI) and a third director, Rabbi Shmuel Stauber was appointed. The alliance with the NCYI was brief but was soon followed by the organization's move of its main office outside of New York State by the end of the 1990s. AJOP based in Baltimore With the termination of funding from the AVI CHAI Foundation that had lasted close to a decade, the rabbinic leadership of AJOP decided to move its main headquarters to Baltimore, Maryland under its third president Rabbi Shlomo Porter. At this point AJOP was renamed the Association for Jewish Outreach Programs. Its two chief rabbinical authorities became Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetsky (the rosh yeshiva of the Talmudical Yeshiva of Philadelphia) and Rabbi Yaakov Perlow (the Rebbe of Novominsk.) The fourth and present director is Rabbi Yitzchok Lowenbraun. Having moved to Baltimore, active and wealthy lay members were added to the Board of Directors such as Richard Horowitz as Vice President among others. Functions of AJOP AJOP assists outreach professionals in their work through an array of organizational and productivity based initiatives and products, such as resource materials and books where Kiruv professionals worldwide unite to network, share resources, learn from experienced professionals in the field, and discuss issues. AJOP also distributes a weekly e-newsletter, containing reputable sources and publishers who share information such as Torah discourses, Halacha, inspirational stories, and recipes, and runs an online store which sells merchandise tailored for those in the field of Orthodox Jewish outreach. AJOPNET established in 1989 AJOP was an early pioneer in explaining the uses of computer networks as an outreach tool at its earliest conventions. At all its early annual conventions, beginning in 1989, Gerald Weisberg AJOP's founding executive director, promoted workshops that introduced participants to the concept of a Bulletin Board System via \\"AJOPNET\\". A Task Force on New Technology was headed by an AJOP founding trustee Rabbi Yaacov Haber who had discovered the efficacy of BitNet newsgroups in spreading the teaching of a weekly Torah portion. Rabbi Haber as chairman of the task force spoke highly of his ability to reach people from his outpost as a community rabbi in far-off Buffalo, New York. In an AJOP newsletter, dated May‚ÄìJune 1989 the new technology is described as follows: :Task Force on New Technology TFNT) :AJOPNET Your Personal Outreach Resource Center :...Would you like to share a program that you have developed that is very effective with the rest of the kiruv community...Communicate with one person or the entire outreach community? AJOPNET can provide all of the above and more at almost no cost... AJOPNET uses a technology called \\"electronic mail,\\" which allows each user to send messages back and forth to AJOP and each other through and international computer network... Contact us today if you would like to participate... The only equipment that is required is a personal computer of any kind equipped with a modem... :...Get \\"on line\\" for AJOPNET. (Installation of the modem, software, and on-site training is available through AJOP...) Although originally constituted as a Bulletin Board System, Rabbi Yaakov Menken of Project Genesis prevailed upon AJOP to relaunch AJOPNET as an Electronic mailing list under his direction. Rabbi Menken presented his pioneering work at AJOP's early annual conventions, as was recognized by Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein another of AJOP's founding trustees. The project was ahead of times, and it would be another decade before use of the Internet for Jewish outreach would become widespread through sites such as Chabad.org, Torah.org and Aish.com. Connection with Haredi Judaism While AJOP's founders, such as Sanford Bernstein, Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald and Gerald Weisberg were firmly rooted in the Modern Orthodox world, AJOP's membership has been heavily drawn from the mostly Haredi world. The Haredi dominance of AJOP is exemplified by its acceptance of Rabbis Yaakov Perlow and Shmuel Kaminetzky as its chief rabbinical sponsors. So much so, that one of Agudath Israel of America chief spokesman, Rabbi Avi Shafran has spoken out on its behalf: :On January 16, the Association for Jewish Outreach Programs (AJOP), with which hundreds (yes, hundreds) of Orthodox outreach organizations are affiliated, will begin its annual 5-day convention; it will be the group's sixteenth such annual gathering. Among AJOP's members are a large number of community kollelim -- or Torah-study centers -- that offer study-partners, lectures and discussion groups to the Jewishly educated and non-educated alike. Such kollelim thrive in places like Phoenix, Des Moines, Norfolk, Boca Raton, and Palo Alto, not to mention larger cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Seattle, Memphis, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia and Cleveland (and many more -- including locations in South America, Canada and Mexico) \\"I Have a Dream,\\" Jewish Law Commentary, Am Echad resources. Shafran was responding to a critique published by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs by Chaim Waxman called \\"Changing Jewish Communities: Winners and Losers in Denominational Memberships in the United States\\": :With these developments, the haredim (ultra-Orthodox) have apparently gained self- confidence that manifests itself in greater assertiveness. For example, whereas at mid-century religious outreach was the province of the modern Orthodox, with the haredim being somewhat suspicious of ba'alei teshuva (the newly religious), by the end of the century the haredim were heavily engaged in religious outreach. Some of the frameworks include the National Jewish Outreach Program (NJOP), _the Association for Jewish Outreach Programs (AJOP), with which hundreds of Orthodox outreach organizations are affiliated_ , and the Orthodox Union's National Conference of Synagogue Youth (NCSY). Many of these were initially modern Orthodox but are today staffed by haredim.

Gen. Paul Tibbets was invited to visit the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base to share some of his experiences with the students. Tibbetts' visit became the genesis for Gathering of Eagles. The first official Gathering of Eagles, known at the time as, \\"Great Moments in Aviation History,\\" was held in 1982 when a small faculty and student group was chartered to develop an aviation heritage program. This initial cadre designed a program encouraging the study of aviation history, and the contributions of aviation pioneers. The Gathering of Eagles program at ACSC at Maxwell AFB, Alabama was started by Lt. Col. David L. McFarland in 1982, and he was the principal advisor of this program from 1982 through 2000. Each academic year, students (with rank of major) could apply and be selected to help plan this annual project, under the guidance of Lt. Col. McFarland and other faculty members. Dave McFarland personally traveled all over the world to meet and invite famous aviators to participate and be honored in the program, and his name is referenced in the annual booklet that was published for each gathering. Mission The Gathering of Eagles (GOE) is a year-long program that capstones the ACSC curriculum. Each year, people who have made a significant contribution to Airpower receive invitations to a week-long event to share their personal stories of courage, perseverance, and innovation to the ACSC class and local community. GOE has been an annual event since 1982 and has honored over 450 Eagles including Neil Armstrong, Jimmy Doolittle, Bea Haydu, John Glenn, Curtis LeMay, and Chuck Yeager. Current Eagles In Academic Year 2019, the Gathering of Eagles team selected 9 legends in Air, Space, and Cyberpower. The lineup for 2019 includes: General (ret) Kevin P.

Synopsis IMS was the first yacht racing rule developed around the central idea of a Velocity prediction program (VPP). The VPP was a complex computer program that integrated continuous hullform information in order to predict a given boat's speed potential in a given wind velocity.

Designers and boat owners much preferred this as they were able to design new yachts to maximise performance under the rule with a degree of certainty they had not enjoyed under the IOR rule. IMS is generally believed to have made significant leaps of progress forward from the IOR rule it displaced in terms of fairness and accuracy. IMS racing declined seriously in the early 2000s. A raft of new technology developments in yacht design led to a situation where the very largest and most expensive yachts were able to gain a significant technology advantage which the rule was less able to account for. Smaller yacht owners began to feel unfairly disadvantaged under the rule and between 2003 and 2007 much handicap racing around the world changed to using the newer IRC rule. However, an improved, revised version of IMS was developed over the years 2006-2008, and known as the Offshore Racing Congress (ORC) rule. As of 2008 some major sailing clubs around the world considered replacing IRC with ORC in their club activities, heralding a return to the IMS system in a more modern form.

She was the lead ship in her class. Unadilla was used by the Navy to patrol navigable waterways of the Confederacy to prevent the South from trading with other countries.  Built in New York City in 1861  USS Unadilla under construction at the yard of John Englis, New York Unadilla, a screw gunboat, was laid down at New York City by John Englis and the Novelty Iron Works in the late spring of 1861; launched on 17 August; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 30 September, Lt. Napoleon Collins in command. The vessel was one of 23 \\"90 Day\\" gunboats hurriedly constructed in less than three months shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861.  Civil War operations = Assigned to the South Atlantic Blockade  In October 1861, Unadilla joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont and participated in the capture of Fort Walker and Fort Beauregard in Port Royal Sound, South Carolina, on 7 November. During the bombardment, the gunboat was struck six times but suffered no casualties and sustained minor damage to her hull and rigging. Control of Port Royal Sound enabled the Union Navy to coordinate the blockade of the southern Atlantic seacoast more effectively for the duration of the war. On 10 November, Lt. Collins in Unadilla assumed command of Union naval forces off Beaufort, South Carolina, for the purpose of restoring order to the town following its capture two days before. Unadilla and next proceeded to Saint Helena Sound, South Carolina, on 24 November to reconnoiter Confederate positions at Hunting Island, Otter Island, and at the mouths of the Morgan and Coosaw rivers. The two gunboats conducted a survey up the Ashepoo River on 27 November. Unadilla returned to the Ashepoo on 6 December, but her engines failed, forcing the vessel back to Port Royal under tow on 9 December. In January 1862, Unadilla joined Pembina on patrol in Wright's River, South Carolina. On 28 January, the gunboats fired upon and drove back two Confederate steamers attempting to reach Ft. Pulaski, Georgia, and damaged three others. Unadilla remained in Wright's River through April, making several reconnaissance expeditions up both the Wright's and New rivers in March and investigating rumors that the Confederates were building a large ironclad warship at Savannah, Georgia. She was temporarily deployed in the Savannah River, Georgia, in mid-April and, on 24 April, received orders to return to Port Royal.  Unadilla assigned to blockade duty off Charleston, South Carolina  Unadilla left Port Royal for blockade duty off Charleston, South Carolina, on 28 April. On 10 May, she caught the English schooner Mary Teresa attempting to run into Charleston with a cargo of salt and assorted merchandise. Unadilla delivered the schooner's two passengers to the authorities and sent the vessel north to the New York prize court; then on 20 and 21 May, she joined Pembina, , and the surveying steamer in Stono Inlet, South Carolina, where the Union flotilla captured six armed Confederates. USS Unadilla crew members pose by the ship's Dahlgren XI-inch pivot gun, during the Civil War. On a second inspection of Stono Inlet and Stono River on 29 May, the vessels found the river free from Confederate obstructions and floating batteries, making it possible for Federal troops to cross in safety. Unadilla remained on duty in the Stono River until 4 July, when she returned to Port Royal to help repulse a Confederate attack upon Port Royal Island. Unadilla left Port Royal on 12 July for reconnaissance duty in Ossabow Sound, Georgia, and its tributaries. There, during an exploratory expedition up the Ogeechee River on 29 July, Unadilla, , and exchanged heavy gunfire with Confederate Fort McAllister for over an hour before retiring down the stream. On 4 August, while patrolling between the Ogeechee and Vernon rivers in Ossabow Sound, Unadilla captured the British blockade-running steamer Lodona and her cargo of foodstuffs, dry goods, and building materials. The gunboat returned to New York for repairs on 19 August.  Unadilla intercepts and captures material for Southern ironclads  When she was again ready for action, Unadilla resumed reconnaissance duty in the rivers and inlets of the South Carolina and Georgia coasts. She sailed to Port Royal from the North Edisto River, South Carolina, in late December for repairs and supplies, and then joined the blockading force off Charleston on 20 December 1862. There, Unadilla captured the screw steamer Princess Royal on 29 January 1863 after chasing the blockade runner aground. Princess Royal proved to be a rich catch, as she was laden with rifled guns, small arms, ammunition, and two powerful steam engines intended for ironclads. She was a valuable vessel herself and was later taken into the Union Navy. Unadilla ended the month by helping the Fleet to beat back an attempt to raise the blockade made during the foggy early morning hours of 31 January by the newly completed Confederate rams CSS Chicora and CSS Palmetto State. Before they were repulsed, the two ironclads largely destroyed both and , killing one quarter of the crew of theKeystone State. The near success of the attack prompted Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard to exuberantly, and erroneously, proclaim the blockade of Charleston lifted.  Unadilla supports the failed attempt to capture Charleston ports  Unadilla left the blockade off Charleston on 6 February to join with for reconnaissance activity in Stono Inlet and Stono River. In addition to routine patrol duties, Commodore McDonough, Unadilla and Pawnee entered the Kiawah River, South Carolina, on 28 February to ascertain if it were possible for the Confederates to install batteries on John's Island, but found that it was not. On 14 March, Unadilla received orders to return to the Charleston blockade to counter increased blockade running activity. There, the gunboat served with the reserve force during Rear Admiral Du Font's monitor attack upon the strong Confederate forts in Charleston harbor on 7 April. However, the Southern defenders put up such a vigorous defense that the Union fleet was compelled to disengage. Reporting on the action, Rear Admiral Du Pont commented that to continue the attack \\"would have converted a failure into a disaster.\\"  The war takes a toll on the busy ship  Shortly after the attack, Unadilla returned to her previous duty station in the Stono Inlet where she engaged a Confederate floating battery on 25 May. She remained there a month before being ordered to proceed to the command of the blockade off Wassaw Sound, Georgia, on 24 June. She put into Port Royal for repairs in August and returned to Wassaw Sound in September. From her post off Tybee Island, Georgia, the gunboat conducted frequent reconnaissance surveys and reported upon both suspected Confederate troop movements in the area and the construction and movements of the ram CSS Savannah. In January 1864, she underwent repairs at Port Royal and, in March, was dispatched to St. Johns River, Florida, for reconnaissance and convoy duties. After striking a sand bar, Unadilla returned to Port Royal in May where carpenters discovered that the battle-weary vessel needed an extensive overhaul. Unadilla was detained briefly in Ossabow Sound but, on 19 June, finally received orders north to the Philadelphia Navy Yard.  After repairs, she is assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade  Repairs completed, Unadilla departed Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 22 October, bound for Hampton Roads, Virginia, and duty with Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter's North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. On 22 November, she was dispatched to the blockade off New Inlet, North Carolina. She next served with the blockade off Wilmington, North Carolina, and Beaufort, North Carolina, in early December and participated in the unsuccessful first amphibious assault upon Confederate Fort Fisher in the Cape Fear River, North Carolina, on 24 and 25 December. The fleet returned two weeks later and took the fort during a second amphibious assault between 13 and 15 January 1865. The Union vessels continued up the Cape Fear River toward Wilmington, and Unadilla assisted in the attack and capture of Fort Anderson on 18 February. On 23 February, she was ordered to proceed to Hampton Roads and served in the James River, Virginia, squadron doing routine reconnaissance work until the end of the war.  Reassigned post-war to suppress Chinese pirates and visit King of Siam  Unadilla was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 4 May 1865 but was recommissioned on 20 December 1866 for duty with Rear Admiral Henry H. Bell's Asiatic Squadron in 1867, primarily for use in the suppression of Chinese pirates, Unadilla, together with , , and assorted small gunboats of other nations, was credited with stopping most of the pirate depredations by 1868. The gunboat also visited Bangkok in June 1868 to deliver arms and exchange diplomatic pleasantries with the King of Siam and his ministers. Soon thereafter, Unadilla was condemned as being too unseaworthy to be sent safely back to the United States and was sold on station on 9 November 1869.

He was Bernard Ato III of N√Æmes. (born c. 1159Kastner, 41.) was the posthumous son and successor of Bernard Ato V, Viscount of N√Æmes and Agde., at Medieval Lands Project. He reigned from 1163 until 1214, when he surrendered his fiefs to Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester and leader of the Albigensian Crusade.Graham-Leigh, 15. Bernard Ato was not connected with Catharism nor were his lands, but his relationship to Raymond Roger Trencavel (his first cousin) may have marked him off as an enemy of the Crusade by default, for he was a Trencavel, though he did not carry that name.Graham- Leigh, 55. In 1179, Roger II Trencavel, Raymond V of Toulouse, and Bernard Ato had all been excommunicated by Pons d'Arsac under the twenty-seventh canon of the Third Lateran Council for their lack of strong opposition to heresy.Graham-Leigh, 67. In that same year Bernard Ato did homage to Alfonso II of Aragon for his viscounties and made an alliance with Alfonso against Raymond V. In June 1187, Bernard Ato granted all his lands within the Diocese of Agde (omnes dominationes vicecomitatus) to the diocese and was then accepted into the cathedral church as a canon.Cheyette, \\"The Sovereign and the Pirates,\\" 42-43. In July the donation was confirmed by Raymond V and in August Bernard Ato also, in an extensive charter. The viscounty was de facto handed over to the bishop.Cheyette, \\"Suum cuique tribuere,\\" 290. He is also said by some authors to have given over N√Æmes to Raymond in that year, but this is contradicted by other sources. Bernard Ato swore fealty to William VIII of Montpellier for part of his domains in 1189, January 1191, and finally 1195.

He studied medicine in Lyon and Paris, where he was a student of Jules Baillarger (1809‚Äì1890) and Jean-Pierre Falret (1794‚Äì1870). From 1867 to the end of his career he was associated with the H√¥pital Sainte-Anne in Paris. At Sainte- Anne, he was a long-time colleague to Gustave Bouchereau (1835‚Äì1900).Psychiatrie Histoire (Louis) Gustave BOUCHEREAU Magnan was an influential figure in French psychiatry in the latter half of the 19th century. He is remembered for expanding the concept of degeneration that was first introduced into psychiatry by B√©n√©dict Augustin Morel (1809‚Äì1873). Magnan's theory of degeneration was a form of \\"evolutionary biology\\" that was based on an hereditary precept. He used terms such as bouff√©e d√©lirante (transitory delusional psychosis) and d√©lire chronique √©volution syst√©matique (chronic systemized delusional disorder) as descriptive categories of mental illness. In 1892 with psychiatrist Paul S√©rieux (1864‚Äì1947), he published a monograph on the latter mental state titled Le d√©lire chronique a √©volution syst√©matique. Magnan believed that the prodigious use of alcohol, particularly absinthe, was a major factor in what he perceived was a decline of French culture. In his investigations of absinthe he tried to establish a particular \\"absinthe effect\\" that wasn't present in other forms of alcohol, and suggested that the delirium of absinthe was different from delirium tremens experienced in alcoholism. In his research with laboratory animals, Magnan used essence of absinthe (wormwood), rather than the beverage itself, which contains only a small percentage of wormwood. From his experiments he observed that animals experienced epileptiform convulsions when exposed to concentrated levels of wormwood.  Associated eponym  * \\"Magnan's sign\\": An illusory sensation of a crawling foreign body being beneath the skin; a paresthesia in the psychosis of cocaine addicts.

He was born in Przeworsk and completed his childhood education in Krak√≥w, where he was taught by Bernardino Rizzi. In 1928, Mycielski moved to Paris, where he studied composition at √âcole Normale de Musique with Paul Dukas and Nadia Boulanger. While there, he served as president of the Association of Young Polish Musicians in Paris from 1934 to 1936. In 1936, he moved back to Poland and began his music and writing career. Mycielski served in the Polish military during World War II and became a prisoner of war after being captured by the German Army. For the rest of the war, he did compulsory work for a German farmer. After the war ended, he returned to Poland and served two terms as editor for Ruch Muzyczny (1946 ‚Äì 1948 and 1957 ‚Äì 1959) before becoming editor-in-chief from 1960 to 1968. His political views clashed with communist Polish authorities, however. His publications caused him to be ousted as editor-in-chief of Ruch Muzyczny; his writings were then subject to strict censorship and he was forbidden to leave the country. Mycielski continued his political activism though. In 1975, he signed a group letter with other Polish intellectuals protesting proposed changes to the Polish constitution by the Communist party. In 1978, he founded the Academic Education Society, a student organisation that was deemed illegal and later banned. Mycielski died in Warsaw and he was buried in Wi≈õniowa on the Wis≈Çok River.

Comparisons between communion (ittihad) in Alevism and the Christian trinity, whose three principles are called the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,The Kurds: a concise handbook, p. 143 notwithstanding, it is not comparable with the tritheistic conceptions of Hinduism, with Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu, and certainly not with polytheistic ancient Egypt in Osiris, Isis and Horus,The Mythological Trinity or Triad Osiris, Horus and Isis, Wikicommons[Manfred Lurker, Lexikon der G√∂tter und Symbole der alten √Ñgypter, Scherz 1998, p. 214f one cannot accurately depict such examples as being representative of the Haqq‚ÄìMuhammad‚ÄìAli communion (ittihad), since according to Alevi or Bektashi beliefs (Wahdat al-mawjud), only Allah is a real entity, Muhammad and Ali being simple manifestations of the way (Yol) and the light (Noor) of Allah (Haqq) and not of Allah himself, hence they are neither equal to it nor separate independent entities.Imaginal worlds, William Chiittick(1994), pg.53Souad Hakim ‚Äì Unity of Being in Ibn 'Arab√ÆIbn al-'Arabi, Muhyi al-Din (1164‚Äì1240) In Alevism, Muhammed is the means by which the Nasut (human nature) of the Avlioh (Saints) achieve ittihad (communion) with Haqq being the Lahut (divine nature) of Allah. It has more in common with theosis and the distinction and unity of the divine and human physes in orthodox Christology than it does with any kind of tritheism. The Alevi doctrine Allah is divine consciousness which first generates and gives shape to the Kull-i Nafs, a latent passive energy existing within Godhead. Kull-i Nafs is actually the apparent power of God to give life form, almost like a womb in that it is a place of manifestation where the concealed potential within Allah can be known and made visible. Thus, the physical universe is a mirror image of Allah. Kull-i Nafs reflects the spirit or divine consciousness of Allah. Nafs is Arabic for breath and it is the breath that binds the spirit with Allah. Kull-i Nafs is also envisioned as the Universal Soul or Soul Body as it is the divine consciousness reflected through the breath of Allah which gives this soul its own life and forms the Universal Human, the prototypal human, made manifest in Muhammad. However, the prototypal human is not male or female, but is a perfect interplay between the two in much the same way as the Taoists envision the Taiji. Within this prototypal human active energies contain passive and passive contain active. The light or Nur which links the two together is represented by Ali. Alevis feel no difficulty in speaking about God as a unity of heart, mind and spirit but believe that the term Hak- Muhammed-Ali a≈ükƒ±na (for the love of God-Muhammad-Ali) has nothing to do with a tritheistic polytheism and is misinterpreted by outsiders. According to them it's a short way to refer to Allah as the only One to be worshipped, Muhammad as the Rasul and Ali as wali along with the Twelve Imams in Alevism. Just like Shia Muslims Alevis say: \\"La ilahe ilallah, Muhammadden Resulullah, Aliyyen Veliyullah\\" (There is no god but God, Muhammad is His messenger, Ali is His wali). Alevis believe that all prophets and saints were strictly monotheists. Quran 18:110: Say, \\"I am only a man like you, to whom has been revealed that your god is one God. So whoever would hope for the meeting with his Lord - let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone.\\" Quran 41:6: Say, \\"I am only a man like you to whom it has been revealed that your god is but one God; so take a straight course to Him and seek His forgiveness.\\" And woe to those who associate others with Allah See also *Ghulat *Proto-Indo-Iranian religion *Proto-Indo-European religion *Religious humanism *Sufism *Trinity  References  Category:Alevism ","title":"Haqq‚ÄìMuhammad‚ÄìAli"},{"id":"13335909","text":"Melvin Reginald Knight (born July 30, 1944) was the Minister of Energy of Alberta and a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Early life Mel Knight was born July 30, 1944 in Beaverlodge, Alberta. His father worked for Northern Alberta Railways, and Knight grew up in the Peace Country. He graduated from Hillside High School in Valleyview, and worked as a roughneck and repairing equipment before earning his certification as a journeyman mechanic. He worked for drilling and petroleum companies until 1970, when he founded his own firm, Knight Measurement and Control, which eventually employed 55 people. He retired from this company in 1996. In 1972 he moved to a farm south of Vallyview, where he raised cattle and grew forage commercially. He bought a service station in 1974 that later operated as an antique shop (later shut down when the MD purchased the land for road access) . He is also active in real estate. Municipal politics Knight served as a municipal councillor for the Municipal District of Greenview No. 16. Provincial politics=Electoral record Knight first sought provincial office in the 2001 Alberta election as the Progressive Conservative candidate in the riding of Grande Prairie Smoky, where incumbent Progressive Conservative Walter Paszkowski was not seeking re-election. Knight was easily elected, taking more than two thirds of the vote against three opponents. He was re-elected by smaller margins, although still with absolute majorities, in the 2004 and 2008 elections. Backbencher As a backbencher in Ralph Klein's Progressive Conservative caucus, Knight moved a number of government bills. The first was 2003's Electric Utilities Act, which made some changes to the government's deregulation of the province's electricity market. Much of the debate around the bill was about whether the government's deregulation had worked well to date. The bill was passed on a party line vote, with Knight's fellow Progressive Conservatives voting unanimously in favour and the opposition Liberals and New Democrats voting unanimously against. Knight also sponsored the Securities Amendment Acts, separate bills with the same name from different years, 2005 and 2006. The first of these was designed to harmonize the securities regulation with that of other provinces. It was supported by Liberals Rick Miller and Bill Bonko, who considered it a step in the right direction. New Democrats gave it a mixed reception, with Ray Martin agreeing that it did make some improvements, but with his colleague David Eggen trying to kill it on third reading, saying that what was needed was a supra-provincial securities regulator. The 2006 edition of the Securities Amendment Act implemented further harmonization, and passed with little debate. The Securities Transfer Act of the same year consolidated and harmonized the province's rules for transferring securities, and passed with all-party support. In the 2006 Progressive Conservative leadership race, Knight endorsed eventual winner Ed Stelmach. Minister of Energy When Ed Stelmach became Premier in December 2006, he named Knight to his cabinet as Energy Minister. In this capacity, Knight oversaw some of the Stelmach government's most contentious policy issues, beginning with the government response to the Alberta Royalty Review, which recommended dramatically higher royalty rates from companies extracting oil in Alberta. The government rejected many of the review's recommendations, but did increase royalty rates by approximately 20% (25% less than recommended by the panel). These increases were criticized as too low by the opposition Liberals and New Democrats and as too high by some industry groups and Paul Hinman, the Wildrose Alliance Party's leader and sole MLA. Knight also dealt with the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board affair, which resulted from the June 2007 revelation that the EUB, a government-mandated and appointed body responsible for regulating energy resource development, pipelines, transmission lines, and investor-owned electric, water, and natural gas utilities, as well as certain municipality- owned utilities, admitted that it had hired private investigators to spy on landowners who opposed the construction of a major power line in the Rimbey area. Even as Stelmach defended the use of investigators, Knight called on the EUB to explain itself. He ordered a judicial investigation into the issue, to run parallel to an investigation being conducted by provincial Information and Privacy Commissioner Frank Work. After Work's investigation found that the EUB had violated provincial law and infringed on the landowner's privacy, the opposition parties called for Knight's resignation. However, when Stelmach unveiled his new cabinet after his victory in the 2008 election, Knight remained as Energy Minister. The major legislative initiative of Knight's time as Energy Minister has been the Alberta Utilities Commission Act, which became better known by its order paper designation, Bill 46. The bill split the EUB into two parts, the Alberta Utilities Commission (responsible for regulating utilities) and the Energy Resources Conservation Board (responsible for regulating oil and gas). The legislation was controversial, as elements of the EUB's governing legislation that provided for public notice and consultation in the event of energy construction projects were missing from the new entities. Opposition parties and activists protested the bill, but it passed through the legislature with the support of all Progressive Conservatives present. Knight has also presided over the appointment of an expert panel charged with evaluating the possibility of introducing nuclear energy into Alberta. He was exposed to criticism when, in response to a question from Liberal leader Kevin Taft about why the panel did not include representation from environmental groups, he asserted that the Sierra Club supported the use of nuclear energy in Europe; in fact, the Sierra Club opposes the use of nuclear energy and does not operate in Europe. Knight apologized for his error. In the government's 2008 throne speech, it asserted its intention to provide funding to expand Alberta's biofuels sector. Knight has asserted that this expansion will not result in increased food prices for Albertans. Personal life Knight is married to Diana, and the pair has three children - Darren, Shawna and Gregory - and ten grandchildren. He is a volunteer hockey coach, and is active with his local gun club and petroleum association.

The National University of Samoa has the distinction of being one of two universities in Samoa. The second is the University of the South Pacific - Alafua Campus which specializes in Agriculture. The campus was built in part with funding from the Government of Japan. It is built around the largest Fale Samoa in the world. History The National University of Samoa was established in 1984 by an Act of parliament. Its first degree, the Bachelor of Education, was launched in 1987. A year later, the Bachelor of Arts degree was introduced. The first graduates in both programs were awarded their degrees in 1990. Soon after, the Faculty of Commerce and the Faculty of Science were established. The Samoan Health Department's School of Nursing was merged into the university in 1993 as the Faculty of Nursing, and the Western Samoa Teacher's College was merged during 1997 as the Faculty of Education. The Institute of Samoan Studies was established in 1999; its name was changed in 2005 to the Centre for Samoan Studies. In 2006, Samoa Polytechnic merged into the university as the Institute of Technology. A former professor of Samoan Studies at the university is Aiono Fanaafi Le Tagaloa, a Samoan chief (matai) with a PhD from the University of London. Aiono is also the founder and president of the Indigenous University of Samoa (Le Iunivesite o le Amosa o Savavau), established in 1997. Academics NUS's academic offerings include programs from eight faculties and schools: * Faculty of Arts * Faculty of Business and Entrepreneurship * Faculty of Education * Faculty of Nursing and Health Science * Faculty of Science * School of Business & General Studies * School of Engineering * School of Maritime Training South Pacific Games The university's gymnasium was used as a venue for the 2007 South Pacific Games and the accommodation areas were made available to the New Caledonia team.

Sellers grew up on the campus of Wentworth Military Academy, a school founded by his maternal great-great-grandfather, Stephen G. Wentworth, and run by his paternal grandfather, Sandford Sellers, from 1880 to 1923, and by his father, James M. Sellers, from 1933 to 1960. Mac Sellers Jr. was a 1945 Wentworth graduate. He served as an enlisted man in the U.S. Navy from 1946 to 1948, and later as an officer in the U.S. Army, first on active duty and then in the reserves. In 1952, he earned a B.A. from Yale University, where he was named the Distinguished Military Graduate, and in 1956, he received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, where he ranked in the top 5% of his class and was elected a Baker Scholar. Following his graduation, he spent a year on the Harvard Business School faculty as Research assistant to Georges Doriot, Professor of Manufacturing. Sellers worked as Corporate Budget Director and served on the Executive Committee of the Vendo Corporation from 1958 to 1965, and then moved on to the Faultless Starch/Bon Ami Company, first as Executive Vice-President/Treasurer and then as interim CEO. In 1968, he co-founded International Laser Systems (ILS) along with company president and lifelong friend, laser pioneer William C. Schwartz, and raised the initial venture capital of $850,000 to get the company off the ground. He served as a Director of ILS from 1968 to 1983, and as Director of Schwartz Electro-Optics from 1984-1993. He was appointed as the seventh Superintendent of Wentworth Military Academy in 1973, after having served on the Board of Trustees since 1959. When he took over Wentworth, the school was facing its severest threat since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Vietnam War had created a strong anti-military sentiment, and enrollment dropped precipitously at military schools throughout the country. Many such institutions closed. Wentworth was further destabilized by a devastating fire on August 7, 1975 that destroyed of space, including old D Company Barracks, the military department, the band room, the rifle range, maintenance shops, and administrative offices. However, through budget cuts and careful fiscal management, Sellers was able to stabilize the school, and by 1978, enrollment was again on the upswing, peaking at over 400 students by 1985. A highlight of Sellers' tenure was Wentworth's Centennial Celebration in 1980, culminating with Vice President Walter Mondale's commencement address to the cadet corps. Sellers served as President of the Association of Military Colleges and Schools of the United States in 1982. He resigned as Wentworth's superintendent in 1990 and died in 1993. One of his four sons, William W. Sellers, served as President of Wentworth from 2008 to 2013. References * The Story of Wentworth, by Raymond W.

Zingarina finds Milan at the winter \\"Herod's Carnaval\\" (Festival of customs and traditions) but he tells her that their love story is over. The girl, angry and crushed, doesn't want to return to France or Italy. Marie is angry too so she fires Luminita because she thinks they have to leave from Transylvania. Zingarina exploits a temporary absence of Marie (the woman was at a phone-cabine) for running away from her (leaving a note only), in order to go after Vandana, a vagrant little girl. In her aimless travel through the boulevards and the villages, Zingarina meets Tchangalo (Birol Unel), a charming travelling merchant of Turkish descent. Between them there's a kind of comprehension and solidarity; then a love feeling. Even if Tchangalo is a man without borders and without ties, he accepts Zingarina (even the idea of forming a family with her); Tchangalo also accepts Zingarina's baby, even if he's not his natural son.

Sandford Sellers was born on July 24, 1854, near Lawrenceburg, Kentucky in Anderson County. He was the son of Dr. John Newton Sellers and Marcia Jane (McBrayer) Sellers, who moved the family to Texas shortly after his birth. He was raised on a ranch near Galveston. As a young boy, he worked in cotton and sugar cane fields, and as a teenager, worked the ranch as a cowboy. In 1872, he returned to Kentucky and took coursework at Danville Collegiate Institute at Danville, Kentucky, before enrolling at Central University in Richmond, Kentucky. He received the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1877 and the degree of Master of Arts in 1879. Between 1877 and 1880, he taught and served as principal of the academy at McAfee, Kentucky, taught at the military school at Waco, Texas, and then served as a Professor of English at Austin College at Sherman, Texas. In 1880, he was convinced by his Central University classmate Benjamin L. Hobson to go to Lexington, Missouri to help start Wentworth Male Academy. When Hobson left to pursue a career in the ministry at the end of the 1880-81 school year, Sellers took sole charge of the academy. For the next 58 years, Sellers served as Principal, Superintendent and President of the school, which changed its name to Wentworth Military Academy in 1890. In 1893, Wentworth was made a post of the Missouri National Guard. The National Guard conferred the rank of Major upon Sellers in 1893 and that of Colonel in 1899. He oversaw the construction of numerous buildings on campus, as well as the addition of the Junior College in 1923. For a number of years Colonel Sellers served as a director and vice- president of the Lexington Savings Bank. Politically, he was a Democrat, but he never sought public office. He joined the Presbyterian Church in 1875, and in 1898 he was elected ruling elder of this denomination for Lexington. He was made a Mason in 1897, belonging both to the chapter and the commandery. He died on March 4, 1938, a few weeks after suffering a fall in the school gymnasium. Wentworth later was headed by four of his descendants: son Sandford Sellers, Jr. (1923-1933), son James M.

Along with Things Fall Apart and No Longer at Ease, it is considered part of The African Trilogy, sharing similar settings and themes. The novel centers on Ezeulu, the chief priest of several Igbo villages in colonial Nigeria, who confronts colonial powers and Christian missionaries in the 1920s. The novel was published as part of the influential Heinemann African Writers Series. The phrase \\"Arrow of God\\" is drawn from an Igbo proverb in which a person, or sometimes an event, is said to represent the will of God. Arrow of God won the first ever Jock Campbell/New Statesman Prize for African writing.Ezenwa-Ohaeto (1997), Chinua Achebe: A Biography, James Currey Ltd, , p. 105. Plot summary The novel is set amongst the villages of the Igbo people in Colonial Nigeria during the 1920s. Ezeulu is the chief priest of the god Ulu, worshipped by the six villages of Umuaro. The book begins with Ezeulu and Umuaro fighting against a nearby village, Okperi. The conflict is abruptly resolved when T. K. Winterbottom, the British colonial overseer, intervenes. After the conflict, a Christian missionary, John Goodcountry, arrives in Umuaro. Goodcountry begins to tell the villages tales of Nigerians in the Niger Delta who abandoned (and battled) their traditional \\"bad customs\\" in favour of Christianity. Ezeulu is called away from his village by Winterbottom and is invited to become a part of the colonial administration, a policy known as indirect rule. Ezeulu refuses to be a \\"white man's chief\\" and is thrown in prison. In Umuaro, the people cannot harvest the yams until Ezeulu has called the New Yam Feast to give thanks to Ulu. When Ezeulu returns from prison, he refuses to call the feast despite being implored by other important men in the village to compromise. Ezeulu reasons to the people and to himself that it is not his will but Ulu's; Ezeulu believes himself to be half spirit and half man. The yams begin to rot in the field, and a famine ensues for which the village blames Ezeulu. Seeing this as an opportunity, John Goodcountry proposes that the village offer thanks to the Christian God instead and they may harvest what remains of their crops with \\"immunity\\". Many of the villagers have already lost their faith in Ezeulu. One of Ezeulu's sons, Obika, dies during a traditional ceremony, and the villagers interpret this as a sign that Ulu has taken sides with them against his priest. For this apparent judgement against Ezeulu and the promised immunity by the Christian God, at the Christian Harvest, taking place a few days after Obika's death, many men embrace Christianity by sending their son there with yams. The title \\"Arrow of God\\" refers to Ezeulu's image of himself as an arrow in the bow of his god. Themes Ulu, the villages of Umuaro and Okperi, and the colonial officials are all fictional. However, the depiction of Colonial Nigeria is accurate in depicting the conflict between the tradition beliefs and religions of the Nigerians and the foreign values introduced by the Europeans, including Christianity. In addition, indirect rule was favoured by the colonial authorities in West Africa as a way to reduce the cost of colonial administration. The novel is considered a work of African literary realism. Achebe's first novel, Things Fall Apart, tells the tale of Okonkwo, a leader in his community who comes into dispute with the colonial authorities. Arrow of God similarly describes the downfall of a traditional leader at the hands of the colonial authorities. The central conflicts of the novel revolve around the struggle between continuity and change, such as Ezeulu refusing to serve Winterbottom, or between the traditional villagers and Ezeulu's son who studies Christianity.

However, when Hank returns to LA, the original copy is lost when he is carjacked. Mia however has retained her own copy, and chooses to pass the work off as her own. On Karen and Bill's wedding day, Hank chooses to accept the way things are, but as he leaves the reception with his daughter Becca, Karen runs out and jumps into the car, riding into a new life together. Season 2 (2008) Californication's Second season premiered September 28, 2008 and ended December 14, 2008. The newly reunited couple of Hank and Karen seem to be working, their house is on the market, and Becca seems happy again. Hank gets a vasectomy and attends a party thrown by Sonja, whom he'd been with in season one. A mistake and a fight with an obnoxious police officer lands Hank in jail, where he meets world-famous record producer Lew Ashby, who commissions Hank to write his biography. After too much office masturbation loses him his job, Charlie decides to go into the porn industry. He becomes the agent/paternal-figure of porn star Daisy and finances her movie, \\"Vaginatown\\". Marcy goes into rehab for her cocaine addiction and Charlie starts an affair with Daisy. Hank proposes to Karen on the night that they discover that Hank could be the father of Sonja's child. When Karen says no, Hank decides that they can no longer be together. Hank moves in with Ashby, who starts a romance with Mia. Becca finds a boyfriend named Damien. Mia's book becomes a hit and Ashby holds a party in its honor, where Damien cheats on Becca and Charlie decides to divorce Marcy to get together with Daisy. After the party Hank goes looking for Lew when his \\"one-that-got-away\\" girlfriend arrives, but Ashby dies of an overdose of heroin he had mistaken for cocaine. Hank finishes Ashby's biography. Charlie ends up working in a BMW dealership in the Valley. When Sonja's baby is born, Hank is cleared of being the father because the child is half-black. As Hank and Karen turn toward each other again, Karen is offered a job in New York. Hank looks forward to going back there with her, but when Damien and Becca reconcile, Hank decides it would be wrong to remove Becca from Los Angeles, so he and Becca will stay in L.A. while Karen moves to New York.

It is one of the 12 ranks of Imam in Alevism. The institution of dede is the most important of all the institutions integral to the social and religious organization of the Anatolian Alevis. Although much weakened as a result of the socio-economic transformation experienced in Anatolia towards the end of the nineteenth century, and particularly due to accelerated migration from the rural to the urban areas after the foundation of the Republic of Turkey, it played a primary role in the survival of Alevism until today. The institution of dedes is based on a three tiered hierarchy: # Murshid # Pir # Rehber In some regions this hierarchy is modified in such a way that the Pir and Murshid change places. This is exclusively a functional hierarchy, as all involved come from a dede family. They fulfill functions that are complementary in nature, and would be meaningless in isolation from each other. The dede families, all of them called ocakz√¢des, have distributed these duties among themselves. An Alevi dede focuses on the mystical Islamic teachings of the Twelve Imams, the Buyruks (mainly the Imam C√¢fer-i Sadƒ±k Buyruƒüu) and Haji Bektash Veli.  Qualifications  According to the books of the Buyruk which include the basic principles of the Alevi faith, and the traditions that survive among the Alevis, a dede must have the following qualifications:On the issue of the qualifications and functions of dedes, Peter J. Bumke gives valuable information. Bumke, ibid, pp. 18-21 * To be a descendant of the Prophet (ocakz√¢de). * To operate as an educator and a moral guide (m√ºrebbi) for the community. * To be knowledgeable and exemplary in his character and manners (Al-InsƒÅn al-KƒÅmil). * To follow the principles written in the Buyruks, as well as the established traditions of Alevism.  Functions  The main functions of the dedes can be summarized as follows: * To guide and enlighten (ir≈üad) the community in social and religious matters. * To lead the religious rituals. * To punish the criminals, and to serve as an arbiter between conflicting sides. * To lead ceremonies during occasions such as a wedding or a funeral. * To fulfill certain legal and educational functions. * Provide health provisions. * Provide socio-political leadership. * In some exceptional cases, such as in the Tunceli province (formerly Dersim),Officially today there is no province called Dersim. For centuries, Dersim maintained a kind of autonomy under the leadership of the tribal chiefs, and covers a region that includes the provinces of Erzincan, Tunceli and parts of Sivas. In 1937, the name of Dersim was changed to Tunceli. dedes share the leadership position with the large landowners, the Aƒüas.  Legal functions  For Alevis, ‚ÄúYol‚Äù (path) is a very important concept. The pedigrees of the dedes consistently emphasize this by saying ‚ÄúYol c√ºmleden uludur‚Äù [the Path is the most exalted of all].This and similar expressions are frequently encountered in the secere of the Ocak of Ali Abbas. What is important is the Yol and not the personal desires and needs of an individual Alevi. All the latter are possible only in conformity with the former. Otherwise, the institution of d√º≈ük√ºn would be activated. In other words, an Alevi would become a d√º≈ük√ºn if he tries to satisfy his desires and needs without regard for the Yol. As Prof. Yusuf Ziya Y√∂r√ºkan noted ‚ÄúDede declares one a \\"d√º≈ük√ºn\\" by saying to him \\"may your face be darkened\\". Any more that person is deprived of the law of men.\\"Yusuf Ziya, ‚ÄúTahtacƒ±lar, Tahtacƒ±larda Dini ve Sƒ±rri hayat‚Äô, DAR√úLF√úNUN ƒ∞LAHƒ∞YAT FAK√úLTESƒ∞ MECMUASI, year: 4, no: 15, May 1930, p. 75 The following are major crimes that lead one to the state of d√º≈ük√ºn:Also see, √ñzt√ºrk, Ya≈üar Nuri, ibid, pp. 78-81.

He worked on the biosynthetic pathways of many organic natural substances.  Birth and education  Born in Lugano, Switzerland, Arigoni completed his undergraduate studies in Chemistry from ETH Z√ºrich in 1951. He completed his Ph.D. in Chemistry from ETH Zurich in 1955. His doctoral thesis was ‚Äú√úber konfigurative Beziehungen Steroid- und Terpenverbindungen‚Äù.  Academic career  After completing his Ph.D., he became professor at ETH Zurich. He was also a visiting professor at Harvard University and Cambridge University. He has worked as a professor at ETH Zurich for over fifty years.  Research  Arigoni is known for his research in bio-organic stereochemistry. His major contributions are in the stereochemistry of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and in the biosynthesis of terpenes, alkaloids, and enzyme cofactors. He has explored the detailed stereochemical pathways by which enzymes convert their substrates into products.Winfried R. P√∂tsch, Annelore Fischer and Wolfgang M√ºller with contributions of Heinz Cassenbaum: Lexikon bedeutender Chemiker, VEB Bibliographisches Institut Leipzig, 1988, p. 15, . His strategy of penetrating into the structure of enzyme-substrate interactions by concentrating on the detailed stereochemical fate of isotopic substrate labels, led him to make basic contributions to the mechanism of enzymic reactions requiring coenzyme B12, one of the 'pigments of life'.  Awards  Arigoni has received numerous awards. In 1989 he was awarded the Wolf Prize in Chemistry along with Alan R.

Written as a satirical piece, A Man of the People follows a story told by Odili, a young and educated narrator, on his conflict with Chief Nanga, his former teacher who enters a career in politics in an unnamed fictional 20th century African country. Odili represents the changing younger generation; Nanga represents the traditional West African customs, inspired by that of Achebe's native Nigeria. The book ends with a military coup, similar to the real-life coup organized by Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu, Major Adewale Ademoyega, Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna, Captain Chris Anuforo, Major Donatus Okafor, and Major Humphrey Chukwuka.  Plot introduction  A Man of the People is a first-person account of Odili, a school teacher in a fictional country closely resembling post-colonial Nigeria. Odili receives an invitation from his former teacher, Chief Nanga, who is now the powerful but corrupt Minister of Culture. As Minister, Nanga's job is to protect the traditions of his country especially when he is known as \\"A Man of the People\\". Instead, his position is used to increase his personal wealth and power that proves particularly alluring to Odili's girlfriend; she cheats on him with the minister. Seeking revenge, Odili begins to pursue the minister's fiancee. Odili agrees to lead an opposition party in the face of both bribes and violent threats. Then there is a military coup.  Similarity to future events  Upon reading an advance copy of the novel, Achebe's friend, Nigerian poet and playwright John Pepper Clark declared: \\"Chinua, I know you are a prophet. Everything in this book has happened except a military coup!\\" Later on, Nigerian Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu seized control of the northern region of the country as part of a larger coup attempt. Commanders in other areas failed, and the plot was answered by a military crackdown which resulted in the presidency of Major General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi.  Literary significance  Some of the themes from the novel are found in a short story \\"The Voter\\" (1965), published in Black Orpheus magazine.Albert S. G√©rard, European-language Writing in Sub-Saharan Africa, 1986: \\"Details from Chinua Achebe's story ‚ÄúThe Voter‚Äù in No. 17 are echoed in his novel, A Man of the People (1966).\\" Achebe's first three novels were all clearly set in Igbo villages in Nigeria. A Man of the People, however, was set in a fictional African country as Achebe sought to write African literature on the condition of the continent in more general terms. The novel does not include any specific ethnic or cultural groups. The problems portrayed in the book, such as bribery, incompetence and governmental apathy, were experienced by many West African nations in the neocolonial era. As Nigeria had not experienced a coup when Achebe wrote A Man of the People, his model for the novel's events must have been military coups in other African nations. Despite his intentions, however, the subsequent coup in Nigeria meant that the book was again seen as being principally about Nigeria. The novel was republished in the influential Heinemann African Writers Series.

Alevis believe that the Jem has its roots in an original worship and teaching meeting of forty spiritual individuals Kirklar Majlisi (Turkish: Kƒ±rklar Meclisi) led by Ali. It takes place in a Cem Evi  √Çy√Æn-i Cem (cem ceremony)  The ceremony's supposed prototype is the Prophet Muhammad's nocturnal ascent into heaven, where he beheld a gathering of forty saints (Kƒ±rklar Meclisi), and the Divine Reality made manifest in their leader, Ali. *During the \\"Jem ceremony\\" the √Ç≈üƒ±k' plays the Baƒülama whilst singing spiritual songs, some of which are centuries old and well known amongst Alevis. Every song, called a Nefes has spiritual meaning and aims to teach the participants important lessons. One such song goes thus: :\\"Learn from your mistakes and be knowledgeable, :Don't look for faults in others, :Look at 73 different people in the same way, :God loves and created them all, so don't say anything against them.\\" *The love of the creator for the created and vice versa is symbolised in the Cem ceremony by the use of fruit juice and/or red wine [Dem] which represents the intoxication of the lover in the beloved. During the ceremony is Dem one of the twelve duties of the participants. *At the closing of the cem ceremony the dede who leads the ceremony engages the participants in a discussion, this discussion is called a sohbet.  The Semah (SamƒÅh)  A family of ritual dances reminiscent of the Sama ceremony of the whirling dervishes characterized by turning and swirling, is an inseparable part of any Cem.

The G√∂rg√º Cem  The Rite of Integration (g√∂rg√º cemi) is a complex ritual occasion in which a variety of tasks are allotted to incumbents bound together by extrafamilial brotherhood (M√ºsahiplik), who undertake a dramatization of unity and integration under the direction of the spiritual leader (dede). Twelve services There are twelve services () performed by attendees of the Cem: # or : This is the leader of the Cem who represents Muhammad and Ali. The Dede receives confession from the attendees at the beginning of the ceremony. He also leads funerals, M√ºsahiplik, marriage ceremonies and circumcisions.

Military career Freeman was born June 29, 1907, in the Philippine Islands, son of Paul Lamar and Emma (Rosenbaum) Freeman. He graduated from the United States Military Academy on June 13, 1929, with a class ranking of 213 and commissioned in the infantry. His first assignment was at Fort Sam Houston with the 9th Infantry Division. While in Texas, he married Mary Ann Fishburn on August 18, 1932, and had one daughter. A month after getting married, he reported to Fort Benning to attend the Officer's Course at the Infantry School, then was assigned to Tianjin (then called Tientsin) in China with the 15th Infantry Regiment until 1936. Upon his return to the U.S. he was assigned to Fort Washington, Maryland and was a company commander in the 12th Infantry Regiment, and subsequently returned to Fort Benning for the Tank Course. He then spent a year as company and battalion Maintenance Officer with the 66th Infantry Regiment. At the time of the United States entry into World War II, Freeman was in China again, in Beijing as a language student and concurrently as Assistant Military Attach√© at the American embassy. Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, he was assigned to the U.S. Military Mission to China, and a few months later reassigned to the staff of the China India Burma Theater as an instructor to Chinese and Indian Armies. He remained on the theater staff until September 1943, when he returned to Washington D.C., as a staff officer. Towards the end of the war in late 1944, he was sent to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil as Director of Arms Training for the Joint Brazil-United States Military Commission, a position he held until October 1947. He returned to the Army General Staff in Washington D.C., working in the Latin American Branch of the Plans and Operating Division, then from 1948 to 1950, served as a member of the Joint Brazil-U.S. Military Commission, and was also a member of the U.S. Army delegation to the Inter-American Defense Board. With the outbreak of the Korean War, he was deployed to that theater as the Commander of the 23rd Infantry Regiment in the 2nd Infantry Division. He led the Regiment in the retreat from Kunu-ri in November 1950. In early February he led the 23rd Regimental Combat Team in the Battle of the Twin Tunnels on 1 February 1951 and then at Battle of Chipyong-ni from 13 to 15 February 1951. At Chipyong-ni the 23rd RCT was cut off and surrounded by elements of five Chinese divisions, which launched fanatical all-out assaults against them. He was wounded on the first night of the engagement by mortar shrapnel in his left calf. Although he expected to return to the 23rd Infantry Regiment after his wounds healed, he did not resume command of the regiment, having been returned to the US to recover.

History and background Although the SanghƒÅta circulated first in Sanskrit, it was subsequently translated into all the major languages of Buddhist communities to the north, northwest and east of India: Khotanese, Chinese, Sogdian and Tibetan. This translation work took place over the course of the 5th through 10th centuries of the common era. Manuscripts of the SanghƒÅta have been recovered in Gilgit (in 1931 and 1938), Khotan, Dunhuang, and other sites in Central Asia along the silk route. Translations=Khotanese translation The Khotanese translation of the SanghƒÅta is the oldest translation into a vernacular language that we have. The SanghƒÅta had been translated into Khotanese sometime before the middle of the 5th century CE. Fragments of varying lengths survive in 27 manuscripts of the SanghƒÅta in Khotanese. An edition of the existing Khotanese version of the SanghƒÅta was published in 1993 by Giotto Canevascini, with an English translation of the Khotanese and corresponding Sanskrit. (There are major portions of the Sanskrit missing from the Khotanese version.) Sogdian translation Fragments of a Sogdian translation of the SanghƒÅta were recovered from sites in Central Asia, including Turpan. Chinese translations The Chinese Buddhist canon contains two translations of the SanghƒÅta, one produced around the middle of the 6th century CE by an Indian named Upash≈´nya, who was said to be the son of a king of Ujjayini in south India. The second Chinese translation was completed around the turn of the 10th century, by another Indian named DanƒÅpƒÅla, who was a prolific translator into Chinese with over 100 translations of various Buddhist texts to his credit. The two translations appear on the CBETA electronic edition of the Taisho collection as texts numbered 423 and 424, respectively. Of the two Chinese translations, the earlier translation (number 423) appears to correspond a bit more closely to the Sanskrit manuscripts of the SanghƒÅta that have survived. Tibetan translation The SanghƒÅta was translated into Tibetan in the 9th century CE. A colophon at the end of that translation suggests that there had been an earlier translation, now lost, whose 'language was updated' by the only translation that survives. English translationhttps://www.sanghatasutra.net/english-translation.html This translation into English was prepared by Ven. Lhundup Damch√∂ and completed in January, 2006. Translating from Tibetan, she consulted the Sanskrit to clarify the many places where the Tibetan was ambiguous. The Sanskrit was also at times ambiguous or multivalent, and in those same places you may find the English to be open to multiple interpretations. Contemporary scholarly study of the SanghƒÅta The majority of scholarly interest in the SanghƒÅta to date has been philological. A number of critical editions have been prepared by European scholars. These editors made invaluable contributions to the study of the SanghƒÅta, through their work dating and editing its manuscripts, but found the content of the text 'confused' (Oskar von Hin√ºber, in a 1980 article) or 'cryptic' (Giotto Canevascini in his 1993 work). Since Gregory Schopen's influential article in 1979 suggesting that the MahƒÅyƒÅna may have begun as a loose federation of groups centered around particular sutras -‚Äî what he called the 'cult of the book‚Äô -- his assertion has been widely accepted as descriptive of the history of the early MahƒÅyƒÅna. The SanghƒÅta S≈´tra, which imagines itself as the focus of intense worship, is a prime example of this category. Art historian Deborah Klimburg-Salter has considered the impact that the SanghƒÅta may have had on the culture around it. In a 1987 article, she points out that the fact that the decorative manuscript covers found with the SanghƒÅta in Gilgit were among the very earliest suggests that the text itself played a pivotal role in shifting attitudes towards books in India: > The Gilgit manuscript covers, as well as manuscripts from the find, mark an > important phase in the history of the art of the book in India‚Ä¶. That is, > that a change took place in the concept of the book so that books were seen > not merely as media for the conveyance of information but, for some reason > or reasons as yet unclear, began to be conceived of as objects worthy of > beautification. As we shall see, one possibility, which needs further > consideration, is that this development was affected by the evolution of > certain texts into cult objects. (Klimburg-Salter, 1987:817) Meaning of the name SanghƒÅta As one linguist who studied the Sanskrit and Khotanese versions of the SanghƒÅta put it, \\"the cryptic aspects of the sutra also extend to its title.\\" In standard Sanskrit, sanghƒÅta is a term meaning the ‚Äòfitting and joining of timbers‚Äô or ‚Äòthe work done by a carpenter in joining two pieces of wood,‚Äô and can refer to carpentry in general. It has a specialized use in a few Buddhist Sanskrit texts, where it means ‚Äòvessel‚Äô or ‚Äòjar,‚Äô and this image of ‚Äòsomething that contains‚Äô is evoked several times within the sutra, when Buddha calls the SanghƒÅta a ‚Äòtreasury of Dharma.‚Äô Whether we take sanghƒÅta as having the sense of joining or connecting that it has in standard Sanskrit, or the sense of holding or containing that it can have in Buddhist Sanskrit, the question remains as to just what is connected or held. One possible interpretation is that what is connected are sentient beings, and they are joined or connected by the SanghƒÅta to enlightenment. This suggestion‚Äîthat what the SanghƒÅta joins is sentient beings to enlightenment‚Äîwas offered by Kirti Tsenshab Rinpoche during an oral transmission of the text in 2003. In this, we find an idea that we readers and reciters are the material that the SanghƒÅta is working on, as it shapes us, and connects us to our enlightenment in such a way that we will never turn back. This, indeed, is what Sarvashura initially requests the Buddha to give: a teaching that can ensure that the young ones are never disconnected from their path to enlightenment. Early translators understanding of the SanghƒÅta  Translators of the SanghƒÅta have taken a fairly broad range of stances on the question of the title's meaning. The two earliest translations we have ‚Äî- the Khotanese and the first of the two Chinese translations‚Äîdo not translate the name at all. This decision by the Khotanese translator of the SanghƒÅta to leave the name ‚ÄòSanghƒÅta‚Äô in Sanskrit is particularly striking, because the general strategy that Khotanese translators took was to translate the meanings of words wherever possible, rather than leaving them in Sanskrit. Thus in Khotanese even the word ‚ÄòBuddha‚Äô is translated, trying to capture the meaning rather than treating it as a proper name and leaving it as ‚ÄòBuddha,‚Äô as in English. The Chinese translation was produced by an Indian scholar working in China in the 6th century, while the Khotanese was produced some time before the middle of the 5th century, a time when contact between Indian and Khotanese scholars would still have been relatively easy. If there was any common knowledge, or received wisdom as to what the title meant, it seems likely that these translators would have had access to it. Since they did not choose to translate the titles into local languages, we can speculate that either they thought it important to leave the name of the sutra in Sanskrit for some reason, or they felt that there was no easy answer to the question: what exactly does the name mean? The next two translations to be completed‚Äîinto Tibetan and then into Chinese for a second time‚Äîboth chose to translate the term ‚ÄòsanghƒÅta‚Äô into their own languages, but did so in different ways. The second translator into Chinese rendered the title of the sutra in Chinese as The Sutra of the Great Gathering of the Holy Dharma. (In Chinese, Ta chi hui cheng fa ching in the Wade‚ÄìGiles transliteration system, or Ta ji-hui zheng-fa jing in Pinyin.) The Tibetan translation of ‚ÄòSanghƒÅta‚Äô is sanctioned by the authoritative glossary used for the translation of Sanskrit terms into Tibetan, known as the Mahavyutpatti. This glossary was compiled in the 9th century in Tibet by a team of respected translators, under the royal decree of the Tibetan king Tri Ralpachen. In it, ‚ÄòSanghƒÅta sutra‚Äô is translated as 'The Sutra of the Pair of Monastic Assemblies,‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe Sutra of the Pair of Sanghas‚Äô (dge ‚Äôdun zung gi mdo). This seems to suggest that what are paired, or joined together, are two assemblies of Sangha. As understood by these translators, ‚ÄòSanghƒÅta‚Äô in the title refers to a pair of monastic assemblies. But which two monastic assemblies are paired? During the SanghƒÅta, groups are assembling right up to the final pages of the sutra, but most of those who gather are not identified even as Buddhists, much less monastic assemblies. In the SanghƒÅta, there are no two clear groups of ordained Sangha. But there is one prominent pair of groups in the SanghƒÅta: the groups of young and old beings. Just who the young and old are is another topic open to discussion, but it is clear that a group of young beings is brought together with a group of old beings in the SanghƒÅta. Indeed, in the question that initiates the dialogue, Sarvashura asks for a teaching that can benefit young and old at the same time‚Äîa teaching for a pair of groups. However, in most (but not all) of the editions of the Tibetan canon, or bka‚Äô ‚Äògyur (kagyur), the title of the text is simply rendered as ‚ÄòZung,‚Äô omitting the reference to monastic assembly or Sangha. And in the text itself, in all the editions of the canon, wherever we had ‚ÄòSanghƒÅta‚Äô in Sanskrit, the text says simply ‚Äòzung,‚Äô and does not mention any assembly or Sangha. Further note on SanghƒÅta in Sanskrit The ‚Äòsangha‚Äô in SanghƒÅta does not appear to be the same as the ‚Äòsangha‚Äô in Sangha. In ‚ÄòSanghƒÅta‚Äô the second 'a' is long (this the long marker over the ‚Äòa‚Äô) and the 't' is retroflex. See also * Silk Road transmission of Buddhism References *Saloman, Richard.

In Kupalo's Fire (1966), Kalynets connects the country's folklore and ancient traditions to modern, Soviet life. Most of his works do not contain glaring political criticisms, rather unexpressed denunciation. He drew strong influence from Bohdan Ihor Antonych, and dedicated one of his poems to him. He also dedicated poems to various Ukrainian cultural icons, including Taras Shevchenko, filmmaker Alexander Dovzhenko, and composer Stanislav Liudkevych among others.

In March 1971, the 24th Congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine denounced Kalynets' poetry as \\"reprehensible\\", made worse by the fact that he allowed his work to be published in the West. He was then indicted on the grounds that he \\"issues a veiled appeal to struggle against the Soviet government\\", \\"calls for a revival of the Uniate Church\\", \\"covertly presents the idea that the Ukrainian people is oppressed by the Soviet government\\", and \\"articulates a nationalist ideology, as well as nostalgia for the past and for an independent state\\".

Early life Born in Rome, Galli was a marginal buffo tenor, appearing in Naples, Bologna, Parma, and Turin, primarily in the works of Nasolini, Generali, and Zingarelli. It is said that following an illness in 1810, his voice changed markedly into that of bass, but this may have been a cover story for his technical transition into the bass repertoire upon the advice of the composer Giovanni Paisiello or singer Luigi Marchesi. Galli's younger brother Vincenzo was also an opera singer noted for his performances in basso buffo roles. Career as bass His new career took rise in 1812: his meeting with Rossini allowed him to sing L'inganno felice on 1 August at the Teatro San Mois√®, Venice (in the role of Tarabotto). After his creation of Polidoro in Pietro Generali's La vedova stravagante, he appeared in a new opera by Rossini‚ÄîLa pietra del paragone on 26 September 1812. His performance in the \\"Sigillara\\" aria was the hit of the immensely successful opera. His collaboration with Rossini increased: on 22 May 1813 he sang Mustaf√† in the premiere of L'italiana in Algeri at the Teatro San Benedetto in Venice. Rossini then composed numerous other bass parts specifically for Galli. On 14 August 1814 he appeared in Il turco in Italia at La Scala; on 31 May 1817 (again at La Scala), in the very difficult role of Fernando in La gazza ladra. The title role in Maometto II followed on 3 December 1820 at the Teatro di San Carlo, Naples plus, on 3 February 1823, he sang the role of Assur in Semiramide at La Fenice in Venice. Galli also created the role of Enrico (Henry) VIII in Donizetti's Anna Bolena at the Teatro Carcano in Milan.

Church in 1866. In 1868, Sheldon and Company gained financial control of the magazine and it was eventually absorbed by The Atlantic Monthly in 1878. Notable contributors to the magazine include Mark Twain, Walt Whitman and Henry James. History In 1861, after the start of the Civil War, William Church served as a war correspondent for the New York Evening Post and later for The New York Times. In 1863, after leaving the war behind, William and his brother started the Army and Navy Journal, and in 1866 they started Galaxy magazine. Oliver Wendell Holmes, who had named The Atlantic Monthly, may have named the new magazine. The Church brothers published and edited the magazine for two years from 1866 to 1868. The publishing house of Sheldon and Company took over publishing in 1868, and ten years later in 1878 Sheldon ceased publication of the magazine and it was absorbed into The Atlantic. Francis Church later went to work as an editorial writer for the New York Sun, where he wrote the Christmas editorial commonly referred to as \\"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.\\" Notable contributors After the magazine went into publication in 1866, besides the Church brothers working as editors, Frederic Beecher Perkins, a well known librarian and an experienced editor, was an office editor and Richard Grant White was an editorial contributor who wrote special articles for the magazine. As departments were added to the Galaxy, other writers were added. George E. Pond, who had been associate editor of the Army and Navy Journal wrote an editorial column (mainly political) called \\"Drift- Wood\\" under the name of \\"Phillip Quilibet\\" and S.S. Conant, who was editor of Harper's Weekly, wrote and critiqued for the Galaxy's fine arts department. James F. Meline contributed reviews of French and German books, while Professor E.L. Youmans, edited the \\"Scientific Miscellany\\" from 1871 to 1874. Carl Benson, in private life known as Charles Astor Bristed, wrote for the department called \\"Casual Cogitations\\". The Galaxy published many of Henry James' early short stories, including \\"A Day of Days\\" (1866), \\"A Light Man\\" (1869) and \\"Madame de Mauves\\" (1874). Mark Twain wrote a column called \\"Memoranda\\" for the magazine from 1870 to 1871. Twain's introductory column announced that his department would carry \\"ample dissertations upon political economy\\". Twain went on to contribute over eighty pieces to the Galaxy, which paid him $20 per page for his monthly column, more than double its regular rate. In December 1866, The Galaxy, published the first biographical essay of the poet Walt Whitman, written by his friend John Burroughs, titled \\"Walt Whitman and His Drum-Taps.\\" The magazine went on to publish four poems by Whitman, A Carol of Harvest (1867), Brother of All with Generous Hand (1870), Warble for Lilac-Time (1870), and 0 Star of France (1871). The Galaxy also printed the beginnings of Whitman's essay Democratic Vistas in two articles. The first part titled Democracy, was published in December 1867 and the second part, Personalism, appeared in May 1868. Edward F. Grier wrote about the poet: \\"Whitman's position as a Galaxy author was important to his personal fortunes and his literary reputation. The Galaxy was respectable, it was popular, and it paid generously. It also provided a venue where Whitman could join with other writers in exploring the meaning of literary nationalism and cultural democracy for the new era.\\" See also *List of literary magazines *Essay *Short story *Sequel to Drum-Taps ReferencesExternal links *The Galaxy, Making of America Collection, Cornell University Library *The Galaxy Volume I.

This article concerns its use in understanding IT-reliant systems in organizations. A notable use of the term occurred in 1977 in the first volume of MIS Quarterly in two articles by Bostrom and Heinen (1977). Later Sumner and Ryan (1994) used it to explain problems in the adoption of CASE (computer-aided software engineering). A number of socio-technical systems researchers such as Trist and Mumford also used the term occasionally, but seemed not to define it in detail. In contrast, the work system approach defines work system carefully and uses it as a basic analytical concept. A work system is a system in which human participants and/or machines perform work (processes and activities) using information, technology, and other resources to produce products/services for internal or external customers. Typical business organizations contain work systems that procure materials from suppliers, produce products, deliver products to customers, find customers, create financial reports, hire employees, coordinate work across departments, and perform many other functions. The work system concept is like a common denominator for many of the types of systems that operate within or across organizations. Operational information systems, service systems, projects, supply chains, and ecommerce web sites can all be viewed as special cases of work systems. * An information system is a work system whose processes and activities are devoted to processing information. * A service system is a work system that produces services for its customers. * A project is a work system designed to produce a product and then go out of existence. * A supply chain is an interorganizational work system devoted to procuring materials and other inputs required to produce a firm's products. * An ecommerce web site can be viewed as a work system in which a buyer uses a seller's web site to obtain product information and perform purchase transactions. The relationship between work systems in general and the special cases implies that the same basic concepts apply to all of the special cases, which also have their own specialized vocabulary. In turn, this implies that much of the body of knowledge for the current information systems discipline can be organized around a work system core. Specific information systems exist to support (other) work systems. Many different degrees of overlap are possible between an information system and a work system that it supports. For example, an information system might provide information for a non-overlapping work system, as happens when a commercial marketing survey provides information to a firm's marketing managers In other cases, an information system may be an integral part of a work system, as happens in highly automated manufacturing and in ecommerce web sites. In these situations, participants in the work system are also participants in the information system, the work system cannot operate properly without the information system, and the information system has little significance outside of the work system.  Work system framework  The work system approach for understanding systems includes both a static view of a current (or proposed) system in operation and a dynamic view of how a system evolves over time through planned change and unplanned adaptations. The static view is summarized by the work system framework, which identifies the basic elements for understanding and evaluating a work system. An easily recognized triangular representation of the work system framework has appeared in Alter (2002, 2003, 2008, 2013) and elsewhere. The work system itself consists of four elements: the processes and activities, participants, information, and technologies. Five other elements must be included in even a rudimentary understanding of a work system's operation, context, and significance. Those elements are the products/services produced, customers, environment, infrastructure, and strategies. Customers may also be participants in a work system, as happens when a doctor examines a patient. This framework is prescriptive enough to be useful in describing the system being studied, identifying problems and opportunities, describing possible changes, and tracing how those changes might affect other parts of the work system. The definitions of the 9 elements of the work system framework are as follows: Processes and activities include everything that happens within the work system. The term processes and activities is used instead of the term business process because many work systems do not contain highly structured business processes involving a prescribed sequence of steps, each of which is triggered in a pre-defined manner. Such processes are sometimes described as ‚Äúartful processes‚Äù whose sequence and content ‚Äúdepend on the skills, experience, and judgment of the primary actors.‚Äù (Hill et al., 2006) In effect, business process is but one of a number of different perspectives for analyzing the activities within a work system. Other perspectives with their own valuable concepts and terminology include decision-making, communication, coordination, control, and information processing. Participants are people who perform the work. Some may use computers and IT extensively, whereas others may use little or no technology. When analyzing a work system the more encompassing role of work system participant is more important than the more limited role of technology user (whether or not particular participants happen to be technology users). In work systems that are viewed as service systems, it is especially important to identify activities in which customers are participants. Information includes codified and non-codified information used and created as participants perform their work. Information may or may not be computerized. Data not related to the work system is not directly relevant, making the distinction between data and information secondary when describing or analyzing a work system. Knowledge can be viewed as a special case of information. Technologies include tools (such as cell phones, projectors, spreadsheet software, and automobiles) and techniques (such as management by objectives, optimization, and remote tracking) that work system participants use while doing their work. Products/services are the combination of physical things, information, and services that the work system produces for its customers' benefit and use. This may include physical products, information products, services, intangibles such as enjoyment and peace of mind, and social products such as arrangements, agreements, and organizations. The term \\"products/services‚Äù is used because the distinction between products and services in marketing and service science (Chesbrough and Spohrer, 2006) is not important for understanding work systems even though product-like vs. service-like is the basis of a series of design dimensions for characterizing and designing the things that a work system produces (Alter, 2012). Customers are people who receive direct benefit from products/services the work system produces. Since work systems exist to produce products/services for their customers, an analysis of a work system should consider who the customers are, what they want, and how they use whatever the work system produces. Customers may include external customers who receive an enterprise's products/services and internal customers who are employed by the enterprise, such as customers of a payroll work system. Customers of a work system often are participants in the work system (e.g., patients in a medical exam, students in an educational setting, and clients in a consulting engagement). Environment includes the organizational, cultural, competitive, technical, and regulatory environment within which the work system operates. These factors affect system performance even though the system does not rely on them directly in order to operate. The organization's general norms of behavior are part of its culture, whereas more specific behavioral norms and expectations about specific activities within the work system are considered part of its processes and activities. Infrastructure includes human, informational, and technical resources that the work system relies on even though these resources exist and are managed outside of it and are shared with other work systems. Technical infrastructure includes computer networks, programming languages, and other technologies shared by other work systems and often hidden or invisible to work system participants. From an organizational viewpoint such as that expressed in Star and Bowker (2002) rather than a purely technical viewpoint, infrastructure includes human infrastructure, informational infrastructure, and technical infrastructure, all of which can be essential to a work system's operation and therefore should be considered in any analysis of a work system. Strategies include the strategies of the work system and of the department(s) and enterprise(s) within which the work system exists. Strategies at the department and enterprise level may help in explaining why the work system operates as it does and whether it is operating properly.  Work system life cycle model  The dynamic view of a work system starts with the work system life cycle (WSLC) model, which shows how a work system may evolve through multiple iterations of four phases: operation and maintenance, initiation, development, and implementation. The names of the phases were chosen to describe both computerized and non-computerized systems, and to apply regardless of whether application software is acquired, built from scratch, or not used at all. The terms development and implementation have business- oriented meanings that are consistent with Markus and Mao's (2004) distinction between system development and system implementation. This model encompasses both planned and unplanned change. Planned change occurs through a full iteration encompassing the four phases, i.e., starting with an operation and maintenance phase, flowing through initiation, development, and implementation, and arriving at a new operation and maintenance phase. Unplanned change occurs through fixes, adaptations, and experimentation that can occur within any phase. The phases include the following activities:  Operation and maintenance  * Operation of the work system and monitoring of its performance * Maintenance of the work system (which often includes at least part of information systems that support it) by identifying small flaws and eliminating or minimizing them through fixes, adaptations, or workarounds. * On-going improvement of processes and activities through analysis, experimentation, and adaptation  Initiation  * Vision for the new or revised work system * Operational goals * Allocation of resources and clarification of time frames * Economic, organizational, and technical feasibility of planned changes  Development  * Detailed requirements for the new or revised work system (including requirements for information systems that support it) * As necessary, creation, acquisition, configuration, and modification of procedures, documentation, training material, software and hardware * Debugging and testing of hardware, software, and documentation  Implementation  * Implementation approach and plan (pilot? phased? big bang?) * Change management efforts about rationale and positive or negative impacts of changes * Training on details of the new or revised information system and work system * Conversion to the new or revised work system * Acceptance testing As an example of the iterative nature of a work system's life cycle, consider the sales system in a software start-up. The first sales system is the CEO selling directly. At some point the CEO can't do it alone, several salespeople are hired and trained, and marketing materials are produced that can be used by someone less expert than the CEO. As the firm grows, the sales system becomes regionalized and an initial version of sales tracking software is developed and used. Later, the firm changes its sales system again to accommodate needs to track and control a larger salesforce and predict sales several quarters in advance. A subsequent iteration might involve the acquisition and configuration of CRM software. The first version of the work system starts with an initiation phase. Each subsequent iteration involves deciding that the current sales system is insufficient; initiating a project that may or may not involve significant changes in software; developing the resources such as procedures, training materials, and software that are needed to support the new version of the work system; and finally, implementing the new work system. The pictorial representation of the work system life cycle model places the four phases at the vertices of rectangle. Forward and backward arrows between each successive pair of phases indicate the planned sequence of the phases and allow the possibility of returning to a previous phase if necessary. To encompass both planned and unplanned change, each phase has an inward facing arrow to denote unanticipated opportunities and unanticipated adaptations, thereby recognizing the importance of diffusion of innovation, experimentation, adaptation, emergent change, and path dependence. The work system life cycle model is iterative and includes both planned and unplanned change. It is fundamentally different from the frequently cited Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which actually describes projects that attempt to produce software or produce changes in a work system. Current versions of the SDLC may contain iterations but they are basically iterations within a project. More important, the system in the SDLC is a basically a technical artifact that is being programmed. In contrast, the system in the WSLC is a work system that evolves over time through multiple iterations. That evolution occurs through a combination of defined projects and incremental changes resulting from small adaptations and experimentation. In contrast with control-oriented versions of the SDLC, the WSLC treats unplanned changes as part of a work system's natural evolution.  Work system method  The work system method (Alter, 2002; 2006; 2013) is a method that business professionals (and/or IT professionals) can use for understanding and analyzing a work system at whatever level of depth is appropriate for their particular concerns. It has evolved iteratively starting in around 1997. At each stage, the then current version was tested by evaluating the areas of success and the difficulties experienced by MBA and EMBA students trying to use it for a practical purpose. A version called ‚Äúwork-centered analysis‚Äù that was presented in a textbook has been used by a number of universities as part of the basic explanation of systems in organizations, to help students focus on business issues, and to help student teams communicate. Ramiller (2002) reports on using a version of the work system framework within a method for ‚Äúanimating‚Äù the idea of business process within an undergraduate class. In a research setting, Petrie (2004) used the work system framework as a basic analytical tool in a Ph.D. thesis examining 13 ecommerce web sites. Petkov and Petkova (2006) demonstrated the usefulness of the work system framework by comparing grades of students who did and did not learn about the framework before trying to interpret the same ERP case study. More recent evidence of the practical value of a work system approach is from Truex et al. (2010, 2011), which summarized results from 75 and later 300 management briefings produced by employed MBA students based on a work system analysis template. These briefings contained the kind of analysis that would be discussed in the initiation phase of the WSLC, as decisions were being made about which projects to pursue and how to proceed. Results from analyses of real world systems by typical employed MBA and EMBA students indicate that a systems analysis method for business professionals must be much more prescriptive than soft systems methodology (Checkland, 1999). While not a straitjacket, it must be at least somewhat procedural and must provide vocabulary and analysis concepts while at the same time encouraging the user to perform the analysis at whatever level of detail is appropriate for the task at hand. The latest version of the work system method is organized around a general problem- solving outline that includes: * Identify the problem or opportunity * Identify the work system that has that problem or opportunity (plus relevant constraints and other considerations) * Use the work system framework to summarize the work system * Gather relevant data. * Analyze using design characteristics, measures of performance, and work system principles. * Identify possibilities for improvement. * Decide what to recommend * Justify the recommendation using relevant metrics and work system principles. In contrast to systems analysis and design methods for IT professionals who need to produce a rigorous, totally consistent definition of a computerized system, the work system method: * encourages the user to decide how deep to go * makes explicit use of the work system framework and work system life cycle model * makes explicit use of work system principles. * makes explicit use of characteristics and metrics for the work system and its elements. * includes work system participants as part of the system (not just users of the software) * includes codified and non-codified information * includes IT and non-IT technologies. * suggests that recommendations specify which work system improvements rely on IS changes, which recommended work system changes don't rely on IS changes, and which recommended IS changes won't affect the work system's operational form.

The firm is one of the world's three largest strategy consulting firms by revenue, often considered by some to be the most prestigious firms in the management consulting industry. History The firm was founded in 1963 by Bruce Henderson as part of The Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company. Henderson had been recruited from Arthur D. Little to establish the consulting arm operating as a subsidiary under the name Management and Consulting Division of the Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company. Initially the division only advised clients of the bank, with billings for the first month at just US$500. Henderson hired his second consultant, Arthur P. Contas, in December 1963. In 1966, BCG opened its second office in Tokyo, Japan. In 1967, Henderson met Bill Bain and offered him a role at the firm. Bain agreed and joined in 1967 at a starting salary of $17,000 per year. In the early 1970s, Bain was considered internally to be Henderson's eventual successor. However, in 1973 Bain resigned from BCG to start his own strategy consulting firm, Bain & Company, hiring away six of BCG's employees. In 1974, Henderson arranged an employee stock ownership plan so that the employees could make the company independent from The Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company. The buyout of all shares was completed in 1979. Corporate culture In 2019, BCG ranked #10 on Fortune‚Äôs ‚Äú100 Best Companies to Work For‚Äù. Working Mother magazine recognized BCG as a 2019 Working Mother 100 Best Companies for the thirteenth time, highlighting the firm's paid family leave policies and flexible work options. BCG was also recognized as 2019 Best Companies for Dads and 2020 NAFE Top Companies for Executive Women. Human Rights Campaign recognized the firm as among the best places to work for LGBT Equality in 2020. Recruiting BCG typically hires for an associate or a consultant position, recruiting from top undergraduate colleges and business schools. The firm also offers summer internships. Insiders estimate that BCG North American offices receive around 10,000 resumes every year for the associate position.https://mconsultingprep.com/bcg-case-interview/ Senior associates have the opportunity to work abroad through BCG's exchange program. Many associates are also sponsored by the firm to attend business school. As is typical for the top strategy consultancies, BCG practices an \\"up or out,\\" or forced attrition, system, in which employees must leave the company if they fail to achieve a promotion within a fixed time frame. Interview process BCG uses the case method to conduct interviews. This technique is designed to simulate the types of problems inherent in management consulting and to test the qualitative and quantitative skills deemed important for abstract thinking in a business setting. Generally, the interview process consists of two rounds. BCG growth-share matrix 180px In the 1970s, BCG created and popularized the \\"growth‚Äìshare matrix,\\" a chart to help large corporations decide how to allocate cash among their business units. The corporation would categorize its business units as \\"Stars,\\" \\"Cash Cows,\\" \\"Question Marks,\\" or \\"Dogs,\\" and then allocate cash accordingly, moving money from Cash Cows toward Stars and Question Marks, which have higher market growth rates and hence greater upside potential.  BCG extended business units = BCG Digital Ventures  BCG Digital Ventures partners with companies to research, design, and launch new products and services.

Controversy = Angola  An article published by The New York Times on January 19, 2020 identified the Boston Consulting Group as having facilitated Isabel dos Santos's exploitation of Angola's natural resources while the country suffers from poverty, illiteracy, and infant mortality. According to the article, BCG was contracted by the Angolan state- owned petroleum company Sonangol, as well as the jewelry company De Grisogono, owned by her husband through shell companies in Luxembourg, Malta and the Netherlands; the firm was reportedly paid through offshore companies in tax havens such as Malta.  Saudi Arabia  The New York Times also reported that Boston Consulting Group is one of the consulting firms, along with McKinsey and Booz Allen, helping Prince Mohammed bin Salman consolidate power in Saudi Arabia. While a BCG spokesperson said the firm turns down projects involving military and intelligence strategy, BCG is involved in designing the economic blueprint for the country, a plan called Vision 2030.  Sweden  Boston Consulting Group has received substantial criticism for their involvement in the construction of the The New Karolinska Solna University Hospital after an investigation by Dagens Nyheter. Specifically the potential conflict of interest where a former BCG employee and then hospital executive approved numerous expenses without proper receipts and the high cost paid for external consultants including BCG. In the investigative journalism book Konsulterna - Kampen om Karolinska (roughly The Consultants - The Struggle for the Karolinska University Hospital), the authors and Dagens Nyheter journalists Anna Gustavsson and Lisa R√∂stlund argue that the value-based health care model as recommended by BCG had not been properly investigated and have resulted in an exponential growth in administration and lack of responsibility for patients.

The impact event  At 11:40:14 local time (16:40:14 GMT) on 15 September 2007, a chondritic meteorite crashed near the village of Carancas in the Puno Region, Peru, near the Bolivian border and Lake Titicaca (see map box on right). The impact created a crater larger than deep, wide, with visibly scorched earth around the impact site. A local official, Marco Limache, said that \\"boiling water started coming out of the crater, and particles of rock and cinders were found nearby\\", as \\"fetid, noxious\\" gases spewed from the crater. The crater size was given as , with its greatest dimensions in an east-west direction. The fireball had been observed by the locals as strongly luminous with a smoky tail, and seen from just above the ground. The object moved in a direction toward N030E. The small seismic shock of the impact shattered the windows of the local health center away. A smoke column was formed at the site that lasted several minutes, and gas was seen bubbling up in the water in the crater. One villager was as close as from the impact site. He fell from his bicycle but was not injured. A small building from the impact site did not suffer much either besides roof damage from flying debris. Soon after the impact, more than 600 villagers visited the site and some began to fall ill from unexplained causes, including symptoms of dermal injuries, nausea, headaches, diarrhea and vomiting. On 20 September, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had been a meteorite strike, but no further information on the cause of the illnesses was known.Ed Sutherland.

The ground water in the area is known to contain arsenic compounds, and the illness was believed to have been caused by arsenic poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water. However, further investigations have led to the conclusion that the arsenic content in the groundwater did not differ from that of the local drinking supply, and that the illness reported was likely caused by the vaporization of troilite, a sulfur-bearing compound present within the meteorite in large amounts, which would have melted at relatively low temperatures and high pressures created by such an impact.

The release of the document to the public was delayed for one week. The researchers found that the fragments from the crater zone had a chondritic texture and the following mineral composition: pyroxene (1) 40%, olivine 20%, feldspar 10%, pyroxene (2) 10%; kamacite 15%, troilite 5%, and traces of chromite and native copper. Kamacite occurs naturally only in meteorites. The official classification of the Carancas meteorite, accepted by the Meteoritical Society,Meteoritical Bulletin: Entry for Carancas was done by a team of scientists working at the University of Arizona. The meteorite is an ordinary chondrite, an H chondrite breccia, containing clasts of petrologic types 4 to 5. The formal classification is H4-5. The meteoroid had experienced a considerable amount of shock before its ultimate encounter with Earth. Further data were expected from NASA, along with British and Japanese researchers, who intended on looking into the matter.Luisa Macedo F. & Jos√© Machar√© O., INGEMMET, \\"The Carancas Meteorite Fall, 15 September 2007\\", 21 September 2007.

Four days after the meteorite impact and the unexplained illness, most villagers reported having recovered.Jos√© Orozco. Reported details about the event, such as water boiling in the muddy crater for ten minutes from the heat of the impact, presented a problem for experts. Because the impact site is at a high altitude of more than , the meteoroid may not have been slowed down as much as it ordinarily would have been by passage through the Earth's denser lower atmosphere, and kinetic energy at impact may have been unusually high for a terrestrial impact of an object of this size and mass. Most larger meteorites are cold in their bulk mass when they land on Earth, since their heated outer layers ablate from the objects before impacting. It was later confirmed that the meteorite contained a large amount of iron and possessed magnetic properties common to similar metallic objects, which contributed to its capacity to retain heat during atmospheric entry.Living in Peru, LIP-ir, \\"Astrophysicist in Peru Identifies Properties in Meteorite\\" , September 21, 2007, 17:00.

Don Yeomans, head of the Near Earth Object Program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said, \\"Statistically, it's far more likely to have come from below than from above. The noxious fumes that have supposedly sickened curious locals who went to examine the crater would seem to indicate hydrothermal activity, such as a local gas explosion, because meteorites don't give off odors.\\" By 21 September, it was believed that the illness was caused by arsenic poisoning. Luisa Macedo of Peru's Mining, Metallurgy, and Geology Institute said gases were created when the meteorite's hot surface reacted with an underground water supply tainted with arsenic. Natural arsenic deposits in ground water are not uncommon in southern Peru. Jos√© Ishitsuka of the Peruvian Geophysics Institute said, \\"If the meteorite arrives incandescent and at a high temperature because of ram pressure, hitting water can create a column of steam.\\" Meteorites, however, often impact the earth at low temperatures, making this an unusual event.

The term is used by landscape historians and in the National Curriculum[http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/local/secondary/docs/geo9.doc Geography, Year 8, for England. The term is also used in the planning system for the UK and for some other countries such as Ireland, India and Switzerland. The term was used without comment by the geographer Brian Roberts in 1972.B. K. Roberts, Village plans in County Durham, (Medieval Archaeology, Volume XVI, 1972) Overview In Europe, centuries-old settlements were surrounded by farmland and tended not to be wider than 30 minutes' walk from one end to the other, with wealthier people monopolizing the \\"town center\\", while poorer people lived on the town's outskirts or nearby countryside (the \\"sphere of influence\\"). With the advent of decentralization technologies (i.e., bicycles, trains, cars, etc.), American settlements reversed this trend before reaching their saturation point, with vast farmlands managed by homesteads located dozens of miles away from the nearest settlement; lower- income communities occupied the \\"center\\" as the middle-income and upper-income migrated into suburbia, and this created a phenomenon known as urban decay. A settlement's population size, its geographic area, its status and the availability of services can all affect this hierarchy. Position in a settlement hierarchy can also depend on the sphere of influence. This is how far people will travel to use the services in the settlement: if people travel further the town becomes more important and ranks higher in the settlement hierarchy.  Problems with concept of a settlement hierarchy  Using size of a settlement can be misleading in some cases as not all population boundaries fit. Some cities (e.g., Norwich, England) have a smaller population than some towns (e.g., Luton, England). In addition, there is no agreement as to the number of levels in the hierarchy or what they should be called. Many terms used to describe settlements (e.g., village) have no legal definition, or may have contradictory legal definitions in different jurisdictions.  Hierarchy and status  Position in an accepted settlement hierarchy can imply statusMichael Aston, Interpreting the Landscape (Routledge, reprinted 1998, page 44) which in turn reinforces the position of the settlement in the hierarchy. Status can derive from being the residence of a King or high- ranking member of the nobility or from being the location of a major religious establishment. A formal hierarchy of settlements, known as a multiple estate appears to have been common in 10th century England.Andrew Reynolds, Later Anglo-Saxon England (Tempus, paperback edition 2002, page 81) The centre of an estate (often called a \\"caput\\") could be supported by subsidiary settlements sometimes given specialised roles. For example, a Saxon royal estate might be supported by settlements specialising in production of cheese or barley or maintaining flocks of sheep.Della Hooke, The Landscape of Anglo-Saxon England (Leicester University Press, reprinted 2001, page 52)  Example of a settlement hierarchy  In this example, a roadhouse is at the lowest level while the ecumenopolis is at the top with the greatest number of residents:Doxiadis, Konstantinos Ekistics 1968 This is only an example, and in other contexts, the population criteria for each category of settlement might be different. Note: This settlement hierarchy is adapted from the work of Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis for the actual current world situation as of 2010 as opposed to Doxiadis' idealized settlement hierarchy for the year 2100 that he outlined in his 1968 book Ekistics.  Extreme density  More than one billion residents. * Ecumenopolis - a theoretical construction in which the entire area of Earth is taken up by human settlements, or at least, that those are linked so that to create urban areas so big that they can shape an urban continuum through thousands of kilometers which cannot be considered as a megalopolis. As of the year 2009, the United Nations estimated that for the first time more than 50% of the world's populations lived in cities, so if these were linked, the total population of this area would be about 3,400,000,000 people as of 2010.  High density  More than one million residents. At this density, the settlement's population and GDP tends to exceed that of most countries with lesser density. The need for administrative divisions, public transportation, public infrastructure and other government public services is critically essential for the sustainable growth and continued prosperity of its citizens. The first city in recorded history to reach a population of one million residents was Ancient Rome in 133 B.C. During the Second Industrial Revolution, London, England reached the mark in 1810 and New York City, United States made it in 1875. * Megalopolis or Megacity - a supercity consists of a group of conurbations, containing more than ten million residents in total. * Conurbation or Global city - an extremely large city consists of a group of metropolises, containing between three and ten million residents. * Metropolis or Municipality - a very large city with its suburbs consisting of multiple satellite cities and towns. The population is usually between one and three million people.  Medium density  Less than one million residents. At this density, viable access to advanced services due to economies of scale being abundant. * Regiopolis or City - a large city with a large population and many services. The population is less than one million but over 300,000 people. * Prefecture or County - a medium city which has abundant services, but not as many as a large city. The population is between 100,000 and 300,000 people. * Borough or District- a small city that functions as a type of municipality or subdivision of a consolidated city. The population is usually similar to a large town.  Low density  Less than one hundred thousand residents. Common \\"city features\\" and services such as clinics, police, fire station, schools, residential neighborhoods, etc. become more prominent. Density is sufficient to support local commercial areas which may include a \\"Main Street\\" or a shopping mall. * Town or Shire - a large town which has a population between 10,000 and 100,000. * Township or Subdistrict - a medium town which has a population between 1,000 and 10,000. * Suburb or Locality - a small mixed-use town or residential area, existing either as a part of a city or urban area or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city.What is a suburb?  Minuscule density  Less than one thousand residents. At this number, settlements are too small or scattered to be considered \\"urban\\", and services within these settlements (if any) are generally limited to bare essentials: i.e., church, grocery store, post office, etc. Throughout most of human history, very few settlements could support a population greater than 150 people. * Village or Tribe - a village is a human settlement or community that is larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town. The population of a village varies; the average population can range in the hundreds. Anthropologists regard the number of about 150 specimens for tribes as the maximum for a functioning human group. * Hamlet or Band - a hamlet has a tiny population (less than 100), with only a few buildings. A social band are the simplest level of foraging societies with generally a maximum size of 30 to 50 people; consisting of a small kin group, no larger than an extended family or clan. * Homestead or Neighbourhood - a homestead usually consists of a cluster of isolated dwellings normally occupied by a single extended family, normally would only have one to five buildings or elementary families. * Roadhouse or Bed and breakfast - a roadhouse is a small mixed-use premises typically built on or near a major road in a sparsely populated area or an isolated desert region that services the passing travellers, providing food, drinks, accommodation, fuel and parking spaces to the guests and their vehicles. The premises generally consists of just a single dwelling, permanently occupied by a nuclear family, usually between two and five family members. A roadhouse is often considered to be the smallest type of human settlement.I spent the night in Australia's smallest town. Here's what I saw Settlement hierarchy by country=Settlement hierarchy in the UK planning system The position of a settlement in the hierarchy is intended to inform decisions about new developments such as housing. Rather than define the hierarchy by population, an alternative way to construct the hierarchy is based on the services that are available within each settlement. Settlements are described as \\"level 1\\", \\"level 2\\", etc. rather than using terms such as village or town.EERA planning map The Government planning statement (PPS3) does not specifically mention \\"settlement hierarchies\\", but talks about the availability of services to small rural settlements. The term is used a number of times in the guidance for preparing evidence for planning decisions; a settlement hierarchy starts with an isolated dwelling, then hamlet, then village, town, city then a conurbation. Settlement hierarchy in the German planning system The German planning system is based on the Central Place Theory developed by Walter Christaller in the 1930s and first applied in the Nazi Era, especially in Poland. Every settlement is categorized by function: highly central cities (e.g. Hamburg, with speciality clinics for tropical diseases), middle central cities (for periodic functions e.g. Homburg (Saar) with major schools (starting at 5th grade)) and basic central towns /Unterzentrum (e.g. Illingen with basic doctors and upermarket). The number of inhabitants is less important: thus a city such as Kaiserslautern (100,000 people) can be a highly specialized city, because it is a centre for the surrounding rural area. It is used at the federal level for the regional planning system of states and planning regions for the \\"State Development Programmes\\" (Landesentwicklungsprogramm [de]) and the \\"Regional Spatial Structure Plans\\" (Regionaler Raumordnungsplamn [de]). These are political plans to achieve goals such as equivalent living standards (Gleichwertige Lebensverh√§ltnisse [de]) in rural and urban areas in all of Germany, east and west.

The bulk of UCLA's student body belongs to the College, which includes 34 academic departments, 21,000 undergraduate students, 2,700 graduate students and 900 faculty members. Virtually all of the academic programs in the College are ranked very highly and 11 were ranked in the top ten nationally by the National Research Council. The College originated on May 23, 1919, the day when the Governor of California (William D. Stephens) signed a bill into law which officially established the Southern Branch of the University of California. At that time, a College of Letters and Science (named after its northern counterpart at Berkeley) was established as the university's general undergraduate program and it began to hold classes the following September with only 250 students in the college. At its inception, the College originally offered only a two-year lower-division program, making it a glorified junior college. Young people interested in four years of college were required to proceed to the Berkeley campus or other universities to attend upper-division courses. The inferior two-year program was intolerable to the many Southern Californians who had fought to establish the southern branch. They vigorously lobbied the Regents of the University of California for a third year of courses at the southern branch, which was then followed by demands for a fourth year. The Southern Californians ultimately prevailed, and in 1925, the College awarded its first bachelor's degrees. A milestone occurred in 1927 when the southern branch was officially renamed the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), although UCLA would have to wait until 1951 to achieve de jure coequal status with UC Berkeley and 1957 to achieve true de facto equality.

Founded in 1872, they are the oldest club in Bristol. They are currently members of the and play at Oaklands Park, South Gloucestershire. The club is affiliated to the Gloucestershire County FA. History The club was formed in 1872 and sometimes playing as just St George or as Bristol St George, they were among the founder members of the original Bristol & District League (since 1895 known as the Western League) in 1892, playing in that league with the exception of 1899‚Äì1901 until 1903. During that period, the team also played in the Birmingham & District League and won the Gloucestershire FA Senior Challenge Cup on two occasions 1894 and 1895. After dropping back to local football, they did not re-appear in the Western League until 1928, for a seven-season period in Division Two, when they only finished in the top half of the table once. After finishing bottom in 1934‚Äì35, they once again left the Western League for the Bristol and District League. They won the first division in 1949/50 and became founder members of the Bristol Premier Combination in 1957. During the 1960s, the club while playing in the Bristol Premier Combination, won the Division One title five seasons in a row from 1963‚Äì68. In 1968, the Gloucestershire County League was formed, with St George among the founder members. They were runners-up in the first season, winning the title in 1969‚Äì70 and finished as runners-up again in 1972‚Äì73. Despite staying in the league for a further fourteen seasons (including three when known as Immediate Bristol St George), they did not finish in the top two again until being expelled from the league in 1987 due to sub standard facilities. The club played in the County of Avon Premier Combination, winning Division One in 1988‚Äì90, finishing as Premier Division runners-up on 1990‚Äì91 and eventually won the Premier Division two years later. However, despite winning the Premier Division the club was not promoted and over the next few seasons were in danger of folding. Roman Glass merger In 1995 St George amalgamated with local side Roman Glass, forming Roman Glass St George F.C. Roman Glass originated as a street team called Wyndham Wanderers in 1960 and played in the Bristol Church of England League until joining the Bristol and District League in 1974. The club enjoyed moderate success gradually climbing the leagues and in 1980 changed its name to Roman Glass. The club began to decline until in 1990 Roger Hudd took over as manager and won the Division 4 title and then gaining successive promotions until the amalgamation with Bristol St George. The amalgamation enjoyed instant success with the club achieving promotion back to the Premier Division in the 1995‚Äì96 season. They then joined the Gloucestershire County League in 1999, and within three seasons had won that league as well. Another County League triumph in 2006‚Äì07 earned them a further promotion to the Western League Division One for 2007‚Äì08, where in their first season, the club finished safely in mid-table. They have remained in Division One ever since. Ground Roman Glass St George play their home games at Oaklands Park, Gloucester Road, Almondsbury, BS32 4AG.

He was one of the group of young Normans whom David I gathered around him from Henry I of England's area of influence in northern France;Barrow,1973, p321 he was therefore likely of a similar age to David. As David's tenant, Ranulf held Great Doddington on the former's Honour of Huntingdon.Barrow,1973 p.325 His ties to Great Doddington are confirmed when, as a settler in Scotland, he later granted the Church of Great Doddington,(Ecclesiam de Dodintona juxta Bertonam) to Jedburgh Abbey. He apparently accompanied David to Cumbria around 1112 when the latter was essentially governor or titular earl of that region under England's King Henry and was encouraged by David to build Liddel Castle in Liddesdale to control that unruly area. According to Tranter,Tranter, David the Prince, p.188, p.235 in one of his historical novels, Ranulf was with David at the Battle of the Standard in 1138. Ranulf de Soulis built Liddel Castle, a motte and bailey structure, at the junction of the Liddel and Esk rivers. This castle, the earthworks of which remain, therefore was probably built around 1115-1118, although apparently the first written mention of it was in an 1165 charter that William the Lion granted to the Canons of Jedburgh Abbey. It is not to be confused with nearby Hermitage Castle, a later structure, or with Liddel Strength that was built in the same region, but just within England, by Turgot de Rossedale, from a Yorkshire family. Cupbearer David appointed him as his Cup-bearer, the first person in the Norman tradition to hold that office in Scotland; after David's death he was cupbearer to Malcolm IV and later to William the Lion in the early part of his reign. The cupbearer (pincernaOwen, p.10 or butler) was not a major official at court, but it and other similar appointments gave their possessors influence at court and in affairs of state beyond the duties implied by their titles. Essentially, they became confidants and advisors to the King. The court was highly mobile in these times and court officials, such as the cupbearer, would often accompany the King on his excursions. Ranulf de Soulis witnessed a number of David's, and later Malcolm IV's and William's charters.Robertson, p.285 Legacy According to Laurie,Laurie 1905 p.309 Ranulf died shortly before 1170. He was succeeded as Lord of Liddesdale by his nephew, who was also named Ranulf and who was the son of his brother, William.

Premise Set after World War I in Boston's fashionable Beacon Hill area, the show focused on the wealthy Lassiter family in contrast to their Irish immigrant servants, who reside together on Louisburg Square. It was considered to be an Americanized version of the popular British series Upstairs, Downstairs (1971‚Äì1975), which shared the same premise. It was produced by Jacqueline Babbin and Beryl Vertue, the latter of whom was a former literary agent of Jean Marsh who had been instrumental in getting Upstairs, Downstairs on television. Cast and characters The show starred Stephen Elliott as patriarch Ben Lassiter, who worked as the \\"grey eminence\\" at Boston City Hall, and Nancy Marchand as his wife Mary, who was wealthy in her own right before marrying him. Other family members included Maeve McGuire as Maude Lassiter Palmer, the oldest daughter; Edward Herrmann as Maude's husband, Richard Palmer, a yachtsman; DeAnn Mears as Emily Lassiter Bullock, the emotionally reserved (and somewhat snobbish) middle daughter; Roy Cooper as Trevor Bullock, Emily's husband who was a stockbroker; Linda Purl as Betsy Bullock, Trevor and Emily's daughter; Kitty Winn as Rosamond Lassiter, the \\"Plain Jane\\" daughter who resented being in the shadow of her more beautiful sisters but proved herself to be a whiz at the family businesses; Kathryn Walker as Fawn Lassiter, the maverick, independent, and artistic youngest daughter; Michael Nouri as Giorgio Bellonci, Fawn's music teacher; and David Dukes as the only son, Robert Lassiter, who was wounded (losing an arm) in World War I and was still traumatized by his injuries. The servants were Beatrice Straight as their head housemaid, Mrs. Emmeline Hacker; George Rose as the Lassiter butler (and Emmeline's husband), Arthur Hacker; Susan Blanchard as Maureen Mahaffey, an under maid, and Emmeline's niece; Paul Ryan Rudd as Brian Mallory, Emmeline's nephew and the Lassiter family's chauffeur; Barry Snider as Harry Emmet, the former chauffeur, who was fired for stealing money from the Lassiter family; David Rounds as Terence O'Hara, Hacker's assistant; Richard Ward as William Piper, the family cook; Don Blakely as Grant Piper (William's son); and Holland Taylor as Marilyn Gardiner, Mrs. Lassiter's personal assistant/secretary. Production and reception The first episode cost $900,000 to produce, and the music was composed by Marvin Hamlisch. Christopher Schemering of The Soap Opera Encyclopedia called Beacon Hill \\"the most touted prime-time soap since the Lana Turner-George Hamilton debacle The Survivors\\". The series premiered on August 25, 1975 with an \\"impressive audience\\" of \\"43% of people watching TV\\" that evening, but it could not sustain those ratings. Schemering wrote that \\"the overly large cast and fragmented stories did not allow the audience to get its bearings.\\" Beacon Hill was cancelled after 11 episodes had aired (its final air date was November 4, 1975), with two completed shows never broadcast.

Giovanni Quagliata (1603‚Äì1673) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. He is more properly known in Italy as Giovan Battista Quagliata (and Giambattista Quagliata), one of the leading artists of the Messinesi painters of the 17th century, as described by Francesco Susinno in his book \\"The Lives of the Messinesi Painters\\" published in 1724. Giovanni was born in Messina, Italy. He was a pupil of Pietro da Cortona and enjoyed the patronage and friendship of the Spanish Viceroy of Sicily, Don Juan Jos√© of Austria (Viceroy from 1649‚Äì1651; also known as John of Austria the Younger). Giovanni's brother, Andrea Quagliata (born in 1594 or 1599, and died in 1660), was also an historical painter, but of lesser significance. Giovanni's works ‚Äì paintings, frescoes and large canvases ‚Äì were famously displayed in the galleries and churches of Messina, but due to earthquakes from Mount Etna and wartime bombings, few have survived to the present day. Biography Giovanni's father, Giovan Domenico Quagliata, was a painter who lived in Rome in the late 16th century. He was an artist of talent, but not greatness. Unfortunately, we don't have the details of Giovan Domenico's birth, but a reasonable estimate would be 1570. His birthplace remains a mystery. If he was born on the mainland, it's highly likely he was part of the Quagliata family located in Balvano. Possibly looking for a better market for his talent and art, Giovan Domenico moved from Rome to the growing trade center of Messina, arriving in Sicily in the late 16th century. Unfortunately Susinno does not cite the works of Giovan Domenico. Sometime before 1600, Giovan Domenico married a woman from Messina named Francesca LeDonne and together they had children. We know of two sons: Andrea Quagliata born in 1594 (or in 1599, and died in 1660) and Giovan Battista Quagliata born in 1603 (1603‚Äì1673, also known as Giovanni Quagliata). Andrea became a student of his father and was a capable painter. Giovanni was directed by his parents to study letters, but his studies were interrupted by the premature death of the father. Andrea, by that time a professional painter, convinced his younger brother to attend his school where Giovanni does well. Andrea married, but apparently did not have children. Apparition of the Virgin Mary to Saint Paul above the altar at the Church of Santa Rita ‚Äì closeup. Giovanni helped his brother with household income by painting small pictures and portraits. Giovanni became so attracted by the art of painting that he decided to journey to Rome to attend the prestigious school of Pietro Berrenttini from Cortona (also known as Pietro da Cortona). As Giovanni continued his studies under Cortona, it soon became clear that he was more talented than both his father and his brother. About age 24, he married a Roman woman named Cinzia Conticelli. During those years in Rome he created many works documented in the registers of the parish of San Nicola in Arcione, and he became a member of the Academy of Saint Luke ‚Äì an association of artists in Rome, founded in 1593 for the purpose of elevating the work of \\"artists\\" above that of craftsman, which is still active today. At age 37, perhaps enticed by lucrative commissions, Giovanni returned to Messina in 1640. There he enjoyed the patronage of the Spanish Viceroy of Sicily, Don Juan Jos√© of Austria. The Viceroy became a student of Giovanni's and the two became friends. Then, Giovanni's first wife, Cinzia, died and sometime later he married Flavia Alias, sister of the famous mathematician of the Company of Gesu, Vincenzo Alias. Giovanni had at least two children ‚Äì two sons are known. Giovanni produced many famous works during this period. In time, Viceroy Don Juan Jos√© granted Giovanni Quagliata a noble title with a coat of arms and some land in the countryside area of Forza d'Agr√≤, Sicily, between the city and the sea, where the new city of Sant'Alessio Siculo later developed, and from where most of his descendants come. Giovanni's works ‚Äì paintings, frescoes and large canvasses ‚Äì were famously displayed in the galleries and churches of Messina, but due to earthquakes from Mount Etna and wartime bombings, few have survived to the present day. Surviving canvases include: 'The Apparition of the Virgin Mary to Saint Paul', 'The Sacrifice of Polissena', 'The Virgin Nativity', 'Immaculate Mary', and 'The Triumph of David'.

Hodler was a son of the Swiss painter Ferdinand Hodler, who after a period of poverty became suddenly very well-to-do, and Augustine Dupin. As a 16-year-old, Hector Hodler learned Esperanto with his classmate Edmond Privat, and founded soon afterward a club and the journal Juna Esperantisto (\\"The Young Esperantist\\"). The schoolbench was their editorial office for five years as they managed production, addressed copies and replied to correspondence. Sometime later they learned about Idiom Neutral and about Bolak, in order to convince themselves as to whether Esperanto was truly the \\"best\\" international language. Besides The Young Esperantist, he authored articles in Through the World and the translation of the novel Paul et Virginie (Paul and Virginia) by Bernardin de Saint Pierre (1905). In 1906, on the occasion of the second World Congress of Esperanto organised by Hodler and Privat (born in 1889), he saw in the organizational proposals by Th√©ophile Rousseau and Alphonse Carles for Esperanto consuls (konsuloj) a chance to realize his plan to organize reciprocal self-help among people of good will. This was the germ of the Universal Esperanto Association (in Esperanto, UEA: Universala Esperanto-Asocio) of which Hodler was a co-founder. In 1907 he took over the editorship of Esperanto magazine from its founder Paul Berthelot and made it a significant journal dealing with organizational questions from the language community. Esperanto also included many articles about social life, similar to the present magazine Monato. He edited it for 13 years until his death, except for six months in 1914 during the First World War. It is still produced as a publication associated with the UEA. He authored and translated many important articles, and he suggested translating masterpieces instead of trivial things. He signed his articles with the initials A. R. The proposals of Rousseau and Carles were melded with his plans, were discussed in his magazine and received a warm welcome. By the third World Esperanto Congress in 1907, there were already about 200 consuls (delegates). Hodler and others such as Th√©ophile Rousseau founded the Universal Esperanto Association on 28 April 1908, and Hodler became General Director and Vice-President. He was a friend and colleague of Eduard Stettler, and Edmond Privat was one of his editors. Hodler wanted to use the magazine \\"to create a strong bond of solidarity among members of diverse languages.\\" During the war, Hodler, with the then secretary of the association Hans Jakob, organized the Wartime Assistance of the association. After the death of Harold Bolingbroke Mudie in 1916, the presidency of the World Esperanto Association was vacant until after the war, when Hodler was elected to succeed him. Hodler was especially interested in social questions, pacifism and animal protection. Privat wrote about him: \\"To that which the genius of Zamenhof initiated in the linguistic field, he added the necessary basis in the social field.\\" According to an article by L√°szl√≥ Halka in Enciklopedio de Esperanto, \\"it is characteristic of his noble spirit and humanity that in Geneva he joined the local animal protection society, and that he said he would like to make the UEA an association to protect humans.\\" In the last several years of his life, when he was already quite unhealthy, he turned mainly to scientific problems. In 1916 he wrote a 387-page work in French about the peaceful organization of peoples. After his death in 1920, he bequeathed to the UEA the magazine Esperanto and his Esperanto library, which nowadays bears his name, as well as a large sum of money to ensure its continued existence.

Rodeo Lagoon stretches approximately by , and is about deep at its maximum depth. It covers a surface area of about .  Inflows and outflows  Outlet channel of Rodeo Lagoon Rodeo Lagoon empties into the Pacific Ocean when the water level reaches a high enough level to erode through the sand bar. This high water level usually occurs in the winter months. The outlet channel, shown at left looking southeast towards Rodeo Lagoon, is spanned by a pedestrian bridge that provides access to Rodeo Beach. Like many other coastal lagoons in California, the outlet becomes completely blocked by a sand bar during the dry summer months, resulting in negligible exchange between the lagoon and ocean during that time. The depth, surface area, and volume of the lagoon all vary depending on the configuration of the sand berm (high or low) and rainfall (wet or dry). Depths in the center range from less than in a dry summer to nearly in a wet winter. Tides do not have a significant effect on the circulation of water in Rodeo Lagoon. Instead, the circulation of water in Rodeo Lagoon is driven almost entirely by the wind. Since the Marin Headlands are often quite windy, it is not unusual to see Langmuir circulation form windrows of foam on the surface of the lagoon.A. J. Szeri, 1996, Langmuir circulations on Rodeo Lagoon, Monthly Weather Review 124(2), 341-342. Rodeo Lagoon is a brackish water body, with salinities in most of the lagoon ranging from 2 to 10 practical salinity units (psu) over the course of the year. However, water near the bottom of the lagoon is often much saltier, reaching levels as high as 25 psu. The bowl-shaped bathymetry of the lagoon traps this dense, salty water and prevents it from quickly draining back out in the ocean. A brown pelican floating in Rodeo Lagoon  Wildlife  Rodeo Lagoon provides habitat to a protected species, the tidewater goby. It also provides habitat to many species of migrating waterfowl. Resident fish include the threespine stickleback and prickly sculpin in addition to the tidewater goby. A family of river otters also makes frequent use of the lagoon, and includes brown pelicans in their summer dietJ. Laws , Otter Chaos at Rodeo Lagoon, Bay Nature, July‚ÄìSeptember 2007 The lagoon is ringed by emergent aquatic vegetation, such as willows and cattail, and has submerged aquatic vegetation like sago pondweed and widgeon grass in the shallow areas. The phytoplankton community includes diatoms, chlorophytes, flagellated protozoa, Microcystis aeruginosa, and Nodularia spumigena. Microcystis sp. and Nodularia sp. are types of toxic cyanobacteria, capable of releasing the toxins microcystin and nodularin into the water.  Eutrophication  The population of phytoplankton described above is extremely high in the summer, a condition known as eutrophication. At times, the algae form a visible surface scum, and their high concentration results in large swings in the dissolved oxygen content of the water, culminating in a depletion of oxygen when the population finally crashes. This annual algae bloom, because of its size and potential toxicity, is considered problematic for water quality and fish survival. Cyanobacterial scum in Rodeo Lagoon Rodeo Lagoon typically suffers from an oxygen deficit or hypoxia in the summer and fall. This deficit is caused by the high oxygen consumption of decaying algae that occurs during that time of year. The large algae population, which withdraws carbon dioxide from the water, also raises the pH to very high levels. The pH is typically greater than 9 throughout the summer algae bloom.  Geology  The lagoon is located within the geologically complex Marin Headlands and fills a valley drowned by recent sea level rise following the last glacial period.National Park Service Geology of the Golden Gate Headlands Field Guide The bed of the lagoon is covered by viscous black mud that is high in organic content, except at the east and west ends, where non-organic sediment can be found.  History  Rodeo Lagoon was mostly unaltered until the area was developed by the U.S. military into Fort Cronkhite and Fort BarrySan Francisco Estuary Institute Wetland Habitat Changes in the Rodeo Lagoon Watershed, Marin County, CA, October 2004. In 1937, the Army constructed a road crossing at the east of the lagoon, which resulted in a reduction in the lagoon's size as the area upstream of the crossing gradually turned into a freshwater marsh. The lagoon is now about 80% of its original size.  Recreation  Recreation is not allowed on or in Rodeo Lagoon because of water quality and wildlife concerns. However, the lagoon and surrounding area is an excellent place for wildlife viewing, particularly birding Birding in Marin County and watching the playful river otters.

He was born on 14 August 1961 to Prof. Bill MacDonald, a professor of child health at University of Western Australia, and Dr Judy Henzell (AM), a well-known paediatrician. He was the youngest of the four children, with two older brothers and a sister. As a child he couldn't say 'Alan' properly so called himself 'Alsy'. He went to Hollywood Senior High School in Perth, Western Australia and was close friends with David McComb. In 1976, partly in response to the emergence of punk rock, MacDonald and McComb formed Dalsy, later known as Bl√∂k Music and then The Triffids (from the post- apocalyptic John Wyndham novel, The Day of the Triffids). McComb and MacDonald wrote and performed songs with Phil Kakulas (later in Blackeyed Susans), Andrew McGowan, Julian Douglas-Smith, and later Byron Sinclair, Will Akers and Margaret Gillard. By Christmas 1978, they had released several home-recorded cassette tapes and been through many line-up changes. In 1981, The Triffids released their first, 7-inch vinyl single, \\"Stand Up\\", as a result of winning a song competition run by the Western Australian Institute of Technology. Subsequent releases included the Reverie EP, \\"Spanish Blue\\", and the Bad Timing and Other Stories EP. They moved to Sydney, in 1982. The band's first 12-inch vinyl album, Treeless Plain, was released in 1983. The band's line-up stabilised to David McComb (vocals, guitar), his brother Robert McComb (guitar, violin), Jill Birt (keyboards), Alsy MacDonald (drums), Martyn P. Casey (bass). In August 1984 the band flew to London, where they recorded the critically acclaimed album, Born Sandy Devotional, they toured Europe and returned to Western Australia in 1986 to record In The Pines on the McComb's family property in Ravensthorpe, south east of Perth. The Triffids line-up was finalised with the addition of 'Evil' Graham Lee on pedal steel and guitar. Lee having recorded the mini-album, Lawson Square Infirmary with the band members in 1984. In 1987 the band signed a three-record deal with Island Records, which saw the release of Calenture and The Black Swan. In 1989 tired from the constant travelling and touring, the band dissolved. MacDonald played with The Blackeyed Susans between 1989 and 1990 and upgraded his high school qualifications. He enrolled in law at Murdoch University in 1992. MacDonald married Jill Birt, the keyboardist for the band. They have three children. Jill is a practising architect who graduated from the University of Western Australia. After graduating with his law degree in 1995, MacDonald applied for a short-term contract at the Equal Opportunity Commission in Perth and is currently Commission's senior legal advisor.

Some versions of the dish use noodles instead of potatoes. The preparation can include removing the stone and stuffing the fruit with sugar. The plums are then completely wrapped in dough and dropped in boiling water. When they start floating, they are taken out, sprinkled with sugar, and served. They can also be covered with breadcrumbs fried in butter. Cinnamon or sour cream are sometimes added before serving. It seems that the dish originated in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

The term is in principle similar to sapper. Pioneers were originally part of the artillery branch of European armies. Subsequently, they formed part of the engineering branch, the logistic branch, part of the infantry; or even comprised a branch in their own right. Historically, the primary role of pioneer units was to assist other arms in tasks such as the construction of field fortifications, military camps, bridges and roads. Pioneers Prior to and during the First World War, pioneers were often engaged in the construction and repair of military railways.Dooley, p.170. During World War II, pioneer units were used extensively by all major forces, both on the front line and in supporting roles. During the 20th century, British Commonwealth military forces came to distinguish between small units of \\"assault pioneers\\" belonging to infantry regiments and separate pioneer units (as in the former Royal Pioneer Corps). The United States Marine Corps has sometimes organized its sappers into \\"Pioneer Battalions\\".Lane, p.160. The arrival of the Military engineering vehicle and the deployment of weapons of mass destruction vastly expanded capabilities and complicated mission-profiles of modern pioneer units. Origin of the term The word pioneer is originally from France. The word () was borrowed into English, from Old French pionnier, which meant a \\"foot soldier\\", from the root 'peon' recorded in 1523.Which is in turn derived from pedn-, from Late Latin, \\"one who has broad feet\\" It was used in a military sense as early as 1626‚Äì1627.English Ordnance 1626 to 1643 In the late 18th century, Captain George Smith defined the term as: Pioneer regiments in the Indian Army :For Indian Army Pioneer Corps, see also Indian Army Pioneer Corps Extensive use was made of pioneers in the British Indian Army because of the demands of campaigning in difficult terrain with little or no infrastructure. In 1780, two companies of pioneers were raised in Madras, increasing to 16 in 1803 divided into two battalions. Bombay and Bengal pioneers were formed during the same period. In the late nineteenth century, a number of existing Indian infantry regiments took the title and the construction role of pioneers. The twelve Indian Pioneer regiments in existence in 1914 were trained and equipped for road, rail and engineering work, as well as for conventional infantry service. While this dual function did not qualify them to be regarded as elite units, the frequency with which they saw active service made postings to pioneer regiments popular with British officers. Prior to World War I, each sepoy in a Pioneer regiment carried a pickaxe or a light spade in special leather equipment as well as a rifle and bayonet. NCOs and buglers carried axes, saws and billhooks. Heavier equipment, such as explosives, was carried by mule. The unit was therefore well equipped for simple field engineering tasks, as well as being able to defend itself in hostile territory. During the War, the increased specialisation required of Pioneers made them too valuable to use as regular assault infantry. Accordingly, in 1929, the Pioneer regiments were taken out of the line infantry and grouped into the Corps of Madras Pioneers (four battalions), the Corps of Bombay Pioneers (four battalions), the Corps of Sikhs Pioneers (four battalions), and the Corps of Hazara Pioneers (one battalion). All four Pioneer Corps were disbanded in 1933 and their personnel mostly transferred into the Corps of Sappers and Miners, whose role they had come to parallel. It was concluded that the Pioneer battalions had become less technically effective than the Sappers and Miners, but too well trained in specialist functions to warrant being used as ordinary infantry. In addition, their major role of frontier road building had now been allocated to civilian workers. An Indian Pioneer Corps was re-established in 1943. Pioneers in the British Army Historically, British infantry regiments maintained small units of pioneers for heavy work and engineering, especially for clearing paths through forests and for leading assaults on fortifications. These units evolved into assault pioneers. They also inspired the creation of the Royal Pioneer Corps. During World War I, on paper at least, each division was allocated a pioneer infantry battalion, who in addition to being trained infantry were able to conduct pioneer duties. These pioneer battalions were raised and numbered within the existing infantry regiments; where possible recruits were men who possessed transferable skills from civilian life. The Royal Pioneer Corps was a British Army combatant corps used for light engineering tasks. The Royal Pioneer Corps was raised on 17 October 1939 as the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps. It was renamed the Pioneer Corps on 22 November 1940. It was renamed the Royal Pioneer Corps on 28 November 1946. On 5 April 1993, the Royal Pioneer Corps united with other units to form the Royal Logistics Corps. The specialist pioneer units in the Royal Logistics Corps, 23 Pioneer Regiment, based at St David's Barracks at Bicester, and 168 Pioneer Regiment, headquartered in Prince William of Gloucester Barracks at Grantham, were disbanded in 2014, as part of the Army 2020 re-organisation. The ARRC Support Battalion is based at Imjin Barracks, Innsworth (until June 2010, it was at Rheindahlen Military Complex, Germany) All British infantry regiments still maintain assault pioneer units. The Pioneer Sergeant is the only rank allowed to wear a beard on parade. Israeli Army The Israeli army has an infantry brigade called the Fighting Pioneer Youth, in Hebrew Noar Halutzi Lohem or just \\"Nahal\\". The title of Israeli military pioneers is a back-derivation from the civilian term. The Israeli army's pioneers were formed in 1948 from Jewish civilian pioneers, i.e. settlers, who were permitted to combine military service and farming.

Most chillers use refrigerant in a closed loop system to facilitate heat exchange from water where the refrigerant is then pumped to a location where the waste heat is transferred to the atmosphere. However, there are other method in performing this action. In hydroponics, pumps, lights and ambient heat can warm the reservoir water temperatures, leading to plant root and health problems. For ideal plant health, a chiller can be used to lower the water temperature below ambient level; 68¬∞F (20¬∞C) is a good temperature for most plants. This results in healthy root production and efficient absorption of nutrients. In air conditioning, chilled water is often used to cool a building's air and equipment, especially in situations where many individual rooms must be controlled separately, such as a hotel.

The painting is a triptych; the three panels tell a story of a free selector and his family making a life in the Australian bush. It is widely considered one of the masterpieces of Australian art. The painting is part of the National Gallery of Victoria's Australian art collection and exhibited in the Ian Potter Centre in Federation Square in Melbourne. Composition The three panels of the triptych tell a story of a free selector, a farmer who has chosen some land to clear and farm, and his family. The story is ambiguous, like many of McCubbin's other works and McCubbin chose not to respond when controversy broke out over the \\"correct\\" meaning. The left panel shows the selector and his wife settling on their selection; in the foreground, the woman is deep in thought. In the centre panel, the baby in the woman's arms indicates that some time has elapsed. A cottage, the family home, can be seen in a clearing through the trees. The right panel shows a man crouching over a grave. A city is visible in the background, again indicating that time has passed. It is unclear whose grave it is, and if the man is the pioneer, the baby from the centre panel, or a stranger stumbling across the grave.Frederick McCubbin The pioneer 1904, \\"Work of the week\\", National Gallery of Victoria, 14 July 2014 McCubbin painted the work en plein air near Fontainebleau -- his home in Mount Macedon, northwest of Melbourne -- using specially dug trenches to lower the canvas. The view is across a neighbouring property owned by William Peter McGregor, the second chairman of Broken Hill Proprietary Ltd. The cottage in the middle panel was the home of the manager of McGregor's bull stud. McCubbin's wife Annie and a local sawyer Patrick \\"Paddy\\" Watson were the models for the left panel, with Watson also the model for the youth in the right panel. The model for the centre panel was a young commercial painter, James Edward with Annie again posing as the woman. The baby was Jimmy Watson, Patrick's nephew. A study of the materials and technique used in the painting revealed thatto add \\"luminosity and texture\\"McCubbin covered the ground in the centre panel with a further layer of lead white; the brush marks in the stiffer lead white can be seen through the later layers in raking light. Raking light also shows that a palette knife has been used in some places to apply paint to the surface. The painting is still displayed in its original frame; the frame may have been resurfaced. History and legacy The painting was first exhibited in a one-man show in 1904 at the Melbourne Athenaeum gallery but did not find a buyer. Walter Withers, a friend of McCubbin's, suggested that McCubbin add a view of Melbourne in the background of the right panel, which he did.

Part of the town of Belvedere, California is located on the island.U.S. Geological Survey. 2009. USGS Belvedere Island USGS San Francisco North Quad, California, Topographic Map Natural history There are a variety of flora and fauna represented on Belvedere Island. Presence of herons has been noted for a considerable period of time. Some of the flora are common to nearby Ring Mountain (on the Tiburon Peninsula), where a considerable floral biodiversity has been documented. Ring Mountain has also been established to have been a settlement area for early Native American inhabitants of this local area.C. Michael Hogan (2008) Ring Mountain, The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham History The area of Tiburon was originally populated by the Coast Miwok indigenous people. There is evidence that they would have visited the island. In 1834, the first Mexican land grant in Marin gave the island to John Reed. It was called El Potrero de la Punta del Tiburon (The Paddock of Tiburon Point) during the time. Israel Kashow, an American from Ohio who came to California as a Forty-Niner, was one of the first people to establish a permanent habitation on the island. He lived on the island and ran a fishery. He was later evicted from the island by a court order filed by heirs to John Reed's estate. During this time the island was known as Kashow's Island. In 1890, the Belvedere Land Co. acquired the island and renamed it to Belvedere Island and developed the island into a summer retreat for the wealthy. In 1896, Belvedere incorporated as a city (composing the island, nearby Corinthian Island, and part of the Tiburon Peninsula) and a post office was established the following year. Throughout this time, the marshes that separated the island from Tiburon Point had become paved over by roads for direct access to the island, with the first state highway being built in 1930. It is now connected by two causeways (Beach Road and San Rafael Avenue) and connected to the mainland via landfill, therefore not being technically an island anymore. The two narrow strips of land for the causeways now form the artificial Belvedere Lagoon. Belvedere is currently primarily residences and is home to the eighth highest-income community in the United States. Geology Aerial view from 2010 of Belvedere Island and the Tiburon Peninsula A USGS survey of the island describes the island of being composed of Franciscan sandstone and Franciscan Greenstone, forming a part of the Franciscan Complex.

By the end of 2018 Turkey had about 7 GW of installed capacity, with a techno-economic potential estimated at 38 GW onshore and 10 GW offshore. The Energy Ministry plans to have another 10GW installed in the 2020s. History Bozcaada Wind Farm, √áanakkale province The first wind farm was built in Izmir in 1998. 19 MW of wind power was installed by 2006, almost 140 MW by 2007, then 1,265 MW at the end of 2010 and 1,645 MW by 2011. Current and planned capacity total installed capacity was 7 GW and 20 TWh of electricity was generated that year. It is forecast to reach 8 GW during 2019 and the Energy Ministry and Energy Market Regulatory Authority (, EPDK) plan to have another 10GW installed in the 2020s. There is collaboration with Denmark to plan offshore wind power. Project YEKA In 2017, the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources launched a US$ 1 billion wind power investment project, and issued a request for tender. The project, titled YEKA ( or Renewable Energy Resource Areas), is for wind farms in five different regions in the country with a total power capacity of 1 GW and at least 3 TWh energy generated annually, an extra 1% of electricity in Turkey. The German-Turkish consortium of Siemens-T√ºrkerler-Kalyon bid lowest at 0.0348 US$ per kWh. The consortium will carry out research and development, for ten years, on wind turbine blades, generator design, material technologies and production techniques, software and innovative gearboxes. The R&D; activities will be performed by fifty technical personnel consisting of 80% domestic engineers, with a budget of US$ 5 million per year. In 2019 the second 1GW tender was won for 4 equal capacity projects in Balƒ±kesir, √áanakkale, Aydƒ±n and Muƒüla. Economics and Finance Turkey's feed-in tariff is fair and is available for renewable energy facilities which became operational before the end of 2020. In 2019 the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development invested 100 million USD in wind and solar power in Turkey. auction prices are around US$0.035 per kWh.

History From Angel Island California State Park in San Francisco Bay. Ref. California State Parks Angel Island. In 1814, the British 26-gun sloop of war, , was damaged off the coast of Oregon, but stayed afloat to reach San Francisco Bay. From March 13 to 19th, the ship was repaired on the beach at Ayala Cove on the Northern portion of Angel Island, at the location of the present day ferry boat dock. This event gave the name to the deep-water channel between Tiburon and Angel Island. It is unclear whether the ship was engaged in the War of 1812 or, more likely, protecting British and Canadian fur traders. Geography and Natural history The Spanish, the first European power to control the area, established the village of Tiburon on the north side of the body of water and showed the straits on their charts as the Straits of Tiburon. Tiburon is the Spanish word for shark, named for the subspecies of leopard shark native to San Francisco Bay. The mainland of the Tiburon Peninsula is dominated by Ring Mountain, which is endowed with considerable archaeological traces of the early Native Americans, who settled the local area. Ring Mountain is also replete with numerous species of native wildflowers.C.

Kojima, M. Terao, Proc. ODS SPIE vol. 5069 (2003), 300. for a next-generation optical disc technology which allows much larger data storage densities than DVD, HD DVD or Blu-ray Disc, by allowing the use of many data layers in a single disc. In previous optical disc technologies, relatively few data layers can be incorporated in a single disc, since the reflections from the different layers interfere with each other. However, in LS-R, only the layer of interest generates a reflection, meaning that very many layers can theoretically be stacked in the same disc. This feat is accomplished by an electronic \\"selection\\" mechanism, whereby each data layer is coated with electrodes and only the electrodes associated with the layer of interest are activated. This activation changes the \\"selected\\" data layer from being transparent to being reflective or opaque, thus it can be addressed.  Technology  In the Hitachi implementation, LS-R technology utilizes an electrochromic film, for example of tungsten oxide or an organic material to accomplish the optical change. A two-layer feasibility prototype has been demonstrated, and it was estimated that a 20-layer CD-sized disc could provide 1 terabyte of data capacity. Electrical activation of layers has been achieved with transparent ITO electrodes, and a contactless power supply has been developed in order to allow long-term operation (given that the disc is spinning at several thousand revolutions per minute).  Commercial product  No plans or timeline for the development of a commercial product have been released. It is possible that this technology, while interesting, will remain in the realms of research, either because it is superseded by an alternative technology (such as holographic storage or another 3D optical data storage variant), or because it can not be made to be economically viable. The need for the disc to be meticulously constructed from many layers of different materials, and the need for the drive to be able to electrically address each layer specifically, may make this solution too expensive for commercialization. In the next generation LS-R may compete with other next- generation optical disc format such as the Holographic versatile disc and Protein-coated disc formats.

In planar chromatography in particular, the retardation factor Rf is defined as the ratio of the distance traveled by the center of a spot to the distance traveled by the solvent front. Ideally, the values for RF are equivalent to the R values used in column chromatography. Although the term retention factor is sometimes used synonymously with retardation factor in regard to planar chromatography the term is not defined in this context. However, in column chromatography, the retention factor or capacity factor (k) is defined as the ratio of time an analyte is retained in the stationary phase to the time it is retained in the mobile phase, which is inversely proportional to the retardation factor. General definition In chromatography, the retardation factor, R, is the fraction of the sample in the mobile phase at equilibrium, defined as: :\\\\ R = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{quantity of substance in the mobile phase}}{\\\\mbox{total quantity of substance in the system}} Planar chromatography The retardation factor, Rf, is commonly used in paper chromatography and thin layer chromatography for analyzing and comparing different substances. It can be mathematically described by the following ratio: :\\\\ R_f = \\\\frac{\\\\mbox{migration distance of substance}}{\\\\mbox{migration distance of solvent front}} An Rf value will always be in the range 0 to 1; if the substance moves, it can only move in the direction of the solvent flow, and cannot move faster than the solvent. For example, if particular substance in an unknown mixture travels 2.5 cm and the solvent front travels 5.0 cm, the retardation factor would be 0.5. One can choose a mobile phase with different characteristics (particularly polarity) in order to control how far the substance being investigated migrates. An Rf value is characteristic for any given compound (provided that the same stationary and mobile phases are used). It can provide corroborative evidence as to the identity of a compound. If the identity of a compound is suspected but not yet proven, an authentic sample of the compound, or standard, is spotted and run on a TLC plate side by side (or on top of each other) with the compound in question. Note that this identity check must be performed on a single plate, because it is difficult to duplicate all the factors which influence Rf exactly from experiment to experiment.

Mount Hood climbing accidents are mountain climbing- or hiking-related incidents on Oregon's Mount Hood. As of 2007, about 10,000 people attempt to climb Mount Hood each year. As of May 2002, more than 130 people have died climbing Mount Hood since records have been kept. One of the worst climbing accidents occurred in 1986, when seven teenagers and two school teachers froze to death while attempting to retreat from a storm. Despite a quadrupling of forest visitors since 1990, the number of people requiring rescue remains steady at around 25 to 50 per year, largely because of the increased use of cell phones and GPS devices. In 2006, 3.4 percent of search and rescue missions were for mountain climbers. In comparison, 20% were for vehicles (including ATVs and snowmobiles), 3% were for mushroom collectors, the remaining 73.6 percent were for skiers, boaters, and participants in other mountain activities. Regardless of route, Mount Hood is a technical climb. It requires ropes, crampons, and ice axes. Approximately 95% of Mount Hood's climbs occur April through July. Hazards Cascade Range weather patterns can be deceptive, with sudden sustained winds of , and visibility quickly dropping from hundreds of miles to an arm's length; climbers can experience temperature drops in less than an hour after leaving an access point. This pattern is responsible for the most well known incidents of May 1986 and December 2006.See incident summary references. Avalanches are popularly believed a major climbing hazard, but relatively few Mount Hood deaths are attributed to them. For the 11-year period ending April 2006, The statistical period of the Westwide Avalanche Network is 31 December 1994 to 30 April 2006, almost eleven and a half years. there was one death on Mount Hood caused by an avalanche, while 445 avalanche-related deaths occurred throughout North America. Compared to other western states, Oregon has relatively few avalanche fatalities (16 of the 1009 for the U.S. from 1951 to 2015). There are between 100 and 200 deaths each year worldwide from avalanches. The two major causes of climbing deaths on Mount Hood are falls and hypothermia.See incident history.

Kirn's body was found on the Newton Clark Glacier on the east side of the mountain, after an apparent 40-story fall in connection with an avalanche. In an unusual accident reported in Grauer's book, on August 27, 1934, Victor Von Norman successfully climbed the mountain via the southern route, along with a group of fellow University of Washington students. He then ventured too close to a fumarole between Crater Rock and the \\"Hogsback\\" that connects Crater Rock with the summit ridge, was overcome by oxygen-barren gases emanating from the fumarole, and fell about to his death. A number of men who tried to retrieve the body over several days were also nearly overcome by the fumes, even after obtaining an oxygen mask, before finally succeeding in their efforts. In 1961, experienced climber Colin Chisholm and his teenage son, Doug Chisholm climbed the Elliott Glacier. On the descent of Cooper's Spur a crampon slipped on ice caused a fall. The two fell 2000 feet onto and over crevasses on Elliot Glacier. Colin broke ribs and Doug was unharmed. Their route became known as \\"The Chisholm Trail.\\" . On March 1, 1969, James Eaton died when he fell headfirst into a concealed 60 foot crevasse near the edge of the upper portion of the White River Canyon. Eaton was a ski instructor and a member of the Mount Hood Ski Patrol. Beginning on New Year's Eve in 1975, two 16-year-olds and an 18-year-old survived in a snow cave for 13 days through a snow storm. On May 19, 1980, Tom Hanstedt died while descending the mountain's southeast face, falling deep into a crevasse on the Newton-Clark Glacier. His body was never recovered.Accidents in North American Mountaineering, 1981 On June 6, 1981, David H. Turple and Bill Pilkenton died in a fall from Cooper Spur on the northeast side of the mountain. On June 21, 1981, five members of the Mazamas climbing group died during a fall from Cooper Spur while descending. 1986 Mount Hood Disaster: beginning on May 12, 1986, one of the worst U.S. climbing accidents occurred over the course of three days when seven students and two faculty of the Oregon Episcopal School froze to death during an annual school climb. Of the four survivors, three had life-threatening hypothermia; one had legs amputated. May 1986: Patricia Haythorn, 35, and David W. Schermer, 36, slipped off the edge of the mountain near Eliot Glacier. Hawthorn did not survive the fall. On July 11, 1987, Arthur Andersen Jr. was killed when he and two other men fell on the south side of the mountain and slid into a crevasse. In June 1990, William Ott, who had terminal cancer, died from hypothermia on the mountain.

Budlong was very experienced, having summited the peak 22 times before. However, the weather turned very quickly, and Budlong vanished. Despite an extensive search over the following days, his whereabouts were never determined, and his body was never found. On May 19, 1997, Carlos Loria, a solo climber summited successfully with his dog, Buckwheat. While descending the Coe Glacier he slipped and fell , fracturing his neck. After being reported overdue by family, he was found by rescuers with facial lacerations, slight hypothermia, and cervical trauma. He was treated and helicoptered to Portland, but Buckwheat was not at the scene. A month later, the dog appeared at Cooper Spur Inn, some ENE across the rugged Mount Hood Wilderness, evidently having survived on snow melt and berries. On September 6, 1997, an experienced telemark skier, Mark Fraas of Hood River, ascended wearing crampons and carrying skis to the level of Cooper Spur, not intending to summit. He slipped and fell more than down the Chisholm Trail and Eliot Glacier. Twenty-five rescuers responded to his partner's cell phone call and found him dead. Retrieval required technical mountaineering skills and equipment. Fraas was not known to have any climbing experience. This was at least the 13th fatality from Cooper Spur. All involve loss of footing, inability to self-arrest, and a long fall over rock cliffs above the Eliot Glacier. On May 31, 1998, during a graduation climb for The Mazamas mountaineering club, several participants were caught in an avalanche. One climber, Tom McGlinn, 39-years old, died and one climber had serious injuries. The climbers were at the level on the West Crater Rim route; the forecast was for \\"significant avalanche danger\\" and was posted \\"high avalanche hazard\\" at Timberline's climbing registration. A large slab avalanche fracture occurred at the level, vertical below the westernmost summit ridge. A roped team of three were swept down the steep slope through the Hot Rocks area. One was killed by injuries during the fall and found under four feet of snow about an hour later along with a snapped rope. The other two climbers had a fractured pelvis, and fractured ankle, respectively. The leader who was not roped to the other three, was only briefly caught by the avalanche and had injuries to an ankle and shoulder. On May 23, 1999, Carey Cardon and Tena Cardon, an experienced pair of climbers summited successfully. Shortly after commencing their descent, one stumbled and both fell more than to their deaths. On June 22, 1999, a 24-year-old medical student from Michigan apparently set out from a remote trailhead where his rental car was found. Temperatures dropped 15 degrees and more than an inch of rain fell beginning the next day. Ten days after his presumed disappearance, searching began with up to 70 rescuers combing the area. Additional searches included cadaver dogs and psychics. His body was never found. On June 4, 2000, Diana Kornet, 29, slipped as she was looking over the northeast side of Mount Hood. She fell about 2500 ft to her death. She and six friends had reached the summit about 7 am. She had unroped, as many climbers do after reaching the summit, and left her ice axe when she went to take a look. It was windy in this exposed location. After one of her companions called 911, the sheriff's office sent a search plane and found Kornet's body at the 8,700-foot level at the top of Eliot Glacier. On September 8, 2001, rescuers abandoned a search for a 24-year-old Hungarian exchange student who had been missing for six days. He had been hiking with friends when he left the group with light clothing and no provisions. Two days after his disappearance, the weather turned cold and snowy. On May 24, 2002, a 30-year-old Argentine national attempted to snowboard off Mount Hood's summit along Cooper Spur ridge. He lost control after a few turns and tumbled over to his death. A search-and-rescue team deploys in December 2006 from Timberline Lodge. On May 30, 2002, three climbers were killed and four others injured when they fell into a crevasse (The Bergschrund) in the hogsback. Most unusual was the televised crash-and-roll of a USAF Pavehawk rescue helicopter from the 304th RQS, which suddenly lost lift. Though the helicopter's five crew members were injured, no one was killed by the crash. On March 7, 2003, the search for Fred Frauens, 49 years old, who had been snowshoeing from Timberline Lodge was abandoned after more than four days in heavy winter weather. More than six feet of snow fell during the search. An extensive search five months later for the man's body failed, but unexpectedly discovered the body of another man who was not identified. On Thursday, December 7, 2006, three experienced climbers --Kelly James, Brian Hall, and Jerry \\"Nikko\\" Cooke--began what they expected to be a two-day climb on the more-technical north face gully of the mountain. On Saturday, December 9, 2006, the climbers failed to meet a friend who was scheduled to pick them up at Timberline Lodge. On Sunday, December 10, 2006 James made a cell phone call to his wife, and two older sons telling them that he was trapped in a snow cave and that Brian and Nikko had gone for help. Rescue attempts were forestalled by freezing rain, heavy snowfall, low visibility and winds of , caused by a widespread winter storm. Clear weather on the weekend of December 16 allowed almost 100 search and rescue personnel to scour the mountain. On Sunday, December 17, searchers found what they first believed to be a snow cave and climbing equipment, approximately from the summit. The rescuers found a rope, two ice axes and an insulating sleeping pad. At approximately 3:29 p.m. PST, the body of Kelly James was found in a nearby snow cave. On Wednesday, December 20, 2006, as good weather ended, the Hood River County sheriff announced that the mission was now being treated as a recovery rather than a rescue. Brian Hall and Jerry Cooke remain missing and have been declared dead. On the morning of Saturday, February 17, 2007, eight experienced climbers from the Portland area ascended in sunny, mild weather. Observing worse weather mid-afternoon, they camped at the level of Illumination Saddle overnight. Sunday morning, they abandoned a summit attempt and descended in freezing rain and snow, visibility less than , and winds at 40 to 70 mph (64 to 120 km/h). At about noon, disoriented, three of the climbers and a black lab stepped off a cliff (at the level at the east edge of Palmer Glacier) while roped together and fell down several hundred feet into White River Canyon. One of the remaining five climbers was lowered by rope to search for the fallen group, but returned without seeing them. They called for help by cell phone, and were advised of even worse weather advancing, so they dug in expecting another night. However, rescuers arrived and evacuated them Sunday evening. The three fallen climbers were unable to dig into solid ice to build a snow cave, so they improvised a shelter and were in hourly cell phone contact with rescuers. They had a Mountain Locator Unit, sleeping bags, GPS, and a tarp. The dog, Velvet, helped keep them warm. Rescuers arrived Monday about 10:45 am. One was hospitalized for a head injury, the others were treated for minor injuries and released. The dog had broken nails and a cut on one of her back legs from cold exposure. On May 12, 2007, five climbers were stranded at the level by whiteout conditions. The climbers contacted rescuers by cell phone and obtained assistance to navigate to Illumination Saddle, on the south side of the mountain. Using their GPS navigation unit, the climbers traversed to the saddle and descended the mountain without further incident. The climbers carried a Mountain Locator Unit, which rescuers could have used to pinpoint their location had they not descended from the mountain on their own. On September 7, 2007, in the early afternoon two Portland-area climbers were ascending the Hogsback to the Pearly Gates when one slid to the edge of the Bergschrund and sustained injuries sufficient for him to call for rescue assistance. His partner decided it was too dangerous to descend the frozen gravel and loose rock face and remained in place. Rescuers arrived about five hours later, assessed the fallen climber, treated minor injuries and belayed him walking down. The other climber required technical climbing equipment and was assisted down the Bergschrund. He walked down and joined his partner about dawn at a Timberline snowcat at the top of the ski area. National media covered a minor 2007 climbing incident probably due to the intense December 2006 tragedy coverage. On January 14, 2008, in good weather, two young and experienced climbers intended to ascend the Leuthold Couloir route. When their return was overdue that afternoon, a search and rescue team was activated for the following morning but was turned back by bad weather. At 9 am, cell phone contact was established and rescuers learned they had spent the night below tree line. Rescuers escorted them out two hours later. The climbers were unprepared for bad weather, which arrived as they reached the level. Thinking they had a clear weather window, they had no GPS, nor Mountain Locator Unit, and did not believe their cell phone was usable. Descending with a map and compass, they navigated southward hoping to encounter Timberline Lodge, Government Camp, or the Mount Hood Highway. Not finding either, they reached the level and built a snow cave to spend the night. In the morning, they inadvertently discovered a geocache labeled with coordinates just as a rescue sheriff called their cell phone. On October 19, 2008, an inexperienced solo climber fell as he began his descent after summitting. He slipped, leading to an uncontrolled slide of about vertical near Crater Rock. He was unable to arrest his fall using an ice ax, and blacked out after his head struck the surface. Another climber witnessed his fall and rushed to assist, observed head trauma and confusion, and called for help using a cell phone, then descended to meet rescuers. A third climber remained with him until help arrived since the victim was unable to descend on foot. Rescuers arrived a few hours later, applied first aid to stabilize, and called for air evacuation to a Portland hospital. He was treated for cuts and scrapes, and released. On January 17, 2009, a search and rescuer on a training exercise was injured when the ice he was climbing collapsed causing him to fall some resulting in severe ankle injuries. Another team member was injured, but was able to walk down. Another rescue team was practicing in the area at the time and assisted the first team. On January 21, 2009, a climber died after a temperature inversion likely loosened ice from cliffs above the Hogsback. She tumbled before stopping in a natural depression. On February 1, 2009, two men were ascending the Hogsback. Fatigue and poor weather caused them to abort a summit attempt and descend. One lost his balance and fell some before self-arresting, during which he dislocated a shoulder. The other climber called 911 and initiated assistance. Another group of climbers stopped and helped walk the injured climber to the Timberline Ski Area where a snow cat with rescuers awaited. On May 17, 2009, a climber received severe injuries to his face, arm and leg in a fall at the 10,600 level of the Hogsback. At least 40 climbers were attempting to summit at the time. The previous day a climber in a group of ten was struck by falling ice. Both climbers were hospitalized. On December 13, 2009, rescuers recovered the body of 26-year-old Luke T. Gullberg, of Des Moines, Washington, at about the 9,000-foot level, two days after the trio began climbing an especially treacherous face of the mountain. On August 26, 2010, after several days of a renewed search effort, Portland Mountain Rescue recovered the bodies of Anthony Vietti and Katie Nolan, still tied together. Aerial mosaic photo of summit crater: left is north, the Bergschrunde and Hogsback left of center On June 16, 2010, five climbers with ski gear hiked up Snow Dome, a popular wilderness back country area on the north side, intending to ski down. Bad weather rolled in causing poor visibility and strong winds. One climber, Robert Dale Wiebe from Canada, was separated and accidentally traversed Coe Glacier where he apparently fell to his death. On July 7, 2010, a 25-year-old male climber had successfully summited. During the initial descent, he lost footing near Hot Rocks and was unable to stop, injuring his knee and elbow. Nearby climbers provided first aid until rescuers and paramedics arrived and stabilized him. He was loaded into a sled and lowered down with an improvised arrangement of rope and pulley systems. On July 24, 2010, a 54-year-old male from Arizona fell from the Hogsback and fractured or dislocated an ankle and received abrasions from sliding down granular ice. The victim was airlifted to a Portland hospital. On January 22, 2011, three friends summited successfully in the afternoon, but one broke his crampon during descent. At 5 p.m., his partners continued down without him separating from him at Crater Rock. They notified authorities when he did not return, reporting he lacked a light and overnight gear though he had \\"a beacon\\" from REI, but did not know what it was, but said he would \\"pull the knob\\" if something happened. The sheriff called for search assistance, and since Portland Mountain Rescue was already in the area for a winter bivouac exercise, they conducted an MLU search at 8 p.m. and quickly identified a signal from White River Canyon. It was a clear night near freezing with winds at . Night ski lighting from Skibowl and Timberline was clearly visible when they located the victim east of Palmer Glacier at around midnight in light garments. They treated with warm clothing, liquids, and heat packs and took him back to Timberline. Late on February 20, 2011, a snowboarder was reported lost on Mount Hood. Initial information and cell phone tracking indicated he was northwest of Zig Zag Canyon. Five searchers were unable to find him that night though visibility improved during the evening. The next morning had better conditions and involved many more searchers. He was found by a National Guard helicopter, which airlifted him to Timberline Lodge, cold but in good spirits. As rescuers were debriefing with a sheriff, a call for assistance arrived from a 13-year-old male snowboarder who was out-of-bounds below the Timberline Ski area. He was found within 20 minutes of the call, given hot drink and food, and escorted to Timberline's first aid room. On February 7, 2012, experienced climber Jared Townsley, 31 or 32, of Tigard, Oregon, was found dead at the 9,200 foot level at the base of a cliff with injuries consistent with a severe fall. With as many as 12 to 15 Mount Hood summits, he began climbing around midnight Sunday, February 5, a common tactic to summit at dawn. Other climbers reported seeing him descending near Crater Rock at 8:30 a.m. When he did not return as planned by 11 a.m., volunteers searched throughout the night in mild temperatures, light wind, and with a full moon and found his body Tuesday morning. Mount Hood sunrise silhouette seen from Portland's Rocky Butte At about 5:20 a.m. on June 14, 2012, solo climber Mark Cartier, 56, of Portland, Oregon, died due to injuries sustained by falling from a point above and west of the Hogsback (around the 11,000-foot level) into the Hot Rocks area west of Crater Rock. He was descending the mountain at the time of the fall and reportedly slid 1,000 feet out of control, coming to rest amid a large debris field. His body was recovered by rescuers just before 1 p.m. Weather was good but the freezing level was at about 10,000 feet, contributing to dicey surface conditions. Cartier was an experienced rock climber, climbed mountains around the world, and had summited Mount Hood hundreds of times. On Sunday, March 24, 2013, college student Mary Owen set out in the early morning hours to complete a solo climb. She was supposed to be a part of a group climb, but when the leader of her group canceled the climb due to what he thought would be bad weather, Owen decided to climb alone. As she climbed higher, whiteout conditions set in, and approximately 1000 vertical feet from the summit she decided to turn back. Disoriented due to the conditions she became lost and, attempting to climb out of canyon, she slipped and fell about 40 feet, severely spraining her right ankle and suffering a puncture wound to her inner left thigh. Unable to walk, she was stranded on the mountain for six nights, surviving on a one day's worth of snacks. Though she registered to climb, some mishap caused her information to be lost and she was not reported missing until Thursday, March 28. She was found alive on Saturday, March 30, by an Oregon Army National Guard Blackhawk helicopter rescue crew and flown directly to a hospital. Aside from her ankle injuries, she suffered frostbite in her feet and toes, but recovered fully. On June 22, 2013, experienced climber Dr. Kinley Adams, a Salem family dentist, set out for a day climb as part of training preparation for a planned climbing trip to Nepal. He parked and registered at Timberline, and set out solo, but did not return as planned at 3:30 p.m. Searching began at 5:00 a.m. the next day, but was limited by low clouds, light rain, and worsening weather, which turned to winter conditions for the next few days. Search and rescue aircraft found his body a week later, and it was recovered the following day by a highly technical mission due to dangerous snow and slope conditions. Death occurred from multiple injuries caused by falling. July 23, 2013, Cole Hancock, age 10, hiking with his dad, Kim Hancock, fell 150 feet off of a cliff on Mount Hood. Brain damaged, initially, Cole couldn't speak one word, but two days later was speaking in whole sentences. He was treated at Doernbecher Children's Hospital. On August 3, 2013, six snowboarders were scouting a location to shoot video. They were exploring an area of White River Glacier at about elevation when they found a natural tunnel in ice and walked through it. The first, Collin Backowski, 25, a coach at High Cascade Snowboard Camp from Pine, Colorado, was caught by the tunnel collapsing. The other five avoided injury. Backowski's body was recovered the next day. On August 12, 2013, 32-year-old Sebastian Kinasiewicz of Poland apparently summited from the Tilly Jane trailhead on the northeast side of the mountain, but fell to his death near the summit. May 14, 2014, a priest (Father Robert Cormier, age 57, of St. Patrick's and Assumption All Saints in Jersey City, New Jersey) fell 1,000 feet to his death on Mt. Hood. On June 4, 2015, Ward Milo Maxfield, a 66-year-old experienced climber from Paul, Idaho was leading his 17-year-old grandson and a group other climbers when he fell 400 feet to his death. Two climbers ascending the Hogsback and approaching the Pearly Gates On May 7, 2017, John Thorton Jenkins, a 32-year-old experienced climber from Seattle, WA was heading for the summit when he slid down steep terrain near the Hogsback. He sustained serious injuries and was treated by search and rescue teams, who had him flown to a Portland hospital, but he was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. On August 12, 2017, two 19-year-old college students, Emma Place and Emily Lang, apparently fell to their deaths off a Pacific Crest Trail cliff. The women had set up camp at the top of a waterfall, with a tent and backpacks. It appeared that they lost their footing on the slippery rocks and fell. The two had met in 2008 as students at Laurelhust Elementary in Portland and became best friends. They graduated from St. Mary's Academy in 2016. Each had completed her freshman year‚ÄîPlace at Gonzaga University and Lang at Western Washington University. On February 13, 2018, 35-year-old Miha Sumi of Portland fell 700-1,000 feet on Hogsback, was critically injured, rescued and subsequently died. Sumi was among a group of four climbers; Sumi and Matt Zavortink had reached the summit, while the other two waited on Hogsback. The group encountered tumbling ice and rocks, causing Sumi's fall. Zavortink and other climbers in the area reached Sumi and performed CPR for about 90 minutes until a Blackhawk helicopter arrived and rescued him. He was flown to Legacy Emanuel Medical Center in Portland but was declared dead upon arrival.

In model-based design of control systems, development is manifested in these four steps: # modeling a plant, # analyzing and synthesizing a controller for the plant, # simulating the plant and controller, # integrating all these phases by deploying the controller. The model-based design is significantly different from traditional design methodology. Rather than using complex structures and extensive software code, designers can use Model-based design to define plant models with advanced functional characteristics using continuous-time and discrete-time building blocks. These built models used with simulation tools can lead to rapid prototyping, software testing, and verification. Not only is the testing and verification process enhanced, but also, in some cases, hardware-in-the-loop simulation can be used with the new design paradigm to perform testing of dynamic effects on the system more quickly and much more efficiently than with traditional design methodology. History The dawn of the electrical age brought many innovative and advanced control systems. As early as the 1920s two aspects of engineering, control theory and control systems, converged to make large-scale integrated systems possible. In those early days controls systems were commonly used in the industrial environment. Large process facilities started using process controllers for regulating continuous variables such as temperature, pressure, and flow rate. Electrical relays built into ladder-like networks were one of the first discrete control devices to automate an entire manufacturing process. Control systems gained momentum, primarily in the automotive and aerospace sectors. In the 1950s and 1960s the push to space generated interest in embedded control systems. Engineers constructed control systems such as engine control units and flight simulators, that could be part of the end product. By the end of the twentieth century, embedded control systems were ubiquitous, as even white goods such as washing machines and air conditioners contained complex and advanced control algorithms, making them much more \\"intelligent\\". In 1969, the first computer- based controllers were introduced. These early programmable logic controllers (PLC) mimicked the operations of already available discrete control technologies that used the out-dated relay ladders. The advent of PC technology brought a drastic shift in the process and discrete control market. An off-the-shelf desktop loaded with adequate hardware and software can run an entire process unit, and execute complex and established PID algorithms or work as a Distributed Control System (DCS).  Model-based design steps  The main steps in Model-based design approach are: # Plant modeling. Plant modeling can be data-driven or based on first principles. Data-driven plant modeling uses techniques such as System identification. With system identification, the plant model is identified by acquiring and processing raw data from a real-world system and choosing a mathematical algorithm with which to identify a mathematical model. Various kinds of analysis and simulations can be performed using the identified model before it is used to design a model-based controller. First-principles based modeling is based on creating a block diagram model that implements known differential-algebraic equations governing plant dynamics. A type of first-principles based modeling is physical modeling, where a model consists in connected blocks that represent the physical elements of the actual plant. #Controller analysis and synthesis. The mathematical model conceived in step 1 is used to identify dynamic characteristics of the plant model. A controller can then be synthesized based on these characteristics. #Offline simulation and real-time simulation. The time response of the dynamic system to complex, time-varying inputs is investigated. This is done by simulating a simple LTI (Linear Time-Invariant) model, or by simulating a non-linear model of the plant with the controller. Simulation allows specification, requirements, and modeling errors to be found immediately, rather than later in the design effort. Real-time simulation can be done by automatically generating code for the controller developed in step 2. This code can be deployed to a special real-time prototyping computer that can run the code and control the operation of the plant. If a plant prototype is not available, or testing on the prototype is dangerous or expensive, code can be automatically generated from the plant model. This code can be deployed to the special real-time computer that can be connected to the target processor with running controller code. Thus a controller can be tested in real-time against a real-time plant model. #Deployment. Ideally this is done via code generation from the controller developed in step 2. It is unlikely that the controller will work on the actual system as well as it did in simulation, so an iterative debugging process is carried out by analyzing results on the actual target and updating the controller model. Model-based design tools allow all these iterative steps to be performed in a unified visual environment.  Disadvantages of MBD The disadvantages of Model-based design, are fairly well understood this late in development lifecycle, of the product and development. * One major disadvantage is that the approach taken is a blanket or coverall approach to standard embedded and systems development. Often the time it takes to port between processors and ecosystems can outweigh the temporal value it offers in the simpler lab based implementations. * Much of the compilation tool chain is closed source, and prone to fence post errors, and other such common compilation errors that are easily corrected in traditional systems engineering. * Design and reuse patterns can lead to implementations of models that are not well suited to that task. Such as implementing a controller for a conveyor belt production facility that uses a thermal sensor, speed sensor, and current sensor. That model is generally not well suited for re-implementation in a motor controller etc. Though its very easy to port such a model over, and introduce all the software faults therein. While Model-based design has the ability to simulate test scenarios and interpret simulations well, in real world production environments, it is often not suitable. Over reliance on a given toolchain can lead to significant rework and possibly compromise entire engineering approaches. While it's suitable for bench work, the choice to use this for a production system should be made very carefully.  Advantages  Some of the advantages Model-based design offers in comparison to the traditional approach are:Automakers Opting for Model-Based Design, Design News, November 5, 2010 * Model-based design provides a common design environment, which facilitates general communication, data analysis, and system verification between various (development) groups. * Engineers can locate and correct errors early in system design, when the time and financial impact of system modification are minimized. * Design reuse, for upgrades and for derivative systems with expanded capabilities, is facilitated. Because of the limitations of graphical tools, design engineers previously relied heavily on text-based programming and mathematical models. However, developing these models was time-consuming, and highly prone to error. In addition, debugging text-based programs is a tedious process, requiring much trial and error before a final fault-free model could be created, especially since mathematical models undergo unseen changes during the translation through the various design stages. Graphical modeling tools aim to improve these aspects of design. These tools provide a very generic and unified graphical modeling environment, and they reduce the complexity of model designs by breaking them into hierarchies of individual design blocks. Designers can thus achieve multiple levels of model fidelity by simply substituting one block element with another. Graphical models also help engineers to conceptualize the entire system and simplify the process of transporting the model from one stage to another in the design process. Boeing's simulator EASY5 was among the first modeling tools to be provided with a graphical user interface, together with AMESim, a multi-domain, multi- level platform based on the Bond Graph theory. This was soon followed by tool like 20-sim and Dymola, which allowed models to be composed of physical components like masses, springs, resistors, etc. These were later followed by many other modern tools such as Simulink and LabVIEW.

She was to be named Antinavarchos Kountouriotis after Vice Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis. The order was placed with Cammell Laird and production continued for the Greek account after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. In 1915, however, the two cruisers were purchased by the British government, and entered service with the Royal Navy. Design and description Based on the Birmingham sub-class of the Towns, the two Greek ships primarily differed from their British half-sisters in their armament. The Greeks specified that they would use the new BL 5.5-inch (140 mm) Mk I gun built by the Coventry Ordnance Works. This weapon was significantly lighter than the standard 6-inch (152 mm) gun, which allowed the ships to mount ten guns, rather than the nine of the Birminghams, and fired an shell rather than the shell of the 6-inch weapon. It therefore had a higher rate of fire with little loss in hitting power.Gardiner & Gray, p. 58 The Greeks also specified a secondary armament of two 12-pounder anti-aircraft guns, but these were still under development in 1915 and a pair of 3-pounder guns on high-angle mounts were substituted instead.Lyon, Part 2, p. 57 Birkenhead was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of .Friedman 2010, p. 384 Displacement was normal and at full load. Twelve Yarrow boilers fed Birkenheads Parsons steam turbines, driving four propeller shafts, that were rated at for a design speed of . The boilers used both fuel oil and coal, with of coal and tons of oil carried. Two of the 5.5-inch guns were mounted on the centreline fore and aft of the superstructure and the remaining eight guns were positioned on the broadside. All these guns were fitted with gun shields. Two Vickers 3-pounder (47 mm) anti-aircraft guns were also fitted. The armament was completed by two submerged 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes.Lyon, Part 2, pp. 55‚Äì57 Service The ship was laid down as Yard number 809 on 27 March 1914.

Dick. Originally written in 1958, but rejected by prospective publishers, this book was eventually published posthumously in 1985 by Dragon Press. It was published in two editions. Fifty copies were bound in quarter leather and included a signature from one of the author's canceled checks but were not jacketed. Nine hundred fifty copies were published with a cloth binding and included a dust jacket. It was reprinted in paperback in 2006. Plot summary It's 1958 and Bruce Stevens is a buyer for a national warehouse chain who passes through his hometown of Montario, Idaho whilst en route to Boise on business. His reason involves hormones more than nostalgia, however, as a one-time girlfriend named Peg lives there now. It is at a party at her place where he meets, and quickly falls into a relationship with, a strangely familiar older woman who turns out to be one of his former, and least favorite, elementary school teachers, Susan Faine. She simultaneously hires him on as manager of her typewriter shop. Travelling salesman Milton Lumky informs Bruce of a warehouse full of imported, Japanese-made surplus typewriters, and so Stevens drives to Seattle to see this potential bounty for himself. He belatedly discovers that the typewriters all have Spanish language keyboards, and so he tries to pass these hot potatoes down along the line to his former warehouse employer. He reveals his nefarious intentions to Susan, who passes the information onto the warehouse chain which nevertheless decides to take them off his hands at a fair but unprofitable price for Bruce. He then enters a period of waffling and indecision, ultimately deciding to try altering all of the machines himself and selling them at the shop. Returning to Boise he informs Susan of his decision and sets to work, only to return the next morning to find that Susan has fired him and all of the typewriters are being loaded into a truck by one of his former co-workers at the warehouse chain. Distraught by this turn of events he rents a room and recalls one of his first encounters with Susan as his fifth grade teacher which evolves into a day dream about the pair opening up shop in Montario and ultimately moving to Denver following the purchase of an expanded facility there and living happily ever after.

The house was shelled during its involvement in the Lucknow siege in 1857 together with the Residency and the nearby school of La Martiniere. History The house was constructed around 1800 by the British resident Major Gore Ouseley,nic.in accessed 10 September 2007 a friend of the ruler of Oudh, Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. It was initially intended as a hunting lodge for the Nawabs of Oudh, although it was later used as a summer resort too. Changes were made to its design by Nawab, King Nasir-ud-Din Haider (1827-1837). The building had patterned walls and unusually no inner courtyard as was traditional in Indian architecture. The building therefore had a smaller footprint and did not extend over a large area but was taller than traditional local architecture. Like its neighbour, La Constantia, it is located on the banks of Lucknow's main river, the Gomti. The Design for Seaton Delaval Hall The design bears a startling resemblance to the style of Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland, England. Seaton Delaval Hall was built in 1721 and was designed by Sir John Vanbrugh, who also designed Blenheim Palace. Dilkusha Kothi is depicted in a rare early albumen print by the photographer Samuel Bourne, dating from 1864‚Äì1865.'The harvest of lost time'. Tehelka online newspaper, 20 September 2007 accessed 19 September 2007 The British actress Mary Linley Taylor was impressed by Dilkusha Kothi and named her own home in Seoul after it. She explained, \\"From that moment in India when first I saw Dilkusha, the Palace of Heart's Delight, I dreamed of this moment when I would bestow upon our home the name 'Dilkusha'.\\" Balloon ascent It is said that in 1830, Dilkushi Kothi was the location for an early balloon ascent by \\"an Englishman\\". This story is less notable given that the Frenchman Claude Martin who had been a neighbour when his palace of Constantia, later La Martiniere Boys College, was started in the 1790s. He too had arranged a balloon ascent in Lucknow and he died before the demonstration here.

In 1857 the house was held by Indian insurgents and was forcibly recaptured by British forces under the instructions of British commander-in-chief, Sir Colin Campbell. The British General Sir Henry Havelock died on 24 November 1857 from dysentery at Dilkusha. The map illustrated shows how the grounds were at the centre of the British military activity in September and November 1857. North west along the river Gomti is La Martiniere and further along the river is the Residency of Sir Henry Lawrence. These three buildings played a substantial role in the uprising in Lucknow. This building received heavy shelling. although the photograph above dated 1858 shows little evidence of major damage. A photo taken in 1898Photograph taken in 1898 accessed September 2007 shows the building in ruins so it would appear that the major damage was not in the siege.

Dick. Originally completed in 1960, this book was initially rejected by potential publishers, and posthumously published by a small press in 1984, two years after Dick's death. Plot summary Sometime between 1958 and 1962, Leo Runcible, a Liberal Jew, is working in the real estate field. On learning that Walt Dombrosio, Leo's neighbor, has had a Black visitor to his house in a \\"lily-white\\" suburb of Marin County, California, potential purchasers interrogate Runcible about the matter and ultimately incur his wrath over their narrow-minded bigotry. He thereby fails to close the deal and forfeits their friendship and a precious commission as well. But according to Leo's tortured logic it is Walt who's at fault for this unforeseen little debacle. So in retaliation Runcible opportunistically reports Dombrosio's later episode of drunk driving, leading to the loss of the latter's motor vehicle operator's license for a period of six months. Walt's wife Sherry then drives him to and from work every day, eventually landing a job working alongside her husband. Walt, however, being as he is an insecure, misogynistic, manipulating headcase, quits his own position over this incident and continues to fume over it as the weeks and months roll by. He eventually humiliates and manhandles his wife in front of their neighbors as a prelude to forcefully impregnating her with an unwanted child which she unsuccessfully threatens to abort. At the same time, Runcible has found what he believes to be Neanderthal remains in Carquinez, Marin County, and envisages rising property prices due to incipient archaeological interest and the avalanche of media coverage that naturally follows. As it turns out, however, Dombrosio is the culprit who modified and planted the modern human remains there to begin with. They are a legacy of the local 'chuppers' who developed facial, cranial and spinal deformations as a supposed result of the pollution of the local water supply. The novel ends around Christmas - Dombrosio's situation is at status quo ante: Sherry now back in the house and five months pregnant, having decided to forfeit her job in the city to keep the baby Dombrosio forced on her. He overhears a Christmas party in progress at the Runcible's home, and briefly contemplates visiting to end his dispute with Runcible before deciding against it. Dombrosio is then visited by a vision of a future with his little family several years later, after Sherry has presumably given birth to a malformed baby boy due to the possible teratogenic properties of the local water supply. This vision leaves Dombrosio shaken, as his wife realizes he shares the same fears about their unborn child. Runcible faces bankruptcy, having decided to purchase the local water company to ensure high standards of water availability for the community. The purchase of the water company has cost Runcible considerably and he is unable to make the monthly payments due on his home. Despite his principled choice to serve clean water to the community regardless of the cost to himself, he remains consumed with anger and resentment against the local community for their ingratitude at his efforts to improve the area.

When two parties enter into a loan agreement, the amount of interest payable over the term of the loan is calculated and then amortized across the loan repayments. Thus, each repayment can be considered to include two parts: one part repaying some of the principal of the loan, and the other paying interest. In the situation that a loan is terminated early, a portion of the interest originally calculated for that loan has not yet been paid, as this interest would have been included in the interest portion of future repayments that are no longer going to be made. Some lenders recover (\\"retain\\") some (or all) of this interest by adding it to the remaining principal of the loan when calculating a payout figure. This portion of the future interest included in the early payout figure for a loan is known as retained interest.  Usage in Australia  Most Australian lenders offering commercial loan facilities (including chattel mortgage, hire purchase and finance lease) for cars, commercial vehicles and business equipment add retained interest to payout figures for loans that are terminated early. The amount of retained interest charged varies from lender to lender, but generally ranges from 20% to 100% of unpaid future interest.

This threatens to greatly inconvenience his business tenant, used car salesman Al Miller, who rents a lot from Fergesson to sell his battered but superficially reconditioned old jalopies. Chris Harmon, an entrepreneur, advises Fergesson to invest in a new super-garage located in Marin Country Gardens. Jim takes a fall in the mud and has a minor heart attack during a visit to the property to personally verify its existence. Miller is convinced that Harmon is corrupt and makes an amateurish attempt at blackmailing him over his alleged (then-illegal) sale of salacious audio recordings. At the same time Al enters employment with Harmon as a curiously unqualified salesman of Classical Music. This, as it turns out, was an innocent administrative error. Al's actual assignment now involves the mass marketing of Barbershop Music. He sees conspiracies, machinations and double-dealings where there are none and strives mightily, but ultimately fails, to disrupt the final contract-signing between Fergesson and Harmon by playing on old Jim's paranoia. The strain of it all takes its toll on a recently injured, weakened, ailing Fergesson and he dies later that night at home. Al then discovers that his used car lot has been ferociously vandalised, although the exact time and date remain uncertain. This plays an unexpectedly important role in the unfolding of subsequent events. Things are not quite what they seem, and coincidence plays a starring role here.

The house was constructed by prominent Edwardsville citizen and Illinois politician Benjamin Stephenson. He died shortly after the home's completion and the home had 15 subsequent owners, some of whom made major alterations to the original structure. In 1845 the addition of an ell altered the appearance of the house. The last two owners were the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and the current owner, the city of Edwardsville. In 1999 the city of Edwardsville purchased the home from the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and in 2001 a restoration project began. The project aimed to restore the house to its authentic 1820s appearance and open the house as a public museum. The house has been the subject of tales of ghostly activity since at least the 1970s, though no recent reports exist. The Stephenson House has prominence for its architecture and for its affiliation with Illinois politics. The building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Location The Benjamin Stephenson House was originally located on a tract of land about two miles (3 km) from the center of Edwardsville, Illinois; at the time along the bluffs above Cahokia Creek. The house, today, is located along South Buchanan Street in Edwardsville, along one of the busiest stretches of Illinois Route 159.

The house was built in the early Federal style and was originally designed as a two-story rectangular building with four square rooms. The interior and exterior walls are of three course thick brick; the bricks were manufactured on site by Benjamin Stephenson's indentured servants. The exterior is composed of at least 100,000 bricks, all of which were made on the Stephenson House property. Each of the four rooms, two on the first floor and two on the second floor are 18 foot (5.5 m) by 18 foot (5.5 m) square and contain fireplaces. Five windows grace the second floor, while on the first floor there are four windows and an inset door which opens into the central hallway. On its interior, the Stephenson House, again, has brick walls. The central hallway is 7 feet (2.1 m) wide and stretches in a \\"Southern manner,\\" from the front to the back of the house. The central hallway contains the home's staircase. The four rooms' fireplaces are vented through two chimneys, constructed flush with the north and south end walls. The interior floor were originally of four inch (102 mm) wide pine board and covered with oak during the 1940s. The staircase is made of red cypress and features relatively ornately carved woodwork, all of which is original and cast in Adam style. The restored, interior kitchen at the Stephenson House. Note the restored fireplace. Behind (west of) the original house was a detached, 20 foot (6.1 m) by 20 foot (6.1 m) kitchen constructed over a fruit cellar. The detached kitchen was torn down when the home underwent extensive remodeling in 1845. During this time period a two-story wing was added to the home. The wing, 20 foot (6.1 m) by 40 foot (12.2 m), altered the home's appearance into an ell pattern. The ell was built of the same brick as the original home, but covered six windows with its construction on the Stephenson House's west (rear) facade. A 13-foot (4.0 m) wide veranda was attached to the wing's south side. The entire new addition was cast in the Greek Revival style. The subsequent owner made further alterations to the house in 1902. The owner added a 20-foot (6.1 m) by 12 foot (3.7 m) Victorian front porch, complete with a gable roof and Victorian style wood tracery. He also reversed the home's staircase and filled in all four original fireplaces. During the 1940s the home underwent further remodeling, in part, to modernize the building. Inside, modern plumbing was added and outside a frame one car garage was attached to the west end of the house. The 1902 porch was torn off the east facade, thus restoring it to its original appearance. In addition, the pillars on the south side of the house were replaced with square designs and a French door was cut into the north facade to open onto a brick terrace. Purported hauntings Stories of alleged ghostly phenomena at the Stephenson House date back to at least the 1970s.Henry. \\"Inside the Stephenson House - April 3, 2003 ,\\" Henry's Newsletter, Newsletter #33, Friends of Col. Benjamin Stephenson House. Retrieved 19 September 2007. Speculation about the identity of the purported spirit has centered around Benjamin Stephenson, who died in the house. One former resident, who lived in the house during the 1970s told a local newspaper about phantom footsteps, odd noises, and the appearance of someone on the terrace when no one was there. Members of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity recalled similar and different incidents. Former fraternity members reported, not only the phantom footsteps, but servants peering out from behind mirrors and \\"people\\" in military uniforms. A Stephenson House volunteer and Edwardsville historian reported that in her years of work at the house she has yet to experience any ghostly phenomena.Saxton, Jennifer Kapiolini. \\"Haunted: Ghost stories from around the region,\\" Belleville News Democrat (Belleville, Illinois), 23 October 2006. Retrieved 19 September 2007. Significance The Benjamin Stephenson House is the oldest brick house in Edwardsville and considered significant for its architectural beauty, and association with important historic Illinois figures. Architecturally, the house is representative of an era. Most of the house's importance comes from its association with the family of Benjamin Stephenson. The Stephenson family played a prominent role in Illinois politics. Benjamin Stephenson served as a colonel during the War of 1812 and later held several political offices including U.S. representative from the Illinois Territory and delegate to the first Illinois constitutional convention. In 1836 the Illinois legislature named Stephenson County, in northern Illinois, after him. One of his sons, James W. Stephenson, also played a prominent role in Illinois politics as the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in 1836. Commonly, and mistakenly, the house is often referred to as the \\"Edwards House\\". This is due to the close association of the Stephenson family with that of first Illinois territorial Governor Ninian Edwards. The historical record shows that Benjamin Stephenson and Edwards were close personal friends and political allies.\\"History ,\\" Benjamin Stephenson House, official site. Retrieved 19 September 2007. The pair led the Edwardsville Jacksonian Democratic Party and when Edwards' house burned he and his family took up residence in the Stephenson House for a time. The Benjamin Stephenson House is the remaining piece of architecture which intertwines the two men's personal stories. For its architectural style and political affiliations the Benjamin Stephenson House was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on May 31, 1980. As early as 1972 Illinois State Senator Sam Vadalabene sponsored a bill meant to authorize the state to purchase the Stephenson House and open it to the public as an Illinois State Historic Site. Though the bill passed the Illinois House of Representatives, then-governor Richard Buell Ogilvie vetoed the legislation.London, Donna. \\"Events set at Stephenson House ,\\" Edwardsville Intelligencer (Edwardsville, Illinois), 10 May 2001.

Born in London, he studied at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama under Bantock Pierrepoint. He recorded under his own name and as variously Richard Condor, William Duncan, Harry Durrant, Robert Durrant, Ernest Gray, Bobby Gray, Robert Oswald, and perhaps some others. His recording repertoire was varied ranging from popular songs of the day, sentimental songs, hymns and sacred songs, British patriotic songs (particularly during the First World War) as well as Classical music, most notably a complete recording of Gounod's Faust in 1929 under Sir Thomas Beecham under the Columbia label. He also took part in recordings of several Gilbert and Sullivan operettas as well as Edward German's Merrie England under the direction of Joe Batten. Shortly after the Titanic disaster in 1912 he recorded two songs (on both sides of the same record), \\"Stand by your Post\\" and \\"Be British\\" in memory of the victims. The proceeds from the record's sales went towards helping the victims' families. This was one of the earliest examples of producing recordings to raise funds for charitable causes and it is one that has been continued in subsequent years, most notably with Live Aid in the 1980s and Bob Geldof's record Feed the World to raise money for victims of the Ethiopia Famine in 1984. This was the continuation of a tradition that had its origins with Robert Carr's Titanic record. During the First World War (where he served in the British Army) he recorded a number of songs as part of the recruiting effort and to bolster morale, most notably \\"We Must All Fall In\\" and \\"Laddie in Khaki\\", composed by Ivor Novello. In addition to being a recording, concert and opera singer, Robert Carr was also a leading figure with concert parties which provided light entertainment at British holiday resorts in the years before the Second World War. He owned one such party called the Georgians. During the Second World War, Robert Carr worked for ENSA, an organisation which provided entertainment for British servicemen serving in the war. After the war, he also taught singing at his old music college, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He died in Essex, England on 20 November 1948.

Examples of small atoms are hydrogen, boron, carbon and nitrogen. The compounds are industrially important. History The idea of interstitial compounds was started in the late 1930s and they are often called Hagg phases after H√§gg.Wells 56486 (1962) Structural Inorganic Chemistry 3rd edition, Oxford University Press Transition metals generally crystallise in either the hexagonal close packed or face centered cubic structures, both of which can be considered to be made up of layers of hexagonally close packed atoms. In both of these very similar lattices there are two sorts of interstice, or hole: *2 tetrahedral holes per metal atom, i.e. the hole is between four metal atoms *1 octahedral hole per metal atom, i.e. the hole is between six metal atoms It was suggested by early workers that: *the metal lattice was relatively unaffected by the interstitial atom *the electrical conductivity was comparable to that of the pure metal *there was a range of composition *the type of interstice occupied was determined by the size of the atom These were not viewed as compounds, but rather as solutions, of say carbon, in the metal lattice, with a limiting upper ‚Äúconcentration‚Äù of the smaller atom that was determined by the number of interstices available. Current A more detailed knowledge of the structures of metals, and binary and ternary phases of metals and non metals shows that: *generally at low concentrations of the small atom, the phase can be described as a solution, and this approximates to the historical description of an interstitial compound above. *at higher concentrations of the small atom, phases with different lattice structures may be present, and these may have a range of stoichiometries. One example is the solubility of carbon in iron. The form of pure iron stable between 910 ¬∞C and 1390 ¬∞C, Œ≥-iron, forms a solid solution with carbon termed austenite.

Built by Swan and Maclaren in 1927, it was then the tallest building in Chinatown and was known as Nam Tin Building (), owned by Lum Chang Holdings. The building housed the six-storey Great Southern Hotel (the first Chinese hotel with a lift), along with a few shops and cabarets that were popular among Chinese travellers. In 1993, Lum Chang Holdings sold the building to Hong Kong businessman Yu Kwok Chun, who converted it to the first Yue Hwa Chinese Products department store in Singapore in 1994. The renovation process, which conserved the exterior while adding features such as an atrium and waterfall to the interior, won the building the Architectural Heritage Award by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in 1997. History=Great Southern Hotel Also known as Nam Tin Hotel, the Great Southern Hotel in Singapore's Chinatown was built by Swan and Maclaren in 1927.The word \\"Great\\" was added to the hotel's name only later: Started as a boutique hotel, it was the tallest building in Chinatown when it was completed. It was also the first Chinese hotel in Singapore with a lift. Its height also gave it an unfortunate reputation as the focal point of many suicide attempts in its early days, until the tall Singapore Improvement Trust flats at Upper Pickering Street were built.Chinatown Heritage Centre, Great Southern Hotel exhibit. Photo reference: http://www.rajeevmahajan.com/2014/08/every-face-has-story-to-tell- every_52.html Owned by Lum Chang Holdings, the building housing Great Southern Hotel was called \\"Nam Tin\\" in Cantonese, meaning \\"southern sky\\". This choice of name is curious because the Chinese's discovery of the sky around the southern celestial was relatively recent, when Xu Guangqi interpreted European star charts. It is thus possible that this building in Singapore, a colonial port, has a name in homage of this turn of events. Besides the hotel, Lum Chang Holdings also leased out the building to several tenants who operated shops and other businesses. The L-shaped ground floor was partitioned for 8 of these shops. People commonly referred to the entire Nam Tin building as the Great Southern Hotel when the hotel subsequently became very popular. The Nam Tin Building became a major shopping hub for customers who found it fashionable to patronise the building's shops, outlets and cabarets. Chinese operas used to be staged at the building as an occasional attraction. The Southern Cabaret, based in the Diamond Dragon Dance Palace on the fifth floor, was of particular extravagance, as this article in The Straits Times describes it: > \\"Dragon pillars studded with cut glass‚Ä¶ constructed under the supervision of > Miss Leong Sai Chan, former Shanghai movie star, the cabaret is an imitation > of China's famed Peking palace. Beautifully coloured carvings of birds and > animals of Chinese mythology decorate the walls of cabaret.\\" Operated by the Cantonese, the Great Southern Hotel catered more to Chinese travellers, including celebrities from Hong Kong and China. This was unlike the upmarket hotels like Raffles Hotel, Goodwood Park Hotel and Adelphi Hotel which then accommodated mainly Europeans and English-speaking visitors. As a boutique hotel with shops and entertainment outlets for rich Chinese immigrants, the Great Southern Hotel was considered as the \\"Raffles Hotel of Chinatown\\". Each room had its own ensuite shower and toilet, and was given a roomy feeling by the 4m high ceiling and cast iron casement windows. The latter let in far more light than the wooden windows commonly found on shophouses in the-now Kreta Ayer Conservation Area, which were largely in the Transitional and Art Deco styles. Celebrities, artists, and merchants enjoyed fine food, opium, and liquor at the Great Southern Hotel, which had novel Western pleasures, such as a disco ball specially imported from the USA. The allure of Western goods and traditions even extended to weddings held at the hotel. A prolific Chinese writer, Wu Sijing, held her 17-table wedding banquet there in 1952, and was photographed in a white bridal dress, with her husband in a white suit and bowtie. This choice of dress would have been most unusual amongst mainland Chinese due to the nationalistic influence of Mao-era China, highlighting Singapore's confluence between Eastern and Western cultures, of which the hotel was at the forefront. Both in decor, and activities. The building and its tenants were such an anchoring presence in the area that Eu Tong Sen street was colloquially known as ÂçóÂ§©Ââç, or, \\"In front of Nam Tin\\". The pre-eminence of the Great Southern Hotel as an entertainment destination did not last. In 1956, the Cathay Organization bought the adjacent Majestic Theatre and transformed it into an attraction that drew film stars from Hong Kong. Changing entertainment preferences, a depressed economy, and socio- political unrest also contributed to the decline of Chinese opera and dances at the hotel. The popularity of Chinese opera declined throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and by 1959, even famous wayang theatres just one block down the street, such as Heng Seng Peng and Heng Wai Sun were closed (People's Park Complex was built over that spot). \\"Taxi dancers\\", so-named because these dancers-for-hire would hang around cabarets like waiting taxis, were also falling out of fashion with the introduction of rock ‚Äôn‚Äô roll at dance clubs, a genre of music that was then becoming increasingly popular with youths. By the 1960s, these dances were the most popular form of entertainment for Singaporean youth, and the hotel's cabaret took a backseat. Nam Tin‚Äôs fa√ßade reflected this decline. Through the 1960s to 1980s, the large red \\"Southern Cabaret\\" signage that adorned the Eu Tong Sen Street-facing side of the building were removed, and branding of the building became more nondescript. The red hotel signage on the corner arch of the ground floor also faded; with the lack of maintenance, they were barely visible by 1988. The shops at the ground floor also changed with the clientele. While shopping there was once seen as fashionable, stalls selling common electrical appliances now took up most of the ground floor frontage. The rooftop balcony and loggia visibly fell into disuse, with half-collapsed banners that advertised events that had passed by a year ago. Yue Hwa Chinese Products In 1993, the building was purchased by Yue Hwa Chinese Products Emporium Ltd., whose flagship location in Tsim Sha Tsui is pictured. In 1993, Lum Chang Holdings sold the building at a price of S$25 million to Yu Kwok Chun, who was the head of a Hong Kong-based multinational corporation with its flagship department store, Yue Hwa Chinese Products Emporium. The company, set up by Yu's father in 1959, is a global corporation of 35 companies involved in investments, travel and general trading. Yue Hwa's three department stores in Hong Kong are popular with both Hong Kongers and tourists. Besides agricultural produce from various provinces of China, the stores also sell jade carvings, handicrafts, antiques and medical products such as ginseng, antlers and cordyceps. In February 1994, the Great Southern Hotel ended its operations from the building as the hotel faced increasing competition in the hospitality industry. At the time of its closure, the hotel was operating only 40 rooms that were equipped with a double-bed and a ceiling fan, catering mainly to budget travellers from Malaysia and Indonesia. The other seven existing tenants of the building vacated their businesses after the building was sold, and were each paid a compensation sum. As the 999-year leasehold building has been gazetted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for architectural conservation, the new owner was asked to preserve the building's fa√ßade. There were, however, no similar restrictions on its interiors. Renovation works were carried out on the building from 1994 to 1995. The Nam Tin building was then converted into the Yue Hwa Chinese Products department store, and was renamed Yue Hwa Building. The department store was opened on 9 October 1996, and sells a range of traditional Chinese products including herbs, medicines, porcelain, furniture, arts and crafts, garments and textiles. Architecture=Original design Being one of the tallest buildings in Singapore in the early 20th century, the Great Southern Hotel was an important landmark of Chinatown. Designed by Swan and Maclaren, the architectural style of the Nam Tin Building was that of the Modern Movement. The building was designed to be strictly functional. The grey-coloured fa√ßade of the Great Southern Hotel seemed to consist only of the bare essentials, with ordinary designs like strong horizontal lines with angular arches and simple cornices. The building was fitted with steel frame windows, with metal railings and grills, which were considered fashionable in the 1930s. The loggia on the uppermost floor was a little lighter in colour with the use of cast iron balustrades and brackets, and there was extensive use of green glass. The building was one of the first in Singapore to be built as an integral structure of reinforced concrete slab and beam with infill brick wall. At six storeys, the Great Southern Hotel was the first Chinese hotel to have a lift. The original design accommodated offices on the first storey, the hotel on the second and third storeys, a restaurant on the fifth storey, and a tea house on the roof terrace as well as a cabaret. The restaurant on the fourth floor was later converted into the owner's office. The whole of the fifth floor was occupied by a then- well-known cabaret, the Southern Cabaret. Shops and entertainment outlets, including a Hainanese kopitiam, were situated on the ground floor. Restoration The architectural firm engaged for the S$25 million restoration project was O.D. Architects of Bukit Pasoh Road. In accordance with URA's conservation guidelines for Nam Tin Building, the architects preserved the building's roof-top garden and balconies facing Eu Tong Sen Street. The interior of the building were revamped to accommodate an open layout suitable for a department store. Non-structural interior walls were torn down. A new atrium was created by constructing a wall on the second storey, and could be used as an exhibition hall. A four-storey high waterfall was built at the back of the building, which has a new three-storey extension. A stained glass skylight was used as an interface to join the old and new parts of the building. New escalators and lifts were added to serve all six floors of the building. As a result, total floor space was increased from 3,700 to 4,600 square metres (39,800 to 49,500 square feet), with 4,650 square metres (50,000 square feet) of retail space created for use by the store. Together with the acquisition of the Nam Tin Building in 1993, Yue Hwa Chinese Products invested a total of S$100 million to set up its first store selling Chinese products in Singapore. For its conservation and restoration work, the Yue Hwa Building won URA's Architectural Heritage Award in 1997.

She was purchased by the Royal Navy whilst still under construction in Britain for the Chilean Navy who had ordered her in 1912 as part of the . She was renamed after the Faulknor family of British nineteenth century naval officers. Faulknor was a large destroyer leader that served throughout the war in the Dover Patrol, a force tasked with preventing German raiding craft gaining access to the English Channel where vulnerable troopships and other targets were constantly available. Faulknor conducted numerous operations against the coastline of German-held Belgium, including participating in both the First and Second Ostend Raid during the spring of 1918. In 1920, following the end of the war, Faulknor and her surviving sisters were all returned to Chile, where she served as Almirante Riveros until 1933. Construction and design In 1912, Chile placed an order for six large destroyers, the , from the Cowes, Isle of Wight shipbuilder J. Samuel White in response to large destroyers ordered by Argentina. Almirante Simpson, the third of the class, was launched on 26 February 1914 and purchased, almost complete, by the Royal Navy on the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. She was renamed Faulknor and commissioned on 25 August 1914. White's design was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and full load.

Four funnels were fitted, with one thin funnel forwards and three larger funnels. The forward funnel was raised by following sea trials. 403 tons of coal and 83 tons of oil were carried, giving a range of at . The ship was completed with a main gun armament of six 4-inch (102 mm) Mk.

These guns were of an Elswick design for export to Chile, and fired a shell to a range of . A single 1-pounder pom-pom was fitted, although this was later replaced by a 2-pounder gun. Four single 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo-tubes were mounted singly on the ship's sides. In 1918, she was rearmed based on experience of Dover Patrol operations, with the side-by-side 4-inch guns mounted fore-and-aft removed and replaced by two single BL 4.7 inch (120 mm) /45 guns. These could fire a shell to . Service Faulknor took part in a sweep by the cruiser and 10 destroyers off the mouth of the River Ems on 25 October 1914 which acted as a diversion for a planned raid by aircraft from the seaplane carriers and , escorted by the Harwich Force, on the German airship base near Cuxhaven. Poor weather led to the abandonment of the operation, however, with four of the six aircraft unable to take off. On 5‚Äì7 November and 9‚Äì11 November Faulknor took part in patrols off the Dutch coast with the Harwich Force. In November 1914, Faulknor was recorded as part of the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the Grand Fleet. Early in February 1915, Faulknor took part in anti-submarine sweeps in the Irish Sea as a response to operations by which sank three small steamers on 30 January, and then in escorting the ships carrying the 1st Canadian Division from Avonmouth to St Nazaire. By March 1915, Faulknor had transferred to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. On 12 March 1915, Faulknor and six destroyers were detached from the Grand Fleet for anti-submarine operations in the Irish Sea where the German submarines and were active, disrupting the operations of the Northern Patrol, but they were recalled on 15 March as a result of increased submarine activity off Rosyth.. On 1 July 1915, attempted to torpedo the cruiser off Noss Head near Wick, Caithness. Faulknor led an unsuccessful search by twelve destroyers together with several trawlers for the German submarine. Faulknor was still part of the 4th Flotilla in March 1916, but by 24 April 1916 was leader of the 12th Destroyer Flotilla of the Grand Fleet based at Scapa Flow. Faulknor was still leader of the 12th Destroyer Flotilla at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May ‚Äì 1 June 1916, operating in support of the Grand Fleet. From about 19:15 hr Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), the Germans launched a series of torpedo-boat attacks against the British battle line, and the 12th Flotilla got into a brief exchange of fire with German torpedo boats of the 3rd Torpedo-Boat Flotilla. Faulknor then fired on the German torpedo boat , which had been disabled in an earlier action with , and ordered four destroyers of her flotilla (, , and ) to finish off V48, with the German destroyer being sunk by gunfire from the four British ships. At about 01:43 hr GMT on 1 June, Faulknor spotted a group of German battleships and manoeuvred to set up a torpedo attack by her flotilla. Faulknor fired two torpedoes at the German battle line, and while she claimed a single hit, both torpedoes missed although one narrowly missed the German battleship . One torpedo from Onslaught sunk the predreadnought battleship . On 2 November 1916, the German submarine suffered double engine failure west of Bergen, Norway, with responding to U-30 s distress signals and taking the stricken submarine under tow. U-30s radio signals were also picked up by the British who despatched three formations of warships to intercept the two submarines. Faulknor set off from Cromarty with six destroyers of the 12th Flotilla on 3 November, but was recalled later that day when the British intercepted signals indicating that U-30 had got her engines working again. Both submarines ran aground off Denmark on 4 November, and while U-30 managed to free herself, U-20 could not and was scuttled on 5 November. The Dover Patrol, protecting the Dover Barrage and shipping in the English Channel from German attack, had a shortage of modern destroyers, and as a result it was decided to transfer Faulknor and sister ship as reinforcements. Faulknor transferred to the Dover Patrol on 31 December 1916, joining the 6th Destroyer Flotilla.

He served as a member of the House of Representatives from 1919 to 1931, representing the Division of Wentworth in New South Wales. Early life Marks was born in Culwulla House, Jamberoo, New South Wales and educated at Sydney Grammar School. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1902. In September 1901 he married Florence Sandford. As a result of an inheritance in 1912, he was able to partly finance the building of his chambers, the twelve- storey Culwulla Chambers in Castlereagh Street, Sydney, the tallest building in central Sydney until after World War II. He won most major Australian yachting trophies in Culwulla I-IV, and participated in the trials of Sir Thomas Lipton's America's Cup challenger, Shamrock IV in 1914. In World War I he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve and served as a lieutenant in the North Sea and English Channel, commanded a gunnery school in Wales and returned to Australia in 1918 to encourage military recruitment. Politics Marks in 1929 Marks was elected to parliament at the 1919 federal election, winning the Division of Wentworth as a Nationalist. In a speech to the House of Representatives on 3 November 1921, Marks predicted that Armageddon would occur in 1934. He said that the Bible had foretold that a great battle would be fought in Jerusalem between the British Empire on one side and Germany, Russia and another great nation on the other side. This would be followed by the Second Coming of Christ, who would direct the Royal Navy to collect his chosen people from around the world and bring them to Palestine. Marks had been considered for promotion to a ministerial post, but was passed over. The Sydney Morning Herald noted that \\"his utterances regarding Armageddon are believed to have interfered with his prospects\\". However, in December 1921 he was appointed by Billy Hughes to the position of undersecretary in the Prime Minister's Department, assisting the departmental secretary Percy Deane and also answering questions on behalf of the prime minister in the House of Representatives. He received no official salary in the position, but additional compensation was paid to him out of the salaries of the ministers. Stanley Bruce abolished the position when he succeeded Hughes as prime minister in 1923. Marks took a strong interest in foreign affairs, aviation and the film industry. He was one of seven Nationalists ‚Äì including Hughes ‚Äì who voted to bring down the Bruce Government, forcing the 1929 election. Although he lost Nationalist Party endorsement, he was re-elected as an independent. Shortly after the election, he joined Hughes' new Australian Party. However, his time there was short-lived, as he resigned in September 1930 over policy differences and returned to sit as an independent. Marks joined the new United Australia Party on its formation in May 1931, but was defeated at the 1931 election by another UAP candidate, Eric Harrison. Later life Marks later in life Marks returned to his law practice after losing his seat. In 1937, he became the inaugural chairman of the Papuan Apinaipi Petroleum Company. He was commodore of the Royal Prince Alfred Yacht Club for seven years. Marks died at the age of 75, following surgery in the Sydney suburb of Paddington. He was survived by a son and a daughter.

The image features a kitten being chased by two Domo characters, the animated mascot of Japanese television station NHK, and has the tagline \\"Please, think of the kittens\\", which is a play on the phrase think of the children. Origin The phrase originally appeared as the headline \\"Fact: Every Time You Masturbate, God Kills a Kitten. How Many More Have to Die?\\" with a kitten photo on the cover of The Gonzo, a satirical publication produced by students at Georgetown University, in 1996. The phrase later appeared in the form that brought it viral fame: as a caption of an image created by a member of the website Fark.com in 2002, which features a kitten being chased by two Domo mascots. According to a 2007 New York Times Magazine article on Domo-kun, \\"Any major exhibition on the history of clowning around on the Internet would have to include [this image]\\". The article also described the meme itself as \\"resembling a public-service ad, with text that is sophomoric, funny and not worth printing here,\\" adding \\"it has been referenced and forwarded so many times.\\" A 2006 article from ICv2 stated, \\"Domo is probably best known outside Japan for his unauthorized appearance in a faux public service announcement that intones 'Every time you masturbate...God kills a kitten.' Needless to say this phony PSA is quite out of character with Domo's image in Japan.\\"\\" Cultural references In 2003, actor Dudley Sutton produced a one-man comic show, Killing Kittens, at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, based on the Internet phrase. XXXchurch.com used the retouched kitten image in a 2005 e-mail campaign. Westwinds Community Church held events which included presentations by Craig Gross, the founder of XXXchurch.com, which soon became the target of criticism from the church's community. Fox News quoted Jay Porter, an individual who used to attend the church; Porter stated \\"'God kills a kitten every time you masturbate' is not an advisable message to direct at children\\". In 2006, The Independent published an article which briefly referenced a \\"sex club called Killing Kittens,\\" a name inspired by the phrase. Later, in 2014, The Guardian reported about Emma Sayle, the founder of Killing Kittens, detailing it as a company which organizes sex parties for young models and actors.

The most commonly used rock includes marble, granite, and slate. Marble and Granite can look quite elegant, but do not have much scope for artwork beyond simple line drawings. Any sculptural shaping in these signs is typically very expensive. Slate has its own distinctive appearance which is also popular despite being again not suitable for carving. If gilding is desired, these signs should be hand carved for maximum visual impact. Sand-blasting, though less expensive, creates a rounded groove, with inferior reflective quality. Cast Metal (traditional) These signs are usually made of aluminium, iron, copper, bronze or brass in a smelting process where molten metal is poured into a mold and then allowed to cool. The unique and prestigious look can be quite appealing but signs produced this way do come with some disadvantages: they are costly to produce; quite heavy and the manufacturing process contributes to pollution and the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Brass tends to tarnish and corrode after a few years, as does iron. Also, artwork on these signs is generally restricted to a motif chosen from a gallery or a template to avoid expensive mold costs. Nonetheless, these signs do remain popular due to their traditional appearance. Ceramic Ceramic signs give a very traditional feel, though there is little scope for carving or sculpting, hence they can look a little flat. These signs tend to last very well once mounted. Care must be taken not to crack the sign in the mounting process, or by dropping it prior to installation. Ceramic signs tend to be expensive, due to the complexity of the manufacturing process. Acrylic Plates, similar to those made of stainless steel or brass, can be used where a more modern look is desired. Acrylic signs are best suited for indoor/outdoor or business applications, but can also be used for house signs. Light and inexpensive. Carved Traditionally made of wood, carved signs allow for the most creativity in terms of painting, shape, and sculpture. Western red cedar and redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) is most common, although cherry and oak are also used along with a range of darker tropical woods. Wood requires regular maintenance and repeated coats of varnish or paint. More recently developed synthetic materials, notably high-density urethane (HDU), have been extremely successful, allowing the same quality and craftsmanship coupled with a much greater weather resistance.Spielman, P.: \\"Making Wood Signs\\", Barnes & Noble, Oct 2003 Carved signs have been a traditional icon of the New England states in the USA, and are frequently also gilded with real gold. Traditional hand carving techniques are still used to create carved signs, although CNC routers are sometimes employed, and some sites exist which allow users to design their own sign prior to having it hand carved.

Its services include customer support, information technology, logistics, and finance. The history of Arvato goes back to the printing and industry services division of Bertelsmann; the current name was introduced in 1999. Today, Arvato is one of eight divisions of Bertelsmann, the media, services and education group. In 2016, Arvato had about 68,463 employees and an overall turnover of 3.84 billion euros.  History = Early years of Arvato  Bertelsmann was founded as a publishing house by Carl Bertelsmann in 1835. In the following decades, the company grew steadily. After the Second World War, it developed from a mid-sized business to a large enterprise. To meet the demand from the book club Lesering and the record club Schallplattenring, Bertelsmann massively expanded its warehouse and shipping capacities in the mid-1950s. In 1959, the Kommissionshaus Buch und Ton was established to make the production and service infrastructure available for other publishing and printing companies. Bertelsmann benefited from this due to economies of scale. A punch-card index at the Lesering headquarters was acquired from Lufthansa, which later became the basis for the information technology expertise of Arvato. During the first years, Reinhard Mohn was the sole owner of the Kommissionshaus Buch und Ton. In 1968, the company became part of the newly founded Vereinigte Verlagsauslieferung (VVA). Its purpose was the delivery of printed materials and records \\"in the name and on behalf of its clients.\\"  Business unit formation  Bertelsmann opened its printing business to outside clients in a similar way, forming a new company called Mohndruck in 1948. After purchasing powerful machines which required a high capacity utilization, Bertelsmann acquired more and more orders from other companies in the 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s, Bertelsmann founded and bought several other printing and logistics companies in France, Great Britain, Spain and other European countries. These became part of the printing and industry services division of Bertelsmann. From 1976, the branch was led by Mark W√∂ssner, who later became Bertelsmann CEO. Under his leadership, the expansion continued. For example, Bertelsmann entered the software and hardware distribution market in 1983. Until the mid-1980s, the printing and industry services division generated more than 20 percent of the sales of the whole Bertelsmann group. In the late 1980s, the company also expanded its presence in the United States. In the 1990s, it won two major clients for new service offerings: First, Bertelsmann introduced the loyalty program Miles & More on behalf of Lufthansa in 1993. Second, Bertelsmann became responsible for customer support for the launch of Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.  Restructuring and renaming  In 1996, Bertelsmann's printing and industry services division was spun off as a legally independent joint-stock company (Aktiengesellschaft) named Bertelsmann Industrie. Bertelsmann wanted to expand its service business even more. At that time, Bertelsmann Industrie had approximately 12,600 employees worldwide and generated sales of 3.28 billion Deutschmarks annually. In 1999, the company finally was renamed Bertelsmann Arvato to illustrate the transformation of the printing and industry services division to an international communications and media service provider. The name Arvato was a neologism with no special meaning. Under the leadership of Gunter Thielen, who became CEO of Bertelsmann 2002, the LP and CD pressing plants of Sonopress and the encyclopedia publishers were integrated in Arvato, too. With the inauguration of Hartmut Ostrowski as CEO of Arvato in 2002, the company laid the prefix Bertelsmann in the company name, but continued to use it for its logo (stylised as arvato BERTELSMANN). Arvato restructured its business in divisions for printing, distribution and logistics services, as well as storage media and information technology.  Change in the business model  Due to lower volumes of newspapers, magazines and catalogs, Arvato, Axel Springer and Gruner + Jahr founded a joint-venture for parts of their printing business; it was named Prinovis. In 2005, all rotogravure printing activities of the three founding partners became part of the company, which was the market leader in Europe from its very beginning. At the same time, Arvato entered the market for public sector services. One of the first clients was the district of East Riding of Yorkshire where Arvato managed local taxes and welfare payments, for example. In the following years, distribution and logistics became more and more important: Arvato Direct Services and Logistics Services were merged into Arvato Services. Especially in Germany, Arvato won more clients for this division, including publishing houses as well as companies in the high-tech and information technology industry. At the turn of 2007/2008, Hartmut Ostrowski succeeded Gunter Thielen as CEO of Bertelsmann, so Rolf Buch moved to the helm of Arvato. Under his leadership, Arvato started the loyalty program DeutschlandCard, for example. While Ostrowski focused on international expansion, Buch strengthened Arvato's presence in its home market Germany.  Reintegration of staff functions  In the 2010s, Arvato restructured its activities again: First of all, the company acquired the remaining shares of Prinovis from Gruner + Jahr. Subsequently, Bertelsmann merged most of its printing plants into a new division called Be Printers. Arvato increased its focus on high-tech, information technology, and e-commerce services, three rapidly growing markets, while printing stagnated. At the end of 2012, Rolf Buch was surprisingly replaced by , an expert for the said focus areas. Under his leadership, Arvato acquired the insolvent e-commerce company Netrada in 2014, which led to a massive expansion in Arvato's market position in fashion logistics. After two years, Berg left Arvato in mid-2015. Bertelsmann appointed Fernando Carro as CEO of Arvato; he also became a member of the Executive Board of Bertelsmann. As part of the restructuring, Arvato dissolved its Board of Directors and replaced it with an executive management team. The Bertelsmann corporate center took over some staff functions of Arvato, while some are provided from within the Arvato divisions independently. In 2016, the Arvato AG was merged into the parent company Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA and deleted from the commercial register.  Organization  Arvato is one of eight divisions of Bertelsmann. Together with the Bertelsmann Printing Group, founded in 2016, it forms the services divisions of the group. Based on sales of 4.8 billion euros in the fiscal year 2015, Arvato was the second-largest division of Bertelsmann after RTL Group. Countries outside Germany generated more than half of the revenue, with France and the United States being the most important foreign markets. In 2015, exactly 230 individual companies as well as five joint-ventures and associated enterprises belonged to Arvato, many of them for local business operations. In the fiscal year 2015, Arvato had 72,457 employees worldwide, an increase of 1,804 employees compared to previous year. Since 2014, Arvato has been organized in so-called solution groups, which were introduced during the era of Achim Berg. These operate largely autonomously not for products and technology, but according to client requirements and operations. Each solution group is led by chief executive officer. Currently, there are four solution groups for customer relationship management, supply chain management, financial services and information technology services. The Arvato management board consists of Thomas Rabe, Bernd Hirsch, Immanuel Hermreck, Thomas Mackenbrock, Rolf Hellermann, Andreas Krohn, Frank Schirrmeister, Frank Kebsch and Matthias Moeller.  Services  ; Aftersales Solutions Arvato provides services needed after the sale of third-party products to end users. These include the repair and preparation of devices. Since the 2000s, Arvato has helped fixing mobile phones, for example; one of its clients there was the HTC Corporation. ; Corporate Information Management Arvato provides many services related to the logistics of marketing and sales materials and other documents. The company organizes the production, storage, and distribution of these. In recent years, the connection between digital and printed works became more important. ; CRM & Customer Services Arvato offers customer relationship management services. The company operates call centers and manages digital communication channels for its customers, for example. Also, data mining processes and some solutions for the public sector are offered in this area. ; E-Commerce Solutions E-commerce is a strategic growth area for Arvato and for Bertelsmann, at least since 2014. The company's services range from the establishment and operation of websites and related infrastructure to the logistics of goods. One client of Arvato in this field is the fashion house Ahlers. ; Financial Solutions Arvato's financial solutions include payment processing, factoring, and debt collection services. Furthermore, the company's credit rating and risk management activities, as well as insurance services, are offered in this field. Financial services have been one of the most profitable Arvato businesses and are also a strategic growth area for Bertelsmann. ; IT Solutions Arvato Systems provides information technology services of many kinds. Primarily, the company is heavily involved in cloud computing. Arvato provides solutions for media, commerce, and several other industries. ; SCM & Logistics Arvato helps its clients with supply chain management, i.e. the provision of materials and products from manufacturing to the consumers. The portfolio of the company includes various solutions tailored to different industries, e.g. trade and fashion companies, information technology and high-tech companies or publishing houses. An example of the latter is the Vereinigte Verlagsauslieferung (VVA). This area also includes business intelligence services.  Criticism = Human resources and wages  The human resources and compensation policies of Arvato have repeatedly been discussed: In 2005, Arvato Direct Services built a call center in Cottbus, Germany. The company was criticized for seeking more than usual financial support from the local employment agency. The trade union Ver.di and others shared this view. 2007, Ver.di criticized the reintroduction of the 40-hour working week with Arvato Services. 2012, employees had to accept lower wages because of job cuts at Arvato Entertainment. Arvato rejected criticism in this particular case because decisions have been discussed with Ver.di previously.  Irregular credit scores  In 2005, Arvato acquired the credit agency Infoscore, headquartered in Baden-Baden, Germany. Its data, information and receivables management was merged with Arvato's subsidiary to form Arvato Infoscore, a company with a total of 1,700 employees. It became object of repeated criticism because of allegedly dubious credit ratings. 2012, for example, the public broadcaster NDR reported the case of a consumer who was refused to pay by invoice. This decision was taken by a mail order company based on a credit rating by Arvato Infoscore. Although the company hardly knew more than the name and address of the consumer and had no other adverse information, it gave a low score based on socio-demographic characteristics. According to a report by the State Commissioner for Data Protection in the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, outdated data were used for this credit rating. In 2013, another public broadcaster, WDR, made similar allegations: The television magazine Markt checked the credit reports of 80 test consumers. The magazine concluded that particularly credit ratings issued by Arvato Infoscore often were not comprehensive. There was a \\"significant gap\\" in quality of information. Furthermore, Markt pointed out that complaints about scoring providers like Arvato Infoscore were rising. Besides the credit ratings, data protection at Arvato Infoscore was the object of media coverage several times. 2015, the NDR criticized that the self-service website for tenant self-disclosures showed sensitive personal information of one entered the name, address, and date of birth. Without any further verification, Arvato Infoscore made available information on debt, seizure and mortgage payments, for example. Critics said that this opened the door for abuse. Arvato Infoscore instead argued that obtaining a self-disclosure for third parties was not permitted. Nevertheless, the disputed website was shut down. 2016, SWR, another public broadcaster, reported that Arvato Infoscore handles the collection of penalty fares for Deutsche Bahn. As part of this, information about travelers is passed without their knowledge. The lawyer Karl-Nikolaus Peifer classified this process as a breach of data protection and fair-trade laws. The SWR also provided evidence that Arvato Infoscore had used information from such penalty fares for credit ratings of some customers, too.  Facebook content moderation  In December 2016, SZ-Magazin reported that Arvato employees in the company's Berlin office sustained psychological trauma, including posttraumatic stress disorder, as a result of exposure to videos of torture, murder, bestiality, and child pornography they were required to evaluate as content moderators for Facebook. Inspectors from the Berlin (LAGetSi), the city's occupational safety and health department, visited the office in February 2017, but the inspection did not result in formal action.

His musical career began as the falsettist lead singer, and rhythm guitarist of The Rockin' Berries in 1961, who had a number of hits in the UK and Europe. The group was best known for its covers, and Turton did much of the searching and decision work as to what was to be sung.[ Jefferson] at Allmusic.com When the group broke up in 1968 Turton started a solo career, releasing a single, \\"Don't You Believe It\\", on Piccadilly Records. It flopped, and Piccadilly head John Schroeder suggested that Turton change his name to Jefferson. At that time Turton also recorded the original version of \\"Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)\\" (unreleased). The single \\"Montage\\" failed to chart, but its follow-up, \\"Colour of My Love\\", was a hit in the UK (peaking at #22 in the UK Singles Chart) and the US (reaching #68 on the Billboard Hot 100),[ Charts], Allmusic and an LP was issued following its success. A third single, \\"Baby Take Me in Your Arms\\", was not a hit in the UK but cracked the Top 40 in the U.S. (#23) and Canada (#15), justifying the release of a North American album. At the time of this single's success, Turton was hurt in a car crash, and so he did not make any live appearances. After a six-month hospital stay, Turton recorded a second which was never released by his label, Pye Records, and his career stalled in the UK. He began touring the US, where he was still able to get gigs based on the success of \\"Baby Take Me in Your Arms\\". He then secured a recording contract with Polygram Records, who released another album and a single, \\"I Love You This Much\\" (later a hit in Europe for Mouth & MacNeal). He resumed under his given name when The Rockin' Berries reunited in the late 1970s, and toured with them (as well as doing solo shows in the UK) into the 1990s. In 2001, Castle Records released The Colour of My Love -- The Pye Anthology, a CD composed of his 1969 album \\"The Colour of My Love\\" plus much of his previously unreleased Pye material.

Known as the \\"Rosa Parks of Iowa\\", her court battle against the Katz Drug Store in Des Moines in 1948, State of Iowa v. Katz, foreshadowed the civil rights movement and became a landmark case before the Iowa Supreme Court.  Life  Edna Mae Griffin was born in Lexington, Kentucky in 1909. Griffin was raised in rural New Hampshire as well as moved to Massachusetts. Griffin claimed she learned to read with access to The Crisis, a publication of the NAACP. In 1933, Edna received a degree in English from Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, preparing her for a career as a school teacher. While at Fisk University, she protested against Mussolini‚Äôs invasion of Ethiopia as well as met her future husband, Stanley Griffin. Edna and her husband moved to Des Moines, Iowa, on January 2, 1947, as Stanley was accepted as a student at Still College of Osteopathy and Surgery. Edna and Stanley had three children: Phyllis, Linda and Stanley.  Civil Rights  Edna Griffin claims she did not experience discrimination growing up in New Hampshire but did later while living in Massachusetts. When she arrived in Des Moines, Griffin got involved with the Iowa Progressive Party and supported Henry Wallace in the presidential race. Katz Drug Store On July 7, 1948, Edna Griffin, John Bibbs, Leonard Hudson and Griffin‚Äôs one-year-old daughter, Phyllis, were refused service at Katz Drug Store in downtown Des Moines because of racial discrimination. A waitress took their order for ice cream but after she was told not to serve them, she reported that they don‚Äôt serve colored people. Requesting to talk to the manager only confirmed the denial of service at that establishment. Griffin launched a campaign to force Katz to serve African Americans by leading boycotts, sit-ins and pickets. She also created a Committee to End Jim Crow at Katz. Griffin, Bibbs and Hudson filed civil suits against Katz. Edna was represented by Charles Howard and Henry McKnight, members of the local NAACP. The Polk County Attorney's Office prosecuted the Katz manager, Maurice Katz, under the 1884 Iowa Civil Rights Act which prohibited discrimination in public accommodations. Griffin testified against Katz in the criminal case. The manager was found guilty by an all-white jury and fined $50. The Iowa Supreme Court upheld the conviction in 1949. As a result of the civil case, an all- white jury awarded Griffin $1 in damages. Due to the work of Edna Griffin in the Iowa Supreme Court case, State of Iowa v. Katz, it became illegal to deny service based on race.  Later work  Griffin continued to be an active participant in the civil rights movement throughout the 1950s and 1960s. She founded the Des Moines chapter of the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE) being selected as the first president. Through the organization, Griffin planned a march from Ames to Des Moines dedicated to the mourning of four Birmingham children killed by white supremacists in a church bombing. With the financial support of her husband, they organized 40 Iowans to attend the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom led by Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963. Even at the age of 75, she went to Nebraska and sat in the middle of the highway to stop nuclear warheads from being shipped into the Strategic Air Command at Offutt Air Force Base. Through the years, Griffin was a contributor to The Bystander, a local African American owned and operated newspaper.  Legacy  Edna Griffin died on February 8, 2000. She has been honored as the recipient of many awards which include the Community Service Award from Blacks in Government (1993), Urban Dreams' Trailblazer Award (1998), and the Christine Wilson Medal for Equality and Justice (1998). Griffin was also awarded the YWCA's Mary Louise Smith Award as well as inducted into the Iowa Women‚Äôs Hall of Fame (1985) and the Iowa African American Hall of Fame (1998). The work of Griffin is also recognized throughout the community of Des Moines. On the 50th anniversary of her successful desegregation efforts, the Flynn Building (SE corner of 7th and Locust), prior home of the Katz Drug Store, was renamed the Edna Griffin Building. At the same time in 1998, the Iowa Civil Rights Commission dedicated a plaque on the building to the dedication of Griffin and others that fought for civil rights. Des Moines Mayor Preston Daniels declared May 15 as Edna Griffin Day. In 2004, a pedestrian bridge in downtown Des Moines was named after her.

Apart from appointments to purely military orders, only gallantry awards have been included and only those that allow post-nominal letters (this excludes appointments to the Order of the British Empire for distinguished service and fourth-level awards such as Mentions-in-Despatches and Queen's Commendations). The list includes the rank and decorations the recipient held at the time, together with their regiment, corps or service, and the date of publication of the award in the London Gazette. The first honours list was published in October 2002, covering the period from October 2001 to March 2002, and subsequent lists have each covered six month periods of operations, ending in March or September. The latest list was published in July 2015 and covered the period ending 31 December 2014.  Victoria Cross  The Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest award for gallantry in the presence of the enemy, and is also the highest honour in the British Honours System. A miniature of the award is worn on the undress uniform to indicate the unique nature of the award. *Corporal Bryan James Budd, The Parachute Regiment, December 2006 (killed in action) During July and August, A Company of 3 Para were deployed into Sangin, where their position was constantly under attack. On 27 July, during a patrol, a member of Corporal Budd's section was shot and seriously injured in open ground. Budd led an assault against a building, causing the enemy to retreat, allowing the evacuation and treatment of the wounded soldier. On 20 August, on another patrol, Budd's section again came under heavy fire, with two soldiers being wounded. He assaulted the enemy single- handedly, continuing even when himself wounded. This inspired the remainder of the platoon to renew their attack, and force the withdrawal of the enemy. Budd subsequently died of his wounds. His \\"single-handed action... and his determination, though wounded, to push on against a superior enemy force stands out as a premeditated act of inspirational leadership and the greatest valour\\". *Lance Corporal James Thomas Duane Ashworth, Grenadier Guards, June 2012 (killed in action) On 13 June 2012, in the Nahr-e-Saraj District of Helmand Province, Lance Corporal Ashworth led his fire-team into the heart of an insurgent-dominated village. The initial attack resulted in the deaths of two insurgents and the recovery of two sniper rifles; however, the follow-up attack by Afghan local police stalled when a policeman was shot and killed. Ashworth moved to the front of his fire-team and pursued the attack, breaking into an enemy compound under machine-gun fire and driving the insurgents into an out-building. He then relentlessly crawled forward under fierce enemy fire to neutralise an enemy sniper with his final grenade. Placing himself in full view of the enemy to accurately throw his grenade, Ashworth was hit by enemy fire and killed before he could neutralise the sniper; however, his actions galvanised his platoon, which completed the clearance of the compound. His \\"total disregard for his own safety...was the gallant last action of a soldier who had willingly placed himself in the line of fire on numerous occasions earlier in the attack. This supremely courageous and inspiring action deserves the highest recognition.\\" *Lance Corporal Joshua Mark Leakey, Parachute Regiment, August 2013 The actions for which Leakey was awarded the Victoria Cross occurred on 22 August 2013 in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. A routine joint patrol composed of British paratroopers, US Marines and Afghan soldiers had targeted a village to search for illegal weapons. Having been flown into the area in Chinook helicopters, the patrol was attacked by machine gun fire and rocket-propelled grenades soon after dismounting. Leakey's helicopter had landed on a hill near the village and he, with three other paratroopers and an Afghan soldier, were to provide fire support for the main segment of the patrol. From their vantage point, his section could see the attack and heard over their radio that someone had been injured. Leakey ran up the hill to assess the seriousness of the attack and came to the conclusion that urgent action was needed. Though he was only a lance corporal, he took control of the situation and led his section down to the group under attack. Having reached the group under attack, he gave first aid to the wounded US Marine Corps captain and began to evacuate him from the battlefield. While under fire, he returned to the machine guns that his section had left at the top of the hill. He moved one to a better position to fire at the attacking Taliban even though he was under constant, accurate fire (bullets were ricocheting off the weapon he was carrying). His actions inspired other soldiers to join in the fight back. While he was manning the machine gun, he was also shouting updates of the situation into his radio. Having realised that more than one machine gun would be needed to effectively fight back the insurgents, he allowed his gun to be taken over by another soldier. He then ran once more through heavy fire to retrieve a second machine gun, position it in a suitable site, and then manned it to fire at the Taliban. The skirmish lasted approximately 45 minutes during which 11 insurgents were killed and four wounded. It was only when air support arrived that fighting ceased. When it did, he handed the second machine gun over to another soldier. He then returned to the injured American officer and oversaw his medical evacuation. The Ministry of Defence summarised the reasons for awarding Leakey the Victoria Cross as follows: George Cross  The George Cross (GC) is the highest civilian award for bravery, and ranks equal to the Victoria Cross. It may be awarded to members of the armed forces for acts of heroism not in the presence of the enemy. A miniature of this award is also worn in undress. *Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher, Royal Marines Reserve, July 2008 *Colour Sergeant Kevin Haberfield, Royal Marines, August 2005\\"No. 61311\\".

An interpreter that uses GIL always allows exactly one thread to execute at a time, even if run on a multi-core processor. Some popular interpreters that have GIL are CPython and Ruby MRI. Technical background concepts A global interpreter lock (GIL) is a mutual- exclusion lock held by a programming language interpreter thread to avoid sharing code that is not thread-safe with other threads. In implementations with a GIL, there is always one GIL for each interpreter process. Applications running on implementations with a GIL can be designed to use separate processes to achieve full parallelism, as each process has its own interpreter and in turn has its own GIL. Otherwise, the GIL can be a significant barrier to parallelism. Drawbacks Use of a global interpreter lock in a language effectively limits the amount of parallelism reachable through concurrency of a single interpreter process with multiple threads. If the process is almost purely made up of interpreted code and does not make calls outside of the interpreter which block for long periods of time (allowing the GIL to be released by that thread while they process), there is likely to be very little increase in speed when running the process on a multiprocessor machine. Due to signaling with a CPU-bound thread, it can cause a significant slowdown, even on single processors. Advantages Reasons for employing a global interpreter lock include: *increased speed of single-threaded programs (no necessity to acquire or release locks on all data structures separately), *easy integration of C libraries that usually are not thread-safe, *ease of implementation (having a single GIL is much simpler to implement than a lock- free interpreter or one using fine-grained locks). A way to get around a GIL is creating a separate interpreter per thread, which is too expensive with most languages. Examples Some language implementations that implement a global interpreter lock are CPython, the most widely-used implementation of Python, and Ruby MRI, the reference implementation of Ruby (where it is called Global VM Lock). JVM-based equivalents of these languages (Jython and JRuby) do not use global interpreter locks. IronPython and IronRuby are implemented on top of Microsoft's Dynamic Language Runtime and also avoid using a GIL. An example for an interpreted language not suffering from GIL is Tcl, which is used in the benchmarking tool HammerDB .

Konjin is associated with compass directions, and said to change position with the year, lunar month, and season. Konjin's momentary location in space at any given time is considered an unlucky direction, because this kami is stated to be particularly violent and said to punish through curses. Based on this, a calendar with astronomical and geomantic direction relations was created, which included interdictions (kataimi). A practice known as katatagae (changing directions) is used to avoid the worst directions on a given day, usually where Konjin, Ten'ichijin, and Taihakujin are currently located. Katatagae was favored among Heian-period nobles and it became a part of their daily lives. The construction and renovation of houses, moving one's residence, public works construction, and traveling was strongly influenced by katatagae. Konjin was said to be at tremendous power when residing as Kimon Konjin (\\"Konjin of the demon's gate\\") at either of the two demon's gates (the northeast \\"front\\" gate, called omote- kimon, and the southwest \\"back\\" gate, called ura kimon). Kyoto was supposedly protected from any bad influences by placing Saich≈ç's temple Enryakuji at Mount Hieizan, which is located to the northeast of Kyoto. Late in the Edo Period, in the province of Bitch≈´ (western Okayama Prefecture), Konk≈ç Daijin (Akazawa Bunji) began to learn a spiritual way later called Konk≈çky≈ç which began in spiritual experiences with the deity Konjin.

New Zealand police were quick to refute the claim and did not require to send another to the LAPD. The Federal Bureau of Investigation also offered their help in finding Xue. New Zealand police were criticised for \\"bungling\\" the investigation, including failure to discover Ms Liu's body in the Honda for at least two days, and slow response to issue a warrant for the arrest of Xue, allowing him to disappear in the USA.Police bungle Pumpkin case The Daily Telegraph, 20 September 2007 The United States Marshals Service issued a wanted poster for Xue, describing him as 'armed and dangerous'.

Arrest, trial and conviction On Thursday 28 February 2008, a group of six people living in an apartment block in Chamblee, near Atlanta, Georgia recognised Mr Xue from a photograph in the Chinese-language press. They attempted to inform the police but had difficulty in making themselves understood. In frustration, they captured him themselves. They removed his pants and tied them around his legs. They used his belt to tie his hands behind his back until police arrived to arrest him.Pumpkin's dad caught, Sydney Morning Herald, 29 February 2008. Xue initially attempted to provide a false name but he was identified from his New Zealand driver's licence. He had been on the run for 24 weeks. His overstay in the United States without an appropriate visa meant that he was liable for deportation rather than extradition. Xue was deported to New Zealand on 9 March 2008 to face murder charges over the death of his wife. His trial began on 2 June 2009. The prosecution presented evidence of ongoing violence and threats by Xue to his wife, while the defence argued that Anan Liu had been unfaithful and died in a sexual misadventure. On 20 June, Xue was found guilty of Liu's murder. On 31 July, Xue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum non-parole period of twelve years. Custody Custody of the child was sought by her maternal grandmother, Liu Xiao Ping, from China. The child also has a half sister, Grace Xue, who claims also to have been abandoned by their father at the age of 19, weeks after she arrived in a foreign country. The half sister, now 27, expressed an interest in caring for the child although they had never met. Qian Xun returned to Auckland on 24 September 2007 where she was soon reunited with her grandmother.Pumpkin's back in the family The Sydney Morning Herald, 25 September 2007 On 4 October 2007, the Family Court in New Zealand granted custody of Qian Xun to her grandmother, and visitation rights to her half sister, Grace Xue. Shortly after, Qian Xun returned to China with her grandmother on 6 October 2007. A trust fund for public donations, set up by Grace Xue, raised $NZ40,000 but the money was rejected by Qian Xun's grandmother. The money is now likely to be held in trust for Qian Xun's future use.

He was one of the ideologues of the Dutch Patriot movement and is considered by many Dutch as the founder of their democracy and political unity.Prof. J.Th.J. van den Berg, a political scientist at Maastricht University praised Pieter Paulus in his valedictory lecture, entitled De dominee en 'de tweede apostel Paulus' (27 September 2012), as the founder of Dutch parliamentary democracy and for that reason asked for a hall in the Dutch parliament building in The Hague to be named after him, a proposal that was echoed on the opinion pages of Dutch newspapers at the time. Cf. Van den Berg, p. 17; Cf. Hans Goslinga, Eer Pieter Paulus met een eigen zaal in de Tweede Kamer, in Trouw, 16 October 2012 (Honor Pieter Paulus with a dedicated hall in the Tweede Kamer) Life Paulus was born in Axel, Zeelandic Flanders, the son of Josias Paulus and Maria de Lege.Suringar, p. 2 His father was Axel's mill-builder, schepen and mayor. He came, perhaps, from a family of lapsed Huguenots. After an education in 's-Hertogenbosch, he received his training from the Vlissingen rector Van Cruysselenbergen, in whose house he lived. He became a student in Utrecht in 1770.Vles, p. 13 Paulus became known nationwide through his bestselling book on the stadholder system, in which he (just 20 years old) opposed both the stadholder system and the duke of Brunswijk.Though the title of the (originally anonymous; Paulus admitted his authorship only in 1775; Suringar, p. 21, note 2) work appeared to defend the stadtholderian system. But if one closely read his argument the positive remarks turned out to be \\"faint praise\\", and the negative criticisms of the practices of the Duke outweighed them; cf. Suringar, pp. 5-10 In 1774, he became a student at LeidenUp to that year he had been unofficially studying at Utrecht University, but he decided to transfer to Leiden University to write and defend his dissertation; cf. Suringar, p. 24-26 and he graduated on 12 December 1775, with his dissertation becoming a second publishing success. He established himself in 1776 as a lawyer at the Court of Holland in the Hague. In the following years he worked on his magnum opus: Verklaring der Unie van Utrecht (Elucidation of the Union of Utrecht) which became a standard work on the constitutional law of the Dutch RepublicAs often with the young Paulus, the work was not without controversy, as some accused him of plagiarism as he had not always attributed his quotations from the unpublished work of Grand Pensionary Simon van Slingelandt appropriately; cf. Suringar, pp. 29-43 which Paulus considered \\"the only Dutch constitution\\" (whereas others would argue that other treaties, like the Great Privilege, the Pacification of Ghent, the Twelve Years' Truce treaty and the Peace of M√ºnster were also part of the corpus that together comprised that constitutionSuringar, p.31). In 1780, he was involved in the controversy over the expansion of the fleet, defended by Admiral Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen.Suringar, pp. 68-72 In 1781, he married the very rich Fran√ßoise Vockestaert and bought the country house \\"Pasgeld\\" near Delft.Vles, p. 44. He again became nationally known in 1783 through his apologia for the city of Alkmaar, one of the first cities (after Schoonhoven) to pass a resolution to limit the influence of the stadholder.Suringar, pp. 78-88 Paulus became one of the leaders of the Patriot movement. In the early intrigues between the Stadtholder's Court, led by princess Wilhelmina of Prussia, and the fiscal of the Admiralty of Amsterdam Joan Cornelis van der Hoop to give her more influence to counteract the Duke of Brunswick, and to institute a secret Naval Council, Paulus was seen as a useful ally. On 13 April 1785, he was appointed public prosecutor (advocaat-fiscaal) for the Admiralty of the Maze, taking the initiative in its reorganisation, and being appointed as prosecutor in the Brest Affair.Suringar, p. 89 The Princess regarded him as the most sympathetic of her opponents (as she wrote to the Prussian ambassador), but his suggestion that the stadtholder should make an alliance with the democrats under the Patriots, she completely rejected.Cf. H.T. Colenbrander, De Patriottentijd, deel 2 (1898), ch. 3, p. 124 After the events in Hattem,The stadtholder, William V sent troops to occupy the city of Hattem that was a Patriot stronghold on 4 September 1787; cf. Vles, p.m 69ff. Paulus refused to come to Het Loo, but probably was in friendly negotiations with the French ministry of Foreign Affairs.Cf. H.T. Colenbrander, De Patriottentijd, deel 2 (1898), ch. 3 and deel 3 (1899), ch. 4 and 7 Paulus was not banished in 1788,Van den Berg, p.2 in the purge that followed the Anglo-Prussian suppression of the Patriot revolution, after being fired as fiscal of the Rotterdam Admiralty on the instigation of the new Grand Pensionary Laurens Pieter van de Spiegel in February 1788Ramaer, p. 758 but he left with Lambert van Eck for Paris. He spoke with Mattheus Lestevenon, and unsuccessfully mediated between the quarreling democratic and aristocratic factions of the exiled Patriots, led by Valckenaer and Van Beyma respectively. The French politicians and ministers received him with much esteem.Baggerman, A. and R.M. Dekker, Child of the Enlightenment: Revolutionary Europe Reflected in a Boyhood Diary (2009), pp. 15-26 Convinced of the ideals of the French Revolution, he turned against slavery and in 1793 published a treatise on the question: In welken zin kunnen de menschen gezegd worden gelijk te zijn? En welke zijn de regten en pligten die daaruit voortvloeien? (In what respect can men be said to be equal? And what are the rights and duties that follow from this equality?). The occasion for the writing of this work was an essay contest organised by Teyler's Theological Society in 1790. Another person won, but Paulus' entry immediately attracted far more attention and enthusiasm, especially among adherents of the Patriot faction. Paulus was even called an \\"apostle of mankind\\" by his fans.Van der Wall, pp. 46, 50-51 Pieter Paulus (center, left) in 1796 as president of the First National Assembly in The Hague. Engraving created in 1797 by George Kockers In 1795, he was one of the ringleaders of the Batavian Revolution. He was elected the first chairman of the Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland. He played a leading role in this assembly that in its turn had great influence in the Revolutionary States- General, where he led the Holland delegation (he was president of the States- General between 5 March 1795 and 1 May 1795Parlement & Politiek). One of the first actions of the Provisional Representatives was the adoption, on 31 January 1795, of the Dutch version of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen,Publicatie, behelzende de erkentenis en verklaring der Rechten van den Mensch en den Burger, gearresteerd den 31. Januarij 1795. Het eerste jaar der Bataafsche vriheid which was not simply a translation of the earlier French version, but contained original thought. It was drafted by a commission chaired by Paulus, and leaned on his 1793 treatise on Equality for its philosophical underpinning.Van der Wall, pp. 51-54 Paulus led the Dutch delegation in the negotiations with the representatives of the Committee of Public Safety of the National Convention of the French First Republic, led by Siey√®s and Reubell, in May 1795, which issued in the Treaty of The Hague (1795). Though the conditions in the treaty were onerous for the Batavian Republic, it at least retained its independence, and was recognized as such by its French \\"sister republic\\", a result that was far from assured beforehand.Schama, p. 207 Once the retention of independence was assured and the captured Dutch fleet had been returned to Dutch ownership, Paulus was a leader in the reforms of the Batavian Navy, like the abolition of the old admiralties, and the reform of the officer corps. The administration of the navy was taken over by the standing Committee on Naval Affairs, of which Paulus again became the chairman.Jonge, J.C. de, Geschiedenis van het Nederlandsche Zeewezen, deel 5 (Kruseman, 1862), pp. 203-208 One of the political issues in the Revolutionary States-General was the question of how far to go in democratising the country and making it a unitary state, in which the defenders of the privileges of the Regenten (also those of the \\"Patriot\\" persuasion) and of provincial particularism opposed the radical democrats (gaining a large following in the political clubs in the city quarters of the larger cities) and the unitarists. The former wanted as little change in the old constitutional order as possible, while the latter proposed to completely overturn that old order and replace the States-General, and the institutions on which it was based, with a National Assembly for the entire country, elected with male universal suffrage. Paulus was a leading member of a commission of the Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland that presented a proposal on the latter lines to the States-General that was eventually adopted on a vote of 4 provinces (Holland, Utrecht, Overijssel and Gelderland) against 3 by the States-General. Zeeland, Friesland and Groningen remained opposed until in January 1796 popular unrest in those provinces forced the hands of the provincial governments. Elections for the proposed National Assembly of the Batavian Republic were held in early 1796.Schama, pp. 229, 236-244 On 1 March 1796 Paulus was unanimously elected the first chairman of the National Assembly of the Batavian Republic. At the inauguration, he caught a serious coldRamaer tells us that after he walked without a hat in the inaugural parade on March 1, he caught the cold. On March 4 a scandal developed, when an alternate member of the National Assembly, Reinier Bouwens, accused Paulus of having caused the loss of the Dutch Cape Colony in the previous year, because of his role in the bankruptcy of the VOC. Paulus then removed himself from the hall while this was debated, and stood for a long time in a cold and drafty antechamber, which probably contributed to him developing pneumonia on March 7. The National Assembly declared the accusation baseless on March 25 after a thorough investigation of the matter; cf. Ramaer, pp. 759-760. from which he died, on 17 March 1795 in 's-Gravenhage, aged 42.

The deadline for registration was on the 12th May 1954 and those who fail to register would either be jailed or fined. On the 12th May 1954, students from the Chinese Middle Schools still did not register themselves for National Service. In light of the impending deadline for registration and with requests from the Chinese students, Chief Secretary William Goode would later meet representatives from the affected student body in the government house on 13 May 1954. On 13 May 1954, students gathered to present their petition to Chief Secretary William Goode. However, the peaceful demonstration turned into a clash between the police and students. More than 2 dozen people were injured and 48 students were arrested. The demonstration of 13 May 1954 was followed by further demonstrations and proved a key moment in galvanizing popular opposition to colonial rule.  Background  Following the end of the Japanese Occupation in 1945, the British sought to regain political control over Singapore, what was a vital strategic centre to them. The British Military Administration was set up, focusing on the reorientation of the state in order to meet post-war crisis. The British set sights to bolster social and economic life, and to secure their footing in Singapore (Harper, 2001). Of the social programmes that the government laid out, the most far-reaching and critical was education. The British envisioned setting up \\"national schools\\", prioritizing English-medium education and undermining vernacular education. With that, Chinese schools were starved of funding, resulting in anger and resentments among the Chinese students and teachers. This led to the rise in anti-colonial sentiments. This growing anti-colonial sentiment was further fueled by the larger anti-colonial sentiment that was also happening outside Singapore - how winning freedom for colonies in Africa and Asia played a part in instilling hope in the progressive left in Singapore ‚Äì that independence may come one day. One good example was also the defeat of the French at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam (1954). Moving into 1948, the outbreak of communist insurrection in the Malayan jungles, saw the declaration of emergency in Singapore. The declaration of emergency which was to last for almost a decade, saw heightened security control. Singapore was turned into a police state, progressives and anti-colonial activists were rounded up, and political repression suspended all forms of left-wing politics in Singapore (Turnbull, 2009). While organized opposition to colonial rule was difficult, nevertheless, the period was plagued with social discontent and stirrings of anti-colonial and nationalistic sentiments in view of the British's plan to consolidate and maintain rule, following the Japanese occupation (Quee, Tan, & Hong, 2011).  13 May 1954  In December 1953, the National Service Ordinance was passed, requiring the registration of all male British subjects and Federal citizens between the ages of 18-20 for part-time military training. After the announcement was made regarding the National Service draft, personnel involved were to register for the call-up from 8 April ‚Äì 12 May 1954. By 12 May 1954, students from the Chinese Middle Schools still did not register themselves for National Service (NS). In light of the impending deadline for registration and with requests from the Chinese students, Chief Secretary William Goode would later meet representatives from the affected student body in the government house on 13 May 1954. This day however, resulted in a clash between Chinese Middle School students and riot squads. More than 2 dozen were reportedly injured and nearly 50 students were arrested. Of those arrested, 7 were convicted of obstructing the police. Following the riot, students re-assembled in Chung Cheng High School and only dispersed in the afternoon on 14 May 1954. On 18 May 1954, a delegation of students (the 55-member Chinese Middle Schools Student Delegation) met the Chinese Chamber of Commerce (CCC), requesting their (CCC) help to speak to the British government on their (the students) behalf. However, the only concrete result from this meeting was having their school holidays being pushed forward by 2 weeks to deny students the opportunity to rally together. Having their school holidays pushed forward, this action prompted a second massive sit in by the students which took place on 23 May 1954 in Chung Cheng High School. However, due to the prevention of food supplies from reaching these students, the group dispersed. The third massive sit in took place in the Chinese High School on 2 June 1954. This time, students requested for the postponement of call-up for National Service. Though, the lack of response from the government saw the students went on hunger strike on the 15 June. The students only dispersed on the 24 June. Constant negotiations were made back and forth between the students and the government in the following days. However, due to the resistance put up by the students, the attempt to recruit male youths for National Service took a back seat. The aftermath of 13 May 1954 resulted in the conviction of 7 students for obstructing the police during the demonstration, as well as further tightening of control over the students by the British.  Interpretations of 13 May 1954  13 May 1954 connotes different interpretations, and be characterized as: (i) 13 May 1954 as communist subversion, (ii) 13 May 1954 as Anti-Colonial Movement, and (iii) 13 May 1954 as a bottom up, spontaneous response to particular events.  _(i) 13 May 1954 as Communist subversion_  In the 1950s, the Chinese students were one of the largest groups involved in demonstrations and their motivations have been consistently credited to communist manipulation ‚Äì through the united front strategy. The united front strategy was a political tool employed by the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) with aims of regathering and rebuilding their strength which was greatly depleted in jungle fighting during the earlier years of the State of Emergency between 1948 and 1960. The strategy focuses on building relations and contacts with workers, peasants and students, emphasizing on how plans and arrangements should be made in order to gain mass. According to Singh (2008), the first step of this strategy is to engage students through the exploitation of communal issues. Singh quotes an MCP directive as saying: > The work of winning over the school children is very important and must not > be overlooked. Especially in circumstances where the enemy is stronger than > we are, the work of winning support from school children and organising them > is more important than military activities.(Sing, 2008) According to Lee (1996), the reason as to why the MCP chose to start the mass movement from the students can be attributed to the following reasons: (i) the MCP recognised these Chinese students as a valuable political force and worked towards systematically absorbing them into the communist movement and (ii) during this period of time, members of the Town Committee (a secret organisation operating underground as the executive arm of the Malayan Communist Party with its mobile headquarters on the borders of Malaya and Thailand) were arrested, leaving only the cells in charge of propaganda and cells in the Chinese Middle School, intact. The propaganda sector consisted of few people, but the student sector had many members. Thus, it was the student sector which had the manpower to launch the open united front struggle when the time came. However, in order to mobilise and arouse the students, an issue had to be capitalised upon. The National Service Ordinance was chosen to serve this purpose. In Lee's book, he also mentioned that in the eyes of the communists themselves, the agitation over the national service was a great success. Lee made this statement based on a following comment by Ng Meng Chang (a student cadre) : > ‚Ä¶. said that the tremendous success of the May 13 incident was beyond > expectation‚Ä¶ this was the most successful student struggle ever since the > emergency regulations‚Ä¶ Lee (1996) also concluded by saying that \\"13 May 1954\\" had seen the creation of many student leaders which should be given support to, as they become future pillars of the student movement. This statement was drawn from unpublished statements of ex-detainees. In conclusion, authors like Singh (2008) and Lee(1996) hold that the Malayan Communist Party was looking for manpower and the result of \\"13 May 1954\\" was a fulfillment of this aspiration. All in all, 13 May 1954 as Communist subversion was seen in the context of the cold war and in supporting this position, sources from scholars such as Lee (1996) and Singh (2008) are largely from colonial media.  13 May 1954 as Anti-Colonial Movement  Following the declaration of emergency in 1948, the political-left in Singapore grew vastly, both in size and power in 1954. This was attributed to the large levels of economic exploitation and social injustice felt by the people which then saw subsequent calls for self- governance and democracy. This was especially so for the Chinese when the decision was made by the British to prioritise English-medium education over vernacular education. With that, friction between the Chinese community and the British authorities resulted. Anger and anti-colonial resentments were felt within the Chinese community for English language represented colonial domination. This was not all. In 1954, both the Chinese leadership and student activists face further pressures when the British made even more demands by making English the only language to be used in the legislative assembly. The Chinese middle school students had however, also moved out of the parameters of strictly Chinese-focused issues by linking themselves to a larger historical context of anti-colonial movement. The Chinese students, together with the Socialist Club members of the University of Malaya, identified themselves with the students of China, India, and Indonesia who also played a role in their country's liberation. Both the English and Chinese-educated students were seen to be working together to resist colonial rule, and that the socialist club had a hand in organising \\"13 May 1954\\". This was in view that copies of the Fajar Publication (Issue 7) were found in the Chinese High Schools. With that, amidst the Chinese student's demonstration, the hostels of students from the socialist club were also raided by the police on 28 May 1954, and 8 members of the University socialist club were charged with sedition for articles printed in the Fajar Publication (Quee, Tan, & Hong, 2011). According to Loh (2013), this particular issue, dated 10 May 1954, and titled as \\"Aggression in Asia\\", was one that involved critical views on the ongoing Anglo-American Military initiative to form the Southeast Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO). In addition, the issue also contained comments on the National Service Bill which was passed in Singapore earlier on. It argued that by pressing students into military service, is in no way \\"national\\" for it entailed \\"a colonial people to be trained to fight wars in the making of which they have no part ‚Äì no choice of their foes or allies. Though we are not fit to rule ourselves, we are not unfit to die for other people's interests.\\" (Loh, 2013). Loh bases his opinion largely from the Fajar Publication itself. Anti-colonial sentiment was overwhelming, but the colonial authorities simply look upon them as the result of communist agitation. Common hatred (both Chinese and English students) of exploitation, British rule and the declaration of Emergency in paved the way for \\"13 May 1954\\", a resistance seen to be driven by overwhelming \\"leftist resentments against the British\\", with the rank and file on the ground taking initiative and moving without proper direction and control (Barr, & Trocki, 2008). In the view of scholars like and (Barr, & Trocki, 2008), \\"13 May 1954\\" represented the convergence of notions of nationalism (with help from the English-educated). The student resistance was very focused and uncompromising. It was evident that they were pushing the boundaries as far as the emergency regulations would allow, and anti- colonialism was the main engine driving their cause. All in all, 13 May 1954 as anti-colonial movement, was seen in the context of nationalism and anti- colonialism.  13 May 1954 as a bottom up, spontaneous response to particular events  Moving beyond the idea of communism and nationalism altogether, \\"13 May 1954\\" was seen as an episode of student activism that can be explained solely on its own terms, according to Thum (2012). Thum (2012) also said that in fact, the National Service Ordinance was actually supported by the Chinese - \\"The Ordinance was supported by the Chinese press who recalled the heroic defence of Singapore by volunteers in 1942. Community leaders also praised the ordinance and called upon the Chinese community to fulfill their glorious task of defending the country.\\" Thum bases his opinion largely from Chinese sources (newspapers) such as the Nanyang Siang Pao, Nanfang Evening Post and Sin Chew Jit Poh. In Thum's view, \\"13th May 1954\\" was an event triggered by the flawed implementation of the system of putting this ordinance in place such as how (i) Some overage students had been forced to miss examinations or leave school as a result of a call up, (ii) miscommunication and translation regarding the term \\"National Service\\" that resulted in adverse sentiments among these Chinese Middle School students (iii) the lack of documents sent to these young men to explain the purpose of national service causing many to believe that they would be sent into the Malayan jungle to fight for the British (iv) the ineffective registration process that disrupted lessons and (v) how the students were turned down time and again by the government when all they wanted was to \\"seek clarifications\\" regarding National Service. In addition, miscommunication and translation regarding the term \\"National Service\\" resulted in adverse sentiments among these Chinese Middle School students for it was mistranslated as minzhong fuwu, Ê∞ë‰ºóÊúçÂä°, which literally meant \\"servitude by the masses\\", a term with demeaning connotations implying the mass of the people acting as indentured servants of the elite. This discontent and miscommunication was further fueled by the ineffective registration process whereby Chinese Middle School students were provoked by the disruptive and authoritative conduct of the government team, who sent teams into Chung Cheng High School (the biggest Singapore Chinese Middle School) without warning, and went from class to class to distribute registration forms, disrupting lessons. Teachers who refused to halt their lessons were also forced to leave the classrooms, leaving students outraged and thus, the refusal to register for national service. This episode was repeated again on 23 April 1954 at the Chinese High School. On 13 May 1954 itself, representatives from the affected students made preparations to meet William Goode in government house to negotiate about the ordinance. The crowd (approximately 1000 people) that assembled in the vicinity of the government house to give their support were actually students from the Chinese inter- schools sports competition ‚Äî just a 30-minute walk away at Jalan Besar Stadium via Serangoon Road and Bukit Timah Road. The students were there to await the outcome of the meeting, and it was not a planned protest. In the days following 13 May 1954, tensions arose due to the \\"difficulties posed to the students by the Governor\\" when all that the students wanted was a form of written assurance for the postponement of national service for all students who are still schooling. According to Thum, once again drawing his opinions from Chinese sources, the process of appeal was made difficult for the students. For instance, their first petition was returned to them unopened because it was not submitted through \\"proper channels\\". With that, the students resubmitted their petition by registered mail however, the petition was again, returned to the students with the instruction that petitions from students should be submitted through the principal and management committee of their school. This was done, but there was no reply from the government once again. All in all, 13 May 1954 was seen in the \\"local context\\" and according to Thum, was a bottom up, spontaneous response to particular events on the ground. It was an episode of student activism that can be explained solely on its own terms. He draws his opinion largely from Chinese sources, which he sees as \\"fertile ground for histories seeking to access the Chinese sphere\\".  Significance of 13 May 1954  The aftermath of 13 May 1954 saw the formation of the Singapore Chinese Middle School Students Union (SCMSSU), and it was under the banner of SCMSSU that the 1950s saw more intense left-wing activities, for example, the Hock Lee Bus riots. 13 May 1954 also has a crucial significance in the politics in Singapore for it was through this event that enforced unity between students, labour workers and the People's Action Party (PAP) led by Lee Kuan Yew (a young lawyer back then) and leftist trade union Lim Chin Siong and Fong Swee Suan (both active in the bus worker's union). It all started with the Chinese students' decision to engage Lee Kuan Yew to defend the 7 students who were charged for obstructing the police on 13 May 1954. Prior to this, Lee Kuan Yew was also involved in fighting the case for the Fajar 8. Although the 7 students were eventually still sentenced to 3 months imprisonment, this episode allowed Lee Kuan Yew to build connections with the Chinese (especially the students and trade union workers), a group that was crucial in supporting his victory in the 1959 elections. The 1959 election was the first full internal self-government granted by the British authority and the People's Action Party led by Lee Kuan Yew won 43 out of 51 seats in the legislative assembly, forming the government. However, this landslide victory would not have been possible without the support from the Chinese community, especially that of the labour unions (as the Chinese made up the majority population in Singapore). The PAP appealed to the Chinese community by promoting workers' rights and establishing policies that aim to abolish Emergency Regulations, putting an end to colonialist exploitation. This was important for the Chinese community who have been fighting for their place throughout colonial ruling. One such example was the threat they face regarding vernacular education in light of the British's vision to prioritise English-medium education and undermining vernacular education (Trocki, 2006). In short, the PAP was able to draw on the concerns of the Chinese (which made up the largest population in Singapore) and garnered their support in the 1959 elections.

He also founded the cable company United Artists Communications Inc and post-production and sound mixing firm Todd-AO. He lived in San Francisco, California until his death on April 7, 2016 at the age of 94. Career Naify, the son of a Lebanese immigrant who built a movie theater empire beginning in 1912, has worked in the theater business nearly all his life. His father got into movie business in Atlantic City with a movie theater in 1912 where Robert and brother Marshall Naify (d. 2000) started as ushers, projectionists. The Naify brothers built the first movie screen in San Francisco, the New Fillmore and The Clay, which was first a nickelodeon house and one of the oldest theaters in San Francisco.They then moved to California in the early 1920s and built more theaters like the Cascade Theatre About this time they also acquired the San Francisco Theaters owned by Samuel H Levin. These theaters were the Balboa, Alexandria, Coliseum, Vogue Metro, the Harding, and Coronet, which was opened in 1949. In 1988 UA bought the Philadelphia-based Sameric chain of about 30 locations in PA, NJ, and DE. The UA Theaters main office was in San Francisco until 1988 when it was sold to TCI. Thereafter, it was relocated to Englewood, CO. United Artists Theaters After Inheriting movie theater empire Golden State Theaters, they purchased the United Artists Theaters chain. UA Theaters (established in 1924) has its roots in the movie studio of the same name founded by Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, and D. W.

United Artists Communications, Inc Just as they were in the theater business, the Naify brothers were also pioneers in the cable business. United Artists Communications Inc. was an early pioneer in cable television, and aggressively bought smaller regional systems. UAC became one of the nation's largest cable companies before merging with TCI. By the end of the 1980s, John Malone's Tele-Communications, Inc. was majority owner; on June 8, 1991, it purchased the remainder of the company.

He represented Peel in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Conservative member from 1913 to 1916. He was born in Brampton, Ontario, the son of James Fallis, and educated there. In 1899, he married Sarah Jane Lawson. He was elected in a 1913 by-election held after Samuel Charters resigned his seat in the provincial assembly to become Registrar of Peel County. He died May 11, 1935. Career In 1903, Fallis' steers were described in The Globe as being considered \\"the best that have ever entertained this market\\", the Union Stock Yards. At the 1912 meeting of Peel's County Conservative Association, Fallis was elected secretary. On 27 October 1913, nominations for both the Liberal and Conservative parties of Peel were held at the Brampton Town Hall. The Liberals nominated the Reeve of Brampton, A. H. Milner, while Fallis received the Conservative nomination. Fallis' speech outlined his loyalty to Premier of Ontario Sir James Whitney, and his \\"business-like way\\" of running the province, highlighting the discounts created by his public hydro policy, good roads program, and reforms to the election process to remove numbering from ballots. Provincial agriculture minister James Duff campaigned for Fallis in Streetsville. As incumbent, Fallis was chosen by the Conservative party as its nominee for the 1914 provincial election. Nominated by Reuben Lush, his candidacy was uncontested at the event, held at Brampton Town Hall. His acceptance speech denied misspending by his party's government, denied responsibility for rural depopulation, placing that blame on cities and Western provinces, and the introduction of the Workmen's Compensation Act. At the beginning of the First World War, Fallis travelled to Ottawa, \\"securing a letter from officers of the Militia Department\\" allowing him to sell them horses. Returning to the County, he formed a partnership with horse-dealer E. J. Jones of Brampton, and they identified animals at area farms for Government inspection; any that were \\"passed\\" were purchased by Fallis or his firm. Fallis profited \\"less than $3000\\" and Jones \\"about $3500\\" in the horses resale to the government. Sir Charles Davidson's Commission of Inquiry took up the matter, with the Commission's counsel suggesting he \\"intervened for personal profit when the vendor and Government had been brought together, without rendering any service.\\" Fallis insisted there was nothing wrong with the procedures, and that he didn't prevent farmers from selling direct to the government. After being defeated by the Liberal candidate, William James Lowe, in the 1916 by- election, he continued to be active in the livestock trade. After the death of Joseph Dixon in 1925, Fallis was sworn in as Peel's Surrogate Court Registrar and Local Registrar of the High Court. He shared Justice of the Peace duties with W. J. Fenton, as of 1929. He was also Chairman of the Brampton High School Board. Fallis sold 300 acres of his 500-acre farm in 1927, in four parcels. Personal life He married Jessie Fletcher on 6 October 1920. As of 1922, he was a Right Worthy Brother with the Masons, River Park Lodge, A. F. & A. M., No. 356, and as of 1929, the Potentate's Aide for a Rameses Temple. Fallis and Dr. D. L. Heggie were the Brampton Curling Club's representatives to the Ontario Curling Association as of 1930. He is also known to have refereed local lacrosse games, and served at least one season, 1911, as honorary President of the Brampton Excelsiors. His sister, Miss Mary C. Fallis, was a teacher at Caledon, Broddytown, and finally Central Public School in Brampton, staying the grade 2 teacher at the last school for 36 years. Mother Euphemia Ella Fallis died in 1933.

Although Readford himself never used, and had never been associated with the moniker, Rolf Boldrewood indicated that the 'Captain Starlight' character, in his 1882‚Äì83 novel Robbery Under Arms, was a composite of several infamous people of the era, including Readford and several bushrangers. Readford's 1870 cattle drive was a major story arc in the book. Early life Henry Arthur Readford was born in December 1841 near Mudgee in the Cudgegong District of New South Wales to a respectable family. Little is known of his early life. He originally operated locally, but later moved to Queensland where there were more opportunities for rustling. Bowen Downs Station In 1870, Readford was working as a stockman on Bowen Downs Station near Longreach in Queensland. Realising that remote parts of the property, which stretched some along the Thomson River, were seldom visited by station workers, he devised a plan to steal some of the station's cattle. With two associates, George Dewdney and William Rooke, he built stockyards in an outlying part of the property, and gradually assembled a mob of about 1,000 cattle, which he then took from the property, all without any of the station workers realizing what was going on. Readford knew the cattle would be recognised from their brands as being stolen if he tried to sell them in Queensland, so he headed for South Australia through the Channel Country and the Strzelecki Desert. Only ten years earlier, explorers Burke and Wills had set out to cross the continent along the same track, and died in the attempt. As a droving exercise, it was a remarkable achievement, as anyone who has travelled the present-day Strzelecki Track will know. Three months and later he exchanged two cows and a white bull for rations at Artracoona Native Well near Wallelderdine Station. They then moved the remainder of the mob via Mt Hopeless, and sold them for ¬£5,000 (2009:A$250,000) at Blanchewater Station, east of Marree. Workers at Bowen Downs eventually discovered the yards, and the tracks heading south. A party of stockmen and Aboriginal trackers set out on the trail, many weeks behind Readford. They eventually reached Artracoona where they recognised the white bull. In April 1871 Readford married Elizabeth Jane Scuthorpe at Mrs Elizabeth Nevell's home in Lewis Street, Mudgee, NSW. The couple had at least one child, a daughter, Jemima Mary Elizabeth, in 1872. Readford was apprehended in Sydney in 1872, and faced trial in Roma, Queensland. However, the jury members were so impressed by his achievements that they found him not guilty, whereupon the judge, Charles Blakeney, remarked, \\"Thank God, gentlemen, that verdict is yours and not mine!\\" In response to the verdict, in July 1873, the Government shut down the Roma District Criminal Court for two years but rescinded the order in January 1874. In 1881, several counts of horse stealing resulted in Readford being jailed for eighteen months in Brisbane. After his release, he drove cattle from the Atherton Tableland to Dubbo. In 1883, on behalf of Macdonald, Smith and Company, Readford drove 3,000 cattle which were the first mob taken to Brunette Downs near Corella Creek on the Barkly Tableland in the Northern Territory where he was the station manager. In 1899 he became the manager of McArthur River Station. Later life In 1901 Readford set off from Brunette Downs to explore Central Australia, but (in what one author would later describe as \\"one of the great ironies of the outback\\" Tony Roberts, Frontier Justice: A History of the Gulf Country to 1900 (University of Queensland Press, 2005)), the man who had guided so many travelers to safety drowned on 12 March of that year, while trying to swim across Corella Creek, which had flooded due to heavy rain. An inspiration for Captain Starlight Readford became something of a national hero, and the character Captain Starlight in Rolf Boldrewood's book Robbery Under Arms was based in part on his exploits. Readford was never himself known by the name of Captain Starlight, which was the pseudonym of the bushranger Frank Pearson. Pearson had adopted the name Captain Starlight in 1868, twenty one years prior to the publication of the novel in 1889, but Boldrewood himself claimed that the Captain Starlight character in his novel was a composite of several bushrangers of the era. These did include Henry Readford, but another key inspiration was Thomas Smith, the bushranger better known as: Captain Midnight. In particular, the early chapters of Robbery Under Arms recall Readford's exploits, while the denouement follows the shoot-out and death of Midnight. An annual Harry Redford Cattle Drive commemorates Readford's exploits as a drover. A range of riders from the city and country participate in this droving expedition, taking part for three days or up to three weeks, at their choice.
