She made six voyages for the Honourable East India Company (HEIC). On her sixth voyage, while under the command of Captain William Moffat, she captured the French 14-gun privateer Malartic. In 1803 her owners sent her out to India to sail in the coastal trade; her subsequent fate is unknown. Voyages First voyage (1786-87) Captain James Rattray commanded Phoenix on her first voyage, which was to Madras and Bengal. She left the Downs on 16 January 1786.British Library: Phoenix (3). She was reported to have been well on 6 May at , and within three weeks sail of Madras.Lloyd's List, - accessed 5 December 2014. She reached Madras on 20 May and left ten days later. She then arrived at Diamond Harbour, south of Calcutta, on 13 November. On her homeward voyage, she passed Saugor on 19 December. By 3 March 1787 she was at St Helena, and she arrived at the Downs on 18 May. On her return voyage she brought with her a beautiful gray Arabian stallion whose price, including transport costs, was £1510.Le Keux (1823), p.16. Second voyage (1788-89) For her second voyage, this one also to Bengal and Madras, Phoenix was under the command of Captain Alexander Gray, who would be her captain for her third voyage too. She left the Downs on 17 February 1788, and on 16 March was at Madeira. She reached Diamond Harbour on 19 July. She passed Saugor on 5 January 1789 and by 20 February was in Madras. From there she sailed to the Cape, which she reached on 5 May. On 10 June she was at St Helena, and on 6 August she arrived at the Downs. On 22 September 1790, the Court of Directors of the HEIC held a secret meeting to investigate allegations that one of the directors, a John Woodhouse, had nominated Gray as captain for the voyage in return for \\"pecuniary consideration\\". The investigation came to an end when Woodhouse resigned from the Directory on 1 February 1791. However, there was no doubt that the infraction of the company's rules had occurred.Ghosg (1970), p.22. Third voyage (1791-92) Captain Gray again sailed Phoenix to Madras and Bengal. Before leaving, Gray engaged a Scotsman, Alexander Macdonald, to ship aboard Phoenix as his servant and occasional piper.MacDonald, Part III. Phoenix left the Downs on 4 Apr 1791 and reached São Tiago on 1 May. There a storm drove her out to sea and she almost wrecked on some rocks. She left on 8 May and reached Madras on 4 August. There she landed all her cargo, those of her passengers destined for that city. She also landed three officers and 220 recruits for the 72nd Regiment and 76th Regiment of Foot. On 7 August she left Madras, reaching Diamond Harbour on 13 August, where she discharged her remaining passengers. On 23 August she was at Kedgeree. In mid-October, she took on board \\"450 sepoys with their officers, and a cargo of rice, paddy, gram, doll, and gee for the army on the Malabar coast.\\" Phoenix delivered the troops and cargo at Madras towards the end of the month. In the beginning of November she left Madras roads, but encountered a sudden squall that almost put her on her beam ends. Contrary winds prevented her from immediately reaching Diamond Harbour. She arrived there on 16 November. On 15 December, she was at Saugor. Phoenix started to take cargo on in the middle of December and on the 25th she reached Cox's Island where she took on the last of her cargo. On 8 January 1792 she sailed for Madras, which she reached eight days later. There she took on 150 passengers and invalid soldiers. On 20 January she sailed for Britain. Adverse winds made it difficult to pass the Cape of Good Hope, but Phoenix arrived at St Helena on 5 April. She stayed there for 12 days to take in water and fresh provisions, leaving on 16 April. On 2 June she arrived at the Downs, where she landed some her passengers, and on 7 June moored in Long Reach. Fourth voyage (1794-95) For her fourth voyage, this to Madras, Phoenix was under the command of Captain Wemys Orrok (or Wemyss Orrok). This voyage took place after the commencement of the French Revolutionary Wars, so the Company arranged for Phoenix to sail under a letter of marque. This was dated 14 November 1793, and still gave her captain's name as Alexander Gray. The British government held Phoenix at Portsmouth, together with a number of other Indiamen in anticipation of using them as transports for an attack on Île de France (Mauritus). It gave up the plan and released the vessels in May 1794. It paid £1,500 9d for having delayed her departure by 72 days. Phoenix sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May and reached Madras on 3 September. She was back at St Helena on 7 January 1795 and the Downs on 23 July. West Indies Expedition (1795-96) The Admiralty chartered Phoenix as a troopship for Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christian's expedition to the West Indies. She sailed for the West Indies on 9 December, but bad weather delayed the start of the expedition and the vessels had to put back to England.Lloyd's List №2790. After numerous false starts aborted by weather issues, the fleet sailed on 26 April to invade St Lucia, with troops under Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby. St Lucia surrendered to the British on 25 May. The British went on to capture Saint Vincent and Grenada. Fifth Voyage (1796-99) Orrok was again captain of Phoenix, sailing her to Bengal, Penang and Madras. She left Portsmouth on 11 August 1796, arriving at the Cape on 18 November. By 4 March 1797 she was at Kedgeree, and one month later at Diamond Harbour. On 9 August she reached Saugor, from which she sailed to Penang, which she reached on 24 August. On 12 October she returned to Penang, and on 11 December she was at Madras. She reached Kedgeree on 25 January 1798. The reason for the to-and-fro was that the British government mounted an expedition against Manila in 1797-8. (One of the Royal Navy vessels involved appears to have been HMS Sybille.) The EIC held several vessels in India to support the expedition. There were eight regular ships: Lord Camden, Busbridge, Minerva, Lord Macartney, Lord Hawkesbury, Sir Stephen Lushington, Phoenix, and General Goddard. There were also three \\"dismantled ships\\": Pitt, Lascalles, and Royal Admiral. The owners claimed demurrage; for Phoenix, the amount they claimed was £6,083 6s 8d for 292 days.Asiatic Annual Register for the Year 1805 (1807), p.53. The captains of all the vessels sued the EIC for reimbursement for expenses consequent on the delay to their homeward bound journeys, and for the eight regular ships, the additional risks involved in the detours to Penang. In 1800 the court awarded six of the captains of the regular ships, Orrock among them, £750 each. The court further ordered that the officers of the vessels involved receive some payment. Phoenixs officers received £250 in all. The chief mate received £64 2s 1d, the purser £25 12s 10d, and the other officers intermediate amounts.The Asiatic annual register or a view of the history of Hindustan and of the politics, commerce and literature of Asia, Volume 7 (1805), pp.53-60. For the return leg to Britain, Phoenix passed Saugor on 5 April. She was at the Cape on 14 September and St Helena on 3 November. She arrived at The Downs on 3 February 1799. Sixth voyage (1800-02) For her last voyage Phoenix was under the command of Captain William Moffat, who sailed her for Bengal, Bombay and Mokha.Captain William Moffat may have been the nephew of William Moffat (MP), who may have been the owner. During the voyage, Captain William Moffat commissioned a memorial to his father, James, who had died in Calcutta in 1788. William Moffat MP's father was John (1676-1742). Phoenix left Torbay on 27 May 1800 and reached the Cape on 6 September. On 10 November Phoenix captured the French privateer Malartic (or General Malartic, or General Malrtique), which was under the command of Jean-Marie Dutertre, and which had attempted to take her, in the Bay of Bengal. The capture took place at , which is about 200 km SSW of Cox's Bazar. General Malartic was armed with 14 guns, two of them 42-pounder carronades, and had a crew of 120 men. She was five months out of Mauritius. Moffat took General Malartic with him to Bengal.Lloyd's List, no.4146, - accessed 5 December 2014. Capturing General Malartic earned Moffat the public award of an honour sword. The privateer had captured several East Indiamen, including Raymond, Woodcot, and Princess Royal, all of the same size as Phoenix.Chatterton (2008), p.112. Fifteen days after capturing Malartic Phoenix reached Kedgeree, and on 7 December she arrived at Diamond Harbour. She was at Saugor on 9 January 1801. Outward bound, she left off her pilot at the mouth of the Hooghly River on 14 January. On board she carried Major- General Sir David Baird, who was going to Trincomalee to take a faster ship to Bombay. There he would take command of the Indian army that was going to Egypt to help General Ralph Abercromby expel the French there. Phoenix reached Trincomalee on 25 February and Colombo on 5 March. From there she sailed to Bombay, which she reached on 2 April, arriving two days after Baird. She was apparently carrying troops for Baird's expedition to the Red Sea.Baird (1832), Vol. 1, pp.276, 278-80, & 288. By 3 August, Phoenix was at Aden, and three weeks later at Mokha. Moffat took the opportunity to chart the mouth of the Red Sea; a copy of his chart is now in the Library of Congress.Library of Congress (1909), Vol. 1, p.356, fn.53. Baird landed at Kosseir, on the Egyptian side of the Red Sea. He then led his troops army across the desert to Kena on the Nile, and then to Cairo. He arrived before Alexandria in time for the final operations.Chisolm (1911). Phoenix returned to Bombay by 17 October. She left Bombay on 15 November bound for Anjengo and Mahé. She was in company with several other Indiamen: Fort William, Worcester, , Lord Hawkesbury, and .Lloyd's List, no.4242,. Phoenix reached Tellicherry on 23 November. By 4 January 1802 Phoenix was at Anjengo. She reached St Helena by 5 April and Gravesend by 11 June. Fate In 1803 her owners sent her out to India for the local coastal trade. There is currently no easily accessible record of her subsequent fate. (In 1803 there was a Phoenix, L.B.Mawell, master, registered at Madras.East-India register and directory (1803), p.213.) It is possible that the French privateer (Captain Henri), captured Phoenix on 13 November 1805. In 1805 a new made her first voyage for the EIC.

The school specialises in technology, and the current Headteacher is Sue Wood. The school shares a site with the community special school Marjorie McClure. The site is on land between Chislehurst Common and the National Trust's Hawkwood Estate, an area of working farmland and woodland, and is above the Chislehurst Caves. As of 2013 the school had some 1,357 students, of whom approximately 200 were in the sixth form. The school was inspected by Ofsted in 2009 and rated good with outstanding capacity for sustained improvement.  History  The school was first established in 1939 as the Sidcup Day Commercial School, with headmistress Miss Scorrer. After World War II, in 1946, a second site linked to the Sidcup school was established at Hawkwood Lane, Chislehurst. The new school eventually became known as the Chislehurst and Sidcup Technical High School for Girls and in 1949 Mary Anderson was appointed head teacher. By 1969 the Chislehurst site had been further developed, with several new buildings, and two schools split. The Chislehurst school became Coopers School, named after the Coopers Mansion House which stood on the site. The house is still standing, and has recently been refurbished to become the school's sixth form centre. In 1969 later the school accepted its first intake of 37 boys. In 1981 the school became an all-ability comprehensive school. The school became a specialist Technology College in 2002, and was renamed Coopers Technology College. In February 2012 the school converted to an academy. It subsequently renamed itself Coopers School. Achievements The school won a national award for ICT in 2006, for using computers to improve the way in which it is run.

Personal life Dorothy Lucie McClemans was born in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, on 4 May 1907, the second of five daughters. Her father, William McClemans, was an Irish minister of the Church of England. Her mother, Ada Lucy Walker, was from New Zealand.Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol 18 (2012) After her parents divorced in 1928, her mother supported the family as a nurse and then as a Justice of the Peace. A qualified teacher from Perth College (1928), Dorothy taught in state schools in Western Australia until 1936. She continued teaching later in London while her husband, Colsell Sanders, a fellow school teacher whom she married in 1936, completed his doctorate in education. They returned to Perth, Australia in 1938. During her life, Dorothy was a member of the State Library Board of Western Australia, the State Advisory Board to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and the Children's Court. Her eldest son, Jon Sanders, was a well-known yachtsman who set a record in a non-stop solo triple circumnavigation of the globe. It was during this voyage that both of his parents died. Colsell Sanders died in 1986 and Dorothy Sanders died at Menora on 17 December 1987. Writing career She began writing in 1945, producing articles, poetry, short stories, and later novels. In 1948 her first novel, Fairies on the Doorstep, was published. During her writing career, she published as Lucy Walker, Shelley Dean, and Dorothy Lucie Sanders. The London Daily Mirror named her \\"Australia's Queen of Romance\\". During the 1970s, several of her romance novels were serialized in Women's Weekly, bowlderized to meet the restrictive editorial requirements of the magazine. As Lucy Walker, she wrote about 39 romance booksLucy Walker Bibliography over a thirty-year career. Popular in the United States and England, more than a million copies of her books were sold. Walker's romance novels were distinguished by their Outback settings. Walker was an active member of the Australian Society of Authors and Fellowship of Australian Authors, and a member of the Society of Women Writers and Journalists, London. In Germaine Greer's The Female Eunuch, Walker's romance novel The Loving Heart is used to illustrate that the traits of romance novel heroes \\"have been invented by women cherishing the chains of their bondage.\\" Greer claimed the novel expressed a foot fetish and criticized the \\"infantile\\" heroine. In an interview, Walker expressed her regret that the popularity of her romance novels detracted from her other novels and kept her from pursuing more serious writing. She said, \\"I am not unproud of Lucy Walker but I'll never really be sure of what I could have done without her...I used to think that if I had been given the chance I could have written The Great Australian Novel.\\" Bibliography Novels are listed by name of author and chronologically.

Her body was transferred to the Causten family vault, directly to the west of the Public Vault, for another six years before the funds were raised. She was briefly joined in May 1852 in the Causten vault by First Lady Louisa Catherine Adams, though it has been reported that Adams was interred in the Public Vault.Johnson and Johnson, p. 139, unequivocally states that Louisa Adams was interred in the Causten family vault the day after her death. Senator John C. Calhoun was interred in the Public Vault following a formal funeral and grand procession from the Capitol on April 2, 1850. He was encased in an early version of the Fisk metallic coffin which slowed down decomposition. On April 22 his remains departed the vault for a trip by steam ship to Charleston, South Carolina.Johnson and Johnson, p. 76. While the development of transportation and mortuary technology increased the use of the vault, it also limited its use as well. For example, following Henry Clay's death in 1852, his remains were also encased in a Fisk metallic coffin and transported to his home state by railroad without an interval at the Public Vault. On February 29, 1844, following an explosion on the USS Princeton, Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur, Secretary of the Navy Thomas Walker Gilmer, Commodore Beverly Kennon, and President John Tyler's prospective father-in-law, David Gardiner, were temporarily interred at the vault.Association for the Preservation of the Historic Congressional Cemetery Several grand public or state funeral processions ended in front of the Public Vault, after starting at the White House or the Capitol and then moving down Pennsylvania Avenue and E Street SE to the cemetery. These included the funerals for Presidents Harrison, J. Q. Adams, and Taylor; Senator Calhoun; First Ladies Dolley Madison and Louisa Adams; the victims of the USS Princeton disaster; and several other congressmen.Johnson and Johnson, Chapter 2, \\"The Grand Procession to the National Burial Ground.\\"President William Henry Harrison , reprinted from The National Intelligencer by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed April 17, 2013.President John Quincy Adams includes reprints from 1848 editions of the National Intelligencer, Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed April 17, 2013.President Zachary Taylor includes reprints from 1850 editions of the National Intelligencer, Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed April 17, 2013. Some of these processions were two miles long, led by military bands and troops for the funerals of military men, members of both houses of congress and the administration, and pall bearers carefully chosen for political balance to symbolize unity and stability in government. John Quincy Adams rode in a carriage in the funeral procession for President Harrison and wrote in his diary, \\"the corpse was deposited in the receiving vault - with some difficulty from the excessive crowd, but not the slightest disorder.Diary entry for April 7, 1841, quoted by Johnson and Johnson, p. 58.

Legend says that Lewis Powell spent a night in the vault while avoiding pursuit for his role in the assassination of President Lincoln. While the Public Vault was an important, if semi-official, national memorial during its first few decades, it was used less and less during the second half of the nineteenth century and during much of the twentieth century was unused.Johnson and Johnson, p. 67. During the twentieth century, it became unclear whether the U.S. Government or Christ Church owned the Public Vault and several dozen burial lots. In 1953 a Congressional report suggested that the government clear the record by selling the otherwise unnamed \\"receiving vault\\" and the burial lots to the church for $100.Johnson and Johnson, p. 271. As late as 2003 the vault was \\"empty and decaying.\\" It has since been restored with funds provided by the federal government.Johnson and Johnson, pp. 346–347.

Waveguide slotted line Slotted lines are used for microwave measurements and consist of a movable probe inserted into a slot in a transmission line. They are used in conjunction with a microwave power source and usually, in keeping with their low-cost application, a low cost Schottky diode detector and VSWR meter rather than an expensive microwave power meter. Slotted lines can measure standing waves, wavelength, and, with some calculation or plotting on Smith charts, a number of other parameters including reflection coefficient and electrical impedance. A precision variable attenuator is often incorporated in the test setup to improve accuracy. This is used to make level measurements, while the detector and VSWR meter are retained only to mark a reference point for the attenuator to be set to, thus eliminating entirely the detector and meter measurement errors. The parameter most commonly measured by a slotted line is SWR. This serves as a measure of the accuracy of the impedance match to the item under test. This is especially important for transmitting antennas and their feed lines; high standing wave ratio on a radio or TV antenna can distort the signal, increase transmission line loss and potentially damage components in the transmission path, possibly even the transmitter. Slotted lines are no longer widely used, but can still be found in budget applications. Their main drawback is that they are labour-intensive to use and require calculation, tables, or plotting to make use of the results. They need to be made with mechanical precision and the probe and its detector need to be adjusted with care, but they can give very accurate results. Description The slotted line is one of the basic instruments used in radio frequency test and measurement at microwave frequencies. It consists of a precision transmission line, usually co-axial but waveguide implementations are also used, with a movable insulated probe inserted into a longitudinal slot cut into the line. In a co-axial slotted line, the slot is cut into the outer conductor of the line. The probe is inserted past the outer conductor, but not so far that it touches the inner conductor. In a rectangular waveguide, the slot is usually cut along the centre of the broad wall of the waveguide. Circular waveguide slotted lines are also possible.Multiple sources: Slotted lines are relatively cheapThomas H. Lee even describes a microstrip slotted line for use up to that he claims can be made for less than $10. He calls this a \\" cost reduction\\" over the price of a network analyser. That is, its cost is 10,000 times less than an analyser costing $100,000 (Lee, pages xv, 268-271). and can perform many of the measurements done by more expensive equipment such as network analysers. However, slotted line measurement techniques are more labour-intensive and often do not directly output the desired parameter; some calculation or plotting is frequently required. In particular, they can only carry out a measurement at one spot frequency at a time so producing a plot of a parameter versus frequency is very time consuming. This is to be compared to modern instruments like network and spectrum analysers which are intrinsically frequency swept and produce a plot instantly. Slotted lines have now largely been superseded, but are still found where capital costs are an issue. Their remaining uses are mostly in the millimetre band, where modern test apparatus is either prohibitively expensive or not available at all, and with academic laboratories and hobbyists. They are also useful as a teaching aid as the user is more directly exposed to basic line phenomena than with more sophisticated instruments.Multiple sources: Operation The slotted line works by sampling the electric field inside the transmission line with the probe. For accuracy, it is important that the probe disturbs the field as little as possible. For this reason the probe diameter and slot width are kept small (usually around ) and the probe is inserted in no further than necessary. It is also necessary in waveguide slotted lines to place the slot at a position where the current in the waveguide walls is parallel to the slot. The current will then not be disturbed by the presence of the slot as long as it is not too wide. For the dominant mode this is on the centre-line of the broad face of the waveguide, but for some other modes it may need to be off-centre. This is not an issue for the co-axial line because this operates in the TEM (transverse electromagnetic) mode and hence the current is everywhere parallel to the slot. The slot may be tapered at its ends to avoid discontinuities causing reflections.Multiple sources: The disturbance to the field inside the line caused by the insertion of the probe is minimised as far as possible. There are two parts to this disturbance. The first part is due to the power the probe has extracted from the line and manifests as a lumped equivalent circuit of a resistor. This is minimised by limiting the distance the probe is inserted into the line so that only enough power is extracted for the detector to operate effectively. The second part of the disturbance is due to energy stored in the field around the probe and manifests as a lumped equivalent of a capacitor. This capacitance can be cancelled out with an inductance of equal and opposite impedance. Lumped inductors are not practical at microwave frequencies; instead, an adjustable stub with an inductive equivalent circuit is used to \\"tune out\\" the probe capacitance. The result is an equivalent circuit of a high impedance in shunt across the line which has little effect on the transmitted power in the line. The probe is more sensitive as a result of this tuning and the distance it is inserted can be further limited as a result.Voltmer, page 148 Test setup Figure 2. A test setup using a waveguide slotted line Figure 3. Co-axial slotted line A typical test setup with a waveguide slotted line is shown in figure 2. Referring to this figure, power from a test equipment source (not shown) enters the apparatus through the co-axial cable on the left and is converted to waveguide format by means of a launcher (1). This is followed by a section of waveguide (2) providing a transition to a smaller size of guide. An important component in the setup is the isolator (3) which prevents power being reflected back into the source. Depending on the test conditions, such reflections can be large and a high- power source may be damaged by the returning wave. The power entering the slotted line is controlled by a rotary variable attenuator (4). This is followed by the slotted line itself (5) above which is the probe mounted on a movable carriage. The carriage also carries the probe adjustments: (6) is the probe depth adjustment, (7) is a length of co-axial section with tuning adjustments, and (8) is a detector, which uses either a point contact crystal rectifier or a Schottky barrier diode.H. C. Torrey, C. A. Whitmer, Crystal Rectifiers, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1948 The right-hand end of the slotted line is terminated in a matched load (9) which absorbs all the power exiting the end of the waveguide. The load can be replaced by the component or system that it is desired to test. It can also be replaced with a reference short-circuit (10) which is used to calibrate the slotted line. The carriage can be moved along the slotted line by means of a rotary knob (11) which simultaneously moves a vernier gauge (12) for accurate measurement of the probes position along the line.Das & Das, pages 496–498 The probe is connected to a detector and a display meter (not shown in figure 2). These can be, respectively, a thermistor and power meter, or an envelope detector and VSWR meter. The detector can be a crystal detector or a Schottky barrier diode. The detector is mounted on the probe assembly, usually a distance λ/4λ, the customary symbol for wavelength. It is usually most convenient to give distances on transmission lines in terms of wavelengths of the transmitted wave, or sometimes, when the distance involved is small or not an exact multiple of a quarter wavelength, in radians where θ=2πλ radians. from the probe tip as shown in figure 3. This is because the detector looks almost like a short circuit to the transmission line, and this distance will convert it to an open circuit through the quarter-wave impedance transformer effect. Thus, the detector has minimal effect on loading the line. The probe tuning stub can be seen on figure 3 branching from the line linking the probe to the detector. Figure 2 has a slightly different arrangement; the main probe into the waveguide leads to a vertical co-axial tuning and adjustment section but the detector is on a horizontal side-section with a secondary probe into the upright co-axial section.Das & Das, pages 496–497 Measurements Measurements of microwave power can be made directly, usually with a thermistor based detector and meter. However, these instruments are expensive and a common meter used in measurements with a slotted line is instead a cheaper low-frequency VSWR meter. The microwave power source is amplitude modulated with, typically, a signal which is recovered by the envelope detector in the probe and sent to the VSWR meter. This scheme is preferred to simply detecting the unmodulated carrier directly, which would result in a DC output, because a stable, narrowband, tuned amplifier can be used to amplify the signal. A large amplification is required in the VSWR meter because the limit of the square law rangesquare law, of a detector diode, the range over which the demodulated output voltage is proportional to the square of the carrier voltage on the line. of the detector diode is no more than .Multiple sources: Maxima and minima Figure 4. Standing wave patterns on a line for various reflection coefficients showing maxima and minima When the slotted line is terminated with a precision matching load there is no variation in the detected power along the line, other than a very small decrease due to losses in the line. However, when this is replaced by a device under test (DUT) which is not perfectly matched to the line there will be a reflection back towards the source. This causes a standing wave to be set up on the line with periodic maxima and minima (collectively, extrema) due to alternating constructive and destructive interference. These extrema are found by moving the probe back and forth along the line and the level at that point can then be measured on the meter.Gupta, pages 113–114 The extrema are not of any great interest in themselves, but are used in the calculation of several more useful parameters. Some of these parameters require the measurement of the exact position of the extremum. Either maxima or minima can equally be used, from a mathematical point of view, but minima are preferred because they are always much sharper than maxima, especially for large reflections, as shown in figure 4. Additionally, the probe causes less disturbance to the field near a minimum than it does near a maximum.Voltmer, pages 147–148 Wavelength Wavelength is determined by measuring the distance between two adjacent minima. This distance will be λ/2. There is no need for a DUT, better results are obtained with the reference short in position.Multiple sources: Standing wave ratio Standing wave ratio (SWR or VSWR) is a basic parameter and the one most commonly measured on a slotted line. This quantity is of particular importance for transmitter antennae. A high SWR indicates a poor match between the feed line and the antenna, which increases wasted power, can cause damage to components in the transmission path, possibly including the transmitter, and cause distortion to TV, FM stereo and digital signals. With the input power set so that the maxima are at 0 dBm, a measurement of a minimum in decibels will directly give SWR (after discarding the minus sign).Gupta, pages 112–113 Reflection coefficient The reflection coefficient, ρ, is the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident wave. In general it is a complex number. The magnitude of the reflection coefficient can be calculated from the VSWR measurement by, :  \\\\rho  = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{VSWR}-1}{\\\\mathrm{VSWR}+1} where VSWR is the standing wave ratio expressed as a voltage ratio (not in decibels). However, to completely characterise the reflection coefficient, the phase of ρ must also be found. This is done on a slotted line by measuring the distance of the first minimum from the DUT. Moving the probe right up to the DUT is not practicable so a different approach is usually adopted. The position of the first minimum when the reference short is in place is noted. The distance back along the line from this reference point to the next minimum when the DUT is in place will be the same as the distance from the DUT to the first minimum. This is so because the reference short guarantees a minimum at the DUT position.Multiple sources: The phase part of ρ is given by, :\\\\angle \\\\rho = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda} x - \\\\pi where λ is the wavelength and x is the distance to the first minimum as described earlier. The magnitude and phase representation of ρ can, if required, be expressed as real and imaginary parts instead by the usual manipulation of complex numbers.Multiple sources: Impedance The impedance, Z, of the DUT can be calculated from the reflection coefficient by, :Z = Z_0 \\\\frac {1 + \\\\rho}{1 - \\\\rho} where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the line. An alternative method is to plot the VSWR and distance to the node (in wavelengths) on a Smith chart. These quantities are directly measured by the slotted line. From this plot the DUT impedance (normalised to Z0) can be read directly off the Smith chart.Multiple sources: Accuracy considerations Good slotted lines are precision made instruments. They need to be because mechanical defects can affect accuracy. Some of the mechanical issues that are relevant to this include backlash of the vernier, concentricity of the inner and outer conductor, circularity of the outer conductor, centrality and straightness of the inner conductor, variations in cross-section, and the ability of the carriage to maintain a constant probe depth. Issues with probe tuning and disturbances to the field have already been discussed, but the insulated spacers holding the centre conductor in place can also disturb the field. Consequently, these are made as discrete as is compatible with mechanical strength. However, the greatest source of inaccuracy is usually not the slotted line itself, but the characteristics of the detector diode.Lee, pages 251–252 The detected voltage signal output of the Schottky barrier diodes typically used in microwave detectors have a square law relationship to the power being measured and meters are calibrated accordingly. However, as the power increases, the diode deviates significantly from a square law and remains accurate up to an output voltage of only around . This can be improved a little by adding a load resistor to the detector output, but this also has the undesirable effect of decreasing sensitivity. Another technique is to reduce the range of power being measured (so that it is brought within the square law range of the detector) by measuring at a point other than a maximum. The maximum is then calculated from the known mathematical shape of the standing wave pattern. This has the objection that it adds significantly to the labour required to make the measurements, as does the technique of precisely calibrating the detector and adjusting the readings on the meter according to a calibration chart.Lee, pages 252–254 It is possible to completely eliminate errors in the detector and meter if a precision variable attenuator is used in the test setup. In this technique a minimum is first found and the attenuator adjusted so that the meter is indicating precisely some convenient mark. A maximum is then found and the attenuation increased until the meter is indicating the same mark. The amount the attenuation had to be increased is the VSWR of the standing wave. Accuracy here depends on the accuracy of the attenuator and not at all on the detector.Lee, page 253 Notes References Bibliography *Connor, F.

New water services management The movement proposes a new type of water services management that is neither state-run nor private, but rather operates on the principles of cooperativism and conceives water as a commons. At the heart of the Initiative's plan is the creation of local water cooperatives in all of the metropolitan area's municipalities and districts. The cooperatives will allow participation of water users in decision making regarding water tariffs and investment, under the principle of \\"one water meter equals one vote\\". Union of cooperatives The union of all the cooperatives will constitute a new company that, according to its statute, will have the goal of managing Thessaloniki's water services in a non-profit manner and ensure water quality, direct democratic control, social justice, access to water for all and protection of the environment. The union of cooperatives will participate in the public tender for the acquisition of EYATH announced by the Greek government for 2013.

So far only five β-porphyranases have been identified: PorA and PorB are found in the marine bacteria Zobellia galactinovirans. A wild-type porphyranase activity has been found in Pseudoalteromonas atlantica. BpGH16B and BpGH86A have been found in the human gut bactrium, Bacteroides plebeius, of Japanese individuals. Porphyran, the major water soluble polysaccharide of Porphyra has a linear structure composed of 4-linked α-l-galactopyranose-6-sulfate (L6S) residues and 3-linked β-d- galactopyranose (G) residues. Beta porphyranase (EC 3.2.1 178; 3= Hydrolase; 3.2= Glycosylase; 3.2.1 = Glycosidases (enzymes hydrolyzing O- and S- glycosyl compounds)) acts as a glycosidase to catalyze the following chemical reaction: : Hydrolysis of beta-D-galactopyranose-(1->4)-alpha-L- galactopyranose-6-sulfate linkages in porphyran The backbone of porphyran consists largely (~70%) of (1->3)-linked beta-D-galactopyranose followed by (1->4)-linked alpha-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate.  Gut microbiome  CAZymes are carbohydrate active enzymes that breakdown dietary polysaccharadies and supply the human body with energy. These are absent in the human genome, but gut microbes are able to perform this process. In Japanese individuals the human gut bacterium, Bacteroides plebius, has β-porphyranase via horizontal gene transfer. Seaweed is an important component of the diet of Japanese people and the enzyme works to break down nori, the seaweed used in sushi and typically eaten for nutrition purposes. This enzyme has not been found in individuals from the West, and likely won't ever be found in their microbiome, regardless of how much seaweed is incorporated into the diet. Not only has it been found that seaweed comprises less of the diet in Western cultures, the current treatment of food prevents the possibility of microbes being consumed. Traditionally, nori was not roasted so the associated microbes that led to horizontal gene transfer between the marine microbe on the Porphyra spp. and the gut bacterium would more easily enter the system However, now dietary seaweed is generally free of surface microbes.  Structure  The most work investigating crystalline structures have been done on PorA and PorB of Zobellia galactinovirans. The L6S unit at subsite −2 is surrounded by tryptophan and arginine residues in both PorA and PorB, which construct a positively charged hydrophobic pocket that allows for a bulky sulfate group to fit.

This project was conducted to test the ability of remote sensing to detect flooding stress in mangroves during flooding for mosquito control. Mosquito control in the Cocoa Beach area was initially provided by application of various pesticides, including DDT. Cocoa Beach was the site of initial field tests for DDT, and one of the first locations where resistance was noted. This led to use of source reduction in addition to pesticides. Source reduction is a mechanical modification of habitat to decrease mosquito production. The saltmarsh mosquito will not lay its eggs in standing water, preferring seasonally-flooded sand or mud instead. The concept behind source reduction is to convert seasonally-flooded marsh to either upland or submerged land. Source reduction began to be used in the late 1950s in Cocoa Beach. In this beginning phase small ditches were dug through the islands to allow water movement and fish access to inner areas of the succulent marsh. This approach had limited success. During the late 1960s Brevard County Mosquito Control began dredging the Thousand Islands south of Minutemen Causeway to eliminate ephemeral ponds necessary for saltmarsh mosquito breeding. This destruction of wetlands set the stage for an approach that would retain wetlands but still reduce the production of saltmarsh mosquitoes. This approach is known as impoundment, in which an area of salt marsh is surrounded by a dike with a means to flood and empty the marsh, generally by pump.  Construction  Construction plan for C-34 Impoundment. Construction plans called for completion of a perimeter dike around the subject section of islands, with the dike carried inside of a shell midden to avoid flooding tropical vegetation found there. A pump house allowed flooding of the impoundment during the summer rainy season when mosquito breeding is most intense. Flapper valve gates at the north and south ends of the impoundment were installed to allow closure during flooding and opening during the dry season to allow water exchange with the lagoon. Perimeter dike of C-34 impoundment. A test cell was constructed so as to be flooded separately from the main impoundment. This area was to be flooded sufficiently to inundate black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) pneumatophores, in hopes that stress could be detected by false infrared aerial photography. Several flights were flown but stress could not be detected by remote sensing before it was evident on the ground. This is thought to have been due to the propensity for black mangroves to drop their leaves all at once rather than slowly enough for color changes to be picked up in the photographs. Remains of C-34 impoundment pump house. Active management of the impoundment ended in the early 1980s. Notes This area is also known as Gumbo Limbo Island and \\"The Ring\\" by locals.

The album was written by Private Eye writer and satirist John Wells. It was a precursor to his later work lampooning Thatcher in the Dear Bill series of letters that appeared in Private Eye (and in book form) and the 1981 stage farce, Anyone for Denis? The album was produced by John Lloyd whose credits include the comedy television programmes Not the Nine O'Clock News, Spitting Image, Blackadder, and QI - and Martin Lewis the co-creator and producer of the Secret Policeman's Ball series. For Lloyd, like Wells, working on the Thatcher album was a preparation for his future work spoofing Thatcher. In 1984 he created and produced the BAFTA Award-winning satirical puppet show Spitting Image that aired on the ITV network from 1984 to 1996 - in which Margaret Thatcher was the most notable protagonist. The album starred noted Thatcher impressionist Janet Brown, in the role of Margaret Thatcher, with other roles (both male and female) portrayed by John Wells.http://www.themediabriefing.com/people/janet-brown The album was released in the UK by Logo Records in October 1979, just five months after Thatcher became Prime Minister. Brown promoted the album appearing as Thatcher singing the album's theme song Iron Lady on the BBC TV programme Top of the Pops on 25 October 1979, Brown also made a surprise appearance dressed up as Thatcher at that year's Labour Party Conference in Brighton as a publicity stunt to launch the album and was photographed with surprised politicians Tony Benn and Barbara Castle who both initially believed that Brown was actually their nemesis Thatcher.Brown, Janet. Prime Mimickery Robson Books, 1986, The album was deleted in the early 1980s and was unavailable until it was reissued digitally in 2013 immediately following Thatcher's death. In interviews in major national newspapers published shortly after Thatcher died, the album's co-producer, Martin Lewis disclosed that the album had not sold well on its initial release, which he attributed to the fact that just four months after her election as Prime Minister, Thatcher was \\"still in her honeymoon period\\". In the interviews Lewis recounted an encounter he had with Thatcher at a reception in her honor at the home of the British Consul-General in Los Angeles in November 1991 - just one year after her resignation as Prime Minister. On learning that Lewis had produced the infamous album that had satirized her early in her premiership, Thatcher enquired how the album had sold. Lewis informed her that the sales had been poor because of her then high popularity. In response Thatcher quipped \\"You should reissue it! I think it'll find a much bigger audience now.\\" In April 2013, the album was reissued by Lewis' Springtime! Records label and made available digitally. Two singles of songs from the album were also issued, The Iron Lady (the album's title song) and I'm There! (described as \\"an orgasmic dance track\\"). A website, Facebook page, and a Twitter feed, were also launched. Asked about the timing of the reissue, Lewis stated: \\"After her passing, I thought carefully about all the contributions that Margaret Thatcher had made to Britain and the world during her decades in politics. And I thought that I should honor those contributions by following her advice. So I am reissuing the album. She asked for it, and I certainly think she deserves it.\\" See also Cultural depictions of Margaret Thatcher References Category:1979 albums Category:Comedy albums by British artists Category:Concept albums Category:Cultural depictions of Margaret Thatcher Category:Works about Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom Category:Logo Records albums ","title":"The Iron Lady (album)"},{"id":"39104115","text":"UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine 2-epimerase (hydrolysing) (, UDP-Bac2Ac4Ac 2-epimerase, NeuC) is an enzyme with systematic name UDP-N,N'-diacetylbacillosamine hydrolase (2-epimerising).

The current Supreme Guard commander is General Yun Jong-rin. Naming North Korea's ruling family are claimed to be superstitious and so the Command's designation number is in reference to the numerological construct \\"9 and 6+3=9\\" (double nine), whereas the number \\"9\\" is considered lucky. History According to official history, the Command participated in the Korean War (known in North Korea as the \\"Fatherland Liberation War\\"). The unit has also produced 72 \\"heroes of labor\\" and 28 \\"heroes of the Republic\\". The first incarnation of the Command was created in 1946. Between 1970-mid 1990s the Command was part of the State Security Department. However, to deal with several coup attempts, Kim Jong-il reorganized the Guard by dismissing dozens of officers and expanding his own private bodyguard unit by 200 men and named it the \\"2.16 Unit\\". On April 27, 2018, the SGC was deployed to protect Kim Jong-Un during his visit to Panmunjon.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43920740 Organization The Command falls under the Korean People's Army Ground Force and is divided into approximately six departments, three combat brigades, several bodyguard divisions, and one construction battalion. The unit is composed of 95,000-120,000 personnel. Bodyguard divisions are divided into at least two sections, Section 1 was dedicated to the protection of Kim Il-sung and Section 2 protected Kim Jong-il. It is unknown if Kim Jong-un has a new dedicated section. The Command has camps located throughout the country, usually near official residences, and has a strong presence in Pyongyang. The Command also monitors key military and party figures to ensure the safety of the Kim family. It also coordinates with the Pyongyang Defense Command (with its 70,000 men) and III Corps (North Korea) for the defense of the capital and other strategic locations. These other military units provide an additional 95,000-100,000 soldiers, plus artillery and armored vehicles, for the defense of the country's leadership. Recruitment and training According to the testimonies of North Korean defector Lee Young-kuk, recruiters for the Guard look for new recruits in high schools where students are lined up for inspection. Physical prerequisites include, no facial scars and a well- proportioned body. Potential candidates have their family histories scrutinized for party loyalty and good \\"songbun\\". Once chosen, they are given an ID number while all other records are erased; contact with family is forbidden. Only one member per family is allowed to serve as a bodyguard. Recruits are then taken to special training camps for six months and are trained for a total of two years. Training includes, Taekwondo classes, marksmanship, 25 km marches in full gear and special operations tactics. According to defector Oh Young-nam, a former member of the State Security Department, the Supreme Guard Command published a 300-page training book detailing previous security incidents.

The final named storm of the 2002–03 South- West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Manou formed on May 2 to the southwest of Diego Garcia. It moved generally to the southwest for much of its duration, steered by a ridge to the southeast. Manou affected Saint Brandon and Mauritius with gusty winds. After an initial strengthening phase, the storm weakened but later re-intensified as it approached Madagascar. Manou developed a well-defined eye and reached peak winds only 19 km (12 mi) from the eastern Madagascar coastline. For about 12 hours, the cyclone stalled before turning to the south and weakening. Manou became extratropical on May 10 and dissipated three days later. Damage in Madagascar was heaviest near Vatomandry, where 85% of buildings were destroyed and 23 people were killed. Manou destroyed about 24,500 houses nationwide, leaving 114,480 people homeless. The storm destroyed large areas of crops and disrupted transportation, including damaging the road between Vatomandry and Brickaville. Manou injured 85 and killed 89 people throughout Madagascar. Meteorological history In late April, an area of convection persisted southwest of Diego Garcia in the southern Indian Ocean. The system had a low- level circulation and pulsating thunderstorm activity. Located in an area of weak to moderate wind shear, the convection gradually organized while developing outflow. On May 2, a secondary area of convection, also with an accompanying circulation, formed to the northwest, and also showed signs of development. That day, the original disturbance organized enough for Météo- France (MFR) to designate it Tropical Disturbance 16 at 1200 UTC. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued tropical cyclone formation alerts for both systems within a 14‑hour period, and upgraded the original system to Tropical Cyclone 18S on May 3 about 980 km (610 mi) northeast of Mauritius. Due to the disturbance to the northwest, as well as a building ridge to the northeast, the system continued to the southwest. On May 4, MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression and later Tropical Storm Manou. According to the JTWC, the storm quickly reached 1-minute sustained winds of 85 km/h (50 mph). The secondary disturbance to the west weakened while approaching the storm. Manou also weakened due to ongoing shear, and the windspeeds dropped as the circulation became exposed from the convection. On May 6, the storm re- intensified and the thunderstorms redeveloped while passing north of Mauritius and Réunion. On May 8 while approaching Madagascar, Manou developed an eye, and as a result, MFR upgraded it to tropical cyclone status, with 10-minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). The JTWC also upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. After becoming a tropical cyclone, Manou intensified further, although its forward motion slowed significantly. MFR estimated peak 10-minute winds of 155 km/h (95 mph) on May 8, and JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph), with gusts to 165 km/h (105 mph). This made Manou a rare May tropical cyclone in the basin; only four other storms that formed in the south-west Indian Ocean in May reached winds of over 140 km/h (85 mph) since satellite coverage began, most recently Cyclone Kesiny in the previous year. While maintaining its peak intensity and an eye 44 km (28 mi) in diameter, Manou reached a position only 19 km (12 mi) from the eastern Madagascar coastline. At that time, gale force winds extended over 150 km (90 mi) from the center, and MFR estimated a minimum barometric pressure of . For about 12 hours, Manou drifted off the eastern coast of Madagascar before turning to the south, moving around a ridge to its east. Land interaction and drier air weakened the eye, and on May 9 the cyclone weakened to tropical storm status. The next day Manou weakened to a tropical depression, and the JTWC issued its last advisory. MFR continued tracking the storm until it dissipated on May 13. Impact and aftermath Cyclone Manou approaching Madagascar Early in its duration, Manou passed just north of Saint Brandon. There, sustained winds reached 74 mph (46 mph), with gusts to 109 km/h (68 mph). On Mauritius, the storm produced gusty winds across much of the island, peaking at 107 km/h (67 mph). Before affecting Madagascar, officials in the country advised residents to evacuate to shelters, although the storm was not expected to be as severe as it was. When Manou stalled just offshore eastern Madagascar, it produced gusts as strong as 211 km/h (131 mph) in Vatomandry. The same city reported of rainfall in a 15‑hour period. Damage was heaviest in Vatomandry, where 85% of buildings were destroyed, although the broader region also experienced severe damage and was largely isolated from the rest of the country. In Vatomandry, Manou severely damaged the main hospital, several schools, and the prison. The storm disrupted power and water networks. Strong winds blowing salt spray destroyed the coffee and cloves crops, and rice crops were also damaged, after 80% of rice fields were flooded in Brickaville and Andevoranto. In those two towns, an official estimated that 95% of houses were wrecked. The road between Vatomandry and Brickaville was washed out or otherwise blocked by landslides, and the village of Ilaka was isolated after the storm wrecked a bridge. Throughout Madagascar, Manou injured 85 and killed 89 people, including 23 people in Vatomandry and 2 in Brickaville. About 24,500 houses were destroyed, leaving 114,480 people homeless. On May 12, Malagasy Prime Minister Jacques Sylla issued an appeal to the international community for assistance. Due to the damage from Manou, the French Red Cross activated its office in Réunion, providing one ton of medicine. The Malagasy Red Cross had pre-positioned emergency supplies earlier in the cyclone season, and after Manou struck, the agency distributed a water purification unit, medicine, and tents to the affected areas. Due to road damage, supplies had to be delivered by boat, which arrived in Vatomandry on May 13\\\\. The delivery included of supplies. Workers quickly made repairs to power systems. The Malagasy government provided $147,000 to restore health centers in Vatomandry and Andevoranto. Japan provided $80,000 worth of supplies, including tents and jerrycans. Japan, the United States, Norway, and Germany donated about $1.27 million to Madagascar for relief. The World Food Programme initially provided 90 tons of rice, although ongoing drought conditions and storms caused the agency to continue providing food to residents in southern Madagascar for several months.

The eponymous heroine of the poem was an impoverished Attic widow with whom Theseus stayed on his way to subdue the Marathonian Bull. On his return from accomplishing this feat, Theseus found that his hostess had died, and, in return for her humble hospitality, the hero founded a deme named for her and established there a sanctuary of Zeus Hecaleus in her honor. Although poorly preserved by papyrus fragments and quotations in ancient authors, the broad outline of the Hecale is relatively certain, and the text stands as an important witness to the poorly understood genre of the Hellenistic epyllion., .

He was previously Bishop of Albano and secretary to the group of cardinals named by Pope Francis to advise him. Biography Semeraro was born in Monteroni di Lecce, Province of Lecce, Italy. He was ordained to the priesthood on 8 September 1971. He received his Doctor of Theology degree in 1980 from the Pontifical Lateran University. On 25 July 1998 he was named Bishop of Oria. He was consecrated on 29 September 1998 by Archbishop Cosmo Francesco Ruppi with Archbishops Domenico Caliandro and Donato Negro as co- consecrators. He taught at the Pontifical Lateran University in 2001. Pope John Paul II chose him as Special Secretary of the 2001 Synod of Bishops, which considered the role of the bishops in contemporary society. That Synod's final statement pointed to social injustice as the root cause of terrorism and decried third world debt and \\"the enduring drama of hunger and extreme poverty\\". Semeraro commented: \\"There is a strong will to dismantle the image of bishops as men of power and to reinstitute the image of bishops as men of service.\\" On 1 October 2004 he was named Bishop of Albano. He is a Consultant to the Congregation for the Clergy and the Italian Episcopal Conference (IEC), and a member of the IEC Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith. On 4 May 2007 he was elected president of the administrative board of the IEC newspaper Avvenire, in place of Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco of Genoa, who had been elected president of the IEC. In June 2010, he became president of the IEC Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith. On 13 April 2013 Pope Francis appointed him secretary of the commission of cardinals appointed to advise him on the government of the Church and the organization of the Roman Curia. On 4 November 2013, Pope Francis appointed him Apostolic Administrator of the Exarchic Monastery and Territorial Abbey of Santa Maria di Grottaferrata. In a 2017 interview, Semeraro described the work of the Council of Cardinals: listening, reflecting, and verifying. The Council, he said, listens to the contributions of the Church; reflects on those contributions, and looks into the details of them, considering the best way of going forward. It then makes proposals to the Pope; as Semeraro explained, the Council has a consultative role.Interview with Council Secretary On 15 October 2020, Pope Francis appointed him Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.

Like its Arabic counterpart, its production diminished in the 12th century under the rule of the Almoravids and Almohads. In the last part of the 10th century, Dunash ben Labrat revolutionized Jewish poetry in Al-Andalus by bringing Arabic meter and monorhyme into Hebrew writing. Jewish poets employed Arabic poetic themes, writing bacchic poetry, garden poetry, and love poetry.  Literary language  As in the rest of the Arabic world at the time, Arabic was the typical language for Jewish writing, except for sacred religious texts and belles lettres. Practically all Jewish works about philosophy, theology, mathematics, were written in Arabic, typically in Hebrew characters. This type of writing has been called Judeo-Arabic, although there was little difference in the language used by Jews and non-Jews at this time. The choice of Hebrew as the poetic language can be seen as an expression of Jewish self-assertion. Contemporary Arabic poets considered their language, the language of the Qur'an, the most beautiful language, and Arabic verse as the highest form of poetry; Jewish poets thought similarly of their sacred writings and composed poetry in Biblical Hebrew Apart from Dunash's metrical innovations, the Hebrew of these poems tried to emulate the diction and style of Classical Hebrew, abolishing elements that had been introduced into the language after the canonization of the Hebrew Bible. This classical approach was facilitated by advances in the study of Hebrew grammar and biblical interpretation.  Hebrew liturgical poetry  The Tanakh contains several poetic sections, including the Song of the sea and the Song of Deborah, as well as poetic books such as the Book of Psalms and the Book of Job. The Talmud also includes a number of poetic sections. Piyyut had flourished in Byzantine Palestine between the fifth and seventh centuries. The incorporation of the complex and opaque poetry of the piyyutim required the recognition of an unusual vocabulary, foreign words, complex grammatical forms, and a great number of allusions to Jewish religious sources.  Caliphate of Córdoba  In the late 10th century, Dunash ben Labrat, a North African rabbi and student of Saadia Gaon, arrived at the Caliphate of Córdoba and revolutionized Hebrew poetry in al-Ándalus. Dunash designed a system of short and long vowels for Hebrew that allowed it to imitate Arabic meter, and adopted the structure of the qasida. Practically all Judeo-Spanish poets adopted Dunash's innovations. Moses ibn Ezra said that the best Hebrew poetry was composed according to the Arabic model, but Yehudah Halevi, a contemporary of ibn Ezra, felt ambivalent toward the metric innovations, condemning them as a cultural surrender.  Golden age of Judeo-Spanish poetry  Taifas in 1080. The division of the Caliphate of Córdoba into taifas produced a literary flourishing in al- Ándalus. The division of the caliphate into taifas, and the subsequent literary courts in various taifas, brought a golden age to Judeo-Spanish poetry. Notable poets of this period include Semuel ibn Nagrella (993-1056), Salomón ibn Gabirol (1021-1055), Moses ibn Ezra (1055-1138), Yehudah Halevi (1074-1141), Yishaq ibn Gayyat (1038-1089), and Abraham ibn Ezra (1092-1167). These poets were particularly influenced by Middle Eastern Arabic poets such as al-Mutanabbi and Abu Tammam, rather than by Andalusians poets. Many shared al-Mutanabbi's elitism toward a society that wasn't interested in their poetry. Love poetry, following the Arabic tradition, was inspired by the work of Abu Nuwas. Themes included beauty and longing, unrequited love, the pleasures of wine or naseeb, as well as the love obstacles of Hejazi poetry. A number of medieval Hebrew songs glorify the beauty of boys, particularly between the 11th and early 13th centuries. As with Arabic poetry, the production of Jewish poetry diminished under the reign of the Almoravids and the Almohadsfrom the 12th century onwards.  Meters and genres  The qasida was typical for major poetic genres. The madih praised and honored a great man, while the martiyya or ritza commemorated the death of a great man. The satirical hiya or hichá ridiculed enemies, although this form is much more prominent in Arabic poetry. Poets also adopted the Muwashshah, a strophic form typically devoted to issues related to the pleasures of life, descriptions of wine and its consumption, love or expressions of regret for the ephemeral nature of these pleasures. The Kharja, or final refrain of these muwashshahat typically switched from classical Arabic to colloquial Andalusian Arabic. In Hebrew poems, the change was between different languages—from Hebrew to Arabic or a Romance language like Judaeo-Spanish - a testament to the trilingual society Andalusian Jews lived in. As for themes, Jewish poetry, which had previously centered on the liturgical, became very similar to the Arabic tradition. By the tenth century, Arabic culture had developed a rich and varied poetic tradition. Jewish poets used the nostalgic tone of poetry of the Arabian Desert for poems about their own exile; imitated the Bacchic poems that described the pleasures of wine and sheltered gardens, and reflected on the lifestyle of a well-to-do class that shared values with their Muslim peers. They also shared an interest in Neo-Platonic concepts about the soul and other themes of Arabic love poetry, reformulated through the language of the Hebrew Bible (especially the Song of Songs), which penetrated both sacred and secular Hebrew poetry.

He is a co-founder and Managing Editor in Chief of Aignos, an independent, royalty publisher that seeks out experimental and innovative fiction and nonfiction. Marcantoni has written has published the novels Communion (with Jean Blasiar), and Traveler's Rest. His work is described as a mix of stream of consciousness, existentialism, surrealism, and ellipsism. Marcantoni blends film and theatrical techniques with his narratives, making the environmental and intellectual musings of his characters as essential to the story as the action and dialogue.  Early life  Marcantoni was born on June 6, 1984 in Collegeville, Pennsylvania. He is of Puerto Rican and Corsican descent. He spent much of his childhood in Puerto Rico. He was involved in theatre from an early age and acted in community and semi-professional productions. At age 18, Marcantoni played the character Louis Ironside in a production of Angels in America. He join Behind the Masque, a street performance group, which ended a year later when the founder and Marcantoni's mentor, Jaime Burcham, died in a drowning accident. At age 21, Marcantoni he decided to dedicate himself to writing and filmmaking and began studies in script writing at the Art Institute of Atlanta. While at the Institute, he make several short films with high school friend Todd Carnley. After three months, Marcantoni dropped out to pursue freelance film work in Atlanta. After failed attempts to publish any of his scripts, Marcantoni decided to return to school at the University of Tampa. While in school, Marcantoni produced the short film Discover Fresh Breath, a parody of breath mint commercials. This film won the TBS Very Funny Award at the Campus Movie Festival in 2007. Marcantoni also wrote the short story The Revolutionary, later to become a chapter in Traveler's Rest. The short story was published in the anthology The Shortcut: 20 Stories to Get You From Here to There in 2006. He also became a contributor and frequent guest on the local news program The Bleepin Truth, and wrote restaurant reviews for The Tampa Bay Sun. In 2009, Marcantoni graduated from the University of Tampa and found work as an editor with Savant Books and Publications, an independent publisher based in Honolulu.  Savant  At Savant, Marcantoni became close to author/playwright Jean Blasiar, working as her editor for the Poor Rich series. Blasiar asked Marcantoni collaborate with her on some television and play projects, leading to the scripts for the shows Mirage and Lily. Mirage would be optioned by Merrill Entertainment in 2012 and Lily would have a staged reading in Los Angeles in 2013. In October 2010, Blasiar began work on a WWII family drama. Jean asked Marcantoni to collaborate on the book, which centered on a little girl who uses her gift for communicating with animals to find her father, who has gone MIA on the battlefields of France. Marcantoni added a greater magic realist angle to the work, making it less fantastical, and increased the poeticism between the mother and father, making the book more of a love story than it was originally conceived. The result of their collaboration was Communion (2011). During his time at Savant, Marcantoni also became the editor for Zachary Oliver, whose doctoral thesis on multiple intelligence theory was turned into an education memoir entitled Falling but Fulfilled (2010). In the Spring of 2011, Marcantoni created the manuscript Dancing at the Border of the Abyss, which was later published as Traveler's Rest (2012). In 2012, Marcantoni and Oliver left Savant and created Aignos Publishing. After negotiations with Savant, Oliver and Marcantoni were allowed to continue the editing and oversee the release of Traveler's Rest, but the book was not a commercial success.  Aignos Publishing  Marcantoni was given permission from Oliver to develop the Aignos Editorial Department along his own lines, and he immediately proceeded to court authors and editors from both North and South America. He pushed for Aignos to be bilingual and focused on Hispanic works. He also sought out authors who were aggressively unconventional, playing with genre and style. In August 2012, Aignos released Paul Guzzo's book The Dark Side of Sunshine. The book depicted the history of corruption and injustice in Tampa. Guzzo's work attracted attention from the St. Petersburg Times, the Tampa Tribune, and Newsweek's The Daily Beast. The book was moderately successful and set the standard in which Aignos uses a combination of social media and personal appearances to promote its books. In 2013, Marcantoni hired Rebeca Gomez Galindo to take over the Editorial Department. This gave him time to manage the pre-release and post release marketing of the books and concentrate on his own writing.  YouNiversity Project  In 2014, together with author Chris Campanioni, Marcantoni created the YouNiversity, a digital internship that provides students access to and experience with the publishing industry through media professionals in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and Africa. Unlike the curriculum and objectives of many MFA programs across the United States, the YouNiversity focuses on several different facets of a writer's literary development, including real-time interaction with editors, literary agents, graphic artists, publishers, and other readers and writers. The first two students to complete the program were Yma Johnson and Emma Mayhood, both from Eastern Michigan University.https://youniversityproject.wordpress.com/  Books  Communion \\"A mixture of magical realism and war-set family drama revolving around a little girl, Gem, whose ability to communicate with animals assists her in her search to locate her father, who has gone missing in action at the height of World War II. It is at once an intimate portrait of a small Ohio town affected by war and an emotional epic about the enduring love between husband and wife and father and daughter.\\" This WWII drama allowed Marcantoni to indulge in his love for magic realism in telling a story of enduring love and hardship.https://www.amazon.com/Communion-Jean-Blasiar- ebook/dp/B00AA5CK4Y/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid;=1425618161&sr;=8-5&keywords;=Jonathan+Marcantoni Traveler's Rest \\"From the political turmoil of 1920s Puerto Rico, to the aftermath of a devastating hurricane in 2005, Traveler's Rest provides a kaleidoscopic look at a family that has lost its identity and torn itself apart. The ghosts of the past and the horrors of the present follow Tony, a recovering heroin addict, as he seeks to reclaim his family's legacy and set his own path in an increasingly chaotic world.\\" This collection of interconnected short stories was first written in 2006 and blends several literary styles, with Marcantoni experimenting with poetic narratives, stream of consciousness and inner monologues to tell the story of a family who lost their identity after leaving Puerto Rico.https://www.amazon.com/Travelers- Rest-Jonathan-Marcantoni- ebook/dp/B00EUN7ULA/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1425618161&sr;=8-3&keywords;=Jonathan+Marcantoni The Feast of San Sebastian (El festejo de San Sebastian) This is Marcantoni's first bilingual work.

Instead they are forced into slave labor at a North American factory. When their situation worsens to the point that their lives are at risk, they are given a chance for freedom by a black market middleman. The proposition is that can earn their freedom in exchange for assassinating the corrupt Superintendent of Police.\\" The work is Marcantoni's most assured, as it uses stream of conscious, multiple perspectives, and separate monologue chapters that allow the five main characters to tell their side of the story. In his own words: \\"This book was inspired by the study “Human Trafficking in Puerto Rico: An Invisible Challenge” by César A. Rey Hernández, Ph.D. and Luisa Hernández Angueira, Ph.D. The crimes and criminal syndicates depicted in the book are based on cases described in that study and also in articles published in the newspaper El Nuevo Día and reported by Wapa TV. The raids on slum communities, including La Perla, really did occur between 2009 and 2011, with the raid on La Perla leading to the resignation of then-Superintendent of Police Jose Figueroa Sancha. While these raids were widely believed by residents to be motivated by the desire to force residents to move and replace the slums with hotels, the actual depiction of the raids is fictional. My intention with this book is to educate, and hopefully, to create action in its readers. The problems facing Puerto Rico can be remedied, but only if we work together as a people to make a better future for our families and our country.\\"  Influences  Marcantoni has been influenced most by Fernando Pessoa, Hubert Selby Jr., Julio Cortazar, and Juan Jose Saer. He often references Selby in his works, particularly in his works possessing a central character with the same name as in other books, although they are different people. Selby used Harry for the central character of his books, while Marcantoni uses the name Antonio (or Tony for short). Marcantoni has said that while the Harry of Selby's work was meant to be an Everyman character, his use of the name Antonio is related to the character he would most want to play as an actor.

It makes the assumption that language is the result of a Darwinian adaptation. There are many competing theories of how language might have evolved, if indeed it is an evolutionary adaptation. They stem from the belief that language development could result from an adaptation, an exaptation, or a by-product. Genetics also influence the study of the evolution of language. It has been speculated that the FOXP2 gene may be what gives humans the ability to develop grammar and syntax. Language evolution theories In the debate surrounding the evolutionary psychology of language, three sides emerge: those who believe in language as an adaptation, those who believe it is a by-product of another adaptation, and those who believe it is an exaptation. Adaptation Scientist and psychologists Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex organs of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop. The complexity of the mechanisms, the faculty of language and the ability to learn language provides a comparative resource between the psychological evolved traits and the physical evolved traits. Pinker, though he mostly agrees with Noam Chomsky, a linguist and cognitive scientist, in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction, but Pinker and Bloom argue that the organic nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction. Cambridge University Press p. 259. By-product/Spandrel Noam Chomsky spearheaded the debate on the faculty of language as a cognitive by-product, or spandrel. As a linguist, rather than an evolutionary biologist, his theoretical emphasis was on the infinite capacity of speech and speaking: there are a fixed number of words, but there is an infinite combination of the words.Chomsky, N., Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use. Praeger, New York. (1986). His analysis from this considers that the ability of our cognition to perceive infinite possibilities, or create infinite possibilities, helped give way to the extreme complexity found in our language. Both Chomsky and Gould argue that the complexity of the brain is in itself an adaptation, and language arises from such complexities. On the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a by product, evolutionary biologist W. Tecumseh Fitch, following Stephen J. Gould, argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation.Fitch, W. T. (2011). The Evolution of Language. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press. p. 15. . He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptationist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether \\"Language has evolved as an adaptation\\" as being misleading. He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system. A similar argument is made by Terrence Deacon who in The Symbolic Species argues that the different features of language have co- evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes.Deacon, T. The Symbolic Species. 1997. Exaptation Exaptations, like adaptations, are fitness-enhancing characteristics, but, according to Stephen Jay Gould, their purposes were appropriated as the species evolved. This can be for one of two reasons: either the trait’s original function was no longer necessary so the trait took on a new purpose or a trait that does not arise for a certain purpose, but later becomes important. Typically exaptations have a specific shape and design which becomes the space for a new function. The foundation of this argument comes from the low-lying position of the larynx in humans.Fitch, T., \\"Evolutionary Developmental Biology and Human Language Evolution: Constraints on Adaptation.\\" \\"Evolutionary Biology\\". 39:4. pp. 613-30. Other mammals have this same positioning of the larynx, but no other species has acquired language. This leads exaptationists to see an evolved modification away from its original purpose. Genes and language Research has shown that “genetic constraints” on language evolution could have caused a “specialized” and “species-specific language module. It is through this module that there are many specified “domain-specific linguistic properties,” such as syntax and agreement. Adaptationists believe that language genes “coevolved with human language itself for the purpose of communication.” This view suggests that the genes that are involved with language would only have coevolved in a very stable linguist environment. This shows that language could not have evolved in a rapidly changing environment because that type of environment would not have been stable enough for natural selection. Without natural selection, the genes would not have coevolved with the ability for language, and instead, would have come from “cultural conventions.” The adaptationist belief that genes coevolved with language also suggests that there are no “arbitrary properties of language.” This is because they would have coevolved with language through natural selection. The Baldwin effect provides a possible explanation for how language characteristics that are learned over time could become encoded in genes. He suggested, like Darwin did, that organisms that can adapt a trait faster have a “selective advantage.” As generations pass, less environmental stimuli is needed for organisms of the species to develop that trait. Eventually no environmental stimuli are needed and it is at this point that the trait has become “genetically encoded.” FOXP2 gene Structure of the FOXP2 protein. Based on PyMOL rendering of Protein Data Bank (PDB) 2ao9. The genetic and cognitive components of language have long been under speculation, only recently have linguists been able to point out a gene that may possibly explain how language works.Fisher, S.E. & Scharff, C. (2009). \\"FOXP2 as a molecular window into speech and language.\\" Cell Press pp.166-177. Evolutionary psychologists hold that the FOXP2 gene may well be associated with the evolution of human language. In the 1980s, psycholinguist Myrna Gopnik identified a dominant gene that causes language impairment in the KE family of Britain. The KE family has a mutation in the FOXP2, that makes them suffer from a speech and language disorder. It has been argued that the FOXP2 gene is the grammar gene, which is what allows humans the ability to form proper syntax and make our communication of higher quality. Children that grow up in a stable environment are able to develop highly proficient language without any instruction. Individuals with a mutation to their FOXP2 gene have trouble mastering complex sentences, and shows signs of developmental verbal dyspraxia. This gene most likely evolved in the hominin line after the hominin and the chimpanzee lines split; this accounts for the fact that humans are the only ones able to learn and understand grammar.Christianse, M. H. & Kirby, S. (2004). Language Evolution. Oxford University Press. pp. 215-216. Humans have a unique allele of this gene, which has otherwise been closely conserved through most of mammalian evolutionary history. This unique allele seems to have first appeared between 100 and 200 thousand years ago, and it is now all but universal in humans. This suggests that speech evolved late in overall spectrum of human evolution. Variation in human language There are nearly 7000 languages worldwide, with a great amount of variation thought to have evolved through cultural differentiation. There are four factors that are thought to be the reason as to why there is language variation between cultures: founder effects, drift, hybridization and adaptation. With the vast amounts of lands available different tribes began to form and to claim their territory, in order to differentiate themselves many of these groups made changes to their language and this how the evolution of languages began. There also tended to be drifts in the population a certain group would get lost and be isolated from the rest of the group, this group would lose touch with the other groups and before they knew there had been mutations in their language and a whole new language had been formed. Hybridization also played a big role in the language evolution, one group would come in contact with another tribe and they would pick up words and sounds from each other eventually leading to the formation of a new language. Adaptation would also play a role in the evolution of language differentiation, the environment and the circumstances were constantly changing therefore the groups had to adapt to the environment and their language had to adapt to it as well, it is all about maximizing fitness. Atkinson theorized that language may have originated in Africa since African languages have a greater variation of speech sounds than other languages. Those sounds are seen as the root for the other languages that exist across the world. Communication in other animals Research indicates that nonhuman animals (e.g., apes, dolphins, and songbirds) show evidence of language. Comparative studies of the sensory-motor system reveal that speech is not special to humans: nonhuman primates can discriminate between two different spoken languages.Hauser, M. D., et al. (2002). The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? Science 298. pp. 1569-1579. Anatomical aspects of humans, particularly the descended larynx, has been believed to be unique to humans' capacity to speak. However, further research revealed that several other mammals have a descended larynx beside humans, which indicates that a descended larynx must not be the only anatomical feature needed for speech production. Vocal imitation is not uniquely human as well. Songbirds seem to acquire species-specific songs by imitating. Because nonhuman primates do not have a descended larynx, they lack vocal imitative capacity, which is why studies involving these primates have taught them nonverbal means of communication, e.g., sign language. Koko and Nim Chimpsky are two apes that have successfully learned to use sign language, but not to the extent that a human being can. Nim is a chimpanzee that was taken in by a family in the 1970s and was raised as if he were a human child. Nim was able to master 150 signs, which were limited but useful. Koko was a gorilla that was taken in by a Stanford student. She was able to master 1,000 signs for generative communication. Koko and Nim were not able to develop speech due to the fact that they lack the larynx which is what distinguishes humans from other animals and allows them to speak.

To his mother's pride, he wrote his first story in the 7th standard; It was titled Meri Mehbooba. After the partition of India in 1947 he moved to Amritsar, India. Rather than having been inspired by other writers, Bhalla's works came organically from his feelings. Bhalla had a unique writing style: for a given topic he wrote 20 – 1,000 verses and each started with the same word. He wrote more than 14 books which were written and published in several languages. He penned an Urdu epic poem titled Peelay Pattar (meaning yellow leaves) with 70,000 verses.

Historical abolition of slavery  Abolitionism has its roots in the 1807 Abolition of Slavery Act of Great Britain. Many academics in the field perceive this as the beginning of the end of the traditional form of slavery: chattel slavery. In the 19th century, Britain controlled the majority of the world through its colonies. Consequently, in passing this law to abolish slavery, the British Parliament abolished slavery in the vast majority of its colonies. Customarily, freedoms from slavery can also be found prior to the 19th century under the phrase \\"freedom from oppression and tyranny.\\" Because slavery is a condition of complete and total submission of one person to another, often with the exertion of force or power of the owner over the submissive, the phrase \\"freedom from oppression and tyranny\\" accurately encompasses the right to freedom from slavery. The United States Declaration of Independence,\\"Declaration of Independence.\\" United States of America, July 4, 1776 the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen,Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\\" National Assembly of France, August 26, 1789 the African Charter of Human Rights,\\"African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.\\" African Union, June 27, 1981 and the Constitution of South Africa\\"Constitution of South Africa.\\" South Africa, May 6, 1996 all present the idea that human beings should be free from tyranny and oppression. Although slavery continued to persist in some countries after these documents were written – namely, the United States, in which slavery continued until the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, although this only applies to people not convicted of a crime, which means the United States is currently violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by creating a conditional clause in which convicts are treated as slaves to the state – the underlying norm of this right is present. Through customary practice and the abolition of slavery, the international community has adopted the right of each person to be free from slavery.  Slavery Convention  The first large-scale move to abolish slavery by the international community came in 1926 with the Slavery Convention and again in 1957 when the Supplementary Convention came into power. The 1926 Slavery Convention provides the first international definition of slavery as: ::\\"the status or condition of a person over whom any or all the powers attaching to the right ownership are exercised...[and] included all acts involved in the capture, acquisition, or disposal of a person with intent to reduce him to slavery; acts involved in the acquisition of a slave with a view to selling or exchanging him; all acts of disposal by sale or exchange of a slave acquired with a view to being sold or exchanged, and in general, every act of trade or transport in slaves.\\"\\"Slavery Convention.\\" Geneva: Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, September 25, 1926: 1 Although this document provides the concrete definition of slavery, its definition is limited in the types of slavery it includes. Instead, it is descriptive of chattel slavery, most commonly understood as the plantation slavery in the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, even though chattel slavery was significantly more widespread and was not limited to one country alone. It is for this reason that the 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery was signed. It gives a more comprehensive definition of slavery to include debt bondage, serfdom, or any practice where a woman is promised or given into marriage on payment of money and is without the right to refuse the marriage, the husband of a woman has the right to transfer her to another person, a woman is liable to be inherited by another upon the death of her husband, or any practice where a child under 18 years of ages is exploited for his or her labour.\\"Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices.\\" Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, September 7, 1956. The 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery came into force on April 30, 1957 and of 2002 there were 97 states partied to the convention. The Slavery Convention and its supplementary document are beneficial in providing an international definition of slavery; however, there is no significant enforcement behind these documents. Both are declarations made by the collaboration of the international community, and agreements that signatories would modify their national laws in accordance with the convention, with the assistance of the United Nations if necessary; however, there are no consequences outlined in either document that provide incentive for signatories to abide by the convention  Human Rights Committee  The Human Rights Committee is governed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which entered into force on March 23, 1976. Article 8 of this Covenant states: “No one shall be held in slavery; slavery and the slave trade in all their forms shall be prohibited. No one shall be held in servitude. No one shall be required to perform force or compulsory labour.\\" The ICCPR outlines, in part IV, the obligations of states to uphold the freedom from slavery. All states are required to submit regular reports to the Committee on how the rights of the Covenant are being implemented. A state’s initial report must be within one year of acceding the Covenant and after this, whenever the committee requests a report (usually every four years). In addition to the submission of reports, article 41 of the Covenant makes it possible for the Committee to consider inter-state complaints, and furthermore, the First Optional Protocol to the Covenant give the Committee the capacity investigate individual complaints with regards to violations of the Covenant by state parties.\\"Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\\" New York: United Nations, 1966.  Observations of slavery  = Mali = Since coming into force, the Human Rights Committee has commented on conditions of slavery in numerous countries and has provided these countries with recommendations as to how they should proceed to abolish slavery. In Mali, the committee noted that the State party has not taken clear action in response the reports of slavery like practices and hereditary servitude in the country. In acknowledging this, the committee recommended that the state should conduct research to determine if these conditions of slavery still exist, and if they do to take action.\\"Concluding observations of the Human Rights Committee: Mali. 04/16/2003.\\" CCPR/CO/77/MLI. Human Rights Committee, 2003: 16 The committee also noted concerns of child trafficking into Côte d'Ivoire, where children were then being subjected to forced labour and slavery. In response to this phenomenon, the committee recommended that the Malian government take measures to prosecute the perpetrators of this traffic, and research more precise details regarding this situation for the committee analysis. = Serbia in part under United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo = The committee observed situations of trafficking of human beings, namely women and children, in Serbia Kosovo part under local municipal Kosovo Albanian administration and United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo rule , and corresponding reports that the perpetrators of these acts were going unpunished.

Human Rights Committee, 2006: 12  Modern slavery that falls under international law   Debt bondage  Debt bondage is the most common form of slavery today. It is a condition in which a person “pledges him or herself against a loan of money, but the length and nature of the service is undefined, and the labor does not diminish the original debt.”Bales, Kevin. \\"Expendable People: Slavery in the Age of Globalization.\\" Journal of International Affairs 53, no. 2 (2000): 463. Debt bondage was included and defined as a form of slavery under the 1956 Supplementary Convention on Slavery. However, its many modern forms continue to include pawning, peonage, and worker debt.Miers, Suzanne. \\"Contemporary Forms of Slavery.\\" Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 724. In India, debt bondage has been illegal since 1976; however, due to widespread poverty in the country, it continues to exist, as a man may need a loan to finance a wedding, funeral, medicine, fertilizer, or a fine. Because the interest rates on these debts as so high, debts are often inherited and children may replace their fathers or siblings. Debt bondage can also be incurred by specific industries – quarrying, carpet-making, agriculture, and fisheries – where the cost of equipment and supplies falls on the worker who needs a loan to pay for them.  Forced prostitution  Forced prostitution and sexual slavery are considered contemporary manifestations of this historical crime, and can be found anywhere in the world. Women are often entrapped by deceit or coercion with the promise of better life and remain entrapped by force or debt bondage.Miers, Suzanne. \\"Contemporary Forms of Slavery.\\" Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 729. Forced marriage can also be considered a form of slavery, notably when the bride has no right or opportunity to refuse marriage. This form of marriage can also result out of a kidnapping of girls in order to sell them as brides, a widespread phenomena in China.Miers, Suzanne. \\"Contemporary Forms of Slavery.\\" Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 737. Once married and raped, there girls are often kept under lock and key until they have a child, at which time they will be less likely to leave because they do not want to abandon their child.  Child slavery  Child slavery is also considered a contemporary form of slavery, although its does come with debate as to what constitutes child slavery. However, child prostitution is widely considered a form of slavery in which children, mostly from South East Asia, South Asia, and Latin America, “are sold by their parents either because they are destitute, have too many mouths to feed, or are simply greedy”.Miers, Suzanne. \\"Contemporary Forms of Slavery.\\" Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 731. On the other hand, in some cases of child prostitution, when parents give their children up to traffickers, they are deceived into believing that their child will earn good money, get an education, or learn a trade.Miers, Suzanne. \\"Contemporary Forms of Slavery.\\" Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 732.  Forced labour  Forced labour can also be imposed by governments who “conscript their own subjects and put them to work for minimal, or no pay, and for varying lengths of time”.Miers, Suzanne. \\"Contemporary Forms of Slavery\\". Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 733. Forced labour can, likewise, be used simply to cut production costs by private and public industries (e.g. cocoa plantations), or can be a form of involuntary servitude in the private sector – sweatshops.Miers, Suzanne. \\"Contemporary Forms of Slavery\\". Canadian Journal of African Studies 34, no. 3 (2000): 734. Bales refers to this type of slavery as contract slavery, where “contracts are offered which guarantee employment, perhaps in a workshop or factory, but when the workers are taken to their place of employment they discover that they have instead been taken into slavery...it is a way of making slavery seem legitimate and necessary”.Bales, Kevin. \\"Expendable People: Slavery in the Age of Globalization.\\" Journal of International Affairs 53, no. 2 (2000): 464.

She has programmed and designed shows for artists including Kanye West, Jay Z, American Idol, Herbie Hancock and Porter Robinson, as well as composed and performed string arrangements for Kanye West and Jay Z. In 2008, Escudé became the world's first Ableton Certified Trainer, implementing the software in many high grossing live shows around the world. With her professional experience as a controllerist and sound designer, Escudé founded Electronic Creatives, an Ableton-Certified Training Center where she trains and produces talented and sought-after music programmers and controllerists in the industry. Electronic Creatives also offers professional live show designing services to various artists, as well as courses for music production and playback engineering. Over the years, a new generation of music programmers and live show designers she has trained have gone on to tour with prominent artists such as The Weeknd, Harry Styles, Ariana Grande, Mariah Carey, and Logic. When she is not working on live shows, Escudé spends her time creating new sounds under the moniker Alluxe. As an artist, Laura's signature \\"future classical\\" sound fuses avant-garde and classical with live electronica to create a unique, hybrid style of electronic music.  Early Life & Education  Born in Pensacola, Florida, Escudé was trained as a classical violinist and pianist from the early age of 6. She began pursuing the violin more seriously and became the Concertmaster of Rogers High School in Newport, Rhode Island and was awarded the 1997 Governor's Scholar Award to attend the Interlochen Center for the Arts Summer Music Program. She later became the Concertmaster of the Rhode Island Youth Philharmonic . Aside from her keen interest in music, Escudé was passionate about singing and acting as well and actively participated in school musicals such as The Rocky Horror Picture Show and was involved in many other school events while growing up. Her passion towards fitness and wellness also started young as she was a competitive runner and was the captain of the school's cross-country track and field team. When she was 18, Escudé received a scholarship to attend Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN, but transferred to Florida State University after a year to explore more contemporary music in Violin Performance and to pursue a minor in Business. It was there that she started becoming interested in production and became a self-taught music producer. She performed in the Pensacola Symphony Orchestra as well as the Florida State University Symphony. As a student, Escudé would book shows at the campus’ live-music venue, and got the opportunity to meet with various artists as well as professionals in the world of live show design. Over her years in college, she participated in many electronic music festivals and learned by recording over DJ sets.  Career  Upon graduation in 2002, Escudé taught at the International Academy of Design and Technology in Tampa, Florida and began her violin performance career with the Santa Monica Symphony, Torrance Symphony, Multi-Ethnic Star Orchestra (MESTO), and the Observatory Orchestra. In 2005, she began working in Technical Support at M-Audio where she went on to do Sales and Artist Relations. In 2007, Escudé became Ableton’s first West Coast Product Specialist and a few months after, she became the world's first Ableton Live Certified Trainer and became one of the first to implement music software in some of the most prestigious live shows all over the globe. In 2008, she founded Evotech Audio, a freelance consultancy for musical instruments brands as a product specialist for clients such as Ableton, Dubspot, MacProVideo, FXpansion, Rob Papen, MV Pro Audio, Melodyne, X-Tempo Designs, Namba Gear, Toontrack. In 2009, Escudé formed Electronic Creatives, an Ableton certified training center, that conducted educational events in the field of music production. One of her first major clients was Kanye West’s engineer, Anthony Kilhoffer whom she assisted in the programming of the Glow in the Dark tour. At that time, she was also touring with Niyaz, an Iranian electronic band, as a violinist and a music programmer. A few months later, she moved to Las Vegas and worked on the pre-production for Cirque du Soleil’s Viva Elvis Show as a programmer. In 2011, Escudé began going on tours with Kanye West as his official music programmer and live vocal effect designer, and has been his primary playback engineer ever since. Over the years, she also worked with other prominent artists such as Porter Robinson, Demi Lovato, Iggy Azalea, Charli XCX, Logic, The Weeknd, Miguel, Becky G, Missy Elliott, Rita Ora, Solange, Crystal Method, Camila Cabello, Jay-Z, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Herbie Hancock, Cat Power, Bon Iver, Drake, Silversun Pickups, Garbage, Childish Gambino and M83. In 2012, Electronic Creatives branched out to provide music programming and live show design services. With Escudé’s years of experience in music programming, DJing and controllerist skills, she trained a new generation of programmers and playback engineers for artists such as Harry Styles, Mariah Carey, Logic, Ariana Grande, The Weeknd, Big Sean, Vic Mensa, Rae Sremmurd, Pentatonix, Charli XCX, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Porter Robinson, Iggy Azalea and many more. Electronic Creatives also went on to specialize in building live performance equipment and offered gear rental services to professional artists. In 2017, Escudé created the Transmute Retreat, a place for artists to create the next version of their live show in a healthy, supportive environment. Transmute Retreat was first started at the Atlantic Center for the Arts in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, and there have been plans to expand the program to various locations in the US and in other countries as well. In 2018, she created MASTERTRACK, the first two-week intensive program for music programmers and playback engineers to prepare them for touring.  Musical Style  Laura has released music under her own name and as Alluxe. As an artist, Laura’s signature “future classical” sound fuses avant-garde and classical with live electronica to create a unique, hybrid style of electronic music. Escudé complements it with custom LED controllers, vocals and violin, blending original compositions, improvised beats, and violin loops. Escudé's production skills have earned her remix commissions from M83, Polica and Mr. Hudson, and her violin playing can be heard on albums by Kanye West, Jay Z, Big Grams, Hit Boy, Sage Francis, Solillaquists of Sound and in EastWest’s Quantum Leap Silk sound library.  Collaborations  Alluxe has opened for the likes of Miguel, Garbage, Machinedrum, Robert Rich and Funkstorung and has performed with Miguel, Kiesza, Charli XCX and Iggy Azalea.  Community & Empowerment  Escudé is the creator of the Transmute Retreat, a retreat that allows live performers to experience accelerated transformation in a healthy, relaxed atmosphere focused on self realization and care. In recent years, she has grown to be particularly interested in the area of mental health & wellness for artists after years of professional touring. Escudé has been known to advocate for and invests in helping other high- performing artists like herself to discover the tools to begin their own transformation in shifting towards a healthy and supportive atmosphere. As one of the only women in this male-dominated industry, Escudé is widely regarded as “one of the best in the world at this job”. She aims to inspire other women and the next generation through women empowerment conferences and speaking engagements and has been invited as a guest speaker to speak at leading music technology institutions such as the University of Southern California (USC) and Berklee College of Music in both the Boston campus as well as the one in Valencia, Spain.

Welser and aunt of Philippine Welser. In 1618 Zimbert became a burgher of Hamburg, and founded the firm Paulus Pütz & Zimbrecht Jenisch with his relatives. The firm became a major import-export firm from the White Sea area in Russia to the Mediterranean. Married twice, Zimbert's first wife from 1618 was Maria Elisabeth Putz from Stade and after her death from 1635 he remarried to Esther Amsinck, a daughter of Hamburg senator Rudolf Amsinck. In 1641 he founded the Drondheimbsche Compagnie (Trondheim Company), headquartered in Glückstadt (then in Denmark), that imported fish from Norway to Germany.

It regulates water levels and inhibits unfavourable currents in the Copenhagen Harbour, occupying both sides of the narrow strait between Zealand and Amager. It lends its name to the adjacent Sluseholmen neighbourhood. History Aerial of Slusen, c. 1930 The Slusen lock system was established between 1901 and 1903 as a consequence of the comprehensive changes which had taken part in Copenhagen Harbour over the past decades. Large-scale expansions of the harbor had dug away enormous amounts of material which had in turn been used for reclamations elsewhere. Especially the ones in the southern part of the harbor, Islands Brygge and the areas now known as Sluseholmen and Teglholmen on the Zealand side, had led to strong currents of up to 6knots. Due to the relatively weak engines of ships at that time, it made navigation difficult. Slusen in about 1930 The lock was used by fishing vessels, dredgers and smaller freight ships right up until the 1970s. The Sjællandsbroen bridge was built to the south of the lock in 1969. It was designed by Niels Rohwder. It originally opened to passing vessels. It is now permanently closed and with a clearance of just three metres, only smaller boats can now enter and exit Copenhagen Harbour from the The site The roof of the main building The lock consists of an embankment in granite with associated system. It extended for almost two km from Frederiksholm (now Kongens Enghave) to Amager. A house of the lock keeper and another building for the engine which powered the machinery was built on a small artificial island which was established halfway along the embankment. The buildings were designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup who served as architect for Port of Copenhagen. On the south side of the embankment, a small harbor was established where ships could berth while they awaiting passage. Over the years the shallow waters along entire eastern section of the embankment have been filled, meaning that the island with the buildings now appears as an integrated part of Amager. Today The lock closed in 1995 but reopened after a renovation in 2004. Houseboat colony The Slusehavnen harbor at Sjællandsbroen is now home to a sizeable houseboat colony, \\"Husbådskolonien København\\". The association was founded in 1987 as \\"Kajforeningen Kalvebod Brygge\\" (\\"Quay Association Kalvebod Brygge\\") since most of the boats at that time was berthed in Tømmergraven at Kalvebod Brygge. They had to move when the shopping mall Fisketorvet was built and the Havneholmen development was planned.

The world's largest Arctic polynya at about , it creates a warm microclimate that provides a refuge for narwhal, beluga, walrus, and bowhead whales to feed and rest. While thin ice forms in some areas, the polynya is kept open by wind, tides and an ice bridge on its northern edge. Named the \\"North Water\\" by 19th century whalers who relied on it for spring passage, this polynya is one of the most biologically productive marine areas in the Arctic Ocean.  Fauna  Polynyas are often compared to oases as their open waters allow for an unusually early spring plankton bloom and an open water wintering area in a frozen world. This provides food for Arctic cod, a species that plays a critical role in supporting the entire ecosystem. Large concentrations of marine mammals, from walrus to seals and polar bears, feed at the ice edge until spring break-up. The same habitat provides vital feeding grounds for millions of seabirds, including an estimated two-thirds of the world population of little auk (dovekie) and thick-billed murres.Gaston, A.J. 2002. Results of monitoring Thick-billed Murre populations in the eastern Canadian Arctic 1976-2000. Pp. 13-33. Canadian Wildlife Service, Occ. Paper 106.Bâcle, J. 2000. The physical oceanography of waters under the North Water Polynya. McGill University.  Human history  This region has been home to the northernmost human settlements in the world for at least 5,000 years, through the Dorset and Thule cultural migrations. Present day Inuit communities in Canada and Qaasuitsup (northwest Greenland) rely on the polynya's concentration of marine mammals to sustain their traditional way of life. The North Water is home to the northernmost self-sufficient human settlements in the world, and borders three Inuit communities in Canada: Arctic Bay, Pond Inlet and Grise Fiord. These communities, along with the Inuit of Qaasuitsup rely on the abundance of marine life North Water for their food, clothing, shelter, and essential cultural and economic well-being. There is evidence that the North Water was visited by the Vikings in southern Greenland in the 13th century. It wasn't until 1616 that the Discovery, captained by Robert Bylot and piloted by William Baffin, sailed into this region, naming its landmarks such as Sir Thomas Smith's Bay (now Smith Sound) and Lancaster Sound after those who financed their expeditions. Between the 15th and 19th centuries, European whalers arrived and hunted bowhead whales to the brink of extinction.  Research  Since 1867 the North Water ecosystem has been a favourite study site for Western scientists trying to unlock the oceanographic and biological secrets of Arctic polynyas. Researchers have also conducted intensive studies on the region's response to global climate change because of its mid-Arctic latitude amidst a polar ecosystem warming twice as fast as the rest of the world.Polynyas: Windows to the World. Edited by W.O. Smith and D.G. Barber. 2007. www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/04229894  Formation  The North Water Polynya (Saqvaaq) is closely connected to Lancaster Sound (Inuktitut ᑕᓪᓗᕈᑎᐅᑉ ᑕᕆᐅᖓ Tallurutiup TariungaThe Canadian Northwest Passage? Taissumani. Nunatsiaq News 2009-12-17 Kenn Harper) and Baffin Bay by a powerful system of ocean currents that directly affect the region's climate and biology. In a sense the NOW polynya is a result of the merging of three smaller polynya's Smith Sound, Lady Ann Strait, and Lancaster Sound. The West Greenland Current follows that country's coastline and moves warm and salty Atlantic water north, reaching all the way to the North Water Polynya. An upwelling of warmer water in this polynya helps keep it partially ice-free throughout the year, even when the ocean directly north and south is frozen. Another arm of the West Greenland Current reaches into Lancaster Sound, delivering Atlantic waters into the Arctic Ocean and contributing to that area's rich ecology.  Conservation  The lands adjacent to the North Water have been recognized internationally for their importance. In 1974 Denmark created Northeast Greenland National Park, the world's largest national park in northeast Greenland. In 1977 it was designated an international biosphere reserve. Likewise Canada created Canada's second largest national park, Quttinirpaaq in 1988 on the adjacent Ellesmere Island. Twelve percent of the world's land is protected, but only 1.6 percent of the global ocean area is protected.Protected Planet Report 2012 In a time of increasing Arctic industrial activity the waters of the North Water polynya have not been given any formal protection. In 1982 the western waters in Lancaster Sound were listed as one of the greatest 188 natural areas in the world, and one of the only sites in the Arctic to get this recognition. Two sites within Lancaster Sound were chosen as the top 219 \\"The World's Greatest Natural Areas\\"The World's Greatest Natural Areas by international work groups that met from 1980-1982. Of the world quality Nearctic sites listed, 31 years later only the two Lancaster Sound sites have not achieved national or provincial protection (nor any IUCN category Level I-VI of protection). There are presently no World Heritage Sites above the 73rd parallel north.World Heritage List Interactive Map At the 2012 IUCN Conservation Congress in Korea a resolution was passed calling on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to \\"promote Locally Managed Marine Areas as a socially inclusive approach to meeting area-based conservation and Marine Protected Area targets.\\"WCC-2012-Res-077-EN An Indigenous Peoples' Organization membership and voting category was also added at that congress.Establishing an Indigenous Peoples’ Organization (IPO) membership and voting category in IUCN The only present protection is a 1983 promise by Denmark and Canada to develop \\"further bilateral cooperation in respect of the protection of the marine environment of the waters lying between Canada and Greenland and of its living resources...\\"Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark for Cooperation Relating to the Marine Environment E101887 - CTS 1983 No. 19 In April 2016, a special Pikialaorsuaq Commission led by the Inuit Circumpolar Council began collecting input of residents in the High Arctic communities of Canada and Greenland on future protections of the North Water Polynya.ICC to consult Inuit on future of North Water polynya. In April 2017 a Canadian report entitled “A new Shared Arctic Leadership Model” by Mary Simon recommended that Canada accept the Pikialasorsuaq Commission's recommendation for the creation of an Inuit-led management plan and monitoring process for the entire North Water Polynya and consider recognizing the region as an IPA (Indigenous Protected Area).

The Chadian forces were not part of the African-led International Support Mission to Mali but integrated into an existing French command structure. The same day the arrival of the Chadian army in Niamey was confirmed. Backed by technicals and Eland-90 armoured cars, Chadian forces entered Mali via Niger, securing the former Islamist town of Ménaka on 28 January. According to a statement by the French Ministry of Defense, Chadian forces left their base in Ménaka and headed towards the north of the country in support of Malian armed forces in the area. On 31 January, some 1,800 Chadian soldiers entered the city of Kidal without resistance, as French forces captured the outskirts of the city a few days prior to the formal capture. The Chadian army contributed to the security of the city, currently held by the MNLA. On 7 February, in the evening Chadian and French forces entered the town of Aguelhok. On 8 February, French and Chadian forces announced they captured the town of Tessalit near the Algerian border, the seat of one of the last airports still held by insurgents. On 12 February, according to numerous sources, a Chadian soldier succumbed to an illness, marking the first death since the Chadian intervention began in late January. On 22 February, supported by French fighters, the Chadian army launched a joint military operation with the support of French war jets on an Islamists base said to be of \\"significant importance\\", where 8 French hostages were believed to be held along with caches of heavy weaponry, artillery shells, anti-tank weapons, and mines were said to be hidden in the mountains of the Adrar des Ifoghas. By the end of the day, the mission was considered to be a success with 93 Islamists killed or captured, but leaving 26 Chadian soldiers dead and 52 others severely wounded, the dead included several high-ranking Chadian commanders in Mali, including special forces commander Abdel Aziz Hassane Adam. On 25 February, during a joint military operation in the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains, Chadian forces reported the killing of al-Qaeda right- hand leader of AQIM, Abou Zeïd, along with 40 of his followers. It's unknown whether he was killed by French airstrikes or by Chadian ground forces, as the information was neither confirmed nor denied by the French Government. On 1 March, the Chadian army claimed to have killed Mokhtar Belmokhtar. According to a government statement, Mokhtar along with several other extremists were killed, and weapons, equipment, and 40 vehicles were seized. In April, the Chadian government dismissed their previous claim of killing Mokhtar, saying he blew himself up, along with several other militants, in despair after learning about the death of Abou Zeïd. On 12 March, a Chadian soldier was killed in a skirmish along with six Islamists, according to military officials. On 12 April, a suicide bomber detonated his explosive belts while a group of Chadian soldiers were passing by in a busy market in Kidal, killing four soldiers and the bomber in the blast, which also injured five civilians. On 14 April, Chadian president Idriss Déby Itno announced the full withdrawal of Chadian soldiers from Mali, citing face to face with the Islamists is over and the Chadian army doesn't have the skills to fight a guerilla-style war, referring to the previous attack in Kidal that killed four of its soldiers. According to local sources the army had already withdrawn a mechanized battalion a few days prior to the formal announcement and pulled out its troops from Aguelhok and Tessalit. On 15 April, the Chadian parliament voted overwhelmingly for a resolution for the withdrawal of Chadian forces in Mali, \\"within a reasonable timeframe\\". The same day the Chadian army announced that it lost 36 soldiers during the three-month intervention in northern Mali and suffered another 74 wounded. In total the presence of Chadian soldiers in Mali costs the country 57 billion CFA francs (87 million). During the intervention, at least 2,250 soldiers were deployed with 250 vehicles and a heavy amount of supplies. On 17 April, tension grew between the separatists Tuareg group MNLA and the Chadian army stationed in Kidal. The MNLA accused the Chadian army of planning to allow Malian forces to be deployed to the city and firing on unarmed civilians during demonstrations against Chadian military rule.

It is classified as a secondary care facility. The hospital is operated by Calvary Health Care ACT, a not-for-profit venture of Little Company of Mary Health Care (LCMHC) on behalf of the ACT Government and is integrated into the Territory's public healthcare system. Calvary was established in 1979. It is a teaching hospital affiliated with the Australian Catholic University, Australian National University and University of Canberra. The Calvary Private Hospital and Hyson Green Mental Health Clinic are co-located on the site and share many facilities with the public hospital. History An agreement between the Commonwealth Government and Corporation of the Little Company of Mary was reached on 22 October 1971 to construct and operate a public hospital providing up to 300 beds to service the Inner North and Belconnen districts in Canberra, to be located on a site in the new suburb of Bruce. The new hospital commenced operations in May 1979, with the ownership and operation of the hospital remaining largely unchanged following the transition to self- government of the Territory in 1988. In 2007/2008 the hospital conducted a pilot Refugee Mentoring Program. This community program is designed to provide refugees to Australia with work experience and career information and promotes cross cultural understanding. The program was launched in June 2008 and is funded through LCMHC's national Community Benefit Program. In 2009, amid concerns regarding the ACT hospital system reaching capacity the Territory Government investigated acquiring the hospital to bring it under full government ownership and control. The move was prompted by government concerns about control of its assets should it commit to investing in upgrading the existing hospital. However following public consultation and extensive negotiations with LCMHC in 2010, this proposal failed to eventuate and the existing operational agreements have been maintained. The Government projects medium term demand for another 400 hospital beds across Canberra and are now pursuing options to meet this including the construction of a new public hospital to be built in the northern suburbs, with some services separated and others shared with Calvary. In May 2014, the ACT Government announced $19 million funding for the construction of a 700 space multi-story car park to relieve demand for parking at the hospital, as well as upgrading the hospital's electrical sub-station to allow for expansion of clinical services offered on the campus. Calvary hospital was among the earliest institutions in Australia to undertake sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures under the guidance of prominent local breast cancer surgeon Dr. John Buckingham. Calvary Emergency Department Services Calvary hospital provides services including: *Emergency department *Intensive Care Unit *Reconstructive surgery *General medicine and surgery *Mental Health *Obstetrics, Gynecology and Neonatology *Rheumatology *Cardiology *Endocrinology *Gastroenterology and respiratory care *Urology *Neurology *Ophthalmology *Orthopaedics *Oncology and breast cancer nursing services *Pastoral Care The Bruce campus is also home to a variety of outpatient and Allied Health services which operate in conjunction with the hospital. Due to moral concerns of the Catholic church, the agreement under which the hospital operates allows that certain procedures including In vitro fertilisation and induced abortions not be performed at Calvary. Statistics In the 2011-2012 financial year, Calvary Hospital conducted 4,691 elective surgeries and handled 53,650 Emergency Department presentations. Waiting times were significantly longer than national averages and comparable hospitals in all measures except for urgent emergencies, where the hospital performed to an average standard, and urgent elective surgeries where according to the Australian Government's My Hospital website 97% of patients were treated within clinically recommended timeframes, compared to an average of 92% at comparable hospitals.

It is a small molecule BRAF inhibitor that targets key enzymes in the MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway occurs in many different cancers including melanoma and colorectal cancers. The substance was being developed by Novartis and then by Array BioPharma. In June 2018, it was approved by the FDA in combination with binimetinib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma. The most common (≥25%) adverse reactions in patients receiving the drug combination were fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and arthralgia.  Pharmacology  Encorafenib acts as an ATP-competitive RAF kinase inhibitor, decreasing ERK phosphorylation and down-regulation of CyclinD1. This arrests the cell cycle in G1 phase, inducing senescence without apoptosis. Therefore, it is only effective in melanomas with a BRAF mutation, which make up 50% of all melanomas. The plasma elimination half-life of encorafenib is approximately 6 hours, occurring mainly through metabolism via cytochrome P450 enzymes.  Clinical trials  Several clinical trials of LGX818, either alone or in combinations with the MEK inhibitor MEK162, are being run. As a result of a successful Phase Ib/II trials, Phase III trials are currently being initiated.  History  Approval of encorafenib in the United States was based on a randomized, active-controlled, open-label, multicenter trial (COLUMBUS; NCT01909453) in 577 patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive binimetinib 45 mg twice daily plus encorafenib 450 mg once daily, encorafenib 300 mg once daily, or vemurafenib 960 mg twice daily. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The major efficacy measure was progression-free survival (PFS) using RECIST 1.1 response criteria and assessed by blinded independent central review. The median PFS was 14.9 months for patients receiving binimetinib plus encorafenib, and 7.3 months for the vemurafenib monotherapy arm (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.71, p<0.0001). The trial was conducted at 162 sites in Europe, North America and various countries around the world.

It technically is the last link, the western end of California Avenue, a major east–west street in Santa Monica. History and overview The California Incline was originally a walkway known as Sunset Trail, which was cut through the bluffs to provide beach access to pedestrians in 1896. A roadway structure in length was built in 1932. It is a vital street in Santa Monica, linking the PCH with Ocean Avenue and California Avenue, bisecting Palisades Park. It begins at an intersection with Ocean Avenue and California Avenue, at the top of the Palisades, extending to the PCH at the base of the bluffs. 2015–16 reconstruction The California Incline was identified as structurally deficient in the early 1990s. In 2007, the City of Santa Monica secured federal highway funds to replace the structure with one meeting current seismic standards. The new bridge consists of a pile-supported reinforced concrete slab structure with a width of , an increase of over the previous structure. The project cost $17 million, with 88.5% coming from federal funds and the balance from local funds. Construction began in April 2015 and took 17 months to complete. The roadway reopened to the public on September 1, 2016. The rebuilt structure includes wider sidewalks and bicycle lanes. Popular culture The California Incline has been featured in various films, including It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) and Knocked Up (2007). It was also featured in the hardboiled crime novel, In a Lonely Place (1942), written by Dorothy B. Hughes.

UCEM is also one of eight original members of the Independent Universities Group, made up of universities not funded by the HEFCE. As of 2013, UCEM had educated over 150,000 students. University College of Estate Management, 60 Queens Road, Reading, Berkshire  History  The College of Estate Management was founded in 1919 by the \\"Chartered Auctioneers' and Estate Agent's Institute\\" later becoming the \\"Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors\\" (RICS). The college was formed specifically to serve the property-related Estate Management and Construction industry sectors. The scale of British lives lost in the First World War had led to a shortage of trained staff to manage the country's estates. In 1938 the College gained recognition from the University of London to provide tuition for its internal degree. An association with the University of Reading goes back to 1967 and the College relocated from Kensington in London to the University of Reading's Whiteknights Campus in 1972. Today UCEM is an independent self-funded charity, and was granted Taught Degree Awarding Powers in its own right by the Privy Council in January 2013. On 11 November 2015, CEM was awarded university college status by the Privy Council and changed its name to the University College of Estate Management. In September 2013, the college appointed Ashley Wheaton as its 9th Principal, taking over the role from former Principal Dr Ann Heywood who retired. Formerly located at the University of Reading's Whiteknights Campus, UCEM moved premises in September 2016 to 60 Queens Road, Reading, Berkshire. His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales has been patron of UCEM from 1998 to present (2020). In March 2019, to celebrate the University's centenary year of existence, Prince Charles visited the UCEM building in Reading, to meet students and staff. (See Talk)  Courses and qualifications offered  A large variety of courses are offered, including programmes accredited by professional bodies such as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Chartered Institute of Building. UCEM diploma or degree courses include (to Nov 2014) surveying practice, building surveying, construction management, estate management, property management, quantity surveying, shopping centre management, construction and real estate.

It has been commercially available in North America since 1938 and has since been planted in Canada and the United States (particularly New York). However, in warmer climates the grape is highly susceptible to a number of grapevine viruses, which has discouraged plantings of the variety.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 197, Allen Lane 2012 History and pedigree The Vitis labrusca grape variety Concord (pictured) is one of the grape varieties that make up Cascade's complex pedigree. Cascade is a Seibel grape, being produced from a crossing of Seibel 7042 and Gloire de Seibel by the French viticulturist Albert Seibel in the early 1930s. The variety was first released for commercial production in 1938. Known originally as Seibel 13053, the grape was given the name \\"Cascade\\" by the Finger Lakes Wine Growers Association in 1970.Lisa Smiley \\"Cascade \\" Iowa State University, 2008. Accessed: April 13th, 2008 The exact reasoning behind the name is unclear, with some winegrowers speculating that the name came from the way that the highly productive vine would have fruit \\"cascading off the vine\\" like a waterfall even from water sprouts and suckers.Lon Rombough The Grape Grower: A Guide to Organic Viticulture pgs 128, 181, 202 Chelsea Green Publishing (2002) Cascade is considered an inter-specific \\"complex hybrid\\" meaning that within its pedigree are grape varieties from several species of the Vitis genus. Taken together the pedigree of Cascade includes varieties from the Vitis vinifera, Vitis labrusca, Vitis rupestris, Vitis rotundifolia and Vitis lincecumii species. Seibel 7042 is a crossing of Seibel 5351 and Seibel 6268. Gloire de Seibel is a cross of Seibel 867 and Seibel 452. From these parent and grandparent varieties Cascade is descended from Concord, Chasselas Musqué and the Vitis vinifera teinturier grape Alicante Bouschet (great-grandparents to Seibel 5351). Cascade also has extended relations with another vinifera teinturier Alicante Ganzin (grandparent to Seibel 452) and the Munson grape (great-grandparent to Seibel 452). The phylloxera-resistance rootstock variety Rupestris du Lot is also related to Cascade as a grandparent variety to Seibel 452. Relationship to other grapes Cascade was crossed with Seyve-Villard to produce L'Acadie blanc (vine pictured) In Canada, Cascade was crossed with the white Villard grape Seyve-Villard at the University of Guelph Horticultural Research Institute of Ontario to produce the white wine grape L'Acadie blanc. Viticulture Cascade is a very early ripening variety that can be very productive and high yielding. The color of the grape berry skins can have a bright blue hue.Appellation America \\"Cascade\\" Accessed: April 13th, 2013 It is a moderately winter hardy vine able to withstand winter temperature down to . The grape carries strawberry notes and aromas. It bears heavily (over 50 lbs per vine is common) and in the opinion of some growers \\"can't be overcropped\\" (meaning it does not lose its varietal character with higher yields as other varieties (e.g., Pinot Noir) do. However while its loose-berry clusters tends to have good resistance to fungal infections (such as downy and powdery mildew), in some climates the vine is highly prone to a number of soil-borne viral grapevine disease such as tomato ringspot virus which creates yellow veins in the leaves, stunts the growth of shoots and causes fruit clusters not to set properly.CAB International and European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization \\"Tomato ringspot nepovirus \\" Data Sheets on Quarantine Pests. Accessed: April 13th, 2013 Wine regions In 1975 there were 183 acres (74 hectares) of Cascade planted in New York state but the relatively poor quality of wine produced from the grape and its susceptibility to grapevine disease has caused many producers to uproot those plantings. Today there are some plantings of Cascade in Virginia where the variety is usually ready for harvest by mid-August. Cascade may be a useful grape in the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Cascade tends to produce light bodied wines that are very low in acid. While it is rarely made as a varietal, though it can be used in rosé production, it is often blended with other hybrid grape varieties such as Maréchal Foch and Baco noir which it contributes to the perfume aroma of the wine. It is also important to note that one can interpret this word as a way of convincing someone that there is a hidden meaning to something, when in fact there is not. For instance \\"Kristen cascaded Jacob when she told him there was a hidden meaning\\". Synonyms As a relatively recently created hybrid variety, Cascade is not known under many synonyms with only S 13053 and Seibel 13053 being recognized by the Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC).Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Cascade Accessed: April 13th, 2013 References Category:Red wine grape varieties Category:Seibel grapes ","title":"Cascade (grape)"},{"id":"39105178","text":"Rédoine Faïd (; born 10 May 1972) is a French gangster and serial jailbreaker, considered France's most wanted criminal in 2013.

In 1997, seven of eight accused were tried for said charges (the eighth having fled to Algeria). Faïd spent three years on the run in Switzerland and the Palestinian Territories before being arrested in 1998. In his autobiography, he claimed to have disguised himself as an Orthodox Jew and learned Hebrew while in Israel, and that he was taught firearms skills by an Israeli soldier. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison, but was released on parole after serving ten years. In 2009 he wrote a book, Braqueur - Des cités au grand banditisme, (Robber - From the Projects to Organized Crime) about growing up in a life of crime in Paris' banlieues, and claimed to have given up a life of crime. However, he was the suspected mastermind of an armed robbery that claimed the life of a policewoman in 2010, and subsequently was caught after he broke parole conditions in 2011, which returned him to prison for eight years. Contra Mundum Press will be publishing a translation of his book in early 2020.  Prison escapes  = 2013 = On the morning of 13 April 2013, he broke out of the Sequedin prison, using explosives to blast through five prison doors, holding four prison wardens hostage during the escape and employing the use of a getaway car. He then burned the car in Lille and left in another vehicle. The same day, a Europe-wide warrant was issued. Faïd was arrested again on 29 May 2013, in a B&B; hotel in Pontault-Combault, Seine-et-Marne, France.\\"Fin de cavale en Seine-et-Marne pour le braqueur Redoine Faïd\\", leparisien.fr, 29 May 2013 Interpol stated that he had been trying to obtain forged documents to reach Israel. = 2018 = At around 11:30 am on 1 July 2018, Faïd was broken out of a prison in Réau with the help of three armed accomplices and a helicopter. The helicopter had been hijacked from a nearby airfield by criminals posing as flight school students. At gunpoint, the flying instructor was forced to participate in the escape. The helicopter was later found not far from Charles de Gaulle Airport, it is believed that he escaped by car along with the three men.\\"Le braqueur Redoine Faïd s'évade par hélicoptère de la prison de Réau\\", leparisien.fr, 01 July 2018\\"Redoine Faid: Paris helicopter prison break for gangster\\", BBC News, 01 July 2018 Other sources have reported that the flight instructor had been released uninjured. French police have focused primarily on a domestic manhunt, but believe in a potential lead, that Faïd had fled abroad, with police cautioning that \\"beyond his charisma and aura, beyond the folklore, [Faïd] is a dangerous individual.\\" Three weeks following his escape, Faïd narrowly avoided recapture after being spotted by police near Paris. On July 24, 2018, police identified Faïd as one of two people inside a car observing a service station. As they moved in, the suspects fled towards Sarcelles and managed to get away. The car was later found abandoned in a car park with plastic explosives inside. Prior to being apprehended, Faïd used a face-covering Islamic veil, (burqa) to move around in public spaces. Faïd was apprehended again in Creil on 3 October 2018, along with his brother and 2 other men. Weapons were seized during the police operation.  Media influence  Faïd has been influenced by American crime films such as Scarface, Reservoir Dogs and Heat. He reportedly once approached Michael Mann the director of Heat, at a Paris Film Festival and told him; \\"You were my technical adviser.\\" He has also been compared to French bank robber and serial prison escapee Jacques Mesrine (1936–1979), and has described Mesrine as one of his heroes.

The device allows measurement of the forward distance of the lateral orbital rim to the front of the cornea. Exophthalmometers can also identify enophthalmos (retraction of the eye into the orbit), a sign of blow-out fracture or certain neoplasms.  Methods  There are several types of exophthalmometers: Hertel and Luedde exophthalmometers measure the distance of the corneal apex from the level of the lateral orbital rim, while Naugle exophthalmometers measure the relative difference between each eye. * Hertel exophthalmometers take a measurement from the lateral orbital rim to the corneal apex. If a patient presents with an orbital fracture or after lateral orbitotomy, the use of a Hertel exophthalmometer may be complicated because the lateral orbital rim serves as a reference point for this instrument. Consideration should be given to the use of the Naugle exophthalmometer in these cases. * Naugle exophthalmometers use fixation points slightly above and below the superior and inferior orbital rims (cheek bones and forehead). Naugle exophthalmometers measure the difference in proptosis between the two eyes, in contrast to the absolute measure obtained with the Hertel method. * Luedde exophthalmometers fix on the lateral orbital wall and use a transparent ruler to measure the amount of protrusion.  Normal values  The normal range is 12–21 mm. Upper normal limit for people of African origin is a little higher, about 23–24 mm. A difference greater than 2 mm between the eyes is significant. In children and teenagers mean exophthalmometric measurements increase with age: Less than 4 years old (13.2 mm), 5–8 years old (14.4 mm), 9–12 years old (15.2 mm) and 13–17 years old (16.2 mm).

Under the theme \\"Buddha was born in Nepal\\", Lamichhane interviewed politicians, journalists and celebrities, and took phone calls from viewers. While he set the Guinness world record at over 62 hours in April 2013, the record has since been broken by Alexandru Raducanu of Romania who hosted an over 72-hour-long show. Lamichhane currently hosts a popular television show, Sidha Kura Janta Sangha (Straight Talk with the People) on the News24 Network. Career Rabi Lamichhane rose to fame as the host of a television show on the News24 Network aimed at setting the world record for longest marathon hosting of a television show. He selected the \\"Buddha was born in Nepal\\" in order to \\"help promote Nepal globally\\". The previous record was set by two Ukrainian presenters who stayed on the air for 52 hours in 2011. The record has since been broken by a Romanian presenter. Currently, he hosts Sidha Kura Janta Sanga on News 24 television. The show's format has Lamichhane providing an editorial monologue alongside reporting, primarily the kind of 'sting journalism' pioneered by the Indian news magazine Tehelka. Lamichhane follows up on complaints from ordinary people, chiefly victims of fraud or corruption, and confronts the alleged perpetrators on camera. The show has been described as also \\"unapologetically nationalist, at times simplistic in its coverage of complex issues,\\" and creating \\"a cult of personality around its host\\".  Controversy  While Lamichhane has become a popular journalist in Nepal, there are some who have raised questions about his style of journalism and the \\"cult of personality\\" that has sprung up around him. While his methods have borne results for the ordinary people on whose behalf he pursues cases of fraud and corruption, critics have pointed to his \\"nationalist posturing\\" and \\"simplistic story lines\\". On 15 August 2019, police arrested Lamichhane from his News 24 office in connection with the suicide of journalist Shalikram Pudasaini. In a video recorded before his death, Pudasaini, who had also worked for News24, had named Lamichhane, among others, as driving him to suicide. Chitwan police charged Lamichhane along with two others with abetment of suicide. His arrest provoked widespread protest rallies in his support across the country with thousands of young people taking to the streets in Chitwan. Protestors saw Lamichhane's arrest as an attempt to stifle his journalism and as retaliation for his exposure of corruption in the state. Lamichhane was released on Rs 500,000 bail a few days later. The case is currently pending at the Chitwan District Court.

In 1611 he was appointed to High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, a post that his grandfather, the elder John Isham, had held 30 years before. Wealthy and successful, Isham became a member of the aristocracy when Charles I on 30 May 1627 created him the first hereditary Baronet of Lamport. The title was probably purchased, as both Charles I and James I before him had used baronetcies as a means of raising funds, first for the settlement and pacification of Northern Ireland and later for the settlement of Nova Scotia in the Colonies. Sir John Isham died on 8 July 1651 in Lamport, and was buried there with his wife (who had died in 1625). The title of baronet subsequently passed down to his only son Justinian Isham. His daughter Elizabeth Isham is known for her diary, which is one of the earliest known examples of an autobiography written by a woman.

She was Miss Jamaica World 1973, and the second runner-up in the Miss World pageant that same year. Early life Yuen was born to a Hakka Chinese Jamaican family in Kingston. She began playing tennis while in school. She studied marketing management in Miami, Florida. In 1973, she was 21 years old and working as a salesgirl. Pageant wins Yuen entered the Miss Jamaica pageant that year, breaking an \\"informal colour line\\" which had seen women of Chinese descent voluntarily restricting themselves from participation in such events. On 5 August 1973, she was named the pageant's winner. She went on to a third-place finish in the Miss World 1973 pageant behind Evangeline Pascual of the Philippines and Marjorie Wallace, the pageant's first American winner. However, Wallace was fired from the Miss World duties after the pageant; organisers extended an offer to Pascual to complete the duties of Miss World for the remainder of the year, but without holding the title; when Pascual turned down that offer, organisers next turned to Yuen, who accepted. During the course of her duties, she expressed concern that \\"winners find themselves coping with financial commitments out of their reach\\". Yuen's strong showing in the Miss World pageant elevated her to the status of a national hero in Jamaica, but also exposed her to controversy. While Yuen was growing up, the Chinese Benevolent Association had held annual Miss Chinese Jamaican pageants, but such \\"openly racialised\\" events ceased in 1962 after charges from Afro-Jamaican journalists that the ethnic pride on display there was \\"unpatriotic\\" and \\"un-Jamaican\\". After her win, she was forced into the awkward position of strenuously denying any connection to her Chinese heritage so that she would not \\"disrupt the official picture of the country's identity\\", going as far as to make public proclamations that she preferred Jamaican national dishes like ackee and saltfish and entirely disliked Chinese cuisine. Two years later, Jamaica withdrew from participation in Miss World and Miss Universe events amidst public complaints that black contestants faced discrimination from judges and a lack of coverage by British news media. Later career Yuen herself went on to become a partner in Manufacturing Company, Ltd., where she worked as a costume designer; she won the Distinguished Salesman of the Year award from the Kingston Gleaner in 1974. She later married fellow Chinese Jamaican Warwick Lyn, a reggae producer best known as the protégé of Leslie Kong, and emigrated to the United States with him. There, she was the organiser of the Miss Jamaica Miami beauty pageant. She would later return to Jamaica, where she worked as a manager for American Airlines in Montego Bay.. Ms. Yuen is currently a Senior Manager for Premium Services of Miami and Latin America for American Airlines based in Miami, Florida. She is overseeing the expansion of the Admirals Club, and opening of Flagship First Dining and Flagship Lounge in MIA.

He was the showrunner for the first season of the Netflix series Stranger Things and the co-creator of the TV series Last Resort with Shawn Ryan. They were both also executive producers for the series. Gajdusek also wrote for the series Dead Like Me and wrote the film Trespass (2011). He co-wrote the screenplay for the 2013 Tom Cruise movie, Oblivion, and The November Man, which was released in 2014. Early life Karl Gajdusek was born in 1968 in San Francisco, California, United States. Career Film Gajdusek's first professional break came through an option by independent producer Jeff Young for his screenplay Widow's Walk. Although the film would never be produced, Young's attempts to get the film made landed Gajdusek with his first agent. Gajdusek's next film, Higher was developed with director James Foley and later with director John McNaughton. For a period of time, Gajdusek teamed with screenwriter Michael Finch. Together they sold a number of pitches to various buyers including two to WWE Films. Their script based on the Bill Granger's The November Man novel, There Are No Spies, titled The November Man, first developed in 2009, began shooting in Belgrade in 2013 with Pierce Brosnan starring in the lead role. The film would finally premiere in 2014. Meanwhile, Gajdusek wrote a solo feature script, Pandora, redefining him as a darker dramatic writer. After doing uncredited work on The Mechanic and the Liam Neeson film Unknown, Gajdusek wrote Trespass for Irwin Winkler which was released in 2011. Also in 2011, Gajdusek began work on two projects which would shape the direction of his career. The first was a screenplay based on the Rick Remender and Greg Toocchini graphic novel The Last Days of American Crime. Gajdusek claims it as one of his favorite pieces of writing. Director Olivier Megaton came on board in 2018 and the film will premier on Netflix in 2019. Also in 2011, Gajdusek began work on a rewrite of the Joe Kosinski directed Oblivion. Gajdusek would work for almost a year on the film, through the casting of Tom Cruise and the switch from Disney Pictures to Universal Studios. Oblivion premiered in March 2013. In 2016, Gajdusek sold an original science fiction epic, Courage, to 20th Century Fox where it caught the attention of director Matthew Vaughan who became attached to direct. This partnership led to Gajdusek writing the script for a prequel in Vaughn's Kingsman franchise. That film wrapped shooting in May, 2019. Television Gajdusek landed his first job in television as a story editor on the second season of the Showtime series Dead Like Me. For Dead Like Me Gajdusek wrote on four episodes: \\"Haunted\\", \\"Death Defying\\", \\"Rites of Passage\\", and \\"The Shallow End\\". After the cancellation of the series, Gajdusek returned to screenwriting until he paired with Shawn Ryan in 2011 to co-create the ABC television series Last Resort which ran on ABC for a season in 2012. In June, 2013, Gajdusek began to develop a science fiction television epic, The Spark for HBO. In August 2013, Gajdusek re-teamed with the Last Resort team of Shawn Ryan, Sony Pictures Television, and ABC to announce a new show, Freedom, about the rise of a hacktivist collective on the campus of an elite university. While Freedom did not survive at ABC, in 2014 Gajdusek paired with novelist Gary Shteyngart to adapt his novel Super Sad True Love Story into a television series with the production company MRC. In early 2015 this project was announced along with the attachment of Ben Stiller to direct many of the episodes. In 2015, Gajdusek came on to the Netflix series Stranger Things as showrunner of the first season. In early 2016 it was announced that Super Sad True Love Story had been purchased by Showtime with Gajdusek and Shteyngart both as creators and executive producers.

It took place on September 16, 2011, at Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan, State of Mexico. The event title referred to the main event match, a steel cage match that featured male wrestlers, female wrestlers, Exótico wrestlers and Mini-Estrellas all competing against each other. The last person in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask, or if already unmask have their hair shaved off under the Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, rules. Production Background Starting as far back as at least 2000, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. Starting in 2011 IWRG began holding a special version of the steel cage match concept under the name Guerra de Sexos, or \\"War of the Sexes\\", as they held a show centered on an inter-gender steel cage match main event that saw men and women fight each other with their mask or hair on the line. At times IWRG also included Mini-Estrella competitors and Exótico wrestlers in the cage as well. The inter-gender aspects of the show distinguishes the Guerra de Sexos events from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\"), IWRG Guerra del Golfo (\\"Gulf War\\") or IWRG Prison Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The Guerra de Sexos shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2011 Guerra de Sexos show was the first year IWRG promoted a show under that name. Storylines The event featured four professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

It was written by Julia Brownell and directed by Mimi Leder. The episode premiered on NBC on April 13, 2013, the eleventh episode of Season 2. As Tom and Julia race to ready Bombshell for previews, Tom's eagerness to prove himself may not be the best thing for the show. An on-stage mishap forces Ivy to make an important decision, while tension rises at Hit List as Karen becomes suspicious of Derek's motives towards her.  Plot  Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) has a nightmare of being unprepared and naked at the opening of Bombshell, then waking to find Ellis (Jaime Cepero) in bed with him. He then actually awakens, screaming, which brings Julia Houston (Debra Messing) who reminds him that it is the day of the invitation-only dress rehearsal for friends and family. Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) wakes up in bed with Derek Wills (Jack Davenport). She says she wants to keep things between them casual. Jimmy Collins (Jeremy Jordan) has been up for several days writing new songs for the new material that Kyle Bishop (Andy Mientus) and Julia came up with for Hit List. Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) is worried about him and questions if he took anything stronger than Red Bull and caffeine. He's worried that if he doesn't write new songs for the expanded Diva character, Derek will give some of Karen's songs to the character. The Bombshell dress rehearsal has multiple technical mistakes. At the end of the \\"Our Little Secret\\" number, Simon (Julian Ovenden) as JFK accidentally removes Ivy's slip along with her dress, exposing Ivy's naked body. Producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston) thinks maybe a little nudity will help Bombshell and Tom and Julia feel that it has significant artistic merit. Tom talks to Ivy about it. She's not fully against it but she asks for time to think about it. Eileen wants to cancel the next day's first preview because of all the technical problems, but Tom is afraid he'll be seen as an unfit director. Eileen agrees to let the preview go on as scheduled if Tom can fix all the problems by 3 pm. Ultimately, Tom is successful after Julia comes up with an idea to allow time to set up the prop plane on stage for Act II; the number \\"Dig Deep\\" starts in the audience and is performed in front of the stage instead of on it, so the intermission can end while the set is still being moved. During \\"Our Little Secret,\\" Ivy keeps her slip on; Tom and Julia are disappointed. But in the next scene, where Marilyn objects to JFK leaving her immediately after their tryst, Ivy drops a bedsheet from her body, exposing herself to him when she asks him to stay. The choice is a success. Sam Strickland (Leslie Odom, Jr.), who was passed over in favor of a different swing when a cast member was injured in the dress rehearsal, tells Tom that he feels Bombshell is a step backwards for him, and that he doesn't want to work for Tom; he leaves the show. Meanwhile, at Hit List, Jimmy, Karen, and Derek squabble, with Jimmy and Karen afraid that Derek is mad at Karen for turning him down and believe he is threatening to take songs away from her, while Derek is struggling with feeling like he is losing his passion for the show. He talks to Julia about it and she understands since she went through the same thing with Bombshell after she and Michael Swift broke up. She suggests that he tamp down his feelings for Karen and run through the show to find some part of it to be passionate about again. He tells the cast they are doing a run-through before the New York Times critic Richard Francis (Jamey Sheridan) comes to see it later. As they do the run-through, Derek has an idea for a new opening that will present the rest of the show as a flashback. He walks the cast though it, with Ana Vargas (Krysta Rodriguez) as the Diva shooting a victim whose identity is not yet revealed. She sings part of \\"Broadway, Here I Come\\" a cappella as she advances with the gun. Karen is upset that Ana has been given her song, which she loves. Even though her character Amanda still sings the full version of the song, Karen argues that it will no longer be Amanda's signature song. Jimmy accuses Derek of punishing them for being together. Scott (Jesse L. Martin) intervenes and asks Kyle for his opinion on Derek's changes and Kyle sides with Derek. Jimmy and Kyle argue about it later, but Kyle tells Jimmy to stop being selfish. Jimmy apologizes and they make up. Ana is excited about her expanded role as the Diva but Karen insensitively tells Ana that Derek only gave her the song because he's upset with Karen, and he'll likely give it back to her later. Ana is upset and tells Karen that she has tried to think of Karen as the star and herself as supporting Karen, but only now realizes that Karen truly feels the same way about their relationship. After the Bombshell preview, the group is celebrating together and Tom searches the internet for early reviews. He discovers Richard has written a NY Times piece comparing Bombshell to Hit List, in that both pieces being about women reinventing themselves for fame. He says Bombshell's perspective is from the past while Hit List is a modern piece that looks to the future and could itself be Broadway bound. The article also mentions Julia's association with Hit List. Tom, previously unaware of this, becomes livid and storms out of the restaurant. Later, Eileen meets with Richard and tells him she doesn't want to see him right now. Karen confronts Derek about his behavior, and he tells her what he knows about Jimmy's background, including information that came to light in the course of the Times fact-checking their article: Jimmy uses a false social security number and name, borrowed a large amount of money from him, and is a drug user. Karen later tells Jimmy she wants to know about his life and especially what he hasn't told her. He declines and Karen tells him they are through until he opens up to her. Ivy finds Derek waiting for her at her apartment and she invites him to stay the night. As Ana leaves the theater, Jimmy's old drug dealer Adam (David Call) approaches her and claims to be an old friend of Jimmy's; his motives are unclear. Production There were four songs featured in the episode, all reprises of original songs. The show's in-house songwriters Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman wrote the reprised \\"Let Me Be Your Star\\", \\"Our Little Secret\\", and \\"Dig Deep\\", while Joe Iconis wrote the reprised \\"Broadway, Here I Come\\". All four songs were previously released, \\"Broadway, Here I Come\\" as a single and the others on the cast album Bombshell. Critical reception Hilary Busis of Entertainment Weekly said of the episode, \\"As the old superstition goes, a bad dress rehearsal all but guarantees a great opening night. And if the opposite also happens to be true, I would keep expectations low for next week's Smash -- because tonight's episode, \\"The Dress Rehearsal,\\" was season 2's best by far. The main reason: For the most part, its plot focused on backstage intrigue rather than dull relationship drama—and when the latter did intrude upon the former, the result was more than just a bunch of people yelling at each other.\\"Entertainment Weekly, April 14, 2013, \\"Smash recap: 'The Dress Rehearsal'\\" Sara Brady of Television Without Pity gave the episode a B- rating.http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/smash/the-dress-rehearsal.php  References   External links  * \\"The Dress Rehearsal\\" at the Internet Movie Database * \\"The Dress Rehearsal\\" at TV.com * \\"The Dress Rehearsal\\" at TVLine Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Smash (TV series) episodes ","title":"The Dress Rehearsal"},{"id":"39105515","title":"2013 Sudirman Cup"},{"id":"39105546","text":"Yvonne Kroonenberg (born 31 May 1950) is a Dutch psychologist and author.

It established cooperation, albeit inharmonious, between the two and served as a basis for joint defense against Serb forces. It also placed the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) under the command of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). Izetbegović, who had hoped to prevent Bosnia and Herzegovina from falling under the influence of Croatia or Serbia, signed the agreement after Stjepan Kljuić, president of the Croatian Democratic Union's (HDZ) branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was replaced by Tuđman with Mate Boban, who blocked the delivery of supplies to Sarajevo where a siege was under way and had proclaimed an independent Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia (HR-HB). The agreement fell apart in October after a number of events including the assassination of Blaž Kraljević, leader of Croatian Defence Forces (HOS) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the fall of the areas of Posavina, Bosanski Brod, and Jajce into the hands of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS), and after a major battle broke out between the HVO and the ARBiH in Prozor. Preparation for war Serb-held territory in the former Yugoslavia, July 1992 In 1990 and 1991, Serbs in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina had proclaimed a number of \\"Serbian Autonomous Regions\\" with the intent of later unifying them to create a Greater Serbia. Serbs used the well equipped Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) in defending these territories. As early as September or October 1990, the JNA had begun arming Bosnian Serbs and organizing them into militias. By March 1991, the JNA had distributed an estimated 51,900 firearms to Serb paramilitaries and 23,298 firearms to Serbian Democratic Party (SDS). The Croatian government began arming Croats in the Herzegovina region in 1991 and in the start of 1992, expecting that the Serbs would spread the war into Bosnia and Herzegovina. It also helped arm the Bosniak community. From July 1991 to January 1992, the JNA and Serb paramilitaries used Bosnian territory to wage attacks on Croatia. On 25 March 1991, Franjo Tuđman met with Serbian president Slobodan Milošević in Karađorđevo, reportedly to discuss partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In November, the autonomous Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia (HZ-HB) was established, it claimed it had no secessionary goal and that it would serve a \\"legal basis for local self-administration\\". It vowed to respect the Bosnian government under the condition that Bosnia and Herzegovina was independent of \\"the former and every kind of future Yugoslavia.\\" In December, Tuđman, in a conversation with Bosnian Croat leaders, said that \\"from the perspective of sovereignty, Bosnia-Herzegovina has no prospects\\" and recommended that Croatian policy \\"support for the sovereignty [of Bosnia and Herzegovina] until such time as it no longer suits Croatia.\\" In April 1992, the siege of Sarajevo began, by which time the Bosnian Serb-formed Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) controlled 70% of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 8 April, Bosnian Croats were organized into the Croatian Defence Council (HVO). A sizable number of Bosniaks also joined. The Croatian Defence Forces (HOS), led by Blaž Kraljević in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which \\"supported Bosnian territorial integrity much more consistently and sincerely than the HVO\\" was also created. On 15 April 1992, the multi-ethnic Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) was formed, with slightly over two-thirds of troops consisting of Bosniaks and almost one-third of Croats and Serbs. In the winter Bosniaks began leaving the HVO and joining the ARBiH which also began receiving supplies from Croatia. In May, HVO Major General Ante Roso declared that the only \\"legal military force\\" in HZ-HB was the HVO and that \\"all orders from the TO [Territorial Defense] command [of Bosnia and Herzegovina] are invalid, and are to be considered illegal on this territory\\". Pressure and agreement The Croatian government played a \\"double game\\" in Bosnia and Herzegovina and \\"a military solution required Bosnia as an ally, but a diplomatic solution required Bosnia as a victim\\". Tuđman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party held important positions in the Bosnian government including the premiership and the ministry of defence, but despite this carried out a separate policy and refused for the HVO to be integrated into ARBiH. Jerko Doko, the Bosnian defence minister, gave the HVO priority in the acquisition of military weapons. In January 1992, Tuđman had arranged for Stjepan Kljuić, president of the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH) who favored cooperating with the Bosniaks towards a unified Bosnian state, to be ousted and replaced by Mate Boban, who favored Croatia to annex Croat-inhabited parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A rift existed in the party between Croats from ethnically mixed areas of central and northern Bosnia and those from Herzegovina. Milivoj Gagro, prewar Croat mayor of Mostar and ally of Kljuić said: \\"The secessionist policy [union with Croatia] was consistently supported by the Herzegovina side, not by Sarajevo, Posavina, or Central Bosnia Croats. [...] Croats from Central Bosnia and Posavina, as well as those from urban centers who lived with Muslims and Serbs, thought differently. But when the war picked up, Posavina Croats were attacked, Sarajevo was surrounded [...] Kljuić was sidelined and Boban came in with idea [the Croat separatist idea] in this area. [...] When they [Croats in Sarajevo as well as Northern and Central Bosnia] felt they could not survive any more they lifted their hands and accepted their fate. And the Herzegovina Croats promised them the stars in the sky and told them \\"come here and we will give you a place.\\" And what happened? It resulted in an exodus. And all these miserable Croat refugee communities that look absolutely ugly.\\" Izetbegović came under intense pressure from Tuđman to agree for Bosnia and Herzegovina to be in a confederation with Croatia; however, Izetbegović wanted to prevent Bosnia and Herzegovina from coming under the influence of Croatia or Serbia. Because doing so would cripple reconciliation between Bosniaks and Serbs, make the return of Bosniak refugees to eastern Bosnia impossible and for other reasons, Izetbegović opposed. He received an ultimatum from Boban warning that if he did not proclaim a confederation with Tuđman that Croatian forces would not help defend Sarajevo from strongholds as close as away. On 9 May, Boban, Josip Manolić, Tuđman's aide and previously the Croatian Prime Minister, and Radovan Karadžić, president of the self-proclaimed Republika Srpska, secretly met in Graz and formed an agreement on the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Graz agreement. Beginning in June, discussions between Bosniaks and Croats over military cooperation and possible merger of their armies started to take place. The Croatian government recommended moving ARBiH headquarters out of Sarajevo and closer to Croatia and pushed for its reorganization in an effort to heavily add Croatian influence. In June and July, Boban increased pressure \\"by blocking delivery of arms that the Sarajevo government, working around a United Nations embargo on all shipments to the former Yugoslavia, has secretly bought.\\" On 3 July, Boban declared the independence of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia (HR-HB). He was established as its president. It claimed power over its own police, army, currency, and education and extended its grasp to many districts where Bosniaks were the majority. It only allowed a Croat flag to be used, the only currency allowed was the Croatian kuna, its only official language was Croatian, and a Croat school curriculum was enacted. Mostar, a town where Bosniaks constituted a slight majority, was set as the capital. There was no mention on the defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina's territorial integrity. On 21 July, Izetbegović and Tuđman signed the \\"Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation between the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia\\" in Zagreb, Croatia. The agreement allowed them to \\"cooperate in opposing [the Serb] aggression\\" and coordinate military efforts. It placed the HVO under the command of the ARBiH. Cooperation was inharmonious, but enabled the transportation of weapons to ARBiH through Croatia in spite of the UN sanctioned arms embargo, reopening channels blocked by Boban. It established \\"economic, financial, cultural, educational, scientific and religious cooperation\\" between the signatories. It also stipulated that Bosnian Croats hold dual citizenship for both Bosnia and Herzegovina and for Croatia. This was criticized as Croatian attempts at \\"claiming broader political and territorial rights in the parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina where large numbers of Croats live\\". After its signature Boban vowed to Izetbegović that HR-HB would remain an integral part of Bosnia and Herzegovina when the war ended. Aftermath In the summer of 1992, the HVO started to purge its Bosniak members. At the same time armed incidents started to occur among Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina between the HVO and the HOS. The HOS was loyal to the Bosnian government and accepted subordination to the Staff of the ARBiH of which Kraljević was appointed a member. On 9 August, Kraljević and eight of his staff were assassinated by HVO soldiers under the command of Mladen Naletilić, who supported a split between Croat and Bosniaks, after Kraljević's HOS attacked the VRS near Trebinje. The HOS's advance into eastern Herzegovina and occupation of Trebinje angered Boban who had affirmed to Karadžić that Croat forces were uninterested in the region. The HOS was disbanded, leaving the HVO as the only Croat force. Bosnian officials suspected that Tuđman's government was involved. According to Manolić the order to kill Kraljević was given by Šušak and approved by Tuđman. Božidar Vučurević, the war-time mayor of Trebinje, stated he safeguarded records showing that SDS and HDZ figures considered it a \\"task\\" that need to be carried out. In late September, Izetbegović and Tuđman met again and attempted to create military coordination against the VRS, but to no avail. By October, the agreement had collapsed and afterwards Croatia diverted delivery of weaponry to Bosnia and Herzegovina by seizing a significant amount for itself. Boban had abandoned a Bosnian government alliance and ceased all hostilities with Karadžić. The dominant Croatian–Bosnian defense of Posavina fell apart after Tuđman and/or Gojko Šušak ordered the withdrawal of the Croatian Army (HV), enabling the Serbs to gain control of the corridor and connect their captured territories in western and eastern Bosnia. On 8 October, the town of Bosanski Brod was abandoned by the HVO and left to the VRS. By that time, the HV and the HVO had sustained approximately 7,500 casualties, out of 20,000 troops committed to the battle to control Posavina. The pullout appeared to be a quid pro quo for the JNA withdrawal from Dubrovnik's hinterland that took place in July. Still, a Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that there is no direct evidence of such arrangements. On 9 October, the HVO signed a cease-fire with the VRS in Jajce in exchange for providing electricity. The strained relations escalated rapidly and led to an armed clash between the two forces in Novi Travnik on 18 October. Low-scale conflicts spread in the region, and the two forces engaged each other along the supply route to Jajce three days later, on 21 October, as a result of an ARBiH roadblock set up the previous day on authority of the \\"Coordinating Committee for the Protection of Muslims\\" rather than the ARBiH command. Just as the roadblock was dismantled, a new skirmish occurred in the town of Vitez the following day. On 29 October, the VRS captured Jajce due to the inability of ARBiH and HVO forces to construct a cooperative defense, against the VRS which held the advantage in troop size and firepower, staff work and planning was significantly superior to the defenders of Jajce. Six days prior the first major battle in the impending Croat–Bosniak war broke out when the HVO pushed ARBiH from Prozor and expelled the Bosniak population after carrying out rapes, attacking the local mosque, and torching the property of Bosniaks. Initial reports indicated about 300 Bosniaks were killed or wounded in the attack, but subsequent reports by the ARBiH made in November 1992 indicated eleven soldiers and three civilians were killed. Another ARBiH report, prepared in March 1993, revised the numbers saying eight civilians and three ARBiH soldiers were killed, while 13 troops and 10 civilians were wounded.

From such a chart may be read the axial and radial cylindrical coordinates of that point in reciprocal space which corresponds to any particular X-ray reflection.Singh, J., \\"Dictionary of Physics\\", APH Publishing Corp., New Delhi (2005), p.78 When a single crystal is examined in an X-ray diffractometer such that the diffraction intensity is measured cylindrically around the crystal, it is convenient to use cylindrical coordinates to define the reciprocal lattice vectors and their terminal points. Different order reflections will be coaxial with the axis of rotation. These reflections are recorded as spots which lie on parallel lines known as layer lines. A reciprocal lattice vector can be represented by two mutually perpendicular vectors \\\\zeta (along the rotation axis) and \\\\xi in the horizontal plane (the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis) containing the X-ray beam. The third parameter specifying the reciprocal lattice vector is the angle \\\\phi formed by the X-ray beam and the plane containing \\\\zeta and \\\\xi. The vertical coordinate \\\\zeta has a special significance, since all the reciprocal lattice points which have a constant \\\\zeta value lie in the plane normal to the rotation axis. Such a plane corresponds to the oscillation line on the oscillation(rotation) photograph. Thus a layer line is characterized by a particular value \\\\zeta. The zeroth layer line has \\\\zeta = 0 (i.e., the equatorial layer line), the first layer line has \\\\zeta = \\\\zeta_1 and the second layer line has \\\\zeta = \\\\zeta_2, and so on. Alternatively the reciprocal lattice points lie a long a cylinder with a constant \\\\xi value whose axis is coincident with the rotation axis. If the crystal is mounted on the c-axis then the layer lines are related to the repeat distance along this axis. If H is the layer separation distance and R is the radius of the detector then \\\\frac{H}{R} = \\\\tan(\\\\mu) where \\\\mu is the layer line angle.Tareen, J. and Kutty, T., \\"A Basic Course in Crystallography\\", University Press (2001), p.160-1 Contours of constant \\\\zeta and \\\\xi are important in the interpretation of oscillation (rotation) measurements. A chart exhibiting such curves as they would appear on an X-ray photograph was first prepared by Bernal and is called a Bernal chart. The scale used in a given chart depends on the distance the detector is from the crystal. Historically, Bernal charts were provided in the form of transparencies so that they could be superimposed over X-ray photographic film which allowed the \\\\zeta and \\\\xi coordinates to be read directly from the film.Verma, A.R. and Srivastava, O.N., \\"Crystallography Applied to Solid State Physics\\", New Age International Limited, New Delhi (2005), p.369-70 See also * Greninger chart * John Desmond Bernal References Category:X-ray crystallography ","title":"Bernal chart"},{"id":"39105615","text":"Dark Glacier is in Wenatchee National Forest in the U.S. state of Washington, northwest of Bonanza Peak, the tallest non-volcanic peak in the Cascade Range.

It aired on Fox in the United States on April 14, 2013, and is written by Brian Scully and directed by Julius Wu. In the episode, Peter, Quagmire and Joe take a road trip to Canada, but their private plane crashes and Peter goes missing for two months. When his family finds him, he can no longer communicate intelligently. Plot Crossover cold opening The crossover consisted of American Dad!, King of the Hill, and Family Guy characters. It starts in Quahog when the Griffins visit their new neighbors, the Smiths (from American Dad!), living in Cleveland's old house. Peter is then shot by Stan Smith for revealing Roger's identity to Quagmire. Peter then wakes up in his bed and discovered it was a dream. At that moment, Hank walks into the bedroom questioning, \\"Hey, Lois, what's that fat man doing in our bed?\\" Next, the scene cuts to Hank waking up in his bed saying, \\"Ugh, damn it, I always wake up before I find out if they can understand the baby!\\" The episode opens with a King of the Hill-styled opening involving Quagmire, Peter, Joe, and Brian replacing Boomhauer, Hank, Bill, and Dale at their respective spots in \\"The Alley\\". Main plot Quagmire asks the guys to come along with him on a trip to some Montreal strip clubs (Peter says he's always wanted to go there, but says he couldn't because South Park already went there). Quagmire asks that they lie about where they are going in order to keep the wives from complaining to him about going to strip clubs. On the private luxury plane Quagmire acquires by \\"catching John Travolta with not Kelly Preston\\", Peter reenacts The Twilight Zone episode \\"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet\\", opening a door and causing the plane to crash in the Canadian wilderness. They build shelter and settle in for the night. Thanks to one of Peter's animal traps, Quagmire's legs get broken. With Peter the only able-bodied person left, he sets out to find help. But just after he leaves, they find out that they crashed into a Canadian's back yard. Quagmire worries about Peter, but he has already disappeared into the woods as confirmed by the Predator that had been watching them. Two months later, the Search and Rescue Party nearly gives up the search when signs of Peter start to turn up. The family rushes to where Peter left a doll of Edna Garrett from The Facts of Life (though Chris also reminds everyone that Edna Garrett was first seen in Diff'rent Strokes) and find him in the bushes acting like a nonspeaking feral beast with long hair, a long beard, a partially muddy body, and wearing what's left of his underwear. Getting Peter home, they try to reintroduce him to his life. Lois then shows Peter a video that he made before he became feral. When it comes to the second tape, the Peter on that tape tells Peter not to listen to the Peter on the first video since that Peter is lying and tells Peter to be free as he runs out of the house. Stewie tries to make the best of things by singing with Peter where he grunts to the tunes of \\"War\\" and \\"Baby Got Back.\\" Lois awakes to find Peter in the garbage. Quagmire and Joe come over to check on things and find that every attempt to re-civilize Peter did not go well. The Griffin family decides to return Peter to the wild to be happy. As Lois and the family cries at their departure, Peter heads off towards the woods. But when Meg says goodbye, Peter struggles to tell Meg to shut up and slowly regains his speech. Peter and Lois embrace, he then tells her \\"Jim. Your name is Jim\\" (an allusion to the end of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock). At home and returned to normal in only a day, Peter announces that Quagmire is taking him to a strip club in Montreal to celebrate Peter returning to normal. At the strip club, Peter is surprised to see Charlotte Rae (the actress who portrayed Edna Garrett) as a stripper. Reception The episode received a 2.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic and was watched by a total of 5.02 million viewers. This made it the most watched show on Fox's Animation Domination line-up that night, beating The Simpsons, American Dad!, Bob's Burgers and The Cleveland Show. The episode was met with mixed reviews from critics. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C, saying \\"Bigfat\\" is one of those consistently funny episodes brought down by too much Meg-bashing. Mark Trammell of TV Equals said \\"All in all, a good but not great episode that had the makings of a classic, but faltered in the end. If you’re a fan of the older style of \\"Family Guy\\" humor, you’ll at least want to see the first bit of the episode, but be forewarned, it doesn’t get any better than that.\\" Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode three out of five stars, saying \\"Peter going feral didn't really last long enough, nor had any great comic consequences. It just wasn't nearly as funny as it could or should have been, minus perhaps Peter getting his humanity back by way of wanting Meg to shut up. It all felt like an extremely-missed opportunity. It was all half-baked. Survival was a theme in the Family Guy Season 11 premiere. Most of the jokes felt like lazy references that should have gone further than they did. None of the plot threads were given any room to develop. This could have been a lot better than it turned out to be, but instead was just mostly mediocre. Still, it had the King of the Hill homage, which justified the whole half-hour.\\" References External links * Bigfat at Family Guy Wiki * * Category:2013 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 11) episodes Category:Crossover animation ","title":"Bigfat"},{"id":"39105705","text":"Elite Grand Hotel is a five-star hotel located on Old Mahabalipuram Road in Semmencherry, Chennai, India.

The species was first described from a series of isolated fossil seeds in chert. History and classification Torreya clarnensis has been identified from a single location in the Clarno Formation, the Clarno nut beds, type locality for both the formation and the species. The nut beds are approximately east of the unincorporated community of Clarno, Oregon and currently considered to be middle Eocene in age, based on averaging zircon fission track radiometric dating which yielded an age of 43.6 and 43.7 ± 10 million years ago and Argon–argon dating radiometric dating which yielded a 36.38 ± 1.31 to 46.8 ± 3.36 mya date. The average of the dates resulted in an age range of 45 to 43 mya. The beds are composed of silica and calcium carbonate cemented tuffaceous sandstones, siltstones, and conglomerates which preserve either a lake delta environment, or alternatively periodic floods and volcanic mudflows preserved with hot spring activity. The species was described from a series of type specimens, the holotype specimen UF6510, which is currently preserved in the paleobotanical collections of the University of Florida and two paratype specimens, both of which are part of the National Museum of Natural History collections in Washington, D.C.. The fossils were part of approximately 20,000 specimens collected from 1942 to 1989 by Thomas Bones, A. W. Hancock, R. A. Scott, Steven R. Manchester, and a number of high school students. The Torreya clarnensis specimens were studied by paleobotanist Steven R. Manchester of the University of Florida. He published his 1994 type description for T. masonii in the Journal Palaeontographica Americana. The specific epithet clarnensis was chosen in recognition of the type locality, the Clarno Formation. Description The seeds of Torreya clarnensis are fusiform and bilaterally symmetrical with a pointed tip and base. The seeds have an overall length raging between and a width between . The seeds are identified as from a Torreya species by several features of the exterior morphology. The overall cross section shape is obovate, with an acutely rounded base where an aril would have attached, a keeled apex, and a pair of vascular scars near the tip. The seeds have a pair of vascular pores positioned on the upper and lower surfaces approximately one third of the way below the apex. The apical area of the seed is defined by a keel created by the edges of the upper and lower faces.

Chemonics reportedly earned contracts valued at $97 million in 1997 and $58 million in 1998. The company received US$15 million from the USAID between 1996 and 2003. In mid-2002, the company was awarded a $2.9 million contract to hire 3,000 locals to repair acequia and roads in Afghanistan's Shomali Plain. In Haiti, during the 2000s, Chemonics worked on agriculture programs, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network, and the \\"WINNER\\" project, which promotes the farming of Jatropha curcas to serve as biofuel. In 2008, an audit by USAID's Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that the results of Chemonics' $62 million contract in Afghanistan \\"fell considerably short\\" of the intended impact, and buildings constructed by subcontractors had significant construction defects. Chemonics said the audit \\"provided an incomplete picture\\". During the 2000s, Ashraf Rizk was president and CEO prior to Richard Dreiman. Chemonics ranked number 70 in Washington Technology 2009 list of the \\"top 100\\" largest government contractors based on revenue for the 2008 fiscal year and had approximately 3,200 employees at the time. 2010s Chemonics ranked number 51 in Washington Technology \\"top 100\\" list in 2010. The following year, Chemonics became 100 percent employee-owned through its employee stock ownership program. The U.S. Department of Labor charged the company with discrimination against qualified African-American job candidates. As part of the settlement, Chemonics agreed to pay nearly $500,000 in damages to 124 job applicants, hired eight of the candidates, corrected hiring software problems, and implemented a diversity program. The company also agreed to sponsor four or more diversity events organized by nonprofit groups and create a training program for local high school students as part of the Summer Youth Employment Program. Chemonics managed to deny liability as part of the settlement and attributed the pattern of discrimination to a manual application system. In 2012, Chemonics came under scrutiny by USAID's OIG for their work in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Chemonics was the largest single recipient of post-earthquake funds from USAID, receiving over $196 million in contracts, many of which were \\"no-bid\\". Audits specifically cited Chemonics lack of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan and that \\"some of the performance indicators Chemonics developed were not well- defined.\\" Chemonics also spent more than 75 percent of program budgets on material and equipment when an expenditure of only 30 percent was planned. Chemonics responded, saying that reports, assessments, and the final third- party evaluation of USAID's earthquake recovery program revealed that claims of failure in Haiti were exaggerated. An Inspector General's report also found that local communities were not sufficiently involved with Chemonics' work and stated \\"Chemonics used contractors from Port-au-Prince to implement a number of activities in Cap-Haitien and Saint-Marc; these contractors brought their own people to do the jobs instead of hiring locals.\\" When locals were required by USAID, Chemonics' policies \\"limited the transparency of the selection process and increase the risk of corruption or favoritism by granting decision-making authority to a few individuals.\\" Chemonics responded, stating that more than 90 percent of the staff on USAID's two largest Chemonics- implemented programs were Haitian and that the company had awarded $96.3 million in grants and subcontracts directly to Haitian organizations over a five year period. Chemonics received USAID funding in early 2014 to operate the Sindh Reading Programme to improve literacy in Sindh, Pakistan. The company had received $501.7 million from USAID by November 2014. Chemonics worked with USAID to help three coastal cities in Mozambique adapt to climate change. As part of the work, Chemonics and USAID constructed model homes to teach residents about low-cost solutions to protect homes during storms. Through USAID, Chemonics has supported the White Helmets, a volunteer organization formed during the Syrian Civil War and operating in parts of rebel-controlled Syria and in Turkey. Funding from USAID and the Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta allowed Chemonics to operate the Strengthening Advocacy and Civic Engagement governance project in Nigeria from 2014 to 2018. In 2015, USAID awarded Chemonics a $9.5 billion, eight-year IDIQ contract, the agency's largest award to date. The contract funds health supply chain programs to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. In 2017, Devex reported that only 7 percent of the health commodity shipments delivered through the program arrived \\"on time and in full\\". Chemonics acknowledged the challenges, saying it undertook a \\"foundational change,\\" by restructuring \\"how the project itself functioned from a management perspective\\". In Year 4, October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019, 85 percent of health commodity shipments were delivered on time and in full. During that same period the project procured nearly $544 million and delivered almost $699 million in drugs, diagnostics, and other health commodities. https://www.ghsupplychain.org/index.php/ghsc-psm-2019-annual-report USAID also awarded a $37 million contract for Chemonics to operate the \\"Promote\\" program in Afghanistan, which seeks to help women find employment in the civil society, private, and public sectors; in 2018, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction criticized USAID for results achieved to date. Expending nearly $90 million in taxpayer funding over three years, the program placed just 55 women in Afghan government jobs. In 2016, Chemonics launched the Blockchain for Development Solutions Lab, becoming the first U.S. international development company to develop blockchain technology. The lab aims to support financial inclusion and make business processes more efficient. Chemonics was the leading contractor for USAID in 2016. The firm ranked number 44 and number 28 in Washington Technology 2016 and 2017 lists of \\"Top 100 Contractors\\". The company ranked number 19 on Washington Technology \\"top 100\\" list in 2018 and reportedly earned contracts valued at $1.613 billion. It was awarded a 2018 Industry Innovator award for its Blockchain for Development Solutions Lab. Chemonics partnered with Arizona State University to incorporate minimasters programming into staff training and development. In 2018, the Council of the District of Columbia approved a $5.2 million property tax break for Chemonics' headquarters relocation, despite opposition by member Elissa Silverman who objected to the company's troubled history of discriminatory hiring. Two years later, construction began. 2020s In June 2020, Chemonics was added to the defendant's list of a lawsuit that was previously filed in December 2019 against six other companies, including DAI, Louis Berger, among others, for allegedly paying bribes, or protection money, to the Taliban in a lawsuit brought by families of American victims. This claim relates to whether Chemonics may have violated the Anti-Terrorism Act which makes it illegal for any individual or entity to provide material support to terrorist groups like the Taliban.

He previously played for the Penrith Panthers and the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles in the National Rugby League and the Warrington Wolves in the Super League. Background Hiku was born in Gisborne, New Zealand, and is of Māori descent. Hiku played his junior football for the Manurewa Marlins and represented the Counties Manukau Stingrays in the National Competition. Hiku played for the New Zealand Warriors' under-20s team in 2012, and had the second most metres gained during the 2012 NYC season behind teammate Ligi Sao. At the end of 2012, Hiku was named the New Zealand Warriors under-20s player of the year. On 13 October 2012, Hiku played for the Junior Kiwis against the Junior Kangaroos, playing off the interchange bench in the 48-16 loss. Playing career 2013 In 2013, Hiku (and long time Marlins and Warriors teammate Ligi Sao) left the Warriors and joined Sydney NRL club Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, playing mostly at for the Luke Williamson-coached Sea Eagles New South Wales Cup team. In Round 6 of the 2013 NRL season, Hiku made his NRL debut on the wing for the Sea Eagles in place of the injured David Williams against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks at Brookvale Oval, scoring a try on debut in Manly's 25-18 win. In his first game of NRL finals football in the 2013 season, in place of an injured Brett Stewart, Hiku was judged as man of the match despite Manly going down 4-0 to the 2013 minor premiers the Sydney Roosters at the Sydney Football Stadium. Hiku ran for a club record 297 metres on the night. Hiku later backed that up by running 231 in the following week's 24-18 semi-final win over Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks at the SFS. Hiku representing Manly in 2013 Stewart made a surprise return from injury in the preliminary final win over South Sydney and Hiku was considered unlucky to miss a place on the bench both against Souths and in Manly's grand final team which lost 26-18 to the Roosters. Hiku finished his debut year in the NRL as a “Mr Fix It” type player, mostly filling in for the injured Brett Stewart, playing in 13 matches and scoring 3 tries for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in the 2013 NRL season. 2014 As of Round 7 of the 2014 NRL season, Hiku had played in all seven games for the Sea Eagles following injuries to other players, though when Brett Stewart and winger Jorge Taufua returned to the side coach Geoff Toovey retained Hiku in place of the out of form David Williams. On 2 May 2014, Hiku played his first test for New Zealand when he played at fullback in their 30-18 loss to Australia in the 2014 Anzac Test at the Sydney Football Stadium. On 13 May 2014, Hiku re-signed with Manly to the end of the 2017 season after the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs offered him a contract who were searching for a fullback to replace the departed Ben Barba. Hiku, who has expressed his desire to stay with the Sea Eagles, also reportedly turned down a one million dollar contract to return to the New Zealand Warriors despite the opportunity to be closer to his family. Hiku cemented his place on the wing for the Sea Eagles, even keeping 2013 NRL top tryscorer David Williams in NSW Cup before \\"The Wolfman\\" was suspended for the season by the NRL due to a betting scandal. Hiku finished off the season with him playing in all of the Sea Eagles 26 matches and being the club’s highest tryscorer with 17 tries. On 23 September 2014, Hiku was selected in New Zealand's Four Nations train-on squad. On 7 October 2014, Hiku was selected in New Zealand's final 24 man squad for the Four Nations. Hiku played superbly at fullback in the Kiwi 30-12 victory over Australia on 25 October 2014 in the first game of the Four Nations tournament, helping the Kiwis to a 30-12 win over Australia, as well as their first win over Australia since the 2010 Four Nations final. Hiku went on to feature in every tournament game for the Kiwis, playing every minute of every game at fullback. Hiku played in the Kiwis 22-18 Four Nations final win over Australia at Westpac Stadium. 2015 On 31 January and 1 February, Hiku played for the Sea Eagles in the 2015 NRL Auckland Nines. He retained his spot in the New Zealand team for the 2015 Anzac Test, though he was moved to the centres as the Kiwis continued their Four Nations form with a 26-12 win over Australia at Suncorp Stadium. Hiku finished the 2015 season having played in 22 matches, scoring 8 tries and kicking 3 goals for the Sea Eagles. On 8 September, he was named in the New Zealand Kiwis training squad for their tour of Great Britain. He was a shock selection at five-eighth, playing in all three matches against England in the Kiwis' 2-1 Baskerville Shield series loss. In November, he was told by Manly's new incoming coach Trent Barrett that he was free to look for another club. He was linked with the Penrith Panthers, Parramatta Eels, South Sydney Rabbitohs and St. George Illawarra Dragons, eventually signing a 3-year contract with Penrith on 9 December, starting in 2016, after being released from the final two years of his Sea Eagles contract. 2016 In Round 1 of the 2016 NRL season, Hiku made his club debut for the Panthers against the Canberra Raiders, playing at centre and scoring a try in the Panthers 30-22 loss at Canberra Stadium. In Round 11 against the Gold Coast Titans, Hiku suffered a season ending knee injury in the Panthers 28-24 loss at Penrith Stadium. Hiku finished his 2016 NRL season early with him playing in 11 matches and scoring 5 tries in his first year with the Panthers. 2017 In Round 1 against the St George Illawarra Dragons, Hiku made his return for the Panthers where he suffered a fractured eye socket from a late hit from Dragons prop Russell Packer in the 42-10 shock loss at Jubilee Oval. Hiku was set to miss a month of footy but returned early in Round 3 against the Sydney Roosters where he came off the interchange bench in the 14-12 loss at Penrith Stadium. On 19 June 2017, Hiku was released from his contract mid-season from the Panthers to join the Warrington Wolves in the Super League after he was going behind in the pecking order for the centre and wing positions.https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/league/93838147/former-kiwis-fullback- peta-hiku-departs-penrith-panthers Hiku finished his 2017 NRL season with the Panthers with him playing in 9 matches and scoring 1 try. Hiku scored his first try in a 22-6 victory over local rivals the Widnes Vikings, and then scored again against them the following week in a 28-14 win in Round 1 of the Super 8 Qualifiers. Hiku would go on to play in 11 matches and score 10 tries in his short stint for Warrington. On 9 October 2017, Hiku was granted a released from Warrington on compassionate grounds to sign with the New Zealand Warriors on a 3-year deal, starting from 2018.http://www.news.com.au/sport/nrl/warriors/warriors-confirm-signing-of- test-utility-peta-hiku-from-warrington-wolves/news- story/8f7a99553be9553a38908d5a334400d8http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/sport/2017/09/warrington- wolves-release-peta-hiku-freeing-probable-move-to-the-new-zealand- warriors.html On 5 October 2017, Hiku was named in the 24-man New Zealand Kiwis squad for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup.https://www.nrl.com/news/2017/10/05/kiwis-world-cup-squad-named/ Hiku only played in 1 match in the tournament which was against Scotland, where he scored a hattrick of tries in the 74-6 demolishing win at Lancaster Park in Christchurch.http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid;=11940530 2018 In Round 1 of the 2018 NRL season, Hiku made his club debut for the New Zealand Warriors against the South Sydney Rabbitohs, playing at centre in the 32-20 win at Perth Stadium.https://www.nrl.com/news/2018/03/06/south- sydney-rabbitohs-v-new-zealand-warriors-nrl-match-preview- round-1/https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/teams/warriors/roger- tuivasasheck-stars-as-new-zealand-down-south-sydney-in-upset-round-1-win/news- story/7bea7087d8559bf72cfc885a980778e5 2019 2020 Scored his 3rd career hat trick and first since 2015 vs North Queensland on 12 June 2020.

The company was named after the hit song \\"Rocket Man\\". The label was originally distributed in the UK by Island and in the US by MCA Records, both of which Elton John was also signed to (after 1976). History Original logo based on The Little Engine That Could The first artists who signed to the label were the group Stackridge, who completed two albums for The Rocket Record Company after moving from MCA. It also became the home of Cliff Richard, Neil Sedaka (whose three most successful U.S. mid-1970s albums were on Rocket), Colin Blunstone, the Hudson Brothers, Blue, Kiki Dee, Judie Tzuke, The Lambrettas, Junior Campbell, Brian & Brenda Russell, and the Dutch band Solution. John offered to sign Iggy Pop & The Stooges to the label, but they declined. After John left his British label, DJM, in 1976, his records were also released by The Rocket Record Company on both sides of the Atlantic. The label also attempted to attract talent from all over the UK and submitted an advertisement to Melody Maker for bands to record their sound of today and get it out tomorrow. With an album called \\"499 2139\\" (which incidentally was the studio's telephone number) they turned to the talents of Pete Waterman (of Stock Aitken Waterman fame). Waterman and his then assistant Tony Keys recorded and produced a unique mixture of music which, although it only charted the bottom of the album charts, managed to capture a mixture of genre including a track from The Lambrettas called \\"Go Steady\\". In the US and Canada, John's residency on his own label was short-lived. After only one album, Blue Moves, and a couple of singles (including the hits \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" and \\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\\"), he returned to MCA. At this time, The Rocket Record Company switched its distribution to RCA after being dropped from MCA. The label was discontinued in the US in the early 1980s, then relaunching in 1995 with John's Made in England album, distributed by Island Records. 1997's The Big Picture and \\"Candle in the Wind 1997\\" were distributed in the US by stepsister A&M; Records. In the UK, John's records were continuously released by The Rocket Record Company from 1976 onwards. In 1978 the distribution moved to Phonogram Inc., then to Mercury Records in 1995. By this time, John was the only artist on the label. Worldwide distribution rights to Elton John's music was consolidated when MCA Records' then-parent Seagram acquired PolyGram, the owner of Island, Mercury, and A&M;, in 1998. Universal Music Group, which oversaw Seagram's recording operations, now co-owns the Elton John catalogue with the singer himself, continuing to distribute it worldwide. Recent history In 1999, The Rocket Record Company was absorbed by The Island Def Jam Music Group, and it operated under IDJ's Mercury Records division. However, the logo was still used on all new Elton John releases until 2007. The name was also resurrected in 2006 for the eponymous Platinum Weird album. In 2011, John formed a company named Rocket Music Entertainment Group. The label still exists today, but now just has three newer artists signed to it, as John himself has not released a studio album on Rocket since 2004's Peachtree Road, although the 2010 one-off collaboration with Leon Russell, The Union has the Rocket logo from that time. Otherwise, Rocket is primarily a management company handling established artists such as Ed Sheeran and Squeeze's Chris Difford along with upcoming artists including Anne-Marie and Jake Issac.

The Conservation Minister Kate Wilkinson declined the application for the reserve in 2010 on the grounds that it would adversely affect recreation fishing.

In terms of actual numbers the two separate consultation processes for the application had attracted more support than opposition. In April 2013 the Minister of Conservation Nick Smith announced the approval of the reserve but at the reduced size of 475 ha.

Fuchs (29 January 1927 ‒ 17 March 2013) was a scholar of American studies and an expert on immigration policy. He was an author and university professor who founded the American studies department at Brandeis University, where he was the Meyer and Walter Jaffe Professor of American Civilization and Politics. Early career Fuchs served in the U.S. Navy during World War II as a medic. He began teaching at Harvard University in 1952 before finishing his doctorate there in 1955. He then began teaching at Brandeis in 1955. Teaching at Brandeis Fuchs founded the American Studies department at Brandeis in 1970. He chaired the department for 25 years. Among his courses was a seminar on American politics that he co-taught with Eleanor Roosevelt, who was a visiting professor at the time. Outside the university From 1961 until 1963, Fuchs was the first Peace Corps director in the Philippines. He later wrote a book, Those Peculiar Americans: The Peace Corps and American National Character, about his experiences with the Peace Corps. Fuchs later founded the Commonwealth Service Corps in Massachusetts, a domestic service organization similar to the Peace Corps. In 1979, Fuchs worked as the Executive Director of the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy in the Carter administration. His efforts led to signing and passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, and later the Immigration Act of 1990. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 was the first major U.S. immigration reform enacted since 1965 and was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. In 1990 Fuchs served as vice chairman of the United States Commission on Immigration Reform, a congressional advisory board. In 1997, the commission recommended increased policing of employers that hire illegal immigrants: a proposal that continues to be contested. Personal Fuchs married Natalie Rogers in 1950. They had three daughters together. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1970. That same year, Fuchs married Betty Corcoran Fuchs, who had one daughter and three sons from a previous marriage.

It is generally expressed in pounds per square inch (PSI) or copper units of pressure. Overview When the firing pin in a firearm strikes the primer, it ignites the powder inside the case, creating an explosion that generates a large amount of pressure, often exceeding 50,000 PSI. This pressure in turn pushes the bullet out of the case mouth and into the barrel. During this explosion, the brass walls of the cartridge expand and seal against the inner walls of the chamber. This expansion is what creates chamber pressure, or the amount of force applied to the inside of the chamber by the case. For all commercially available cartridges, the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturer's Institute (SAAMI) publish the maximum safe chamber pressures. Measuring Methods There are 3 basic methods for measuring chamber pressure:http://www.chuckhawks.com/pressure_measurement.htm * Using a copper crusher * The Piezo method * Attaching a strain gauge to the barrel forward of the chamber Copper Crusher Method Through the mid-1960s, the most common way of measuring pressure was drilling a hole through the chamber of the barrel and inserting a copper slug that fit flush with the chamber walls. When a cartridge is fired, it compresses the copper slug. It is then removed, measured, and compared to the original dimensions. Using the known properties of copper, the chamber pressure can then be calculated and expressed in copper units of pressure (CUP).Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering, Fourth Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, 2012, p. 217 While there are now more accurate methods of measuring chamber pressure, the copper crusher method is still used for verification purposes. The Piezo Method Developed in the late 1960s the most common method of accurately measuring chamber pressure is the Piezo method. It is similar to the copper crusher method where a hole is drilled into the chamber, but rather than a copper slug a quartz crystal transducer is inserted and attached to sensitive measuring equipment.Fundamentals of Materials Science and Engineering, Fourth Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, 2012, p. 527 This method generally yields more accurate readings than the copper crusher, and is more cost efficient due to the fact that the transducer can be reused. Strain Gauge Method The strain gauge method is the least accurate method of measuring chamber pressure using equipment, but has the advantage of being the least expensive and requires no permanent modifications to the firearm. A strain gauge is attached to the barrel just forward of the chamber. Upon firing, the barrel stretches briefly, and this stretch is measured by the gauge.Mechanics of Materials: An Integrated Learning System, John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, 2011, p. 547 This method is generally reserved as a way of relatively comparing different cartridge loads as the strain gauge reading is not as accurate as a copper crusher or Piezo test. Importance in Firearm Maintenance The force that is not exerted on the chamber walls is used to push the bullet down the barrel. Because the volume of the case is relatively small, the pressure closest to the chamber will be higher than at any other point in the barrel. Compared to the temperature of the powder being burned, a relatively small amount of energy and heat is transferred from the powder in the barrel to the barrel walls. Therefore, the entire process can be considered an adiabatic process, or no heat is lost during the rapid expansion of the gases. Thus, the ideal gas law can be used to express the difference in pressure as the bullet travels along the barrel:Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics, Seventh Edition, John Wiley and Sons, Hoboken, 2011, p. 49 P1(V1)κ=P2(V2)κ or P2=P1(V1/V2)κ where: * P1 is the initial pressure * P2 is the pressure acting against the tail of the bullet at a given point * V1 is the internal case capacity, or volume of the loaded cartridge * V2 is the internal case capacity plus the volume of the barrel from the chamber to the bullet * κ is the adiabatic index of the gas contained inside the chamber and the barrel Looking at this thermodynamic equation, it can be seen that the amount of pressure acting upon the bullet decreases at it travels down the barrel due to the increase of the gas volume. Likewise, the part of the barrel that is subject to the highest pressures is the throat, or the point closest to the chamber at which the bullet engages the rifling. Because of this, the rifling at the throat will erode faster than the rest of the barrel. Several measures can be taken to decrease the rate of throat erosion due to pressure, some of which can be achieved by handloading. # If a bullet is seated further out (i.e. closer to the rifling) it will increase the internal volume of the case. By examining the ideal gas law, PV=nRT, it can be seen that by increasing the case volume, the pressure inside the case is reduced. This in turn reduces the chamber pressure and the amount of force exerted upon the throat. # If the amount of powder is decreased, the explosion inside the case will be smaller and will result in less pressure.

Munday was featured in the 2006 Rakontur documentary, Cocaine Cowboys.http://mickey-munday.com/bio-mickey-munday- genuine-cocaine-cowboy/ Internationally renowned for his abilities to circumvent law enforcement's efforts to capture and arrest him by boat or airplane during Miami's cocaine epidemic, Munday was often referred to as the \\"MacGyver\\" of cocaine smugglers. Now known as \\"The last surviving \\"Cocaine Cowboy,\\" Munday makes his living as an actor, writer, speaker and storyteller. His latest CD, Tall Tales, is a collection of adventurous anecdotes re-told by Munday about his days as a smuggler. In April 2018, a federal judge sentenced Munday to a 12-year prison sentence after he was found guilty on auto fraud- conspiracy charges. Early life Munday was born and raised in Miami, Florida. His father, George \\"Sunny\\" Munday was a professional football player, who played four seasons in the NFL and was a machine shop owner. His mother, Dorothy Duncan, was a former Miss Ohio beauty queen and school teacher, who taught at North Miami Junior High school until her retirement in 1976. Mickey has one sibling, a younger brother. When Munday was 13 years old, his father put him to work at the family-owned concrete business, M Block. There he learned how to manufacture and design concrete ventilation, benches, tables, fences, and stepping stones. In 1971, Munday took over M Blocks after his father became ill and subsequently retired. He ran the company until 1978, closing it after a rapid decline in construction in Florida. From 1972 through 1978, Munday owned and operated several different businesses simultaneously. In 1972, he opened Mike's Bike Shop, specializing in high-performance motorcycles. In 1975, he opened Ultimate Boats, a custom boat manufacturing company specializing in open fish and speed boats. In 1980, he founded LC Towing. Introduction to trafficking The sudden death of a close friend, in 1978, left Munday responsible for removing unwanted contraband from his friend's warehouse before the man's grieving parents found it. Having thought it was only 2–10 pounds of marijuana, Munday was shocked to discover 2,000 pounds of marijuana inside a locked room. After clearing out the room, Munday gave the pot to a friend, who sold it and gave Munday $165,000 from the sale. After careful consideration and extensive planning, Munday purchased his first plane, a 680 Aero Commander, and began transporting marijuana from South America to the US, devising methods of avoiding unwanted attention from law enforcement agencies along the way. In 1980, Max Mermelstein, an American associate of the Medellin Cartel, was introduced to Jon Roberts, who was in need of a direct supplier of cocaine into the United States. Munday introduced Roberts to Rafael \\"Rafa\\" Cardona Salazar, a high-ranking member of the Medellin Cartel and Pablo Escobar's American connection. Downfall Max Mermelstein was arrested in 1985 by Miami Police, as a multi-kilo dealer, and was implicated by a California trafficker who gave information to the DEA in exchange for a lighter sentence. Mermelstein turned state's witness against the Medellin Cartel after his arrest and provided information that led to the subsequent raids on Munday's properties on September 20, 1986. Munday, a step ahead of law enforcement, had held agents at bay by opening the gas tank of a cocaine-laden plane and pointing a flare gun at several 55-gallon gasoline drums nearby. Federal agents were noted as saying it was a standoff, and Munday escaped. Munday then fled into the Florida swamps, which he knew very well, and managed to elude capture by federal authorities until 1992, when he was finally arrested in Richmond, Virginia, by U.S. Marshals. He was sentenced to 10 years in a federal correction facility and was released on December 9, 1999. Personal life Munday, who has never married, has an adopted daughter, Jessica Brant (born October 23, 1967), and three grandchildren. He still lives in South Florida, where he enjoys his local celebrity status as the last surviving \\"Cocaine Cowboy\\" and was coined by Miami New Times reporter Gus Garcia Roberts as \\"A South Florida Local Treasure\\". The Telegraph's Jacqui Goddard reports that Munday lived a low-key, frugal lifestyle both during his heyday as a drug trafficker and does so presently: > While his cocaine cohorts cruised Miami in Lamborghinis and Ferraris, Munday > largely eschewed the flashy lifestyle that his tens of millions of dollars > in fees could have bought him, figuring that it was better not to draw > attention to himself. He channelled most of his cash into buying property, > which was all forfeited after he was prosecuted. He now lives what he admits > is a \\"frugal existence\\" in Miami, getting around on a pedal bicycle with his > fashion-defying long, blond hair flowing behind him, his look perhaps more > Dog the Bounty Hunter than Miami Vice. Munday became the last \\"Cocaine Cowboy\\" standing \\"who is still alive and not behind bars\\" following Griselda Blanco's murder in September 2012. Current career Munday is currently in prison. Before that he made a living as an actor, writer, speaker and storyteller. He also works occasionally as a resource for SOUTHCOM (US Military's Southern Command)'s research partnership with Florida International University. In that capacity, he has twice been invited to speak to members of such crime-fighting agencies as the DEA, the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Coast Guard, police, and armed forces, to share information helpful to counter-narcotics and counter- terrorism strategies. In 2016, Munday converted a vacant lot near his North Miami home into a community park that he named \\"Love-Lock Park\\".

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history The Turner Cattle Pound is located near the geographic center of the rural community of Turner, at the southwest corner of General Turner Hill Road and Kennebec Trail. It is a roughly square stone structure, its sides measuring between and in length. Its walls are fashioned out of fieldstone, laid dry in irregular courses. Portions of the walls have collapsed over time, but were originally between in height. The structure's only entrance is at the center of the east side, formed out of two upright granite posts and a granite lintel about long, which is fastened to the posts by metal pins. One of posts retains the metal pintles from which a gate would have been hung, and the other has an eyebolt where the gate would have been latched. The town of Turner was settled in 1772 and incorporated in 1786. Its first poundkeeper was elected two years later, but it is not known where stray animals were confined. The first documentation for a municipally funded pound is dated 1795, when a structure of unknown form was authorized to be built in Turner Center. The present structure was funded by the town in 1816 and built by Moses Merrill on land belonging to Cushing Phillips. The site was chosen for its geographically central location, and because it was at the junction of two roads providing access to much of the community. The town's last pound keeper was elected in 1918.

Built in 1893, it is an unusual example of a rambling and asymmetrical Colonial Revival house. It was designed by local architect George M. Coombs and built for Bradford Peck, owner of Peck's Department Store, one of the largest such stores in New England. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. It now houses professional offices. Description and history The Bradford Peck House stands on the west side of Main Street, roughly north of downtown Lewiston, an area that was historically a fashionable residential area. It is a 2-1/2 story clapboarded wood frame structure, with a hip roof topped by a flat balustraded widow's walk. Its asymmetrical massing and projecting elements are reminiscent of the Queen Anne style, but the details are essentially Colonial Revival in character. The roof line has a modillioned eave, and the building corners are pilastered. A rounded section projects from the northeast corner, and a porch extends along the south side, supported by fluted Ionic columns. The house was designed by local architect George M. Coombs, and was built in 1893 for Bradford Peck. Peck was a Massachusetts native who moved to Lewiston in 1883, purchased a dry goods business in 1885, and renamed it B. Peck & Co. in 1890. In addition to having Coombs design his house, Peck also commissioned Coombs to design his department store building, a four-story Romanesque building at the corner of Lisbon and Main Streets. Peck's was said to be the largest department store outside Boston, with forty departments displaying all manner of merchandise. Peck's house remained in residential use until 1985, and now houses professional offices.

It originally aired on CBS in the United States on September 22, 2009. The episode is written by Jesse Stern and directed by Dennis Smith, and was seen live by 20.61 million viewers. \\"Truth or Consequences\\" follows \\"Aliyah\\", the sixth season finale, and carries the plot surrounding Ziva's captivity. In the closing moments of season 6, she was shown to be held hostage in a prison camp in Somalia and tortured nearly beyond recognition. The majority of the episode is told in a series of flashbacks that cover the four months in which Ziva was missing, focusing on the team attempting to replace her as Tony searches for her whereabouts. The episode ends with Tony along with Gibbs and McGee heading to Somalia to rescue her, bringing her back to DC. Plot The episode opens depicting terrorist Saleem Ulman (Omid Abtahi) interrogating a captive in the dusty room of a prison camp in Somalia. The camera angle shifts to show that the captive is NCIS Agent Tony DiNozzo, who stubbornly refuses to give up any information. Unfamiliar with NCIS and Tony's mission, Saleem administers a truth serum and questions Tony extensively about the inner workings of the agency, how he was able to find his base of operations and why he travelled so far in his quest. Unable to keep quiet due to the serum's effects, Tony begins to recap the three months at NCIS since Ziva disappeared. It is shown through flashbacks that the NCIS team began working a drug case in May after Ziva's departure and that they had not received any word of her. After a few weeks, wishing to move on, Tony and McGee approach Gibbs about searching for a replacement on the team. Gibbs unenthusiastically tosses the task of selecting the replacement to them and again confronts Vance, still hoping that Ziva will return eventually. Vance admits that Ziva's father, Mossad Director Eli David, has not mentioned her to him and suggests that she has been put back in the field. Tony and McGee interview several women as prospective replacements, none of which work out for various reasons. In present day, Tony concludes that they could not find a suitable candidate because \\"Ziva's not replaceable.\\" Saleem questions why they are not looking for her, and Tony reveals that NCIS is under the impression that Ziva is dead. He further relates that in the months prior, he, McGee, and Abby, concerned that something might have gone wrong, had tracked down her last known whereabouts. They discovered that, while on a mission to take out Saleem in Northern Africa, a ship she had boarded had gone down in a storm and that there were reportedly no survivors. Saleem again questions the reason for his presence in Somalia, and Tony replies that he travelled to Northern Africa to seek vengeance on the parties responsible. It is then shown that Vance had given Tony, McGee, and Gibbs permission to travel to the region on the guise of searching for information. However, Tony and McGee were quickly taken prisoner by Saleem. Saleem then demands that Tony reveal the identities of all NCIS agents in the region, and threatens to kill a hostage if he doesn’t speak. To Tony’s surprise, the hostage is Ziva. Ziva, who has been severely abused whilst in captivity, is shocked and horrified to see him, asking why they are there. Tony replies, \\"Couldn't live without you, I guess.\\" When he admits that he and McGee deliberately allowed themselves to be captured, she brokenly responds that they should not have put their lives and wellbeing at stake for her, urging them to tell Saleem what he wants to hear and try to save themselves. Desert in Somalia Saleem returns, prepared to kill whichever party still refuses to speak. Ziva pleads with him to kill her and spare Tony and McGee, insisting that they are more valuable hostages. However, just as Saleem is about to execute Ziva, Tony cryptically tells Saleem that he has \\"thirty seconds to live\\" and says \\"Remember when I told you my boss was a sniper?\\", referring to the fact that Gibbs was once a Marine sniper. Gibbs had been lying in wait the entire time, and just then takes a sniper shot, killing Saleem instantly before taking out the other guards watching over Ziva, Tony and McGee while American troops storm the compound, killing the rest of Saleem's men, and allowing them to escape. After they all return to the office, everyone stands up and welcomes the team back with a huge round of applause. Production \\"Truth or Consequences\\" is written by Jesse Stern and directed by Dennis Smith. Much of the episode is set in a fictional terrorist training camp in Mogadishu, Somalia. Though elements of torture are used, most of the violence takes place off-screen or is only implied, and the episode does not feature any \\"extended torture scenes\\". Before the storyline developed, then-Executive Producer Shane Brennan announced, \\"Something tragic will happen to Tony. Something tragic will happen to Ziva as well. It’s one of those arcs that has been building and building and building for so long that we decided it really deserved to be featured in a big way. It's emotionally and physically explosive.\\" Brennan later hinted at the events that would unfold in the seventh season premiere: \\"You cannot miss the first minute...You'll think you know what's going on, but then you'll go, 'Am I seeing things? What just happened?'\\" Shortly after \\"Aliyah\\" aired, it was assured that Cote de Pablo's character, Ziva, would return, but that there would be repercussions from her captivity: \\"Cote de Pablo will be back next season. But she'll be a changed woman.\\" Mark Harmon later remarked that viewers still worried that de Pablo would not be back, saying, \\"She loves the job and can’t wait to get here in the morning. Here we are in year 7 with this really terrific mix. That's what I would say to people in the summertime, when they'd say 'What about Ziva?' [As in, will she leave the show?] I'd say, 'No one is stupid. It took too long to get this group together.'\\" After \\"Truth or Consequences\\" aired, de Pablo explained the purpose of the storyline and its long-term ramifications: Michael Weatherly (Tony DiNozzo) later cited \\"Truth or Consequences\\" as one of his favorite episodes, commenting, \\"In order to get that look of being dehydrated in the desert and sunburned, they put glue on my lips. Glue tightens the skin so you can't smile. I couldn't open my mouth, and when I tried to laugh I sounded like Doctor Evil meets Beavis, or maybe it's Butthead. In this scene, Tony's been given a truth serum, which means you’re getting completely unabashed DiNozzo, and it was hysterically funny that he was so relaxed. He was just tickled and amused by the situation, punky and very funny. It's not like he was trying to be bad ass—if anything he's thinking, if this plane goes down, I might as well enjoy it.\\" Reception Ratings \\"Truth or Consequences\\" was seen live by 20.61 million viewers and by 22.53 viewers live+DVR in the United States. In Canada and Australia, the episode was viewed by 2.699 million and 1.97 million people respectively. The premier's ratings were significantly higher than the sixth season finale, which drew 16.51 million. Shortly before the episode aired, it was reported that, \\"NCIS has risen to TV's No. 2 scripted series, enjoying a 24% ratings spike last season (averaging 18 million viewers), surprising for a show so long into its run.\\" Within a few weeks, the show became the No. 1 scripted series in America. Critical reviews Overall, response was mostly positive. Glen Diaz of BuddyTV called the situation \\"harrowing\\" and said, \\"The return to the NCIS headquarters was fascinating and sort of unreal, but all ended up well in the end. Then again, we know there's got to be no way that NCIS will split this team up - although I did have a scary moment there when Abby (Pauley Perrette) said she felt that Ziva was no longer in their universe.\\" Sarah Lafferty from Starpulse.com noted, \\"Vengeance has always been the fuel for team Gibbs as well as a strong unrelenting theme of the show.\\" Lafferty added, \\"'NCIS' season premieres NEVER disappoint. Even if it all goes down in only the last 15 minutes of the episode...The show doesn't hold without Ziva. I was as unsettled as Tony, Abby, McGee, and Gibbs were in the flashbacks. Bringing her in three quarters into the episode was no shock, but lit starter fluid for the rest of the season, and it's going to be all about Ziva.\\" Other critics praised the structure of the episode; commentator Michael Littles concluded, \\"Overall, this was a very good NCIS episode that is full of thrills, light humor, danger, and suspense. It was exceptional because of how the episode is pieced together: flashing backward and forward in time and not revealing everything that is taking place. In the end you don’t have a clue that a rescue attempt is even in the works which makes the ending a great surprise.\\" Allison Waldman of AOL TV wrote, \\"It was supremely satisfying to watch them go back month-by-month to reveal how Gibbs, Tony, McGee and Abby were undone by Ziva's absence...Nothing could top the moment, though, when Tony got to look Saleem in the eye, referred to the movie True Lies, and calmly reminded the guy that his boss was an expert sniper. Then, from behind some weird desert camouflage, you saw Gibbs' eyes and -- BANG -- Saleem was gone. Gibbs took him out with one shot. On the emotional front, of course, Ziva is shell-shocked. She feels undeserving of the rescue, and when she returned to the office and everyone applauded the team for their mission, the vacant look in her eyes spoke volumes. Abby hugged her, doing what Tony wanted to do, but Ziva's not really all there yet. She's traumatized. It's going to take some time to get back to normal. All the more reason why next week's show is must-see viewing for me and the other 20 million who watch NCIS.\\" Michelle Calbert of BuddyTV later listed \\"Truth or Consequences\\" among \\"The 10 Best 'Tiva' Episodes\\" of the show's ten year run.

Despite these influences, South Korean fashion has maintained a unique style which has influenced worldwide trends. South Korea's style is known for being expressive and reflecting a sense of individuality, which are absent from the style of its northern counterpart, North Korea. In addition, the Korean Wave (the spread of appreciation for South Korean culture) is beginning to affect the fashion world. For example, some pop stars from Korea have recently been making appearances in large cities such as New York, widely known as one of the world's fashion capitals. Euny Hong, journalist and author, predicts that this fashion phenomenon will soon reach across the world. History  Antiquity and the pre-modern era  Winter clothes were typically made using soft cotton stuffed between layers of silk or cotton. Clothes worn in the summer were made from hemp and ramie. Components of these clothes helped to form the look and style of the traditional Korean dress, hanbok. Historically, Koreans have preferred to wear white clothing, a tradition believed to have stemmed from the Three Kingdoms period. To Koreans, white traditionally symbolizes simplicity, integrity, innocence and nobility.

The event was hosted by the Korea Tourism Organization, and featured performances by K-Pop artists such as MBLAQ, Infinite, Big Bang, IU, Girls’ Generation , and Miss A. The fashion show featured (among others) collections by 2PLACEBO, 8seconds, Kappa, and Skin Food. K-pop and The Fashion World With the Korean Wave sweeping over many countries in East Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North America and Oceania, the cultural influence of Korea has reached the global fashion world, as well. Fashion plays an integral role in many aspects of Korean culture, such as in Korean Popular Music, also known as K-pop. This attention to fashion is evident in the outfits worn by artists, who are partnering up with major fashion houses to showcase their work. 2ne1 Fashion Wave Many K-pop fans closely follow popular artists' or groups' activities, with fashion playing both an integral and important role in the trends set by their idols. In turn, those fans replicate their style to fit their own lifestyle. For example, 2NE1 introduced high-end fashion labels such as Givenchy and Balmain to the Korean audience. According to Harper's Bazaar, \\"Korean style is a mix of streetwear and luxury\\". They further highlight that the trend is combining European brands and streetwear brands together. Blackpink and Mulberry Lisa and Rose, members of the popular girl group Blackpink, were featured on the September issue of Dazed Korea. Their ensemble was created from pieces from Mulberry's 2018 Fall/Winter collection. In addition, they sat in the front row at this year's Mulberry Show in Seoul. The objective of Johnny Coca, the creative director of the major British fashion house, was not only to make Mulberry a prominent brand in the UK but also to garner international recognition in places such as South Korea. In an article by Vogue, Coca states that \\"Korea was the second (biggest) country in terms of revenue so it was important to be part of that expansion and to communicate more about the brand and its heritage to the Korean customer\\". Targeting Korea not only expands the brand's reach but also helps it gain high exposure due to the fashion-forward audience by inviting popular K-Pop idols with a wide reach of fandom. Winner and Burberry Another famous British fashion house, Burberry, was featured by Mino and Hoony, two members of the popular K-pop group Winner. They were dressed in the Burberry Spring/Summer 2018 collection for the brand's show. Furthermore, they received early access to the Spring 2018 collection as soon as they landed in England. According to an article in Vogue, \\"The two wore full looks while enjoying their time around London, sharing multiple images of themselves in pieces that are sure to be among the seasons most coveted. While sharing snapshots of tartan tote bags and classic trenches, the pair also managed to squeeze in a little sightseeing...\\" This creates a mutually beneficial relationship between the brand and the artists. The artists promote the brand's clothing by sharing their fashion insight with their fans.

She worked briefly for the Cameri Theater but was not enamored with the Tel Aviv scene, which reminded her of what she had left behind. She adopted a 2-year-old girl and moved to the north of the country, first to Kibbutz Ma'agan Michael and then Kibbutz Yasur. She was married to author John Auerbach, who died in 2002.

Torro was born in Lauro, Terra di Lavoro, near Naples. After first studying literature and history locally, he traveled to Naples to study painting at the Academy under professor Giuseppe Mancinelli; from there he moved to Rome and entered the studio of professor Coghetti. He then traveled outside of Italy; while he was residing in Paris in 1859, war between Savoy and Austria erupted, and Toro returned to Italy to fight as a volunteer in the cacciatori delle Alpi (Hunters of the Alps). He stayed with the military forces, and was nominated to lead militia fighting brigands in Terra di Lavoro. In 1860, he was one of the first followers of Garibaldi to enter Calabria. His experience in the wars of independence provided him with ample subjects for his art. He painted two genre scenes about the fighting brigands, La messe and Il pasto dei villani. In 1861 he painted two oil canvases, the Guide esploratrici and the Entrance of Garibaldini to Calabria. In 1870, he opened a studio in Rome. Later in life he painted many genre country scenes. His masterwork was a painting of The philosopher Agostino Nifo of Sessa before the King of Naples (Charles V of Spain), which was once displayed at the Pinacoteca of Capodimonte. ‘‘Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti.’’, by Angelo de Gubernatis.

Biography Born to a poor family, at 20 years, he left Ferrara in search of work. He worked in Bologna in the decorations of the palazzo del Podestà, which was being restored. He worked in the church of Santa Maria del Soccorso of Livorno. He moves to Florence, to work under the sculptor Luigi Pampaloni. For Pampaloni, Torreggiani completed many portraits. He stayed in Florence eleven years, then he returned to his Ferrara, where he opened a studio. At the cemetery of Ferrara he completed the monuments for the Mantovani and Botti families; a monument to the American Lovel Putman, a monument to the family of Cavaliere Santini, a monument to the lawyer Marcellino Lombardi, a monument to Maragola. He also made the monument in honor of the Garibaldino patriot Bonetti, who died at the Battle of Bezzecca. The allegory depicts the personification of the city of Ferrara, who inscribes his name in the annals of his country's history. He also made busts of the patrons of the Hospital in the Casa di Ricovero. He completed a bust of Vittorio Emanuele for the City of Terni. Torreggiani traveled widely through Europe, to Paris, London, Vienna, and Madrid. In Madrid he sculpted a portrait bust of the former queen Isabella, for which he was awarded the Cross of Charles III. He also completed a portrait of Gioacchino Rossini for the Republic of San Marino. In 1860, the City Council of Cento commissioned from Torreggiani a marble bust of Count Cavour, placed in the Council Hall. For the City Hall of Rovigo, in 1860, he sculpted a marble bust of Count De Angelis. He was commissioned by Cardinal Michele Viale-Prelà a large statue of the Immaculate Conception.

In 2007, he provided lyrics and performance for Live from Planet B-Boy for the film Planet B-Boy. In 2008, IAMISEE produced Laisse-Nous Croire on the Kery James album À l'ombre du show business. The album reached number 3 on French Music charts in its first week. The record is certified platinum in France and was the biggest selling rap album of 2008 in France. In 2010, Blacksmith Records selected Threes, written, produced and performed by IAMISEE to be included on Talib Kweli & Year of The Blacksmith Present: The Community Mixtape.  Early career and Ruffhouse Records  His career began in 1992, at the age of fourteen, during an era known as Golden age hip hop. The artist was originally known as Divine in the duo Grace & Divine with Michael Lowe. In 1994 the group had a production and development deal with Andy Kravitz of Ruffhouse Records. The production deal did not go anywhere, but IAMISEE was introduced to and worked with such Ruffhouse Artists as Scott Storch, while Storch was working with The Roots on Do You Want More?!!!??!, and Chuck Treece. He loosely collaborated with artists from the label, but work was released only independently and possible commercial releases may not have been credited (see Controversy). By the late nineties Divine & Grace split up, Ruffhouse was defunct and most of the artists IAMISEE was affiliated with moved to Sigma Sound Studios. In 1998 the artist changed his name to IAMISEE (see Meaning of the Name). After going solo he had minor deals with small independent labels. One EP and one LP were released and another album was permanently shelved before the artist began an independent solo career in 2006. Despite his past affiliations with artists who went on to achieve commercial success, IAMISEE's career took a different route. He did maintain working relationships with established artists, including Chuck Treece and Grammy award winning writer Kameron Houff (see Discography), but to date has never signed a recording contract with a Major Recording Label and has no known affiliation to an Agent or Manager. He did become self-taught in various aspects of record production, such as; mixing, graphic design, website development and video editing. IAMSEE's most notable work began after becoming an independent artist.  Independent career  IAMISEE's work with Planet B-Boy received international recognition through the production company's web postings, the song reportedly had over 4,000,000 YouTube views before the posting account was shut down. In 2012, the song IAMISEE produced for James was selected (by Kery James) with thirteen others from among all of James' catalog for a rerelease on the album 92.2012. It was profiled in a book of the same name. The album 90.2012 peaked at number 12 on the French Music Charts. Both works were created and negotiated by the artist without any label backing or management. In addition to the success of those works, his 2006 release IAMISEE vs DJ Demon was listed on the CMJ Hip Hop Airplay Charts in March 2007. The song Exodus was in rotation on the Rodeny P & Skitz Show on BBC Radio 1Xtra in January 2007. Beyond Race Magazine said, \\"the last four tracks may be the best 17 consecutive minutes of Independent hip hop this year\\". The single Hello was featured on the DC Shoes Kings of LA skate competition DVD that same year. The album IAMISEE vs DJ Demon was the last that was written, produced and performed by IAMISEE (scratching provided by DJ Demon). It was followed by instrumental and collaborative albums that were released as free downloads or through digital download retailers. All artwork for each album was also done by IAMISEE.  Ongoing career  IAMISEE is currently collaborating with Belgium's DJ Iron and is expected to follow up IAMISEE vs DJ Demon in 2013-14 with another album entirely produced, written, and performed by the artist.  Controversy  Despite the international exposure of the Planet B-boy theme (registered with BMI), distribution issues with the film's Production Company caused the artist to see very few royalty payments for the song. There are no sources for any legal action regarding the matter. Legal action was, however, taken by IAMISEE's original partner Grace, aka Michael Lowe, against their former friend and collaborator Scott Storch. In 2005 Lowe lost a Copyright Lawsuit against artists Dr. Dre, Xzibit and Scott Storch for the song X, from Restless (Xzibit album). According to the deposition Storch, a credited writer on the song, denied Lowe's involvement with the production of the beat for the song. Ultimately, Lowe lost the lawsuit. The ruling was not because Lowe didn't prove his intellectual property of the recording, but because he stated that he gave the beat to Storch to pass along to Dr. Dre and never expected to be paid. It is rumored that some of IAMISEE's early productions may have been used in a similar way, but currently there are no lawsuits or public statements.  Meaning of the name  IAMISEE is a phonetic spelling of \\"I Mic\\" or \\"I emcee\\". Earlier Artist Bios cite the meaning as \\"I am what I see\\" or an extension of Cogito ergo sum (\\"I think, therefore I am\\") interpreted as \\"I am, therefore I MC\\".

The area was made a zakaznik in 1972 for the conservation of bar-headed geese and upgraded to a full nature reserve in 2000. It has also been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Description The reserve occupies a wide valley 320 km east of the provincial capital of Khorugh, lying between the southern Alichur and Vahan ridges of the eastern Pamir Mountainss at 4000–5460 m above sea level. The landscape consists mainly of gentle slopes of sparsely vegetated alpine steppe. The core of the reserve is the 3900 ha freshwater Zorkul lake at an altitude of 4125 m. The maximum depth of the lake is 6 m. Its surface is covered by vegetation. Bar-headed geese and other waterfowl breed on islands in the lake. Although land use in the reserve is prohibited, its surrounds are used as pasture. Fauna As well as for bar-headed geese, with up to 125 breeding pairs using the site, the reserve was classified as an IBA because it supports significant numbers of the populations of several other bird species, either as residents, or as overwintering, breeding or passage migrants. These include Tibetan snowcocks, Himalayan snowcocks, ruddy shelducks, saker falcons, Himalayan vultures, lesser sand plovers, brown- headed gulls, yellow-billed choughs, Hume's larks, white-winged redstarts, white-winged snowfinches, rufous-streaked accentors, brown accentors, black- headed mountain-finches, Caucasian great rosefinches and red-fronted rosefinches. Mammals found in the area include long-tailed marmots, juniper voles, silver mountain voles, tolai hares, Royle's pikas, Marco Polo sheep. Siberian ibex, snow leopards, Eurasian lynx, Pallas's cats, grey wolves, red foxes, Turkmenian weasels, stoats and brown bears. The two fish species found in the lake are the false osman and the Sattar snowtrout. No amphibians or reptiles have been recorded.

The bridge is one of two listed on the Register within Fillmore County, the other being the Deering Bridge. The bridge is a single-span, concrete, spandrel arch facility. The site was first designed by state engineers in 1917, and was constructed in 1918. At the time of the construction, the facility's architectural style was the main bridge design in the state. The bridge still retains all original building materials, and has only undergone slight maintenance since construction. The bridge carries Fillmore County Road 6 over the West Fork of the Big Blue River. Location and description alt=A dirt road with a bridge The Big Blue River Bridge is located in the Grafton Township, in the northwestern portion of Fillmore County. The bridge is located approximately five miles north and one mile west of the village of Grafton,Hess 1992, p. 1 or approximately directly northwest of Grafton. The facility is located along Fillmore County Road 6 (CR 6), and is about from CR 6's northern terminus at County Road 1, and about north of CR 6's southern terminus at Thayer County Road AA. The site is rectangular shaped, with dimensions of by , which contains only the bridge.Hess 1992, p. 4 The Big Blue River Bridge carries CR 6 over the West Fork of the Big Blue River. The bridge is located just west of School Creek's confluence with the river. The facility carries the road's single lane.

The span has a length of while the bridge has a total length of . The roadway width along the bridge is .Hess 1992, p. 2 The facility's floor is covered with gravel filled with dirt, the same substance as the surface of the road. The bridge structure also contains a solid, concrete, rectangular parapet.Hess 1992, p. 5 History Background Starting in the early 1900s, Fillmore County began experimenting in designing bridges constructed entirely of concrete. Starting from around 1914, concrete became the exclusive construction material for bridges in the county. The main designs for the concrete bridges were arches and slab spans. This building style remained the main design for the county's bridges until 1920. The style was largely due to the state of Nebraska's reliance on concrete to construct bridges, which was believed to be more durable than steel, which was usually used to construct bridges at the time.Hess 1992, p. 3 Planning and construction alt=A picture of a concrete bridge Fillmore County's reliance on concrete bridges began to decrease when it hired William A. Biba as its county engineer. Biba began experimenting with different bridge designs, and constructed all of the county's bridges until 1931. The first plan for a bridge over the Big Blue River's west fork was drawn up in June 1917. The bridge consisted of a single concrete arch in length, which would pass between Grafton Township's Sections 1 and 2. However, no documentation exists to show that the bridge was constructed. In early May 1918, the plan was introduced for the construction of the Big Blue River Bridge, engineered by Biba. The plan was approved by the County Commissioners Court later that month, and awarded a $4,250 contract (equivalent to $ respectively in ) to local contractor Frank N. Craven. He constructed the bridge later that year. Aside from minor maintenance repairs, the bridge has remained unaltered since its construction, and continues to carry vehicular traffic. Its condition is considered \\"good\\". Significance The Big Blue River Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on June 29, 1992. The bridge was nominated under national register criteria C, relating to design and construction. The facility's historic significance is architecture and engineering with an area of significance under engineering. Its historic function is considered to be road-related transportation. The bridge's period of significance is 1918, with a significant date of 1918. The facility is considered to be the best example of about 30 concrete bridges constructed by Biba which remain, and is considered technologically significant due to the fact that it \\"retains a high degree of integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association\\". It was one of the first designed by Biba.

History St Wilfrid’s church seems to date, for the most part, from the fourteenth century, when it may have been reconstructed with material from an older building. The nave and tower were rebuilt in 1760-3 and over the west door is a commemorative stone ‘ Mr. Pugh, Vicar, Saml. Pugh, Ino.Barrett, Church Wardens, Wm.Barrett, mason’. In 1835 the chancel was reconstructed and in 1881 the whole church was restored.Rev. A. Du Boulay Hill, ‘The Summer Excursion, 1908: Calverton church’, Transactions of the Thoroton Society, 12 (1908), pp.31-6; John Charles Cox, County Churches: Nottinghamshire (1912), p.53;N. Pevsner, The Buildings of England: Nottinghamshire, 2nd edition revised by E. Williamson (1979), p.89. An organ chamber was built in 1888 and an annexe in 1962. The nave has the somewhat unusual form of a wide parallelogram 42 feet 8 inches long and 37 feet 2 inches wide, of one span and with no traces of any arcades. The chancel arch is not in the centre of the east wall of the nave, but about five feet nearer to the north side. This has led to the suggestion that when the building was rebuilt in the 1760s, the south wall of the nave was moved further south to enlarge the building.T. O. Hoyle, A Guide to Calverton Parish Church (Calverton, 197-?), p.18 On the west wall of the ringing chamber, at second storey level, is a sandstone carving, on its side, of a man apparently digging, while on the west wall of the clock chamber, at third storey level, is a collection of nine sandstone panels believed to represent the occupations of the seasons. Seven of these stones are voussoir-shaped, and may have formed part of a band of ornament nine inches wide on the architrave of an arch in the earlier pre-fourteenth century building. Similar depictions of country activities may be seen on the fonts at Burnham Deepdale in Norfolk, and Brookland in Kent. Carved into the capital of the north jamb is a small, 3” by 4”, panel containing a three-quarter length depiction of a bearded bishop together with another figure. It is perhaps St Wilfrid himself, either with a newly baptised convert or, as the freeing of slaves was a distinguishing feature of the bishop's career, in the act of manumission. D. Hill, 'Some Ancient Carved Stones in Calverton Church, Notts' in Archaeological Journal , Vol 58 (1901), pp.459-63;Corpus of Romanesque Sculpture in Britain and Ireland Organ The organ is by Brindley & Foster dating from 1880.

Market concentration, a related metric, measures the degree to which a comparatively small number of firms accounts for a large proportion of the market. These metrics are useful in comparing a firm’s or a brand’s relative position across different markets and in evaluating the type and degree of competition in those markets.Farris, Paul W.; Neil T.

The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language: Marketing Activities and Metrics Project . Purpose The purpose of the “relative market share metric” is to access a firm's or a brand's success and its position in the market. A firm with a market share of 25% would be a powerful leader in many markets but a distant “number two” in others. Relative market share offers a way to benchmark a firm's or a brand's share against that of its largest competitor, enabling managers to compare relative market positions across different product markets. Relative market share gains some of its significance from studies–albeit controversial ones—suggesting that major players in a market tend to be more profitable than their competitors. Construction :Relative Market Share (%) = :100 * Brand’s Market Share ÷ Largest competitor’s market share Relative market share can also be calculated by dividing brand sales by largest competitor sales because the common factor of total market sales (or revenue) cancels out.

Employing a novel and sophisticated integrated movement and combat system called CLIMACS, the Trial of Strength between the two WWII superpowers of Germany and the Soviet Union could be simulated with great emphasis on maintaining initiative and momentum and rewarding sound battle plans.  Historical Synopsis  The war on the Eastern Front was the most decisive of all theatres during the Second World War. Its outcome determined the face of Europe we know today. At its peak some 10 million men and women, 20,000 aircraft and over 10,000 armoured fighting vehicles were engaged in one of history's most fiercest and costly struggles, While most of the central and eastern European nations were involved it was essentially a trial of strength between the two military superpowers of the day - Germany and the Soviet Union.  Game-play  Trial of Strength is a turn-based board wargame that puts the players in the shoes of armed forces commanders who must determine objectives, allocate forces and execute operations designed to achieve victory over your opponent. The battlefield the game is played on is a hexagon-style 1:4,000,000 scale map of Eastern Europe with each hex represents 72 kilometres (45 miles) from side to side. Each turn represents approximately 10 days, with 3 turns per month. Units are generally corps of the Axis and armies for the Soviet Union, both about 60,000 troops each, while also consisting of smaller battlegroups of specialist formations. On top of the Conventional Land-warfare, Integrated Movement and Combat System (CLIMACS), players must handle game-play mechanics such as air power, command and control, morale, terrain and supply and logistics. Trial of Strength employs a special rule-set for the use of airborne, marine, mountain, artillery, rail-gun, rail construction NKVD and SS units. The presence of an integrated political system into the game-play caters for historical events such as the reticence of Finland and the uprising of the Slovaks among others. While variable progress on the Western Front through the effects of Allied bombings and Partisans poses variable conditions for players.  Reception  Fire & Movement magazine cover featuring Trial of Strength Trial of Strength has appeared in a number of publications including Fire & Movement magazine, where the game featured on the cover of the 10th anniversary edition (number 49) in July/August 1986 and Breakout! The Australian Gamers' Quarterly magazine (number 22) in June - August 1986, which released two new official scenarios for the game covering the Balkans in 1941 and Poland in 1939. A copy of Trial of Strength is also currently housed at the National Library of Australia (ID: 10524074) and is open to the public for viewing.

The school is located near Madikeri, which is 7 km from Madikeri, headquarters of Kodagu district. The school is also known as JNV Kodagu.  History  Established in 1987, under the Navodaya Vidyalaya Scheme, the school is CBSE affiliated, co-educational and residential.Initially when the school building and other infrastructure was under development, the school was operational in a building in the Government Junior premises at Madikeri Town,In 1995 the Vidyalaya was shifted to the present site at Galibeedu Road.  Purpose  Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya known as JNV are Indian schools for talented children and form a part of the system of gifted education. The objectives of the scheme are to provide good quality modern education to the rural talented children in each district of the country. These vidyalayas are fully residential, co-educational with reservations for 75% rural, urban 33%, 33% girls, 15% SC, 7.5% ST, and 3% Physically Handicapped students. The unique feature of Navodaya Scheme is the migration system for promoting national integration through an exchange of 30% of students of 9th from Hindi speaking states to Non-Hindi speaking and vice versa.  Co-Curricular Activities  Various competitions of literary, cultural, performing art, visual art, physical education, sports and games etc. are conducted regularly. All the competitions are conducted house wise in order to inculcate healthy competitive spirit among children. Students of the Vidyalaya participate in the Republic Day and Independence day celebrations at District Headquarters every year.  House System  The students are accommodated in four houses named after the old mountain ranges of the country Viz. Aravali, Nilgiri, Shivalik, Udaygiri separately for boys and girls and for juniors and seniors. The teachers are assigned the duties of Housemasters for boys and Housemistresses for girls.  Migration  Migration of students in class 9 takes place every year to JNV Manpur. Also approximately same number of students immigrate here from that school. It aims at bringing regional harmony and bringing unity against regionalism. It also facilitates the students to get a chance to learn languages other than their own. The students have to fill in the willingness form to assure that they are ready for migration at the time of admission. The selection of students is upon willingness and if it does not meet the 30% of the batch in 9th class, a lot system is adopted. Those who are not ready even after they are selected under lot, will have to quit the school. But till date, everyone who has enjoyed the migration facility, are satisfied and happy about the living at Manpur except Darshan J.

The initial 14th-century build was temporarily halted by the spread of the plague into the village in 1350. The present building has developed over several centuries. The nave and aisles were built of loosely-coursed rubble, quite different from the hewn, squared stone of the later 14th-century chancel and tower. Inside there is an oak screen, also dated as 14th century, and the vestry has a medieval aumbry – a cupboard where the sacred vessels were kept.

It was released in October 1969 by Capitol Records. Axelrod composed, arranged, and produced the album while recording with session musicians such as guitarist Al Casey, drummer Earl Palmer, and conductor Don Randi. As with his 1968 debut album Song of Innocence, Axelrod and his musicians performed musical interpretations of English poet William Blake's Songs of Innocence and of Experience, an 18th-century illustrated collection of poems. A jazz fusion album, Songs of Experience explores darker sounds than its predecessor, as the poems Axelrod selected dealt with the darker side of humanity. Its music was partly inspired by composer Gunther Schuller's Third Stream concept. Axelrod composed Baroque orchestrations with rock, R&B;, pop, and folk music elements. Songs of Experience received retrospective acclaim from critics, who found Axelrod's compositions musically varied and innovative. In the years since its original release, musicians also praised it as a source for sampling in hip hop production. Some of its songs have been sampled frequently by hip hop artists and producers. In 2000, the album was reissued by EMI.  Background  Songs of Experience, an illustration collection of poems by William Blake. As he had on the 1968 album Song of Innocence, Axelrod composed musical interpretations of the works of English poet William Blake on Songs of Experience. He used eight poems from Blake's Songs of Experience (1794). The album's gatefold packaging featured Blake's poems reprinted for each song and liner notes that stated, \\"an anthology of awareness after birth ... based on the 18th century poems of William Blake.\\" Blake's poems began with the premise of birth and innocence, and explored themes of life experience, rite of passage, and changes of perspective in life.  Musical style  A jazz fusion album, Songs of Experience was partly inspired by Gunther Schuller's Third Stream concept, which fused American jazz with European classical music. Axelrod supported his Baroque orchestrations on the album with rhythms and melodies from rock, R&B;, and pop music. The album's suite is more orchestral and less rock-oriented than Song of Innocence. Its symphony is embellished with percussive sounds, British and Irish folk song elements, and stylistic innovations from contemporary arranger Gerald Wilson. With Songs of Experience, Axelrod explored darker sounds, as the poems he had chosen dealt with the darker side of humanity. For \\"The Human Abstract\\", he used ascending piano, bass, and percussion instruments to evoke the ghost described in Blake's poem. It is a bass-driven, funky song that juxtaposes augmented sevenths strummed on an electric guitar against an acoustic piano and muted horns. According to music critic Thom Jurek, \\"The Divine Image\\" and \\"A Little Girl Lost\\" elicit feelings of majesty and \\"pastoral sadness\\", respectively. \\"London\\" was recorded by Axelrod as a tone poem to reflect Blake's opening stanza about the spiritual climate of London at the onset of the Industrial Revolution: \\"I wander thro' each charted'd street / Near where the chart'd Thames does flow / And mark in every face I meet / Marks of weakness, marks of woe.\\"  Reception and legacy  Songs of Experience was released in October 1969 by Capitol Records on stereo LP. It was reissued on CD in 2000 by EMI. In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Thom Jurek gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars and said that Axelrod \\"succeeded in spades\\" in his search for a sound that \\"best exemplified not only his feelings but also the heady text he sought to sonically illustrate.\\" Jurek felt that his compositions were diverse, lush, and able to resemble literature by \\"using as much space as they do sound for dramatic and dynamic effect\\", and that Axelrod created original palettes for rock instrumentation through his complex use of the horn section's \\"various colors\\". Lynell George of the Los Angeles Times called it a \\"prescient, genre- defying\\" solo project, and NME journalist John Mulvey viewed it as a \\"landmark\\" album. Mojo cited the album, along with Song of Innocence, as Axelrod's artistic peak and particularly praised \\"The Human Abstract\\" as \\"beautiful and blank\\", evoking \\"the view from Arthur Lee's castle of an endless pale blue sky and the vast deathly city beneath it.\\" Tom Hull was less receptive, giving the album a B grade and calling it \\"the sort of high schmaltz you often get with movie music, with at least one cut ('The Fly') transcending the level of dreck\\". Songs from the album have been sampled frequently by hip hop producers and artists, including Black Moon, who sampled \\"A Divine Image\\", and DJ Shadow, who sampled the luminous piano line from \\"The Human Abstract\\" on his 1996 song \\"Midnight in a Perfect World\\". English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience one of his favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: \\"You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing.\\" American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it \\"early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm- section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements.\\" In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording \\"London\\", deeming it \\"crazy stuff\\" that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, \\"this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and stuff like that. This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have. Somebody told me I should listen to [Axelrod]. This is one I'm definitely going to buy I'd like to do more stuff with complicated melodies, everybody playing together, drum breaks, things like that.\\"  Track listing  All songs were composed, arranged, and produced by David Axelrod.

It was called by the Union of Hong Kong Dockers (UHKD), an affiliate of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU) on 28 March 2013, against contracting companies to whom workforce management had been out- sourced by the Hongkong International Terminals Ltd. (HIT), subsidiary of Hutchison Port Holdings Trust (HPHT), which is in turn owned by Hutchison Whampoa Ltd (HWL), flagship company of Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest man. The strike workers demanded better pay and working conditions. The strike ended on 6 May 2013 when the strikers accepted the offer of 9.8% pay rise. It was the longest running industrial action in Hong Kong in years. Public support and media attention on the strike were unprecedented in the city's history. Some observers marked this as the rejuvenation of political engagement. Demands Earlier before the strike, the dockers demanded a 12 percent pay hike, plus overtime pay at 1.5 times the basic wage in January 2013. The demand was not fulfilled. On 28 March, some 450 crane operators and stevedores went on strike inside the Kwai Tsing Container Terminal, for better pay and conditions. They demanded a $1.60 per hour raise. More workers joined the action, but they were forced outside the port after the local court granted HIT a temporary injunction on 1 April banning unionists and their supporters from entering any of the four Kwai Tsing container terminals. Kwai Tsing Container Terminal in 2008. Dockers complained that they have had a minimal rise in income in the last 10 years. Mr Lee, a dock worker for more than 20 years, said there had been two very low adjustments. \\"Basically, there's no fringe benefits, we only had paid leave in recent years. My monthly income isn't steady. I earn HK$15,000–$16,000 (US$2,000) during the high season, and less than HK$10,000 (US$1,300) for the low season.\\" The workers demanded a 20% pay rise to a daily wage of HK$1,600, equivalent to a monthly salary of HK$24,000 based on 15 working days. Chan Chiu-wai, an organiser of the Confederation of Trade Unions, said that dock workers earned $167 a day for 24 consecutive hours' work, less than they received in 1997. Chan said staff often work shifts of up to 72 consecutive hours during high-season. \\"For this work, the salary is very low, the working conditions are very poor and the hours are very long, so we are often in the position of being understaffed and the workers have to work many hours overtime,\\" Chan added. According to the strike leader, Lee Cheuk-yan general secretary of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions and also the Labour Party legislator and said the checker and lashing man was receiving only HK$1,310 per 24 hours. They had to station in the terminal for 24 hours and work; crane operators would often continuously work 12 hours in the crane; they would eat and answer calls of nature inside the booth. Workers said whilst HIT had granted increases to the contractors over the years, the latter had not passed on increases to the workers. \\"We are overworked, not given enough rest time, and we don't have proper toilet breaks. We have to shit in newspapers in our cranes.\\" HIT dismissed claims that workers were being paid less now than they were in 1997. \\"It's also wrong that their pay is now lower than in 1997 or during SARS,\\" HIT general manager Gerry Yim Lui-fai told the South China Morning Post. Several long-serving stevedores working for Lem Wing Transportation and Everbest dismissed the strikers' claims as exaggeration. A 7-year veteran crane driver said \\"It's not that we can't go to the toilet or don't have time for a meal... In fact, we have short breaks of two to three minutes between vessels berthing at the terminals. Very rarely can I get 15 to 30 minutes. We also take turns to have meals so that we have around 15 to 20 minutes for mealtimes.\\" He said that he enjoyed a pay increase in 2011. Two Everbest employees said that, by working as a pair and managing their time during a 24-hour shift, they can alternate and work six or twelve hours. They said they took home HK$1,315 and HK$1,441, (between US$170 and $185) per shift, averaging HK$20,000 ($2,560) per month. They also said that some of their colleagues wanted to return to work, but were worried they would be chastised as spineless.Beatrice Siu, (April 23, 2013). \\"Strike claims challenged\\" . The Standard. Negotiations and strike actions Hong Kong International Terminals, subsidiary of Hutchison International, operates the port with a number of directly-employed staff supplemented by employees hired via four subcontractors. Subcontractors – who are not genuinely independent companies – are intermediaries used to put distance between HIT and workforce, to hold down wages and provide operational flexibility. HIT refused to negotiate with the workers, saying that such matters were subcontractors' responsibility.Wang, Jasmine (22 April 2013). \\"Li Ka-shing Port, Workers Wage Ad War as Strike Enters 26th Day\\". Bloomberg BusinessWeek The CTU insisted that it would refuse to talk with individual contractors, and would talk only if all the contractors were present. The first meeting between the Union of Hong Kong Dockers and contractors were held under the mediation of the Labour Department on 10 April but broke off without any immediate progress. The representative of the Beijing-loyalist Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU) which did not join the strike and the rival union of the pro-democratic Confederation of Trade Unions said they would only look for a 12-percent rise, compared to the 23 percent increase demanded by the Confederation of Trade Unions as they claimed. A second round of talks between striking dock workers and the contractors, mediated by the Labour Department, ended without agreement on 11 April, but both sides said they would consider each other's proposals. Another negotiation failed to reach agreement on 12 April. The two unions present at the meeting were the Federation of Trade Unions, whose members are not on strike, and the Federation of Hong Kong and Kowloon Labour Unions, representing the Hong Kong Docks and Ports Industry Unions whose 300 workers are employed directly by the port operator, HIT, and who were staging a work-to-rule. The FTU says it will not accept a five percent pay-rise and a two percent increase in welfare benefits. The two unions insisted on 12 percent. On day 18 of the strike, Hongkong International Terminals issued a statement declaring optimism that operations were returning to normal, with \\"more workers returning to their posts\\". HIT said that the terminal was running at 86 to 90 percent handling capacity over the previous weekend. The union rejected the claim that some strikers had returned to work, saying their 450 striking colleagues had reduced terminal handling capacity to 15 containers each hour instead of 25 before the strike began. However, The Standard noted some signs of a drift back to work over the previous five days.Ip, Kelly (15 April 2013) \\"Break in ranks denied as strikers feel heat\\" , The Standard. On 17 April, another round of talks between striking dock workers and the employers made little progress as the contractors rejected the 23-percent wage increase demanded by the CTU and stood firm of their seven-percent pay rise proposal. After the talks failed on 17 April, CTU members escalated their industrial action by setting up camp outside the Cheung Kong Center, where the Hutchison Whampoa Group is headquartered. Global Stevedores, a contractor who employs fewer than 200 dock workers, announced on 19 April that it would be winding up in June at the expiry of its contract with HIT due to \\"an inability ... to continue its operations\\" – three-quarters of the company's workers had gone on strike and the union's 20-percent pay rise demand could not be met. However, the workers regard this closure as a move calculated to put pressure on them. During the third week of the dispute, the union and HIT both engaged in war of words in the press. HIT took out full page advertisements in almost all local newspapers on 20 April, except the anti-government Apple Daily, not merely defending itself but making personal attacks on Lee Cheuk-yan claiming he is using the workers to further his own political ends. HIT's advertisement in the English-language press said union demands for a 20 percent raise would \\"create an impact across other industries and cause irreparable damage to Hong Kong.\\" Canning Fok, managing director of the Hutchsion Whampoa group, publicly alleged that Lee Cheuk-yan was not genuinely interested in helping the workers and harboured ulterior motives. He criticised Lee for \\"resort[ing] to every means ... hoping that as the strike drags on, he can negotiate with Mr Li so as to boost his own publicity.\\" Fok likened the style of the dispute to the Cultural Revolution, \\"where people are vilified on banners and posters\\". The SCMP estimated the series of adverts would have cost around HK$1 million. Workers took out advertising space in Ming Pao Daily with a headline suggesting that KS Li did not really understands their situation. On 1 May 2013, Hutchison Port Holdings group managing director John Meredith published an article in several Chinese-language newspapers said the strike was jeopardising Hong Kong's entrepot status. \\"The union and its leaders said they would protect the livelihood of workers, but it seems to me that they are more concerned about the political bargaining chip they have gained,\\" he said. Meredith accused Lee Cheuk-yan for ignoring such facts, saying that Lee's \\"Cultural Revolution-style\\" banners targeted tycoon Li Ka-shing and even Hutchison businesses, stating making politicised and exaggerated gestures do not help. Lee slammed the company for resorting to delaying tactics and neglecting the problems of pay rises and working conditions. After 40 days of strike action, the union called an end to the dispute, having secured promises of a pay deal of 9.8 percent for all workers including non-strikers and improved working conditions. Strike consequences The unions say the striking workers account for some 30%–40% of dock employees serving Hutchison's terminals in the city. HIT said the strike is costing it HK$5 million (US$644,000) in daily losses. According to the chairman of Hong Kong Association of Freight Forwarding and Logistics, vessels now need to queue up outside of Hong Kong port for two to four days before being able to berth; the wait was negligible just before the strike.Wang, Jasmine (10 April 2013). \\"Hong Kong Port Workers to Hold Talks as Strike Enters 13th Day\\". Bloomberg BusinessWeek The association estimated 120,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) have accumulated since the strike action began two weeks earlier. Although the docks are said to be operating at approximately 80 percent capacity, an insider at one major Japanese shipping line said that the company's cargo traffic via Hong Kong has been delayed by more than three days due to the strikes, prompting the line to consider rescheduling some of their ships to first call at other cities. Several shipping lines, such as Evergreen Marine, Mitsui OSK Lines, are reported to have diverted vessels to other ports, or skipping Hong Kong altogether. An industry insider said that Hong Kong ports needed to stay competitive as it was already facing strong competition from other ports in the region such as Shenzhen; the trend, shifting from transshipping to directly importing through a mainland Chinese port, was not in Hong Kong's favour. Hongkong International said that instead of losing HK$5 million, the strike was costing it HK$2.4 million daily from 5 April because an \\"increasing number\\" of workers returned to work.Wang, Jasmine (19 April 2013). \\"Li Ka-Shing’s Striking Port Workers Lose Jobs as Protest Widens\\". Bloomberg BusinessWeek Shares in Hutchison Port Holdings Trust listed on the Singapore Exchange dropped to US$0.81 on 17 April, which is the lowest since the Kwai Tsing dock strike began after research showed that the strike could have cost the port operator HK$100 million in revenue. Public response Protestors gathered at Victoria Park, Hong Kong on the afternoon of 7 April The workers have attracted many supporters among student unions and pro-democracy parties in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Federation of Students have organised donation and supply collection points outside major train stations. Hong Kong's pro-democracy Labour Party is also supporting the strike, in which the party's chairman Lee Cheuk-yan is also the leader of the Confederation of Trade Unions and organiser of the strike. The union was paying the striking workers (HK)$1,000 per day, and was encouraged to have gained the support of the International Trade Union Confederation. Lee Cheuk-yan expressed confidence that \\"the strike will not be easily displaced.\\". Sympathisers have been making donations to support the workers, and union's fund reached US$645,000 on 16 April 2013, sufficient for union members' lost wages only for about 10 days. On 7 April, protesters marched from Victoria Park to Central carrying placards and modified images of Li Ka-shing's with devil's horns and the Chinese character for \\"monster\\" (妖) written across his forehead. Organisers said that 4,000 demonstrators joined the march; police estimated 2,800 at its peak. The Liberal Party's youth committee chairman criticised the CTU for politicising the dispute. Media coverage Next Magazine published on 3 April reported that the managing director of the HIT Gerry Yim Lui-fai, who earlier said that the workers should negotiate with the contractors but not HIT refused to involve in the dispute, was a board member of one of the contractors involved in the pay dispute. HIT denied this; Yim reiterated that no members of top management of Hutchison Whampoa, Hutchison Port Holdings Trust or HIT are board members of any of the contractors. Yim said that the name of Sakoma – the HIT subsidiary that previously dealt with out-sourcing contracts – still appears on the entry passcards, and acknowledged it was a mistake for that name to be there. Yim said the Hutchison Logistics, replacing Sakoma, is now responsible for management of out-sourcing. The programme Scoop on TVB, the dominant terrestrial television channel in Hong Kong, on 1 April drew criticism. The strikers objected to the programme, saying it was biased, misleading and did not give enough airtime to the strikers. The Communications Authority had received 1,800 complaints within four days and TVB said it had received 47 complaints from the audience, and the broadcaster had no particular stance.

At the end of 2015, his injury record also saw him demoted from the South African Rugby Referees' Association's Elite Panel to their National Panel, and he was removed from the refereeing panel altogether for 2017.

Thousands of churches and monasteries were systematically closed, seized or destroyed. As a result, many works of religious art and objects were permanently lost. Church leaders were especially targeted as part of an overall effort to destroy Polish culture. At least 1,811 members of the Polish clergy died in Nazi concentration camps. An estimated 3,000 members of the clergy were killed. Hitler's plans for the Germanization of the East did not allow Catholicism.Ian Kershaw; Hitler a Biography; 2008 Edn; WW Norton & Company; London p.661 The actions taken against Polish Catholicism were part of Generalplan Ost which, if carried out, would have eventually eradicated the existence of the Poles. Adolf Hitler said in August 1939 that he wanted his Death's Head forces \\"to kill without pity or mercy all men, women, and children of Polish descent or language\\".  Background  Public execution of Polish priests and civilians in Bydgoszcz's Old Market Square on 9 September 1939 The Roman Catholic Church has had a presence in Poland for almost 1,000 years.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; p 60 Historian Richard J. Evans wrote that the Catholic Church was the institution that \\"more than any other had sustained Polish national identity over the centuries\\".Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press New York; 2009; p.34 By 1939, around 65% of Poles professed to be Catholic. The invasion of predominantly Catholic Poland by Nazi Germany in 1939 ignited the Second World War. Britain and France declared war on Germany as a result of the invasion while the Soviet Union invaded the Eastern half of Poland in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Hitler.Hitler's Pope? ; by Sir Martin Gilbert; The American Spectator; 18.8.06 Soviet Prime Minister Vyacheslav Molotov signs the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Behind him stand (left) German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and (right) Joseph Stalin. The Pact created a Nazi-Soviet alliance and sealed the fate of Poland. Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland from the West took place on 1 September 1939, commencing a period of occupation. Nazi ideology targeted Polish Jews for extermination and categorized ethnic Poles, most of whom were Catholic, as an inferior race. The Jews were rounded up into Ghettos or sent to extermination camps while the ethnic Polish intelligentsia, priests and politicians were targeted for elimination. Forced labor was also employed as a technique of elimination. The Red Army invaded Poland from the East on 17 September 1939.Encyclopedia Britannica: Poland – World War II The Soviets also repressed the Polish Catholics and clergy, with an emphasis on fighting \\"class enemies\\". The Soviet invasion, however, was short-lived. Operation Barbarossa, the German attack on the Soviet Union was launched in June 1941, shattering the Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact and bringing all of Poland under Nazi control.Encyclopedia Britannica Online: Poland – World War II Norman Davies wrote:Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003 The Nazi plan for Poland included the destruction of the Polish nation, which required attacking the Polish Church, particularly in areas annexed to Germany.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; p 60 Hitler's biographer Ian Kershaw said in the scheme for the Germanization of Eastern Europe, that Hitler had made it clear there would be \\"no place in this utopia for the Christian Churches\\". Historically, the Catholic Church had been a leading force in Polish nationalism against foreign domination. Therefore, the Nazis targeted the clergy, monks, and nuns in their effort to eliminate Polish culture. Nazi ideology was hostile to Christianity and Hitler held the teachings of the Catholic Church in contempt. Hitler's chosen deputy and private secretary Martin Bormann and the official Nazi philosopher Alfred Rosenberg were firmly anti-Christian. In his 1930 book Myth of the Twentieth Century, Rosenberg wrote that the main enemies of Germans were the \\"Russian Tartars\\" and \\"Semites\\" – including Christians, especially the Christians of the Catholic Church.Encyclopedia Britannica Online: Alfred Rosenberg  Division of Poland  The German military controlled Poland until 25 October 1939.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p.83 Following this, Germany annexed Polish territories into the eastern German States: West Prussia, Poznań, Upper Silesia, and the city of Danzig. The remainder of Nazi-occupied Poland came under the administration of the General government http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005070 – a \\"police run mini-state\\" under SS control and the rule of Nazi lawyer Hans Frank. Davies wrote that this area \\"became the lawless laboratory of Nazi racial ideology,” over time becoming the base of the main Nazi concentration camps.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p.86 However, Nazi policy toward the Church was less severe than in the annexed regions.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p.92  Persecutions  Polish prisoners in Dachau toast their liberation from the camp. Poles constituted the largest ethnic group in the camp and the largest proportion of those imprisoned in the Priest Barracks of Dachau. The Polish Franciscan St Maximillian Kolbe died at Auschwitz.  Targeting of intelligentsia and clergy  According to Norman Davies, the Nazi terror was \\"much more fierce and more protracted in Poland than anywhere in Europe.\\" The Nazi ideology viewed ethnic \\"Poles\\"—the mainly Catholic ethnic majority of Poland—as \\"sub-humans\\". Following their 1939 invasion of West Poland, the Nazis instigated a policy of genocide against Poland's Jewish minority. They murdered or suppressed the ethnic Polish elites including religious leaders. During the 1939 invasion, special death squads of SS and police were sent to arrest or execute anyone considered capable of resisting the occupation: professionals, clergymen, and government officials. The following summer, the A-B Aktion (Extraordinary Pacification Operation) rounded up several thousand Polish intelligentsia and the SS shot many of the priests in the General Government sector. During this operation, Poland was under military control. This period of military control lasted from 1 September 1939 to 25 October 1939. During this period, \\"according to one source, 714 mass executions were carried out, and 6,376 people, mainly Catholics, were shot. Others put the death toll in one town alone at 20,000. It was a taste of things to come.\\"Norman Davies; Rising '44: The Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; pp.85–86 In 1940, Hitler proclaimed: \\"Poles may have only one master – a German. Two masters cannot exist side by side, and this is why all members of the Polish intelligentsia must be killed.\\" According to Craughwell, between 1939 and 1945, an estimated 3,000 members (18%) of the Polish clergy, were murdered. Of these, 1,992 died in concentration campsCraughwell, Thomas J., The Gentile Holocaust Catholic Culture, Accessed July 18, 2008 (the Encyclopædia Britannica cites 1811 Polish priests died in Nazi concentration campsEncyclopædia Britannica Online – Stefan Wyszyński; Encyclopædia Britannica Inc; 2013. Web. 14 Apr. 2013.). On November 16 and 17 of 1940, Vatican Radio broadcast that the religious life of Polish Catholics continued to be brutally restricted. They claimed that at least 400 clerics had been deported to Germany in the preceding four months:The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 49–50 Around 150,000 to 180,000 civilians were killed in the suppression of an uprising, along with thousands of captured insurgents. Until the end of September 1944, Polish resistance fighters were not considered by Germany as combatants. Thus, when captured, they were executed. 165,000 surviving civilians were sent to labor camps; while 50,000 were shipped to concentration camps, and the city was systematically demolished.  Annexed Regions  Arthur Greiser, the Reichsstatthalter of Wartheland, led a radical attack on the Catholic Church. By late 1941, the Polish Church had effectively been outlawed in Wartheland. Nazi policy towards the Church was at its most severe in the territories it annexed to Greater Germany, where the Nazis set about systematically dismantling the Church – arresting its leaders, exiling its clergymen, closing its churches, monasteries and convents. Many clergymen were murdered. The annexed areas included the Catholic archdiocese of Gniezno- Poznań and the dioceses of Chełmno, Katowice and Włocławek, and parts of the dioceses of Częstochowa, Kielce, Kraków, Łomża, Łódź, Płock and Warsaw, which were all to be \\"Germanized\\". In these areas, the Polish Church was to be thoroughly eradicated, though German Catholics could remain or settle there. Hitler intended to use Poland as a colony for settlement by Germans. The indigenous Poles were to be cleared out to make room for German settlers. Following the defeat of Poland, Heinrich Himmler was appointed Reich Commissioner for the Strengthening of the German Race. Germanization of the annexed regions began in December 1939 with deportations of men, women, and children.Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press New York; 2009; pp.28-29 In the Wartheland, regional leader Arthur Greiser, with the encouragement of Reinhard Heydrich and Martin Bormann, launched an attack on the Catholic Church. Its properties and funds were confiscated, and lay organisations shut down. Evans wrote that \\"numerous clergy, monks, diocesan administrators and officials of the Church were arrested, deported to the General Government, taken off to a concentration camp in the Reich, or simply shot. Altogether some 1700 Polish priests ended up at Dachau: half of them did not survive their imprisonment.\\" Greiser's administrative chief August Jager had earlier led the effort at Nazification of the Evangelical Church in Prussia.Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press New York; 2009; p.33-34 In Poland, he earned the nickname \\"Kirchen-Jager\\" (Church- Hunter) for the vehemence of his hostility to the Church.Mark Mazower; Hitler's Empire – Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe; Penguin; 2008; ; p.92. \\"By the end of 1941\\", wrote Evans, \\"the Polish Catholic Church had been effectively outlawed in the Wartheland. It was more or less Germanized in the other occupied territories, despite an encyclical issued by the Pope as early as 27 October 1939 protesting against this persecution.\\"Richard J. Evans; The Third Reich at War; Penguin Press New York; 2009; p.34 In West Prussia, 460 of the existing 690 Polish priests were arrested; the survivors simply fled; only 20 were still serving in 1940. Of those arrested, 214 were executed; the rest were deported to General Government. Fatalities were numerous: in Wrocław, 49.2% of the clergy were dead; in Chełmno, 47.8%; in Łódź, 36.8%; in Poznań, 31.1%. In the Warsaw diocese, 212 clergy were murdered; in Wilno, 92; in Lwów, 81; in Kraków, 30; in Kielce, 13. Nuns shared a similar fate; about 400 nuns were imprisoned at Bojanowo concentration camp. Many seminary students and nuns were conscripted as forced laborers. In Poznań, only two churches were not closed or re-purposed; in Łódź, only four remained open. Poland's higher clergy was not exempt from repression; some were forced to retire, whereas others were arrested, imprisoned, or executed. Among those, Bishops Marian Leon Fulman, Władysław Goral, Michał Kozal, Antoni Julian Nowowiejski and Leon Wetmański were sent to concentration camps, with Goral, Nowowiejski, Kozal and Wetmański perishing in Sachsenhausen, Dachau, Soldau and Auschwitz, respectively.https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=472  Cardinal Hlond's Report  The Primate of Poland, Cardinal August Hlond, advised the Pope that \\"Hitlerism aims at the systematic and total destruction of the Catholic Church\\" in territories of Poland annexed by Germany. In the aftermath of invasion, the Primate of Poland, Cardinal August Hlond, submitted an official account of the persecutions of the Polish Church to the Vatican. He reported seizures of church property and abuse of clergy and nuns in the Archdiocese of Gniezno:The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; pp. 34-51 Opening hours for churches which still had their priests had been restricted to Sundays from 9 am to 11 am. Sermons could only be preached in German. Polish hymns were proscribed. Crucifixes were removed from schools and religious instruction forbidden. Catholic Action had been banned and Catholic charities such as St Vincent de Paul dissolved and their funds confiscated. Religious shrines and statues in public places were \\"battered to the ground\\". In the Archdiocese of Poznań, Hlond reported that clergy were being subjected to the same mistreatment as in Gniezno and a number had been shot, deported, imprisoned or were missing. In Poznań, which had served as the centre for organisation of Church activities in Poland, the Nazis suppressed the National Institute for Catholic Action, the Pontifical Association for the Propagation of the Faith, the Association of Catholic Women, and Catholic youth groups. Other Catholic media and educational organisations were likewise suppressed. The leaders of Catholic Action were imprisoned and Edward Potworowski, the president of the Catholic Youth Association was publicly shot in Gostyn Square, while the president of the Catholic Girls Association was expelled to Central Poland. The Curia and the Metropolitan court were taken over by the Gestapo and their records seized. The archiepiscopal palace was invaded and taken over by soldiers and its archives handed over to the Gestapo. The Cathedral of Poznań was closed and the theological seminary converted into a police school. Polish youth were arrested after mass and deported to Germany. In the Diocese of Chełmno, which had been incorporated into the Reich, Hlond reported that religious life had been almost entirely suppressed, and the ancient cathedral had been closed and turned into a garage. Its noted statue of Mary had been overturned, and the bishop's residence ransacked. Clergy and laymen had been tortured and church properties seized. Only 20 of 650 priests remained – the rest imprisoned, deported or forced into labour – sometimes resulting in death from fatigue: Hlond reported similar outrages and terror in the Dioceses of Katowice, Łódź and Włocławek which had also been incorporated into the Reich. In his final observations for Pope Pius XII, Hllond wrote:  Polish Clergy during occupation  Eighty percent of the Catholic clergy and five bishops of Warthegau were sent to concentration camps in 1939; 108 of them are regarded as blessed martyrs. Around 1.5 million Poles were transported to work as forced labor in Germany. Treated as racially inferior, they had to wear purple P's sewn into their clothing – sexual relations with Poles was punishable by death. Beyond the genocide of the Polish Jews, it is estimated that 1.8 to 1.9 million Polish civilians were killed during the German Occupation and the war. Hundreds of priests and nuns are among the 5000 Polish Catholics honored by Israel for their role in saving Jews. The university professor, and post-war Primate of Poland, Fr. Stefan Wyszynski, was ordered to leave Włocławek by his bishop, Michal Kozal and thus escaped the fate of Kozal and nearly 2000 other priests who died in Nazi Concentration camps.  Priests at Dachau Concentration Camp  The Blessed Antoni Zawistowski was tortured and died at Dachau in 1942. 1780 Polish clergy were sent to Dachau, and many are remembered among the 108 Polish Martyrs of World War II. Dachau was established in March 1933 as the first Nazi Concentration Camp. Dachau was chiefly a political camp and an estimated 2,720 (mainly Catholic) clergy were imprisoned at the camp; the Nazis established dedicated Clergy Barracks.Encyclopædia Britannica: Dachau, by Michael Berenbaum.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; pp. 276-277The Priests of Dachau by Ronald Rychlak; InsideCatholic.com; 8 October 2007. From this number recorded as being imprisoned at Dachau, some 2,579 (or 94.88%) were Catholic. A total of 1,034 clergy were recorded overall as dying in the camp, with 132 \\"transferred or liquidated\\" during that time. There are slightly different numbers in Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945. Author Paul Berben noted that R. Schnabel's 1966 investigation, Die Frommen in der Holle found an alternative total of 2,771 clergy. This also included the fate all the clergy listed, with 692 noted as having died at the camp and 336 sent out on \\"invalid trainloads\\" and therefore presumed dead. Total numbers are unknown, as some clergy were not recognized as such by the camp authorities, and some – particularly Poles – did not wish to be identified as such, fearing they would be mistreated.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p.157 The greatest number of clerical prisoners came from Poland. In all some 1,748 Polish Catholic clerics, of whom some 868 died in the camp.http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-dachau.de/stop10.html From 1940, Dachau became the concentration point for clerical prisoners.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p. 143 Priests were gathered in Blocks 26, 28 and 30, though only temporarily. 26 became the international block and 28 was reserved for Poles – the most numerous group.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p.145-6. The Nazis introduced a racial hierarchy – keeping Poles in harsh conditions, while favoring German priests.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p.148. 697 Poles arrived in December 1941, and a further 500 of mainly elderly clergy were brought in October 1942. Inadequately clothed for the bitter cold, only 82 of this latter group survived. A large number of Polish priests were chosen for Nazi medical experiments. In November 1942, 20 were given phlegmons. 120 were used by Dr Schilling for malaria experiments between July 1942 and May 1944. Several Poles died on \\"invalid trains\\" sent out from the camp, others were liquidated in the camp and given fake death certificates. Some died of punishment for misdemeanors – beaten to death or run to exhaustion.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p.148-9. Polish priests were not permitted to undertake religious activity. Anti-religious prisoners were planted in the Polish block to ensure that the rule was not broken, but some found ways to circumvent the prohibition: secretly celebrating the mass during their work. By 1944, with Germany's hopes of victory in the war fading, conditions had been relaxed and Poles could hold a weekly service. Eventually, they were allowed to attend chapel.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p.150. Religious activity outside the chapel was totally forbidden.Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p.156. Non-clergy were forbidden from the chapel, and, Berben wrote, the German clergy feared that breaking this rule would lose them their chapel: \\"the clergy in Block 26 observed this rule in a heartless way which naturally raised a storm of protest. With the Poles in Block 28 it was different: all Christians of whatever nationality were welcomed as brothers and invited to attend the clandestine Sunday masses, celebrated before dawn in conditions reminiscent of the catacombs\\".Paul Berben; Dachau: The Official History 1933–1945; Norfolk Press; London; 1975; ; p.153-4.  Resistance  Adam Sapieha, Archbishop of Krakow, became the de facto head of the Polish church following the invasion and was a principal figure in the Polish resistance. Memorial to Pope John Paul II, in Krakow. As a young man, John Paul II had participated in the Polish cultural resistance to the Nazi occupation of Poland. Following the surrender of the Polish government at the end of September 1939, the Polish Underground and the Armia Krajowa (Home Army), loyal to the Polish Government in exile, resisted the Nazi occupation. The position of the Polish resistance was complicated greatly following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Stalin, who intended to install a post-war Communist regime, allowed the Warsaw Uprising to be put down by the Nazis which resulted in 200,000 civilians dead and the Western Allies eventually recognised the Moscow backed government over the London-based legal government of Poland. At the end of the war, the Sovietisation of Poland ensued. The Polish Home Army was conscious of the link between morale and religious practice and the Catholic religion was integral to much Polish resistance, particularly during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p.402 Despite persecution, Catholic priests preached national spirit and encouraged resistance across Poland, and the Resistance was full of clergy.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; p. 74 Thousands of Poles have been honoured as Righteous Among the Nations for helping Jews – constituting the largest national contingent Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p594 and hundreds of clergymen and nuns were involved in aiding Jews during the war.http://www.yadvashem.org/download/about_holocaust/christian_world/libionka.pdf Adam Sapieha, Archbishop of Kraków, became the de facto head of the Polish church following the invasion. He openly criticized Nazi terror. Sapieha became a symbol of Polish Resistance and pride, and played an important role in the rescue of Jews.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; pp. 74-5 He opened a clandestine seminary in an act of cultural resistance. Among the seminarians was Karol Wojtyla, the future Pope John Paul II.http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2005-04-03/leader/john- pauls-heritage-without-frontiers-73821/ Wojtyla had been a member of the Rhapsodic Theatre, an underground resistance group, which sought to sustain Polish culture through forbidden readings of poetry and drama performances.Encyclopædia Britannica: Blessed John Paul II Wladyslaw Bartoszewski, a co-founder of Zegota, had worked with the Catholic underground movement, the Front for the Rebirth of Poland, and was arrested in a 1940 Nazi purge of the intelligentsia, and sent to Auschwitz. Freed seven months later following pressure from the international Red Cross, Bartoszewski and Zegota saved thousands of Jews.‘I just did what the Bible said’, Catholic Herald, 25 February 2005. Poland had a large Jewish population, and according to Davies, the number of Jews killed and the number of Jews rescued was higher than in any other nation: the rescue figure usually being put at between 100,000 and 150,000.Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p.200 Poland had its own tradition of antisemitism. According to Davies, as part of its efforts to repress potential opponents of the regime, the Communist state which established itself in Poland following the war exaggerated the presence of antisemitism in Poland, and systematically besmirched and repressed dedicated Catholics who had opposed the Holocaust, as in the 1948-9 \\"Zegota Case\\".Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; pp.566 & 568-9 Hundreds of clergymen and nuns were involved in aiding Poland's Jews during the war, though precise numbers are difficult to confirm. The monasteries played an important role in the protection of Jews.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; p.74 Matylda Getter, mother superior of the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary, hid many children in her Pludy convent. In Kolonia Wilenska, Sister Anna Borkowska hid men from the Jewish underground from the Vilna ghetto.A litany of World War II saints; Jerusalem Post; 11 April 2008. From 1941, such aid carried the death penalty. A number of Bishops provided aid to Polish Jews, notably Karol Niemira, the Bishop of Pinsk, who co-operated with the underground organization maintaining ties with the Jewish ghetto and sheltered Jews in the Archbishop's residence. When AK Home Army Intelligence discovered the true fate of transports leaving the Jewish Ghetto, the Council to Aid Jews – Rada Pomocy Żydom (codename Zegota) was established in late 1942, in co- operation with church groups. The organisation saved thousands. Emphasis was placed on protecting children, as it was near impossible to intervene directly against the heavily guarded transports. False papers were prepared, and children were distributed among safe houses and church networks. Jewish children were often placed in church orphanages and convents.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Zegota.html Catholic religious fervour was a feature of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. General Antoni Chruściel issued instructions on how front-line troops could continue to pray, recite the rosary and offer confession, and that religious festivals be celebrated. Churches were destroyed, but congregations were not deterred. The religious orders, particularly nuns, devoted themselves to praying for the Uprising. Clergy were involved on many levels – as chaplains to military units, or tending to the ever-increasing wounded and dying. \\"Nuns of various orders\\", wrote Davies, \\"acted as universal sisters of mercy and won widespread praise. Mortality among them higher than among most categories of civilians. When captured by the SS, they aroused a special fury, which frequently ended in rape or butchery\\".Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; pp. 403-405 According to Davies, the Catholic religion was integral to the struggle:Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p402 Among the hundreds of chaplains attached to the Home Army was Stefan Wyszyński, who later served as Cardinal Primate of Poland in the Communist era. The religious communities in general remained during the Uprising, converting their crypts and cellars to bomb shelters and hospitals, and throwing themselves into social work. The enclosed Convent of the Benedictine Sisters of Eternal Adoration lifted a centuries-old ban on male visitors to serve as a strategic base for the Home Army and threw open its doors to refugees, who were nursed and fed by the sisters. The prioress received an ultimatum from the Germans, but refused to leave for fear of impact on morale. Davies wrote that the sisters began their evening prayers gathered around the tabernacle, surrounded by a thousand people, as German aircraft flew overhead and \\"the church collapsed in one thunderous explosion... rescue teams dug to save the living... a much diminished convent choir was singing to encourage them. At dawn a handful of nuns... filed out. Lines of insurgents saluted. And the German guns reopened fire.\\"Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Viking; 2003; p405-6  Martyrs  The Polish Church honours 108 Martyrs of World War II, including the 11 Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth murdered by the Gestapo in 1943 and known as the Blessed Martyrs of Nowogródek. The Polish church opened the cause of Józef and Wiktoria Ulma to the process of beatification in 2003. The couple and their family were murdered for sheltering Jews. Among the most revered Polish martyrs was the Franciscan, Saint Maximillian Kolbe, who died at Auschwitz-Birkenau, having offered his own life to save a fellow prisoner who had been condemned to death by the camp authorities.

In Poland, the Church was well organised, and clergy were respected. Garlinski wrote that the Polish Church's \\"thousand year link with Rome afforded it some protection. The German Reich contained 30 million Catholics, who recognised the Pope's authority... and [each German ruler], however strongly opposed to Rome, had to take account of this...\\"Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; p 60-61 Pope Pius XII succeeded Pius XI in March 1939, on the eve of World War II. The new Pope faced the aggressive foreign policy of Nazism, and perceived a threat to Europe and the Church from Soviet Communism, which preached atheism – \\"each system attacked religion, both denied freedom and the victory of either would be a defeat for the Church\\", wrote Garlinski. Pius XII lobbied world leaders to avoid war and then sought to negotiate a peace, but was ignored by the belligerents, as Germany and Russia began to treat Catholic Poland as their colony.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; p 69-71 In his first encyclical, Summi Pontificatus of 20 October 1939, Pius responded to the invasion of Poland. The encyclical attacked Hitler's war as \\"unchristian\\" and offered these words for Poland:Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; p 72SUMMI PONTIFICATUS – Section 106 The Papal Nuncio to Poland, Fillippo Cortesi had abandoned Warsaw along with the diplomatic corps, after the invasion and the Papal Nuncio to Germany, Cesare Orsenigo, assumed the role of communicating the situation of the territories annexed to Germany – but his role of protecting the Church in Poland was in conflict with his role of facilitating better relations with the German government, and his own fascistic sympathies. Other channels existed for communications, including via the Polish primate Cardinal Hlond. The Holy See refused German requests to fill the bishoprics of the annexed territories with German bishops, claiming that it would not recognise the new boundaries until a peace treaty was signed.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; pp. 71-72. But these diplomatic actions were not considered sufficient on the ground in Poland, where more forthright statements were expected. In April 1940, the Holy See advised the US government of Franklin D. Roosevelt that all its efforts to deliver humanitarian aid had been blocked by the Germans, and that it was therefore seeking to channel assistance through indirect routes like the American \\"Commission for Polish Relief\\".FDR Library; Diplomatic Correspondence: Vatican Secretary of State to Myron C Taylor, 26 April 1940 In 1942, the American National Catholic Welfare Conference reported that \\"as Cardinal Hlond's reports poured into the Vatican, Pope Pius XII protested against the enormities they recounted with unrelenting vigor\\". The Conference noted the Pope's 28 October Encyclical and reported that Pius addressed Polish clergy on 30 September 1939, speaking of \\"a vision of mad horror and gloomy despair\\" and saying that he hoped that despite the work of the \\"enemies of God\\", Catholic life would survive in Poland. In a Christmas Eve address to the College of Cardinals, Pius condemned the atrocities \\"even against non-combatants, refugees, old persons, women and children, and the disregard of human dignity, liberty and human life\\" that had taken place in the Polish war as \\"acts that cry for the vengeance of God\\".The Nazi War Against the Catholic Church; National Catholic Welfare Conference; Washington D.C.; 1942; p. 49 The Vatican used its press and radio to tell the world in January 1940 of terrorization of the Polish people. On 16 and 17 November 1940, Vatican Radio said that religious life for Catholics in Poland continued to be brutally restricted and that at least 400 clergy had been deported to Germany in the preceding four months: In Pomerania, the Nazi Gauleiter Albert Forster permitted German priests, and believed that Poles themselves could be Germanized. However, under the exceptionally aggressive policies of Arthur Greiser, the Nazi Gauleiter of the Wartheland region, German Catholics and the Protestant Church suffered a campaign to eradicate the Polish Church, prompting the head of the German Bishops Conference to ask the Pope for assistance, but Pius offered a cautious response.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; p.63. Though Pius had assisted with the drafting of the anti-Nazi encyclical Mit brennender Sorge, which remained binding through the war, he did not repeat it during the war, and, wrote Garlinski, he was conscious that Hitler's expansion brought 150 million Catholics under the control of the Third Reich, and that conditions for Catholics outside of Poland could be adversely affected by his pronouncements.Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; pp.71-74. This \\"restrained and reasoned stance\\", wrote Garlinski, though justified in the long term, \\"did not suit the Poles\\" who expected more forthright language against the Nazis, Yet, wrote Garlinski:Jozef Garlinski; Poland and the Second World War; Macmillan Press, 1985; pp.74.

Partly influenced by the recordings of opera great Jessye Norman, she chose to pursue singing, and gained a place at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Due to consistent illness which affected her voice, she stopped singing at twenty-two, and soon started work in recruitment and training at an information technology company. Opera career Ten years after leaving Royal Northern, Llewellyn returned to music by joining a local amateur operatic society. There, a Guildhall répétiteur encouraged her to return to music. After studies with vocal coach Lillian Watson, and a summer opera course in Italy, she joined the Glyndebourne Festival Opera Chorus. While at Glyndebourne, she chose to change her surname from Davidson to her grandfather's name Llewellyn as the actors' union Equity already had a member named Elizabeth Davidson. Llewellyn continued her training at the National Opera Studio, with support from the Peter Moores Foundation. She was awarded the Sir Willard White Trophy as winner of the inaugural Voice of Black Opera competition in Birmingham in 2009.

It became a significant supplier, and survived as a business until taken over by Imperial Chemical Industries around 1930. The works has been disused since 1935.English Heritage Risk Register, Lowwood Gunpowder Works, Haverthwaite, South Lakeland, Cumbria. The mill was set up on an estuary site, for sea access, on the River Leven. Initially it was called Daye Barker & Co., the founding partners being Daye Barker, James King, Christopher Wilson and Joseph Fayrer.TNA, Low Wood Gunpowder Works Summary List. The surviving Clock Tower Works is a Grade II* Listed Building.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk, Clock Tower Works, Haverthwaite. Gunpowder production in the area (now southern Cumbria) had begun in 1764, with a mill at Sedgwick built by John Wakefield of Kendal. An important aspect was the supply of the triangular trade, in particular of Liverpool merchants engaged in it. The Low Wood works started to operate in 1798. Background The Lowwood site, near Haverthwaite, had been used earlier for a forge of the 17th century, under the alternate name Burnbarrow (closed down by 1620). In the 18th century Isaac Wilkinson set up a furnace for iron production. A pre- existing weir may have been used by the forge. Factors favouring gunpowder mill sites in what is now Cumbria included the existing charcoal industry and water power. Daye Barker left his cotton business at nearby Backbarrow in 1798. Daye Barker & Co was issued a gunpowder licence on 2 October of that year. Early days The mill made black powder, mixing imported sulphur and saltpetre with charcoal, which initially was made locally. It adopted the suggestion of government adviser Richard Watson, to control the conditions under which charcoal was prepared, as charcoal cylinders, for greater reliability. The large demand created for charcoal was met from coppices on Windermere, Coniston Water and Esthwaite Water. The best woods from the point of view of powder grain size were juniper (local name \\"savin\\"), followed by alder and silver birch. The Leven was navigable nearly to Low Wood Bridge, which may have been erected by the company.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk, Low Wood Bridge. Fayrer, who died in 1801, was a former slaver captain, and was the company's agent in Liverpool, an important export market for gunpowder in particular to West Africa. He also was in charge of the import via Ulverston of raw materials. Wilson's uncle Thomas Parke operated there. Fayrer's role was taken over by the firm of Preston & Winder, with Gerrard Preston, a slaver captain and merchant from Lancaster. He had died by 1804, his firm having been wound up at the start of 1803. Later years After the Slave Trade Act 1807 the company switched largely to the manufacture of blasting powder, a market in which it became prominent. Daye Barker died in 1835. He was replaced in the company by his son of the same name. A narrow gauge tramway was constructed for the mill. The normal transportation arrangement was: to a store at Roudsea, then by sloop to Greenodd or Ulverston. The company had a magazine at Liscard in the Wirral, licensed under the Gunpowder Act 1772. A branch line to the Furness Railway was opened in 1869. In the 1880s Bark Barn in Roudsea Wood near Haverthwaite may have been used as a store.english-heritage.org.uk, Bark Barn, Roudsea Wood, Haverthwaite, Cumbria. The safety record was poor, with explosions occurring to 1903. The younger Daye Barker left the partnership in 1858. The Lowwood Company became a limited company in 1863. It was taken over in 1882 by W. H. Wakefield & Co, who operated the Gatebeck Gunpowder Mills near Kendal.Edward Arthur Brayley Hodgetts, Tom Gregorie Tullock, The rise and progress of the British explosives industry (1909) pp. 415–6; archive.org.

It is a combination of four fields that in some contexts are more or less distinct from each other, but less so or not at all in other contexts. These four fields are sexual health, sexual rights, reproductive health and reproductive rights. In the concept of SRHR, these four fields are treated as separate but inherently intertwined. Distinctions between these four fields are not always made. Sexual health and reproductive health are sometimes treated as synonymous to each other, as are sexual rights and reproductive rights. In some cases, sexual rights are included in the term sexual health, or vice versa. Not only do different non- governmental organisations (NGOs) and governments organisations use different terminologies, but different terminologies are often used within the same organization. Some of the notable global NGOs that fight for sexual and reproductive health and rights include IPPF (International Planned Parenthood Federation), ILGA (International Lesbian and Gay Alliance), WAS (World Association for Sexual Health - formerly known as World Association for Sexology), the Center for Health and Gender Equity, and International HIV/AIDS Alliance.  History  Government-run family planning programs first began in the 1950s. However, the main objectives of these programs were often centered around population control for economic growth and development. In 1994, the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, Egypt marked a significant shift in perspective in regards to reproductive health and is considered to be the birth of the modern SRHR movement. Over the course of the conference, debates surrounding family planning shifted from that of economics to that of public health and human rights. A Program of Action (PoA) was developed by the end of the ICPD and was approved and adopted by 179 countries. The PoA affirmed sexual and reproductive health as a universal human right and outlined global goals and objectives for improving reproductive heath based around central themes of free choice, women's empowerment, and viewing sexual and reproductive health in terms of physical and emotional well-being. The PoA outlined a series of goals, based on a central mission of achieving universal access to reproductive health worldwide, that were aimed to be accomplished by 2015. In 2000, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were developed, and although reproductive health was not explicitly stated as one of the goals, it became an important component to Goals 3, 4, and 5. In 2010, the original PoA was revisited by the United Nations and updated to reflect their objective of achieving universal reproductive health care by 2015. When the MDGs and ICPD PoA phased out in 2015, the next objectives for SRHR were folded into the Sustainable Development Goals, the next iteration of the MDGs which outline objectives to combat poverty through 2030. Sexual health The World Health Organization defines sexual health as: \\"Sexual health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality. It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.\\" Sexual rights Unlike the other three aspects of SRHR, the struggle for sexual rights include, and focus on, sexual pleasure and emotional sexual expression. One platform for this struggle is the WAS Declaration of Sexual Rights. The World Association for Sexual Health (WAS) was founded in 1978 by a multidisciplinary, world-wide group of NGOs to promote the field of sexology. The Platform for Action from the 1995 Beijing Conference on Women established that human rights include the right of women freely and without coercion, violence or discrimination, to have control over and make decisions concerning their own sexuality, including their own sexual and reproductive health. This paragraph has been interpreted by some countries as the applicable definition of women's sexual rights. The UN Commission on Human Rights has established that if women had more power, their ability to protect themselves against violence would be strengthened. A significant shift occurred in the Association's history when in 1997, the World Congress of Sexology issued the Valencia Declaration of Sexual Rights. This was a visionary move on the part of Maria Perez Conchillo and Juan Jose Borras Valls (congress presidents) that shifted WAS to more of an advocacy organization championing sexual rights as fundamental to the promotion of sexual health and the field of sexology. A press conference was held during the Congress to publicize the adoption of the Valencia Declaration and received world-wide attention. This declaration has had world-wide impact in the recognition of the importance of sexual rights as human rights. Besides the tremendous impact on WHO, our declaration provoked IPPF to issue its own declaration of Sexual Rights in 2008. Subsequently, WAS made some revisions to the Valencia Declaration and proposed a WAS Declaration of Sexual Rights which was approved by the General Assembly at the 14th World Congress of Sexology (Hong Kong, 1999). The WAS adopted the Declaration of Sexual Rights, which originally included 11 sexual rights. It was heavily revised and expanded in March 2014 by the WAS Advisory Council to include 16 sexual rights: # The right to equality and non-discrimination # The right to life, liberty and security of the person # The right to autonomy and bodily integrity # The right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment # The right to be free from all forms of violence and coercion # The right to privacy # The right to the highest attainable standard of health, including sexual health; with the possibility of pleasurable, satisfying, and safe sexual experiences # The right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its application # The right to information # The right to education and the right to comprehensive sexuality education # The right to enter, form, and dissolve marriage and similar types of relationships based on equality and full and free consent # The right to decide whether to have children, the number and spacing of children, and to have the information and the means to do so # The right to the freedom of thought, opinion, and expression # The right to freedom of association and peaceful assembly # The right to participation in public and political life # The right to access to justice, remedies, and redress This Declaration influenced The Yogyakarta Principles (which were launched as a set of international principles relating to sexual orientation and gender identity on 26 March 2007), especially on the idea of each person's integrity, and right to sexual and reproductive health. In 2015 the U.S. government said it would begin using the term \\"sexual rights\\" in discussions of human rights and global development. Reproductive health Within the framework of the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, reproductive health, or sexual health/hygiene, addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life. Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and safer sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be informed of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of birth control; also access to appropriate health care services of sexual, reproductive medicine and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. On the other hand, individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health. Reproductive rights Reproductive rights are legal rights and freedoms relating to reproduction and reproductive health. The World Health Organization defines reproductive rights as follows: Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence. The area of sexual and reproductive rights is influenced by contextual cultural and social norms, socioeconomic factors and existing laws and regulations. The social-structural climate may affect both the access to and quality of sexual and reproductive health care and interventions.  Goals and objectives  Despite frequent changes to frameworks, overall goals for SRHR remain little changed. As first stipulated at the ICPD, universal reproductive health care remains the ultimate objective, and with each new framework, targets are developed to progress towards this. In the original ICPD Program of Action, the primary call was for universal access to healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, family planning and sexual health. Over time, these have expanded to include the right to access education regarding sexual and reproductive health, an end to female genital mutilation, and increased women's empowerment in social, political, and cultural spheres. Special goals and targets were also created to address adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs. Adolescents are often the most vulnerable to risks associated with sexual activity, including HIV, due to personal and social issues such as feelings of isolation, child marriage, and stigmatization. Governments realized the importance of investing in the health of adolescents as a means of establishing future well-being for their societies. As a result, the Commission on Population and Development developed a series of fundamental rights for adolescents including the right to comprehensive sex education, the right to decide all matters related to their sexuality, and access to sexual and reproductive health services without discrimination (including safe abortions wherever legal).

The bomb killed all those in the vehicle, injured seven passersby and caused extensive damage to nearby buildings. Reactions The attack took the number of people killed by ETA in 1992 to ten. Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez expressed anger at the attack, reiterating that it would not lead to the government changing its stance. He called for judicial action against those responsible for such attacks, such as Herri Batasuna, the political wing of ETA. The leader of the opposition, José María Aznar, called for a decision to be made on whether Batasuna should remain legal as a political party. The King of Spain, Juan Carlos, sent a telegram of condolence to the families of those killed. In the Basque Country, Basque President José Antonio Ardanza Garro condemned the attack, stating that such attacks were ultimately \\"suicidal\\" for ETA.

Early life and education Mosher, who grew up in Northeastern Ohio, spent the 10th grade in a boys' juvenile hall. He graduated in 1965 from Salem High School.1965 Yearbook Salem Senior High School - Salem Public Library (pg 34) In 1969, he received a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio. He attended a master's program at Duke Divinity School from 1969-1972, and he earned a master’s in education from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas in 1998. Career Mosher was a volunteer teacher in Thessaloniki, Greece from 1972-1974. In 1988, he started teaching history at a high-risk school within the Clark County School District in Las Vegas. Beginning in 2005, he wrote a weekly column titled \\"Socrates in Sodom\\" for Las Vegas CityLife, an alternative newsweekly, until the paper folded in 2014. The tag line at the end of his column stated that he was \\"a simple classroom teacher.\\" He also wrote a monthly almanac for CityLife. In 2018, he began writing an almanac for Desert Companion magazine. The column, titled \\"Random Access Memory,\\" also appears on Nevada Public Radio's website, which publishes the monthly magazine. As a teacher who wrote about the school district he worked for, the opinions in his column caused controversy. As a result, he is regularly interviewed about education issues. Bibliography Mosher's chapter “Memoir of a Modern Woman in the Modern World” was included in the book The Anarchy of Memories: Short Fiction Featuring Las Vegas Icons, which was released by Huntington Press in October 2015. The book was part of a Las Vegas Writes project, a compilation of short fiction featured at the annual Vegas Valley Book Festival (since renamed the Las Vegas Book Festival). Mosher's contribution to the 2010 fictional book Dead Neon: Tales of Near-future Las Vegas, published by the University of Nevada Press, was described by Publishers Weekly as \\"a parody of Harlan Ellison in C.J.

Ennius was a member of the gens Ennia, hence he was a relative of the poet Ennius and Manius Ennius, a Roman soldier who served with Germanicus in 14 AD on the Rhine River frontier. In 22, Ennius was accused of treason by the Roman Senate, for having converted a statue of the Roman emperor Tiberius to the common use of silver plate. However Tiberius forbade Ennius for this matter to be put on trial and saved him from prosecution,Levick, Tiberius: The Politician, p. 230 although the Roman Senate did not approve of the actions of the emperor. After this event, no more is known of Ennius. At an unknown date sometime in the early 1st century, Ennius married a Roman noblewoman from Alexandria in the Roman Province of Egypt who was of Greek, Armenian and Median descent. His wife was the unnamed daughter of Thrasyllus of Mendes and Aka II of Commagene. Thrasyllus was an Egyptian Greek grammarian and literary commentator who served as the astrologer and became the personal friend of the Emperor Tiberius,Holden, A History of Horoscopic Astrology, p. 26 while Aka was a princess from the Kingdom of Commagene.Beck, Beck on Mithraism: Collected Works With New Essays, pp.42-3 His brother-in-law was Tiberius Claudius Balbilus.

After the collapse of the USSR, many newly independent republics implemented their own numbering plans. However, many of the principles of the Soviet numbering plan still remain. The former Soviet international code +7 is still retained by Russia and Kazakhstan. Basic principles The Soviet Union used a four-level open numbering plan. The long distance prefix was 8. # One could call a local number without the code. Local numbers usually consisted of 5-7 digits, with seven-digit numbers only occurring in Moscow (since 1968), Leningrad (since 1976) and Kiev (since 1981). # Within the same numbering area (most often within the state or region) the pattern was: 8 2X YYYYYY, where 2 replaced the three-digit area code. # For calls to other areas, one had to first dial long distance prefix 8, then, after the tone, the full code of the numbering area, which consisted of a three-digit code and zone additional digit(X), and then the local phone number. #: For example: 8 09624 XXXXX for a call to the city of Klin, Klinsky District, Moscow Oblast. # For international calls, one should dial 8 10 \` . #: For example: 8 10 1 212 XXXXXXX for a call to New York City.

It was established at the start of World War II as the Flying Instructors School and assumed its current name 1941. The unit was stationed at RNZAF Base Wigram from 1945 until 1993 when it moved to RNZAF Base Ohakea. History Following the outbreak of World War II, the RNZAF established a Flying Instructors School (FIS) at Mangere near Auckland. The unit was subsequently transferred to Hobsonville and relocated again to Tauranga in 1941. At the time of the move to Tauranga the FIS was renamed the Central Flying School (CFS). After the conclusion of World War II, the CFS was transferred to RNZAF Base Woodbourne near the South Island town of Blenheim. At about this time the unit established an aerobatic team, which was renamed the Red Checkers in 1967. This team was disbanded in 1973 as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, but was reformed in 1980; the team is currently staffed by volunteers from the CFS and the RNZAF's Pilot Training Squadron. The CFS moved to RNZAF Base Ohakea on the North Island in 1993, where it remains. In addition to its flight training role, the CFS also operates the RNZAF Historic Aircraft Flight's de Havilland Tiger Moth and North American Harvard aircraft. As of 2013 the CFS shared Aerospace Industries CT-4E Airtrainer aircraft with the Pilot Training Squadron, and ran five month long flying instructor courses. Graduates of this course were posted to the Pilot Training Squadron, and may then be transferred to the RNZAF's operational squadrons after completing a six-month probationary period. In addition, the CFS was also responsible for auditing flying standards within the Air Force. At this time the CFS was the smallest flying unit of the RNZAF. From 2015 the Airtrainers began to leave service with the introduction of the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II, and from about March 2015 the School came under command of the re-introduced position of Base Commander Ohakea, with the disestablishment of No. 488 Wing.Stuff.co.nz, Spitfire display marks Air Force changes, 3 March 2015.

He was a proficient archer, winning the Edinburgh Arrow on two occasions, however it is for his golfing achievements that he is principally remembered. A skilful golfer, Rattray won the first competition organised by the Company of Gentleman Golfers (later the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers) to become the 'Captain of Goff' for a year. In this capacity he signed the first ever Rules of Golf.  Early life  John Rattray was born on 22 September 1707 in Craighall Castle, the family seat of Clan Rattray, near the village of Blairgowrie and Rattray in Perthshire, Scotland. His father the Rt Rev Thomas Rattray (1684–1743) was an Episcopalian priest who became the Bishop of Dunkeld, then of Brechin and was elected Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church.Rowan Strong, 'Rattray, Thomas, of Craighall (1684–1743)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2005 : doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/23166 On his death in 1743 his elder son James became clan chief and inherited the estate. As the second son John Rattray had no such inheritance and he trained as a surgeon in Edinburgh by apprenticeship to the surgeon John Semple between 1728 and 1735, when he began surgical practice in Edinburgh.Wallis PJ, Wallis R, Whittet T. Eighteenth century medics: subscriptions, licenses, apprenticeships. Newcastle. University of Newcastle. 1985 To enhance his professional status he applied to become a freeman (or fellow) of the Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh (later the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh). This involved sitting a series of four examinations which were held in the later months of 1740, and, having passed these, he was admitted a freeman of the Incorporation in November 1740.  Sporting activities  Rattray joined the Royal Company of Archers in 1731 and won the archery competition for the silver punch bowl on 4 occasions (1732, 1735, 1740, and 1742).Strachan CJL, Barker J, 'Rattray, John (1707–1771)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/64814 The Company's most prestigious prize, the Edinburgh Arrow or Silver Arrow was presented to the Company by Edinburgh Town Council in 1709 as a prize for an annual archery competition. Rattray won this twice, in 1735 and 1744. He was also a skilled golfer and his prowess at golf is recorded in this extract from the mock heroic poem 'The Goff' by Rev. Thomas Mathison (1720–1760) published in 1743, the first poem devoted to the sport of golf.Golf in Scotland. National Library of Scotland. http://digital.nls.uk/golf-in-scotland/book/ :North from Edina eight furlongs and more :Lies that fam’d field, on Fortha’s sounding shore, :Here Caledonian chiefs for health resort, :Confirm their sinews by the manly sport.... :Rattray for skill, and Crosse for strength renowned, :Stuart and Leslie beat the sandy ground.... :Yea here great Forbes, patron of the just, :The dread of villains and the good man’s trust :When spent with toils in serving human kind, :His body recreates and unbends his mind. The ‘fam’d field’ referred to is Leith Links, an area of links grassland in the burgh of Leith where the self-styled 'Company of Gentleman Golfers' began to golf regularly. The 'great Forbes' mentioned is Duncan Forbes of Culloden (1685–1747), Lord President of the Court of Session, Scotland's most senior law officer and one of Rattray's regular golfing companions.Hamilton D, Lindsley K, Mathison T. The thorn tree clique : a new analysis of Mathieson's poem The Goff. Kilmacolm : Partick Press, 2001 Their friendship was to save Rattray's life.  The first rules of golf  The Gentleman Golfers had approached the Edinburgh Town Council asking them to donate a silver club to be played for in an annual golf competition over Leith Links, in much the same way as the Council provided the silver arrow for archery competitions. The Town Council approved this request on 7 March 1744 and published the 'Regulations' for the competition. These were to do with the administration of the competition indicating that the draw should be made from a bonnet, that it should be open to any golfer from Great Britain & Ireland and that clerks should mark down each stroke. In their document the Council note that the golfers have already drawn up the 'Articles and Laws in playing at golf', and these, the original rules of golf, were used for this competition.Johnston AJ, Johnston JF. The chronicles of golf: 1457 to 1857. Cleveland, Ohio:AJ & JF Johnston; 1993. The competition was played over five holes at Leith Links: Sawmill (), North-mid (), East (), South-mid () and Thorntree (). It is likely that they played three rounds of this course.Clapcott CB. The early days of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers (1744–1764): some facts and conclusions relative thereto. National Library of Scotland; 1938 On 2 April 1744 Rattray won the first competition held over this course, winning the silver club and earning the title ‘Captain of the Goff’. It is Rattray’s signature that appears below the 13 original rules of golf recorded in the minute book of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. It is not clear whether he signed this in his capacity as captain of the golf or as the author of the rules. As was customary for entries in the minutes, he has written 'Cptn' after his signature, which some commentators have interpreted as indicating that he simply signed the minute as captain, the rules having been a joint effort of the golfers, who included some of the best legal brains in Scotland. The rules signed by Rattray lay undisturbed in the minute book of the Honourable Company for some 200 years until discovered there by the golf historian CB Clapcott in 1937. The rules are now in the collection of the National Library of Scotland. The St Andrews golfers, adopted them with minor modifications in 1754 and they still form the basis of many of the modern laws of the game. These original rules of golf comprised 12 general rules and one local rule applicable to the Leith course.  Role in the 1745 Jacobite rising  On 19 August 1745 Prince Charles Edward Stuart raised his standard at Glenfinnan marking the start of his attempt to claim the British throne. To gather support he asked clans and families, likely to be sympathetic, to join his cause. As prominent Episcopalians the Rattrays were likely supporters, but James Rattray, by then the clan chief, opted to donate £50 rather than join the standard. John Rattray joined the Jacobite army just after their victory at the Battle of Prestonpans on 21 September, when the call went out to Edinburgh surgeons to care for the wounded. Amongst those who responded to the call were Alexander Monro (a staunch Hanoverian) and Alexander (\\"Lang Sandy\\") Wood. Rattray rode the five miles from his house at South Foulis Close near the foot of Edinburgh's High Street with his colleague John Lauder, Deacon (president) of the Incorporation of Surgeons. Lauder later claimed that they had treated some 300 wounded and accommodated many of these at their own expense, but as this claim was made as part of a plea for his life, it may well have been exaggerated. Rattray stayed with the Jacobite army as it advanced into England then retreated from Derby, eventually becoming Surgeon-general and personal surgeon to Prince Charles. After the battle of Culloden, Rattray surrendered to the Hanoverians and was imprisoned in Inverness, but he and Lauder were not allowed to treat the wounded among their fellow prisoners.

Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press for the Scottish History Society; 1975 describes how Rattray was taunted by a Hanoverian officer \\"We know well what you are sir, the Pretender’s surgeon. If anyone hangs you shall.\\" Rattray's golfing companion Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden a staunch Hanoverian, made a personal plea of intercession on behalf of Rattray to the Duke of Cumberland, which was successful, as was a subsequent plea for Lauder. They were freed but Cumberland ordered that they be rearrested in Edinburgh and they were held in London until January 1747 when they were finally released having signed an oath of obedience to the King.  Later life  Rattray returned to surgical practice in Edinburgh and to golf. In 1751 he again won the golf competition for the silver club and continued to practice as a surgeon until at least 1766. He died in Edinburgh on 5 July 1771.  Statue on Leith Links  In 2013 the Leith Rules Golf Society obtained planning permission to erect a life size statue of John Rattray on Leith Links and commissioned the sculptor David Annand for the project. The bronze statue with three accompanying stones and plaques were unveiled on 11 September 2019. The statue is situated on a landscaped setting on the 1st hole of the original Golf Course on Leith Links to celebrate Rattray’s contribution to golf.

History The Puducherry railway line is one of the oldest rail link in India and it was constructed in the year 1879 by the Puducherry Railway Company during the period of French and British rule in India. Under the supervision of South Indian Railway with the object of connecting the town and the port of Puducherry with South India and to develop the resources of the Puducherry Territory, the rail link between Puducherry and Villupuram has been established. Even though there was total enmity between the then Super Powers—the French and the English—when it came to economic development they had a very good understanding and the Puducherry Railway system was a good example of it. The station is operated by the Southern Railway zone of the Indian Railways and comes under the Tiruchirapalli railway division. This Division may be the only Division in the world maintaining the Railways developed by both the British and the French empires. It has daily trains connecting the city with Chennai apart from non- daily trains towards prime cities including Mangaluru, Tiruchirapalli, Bengaluru, Kolkata, New Delhi, Bhubaneshwar and Mumbai via Villupuram. Location and Layout The Puducherry railway station is located on Subbiah Salai and is very close to several tourist spots and important locations in the city such as the Main Bus Stand (), Aurobindo Ashram (), Chief Secretariat Building (), and Puducherry Airport (). There are 3 platforms in the station for passenger traffic and one for the now defunct goods service. There have also been proposals for constructing 2 pit lanes in the station for train maintenance.

He also served as Congressman for the 3rd district of Pampanga from June 30, 2004 to June 30, 2007. From 2008 to 2011, Aquino also acted as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Philippine Health Insurance or PhilHealth. Voted as the Most Outstanding Mayor of the Philippines in 2002,Most outstanding Mayor of the Philippines the town of San Fernando was transformed into a city under Aquino’s reign through the ratification of Republic Act 8990.  Early life and career  Jesus Reynaldo B. Aquino was born at Barrio Baritan (known now as Barangay, Sta. Teresita), San Fernando, Pampanga. The fourth of five siblings, he grew up in a family with fairly modest means. His father Narciso was an employee of the Pampanga Sugar Development Company (PASUDECO), a local sugar processing company, and his mother, Aurora, had a shop in the market where she sold various garments and textiles. It is on this shop where he stayed on weekends to shine shoes for passersby to help augment the family’s income.  Education  Aquino received his Elementary Education at Don Bosco Academy, and his Secondary Education at University of the Assumption, respectively. At University of Santo Tomas (UST), Aquino finished both his bachelor's degree in Science – General, and Doctor of Medicine degree there. Aside from being ranked as a top ten student, Aquino also received the Model Student of the Year Award when he graduated high school at University of the Assumption for his active role in the school’s activities coupled with his excellent academic performance. While studying at UST, Aquino also garnered the leadership award for his ability to manage and organize events of great relevance to the university.  Medical career  Aquino first showed glimpses of his leadership capabilities when he was in San Luis Pampanga, a mostly rural town, at San Luis District Hospital to complete his student requirements for a six-month rural rotation. Aquino endeared himself there with the people of San Luis, and was instrumental in motivating the local townsfolk to help and contribute in the various community efforts that benefited the area (maintaining the cleanliness of the hospital, etc.). It was also in San Luis where he received the news that he passed the medical board exam. After obtaining his medical degree from UST, Aquino again chose to go back in his home province, Pampanga, to start his postgraduate internship at a hospital there – Central Luzon Regional Hospital (now named Jose B. Lingad Memorial Regional Hospital or JBL).  Political career  OIC and Vice-Mayor As the elected president of the Kiwanis and Jaycee clubs, Aquino was chosen and appointed as an Officer in Charge or OIC councilor in 1987. His tenure as OIC lasted for 2 months, and was his first real experience in politics. In 1992, Rosve Henson, who was running for mayor and an acquaintance of Aquino from the Kiwanis Club requested Aquino to be his running mate for vice-mayor in San Fernando. He eventually won, although Henson did not. Mayoralty (1995 – 2001) =1995= Aquino was mayor of San Fernando on three occasions, but his first bid in 1995 for the mayoralty that proved to be the most difficult. He was facing off against the then incumbent Mayor, Paterno “Pat” Guevarra, and other seasoned, better funded and more experienced politicians like Rosve Henson (his former running mate) and Mario Garcia. Surveys also consistently ranked him fourth behind the aforementioned opponents. However, his strong past performance as vice-mayor, the relentless campaigning of his wife, Edna, and Mario Garcia’s endorsement of him later in the campaign (when it was becoming apparent that he too would not win) would prove pivotal and crucial in his bid for the mayoralty. Aquino would later win the election by a mere 1,200 votes against the heavily favored Mayor Pat Guevarra. =1998 and 2001= In the 1998 and 2001 elections, Aquino squared off again with his old political rival and former San Fernando Mayor Pat Guevarra. This time however, he would go on to win quite easily and with substantially more votes on both occasions to retain the position of Mayor. Congress After his three terms as mayor of San Fernando, He ran for Congress in 2004 and won. President and CEO of PhilHealth On August 13, 2008, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo picked Aquino to be the president and CEO of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth), a tax- exempt, government owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) of the Philippines, which is attached to the Department of Health.  Trivia  * During his term as the mayor of San Fernando, Aquino lobbied for the cityhood of the then San Fernando town. Three hard years of nonstop campaigning in Congress and in the Senate to turn the 300-year-old town into a city eventually proved triumphant with the ratification of the Republic Act 8990. As a result of this, San Fernando’s yearly internal revenue budget significantly grew from P70 million to P 210 million. *Aquino saved San Fernando from further damage caused by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo and the subsequent lahar and flooding that followed by leading the Save San Fernando Foundation Incorporated (SSFI) which paved way for the construction of Megadike. * Aquino increased the flow of investments and employment in the City of San Fernando by allowing S.M. (Shoemart) to build a mall that will benefit Fernandinos in the long run. Robinsons Star Mills Pampanga soon followed thereafter owing to the strong reception received by SM City Pampanga. * Aquino was the last municipal mayor of San Fernando, and the first mayor in its conversion of becoming a city. * While he was vice-mayor, Aquino sought to make the Sangguniang Bayan (an assembly that passes ordinances and resolutions to the municipality) sessions more accessible and nearer to the masses by holding them in the barangay halls where more people can come and voice their opinions. * When he was in Congress, Aquino carried over the Project REY or Reading Excellence for the Youth from his last term as mayor. The program aimed at increasing the reading comprehension of young students, and to instill in them a love for reading and studying. * Aquino significantly grew the benefits of members of PhilHealth by up to 35 percent while he was CEO and president, the highest so far.Philhealth executive launches book about life as mayor and congressman.

Belgium also operates a consulate in Mumbai and Chennai. The Belgian ambassador to India is Francois Delhaye. Belgium had opened its embassy in India in 1947, just a few months after India's independence. Its first ambassador to India was Eugène, 11th Prince of Ligne. Website of Indian Embassy in Brussels The construction of the current embassy complex (seen in picture) was designed and managed by Satish Gujral, and completed in 1984. The design resembles a fortress of rocky outcrops. The building complex includes the administrative buildings of the embassy, chancellor's residence, ambassador's residence, and staff housing. The embassy was one of Satish Gujral's most challenging assignments, winning him national and international awards. In 2000, the building was recognised as one of the 1000 best buildings in the 19th century The embassy is located in New Delhi's diplomatic district in Chanakyapuri. The front facade consists of two large cupolas with a central fold above the entrance. The entrance opens into a courtyard with stone masonry and greenery within. The building is constructed with red bricks. The ubiquitous red brick construction of the building has been compared to early architectural forms prevalent in Mohenjo-daro and the buddhist architecture in Sanchi and Nalanda. Along with two other embassies, the post-modern architecture of the Belgian embassy in New Delhi has been critiqued by Roger Connah for its confusing appeal to pre-colonial glory of Delhi on one hand and the fading (British) empire on the other. Some parts of the building near the entrance are open to visitors, while the parts hosting the residence and the administrative blocks are not accessible to the public.

West has been a vocal advocate for increased diversity and inclusion at Uber, in tech, and in corporate C-suites generally.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/business/economy/corporate- boards-black-hispanic-directors.html Legal Momentum, the nation's first and oldest legal defense and education fund for women and girls, named West the 2020 Man of Distinction for advancing the rights of women and girls during his time at Uber.https://www.legalmomentum.org/news-events/women-achievement West previously served as the Associate Attorney General of the United States, the third highest-ranking official in the United States Department of Justice; and Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division, the largest litigating division in the Department of Justice. In September 2014, when Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to step down, West was speculated as being a potential successor as the next United States Attorney General. During his time at the department, West played an integral role in the administration's decision to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) after concluding that the statute was unconstitutional.Jonathan Capehart, \\"Tony West, straight hero in fight for gay marriage, to leave Justice Department\\", The Washington Post (September 14, 2014) West also secured nearly $37 billion for American consumers and investors harmed by the financial crisisBen Protess, \\"Tony West, Top Nemesis of Big Banks, Is Leaving Justice,\\", The New York Times, (September 3, 2014) and elevated the department's efforts to improve public safety in Indian country, including the landmark tribal provisions in the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).Sari Horwitz,\\"Tony West, third-ranking official at Justice Department, to step down,\\" The Washington Post, (September 3, 2014). On August 21, 2014, West secured a $16.65 billion settlement with Bank of America – the largest settlement with a single entity in American history – to resolve federal and state claims against Bank of America and its former and current subsidiaries, including Countrywide Financial Corporation and Merrill Lynch. Early life and education West was born in San Francisco, California, to Franklin and Peggy West. His father, the first person in his family to attend college, was born and raised in Georgia and worked for IBM while his mother, who was a teacher, was born and raised in Alabama. West was raised in San Jose, California, where he lived with his two younger sisters, Pamela and Patricia. He attended Bellarmine College Preparatory, a Catholic, all-male, private secondary school, where he served as freshman class president, before graduating in 1983. West received his Bachelor of Arts in government from Harvard College in 1987, where he served as publisher of the Harvard Political Review. In 1988, West began volunteering and working on political campaigns, engaging in Democratic political causes, such as working as the chief of staff to the Boston, Massachusetts treasurer of Michael Dukakis's presidential campaign. West also served as a finance director to the Democratic Governors Association, until 1989. He received his Juris Doctor from Stanford Law School in 1992, where he served as the President of the Stanford Law Review. While attending Stanford, he worked as a summer intern for Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman in 1990. He also worked as a summer intern for Tuttle & Taylor, and Morrison & Foerster in 1991. Career After graduating, West continued his work in Democratic politics, working as chief of staff to the finance chair of the California Democratic Party, while also working in private practice as an associate at the Bingham McCutchen San Jose office, from 1992 to 1993. In 1993, he joined the State Bar of California, and was admitted to the Superior Court of California and the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. From 1999 to 2001, he was a Special Assistant Attorney General in the Office of the California Attorney General, under Bill Lockyer. From 2001 to 2009, he was a litigation partner at Morrison & Foerster LLP in San Francisco. He also served as the California co-chairman of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. U.S. Department of Justice West began his career at the Justice Department when he joined the Clinton administration in 1993, as a Special Assistant under Philip Heymann, the Deputy Attorney General of the United States Department of Justice, until 1994, when he was appointed as an Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) for the Northern District of California. As an Assistant U.S. Attorney, West prosecuted child sexual exploitation, fraud, narcotics distribution, interstate theft, and high tech crime. =Civil Division= In 2009, West returned to the Justice Department when President Obama nominated him to serve as Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice Civil Division.White House, \\"President Barack Obama Announces Key DOJ Appointees\\" (Jan. 22, 2009). Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) West led the Obama Administration's review of the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which ultimately resulted in President Obama's and Attorney General Holder's decision to stop defending DOMA and paved the way for the Supreme Court's ruling that the Constitution guarantees the right to same-sex marriage.Jonathan Capehart, \\"Tony West, straight hero in fight for gay marriage, to leave Justice Department,\\", The Washington Post, (September 4, 2014)\\"Book: How Barack Obama, Eric Holder agreed on DOMA plan,\\" Politico (Apr. 18, 2014)Adam Liptak, \\"Same- Sex Marriage Is a Right, Supreme Court Rules, 5-4,\\", The New York Times, (June 26, 2015) Protecting Taxpayers and Consumers In addition to focusing on traditional areas of the Civil Division's work, West helped the department further its most important priority – protecting national security. He also bolstered the division's affirmative civil enforcement efforts in areas such as health care fraud, mortgage fraud, and procurement fraud to recover taxpayer money lost to fraud and abuse, resulting in unprecedented monetary recoveries. During his tenure at the helm of the Civil Division, the Division recovered more than $8.8 billion in taxpayer money under the False Claims Act—the largest three-year total in history at the time of West's departure from the Division.\\"Holder Taps Tony West For DOJ's No. 3 Spot,\\" Law360 (February 27, 2012). On the consumer protection front, West oversaw cases that resulted in more than 115 criminal convictions, as well as recoveries of more than $3.5 billion, during his three-year tenure.Id. Preemption Lawsuits Challenging State Immigration Laws West was personally involved in the department's preemption lawsuits challenging immigration laws passed in Arizona, Alabama, South Carolina, and Utah. The department's core arguments—that each of the states' immigration laws is constitutionally preempted, because it is the federal government and not the states that is vested with the primary authority and the primary responsibility in immigration matters—ultimately prevailed in the Supreme Court. =Associate Attorney General= Tony West speaks at the Department of Justice in 2013 Beginning on March 9, 2012, West served as the Acting Associate Attorney General until the U.S. Senate confirmed West to be Associate Attorney General in a 98-1 vote on July 25, 2013. In 2014, Mr. West was awarded the department's highest award, the Edmund J. Randolph Award. The Award, named for the first Attorney General of the United States, appointed by President George Washington, recognizes outstanding contributions to the accomplishments of the department's mission. Financial Fraud As Associate Attorney General, West led the department's efforts to combat financial fraud, securing record- breaking civil penalties and large global civil settlements against financial institutions in connection with their roles in precipitating the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. These include two of the largest civil resolutions against a single entity in American history: Bank of America ($16.65 billion) and JPMorgan ($13 billion).Id. In total, West's efforts recovered nearly $37 billion for American consumers and investors harmed by the financial crisis. With each settlement, along with landmark monetary penalties, Mr. West has insisted on a robust statement of facts outlining each institution's conduct, as well as meaningful consumer relief to assist homeowners across the country who are still struggling to recover from the financial crisis. Additionally, Mr. West led the department's investigation and filing of a civil lawsuit against the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's Rating Services for allegedly engaging in a scheme to defraud investors in structured financial products, resulting in the loss of billions of dollars by investors, many of whom are federally-insured financial institutions. The investigation and lawsuit involved collaboration with several state attorneys general offices, a number of which also filed civil fraud lawsuits against S&P; alleging similar misconduct in the rating of structured financial products. Civil and Constitutional Rights As Associate Attorney General, West continued his commitment to upholding the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans, particularly in the areas of constitutional policing, indigent defense, and voting rights. West led the department's engagement with state, local, and tribal law enforcement on variety of issues, particularly strengthening the relationship between law enforcement and communities of color. Through the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office, Mr. West promoted collaborative reform efforts that allowed the Department to work with local law enforcement who were committed to instituting constitutional policing policies and procedures. West also oversaw constitutional policing enforcement actions by the Civil Rights Division and personally led the department's negotiations with Puerto Rico to reach a historic agreement that requires the Commonwealth's police department to implement and sustain a wide range of constitutional policies and procedures, including those that address use of force, equal protection and non-discrimination, and community engagement. West also led the department's commitment to supporting the provision of indigent legal defense. In June 2014, West represented the United States at the U.N.’s International Conference on Access to Legal Aid in the Criminal Justice Systems in South Africa. In 2013, West oversaw the department’s unprecedented filing of a statement of interest in Wilbur v. City of Mount Vernon (WD Wash.), a class action lawsuit alleging that accused defendants were systemically denied effective assistance of counsel. Without taking a position on the merits of the case, the filing requested that if the court found constitutional violations, it consider workload controls for public defenders and appointment of an independent monitor to ensure compliance. The plaintiffs in the case prevailed on the merits and the court required defendants to hire a part-time public defender supervisor to monitor and report the defendants’ delivery of indigent defense representation. West was also one of the department's primary spokespersons on voting rights, overseeing the Civil Rights Division's work to protect access to the ballot box. In 2014, in an address to the Progressive National Baptist Convention, Mr. West said, \\"Our message is unequivocal: we will use every legal tool that remains available to us, against any jurisdiction that seeks to hinder eligible citizens’ full and free right to vote. When we see something that causes us concern, we won't hesitate to make it plain.\\" In June 2014, West detailed Department plans to consult with tribes on a recommendation to Congress that would require election officials whose territory includes part of an Indian reservation or Alaska Native village to ensure at least one polling place is located in an area selected by the tribal government. \\"[I]t is a tragic irony that in this country—history's greatest democratic experiment—it is First Americans who, for a variety of reasons, have, for decades, too often been deprived the right vote,\\" West said in discussing the proposal. \\"Standing by as Native voices, for whatever reason, are shut out of the democratic process is not an option.\\" Indian Country West championed tribal sovereignty and improved the federal government's relationship with Native American communities through meaningful and frequent engagement, particularly in the areas of public safety, intimate partner violence, children's exposure to violence in Indian country, and voting rights. With his leadership and efforts to raise awareness of about the alarmingly high rate of violence against women in Indian country, the Department secured passage of tribal provisions in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, allowing tribes—for the first time in decades—to prosecute non-Indian perpetrators of domestic violence in Indian country. West oversaw the extensive but expedited consultation with tribes to implement the Pilot Project, which allowed tribes to exercise the special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians ahead of the law's March 2015 effective date. West authorized three tribes – the Pascua Yaqui Tribe of Arizona, the Tulalip Tribes of Washington, and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation – to become the first tribes in the country to exercise the new jurisdiction. Mr. West also oversaw the creation and work of the Attorney General's Task Force on American Indian/Alaska Native Children Exposed to Violence, which included an Advisory Committee—chaired by Senator Byron Dorgan—of non-federal experts and an interagency Federal Working Group of high-level federal officials. PepsiCo On October 7, 2014, PepsiCo, Inc. announced that West had joined the company as executive vice president of government affairs, general counsel and corporate secretary, effective November 24, 2014. West succeeded Larry Thompson, who retired after almost a decade of service. West was responsible for PepsiCo's worldwide legal function and government affairs organization, as well as the company's global compliance function and the PepsiCo Foundation. He reported to PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi. In addition to supporting the growth and sustainability of PepsiCo's global business for its shareholders, West focused on promoting an ethical and inclusive culture at PepsiCo. While at PepsiCo, West elevated the Legal Department's commitment to diversity in the legal profession. In 2016, West launched the Larry Thompson Fellowship Program, a summer program for 1Ls dedicated to diversifying the profession. West also committed PepsiCo to implementing ABA Resolution 113, requiring its outside counsel to submit the ABA's Model Survey on diversity, and using the diversity metrics in the surveys as a factor when selecting outside counsel. In 2017, PepsiCo used the diversity metrics collected in the ABA survey to generate a diversity index score and recognize firms with scores above the median and demonstrated an exceptional commitment to diversity through qualitative efforts. PepsiCo's outside counsel selection policy also requires its lawyers to obtain approval from the PepsiCo General Counsel before engaging a firm with a below-median diversity index score. West also prioritized promoting an ethical culture at PepsiCo, which has named as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere every year since the list's inception in 2007. Asked why an ethical culture is important at PepsiCo, West responded, \\"[C]orporations increasingly are being looked to by society to help resolve large problems. Big problems. Part of that is not just because companies have resources, because companies operate in societies, operate in communities, not as a matter of right, but because they earn a social license in which to operate on. Earning that social license to operate is something that doesn’t happen automatically. Companies have to actually gain the trust of communities. They have to make sure they are bringing value to the social ecosystem in which they’re operating, and that can only happen if they are operating with a core of sustainable, ethical business practices.\\" Uber In October 2017, West announced that he was leaving PepsiCo to take a position as General Counsel at Uber. This announcement shortly followed the completion of an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. Political campaigns In 1998, West ran for a seat on the San Jose City Council. In the primary, West's main challenger was Cindy Chavez, the staff director of Working Partnerships USA. He came in second to Chavez in the June 2 primary, with 41.2% of the vote. West was ultimately defeated, receiving 48% of the vote in the general election. West also ran for the California State Assembly, for the 23rd district, in 2000. After incumbent Mike Honda ran for the U.S. House of Representatives, leaving a vacancy, West was one of six Democrats to run for the open seat. He was defeated in the primary by San Jose City Councilman Manny Diaz, receiving 38% of the total votes cast. On November 30, 2016, Senator-elect Kamala Harris announced that West, her brother-in-law, would co- chair her transition team. Personal life West married Maya Harris, MSNBC political analyst and lawyer, in July 1998. Maya and Tony were both in the class of 1992 at Stanford Law School. Maya and Tony became friends, but did not begin a relationship until after graduation.

It is located between the Santa Inés Island and the Clarence Island and ends at the Otway Bay, having the same entrance into the Pacific as Cockburn Channel, runs in a north direction along the west side of Clarence Island. The United States Hydrographic Office, South America Pilot (1916) states: :Barbara Channel, leading into Magellan Strait at English Reach, has its southern entrance so encumbered with islands and rocks that no one direct channel can be specially recommended, and the chart must be referred to as the best guide for its navigation. For small vessels there is neither danger nor difficulty; and there are numerous anchorages that they may reach without trouble. The rocks off the entrance of this channel should be passed only during daylight and in clear weather, so that a vessel may be steered more by a good eye at the masthead than by any chart. Four remarkable mountains point out the entrance distinctly. The peaks on Kempe Island are high and show three points. The peaks on Fury Island are high and divided. Mount Skyring is high and has a single peak. Mount St. Paul, from near Fury Island, appears like the dome of the cathedral, the name of which it bears. The Channel separates Clarence Island from Santa Ines, the next large island west of it, and is about 38 miles long from Magill Islands in the Pacific to Charles Islands in Magellan Strait. Hewett Bay is the first anchorage on the western shore of the southern entrance of Barbara Channel; there is anchorage in 9 fathoms in its north part. The anchorage is smaller than shown on the chart Between Hewett and Nort Bay the channel is so strewed with rocks and shoals, some only showing at half tide, that much caution is necessary in its navigation; all patches of kelp should be avoided. A submerged rock lies about ) mile 158 from the islet located between Mortimer Island and the island eastward of Hewett Bay. The tidal currents are much stronger to the northward of Nort Bay than to the southward. The country hereabouts has a more agreeable appearance, being better wooded with beech and cypress trees.

Her dates of birth and death are disputed, though it is believedGASCONY, Medieval Lands that she was born soon after the marriage of her parents in 1228 and died after she claimed Bigorre in 1283. She was suo jure Viscountess of Marsan, which she inherited from her father. Life Martha was the third child of her mother, her second marriage to Guy de Montfort had produced two half-sisters, Alice, who would go on to succeed their mother and a second Petronilla who was married to Raoul de la Roche-Tesson. Petronilla made a testament soon after the birth of Martha, so that Alice would inherit her title of Countess of Bigorre. Whilst Martha, would inherit the title of Viscountess of Marsen from her father.Merlet ´Procès´, Pièces Justificatives, I, p. 314, quoting Cartulaire de Bigorre, ch. 39. Between 1245 and 1250, Martha married Gaston VII, Viscount of Béarn, the couple had four daughters: * Constance (died 1310), succeeded in Marsan and Bigorre. Married firstly, on 23 March 1260, to the Aragonese infante Alfonso, son of James the Conqueror, who died 26 March; married secondly, on 15 May 1269, to Henry of Almain, son of Richard of Cornwall; and married thirdly, in 1279, to Aymon II of Geneva * Margaret, succeeded in Béarn. Married, in 1252, to Roger-Bernard III de Foix * Martha, married Gerald VI, Count of Armagnac in 1260 * Guillelme(or Guillemette; died 1309), affianced in 1270 to Sancho IV of Castile, annulled 1281; married, in 1291, to the Aragonese infante Peter (1275-1296), son of Peter III of Aragon. Upon the death of Countess Petronilla in 1251, Alice should have succeeded her. However, before Petronilla's death, she had handed control of the government over to Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, who interpreted the act as a gift and so did not allow Alice to claim her inheritance.Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la lecture, 2nd Edition, Vol.3, Ed. William Duckett, (Aux Comptoirs de la Direction, 1856), 200. Martha did inherit her title as Viscountess upon the deaths of her parents. Alice appealed to Martha and Gaston for help in claiming her inheritance, the couple sent Alice military support and forced De Montfort to abandon his claims, returning to England soon after. Alice ruled as countess for four years and died in 1255. She was succeeded by her son, Eskivat de Chabanais. However, Martha's nephew made the mistake of keeping land that she had in Bigorre. Gaston VII then invaded the county, forcing Eschivat to defend it, seeking alliances with the English and Roger IV, Count of Foix.Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la lecture, 2nd Edition, Vol.3, Ed. William Duckett, Aux Comptoirs de la Direction, 1856. In 1258, war resumed in the region and Eschivat agreed to temporarily surrender the County of Bigorre to Simon de Montfort, this time to end the conflict. In doing so, he committed the same mistake as his grandmother, because Simon refused to return the county. Soon after, Simon de Montfort rebelled against King Henry III of England, and Eschivat helped Gaston VII and Martha regain Bigorre. He died in 1283, without children. After the death on Eschivat, Martha and her niece by Alice, named Laura, both made claim for Bigorre. This dispute would continue long after the death of Martha, the claims being passed onto her own daughters and their descendants. Following Martha's death, there was a succession dispute amongst her husband and four daughters with Margaret eventually succeeding him. Constance inherited the title of Viscountess from Martha.Merlet ´Procès´, Pièces Justificatives, XIV, p. 322, quoting Cartulaire de Bigorre, ch. 36.

Usage  The term Dienstmann first surfaced in the Middle Ages as a Germanicization of the Latin word ministerialis,Thompson, p. 470. for men, who served at a court and, in the course of time, were raised to be armigers with a social status similar to that of free knights (Ritter).

Renshaw and Edwards were exposed in 1992 for committing New Zealand’s largest fraud by a law firm. In a bizarre situation, unbeknown to each other, not one, but both of the law partners were stealing money from the same firm. Millions of dollars of gambling with the TAB was blamed for the fraud. The Aftermath The New Zealand Law Society Fidelity Fund, which was legally liable for the losses, found the losses so high that they had to take the unprecedented step to impose a special levy of $10,000 on its 2,800 senior solicitors to reimburse the $29 million paid to the 400+ victims of the fraud. Renshaw was later sentenced to 7 years on 42 charges, whilst Edwards was sentenced to 6 years on 51 charges. Both, however, were released from prison after serving less than 3 years.Some Renshaw Edwards claims still in dispute, The Dominion, 10 Dec 1997, accessed 2 October 2016Property crime - White-collar-crime victims, Te Ara – The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, accessed 2 October 2016 The fraud also resulted in numerous other lawsuits against the Law Society, other law firms, and even the TAB. In October 2015, Patrick John Renshaw, 68, tax advisor of Lower Hutt, again appeared before the courts and pleaded guilty to 42 charges of aiding and abetting offences, most of them for not paying PAYE tax deductions for employees of his own company. He was given home detention for tax fraud of nearly $347,000. Other charges included attempting to claim false GST refunds for four companies, and filing a false income tax return for himself and one company between January 2010 and November 2012.

Career Lhermite started sailing at the age of eight in the merchant navy, steadily rising in rank until he was promoted to captain in 1787. He joined the French Navy in 1793 as a Lieutenant, serving on Tigre.Levot, p. 314 Within a year, he was promoted to Captain and served as flag officer to rear-admiral Van Stabel. In 1794, Lhermite was appointed to Gasparin and took part in the Croisière du Grand Hiver under rear-admiral Renaudin.Levot, p. 315 Gasparin returned to harbour without major damage. In the following years, Lhermite undertook missions in Dunkirk, Rotterdam and Vlissingen, and organise the commissioning of a naval division in the Netherlands, bound for Santo Domingo to ferry troops. Lhermite then took command of the frigate Poursuivante in this division, on which he cruised the Caribbean.Troude, vol.3, p.270 In Santo Domingo, he took command of the 74-gun Duguay-Trouin, on which he recaptured Petit-Goâve from the Haitian Revolutionaries, destroying her harbour and the village of Arcahaie afterwards. After the collapse of the Treaty of Amiens in May 1803 and the outbreak of the War of the Third Coalition in May 1803, Lhermite was sent to France. He had to run the British Blockade of Saint- Domingue, and was chased by HMS Elephant while sailing off Cap-Haïtien.Troude, vol.3, p.294 During her cruise, Duguay-Trouin ran aground in Jérémie and was refloated only by throwing 20 of her guns overboard, reducing her armament to 58 guns. On 25 July, Duguay-Trouin was attacked by a British ship of the line, which retreated when the frigate Guerrière came in sight. Lhermite, his armament diminished and fearing a ruse to lure him into a trap, decided against chasing the British ship. Duguay-Trouin and Guerrière continued together. On 30 August, off Finistere, they met the frigate HMS Boadicea; identifying the French ships as returning from Haiti, and with the knowledge that such ships were often armed en flûte and stricken with yellow fever, Boadicea decided to attack and approached under a French flag. However, Duguay-Trouin manoeuvered to intercept, and Boadicea fled after firing a broadside. On 2 September, Duguay-Trouin and Guerrière were chased by the division under Edward Pellew, and sought refugee in A Coruña.Troude, vol.3, p.295 Guerrière came under fire and was damaged and her captain, Commander Louis Alexis Baudoin, was wounded. From 1805 to 1808, Lhermite was in command of Genoa harbour and of the 74-gun . He took part in expeditions to supply Corfu in the squadron of Vice-Admiral Ganteaume. In 1809, he was appointed to the 74-gun , in the Escaut squadron; later that year, he was promoted to Rear- Admiral but maintained in command of Albanais and supported Missiessy during his two battles with the Royal Navy during the Walcheren Campaign. In Missiessy's absence, he replaced him and acted as préfet maritime and overall commander of the French naval forces in the North Sea. In 1814, at the Bourbon Restoration, Lhermite was inactivated. He was briefly reinstated préfet maritime of Dunkirk during the Hundred Days, but was again inactivated at the Second Bourbon Restoration. He retired in 1816.

Irish racehorse best known for winning the Nakayama Grand Jump in 2013. He is the first horse trained in Europe to win the race. Background Blackstairmountain is a dark-coated bay gelding with a white star bred in Ireland by Mrs J M Mullins. His sire Imperial Ballet was a winner of the Royal Hunt Cup and a son of Sadler's Wells. He has proved a versatile stallion: apart from Blackstairmountain, his most significant winner has been the sprinter Imperial Beauty, the winner of the Prix de l'Abbaye. The gelding, who is named after Blackstairs Mountain in Leinster is owned by Susannah Ricci and trained by Willie Mullins at Muine Beag, County Carlow. Racing career Blackstairmountain began his racing career in 2009, when he won National Hunt Flat races at Thurles and Tipperary and a conventional flat race at Galway Racecourse. In the following year, he competed in hurdle races and recorded his first major success when taking the Grade I Evening Herald Champion Novice Hurdle at the Punchestown Festival in May. After the race, Mullins explained that the horse had been particularly well-suited by the firm ground. Blackstairmountain failed to win in five hurdle races in the 2010/2011 National Hunt season before being campaigned in steeplechases. He began promisingly, winning the Grade I Racing Post Novice Chase on his second appearance over larger obstacles, but he failed to maintain his form and finished fifth of the six runners in the Arkle Challenge Trophy at the Cheltenham Festival, beaten thirty-six lengths by Sprinter Sacre. In the summer of 2012, Blackstairmountain won two minor flat races at Bellewstown before returning to jump racing in autumn. In the 2012/2013 National Hunt season he won a handicap hurdle at Cork Racecourse in January before being sent to Japan in March. On his Japanese debut he made no impression as he finished ninth behind Rikiai Kurofune in the Pegasus Jump at Nakayama Racecourse. On 13 April Blackstairmountain, ridden by Ruby Walsh started a 25/1 outsider for the Nakayama Grand Jump, the world's richest steeplechase. He took the lead at the final fence and held off a late challenge from Rikiai Kurofune to win by half a length. Mullins later revealed that he had been planning an attempt on the race for a decade, and that it had taken him \\"a few years to find a horse good enough\\".

However, not content with just surviving and avoiding capture, these Americans formed resistance groups, which were soon recognized by the American military, and eventually supplied. Initially relegated to an intelligence gathering role, these groups eventually took a more active and aggressive role, such that they were an integral part of the American re-conquest of the country.

The siege resulted with a decisive Ottoman victory and Temesvár came under Ottoman control for 164 years.  Background  After the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the Hungarian Kingdom split into two parts. The western part of the country came under the control of Ferdinand I from the House of Habsburg, the eastern side came under the control of John Zápolya, a Hungarian noble. Zápolya asked the help of Suleiman the Magnificent Ottoman emperor against Ferdinand. After the death of John in 1540, he was succeeded by his one-month-old son, John Sigismund Zápolya. Ferdinand in 1541 tried to capture Buda, the capital, but he was defeated by Suleiman's army. The Ottoman emperor occupied Buda after the victory and sent the young Hungarian king with his court to Lippa (today Lipova, Romania); in 1542 they moved to Gyulafehérvár (today Alba Iulia, Romania), which later became the capital of the Principality of Transylvania. Even after this event, Ferdinand didn't give up his dream about the unification of the Hungarian Kingdom under his rule. With George Martinuzzi's help, the eastern part of the country in 1550 came under Habsburg rule, which caused the attack of the Ottoman army against Hungary. In 1552 two Ottoman armies crossed the border into the Hungarian Kingdom. One of them – led by Hadim Ali Pasha – started a campaign against the western and central part of the country whilst the second army – led by Kara Ahmed Pasha – attacked the fortresses in the Banat region.  The siege  In the summer of 1552, the Ottomans arrived at Temesvár, which was the most important city in the Banat region. The Ottoman army numbered about 30,000 men, Temesvár was defended only by 1,900 men, 700 of whom were merchants. The Ottoman artillery started destroying the wall on 27 June, then the Ottoman infantry assaulted the wall on 3 July and 6 July, without any success. At the time of the battle, a Hungarian army led by Mihály Tóth tried to liberate the city under the siege, but his army was defeated in the battle of Szentandrás (today Sânandrei, Romania). The city fell soon after.  Aftermath  After the capture of Temesvár, the sultan established the Temeşvar Eyalet which was composed of four sanjaks. Temesvár remained under Ottoman control even after the Treaty of Karlowitz and was recaptured by the Christian forces only in 1717.

A specialist steeplechaser, he has won fifteen of his thirty-three races, including nine at Grade I level. He was a leading performer in National Hunt flat races, winning the Champion Bumper at the Cheltenham Festival. He was less successful over hurdles but emerged as a top-class performer when tried over larger obstacles. He won the Haldon Gold Cup, Ascot Chase and Ryanair Chase in the 2012/2013 National Hunt season and the Betfair Chase in the 2013/2014 season. He went through the 2014/2015 campaign winless but after a wind-operation over the 2015 summer, he returned in the following season to record his second win in the Betfair Chase and won the King George VI Chase at the fourth attempt. He fell when in contention in the 2016 Cheltenham Gold Cup but returned to winning form with victory on his next start in the Betfred Bowl. Background Cue Card is a bay gelding with a white star bred by Roland Crellin at Brookfarm, Penhow. He is one of many successful National Hunt horses sired by the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner King's Theatre. As a yearling, Cue Card was sent to the sales in February 2007 and was bought for €75,000 by Aiden Murphy. He returned to the sales as a gelding in June 2009, and was sold to Aidan Kennedy for €52,000. Cue Card is trained by Colin Tizzard at Milborne Port in Dorset and owned by Mrs Jean Bishop. He has been ridden in all of his races to date by his trainer's son Joe Tizzard but, following Tizzard's decision to retire in 2014, Daryl Jacob will take over in the saddle for the 2014–2015 National Hunt Season. From the 2015–2016 seasons onwards he has been partnered by Paddy Brennan. Racing career National Hunt flat races Cue Card began his racing career in National Hunt Flat races, or \\"bumpers\\". After winning on his debut at Fontwell Park Racecourse in February 2010, he was sent to the Cheltenham Festival to contest the Grade One Champion Bumper. He started a 40/1 outsider, but won easily by eight lengths from Al Ferof. Hurdles In the following season, Cue Card was campaigned in Novice hurdle races and won two of his five races including the Grade II Sharp Novices' Hurdle at Cheltenham. At the Cheltenham Festival he started 7/4 favourite for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle but finished fourth behind Al Ferof, Spirit Son and Sprinter Sacre. Steeplechases =2011/2012 season= In the 2011/2012 season, Cue Card raced in Novice chases. His two wins of the season came at Chepstow Racecourse in October, and at Newbury Racecourse in December when he won the Halloe'en Trophy by four lengths. He was beaten a short head when attempting to concede seven pounds to Bobs Worth in the Berkshire Novices' Chase and finished second to Sprinter Sacre in the Arkle Challenge Trophy. =2012/2013 season= Cue Card began his next season in the Grade II Haldon Gold Cup at Exeter Racecourse. Competing against more experienced chasers he started the 5/6 favourite and won impressively by twenty-six lengths. He was then moved up in class and distance for the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park Racecourse on Boxing Day, but after making mistakes at the first two fences he tired in the closing stages and finished fifth behind Long Run. In February, Cue Card won the Grade I Ascot Chase, beating Captain Chris by six lengths: he led for most of the race and was never in danger of defeat after the runner-up made a \\"terrible blunder\\" at the final fence. At the Cheltenham Festival, Tizzard opted to run Cue Card in the two and a half mile Ryanair Chase, rather than taking on Sprinter Sacre in the two mile Queen Mother Champion Chase. Starting at odds of 7/2, Cue Card led from the start and won by nine lengths from the Irish- trained favourite First Lieutenant. On his final appearance of the season, Cue Card finished four and a half lengths second to Sprinter Sacre in the Melling Chase at Aintree. =2013/2014 season= On Cue Card's first appearance of the new season he was made odd-on favourite to repeat his 2012 win in the Haldon Gold Cup. Carrying top weight of 164 pounds he finished third behind Somersby, a Grade I winner who was carrying 147. On 23 November, Cue Card contested an exceptionally strong renewal of the Betfair Chase at Haydock Park and started at odds of 9/1 against a field which included Bobs Worth, Long Run, Tidal Bay and Silviniaco Conti. He took the lead at the fourth fence and was never headed, turning back the challenges of Silviniaco Conti and Dynaste before drawing away in the final stages to win by four and a half lengths. After the race, Joe Tizzard called the winner \\"a real Gold Cup horse\\", while a visibly emotional Colin Tizzard said \\"Cue Card jumped better than he ever has. He was on his game today, that's for sure.\\" Cue Card started 100/30 joint- favourite with Dynaste for the King George VI Chase in which he led from the start and looked the likely winner when going clear of the field entering the straight. After jumping the second last fence he began to tire and was overtaken by Silviniaco Conti, finishing second by three and a half lengths. Cue Card was aimed at the Cheltenham Festival with the Gold Cup, Ryanair Chase and Champion Chase being considered as possible targets. On 25 February, Colin Tizzard announced that the gelding appeared to have sustained a muscle injury to his back and would miss Cheltenham. Subsequent x-ray examinations revealed that the gelding had in fact sustained a stress fracture to his pelvis, ruling him out for the rest of the season. =2014/2015 season= Cue Card returned for the 2014/2015 season but failed to win in five races. On his return after his long absence he finished fourth when favourite for the Haldon Gold Cup and then finished behind Silviniaco Conti in both the Lancashire Chase and the King George VI Chase. He missed the 2015 Cheltenham Festival but returned in April for the Melling Chase. After leading until the third last he had no chance with the winner Don Cossack but stayed on well in the closing stages to hold on to second place. On his final appearance of the season he was sent to Ireland for the first time and finished fourth behind Don Cossack in the Punchestown Gold Cup. =2015/2016 season= On 31 October 2015 Cue Card made his seasonal reappearance in the Grade 2 Charlie Hall Chase with his trainer Colin Tizzard reporting he had solved the problems with a trapped epiglottis of which Cue Card suffered in the previous season, and duly obliged by returning to winning ways first time in almost two years winning by three- quarter lengths from a smart performer in Dynaste. He followed up three weeks later with winning the first step of the Stayers Chase Triple Crown and at the same time regaining the Betfair Chase from the last year winner Silviniaco Conti which had set a solid pace but faltered on the run-in with Cue Card finishing 7 lengths in front of him at the line. On Boxing Day 2015 Cue Card continued his improved form of the season and displayed a career best performance to take the King George VI Chase where a strong field was assembled, representing almost all form lines of the early season in staying graded races, including the winner of the Hennessy Gold Cup. Cue Card settled in the middle of the pack for most part of the race and only started to make ground on the front-runner Vautour —one of the leading novice chasers of the last season— in the back straight with the latter setting up a solid pace upfront. The two were left clear by the second last fence at which the favourite Don Cossack fell and an exciting battle began after the last with Cue Card catching Vautour with every stride. The pair finished in a photo finish and Cue Card was soon announced as the winner of the 65th King George VI Chase. His next race was after a three months break being sent straight for the Cheltenham Gold Cup in which he was bidding for the Stayers Chase Triple Crown £1 million bonus. He started the second favourite behind Don Cossack, in a field which also included the 2014 and 2015 Gold Cup runners-up Djakadam and On His Own and also the 2015 Hennessy Gold Cup winner, Smad Place. In the race he travelled comfortably and was kept in touch of the leaders who were going a strong pace upfront. He was still in contention at third fence from home when he made a jumping error and took a heavy fall. Cue Card bounced back in the Betfred Bowl Chase at Aintree a few weeks later when going off the odds on favourite, he was an impressive winner with Don Poli in second and Djakadam in third. His last appearance of the season came at Punchestown three weeks later on 27 April when again he was the odds on favourite. However, he could only manage fourth place to Carlingford Lough who won the Punchestown Gold Cup at 12/1. =2016/2017 season= On 29 October, Cue Card made his seasonal debut in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby and was sent off the odds on favourite. Disappointingly, he was only third to Irish Cavalier who won at 16/1. Cue Card's second reappearance was in the Betfair Chase at Haydock on 19 November when he beat Coneygree by an impressive 15 lengths.http://www.skysports.ie/racing/results/full-result/752822/haydock- park/19-11-2016/betfair-chase =2017/2018 season= On 15 March, Cue Card was pulled up in the Ryanair Chase at the Cheltenham Festival. Trainer Colin Tizzard said that there would be no immediate decision of whether the horse would now be retired.

Patients have the right to request the masking of their personal information, making it inaccessible to any physician, or a particular physician, unless a specific reason is provided. Data masking is also performed by healthcare agencies to restrict the amount of information that can be accessed by external bodies such as researchers, health insurance agencies and unauthorised individuals. It is a method used to protect patients’ sensitive information so that privacy and confidentiality are less of a concern. Techniques used to alter information within a patient’s EHR include data encryption, obfuscation, hashing, exclusion and perturbation. Confidentiality The increased access that transpires from introducing EHR's is seen as a large concern to some patients. Masking information is a technique that contributes to establishing the confidentiality of EHR's, as a large amount of sensitive information is contained within these records. History of health outcomes such as drug/alcohol abuse, sexually transmitted infections or abortion during pregnancy are known to lead to social discrimination and cause social harm to the patient, hence the importance of protecting the content within EHR's. Masking limits the access that internal and external individuals can have to a particular record, increasing the protection of its contents. When patients apply for masking of their EHR, health services must meet their needs and alter the system accordingly so that unauthorised individuals can't gain access. Patient Masking Requests :To increase security of their EHR's, patients can elect to mask their information by signing a form provided by the health service. It is necessary that health services with EHR software notify and educate their patients of data masking capabilities and the advantages and disadvantages of the process. In submitting a request, patients are given the control to specify the physicians and health service staff members that are provided with consent and the right to access their record. Health services must abide by patient masking requests under the Health Records Act and implement data masking techniques within the EHR technology, otherwise major consequences can result. In addition, audit trails can be implemented by health services to track and identify which individuals have accessed a patients EHR over a certain time period. Unmasking In patient care, authorised users have the ability to override masking and access restrictions under emergency circumstances. If a patient is in a critical health state and treatment is urgently required, physicians are provided with the right to access all required information within the EHR. This mechanism is known as \\"breaking the glass.\\" Any unmasking of a patient's EHR is audited, and a sufficient reason for access is generally required.  EHR Data Masking Techniques  Masking refers to sets of alterations and changes made to protect information within the confines of Electronic health records. Not only is masking performed at a patients request, it is a common method used to assist in the conduction of clinical and epidemiological research. It reduces confidentiality and privacy concerns associated with supplying information to external bodies. In general, direct identifiers are removed from the dataset, replaced with random values, changed using the hashing function, or restored with a unique key. Mechanisms as such are expanded on under the following headings.  Encryption  :Encryption is often the most complex form of data masking, although it is a relatively safe and secure method. It involves inserting a password or key to grant an individual access to view certain data. Only permitted users are provided with a password and therefore have the capacity to recover sensitive information included within an EHR. When the system requests data masking of an EHR, access is extremely difficult and time-consuming for hackers or unauthorized users, as they do not possess the unique code that will decrypt the data.  Data Obfuscation  :Data obfuscation limits the sharing of highly sensitive health information within an Electronic health record by scrambling particular data elements to prevent unauthorized access. The technique doesn’t physically mark data; it alters data to avoid detection from external network systems. Data obfuscation is commonly used as it increases anonymity and preserves relationships within a dataset that would often be destroyed in more rigorous forms of masking. Use of methods as such is most evident in interrelated numeric data such as addresses or dates. For example, in research epidemiologists may be interested in accessing highly specific location data to correlate patterns of diseases within particular neighborhoods and cities. However, finding clusters of poor health outcomes don’t require knowledge of actual patient addresses, it simply requires relationships between patient addresses. As a result, data extraction for the study may translate addresses into another metric that preserves locations without revealing the actual physical location.  Data Perturbation  :In data perturbation alterations are made to either input databases or the query results returned. Data perturbation involves preserving aggregate trends in the original data while removing and modifying the actual data. For example, clinical data can be swapped between EHR's, preserving the existing values in a field but eliminating the specific mapping between fields of a record. Random “noise” can also be added the data, maintaining the statistical properties of a field while randomly altering exact values within a particular EHR. Data perturbation has been hailed as one of the most effective data protection techniques, whilst being relatively simple to implement.  Data Exclusion  :Data exclusion involves the removal of specific data elements to restrict them from being accessed. The process involves often removing an EHR entirely from the system (at patients request) or removing specific sections of a patients record. This method of masking provides the highest level of confidentiality; however, continuity of care can be significantly affected in some cases. In addition, data exclusion from EHR’s is most commonly applied for when external researchers are investigating the nature of patient health outcomes. To protect individual privacy, patient identifiers and demographics such as name, date of birth and address, are removed from the copied EHR's, whilst researchers evaluate clinical information such as diagnoses and performed procedures. The process ensures that patients’ sensitive information remains anonymous whilst gains in research can still be made.  Data Hashing  :Data hashing involves blocking and de-identifying certain characters within strings of information so that personal information is no longer recognizable to its original form. This method ensures masked information is no longer visually identifiable to unauthorized users. The fact that data hashing alters the data itself means it is only appropriate when applied to data that is not required again in the future. For instance, if a study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of Type 2 Diabetes in Victoria, Australia, researchers would only require demographic information regarding to the state of residence. To protect patient privacy and confidentiality, more specific indicators such as house number, address, suburb and post code would be masked. For example: :No. XXX XXXXX Street, XX XXXX, Victoria, Australia, Post code 31XX.

According to Edward Gibbon his name may be a title rather than a proper name.Edward Gibbon: Decline and fall of the Roman Empire Vol IV, p.576 Background In 552 Bumin founded the Gokturk Empire. His younger brother Istämi was viceroy (Yabghu) in the west. In 575 Ishtami was followed by Tardu. By 575/76 Tamgan held some kind of power in the far west around the Volga River. He was probably Tardu's younger brother.According to Cambridge History of Inner Asia, , p.304 Menander said omaimos which usually means brother but can also mean close relative. Relations with the Byzantine Empire Because of the geographic position of his region, Tamgan was responsible in diplomatic relations with Byzantine Empire. (Hence, the historical sources about Tamgan are mostly the reports of Byzantine envoys). Initially Turkic and Byzantine Empires were allies against Sassanid Iran and Pannonian Avars. However, according to Byzantine historian Menander Protector, a Byzantine envoy named Valentinos visited Tamgan's headquarters where Tamgan accused Byzantines for the recently signed treaty between the Byzantine Empire and the Avars. He said that the Byzantines were liars and had ten tongues, meaning they were unreliable as allies. He also threatened the Byzantine side mentioning the rivers Danapr, Istr and Evr.

(About half a century later Byzantine Turkic relations recovered and Turks collaborated with Heraclius in the invasion of North Caucasus.) Death There is no record of Tamgan's death. However it is known that together with his brother he supported Apa Khagan during the Turkic interregnum after 584. Thus Tamgan's death year can be located to be later than 584.

Anthropologists and archeologists have identified and studied a wide variety of cultures that existed during this era. Their subsequent contact with Europeans had a profound impact on the history of their people. Pre-Colombian era Migration to the Americas This map shows the approximate location of the ice-free corridor and specific Paleoindian sites (Clovis theory). According to the most generally accepted theory of the settlement of the Americas, migrations of humans from Eurasia to the Americas took place via Beringia, a land bridge which connected the two continents across what is now the Bering Strait. The number and composition of the migrations is still being debated.Ehlers, J., and P.L. Gibbard, 2004a, Quaternary Glaciations: Extent and Chronology 2: Part II North America, Elsevier, Amsterdam. . Falling sea levels associated with an intensive period of Quaternary glaciation created the Bering land bridge that joined Siberia to Alaska about 60–25,000 years ago. The latest this migration could have taken place is 12,000 years ago; the earliest remains undetermined.Dyke A.S. & Prest V.K. (1986). Late Wisconsinian and Holocene retreat of the Larentide ice sheet: Geological Survey of Canada Map 1702A The archaeological periods used are the classifications of archaeological periods and cultures established in Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips' 1958 book Method and Theory in American Archaeology which divided the archaeological record in the Americas into five phases; see Archaeology of the Americas. Paleo-Indian or Lithic stage The Cultural areas of pre-Columbian North America, according to Alfred Kroeber. The Paleo-Indian or Lithic stage lasted from the first arrival of people in the Americas until about 5000/3000 BCE (in North America). Three major migrations occurred, as traced by linguistic and genetic data; the early Paleoamericans soon spread throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct nations and tribes.Dickason, Olive. Canada's First Nations: A History of the Founding Peoples from the Earliest Times. 2nd edition. Toronto: Oxford University Press, 1997.Native American populations descend from three key migrations http://phys.org/news/2012-07-native- american-populations-descend-key.html By 8000 BCE the North American climate was very similar to today's.J. Imbrie and K.P. Imbrie, Ice Ages: Solving the Mystery (Short Hills, NJ: Enslow Publishers) 1979. A study published in 2012 gives genetic backing to the 1986 theory put forward by linguist Joseph Greenberg that the Americas must have been populated in three waves, based on language differences. The Clovis culture, a megafauna hunting culture, is primarily identified by use of fluted spear points. Artifacts from this culture were first excavated in 1932 near Clovis, New Mexico. The Clovis culture ranged over much of North America and also appeared in South America. The culture is identified by the distinctive Clovis point, a flaked flint spear-point with a notched flute, by which it was inserted into a shaft. Dating of Clovis materials has been by association with animal bones and by the use of carbon dating methods. Recent reexaminations of Clovis materials using improved carbon-dating methods produced results of 11,050 and 10,800 radiocarbon years BP (roughly 9100 to 8850 BCE). Numerous Paleoindian cultures occupied North America, with some arrayed around the Great Plains and Great Lakes of the modern United States of America and Canada, as well as adjacent areas to the West and Southwest. According to the oral histories of many of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, they have been living on this continent since their genesis, described by a wide range of traditional creation stories. Other tribes have stories that recount migrations across long tracts of land and a great river believed to be the Mississippi River.Deloria, V., Jr., (1997) Red Earth White Lies: Native Americans and The Myth of Scientific Fact. Genetic and linguistic data connect the indigenous people of this continent with ancient northeast Asians. Archeological and linguistic data has enabled scholars to discover some of the migrations within the Americas. A Folsom point for a spear. The Folsom Tradition was characterized by the use of Folsom points as projectile tips and activities known from kill sites, where slaughter and butchering of bison took place. Folsom tools were left behind between 9000 BCE and 8000 BCE.Hillerman, Anthony G. (1973). \\"The Hunt for the Lost American\\", in The Great Taos Bank Robbery and Other Indian Country Affairs, University of New Mexico Press. . Na-Dené- speaking peoples entered North America starting around 8000 BCE, reaching the Pacific Northwest by 5000 BCE,D.E.

Retrieved 2010-03-30. and from there migrating along the Pacific Coast and into the interior. Linguists, anthropologists, and archeologists believe their ancestors comprised a separate migration into North America, later than the first Paleo-Indians. They migrated into Alaska and northern Canada, south along the Pacific Coast, into the interior of Canada, and south to the Great Plains and the American Southwest. They were the earliest ancestors of the Athabascan- speaking peoples, including the present-day and historical Navajo and Apache. They constructed large multi-family dwellings in their villages, which were used seasonally. People did not live there year-round, but for the summer to hunt and fish, and to gather food supplies for the winter., Leer, Jeff, Doug Hitch, & John Ritter. 2001.

Meso-Indian or Archaic stage The Archaic period lasted until about 1000 BCE. A major culture of the Archaic stage was the Mound builders, who stretched from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. Since the 1990s, archeologists have explored and dated eleven Middle Archaic sites in present-day Louisiana and Florida at which early cultures built complexes with multiple earthwork mounds; they were societies of hunter-gatherers rather than the settled agriculturalists believed necessary according to the theory of Neolithic Revolution to sustain such large villages over long periods. Native American cultures are not included in characterizations of advanced stone age cultures as \\"Neolithic,\\" which is a category that more often includes only the cultures in Eurasia, Africa, and other regions. Watson Brake Aerial Illustration The prime example is Watson Brake in northern Louisiana, whose 11-mound complex is dated to 3500 BCE, making it the oldest dated site in the Americas for such complex construction. It is nearly 2,000 years older than the Poverty Point site. Construction of the mounds went on for 500 years until was abandoned about 2800 BCE, probably due to changing environmental conditions.Joe W. Saunders*, Rolfe D. Mandel, Roger T. Saucier, E. Thurman Allen, C. T. Hallmark, Jay K. Johnson, Edwin H. Jackson, Charles M. Allen, Gary L. Stringer, Douglas S. Frink, James K. Feathers, Stephen Williams, Kristen J. Gremillion, Malcolm F. Vidrine, and Reca Jones, \\"A Mound Complex in Louisiana at 5400-5000 Years Before the Present\\", Science, September 19, 1997: Vol. 277 no. 5333, pp. 1796–99, accessed 2011-10-27 Poverty Point culture is a Late Archaic archaeological culture that inhabited the area of the lower Mississippi Valley and surrounding Gulf Coast. The culture thrived from 2200 BCE to 700 BCE, during the Late Archaic period.^ Fagan, Brian M. 2005. Ancient North America: The Archaeology of a Continent. Fourth Edition. New York. Thames & Hudson Inc. p. 418. Evidence of this culture has been found at more than 100 sites, from the major complex at Poverty Point, Louisiana (a UNESCO World Heritage site) across a range to the Jaketown Site near Belzoni, Mississippi. Poverty Point is a complex of six major earthwork concentric rings, with additional platform mounds at the site. Artifacts show the people traded with other Native Americans located from Georgia to the Great Lakes region. This is one among numerous mound sites of complex indigenous cultures throughout the Mississippi and Ohio valleys. They were one of several succeeding cultures often referred to as mound builders. The Oshara Tradition people lived from 5500 BCE to 600 CE. They were part of the Southwestern Archaic Tradition centered in north-central New Mexico, the San Juan Basin, the Rio Grande Valley, southern Colorado, and southeastern Utah. Post- Archaic stage The Post-Archaic stage includes the Formative, Classic and Post-Classic stages in Willey and Phillipp's scheme. The Formative stage lasted from 1000 BCE until about 500 CE, the Classic from about 500 CE to 1200 CE, while the Post-Classic refers to 1200 CE until the present day. It also includes the Woodland period of North American pre-Columbian, whose culture refers to the time period from roughly 1000 BCE to 1,000 CE in the eastern part of North America. Grave Creek Mound, located in Moundsville, West Virginia, is one of the largest conical mounds in the United States. It was built by the Adena culture. The term \\"Woodland\\" was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites dated between the Archaic period and the Mississippian cultures. The Adena culture was a Native American culture that existed from 1000 BCE to 200 BCE, in a time known as the Early Woodland period. The Adena culture refers to what was probably a number of related Native American societies sharing a burial complex and ceremonial system. The Hopewell tradition is the term for the common aspects of the Woodland period culture that flourished along rivers in the Eastern Woodlands from 200 BCE to 500 CE. The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations, who were connected by a common network of trade routes, known as the Hopewell Exchange System. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern Woodlands into the northern shores of Lake Ontario. Within this area, societies participated in a high degree of exchange; most activities was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes. The Hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over North America. A map showing the extent of the Coles Creek cultural period and some important sites. The Coles Creek culture was an indigenous development of the Lower Mississippi Valley that took place between the late Woodland period and the later Plaquemine culture period. The period is marked by the increased use of flat-topped platform mounds arranged around central plazas, more complex political institutions, and a subsistence strategy still grounded in the Eastern Agricultural Complex and hunting rather than on the maize plant as would happen in the succeeding Plaquemine Mississippian period. The culture was originally defined by the unique decoration on grog-tempered ceramic ware by James A. Ford after his investigations at the Mazique Archeological Site. He had studied both the Mazique and Coles Creek Sites, and almost went with the Mazique culture, but decided on the less historically involved sites name. It is ancestral to the Plaquemine culture. The Mississippian culture which extended throughout the Ohio and Mississippi valleys and built sites throughout the Southeast created the largest earthworks in North America north of Mexico, most notably at Cahokia, on a tributary of the Mississippi River in present-day Illinois. **The ten-story Monks Mound at Cahokia has a larger circumference than the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan or the Great Pyramid of Egypt. The city complex was based on the culture's cosmology; it included more than 100 mounds, positioned to support their sophisticated knowledge of astronomy, and built with knowledge of varying soil types. The society began building at this site about 950 CE, and reached its peak population in 1,250 CE of 20,000–30,000 people, which was not equalled by any city in the present- day United States until after 1800. **Cahokia was a major regional chiefdom, with trade and tributary chiefdoms located in a range of areas from bordering the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. **Kincaid c. 1050–1400 CE, is one of the largest settlements of the Mississippian culture, it was located at the southern tip of present-day U.S. state of Illinois. Kincaid Mounds has been notable for both its significant role in native North American prehistory and for the central role the site has played in the development of modern archaeological techniques. The site had at least 11 substructure platform mounds (ranking fifth for mound-culture pyramids). Artifacts from the settlement link its major habitation and the construction of the mounds to the Mississippian period, but it was also occupied earlier during the Woodland period. **Etowah Indian Mounds (9BR1) are a archaeological site in Bartow County, Georgia south of Cartersville, in the United States. Built and occupied in three phases, from 1000–1550 AD, the prehistoric site is located on the north shore of the Etowah River. **The Mississippian culture developed the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, the name which archeologists have given to the regional stylistic similarity of artifacts, iconography, ceremonies and mythology. The rise of the complex culture was based on the people's adoption of maize agriculture, development of greater population densities, and chiefdom-level complex social organization from 1200 CE to 1650 CE. **The Mississippian pottery are some of the finest and most widely spread ceramics north of Mexico. Cahokian pottery was espically fine, with smooth surfaces, very thin walls and distinctive tempering, slips and coloring. The Great House at the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument. The Hohokam culture was centered along American Southwest.Chenault, Mark, Rick Ahlstrom, and Tom Motsinger, (1993) In the Shadow of South Mountain: The Pre-Classic Hohokam of 'La Ciudad de los Hornos', Part I and II. The early Hohokam founded a series of small villages along the middle Gila River. They raised corn, squash, and beans. The communities were located near good arable land, with dry farming common in the earlier years of this period. They were known for their pottery, using the paddle-and-anvil technique. The Classical period of the culture saw the rise in architecture and ceramics. Buildings were grouped into walled compounds, as well as earthen platform mounds. Platform mounds were built along river as well as irrigation canal systems, suggesting these sites were administrative centers allocating water and coordinating canal labor. Polychrome pottery appeared, and inhumation burial replaced cremation. The trade included that of shells and other exotics. Social and climatic factors led to a decline and abandonment of the area after 1400 CE. The Ancestral Puebloan culture covered present-day Four Corners region of the United States, comprising southern Utah, northern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, and southwestern Colorado.\\"Ancestral Pueblo culture.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 4 June 2012. It is believed that the Ancestral Puebloans developed, at least in part, from the Oshara Tradition, who developed from the Picosa culture. They lived in a range of structures that included small family pit houses, larger clan type structures, grand pueblos, and cliff sited dwellings. The Ancestral Puebloans possessed a complex network that stretched across the Colorado Plateau linking hundreds of communities and population centers. The culture is perhaps best known for the stone and earth dwellings built along cliff walls, particularly during the Pueblo II and Pueblo III eras. **Three UNESCO World Heritage Sites located in the United States are credited to the Pueblos: Mesa Verde National Park, Chaco Culture National Historical Park and Taos Pueblo. **The best-preserved examples of the stone dwellings are in National Parks (US), examples being, Navajo National Monument, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, Mesa Verde National Park, Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, Aztec Ruins National Monument, Bandelier National Monument, Hovenweep National Monument, and Canyon de Chelly National Monument. Map of the Five Nations of the Iroquois (from the Darlington Collection). The Iroquois League of Nations or \\"People of the Long House\\", based in present-day upstate and western New York, had a confederacy model from the mid-15th century. It has been suggested that their culture contributed to political thinking during the development of the later United States government. Their system of affiliation was a kind of federation, different from the strong, centralized European monarchies. **Long-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds. Historians have placed these events as occurring as early as the 13th century, or in the 17th century Beaver Wars. **Through warfare, the Iroquois drove several tribes to migrate west to what became known as their historically traditional lands west of the Mississippi River. Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the Osage, Kaw, Ponca and Omaha people. By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day Kansas, Nebraska, Arkansas and Oklahoma. The Osage warred with Caddo-speaking Native Americans, displacing them in turn by the mid-18th century and dominating their new historical territories. European exploration and colonization Discovery of the Mississippi by William Henry Powell (1823–1879) is a Romantic depiction of de Soto's seeing the Mississippi River for the first time. It hangs in the United States Capitol rotunda. After 1492 European exploration and colonization of the Americas revolutionized how the Old and New Worlds perceived themselves. One of the first major contacts, in what would be called the American Deep South, occurred when the conquistador Juan Ponce de León landed in La Florida in April 1513. He was later followed by other Spanish explorers, such as Pánfilo de Narváez in 1528 and Hernando de Soto in 1539\\\\. The subsequent European colonists in North America often rationalized their expansion of empire with the assumption that they were saving a barbaric, pagan world by spreading Christian civilization. In the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the policy of Indian Reductions resulted in the forced conversions to Catholicism of the indigenous people in northern Nueva España. They had long-established spiritual and religious traditions and theological beliefs. What developed during the colonial years and since has been a syncretic Catholicism that absorbed and reflected indigenous beliefs; the religion changed in New Spain. Impact on native populations From the 16th through the 19th centuries, the population of Native Americans declined in the following ways: epidemic diseases brought from Europe; violence and warfare. at the hands of European explorers and colonists, as well as between tribes; displacement from their lands; internal warfare, enslavement; and a high rate of intermarriage.\\"Indian Mixed-Blood\\", Frederick W. Hodge, Handbook of American Indians, 1906. Most mainstream scholars believe that, among the various contributing factors, epidemic disease was the overwhelming cause of the population decline of the American natives because of their lack of immunity to new diseases brought from Europe. With the rapid declines of some populations and continuing rivalries among their nations, Native Americans sometimes re-organized to form new cultural groups, such as the Seminoles of Florida in the 19th century and the Mission Indians of Alta California. Some scholars characterize the treatment of Native Americans by the US as genocide or genocidal whilst others dispute this characterization.[Guenter Lewy, \\"Were American Indians the Victims of Genocide?\\"], History News Network, 11–22–04. Estimating the number of Native Americans living in what is today the United States of America before the arrival of the European explorers and settlers has been the subject of much debate. While it is difficult to determine exactly how many Natives lived in North America before Columbus,\\"Microchronology and Demographic Evidence Relating to the Size of Pre-Columbian North American Indian Populations\\". Science June 16, 1995: Vol. 268. no. 5217, pp. 1601–04 . estimates range from a low of 2.1 million (Ubelaker 1976) to 7 million people (Russell Thornton) to a high of 18 million (Dobyns 1983). A low estimate of around 1 million was first posited by the anthropologist James Mooney in the 1890s, by calculating population density of each culture area based on its carrying capacity. In 1965, the American anthropologist Henry F. Dobyns published studies estimating the original population to have been 10 to 12 million. By 1983, he increased his estimates to 18 million. Historian David Henige criticized higher estimates such as those of Dobyns', writing that many population figures are the result of arbitrary formulas selectively applied to numbers from unreliable historical sources.David Henige, Numbers From Nowhere: The American Indian Contact Population Debate (University of Oklahoma Press, 1998), pp. 66–87. By 1800, the Native population of the present-day United States had declined to approximately 600,000, and only 250,000 Native Americans remained in the 1890s.Thornton, Russel (1990). American Indian holocaust and survival: a population history since 1492. University of Texas Press. p. 43. . A conference of French and Indian leaders around a ceremonial fire by Émile Louis Vernier Chicken pox and measles, endemic but rarely fatal among Europeans (long after being introduced from Asia), often proved deadly to Native Americans. Smallpox epidemics often immediately followed European exploration and sometimes destroyed entire village populations. While precise figures are difficult to determine, some historians estimate that at least 30% (and sometimes 50% to 70%) of some Native populations died after first contact due to Eurasian smallpox.Native American History and Cultures, Susan Squires and John Kincheloe, syllabus for HIS 943A, Meredith College, 2005.

One element of the Columbian exchange suggests explorers from the Christopher Columbus expedition contracted syphilis from indigenous peoples and carried it back to Europe, where it spread widely.\\"Columbus May Have Brought Syphilis to Europe\\", LiveScience, January 15, 2008. Other researchers believe that the disease existed in Europe and Asia before Columbus and his men returned from exposure to indigenous peoples of the Americas, but that they brought back a more virulent form. In the 100 years following the arrival of the Spanish to the Americas, large disease epidemics depopulated large parts of the Eastern Woodlands in the 15th century.1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus, Knopf, 2005 In 1618–1619, smallpox killed 90% of the Native Americans in the area of the Massachusetts Bay. Historians believe many Mohawk in present-day New York became infected after contact with children of Dutch traders in Albany in 1634. The disease swept through Mohawk villages, reaching the Onondaga at Lake Ontario by 1636, and the lands of the western Iroquois by 1679, as it was carried by Mohawk and other Native Americans who traveled the trading routes. The high rate of fatalities caused breakdowns in Native American societies and disrupted generational exchange of culture. Native California Population, according to Cook 1978. The 2010 U.S. Census reported 723,225 Native Americans in California.\\"American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month: November 2011\\". U.S. Census Bureau.After European explorers reached the West Coast in the 1770s, smallpox rapidly killed at least 30% of Northwest Coast Native Americans. For the next 80 to 100 years, smallpox and other diseases devastated native populations in the region.\\"Plagues and Peoples on the Northwest Coast\\" , History Net, Missouri State University, Humanities & Social Sciences Online. Puget Sound area populations, once estimated as high as 37,000 people, were reduced to only 9,000 survivors by the time settlers arrived en masse in the mid-19th century.Greg Lange,\\"Smallpox epidemic ravages Native Americans on the northwest coast of North America in the 1770s\\", The Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History, January 23, 2003. Retrieved 2008-08-09. The Spanish missions in California did not have a large effect on the overall population of Native Americans because the small number of missions was concentrated in a small area along the southern and central coast. The numbers of indigenes decreased more rapidly after California ceased to be a Spanish colony, especially during the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th (see chart on the right). Smallpox epidemics in 1780–1782 and 1837–1838 brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the Plains Indians.\\"The first smallpox epidemic on the Canadian Plains: In the fur-traders' words\\", National Institutes of Health.\\"Mountain Man-Plains Indian Fur Trade\\", The Fur Trapper. By 1832, the federal government established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans (The Indian Vaccination Act of 1832).

Animal introductions With the meeting of two worlds, animals, insects, and plants were carried from one to the other, both deliberately and by chance, in what is called the Columbian Exchange. Sheep, pigs, horses, and cattle were all Old World animals that were introduced to contemporary Native Americans who never knew such animals. In the 16th century, Spaniards and other Europeans brought horses to Mexico. Some of the horses escaped and began to breed and increase their numbers in the wild. The early American horse had been game for the earliest humans on the continent. It was hunted to extinction about 7000 BCE, just after the end of the last glacial period. Native Americans benefited from the reintroduction of horses, as they adopted the use of the animals, they began to change their cultures in substantial ways, especially by extending their nomadic ranges for hunting. The reintroduction of the horse to North America had a profound impact on Native American culture of the Great Plains. The tribes trained and used horses to ride and to carry packs or pull travois. The people fully incorporated the use of horses into their societies and expanded their territories. They used horses to carry goods for exchange with neighboring tribes, to hunt game, especially bison, and to conduct wars and horse raids. 16th Century The 16th century saw the first contacts between Native Americans in what was to become the United States and European explorers and settlers. One of the first major contacts, in what would be called the American Deep South, occurred when the conquistador Juan Ponce de León landed in La Florida in April 1513. De León returned in 1521 in an attempt at colonisation, but after fierce resistance from the Calusa people, the attempt was abandoned. He was later followed by other Spanish explorers, such as Pánfilo de Narváez in 1528 and Hernando de Soto in 1539\\\\. 17th century Through the mid 17th century the Beaver Wars were fought over the fur trade between the Iroquois and the Hurons, the northern Algonquians, and their French allies. During the war the Iroquois destroyed several large tribal confederacies—including the Huron, Neutral, Erie, Susquehannock, and Shawnee, and became dominant in the region and enlarged their territory. King Philip's War King Philip's War, also called Metacom's War or Metacom's Rebellion, was an armed conflict between Native American inhabitants of present-day southern New England and English colonists and their Native American allies from 1675 to 1676. It continued in northern New England (primarily on the Maine frontier) even after King Philip was killed, until a treaty was signed at Casco Bay in April 1678. According to a combined estimate of loss of life in Schultz and Tougias' King Philip's War, The History and Legacy of America's Forgotten Conflict (based on sources from the Department of Defense, the Bureau of Census, and the work of Colonial historian Francis Jennings), 800 out of 52,000 English colonists of New England (1 out of every 65) and 3,000 out of 20,000 natives (3 out of every 20) lost their lives due to the war, which makes it proportionately one of the bloodiest and costliest in the history of America. More than half of New England's 90 towns were assaulted by Native American warriors. One in ten soldiers on both sides were wounded or killed.Giersbach, Walter. Philip's War: America's Most Devastating Conflict, MilitaryHistoryOnline.com The war is named after the main leader of the Native American side, Metacomet (also known as Metacom or Pometacom) who was known to the English as King Philip. He was the last Massasoit (Great Leader) of the Pokanoket Tribe/Pokanoket Federation and Wampanoag Nation. Upon their loss to the Colonists, many managed to flee to the North to continue their fight against the British (Massachusetts Bay Colony) by joining with the Abenaki Tribes and Wabanaki Federation. 18th century Between 1754 and 1763, many Native American tribes were involved in the French and Indian War/Seven Years' War. Those involved in the fur trade in the northern areas tended to ally with French forces against British colonial militias. Native Americans fought on both sides of the conflict. The greater number of tribes fought with the French in the hopes of checking British expansion. The British had made fewer allies, but it was joined by some tribes that wanted to prove assimilation and loyalty in support of treaties to preserve their territories. They were often disappointed when such treaties were later overturned. The tribes had their own purposes, using their alliances with the European powers to battle traditional Native enemies. Native American influence The Treaty of Penn with the Indians by Benjamin West painted in 1771. Native American culture began to have an influence on European thought in this period. Some Europeans considered Native American societies to be representative of a golden age known to them only in folk history. The political theorist Jean Jacques Rousseau wrote that the idea of freedom and democratic ideals was born in the Americas because \\"it was only in America\\" that Europeans from 1500 to 1776 knew of societies that were \\"truly free.\\" In the 20th century, some writers have credited the Iroquois nations' political confederacy and democratic government as being influences for the development of the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution. Mee, Charles L., Jr. The Genius of the People. New York: Harper & Row, 1987. p. 237. Note: John Rutledge of South Carolina is said to have read lengthy tracts of Iroquoian law to the other framers of the Constitution, beginning with the words, \\"We, the people, to form a union, to establish peace, equity, and order...\\" In October 1988, the U.S. Congress passed Concurrent Resolution 331 to recognize the influence of the Iroquois Constitution upon the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. However, leading historians of the period note that historic evidence is lacking to support such an interpretation. Gordon Wood wrote, \\"The English colonists did not need the Indians to tell them about federalism or self-government. The New England Confederation was organized as early as 1643.\\" The historian Jack Rakove, a specialist in early American history, in 2005 noted that the voluminous documentation of the Constitutional proceedings \\"contain no significant reference to Iroquois.\\"Jack Rakove, \\"Did the Founding Fathers Really Get Many of Their Ideas of Liberty from the Iroquois?\\", History News Network, July 5, 2005, accessed 2012-01-17 Secondly, he notes: \\"All the key political concepts that were the stuff of American political discourse before the Revolution and after, had obvious European antecedents and referents: bicameralism, separation of powers, confederations, and the like.\\" American Revolution Creek Native Americans meet with the Trustee of the colony of Georgia in England, July 1734. The painting shows a Native American boy (in a blue coat) and woman (in a red dress) in European clothing. During the American Revolution, the newly proclaimed United States competed with the British for the allegiance of Native American nations east of the Mississippi River. Most Native Americans who joined the struggle sided with the British, based both on their trading relationships and hopes that colonial defeat would result in a halt to further colonial expansion onto Native American land. Many native communities were divided over which side to support in the war and others wanted to remain neutral. The first native community to sign a treaty with the new United States Government was the Lenape. For the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, the American Revolution resulted in civil war. The only Iroquois tribes to ally with the colonials were the Oneida and Tuscarora. Frontier warfare during the American Revolution was particularly brutal, and numerous atrocities were committed by settlers and native tribes alike. Noncombatants suffered greatly during the war. Military expeditions on each side destroyed villages and food supplies to reduce the ability of people to fight, as in frequent raids by both sides in the Mohawk Valley and western New York.Wyoming Massacre, Encyclopædia Britannica. The largest of these expeditions was the Sullivan Expedition of 1779, in which American colonial troops destroyed more than 40 Iroquois villages to neutralize Iroquois raids in upstate New York. The expedition failed to have the desired effect: Native American activity became even more determined. Mishikinakwa (\\"Little Turtle\\")'s forces defeated an American force of nearly 1000 U.S Army soldiers and other casualties at the Battle of the Wabash in 1791. The British made peace with the Americans in the Treaty of Paris (1783), through which they ceded vast Native American territories to the United States without informing or consulting with the Native Americans. The Northwest Indian War was led by Native American tribes trying to repulse American settlers. The United States initially treated the Native Americans who had fought as allies with the British as a conquered people who had lost their lands. Although most members of the Iroquois tribes went to Canada with the Loyalists, others tried to stay in New York and western territories to maintain their lands. The state of New York made a separate treaty with Iroquois nations and put up for sale of land that had previously been their territories. The state established small reservations in western New York for the remnant peoples. After the formation of the United States The United States was eager to expand, to develop farming and settlements in new areas, and to satisfy land hunger of settlers from New England and new immigrants. The national government initially sought to purchase Native American land by treaties. The states and settlers were frequently at odds with this policy.Wilcomb E. Washburn, \\"Indians and the American Revolution\\", AmericanRevolution.org, History Channel Network. Retrieved 2006-02-23. George Washington advocated the advancement of Native American society and he \\"harbored some measure of goodwill towards the Indians.\\" Treaty of the Six Nations of 1784 brokered to end all hostilities between the United States and the Iroquois Confederation European nations sent Native Americans (sometimes against their will) to the Old World as objects of curiosity. They often entertained royalty and were sometimes prey to commercial purposes. Christianization of Native Americans was a charted purpose for some European colonies. United States policy toward Native Americans had continued to evolve after the American Revolution. George Washington and Henry Knox believed that Native Americans were equals but that their society was inferior. Washington formulated a policy to encourage the \\"civilizing\\" process. Washington had a six-point plan for civilization which included: # impartial justice toward Native Americans # regulated buying of Native American lands # promotion of commerce # promotion of experiments to civilize or improve Native American society # presidential authority to give presents # punishing those who violated Native American rights. Robert Remini, a historian, wrote that \\"once the Indians adopted the practice of private property, built homes, farmed, educated their children, and embraced Christianity, these Native Americans would win acceptance from white Americans.\\" The United States appointed agents, like Benjamin Hawkins, to live among the Native Americans and to teach them how to live like whites. Benjamin Hawkins, seen here on his plantation, teaches Creek Native Americans how to use European technology. Painted in 1805. In the late 18th century, reformers starting with Washington and Knox,The Great Confusion in Indian Affairs: Native Americans and Whites in the Progressive Era, Tom Holm, http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/excerpts/exholgre.html supported educating native children and adults, in efforts to \\"civilize\\" or otherwise assimilate Native Americans to the larger society (as opposed to relegating them to reservations). The Civilization Fund Act of 1819 promoted this civilization policy by providing funding to societies (mostly religious) who worked on Native American improvement. 19th century Resistance Tecumseh was the Shawnee leader of Tecumseh's War who attempted to organize an alliance of Native American tribes throughout North America. As American expansion continued, Native Americans resisted settlers' encroachment in several regions of the new nation (and in unorganized territories), from the Northwest to the Southeast, and then in the West, as settlers encountered the tribes of the Great Plains. East of the Mississippi River, an intertribal army led by Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief, fought a number of engagements in the Northwest during the period 1811–12, known as Tecumseh's War. In the latter stages, Tecumseh's group allied with the British forces in the War of 1812 and was instrumental in the conquest of Detroit. Conflicts in the Southeast include the Creek War and Seminole Wars, both before and after the Indian Removals of most members of the Five Civilized Tribes beginning in the 1830s under President Andrew Jackson's policies. Native American nations on the plains in the west continued armed conflicts with the United States throughout the 19th century, through what were called generally \\"Indian Wars.\\" The Battle of Little Bighorn (1876) was one of the greatest Native American victories. Defeats included the Sioux Uprising of 1862, the Sand Creek Massacre (1864) and Wounded Knee in 1890.Ralph K. Andrist. MASSACRE!, American Heritage, April 1962. Indian Wars continued into the early 20th century. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), > \\"The Indian wars under the government of the United States have been more > than 40 in number. They have cost the lives of about 19,000 white men, women > and children, including those killed in individual combats, and the lives of > about 30,000 Indians.

American Indian Holocaust and > Survival: A Population History since 1492. University of Oklahoma Press. p. > 48. American expansion Native Americans flee from the allegorical representation of Manifest Destiny, Columbia, painted in 1872 by John Gast In July 1845, the New York newspaper editor John L. O’Sullivan coined the phrase, \\"Manifest Destiny,\\" as the \\"design of Providence\\" supporting the territorial expansion of the United States.Worlds Together, Worlds Apart, Robert Tignor, Jeremy Adelman, Stephen Aron, Stephen Kotkin, Suzanne Marchand, Gyan Prakash, Michael Tsin, W.W. Norton & Company, New York, 2000, p. 274. Manifest Destiny had serious consequences for Native Americans, since continental expansion for the United States took place at the cost of their occupied land. Manifest Destiny was a justification for expansion and westward movement, or, in some interpretations, an ideology or doctrine that helped to promote the progress of civilization. Advocates of Manifest Destiny believed that expansion was not only good, but that it was obvious and certain. The term was first used primarily by Jacksonian Democrats in the 1840s to promote the annexation of much of what is now the Western United States (the Oregon Territory, the Texas Annexation, and the Mexican Cession). The age of Manifest Destiny, which came to be associated with extinguishing American Indian territorial claims and moving them to reservations, gained ground as the United States population explored and settled west of the Mississippi River. Although Indian Removal from the Southeast had been proposed by some as a humanitarian measure to ensure their survival away from Americans, conflicts of the 19th century led some European-Americans to regard the natives as \\"savages\\". The period of the Gold Rush was marked by the California Genocide. Under US sovereignty, the indigenous population plunged from approximately 150,000 in 1848 to 30,000 in 1870 and reached its nadir of 16,000 in 1900. Thousands of California Native Americans, including women and children, are documented to have been killed by non-Native Americans in this period. The dispossession and murder of California Native Americans was aided by institutions of the state of California, which encouraged indigenous peoples to be killed with impunity.Madley, Benjamin (2016). An American Genocide: The United States and the California Indian Catastrophe, 1846-1873. Yale University Press. .\\"California Indians, Genocide of\\" in Encyclopedia of American Indian History edited by Bruce E. Johansen, Barry M. Pritzk (ABC-CLIO, 2007), p. 226-231 Civil War Ely Parker was a Union Civil War General who wrote the terms of surrender between the United States and the Confederate States of America.Ely Parker Famous Native Americans. Parker was one of two Native Americans to reach the rank of brigadier general during the Civil War. Many Native Americans served in the military during the Civil War, on both sides. By fighting with the whites, Native Americans hoped to gain favor with the prevailing government by supporting the war effort. Cherokee confederates reunion in New Orleans, 1903. General Ely S. Parker, a member of the Seneca tribe, transcribed the terms of the articles of surrender which General Robert E. Lee signed at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. Gen. Parker, who served as Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's military secretary and was a trained attorney, was once rejected for Union military service because of his race. At Appomattox, Lee is said to have remarked to Parker, \\"I am glad to see one real American here,\\" to which Parker replied, \\"We are all Americans.\\" General Stand Watie, a leader of the Cherokee Nation and Confederate Indian cavalry commander, was the last Confederate General to surrender his troops.Morris, John Wesley, Ghost towns of Oklahoma, University of Oklahoma Press, 1977, pp. 68–69, Removals and reservations In the 19th century, the incessant westward expansion of the United States incrementally compelled large numbers of Native Americans to resettle further west, often by force, almost always reluctantly. Native Americans believed this forced relocation illegal, given the Hopewell Treaty of 1785. Under President Andrew Jackson, United States Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which authorized the President to conduct treaties to exchange Native American land east of the Mississippi River for lands west of the river. As many as 100,000 Native Americans relocated to the West as a result of this Indian Removal policy. In theory, relocation was supposed to be voluntary and many Native Americans did remain in the East. In practice, great pressure was put on Native American leaders to sign removal treaties. The most egregious violation of the stated intention of the removal policy took place under the Treaty of New Echota, which was signed by a dissident faction of Cherokees but not the principal chief. The following year, the Cherokee conceded to removal, but Georgia included their land in a lottery for European-American settlement before that. President Jackson used the military to gather and transport the Cherokee to the west, whose timing and lack of adequate supplies led to the deaths of an estimated 4,000 Cherokees on the Trail of Tears. About 17,000 Cherokees, along with approximately 2,000 enslaved blacks held by Cherokees, were taken by force migration to Indian Territory.Carter (III), Samuel (1976). Cherokee Sunset: A Nation Betrayed : A Narrative of Travail and Triumph, Persecution and Exile. New York: Doubleday, p. 232. Tribes were generally located to reservations where they could more easily be separated from traditional life and pushed into European-American society. Some southern states additionally enacted laws in the 19th century forbidding non-Native American settlement on Native American lands, with the intention to prevent sympathetic white missionaries from aiding the scattered Native American resistance.see Genocides in history#Americas Native Americans and U.S. citizenship In 1817, the Cherokee became the first Native Americans recognized as U.S. citizens. Under Article 8 of the 1817 Cherokee treaty, \\"Upwards of 300 Cherokees (Heads of Families) in the honest simplicity of their souls, made an election to become American citizens.\\" The next earliest recorded date of Native Americans' becoming U.S. citizens was in 1831, when some Mississippi Choctaw became citizens after the United States Congress ratified the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. Article 22 sought to put a Choctaw representative in the U.S. House of Representatives. Under article XIV of that treaty, any Choctaw who elected not to move with the Choctaw Nation could become an American citizen when he registered and if he stayed on designated lands for five years after treaty ratification. Through the years, Native Americans became U.S. citizens by: > 1\\\\. Treaty provision (as with the Cherokee) > 2\\\\. Registration and land allotment under the Dawes Act of February 8, 1887 > 3\\\\. Issuance of Patent in Fee simple > 4\\\\. Adopting Habits of Civilized Life > 5\\\\. Minor Children > 6\\\\. Citizenship by Birth > 7\\\\. Becoming Soldiers and Sailors in the U.S. Armed Forces > 8\\\\. Marriage to a U.S. citizen > 9\\\\. Special Act of Congress. > In 1857, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney expressed the opinion of the court that since Native Americans were \\"free and independent people,\\" they could become U.S. citizens.In an offhand reference in the Dred Scott decision Taney asserted that Native Americans could be naturalized and join the \\"political community\\" of the United States. After the American Civil War, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 states, \\"that all persons born in the United States, and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States\\".(McCool 3) This was affirmed by the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. But the concept of Native Americans as U.S. citizens fell out of favor among politicians at the time. Senator Jacob Howard of Michigan commented, “I am not yet prepared to pass a sweeping act of naturalization by which all the Indian savages, wild or tame, belonging to a tribal relation, are to become my fellow-citizens and go to the polls and vote with me\\". (Congressional Globe, 1866, 2895)McCool, Daniel, Susan M. Olson, and Jennifer L. Robinson. Native Vote, Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 2007. In a Senate floor debate regarding the Fourteenth Amendment, James Rood Doolittle of Wisconsin stated, \\" ... all those wild Indians to be citizens of the United States, the Great Republic of the world, whose citizenship should be a title as proud as that of king, and whose danger is that you may degrade that citizenship (Congressional Globe, 1866, 2892).\\" =Indian Appropriations Act of 1871= In 1871 Congress added a rider to the Indian Appropriations Act ending United States recognition of additional Native American tribes or independent nations, and prohibiting additional treaties. Education and boarding schools After the Indian wars in the late 19th century, the United States established Native American boarding schools, initially run primarily by or affiliated with Christian missionaries. At this time American society thought that Native American children needed to be acculturated to the general society. The boarding school experience often proved traumatic to Native American children, who were forbidden to speak their native languages, taught Christianity and denied the right to practice their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Native American identities and adopt European-American culture. Since the late 20th century, investigations have documented cases of sexual, physical and mental abuse occurring at such schools. While problems were documented as early as the 1920s, some of the schools continued into the 1960s. Since the rise of self-determination for Native Americans, they have generally emphasized education of their children at schools near where they live. In addition, many federally recognized tribes have taken over operations of such schools and added programs of language retention and revival to strengthen their cultures. Beginning in the 1970s, tribes have also founded colleges at their reservations, controlled and operated by Native Americans, to educate their young for jobs as well as to pass on their cultures. 20th century President Woodrow Wilson speaking to Native Americans, 1913 Charles Curtis, of Kaw, Osage, Potawatomi, French and British ancestry, was 31st Vice President of the United States, 1929–1933. On August 29, 1911 Ishi, generally considered to have been the last Native American to live most of his life without contact with European-American culture, was discovered near Oroville, California after a forest fire drove him from nearby mountains. He was the last of his tribe, the rest having been massacred by a party of White \\"Indian fighters\\" in 1865 when he was a boy. After being jailed in protective custody, Ishi was released to anthropologists led by Alfred L. Kroeber at the University of California. They studied his Southern Yahi language and culture, and provided him a home until his death from tuberculosis five years later. On June 2, 1924 U.S. Republican President Calvin Coolidge signed the Indian Citizenship Act, which made citizens of the United States of all Native Americans born in the United States and its territories and who were not already citizens. Prior to passage of the act, nearly two-thirds of Native Americans were already U.S. citizens. American Indians today have all the rights guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution, can vote in elections, and run for political office. There has been controversy over how much the federal government has jurisdiction over tribal affairs, sovereignty, and cultural practices. World War II General Douglas MacArthur meeting Navajo, Pima, Pawnee and other Native American troops. Some 44,000 Native Americans served in the United States military during World War II: at the time, one-third of all able-bodied Indian men from 18 to 50 years of age. The entry of young men into the United States military during World War II has been described as the first large-scale exodus of indigenous peoples from the reservations. It involved more people than any migration since the removals from areas east of the Mississippi River of the early 19th century. The men's service with the US military in the international conflict was a turning point in Native American history. The overwhelming majority of Native Americans welcomed the opportunity to serve; they had a voluntary enlistment rate that was 40% higher than those who were drafted. War Department officials said that if the entire population had enlisted in the same proportion as the Native Americans, the response would have rendered the draft unnecessary. Their fellow soldiers often held them in high esteem, in part since the legend of the tough Native American warrior had become a part of the fabric of American historical legend. White servicemen sometimes showed a lighthearted respect toward Native American comrades by calling them \\"chief\\". Native American cultures were profoundly changed after their young men returned home, because of their wide contact with the world outside of the reservation system. \\"The war\\", said the U.S. Indian Commissioner in 1945, \\"caused the greatest disruption of Native life since the beginning of the reservation era\\", affecting the habits, views, and economic well-being of tribal members.Bernstein, p. 131 The most significant of these changes was the opportunity—as a result of wartime labor shortages—to find well-paying work in cities. After the war many Native Americans relocated to urban areas, particularly on the West Coast with the buildup of the defense industry. In the 1950s the federal government had a relocation policy encouraging them to do so because of economic opportunity in cities. But Native Americans struggled with discrimination and the great cultural changes in leaving their reservations behind. There were also losses as a result of the war. For instance, a total of 1,200 Pueblo men served in World War II; only about half came home alive. In addition many more Navajo served as Code talkers for the military in the Pacific. The code they made, although cryptologically very simple, was never cracked by the Japanese. Self-determination Military service and urban residency contributed to the rise of American Indian activism, particularly after the 1960s and the occupation of Alcatraz Island (1969–1971) by a student Indian group from San Francisco. In the same period, the American Indian Movement (AIM) was founded in Minneapolis, and chapters were established throughout the country, where American Indians combined spiritual and political activism. Political protests gained national media attention and the sympathy of the American public. Through the mid-1970s, conflicts between governments and Native Americans occasionally erupted into violence. A notable late 20th-century event was the Wounded Knee incident on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Upset with tribal government and the failures of the federal government to enforce treaty rights, about 300 Oglala Lakota and American Indian Movement (AIM) activists took control of Wounded Knee on February 27, 1973. Indian activists from around the country joined them at Pine Ridge, and the occupation became a symbol of rising American Indian identity and power. Federal law enforcement officials and the national guard cordoned off the town, and the two sides had a standoff for 71 days. During much gunfire, one United States Marshal was wounded and paralyzed. In late April a Cherokee and local Lakota man were killed by gunfire; the Lakota elders ended the occupation to ensure no more lives were lost. In June 1975, two FBI agents seeking to make an armed robbery arrest at Pine Ridge Reservation were wounded in a firefight, and killed at close range. The AIM activist Leonard Peltier was sentenced in 1976 to two consecutive terms of life in prison in the FBI deaths. In 1968 the government enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act. This gave tribal members most of the protections against abuses by tribal governments that the Bill of Rights accords to all U.S. citizens with respect to the federal government.Robert J. McCarthy, Civil Rights in Tribal Courts; The Indian Bill of Rights at 30 Years, 34 Idaho Law Review 465 (1998). In 1975 the U.S. government passed the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, marking the culmination of 15 years of policy changes. It resulted from American Indian activism, the Civil Rights Movement, and community development aspects of President Lyndon Johnson's social programs of the 1960s. The Act recognized the right and need of Native Americans for self-determination. It marked the U.S. government's turn away from the 1950s policy of termination of the relationship between tribes and the government. The U.S. government encouraged Native Americans' efforts at self-government and determining their futures. Tribes have developed organizations to administer their own social, welfare and housing programs, for instance. Tribal self-determination has created tension with respect to the federal government's historic trust obligation to care for Indians, however, the Bureau of Indian Affairs has never lived up to that responsibility.Robert J. McCarthy, The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Federal Trust Obligation to American Indians, 19 BYU J. PUB. L. 1 (December 2004) By this time, tribes had already started to establish community schools to replace the BIA boarding schools. Led by the Navajo Nation in 1968, tribes started tribal colleges and universities, to build their own models of education on reservations, preserve and revive their cultures, and develop educated workforces. In 1994 the U.S. Congress passed legislation recognizing the tribal colleges as land-grant colleges, which provided opportunities for funding. Thirty-two tribal colleges in the United States belong to the American Indian Higher Education Consortium. By the early 21st century, tribal nations had also established numerous language revival programs in their schools. In addition, Native American activism has led major universities across the country to establish Native American studies programs and departments, increasing awareness of the strengths of Indian cultures, providing opportunities for academics, and deepening research on history and cultures in the United States. Native Americans have entered academia; journalism and media; politics at local, state and federal levels; and public service, for instance, influencing medical research and policy to identify issues related to American Indians. In 1981, Tim Giago founded the Lakota Times, an independent Native American newspaper, located at the Pine Ridge Reservation but not controlled by tribal government. He later founded the Native American Journalists Association. Other independent newspapers and media corporations have been developed, so that Native American journalists are contributing perspective on their own affairs and other policies and events. In 2004 Senator Sam Brownback (Republican of Kansas) introduced a joint resolution (Senate Joint Resolution 37) to \\"offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States\\" for past \\"ill-conceived policies\\" by the U.S. government regarding Indian Tribes. President Barack Obama signed the historic apology into law in 2009, as Section 8113 of the 2010 defense appropriations bill. After years of investigation and independent work by Native American journalists, in 2003 the U.S. government indicted suspects in the December 1975 murder of Anna Mae Aquash at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. A Mi'kmaq, Aquash was the highest-ranking woman activist in the American Indian Movement (AIM) at the time. She was killed several months after two FBI agents had been killed at the reservation. Many Lakota believe that she was killed by AIM on suspicion of having been an FBI informant, but she never worked for the FBI. Arlo Looking Cloud was convicted in federal court in 2004. In 2007 the United States extradited AIM activist John Graham from Canada to stand trial for her murder. He was also convicted and sentenced to life. The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-644) is a truth-in-advertising law that prohibits misrepresentation in marketing of American Indian or Alaska Native arts and crafts products within the United States, including dreamcatchers. It is illegal to offer or display for sale, or sell any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced.  21st century  Native American tribes and individuals began to file suits against the federal government over a range of issues, especially land claims and mismanagement of trust lands and fees. A number of longstanding cases were finally settled by the administration of President Barack Obama, who made a commitment to improve relations between the federal government and the tribes. Among these was Cobell v. Salazar, a class action suit settled in 2009, with Congress appropriating funds in 2010. Another was Keepseagle v. , settled in April 2011. The $760 million settlement \\"designated $680 million for Native American farmers who had faced discrimination from the U.S. Department of Agriculture over a period of several years in the past.Rob Capriccioso, \\"Tribes Don't Like Keepseagle Lawyers Controlling $380 Million of Settlement\\", Indian Country Today, 4 September 2013; accessed 5 November 2016 By 2012, \\"the Justice and Interior departments had reached settlements totaling more than $1 billion with 41 tribes for claims of mismanagement.\\"Alysa Landry, \\"Barack Obama: ‘Emotionally and Intellectually Committed to Indian Country’\\", Indian Country Today, 1 November 2016; accessed 5 November 2016 The Navajo Nation gained the largest settlement with a single tribe, of $554 million. It is the largest tribe in the United States. In 2013 under renewal of the Violence Against Women Act, the federal government strengthened protection of Native American women, as it established authority for tribes to prosecute non-Natives who commit crimes on Indian land. Domestic and sexual abuse of Native American women has been a problem in many areas, but previous laws prevented arrest or prosecution by tribal police or courts of non-native abusive partners. Native American migration to urban areas continued to grow: 70% of Native Americans lived in urban areas in 2012, up from 45% in 1970, and 8% in 1940. Urban areas with significant Native American populations include Rapid City, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City, Denver, Phoenix, Tucson, Seattle, Chicago, Houston, and New York City. Many have lived in poverty and struggled with discrimination. Racism, unemployment, drugs and gangs were common problems which Indian social service organizations, such as the Little Earth housing complex in Minneapolis, have attempted to address.

At the age of 18 he was made conductor of the Adelaide Amateur Orchestra. He and W. C. Chapman formed the nucleus of orchestras for major social events at Government House and the Town Hall, and founded the Adelaide Orchestra, which became (Hermann) Heinicke's Grand Orchestra. He founded the Conservatorium Grand Orchestra which became the Adelaide Grand Orchestra. In 1910 he founded the Adelaide Orchestral Society. In each of these he played bassoon, and occasionally conducted. He also had some success as a composer of waltzes. He did much to promote local talent – he was prominent in raising funds to enable violinist W. L. Harris, pianist John Bishop and singer Helene Taylor to study overseas. During the Great War he was prominent in patriotic fund-raising activities: during 1915 he organised no fewer than 60 concerts featuring such musicians as the Adelaide Bach Society, Adelaide Choral Society, Adelaide Orpheus Society and soloists Delmar Hall, Brewster Jones, and Thomas Grigg. He organised concerts starring the great soloists of the day – Madame Albani, Amy Castles, Peter Dawson, Clara Serena, and Hilda Felstead. Three of his four sons, Gus (1887–1937), Cyril (1894–1971) and Frank (1899–1985), had a continuing involvement with the company. See main article for family details.

The term originated in 1967 in Haryana where excessive political horse trading, counter horse trading and counter-counter horse trading took place; triggering several rounds of frequent political defections by the serial-turncoat politicians within a span of few weeks; resulting in the dissolution of the Haryana Legislative Assembly and consequently the fresh elections were held in 1968. It became the subject of numerous jokes and cartoons. After 1967, several parties in India often continued to be involved in this type of political horse trading to grab the power. To end this trend, an anti-defection law was passed in 1985. The trend still continues to surface every now and then,Paras Diwan, 1979, Aya Ram Gaya Ram: The Politics Of Defection, Journal of the Indian Law Institute, Vol. 21, No. 3, July–September 1979, pp. 291-312. by exploiting the loopholes in existing anti-defection laws to benefit a specific party through further horse-trading, counter-defections, formation of unholy alliances and electoral fraud. This misuse, by the collusion of corrupt politicians/parties with the partisan Speaker and/or Governor, can be somewhat prevented by the political opponents (losing side in the political intrigue) by going to the court for immediate intervention. Origin of the term The term was coined when Gaya Lal, a Member of the Legislative Assembly from Pataudi Vidhan Sabha constituency in Haryana, won elections as an independent candidate in 1967 and joined the Indian National Congress (INC), and thereafter he changed parties thrice in a fortnight, first by politically defecting from the Indian National Congress (INC) to the United Front, then counter defecting back to INC, and then counter-counter-defected within nine hours to United Front again. When Gaya Lal quit the United Front and join the INC, then INC leader Rao Birendra Singh who had engineered Gaya Lal's defection to INC, brought Gaya Lal to a press conference at Chandigarh and declared \\"Gaya Ram was now Aya Ram\\". This triggered the worst cyclic game of the political defections, the counter-defections, the counter-counter- defections, and so on, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the Haryana Legislative Assembly and the President's rule was imposed.As turncoats grab headlines, a look back at the original 'Aaya Ram, Gaya Ram', The Print, 19 May 2018. Infamous Lals of Haryana politics Even after 1967, Gaya Lal frequently kept switching political parties and contested legislative assembly elections in Haryana under numerous parties, i.e. the Akhil Bhartiya Arya Sabha in 1972, joined the Bhartiya Lok Dal under Chaudhary Charan Singh in 1974, won the seat as a Janata Party candidate in 1977 after the Lok Dal merged with the Janata Party. Gaya Lal, a frequent floor-crosser who became the source of the coining of the term Aaya Ram Gaya Ram, his son Udai Bhan is also a politician who has frequently crossed the floor, in 1987 he won legislative assembly elections as a candidate of the Lok Dal (Bahuguna faction), in 1991 lost as a candidate of the Janata party, in 1996 lost as an independent candidate, in 2000 joined INLD after winning as an independent candidate but faced charges under the anti-defection law in 2004 for crossing- over to INC, in 2005 won as a candidate of INC. Since the formation of Haryana in 1966, the state politics became infamously dominated by the nepotistic clans of 5 political dynasts, Lal trio (Devi Lal, Bansi Lal and Bhajan Lal) as well as the Hooda clan and Rao Birender clan.In the land of fence-sitters, Millennium Post.How 5 families over 3 generations have controlled Haryana's politics from day one, The Print,-29 Apr 2019. Anti-defection law  An anti-defection law was passed in 1985 to prevent such defections. It was included in the constitution by Rajiv Gandhi government as a part of the tenth schedule of the Indian constitution (Article 190 of the Indian Constitution deals in the anti-defection law). The anti-defection law, applicable to both Parliament and state assemblies, specifies the process for the Presiding Officer of a legislature (Speaker) to disqualify a legislators on grounds of defection based on a petition by any other member of the House. Defection is defined as either voluntarily giving up the membership of his party or disobeying (abstaining or voting against) the directives (political whip) of the party leadership on a vote in legislature. Legislators can change their party without the risk of disqualification to merge with or into another party provided that at least two-thirds of the legislators are in favour of the merger, neither the members who decide to merge, nor the ones who stay with the original party will face disqualification. The Supreme Court mandated that in the absence of a formal resignation, the giving up of membership can be determined by the conduct of a legislator, such as publicly expressing opposition to their party or support for another party, engaging in anti-party activities, criticizing the party on public forums on multiple occasions, and attending rallies organised by opposition parties. The Presiding Officer has no time limit to make his decision, for example if less than two-thirds of the legislators of a party defect then the Presiding Officer can use his discretion to either disqualify the legislators before a vote of no confidence is held or delay the decision on disqualification until after the \\"vote of no confidence\\" is held. In another example, if less than two-thirds of the legislators of a party defect together in more than one batch in such a way that the combined strength of the united defectors is more than two-thirds before the decision on the defection is made, the Presiding Officer can use his discretion to either disqualify each batch of the defecting legislators or accept the combined batches of the defectors as the legal defection (no disqualification). This allows a possibility of the misuse by the Presiding Officer to benefit a specific party through further horse-trading (counter- defections), formation of unholy alliances or electoral fraud by exploiting the loopholes in the existing anti-defection laws. However, the decision of the Presiding Officer is subject to the judicial review by courts.The Anti- Defection Law Explained, prsindia.org.

Hirsch was born on 29 March 1893 in Glina, Croatia to a Jewish family of Bertold and Josefina Hirsch. After high school education Hirsch studied medicine at the Medical University of Vienna, Innsbruck Medical University and University of Prague. During World War I, as a student, he was recruited and mobilized in the Austro-Hungarian Army. He was stationed in the village Bršadin, near Vukovar in the Vukovar-Syrmia County. During the war Hirsch gained extensive experience in the field of venerology and other communicable diseases. In 1919 he finished specialization at the Rudolf Virchow Hospital in Berlin, where he studied epidemiology of bacterial meningitis. In 1923 Hirsch was appointed as head of the newly founded Community health center Osijek and head of the infectious diseases department at the Osijek Hospital. Hirsch was also named, in 1924, director of the Epidemiological Institute Osijek which he founded. His great merit was in combating infectious diseases, not only in the Osijek area but also in the wider Slavonia region. During World War II physician Miroslav Schlesinger organized the departure of the Croatian Jewish doctors to Bosnia to combat endemic syphilis in 1941. 80 Jewish doctors were sent to Bosnia by Independent State of Croatia authorities, as a Jew among them was Hirsch. Most of those doctors would later flee to join the Partisans. Hirsch was married to Josefine (née Roubitschek), with whom he had a daughter Ruth. In 1942 Hirsch was deported from Derventa to Jasenovac concentration camp where he was killed together with his wife, daughter, granddaughter and sister.

Early career  Jón Ásgeir's parents were Jóhannes Jónsson (1940-2013) and Ása Karen Ásgeirsdóttir (1942-), who both worked at the Sláturfélag Suðurlands in Reykjavík. Jón Ásgeir was later to marry Ingibjörg Stefanía (1961-), the daughter of Pálmi Jónsson. Jón Ásgeir has three children with his former wife Linda Margrét Stefánsdóttir: Ása Karen, Anton Felix and Stefán Franz Jónsson (and Ingibjörg has three children: Sigurður Pálmi, Júlíana Sól and Melkorka Katrín).'Í minningu kaupmanns Jóhannes Jónsson', supplement to Fréttablaðið, August 7, 2013, p. 1. Jón Ásgeir given the following thumbnail portrait by Ármann Þorvaldsson: :: The man who was to become the face of the Icelandic business community abroad was Jon Asgeir Johannesson ... With his rugged good looks, he would soon be portrayed in the foreign press as the seductive playboy from the north with glacier eyes ... He was already wearing his trademark leather jackets and had a slight ‘bad boy’ aura about him that followed him wherever he went. Jon Asgeir is a complex character; you could ask ten different people who know him to describe him and they would all give you different answers. To people that didn’t know him, he came across as a very timid person ... If he didn’t know people, he could grow very quiet, but as soon as the conversation shifted to business and deals, he got very animated. Most of the people who did business with him in the UK found him very charming.Ármann Þorvaldsson, Frozen Assets: How I Lived Iceland's Boom and Bust (Chichester: Wiley, 2009). Jón Ásgeir's father, Jóhannes Jónsson, managed a shop, and Jón Ásgeir worked there as a child; starting at the age of thirteen, he rented out supermarket amusement rides;Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), p. 76. 'during his school years, he always had his own business going on the side, selling popcorn through special stands he set up in shopping malls'. Jón Ásgeir attended the Commercial College of Iceland but in 1989 left before graduating in order to join his recently unemployed father in founding Iceland's first low-price supermarket, Bónus, the first shop being a four-hundred square-metre establishment in Skútuvogur.Magnús Halldórsson and Þórður Snær Júlíusson, Ísland ehf. Auðmenn og áhrif eftir hrun (Reykjavík: Vaka-Helgafell, 2013), p. 83. Within a few years, Bónus was the second largest retailer in Iceland. Business empire during the Icelandic boom In August 1992, Bónus's main competitor, Hagkaup, bought a 50% share in Bónus; Hagkaup was owned by the children of its founder, Pálmi Jónsson,Magnús Halldórsson and Þórður Snær Júlíusson, Ísland ehf. Auðmenn og áhrif eftir hrun (Reykjavík: Vaka-Helgafell, 2013), pp. 83-84. one of whom, Ingibjörg Stefanía Pálmadóttir, Jón would later marry. Baugur Group was created to co-ordinate purchases by the two chains in 1993; following at times acrimonious negotiations between Jón Ásgeir and Pálmi's children, Baugur succeeded in acquiring Hagkaup in 1998, with Jón Ásgeir as CEO, making him 'one of the most powerful businessmen in Iceland'.Cf. Magnús Halldórsson and Þórður Snær Júlíusson, Ísland ehf. Auðmenn og áhrif eftir hrun (Reykjavík: Vaka-Helgafell, 2013), p. 84. Following expansion of Bónus into the Faroe Islands in 1994, Baugur acquired a number of Icelandic retailers and expanded abroad: Nýkaup, Aðföng, Útilíf by 1998; and in 2001 Bill’s Dollar Stores and Bonus Dollar Stores in the USA along with Topshop and a significant share in Arcadia Group in the UK.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 76, 113. Baugur went on to buy and trade significant shares in the Big Food Group, at that time owner of Iceland Foods and Booker, House of Fraser, Somerfield, and Mothercare by 2003 and by 2008 French Connection, Oasis, Karen Millen, Whistles, Debenhams, Goldsmiths, Woolworths, and Moss Bros.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 115-16. Jón Ásgeir has served as a board member in Iceland Foods Plc (chairman), Booker Plc, House of Fraser Plc, Hamleys, Magasin Du Nord (chairman), Oasis/Karen Millen, Whistles and All Saints. In 1999, Jón Ásgeir took a major role in forming the consortium Orca with a view to acquiring the first Icelandic bank to be privatised, the investment bank Fjarfestingarbanki Atvinnulifsinns (FBA).Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 55-57; Ármann Þorvaldsson, Frozen Assets: How I Lived Iceland's Boom and Bust (Chichester: Wiley, 2009). FBA merged with Iceland's previous private bank, Íslandsbanki, in 2000; renamed Glitnir, Baugur's holdings in this bank gave Jón Ásgeir a key place in the Icelandic banking sector.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), p. 57. He retired as CEO of Baugur Group in May 2002 and became Chairman of the company, and then took back the CEO's chair in November the same year. Meanwhile, in 2002, Jón Ásgeir acquired one of Iceland's two main newspapers, Fréttablaðið (via Gunnar Smari Egilsson), increasing his political influence.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), p. 79. At the end of 2003, Baugur Group had grown so much under the leadership of Jon Asgeir that no other Icelandic companies had equal activity abroad, and it was the largest company in Iceland. At the height of his success, 'Jon Asgeir and his wife, Ingibjörg Pálmadottir—owner of the boutique hotel 101 in Reykjavik and daughter of a retail magnate—owned a 145-foot yacht ... and a seven-thousand-square-foot apartment, complete with bulletproof panic room, on Gramercy Park in New York'.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), p. 62. By autumn 2007, Baugur's holdings within Iceland, by its own reckoning, were worth around 100 billion krónur; and these accounted for only 35% of its activities. Jón Ásgeir's career was marked by a mutual dislike between him and his critic Davíð Oddsson, one of the most powerful politicians in Iceland. While it is not clear to precisely what extent Davíð Oddsson's personal dislike of Jón Ásgeir was the cause of interventions by the state and judiciary in Jón Ásgeir's activities, there is little doubt that there was some relationship.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), passim. In the analysis of Davíð's close associate Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson, :: Jón Ásgeir Jóhannesson ... became the most powerful man in Iceland ... after his critic, Davíð Oddsson, stepped down as Prime Minister. The market capitalism of 1991–2004 was transformed into the crony capitalism of 2004–2008. Not only did Jón Ásgeir and his cronies control two-thirds of the retail business, they also owned almost all the private media and one of the three banks, while having good access to the other two banks. It did not seem to make any difference to opinion-makers that Jón Ásgeir was investigated, indicted and convicted for breaking the law on business practices, being given a three months suspended prison sentence.Hannes H. Gissurarson, 'Five Years On: What Happened? What Did We Learn?', The Reykjavík Grapevine, 15 (2013), 16.  Role in the 2008–11 Icelandic financial crisis  At the end of September 2008, the bank Glitnir status became increasingly strained resulting in the government acquiring it by buying a 75% stake for 84 billion. Even so, it collapsed, and the government revoked its purchase.Eirikur Bergmann, Iceland and the International Financial Crisis: Boom, Bust and Recovery (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), pp. 88-132. According to The Report of the Investigation Commission of Althing into the 2008 crash, 'the company which was most extensively in business with the Icelandic banks was Baugur Group and related parties. He borrowed in total, more than a billion dollars from all three national Icelandic banks: Glitnir, Kaupþing, and Landsbanki'Magnús Halldórsson and Þórður Snær Júlíusson, Ísland ehf.

Criminal charges and convictions  * On 17 August 2005 Jón Ásgeir and others were charged with 40 violations of the law regarding accounting. Most offenses regards transfers between himself and the company. The Supreme Court referred the case back to the District Court of Reykjavík in autumn 2005 because of procedural errors. * On 3 May 2007, Johannesson was found guilty on a single charge of a breach of book-keeping rules, with the conviction being upheld on appeal on 6 June 2008. Johannesson was given a 3-month suspended prison sentence. It also left his position as chairman uncertain under Icelandic law because the conviction meant that he could not serve on any company board for 3 years. As a consequence of this, and the fact that much of Baugur's portfolio was now based in the UK, in July 2008 Baugur considered relocating to the UK, where Johannesson could keep his board position. * In February 2013, he was sentenced in a tax fraud case to 12 months in prison, suspended, and fined for ISK62m, €400.000.

This ruling was overruled by The European Court of Human Rights in May 2017. Jón Ásgeir has also been charged by the Office of the Special Prosecutor in connection with his role in the financial crisis, but as of June 2017 he has been cleared two times in the same case. That case is waiting for Supreme Court for final decision.  Violation of Jon Asgeir´s human rights  On 18th of May 2017 The European Court of Human Rights found the Icelandic government guilty of violating Jon Asgeir´s human rights by punishing him twice for the same act. That violated 7th Protocol of The European Convention on Human Rights. http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{\\"languageisocode\\":[\\"ENG\\"],\\"documentcollectionid2\\":[\\"JUDGMENTS\\"],\\"itemid\\":[\\"001-173498\\"]} Appearances in popular culture Jón Ásgeir is the main protagonist of Óttar M.

It is at Massanze, near Uvira. The White Fathers reached Lake Tanganyika in January 1879, and established a station at Rumonge on the east side of the lake. They founded the mission of Mulwewa opposite Rumonge, on the west side of the lake, in the region of Massange in response to an appeal from Massange. The mission was founded by Father Deniaud, the Superior of the Tanganyika mission, with Fathers Moinet and Delaunay, leaving Rumonge on 25 November 1880. They reached Mulwewa and founded the station on 28 November 1880. After Deniaud returned, on 1 February 1881 he sent Father Auguste Moncet to replace him at Mulwewa, where Moncet busied himself teaching youth and helping erect the mission buildings. The station was on a narrow plateau that looked over the lake. Mulwewa became a place of refuge for orphans redeemed from slave traders. The priests did not at first build any fortifications. In 1882 Léopold Louis Joubert, a former Papal Zouave, built palisades and moats around the station for protection. He also trained the local people in the use of arms so that they could defend the mission against slavers. After Mulwewa, the White Fathers founded the stations of Kibanga on 11 June 1883, Mkapakwe on 12 September 1884, Mpala on 8 July 1885 and Baudouinville on 8 May 1893. The local potentate, Rumaliza, tolerated the foundation of the missions at Mulwewa and Kibanga, but prevented establishment of a station at Ujiji, at the extreme northeast of the lake. The mission at Mulwewa was abandoned soon after the acquisition of the stations of Mpala and Karema in 1885. In September 1886 the missionary Mathurin Guillemé visited Mulwewa, finding it in ruins.

Very little is known of him, though a Pieter Verdonck was recorded in the Reformed Church of Haarlem as coming from Ghent when he was engaged to be married in 1597 to Catharina Gelaynis of Vlissingen.Website Piet Verdonk He was probably a friend of Hals, who painted him in the guise of Samson holding the jawbone. Perhaps his friend was not amused, because the painting was later painted over to reflect a man holding a wine glass and his wild hair was covered by a velvet beret. According to the RKD the jawbone is from a cow.Portrait of a man holding a cow's jawbone in the RKD The jawbone was meant however to symbolize the jawbone of the ass that was used by Samson to slay 1,000 Philistines. The portrait has been identified \\"Verdonck\\" because of the engraving made by Jan van de Velde with a short poem describing the subject, which loosely translated, meant \\"This is Verdonck, the bold guest whose jawbone attacks everyone/ By not distinguishing between high or low born, he landed in the work house\\". The poem could be seen as moralistic warning to rederijkers whose satiric discourses went too far. Both Hals and his contemporary Salomon de Bray were rederijkers in Haarlem. De Bray made a pair of pendant pieces in a similar genre depicting David with his sword and Samson with his jawbone. De Bray's version shows Samson a moment later in the story, when he prayed to God out of thirst and was rewarded with the \\"fountain of the crier\\".Story of Samson in the Liesveltbijbel of 1542 in the DBNL Hals' portrait shows the moment where Samson in triumph proclaims that \\"with the jawbone of an ass, he slayed 1,000 Philistines\\". The fact that Hals painted his subject in close up, cutting off the knuckles of his fist, leads one to conclude the painting was meant more as a tronie than as a portrait.

Kenard is a younger member of Namond Brice's circle of friends. He is first seen in season 3, where, following a prolonged gunfight at a Barksdale stashhouse, Kenard argues with his friends over which one gets to pretend to be Omar Little while playing in the area and re- enacting the gunfight. He is not shown to be living with a family and is never seen attending school, but instead deals drugs for the Stanfield Organization. Biography Season 3 Kenard is usually seen in the background playing in Hamsterdam. Other than that he is not seen that much, except for when he is seen fighting with another kid over who gets to play Omar Little next. Season 4 Kenard is frequently seen hanging out with Namond's circle of friends, often making fun of Duquan \\"Dukie\\" Weems. Kenard works with Donut and Randy Wagstaff delivering flyers on Election Day. He also works with Namond, Donut, and Byron selling drugs. Despite being the youngest of his friends he is consistently the most profane. Namond makes him his lieutenant and allows Kenard to store their package of narcotics. However, Kenard's street smarts allow him to see right through Namond's soft nature, and after Kenard steals the package from Namond, claims the police took it, and insults Namond, Kenard is savagely beaten by Michael. However, in the season 4 finale, Kenard is seen working on Michael's new corner with Dukie. Kenard approached Roland \\"Prez\\" Pryzbylewski who was watching Dukie from afar, to try to sell him drugs. Season 5 Kenard pulls a prank on the cops while working on Michael's corner, and later in the season, Kenard confronts Dukie complaining Dukie is not doing his job dealing drugs as part of Michael's crew, Kenard is unaware that Michael took Dukie off the streets so he could take care of Michael's kid brother Bug. After Kenard insults him, Dukie punches Kenard, and the two get into a brief scuffle that Dukie wins. However, Spider is also present and gives Dukie a severe beating. Kenard and company are held at gunpoint by Omar, who is in on a mission to terrorize Marlo Stanfield's corners in an attempt to lure him into the streets. Kenard is unimpressed by the sight of the now- crippled Omar hobbling on a crutch and loses the sense of awe and respect for him that he and his friends once shared. While in an alley with some friends, dousing a cat with lighter fluid and apparently planning to light it on fire, Kenard sees Omar approaching. The rest of his friends flee, but Kenard remains and then proceeds to trail Omar as Omar robs a Stanfield corner and stash house. Kenard then follows Omar into a Korean-owned corner store and shoots him in the head, instantly killing him. Shocked, Kenard drops the gun and flees. In the series finale, Kenard is shown during the closing montage, being led away by Detective Crutchfield, the detective in charge of investigating Omar's murder.

He was a client of Thomas Cromwell, and later of John Alan, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and this connection ultimately led to his downfall. He is best remembered as an ancestor of the 1st Duke of Wellington. Background The Colley/Cowley family originated in Rutland, where they were long associated with the village of Glaston. Records show that Walter Cowley (born about 1489 & died 1551 not 1548). Moved to Ireland with his father Robert about 1505-06 as Judges & merchants from Rutlandshire. 1407 his 4 greats grandfather Walter was the Portreeve(Sheriff)of Kilkenny Ire. 9-22-1511 the Mayor of Drogheda granted a case for Walter to find a Chaplin. 1537 was appointed Solicitor General of Ireland. Imprisoned in the Tower of London with his brother Robert Cowley an (Irish Judge). 1541-several letters were wrote to King Henry III pleading for clemency for him & his brother Robert which still exists. When released he was restored to Royal Favour, Surrendered his office to John Bathe in 1546, later was Surveyor General in Ireland. He left a considerable fortune to his son Sir Henry who acquired & was the first to live in the Carbery Castle in 1554. Walter was Surveyor General in Kildare in 1550 & died possibly in Kildare Ireland. Walters Great Uncle was John Colley the 1st. Lord of Glaston, Rutlandshire, Eng. & brother to his Great grandfather Walter Cowley born 1440 in Glaston. When Great Uncle John Colley the first Lord of Glaston died his oldest son Sir Anthony Colley who became a member of Parliament had 2 daughters & a son Anthony. Robert Cowley (judge), the son of Walter of Glaston later moved to Ireland about 1505-06, with his sons Walter & Robert (Jr) during King Henry VII's reign, and had a highly successful career as merchants etc. becoming Master of the Rolls in Ireland in 1536, but ultimately fell from power about 1540.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p. 203 Early career By the mid 1530s Walter had developed political ambitions of his own; he and his father both became clients of Thomas Cromwell.Hart, A. R. The History of the King's Serjeants-at-law in Ireland Dublin Four Courts Press 2000 p. 31 This led to a clash with Patrick Barnewall, another client of Cromwell; Walter clearly hoped to replace Barnewall as Solicitor General for Ireland, and did replace him as Receiver of Customs for Drogheda.Hart p. 31 Both the Cowleys sought to blacken Barnewall's name, accusing him in particular of questioning the King's authority, a very serious matter given the ruthless fashion in which Henry VIII dealt with dissent. Barnewall was so alarmed that he offered to resign in Walter's favour; but Cromwell wished to retain the services of both men, and a separate office of Principal Solicitor for Ireland was created for Walter.Hart p.37 Odd though this arrangement may seem, it probably helped to alleviate the burden of work for the two senior Law Officers, and continued for many years after Walter's removal. Walter also clashed with James Bathe, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer 1540–1570; Walter's father had attacked Bathe as a \\"presumptuous upstart\\" as early as 1525.Ó Mathuna, Seán P. William Bathe 1564–1614 – a Pioneer in Linguistics John Benjamins 1986 p.9 The Rebellion of Silken Thomas must have seemed an excellent opportunity to block Bathe's advancement, since his father-in-law John Burnell was one of the principal rebels. However Bathe possessed both influential friends and the ability to avoid becoming tied to any political faction: his rise to power was a clear sign that the Cowleys' political influence was in decline.Ó Mathúna p.9 Later career After Cromwell's downfall Walter sought the patronage of the Lord Chancellor, John Alan, who belonged to a faction opposed to the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Anthony St Leger. Since St Leger was notoriously hot- tempered his ensuing quarrel with St Leger was probably not of Walter's making, but he showed a serious lack of judgment, which led to his removal from office. His father was already out of favour and had been imprisoned in the Fleet Prison.Ball p. 203 In an effort to conciliate James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond, who had regained much of his family's former influence, St Leger gave him command of the Irish forces in the war against Scotland in 1544.Dudley Edwards, Robert Ireland in the Age of the Tudors Croom Helm London 1977 p. 58 Ormond received an anonymous letter at Gowran, accusing St Leger of deliberately exposing him to danger. It emerged that Walter had written the letter, although he insisted that an associate of his called Cantwell had been responsible.Dudley Edwards p. 59 In a further blunder, Walter and Lord Chancellor Alan drew up a book of articles, accusing St Leger of widespread maladministration. St Leger demanded an inquiry by the Privy Council of England, which exonerated him entirely. Walter was deprived of office and imprisoned in the Tower of London;Dudley Edwards p. 59 the State papers preserve an abject letter he wrote to the King pleading for clemency and saying that he had acted out of genuine fear for Ormond's life.State Papers for the Reign of Henry VIII Vol. III p. 580 He was eventually released, and apparently regained a degree of favour, being appointed Surveyor-General shortly before he died in 1548. Since his family were able to purchase Carbury Castle, County Kildare, within a few years of his death, it is likely that he left a considerable fortune. A Memorial of Walter exists in Glaston, Rutlandshire Eng. Descendants His wife's name is unknown: he had two sons of whom the elder, Sir Henry Colley of Carbury Castle (died 1584), was a distinguished soldier and a direct ancestor of Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington. Richard changed the family name to Wesley, and was the grandfather of the 1st Duke of Wellington.Longford, Elizabeth Wellington-the Years of the Sword Panther Edition 1971 p. 29 Character Historians have little good to say of Walter Cowley: he and his father have been described as \\"ambitious mischief-makers\\".Hart p. 30 He should not perhaps be blamed for the abject tone of his letter to Henry VIII from the Tower of London pleading for mercy, since he may well have feared for his life at the time he wrote it. On the other hand, his intrigues against Barnewall and Bathe show him in an extremely unattractive light.Hart p.30 References Category:Irish lawyers Category:Principal Solicitors for Ireland Category:1500s births Category:1548 deaths Category:16th-century Irish people Category:Irish people of English descent Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:People from County Kildare ","title":"Walter Cowley"},{"id":"39108707","text":"BHB CABLE TV (full legal name: BHB CABLE TV d.o.o.) is Cable Television and Cable Internet service provider in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It is named after palaeontologist and perissodactyl expert Leonard Radinsky who died prematurely in 1985. Before the discovery of Radinskya, palaeontologists speculated on an American origin for the tethythere-perissodactyl radiation that took place during the Paleocene-Eocene transition (around ). The primitive Radinskya from China made it clear that this radiation began in Asia during the Paleocene, from where it spread to North America, Europe, and Africa during the Eocene. With its enigmatic position at the base of this radiation, Radinskya is a member of the Chinese Paleocene fauna which includes primitive tethytheres such as Minchenella and the oldest arsinoitheres; it shares many characters with perissodactyls and some with phenacolophids, but is too primitive to be called either a horse, a rhino, or a tapir. Radinskya is known only from a partial skull and upper dentition, which makes it difficult to assess its relationships to other fossils. described the upper molars as \\"quadrate with a rhomboid outline and a weak, π-shaped crown pattern formed by the incipient ectoloph, protoloph, and metaloph (crests on the crowns). This arrangement closely resembles the crown pattern of early perissodactyls, but the strong conules (cusps) and some other characters suggest relationship to phenacolophids\\" and added that \\"Radinskya may be the sister taxon of all other Altungulata or may be closer to the origin of Perissodactyla than is any phenacodontid.\\" Radinskya has also been included into the Embrithopoda, treated as an outgroup to perissodactyls. and Other Nongshanian phenacolophids include Yuelophus, Tienshanilophus, Ganolophus and the large form Minchenella.

Plot: Tatiana finds work as a nurse at Ellis Island, where she and Anthony start living. She befriends Vikki, another nurse, and Edward Ludlow,a doctor, who Vikki believes has taken a liking for Tatiana. Although she has started to build a new life for herself and Anthony, the possibility that Alexander might still be alive haunts her. Her suspicions are further raised by Alexander's Hero of the Soviet Union medal which she finds in her bag. Tatiana buys land in Arizona from the money that Alexander had hidden in the Bronze Horseman book. Gradually, she starts getting over her past, and is known to everyone as the \\"Angel of Ellis\\", because of all the immigrants she has helped get jobs. Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, Alexander narrowly escapes death at the hands of the Soviet Government. However, he is ordered to lead a battalion of convicted criminals and head westward into Germany. Alexander finds this to his advantage, as then he could escape to America. He, after losing many men, finally makes it to German soil, where he encounters Pasha Metanov. He had survived the attack on the train, and joined the German Army. When he comes to know about his family, and Alexander's plan, he agrees to surrender to the Germans. Thus, they are taken to Colditz. When they try to escape, Pasha succumbs an illness, while Alexander is imprisoned again. Once the war is over, POWs from all around Europe are sent back home, except for the Soviets. Alexander is sentenced to twenty five years in a work camp. Tatiana volunteers as a Red Cross nurse, and eventually finds Alexander. She helps him escape and they make it to the American Embassy in Berlin. Once back home, Alexander meets Anthony for the first time. Vikki is also happy to have finally met him.

Each TecTile is a low-cost self-adhesive sticker with an embedded NFC Tag. They are programmed before use, which can be done simply by the user, using a downloadable Android app. When an NFC-capable phone is placed or 'tapped' on a Tag, the programmed action is undertaken. This could cause a website to be displayed, the phone switched to silent mode, or many other possible actions. NFC Tags are an application of RFID technology. Unlike most RFID, which makes an effort to give a long reading range, NFC deliberately limits this range to only a few inches or almost touching the phone to the Tag. This is done deliberately, so that Tags have no effect on a phone unless there is a clear user action to 'trigger' the Tag. Although phones are usually touched to Tags, this does not require any 'docking' or galvanic contact with the Tag, so they are still considered to be a non-contact technology. Although NFC Tags can be used with many smartphones, TecTiles gained much prominence in late 2012 with the launch of the Galaxy SIII.  Applications  Some applications are intended for customising the behaviour of a user's own phone according to a location, e.g. a quiet mode when placed on a bedside table; others are intended for public use, e.g. publicising web content about a location.This could be used to build a system similar to QRpedia. This programming is carried out entirely on the Tag. Subject to security settings, any compatible phone would have the same response when tapped on the Tag. When the Tag's response is a Facebook 'Like' or similar, this is carried out under the phone user's credentials (such as a Facebook identity), rather than the Tag's identity. Samsung group Tags' functions under four headings: Settings, Phone, Web and Social. A handful of examples: ; Settings * Enter 'quiet' or 'in-car' mode * Set an alarm clock * Launch an app * Join a WiFi network. This could be used for giving convenient access to coffee shop networks. * Show a message ; Phone * Make a call * Send a text * Share a contact vCard ; Web * Open a web page * Show a location on a mapping service, such as Google maps * Check-in to Foursquare, or other location-based services. ; Social * Update Facebook status with a location * 'Like' on Facebook * Send a tweet * Follow a Twitter user Tags may also be pre-programmed and distributed to users. Such a Tag could be set to take the user to a manufacturer's service support page and sent out stuck to washing machines or other domestic whitegoods. Factory-prepared Tags can also be printed with logos, or moulded into forms apart from stickers, such as key fobs or wristbands.  Lifespan  The re-programmability of a Tag is claimed at over 100,000 programming cycles. A Tag placed on a doorway or noticeboard may be re-programmed in situ and could thus have a long life (e.g. many conferences, meetings or events). Tags may be locked after programming, to avoid unauthorized reprogramming. Locked tags may be unlocked only by the same phone that locked them. The duration of a locked Tag's relevance will be the main constraint on Tag lifetime if unlocking is not possible. The lifespan of a Tag is also likely to be limited by physical factors such as the glue adhesion, or the difficulty of peeling them from the glue.  Compatibility  The TecTile app is not installed by default. If a Tag is read before it is installed, the user is directed to the app download site. Using a Samsung TecTile NFC tag requires a device with the MIFARE Classic chipset. This chipset is based on NXP's NFC controller, which is outside the NFC Forum's standard. Using a TecTile thus requires the NXP chipset. The NXP chipset is found in many Android phones. Recently Android phone manufacturers have chosen to drop TecTile support; notably in Samsung's latest flagship phone the Galaxy S4 and Google's Nexus 4. TecTiles also do not work with BlackBerry and Windows NFC phones. The new version of TecTile, called TecTile 2, have improved compatibility, but currently the Samsung Galaxy S4 is the only device that comes with native support for TecTile 2. NFC Tags that do comply with NFC Forum Type 1 or Type 2 compatibility protocols are much more widely compatible than the MIFARE dependant Samsung TecTile, and are also widely available. Popular standards compliant NFC Tags are the NTAG213 (137 bytes of usable memory), and the Topaz 512 (480 bytes of usable memory).  Tag encoding  The need for the installed app is one of the drawbacks to TecTile and to NFC Tags in general. The basic NFC Tag standards support Tags carrying URLs, where the scheme or protocol (e.g. the \`http://\` prefix) may be either \`http\` (for web addresses), \`tel\` for telephony, or an anonymous \`data\` scheme. Although support for the \`http\` and \`tel\` schemes may be assumed in a basic handset, support for the others will not be available unless an App has been installed and registered to handle them. In general, NFC Tags (in the non-TecTile sense) are only useful for web addresses and telephony. To provide features beyond this, Samsung offers the TecTile App. This could have used any scheme on a tag, or even invented a whole new scheme. When installed, such an App would register itself to handle these new schemes. However the App is not part of the default install for a handset, even a Samsung. To allow users to install the App automatically, on first encountering a TecTile, all the TecTile's sophisticated and phone-specific features are still provided through the \`http\` scheme. The basic URL is that for initially downloading the App, details of the TecTile operation are encoded as URL parameters within the query string in addition to this. When reading a Tag, one of two things happens: * On first reading a Tag, without the App installed, the Tag's \`http\` scheme takes the handset user to the App download site. * On reading a Tag with the App installed, the App recognises the download URL and suppresses the handset's usual web browsing behaviour. It then use the query string embedded within the URL to instead activate the TecTile function requested. This convoluted behaviour was chosen to make the App effectively self-installing for naive users. Why the App was not supplied as default is unknown. The downsides of this design choice though are that the URLs required to activate TecTile functions are relatively long, meaning that non-TecTile NFC Tags with limited memory size (137 bytes) cannot generally be used for functions other than web addresses. Additionally, the lack of a non-proprietary approach to these more capable functions limits the development of NFC Tags as a general technique across all such handsets, rather than just Samsung TecTiles.

Background In 2001 Rajabi, a member of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), was seriously wounded by agents of the Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran. He was captured and arrested. In 2006, a death sentence was issued after his arrest but later he was condemned to life imprisonment. According to reports by the Iranian Liberty Association, Rajabi was repeatedly submitted to extended periods of physical and psychological torture, both in Dize Abad and later in Tehran's Evin Prison, where he was also held in isolation. They also report that, as a means of trying to force him to abandon his opposition to the regime, the mullah's agents subjected Rajabi to mock executions, but he refused to surrender. Abdolreza Rajabi was transferred to Gohardasht Prison on 26 October 2008. From there he was able to contact his family to inform them of the transfer, before the call was terminated by agents of the mullah's regime.

The Buildings of England: Nottinghamshire. p.121. Harmondsworth, Middlesex. Penguin. A church in Elkesleigh or Elchersleigh is mentioned in the Domesday Book. It was dedicated to All Saints or All Hallows, as confirmed in wills of parishioners from the 15th and 16th centuries. The shift to a dedication to St Giles was probably initiated at some point in the first half of the 19th century: White’s Directory cites the church as St Giles for the first time in 1844, though there are still later references to All Hallows. The building is in the decorated gothic style and made from local limestone. The church consists of a nave, north aisle, chancel, and an embattled west tower with pinnacles. New pews were installed in 1845, and at the same time some parts of the church were partly rebuilt. Memorials include: * Catherine Sharpe, 1764, by Ant. Ince. South chancel * Edward and John Buckles, Mansfield. North chancel  Bells There are three bells in the tower. They are dedicated in Latin: 1) missi de celis habeao nomen gabrielis 2) hec pro laude pie resonat campana marie 3) nomen sanctorum hec campana olocum [a misspelling; possibly \\"o locum\\"?] Evidence suggests that they were cast by the mid-15th century, and the founder is unknown. The first bell, ‘Gabriel’, weighs 4 cwt (about 450 lbs) and is 26¼ inches in diameter. ‘Mary’ is heavier, with a total weight of 5 cwt (about 560 lbs) and a 29 inch diameter. 'All Saints' [sic] is 6 cwt (about 670 lbs) and has a diameter of 32¼ inches. Owing to the precarious state of the wooden supports for the bells, the peal is considered unringable. These bells are one of only two peals in Nottinghamshire that date from before the Reformation, the other being at the Church of St John of Beverley, Scarrington, possibly by the same founder. In addition to their age and dedication, the bells are significant in their tuning, which lies between the beginning of a modern major and minor scale.

History Albanian law provided for the creation of an air arm with 3 reconnaissance aircraft, 3 spare engines and 39 officers and men; this may be \\"left over\\" from 1913, when Albania had ordered three Löhner \\"B\\" biplanes. Time magazine's April 17, 1939 article on the invasion reported that Albania possessed two aircraft, and at least one internet source says there were two trainers in service. In 1931, 1934 and 1937 King Zog had ordered the creation of an air force, but civil unrest had each time prevented this. During the Thirties several Albanian officers had received flight training in Italy, including a nephew of Zog who was a flying cadet at the Italian aeronautical academy at Caserta. Photographs exist of an Albatros C.XV aircraft after delivery to Albania c. 1922, and according to a posting on an internet forum, 5 \\"Albatros-Fokker\\" aircraft were delivered at that time. A German aircraft site lists five Albatros L.47 (C.XV converted to a civil aircraft) but does not mention a customer. If these were in fact for Albania it is understandable that they would be delivered as civil aircraft, Germany at that time being forbidden to export military equipment. Two L.47s could very well still have been on strength as late as April 1939, putatively for an airmail service. There was no such manufacturing concern as \\"Albatros-Fokker\\". These were C.XV two-seat reconnaissance aircraft built by Albatros Flugzeugwerke for the German Army Air Service at the end of WW1 and undelivered when the fighting ended. In 1919, Anthony Fokker acquired over 200 surplus German military aircraft, including the C.XVs, and smuggled them across the frontier to a workshop he had opened in his native Netherlands in defiance of the Allied Control Commission. Here the C.XVs were de-militarised and given the spurious designation \\"Fokker L.47\\" and passed-off as a Dutch product in order to circumvent the ban on the sale of German military aircraft. The Albanian government were complicit in the subterfuge by putting out the fictitious story that the aircraft were to be used for an airmail service. The C.XVs formed the only flying assets of the Forcat Mbretërore të Aviacionit until the force was disbanded following the Italian invasion of Albania in April 1939. Weyl, A.R.

Later in the season, it becomes apparent that Butchie is a connection to Omar, as Proposition Joe arranges a face-to-face meeting between Omar and Stringer by talking to him. Season 3 Butchie's connection to Omar is more apparent, as several scenes show Omar getting advice from Butchie. Omar enlists Butchie to find Officer Dozerman's missing gun, and Omar returns it to Detective Bunk Moreland through Butchie. Butchie later provides Omar with Avon Barksdale's hideout location. Butchie had known the information all along but hoped to protect Omar by withholding it. In the end, Avon is arrested before Omar can use Butchie's tip. Season 4 Proposition Joe again contacts Butchie to set up a meeting with Omar, this time pitting Omar against Marlo Stanfield by convincing Omar to rob a card game that Stanfield will attend. When Stanfield contrives to have Omar framed for murder, Butchie is Omar's first phone call after Omar is arrested. Omar escapes the charge and steals an entire shipment of drugs from the New Day Co-Op, getting revenge on both Stanfield and Joe. Butchie suggests that Omar sell the shipment back to Joe, and Omar leaves Baltimore to retire on the profits. Season 5 Butchie is tortured and murdered in his bar by Stanfield enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop, to lure Omar from retirement. Butchie refuses to give information about Omar's whereabouts; Omar is notified of Butchie's death and returns to Baltimore for revenge.

Simon & Schuster) The Accidental Apprentice is a novel by Indian author Vikas Swarup. It is about a shop assistant, Sapna Sinha, who is invited to become CEO of a business empire if she can pass a series of seven tests. The story explores various forms of corruption in modern India. It has been dramatised for BBC Radio Four's 15 Minute Drama and is due to be adapted into a film by director Sriram Raghavan. Plot The premise of the plot is inspired by the reality television show The Apprentice. Sapna Sinha works in an electronics store in downtown Delhi. She hates her job, but she is ambitious and determined to succeed, because she knows that her family's fate is dependent on the money she brings in. One day, as she leaves the shop for her lunchbreak, she is approached by a man, Vinay Mohan Acharya, who claims to be the CEO of one of India's biggest companies. He tells her he is looking for someone to take on his business empire, and has decided it should be her. But in order to become the heir of his empire, Sapna must pass seven tests from the \\"Textbook of Life\\". The seven tests are seven unexpected and life threatening situations with each test revealing a different quality of a leader. Sapna passes six of the seven tests with great difficulty. Though Vinay praises her for her character, Sapna is outraged at Vinay's indifference to the threat which posed to life. Each situation explores a facet of corruption in India. So far, Sapna learns the qualities of leadership, integrity, courage, foresight, resourcefulness and decisiveness, with Acharya keeping tabs on her and explaining the relevance of each quality. As the story progresses, it is revealed that Acharya is facing bitter rivalry from his volatile and aggressive twin brother, AK Acharya. His company is engaging in insider trading and Acharya himself is not keeping well. Acharya hints that the seventh and final test would be the hardest of all. However, as Sapna proceeds against the final task, the seventh test horribly spirals out of control. Vinay is found murdered mysteriously and Sapna is framed for the murder. Sapna escapes from jail and she discovers, to her horror, that her past had come to haunt her. Sapna uses all her wits to escape from the escalating situation and finally all is well. In the end, AK takes over Vinay's company and feels remorseful for holding a grudge against his brother. He speaks to Sapna and gives her a letter written by Vinay long ago. The letter reveals the truth why Vinay had chosen Sapna as his successor and tells her the final lesson he intended to impart: Wisdom. AK explains Sapna his brother's intentions, clearing her doubts. AK promises help to Sapna and asks her to take over as the CEO of Vinay's company. Sapna turns it down, saying that she intends to follow her heart, and AK agrees with her.

Néondian was originally intended to be released as the fourth La Düsseldorf album (and titled Mon Amour), but the departure of Dinger's two bandmates in 1983 and the ensuing legal battle over the band's name forced Teldec to release the album under the obscure moniker \\"Klaus Dinger + Rheinita Bella Düsseldorf\\" (referencing La Düsseldorf's best selling single - \\"Rheinita\\"). Recording The basic tracks for the album were recorded in 1983 by Klaus and Thomas Dinger at the newly built Zeeland Studios near the Dutch town of Kamperland. For the first time, Dinger had access to digital synthesizers and other new technology, which he made use of on the record. This later led him to dismiss the album as \\"mechanical music\\". In late 1983 the single \\"Ich Liebe Dich\\" was released under the La Düsseldorf name, but soon after Thomas Dinger left the sessions (drummer Hans Lampe had left several months previously). Dinger removed his brother's vocal contributions and finalised the tracks alone. Feeling dissatisfied with the music produced, Dinger travelled to Cologne to enlist the help of Conny Plank, who had produced the first La Düsseldorf album. Plank and Dinger finished the album with studio musicians, including Jaki Liebezeit and members of Belfegore. By late 1984 sessions were completed, although their cost had driven Dinger into debt. Content The album's subject matter is largely darker than Dinger's previous three albums, mirroring changes in German culture. Like contemporary bands such as D.A.F., Dinger wrote of America's political and cultural hegemony over the western world, often comparing the policies of Ronald Reagan to those of the Nazis (\\"Heil Ronald!\\" is a lyric from the song Pipi AA). Dinger also criticises the commercialism and inhumanity of society (\\"Businessmen verkauft die Welt / Tod und Leben gegen Geld\\" -- Businessmen sell the earth / Death and life versus money). By far the most famous (and inflammatory) song to come from Néondian is America, an anti-US pop song, which Warner Bros. refused to print the lyrics of in the album's official CD re-release. Perhaps the most striking lyrics are -- \\"Don't say you fight for freedom / You stole all your land from Indians / In a holocaust / And you still do!\\" This reflects Dinger's outrage at the Reagan administration's treatment of Native American Indians, an issue which he was passionate about, and for which the album is named (Néon = Neon (urban), -dian = Indian). The album cover art features visual representations of many of these themes, Dinger having a white feather stuck to his head with a sticking plaster, and the lid of a Coca-Cola bottle stuck to the photo. Releases Due to his ongoing legal battle with Thomas Dinger and Hans Lampe over the rights to the La Düsseldorf material (which at that time was going well for Klaus), Teldec chose to avoid delaying the album any longer and release it under the project name \\"Klaus Dinger + Rheinita Bella Düsseldorf\\". This decision enraged Dinger, who rightly foresaw the album's commercial failure without the use of the La Düsseldorf name. Two singles were also released from the album - \\"Mon Amour\\" and \\"America\\". In 1987 Teldec was acquired by Warner Bros. Records, and the new label head Jürgen Otterstein stopped production of Néondian as well as the three La Düsseldorf albums. In the 1990s Dinger re-released the album on Captain Trip Records in Japan, including a remodelled cover and booklet. In 2006 when Warner Bros. finally agreed to release the three La Düsseldorf albums on CD, Néondian was re- released under its original name \\"Mon Amour\\" with several bonus tracks. This, too, was cancelled after six months in print due to copyright issues. Track listing All titles written by Klaus Dinger, except where stated otherwise.

( ) is an American software development company based in San Francisco. Niantic is best known for developing the augmented reality mobile games Ingress, Pokémon Go, and Harry Potter: Wizards Unite. The company was formed as Niantic Labs in 2010 as an internal startup within Google. The company became an independent entity in October 2015. It has offices in San Francisco, Bellevue, Los Angeles, Sunnyvale, Hong Kong, Tokyo and London.  History   Founding  John Hanke, founder and CEO of Niantic The company was formed in 2010 by John Hanke as Niantic Labs, an internal startup within Google. The company took its name from the whaling vessel Niantic, which came to San Francisco during the California Gold Rush in the 1800s. At the time Ingress was launched, Niantic had 35 employees.  As an independent, private company  The company spun out of Google in October 2015 soon after Google's announcement of its restructuring as Alphabet Inc. During the spinout, Niantic announced that Google, Nintendo, and The Pokémon Company would invest up to $30 million in Series-A funding, $20 million upfront and the remaining $10 million in financing conditioned upon the company achieving certain milestones, to support the growth of the company and its products. In February 2016, Niantic announced that it had secured an additional $5 million in Series A funding including investment from venture capital firms Alsop Louie Partners and You & Mr. Jones Brandtech Ventures, as well as angel investors Lucas Nealan, Cyan Banister, and Scott Banister. While adding more support for the growth of the company, this investment enabled Niantic to bring in strategic industry pioneers including the addition of Gilman Louie to its board. In November 2017, Niantic raised $200 million in Series B funding from multiple investors, led by Spark Capital. Spark's Megan Quinn joined Niantic's board of directors during this investment round. In January 2019, it was reported that Niantic had raised an additional $245 million in a Series C fundraising round. The round was led by Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), but also included investments from strategic partners such as AXiomatic Gaming and Samsung Ventures. Acquisitions and Investments In November 2017, it was announced that Niantic had acquired Evertoon, an app which allows users to make short, personalized films. According to the company’s announcement, the acquisition is meant to help build social systems. At the time of the acquisition, Evertoon was only 18 months old and had only 5 employees. In February 2018, Niantic announced that it had acquired augmented reality company Escher Reality, a team focused on building persistent, cross platform, multi-user experiences. Hanke stated that Niantic planned to allow third-party developers to build AR games similar to Pokémon Go. In June 2018, Niantic announced the acquisition of computer vision and machine learning company Matrix Mill. The Matrix Mill team has spent years focusing on perfecting augmented reality occlusion by building deep neural networks that can infer 3D information about the surrounding world. The acquisition significantly advances Niantic's efforts to deliver planet-scale AR and provide even more realistic AR experiences. In July 2018, Niantic announced the acquisition of LA-based gaming studio, Seismic Games. Composed of industry veterans from EA/Pandemic and Activision, and best known for co-developing Marvel Strike Force, the addition of Seismic Games to Niantic significantly accelerated their ability to deliver all new AR experiences that continue to bridge the physical and digital worlds. In November 2018, Niantic invested in DigiLens alongside Mitsubishi Chemical's Diamond Edge Ventures. The investment will help DigiLens develop holographic waveguide displays for augmented reality applications. In June 2019, Niantic announced the acquisition of London-based development studio, Sensible Object. Niantic welcomes Sensible Object to significantly advance their efforts in developing a wide range of gaming experiences as the core of Niantic London. In March 2020, Niantic acquired 3D world-scanning software company 6D.ai. Niantic Real World Platform In June 2018, Niantic shared a sneak peek behind the technology they had been developing for years: the Niantic Real World Platform. The core platform consists of a suite of tools including: AR Cloud, anti-cheat security, POI data, IAP, social, analytics, CRM, sponsorship, and more. Niantic mentioned that they intend to open up the platform in the future for use by third party developers. In December 2018, Niantic announced their Beyond Reality Developer Contest offering third party developers an opportunity to develop a new game experience on the Niantic Real World Platform for a chance to compete for a prize pool of more than $1 million.  Products   Field Trip  In 2012, Niantic's launched its first product, Field Trip, a location-based mobile app which acted as \\"your guide to the cool, hidden, and unique things in the world around you.\\"  Ingress and Ingress Prime  Niantic's first augmented reality game Ingress was initially made available on Android by invitation only in November 2012. It was then released publicly in October 2013. An iOS version was released in July 2014. Initially, Niantic had taken an alternative approach to monetization, veering away from more traditional mobile application development standards such as ad placements and in-app purchases. However, following the split with Google in 2015, in-app purchasing was implemented for 'Ingress'. Founder and CEO John Hanke has noted that Ingress is a sort of proof of concept, adding that a next step could involve packaging application programming interfaces (APIs) from the Ingress application in order to entice developers. Companies that partnered with Niantic were marketed through the narrative of Ingress rather than direct marketing techniques. Some of those companies include Jamba Juice, Hint Water, Vodafone, Motorola, AXA, SoftBank Group, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Lawson, Ito En, and Circle K. In November 2018, Niantic released a thoroughly revamped version of the game branded as Ingress Prime. Prime is completely rewritten and Niantic used critical learnings gained from Pokémon Go and Ingress for its development. Niantic also retained the older Ingress game as a separate download named Scanner [REDACTED]. The intention of the older Ingress game is to help aid the transition to Prime as feature parity is reached between both games in 2019. In collaboration with Craftar Studio, Ingress: The Animation, a television series based on the popular augmented reality game was produced. It began airing in Japan on Fuji TV's +Ultra programming block in October 2018. On April 30, 2019, the series premiered globally on Netflix.  Endgame: Proving Ground  Niantic's second announced (but currently unreleased) mobile game, Endgame, is a transmedia storytelling project consisting of an alternate reality game, Endgame: Ancient Truth, novels by James Frey starting with Endgame: The Calling, and the mobile app, Endgame: Proving Ground.Rosenblatt, Seth Google's Niantic follows Ingress with Endgame Cnet. Retrieved September 9, 2014  Pokémon Go  In September 2015, it was announced that Niantic had been developing Pokémon Go in partnership with Nintendo and The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices. The game was initially released in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States in July 2016 (and released to much of the rest of the world throughout the remainder of 2016), where it became an overnight global phenomenon, significantly increasing the use and visibility of augmented reality technology. In addition to topping app store charts in most regions, Apple Inc. announced that Pokémon Go had become the most downloaded app in a first week ever, which was topped by Super Mario Run later that year. Reports indicated that users were spending more time on Pokémon Go than on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Tinder, and Instagram. In one month, Pokémon Go was downloaded more than 100 million times, with daily revenues exceeding $10 million. Exactly two months after its launch, at Apple's September keynote, John Hanke announced that Pokémon Go exceeded 500 million downloads worldwide and that players around the world had walked over 4.6 billion kilometers. By December, it was announced that the kilometer distance achieved in September had nearly doubled to over 8.7 billion kilometers, meaning that players had collectively walked further than the distance to Pluto. By the end of February 2017, Pokémon Go had surpassed over 650 million downloads. During Pokémon Gos Adventure Week in-game promo in May 2017, Niantic announced that players had collectively walked over 15.8 billion kilometers, roughly the distance from Earth past the edge of the solar system. On June 8, 2017, it was revealed that Pokémon Go had been downloaded over 750 million times globally. In 2019, it was revealed that Pokémon Go had been downloaded over 1 billion times. Like Ingress, Pokémon Go has a similar approach to monetization. The game has two main revenue streams, in-app purchases and regional partnerships. To date, Pokémon Go has established several partnerships around the globe among which include Sprint and Starbucks in the United States, Reliance Jio in India, and Unibail-Rodamco in Europe. Harry Potter: Wizards Unite In November 2017, it was announced that Niantic had been developing Harry Potter: Wizards Unite in partnership with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and WB Games San Francisco, under the Portkey Games banner. The mobile AR game, inspired by J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World and Harry Potter, is said to allow players to \\"explore real-world neighbourhoods and cities to discover mysterious artifacts, learn to cast spells, and encounter legendary beasts and iconic characters along the way\\". The game was released in New Zealand as an open beta on April 16, 2019. Beta testing in Australia began on May 1, 2019. The game officially started its worldwide rollout on June 21, 2019, with a release in the United States and United Kingdom, and released to much of the rest of the world on June 22, 2019.  CATAN World Explorers  After a few months of silence regarding the possible deal, Niantic confirmed to The Verge that they had been involved with the game’s creation. In November 2019, CATAN GmbH announced at the 2019 Spiel that it was working on a “upcoming massively multiplayer location based game” titled CATAN World Explorers. The game is to be based on the Catan board games; players will move through the real world, using their smartphones to build a Catan universe. Lawsuit On June 15, 2019, Niantic sued Global++, an unauthorized third-party software created by an \\"association of hackers\\" which allowed players to spoof their GPS location for the purpose of cheating in Niantic's augmented reality games, including Ingress and Pokémon Go. Niantic claimed that the hacked versions of the applications were infringing on their intellectual property rights. The developer of Global++ earned money by selling subscriptions and asking for donations via the hacked apps. This resulted in Niantic forcing the developers to terminate their illegitimate distributions of the hacked apps and reverse engineering the games' codes. Eventually Global++ had to shut down their services, PokeGo++ and Ingress++, and their social media services. Niantic has also claimed that Global++ was also in the process of creating Potter++—shortly before the release of the actual content—which Niantic stated would harm the success of the game.

He was critical in the development of Beverly Hills, California, and he is credited with naming it Beverly Hills after Beverly Farms in Massachusetts. Early life Burton Edmond Green was born on September 6, 1868 near Madison, Wisconsin.Marc Wanamaker, Early Beverly Hills, Mount Pleasant, South Carolina: Arcadia Publishing, 2005, pp. 17-18 Notables of the West, Press Reference Library: Western Edition, 1913, volume I, p. 112 His father was Richard Green and his mother, Amanda Hill (Bush) Green. He attended the Beaver Dam Academy in Wisconsin. He moved to California with his family in 1886, at the age of sixteen. He graduated from the Los Angeles High School in 1889. Career Green worked as an orange grower in Redlands, California for five years. He then decided to return to Los Angeles and invest in the oil industry. Together with Max Whittier (1867–1928), he established the Green & Whittier Oil Company and drilled oil in the Los Angeles area. Shortly after, they started drilling near Bakersfield, California. In 1905, the Green & Whittier Oil Company merged with two other oil companies to become the Associated Oil Company of California. As a result, he served on the Board of Directors of the Associated Oil Company, later serving as its President. He served as the President of the Bellridge Oil Company, which encompassed 32,000 acres of the Lost Hills Oil Field in Kern County, California. In 1900, together with Max Whittier, Charles A.
