After receiving a doctorate in 1914, she worked at a hospital in Berlin, before leaving to become a doctor in a small town. After the outbreak of World War I, Frankenthal attempted to enlist in the German Army as a doctor, but was rejected due to her gender. She subsequently joined the Austro-Hungarian Army, where she served in the Carpathian Mountains and on the Balkan front. After the war she worked at the Charit√© hospital, but was dismissed to make room for male veterans. In addition to her work in medicine, Frankenthal was active in politics as a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. From 1925 to 1931 she served on the Berlin City Council, and in 1930 was elected to the Prussian Landtag. In 1931 she joined the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, and briefly held a leadership role in the party. Following the ascension of Adolf Hitler, Frankenthal fled Germany, eventually settling in New York City in the United States. While in New York she penned an essay about her experiences as a Jew and a political activist in Germany, and worked with a New York-based, Germany-focused advocacy organization, the Council for a Democratic Germany. Although she traveled to Germany after the war, and was honored by the city of Berlin in 1974, she remained a resident of New York for the remainder of her life. Personal life Frankenthal was born in Kiel, Germany, to Julius and C√§cilie ( Goldmann) Frankenthal on 30 January 1889. She was the second of three daughters. Julius was a successful businessman and leader in Kiel's Jewish community and C√§cilie was a housewife. Though she was raised in a middle class household, Frankenthal rejected the lifestyle and values of her parents. Frankenthal attended a Kiel girls' school and then a Jewish boarding school in Wiesbaden where she had both Jewish and gentile friends. She later complained that the girls' schools of the time provided a \\"rather primitive general education.\\" Though the boarding school emphasized learning social graces to attract a husband, Frankenthal instead prepared herself to attend university and then medical school. She wished to be self-sufficient and independent. Though her parents opposed it, she hired private tutors to help her prepare for the entrance exams and attended \\"cram courses\\" that were offered to women in Berlin. After the death of her parents, Frankenthal formally left the Jewish community in 1923, declaring herself to be konfessionslos, or without religion. She considered herself to be Jewish \\"by fate, but not by religion or nationality.\\" At at early age she decided never to marry. She rejected the possibility of marrying a gentile, and said she was \\"turned off by anything Jewish in appearance or manner,\\" including Jewish men. She was a large, physically imposing woman with short hair and a masculine bearing who often wore men's clothes. A very private, independent person, she had no close friends as an adult, though in her college days she did have close friendships with a number of non-Jewish men She also had sexual partners during this time, which was rare for female students of the era. Education At the age of 20, Frankenthal passed her Abitur examination and enrolled at the University of Kiel. She also studied in Heidelberg, Erlangen, Munich, and Vienna. In all, she attended six universities over 10 semesters. Finally, in 1914, she earned her doctorate in Freiberg. Until she arrived in Heidelberg in 1910, she did not live the same carefree lifestyle as many of her classmates. Previously, she had lived at home with her parents. When she first arrived in the city, her father rented her a two bedroom apartment. Frankenthal objected, saying students typically only had a single room apartment and that she did not to wish to waste her father's money. Julius insisted, however, rejecting the notion that she might entertain male students in her bedroom. This was the last time that Julius attempted to influence his daughter's moral behavior. She enjoyed the freedom the city provided to young students like herself, and thought the college town was the ideal place to grow into an adult. When she first matriculated, female students were uncommon in Kiel. They made up between 10-15% of the student body by the time she completed her studies, however. She reported that fellow students were more accepting of her as a woman than the professors were. In the years she was studying, 1909 to 1914, the acceptance of women on campus improved dramatically. An enthusiastic sportswoman and equestrian, Frankenthal studied fencing, boxing, and ju-jitsu in order to prove that she was physically capable to defend herself against a man. Medical career After medical school, Frankenthal became a resident at a large hospital in Berlin. After a rural doctor was drafted into the army, Frankenthal took his position as it offered her a chance to make more money. The small town where she resided was surprised to see not only a female doctor, but especially a woman who smoked cigars and drank whiskey. With no other doctors available, she saw both men and women as patients. Frankenthal volunteered to serve in the German Army during World War I, but the army did not accept female doctors. She then applied to the Austrian Army and was accepted, though she was the only woman in the barracks. She served in the Carpathian Mountains and later on the Balkan front. As the war came to an end, Frankenthal returned to Berlin. She took an unpaid research assistant position at the Institute for Cancer Research. She also worked as a resident, directing a women's ward of a hospital. She also treated tuberculosis patients. As an active member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, she had charge of a first aid station operating under the auspices of the Red Cross during the November Revolution. In 1924, Frankenthal and other women were dismissed from their positions as doctors at the Charit√© so that male war veterans could take their place. She then established a private practice while continuing to conduct research at the Pathological Institute and to practice medicine at the University Women's Clinic. Frankenthal became the municipal physician in Neuk√∂lln in 1928. Political career Frankenthal was first introduced to socialism while a student in Heidelberg. She became politically active on women's issues, campaigning for sex reform legislation, legalizing abortion, and the creation of marital counselling bureaus that offered birth control and sex education. She was active in both the Federation of Women Physicians and the Association of Socialist Physicians in Germany, roles that gave her a platform from which she could put pressure on male and non-Jewish doctors to amend the German constitution to legalize abortion. Frankenthal also supported legalizing homosexuality. From 1925 to 1931, Frankenthal served on the Berlin City Council as a Social Democratic municipal deputy representing Tiergarten. In 1930, she was elected to the Prussian Landtag. The following year, in 1931, she left the Social Democratic party to become a member of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, a party even further to the left. She served, for a short period of time, on the party's executive board. Life in the United States After Adolf Hitler came to power, Frankenthal, a Jewish socialist, quickly left Germany. Had she stayed, she likely would have arrested for her political activities. Frankenthal first fled to Prague before moving to Switzerland and then Paris. In 1936, she moved to New York City. Before requalifying as a doctor in New York, Frankenthal struggled to adjust to her new life and to support herself. She took jobs selling ice cream bars on the streets and going door-to-door selling stockings. Eventually, she gained her credentials to practice in the United States and trained as a psychoanalyst. In addition to working with the Jewish Family Service, Frankenthal specialized in marriage and family therapy in her private psychoanalytic practice. Her prize-winning memoir, Der dreifache Fluch: J√ºdin, Intellektuelle, Sozialistin (The triple curse: Jewish, intellectual, socialist), was written in 1940 as part of an essay contest sponsored by Harvard University about life in Germany before and after 1933. The contest was held to create an academic collection of materials to study the effects, both social and psychological, of national socialism on both German society and the German people. In it she discusses her Judaism, political activity during the Weimar Republic, her first years living in the Unites States. It was published in 1981. She never fully assimilated into American life and often traveled back to Germany after the end of World War II, but lived in New York for the rest of her life. The German government awarded her reparations and a pension after the war, and she was honored by the City of Berlin on her 85th birthday. In 1944 and 1945, she worked for the Council for a Democratic Germany and was responsible for the portion of their memorandum that focused on health policy along with Felix Boenheim and Kurt Glaser. Frankenthal died of arteriosclerosis in New York on 21 April 1976.

Geography Topo Islet is approximately in area. It is about off the southeasternmost tip of S√£o Jorge, adjacent the civil parish of Topo in the Calheta municipality. Waters around the islet range from deep. The area is suitable for more experienced divers due to strong currents. Though the islet is just off the coast, most diving expeditions leave from the port of Velas, about 75 minutes away by boat. The islet has no permanent human population or structures. However, prior to Topo Islet's local protection as a nature reserve, people visited the islet and its waters to camp and spearfish. Biome The islet serves as a marine bird sanctuary. Marine birds inhabiting or visiting the islet include black-headed gull, common tern, Cory's shearwater, Eurasian whimbrel, great black-backed gull, little egret, little shearwater, roseate tern, ruddy turnstone, and sanderling. In recognition of the islet's role as a marine bird habitat, in 1984 the regional Legislative Assembly of the Azores decreed the islet a \\"partial\\" nature reserve. Since March 1990 the islet and adjacent coastline on the main island of S√£o Jorge have been protected through the European Environment Agency's Natura 2000 initiative under the Birds Directive. In 2011 the original Topo Islet reserve and adjacent coastline was named √Årea Protegida para a Gest√£o de Habitats ou Esp√©cies do Ilh√©u do Topo (Topo Islet Protected Area for Habitat and Species Restoration) and integrated into the newly established Nature Park of S√£o Jorge, one of the locally protected areas of the Azores. The entire terrestrial area of the islet is protected. As sheep and cattle pasture on the islet‚Äîdamaging the natural habitat‚Äîits plant diversity is low. However, researchers have found exemplars of the endemic Azorean bracel-da-rocha fescue grass (Festuca petraea) on Topo Islet. The waters around Topo Islet are biodiverse. Fish observed in the area include Atlantic bonito, Azores chromis, barred hogfish, bluefish, Canary damsel, dusky grouper, longfin yellowtail, Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, moray eels of various species, ornate wrasse, white trevally, and yellowmouth barracuda.

History Nasc was founded in 2000 in Cork by Sisters of Mercy, the Society of African Missions and a group of activists, in response to the creation of the Direct Provision system. They aimed to provide information and advice to migrants in Ireland. Initially based in Bishop's Street, the organisation moved to Enterprise House on Mary Street, Cork in 2005. From 2007, the group has given legal advice with funding from Atlantic Philanthropies and the One Foundation. They are now located in 34 Paul Street. Activities In 2015 Nasc produced a map of incidents of racism and hate crimes in Ireland. They have provided legal support to the Roma community in Ireland. Nasc have been involved in integration programmes for migrants, such as those from Syria in County Cork. In collaboration with other groups, they have held a legal information evening to deal with the uncertainties around Brexit, while highlighting the continuing issues around the lack of information around Brexit for migrants. They called on the Irish government to take in more refugees in response to the European migrant crisis. In 2016, they launched the Safe Passage campaign to reunite refugees with family members in Ireland. They have criticised the Irish government for housing migrants and asylum seekers in hotels and B&Bs; as emergency accommodation long term due to the lack of space in existing Direct Provision centres and the problems with establishing new ones. Nasc have called the arson attacks on hotels earmarked for emergency accommodation hate crimes. They have also criticised the Irish government's use of prisons for migrant detentions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Nasc alongside Doras, the Sanctuary Runners, Irish Refugee Council, Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland, and the Immigrant Council of Ireland, called for all vulnerable and at-risk migrants be removed from Direct Provision centres. Nasc has also spoken out about the poor facilities and living conditions within Direct Provision centres. In particular, drawing attention to the inability of those living in the centres to adhere to social distancing and self isolation during the pandemic, and that these residents should be prioritised for testing. They have also highlighted that those working in low paid jobs face similar issues. Nasc worked with Together Ireland to produce videos in over 30 languages providing information about the pandemic.

Securities and Exchange Commission, 591 U.S. ___ (2020), was a US Supreme Court case related to disgorgement awards sought by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) for fraudulent activities. The Court ruled in an 8‚Äì1 decision that such disgorgement awards can be awarded by the courts as equitable relief under the Securities Act of 1933, , but they are limited to the wrongdoer's net profits.Liu v. Sec. & Exch. Comm'n, .  Background  Around 2014, Charles C. Liu and Xin Wang, a married couple and US citizens in California, sought out investments from several Chinese companies that claimed that they were going to use the money to build a cancer treatment center through which they would latee establish a means for investors to obtain an EB-5 visa. The EB-5 program allowed for such visas to be obtained if more than $500,000 was invested in certain types of development projects. By 2016, they had obtained investments from at least 50 different Chinese citizens, totaling more than $27 million. However, as determined by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), the couple did not use the funds towards the project. While they had secured the land, there had been no development work on it during the 18 months after they had gotten the investments, and the SEC found that $11.8 million of the funds had been transferred back to Chinese companies owned by Liu and that another large portion had been used for personal expenses by the couple. The SEC had began its investigation in February 2016 and filed official charges against the couple in June 2016 under the Securities Act of 1933, which that prohibits fraud, specifically misstatements as to use of investment funds under . The SEC filed its case in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The District Court ruled against the couple in April 2017. In addition to permanently enjoining the couple from ever engaging in the EB-5 program, the court issued a disgorgement award, requiring the couple to pay back the full amount that it had obtained from the investors ans a civil penalty of $8.2 million. Liu and Wang appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and asserted they had not defrauded the investors since they were not seeking profits or securities but visas. Among their arguments, the appeal addressed the recent Supreme Court's decision in Kokesh v. SEC (581 U.S. ___ (2017)). Kokesh had determined that disgorgement awards were to be treated as penalties (in that case, they were subject to a statute of limitations) but left open the question \\"on whether courts possess authority to order disgorgement in SEC enforcement proceedings or on whether courts have properly applied disgorgement principles in this context.\\" The Ninth Circuit upheld the District Court's ruling in October 2018 and asserted that Kokesh had not yet prevented the courts from issuing disgorgement award and that in this case, the disgorgement award should not discount the legitimate business expenses, such as rent, which the couple had paid for during the 18 months. Supreme Court Liu and Wang petitioned to the Supreme Court on the question on whether the SEC can seek a disgorgement award as a form of equitable relief despite the Kokesh ruling that disgorgement award was determined to be a penalty. The Supreme Court accepted the petition in November 2019, which legal analysts believed was to resolve the open-ended question left by Kokesh. Oral arguments were heard on March 3, 2020 in which Liu and Wang's legal council continue to argued that Congress never gave the SEC authority to impose disgorgement as penalties, and observers saw the justices forced more on questions to reigning in the size of such disgorgement awards. The Court issued its decision on June 22, 2020. In an 8‚Äì1 decision, the Court ruled that courts can award for disgorgement in security fraud cases and affirmed the implied stance from Kokesh but limited them to the net profits of the conduct from the fraudulent activity. Also, the decision required those funds to be paid back to the defrauded investors. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the majority, which was joined by all but Justice Clarence Thomas. Sotomayor affirmed in her decision that \\"Congress prohibited the SEC from seeking an equitable remedy in excess of a defendant‚Äôs net profits from wrongdoing,\\" under . She further wrote \\"To avoid transforming an equitable remedy into a punitive sanction, courts restricted the remedy to an individual wrongdoer's net profits to be awarded for victims.\\" Justice Thomas, in his dissent, stated that under , disgorgement is not \\"equitable relief\\" and so he disagreed with the conclusion of the majority. Thomas also wrote of concerns on the disgorgement being returned to investors: \\"The money ordered to be paid as disgorgement in no sense belongs to the government, and the majority cites no authority allowing a government agency to keep equitable relief for a wrong done to a third party.\\" The judgement vacated the Ninth Circuit's judgement and remanded the case to that court to re-evaluate the amount of the award based on this decision, including the deduction of legitimate business expenses.

Early life Pennington was born on October 9, 1854 in Baltimore, Maryland and was named after his great-grandfather, the former U.S. Senator Robert Goodloe Harper. He was a son of William Clapham Pennington (1829‚Äì1913) and Emily Louisa (n√©e Harper) Pennington (1835‚Äì1908). His brother was Dr. Clapham Pennington. His paternal grandparents were Baltimore lawyer Josias Pennington (a close friend of John Pendleton Kennedy) and Sophia Cook (n√©e Clapham) Pennington. His cousin, Josias Pennington, was a prominent architect with Baldwin & Pennington. His maternal grandparents were Charlotte Hutchinson (n√©e Cheffelle) Harper and Charles Carroll Harper, the eldest son and heir of Robert Goodloe Harper and Catherine (n√©e Carroll) Harper (a daughter of Charles Carroll of Carrollton). Catherine's sister Mary was the wife of Richard Caton (namesake of Catonsville, Maryland). Career Pennington's Portrait of Robert Gould Shaw II as \\"Little Billee\\" from the novel Trilby, a painting said to be owned by Harry Lehr and hung in his bedroom. Pennington's Beach Scene, between 1875‚Äì1900. Pennington studied art under Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. In 1880, while in Munich, he was advised to join a group of American painters led by Frank Duveneck in Florence, known as the \\"Duveneck boys\\", which included John White Alexander, Otto Henry Bacher, Robert Frederick Blum, Charles Abel Corwin, George Edward Hopkins, Julius Rolshoven and Theodore Wendel. While in Venice, he met James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who he was a great admirer of and two became close friends. Whistler drew Pennington's portrait in chalk and pastel. Pennington small portraits, in oil and pastel, show Whistler's influence and are sometimes mistaken for his work. Whistler invited Pennington to return with him to London in 1880, but Pennington decided to travel and paint around Italy. While in Venice, he made a portrait of Robert Browning for Katherine de Kay Bronson, a prominent American expatriate. After returning to London, Pennington took one of four studios at Carlyle Studios, alongside Theodore Roussel and George Percy Jacomb-Hood. In 1884, he made a full-length portrait of Oscar Wilde as a wedding gift for Wilde and his wife, Constance, which hung in Wilde's London home. He also created fifteen engravings from drawings for Wilde's 1889 essay, London Models. Pennington was a frequent visitor to Tite Street to see Whistler (whom he drew in 1885 while Whistler gave his Ten O'clock Lecture). In 1886 or 1887, Whistler drew Pennington's portrait for a second time. While in London, Pennington was a member of the Beefsteak Club, a private dining club in Leicester Square, and was \\"exceedingly popular in both London and Paris\\". Pennington made several paintings for King Edward VII (then the Prince of Wales), \\"who was so well pleased with the artist's skill that he presented him with his photograph bearing his autograph.\\" In 1885, he made portraits of Patsy Cornwallis-West and the Misses Edith Clarke and Nellie Farren Calhoun while in London. In 1899, Pennington wrote a letter to The New York Times, which was published in response to Layton Crippen's criticism of Henry Kirke Brown's sculpture of Washington in Union Square, where Pennington wrote: > \\"Art is unlike trade. A masterpiece cannot be short measure; it is too > personal. In conclusion, I would like to remind Mr. Crippen that some (very > many, too,) of the greatest living sculptors are Americans. Indeed, no > foreigners can give us points on art matters any longer.

Personal life On October 31, 1888, Pennington was married to Caroline DeWolf Theobald (1869‚Äì1962), a daughter of Dr. Samuel Theobald, a leading physician of Baltimore (and grandson of surgeon Nathan Ryno Smith). Before their divorce in 1913, they were the parents of four daughters and one son: * Charlotte Emily Pennington (b. 1889) * Marjory Innocence Pennington (1891‚Äì1992), who married Edward Norris Kimball, Sr. (grandparents of Christopher Kimball) * Caroline DeWolf Pennington (b. 1895) * Dorothea Harper Pennington (b. 1896), who married Robert W.

The lake is located in North Carolina. Eleven archaeological investigations have been conducted at the lake over a course of 25 years. Altogether the investigations \\"recovered over 5,000 artifacts and located and documented 23 canoes.\\" Archaeologists were able to analyze and categorize the recovered artifacts into 10 different artifact types. In addition, the archaeologists were able to provide radiocarbon dates to most of the canoes. The result of all of this provided evidence of prehistoric occupation of Lake Phelps that dated from the Late PaleoIndian/Early Archaic period through the Late Woodland period.  Description  Lake Phelps is the second largest natural lake in North Carolina. According to the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation, the lake has a surface area of 16,600 acres.http://www.ncparks.gov/About/docs/protection_acreage.pdf It also sits at \\"one of the highest lake elevations in the area.\\" Lake Phelps is not very deep; for instance, the average depth for the lake is 4.5 feet, while the maximum depth of the lake is 9 feet. The lake is remarkably clean. The reason it is so clean is that the water in the lake only comes from rainfall. With that in mind, a drought can cause decreased water levels at the lake, which can lead to exposed shorelines and interesting discoveries.  History of investigations = The Initial Canoe Investigations (1985-1986)  Members of the North Carolina Office of State Archaeology (OSA), the Underwater Archaeology Unit (UAU), and the Pettigrew State Park discovered four dugout canoes and prehistoric ceramics at the lake. After analyses, the UAU indicated that the ceramics fell into the category of two ceramic types: Mount Pleasant and Colington. The artifacts also dated back to a time period between 300 BC and AD 1650.Pierce, Greg & Boudreaux, Edmond A., III, 1971- & East Carolina University. Department of Anthropology (2010). A synthesis of the prehistoric archaeological investigations of Lake Phelps, Washington County, North Carolina. East Carolina University, [Greenville, N.C.] In addition, the archaeologists radiocarbon dated some of the canoes and found out they were from 770 BC and 900 BC.  The Claggett Survey (1986)  A member from the OSA named Steve Claggett conducted a two-day field survey that resulted in the discovery of another canoe and 340 ceramic artifacts that originated from Early and Late Woodland periods. The survey consisted of a \\"50-x-50 m grid system running 400 m along the shore and 200 m south into the lake.\\"  The UAU/Morris Survey (1986)  Kaea Morris from East Carolina University (ECU) conducted a survey and excavation with the help of UAU members to try and find additional canoes. The survey area was 190 meters. Morris divided the survey area into \\"500-x-500-ft sections to be walked in 5-ft to 10-ft transects parallel to the shore.\\" Throughout the course of the next year, Morris went on to collaborate with David Phelps. Together, they discovered 19 new canoes, which dated back to 2430 BC to AD 1400. Some artifacts were also recovered.  The Phelps Survey (1987)  David Phelps established a shoreline survey on the eastern part of Lake Phelps and a reconnaissance survey on the western shore. The survey area was \\"almost 5,000 meters\\" and consisted of \\"47 transects measuring 100 m wide by 50 m long.\\" Phelps and helpers collected 1,777 artifacts from the eastern half of Lake Phelps. 1,127 of the collected artifacts were from the Late Paleoindian to the Late Woodland periods. On another note, 366 artifacts were returned to Lake Phelps' western shore. 349 of these artifacts dated from the Early Woodland through the Late Woodland periods.  The National Geographic Society Survey (1992)  The National Geographic Society (NGS) helped finance a project that involved the use of the ground penetrating radar (GPR) to try and find new and previously recorded canoes. The results were mixed. The GPR was able to clearly locate previously recorded canoes; however, the GPR also gave false readings for new canoes, which was caused by the complex arrangement of lake bed sediments.  The Lawrence and Mathis Survey (2002)  Richard Lawrence from the UAU and Mark Mathis from the OSA went to Lake Phelps to examine the prehistoric ceramic artifacts reported on the eastern shore. They found six ceramic clusters. Lawrence and Mathis had the artifacts curated at an OSA facility. The results were that no diagnostic artifacts were from this collection. Lawrence and Mathis also tried to re-locate previously recorded canoes; however, the canoes could not be found. They believed that the canoes were buried beneath sediment.  The Curci Survey (2004)  Jessica Curci from ECU collaborated with the UAU to move existing canoes to another location. Notably, Curci and the UAU wanted to perform a morphological analysis on the existing canoes. The UAU also wanted to check if burial was an adequate form of preservation. Many existing canoes were not found. However, the canoes that were found displayed good physical condition.  The UAU Revisit of 31WH12 (2008)  UAU members visited the lake to learn about how low water levels impact the canoes. The members examined five canoes. Two of the canoes were potentially deteriorated due to exposure to the air. The other canoes were in good condition. On a different note, the UAU members decided to conduct a re-examination of a portion of the survey area in the Claggett survey. \\"Twenty-one ceramic sherds, two lithic artifacts, and a portion of a steatite bowl were recovered.\\" Archaeologists claimed that the artifacts are from the Early Woodland and Middle Woodland periods.  Site 31WH12 Re-Inspection (2008)  Low water levels continued. As a result, prehistoric artifacts started emerging on the lake bed. Members from multiple organizations associated with the park and previous investigations visited the lake to investigate these artifacts. 593 artifacts were found. 254 of those artifacts were temporally diagnostic.  The Pierce Survey (2009)  Greg Pierce conducted a research project dedicated to the synthesis of data regarding the prehistoric use of Lake Phelps. The project revealed that a section of the eastern shore has not been surveyed. Consequently, a shoreline survey was conducted. 247 artifacts were recovered. 219 of those artifacts were temporally diagnostic, and the artifacts date back to the Early Woodland, Middle Woodland, and Late Woodland.  Research on prehistoric use of Lake Phelps = Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic Period (8500 to 6000 B.C.)  Only three artifacts were associated with this prehistoric period. One Hardaway point and two Kirk points. The limited amount of artifacts from this period may indicate a lack of human settlement.  The Late Archaic Period (3000 to 1000 B.C.)  Only two artifacts and three canoes were associated with this prehistoric period. The two artifacts found were Savannah River points. There is not enough evidence to make an accurate inference on prehistoric use of the lake at this time.  Early Woodland Period (1000 to 300 B.C.)  1,754 artifacts and 2 canoes were related to the Early Woodland period. Artifact types include Croaker Landing ceramics, Deep Creek ceramics, and Marcy Creek ceramics. These artifacts were recovered from multiple parts of the lake; thus, an implication of increased use of the lake during the Early Woodland period. The data points to possibly \\"sedentary residence.\\" Archaeologists also believed that the lake area experienced population growth during this time period. With that in mind, extraction of local resources started to increase.  Middle Woodland Period (300 B.C. to A.D. 800)  Archaeologists have categorized 1,085 artifacts and 11 dugout canoes to the Middle Woodland period. The artifacts recovered either belong to Mockley ceramics or Mount Pleasant ceramics. The findings infer two different meanings regarding lake use. Decrease in artifact findings suggest decreased lake use; however, the significant increase in canoe findings suggest increased lake use. There are several possible explanations for the contradictory data. The possibilities include artifact type misidentification, survey sampling issue, or changing settlement practices.  Late Woodland Period (A.D. 800 to 1650)  225 artifacts and three canoes belong to the Late Woodland Period. The artifacts are categorized into two types of artifacts: Cashie ceramics and Colington ceramics. It is important to mention that most of the artifacts were identified as Colington ceramics. The lack of diversity in the types of artifacts may explain the decrease in artifacts and canoes. On that note, Phelps infers that \\"the ceramic distributions mark the social boundaries of distinct groups.\\" The Colington series belong to the Algonquin speakers. Phelps assumes that the Algonquin speakers were the primary occupants at Lake Phelps because the majority of the recovered artifacts belong to them. The Cashie series belonged to the Tuscarora. There was not a lot of Cashie ceramics, which may have indicated the limited presence of the Tuscarora or \\"the existence of trade relations\\". Another reason for low artifact count may have been the shift in subsistence strategies. Groups may have left Lake Phelps in search for land that was more suitable for agriculture.  Significance  The Lake Phelps site is important for a couple of reasons. One reason is that the archaeological site can help us learn more about indigenous peoples. In analyzing recovered artifacts, archaeologists are able to make better predictions about how indigenous peoples lived and so forth. Another reason is that Lake Phelps contains evidence of prehistoric use. With that in mind, the site can help us study the past before historical records began.

It's part of the Cascade Range, and is situated in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie and Skykomish Rivers. The nearest higher neighbor is Big Snow Mountain, to the southwest. This peak was once called \\"Big Snowy\\". Climate Gold Lake and Wild Goat Peak Wild Goat Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Camp Robber Peak and Wild Goat Peak (right) The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

He became professor of music at the Normal College for Army Schoolmasters; was from 1845 to 1853 resident music-master at St. John's Training College, Battersea, and was the first organist of Christ Church, Battersea, opened in 1849. In 1860 he established the National Choral Society, by which he maintained for some years at Exeter Hall an admirable series of oratorio performances. In connection with these performances he edited and published cheap editions of the oratorios and other works that were then not readily accessible to the public. In 1864 he organised a choir of a thousand voices for the Macbeth music at the 300th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth. He had a special aptitude for training school children, and conducted the National Schools Choral Festival at the Crystal Palace in 1859. As a composer his genius lay in the direction of the madrigal and part-song; and from the publication of his prize glee, 'Is she not beautiful?' in 1845 onwards few years passed in which he did not win distinction from some of the leading glee and madrigal societies of the country, for which he won numerous prizes. The tune 'Leominster,' associated with Horatius Bonar's hymn 'A few more years shall roll,' is one of his best- known compositions. Martin, owing to intemperance, sank from 'a position which at one time gave him a claim to be regarded as one of the elements of musical force in the metropolis' (as quoted in Musical Record).

The commission, which was publicly announced by Republican Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, consisted of three Congressionally appointed members supported by an executive director and staff. On March 26, 2014, the commission's members testified regarding their initial progress before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies. Following 14 months of research, interviews, briefings and field visits the commission issued an unclassified public version of its final report titled The FBI: Protecting the Homeland in the 21st Century on March 25, 2015.

Born in The Bronx, New York City and raised in Ponce, Puerto Rico, he graduated from medical school in 2015 before pursuing a musical career. He is known for his socially-conscious lyrics and his collaboration with Bad Bunny and √ëejo on the single \\"Cual Es Tu Plan?\\" reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart in August 2018. The song also reached number 17 on the Billboard Latin Digital Song Sales chart. Life and career PJ Sin Suela was born in The Bronx borough of New York City on August 5, 1989, and raised in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He developed an interest in music from his mother, who played the guitar. He gained a reputation in high school for rapping for his classmates at lunch but viewed a music career as a \\"silly dream\\". He graduated from medical school at Universidad Central del Caribe in 2015, after which he decided to pursue music as a career. The rapper has stated that he was unusual in the hip-hop scene because, \\"I'm white, I have an afro, I don't have tattoos, I studied medicine, and I didn't come from the street\\". He initially began performing with the plan of only doing so for a year, but noticed that the money he generated from his performances allowed him to pay his rent. He has since stated that after the success of his career, he \\"doesn't see himself in a hospital\\" but plans to give educational classes and lectures about medicine. However, he has since returned to the medical field due to the COVID-19 pandemic, working in the Hospital San Crist√≥bal in Ponce. As his career was gaining traction, PJ Sin Suela took note of the crisis in his home country and provided medical assistance to Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria in 2017. In August 2018, his collaboration with Bad Bunny and √ëejo on the single \\"Cual Es Tu Plan?\\" reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart and number 17 on the Billboard Latin Digital Song Sales chart. In September 2018, he served as the opening act for Puerto Rican rapper Residente. That same month, he featured along with many other Puerto Rican artists on Lin-Manuel Miranda's song \\"A Forgotten Spot\\". Billboard named him as one of \\"10 Latin Artists to Watch in 2019\\". In July 2019, he participated in protests in Puerto Rico demanding the resignation of governor Ricardo Rossell√≥. In August 2019, he released the remix of his single \\"La Pel√∫a\\" with Guaynaa, Jon Z and Rafa Pab√≥n. In December 2019, he released the first single from his upcoming album, a collaborative single titled \\"Por Ti\\" with Beto Montenegro, the lead singer of the Venezuelan band Rawayana. In March 2020, he collaborated with Uruguayan musician Jorge Drexler on the song \\"Loco Loquito\\". Artistry PJ Sin Suela cites Vico C, OutKast, Joaqu√≠n Sabina, Blink-182, Calle 13, and Eminem as influences. His music often discusses social and political themes, and one of his goals as an artist is to \\"make a positive social change in the world\\". His song \\"Mueve la Chola\\" denounces violence and was inspired by the rapper's experience of helping a shooting victim into an ambulance. The song's accompanying music video features 60 women lip syncing the lyrics to the song.

Upon seeing this, Captain Clark, right halfback of the Shortridge team, refused to play any longer and left the field. According to The Indianapolis Journal, the rest of Shortridge's team acted as gentlemen, and agreed to continue playing.

This area is about 300 miles north of the Gulf of Mexico. This area is about 186 acres. It is in Coahoma County in Mississippi and by the Yazoo River basin. Mississippi  Early beginnings  One of the earliest sites in Mississippi. This spot has a variable landscape, but as archaeologists dug deeper they were able to uncover some old Native American cities. The Carson Site was one of the first areas in Mississippi that showed civilizations that were early communities. Socially, people were beginning to centralize around a certain location for safety. This was important as it was able to show people growing with their mental capacities and knew for survival that they needed to live in groups. As they were able to live in large groups, they were able to grow as a community.  Purpose of the mounds  Carson Site Map This site was used by Native Americans from the St. Louis region. These Native Americans traveled down the Mississippi River and settled into the area. One of the key points of this area were the mounds. These mounds showed how people were learning how to use the environment to defend themselves. These mounds had multipurpose uses the bigger they were. One of the largest mounds was able to protect them from raids and attacks. The other purpose of the largest mound was able to store food for the community as well. Lastly, these mounds were elevated compared to the normal terrain. They raised the mounds because it would help battle against flooding. As they were close to the Mississippi River, water levels would rise on occasion and the people of the area knew that they needed to build it in this manner.  Excavation of the area  Mapping of this site began in 1894 by William Henry Morris. It contained 7 different parts which included A,B,C,D,E,F, and the embankment. Currently, the person who is running the excavation program here is Jayur Metha. He is an Anthropological Anthropologist and he stems from Tulane University. Tulane University is located in New Orleans and during the summer Jayur would recruit students to work on the site.  What was found and who lived there  During the excavation period, they archaeologists on the scene had to remove Poison Ivy so they would not get hurt. Once they removed the Poison Ivy they were able to find tools that resembled flint knapping. There were also pots that were found with designs around the rim. It is believed that the Natchez people lived there before European settlers took over the land.

Ramone , Pussy Riot, Eric Bachmann, & many more. The show is noted for its irreverent tone and occasional forays into Insult comedy and a roast like atmosphere. The interplay and frequent frustration between the host and the other on-air personalities being a key part of the show. The shows feature a live weekly game hosted by producer Ryan Collison, which often involve the guests and the listeners.

It is also described as a dynamic field that involves various conceptualizations and re-significations of the body as well as its formation or transformation that affect how bodies are constructed, perceived, evaluated, and experienced. Noted thinkers who developed their respective body theories include Michel Foucault, Norbert Elias, Roland Barthes, and Yuasa Yasuo.  Origin and development  The Western conceptualization of the body has been associated with the theorizing about the self. Ren√© Descartes, for instance, distinguished the mind and the body through his notion of mind/body dualism.Coffey, Julia (2016). Body Work: Youth, Gender and Health. Oxon: Routledge. p. 23. . The developmental trajectory of this theory followed the shifts from the manners that are related to bodily function during the Middle Ages to the modern period with its social forms and the complementary understandings of acceptable bodily behavior. When those theories are evaluated through the idea of bodily abstraction, historical and cultural variations emerge. Scholars identified fundamentally different conceptions based on the qualities they exhibit from the tribal, traditional, modern to postmodern periods. Later developments focus on the growing interest in the materiality of the body - that it is not merely taken as a place to anchor the head. In the East, body theory is said to have emerged out of the Buddhist intellectual and spiritual history. For example, in the Buddhist notion of \\"personal cultivation\\" the body is trained to achieve true knowledge along with one's mind. It also includes the Eastern concept of the authentic self, which - in Japan - pertains to the creative, productive \\"function\\" or \\"field\\" of life energy. Contemporary theorists such as Ichikawa Hiroshi,Sugiman, Toshio; Gergen, Kenneth J.; Wagner, Wolfgang; Yamada, Yoko (2008). Meaning in Action: Constructions, Narratives, and Representations. Springer Science & Business Media. p. 136. . Yuasa Yasuo, and Masachi Osawa drew from these traditions and modulated it with current phenomenological concepts of the \\"lived body\\". There is also the influence of the Hindu belief, which holds that everything has God-nature. It denies the spirit within body theory as it advocates for the freedom of the spirit from the body. This tradition has spawned modern interpretations and reactions. Peter Bertocci, for instance, maintained that the body is not part of Cosmic Mind but is a society of sub- human selves. Modern theorists have used the Eastern view of the body to destabilize the Western body theory with its focus on a form of dualism. These include Friedrich Nietzsche, Emmanuel Levinas, and Roland Barthes.  Theories  Sigmund Freud explored the concept of the body through his notion of the \\"bounded body\\" in the essay Beyond the Pleasure Principle. He noted that a completely closed body is deprived of the means of ongoing life while an absolutely open one without borders would not be a body at all because it would have no ongoing identity. Freud maintained that what is required is a bounded body that has a border or membrane that enables it to have a communion with an outside. German sociologist Norbert Elias, one of the earliest body theorists, posited a related theory, which holds that the body is malleable since it evolves in and is shaped by social configurations. It is also is interdependent with other bodies in a variety of ways. This approach to body theory views the body as continually in a flux, undergoing changes, which are many and largely unforeseen. Michel Foucault's theory of the body, on the other hand, focuses on how it serves as a site of discourse and power as well as an object of discipline and control. He argued that the materiality of power operates on the bodies of individuals to create the kind of body that the society needs. This conceptualization of the body is related to theories with feminist orientations. There are also feminist interpretations that view the female body as socially, culturally, and legally defined in terms of their sexual availability to men. Recent theorizations have given rise to labels such as the naturalistic and materialistic body. The former, which sociologist Chris Shilling advocated, focuses on the idea that there is a biological explanation and basis for human behavior. This is demonstrated in the suggestion that human behavior is explained by and encoded within the gene.  Healthism  Another area in body theory is called healthism. It approaches the concept of the body, particularly health and disease within the context of the individual. This theoretical strand, which emerged from the subdiscipline in sociology called \\"sociology of health and illness\\", addresses the so-called objectification or the reduction of bodily expriences to signifiers of disease and illness. Instead of theorizing the body based on researching external approach or on speculative writing from the psychoanalitic version of the \\"internal\\", healthism focus on how the body is experienced as a way of getting a better theoretical hold of the concept. Some interpretations of this ideology have also drawn from Foucault's works (e.g. Foucault's notion of biopower) to describe the body as a material site where discursive formations are fleshed out.  New body theory  A post-modern interpretation of the body theory emerged for the purpose of overturning the universal conceptions of the body. This view, which is called \\"new-body theory\\", emphasizes the relationship between the body and the self. It produced the theories that explain the importance of the body in the contemporary social life. These could include different orientations such as those focusing on gender, ethnicity or other socially-constructed differences. For example, a feminist approach looks at domination and subversion as a way of examining the conditions and experiences of embodiment in society. There are also theorists who cite the role that media communications, globalization, international trade, consumerism, education, and political incursions, among others play in theorizing the modern embodied being.

It's part of the Wenatchee Mountains, which are a subset of the Cascade Range, and is situated in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Surprise Creek and Deception Creek, both tributaries of the Skykomish River. The nearest higher neighbor is Thunder Mountain, to the northeast, and Terrace Mountain is set to the southwest. The Pacific Crest Trail skirts this peak as it passes through Surprise Gap. Climate Surprise Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

She is an adjunct Associate Professor in the Institute for Learning Sciences and Teacher Education (ILSTE) at the Australian Catholic University. This title was awarded \\"in recognition of her international reputation and scholarly expertise in the field of Senior Secondary English Curriculum.\\" Macken-Horarik is known for her contributions to systemic functional linguistics and its application to literacy, language and English education.  Biography  Born in 1953, Mary Macken-Horarik is the eldest of ten children and she was educated at Catholic schools in Sydney, Australia. She completed her Diploma of Education at the University of New South Wales in 1977. Becoming increasingly interested in linguistics, in 1984, she took up a post as a teacher-linguist in a bilingual school in the remote Aboriginal town of Wadeye in the Northern Territory. In 1987, she completed her Master of Education studies at Deakin University focusing on functional approaches to language and literacy education. Macken-Horarik went on to complete her PhD at the University of Sydney in 1996, under the supervision of James Martin. Her thesis was titled 'Construing the invisible: specialized literacy practices in junior secondary English'. Since obtaining her PhD degree, Macken-Horarik has worked as a teacher linguist and a teacher educator at several Australian universities. She has been a recipient of two highly prestigious Australian Research Council (ARC) awards, most recently leading a Discovery Research Project investigating the character of a grammatics that is ‚Äògood enough‚Äô for school subject English.  Contributions to linguistics  Macken-Horarik's contributions to linguistics lie in her remarkable ability to move between the specialist fields of systemic functional linguistics and the needs of devoted teachers who have not had time or opportunity to study language formally. In 2009, she joined the advisory committee on the Australian curriculum for English. Following that, between 2010 - 2011, she became chief writer of the Language strand of the Australian Curriculum. Her efforts to make linguistic breakthroughs appliable and accessible to language educators were recognised by the Australian Research Council in 2011 when the project 'Grammar and Praxis: Investigating a Grammatics for 21st Century English' was awarded an ARC grant worth AU$449,951 (Chief investigators: Mary Macken-Horarik, Len Unsworth, and Kristina Love). According to the ARC, this project \\"will yield vital information about how grammar contributes to development of coherent, cumulative and portable KAL [knowledge about language] at key stages of schooling.\\" The main publication resulting from this project so far is the book titled 'Functional Grammatics: Re- conceptualizing Knowledge about Language and Image for School'. As Frances Christie states in 'Language, context and text', \\"A grammatics of the kind pursued in his volume offers a great deal to teachers looking for a rewarding and productive model of English language for teahing purposes... Macken- Horarik, Love, Sandiford and Unsworth have made a valuable contribution to English education and to appliable linguistics.\\" From 2010 to 2016, Macken- Horik also contributed as a researcher, consultant and professional guide to the Secondary Literacy Improvement Program (SLIP) in Melbourne. In Matruglio's words, both the \\"Grammatics\\" and \\"SLIP\\" projects are of utmost significance as \\"such research facilitates a sharing of expertise and the development of a common understanding of educational issues between researchers and practitioners.\\"  Selected publications  The majority of Macken-Horarik's research publications explore the relationship between knowledge about language (KAL) and literacy, focusing on the needs of students for whom subject English is an enigma, a problem and a barrier to success in schooling.

Washington enjoys impromptu tambourine performances with gospel and zydeco groups, seeking out collaborations and invitations at live shows to join whoever is on stage. She hits the tambourine with her hands, elbows and knees so enthusiastically that she is in the habit of breaking her tambourines, and must carry spares. Funk bandleader Charmaine Neville says that Washington joins her on stage occasionally, \\"beating the hell out of the tambourine.\\" Early life Washington was born in Denham Springs, Louisiana, in 1957. When she was five years old, she witnessed her second cousin and godmother Wilhomenia Jackson Landry in church singing along with the congregation, playing the tambourine by a window, the instrument appearing surrounded by an aura of fire. Washington wished that she could play like that. She said later, \\"It took me years to realize that I had received the gift from heaven...\\" At the age of 13, she sang in the local youth choir under director Kenneth Mitchell and then was accepted into the Louisiana All-State Youth Choir. In school, she learned how to play drums, congas, saxophone, trumpet, organ and other keyboards. Washington graduated from Denham Springs High School and then from Southern University in Baton Rouge in 1977 with a degree in journalism. Gospel music Washington's first appearance at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival was on April 29, 1993, when she accompanied her friends the Banks Family, a gospel group from Violet, Louisiana, where she lived at the time. She had encouraged the Banks Family to apply to the festival, promising she would play tambourine with them. After the Banks Family performance in the festival's gospel tent, other gospel groups spontaneously asked Washington to play with them that same day or the next. After that, she returned to the gospel tent each year as a paid percussionist, available upon request. In that role she accompanied many famous gospel artists including Charles G. Hayes, Dottie Peoples, Richard Smallwood and Shirley Caesar. In 2003, Washington joined Stevie Wonder on stage at the Essence Music Festival in New Orleans. She was in the audience at the Essence Fest in 2016 while French Montana was performing \\"Pop That\\" when another attendee recorded her playing the tambourine in the audience. He uploaded the video to Twitter and it went viral. In 2003 at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Washington was rejected by several gospel groups who did not want her stage presence to take attention away from themselves. In 2007 she was physically prevented from entering the stage to accompany Bobby Jones and the Nashville Super Choir. A woman police officer blocked the stairs up to the stage. Washington said later, \\"I used to play with every act, but I was getting all the attention, and all the pictures were being taken of me, so they put me off. Now I play in the Gospel Tent by invitation only.\\" One of her performances in front of a gospel choir in 2007 was reviewed as channeling \\"uproarious joy\\". The festival organizers knew that Washington was popular with the crowds, so in 2008 they gave her a third headliner set in the gospel tent, backed by the Greater Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church choir. Washington showed up 40 minutes late for her own set on April 25. A week later at the same Jazz Fest, she was invited on stage by country music star Tim McGraw to help him on the song \\"I Like It, I Love It.\\" McGraw said, \\"It sorta happened organically... She was around, and I thought it was a cool thing.\\" Washington also joined guitarist and singer Ruthie Foster in the blues tent for an electrifying song that was met with a standing ovation from an overflow audience. Foster said that Washington \\"was really, really gracious about waiting for me to let her know when I wanted her to come onstage. She took it to another level.\\" In 2011, Washington jumped up on stage with Eric Lindell and his band to energize the Bo Diddley song \\"You Can't Judge a Book by the Cover\\", engaging Lindell's drummer Will McMains, with Lindell grinning the whole time. Singer-songwriter Dayna Kurtz said in 2012 about the Jazz Festival in New Orleans, \\"Look for the tambourine lady. If she's on stage in the gospel tent then you know the band is worthwhile.\\" Washington was honored as the featured performer in May 2017 at Gospel in the Park in Gonzales, Louisiana, backed by the Hosea Reddit Family. She performed at the first annual Riverfront Jazz Festival in Dallas, Texas, in September 2017, at the blues and soul main stage, joining the New Orleans Soul Band. Other music Washington has played with many other artists including Rockin' Dopsie and the Zydeco Twisters in 2007 at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. Washington has also joined New Orleans brass bands marching in town, and Mardi Gras Indians. She performed with an eclectic group of musicians led by Quintron in 2012 at the nonprofit collective New Orleans Airlift. She appears regularly with Charmaine Neville's funk band at Snug Harbor. Neville's veteran keyboard player Amasa Miller said about Washington, \\"She's one of those people who defy category. There's nobody doing what she does. There are musicians that forge their own little place. It becomes their own little calling card... the kind of no-category category.\\" Jazz and rock drummer Steve Gadd wrote a song inspired by Washington titled \\"Lady Tambourine\\". Acting Washington appeared on stage in the community theatre musical Purlie, produced in New Orleans at Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carre. Other stage plays include A Raisin in the Sun, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Rose Tattoo, and Tambourines to Glory. In 1995 she had a small part in the film Dead Man Walking and in 2003 she played gospel choir member Faye Jenkins in The Fighting Temptations. Other movies include the made-for-television Bump in the Night (1991), and the major studio films Runaway Jury (2003), Last Holiday (2006), American Violet (2008) and The Butler (2013). In the mid-2000s, she was seen in a series of television commercials for Winn-Dixie. In April 2008, Washington took part in the The Vagina Monologues musical stage production mounted inside the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans as a benefit against violence. She accompanied Reverend Louis Dejean and the Voices of New Orleans Gospel Choir in a rousing number that sparked a barefoot dancing celebration from country music star Faith Hill. Personal life After college in Baton Rouge, Washington married in 1980 and set up home in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. She and her husband had three children: Danny Jr, Danitra and Dantonio. After the marriage dissolved, she lived in various locations including Violet and Uptown New Orleans. In 2005, her Uptown residence was flooded by Hurricane Katrina, and she moved back to Baton Rouge. Washington is known for her tambourine playing in support of Southern Jaguars football and LSU Tigers football games where she performs unrehearsed in the crowd along with the cheerleaders and marching band. Videos of her tambourine enthusiasm at football games went viral on Facebook in November and December 2017, leading to a profile about her on ABC News. In addition to playing music, Washington like to write poetry and to sketch. She works occasionally as a substitute teacher, and as a parking lot attendant at the Superdome.

She is an honorary associate in the department of educational studies at Macquarie University, where she has been teaching and researching for over 30 years. Torr‚Äôs research draws on systemic functional linguistic theory to explore the relationship between context and meaning in adult-child interactions, and the implications for children‚Äôs learning. She has published over 50 peer-reviewed journal articles and book chapters, as well as publications in professional journals.  Biography  In 1976 Torr completed an undergraduate degree at the University of New South Wales majoring in English literature. Her Honours thesis took as its subject the medieval English mystic Margery Kempe. Torr completed a graduate diploma in linguistics at University College London in 1978. She then undertook her PhD studies at the University of Sydney under the supervision of M. A. K. Halliday in the department of linguistics. Her doctoral research focused on the language development of infants in the first two years of life. In 1984 Torr was appointed as a tutor at the department of English and linguistics at Macquarie University. In 1990 Torr moved to the Institute of Early Childhood at Macquarie University, serving as the head of the institute from 2007-2009. Her research has been funded by grants including Australian Research Council Discovery grants and Macquarie University External Collaborative Grants. She retired in 2014 and continues her active research program in an honorary capacity exploring the language and literacy environments experienced by infants in early childhood education and care centres.  Major contributions = Linguistics  Torr has employed systemic functional linguistic theory to undertake research in an area of national and international concern: the quality of early childhood education and care programs for children aged from birth to five years. Her efforts to record rich infant interactions were recognised by the Australian Research Council (ARC) in 2014 when the project 'Investigating educator-infant talk and infant-peer interactions in Long Day Care' was awarded an ARC grant worth AU$258,000.00 (Chief Investigators: Sheila Degotardi, Jane Torr, and Benjamin Bradley). This research has found an association between the professional qualifications of early childhood educators and their language choices when addressing infants, including their patterns of questioning, reasoning, and directing infants‚Äô behaviour. Torr's 2008-2010 project 'Creche care and bilingual language and literacy development for children of newly arrived parents attending English language program' received $98,500 from Industry partners Lady Gowrie Child Centre NSW and NSW Adult Migrant English Service.  Early Childhood Education  Torr has taught in initial early childhood teacher education programs for over 25 years. Her language and literacy courses have sought to make SFL theoretical concepts accessible and relevant to early childhood educators. In 2018 she authored a booklet published by peak national body Early Childhood Australia titled Learning to Read, for an intended readership of Australian educators, parents and carers of young children. In 2008-2009 Torr was a member of the consortium chosen via competitive tender by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to write Australia‚Äôs first national early childhood curriculum, the Early Years Learning Framework. She was part of the strand responsible for writing the language and literacy outcomes and assessment. The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) developed the Framework to ‚Äúassist educators to provide young children with opportunities to maximise their potential and develop a foundation for future success in learning‚Äù (p. 5).. Since January 2012 it is mandatory for the Early Years Learning Framework to be implemented in all early childhood services in Australia. The mandatory nature of the document has been reported to intensify the obligation to provide high quality professional learning opportunities, particularly for less experienced or less qualified educators. In 2018, Torr contributed to a review of early literacy programs in NSW Public Libraries (led by Emilia Djonov and with Marie Stenglin), leading to the development of a Framework for all NSW library staff to guide and evaluate the early literacy programs they offer free to children under 5 years of age, and their parents and carers. As a part of the collaborative research project 'Developing a context-sensitive framework for supporting early literacy across NSW public libraries', their commissioned report highlighted research that can inform public libraries in developing effective initiatives for promoting early literacy in the communities they serve.

Sulaiman was grievously assaulted by the gang while his two friends managed to escape. During the assault, Sulaiman sustained 13 stab wounds and two of them were fatal; he died as a result. The case was classified as murder and within the next 13 months, six of the gang members involved were arrested and eventually sentenced to jail and caning for culpable homicide, rioting and voluntarily causing grievous hurt. However, till today, the remaining two assailants were never caught. The act On the night of 30 May 2001, ten Malay members of Salakau gang gathered at a discotheque at Mohamed Sultan Road to celebrate the 18-year-old birthday of a fellow member, Muhammad Syamsul Ariffin bin Brahim (nicknamed \\"Aki\\"). They were joined in by the girlfriends of the Salakau gang members. After doing so, they went for snacks and drinks at a coffee shop nearby River Valley Road at 3 am on 31 May 2001. Later, the gang decided to launch a surprise attack on the rivalling 303 (Sakongsa) gang members roaming around Boat Quay, and for this, eight of the members proceeded to initiate the attack while the remaining two members - only named as Mohamad Khairsofian (nicknamed \\"Pian\\") and Sofian (nicknamed \\"Yan\\") in court documents - went home with their girlfriends. In the meantime, 17-year-old national youth football player and ITE student Sulaiman bin Hashim was walking along South Bridge Road with his two friends and soccer players Muhammad Shariff bin Abdul Samat and Mohamed Imran bin Mohamed Ali, both aged 17, to City Hall MRT station. It was then the Salakau gang members had spotted them while they were walking on the other side of the road to look for rival gang members. Led by 21-year-old Norhisham bin Mohamad Dahlan (nicknamed \\"Baby\\"), the Salakau gang members crossed the road, approaching the three boys from behind. Norhisham then asked the three boys (having noticed the presence of the gang from behind) in Malay which gang do they belong to. However, before they could reply, Norhisham proceeded to punch one of the boys, Sulaiman, and assaulted him together with the other 7 gang members in front of several witnesses. Shariff was also briefly attacked and stabbed on the back, but he managed to escape together with Imran. They both reached the nearest police station to seek help. By the time help arrived, Sulaiman, who has been severely assaulted by the gang, was found lying unconscious outside a pub with a total of 13 stab wounds on his neck, legs, shoulders, chest and head, as well as severe head injuries and bruises on his body. Sulaiman was pronounced dead at 5 am in Singapore General Hospital. An autopsy conducted by forensic pathologist Dr Paul Chui revealed that it was the two stab wounds - one to his neck, and the other to his chest - that killed Sulaiman. The victim Sulaiman and his two friends who were ambushed did not belong to any gang. Sulaiman was the third child out of seven siblings in his family. Shariff, who was the son of former Singaporean international soccer player Samad Allapitchay, was hospitalised for his injury and he survived; he would later on, together with Imran, became the prosecution's key witnesses against the gang members accused of Sulaiman's murder. Initial arrests and sentences=First four arrests of Salakau gang members Following the footballer's murder, police investigations were conducted and the police soon established the identities of the eight youths. Within a month after the incident, four of the Salakau secret society members were arrested by the police. On 15 June 2001, 21-year-old Muhamad Hasik bin Sahar became the first gang member to be arrested. 10 days later, on 25 June 2001, three more youths - 20-year-old Fazely bin Rahmat (nicknamed \\"Pendek\\"), 20-year-old Mohammad Ridzwan bin Samad (nicknamed \\"Chemong\\") and 18-year-old Mohammad Fahmi bin Abdul Shukor - were arrested for their involvement in the murder. They were all charged with murder, which carries the mandatory death penalty under Singapore law. However, four other gang members of Salakau, consisting of Norhisham, Syamsul Ariffin and two other youths, 19-year-old Khairul Famy bin Mohamed Samsudin (nicknamed \\"Fami\\") and Sharulhawzi bin Ramly (also spelt Sharulhawazi bin Ramy in some sources; nicknamed \\"Boy Sharul\\" or simply \\"Sharul\\"), whose age was unspecified, had fled Singapore and they were wanted by the police. Khairul's arrest On 11 September 2001, after spending 3 months on the run, Khairul was arrested in Batam, Indonesia by the Indonesian police. He was extradited back to Singapore on the same day itself, and after his return to Singapore, Khairul became the fifth gang member of Salakau to be charged with murder together with Hasik, Fazely, Fahmi and Ridzwan. The remaining three suspects were believed to be hiding in Malaysia. Fahmi and Ridzwan's sentences Later on, the charges against two of the five gang members, Fahmi and Ridzwan, were amended to lesser charges of rioting and for abetting their fellow Salakau gang members to riot under section 147 of the Penal Code. The pair, who were tasked to look for rival gang members whom they intended to attack on the day of Sulaiman's murder, pleaded guilty to the amended charges and they were being dealt with in the Subordinate Courts; on 22 November 2001, Fahmi and Ridzwan were each sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane for their roles in the fatal attack of Sulaiman. Reduction of Hasik's murder charge: Hasik's sentence Following the sentencing and incarceration of Fahmi and Ridzwan, the murder charge against Hasik was later amended to a lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (or manslaughter), and he pleaded guilty to the amended charge. On 9 May 2002, Hasik was sentenced to life imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane by then-Judicial Commissioner (JC) Tay Yong Kwang; the life sentence was backdated to the date of Hasik's arrest. When he was 16, Hasik was once charged with and convicted of causing hurt with dangerous weapons, and sentenced to reformative training in 1996. When delivering his verdict, having made reference to Hasik's criminal records, JC Tay felt that Hasik has not learnt his lesson even after his previous experience in court, and now that he has committed a crime of greater violence and an innocent life has been lost as a result, which compelled the judge into committing Hasik to life imprisonment. In his words, JC Tay reiterated in his judgement as he ordered Hasik to be locked away for life, \\"Those who feel victorious in being vicious and who have no qualms about the annual celebration of one's birth culminating in the untimely death of another will have to spend all subsequent birthdays within prison walls until such time as they are eligible for parole.\\" Hasik was said to have broke into tears as he heard the sentence being passed. He later filed an appeal against the life sentence, but it was turned down by the Court of Appeal on 27 August 2002. The reduction of Hasik's charge, as well as those of Fahmi and Ridzwan, left both Fazely and Khairul the sole two members to stand trial for murder; they chose to plead not guilty. If found guilty of murder, Fazely and Khairul would be sentenced to death. Murder trial of Fazely and Khairul The trial of Fazely and Khairul began on 8 May 2002. Fazely was represented by lawyers B. J. Lean and Amarick Gill Singh, while Khairul was represented by veteran lawyer Subhas Anandan (1947‚Äì2015) and another lawyer, Anand Nalachandran. The case was heard before then-Judicial Commissioner (JC) Choo Han Teck in the High Court. Both the boys, in their defence, stated they did not have the intention to murder Sulaiman, and that they only tagged along, thinking that the gang's intention was to go beat up rival gang members like they usually did and that they had never used weapons during their previous fights, claiming that they were not aware until the attack that their leader Norhisham and two others, Syamsul Ariffin and Sharulhawzi were armed with knives (they were the ones who stabbed Sulaiman during the attack). Their defence was countered by the prosecution, consisting of Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Ng Cheng Thiam and DPP Imran Abdul Hamid, who sought to dispute their defences and argued that they in fact had the knowledge that some of their fellow gang members were armed. On 8 July 2002, at the end of the trial, JC Choo acquitted both boys of murder, and instead, he found both Fazely and Khairul guilty of rioting under section 147 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to 5 years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane each, and backdate their sentences to the respective dates of their arrests. In his judgement, JC Choo determined that the common intention of the gang was to find rival gang members and beat them up, and that not all the gang members were armed. He also stated he was not convinced that the boys had indeed seen the others using knives to stab Sulaiman, or even if the boys carried on assaulting the victim after he was stabbed, that they had the intention to cause death or cause grievous hurt with dangerous weapons. In his words, JC Choo reiterated in his judgement as he passed the sentence on both Fazely and Khairul, \\"In cases such as this where a young and innocent life is senselessly slain, the retribution of the law must be inflicted swiftly and firmly but, appropriately, as against the diverse offenders and the diverse nature of their crime.\\" The prosecution appealed against the acquittal of the two boys but the Court of Appeal agreed with and upheld JC Choo's decision to acquit the two boys of murder and dismissed the prosecution's appeal; however, the three judges - High Court judge Tan Lee Meng, Judge of Appeal Chao Hick Tin and Chief Justice Yong Pung How - who heard the appeal were of the opinion that both Fazely and Khairul had committed a more serious crime of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to Sulaiman based on their review of the other physical injuries found on the victim and thus, they convicted both boys of that particular crime and increased each of their sentences to 7 years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. Norhisham's arrest On 30 June 2002, a little more than a year after Sulaiman's death, Norhisham was arrested in Malaysia and extradited back to Singapore to stand trial for causing Sulaiman's death. Initially charged with murder, Norhisham later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. On 25 July 2003, despite the urgings of the prosecution for Norhisham to be imprisoned for life and to receive 24 strokes of the cane, Justice Woo Bih Li instead sentenced Norhisham to 10 years' imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane, on the basis that despite his greater culpability as compared to that of Hasik; who was convicted of the same offence (Norhisham used a knife to stab Sulaiman while Hasik was not armed, making Norhisham playing a more deadlier role than Hasik for causing Sulaiman's death), Norhisham, in contrast to Hasik (who was previously convicted for a violent offence, as mentioned above), did not have any previous convictions for violent offences in his criminal records (he was previously convicted of theft of motor vehicles and drug consumption). Due to this, Justice Woo stated that he felt the gang leader should not be treated akin to one previously convicted of a violent offence (referring to Hasik, who had a violent antecedent to his name). For this, Justice Woo felt it would be inappropriate to impose a life term on Norhisham and thus he sentenced Norhisham to the next highest punishment of 10 years' imprisonment with effect from the date of Norhisham's arrest (30 June 2002), in addition to 16 strokes of the cane. The prosecution's appeal for Norhisham to be sentenced to life imprisonment was later dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 23 September 2003. Sentences The following were the convictions and sentences received by the gang members of Salakau (except for the two absconded gang members Syamsul Ariffin and Sharulhawzi) for their part in Sulaiman's death, sequentially from the heaviest to the lightest sentence: * Muhamad Hasik bin Sahar, 21: convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, sentenced to life imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane. *Norhisham bin Mohamad Dahlan, 21 (the gang leader): convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment and 16 strokes of the cane. *Fazely bin Rahmat, 20: initially sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for rioting by the High Court. Later convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, and sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane by the Court of Appeal. *Khairul Famy bin Mohamed Samsudin, 19: initially sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for rioting by the High Court. Later convicted of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, and sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane by the Court of Appeal. *Mohammad Fahmi bin Abdul Shukor, 18: convicted of rioting, sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. *Mohammad Ridzwan bin Samad, 20: convicted of rioting, sentenced to 3 years' imprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane. *Muhammad Syamsul Ariffin bin Brahim, 18: NIL (on the run since 31 May 2001) *Sharulhawzi bin Ramly, age unknown: NIL (on the run since 31 May 2001) Aftermath The case of Sulaiman bin Hashim was re-enacted in a Singaporean crime show True Files. It aired as the thirteenth and final episode of the show's fourth season on 25 June 2006, depicting the case and placing its focus especially on the court proceedings against both Fazely and Khairul for murder. In the episode, the real-life photographs of the apprehended culprits involved were withheld to protect their identities. The 5-season crime show (consisting of 62 episodes) is available on meWATCH (previously named Toggle) from 5 February 2016 onwards, and is currently viewable on the website. After the incident, according to Khairul's lawyer Subhas Anandan, who was interviewed on-screen in the episode, he revealed that Khairul had expressed remorse over the incident, and confided to Mr Anandan that he was feeling sad and sorry for the victim Sulaiman for his death and for mistaking him as a member of a rival gang, but it was too late for him to regret. It was reported that Sulaiman's untimely death was a big loss and tragedy to the National U-18 squad (Sulaiman's football team), as well as his fellow team players and friends; they all held Sulaiman's future with high regard due to the victim's exceptional talent and skills. The Football Association of Singapore and NTUC Income also reportedly donated $20,000 out of goodwill to Sulaiman's family and offered condolences to the bereaved family, hoping that this gesture will further encourage Sulaiman's two younger brothers (also national soccer players) to continue playing the sport. One of Sulaiman's two friends, Muhammad Shariff bin Abdul Samat, who survived the stabbing from the Salakau attack, went on to continue playing soccer, establishing a club career and even briefly represented Singapore in a friendly match against Myanmar; he was also married in an unspecified year and had a daughter sometime in 2015 or 2016. Shariff would die from a heart attack at the age of 36 on 10 February 2020, nearly 18 years and 9 months after Sulaiman's unfortunate death. The fate of Sulaiman's other friend, Mohamed Imran bin Mohamed Ali, till today, is unknown. As of October 2020, with the exception of Hasik, the other gang members who were jailed for their part in Sulaiman's death are presumably released from prison after serving out their respective sentences. Hasik is still in prison serving his life sentence; he will probably be spending the rest of his natural life behind bars, unless he is paroled when he gains eligibility for parole upon the review of his conduct after serving at least 20 years of his life sentence. Syamsul Ariffin and Sharulhawzi are still on the run as of today.

He played college football at the University of Hawaii.  Playing career  Stutzmann was a four-year letterman at the University of Hawaii, where he played wide receiver. He started in three seasons as a slotback in June Jones' run and shoot offense, garnering two honorable mentions in all-WAC selections on his way to 2,025 career receiving yards. He made headlines in the final game of his college career in 2001 when he was ejected in the game against BYU for punting a football into the stands and jumping into them after scoring a touchdown. Stutzmann has stated that he does not regret doing the punt and that he probably would've practiced to punt it higher. He spent one season with the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League after his college career before getting into coaching.  Coaching career  Stutzmann began his coaching career as Kalaheo High School in 2003, serving as the offensive coordinator for the football team. He was hired by his alma mater Saint Louis School in 2004 as a varsity assistant before being named the head coach of the junior varsity team in 2005. He was named a graduate assistant on the coaching staff at Hawaii in 2008, before leaving to join Jerry Glanville's staff at Portland State in 2009 as a wide receivers coach. After Glanville resigned from Portland State in 2009, Stutzmann left and accepted a position at Memphis as a graduate assistant. He was named the wide receivers coach at Rhodes College in Memphis in 2011, only spending one season there before being named the wide receivers coach at Weber State in 2012. He was named the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Emory & Henry in 2014, spending two seasons there before accepting a position on the coaching staff at Hawaii in 2016.  Second stint at Hawaii  Stutzmann was hired at Hawaii as the team's passing game coordinator under former teammate Nick Rolovich. He was also named the quarterbacks coach after Zak Hill left to be the offensive coordinator at Boise State. After Rolovich left to be the next head coach at Washington State, Stutzmann was rumored to be a top candidate to replace Rolovich as head coach at Hawaii, garnering support from the Hawaii fanbase and received an endorsement from Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota, who played at Saint Louis while Stutzmann was coaching at the school.  Washington State  After Todd Graham was hired as Rolovich's successor at Hawaii, Stutzmann was officially added to Rolovich's staff at Washington State. He was named the co- offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, sharing coordinator duties with Brian Smith.  Personal life and education  Born in Hilo, Hawaii and raised in Honolulu, Stutzmann attended Saint Louis School before attending the University of Hawaii. He earned his bachelor's degree in political science from Hawaii in 2002, and his master's in education from Hawaii in 2010. Stutzmann and his wife Briana have one son, Baylor. His brother Billy Ray was also a wide receiver at Hawaii and is currently an offensive assistant at the US Naval Academy.

The city of Sirte is considered strategically important because of its close position to oil facilities, which give it control over Libya's oil and gas shipping ports. The Al Jufra Airbase is strategically important for the GNA, due to its central position to Fezzan and denying the Libyan National Army air superiority over Central Libya. The campaign began on 6 June 2020, one day after the conclusion of the 2019‚Äì2020 Western Libya campaign, a failed attempt by the Libyan National Army to capture Tripoli. Background A civil war has been ongoing in Libya since 2014, and after 2016 the country was mainly divided between the Tobruk-based House of Representatives in the east, and the Government of National Accord in Tripoli and western Libya. Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army provided military support to the House of Representatives. The rival governments both claim to be the legitimate government of Libya. The GNA is internationally recognised by the United Nations Security Council as the government of Libya, though the LNA receives support from several countries, including Russia, United Arab Emirates, and France. By 2019 the LNA controlled more than half of Libya, while the GNA mainly controlled Tripoli and a few other areas. In April 2019, Haftar's forces launched an operation to take control of the capital Tripoli from the GNA and unite all of Libya. After fourteen months of fighting, the GNA held Tripoli and pushed the eastern forces out of the city by 4 June 2020. After that, the GNA military launched a counteroffensive against Haftar's forces. The town of Sirte and the nearby Al Jufra airbase are considered essential to take control of Libya's oil ports along the Mediterranean Sea, and the airbase houses MiG-29 fighters and Su-24 bombers provided by Russia to Haftar's forces.Road to Libya's liberation passes through Al-Jufra base.

He owned Sels√∏ Manor on the Hornsherred peninsula. Early life and education Barby was the illegitimate son of Nicolaus von Barby of Loburg and Isterlin (died 1524). His father served as district governor of Gommern. Barby was educated under Hieronymus Schurff in Wittenberg. Career Barby began to work for Duke Magnus I, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, Christian III's father-in-law, who recommended him to the Danish king. In 1541, Christian II used him in the negotiations with the Pommeranian dukes. In February 1542, he was given a three-year contract as a royal messenger with an annual salary of 100 guilders. In November 1543, he succeeded Georg C√∂rper as leader of Tyske Kancelli. He was in this connection granted St. Lawrence's Chapel and the Provostry of Roskilde as fiefs in addition to an annual salary of 40 guilders. He was later granted the Provostry of Viborg as payment instead of the 40 guilders. In June 1545, he was also granted St. Claire's Chapel in Roskilde as a fief. In the verdict over Peder Oxe from June 1558 as well as at Christian III's funeral (by Jacob Bording), Barby is referred to as \\"German Chancellor\\" (de facto Foreign Minister) but it is unclear if he was ever officially appointed as such. In the later 1550s, Barby seems to have maintained a close relationship with the circle around Johann Friis and Peder Oxe. He was later on more closely affiliated with the Privy Council's conservative alliance around Mogens Gyldenstierne. In 1559, he recommended Frederick II to join the planned campaign against Ditmarsken. Property In 1547‚Äì48, Christian III granted him Faurholm at Giller√∏d. He was involved in a bitter boundary dispute with Herluf Trolle and ended up selling the estate for 17,000 daler to Peder Oxe. That same year he was naturalized as a Danish nobleman. He was in 1556 also granted Sels√∏ and was the following year granted royal permission to turn it into a ' (family trust) for his nephew Hans von Barby. Personal life and legacy Andreas von Barby died in 1559 and is buried in Roskilde Cathedral. Hans von Barby sold Sels√∏ shortly after his uncle's death.

Origin The earliest Tampii known from inscriptions came from Praeneste, an ancient city of Latium, probably indicating that they were Latins; but at least three of this gens bore the cognomen Sabinus, typically indicating a tradition of Sabine descent, or some other association with Sabine manners or appearance.Chase, p. 114. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Tampia gens were Lucius and Gaius, the two most common names at all periods of Roman history. Several Tampii also bore other common praenomina, such as Marcus, Publius, and Quintus, while a few had more distinctive names, such as Decimus and Servius.

He served as Rosh Yeshivah of Sfas Emes Yeshivah from 1993 until its closing in 2016.  Early life  Born in Jerusalem to Tziporah a daughter of Rebbi Avraham Mordecahi Alter (son of Rabbi Moshe Betzalel Alter brother of Rebbe Avraham Mordechai Alter of Ger) and to Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Alter Rosh Yeshivah of Sfas Emes Yeshivah and later to date Rebbe of the Ger Hasidic Dynasty. He is named after the grandfather of his mother Rabbi Shaul Moshe Zilberman. He studied in Imrei Emes Yeshivah in Bnei Brak, and afterward continued to learn under his father's guidance in Sfas Emes Yeshivah where he was known as an outstanding student where he finished the entire Talmud. In the year of 1977 he married Naomi daughter of Rabbi Chaim Dov Rubinstein from the city of Haifa. After his marriage he lived in Haifa where he was appointed as Maggid Shiur of Ohr Simcha Yeshivah in Haifa. He was also given the opportunity to give in depth shiurim in the Beis Yisroel Yeshivah of Ashdod. After the death of his uncle Rebbe Simcha Bunim Alter of Ger in the year 1992, his father who was then appointed as Rebbe of the Ger Dynasty requested he should move back to his birthplace Jerusalem. In July of 1993 he was given the prestigious position of Rosh Yeshivah of Sfas Emes Yeshivah as per his father's request. He gave in depth shiurim daily and weekly in the Yeshiavh. When the change in the way of learning in the Yeshivas of Ger was switched from Iyun to Bekious, the Shiurim were halted. In the year 2016 the Yeshiva was closed down through orders from the current Rabbi of Ger. His disciples published a series of books, that are based on his in-depth Shiurim, known as Yaalkut Shiurim (in Hebrew ◊ô◊ú◊ß◊ï◊ò ◊©◊ô◊¢◊ï◊®◊ô◊ù).  Split off from the Ger dynasty  After the passing of his father Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Alter (the \\"Pnei Menachem\\"), his father's brother, Rabbi Yaakov Aryeh Alter, was crowned as Rebbe of the Dynasty. Between him and the Rebbe differences of opinion emerged, especially on the subject of Torah study. With the Rebbe's instructions, it was discontinued to study in \\"depth\\" at Yeshivah of Ger. Following a ostracism signed by the leaders of the dynasty in Israel in June 2019 against the current Head of the Board of Camp Ger in the United States (in a case known as the Camp Ger dispute), in which the majority (including some of the leaders) of the community in the United States didn't partake, and even disobeyed it. He wrote a letter of criticism against the establishment, and the establishment of the Ger dynasty in Israel didn't take it lightly, hence his admirers were continuously harassed and shamed by the establishment. In the middle of the Holiday of Sukkos (October 2019), following an attempted reconciliation that failed between him and the Rebbe, his men announced the existence of a separate congregation of prayers on Simchas Torah. In response, the establishment of the dynasty of Ger announced that they would ban students from their institutions whose fathers would attend the separate prayers. During the holiday, hundreds of followers participated in separate prayers and gatherings. Students whose fathers participated in the separate prayers were removed from the Hasidic establishment's institutions. Immediately afterwards, his men announced a split and the establishment of a separate community and institutions, including \\"Yeshivas Pnei Menachem\\". The community in the United States, the source of the conflict, was currently (2020) saved from the Establishment's removal from the institution's, and currently, both factions of the dynasty are united into one community, and are studying in the same institutions and praying in the same synagogues.

Over 2,400,000 pilgrims attended Hajj in 2019. In March 2020, the minister of Hajj and Umrah encouraged those planning to visit the holy sites of Mecca and Medina later in the year to wait before making any bookings. Due to the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 in crowded places, flight restrictions in many countries, and the unavailability of a vaccine against the virus the ministry of Hajj and Umrah took such serious measures. However, in June 2020, the ministry of Hajj and Umrah announced that people from all nationalities who reside in Saudi Arabia are allowed to perform Hajj with a limited number of pilgrims, to ensure the safety and to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.  History  COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic caused by Coronavirus. The outbreak of the virus was first noted in Wuhan, China in early December 2019. On 30 January 2020, COVID-19 was declared by World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and was declared as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The COVID-19 transmission happens mainly through personal contact with a carrier of the coronavirus, which makes it highly contagious in small spaces where human contact is inevitable. COVID-19 can be transmitted through contaminated objects that were touched or coughed on by an infected person. Saudi Arabia closed the two holy sites of Mecca and Medina to stop the virus from spreading, further measures were taken by the Saudi government to prevent an outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, such as imposing 24 hours curfew in Mecca and Medina. Due to COVID-19, Hajj in 2020 was performed by relatively few people. Only those who live in Saudi Arabia, were between the ages of 20 and 50, and who were not displaying symptoms of COVID-19 could participate. Participants had to first apply online prior to being selected to participate, and preference was given to those who have not participated in the past.  Historical cancellations of Hajj  Hajj (pilgrimage) has been cancelled 40 times through the history of Islam due to plague, political disagreements, and battles. In 1523-1533 (930-940 AD), Hajj was canceled due to the Qarmatian attack which led to the murder of 30,000 pilgrims and the looting of the Black Stone. In 1831, Hajj was suspended after a plague that was brought by the pilgrims coming from India, which is claimed to have ended the lives of more than half of the pilgrims in Mecca. The first outbreak of Cholera spread in Mecca happened in 1846, killing more than 15,000 and causing a plague lasting until 1850 in the city. The second outbreak of Cholera happened in 1858, leading to pilgrims being quarantined inside Hajj camps in Egypt.  International responses to Hajj 2020  On 15 May 2020, the Singapore Muslims Council (MUIS) advised to skip Hajj in this year due to COVID-19 pandemic. On 2 June 2020, the Indonesian Minister of Religious Affairs declared cancelling the Hajj of 2020 before any groups of Indonesian pilgrims head to Mecca. On 6 June 2020, the Indian Hajj Committee announced it would provide refunds to all the pilgrims due to the inability of attending Hajj in 2020. On 11 June 2020, Malaysia announced it was barring pilgrims from attending Hajj in 2020 out of concerns over the danger of COVID-19, and the high spreadability of the virus in crowded places.  Attending Hajj 2020  On 23 June 2020, Saudi Arabia announced Hajj would be held for a limited number of pilgrims who reside within the country due to the high risk of COVID-19. The Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah imposed restrictions to the type of pilgrims who can attend Hajj in 2020, including banning older pilgrims from performing Hajj. Only 10,000 pilgrims are expected, as opposed to about two million usually. Pilgrims were chosen from the COVID-19 recovery database, 70% of them were non-Saudi residents.  Precautions  The Saudi Ministry of Health reported taking serious measures during the Hajj 2020, pilgrims who were not effected by the virus were required to quarantine themselves at hotel rooms or at their homes if they live close enough to Mecca for a week prior to the arrival to perform Hajj. Pilgrims were also asked to maintain a safe social distance of two meters inside the holy mosque, pilgrims were separated into groups of 20 individuals per group who are accompanied by a guide through their whole Hajj performance.

Sailor Moon is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game where players take control either of the five original Sailor Soldiers across various stages, each one set in a different location, and fight against an assortment of enemies and villains from the series in order to defeat Queen Beryl and the Dark Kingdom.Sailormoon Mode D'Emploi (Super Nintendo Entertainment System, FRA)ÁæéÂ∞ëÂ•≥Êà¶Â£´„Çª„Éº„É©„Éº„É†„Éº„É≥ ÂèñÊâ±Ë™¨ÊòéÊõ∏ (Sega Mega Drive, JP) Each Soldier has a special attack of their own that deals damage to all enemies on- screen at once by charging it. Unlike other titles based on the franchise, most of the fighting is physical rather than magical and the Soldier can run and perform dashing attacks. Each Soldier also has different attributes during gameplay, encouraging players to select their preferred character.  Development = Super Famicom version  Sailor Moon for Super NES was developed by Angel in response to the success of their previous Game Boy release. Sailor Moon on Super Nintendo Entertainment System was created by a team comprised from staff of the titular sh≈çjo manga and anime series, with producer J≈çji Yuno at Angel heading development, who recounted its making process and history in an official strategy guide by Kodansha from December 1993, four months after the game's release to the market. (Translation by Tuxedo Unmasked. ). Kazuko Tadano, Naoko Takeuchi and Toei Animation artist Yukihiro Kitano were responsible for illustration, original youma designs and character animations respectively. The soundtrack was composed by Takanori Arisawa, who also served as music director of the anime series. Yuno stated that Sailor Moon for the Super Nintendo was created in response to the commercial success their previous title on Game Boy in Japan, as the Super NES hardware imposed less restrictions than the Game Boy and Angel wanted to developed a Sailor Moon for the console. The team desired to have a game that would be enjoyed by all fans and meet expectations from those who liked the characters, prompting the involvement of staff members from both the manga and anime series. Yuno was introduced to Kitano, who created the hand-drawn animation work from paper before being transposed into pixel art, however this process took a large memory space and technical difficulties were faced when displaying four enemies on-screen due to the characters' large size as a result but the team were able to implement them into the game. Yuno also stated that the Sailor Soldiers' attack techniques were based from pro- wrestling magazines. Angel requested Arisawa to compose the music, with Yuno stating that although said music felt like Sailor Moon songs they seemed to not fit the action. Seiy≈´s from the anime series returned to reprise their roles, recording new audio during a break on their schedule due to the project being a character-based game. However, Yuno stated this process also took a large memory space and the characters' attack techniques are spoken quickly due to hardware limits when voice samples are enabled, while simultaneous spoken attacks are disabled during co-op play as a result. Tadano, who was recommended by Nakayoshi editor Fumio Osano to the team at Angel, created art for the cover package, character selection screen, post-transformation poses and the ending. Yuno stated that Tadano also drew more elements that were ultimately scrapped from the final version due to memory space, while having Takeuchi make original youma designs was an idea from Osano due to his desire to see a Sailor Moon title on SNES. Other elements such as destructible vehicles were implemented as a response from players during the game's showcase at a trade show. Several elements, items and stages were either reworked or scrapped before launch.  Release  Sailor Moon was first released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in Japan by Angel on August 27, 1993 and later in Europe by Bandai on November 1994. The game was later ported to the Sega Mega Drive by Arc System Works and TNS, with Ma-Ba publishing it on July 8, 1994.  Reception  Sailor Moon was met with mixed critical reception on both SNES and Mega Drive. Animericas Sergei Shimkevich gave the SNES version a positive outlook, though he regarded the game to be a copy of Final Fight and Street Fighter that brings little new to the genre, and instead relies upon the Sailor Moon series to gain attention. Upon reviewing the Mega Drive version, Animerica said the visuals in the Mega Drive version to be better than previous Sailor Moon titles on SNES. Spanish magazine Minami commended the big sprites and visuals.

He was the originator and host of the Irish Hour radio program that aired on various stations from 1926‚Äì1976, and the owner of the city's WJMJ radio station, from 1947 to 1965. Stanton also served as the President of the Poor Richard Club, and as the Press Secretary to Philadelphia Mayor James Tate. Early life and work Stanton was born in County Cork, in 1907, the 8th of 16 children. He emigrated to the United States as a child and lived with a widowed aunt in Philadelphia. He almost did not make it to the New World, as only a case of \\"Scarletina\\" or Scarlet Fever, kept him from boarding the Titanic. He travelled on another White Star ocean liner, the Haverford, arriving safely in America and settling in Philadelphia. Stanton attended Holy Ghost Prep School and as a young man he joined local theater companies and later had a stint making films and doing vaudeville in New York City. But the stage career did not take off and he ultimately found his vocation in radio. Radio Career Stanton started out as a radio announcer for WIAD, broadcasting from the Essex hotel. He quickly grasped the business and began writing and delivering ad copy to supplement an announcer's salary. The station later became WELK and finally WDAS. Stanton became Philadelphia's pioneer DJ and originated the Irish Hour radio program that was a mainstay in the city for decades. The program featured ninety minutes of Irish music, news and interviews pitched at the city's vast Irish community from 1926 until Stanton's death just days before the program's fiftieth anniversary in 1976. In the late 1930s, when the virulently anti-semitic priest Father Charles Coughlin came to prominence, Stanton's station refused to carry his broadcasts and was picketed for its trouble by Coughlin's backers, but Stanton was firmly opposed to that kind of rhetoric, and would not back down. Coughlin's screeds did not air again on WDAS during Stanton's tenure as vice-president of the station. Stanton's inimitable radio voice was called a \\"baritone with a haunting lilt.\\" In Erin's Heirs, Irish Bonds of Community, author Dennis Clark described his Irish Hour as > . . . a tonic against loneliness, a weekly feast of musical delights, and an > invitation to weekly dances, concerts, meetings, and festivities of ardent > sociability. The depersonalization and disillusionments of the city might > loom on every side, but at Sunday noon, after the racing melody of > \\"O'Sullivan Mor\\" when Pat Stanton's familiar voice welcomed the Irish to > commune with the spirit of their own tradition, the old feelings of warmth > and Celtic vitality were renewed, and the Irish heard once again all of the > echoing gaiety, melancholy, and drama of their past. Stanton left WDAS in 1946 and formed his own company and station, WJMJ, for \\"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,\\" and continued the Irish Hour program for the rest of his life. WJMJ also carried other ethnic hours for the diverse city, including the Greek Hour, the Polish Hour, and the Italian Hour, and Stanton himself performed a Yiddish language program in which his script was translated into phonetics that a son of Ireland could deliver. His love for the country of his birth permeated his work and he organized many benefits for Irish churches and religious orders during his radio career. Stanton served as President of the Philadelphia Radio and Television Broadcasters Association in 1953. He was the Person of the Year for Philadelphia's Broadcast Pioneers in 1972 and earned posthumous admission to its Hall of Fame in 2003. Films Stanton produced some of the earliest travelogues of Ireland for an American audience including \\"Here is Ireland,\\" which premiered at the Belmont Movie Theater in West Philadelphia in 1939 and earned fine reviews. It was among the first full-color features about the Emerald Isle and enjoyed in both Ireland and the U.S.A. The film featured Stanton's lifelong friend, the third President of Ireland, Eamon de Valera. Foray Into Politics Stanton joked that he was such a chronic Republican that he \\"didn't even vote for Kennedy.\\" Nonetheless, an incurable Democrat, Mayor James Tate, lured Stanton out of a comfortable retirement to serve as his Press Secretary in 1968. The job lasted three long years amidst Philadelphia's tumultuous political scene, but Stanton retired from City Hall for good in 1970 with the unanimous praise and admiration of the notoriously tough Philadelphia press corps. In 1966, Stanton was Grand Marshal of Philadelphia's St. Patrick's Day Parade. Retirement Patrick Joseph Stanton and Mary (De Mey) Stanton, 1967 After a career described as an \\"unstoppable surge of luck and hustle,\\" Stanton retired in 1970 to enjoy his growing collection of grandchildren, and well-deserved recreation and contemplation, but he continued to produce and host the Irish Hour for six more years. Many of his papers are collected and on file with the Philadelphia Historical Society. Personal Life In 1937 Stanton married Mary De Mey from Southwest Philadelphia. They had three children, Mary Ellen, Patrick, and Suzanne, who in turn had 10 children and 23 grandchildren. Patrick J. Stanton died in 1976, and Mary followed in 1996.

He was the first freed slave to own property in Gaston County, NC. He was also a business man that owned the land that is known today as Mt. Holly, NC. Early Life At the age of 13, in 1838, he was sold away from his family from a Charleston, SC plantation to the Hoyle plantation in Dallas, NC. While a slave, he taught himself how to read, write and perform arithmetic. He also became a master of carpentry and blacksmithing, among other trades. He married his first wife Rebecca and had 12 children, who were all slaves on the plantation. Becoming a free man One year before the Civil War broke out, the Hoyle family (owners of the plantation Ransom Hunter belonged to) decided it was too expensive to have as many slaves and granted him, his wife, and four of his 12 children freedom. The other children were sold. The Hoyle family gave him 80 acres of land along the Catawba River, which was harsh terrain and considered inadequate for agriculture. He named it Freedom. When he realized the rocky land was an important thoroughfare between Charlotte and Stanley, he established a livery stable for travelers to have their horses shoed. His wife, Rebecca died in 1890. After her death, he married Maggie Wells Hunter for which he had 2 children with. Catawba River Freedom Farm At the time there were no known blacks to own property. Hunter built a large home for his family and worked vigorously to include cornfields and groves of pecan, apple and peach trees on the property. He also had farm land for chickens and cows. In addition, he had 2 livery stables and a general store. He would use his profits to purchase surrounding land. He sold parcels to former slaves from South Carolina who had been displaced after being emancipated. Other freed slaves came to the farm to start businesses and work on the farm because they felt welcome. He then sold land for profit to A.P. Rhyne to build the area's first cotton mill in 1875 and then incorporate it to the town of Mt. Holly in 1879. The name derived from the famed yarn mill in Mount Holly NJ, in hopes of riding the coattails of their success. He donated land for a school and 2 churches: Mt. Sanai Baptist Church and Rock Grove A.M.E. Zion Church which is presently Burge Memorial United Methodist Church. He directly sold the land that was developed as Downtown Mt. Holly. Death Ransom Hunter died on September 24, 1918, at the age of 93. A small headstone was replaced in 2014.

Hype has emerged as a marketing strategy due to the proliferation of social media. Research has shown for some products, consumers have an overwhelming preference for products with limited supply. Moreover, the motivation for these products is conspicuous consumption to signify characteristics about the consumer. Context The luxury market is estimated to be ‚Ç¨1.2 trillion globally, with personal luxury goods having a value of ‚Ç¨260 billion. Online sales grew by 22% during 2018 representing transactions worth ‚Ç¨27 billion. While only 47% of luxury consumers are from generations Y and Z, they represent all of the growth in the luxury market. Hype as a marketing strategy has become popular as millennials are the largest cohort of consumers. Research has indicated that the luxury goods market is dominated by LVMH, Est√©e Lauder, Richemont, and Kering who have generated annual revenues in excess of $USD90 billion. Hype marketing has also been successful as consumers able to secure limited-edition goods are often been able to profitably resell them; the resale market is a $USD24 billion industry. Fashion label Vetements used social media channels to promote a limited- edition hoodie that resulted in 500 units being sold in hours recording sales of ‚Ç¨445,000. Hype allows brands to promote their image above the actual quality of the product. Streetwear brands such as Supreme have collaborated with luxury fashion to command premium prices for their goods. Method Luxury brands typically build hype around a product that has been designed in collaboration, often between high and low fashion brands. Collaborations have been used by some luxury brands to circumvent fast fashion brands copying their designs. Adam Alter an NYU Professor observes that for a strong brand to create a scarcity frenzy, all they need to do is release a limited number of different products, frequently. Hype is often built around the creation of a Pop-up retail. Comme des Gar√ßons is understood to one of the first to use this strategy, leasing a short-term vacant shop solved the storage problems of releasing product for quick sale. The use of celebrities is also popular in creating Hype. The 2017 Fyre Festival is understood to have generated sales of $USD26 million. Hype also plays to a consumers Fear of missing out. Popular culture The term ‚Äòhypebeast‚Äô has been coined to define consumers vulnerable to hype marketing. The origins of the term come from the Hong Kong based company Hypebeast. The behaviours of the hypebeast define hype marketing; the purchase of popular goods they can‚Äôt afford to impress others. Hype also manifests itself in queues with brands often retailing hyped products through pop-up stores. The use of Hype has created a range of associated expressions; * 'Drop' - the actual release of the product * 'Cop' - to purchase the product * 'Taking the L' - unsuccessful in attempt to purchase product Many luxury brands release hyped products via their Online shop. This has led to the creation of companies that allow consumers to use bots to guarantee or improve their chances of purchasing a limited-edition product.

Its predecessor was the Morning Gazette,\\"Globe-Democrat 100th Anniv. History,\\" St. Louis Media History Foundation and it later changed its name to St. Louis Republic. After supporting the Whig Party, the paper became aligned with the Democratic Party. In the late 19th century, the Republic had the second largest circulation in St. Louis, surpassing papers that would survive it, such as the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the St. Louis Star-Times. Its final owner was David R. Francis, a prominent political figure. In 1919, after years of losses, Francis sold the Republic to the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, a longtime rival paper supportive of the Republican Party, which closed it. History The Republican was founded by Joseph Charless in 1808 as the Missouri Gazette and Louisiana Advertiser, using the first printing press to be set up west of the Mississippi. Another source said the original name of the paper was Missouri Gazette, it was changed to Louisiana Gazette in 1809, and it returned to Missouri Gazette in 1818.Joseph A. Dacus and William Buel, A Tour of St. Louis; or, the Inside Life of a Great City Charless's prospectus for the weekly newspaper said, in part: > . . . we conceive it unnecessary to offer anything like professions to the > public, but rather let the columns of the GAZETTE speak for themselves, and > the print live or die by the character it may acquire, but its intended > Patrons have a right to be acquainted with the grounds upon which their > approbation is solicited.Walter Barlow Stevens, The Fourth City, 1764-1911,\\" > volume 1] Three columns of the paper were to be reserved for news in French. The printing press came from Philadelphia, and the type from Louisville, Kentucky, but the only paper available in St. Louis measured just 8x12 inches, so that was the size used for the first issue, on July 12, 1808. There were 170 subscribers. > The first printer to work in the West was a Mr. Hinkle, who set up the first > form of the Gazette in a little one-story building on Main Street . . . . > the inking of the forms, as well as operating the press, was a task to be > performed by hand. The old Ramage press . . . served to supply the public > with their newspaper until 1827. The Gazette hired the first staff correspondent for St. Louis newspaper, Henry M. Breckenridge, who wrote \\"descriptive letters\\" along the Missouri River. In 1820, Charless sold the Gazette, with its one thousand subscribers, to James C. Cummins, who had recently arrived from Pittsburgh. The latter held the paper for just 18 months and in 1822 sold it to Edward Charless, the oldest son of the founder, who changed its name to Missouri Republican. Joseph (or Josiah) Spalding of Connecticut was made editor and partner. Nathaniel Paschall became an apprentice printer in 1813 and became associated with Charless in March 1818. He eventually became the editor. George Knapp was another important figure in Republican history who began as an apprentice, in 1827. The Republican became a daily newspaper in 1836. In July 1837, Charless and Paschall sold the concern to A.B. Chambers, Oliver Harris and George Knapp. Harris withdrew in August 1839, and the paper continued under Chambers and Knapp. In January 1840 Joseph W. Dougherty became a proprietor, but he left after a brief time. Chambers died on May 22, 1854, and George Knapp became sole owner a year later. In August 1854, Nathaniel Paschall and John Knapp were admitted as partners. Paschall died in 1866, and William Hyde, who had been hired as a reporter in 1857, was promoted to editor. Politics In 1856, the Republican supported James Buchanan for President of the United States. It was Democratic in politics, but vigorously opposed to secession. After the election of Abraham Lincoln, it did not support his administration in many measures. Under Andrew Johnson, the Republican advocated a \\"passive policy\\" or \\"possum policy\\" for Democrats, with the support of Carl Schurz and his Westliche Post. In practice, the publishers of the two newspapers conducted a national convention of Liberal Republicans which met in Cincinnati, Ohio, and nominated Horace Greeley and Brown. The Republican was instrumental in establishing a state lottery in 1871, and it succeeded in bringing the 1876 Democratic National Convention to St. Louis. In 1873, it propounded its political stand as > a fearless and independent advocate [of Liberal Democratic principles. It > is bound, however, by no ties to the support of unworthy men, nor by party > discipline to any action it may deem unwise of impolitic. . . . It will > studiously strive, as in the past, to avoid sensational and prurient > journalism, and will without sacrificing spice and piquancy, aim to make > itself worthy of admission into the purest circles. . . .

The firm then moved into a new, five-story building, plus basement, which had just been completed. The basement held all the printing paper, two news presses, one an eight-cylinder and the other a four-cylinder. There were two engines and two boilers as well. The other stories were, on the first floor, the counting room, two large fireproof vaults, file and paper cases, and back copies of the Republican and Democrat; second floor, a job bindery and the office of the job department; third floor, editorial rooms and the job printing office; fourth, more of the job office, material and machinery; top floor, the news department, typesetting and makeup quarters, where some thirty-five printers, or \\"typos,\\" could work. The job department included the office and back shop of the Irish News. On the top of the building was a sheet-iron cutout of a raccoon, mounted on a pivot so it swung with the wind. Second fire and third building On the evening of May 24, 1870, the five-story Republican building on Chestnut Street between Second and Main streets was destroyed by fire. The supply of water was insufficient to throw water any higher than the second story of the four-floor building until mud was forced out of the pipes. \\"Terrible Conflagration,\\" Daily Democrat, St. Louis, May 25, 1870, image 4 > Managing Editor William Hyde rushed to his room to save the valuable books > in his library.

Crowds of spectators witnessed the debacle, emptying theaters to rush to see the intense flames engorge the building, which eventually collapsed. A four- cylinder Hoe press was saved, being protected in a fireproof vault. Only one day of publication was missed. A temporary building was constructed on the same site.

It is the earliest surviving example of a satirical play (or prahasana, one of the ten types of plays described in the treatise Natya Shastra) in Sanskrit literature.: \\"Bhagavadajjukam (Sanskrit) is the earliest available play-type called prahasana, in which comical situations, harmless humour and wit are dominant. In a couple of manuscripts the author is mentioned as Bodhayana.\\" Featuring witty exchanges, an episode about the transmigration of souls and a discussion on Hindu dharma, the comical play was intended to mock the doctrines of Buddhism, whose rise at the time presented a challenge to the dominance of Hinduism in India. Characters *Parivrajakamonk or master *Shandilyadisciple *Vasantsenacourtesan *Ramilakacourtesan's lover *Vidushakajester *A quack doctor *Yamaduta, messenger of the lord of death, Yamaraja Synopsis The play opens with a discussion on Hindu dharma between a master and a disciple, whose attention is drifting towards a woman in the nearby garden. As the discussion goes on, the woman is bitten by a snake and falls dead ‚Äì an act that deeply affects the disciple. To demonstrate his yogic power, the master transfers the disciple's soul into the woman's body, who then rises and continues the philosophical discussion. Translations The play was rediscovered in the early 20th century when it was first translated into Telugu in 1924 by Veturi Prabhakara Sastri, who then got it published in the Devanagri script through Vavilla Press in 1925.Foreword, Bodhayana's Bhagavadajjukam, Manimanjari Publications, Hyderabad, January 1986 In 1932, the play was translated into Italian, L'asceta transmutato in et√®ra, by the Indologist Ferdinando Belloni-Filippi. The first English translation of the play was published by the Dutch Indologist J. A. B. van Buitenen in the journal Mahfil (now Journal of South Asian Literature) in 1971 with the title The Hermit and the Harlot. Performance history In 1967, the play was directed in Hindi by Shanta Gandhi at the National School of Drama. It has often been adapted to be performed as Koodiyattam, a traditional performing art of Kerala. The play continues to be performed in many regional Indian languages. In 2011, Kavalam Narayana Panicker directed the play at the Ernakulam Town Hall in Kochi. Other recent productions were held in 2013, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020.

Sometimes referred to as the Blue Berets due to its role (and its similarities to the Armenian Airborne Forces), it solely specializes in peacekeeping in foreign countries as part of international initiatives. It is commanded by Major General Arthur Simonyan. In early 2016, Defence Minister Seyran Ohanyan said that he considers the brigade to be the \\"basis for the establishment of a professional army\\".https://artsakhpress.am/eng/news/38155/ History In July 2001, a memorandum on Armenian peacekeeping was signed at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York, being the catalyst for the formation of a peacekeeping unit. Captain Artak Tonoyan was appointed the first commander of the battalion.Armenian peacekeepers professionally fulfill their tasks at missions abroad The battalion was subsequently reformed into a brigade. In February 2004, the first group of Armenian peacekeepers (consisting of 34 soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Artem Avdalyan) were deployed to Kosovo for six months. In March 2008, the brigade was relocated to the former base of the Capital Regiment.https://newsarmenia.am/news/politics/arm1-20080322-41846775/ In 2016, its personnel carried the flags of the United States, Germany, Italy, Poland and Greece while taking part in the Independence Day parade on Republic Square. In November 2017, the unit opened a peacekeeping training center (known as the Zar Peacekeeping Area) in Zar. A women‚Äôs platoon was established that same year as part of the cooperation program between the unit and the United Nations Population Fund.http://www.hayzinvor.am/en/69333.html?fdx_switcher=true Participation in the Armenian Revolution In April 2018, it was reported that members of the brigade marched alongside anti-government forces in the 2018 Armenian revolution. The Armenian Defense Ministry condemned what it described as an illegal action, saying that \\"The harshest legal measures will be taken against the soldiers\\". Activities The first peacekeeping mission of the unit was in Kosovo, carried out as part of the Greek contingent in the town of Ferizaj. It left Kosovo in 2011 only to return in 2012,https://www.azatutyun.am/amp/24478025.html with its new garrison being stationed at a base of United States Army Europe.https://regionalpost.org/en/articles/ambassador-of-the-armenian- forces.html In January 2005, having received the consent of the National Assembly of Armenia, a group of 45 peacekeepers went to Iraq together with a Polish Army unit. In January 2010, forty peacekeepers went to Afghanistan in a mission carried out jointly with the Bundeswehr, serving in Kabul and Mazar-e- Sharif, and formerly in Kunduz. During the mission, an Armenian chapel was opened. Since December 2014, the brigade sent a platoon in Lebanon as part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. The brigade became the base of the Armenian contingent in Syria, a task force consisting of 83 medics, demining experts, force protection and other military personnel.

It is situated within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Little Big Chief Mountain is set ten miles northeast of Snoqualmie Pass on the crest of the Cascade Range. Precipitation runoff from the west side of the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie River, whereas the east side drains into tributaries of the Yakima River. The nearest higher peak is Summit Chief Mountain, to the southwest, and Chimney Rock is set to the southwest. The first ascent of this peak was made in August 1939 by Fred Beckey, Wayne Swift, Joe Barto, and Campbell Brooks.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. This mountain was named for Lorenz A. Nelson during the 1925 Mountaineers climb of Summit Chief Mountain. Nelson was a pioneering mountaineer who led first ascents of Mount Olympus, Mount Meany, and Chiwawa Mountain. Climate Little Big Chief Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The elevation range of this area is between about in the lower elevations to over on Mount Stuart. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

The series was first broadcast on TVB Jade in Hong Kong in 1990, and starred Francis Ng, Andy Tai Chi-wai, Fiona Leung, Josephine Lam, Sam Kam Kwok-wai, Lily Li and Yeung De- shi. =Synopsis= During the Zhonglong period of Emperor Zhongzong in the Tang Dynasty, the two imperial criminal detectives Pei Yi-fei (Francis Ng), Chun-Yu Zi-hong (Tai Chi-wei) are in charge of solving crimes on either side of the town. Both detectives rely on the female informant Sheung-Guan Jing-jing (Josephine Lam) for relevant information and tip-offs in criminal cases, however, she is in love with Pei Yi-fei and would often give him first preference. The two detectives also have a good friend in the doctor Song Hien (Sam Kam Kwok-wai) and seek his assistance in autopsies, poisons and treatments. When a mysterious woman Mak Gok-yi (Fiona Leung) arrives in the town and opens a wine bar and lounge, the three friends fall in love with her. Mak Gok-yi only shows interest in Pei Yi-fei, so Song Hien retreats but Chun- Yu Zi-hong continues to seek her affections. Chun-Yu Zi-hong grows angry, jealous and envious of Pei Yi-fei and seeks to destroy him. Pei Yi-fei‚Äôs younger sister Pei Ling (Yiu Cheng-ching) is in love with Chun-Yu Zi-hong and would not listen to her brother‚Äôs warnings about Chun-Yu Zi-hong. Song Hien assists the widow Tai Mu-lan (Betsy Cheung Fung-nei) and her young daughter, then begins a relationship with Mu-lan. Sheung-Guan Jing-jing meets Li Longji (Yeung De-shi) and the two become friends but she does not yet know he is the Emperor‚Äôs nephew and future emperor. Chun-Yu Zi-hong feels his detective career is not enough and schemes his way to the top ranks to work for Empress Wei (Lily Li).Empress Wei seizes power, poisons the Emperor and takes control of the dynasty. Li Longji plots to seize power from Empress Wei with help from Sheung-Guan Jing-jing, Pei Yi-fei, and Wu Kei (Cheng Yan-lai). As Li Longji is the new Emperor, Chun-Yu Zi-hong flees the palace to join the Ghost Gang led by the Golden Demon King (Yip Tin-hung). Chun-Yu Zi-hong continues to deal with Pei Yi-fei and kills Song Hien, and indirectly kills Pei Yi-fei‚Äòs sister Pei Ling.

It was written by Irving Adler, and published in 2012 by World Scientific. The Basic Library List Committee of the Mathematical Association of America has suggested its inclusion in undergraduate mathematics libraries. Background Irving Adler (1913‚Äì2012) was known as a peace protester, schoolteacher, and children's science book author before, in 1961, earning a doctorate in abstract algebra. Even later in his life, Adler began working on phyllotaxis, the mathematical structure of leaves on plant stems. This book, which collects several of his papers on the subject previously published in journals and edited volumes, is the last of his 85 books to be published before his death. Topics Different plants arrange their leaves differently, for instance on alternating sides of the plant stem, or rotated from each other by other fractions of a full rotation between consecutive leaves. In these patterns, rotations by 1/2 of an angle, 1/3 of an angle, 3/8 of an angle, or 5/8 of an angle are common, and it does not appear to be coincidental that the numerators and denominators of these fractions are all Fibonacci numbers. Higher Fibonacci numbers often appear in the number of spiral arms in the spiraling patterns of sunflower seed heads, or the helical patterns of pineapple cells. The theme of Adler's work in this area, in the papers reproduced in this volume, was to find a mathematical model for plant development that would explain these patterns and the occurrence of the Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio within them. The papers are arranged chronologically; they include four journal papers from the 1970s, another from the late 1990s, and a preface and book chapter also from the 1990s. Among them, the first is the longest, and reviewer Adhemar Bultheel calls it \\"the most fundamental\\"; it uses the idea of \\"contact pressure\\" to cause plant parts to maximize their distance from each other and maintain a consistent angle of divergence from each other, and makes connections with the mathematical theories of circle packing and space-filling curves. Subsequent papers refine this theory, make additional connections for instance to the theory of continued fractions, and provide a more general overview. Interspersed with the theoretical results in this area are historical asides discussing, among others, the work on phyllotaxis of Theophrastus (the first to study phyllotaxis), Leonardo da Vinci (the first to apply mathematics to phyllotaxis), Johannes Kepler (the first to recognize the importance of the Fibonacci numbers to phyllotaxis), and later naturalists and mathematicians. Audience and reception Reviewer Peter Ruane found the book gripping, writing that it can be read by a mathematically inclined reader with no background knowledge in phyllotaxis. He suggests, however, that it might be easier to read the papers in the reverse of their chronological order, as the broader overview papers were written later in this sequence. And Yuri V. Rogovchenko calls its publication \\"a thoughtful tribute to Dr. Adler‚Äôs multi- faceted career as a researcher, educator, political activist, and author\\".

In his obituary, the New York Times declared about him: \\"He was always ready to march, lend his name or send a telegram if there was a protest for disarmament or for a treaty on a nuclear test ban, or against racism in South Africa, radical injustice in America and United States policy in Vietnam\\". From Rabbi to pop star Feinberg was born in Bellaire, Ohio, the son of Ashkenazim (Yiddish-speaking Jews) immigrants from Grinkishki (modern Grinki≈°kis, Lithuania) in the Russian empire. Feinberg always called Grinkishki \\"the birthplace of my spirit\\" His parents often spoke to him about the shetl that they had left behind, and Feinberg stated that he felt that Grinkishki was a part of him. His father, Nathan was a rabbi while his mother, Sarah (n√©e Abramson) was a housewife. Another source describes Nathan Feinberg as a cantor and umbrella repair man who left the Russian empire for the United States. In his memoirs, Feinberg stated his parents moved to the United States in 1882. Feinberg was the 7th of the 10 children in his family. Bellaire was an impoverished coal-mining town located on the Ohio river across from Wheeling, West Virginia and Feinberg grew up in poverty. Feinberg found himself shocked by the mistreatment of the black residents of Bellaire when he was growing up. One day, he saw a young black boy known as Skeets being pelted with stones and garbage on the streets. When Skeets attempted to swim across the Ohio to escape his tormentors, he was hit on the head by a rock and drowned. Since Skeets was black, his death was written off by the authorities as of no importance. Feinberg's best friend as a child was Dude, the son of a black garbageman. His childhood experiences left him with a strong sympathy for Afro-Americans as fellow victims of prejudice, and throughout his life he was a champion of civil rights. An intellectual prodigy, Feinberg graduated from high school at the age of 14. After graduating, he went to work as a menial laborer while saving up enough money to attend university. Feinberg worked in a steel mill in Bellaire. Bellaire was a tough working class town where violence and heavy drinking were the norm, and Feinberg was hardened by his youth. Feinberg recalled about his youth: \\"Passion for the underdog still stirs me to indignation. I saw coal miners beaten on the streets because they demanded an union; I saw a black playmate drowned...stunned by rock-throwing rednecks yelling 'nigger!'\\". He was educated at the University of Cincinnati, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1920. In 1924, he was ordained a rabbi at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. Feinberg worked as a rabbi in a number of American cities between 1924 and 1930. Feinberg began his rabbinical career at Temple Beth-El in Niagara Falls, New York. In 1925, he moved to Wheeling to become the rabbi of Eoff Street Temple. In 1928, Feinberg became the rabbi at a New York synagogue, the Temple Israel, attended by a wealthy congregation, and he often went to parties and dinners hosted by New York's Jewish elite on exclusive Park Avenue. Temple Israel was the second largest Reform synagogue in New York. By his own admission, he found himself bored by the superficiality of upper-class life in New York, and found himself yearning for something more in life than attending one party after another. In 1964, Feinberg recalled: \\"Full of youthful idealism, I found myself increasingly disillusioned with the role I was expected to play ‚Äî more a promoter and social director of a complex organization than a pastor of human souls\\". On 27 February 1930, he announced in a sermon his resignation as a rabbi, saying: \\"The preacher today has been forced to renounce his mission and become a salesman. He is made to fear a loss in membership more than the wrath of God. Instead of a poet, a dreamer, a transcendent mystic, he distorts himself into a seeker after popularity, a clerk of pew rentals, a good fellow. Just as other men sell clothes or automobiles or stocks, so does he dispense religion‚Äîfor a price\\". In his sermon \\"Why I am Leaving the Professional Ministry\\", Feinberg stated \\"organized religion is a deserted lighthouse\\" that had left him spiritually numb. His resignation from a prestigious synagogue attended by some of the richest Jews in New York attracted much publicity at the time. In Moscow, Pravda put his resignation on the front page, portraying Feinberg's resignation as due to the soullessness of American capitalism in New York, though Feinberg insisted he was only rejecting organized religion, not Judaism as a faith. Joseph L. Lewis, president of the Freethinkers of America, invited Feinberg to join him on a \\"crusade for truth\\" against all religion, an offer he declined. Heywood Broun praised Feinberg's resignation as an act of principle. Two columns of newsprint in the New York Times were devoted to discussing Feinberg's resignation. Rabbi Jacob Kohn of New York's Temple Ansche Chesed called Feinberg a \\"young and immature, disillusioned idealist\\". Rabbi Kohn went on to say: \\"Rabbi Feinberg is an idealist, and his remarks were those of an idealist, and when he refers to commercialism in organized religion, his remarks are the remarks of the disillusioned idealist. He was premature. He should have remembered that it is not fair to condemn the religious institution as a whole because some human errors had upset his inspiration. It would be just as unfair to condemn the entire judicial system of a nation because one magistrate had yielded to corruption\\". Feinberg then went to France, where he studied singing at the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau for a few months. Upon his return to New York, he announced his intention to have a career in show business. On 4 November 1930, he married Ruth E. Katsh in New York. Feinberg sang under the Gentile-sounding stage name Anthony Frome. From 1932 to 1935, he hosted a popular radio music show in New York, where he was known as the \\"Poet Prince of the Air Waves\\". Feinberg's radio career began at WMCA radio station, but he was soon promoted up to WOR, a station with a more powerful radio broadcaster that covered much of the northeast of the United States. By 1932, Feinberg was being paid $1, 500 dollars per week, a substantial sum in the Great Depression. Feinberg believed that much of the success of his radio show was due to the fact that starting in 1933 it always aired right after President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave his weekly \\"fireside chats\\" on the radio. His persona was that of a \\"vagabond prince\\" who would \\"visit\\" a different country every radio show and sing love songs in whatever language of the nation he was pretending to visit (Feinberg was fluent in six languages). Feinberg was described as having a \\"melodious baritone\\" voice. Feinberg's mother disapproved of his change of career, telling her son on her deathbed in Yiddish: \\"Abelch, mein zoon, a rov, a rov! Yetzt gevoren a zinger, a gornit!\\" (\\"Abe, my son, a rabbi, a rabbi! Now's he become a singer, a nothing!\\"). Feinberg as Frome was photographed dressed in an expensive smoking robe and slippers in what the newspapers called \\"his 40-foot living room, lined with portraits in oil and precious first editions\\", giving the impression of a man who lived a life of decadence and luxury. In his 1964 memoir Storm the Gates of Jericho, Feinberg recalled that his image was remade as follows: > \\"One NBC publicity luminary disagreed with the ‚Äúsinging rabbi‚Äù approach. > \\"What female in Omaha or Patchogue would weave her fantasy sex-fulfillment > around a rabbi?‚Äù he demanded. ‚ÄúThey think of a rabbi as an old man with a > long beard!‚Äù So this unromantic image must be countered by letting the fans > see what I looked like. Soon a photograph streamed from the publicity mill ‚Äî > wavy-haired, broodingly dark but serenely poetic, in dressing gown, smoking > a pipe and reading in the library of his palatial apartment.\\" Newspapers stories in the 1930s portrayed him as an eccentric who never sang without the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayy√°m in his pocket, that he spent vast sums of money on buying clothing, that he was planning to build a castle in the Berkshires, and that he had an obsession with barrel organs. A handsome man, Feinberg appeared on the cover of Radio Guide and was labelled \\"a romantic idealist\\" who was looking the world over for the right girl to marry. The man that Feinberg was already married was kept a secret to make him more appealing to his female fans. A fan club consisting mostly of young women known as the \\"court of the poet prince\\" emerged, and Feinberg sang at New York's Fox and Paramount Theaters. He noted with amusement that his fans, unaware that he was Jewish, always sent him Christmas cards. Feinberg recalled about his singing career: > \\"My repertoire ran the gamut from the products of flash-in-the-pan tunesters > who were pounding out romance for Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee, to Victor > Herbert and Stephen Foster: from Richard Rodgers, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter > and No√´l Coward to Schubert, Puccini and Verdi: from Valentina, Siboney, La > Cucaracha and The Night Was Made for Love to The Rosary and Kol Nidrei, from > tender lullabies to sombre lyrics of passion in every tongue. But always it > must be \\"from person to person, from heart to heart.‚Äù I faced the cold > metallic microphone and tried to concentrate on somebody I loved ‚Äî Mom or > Ruth, depending on the type of love I was trying to project\\". Tikkun olam: The activist Rabbi  By 1935, he was sufficiently troubled by Nazi Germany to end his career as a singer and returned to working as a rabbi. Feinberg later stated that in view of what was happening in Germany that he could not be a singer and had to return to the service of God. Feinberg stated in 1950 about his return to religion: \\"I began thinking about what was going to happen to the Jews and I knew that there was only one thing for me to do‚ÄîI had to go back to the rabbinate. That was, and is, where I belong. Singing is only amusement. My soul is in the pulpit and in the study.\\" In 1935, he became the rabbi of Mount Neboh Temple, a small synagogue located in a poor neighborhood of New York. Mount Nehob was so poor the synagogue had been lacking a rabbi for some time as most rabbis did not wished to accept the low salary the synagogue offered, but Feinberg accepted the position as he wanted to be close to the poor. Feinberg's principle worry was the Third Reich, and from 1935 onward, he sought to build alliances outside of the Jewish community to rally a front against the Nazi regime. In 1938, he moved to Denver, Colorado to become the rabbi of Temple Emanuel. In 1942, Feinberg attempted to volunteer as a chaplain with the U.S Army, but was turned down on the account of a medical disability.\\" In 1943, he accepted an offer to become the rabbi at Holy Blossom Temple in Toronto, the most prestigious Reform synagogue in Canada. Feinberg arrived in Toronto in November 1943. By that time, the 1st Canadian Corps was fighting in Italy, and he later remembered that he arrived to find a nation that was engrossed in the war. Through the full dimensions of the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\" were not known in North America at the time, Feinberg knew enough about what was happening to the Jews of Europe. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the war, urging Canadians to never slacken in the war against the 3rd Reich, and urged able-bodied Jewish men to enlist in the military as \\"active\\" members. An extremely charismatic man and an excellent speaker, Feinberg soon became the best known rabbi in Canada, who hosted a weekly radio show where he spoke about various political and social issues. Feinberg often wrote about social issues in publications such as the Globe and Mail, Saturday Night, Maclean's, and the Toronto Star. Despite living much of his life in Canada and being very involved in Canadian issues, Feinberg always remained an American citizen. A great believer in the prophetic values of Reform Judaism, Feinberg took the notion of tikkun olam (\\"repairing the world\\") as requiring him to speak out against all forms of prejudice. Feinberg condemned not only antisemitism in Canada, but also criticized the Liberal Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, for interning the entire Japanese-Canadian population in 1942. The internment of the Japanese-Canadians greatly offended Feinberg's sense of justice and in one of very first sermons at Holy Blossom he excoriated Mackenzie King for locking up an ethnic group without even trials on the mere suspicion of treason. Mackenzie King had interned the Japanese-Canadians despite being told by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) that the majority were loyal to Canada largely because of a massive racist hysteria which led him to fear his Liberal Party would lose the next election if he did not intern. As the internment of the Japanese-Canadians was very popular at the time, Feinbrg's sermons criticizing the internment caused much controversy, making the beginning of his rise to become Canada's most famous rabbi. He was the chairman the Joint Public Relations Committee of the Canadian Jewish Congress and B'nai B'rith, who pressed the committee to lobby Ontario to end mandatory Christian prayers and the singing of Christmas carols in Ontario's public schools. During his time as chairman, which lasted until 1950, Feinberg pressed the Joint Public Relations Committee to take a more confrontational approach and to take up the cause of other groups such as Asian-Canadians and black Canadians. The Canadian historian Gerald Tulchinsky wrote that Feinberg had little interest in Jewish theology, but instead saw himself as a champion of all oppressed peoples, seeing himself as an advocate of a \\"Jewish social gospel\\" that required him to fight for justice and dignity for all. The Canadian press often called Feinberg the \\"red rabbi\\". In Easter 1944, Feinberg gave a speech in Toronto saying: > \\"A surprising large number of scholars regards the stigma on Jews as the > alleged murderers of Christ to be the underlying cause of anti-Semitism. > Taught in Sunday Schools, it becomes an integral part of the sub-conscious > mental inheritance and intrudes on every judgement...In recognition of this > danger, as an obligation to truth and because of the need to establish a > common groundwork for mutual fellowship in youth first of all, a group of > 155 Protestant ministers in the United States last year agreed to revise the > text-books now used in Christian Sunday Schools, in order to expunge hatred- > inciting, unauthentic and prejudiced accounts of the Jewish roles in the > crucifixion. A commission to change these books is now in order. God proper > its labors!\\". Feinberg further wrote \\"the documentary basis for the charge that Jews caused the death of Jesus can be only found in one of the four Gospels...the Gospel of St. John, which students universally consider the least reliable and the one written after the longest interval\\". Feinberg's speech caused much controversy with the Social Credit MP Norman Jaques distorting his speech to claim that Feinberg had called the New Testament a fraud. Jaques claimed: \\"So the Christian Gospels now are labelled 'unreliable' and 'unauthentic'-untrue, while St. John is named as anti-semite\\". Jaques claimed that\\" \\"our remains a Christian nation, guided and inspired by Christian ideals\\" while also saying that nearly the entire Jewish community were members of the Canadian Communist Party. Thus in this way, Jaques claimed that Jews raise the \\"bogey of anti- semitism\\" as a \\"Communist smokescreen\\". In 1944, the Conservative government of Premier George A. Drew announced as of September of that year, \\"instruction in the tenets of the Christian faith\\" would be mandatory in all Ontario's public schools. Feinberg led the opposition to Drew's changes in education, saying it was \\"undemocratic, imperiling the separation of Church and State, and leading to disunity in society\\". However, when Claris Silcox of the United Church of Canada who supported Drew challenged Feinberg to a debate on the subject, he declined under grounds that the subject was \\"too hot\\", a tacit admission that public opinion in Ontario was solidly behind the government. In his first summer in Canada, Feinberg and his wife attempted to rent a cottage in the Ontario countryside, only to be repeatedly told by the owners of the cottages that they did not rent to Jews or alternatively it was not legally possible to rent to them because local by-laws forbade renting residential property to Jews. In 1944, Feinberg joined the advisory board of the Toronto Progressive Labour Party, which was a front for the Canadian Communist Party, causing the RCMP to begin monitoring him as a possible Soviet spy. In 1945 Feinberg attended a fundraising dinner for the United Jewish People's Order, a left-wing group linked to the Canadian Communist Party, which led to further suspicions by the RCMP that Feinberg was at very least a Communist. In 1945, Feinberg wrote an article in Maclean's charging that there was rampant antisemitism in Canada, writing: > \\"Jews are kept out of most ski clubs. Sundry summer colonies (even on > municipally owned land), fraternities, and at least one Rotary Club operate > under written or unwritten ‚ÄúGentiles Only‚Äù signs. Many bank positions are > not open to Jews. Only three Jewish male physicians have been admitted to > non-Jewish Hospital staffs in Toronto. McGill University has instituted a > rule requiring in effect at least a 10% higher academic average for Jewish > applicants; in certain schools of the University of Toronto anti-Jewish bias > is being felt. City Councils debate whether Jewish petitioners should be > permitted to build a synagogue; property deeds in some areas bar resale to > them. I have seen crude handbills circulated thanking Hitler for his > massacre of 80,000 Jews in Kiev.\\" In 1945, he was the inspiration behind a legal challenge to the \\"restrictive covenants\\" that forbade the selling or renting of property to Jews by supporting the Re Drummond Wren case. In a calculated risk, a Jewish group, the Workers' Education Association (WEA) had purchased a property in Toronto known to have a \\"restrictive covenant\\" in order to build a home for veterans of World War Two. Only after construction was well under way was it announced that the property had a \\"restrictive covenant\\" and was thus illegal as the WEA was a Jewish group. The historian Philip Giarad observed the Drummond Wren case appeared to have been a set-up as the WEA should had known the property had a \\"restrictive covenant\\", and the case appears to have been launched to take advantage of a moment when public opinion was much more sympathetic towards Jews. In April‚ÄìMay 1945, the last of the death camps and concentration camps of Nazi Germany had been liberated, and newsreel footage of emaciated Holocaust survivors had suddenly made antisemitism unfashionable. On 31 October 1945, Justice John Keiller MacKay ruled against the \\"restrictive covenant\\" laws as a violation of the law in the Drummond Wren case. In a pamphlet he printed praising MacKay's ruling, Feinberg wrote: \\"It clothes in concrete reality, for specific cases, the universally acclaimed principles for which World World Two was pursued to a victorious end\\". In February 1947, Feinberg was part of a Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) delegation who met Social Credit Party leaders in Ottawa to ask them to purge their party of its vocal anti-Semitic wing. In the aftermath of the Holocaust, there was a \\"Never Again!\\" attitude in the Canadian Jewish community and there was a feeling that antisemitism must not be tolerated in any form. At the meeting in Ottawa, the CJC delegation complained that the Social Credit French language newspaper Vers Demain had been printing extracts from The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion and in general the newspaper was very hostile towards Jews. The meeting did not yield positive results. Feinberg attended later in 1947 a meeting of the CJC leaders that concluded that the Social Credit movement, whose support was mostly found in western Canada and in Quebec, was the most dangerous anti-Semitic movement in Canada, and the CJC should do everything within its power to discredit Social Credit. At the same summit of the CJC leaders, Feinberg argued that all racism must be fought, not just antisemitism, saying: \\"The French-speaking Catholic in Ontario, the Japanese deportee from British Columbia, the Negro economic pariah are no less a Jewish obligation than we are a moral crisis for the Christian\\". At a meeting in late 1947, Charles Daley, the Ontario minister of labour dismissively told Feinberg \\"that these days, racial discrimination is to a great extent imaginary.\\" A supporter of Zionism, when on 6 December 1947, the United Nations declared that the Palestine Mandate would be partitioned into an Arab state and a Jewish state, Feinberg put on a pageant at Holy Blossom starring the children of his congregation in celebration. The pageant portrayed \\"2, 000 years of pogroms, antisemitism and travails\\", ending in with Israel being declared. Concerned that the Jews might be accused of having dual loyalties, at the same time Feinberg told the Globe & Mail: \\"Palestine has always been the center of our pristine Jewish culture and faith and the shrine of our sacred memory. Canada, however, remains the soil on which young Canadian Jewry has been born\\". In 1948, Feinberg attended a conference of the World Jewish Congress in Paris, where he criticized Canadian immigration law for excluding Jewish nurses and domestic workers from coming to Canada. His criticism of Canadian immigration law with the implication that the government of Canada was anti- semitic caused much controversy. Most of all, Feinberg championed the cause of Canadian blacks, lobbying successive premiers of Ontario to end prejudices against blacks in employment and housing. Feinberg became the vice president of the Toronto Association for Civil Rights. Feinberg's social activism made him not only the famous rabbi in Toronto, but also one of the most famous rabbis in the world. Holy Blossom Temple in Toronto. Feinberg served as the rabbi of Holy Blossom from 1943 to 1961 In 1948, MacKay's ruling in the Drummond Wren case was struck down in the Noble v Alley case by the Ontario Superior Court of Appeal, which ruled that \\"restrictive covenants\\" were \\"legal and enforceable\\". The Noble case had been started when a woman named Anna Noble tried to sell her cottage at the Beach O' Pines resort to a Jewish businessman, Bernard Wolf, only to be blocked by the Beach O'Pines Resort Association which had a \\"restrictive covenant\\" forbidding the sale of cottages to any person of \\"Jewish, Hebrew, Semitic, Negro or colored race or blood\\". At the time, a heartbroken Feinberg told the media that the ruling in the Noble case was \\"a blow to the prestige and mature development of Canada\\". However, with the support of the Joint Committee, the Noble ruling was appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which struck down \\"restrictive covenants\\" in November 1950. In 1949, Feinberg met Leslie Frost, the Conservative Premier of Ontario, to press him for pass laws ending discrimination against minorities, saying: \\"It is a sham to attempt to defend Western democracy against Communism if a man or a woman is prevented from getting a job because of discrimination against race, religion or color\\". Such lobbying had its effect, and Frost's government passed several acts such as Fair Employment Act of 1951 and the Fair Accommodations Acts of 1954 making it illegal to discriminate on racial or religious grounds. Even before the Supreme Court had struck down \\"restrictive covenants\\" for all of Canada, the Frost government had passed a law forbidding \\"restrictive covenants\\". In 1950, Dorothy Sangster wrote in Macleans' about him: \\"Today American-born Rabbi Feinberg is one of the most controversial figures to occupy a Canadian pulpit. Gentiles recognize him as the official voice of Canadian Jewry. This fact was aptly demonstrated a few years ago when Montreal's Mayor Houde introduced him to friends as Le Cardinal des Juifs‚Äîthe Cardinal of the Jews\\". As part of his social activism, Feinberg allowed a Chinese-Canadian, a Japanese-Canadian, an Indian Hindu man, and a black man named William Carter to speak before Holy Blossom about their experiences of discrimination in Canada. The town of Dresden, Ontario was notorious as being the most segregated town in Canada, and Feinberg was active in campaigning to end the discrimination suffered by the black residents of Dresden. Carter was from Dresden, and Feinberg usually stayed with his family when he was in Dresden. Working closely with the Negro Citizenship Association, Feinberg's Joint Labor Committee led demonstrations against businesses that refused to hire blacks or admit black customers. In December 1950, Feinberg set off a notable row in Toronto when he delivered a sermon denouncing as an injustice that Jewish children in public schools were being forced to sing Christmas carols. Three Orthodox rabbis in a public letter denounced Feinberg's sermon, saying that Canada was a \\"Christian country\\" and Jews should respect the wishes of the majority least it give rise to antisemitism. Various Christian clergymen then started to denounce Feinberg's sermon, which was widely misrepresented as calling for an end to Christmas and the singing of all Christmas carols. The Globe and Mail in an editorial on 5 December 1950 entitled \\"A Deplorable Proposal\\" condemned Feinberg, asking how it was possible for a rabbi to want \\"to eliminate Christmas from public schools\\". Feinberg's attempts to argue that he had not called for ending Christmas, just merely having Jewish children being forced to sing Christmas carols, were completely ineffective. With public opinion firmly against him as the man who allegedly wanted to end Christmas, Feinberg abandoned his efforts. In a poll in 1951 taken by Saturday Night magazine, Feinberg was named of one Canada's 7 Greatest Preachers. In 1955-56, Feinberg supported the effort to ban the 1899 book Little Black Sambo from Toronto's public schools following the complaint of a black man, Daniel ‚ÄúDanny‚Äù Braithwaite, that watching a cartoon version of Little Black Sambo had traumatised his six-year old son. In a sermon, Feinberg stated: \\"Little Black Sambo in the public schools encouraged race prejudice by creating a pattern of Negro minstrel show comicality in the minds of white children, and by arousing a sense of persecution and emotional insecurity in colored children. Neither potential arrogance nor an inferiority complex is a proper seed-bed for Canadian citizenship.\\" Feinberg continued to be a supporter of Zionism, and engaged in debates with the United Church of Canada over the issue. After the Observer, the journal of the United Church, had published a pro-Palestinian article by Claris Silcox saying the establishment of Israel in 1948 had been an outrage, Feinberg asked for and was allowed to publish a rebuttal article in the next edition of the Observer. In his article, Feinberg wrote the \\"recreation of a sovereign secure homeland in Palestine for the Jews...has been since the dispersion an inextricable part of a sacred Messianic hope at the core of Judaism\\". Feinberg observed that it was President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt who was threatening in his speeches to wipe Israel off the face of the world while the Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion was making no such threats about Egypt. Feinberg accused Nasser of having \\"Hitler-like dreams\\" about Jews. He wrote that he felt sad about the suffering of the Palestinian refugees, but he also stated that there were hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees who were expelled or fled from Arab nations such as Egypt, Iraq, and Yemen living in Israel, which did not excite the passion of the Observer in same way that Palestinian refugees did. Feinberg concluded the best solution to the Israeli-Palestinian dispute would be an inter-faith dialogue about the status of the Holy Land between Christian, Jewish and Muslim religious leaders. In 1957, Feinberg became the first rabbi to receive an honorary degree from the University of Toronto. Feinberg also protested against the nuclear arms race of the Cold War, and became president of the Toronto Committee for Disarmament. A colorful character, Feinberg's liberal views on social issues such as legalizing abortion and a frank acceptance of human sexuality as normal made him very controversial. His activism led the Canadian government to regard him as a trouble-maker and during his time as rabbi of Holy Blossom from 1943 to 1961, he was spied upon by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) as a \\"subversive\\". The Singing Rabbi In 1961, Feinberg retired and was granted the title of rabbi emeritus. Feinberg's retirement was caused by an eye ailment. After his retirement, he became involved in the civil rights movement and in protesting against the Vietnam war. Feinberg continued criticize Canadian immigration laws. Feinberg noted Canada welcomed all Hungarian refugees because they were white and anti- communist, despite the fact that many of them had health problems, while turning away healthy immigrants from the West Indies, despite that fact the former British colonies in the Caribbean were members of the Commonwealth \\"family\\". In July 1964, when the Lion's Club of Toronto invited the white supremacist governor of Alabama, George Wallace, to give a lecture on race relations, Feinberg was the principle organizer of the protests against Wallace coming to Toronto. Feinberg asked to meet the Lion's club's leaders to press them to reconsider, but was refused. In a public letter to the Lion's Club, Feinberg asked for the club to \\"stand up and be counted at this crossroads in the history of man\\" by withdrawing the invitation. The invitation was not withdrawn, and on 8 July 1964 Wallace spoke to the Lion's Club of Toronto, arguing that segregation in Alabama was good for both blacks and whites. The same day, Feinberg was a lead speaker at a protest rally outside the Lion's Club, saying \\"Governor Wallace has carved a political career out of contempt for human beings, and we owe more courtesy to the Negro members of our community than we owe a second-hand guest\\". In September 1964, Maclean's published an article by Feinberg urging inter-racial marriage as the solution to race conflict, writing: \\"We support the civil rights movement in the U. S.; we insist that the color of a man‚Äôs skin shouldn‚Äôt deprive him of the right to a cup of coffee or a seat in a theatre; some enthusiasts even picket southern segregationists when they visit Canada, and most Canadians, I think, support the sentiments of such demonstrators. Yet for all our protestations to the contrary, we seldom act as though all races were equal. Most Canadians who talk equality have seldom been on close terms with a Negro...And many of the most enlightened of us would, in all honesty, have to answer ‚Äúno‚Äù when confronted with the old question that segregationists always use to clinch an argument: ‚ÄúWould you want your sister to marry one?‚Äù This ‚Äúno,‚Äù this refusal to sanction the mixing of the races, is the final bastion of race hostility. Until we learn to fight our ingrown fears of sexual relations between the races, the end of the race problem will not be in sight.\\" Feinberg argued that the government of Canada should \\"encourage\\" inter-racial marriage and relationships as the best way to end all racism in Canada. Feinberg argued against the theory of innate racial characteristics, stating: \\"I can‚Äôt accept this notion, because the astonishing ability of human groups to change their ‚Äúinnate‚Äù characteristics has been demonstrated time and time again. It was the Russians, forty years ago a nation of illiterate peasants, who launched the first astronauts [cosmonauts]; the ‚Äúheathen Chinese‚Äù will soon develop their own atomic bomb. Even the warlike Fiji Islanders, who barbecued their last missionary eight decades ago, are now, according to Saturday Review editor Norman Cousins, the most warmhearted, generous and trusting of human tribes\\". Feinberg argued that through people of different races look different, but there was no evidence that any race was inferior, arguing that low results on aptitude tests achieved by blacks and First Nations peoples were due to an \\"environment\\" that discouraged intellectual achievement, instead of being hereditary. Feinberg wrote: \\"In some Southern states, however, and in South Africa, sexual relations between persons of different races are proscribed by law; to me, this fact underlines the close connection between the fear of mixed marriages and the humiliation of full-scale segregation. As a Jew, I believe that, such proscriptions are every bit as shameful as Hitler‚Äôs Nuremburg laws, which forbade physical love between Aryans and Jews\\". Feinberg argued that as long as people refused to marry people of different races, racism would persist. Feinberg condemned the Vietnam War as \\"immoral\\", saying that in all good conscience he must speak out against the war. Feinberg's anti-war activism led to his speeches being heckled; receiving death threats on his phone and in the mail; and for a popular pamphlet, The Red Rabbi, accusing him of being a Communist being published. In January 1967, he visited Hanoi to meet Ho Chi Minh as part of a peace mission to protest the Vietnam war. Ho disliked meeting Westerners and it was most unusual that Feinberg was allowed to meet him. Feinberg called Ho this \\"paragon of durability impervious to events\\", who spoke to him in French and told him he was convinced that North Vietnam would win. Feinberg spent 10 days in Hanoi with a Presbyterian minister, the Reverend A. J. Muste, and the South African Anglican bishop, Ambrose Reeves. In a joint statement, the three clergymen condemned Operation Rolling Thunder, the American strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam as both ineffective and a war crime. The statement claimed that the North Vietnamese people \\"could not be terrorized\\" into submission and predicated that Rolling Thunder was destined to fail. The statement accused President Lyndon Johnson of violating both the United Nations charter and the Geneva Accords. On his way back to Toronto, Feinberg stopped in London to give a press conference, where he stated that Ho had told him that he was willing to meet Johnson in Hanoi to discuss peace \\"but without a gun at his hip\\". The latter was a reference to Ho's demand that the United States unconditionally stop the bombing of North Vietnam before peace could be discussed. The press conference in London with the dramatic offer of a summit between Ho and Johnson attracted much media attention, making the cover of the New York Times. His trip to North Vietnam was recounted in his 1968 book Rabbi Feinberg's Hanoi Diary. In his Hanoi Diary, Feinberg denounced the \\"court Jews\\" who counselled President Johnson along hawkish lines such as his namesake Abraham Feinberg (no relation), Walt Whitman Rostow and Abraham Fortas as distorting Judaism. On 26 January 1967, Feinberg met in New York with Arthur Goldberg, the American ambassador to the United Nations, to ask if it was possible to set up a Ho-Johnson summit. Goldberg told the amateur diplomat Feinberg that it was a serious violation of diplomatic protocol for him to announce the offer of a summit in London without informing Johnson first, saying the president was very angry at him. Feinberg dictated Ho's offer to Goldberg's secretary, who typed it down along with a profuse apology for having broken diplomatic protocol. Goldberg who was scheduled to meet Johnson the next day promised Feinberg he would take along the offer with him for the president to consider. However, Johnson was not prepared to end the bombing of North Vietnam, and without that precondition being met first, the prospect of a Ho-Johnson summit ended. By 1967, Feinberg had emerged as the chairman of Vietnam Coordinating Committee in Toronto that organized protests against the war and pressed the Canadian government to grant asylum to American draft-dodgers who had fled to Canada. In 1967, an article by Feinberg recounting his recent visit to Moscow in October 1966 was published in the Globe & Mail, which was entered into Congressional Record by the Republican Senator Jacob Javits, as illustrating the current state of Soviet Jewry. Feinberg praised the Soviet Union as an improvement over Imperial Russia, saying the \\"evil stench of the czars\\" was gone, but he criticized the treatment of Soviet Jews as being very far from equal. Feinberg and his wife attended the Simchat Torah celebrations at Moscow's only synagogue, which he described as being attended by 15, 000 Soviet Jews singing joyously in Hebrew and Yiddish in the streets. Feinberg reported almost all of the older male Jews were World War Two veterans who proudly wore their Red Army medals and that many were horribly wounded, missing limbs such as their arms and/or legs. He further reported that all of the Muscovite Jews he talked to expressed their gratitude to the Red Army for defeating Nazi Germany, observing that if the Wehrmacht had taken Moscow in 1941, then the Jews of Moscow would had been exterminated just like the Jews of Kiev, Smolensk, Odessa, Kishinev, Sevastopol, Minsk and so many other Soviet cities taken by the Germans had been exterminated. Feinberg wrote the \\"heroic\\" Red Army soldiers who defeated Nazi Germany had saved the entire Soviet Jewish community from being exterminated during the Holocaust, making him grateful for the sacrifices of the ordinary soldiers of the Red Army, who fought so hard and suffered so much. But at the same time, Feinberg criticized Joseph Stalin for having \\"murdered, among others, thousands of alien, cosmopolitan, intellectual Jews\\" after 1945. Feinberg wrote that many of the older Muscovite Jews told him that they still had nightmares of the postwar anti-Semitic purges. He noted that the assimilation policies of the Soviet regime was having its effects with the younger Soviet Jews speaking Russian instead of Yiddish, and the distinctive culture of the Ashkenazim was being subsumed into Russian culture. Feinberg quoted the statistic that 70% of Soviet Jews gave their first language as Yiddish in the 1926 census, but only 18% did so in the 1959 census. Feinberg, who was fluent in Yiddish, but did not speak Russian, reported he had to use translators to speak to the younger Soviet Jews. Feinberg wrote that he had an \\"affectionate admiration for the Russian people\\", which made the barely veiled anti-Semitic remarks he heard from Soviet officials even more painful. Feinberg accused the Soviet regime of seeking to \\"obliterate every trance of a Jewish identity\\", and reported that almost all of the Jews he spoke to were living through lives of \\"tensions, deprivation and confusion\\". Feinberg called Birobidzhan, the Soviet Jewish \\"homeland\\" located in the desolate countryside along the banks of the Amur river that formed the border with China as being a sort of cruel joke. Feinberg wrote that \\"governmental indifference and intimidation\\" was bearing down hard on Soviet Jews. Feinberg wrote that it not been possible to publish the Tanakh in the Soviet Union since 1926 and the \\"entire network of Jewish cultural institutions, which existed before the war, is gone; the extensive Yiddish publishing structure is shattered, the once world-renowned Moscow Jewish Theater is a ghostly memory. The Jewish cultural scene is a wasteland wherein comic relief was provided by a troupe of travelling singers and a tri-weekly newspaper in Birobidjan with a 1, 000 circulation\\". Feinberg criticized the Cold War, writing that tensions with the Western powers, especially the support for West German rearmament given by the United States, hindered the case for liberalization in the Soviet Union. Feinberg wrote that a nuclear war between the United States vs. the Soviet Union or between China vs. the Soviet Union would be a disaster for humanity and world leaders needed to do more to reduce Cold War tensions. Finally, Feinberg called upon the Soviet Union to allow unrestricted Jewish emigration to Israel, saying that those Jews who wanted to make the Aliyah should be allowed to do so. After the Six Day War of 1967, a United Church leader, the Reverend Ernest Marshall Howse, published an article \\"Who Should Control Jerusalem?\\" arguing that the Israel had no claim to any of Jerusalem, a city which he wrote which had been \\"guarded and protected\\" by Palestinians for 1, 300 years. Howse's claim that Jerusalem was not a sacred and holy city for Jews caused a strong response, and he had a public debate with Feinberg over the issue. Howse's thesis that the Talmud and all Zionist literature were a form of anti-Gentile \\"hate literature\\" caused Feinberg to say that according to Howse's logic, Jews \\"must remain rejected and wander like Cain\\". Against Howse's claims that rabbis should be imprisoned for preaching hatred of Gentiles under the grounds that anti-Gentilism was the core of Judaism led Feinberg to say that Howse's devotion to Christianity made him into a natural anti-semite. Besides for the status of Jerusalem, Howse and Feinberg clashed over the origins of the Holocaust. Howse stated that there was no connection between Christianity and the v√∂lkisch racism, portraying both Nazi Germany and the \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\" as \\"freakish aberrations\\" of the West, contenting that Western Christian civilization was naturally against phenomena such as genocide. Contra Howse, Feinberg argued that v√∂lkisch racism owned much to Christian antisemitism. In 1969, Feinberg went to Montreal to join John Lennon and Yoko Ono in their \\"Bed In For Peace\\". A singer with fine voice, Feinberg joined Lennon and Ono in singing Give Peace a Chance. Feinberg suggested some changes to the lyrics of Give Peace A Chance, which were incorporated by Lennon. The Montreal Gazette in its edition of 30 May 1969 credited Feinberg with coining the title of the song. The \\"rabbi\\" mentioned in Give Peace A Peace is Feinberg. At the time, Feinberg told The Montreal Gazette that he had gone to join the \\"Bed-In\\" out of admiration for Lennon, saying \\"he is one of the most powerful influences in the modern world, and I feel he is doing a phenomenal thing for peace.\\" Feinberg was described having bonded with Lennon, forming an instant friendship. In 1967, Ho had given Feinberg a walking cane with an Asian dragon craved as its head as a parting gift, which Feinberg almost gave to Lennon as a gift, but decided it would be insult to Ho to give away his Vietnamese cane. When Feinberg said he could barely keep time with modern music, Ono told him: \\"That doesn't matter. You're God's child, and any sound that comes out of you is beautiful.\\" About the charge that it was undignified for a rabbi to associate with Lennon and Ono, Feinberg told The Montreal Gazette: \\"I'm not interested in what people say about dignity. I don't worship respectability. I feel you can sing for truth, justice and peace.\\" On 1 June 1969, in their room at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel, Lennon and Ono recorded the version of Give Peace A Chance alongside a chorus of their friends that was released to the public. Feinberg served as one of the backup singers making up the chorus in Give Peace A Chance together with Timothy Leary, Petula Clark, Allen Ginsberg, Tom Smothers, Kyoko Cox, Derek Taylor and many others. In August 1969, the version of Give Peace A Chance that was recorded in Montreal was released. In 1969, in Toronto, Feinberg and Lennon recorded a duet of Give A Peace A Chance, which was released as a single. Feinberg and Lennon worked together on several peace projects over the course of 1969. The success of his duet with Lennon inspired Feinberg to resume his singing career and he released more 10 songs over the last years of his life. At Lennon's encouragement, Feinberg recorded an album I Was So Much Older Then, which was recorded in 1969 and released in 1970. The songs on I Was So Much Older Then were mostly covers of songs by Neil Young, Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan, which a reviewer on Billboard noted in 1970 gave one a clue to the kind of music that Feinberg was listening to. In June 1969, Eldridge Cleaver of the Black Panthers visited Algeria and declared his support for Al Fath group of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In a letter to the editor of The Black Panther published on 9 August 1969, Feinberg identified himself as a \\"Jew\\", \\"Rabbi\\", and a \\"Panther supporter\\" who expressed his dismay at Cleaver's pro-Palestinian remarks. Feinberg asked for the Black Panthers to dissociate themselves with the PLO, which he described as a group committed ending to Israel via violence, and to driving the two million Jews of Israel out. No reply to Feinberg's letter was ever given, and The Black Panther continued to take a very anti-Israeli, pro-Palestinian line, depicting the PLO as a heroic freedom fighters engaged in the same struggle as the Panthers. In December 1969, Feinberg spoke at a rally attended by American draft dodgers living in Toronto, where he praised them as American patriots, saying: \\"You should not feel that you are betraying America, you are saving it. I deny that I'm anti-American. I'm far more loyal to the United States than the silent majority\\" [supporting Richard Nixon, a reference to Nixon's \\"silent majority speech\\"]. On 11 March 1970, Feinberg was a lead speaker at a Toronto fundraiser hosted by Red, White and Black group that sought raise money for the defense lawyers of the \\"Chicago 7\\". Red, White and Black was the support group for American draft-dodgers living in Canada that sought to help them integrate into Canadian society while protesting the war by holding anti- war rallies in front of the American consulate in Toronto. On 14 February 1971, Feinberg's wife died in Toronto of cancer. Return to America In 1972, he returned to the United States to be close to his son Jonathan. Feinberg settled in Berkeley, California, and worked as the rabbi for the Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco which catered to \\"the outcasts of our social system.\\" Feinberg became the \\"Rabbi-in-Residence\\" at the Glide Memorial Church, a Methodist church mostly attended by homosexuals and homeless people. As an old man, he was active in the \\"grey lib\\" movement, demanding better treatment of the old. In Berkeley, he hosted a radio show called Grey Lib, criticizing America's treatment of the elderly. In 1976 he settled in Reno, where his son Jonathan had gone to work as a doctor. In Reno, Feinberg worked as \\"Rabbi-in-Residence\\" at Temple Sinai. He also served as a rabbi at the Center for Religion and Life at the University of Nevada. From 1976 to 1978, he hosted another radio station in Reno called Grey Lib Plus. His last book, Sex and the Pulpit, was a demand for Judaism to acknowledge more the healthiness of human sexuality as a source of happiness. Feinberg argued what he called \\"sex negationism\\" was a distortion of Judaism. Feinberg used books from the Tanakh such as highly erotic The Song of Songs and the Book of Proverbs with their remarks about how a husband should keep his wife happy to base his case against \\"sex negationism\\". Making a feminist argument, Feinberg argued that men in the ancient Middle East were afraid of female sexuality, and that many of the more patriarchal aspects of Judaism, Christianity and Islam were based on an effort to control the sexuality of women. Feinberg argued that women have a greater desire for sex as the clitoris produces more sexual pleasure than the penis, causing sexual repression to emerge as a way to control women. He maintained that female genital mutilation, which involved cutting out the clitoris, was an especially brutal form of male control. He also noted that female genital mutilation is very common in the Near East. Feinberg wrote that for men the greatest fear when a women gives birth is whatever the child is theirs or not, hence the fear that uncontrolled female sexuality would mean that they would never know if they really fathered the children that they believed to be theirs. Feinberg noted on his visits to Jerusalem that he saw in the Orthodox neighborhoods signs that denounced women who wore short skirts or uncovered their arms as \\"prostitutes\\". He also reported that he saw students from Orthodox yeshivot scream \\"prostitutes\\" at any Israeli women dressed in any manner that might in the slightest excite male sexual desire, which he used to argue that there was a strong fear of female sexuality in Orthodox Judaism. He noted that many of the peoples the ancient Hebrews were in conflict with such as the Egyptians, the Phoenicians and the Greeks worshiped goddesses such as Isis, Ishtar, Dianna and Aphrodite, which increased the contrast between the patriarchal Yahweh vs. the goddesses of their enemies. He further noted that many of the goddess cults in the ancient Middle East such as the Great Mother of the Gods with her seven breasts openly displayed, had both priests and priestess who were equals. However, in the Great Mother of Gods cult, which originated in Phrygia and spread all over the Roman empire, the priests had to castrate themselves to honor the Great Mother and dress as women while the priestesses did not have to sexually mutilate themselves and did not have to wear male clothing. Feinberg argued that such cults increased the male fear of women in Judaism, observing the Prophets of the Tanakh denounced with great vehemence the licentious religion practiced by the peoples of Canaan and Phoenicia. He also argued that Judaism had more respect for women, observing the cult of Ishtar required all women to serve as sacred prostitutes in her temples at least once a year while the worship of Moloch required human sacrifice by burning children alive. Feinberg also argued against what he called \\"penis imperialism\\", and for women to have control of their own sexuality. In the same book, Feinberg had an entire chapter entitled \\"Salute to a Gay Friend\\" arguing for the tolerance and acceptance of homosexuality as normal. Feinberg also argued for the acceptance of gay rabbis and gay synagogues as being a correct expression of Judaism. He argued that the Sodom and Gomorrah story in The Book of Genesis was not a condemnation of homosexuality, observing the crime of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah was that they were hostile and unfriendly towards strangers by wanting to gang-rape the two angels whom Lot had accepted as his guests. Finally, Feinberg argued that God loves peoples of both sexes equally, meaning that it was acceptable for women to serve as rabbis. In 1983, Feinberg married Patricia C. Blanchard. In 1986, he died in Reno of cancer. Books by Feinberg *Storm the Gates of Jericho (1964) *Rabbi Feinberg's Hanoi Diary (1968) *Sex and the Pulpit (1981).

Honorebel has collaborated with artist such as the queen of reggae/dancehall Lady Saw, Gyptian, Shaggy, Sean Paul, Pitbull, Sean Kingston, Akon, Flo Rida and Willy Chirino just to name a few. It was inevitable that Honorebel's music quickly morphed. He infused various styles to fit his deliverance, ranging from roots dancehall to Techno-pop to pop-rock, EDM to Tropical House, to reggaeton. Honorebel began to widen his musical catalog and his audience appeal, reaching as far as Russia, where he performed live at the Russian MTV Video Music Awards in 2007 with Russian Pop Star, Julia Kova in Moscow, Russia. 2009-2013 In August 2009, Honorebel inked a deal with Ultra Records, American indie EDM label. Within a month, He released his hit single \\"Now You See It (Shake That Ass)\\" featuring American rapper Pitbull and Jump Smokers in September 2009 and it takes the EDM club scene by storm world-wide. \\"Now You See It (Shake That Ass)\\" has over 45 million views on YouTube, went #1 in 24 different countries world-wide, peaked at #22 on Billboard's Top 100 Dance Chart, #34 on the Billboard Hot 200 Chart. The song remained on the charts for multiple weeks. The single was released as a digital download on October 5, 2009, and was also included on Honorebel's second album, \\"Club Scene\\" in 2010, under Ultra Records. The music video was directed by David Russio, and released with an aggressive viral campaign by Ultra Records. Within the first year, the video had accumulated over 10 million views on YouTube. Barbadian singer, Rihanna, introduced the video for \\"Now You See It (Shake That Ass)\\" as it debuted on MuchMusic (Canada) in October 2009. The single and remixed versions of \\"Now You See It (Shake That Ass)\\" is distributed on over 16+ Ultra Records dance compilations on iTunes worldwide. The success of \\"Now You See It (Shake That Ass)\\" made it one of 2009's Top Club Bangers coming in at #9 on MTV and #13 on MuchMusic (Canada). As the success of \\"Now You See It (Shake That Ass)\\" continued, Pitbull invited Honorebel to come out on the road as a supporting act for Pitbull's US multi-city Carnival tour, in late spring 2010. Honorebel's debut album Club Scene with Ultra Records digitally released May 25, 2010. Collaborations on the album include island dance pop song, \\"My Girl\\" featuring Jamaican-American singer, Sean Kingston and American rapper, Trina. The single releases with a big forward from mainstream radio and Caribbean appeal. The official \\"My Girl\\" music video, directed by David Russio, hits hard on the media circuit with front page features on VEVO, Daily Motion, Yahoo! Music and many more. Popular live urban music video show BET‚Äôs 106 & Park showcased the music video for \\"My Girl\\" featuring Sean Kingston and Trina as new joint of the day in August 2010. Around the same time, Honorebel was featured as \\"Artist On The Rise\\" on Windows Media Player's Feature page. FatMan Scoop added more power with his club banging dance remix of \\"My Girl\\" ‚Äì Honorebel feat. Sean Kingston & FatMan Scoop, remixed by Disco Fries. In March 2011, \\"I Wanna\\" featuring Pitbull single and music video was released by Ultra Records. In 2012, Honorebel performed Reggae Sumfest, the largest music festival in Jamaica and the Caribbean, which takes place each year in mid-July in Montego Bay. Honorebel's songs have earned placement in multiple motion pictures and television shows. \\"Now You See It (Shake That Ass)\\" was featured on CW Television Network hit show Hellcats in January 2012. \\"Now You See It (Shake That Ass)\\" and \\"I Wanna\\" both featured on Showtime's hit series Californication. Benny Benassi's remix of \\"Now You See It (Shake That Ass)\\" was included on the soundtrack for \\"Piranha 3D\\" the same year. \\"Party On\\" featuring Disco Fries appeared on the soundtrack of Universal Pictures' blockbuster American Reunion, the fourth installment in the \\"American Pie\\" film series released also in 2012. Mid summer 2012, \\"Strip Search\\" a single featuring Stephen Davids & Kelly Bomb went #1 on Malta PRS Charts. \\"Ravin and Clean\\" was the #1 song in Africa and the #1 music video on Video Mix in South Florida in December 2012. In 2013, the single \\"Caribbean Dream\\" appeared on the soundtrack of Zumba Fitness: World Party, one of the most popular fitness games in the world. Honorebel and Pitbull collaborated again on \\"Seize The Night\\" officially released 2013, produced by Erik Rydmark & Sven Lundholm. 2014-present \\"Seize The Night\\" featuring Pitbull appeared Honorebel's third album Honor Roll on his new label, Phantom Music Group, in November 2014. In the summer of 2015, Honorebel and Pitbullmade another classic entitled \\"She‚Äôs My Summer\\" which went #1 on the Swiss Dance Charts and steadily held position in the Top 10 in nine countries worldwide. Honorebel's 2019 single \\"Bridal\\" features Nigerian recording artist Sound Sultan and Joe El. Honorebel and American recording artist, Marica Linn came together collaboratively on the single, \\"Spotlight\\" released October 2019. In November 2019, Honorebel released \\"Above the Noise\\", which, in addition to \\"Bridal\\", features songs including a Latin-tinged ballad collaboration with Tarrus Riley titled \\"Be Free\\".

An incident electron beam collides with the target and the electrons scattered to the left and to the right at a specific angle Œ∏ are detected The Sherman function describes the dependence of electron-atom scattering events on the spin of the scattered electrons. It was first evaluated theoretically the physicist Noah Sherman and it allows the measurement of polarization of an electron beam by Mott scattering experiments. A correct evaluation of the Sherman function associated to a particular experimental setup is of vital importance in experiments of spin polarized photoemission spectroscopy, which is an experimental technique which allows to obtain information about the magnetic behaviour of a sample.  Background = Polarization and spin-orbit coupling  Correction to Coulomb potential due to spin-orbit coupling. The Coulomb potential, result of the interaction of the electron with the charged nucleus is shown in green. The new potential for spin up (blue) and spin down (red) electrons are shown after spin-orbit correctios have been taken into account When an electron beam is polarized, an unbalance between spin-up, n_{up}, and spin-down electrons, n_{down}, exists. The unbalance can be evaluated through the polarization P defined as P = \\\\frac{n_{up}-n_{down}}{n_{up}+n_{down}}. It is known that, when an electron collides against a nucleus, the scattering event is governed by Coulomb interaction. This is the leading term in the Hamiltonian, but a correction due to spin-orbit coupling can be taken into account and the effect on the Hamiltonian can be evaluated with the perturbation theory. Spin orbit interaction can be evaluated, in the rest reference frame of the electron, as the result of the interaction of the spin magnetic moment of the electron : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu}_S = -g_\\\\text{s} \\\\mu_\\\\text{B} \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{S}}{\\\\hbar}, with the magnetic field that the electron sees, due to its orbital motion around the nucleus, whose expression in the non-relativistic limit is: :\\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\frac{1}{m_\\\\text{e} ec^2} \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial U(r)}{\\\\partial r} \\\\mathbf{L}. In these expressions \\\\mathbf{S} is the spin angular-momentum, \\\\mu_\\\\text{B} is the Bohr magneton, g_\\\\text{s} is the g-factor, \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck constant, m_\\\\text{e} is the electron mass, e is the elementary charge, c is the speed of light, U = eV is the potential energy of the electron and \\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\mathbf{r} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{p} is the angular momentum. Due to spin orbit coupling, a new term will appear in the Hamiltonian, whose expression is V_\\\\text{SO} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu_s}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{B}. Due to this effect, electrons will be scattered with different probabilities at different angles. Since the spin- orbit coupling is enhanced when the involved nuclei possess a high atomic number Z, the target is usually made of heavy metals, such as mercury, gold and thorium.  Asymmetry  If we place two detectors at the same angle from the target, one on the right and one on the left, they will generally measure a different number of electrons n_{R} and n_{L}. Consequently it is possible to define the asymmetry A, as A = \\\\frac{n_{R}-n_{L}}{n_{R}+n_{L}}. Sherman function as a function of the angle for mercury (Z = 80) with Œ≤ = 0.2. Typically detectors are placed in a position where the effect is maximized, 120¬∞ for gold and mercury The Sherman function S(\\\\theta) is a measure of the probability of a spin-up electron to be scattered, at a specific angle \\\\theta, to the right or to the left of the target, due to spin-orbit coupling. It can assume values ranging from -1 (spin-up electron is scattered with 100% probability to the left of the target) to +1 (spin-up electron is scattered with 100% probability to the right of the target). The value of the Sherman function depends on the energy of the incoming electron, evaluated via the parameter \\\\beta = \\\\frac{v}{c}. When S(\\\\theta)=0, spin-up electrons will be scattered with the same probability to the right and to the left of the target. Then it is possible to write n_{R} = \\\\frac{n_{up}[1+S(\\\\theta)]+n_{down}[1-S(\\\\theta)]}{2} n_{L} = \\\\frac{n_{up}[1-S(\\\\theta)]+n_{down}[1+S(\\\\theta)]}{2}. Plugging these formulas inside the definition of asymmetry, it is possible to obtain a simple expression for the evaluation of the asymmetry at a specific angle \\\\theta, i.e.: A = PS(\\\\theta). Theoretical calculations are available for different atomic targets and for a specific target, as a function of the angle.  Application  Mott scattering of an electron beam with S(\\\\theta)=0.5 To measure the polarization of an electron beam, a Mott detector is required. In order to maximize the spin-orbit coupling, it is necessary that the electrons arrive near to the nuclei of the target. To achieve this condition, a system of electron optics is usually present, in order to accelerate the beam up to keV or to MeV energies. Since standard electron detectors count electrons being insensitive to their spin, after the scattering with the target any information about the original polarization of the beam is lost. Nevertheless, by measuring the difference in the counts of the two detectors, the asymmetry can be evaluated and, if the Sherman function is known from previous calibration, the polarization can be calculated by inverting the last formula. In order to characterize completely the in-plane polarization, setups are available, with four channeltrons, two devoted to the left-right measure and two devoted to the up-right measure.  Example  In the panel it is shown an example of the working principle of a Mott detector, supposing a value for S(\\\\theta)=0.5. If an electron beam with a 3:1 ratio of spin-up over spin-down electrons collide with the target, it will be splitted with a ratio 5:3, according to previous equation, with an asymmetry of 25%.
