The Guardia Civil was the largest branch of the Fuerza P√∫blica (Public Force) and was responsible for the defense of the nation in addition to its law enforcement duties. History The Civil Guard was founded in 1949 and combined the functions of an army, air force, navy, national police and coast guard. As formed, it was intended to have a very limited military capacity but have a primary internal security function. Its strength was initially 1,200, which remained relatively stable until the mid-1970s when it increased to 2,000. With its increased size came a tendency to assume a more military role.Armed Forces of Latin America by Adrian English The Civil Guard was organised along military lines and was deployed in seven provincial companies. Roughly 40 percent of the Civil Guard was deployed in or near the capital of San Jos√©. The units included the Presidential Guard approximating battalion size, and a Security battalion which combined 1st and 2nd Companies. The 3rd Company, which functioned as a strategic reserve, a depot and a training unit, was also the size of a small battalion. Other Civil Guard units included the Traffic Force, a nationwide highway patrol, and the Investigationes, a detective force. Since 1963, all personnel have been trained at the National Police School with others undergoing training in the United States or at the School of the Americas in the Panama Canal Zone. The police functions of the Civil Guard were basically confined to the national and provincial capitals with the policing of rural towns and villages being the responsibility of the Guardia de Asistencia Rural Rurales (Rural Assistance Guard). A small Civil Guard force was deployed in the Dominican Civil War. The only recent operations of the Civil Guard were during the Nicaraguan Civil War and during the Contra War. In 1996, the Ministry of Public Security was established controlling the Fuerza P√∫blica or Public Force which was subsequently reorganized and eliminated the Civil Guard, Rural Assistance Guard, and Frontier Guards as separate entities; they are now under the Ministry and operate on a geographic command basis performing ground security, law enforcement, counter-narcotics, and border patrol functions. Equipment The attempted invasion of Costa Rica from Nicaragua in 1955 demonstrated the need of maintaining a self-defence ability so the Civil Guard has maintained a quantity of light infantry weapons and support weapons. Despite its official abolition of its military, between 1950 and 1970 Costa Rica accepted 1.8 million USD in military aid and 113,000 USD in surplus equipment from the United States. However, in 1981, the Costa Rican government stated that all military equipment on hand -- including a small number of M113 armored personnel carriers acquired in the mid-1970s -- was obsolete or obsolescent. Equipment known to be held includes M16 rifles, Ar15 machine gun, Uzis, Browning Automatic Rifles, Browning M1919 machine guns, all in .30 inch and Thompson submachine guns. Costa Rica is not known to possess any mortars, artillery, or anti-tank weapons. The Civil Guard Volunteer Reserve follows the strength of the regular force with equipment available for 10,000. Coast Guard The Civil Guard Coast Guard was established in 1949 and initially consisted of a 90-foot launch on each coast and a rescue tug on the Caribbean, and three small boats were later added in the mid-1950s. by 1980 six launches were added to the force, one 100 ton and five of 36 tons. By the mid-1980s the Coast Guard was as follows: Caribbean * 1 large patrol boat * 5 small patrol boats * 1 rescue Tug Pacific coast * 3 small patrol launches Air section An air section was initially added during the 1955 invasion, notably P-51 fighters donated by the United States, but most if not all of its aircraft were written off shortly after the closing of hostilities. No further combat aircraft were acquired. Other aircraft included one Beech C-45, one Cessna 170, two Cessna 180's and three Cessna U-17's. Three DHC-3 Otters were later acquired as were two Bell 47 helicopters. During the 1960s and 1970s the Air Section mostly acquired helicopters; two Sikorsky S-58s, one FH-1100, two Hughes 269C's and two Bell UH-1Bs. By 1980 one Piper Seneca, two Piper Aztecs and three Piper Cherokees were obtained. By the early 1980s the Air Section operated seven small fixed-wing aircraft and five helicopters. Regional organization The Civil Guard was an all volunteer force commanded by a Colonel as Director. The Civil Guard acted as a municipal police and a military force. There were over 6,000 men in the Civil Guard and they were organized into seven small battalion-sized companies, one per province, They were: * Alajuela * Cartago * Guanacaste * Heredia * Lim√≥n * Puntarenas * San Jos√© and three battalions: * Presidential Guard * Northern Border Security Battalion aka Border Patrol (Patrulla Fronteriza)- 750 men operational on the Nicaraguan border, formed in May 1985 by combining 1st and 2nd companies. * COIN or Counterinsurgency Battalion Plus: * Special Intervention Unit (Unidad Especial de Intervenci√≥n) (UEI). Established in the mid-1980s and is between 60 and 80 men strong. Tasked with hostage rescue, VIP protection and conducting high-risk criminal raids and arrests. The unit makes use of 11-man assault teams, each divided into subteams of 3-4 men each. In addition, they have a small sniper element used for observation and fire support. The UIE is located in the 1st Civil Guard facilities in San Jos√©. They have received a great deal of training from a wide variety of sources, including Israel, Panama, USA, Argentina, and Spain. * Coastguard of 250 with several patrol boats * Air Unit with a dozen light aircraft and helicopters There was also a 3,000 man National Reserve, the General Staff and enough equipment, mostly small arms, for 10,000 reservists.

A culturally rich, stable traditional political system with institutions of government dating back 900 years, it is one of the oldest civilisations in existence pre-colonial Nigeria. Today, it is made up of three autonomous communities/towns, listed in order of seniority: Akpa-Edem, Ozi-Edem and Edem- Ani Edem Autonomous Communities http://www.ebeano.org/LocalGovernments.html but unified as a culturally inviolable and indivisible federated entity. Edem has an area of with several hills providing stunning views from multiple points. The population of Edem is 39,633 based on the National Population Commission census conducted in 2006. Edem shares common borders with Obimo on the south, Nsukka on the east, Ibagwa Ani on the north, and Nrobo on the west. Towns along the border include Okpuje near Owa and Egu Amegu, Abbi near Egu Amegu Abbi, Ugwuoke Ugwuinyi near Egu Amegu, and Ero Uno near Edem-Ani. The people of Edem are from the Igala ethnic group but currently, located in the South East of Nigeria since the division of the country into states and geopolitical zones. Due to their ancestry and proximity to Northern Nigeria, as well as their location in the northern part of Igboland, they are referred to as Northern Igbos. Composition of Edem Edem is made up of 41 villages: Akpa-Edem Zone * Ama Oba * Amadiuba * Amadimogo * Amankwa * Dimunazu * Igoro Agbo * Igoro Ugwu * Isamani * Nkawushi * Obeke * Okiti * Owa-Edem * Uwenu na Uwani Obeke Ozi-Edem Zone * Ama Uwenu * Amabunegu * Amamkpume * Amaudo * Amaukpa * Amaukwa * Dimoke * Ezi-Ozi * Ikwe Ezike * Obinegun * Ukpara * Umueyi * Umuoji * Umokoo Edem-Ani Zone * Amaenu-Edem * Amaezumesu * Amaogwu * Isu * Nkofi * Odojo * Ogbododu * Owere-Ugwu * Owereagbo * Ozara * Ubogidi * Umuchiagwu * Umuchioke * Uwani-Edem Each village has an Oha Council headed by an Onyishi according to their culture and traditions. Traditional Political System and Institutions The principal Edem ancestral, cultural, traditional political system and institution is Oha Edem (Edem Ruling Council of Elders) which consists of the following members to name a few: Eze Edem (The Sovereign), Onyishi Edem (The Oldest Man/Clan Head of Edem), Ossai Edem (Cultural Principal Private Secretary to Eze Edem), Atama Tazz (Chief Priest of Edem), Ndi Ishi (Zonal/Clan Heads), Asogwa (Ambassador of a Clan), Iduja (Deputy Ambassador of a Clan), Omabe/Ogbanabo (Traditional Police of the Realm & Ogueze (bodyguards) to the Eze Edem). Ogbanabo has Esato as the Senior Officer and Akaaju as the Junior Officer). Eze Edem is the Sovereign, the symbol of unity, custodian of culture and dispenser of justice within the Edem cultural political system. The Eze Edem is compelled by law to perform the Executive, Legislative and Judicial functions as they concern Edem culture. Kingship in Edem involves considerable self-denial. Onyishi Edem is drawn from Obeke Akpa-Edem, Onyishi Akpa-Edem is drawn from Owa, Onyishi Ozi-Edem from Umuokoo while Onyishi Edem-Ani is from Amaogwu. While Onyishi Ozi-Edem and Onyishi Edem-Ani must be the oldest in their clan, the criteria for selecting Onyishi Akpa-Edem is different. The people of Akpa-Edem felt that somebody younger and stronger will represent them better hence their Onyishi is always a much younger person compared to his colleagues from the other 2 zones. Meanwhile, the people in Ozi-Edem and Edem-Ani zones believed an older, wiser and more experienced person will represent them better. Within Oha Edem, each member has a specific role to play for e.g. the Asogwa Umuchiagwu is Ega/Oga [Provost/Messenger] Oha Edem, assisted by Asogwa Ezi-Ozi. Members of Oha are divided into 2 categories. Category 1 is Idi-Ani which is made up of Ndi Ishi (Onyishi). Category 2 is Oha Enu which is made up of Asogwas and Idujas. This applies to Oha Edem and also different levels of Oha in the 3 zones/autonomous communities. Membership of Oha Edem is based on hereditary positions for the relevant contributing zones/clans/families. Different zones/clans/families have their own rules/criteria for deciding who will be an Oha member. It cannot be decided by people who are not from that zone/clan/family. The process is completely independent and cannot be manipulated. There is never a haste in replacing a deceased member/official of Oha. Whenever the zone/clan/family is ready to enthrone a replacement, so shall it be. In the case of the Eze Edem, the same principle of \\"never in a haste\\" also applies. It is on record that it once took nearly 25 years for a new Eze Edem to ascend the throne after the demise of his predecessor. Easy example, the current Eze Edem ascended the throne on the 16th of July 2009 while his father and predecessor passed away 10 years earlier on the 14th of October 1999. During this vacuum, a Regent was appointed by Oha Edem. Edem and its cultural/traditional institutions existed long before the Europeans set foot on the shores of modern-day Nigeria. Edem was a sovereign and fully independent traditional state long before the Europeans came into Africa. It continues to maintain that cultural independence till date.  Economy  The main economic activity in the kingdom is agriculture. The people practice shifting cultivation and crop rotation. Cash crops: kolanuts, oil beans, breadfruit, black-eyed beans, brown beans, yams, cocoyams, cowpeas, maize, cotton, and groundnuts. Fruits: citrus fruits (tangerines, lemons, limes, grapefruits, and oranges), cashews, avocado pears, guavas, pawpaws, pineapples, bananas, watermelons, mangoes, pears, African star apples, black apples, blue apples, showasho and irvingia(wild mangoes or bush mangoes). Vegetables: light green amaranth, dark green amaranth, ahihara, waterleaves, bitterleaves, pumpkins, garden eggs, fluted pumpkins, okra, red chili peppers, yellow chili peppers, alligator peppers and black pepper. Due to the rocky nature of certain parts of Edem, another significant economic activity is the small-scale manual production of stone for construction.

Her father was incumbent of Brunswick ChapelBritish Census 1881 RG11 0156/25, pg. 20 ‚Äì Biographical sources state that she was born in Wimbledon, but the ONS Birth Indices confirm Marylebone and an adherent of the Higher Life movement, being one of the founders of the Keswick Convention. The family later lived at Wimbledon. Moore was educated at Wimbledon High School, Westfield College (University of London) and the London School of Medicine for Women ‚Äì later the Royal Free Hospital. She qualified in 1906 and held house appointments at the Royal Free Hospital until her marriage in 1908. During the First World War, Payne became commandant and medical officer in Torquay at the Red Cross Hospital for wounded soldiers. In the 1918 Birthday Honours, she was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her work. Psychoanalytic career Payne developed an interest in psychoanalysis during the war and began training with Edward Glover at the Medico-Psychological Clinic on Brunswick Square, London. She went to Berlin, where she underwent analysis with Hans Sachs and got to know Karl Abraham. In 1922, Payne became an Associate Member of the British Psychoanalytical Society. In 1926 she became a psychiatrist at Ernest Jones' London Clinic of Psychoanalysis (later the Institute of Psychoanalysis) and a member of the society. Payne was strong advocate for psychoanalysis and a prolific writer on psychoanalysis and women. Jones put her in charge of administration at the society, where she was very effective. In 1929 she was joint secretary with Joan Riviere in the International Congress in Oxford. Payne was the analyst for Marion Milner and Charles Rycroft, among others. Between 1941 and 1945, she played an important part in the controversial discussions as one of the moderators between Melanie Klein and Anna Freud. She organised a stenographer to record the discussion accurately, so members who could not get to London because of war work could be kept in touch. At the same time, there was a constitutional debate within the society centring on Edward Glover. The result was that Glover resigned from the society and Anna Freud resigned from the training committee. In 1944 Payne was elected as president of the society, with Ernest Jones as honorary president. Payne was in charge of discussions on training, with an ad hoc committee including John Bowlby, Anna Freud, Willi Hoffer, Melanie Klein, Susan Isaacs, Adrian Stephen and John Rickman.; and as 'three separately angled trainings arose'R.

She ceased to be president in 1947 but was president of the BPAS again from 1954 to 1956. In 1962, she was elected an honorary member of the BPAS. She was also a Fellow of the British Psychological Society. Personal life John Ernest Payne In 1908 she married John Ernest Payne, a surgeon who had rowed for Cambridge in the Boat Race in 1899 and 1900, and stroked the winning Leander Club four in the Stewards' Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta in 1900.

Early life  Joseph N. Pew was born in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, to John Pew and Nancy Glenn. He worked on the family's farm as a child. Pew attended public schools in Mercer and graduated from Edinboro Normal School (1866). Pew taught school for two years and then became a real estate broker. Beginning in 1904, Pew lived in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania at his estate named \\"Glenmede\\", designed by architect Will Price.  Oil Industry  Eventually, Pew invested in Pennsylvania oil fields. With several partners, he began piping natural gas. Pew founded several petroleum-related companies and, in 1880, incorporated Sun Oil Company. Pew donated to various charities and sat on the Board of Directors of Grove City College, Grove City, Pennsylvania. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church and the Republican Party. Pew's sons, J. Howard Pew and Joseph N. Pew, Jr., took over management of the company after their father's death in 1912 and later, with their sisters, founded The Pew Charitable Trusts. In 1881, he developed the Keystone Gas Company which used the by-products of oil, such as natural gas, to provide heat and light for the community of Bradford, Pennsylvania, a town that emerged as a wild oil boom town in the Pennsylvania oil rush in the late 19th century. The area's Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil has superior qualities and is free of asphaltic constituents, contains only trace amounts of sulfur and nitrogen, and has excellent characteristics for refining into lubricants. By 1889 Pew's Keystone Gas Company was delivering gas to Pittsburgh. The Haymaker Gas Well in Murrysville, Pennsylvania was the United States's first commercial natural gas well. For some time, it remained the largest commercial gas well in the world. In 1885 and 1886, individuals who established the Haymaker Gas Well moved on to Ohio and created Sunoco. Eventually, and in partnership with E.O. Emerson, he developed the Peoples Natural Gas Company.

Parker, the fourth in his Jesse Stone series. Plot summary A couple of middle-aged thrill killers, Brianna and Anthony Lincoln, are independently wealthy from a patent Anthony obtained for an optical scanner he invented while practicing medicine. The couple move to Paradise and begin picking random people and murdering them by simultaneously shooting them in the heart with .22 caliber pistols. They then make love while watching videos of the murders. Kenneth Eisley is the first victim; Jesse does not discover his identity until after some investigation, and finds his dog. The Lincolns then stalk and kill a woman in a supermarket, and Jesse has the license plate numbers collected from all cars present at the scene. Next the Lincolns murder a man behind a church as he walks home from the train station. Two teenage boys stumble on the body while skateboarding and notice a red 1995 Saab. With the help of the state police, Jesse finds all people who have both registered .22s and a red 1995 Saab, and checks if there was a red Saab at the supermarket. This leads Jesse to the Lincolns. Jesse briefly interviews the Lincolns, who seem very interested in the murders. He takes their .22 rifle for testing, but it has never been fired. However, he leaves convinced they are the killers. The murderers then stalk Abby Taylor. Although Abby is considering marrying another man, she still has feelings for Jesse. After spending an evening with Jesse and making love to him, she returns home and is murdered by the Lincolns. They begin stalking and taking photos of Jesse, who learns of this while tailing them one night when they stop at his condo to take photos. Flirting with getting caught, and hoping to prove how smart they are ‚Äîand how dumb the police are‚Äî the Lincolns invite Jesse to lunch. They probe him about the murders, but he reveals little. Later, a note is delivered to the police station telling Jesse to come to Paradise Mall at 7pm to learn about the murders. Believing they intend to murder him, Jesse stations officers at the mall and goes wearing a bullet-proof vest. As he approaches the elevator in the food court he is confronted by the Lincolns as they exit it, and they both shoot him in the chest and re-enter the elevator. Jesse bounds up the escalator, but the elevator descends again. When they exit, they have changed clothes. Officer Anthony D'Angelo thinks he recognizes the woman and stops her; she turns and shoots him in the head, killing him instantly. They escape in a rented Volvo. Feeling guilty for D'Angelo's murder, which he believes could have been prevented had he involved the state police, Jesse trudges on with the case. He took it personally after Abby's murder, and wanted to catch the killers without the state police. They obtain a search warrant for the Lincolns' rented penthouse condo and find pictures of the victims on their computer, and the abandoned Saab. Jesse's ex-wife Jenn wonders how they got to the mall without their car, which leads Jesse to check car rentals and match them with names of people who patented optical scanners. One was rented on the day of the murder to Arlington Larmont: Anthony Lincoln was an alias. Jesse discovers that the car was dropped off in Toronto, and the state police find the couple registered at a Toronto hotel, where they are picked up by local police. Jesse drives up to confront the couple, who play dumb. Jesse responds by kneeing Arlington in the groin. When his wife jumps up to defend her husband, Jesse slaps her, then leaves. Subplots The main subplot involves the gang rape of a 16-year-old girl. Candace Pennington first comes to Jesse with her mother after the rape, but she refuses to speak of it. Her mother takes her home after learning that Candace will have to testify, fearing her daughter will become the object of a public scandal. However, Molly makes it her mission to catch the perpetrators. She stakes out the school and sees three boys harassing Candace and showing her something. Jesse talks with Candace alone, who admits she was raped and tells him who did it. She pleads with Jesse not to reveal that she told, as she is scared what they will do. She reveals that they took nude photos of her and threatened to show them around school if she told. Jesse promises not to reveal that she told, but determines to discover their involvement by other means. Posing as the bus driver, Molly arrests Bo Marino for smoking dope. During Bo's interrogation, Chief Stone finds the nude photos in Bo's backpack of a crying Candace being held down. Kevin Feeney is seen clearly in one of the photos, so Jesse brings him in. Kevin admits to it and implicates Troy Drake. During a meeting with Candace, her father, Bo, and his father, Candace's father attacks Bo. When Bo's father tries to defend his son, Mr. Pennington knocks him out. Jesse does nothing to stop it, and later states that Bo first attacked Mr. Pennington, who only tried to defend himself. The Marino's threaten to sue, but their lawyer, who is romantically involved with Jesse, convinces them to drop the suit. The boys are sentenced to three years probation and 120 hours community service, since they are minors and first time offenders. Dissatisfied, Jesse convinces the lawyers to get them assigned to him for their community service, and puts them to work around the station. Later he gives the first murder victim's dog to Candace before she and her family move away. As in the other novels in the series, Jesse has several romantic relationships. He continues to see Marcy Campbell, and sees Abby once before her murder. He begins to see the Marino's lawyer, Rita Fiore, and they start to fall in love. The novel begins with Jesse drinking again, but after getting drunk with Jenn at the beginning he stops drinking completely. Towards the beginning Jesse confronts Jenn and her date outside her office after she doesn't return his calls. He fantasizes about murdering her date and confesses this to his shrink. Jenn later tries to advance her career by using him to get exclusive information on the serial murders he is investigating. He refuses, and begins to think they are through, but at the end of the novel Jenn tells Jesse she is unhappy with anyone but him and says she is ready to see him monogamously, to which Jesse agrees. Film adaptation Tom Selleck stars as Jesse Stone in a series of movie specials made by CBS starting with Stone Cold. Although Stone Cold is the fourth novel in the series, it was the first novel in the series to be adapted into a film, and contains significant differences. First, his relationship with Jenn is still relegated to phone calls, they do not reconcile at the end, and Jesse does not stop drinking. It appears that Jenn has moved to Boston to be the weather girl as she is in the novel, and asks if she can come see him, however Jesse says he does not have time for her and she is never seen on screen. She also asks for exclusive coverage of the murders as she did in the novel which he denies. In the film, Jesse is seeing Abby exclusively prior to her murder. More importantly, in the finale, Jesse sets up the Lincolns at a house where Brianna shoots him with both guns. Jesse then shoots and kills Brianna and then demands that her husband pick up the guns. He refuses and states that he never killed anyone and won't get the death penalty for being an accomplice. The shootout does not take place in a mall as in the novel, and Officer D'Angelo is not murdered. Reception The Boston Globe was pleased with the book, saying that \\"Parker is in roaring good form\\". Entertainment Weekly noted that \\"as always, he renders the action in prose as clear and potent as a fine vodka.\\". The Sydney Morning Herald argued that \\"Probably the best thing about the Stone series is Parker's refusal to turn his new protagonist into a stereotype.\\"  See also  * Rotten Tomatoes film review References Category:Jesse Stone (novel series) Category:2003 American novels Category:Novels by Robert B.

The film also featured veteran character actor Ron Masak and other members of the Green Bay Packers organization, including offensive lineman Jerry Kramer. It has been cited as a \\"classic\\" and as the best-selling training film of all time. The film is still in use in leadership and management courses.  Plot  The plot of the film centers around a salesman named Ron (portrayed by Ron Masak) who is trying to make a sales pitch to legendary NFL coach Vince Lombardi. Ron is not very good at his job, and fumbles ineffectually through his sales pitch. Coach Lombardi takes pity on him, and spends the rest of the film teaching him his personal philosophy, known as \\"The Second Effort\\". The sport of American football is used as a metaphor, and lessons on the football field are applied to Ron's own job in sales. Many quotes and aphorisms commonly associated with Lombardi appear in the film, such as \\"mental toughness is the essential key to success\\" and \\"confidence is contagious, and so is the lack of it\\". Scenes take place in Lombardi's office and other locations around Lambeau Field, the Packers home football stadium. The film was designed to train and motivate salesmen. The industry that Ron, the salesman in the film, represents is intentionally left vague, so as to broaden the appeal of the film. It has been used by companies in many industries to train their sales force; it has also been used in other settings as a motivational film.  Reception  Numerous sources have cited this as the best selling film of its type. The film became something of signature film in sales training and corporate motivation, so much so that in 1969, one salesman complained of having been shown the film by his boss twelve times in one year. One reviewer in the Chicago Tribune thought that Lombardi's performance \\"[rated] an Oscar for his role\\" in the film. The film itself has been the subject of an episode of the NFL Films Presents television show, host Steve Sabol interviewed Ron Masak on the making of the film and on his memories of working with Vince Lombardi. Second Effort was an international success as well. People who otherwise were unfamiliar with the sport of American football became fans of it. Australian former rugby league footballer Terry Fearnley was \\"mesmerized\\" by Second Effort after being shown the film as part of a corporate conference held by General Motors Holden. He recommended the film to his friend, legendary rugby league coach Jack Gibson. Gibson promptly cancelled a day of practices to show it to his team; they would go unbeaten for the next seven weeks. Inspired by Lombardi and the film, Fearnley and Gibson would travel to the U.S. to study under American football coaches, and would bring back training techniques that would revolutionize rugby league in Australia. By 1988, twenty years after the film was released, Second Effort had sold 50,000 copies, astoundingly high for a short training film, a genre where even 1000 copies is considered successful. Producers of training films have called it \\"a classic\\" and \\"an amazing film\\" and have cited it as the benchmark film of the industry.

It is located southwest of Lawrence. History The first settlers arrived in 1854, many of whom were either southern colonists or sympathizers who wanted slavery to be legal in the Kansas Territory. However, by 1860, many of these individuals had returned to the south or given up the cause. When William Quantrill razed Lawrence in 1863, some of his men traveled down south and passed near Lone Star. The settlement was initially known as \\"Bond\\"which was the name of its first postmaster. The post office was open from 1875 until 1953. According to the Lawrence Journal-World Lone Star was named as such after a group of settlers saw a star in the sky while trying to think of a suitable name for their community's school. Near Lone Star is Lone Star Lake which was built by the Civilian Lone Star Lake Park Conservation Corps in the 1930s.

Within the United States, Current taught at Rutgers University, Hamilton College, Northern Michigan University, Lawrence University, Mills College, Salisbury State University, the University of Illinois, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Internationally, he lectured in Chile, Japan, India, and Antarctica. Current served as president of the Southern Historical Association in 1975. In addition, he was the editor and/or author of introductions in many other works, and published over 250 articles. His papers are in the Rare Book Room of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. His first wife of 45 years Rose Bonar died in 1983, after which in 1984 he married Marcia Ewing, who co-wrote a biography of dancer Loie Fuller with him. His final book, a collection of translations of writings by the Norwegian author Knut Hamsun was published in 2003. He died in Boston, Massachusetts on October 26, 2012 at age 100 of Parkinson's disease, and was buried in Greensboro, North Carolina. Dean of Lincoln Scholars Current came late to the study of Abraham Lincoln, having published books on 19th century political leaders Thaddeus Stevens, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun, and the history of the typewriter when he was asked to complete a 4-volume biography of Lincoln begun by his University of Illinois colleague James G. Randall, who had finished three volumes before his 1953 death. Current wrote at least half of the fourth volume Lincoln the President: Midstream to the Last Full Measure (1955), which won the prestigious Bancroft Prize from Columbia University, establishing his reputation. Drawn to what he called the \\"perpetual timeliness\\" and \\"eternal relevance\\" of Lincoln's life, Current went on to write seven more books about him. One of his most influential books was The Lincoln Nobody Knows (1958), which delved into the seemingly contradictory elements of Lincoln's life and thought, particularly his views on slavery and race, showing how he overcame the narrow thinking of his childhood in the backwoods of Kentucky and Indiana where racist and white supremacist views were common. \\"The most remarkable thing about him was his tremendous power for growth\\", Current wrote in The Lincoln Nobody Knows. \\"He grew in sympathy, in the breadth of his humaneness, as he grew in other aspects of the mind and spirit. In more ways than one he succeeded in breaking through the narrow bounds of his early environment.\\" \\"The awful fact of the assassination falls between us and the man. It is like a garish, bloodstained glass, in which all perspectives are distorted.\\" His 1963 book Lincoln and the First Shot seeks to dispel many myths about Lincoln, including the theory that some of the members of his Cabinet were in on the assassination conspiracy. Current described how Lincoln built a unity of purpose in the Northern states before the Civil War began in earnest, claiming that Lincoln had a more sophisticated knowledge of law, economics, military tactics et al. than earlier historians had believed. Debate with Gore Vidal After Gore Vidal published his 1984 novel Lincoln, Current began a running feud in the pages of The New York Review of Books, accusing Vidal of willfully distorting the historical record, misrepresenting Lincoln's views, and \\"utter ignorance\\" of the linguistic differences between British English and American English because he did spell \\"jewelry\\" and \\"practice\\" in the British way. \\"He is wrong on big as well as little matters\\", Current summarized. \\"Vidal simply doesn't know what he's talking about.\\"\\"Vidal's 'Lincoln': An Exchange\\", The New York Review of Books, August 18, 1988www.bostonglobe.com In response, Vidal explained that he used what was then common to agreed-upon American speech, and as a writer of novels was obliged to dramatize his story through someone's consciousness. Vidal asserted that Current never read his book in whole, that he was fault finding, and could not separate a biography from a novel, \\"getting all tangled up in misread or misunderstood trivia\\". The real reason for Current's criticism, Vidal maintained, was his portrayal of Lincoln as wanting to colonize the liberated slaves in Liberia, which would go against the political correctness of the 1980s. Ironically, the source of this interpretation according to Vidal was a biography of Lincoln by Current himself.\\"Vidal's 'Lincoln': An Exchange\\", The New York Review of Books, August 18, 1988 Awards * 1956 Bancroft Prize * 1959 Fulbright Professor in Munich, Germany * 1960 O.

This feature film was Varda's debut. It has been cited by many critics as a forerunner of the French New Wave, with the historian Georges Sadoul calling it \\"truly the first film of the nouvelle vague\\". The film takes place in S√®te in the south of France. The Pointe Courte (\\"short point\\") is a tiny quarter of the town known as the fisherman's village. Plot A young man (Philippe Noiret) arrives at a train station to see his wife. After four years of marriage, the couple is having problems of a somewhat existential nature‚Äîthe wife loves her husband, but is thinking of leaving him (he had an affair some time back, but her problem is not jealousy so much as questioning the very nature of love). The couple discuss their lives and become resigned to the fact that they belong together, even if their love has changed. They return to Paris, the wife now better understanding her husband's nature because she's seen his hometown. As this drama unfolds, we see the lives of the poor but proud people living there: fishermen wanting to harvest shellfish from a small lagoon they have been forbidden to use because of an alleged problem with bacteria; a small child dies of an unknown illness; a young man wins the right to court the 16-year-old daughter of a neighbor after proving himself in a local aquatic jousting tournament. Production Varda originally visited La Pointe Courte to take pictures for a friend who could no longer visit her home. After seeing the footage she took there, she rented a camera to shoot a film about a couple from Paris who were visiting La Pointe Courte, the husband's home town. Varda set up her own co-op and began production. The budget for the film was $14,000; roughly one quarter the budget of other feature films of the era including The 400 Blows and Breathless. No members of the cast or crew were paid during the production. Themes In a 1962 interview, Varda spoke of two present themes in the film with \\"the first being a couple reconsidering their relationship and a village that is trying to resolve several collective problems of survival\\". In her movie Les plages d'Agn√®s (The Beaches of Agn√®s), Varda says her film was inspired by William Faulkner's The Wild Palms. Release The film was first screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1955. Its premiere in Paris was in 1956 at the Studio Parnasse. It played with Jean Vigo's documentary film √Ä propos de Nice (1930). The Criterion Collection has released the film in a four-DVD Region 1 box-set.

In 1980, SRT began to sell cable television service, first available in the town of Westhope. Although telephone cooperatives usually operate within set boundaries, in 1990 SRT reached outside their traditional territory to install telephone wire throughout the 17 floors of the North Dakota State Capitol building. Again expanding their offerings, in 1990 SRT became an agent to CommNet 2000, handling a new cellular phone system in Minot, and in 1992 opened their own long distance company. In 1994 SRT acquired Minot Telephone Company (formerly Northern States Power Telephone), the state's largest independent phone company serving approximately 25,000 lines in Minot, Burlington and Surrey.

Along with Skaos from Bavarian Krumbach, No Sports, The Braces from J√ºlich, El Bosso & die Ping-Pongs from Munster and The Busters from Wiesloch, Blechreiz was one of the pioneers of the German ska scene at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. The band mostly plays songs it writes and arranges itself. A number of changes in the lineup has meant that Blechreiz‚Äôs style has varied over the years. Blechreiz allies itself with anti-racist and anti- fascist skinheads such as Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice (SHARP). History In summer 1989, Blechreiz planned a joint tour of the still- securely-walled-in GDR with Michele Baresi, then the only ska band in East Berlin. Although the tour was initially a victim of pre-reunification administrative chaos, it took place when the wall came down in the spring of 1990. Many of the concert venues Blechreiz played in had never before hosted a band from the West. In the next few years, many concerts and tours in Germany and guest appearances in France, London, northern Italy, Belgium, Austria and Poland built the band and its stage show‚Äôs reputation. In 1993, Berlin‚Äôs concertgoers picked Blechreiz as the Best Live Band in Berlin. A concert featuring many guest stars in the Tempodrom concert hall in Berlin generated acclaim from the press. Together with ‚Äòvolxmusic‚Äô band Apparatschik, Blechreiz initiated the SKASDROWJE project in 1994. As a big band formation, they played Russian folk music in ska rhythm at a variety of festivals. In 1995, Blechreiz was featured in TV film ‚ÄûWhich Side Are You On ‚Äì Ska in Berlin‚Äú. It contained film portraits of ska bands Blechreiz West-Berlin) and Michele Baresi. 1996 saw the band's farewell tour in Germany. Their last concert was held in SO36 in Berlin Kreuzberg. Blechreiz reformed in its original lineup in 2008. The kick-off concert was held in the Red Salon in Berlin Mitte on 29 February 2008. Since then, the band has recorded one new album and played gigs in various places in Germany and in the Czech Republic.

It improves the mistake bound of the weighted majority algorithm. Imagine that every morning before the stock market opens, we get a prediction from each of our \\"experts\\" about whether the stock market will go up or down. Our goal is to somehow combine this set of predictions into a single prediction that we then use to make a buy or sell decision for the day. The RWMA gives us a way to do this combination such that our prediction record will be nearly as good as that of the single best expert in hindsight.  Motivation  In machine learning, the weighted majority algorithm (WMA) is a meta-learning algorithm which \\"predicts from expert advice\\". It is not a randomized algorithm: initialize all experts to weight 1. for each round: poll all the experts and predict based on a weighted majority vote of their predictions. cut in half the weights of all experts that make a mistake. Suppose there are n experts and the best expert makes m mistakes. The weighted majority algorithm (WMA) makes at most 2.4(\\\\log_2n+ m) mistakes, which is not a very good bound. We can do better by introducing randomization.  Randomized weighted majority algorithm (RWMA)  The nonrandomized weighted majority algorithm (WMA) only guarantees an upper bound of 2.4 (\\\\log_2n + m), which is problematic for highly error-prone experts (e.g. the best expert still makes a mistake 20% of the time.) Suppose we do N = 100 rounds using n = 10 experts. If the best expert makes m = 20 mistakes, we can only guarantee an upper bound of 2.4 (\\\\log_2 10 + 20) \\\\approx 56 on our number of mistakes. As this is a known limitation of WMA, attempts to improve this shortcoming have been explored in order to improve the dependence on m. Instead of predicting based on majority vote, the weights are used as probabilities: hence the name randomized weighted majority. If w_i is the weight of expert i, let W=\\\\sum_iw_i. We will follow expert i with probability \\\\frac{w_i}{W}. The goal is to bound the worst-case expected number of mistakes, assuming that the adversary (the world) has to select one of the answers as correct before we make our coin toss. Why is this better in the worst case? Idea: the worst case for the deterministic algorithm (weighted majority algorithm) was when the weights split 50/50. But, now it is not so bad since we also have a 50/50 chance of getting it right. Also, to trade-off between dependence on m and \\\\log_2n, we will generalize to multiply by \\\\beta < 1, instead of necessarily by \\\\frac{1}{2}.  Analysis  At the \\\\ t-th round, define \\\\ F_t to be the fraction of weight on the wrong answers. so, \\\\ F_t is the probability we make a mistake on the \\\\ t-th round. Let \\\\ M denote the total number of mistakes we made so far. Furthermore, we define E[M]=\\\\ \\\\sum_tF_t, using the fact that expectation is additive. On the \\\\ t-th round, W becomes \\\\ W(1-(1-\\\\beta)F_t). Reason: on \\\\ F_t fraction, we are multiplying by \\\\ \\\\beta. So, \\\\ W_{final}=n*(1-(1-\\\\beta)F_1)*(1-(1-\\\\beta)F_2)... Let's say that \\\\ m is the number of mistakes of the best expert so far. We can use the inequality \\\\ W\\\\geq \\\\beta^m. Now we solve. First, take the natural log of both sides. We get: \\\\ m \\\\ln\\\\beta \\\\leq \\\\ln(n) + \\\\sum_t \\\\ln(1-(1-\\\\beta)F_t), Simplify: \\\\ \\\\ln(1-x)= -x -\\\\frac {x^2}{2} - \\\\frac {x^3}{3}-..., So, \\\\ \\\\ln(1-(1-\\\\beta)F_t)< -(1-\\\\beta)F_t. \\\\ m \\\\ln\\\\beta \\\\leq \\\\ln(n) - (1-\\\\beta)* \\\\sum_tF_t Now, use \\\\ E[M] =\\\\ \\\\sum_tF_t, and the result is: \\\\ E[M] \\\\leq \\\\frac {m \\\\ln(1/\\\\beta) + \\\\ln(n)}{1-\\\\beta} Let's see if we made any progress: If \\\\ \\\\beta=\\\\frac{1}{2}, we get, \\\\ 1.39m+2 \\\\ln(n)., if \\\\ \\\\beta=\\\\frac{3}{4}, we get, \\\\ 1.15m+4 \\\\ln(n). so we can see we made progress. Roughly, of the form \\\\ (1+\\\\epsilon)*m+\\\\epsilon^{-1}*\\\\ln(n).  Uses of Randomized Weighted Majority Algorithm (RWMA)  The Randomized Weighted Majority Algorithm can be used to combine multiple algorithms in which case RWMA can be expected to perform nearly as well as the best of the original algorithms in hindsight. Furthermore, one can apply the Randomized Weighted Majority Algorithm in situations where experts are making choices that cannot be combined (or can't be combined easily). For example, RWMA can be applied to repeated game-playing or the online shortest path problem. In the online shortest path problem, each expert is telling you a different way to drive to work. You pick one path using RWMA. Later you find out how well you would have done using all of the suggested paths and penalize appropriately. To do this right, we want to generalize from \\"losses\\" of 0 or 1 to losses in [0,1]. The goal is to have an expected loss not much larger than the loss of the best expert. We can generalize the RWMA by applying a penalty of \\\\beta^{loss} (i.e. two losses of one half result in the same weight as one loss of 1 and one loss of 0). The analysis given in the previous section does not change significantly.

It is believed to be the oldest fountain in Rome, dating back, according to some sources, to the 8th century. The present fountain is the work of Donato Bramante, with later additions by Gian Lorenzo Bernini and Carlo Fontana. Maurizia Tazartes, Fontaines de Rome, pg. 48  History  A fountain is believed to have stood in this square since the 8th century, but the exact date it was built is unknown. The fountain is first mentioned in documents dating to the second half of the 15th century. A drawing of the fountain appears on the map of Rome made by Pietro del Massaio in 1471, along with a description of the legend of the fountain's origin. According to the legend, which appears in the Chronicle of Eusebius, translated and finished by Saint Jerome in the fifth century, on the night of the birth of Christ a fountain of oil appeared miraculously in front of the church, which as a result was given the name \\"Santa Maria in fontibus.\\" The original fountain was supplied with water by a Roman aqueduct, the Aqua Traiana. When the aqueduct was ruined during the invasions of Rome, water came from underground sources below the Janiculum hill. The old fountain illustrated in the drawing of del Massaio had two vasques, one above the other, pouring water into the basin below. Maurizia Tazartes, pg. 48 The fountain was reconstructed between 1499 and 1500 on the command of Giovanni Lopez, the bishop of Perouse and Bishop of the parish of Santa Maria in Trastevere, who gave the commission to Donato Bramante, the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. Bramante removed the upper vasque and added four carved stone wolf heads, the emblem of the Lopez family. The fountain was reconstructed again in 1604 by the architect Girolamo Rainaldi, the father of Carlo Rainaldi, the architect of the two churches of Piazza del Popolo. At that time the fountain was connected to the newly restored Acqua Felice aqueduct. In 1659 the fountain was connected to the Acqua Paola aqueduct and remodeled again by Bernini. Bernini replaced the octagonal basin, moved the fountain from its original place in front of the church to a new location in the center of the square, and added sculpted seashells around the basin. At the end of the 17th century, the architect Carlo Fontana replaced Bernini's seashells with his own sculpted seashells. The fountain was completely rebuilt in 1873, following the design of Bernini and Fontana, but using less expensive materials. In that occasion, the main pool was rebuilt with bardiglio marble and an imposing S.P.Q.R. sign has been placed on the external side of the shells. It was rebuilt once again in 1930. The last maintenance has been made in 1984.

Religious existentialism holds that there are two levels of reality, essence, which is the ground of being, and existence. Religion is the ultimate concern in this view. Atheistic existentialism Atheistic existentialism is best exemplified by Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, and Jean-Paul Sartre. It holds that there is one level of reality, existence.

Geoffrey and his brother took the surname Mandeville because of the lineage of their mother, Beatrice de Say, who was a granddaughter of Beatrice de Mandeville, the sister of Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex (d. 1144). The elder Beatrice inherited the Mandeville honor in 1189, on the death of her nephew William de Mandeville, 3rd Earl of Essex. Richard I of England allowed her lands and the earldom to pass to her granddaughter's husband Geoffrey fitz Peter. Their eldest son Geoffrey inherited the earldom of Essex from his father in 1213. His first marriage was to Matilda, daughter of Robert Fitzwalter, a member of the Clare family and one of the leaders of the opposition to King John. She died childless. In 1214, the new earl gained the earldom of Gloucester and much of the honor by right of marriage to Isabel of Gloucester. He was Isabel's second husband, her marriage to John I of England having been annulled many years earlier.

She is known for her contralto voice. Life and career Arean was born in Lisse and raised in Amsterdam. Her father was a waiter and her mother was the singer Conny Renoir. Her mother's mother was also a singer, Henny Verra. When Arean was 14 years old she saw a performance by the Dutch comedian Wim Sonneveld. At that moment she knew where she wanted to be: on stage. Her mother reckoned her too young for that and at the age of 15 Arean quit school and became a housekeeper. In 1960 she got employment at the ABC-cabaret, managed by Wim Kan and his wife Corry Vonk. Vonk suggested she change her name to Jenny Arean. In the late 1960s Arean played in plays, musicals (En nu naar bed by Annie M.G. Schmidt) and television series. From 1963 till 1973 she was married to the Dutch actor Huib Rooymans. They had one daughter, Myra, and divorced because Arean had an affair with her colleague Frans Halsema. In 1977 Arean and Halsema had a big hit with the song Vluchten kan niet meer. In the early 1980s Arean had a relationship with the Dutch journalist and writer Ischa Meijer. Together they played four productions all written by Meijer. He also stimulated her to play solo productions. In 1985 she played the first one in a long sequence: Gescheiden vrouw op oorlogspad.

At 17 age, she attended an AAGPBL tryout with about 200 girls in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Only nine of them made it to their destination, including Alderfer. She went to Chicago, Illinois for spring training after the night of her graduation. Most of her time in the AAGPBL was spent on the two touring training teams, the Springfield Sallies and Chicago Colleens, though she did stay with the Muskegon Lassies during five weeks in 1950.The Women of the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary - W.

Highlights of these tours included contests at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. and Yankee Stadium in New York. Alderfer played for them in 1949 (Sallies) and 1950 (Coleens). She was drafted again by the Lassies after moving to Kalamazoo in 1951, but her mother took ill and she decided to stay home and care for her. Alderfer believed the toughest pitcher she faced was Doris Sams and the best player she saw in action was Dottie Schroeder. \\"Playing baseball and being paid for having fun was great.

They include the Bavarian Prealp region between the river Loisach to the west and the river Inn to the east; the range is about long and wide. The term is not defined politically, but alpine-geographically because small areas of the Bavarian Prealps lie in Tyrol (e.g. the Hinteres Sonnwendjoch south of the Rotwand). The term is not to be confused with the Bavarian Alps or the Bavarian Alpine Foreland. These terms include the whole of the alpine region (together with parts of the Wetterstein, the Karwendel, etc.) and the whole Alpine Foreland on Bavarian state territory. Except in the Ester Mountains in the extreme west, the summits of the Bavarian Prealps are all below 2000 metres in height and only a few have prominent limestone cliffs.  Extent  The Herzogstand (1731 m) from the Heimgarten Plankenstein (1768 m) from the Risserkogel According to the 1984 classification of the Eastern Alps by the German Alpine Club the Bavarian Prealps are delineated as follows: Prealp region from Murnau via Kochel am See, Bad T√∂lz to Rosenheim ‚Äì Inn to Kiefersfelden ‚Äì Kieferbach ‚Äì Glemmbach ‚Äì Ellbach ‚Äì Kaiserhaus (in Brandenberg) ‚Äì Brandenberger Ache ‚Äì Erzherzog-Johann-Klause (at the Brandenberger Ache) ‚Äì Sattelbach ‚Äì Ampelsbach ‚Äì Achenbach ‚Äì Walchen ‚Äì Isar to Kr√ºn ‚Äì Kranzbach ‚Äì Kankerbach ‚Äì Garmisch-Partenkirchen ‚Äì Loisach to Murnau.  Subdivision  The westernmost part of the Bavarian Prealps is formed by the Ester Mountains and its highest peak, the Krottenkopf (), which is also the highest summit in the Prealps. To the northeast the range is enclosed by the Herzogstand and Heimgarten and the long ridge of the Benediktenwand. The eastern part of the Prealps between the rivers Isar and Inn is known as the Mangfall Mountains, because its streams ‚Äì the Rottach, Wei√üach, Schlierach and Leitzach ‚Äì all flow into the Mangfall river, which drains the whole area and forming an important groundwater store for the city of Munich. The highest peak in the eastern part of the Bavarian Prealps ‚Äì located on Austrian state territory in spite of the name ‚Äì is the Hinteres Sonnwendjoch at above sea level.  Neighbouring mountain ranges  The Bavarian Prealps border the following mountain ranges in the Alps: * Chiemgau Alps (to the east) * Kaiser Mountains (to the southeast) * Brandenberg Alps (to the south) * Karwendel (to the south) * Wetterstein mountains (to the southwest) * Ammergau Alps (to the west) To the north the Bavarian Prealps border on the Alpine Foreland.  Tourism = Mountain climbing  Many peaks in the Bavarian Prealps are part of Munich's Hausbergen (\\"home mountains\\") and may be climbed all year round on foot, by ski mountaineers or with snowshoes. There are good and simple, even family-friendly, routes to most of the summits. Several also offer scenic, generally well-protected climbing routes across a wide range of climbing grades (UIAA II to X): the Ro√üstein and Buchstein, Plankenstein (Direkter Ostgrat: IV+, Nadel S√ºdwand: X), Ruchenk√∂pfe (M√ºnchner Ri√ü: III, D√ºlfer Ri√ü: IV). A ski touring classic is the Rotwand-Reib'n, which runs up to the Rotwand.  Long-distance hiking trails  The Via Alpina, a cross- border long-distance trail with five route sections, runs over the entire Alps, including the Bavarian Prealps. The Violette Way of the Via Alpina runs in 9 stages through the Bavarian Prealps as follows: * Stage A51 runs from Oberaudorf to the Br√ºnnsteinhaus * Stage A52 runs from the Br√ºnnsteinhaus to the Rotwandhaus via the Ursprungtal * Stage A53 runs from the Rotwandhaus to Sutten via the Spitzingsee * Stage A54 runs from Sutten to Kreuth via the Risserkogel * Stage A55 runs from Kreuth to Lenggries via the Hirschbergh√ºtte and the Lenggrieser H√ºtte * Stage A56 runs from Lenggries to the Tutzinger H√ºtte via the Brauneck * Stage A57 runs from der Tutzinger H√ºtte to the Herzogstand via the Kesselbergh√∂he * Stage A58 runs from the Herzogstand to the Weilheimer H√ºtte via Eschenlohe * Stage A59 runs from der Weilheimer H√ºtte to Garmisch-Partenkirchen via the Wank The Munich‚ÄìVenice Dream Path (Traumpfad M√ºnchen‚ÄìVenedig), first publicised in 1977, also runs through the Bavarian Prealps. Although it is not an official long-distance path, it has become well known because so many walking clubs and states were involved in its creation. The third section of the Dream Path runs from Geretsried to the Brauneck Gipfelhaus via Bad T√∂lz and Lenggries. Most of this stage is located in the Alpine Foreland. The fourth stage runs from the Brauneck-Gipfelhaus via the Benediktenwand in the Jachenau. The fifth stage runs from the Jachenau to Vorderri√ü, where the path enters the Karwendel. The end point is at Hinterri√ü. In addition there is the Via Bavarica Tyrolensis, a cycle path from Munich to the Tyrol (see main article).

Arianna made her first appearance on April 15, 2009. In July 2009, it was announced that original actress Felisha Terrell had been axed from the soap and would be replaced by Lindsay Hartley. Hartley made her first on-screen appearance on August 28, 2009. In July 2010, it was announced that Hartley would be departing Days of our Lives and Arianna made her final appearance on November 8, 2010. Creation and development In March 2009, it was announced that television newcomer Felisha Terrell had joined the cast of Days of our Lives as Arianna Hernandez, the sister of established character Rafe Hernandez (Galen Gering). Despite Terrell signing a three-year contract, it was announced in July 2009 that she had been axed from the soap and would be replaced by former Passions actress Lindsay Hartley. Hartley began filming her scenes on the July 23. She and Gering previously played siblings Theresa and Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald in Passions. In July 2010, it was announced that Hartley had been axed from the soap, but would continue to appear throughout the summer months. In November 2010, Hartley told TV Guide magazine that she found the axing \\"tough\\" saying: \\"There was a period where I wasn't being used very much, where they had opportunities to go certain directions with my character and didn't, and it just wasn't happening. So I kind of had an idea that something was gonna go down.\\" Hartley was told in a storyline meeting that Arianna would be killed off, a decision that left her \\"completely shocked, devastated\\". Storylines Arianna first appears in Days of our Lives when Caroline Brady (Peggy McCay) hires her as a waitress at the Brady pub. She then moves to Salem. Soon after starting her job, Arianna reconnects with her older brother, Rafe, whom she has been estranged from. She meets Rafe's girlfriend, Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney) and takes an instant dislike to her after she learns that Rafe resigned from the FBI for her. Arianna meets recovering drug addict Brady Black (Eric Martsolf) and takes a liking to him, but refuses his offer of a date. She explains that she has been in relationships with drug addicts in the past and does not want to again. Arianna later agrees to a date with Brady and they have a picnic in the park. They then begin a relationship. Arianna uses the pub as a front to receive drugs and then sell them. Arianna meets Roman Brady (Josh Taylor) and is revealed to be working undercover for the Salem Police Department to find the root of drug distribution in Salem. Brady's grandfather, Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston) learns that Arianna is a drug dealer and forces her to end her relationship with Brady. She asks Roman if she can leave the investigation, but he says no. As time goes by EJ DiMera learns Arianna is working for him and he soon begins to favor Arianna over Troy due to her selling more drugs than Troy (Erik Fellows). Jealous of Arianna moving up the ladder in the drug cartel and EJ warning Troy that Arianna would take his spot, Troy hires a hitman to kill Arianna. Due to Mickey Horton's death, one day the pub is closed but Arianna decides to do inventory that day. Troy who had been watching the pub calls the hitman to take out Arianna. The hitman sneaks into the pub while Arianna is doing inventory and tries to rob and kill Arianna, but Brady chases him off. After the hit fails, Troy decides to kill Arianna himself. Troy breaks into the pub when Arianna is alone and sneaks into her room to kill her, but EJ arrives and saves her. Troy is arrested for attempted murder and Arianna is taken off the investigation, but not before Troy notices Arianna speaking to Roman and realizes she is working undercover, he warns EJ that Arianna is a snitch. Brady who is also at the police station asks EJ what Troy is talking about and EJ pretends to have no idea and denies he has ever met Troy. After this the drug cartel storyline is dropped. Brady proposes marriage and Arianna accepts. They travel to the Dominican Republic to marry, but Brady's ex-girlfriend Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker) follows them and attempts to reconcile with Brady. However, he refuses as he loves Arianna. A tropical storm stops the ceremony from taking place and they return to Salem. Nicole discovers that Dr. Richard Baker (John Callahan) is an associate of the Salem Mugger, who has been mugging several high-profile men. She makes him plant Arianna's hair at the crime scene. Arianna is then arrested and charged with multiple crimes. As she protests her innocence, Brady does not believe her and she ends their relationship. Lawyer EJ takes over Arianna's case and looks for evidence that Nicole framed her. Hope Brady (Kristian Alfonso) later confesses to the crimes after being under the influence of sleeping pills. Arianna overhears Sami confessing to shooting EJ and decides to tell him. She tells Rafe, who reveals that he already knows and supports Sami. Arianna agrees to meet with Sami to hear her side of the story. Sami explains why and when she shot EJ and Arianna video tapes her confession. After Arianna tells Sami that she is going to the police, Sami attacks her but she escapes. Sami calls her son Will Horton (Chandler Massey) and Rafe, telling them to stop Arianna. Will finds her at the pub and stops her telling EJ. Arianna runs away from Will onto the road, where she is hit by a car. Days later she dies in hospital from complications of the accident. After her death, Arianna's ghost haunts Sami with the truth about EJ's shooting. Arianna's sister, Gabi, honored her memory by naming her daughter after her.

It is edible and highly regarded as food, but is now rare over much of its range due to overfishing. Adults may grow to long, are camouflaged, and have no claws. They are nocturnal, emerging from caves and other shelters during the night to feed on molluscs. As well as being eaten by humans, S. latus is also preyed upon by a variety of bony fish. Its closest relative is S. herklotsii, which occurs off the Atlantic coast of West Africa; other species of Scyllarides occur in the western Atlantic Ocean and the Indo-Pacific. The larvae and young animals are largely unknown. Distribution Scyllarus latus is found along most of the coast of the Mediterranean Sea (one exception being the northern Adriatic Sea), and in parts of the eastern Atlantic Ocean from near Lisbon in Portugal south to Senegal, including the islands of Madeira, the Azores, the Selvagens Islands and the Cape Verde Islands. In Senegal, it occurs together with a related species Scyllarides herklotsii, which it closely resembles. Description S. latus can grow to a total body length about , although rarely more than . This is equivalent to a carapace length of up to . An individual may weigh as much as . As in all slipper lobsters, the second pair of antennae are enlarged and flattened into \\"shovels\\" or \\"flippers\\". Despite the name \\"lobster\\", slipper lobsters such as Scyllarides latus have no claws, and nor do they have the protective spines of spiny lobsters. Instead, the exoskeleton, and particularly the carapace, are thicker than in clawed lobsters and spiny lobsters, acting as resilient armour. Adults are cryptically coloured, and the carapace is covered in conspicuous, high tubercles. Ecology alt=Two limpets, two large marine snails, some barnacles and a bed of mussels vie for space. Substrate S. latus lives on rocky or sandy substrates at depths of . They shelter during the day in natural dens, on the ceilings of caves, or in reefs, preferring situations with more than one entrance or exit. Diet The diet of S. latus consists generally of molluscs. The preferred prey is, according to different sources, either limpets or bivalves. The prey, which S. latus can detect even under of sediment, is opened by careful use of the strong pointed pereiopods. They will also eat oysters and squid, but not sea urchins or muricid snails. They eat more in warmer seasons, getting through 3.2 oysters per day in July, but only 0.2 oysters per day in January. Predators The alt=A large, open-mouthed grey fish is held up by a man using both hands. The most significant predator of S. latus is the grey triggerfish, Balistes capriscus, although a number of other fish species have also been reported to prey on S. latus, including dusky groupers (Epinephelus guaza), combers (Serranus spp.), Mediterranean rainbow wrasse (Coris julis), red groupers (Epinephelus morio) and gag groupers (Mycteroperca microlepis). An Octopus vulgaris has been observed to eat S. latus in an artificial setting, but it is unclear whether S. latus is preyed on by octopuses in nature. Life cycle Male Scyllarus latus carry spermatophores at the base of the last two pairs of pereiopods in April. Fertilisation has not been observed in this species, but most reptant decapods mate with the ventral surfaces together. Between July and August, females carry around 100,000 eggs on their enlarged, feathery pleopods. The eggs develop from being a bright orange colour to a dark brown before being shed into the water after around 16 days of development. There is normally only one generation per year. The larvae are much less well known than the adults. An initial long naupliosoma stage, which swims using its antennae, moults into the first of eleven phyllosoma stages, which swim using their thoracic legs. The last phyllosoma stage may reach a size of and can be up to 11 months old; most of the intermediate phyllosoma stages have not been observed. A single nisto (juvenile has been recorded, having been caught off Reggio Calabria in 1900, but only recognised as being a juvenile S. latus in 2009. Young adults are also rare; a museum specimen with a carapace length of is the smallest adult yet observed. Adults moult annually, and probably migrate to cooler waters with a temperature of to do so. The old exoskeleton softens over a period of 10‚Äì22 days before being shed, and the new, pale exoskeleton takes around three weeks to harden completely. Smaller individuals typically gain weight over the course of a moult, but this difference is less pronounced in larger animals. Behaviour Scyllarides latus is mostly nocturnal in the wild, since most of its predators are diurnal. While sheltering, S. latus tends to be gregarious, with several individuals sharing the same shelter. When confronted with a predator, S. latus has no claws or spines to repel the predator, and instead either clings to the substrate, or swims away with powerful flexion of the abdomen, or \\"tail-flips\\". Larger lobsters can exert a stronger grip than smaller ones, with a force of up to 150 newtons (equivalent to a weight of ) required to dislodge the largest individuals. Predator avoidance may also explain the frequent behaviour where S. latus will carry food items back to a shelter before consuming them. When two S. latus individuals compete for a food item, they may use the enlarged second antennae to flip their opponent over, by wedging the antennae underneath the opponent's body and quickly raising them. An alternative strategy is to grip an opponent and begin the tail-flipping movement, or to engage in a tug of war. Taxonomy Scyllarides latus was originally classified in the genus Scyllarus, along with the four other slipper lobsters known at the time (Scyllarus arctus, Scyllarides aequinoctialis, Thenus orientalis and Arctides guineensis). Separate genera were first introduced by William Elford Leach in 1815, namely Thenus and Ibacus. In 1849, Wilhem de Haan divided the genus Scyllarus into two genera, Scyllarus and Arctus, but made the error of including the type species of Scyllarus in the genus Arctus. This was first recognised by the ichthyologist Theodore Gill in 1898, who synonymised Arctus with Scyllarus, and erected a new genus Scyllarides to hold the species that De Haan had placed in Scyllarus. Scyllarides is placed in the subfamily Arctidinae, which is differentiated from other subfamilies by the presence of multiarticulated exopods on all three maxillipeds, and a three-segmented palp on the mandible. The only other genus in the subfamily, Arctides, is distinguished by having a more highly sculptured carapace, with an extra spine behind each eye, and a transverse groove on the first segment of the abdomen. The only other species of Scyllarides to occur in the Eastern Atlantic is Scyllarides herklotsii, which differs from S. latus mostly in the ornamentation on the carapace; while in S. latus the tubercles (lumps projecting from the surface) are high and pronounced, they are lower and more rounded in S. herklotsii. Type specimen The alt=A flattish brown crustacean with large flattened antennae on a plain background. The type locality given by Pierre Andr√© Latreille in his original description of the species was simply \\"Mediterran√©e\\" (Mediterranean Sea), without designating a type specimen. Lipke Holthuis later chose a lectotype for the species, which was the animal illustrated by Cornelius Sittardus, and published in Conrad Gesner's Historiae animalium in 1558 (book 4, p. 1097). This illustration, originally a watercolour but reproduced by Gesner in a woodcut, had been mentioned by Latreille in his description as being particularly fine, and is all that remains of the type specimen. Given that Sittardus was working in Rome at the time, it is likely that the type specimen was a fresh specimen from the Tyrrhenian Sea near Rome. Human consumption S. latus is edible, but it is a relatively rare species, and is therefore of little interest to fisheries. However, it is caught in small numbers throughout its distribution, mostly in trammel nets, by trawling and in lobster pots. An annual catch of has been reported for Israel. Catching by hand has become increasingly frequent, since the advent of SCUBA diving made the animal's habitat more accessible to humans. This may have affected population sizes of S. latus in some areas.

A commission set up by the Indian political leader Mahatma Gandhi supported her claim, while another report by researcher Bal Chand Nahata disputed it. Subsequently, several other researchers interviewed her, and published articles and books about her. Reincarnation claim Shanti Devi was born in Delhi, India. As a little girl in the 1930s, she began to claim to remember details of a past life. According to these accounts, when she was about four years old, she told her parents that her real home was in Mathura where her husband lived, about 145 km from her home in Delhi. Discouraged by her parents, she ran away from home at age six, trying to reach Mathura. Back home, she stated in school that she was married and had died ten days after having given birth to a child. Interviewed by her teacher and headmaster, she used words from the Mathura dialect and divulged the name of her merchant husband, \\"Kedar Nath\\". The headmaster located a merchant by that name in Mathura who had lost his wife, Lugdi Devi, nine years earlier, ten days after having given birth to a son. Kedar Nath traveled to Delhi, pretending to be his own brother, but Shanti Devi immediately recognized him and Lugdi Devi's son. As she knew several details of Kedar Nath's life with his wife, he was soon convinced that Shanti Devi was indeed the reincarnation of Lugdi Devi.L. D. Gupta, N. R. Sharma, T. C. Mathur, An Inquiry into the Case of Shanti Devi, International Aryan League, Delhi, 1936 The case was brought to the attention of Mahatma Gandhi who set up a commission to investigate. The commission traveled with Shanti Devi to Mathura, arriving on 15 November 1935. There she recognized several family members, including the grandfather of Lugdi Devi. She found out that Kedar Nath had neglected to keep a number of promises he had made to Lugdi Devi on her deathbed. She then traveled home with her parents. The commission's report, published in 1936, concluded that Shanti Devi was indeed the reincarnation of Lugdi Devi. Two further reports were written at the time. The report by Bal Chand Nahata was published as a Hindi booklet by the name Punarjanma Ki Paryalochana. In this, he stated that \\"'Whatever material that has come before us, does not warrant us to conclude that Shanti Devi has 'former life recollections or that this case proves reincarnation\\".Nahata, Bal Chand. Punarjanma Ki Paryyalochana. Calcutta: Buddiwadi Songh. (Undated.) This argument was disputed by Indra Sen in an article later.Sen, Indra. \\"Shantidevi Further Investigated\\". Proceedings of the India Philosophical Congress. 1938 A further report, based on interviews conducted in 1936, was published in 1952.Bose, Suskil C. A Case of Reincarnation, Calcutta: Satsang, 1952 Shanti Devi did not marry. She told her story again at the end of the 1950s, and once more in 1986 when she was interviewed by Ian Stevenson and K.S. Rawat. In this interview she also related her near death experiences when Lugdi Devi died. K.S. Rawat continued his investigations in 1987, and the last interview took place only four days before her death on 27 December 1987.

Characteristics Scyllarides is placed in the subfamily Arctidinae, which is differentiated from other subfamilies by the presence of multiarticulated exopods on all three maxillipeds, and a three-segmented palp on the mandible. The only other genus in the subfamily, Arctides, is distinguished by having a more highly sculptured carapace, with an extra spine behind each eye, and a transverse groove on the first segment of the abdomen. Taxonomic history In 1849, Wilhem de Haan divided the genus Scyllarus into two genera, Scyllarus and Arctus, but made the error of including the type species of Scyllarus in the genus Arctus.

Generally a progressive parlay involves a joint wager on four to twelve separate events. Should all the selected bets win, the bettor receives a relatively large payout, because of the sizable odds against this happening. However, unlike a regular parlay, if some of the individual bets lose, but most win, the bettor still wins, although with a much smaller payout. Several sites use a schedule where the bettor can lose one bet on a 4-6 event progressive parlay, can lose up to two bets on a 7-9 event progressive parlay, and up to three bets on a 10-12 event progressive parlay. The term has also been used for a long series of wagers on roulette or other gambling games, where the bettor attempts to rely on a \\"stream of luck\\". Strategies Several strategies have been suggested by gambling consultants when wagering on parlays or progressive parlays, one of them being to pick interrelated outcomes. For example, a bettor may believe that one team is likely to win if the game is a low-scoring affair while the other team is almost certain to win if the game becomes a high scoring shootout. If the bettor uses a parlay to bet on the first team along with an under bet against the point total, he stands to gain 2.6 units ($260 if $100 is bet) on an original investment of 1 unit (the most common unit in betting is $100 although any amount can be substituted as a unit) compared to a payout of just 1.82 units ($182) if the bets are made independently of each other. Conversely, if both outcomes are missed, one will only lose his original 1 unit investment rather than the 2 units one would lose if it had wagered on the events individually. This minimized risk is another notable potential positive of a parlay. If a bettor wishes to bet on a significant number of events without putting a substantial amount of his total bankroll at stake, parlays may represent an attractive option. By turning 12 individual events into four 3 event parlays, the bettor reduces the number of units he is risking from 12 to 4 while simultaneously increasing his potential payout if all events are correctly picked.

In the story, a mouse's life is a spared by a lion. Later, after the lion is trapped, the mouse is able to set the lion free. Adapting the fable, with the moral that the weak can help the strong, as a wordless picture book was seen as a successful way of overcoming the brief plot generally found in the source stories. While it was Pinkney's first wordless picture book, it was not the first time he had told the story, having previously included it in his Aesop's Fables, published in 2000. Pinkney, who had received five Caldecott Honors, became the first African American to win the Caldecott Medal for his illustrations in the book. His illustrations were generally praised for their realism and sense of place. The cover illustrations, featuring the title characters but no text, drew particular praise.  Background and publication  This book is the second time Pinkney has told this story, the first being as part of his 2000 compendium of Aesop's Fables. When creating this book it was important for Pinkney to balance retelling a classic story and expressing the African-American experience. He also wanted to show that a fable could be \\"action packed\\" and not just moralistic. The story is Pinckney's favorite fable and he felt that the characters of the mouse and the \\"majestic lion\\" were particularly relatable for children. For Pinkney a wordless version seemed like a natural evolution of the \\"sparse\\" versions of the story he had seen elsewhere. It was Pinkney's first wordless picture book, although he began creating it intending to include words and it was only after completing the illustrations that he realized it could be wordless. When he showed it to his editor he gave her a version that included onomatopoetic animals sounds and one without; they both agreed that the animals sounds improved the story, with Pinkney commenting that, \\"[t]hese sounds surround me with a continuity and motion and energy ... It's nature speaking\\". Pinkney hoped that the story would inspire its readers to think of its African setting, the Serengeti, as a place that people need to pay attention to and save. The book was published on September 1, 2009 by Little, Brown Books for Young Readers. An audio book featuring atmospheric sounds and music by Sazi Dlamini was released in 2011 by Weston Woods Studios; it is designed to be listened to together with the book.  Plot  In a book where the only words are the sounds made by the animals, the story begins at dawn. A mouse escapes several predators before coming upon a lion. The lion lets the mouse go. Later, some hunters come along and capture the lion with a net. The mouse chews through the rope of the net, freeing the lion.  Illustrations and design  Pinkney illustrated the book using \\"pencil, watercolor, and colored pencils on paper.\\" This method helps, in the words of The Horn Book Magazine review, to provide, \\"pleasing detail\\".J. R. L. (2009). The Lion & the Mouse. Horn Book Magazine, 85(6), 658‚Äì659. Retrieved from ebscohost. The book is unusual in that it does not have any text on its front dust cover, just the picture of the lion, though this is something that the book's publisher had done before.Giorgis, C. (2012). The Art of Picture Books. Book Links, 22(2), 4‚Äì9. Retrieved from ebscohost. The back cover features the mouse, such that when the book is opened the mouse and the lion look at each other. The events of the story further the personality traits shown during the course of the story; the lion is powerful while the mouse is curious and alert.Long, J. R. (2010). Caldecott 2010. Horn Book Magazine, 86(4), 10‚Äì16. Retrieved from ebscohost. These personalities are shown through the animals' body parts that are illustrated in close-up. The book's illustrations of the Serengeti were seen as well-researched and carefully drawn. Part of this is that the illustrations of the animals are drawn in correct proportion to each other. While the perspective is drawn at human eye- level, the reader is encouraged to think of other perspectives, such as to look down to notice details like the mouse.Hagan, M. (2016). The Lion and the Mouse. Critical Survey of Children‚Äôs Literature: Plot Summaries, 86‚Äì87. Retrieved from ebscohost.The Lion & the Mouse. (2009). Kirkus Reviews, 77(15), 140. Retrieved from ebscohost. Further, the animals are able to convey emotions without becoming personified. Pinkney's use of panels in select moments drew comparisons to that of a silent movie and helped to convey the pace and intensity of the action. Other elements of the design, such as Pinkney's use of white space, also enhance the mood and quality of the book.  Story and themes  By making a nearly wordless picture book, Pinkney is able to overcome the challenge faced when adapting Aesop's fables, of using a short story and writing a full length book out of it. Several critics commented on how this format requires great imagination and investment from the reader in order to follow the story. Wendy Lukeheart writing in School Library Journal suggested that, \\"the lack of words in this version allows for a slower, subtle, and ultimately more satisfying read\\".Lukehart, W. (2009, September). Pinkney, Jerry. The Lion & the Mouse. School Library Journal, 55(9), 146. Retrieved from Gale Group. The book's theme of how the \\"powerful can crush the weak\\" was seen as particularly timely. Unlike in many retellings of the story, in this wordless book the mouse is unable to vocally bargain with the lion. Yet the story is still able to capture the original story's message \\"that definitions of meek and might are simply a matter of perspective\\". Through their respective strengths and weaknesses the lion and the mouse are able to find a need to collaborate and even be friends. Pinkney was also interested in exploring the setting of the story and the characters' families.The Lion & the Mouse. (2009). Publishers Weekly, 256(30), 61. Retrieved from ebscohost. The \\"temptation, danger, and choice\\" the characters have to face could suggest an Garden of Eden-like setting, according to Horn Book.G. M. (2011). The Lion & the Mouse.

The Horn Book Magazine, Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, and School Library Journal all gave the book starred reviews and included it in their best books of the year lists. The New York Times and Children's Book Council were among those who named it as one of the best books of 2009. Megan Cox Gurdon of The Wall Street Journal called it, \\"a beautiful recapitulation of an Aesop fable\\". Amanda Craig in The Times described the book as \\"exquisite\\". The book won the 2010 Caldecott Medal, something which had been widely predicted. The committee cited how, \\"[i]n glowing colors, Pinkney's textured watercolor illustrations masterfully portray the relationship between two very unlikely friends.\\" Pinkney expressed his surprise at actually winning the Caldecott, after having drawn five honor books. In his acceptance speech, Pinkney discussed what might have sparked his interest in the story, spoke at length about its creation, and his \\"deep feeling of satisfaction\\" over children \\"claiming ownership\\" of the fable.

His shrine was located on the Velian Hill, supposedly since the founding of Rome, until the 1st century BC. During preliminary marriage rites, Roman brides are supposed to have straddled the phallus of Mutunus to prepare themselves for intercourse, according to Church Fathers who interpreted this act as an obscene loss of virginity.H.J. Rose, The Roman Questions of Plutarch: A New Translation (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924, reprinted 1974), p. 84 online. The Christian apologist Arnobius says that Roman matrons were taken for a ride (inequitare) on Tutunus's \\"awful phallus\\" with its \\"immense shameful parts\\",Arnobius, Adversus nationes 4.7 (see also 4.11): Tutunus, cuius immanibus pudendis horrentique fascino vestras inequitare matronas et auspicabile ducitis et optatis.

Parker, Priapea: Poems for a Phallic God (Routledge, 1988), p. 135 online, observes that the ritual of Mutunus was \\"condemned by early Church fathers\\"; Joseph Rykwert, The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy, and the Ancient World (MIT Press, 1988), p. 159 online, notes that they spoke \\"scathingly\\" of phallic rituals. Tertullian's bias in his assemblage of deities to deride (including Mutunus) pointed out by Mary Beard, John North et al., Religions of Rome: A Sourcebook (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 359, note 1 online. The fascinum ‚Äî identified by Arnobius with the phallus of Mutunus ‚Äî \\"was used by Christian writers in their tirades against pagan customs,\\" points out Enrique Montero Cartelle, El lat√≠n er√≥tico: aspectos l√©xicos y literarios (University of Seville, 1991), p. 70 online. For a fuller discussion, see Carlos A. Contreras, \\"Christian Views of Paganism,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.23.1 (1980) 974‚Äì1022, p. 1013 online specifically in relation to Mutunus and in general asserting that \\"Arnobius commits the same mistake as other Fathers of applying Christian conceptions to pagan ideas in order to condemn them\\" (p. 1010). \\"Our knowledge of such things,\\" that is, of rites such as those of Mutunus, \\"comes from Christian writers who are openly concerned to discredit all aspects of pagan idolatry,\\" states Peter Stewart, Statues in Roman Society: Representation and Response (Oxford University Press, 2003), p. 266, note 24 online. Etymology Unlike Priapus, who is depicted in human form with an outsized erection, Mutunus seems to have been embodied purely by the phallus, like the fascinus or the mysterious begetter of Servius Tullius. The god's name is related to two infrequently recorded slang words for penis in Latin, m≈´t≈ç (or mutt≈ç) and m≈´t≈çnium.J.N. Adams, The Latin Sexual Vocabulary (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1982, 1990), p. 62 online. \\"Mutto\\" was also used as a cognomen, the third of the three elements of a Roman man's name.CIL V.1412, 8473, as cited by Adams. The moneyer Quintus Titius, one of whose coins has been interpreted as depicting Mutunus, may have used the cognomen Mutto; T.R.S. Broughton, The Magistrates of the Roman Republic (American Philological Association, 1952), vol. 2, p. 454. Lucilius offers the earliest recorded instance of both forms: at laeva lacrimas muttoniMutt≈çni is the dative form of mutt≈ç. absterget amica (\\"A girlfriend wipes away Mutto's tears ‚Äî his left hand, that is\\"),Lucilius 307 and 959. Kirk Freundenburg has dubbed the mutt≈ç of Lucilius \\"clearly the least finicky of all personified penises in Roman satire\\": Satires of Rome: Threatening Poses from Lucilius to Juvenal (Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 205 online. The left hand was preferred for masturbation by the Romans; see Antonio Varone, Erotica pompeiana: Love Inscriptions on the Walls of Pompeii (¬´L'Erma¬ª di Bretschneider, 2002), p. 95 online. and the derivative m≈´t≈çnium. M≈´t≈çnium may have replaced the earlier form, as it appears later among the graffiti of Pompeii.CIL IV.1939, 1940. Horace has a dialogue with his mutt≈ç: \\"What do you want? Surely you're not demanding a grand consul's granddaughter as a cunt?\\"Horace, Sermones 1.2.68. Both Lucilius and Horace thus personify the mutt≈ç.Adams, Latin Sexual Vocabulary, p. 63. M≈´t≈´niƒÅtus, used by Martial and in the Corpus Priapeorum,Martial, Epigrams 3.73.1 and 11.63.2; Corpus Priapeorum 52.10. describes a \\"well-endowed\\" male.Craig Arthur Williams, Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity (Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 92 online. Both parts of the name M≈´t≈´nus T≈´t≈´nus are reduplicative, Tƒ´tƒ´nus perhaps from tƒ´tus, another slang word for \\"penis.\\"Adams, Latin Sexual Vocabulary, p. 32. Cult The shrine of Mutunus Tutunus on the Velia has not been located. According to Festus, it was destroyed to make a private bath for the pontifex and Augustan supporter Domitius Calvinus, even though it was revered as among the most ancient landmarks.Festus 142L, as cited and discussed by Lawrence Richardson, A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 262 online. See also Ronald Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford University Press, 1989), p. 6 online. This uprooting raises the question of why Calvinus was permitted to displace such a venerable shrine. The Church Fathers associate Mutunus with groupings of other deities that are assumed to be based on the lost theological works of Varro. Through examining these connections, Robert Palmer concluded that the old cult of Mutunus was merged with that of Father Liber, who was variously identified with or shared attributes with Jupiter, Bacchus, and Lampsacene Priapus. Palmer further conjectured that it was Mutunus, in the form of Liber, to whom Julius Caesar made sacrifice on the day of his assassination, receiving the ill omens that the conspirator Decimus Brutus urged him to ignore. Caesar had previously celebrated his victory at the Battle of Munda on the Liberalia, or festival of Liber held March 17, and he visited the house of the pontifex Calvinus on the Ides of March, near the archaic shrine of Mutunus-Liber. In Palmer's view, the evident ill favor of the god gave Augustus license to reform the cult during his program of religious revivalism that often disguised radical innovations. The god was then Hellenized as Bacchus Lyaeus.Robert E.A. Palmer, \\"Mutinus Titinus: A Study in Etrusco-Roman Religion and Topography,\\" in Roman Religion and Roman Empire: Five Essays (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1974), pp. 187‚Äì206. Palmer concurred with numismatists who regard a denarius minted by Quintus Titius, moneyer ca. 90‚Äì88 BC, as picturing an aged and bearded Mutunus on its obverse.The identification dates back at least to Ch. Lenormant, \\"Types des m√©dailles romaines,\\" Revue numismatique (1838), pp. 11‚Äì12 online. The winged diadem is a reference to the Priapus of Lampsacus and to the winged phallus as a common motif in Roman decorative arts, which can also serve as an apotropaic charm against the evil eye. Another issue by Titius pictures an ivy-crowned Bacchus, with both denarii having a virtually identical Pegasus on the reverse. Michael Crawford finds \\"no good grounds\\" for identifying this figure as Mutunus,Michael Crawford, Roman Republican Coinage (Cambridge University Press, 1974, 2001), vol. 1, pp. 344 and 346 online. but Palmer points to the shared iconography of the Bacchus‚ÄìLiber‚ÄìPriapus figure and the associative etymology of the gens name Titius. A titus (\\"penis\\") with wings was a visual pun, since the word also referred to a type of bird.Scholiast on Persius, Satire 1.20; Adams, Latin Sexual Vocabulary, p. 32. Varro seems to have associated Titinus with the Titii, in an etymological collocation that included Titus Tatius, the royal Sabine contemporary of Romulus; the Curia Titia; or the tribus of the Titienses, one of the three original tribes of Rome.Palmer, \\"Mutinus Titinus,\\" p. 190.

Aloysius, Croat. Lujo) (≈†ibenik, Dalmatia, now Croatia 1813-1898) was a medical doctor and politician who served as the Chief Municipal Physician of ≈†ibenik, and also as the mayor and political and social activist of ≈†ibenik, Dalmatia. His special political and social efforts were related to improving the infrastructure and modernizing the city of ≈†ibenik, as well as speaking in favor of preservation of Roman Catholic Diocese of ≈†ibenik in 1872. He also contributed to collecting and preserving of people's proverbs in region of ≈†ibenik. His inaugural dissertation on rabies from 1840 represents an expample of conceptions of that disease in first half of 19th century, before Louis Pasteur's time. Origins Luigi Frari came from an illustrious ≈†ibenik medical family. His grandfather Giuseppe Frari came from Treviso, Republic of Venice (now Veneto), to ≈†ibenik, Dalmatia (now Croatia), where he became the Chief Municipal Physician and the author of a work on rabies published in 1782 in Ancona: \\"Riflessioni teorico-mediche sopra una grave malattia, l'istoria della quale far√† vedere li sintomi che precedettero (...)\\" (Ancona, Presso Pietro Ferri 1783). That work is considered to be the first publication on rabies written on territory of modern Croatia. His father Sebastiano was also the Chief Municipal Physician of ≈†ibenik. His uncle Angelo Antonio Frari was Chief Municipal Physician of Split, famous epidemiologist, historian of medicine and the protomedicus of Venice, whose son Michele Carlo Frari was an illustrious professor of obstetrics at Padua University.  Dissertation on Rabies  In 1840 in Vienna Luigi (\\"Aloysius\\") Frari published his inaugural dissertation at the Padua University about rabies ‚ÄúDe rabie canina‚Äù. It was the second inaugural dissertation on subject of rabies that was written by an author from the territory of modern Croatia, and it contained an overall description of the disease, ways of transmission, symptoms, clinical course, and the methods od curing, nursing and preventing the transmission. The dissertation was, doubtlessly in a great deal inspired by his grandfather Giuseppe Frari's pioneer work on rabies from 1782.  Political and Social Work in ≈†ibenik  However, perhaps, more than for his medical work, Luigi Frari was famous for his political and social activity and writing. He was the mayor of ≈†ibenik and is especially remembered for his work in improving the town‚Äôs infrastructure. As a mayor (‚Äúil Podest√†‚Äù), Frari also fought against a possible abolition of the Diocese of ≈†ibenik in 1872. In an article published in ‚ÄúLa Dalmazia Cattolica,‚Äù addressed directly to the Austrian Emperor, Luigi Frari provided substantial religious and civil arguments for preserving the Roman Catholic Diocese of ≈†ibenik. Luigi Frari was also the president of the ≈†ibenik Theatre Society, which financed and built ≈†ibenik ‚ÄúMazzoleni‚Äù Theater in 1870, one of the oldest in Croatia. He was a well known member of ≈†ibenik‚Äôs intellectual and social elite of that time, who collaborated with Niccolo Tommaseo in gathering Slavic people proverbs in the ≈†ibenik region. Although he was a Dalmatian autonomist, the radical autonomists at that time criticized him to be ‚Äúa man of mild colors‚Äù.  Post-mortem Sonnet  After his death on 19 March 1898, his unknown friend, signed as ‚ÄúUn amico,‚Äù published a sonnet about him. The document, written originally in Dalmatian-Venetian (translation into English by Anton Krniƒá) is the property of Roksanda Smolƒçiƒá from Zagreb and it was presumably also published in ‚ÄúIl Dalmata‚Äù in 1898: Sacred old man, tender like seraphim Husband, father, citizen, brother Upon your bier* a kiss of esteem Upon your cold coffin tears and flower You were gentle, good, you were faithful Like Gabriel the angel resembling I try to soothe, in this painful Part of earth, my cry and suffering The tired eyes are forever closed But your spirit noble and devout Flied bright and pure to bosom of the Lord And in your silent grave, in autumn and spring Sacred old man, of hair white, Dream in peace your dream everlasting *bier n, ‚Äúbara‚Äù in Venetian, is the old English word for a movable plane on which a coffin or a corps is placed (according to Metcalf J, Thompson D, editors.

Introduced in 1866, they were the first locomotives of this wheel arrangement to be built for an English railway. History Until 1864 the South Eastern Railway had very few tank locomotives. In that year the 205 class 0-4-2T locomotives were introduced, for use on the London suburban passenger services; they were designed by James I. Cudworth, the company's locomotive superintendent. They performed well, but their capabilities were restricted by the small fuel and water capacities; so after twelve of these were in service, Cudworth produced an enlarged version of the design. With the fuel capacity raised from to and the water capacity raised from to , the extra weight and length that this required behind the cab made it necessary to support the rear of the locomotive on a bogie in place of the single rear axle, producing an 0-4-4T - the first of that wheel arrangement to be built for an English railway (the first Scottish railway to use the 0-4-4T wheel arrangement was the Caledonian, in 1873). There were compensating levers to equalise the weight between the coupled axles, and the outside-framed bogie also had compensating levers; it carried about a third of the locomotive's weight. Like the 205 class, they burned coke as a fuel. At first, they were mainly used on the services to . Only one batch (of seven) was built, in 1866; there were troubles with the bogie, and so when more were required, Cudworth once more used the 0-4-2T type, producing the 73 class.

It is often known as Lausanne CFF to distinguish it from others in the town. Description Lausanne is a through station, which sits at the junction of the Simplon, Lausanne‚ÄìBern, and Lausanne‚ÄìGeneva railway lines. Due to this, express passenger trains are available to a wide variety of destinations across the country. Passenger trains are primarily run by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS), with additional international trains run by companies from neighbouring France (TGV Lyria). There is also a network of local services from Lausanne, primarily as part of the RER Vaud, and platforms for line 2 of the Lausanne M√©tro. The metro station, Lausanne-Gare, was opened on 27 October 2008. Passenger facilities include Bureau de change, left luggage and lost property offices. Developments Significant improvements are planned for the station by 2020. A third subway is to be constructed for platform access, along with longer platforms to allow larger trains. A new tunnel is also to be built for the Lausanne M√©tro directly underneath the Renens (West) end of the main line station, with new m√©tro platforms directly connected to the subway, removing the need for some m√©tro passengers to cross the square in front of the station.

The population of this Rossendale ward at the 2011 census was 3,789. Stacksteads includes a mountain bike trail called Lee Quarry which had originally been a working quarry. It is part of the Rossendale and Darwen constituency, with Jake Berry having been the Member of Parliament since 2010. History In the 19th century it was home to several cotton mills along the banks of the River Irwell. These expanded after the ending of the American Civil War. During the 1870s agricultural labourers moved from across the UK ‚Äì including many from East Anglia ‚Äì to drive this expansion. During the 20th century, as the cotton trade decreased in the face of overseas manufacture, some of the mills were adapted to more modern purposes such as footwear ‚Äì notably the Bacup Shoe Company in the former Stacksteads Mill. In the 1980s, the village featured in a number of episodes of the long running BBC1 police procedural drama series Juliet Bravo, set in a fictional part of the Rossendale Valley between Rawtenstall and Bacup. It was also the location for the filming of Laurence Olivier Presents: Hindle Wakes, a 1976 version of the stage play, directed by Laurence Olivier. Today The area is today noted for a high number of reported UFO sightings and featured in one episode of a 2008 Five TV series on British cases. A case from Stacksteads was also covered in the 1981 ITV children's TV series, The Final Frontier. Reports have focused on the quarry and the wider steep valley either side of Newchurch Road. This area has even been locally dubbed 'UFO Alley'. Jenny Randles, author of many books on UFOs, from 1979 onward, was born here and lived on Church Street. Stacksteads has a Rosso Bus 464 going through it every 10 minutes via the main road through the village, Newchurch Road. There is a secondary school called The Valley Leadership Academy. Stacksteads is home to the famous Kimberley Club formed in 1897 as a drinking club for quarry workers. Lit and warmed by gas (no electricity), it is still going strong and sells real ale direct from the barrel. From 1903 until 2011 Stacksteads Cricket Club played on Waterbarn Recreation Ground adjacent to Waterbarn Baptist Church. The club moved to New Hall Hey Cricket Ground in nearby Rawtenstall after difficulties with the landlord who also owns the Grade 2 listed Waterbarn Baptist Chapel on Brandwood Road built in 1847.

In clerical sense, Laskiainen is associated with Shrove Tuesday (a.k.a. Fat Tuesday) and is a celebration of the beginning of Lent that takes place before Easter. In Northern Europe, this tradition has been practiced from at least the 7th century onward, and in Catholic countries ‚Äì in form of carnivals ‚Äì even before that. The traditions of Laskiainen consist largely of merrymaking and feasts. Food-items typically enjoyed in Finland in Laskiainen include in many cases pea soup with ham, and cheeses. The best-known after- meal dessert of Laskiainen, often enjoyed either with coffee or tea, is Fat Tuesday Pulla (Finnish: Laskiaispulla) ‚Äì a.k.a. Shrove bun, or semla ‚Äì, which is a sweet roll filled with almond-paste or strawberry jam, and whipped cream. In North America too, it is traditional in Laskiainen to have a meal of split- pea soup with ham, and for amusement ‚Äì as in Finland ‚Äì to slide down a hill on either snow-covered or iced tracks, often on toboggans. One of the places where Laskiainen is celebrated outside Europe in form of an annual festival is the community of Palo, located between Aurora and Makinen on the shores of Loon Lake in Minnesota.

The relative stereochemistry was not elucidated in the original publication, structural analysis using X-rays or NMR was not available in these days. In the absence of ammonia or ammonium salts a 4-oxotetrahydropyran is formed.P. Petrenko-Kritschenko \\"√úber Tetrahydropyronverbindungen\\" Journal f√ºr Praktische Chemie; Volume 60, Issue 1, pages 140‚Äì158, 27 December 1899; Petrenko-Kritschenko type cyclizations In contrast to the Robinson synthesis, it does not employ dialdehydes like succinaldehyde or glutaraldehyde but simpler aldehydes like benzaldehyde. Therefore, the product of the reaction is not a bicyclic structure (see tropinone and pseudopelletierine) but a 4-piperidone. The synthesis of tropinone can be seen as a variation of the Petrenko-Kritschenko reaction in which the two aldehyde functions are covalently linked in a single molecule. Apart from the Hantzsch synthesis the Petrenko-Kritschenko reaction is one of the few examples in which a symmetric pyridine precursor can be obtained in a multicomponent ring-condensation reaction followed by an oxidation. The oxidation by chromium trioxide in acetic acid leads to a symmetrically substituted 4-pyridone, decarboxylation yields the 3,5-unsubstituted derivative. Modern variants Acetoacetate can be used instead of diethyl-Œ±- ketoglurate in the presence of indium salts.Clarke, Paul A.; Zaytzev, Andrey V.; Whitwood, Adrian C. \\"Pot, atom and step economic (PASE) synthesis of highly functionalized piperidines: a five-component condensation\\" Tetrahedron Letters Volume 48, Issue 30, 23 July 2007, Pages 5209‚Äì5212; The use of aniline has also been reported in the original Publication.

Looney Tunes animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on December 15, 1951, and stars Tweety and Sylvester. Plot Sylvester is in Yellowstone National Park and, hearing birds chirping, climbs up the tree to Tweety's nest, despite the ranger's warnings. Unfortunately, he hasn't hatched, so Sylvester must wait him out. Once Tweety does hatch, he decides to poke the cat in the butt with a pin needle, to get him off. Sylvester then gives chase, with Tweety hiding in a hole in the tree; the cat forces him out with an air pump, but Tweety sends up a stick of dynamite instead. The chase then continues to another tree, with Tweety sawing the branch Sylvester is on. Some time later, Tweety is singing about what Sylvester would want with him, while Sylvester sits below, scarred and bruised at attempting to scale the barbed wire. Sylvester hacks the tree down, only to have it fall on himself. Later, people are taking pictures of Tweety, who is perched on a tree stump. Sylvester, disguised as a cameraman, moves up close to Tweety, pops his head through the camera lens and eats him, only to spit him out thanks to the park ranger who catches him in the act, then bashes him in the head for violating the park's rule. The next attempt involves Tweety hiding in Old Faithful's geyser, which would erupt exactly when the clock below turns to 12:00. He sets the clock to 12:30 and jumps in, while Tweety sets the clock to 12:00, the time it erupts, forcing the cat upward. Tweety then hops on a log and starts rowing down a river, with Sylvester close behind in a rowboat. However, there is a waterfall ahead; Tweety jumps off, but Sylvester does not, and he desperately tries to row upward once he realizes where he is. Tweety offers assistance by turning on the emergency control; this merely causes Sylvester, not yet in safe waters, he waves goodbye and falls down. Tweety then comments that Sylvester is going to hurt himself if he is not more careful.

It was active in 1847 and 1848. Background At the beginning of the Mexican American War, Congress changed its policy of attempting to prosecute the war with the Regular Army and ordered nine new regiments: eight infantry and the Regiment of Voltigeurs and Foot Riflemen. The regiment was authorized on February 11, 1847 and the first officers, the colonel and the lieutenant colonel, were assigned on February 16, 1847. Organization The regiment was commanded by Colonel Timothy P. Andrews; His second-in-command was Lieutenant Colonel Joseph E. Johnston. The regiment was one of nine new infantry regiments authorized by the United States Congress in 1847 for one year service in the Mexican-American War. The regiment was not numbered. It was to be a special unit with half of its men to be mounted, the other half were to be on foot. The intent was to have each horseman paired with a foot soldier who was to get up behind him for rapid movements. However this arrangement was never used, the Voltigeurs became a regiment of foot riflemen, armed with the muzzle- loading Model 1841 rifle, the same rifle as was used by the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen. The Voltigeurs and Foot Riflemen regiment included a company of mountain howitzers and war rockets.

A prominent schoolboy cricketer, he made his debut for Somerset in the year he left school, 1932, and though he made little impression with the bat, he took three top-order Indian batsmen's wickets in the first innings of his second match, and two more in the second innings. The 3/40 in the first innings was his best career bowling return. However, after three matches that season, he disappeared from first-class cricket for five years. In 1937, Kinnersley returned for two matches in which he took eight wickets without improving on his best bowling performance and again had no success as a batsman.

Incumbent Republican United States Senator Ted Stevens ran for re-election to a fifth term in the United States Senate. Stevens faced off against Democratic nominee Theresa Obermeyer, a former member of the Anchorage School Board, and Green Party nominee Jed Whittaker, a commercial fisherman. Media attention The race drew national attention for Obermeyer's erratic behavior: she blamed Stevens for her husband's failure to pass the bar exam twenty-one times, and contended that Stevens had passed the bar by fraud. She \\"trailed\\" him to campaign events, frequently wearing a prisoner's outfit and once dragging a ball and chain behind her. In June and July 1996, she served a sentence of 30 days in prison for disorderly conduct because of her role in a disturbance at a federal courthouse, while on probation for a 1994 conviction of disorderly conduct for instigating another disturbance at the same courthouse. Obermeyer attracted public attention, and possibly sympathy, during the campaign when, after serving seven days of her sentence in Alaska state prison, she was moved in the middle of the night to a Portland, Oregon county jail, and after a week there, she was moved to a federal prison in Dublin, California; her husband and attorney each complained about the moves, and a Federal prison official acknowledged that they were unusual. During the televised debate before the general election, after discussing diseases of the brain, Stevens earnestly said to his opponent, \\"I think you need help, Mrs. Obermeyer,\\" a response described fourteen years later in The Anchorage Daily News as one that \\"has become, it is safe to say, legendary.\\" The televised primary election debates on August 21, 1996 also drew national attention for the unusual cast of characters seeking to oppose Stevens, particularly the seven candidates on the Democratic side. A column on the national PoliticsNow website, headlined \\"Alaska Displays the Scary Side of Democracy,\\" described the debate as \\"what would happen if the Addams Family appeared on Meet the Press,\\" leading to nationwide sales by public TV station KAKM of a record number of copies of the debate video. Anchorage Daily News columnist Mike Doogan described the debate as \\"what would happen if the folks from Jabba the Hutt's headquarters dropped by the Mad Hatter's tea party.\\" Results In the general election, Stevens was re-elected in an overwhelming landslide, and Whittaker finished ahead of Obermeyer.

The bridge is a Grade II listed building, and is part of a surrounding conservation area. It runs parallel to the Barton Swing Aqueduct which carries the Bridgewater Canal. The bridge opens regularly for traffic along the Manchester Ship Canal, which can cause delays for road traffic. The bridge and aqueduct were inaugurated along with the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, though a bridge had previously existed at this location for over 200 years. During the 20th century, it became increasingly important as an access route to Trafford Park and to allow traffic to bypass Manchester and Salford city centres, and consequently became a significant traffic bottleneck. A replacement high level bridge was built further downstream, and today the swing bridge carries mostly local traffic. Operation Aerial photo of the bridge (right) and aqueduct (left) The structure is located adjacent to, and downstream of, the Barton Swing Aqueduct. The two crossings are controlled from a brick-built valve house, on a x man-made island in the centre of the canal. The tower is four stories high, each with a 2x2 bay and accessed via an external staircase. The bridge opens to let shipping traffic through the Manchester Ship Canal, which occurs up to 14 times a day. The island supports the pivot points for the bridges' rotating structures, which are fixed in concrete. When in their open positions, the aqueduct and road bridge line up along the length of the island, allowing ships to traverse along each side of the ship canal. The bridge is a steel arch of girders, and connects to the pivot point via a rack and pinion system. It is the only swing road bridge on the canal that rotates from the centre, instead of from one end. History=Early crossings There has been a crossing since at least the 17th century at this location, where the road meets the River Irwell. A bridge was constructed over the river around 1677‚Äì79, replacing an earlier ford. It was the first river crossing east of Warrington. This bridge was demolished in 1745 in order to stop the progress of the Jacobite army and was replaced by a wooden footbridge, and subsequently a three-arch road bridge. These bridges pre-dated the Barton Aqueduct, and a condition of the aqueduct's design was that it did not impede progress on the Irwell any more than the existing bridge. Current bridge The road crossing The current bridge was built during the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal. It was designed by the project's engineer, Edward Leader Williams, and constructed by Andrew Handyside and Company. Williams' design was chosen as the best of three possible plans by James Abernethy, who subsequently became the scheme's consulting engineer. The bridge opened to traffic on 1 January 1894. The total span is and it carries a roadway. By the 1930s, the bridge had become a significant bottleneck for workers in Trafford Park, who commuted over the bridge on foot or cycle, particularly during peak hours. It also became an important route for goods vehicles, both heading to Trafford Park and crossing Lancashire, and for parishioners in Eccles travelling to Mass at the All Saints Church on the canal's south side. In 1946, concern was expressed in Parliament over the closing of the bridge to road traffic at peak times. The following year, the Manchester Ship Canal Company agreed that the bridge would generally stay open for road traffic during rush hour, though this could not be guaranteed. A cargo vessel struck the bridge on 28 December 1948, restricting the bridge to single-line working and a two-ton weight limit until repairs had been completed. In 1953, traffic was banned from turning right off the bridge into Barton Road. By the 1950s, the bridge had become part of a de facto outer ring road as it formed part of a main road, the A575, from Stretford to Bolton, avoiding both Manchester and Salford. A traffic survey in 1954 revealed 9,600 vehicles were using the bridge daily and it closed 7,000 times a year. A replacement bridge was considered vitally important to the local economy, particularly that of Trafford Park. William Proctor, MP for Eccles, said \\"I cannot think of any other project in the North of England which should have higher priority than the Barton Bridge scheme.\\" Construction of the replacement Barton High Level Bridge started in 1957; the bridge opened to traffic in October 1960 and has been referred to informally as the \\"Barton Bridge\\". Traffic on the swing bridge has also been reduced by the construction of Centenary Bridge located upstream towards Salford. Conservation area In 1976, the area around the bridge was designated a conservation area, with responsibility shared between Salford City and Trafford. The bridge and the aqueduct both became Grade II listed structures. Salford City Council have been concerned about the poor quality of pedestrian access across the bridge, which, as well as being potentially unsafe, detracts from the development of tourism in the area. The council aims to refurbish the area around the bridge and aqueduct so it meets the status of a World Heritage Site. The council are also concerned about wear and tear on the bridge as, although no longer on a major road, it still carries significant traffic. In August 2008, the bridge was temporarily closed to enable the replacement of electrical supply cabling, while in April, 2013, Salford City Council announced the bridge could be closed for up to six weeks to install pipes to prevent sewer flooding.

Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on May 3, 1951, and stars Sylvester the Cat in a spoof of \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\". Plot A grandmother mouse is telling her grandson a bedtime story, and so tells of Little Red Riding Hood (with the mouse as Riding Hood), and his visit to Grandma's House, unaware that the wolf (Sylvester) is watching him. He takes a shortcut to Grandma's, only to find four others already there, who he forces out. Red comes along, and he speaks his cue line, (\\"The better to eat you with\\") starting the chase. He pursues Red down the staircase, only to be propelled further than intended by a stick of butter. Sylvester then decides to blow the house up with dynamite, but accidentally sticks it into Hector's mouth, who then sticks it in the cat's mouth until it blows up. Sylvester next disguises himself as Red's fairy godmother, attempting to electrocute Red with a rigged wand. Sylvester's incantation is \\"R-A-G-G M-O-P-P\\" in reference to the 1950 pop song Rag Mop by The Ames Brothers. However, Hector unplugs the power so that it doesn't work. Sylvester wonders if the wand is faulty (\\"What's this? Must've blown a fuse or somethin'\\") but Red simply tells him that nothing had happened (\\"It's a fake; nothing happens\\"). Hector then plugs it back in just as Sylvester tests it on himself (\\"Whaddya mean, nothin' happened?\\"). He then tries to hit the mouse with it, but he escapes back to his mouse hole and he drops the rigged wand on the floor in frustration. The mouse then tries to go outside, but is trapped once again. Underneath a cup, Sylvester watches as the mouse prepares something, revealed to be a miniature tank that packs a punch. He then traps the mouse by its hole. Back in reality, the grandmother describes how, to save herself, the mouse threw a stick of dynamite out, doing so to demonstrate. Her grandson claims that it must have blown the cat up, to which Sylvester replies, \\"You're not just whistling dixie, brother!\\" Availability * Laserdisc - Wince Upon a Time * DVD - Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5/Looney Tunes: Spotlight Collection: Volume 5 * Blu-ray & DVD - Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2 * VHS - Brivido Gatto See also * List of cartoons featuring Sylvester References Category:1951 animated films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Warner Bros.

A science fiction story centered on the sexual adventures of a group of college students and their investigation of a bizarre cult, the film premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, where it was awarded the first ever Queer Palm for its contribution to lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender issues. Plot Smith, an 18-year-old film student who identifies sexually as \\"undeclared,\\" has been having strange dreams recently. He is going to college with his best friend, Stella, whom he has known since junior high, and finds a note saying he is the \\"chosen son.\\" He has a roommate named Thor, whom he lusts after even though Thor is straight. Smith and Stella go to a party where Stella hooks up with a girl named Lorelei, who Smith recognizes from one of his dreams. Later, a red-haired girl vomits on his shoe, and Smith also recognizes her from a dream. Smith eventually gets picked up by London, a British student. They have sex, but to Smith's chagrin, she does not want to be with him except during sex. Smith visits a nude beach and meets a man named Hunter. They start having sex, but Smith is disappointed to hear Hunter is married. Stella discovers Lorelei is not only unstable, but a witch with psychic problems caused by rejection. Stella keeps trying to dump her but has difficulty as Lorelei begins trying to kill her. Smith walks in on Thor and Thor's best friend, Rex, wrestling in their underwear. London seduces Rex, convincing him to have a three-way with her and Smith for Smith's 19th birthday. During this time, Smith continues dreaming of the red-haired girl. In his dreams, they are both pursued by people wearing animal masks. Smith finds out that a girl was killed and her head cut off. He later meets Madeline, who appears to be the same red-haired girl. She tells him that she had a twin sister named Rebecca who was kidnapped many years ago by men wearing animal masks. Stella is attacked by Lorelei in a bathroom, but saves herself by spraying water on her, causing Lorelei to burn up. The animal- masked people finally capture Smith, London, and Smith's mom. They are bundled into a van to be driven to meet the head of a secret cult. Smith learns that the cult leader is his father, although he was always told that his father died when Smith was young. The three also learn London is another child of the cult leader, making her and Smith half-siblings. Stella, Oliver, and the perpetually stoned \\"Messiah\\" pursue the van. Oliver has powers like Lorelei's but uses them for good. It turns out that Oliver meeting Smith (and flirting with him) was not chance; he was trying to protect Smith from the cult. The Messiah was only acting stoned as a cover and also wishes to protect Smith. The animal-masked people turn out to be Thor, Rex, and Hunter, whose mission is to get London and Smith to a secret underground shelter to survive the explosion of dozens of nuclear bombs. Non-cult members will be annihilated, and the cult will take over the world with Smith as its leader. The Messiah tries running the van off the road, and both vehicles accelerate towards a bridge that is out. Smith's father presses a button and the Earth explodes.

Biography  Herbert Norman Halpert's interest in folklore emerged in his adolescence and remained throughout his life. Consistent with his choice, he earned an M.A. in Anthropology from Columbia University, where he studied with Ruth Benedict and George Herzog, and a Ph.D. in English from Indiana University, under the guidance of Stith Thompson. Both of his dissertations were based on field studies of American folklore. During World War II, Halpert served in the Alaskan Division of the Air Transport Command of the U.S. Army Air Corps. After the conflict, he became Professor and Head of the Department of English at Murray State College, in Kentucky, where he encouraged his students to collect local traditions. Between 1956-1960, he became Dean and Professor of English and Sociology at Blackburn College, in Illinois. In 1960, he was also Visiting Professor at the University of Arkansas and in the following year he moved to New York City, where he lived until 1962, teaching at the State University of New York. In the autumn of 1962, Halpert became Associate Professor of English at the Memorial University of Newfoundland (Canada), where in 1968, he founded the Memorial University of Newfoundland Folklore and Language Archive (MUNFLA) and developed most of the work in folklore that became internationally renowned.

History  The foundation of the church came in 1291, the era of Gothic architecture. The Dominican Order originally received permission from Henry I, Landgrave of Hesse to build a monastery and church. The Dominicans were popular among the population because they contributed to the poor and health care expenses. They received generous donations which enabled them to richly endow the church, built in dedication to John the Baptist. In 1527, after the introduction of Protestant Reformation in the Landgraviate of Hesse, the monastery was secularized and its property was handed over as the material foundation for the newly formed Philipps University, which taught in the monastery buildings until 1873. The University Church was also used for funerals of former professors. At times, the buildings around the church were used as granaries. In 1653, after the Thirty Years' War, the university and the church were re- opened by William VI, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel. A redesign and refurbishing of the interior was completed in 1927 on occasion of the 400th anniversary of the university under the auspices of the then priest Karl Bernhard Ritter.  Specifications  The church is asymmetrical with two spans. The side aisle and centre aisle are the same height. It has only a nave, and a transept is not present. The church is accessible via two entrances, the west gate and the north gate. The polygonal choir across from the nave is somewhat elevated. The church and choir are oriented to the east. It directly adjoins the convent, the later premises of the Old University, and is thus not freestanding. When one enters the nave through the west gate, one faces directly towards the choir, which was erected first. There are three panel windows with tracery in the choir, though they have been altered or replaced. The Organ is also located in the choir. The elaborately worked choir screen, which separates the choir from the nave, dates from 1927, the 400th anniversary of the university. It was added post hoc, just like the galleries and the organ. Even if a south side aisle were planned, it would not be possible, because the alley is already there, and therefore the necessary space is lacking. Thus the side aisle is located on the north side, next to the alley. On the south side, the buttresses, which customarily reach outwards, as evidenced on the north side, have been relocated to the inside. Since the former cloister was attached to the facade of the south wall, relocation to the inside seemed to be the best alternative. Besides, there is a full length gallery inside the church on the south side. There is a turret on the roof. It is mentioned in the literature that the Dominicans, as a mendicant order, were not entitled to build a tower, so they built a ridge turret instead. The roof was completed after the construction of the choir in 1420.

It served as an art pavilion, the Pabell√≥n de Arte Antiguo,Labeled as number 11 on the map at :Commons:File:SevillaExpoIberoAmericana1929.svg. for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929, when An√≠bal Gonz√°lez had the opportunity to design several additional permanent buildings for the plaza. The exterior is ceramic over brick, and has three doors with archivolts adorned with glazed tiles (azulejos). The building originally consisted of two stories over an aeration chamber (necessary because of the humidity). In the 1960s, the main floor, originally over high, was divided in two, with an intermediate level added by architect Delgado Roig. In 1972, as part of the preparations for the current museum, the various stories of the building were connected by a grand spiral staircase designed by Jos√© Galnares Sagastiz√°bal. The museum was established by a decree of 23 March 1972, initially as a section of the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville. It opened its doors to the public 4 March 1973. For the next seven years, the museum fell under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Science, but the city government occupied more than half of the poorly maintained building. Neither institution took full responsibility. This situation led to a series of temporary closures. In 1976, the electric bill could not be paid, and the museum had to be shut until it could get power again. In 1979, heavy rains damaged the interior. On 26 March 1980, the City Council agreed to allow the Ministry of Education and Science to use the whole building, for as long as it was used for the museum, on the condition that the Ministry would suitably restore it. On this basis, the Ministry hired architect Fernando Villanueva Sandino. The resulting restoration converted the primitive aeration chamber into a new lower-ground floor. The museum reopened 18 October 1984; at that same time the new Andalusian Autonomous Government took over the museum, along with other museums in Andalusia that had been operated by the central government of Spain. In 1990 the main floor was further fitted out for temporary exhibitions, and in 1994 the D√≠az Vel√°zquez Collection was permanently installed, with a little over a third of the building remaining for temporary exhibitions. Facilities and layout The public portion of the museum occupies the lower-ground floor, the main floor, and the additional floor (now \\"first floor\\") that was created by Delgado Roig. The permanent exhibition space amounts to . The upper floor contains the museum library (specialized in ethnography and museology).

Accessed online 2010-01-19. Particularly notable are the Aguiar collection of costumbrista paintings; the Soria collection of Oriental porcelain and ivory; and some pieces from the Orleans and Gestoso collections. Other pieces have been donated by other museums, such as a collection of Sevillian azulejos (glazed tiles) donated by the Archeological Museum of Seville, and other donations from the Museo del Pueblo Espa√±ol (Madrid), the Museum of Fine Arts Valencia, and from various smaller museums in Andalusia. Various people of Seville have also made important donations, filling gaps in the collections; for example, they have donated textiles, agricultural tools, household utensils, and musical instruments. Other pieces were purchased in the 1970s, when the museum came under the aegis of the Ministry of Education and Science. The largest donation after the founding was the 1979 D√≠az Vel√°zquez legacy, one of Europe's best collections of embroidery and lace, with nearly 6,000 pieces. Acquisitions since 2000 include the Loty collection of more than 2,000 glass panels depicting details Andalusian cities and life from roughly 1900 to 1936, and the 168-piece Allepuz ethnographic collection. The collection of Andalusian popular ceramics has developed over time, and is rivaled only be the collection at the Museum of Ethnology, Hamburg. The city donated the originals of the posters for the annual Seville Fair (Feria de Abril). The Department of Culture supplemented this with the Mencos collection in the museum, the most complete known collection of lithographs and color photographs of Feria and Semana Santa (Holy Week in Seville) posters. Other acquisitions were the outgrowth of fieldwork: the research of Carmen Ortiz led to the donation of the cooperage workshop of Claudio Bernal, the city's last cooper; Andr√©s Carretero's work similarly led to the donation of the workshop of guitarmaker Francisco Barba; Esther Fern√°ndez work added a gilding workshop; other workshops donated included those of Filigrana, master maker of castanets, and of goldsmith Fernando Marmolejo. Marmolejo was the last in a four-centuries-old family profession, and some of his tools dated back centuries. The museum now has eight workshops on exhibit. Use as a film set The building has been used several times as a set for films or television shows, including the 1974 American film The Wind and the Lion and the 1985 French Film Harem, where it was used as the British Embassy.

Law spent three years outside of football on a backpacking trip around the world, before returning in 1994 after discovering his injury was able to withstand the rigours of professional football. He joined Wolverhampton Wanderers, who were required to pay ¬£34,000 to Law's insurance company for the compensation he had received on retirement and ¬£100,000 to his former club Queens Park Rangers. During his time with Wolves, Law was arrested after driving a bus while drunk, later receiving a fine and community service. After initially beginning to establish himself in the first team, Law was forced to undergo ankle reconstruction surgery and never managed to regain his place in the side, eventually moving to Milwall in 1997. He made 47 appearances as club captain in all competitions during his first season at The New Den and remained a regular in the first team at the start of the following season before a knee injury forced him out of the side after less than one month of the 1998‚Äì99 season.

Since 1982, she has been a leader in the field of money psychology. She is the author or co-author (with Sherry Christie) of five books about money and relationships. She is also a monthly columnist for Investment Advisor magazine. She has been interviewed frequently on The TODAY Show, Oprah, and ABC's 20-20, as well as on nationwide TV, radio and in the print media. In 2006, Investment Advisor magazine named her one of the Top 25 ‚Äì those leaders who had the most influence on the financial advisor industry. Early life and education Olivia Mellan was born on October 14, 1946 in Brooklyn, New York, to Eli Mellan, an attorney (and later District Court Judge in Nassau County, New York), and Sara Mellan, a secretary and housewife. She was raised in Wantagh, Long Island. Mellan was salutatorian of her MacArthur High School graduating class, and won a full scholarship to attend Mt. Holyoke College. She graduated with honors in 1968 magna cum laude with a degree in French. She studied in Paris, France, and choreographed plays in Paris and in America. She attended Georgetown University's School of Language and Linguistics (also winning a full scholarship there); and earned a Masters in French, minoring in Sociolinguistics, in 1972. Mellan studied for six years in training institutes to become a psychotherapist. She studied Feminist Therapy for three years at the Washington Women's Center Feminist Counseling program, and graduated in 1974 from the Washington Community Therapy Guild's 3-year training program in Washington, D.C. Early career Olivia Mellan has been in private practice since 1974 as a psychotherapist specializing in women's issues and in couples conflict resolution. Since 1982, she began specializing in money psychology and money conflict resolution, when she and attorney and friend Michael Goldberg, realized that \\"money was the last taboo in the therapy office and in life in general.\\" They coined the term \\"money harmony\\" and offered a workshop at Sevenoaks Retreat Center in Madison, Va., leading a money psychology group at a Money Conference where Michael Phillips was the keynoter. Impressed by their work, Phillips sponsored a trip to California for Goldberg and Mellan to train other therapists in money psychology work. An article in the Washington Post's Style section about \\"Money Madness\\" appearing around the Christmas season mentioned Mellan (under her previous married name - Mundra) and Goldberg's money personality types. This led to many radio and print interviews, and several years later, Mellan self-published a workbook, Ten Days to Money Harmony. This book came to the attention of George Gibson, head of Walker Publishing in New York City, who invited Mellan to expand her workbook into her first published book. Money Psychology Work Since 1983, Mellan's private practice expanded to include money-related issues for both individuals and couples. By the 1990s, over half of her practice was money- related. She taught Money Harmony courses at the Washington Ethical Society (for both individuals and couples), and after a financial planner (John Cammack) took one of her workshops, he invited her to speak to local and national financial advisor groups about money and relationships. Mellan developed a specialty in gender differences around money, and couples polarization patterns and money, and began presenting workshops to therapist groups as well (at the Family Therapy Networker Symposium, now the Psychotherapy Networker Symposium, where she spoke almost yearly,) among others. She spoke to women's groups, large and small, around the country.

Pilhes began working as an advertising executive at Air France then at Publicis as Creative Director and Executive Board Member, before devoting himself entirely to literature where he views society as a moralist. It is also a director of TF1. He was married December 19, 1959 to Nicole Ingrand, with whom he has three children: Nathalie, Laurent, Maria. His best known work is The Curse Biography and literary works= Family background and youth: the natural child of the Ari√®ge  Ren√© Jean Laurent Pilhes (pronounced \\"Pille\\") came from old families of the Ari√®ge. His great-uncle Victor Pilhes was a deputy in the Second Republic, and he has added that name to his own since his first novel. It is in this region that he grew up, at Seix; mountains and villages of Ari√®ge punctuate many of his novels. An illegitimate child, he was raised by his maternal grandmother. Illegitimacy is also the subject of his first novel, Rhubarb. He attended college at Saint-Girons, high school in Toulouse and then at Lyc√©e Buffon in Paris, achieving a bachelor's degree. In June 1955 he was sent to Algeria where after his classes he became a midshipman and lieutenant. He stayed there until September 1957 and left marked by the experience.  Debut novelist: author publicity  On his return from Algeria, he began working for Air France and three-eight as a commercial agent and politically committed. He campaigned for the CGT, Mendes- France supports and adheres to the PSU. With Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, he founded the Alumni Association of Algeria. He married, and his career evolved: in the early 1960s was still a copywriter at Air France, then at Dorland and Gray before becoming a copywriter at Publicis. He kept his distance from politics and increasingly felt his need to write, especially after the death of his maternal grandmother. His first novel, Rhubarb, appeared in 1965 and was awarded the Prix M√©dicis. Originally titled The Bastard, his narrator, Urban Gorenfan / Aubain Minville, relates the quest for identity of a young man not recognized by his father, who seeks to know how the child would have been if he had been legitimate. The facts are invented even though the context of history could a priori be likened to an autobiography, Pilhes transforms it into a baroque novel with extraordinary adventures. \\"Take the high ground, do not fear what dictates the imagination, take care of the balance between reality and fiction, these are my constant concerns as a novelist. 1% In 1969, published his second novel, The Loum, the climbing of whose phallic peak haunts the author's later writings. In this audacious novel with its salacious passages, His Excellency the Lord began climbing, with his old mother, this huge rocky spur that points to the sky in a singular struggle. This book is also presented as an psychoanalytic epic . back cover of the 1969 edition by Seuil Ren√© Victor Pilhes says of it: \\"The Loum is the story of a terrible battle between mother and son. [...] Is: \\"I will, once and for all, demonstrate to you that I am much more powerful than my father and all the men you admired in your life.\\" The wounds and bumps, op cit. p.126 The book has been the subject of a public lecture in Geneva and is included in the anthology of erotic literature by Jean-Jacques Pauvert.  1974: The Curse  The Curse (L'Impr√©cateur) was a milestone in the writer's life. He now devoted himself fully to literature. The topics changed, although slapstick and fantasy remain his style. \\"The author has shifted his gaze from the abdomen of his mother, his unknown father, and some others to the \\"bottom\\" of society which he was a contemporary. 4. This novel won the Prix Femina and is a best-seller with 390,000 copies sold.http://hebdo.nouvelobs.com/hebdo/parution/p1735/articles/a20189-pilhes_le_retour.html Warmly received by critics, he denounced the failings of the economy, where the unbridled pursuit of profit replaces virtue. Mysterious curses shake the Rosserys and Mitchell company, in the minds of its managers as well as its foundations and direction. A film, directed by Jean-Louis Bertucelli, was made in 1977.Fact Sheet on Rotten Tomatoes.Com After the election of Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing to the presidency, he kept up with politics, joined the Socialist Party and actively campaigned in the following years. His fourth novel, The Beast (1976), is more politically engaged than earlier works. It tells the drifts coercive when a group of young people from a village in the Ari√®ge intend to oppose a rally of the Advanced Liberal Yout : \\"shuns violence is something undemocratic, approve the hunt active minorities is another .Quoted in The Beast, 1976  Pilhes in the years 1980-1990  In 1981, in Wounds and Bumps, resulting from interviews with Maurice Chavardes, he took stock of his career, re-distanced himself from politics and announced the writing of several novels. He completely abandoned the business world until 1986 (transition to TF1 and Havas). He resumed writing assiduously: nine works appeared between 1985 and 1999. He took a moralistic view of the shortcomings of a society affected by the evils of economic liberalism, the darkness of the past or political machinations. The Pompeii (1985) brings back the dark days of the Occupation and its sequel The Demons of the Court of Rohan (1987) addresses the issue of leftism of the 1970s and its shift into terrorism. In 1988 The Hitler appeared, which aroused some controversy. It tackles the difficult problem of antisemitism in the late twentieth century. Because of conflicts in Palestine, he argues that new anti-Semitism is anti-Zionist. The Fakir (1995) brings back the Algerian past of the master pollster Lenoyer (torture, methods of pacification), a period of which there is silence, whose vicissitudes have serious consequences even today. In Christ (1997) the inhabitants of a village, guardians of the last vestiges of Cathar, see their tranquility disrupted by the arrival of an American scientific expedition. In 1989 The Ombudsman denounced the excesses of the TV world, its ephemeral stars desperate to survive publicly, on board a dangerously pitching ship. The subject of corporate executives still interested Pilhes. Philidor's position (1992), a detective novel transports ambitious young professionals to a mountain village where a crime occurs. The next year seems that The False narrates the last days of a finance magnate rediscovering the traditional activities of his reaper ancestors. A television adaptation was to be made in 2003. In his latest novel Henbane (1999), Aubain Minville and Urban Gorenfan, heroes of Rhubarb reappear in an investigation into the murder of a young anti-nuclear activist.  The author's style  He began by writing two novels that were not to be published. In wounds and bumps, he says in this connection to Mauritius Chavardes: \\"I started writing at the age of twenty. About illegitimacy of course. But then, it was really autobiographical. I could not cope. Then on my return to Algeria, I wrote an essay on that war. [...] I could not face up to my ilegitimacy and tell it: \\"I am not interested at all in you. [ ...] You interest me locked up, submissive, naked, open, panting, frightened, hungry, behind the bars of literary creation. \\" wounds and bumps, op. cit p.46 It is this reality reinterpreted through the prism of his prints burlesque that marks his writing style. Some characters names are recurring, such as Nomen, Lenoyer, Gorenfan, Minville. The narrator is sometimes called Pilhes, but changes his identity and profession in the various novels. The Ariege and peaceful villages are often part of the adventures of its hero, in the shadow of Loum. JP Damour analytical writing Pilhes noting his fondness for the winks, the use of narrative platitudes and psychoanalytic clich√©s (cf. Rhubarb and The Loum): \\"It arises from the accumulation process ostensibly a baroque composition, often parodic, which sometimes turns the main characters' quest into a sort of epic slapstick.\\" Record Rene Victor Pilhes written by JP Damour in the Dictionary of French- language writers, edited by JP de Beaumarchais, Daniel Couty and Alain Rey, Larousse, Paris, 2001, 2253p  Ren√© Victor Pilhes today  He is retired, living surrounded by his six grandchildren. He has not published in the last ten years but is still writing the third part of Loum announced long beforehand: \\"The Loum is not finished. It includes only two parts out of three, the ambiguous (Pride and abuse) and the tense (Humor and Humor). The lost part remains to be written. Garcin, op.cit Concerned about the literary legacy he will leave, and willing to defend and promote knowledge of his work, he maintains a blog in which he report on some critics who have praised him during his career and delivers some keys to reading his novels. He is organising his archives with the help of his grandson Arsene. Of the controversy around The Hitler, twenty years after its release, Pilhes says he has been accused of anti-Semitism and as a result has been subject to legal attack. In the dictionary of J√©r√¥me Garcin, in his own written record just after The Hitler, he justified himself thus: \\"the author wanted to show a sample of what would be a neo-antisemitic speech. \\" [...] Because it seemed as if we were not careful, fifty years after the Holocaust, we would run right into this situation. [...] The author has done this unequivocally, without ulterior motives, in order to serve democracy and tolerance. But the Jewish community does not believe or pretends not to believe it. [...] Worse he is accused of antisemitism. What more can he do? We must think about it. And weigh what is left behind.

History The Type 41 was a Japanese version of the Vickers \\"Mark M\\", originally introduced by Vickers-Armstrong (Barrow) as the secondary battery for the Kong≈ç-class. These original guns were designated by the Japanese Navy as the \\"Mark II\\", whereas the Japanese-designed copy (adopted from 1912) were designated as the \\"Mark III\\". In the 1930s, the Kong≈ç-class were modernized, at which time these guns were replaced by new 12.7 cm/40 DP guns. The old guns were placed in storage and were reused on the Agano-class. Some were taken to Guam and were used for coastal defense batteries. In the Agano-class, the gun could elevate to 55¬∞ for anti-aircraft fire; however, its manual loading method allowed a rate of fire of only about 6 rounds per minute, which significantly limited its utility as an anti-aircraft weapon.

The dimensionless Markstein number is defined as: :\\\\mathcal{M} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathcal{L}}{\\\\delta_L} where \\\\mathcal{L} is the Markstein length, and \\\\delta_L is the characteristic laminar flame thickness. The larger the Markstein length, the greater the effect of curvature on localised burning velocity. It is named after George H. Markstein (1911‚Äî2011), who showed that thermal diffusion stabilized the curved flame front and proposed a relation between the critical wavelength for stability of the flame front, called the Markstein length, and the thermal thickness of the flame. Phenomenological Markstein numbers with respect to the combustion products are obtained by means of the comparison between the measurements of the flame radii as a function of time and the results of the analytical integration of the linear relation between the flame speed and either flame stretch rate or flame curvature. The burning velocity is obtained at zero stretch, and the effect of the flame stretch acting upon it is expressed by a Markstein length. Because both flame curvature and aerodynamic strain contribute to the flame stretch rate, there is a Markstein number associated with each of these components. Clavin‚ÄìWilliams equation The Markstein number with respect to the unburnt gas mixture for a one step reaction in the limit of large activation energy asymptotics was derived by Paul Clavin and Forman A. Williams in 1982.Clavin, Paul, and F. A.

The railway was to run from Southgate to Hammersmith and Shepherd's Bush via Palmers Green, Tottenham, Stoke Newington, Dalston, Shoreditch, the City of London, the West End and Kensington. The PC&NELR; was formed from the combination of three earlier railway schemes proposed in 1901; the Piccadilly and City Railway and the North East London Railway and part of the London United Electric Railway (LUER). The railway was supported by American financier J. P. Morgan and London United Tramways (LUT), whose network of tram routes in west London would provide passengers for the railway at Hammersmith. Although looked on favourably in Parliament, consideration of the PC&NELR;'s bills was delayed while they and a number of other tube railway bills were evaluated. During the delay, Morgan's representatives fell out with the LUT over the division of the ownership of the group, and, in September 1902, Sir George White, chairman of the LUT, sold the company to Speyer Brothers, a finance house led by Edgar Speyer. Speyer Brothers was one of the backers of the rival underground railway schemes being developed by Charles Yerkes' Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). In a message to his London representative, Sir Clinton Dawkins, Morgan described the transaction as \\"the greatest rascality and conspiracy I ever heard of.\\" With the LUT and the LUER portions of the PC&NELR; route under its control, Speyer Brothers withdrew the bill to construct the western LUER portion of the PC&NELR; route, which duplicated part of the route of the UERL's Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway. The withdrawn section of the route was critical to the construction of the PC&NELR; as a whole, and Morgan's representatives attempted to get permission from Parliament to proceed with the remaining part of the line, but this was denied and the PC&NELR;'s bills were withdrawn. The PC&NELR; scheme was not revived, although the UERL, which took control of the LUT, did use the tram network to feed passengers into its own Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway at Hammersmith when that opened in December 1906.

It was originally created in 2004 by former federal employee and computer specialist Tom Crowley. Though the board includes topics on various areas, the principal topic of the board is discussion surrounding investment strategies of various Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement funds, specifically oriented toward individuals who preferred to change strategies depending on overall market conditions. The purpose was to help educate shareholders about investment planning and self-help. TSP TALK was identified in a trade publication for federal executives in November 2006 as one of several sites providing collaboration and discussions relating to federal employee investments. At the time, federal employees shared discussions of investment strategies, allocation theories, and held competitions on a member invented tracking listing showing daily returns. TSPTALK.COM first appeared in major government employee press article in a November 2006 article published in GOVEXEC.COM. Several other federal employee newspaper and publication articles followed. Controversy and regulation Shortly after the 2006 article highlighted the activities of participants, the number of participants grew, and the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB), the TSP's oversight agency, began efforts to terminate the activities of the members. People were learning different investment styles and strategies, and shifting from a \\"buy and hold\\" mentality, to one of several different philosophies. These included swing trades, where a person would move part or all of their funds into a sector fund, and/or single-fund investing, where members invested solely in one fund for short periods of time, before reverting to the safety of the \\"G\\" fund, or government treasury funds. Web tracking showed an average of roughly 9 thousand unique visitors a day. TSP TALK members became known as TSP TALKERS, and posted a wide range of information, including investment chart theory, reading charts, detecting trading signals, and occasionally political commentary. The website became controversial in mid-2007 and early 2008, when the FRTIB (Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board) cited frequent reallocation of savings by members of the group, and issued a ban on trades of more than two moves per month. The stated intention was to reduce costs for the funds. The board proposed new regulations to counter employees controlling their own investment funds. The changes were published as a notice of federal rule making published in the Federal Register on January 16, 2008, and were proposed to be effective March 31, 2008. TSP TALK members responded by creating a petition and submitted more than 4,000 signatures opposing the move. However, despite shareholder opposition, and as a result, changed federal regulations restricting moves between funds to two per month between all funds, and further moves to the G Fund only. As a result of the ban, trading costs actually increased, rather than decreased. For 2009, costs increased 32%.

He was a son of the eminent Boston physician Dr. John Randall, Harvard College Class of 1802, and his wife Elizabeth Wells (a granddaughter of Founding Father Samuel Adams). H After receiving his preparatory education at Mr. Green's school in Jamaica Plain and at the Boston Latin School, he studied at Harvard College, graduating in the Class of 1834. Although he took his Doctor of Medicine degree at Harvard Medical School, he never practiced medicine. Randall was described by a classmate: \\"Though among us, he was not wholly of us, but seemed to have thoughts, pursuits and aspirations to which we were strangers\\". His natural history publications include two papers about beetles (one concerning the beetles of Maine, the other, the beetles of Massachusetts), a paper about crustaceans from the West Coast of the United States and Hawaii, and a book of poetry entitled, Consolations of Solitude, published by John P. Jewett, (publisher of Uncle Tom's Cabin); it was commended in the North American Review, the reviewer likening his descriptions of nature to those of William Cullen Bryant. A further volume on the natural history of Maine and five further volumes of poetry were prepared; one of them, The Fairies' Festival, with illustrations by Francis Gilbert Attwood, was published in 1895 after his death by Joseph Knight Company of Boston, and edited by Francis Ellingwood Abbot. An art collector, Randall amassed a large collection at his family seat in Stow, Massachusetts. A lifelong bachelor, Randall died at the age of seventy-eight. Randall's donation of books and bequest led to the formation of the Randall Library in Stow.https://www.stow-ma.gov/randall- library/pages/about-library ReferencesExternal links * Category:American carcinologists Category:American entomologists Category:1813 births Category:1892 deaths Category:American male poets Category:Harvard College alumni Category:People from Stow, Massachusetts Category:19th-century American poets Category:19th-century American male writers Category:19th- century American zoologists Category:Boston Latin School alumni Category:Harvard Medical School alumni ","title":"John Witt Randall"},{"id":"25872351","text":"cheverons originated by their military counterparts.

Biography Born in Berufj√∂r√∞ur in the east of Iceland, Eir√≠kr was sent to England in 1862 by the Icelandic Bible Society, and his first translations there were of mediaeval Christian texts. In 1871, with the assistance of Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet and of Alexander Beresford Hope, MP for Cambridge, he became an under-librarian at the Cambridge University Library, where he worked until the end of 1909. In 1893 he also became lecturer in Icelandic. Eir√≠kr lectured and organised famine relief for Iceland in 1875 and 1882 and fell out with Gu√∞brandur Vigf√∫sson, a fellow Icelandic scholar who was at Oxford and had been his friend, over that and his preference for modernised Icelandic in translating the Bible; Gu√∞brandur was a purist. Like many Icelandic scholars in Britain at the time, Eir√≠kr gave Icelandic lessons as a source of income; his first pupil was probably Sir Edmund Walker Head, 8th Baronet in 1863, and he taught some by post. Another was George E. J. Powell, who had supported him financially when he first came to England and with whom he translated J√≥n Arnason's Icelandic folktales and worked on a translation of H√°var√∞ar saga √çsfir√∞ings that remained unpublished. Most famously, he taught William Morris and collaborated with him on translating a number of sagas. Within a year of Morris beginning his studies with Eir√≠kr, their Story of Grettir the Strong was published (1869). In 1870 they published the first English translation of V√∂lsungasaga. In 1871 Eir√≠kr and his wife accompanied Morris to Iceland, where Eir√≠kr went with Morris on a tour of \\"saga steads\\" and other places of interest. Between 1891 and 1905 they published a six-volume Saga Library, which included Heimskringla and the first English translations of H√°var√∞ar saga √çsfir√∞ings, H√¶nsa-√û√≥ris saga and Eyrbyggja Saga. Eir√≠kr defended Morris against York Powell's criticism of his archaic style. Volume 6 of the Saga Library, volume 4 of the Heimskringla, is an index that is entirely Eir√≠kr's work, published in 1905 after Morris's death. Eir√≠kr was married to Sigr√≠√∞ur Einarsd√≥ttir, a descendant of Egill Skallagr√≠msson. She campaigned to improve education for girls in Iceland. He is buried in the Mill Road cemetery, Cambridge.

He's success is due to the effectiveness of his commercials; they raise sales and make great business for the clients.\\" -Jos√© Becker \\"Sim√≥n Bross is a director who respects the creative idea. He is impeccable in production and brilliant directing actors. He is very clear that production values go in function of the creative idea (script), and he knows how to maximize those values. In addition, he's totally honest when it comes to giving feedback of the creative ideas. He always finds the way to make the idea richer and establish clear production criteria (meaning he finds the right actor, location and other elements that were visualized in the initial idea). He directs commercials in a very special way: he achieves credibility and makes the target identified with them. We work in each commercial just as we would work on a feature film: my creative labor is to make the script and then he takes that idea into the screen taking care of each element on the scene.\\" -Lourdes Lamasney \\"Sim√≥n has a great passion for advertising and he adds a lot to all the creative ideas he directs.

Cameron Health had its European office, Cameron Health BV, in Arnhem, The Netherlands. The privately held company's focus was on a new generation of minimally invasive implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) which they called a Subcutaneous Implantable Defibrillator (S-ICD). Cameron Health's approach avoided implanting transvenous leads into the heart, which had been the usual procedure for cardiac devices. Instead, the Cameron ICD was entirely implanted outside the thoracic wall. In June 2012, Boston Scientific officially acquired Cameron Health for a total sum of $1.3 Billion, paid out incrementally as various revenue milestones were achieved. , Boston Scientific still markets the S-ICD system. Reasons for a minimally invasive approach Every ICD is designed to detect heart rhythms consistent with a catastrophic failure of the body's natural regulation of the heartbeat, which, untreated, could result in death. When an ICD detects a serious arrhythmia, it issues an electrical impulse to the heart muscle, of a magnitude sufficient to cause the heart to revert to a normal rhythm. ICDs with transvenous leads administer this shock to the interior of the heart muscle; the Cameron Health device generated a more powerful shock which can be effective from outside the heart. In the view of Cameron Health, transvenous leads into the heart needlessly complicated the process of implanting a device, and raised other issues and risks which their less invasive approach avoids. The Cameron Health subcutaneous ICD sat outside the ribcage and has no connection to the interior of the heart. The surgical procedure for implantation was minimally invasive as opposed to the traditional procedure of threading leads into the subclavian venous system, through the superior vena cava and into one or more endocardial areas of the heart, a procedure often requiring a cardiologist with specialized training in electrophysiology. In addition to the risks inherent in cardiac surgery, the leads have themselves proved to be a weakness in some ICD designs. According to one estimate, patients with ICDs have a 20 percent chance of lead failure within 10 years, and replacing the leads carries a risk of death of between two and five percent. Some device manufacturers have had to replace defective leads which exposed implanted individuals to unnecessary shocks or other malfunctions, in some cases possibly resulting in fatalities. The Cameron Health S-ICD had the disadvantage of being somewhat bulkier than existing ICDs. Also, this kind of ICD did not include a pacemaker, which narrowed the range of patients for whom it would be appropriate; it was estimated that a majority of patients receiving combination pacemaker/ICD implants would qualify for a pure ICD. These patients tended to have genetic or other conditions predisposing them to sudden cardiac death due to a failure of the heart of maintain a normal rhythm. Clinical trials and approvals A trial involving 53 patients, who were temporarily implanted with S-ICDs, was reported in 2005 at the European Society of Cardiology Congress. A second series of 55 trial patients was conducted in 2008 and 2009 in 10 centers in Europe and New Zealand. Of the 55 patients, 53 had two instances of fibrillation and in 52 these were successfully converted. These findings were reported to European Union authorities in 2009, and resulted in approval for marketing the device. A study of 300 patients is in progress for US approvals. Small nonrandomized early-phase studies primarily intended to show the feasibility of an entirely subcutaneous ICD were updated, combined and published in May 2010. In this report, the system successfully and consistently detected and converted episodes of ventricular fibrillation that were induced during electrophysiological testing. In the European trial of 55 patients, after 46 patient-years of follow-up, 54 of 55 patients were alive, and the single death was due to renal failure. In this trial the system successfully detected and treated 12 episodes (100%)of spontaneous, sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in three patients, prior to the onset of syncope, and with no adverse events. One of the three patients was successfully treated for seven successive episodes of ventricular tachycardia, a condition known as a \\"VT storm\\". Financing Boston Scientific acquired an exclusive option to purchase Cameron Health in 2004, and made an undisclosed equity investment in the company at that time. In 2008, several additional investors organized by the investment company Piper Jaffray and including PTV Healthcare Capital, Delphi Ventures, Sorrento Ventures, Three Arch Partners and Versant Ventures provided just over $50 million to finance the continuing operation of the company.

It was founded by now Fox News host Tucker Carlson and political pundit Neil Patel in 2010. Launched as a \\"conservative answer to The Huffington Post\\", The Daily Caller quadrupled its audience and became profitable by 2012, surpassing several rival websites by 2013. The Daily Caller is a member of the White House press pool. The Daily Caller has frequently published false stories. The website publishes articles that dispute the scientific consensus on climate change. The website has published articles by white supremacists such as Jason Kessler and Peter Brimelow. Scott Greer was deputy editor at The Daily Caller. After his departure, it was revealed that he published articles espousing white nationalist, racist anti- black and antisemitic views under a pseudonym in white supremacist publications. In June 2020, Carlson confirmed he had sold his ownership stake to Patel and left the site. The Daily Caller became a minority-owned and -run company thereafter.  History =Overview The Daily Caller was founded by Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel. After raising $3 million in funding from businessman Foster Friess, the website was launched on January 11, 2010. The organization began with a reporting staff of 21 in its Washington office. It was launched as a \\"conservative answer to The Huffington Post\\", similarly featuring sections in broad range of subjects beyond politics. When The Daily Caller launched in 2010, it became the third Washington DC based news site besides Talking Points Memo and Politico. In a 2010 interview with the Columbia Journalism Review, Tucker Carlson described The Daily Callers prospective audience as \\"[p]eople who are distrustful of conventional news organizations.\\" Carlson said \\"the coverage of the Tea Party blows me away by its stupidity. The assumption of almost everyone I know who covers politics for the networks or daily newspapers is: they're all birthers, they're all crazy, they're upset about fluoride in the water, probably racist. And those assumptions have prevented good journalism from taking place.\\" By late 2012, The New York Times reported that the site had quadrupled its page view and total audience and had become profitable without ever buying an advertisement for itself. By 2013, the site was receiving over 35 million views a month according to Quantcast, surpassing rival sites such as The Washington Times, Politico, and Forbes. The site has an active community, with over 200,000 comments made each month. According to the 2018 book Network Propaganda: Manipulation, Disinformation, and Radicalization in American Politics, written by Harvard University scholars Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts, The Daily Caller fails to follow journalistic norms in its reporting. Carlson departed the site in June 2020 to increase his focus on his television show Tucker Carlson Tonight. Karl Rove has said that \\"The Daily Caller is necessary reading for anyone who wants to be up to speed with what's going on with politics in America.\\" Larry Kudlow referred to the site as \\"one of [his] faves.\\" Fact-checkers have frequently debunked Daily Caller stories. In 2017, the Daily Caller launched its fact-checking news site CheckYourFact.com. In 2018, the site was approved by Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) and became a fact-checking partner of Facebook in 2019. Obama administration Misleading video about NPR = In 2011, The Daily Caller was the first news outlet to disseminate a video by conservative provocateur James O'Keefe which purportedly showed an NPR fundraiser deriding Republicans. The video was later proven to have been misleadingly edited. = \\"Investigative series\\" about Media Matters = In February 2012, The Daily Caller published an \\"investigative series\\" of articles co-authored by Carlson, purporting to be an insiders' expos√© of Media Matters for America (MMfA), a liberal watchdog group that monitors and scrutinizes conservative media outlets, and its founder David Brock. Citing \\"current and former\\" MMfA employees, \\"friends\\" of Brock's and a \\"prominent liberal\\" ‚Äî none of whom are named ‚Äî the article characterized MMfA as having \\"an atmosphere of tension and paranoia\\" and portraying Brock as \\"erratic, unstable and disturbing,\\" who \\"struggles with mental illness,\\" in fear of \\"right-wing assassins,\\" a regular cocaine user and would \\"close [local bars] and party till six in the morning.\\" Reuters media critic and libertarian Jack Shafer sharply criticized The Daily Caller piece as \\"anonymously sourced crap,\\" adding \\"Daily Caller is attacking Media Matters with bad journalism and lame propaganda\\". Shafer said that he had \\"never thought much of Media Matters' style of watchdogging or Brock's journalism\\". = Heckling of Obama = In 2012, Daily Caller reporter Neil Munro interrupted President Barack Obama during one of his press conferences, while Obama was giving remarks. Obama said, \\"The next time I prefer you let me finish my statements before you ask a question.\\" Cutting off Munro's reply, Obama said, \\"I didn't ask for an argument.\\" Munro's interruption of remarks by the president was widely considered a startling breach of etiquette. Editor- in-chief Tucker Carlson defended Munro's heckling, saying \\"As a general matter, reporters are there to ask [questions]\\" and that he was \\"proud\\" of Munro. Munro later said in a statement that his intention was to ask questions after the president made his remarks, but he claimed to have misjudged when the president was closing. \\"I timed the question believing the president was closing his remarks, because naturally I have no intention of interrupting the President of the United States. I know he rarely takes questions before walking away from the podium. When I asked the question as he finished his speech, he turned his back on the many reporters, and walked away while I and at least one other reporter asked questions.\\" = False prostitution allegations = In March 2013 The Daily Caller posted interviews with two women claiming that New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez had paid them for sex while he was a guest of a campaign donor.Boyle, Mathew (November 1, 2012) \\"Women: Sen. Bob Menendez paid us for sex in the Dominican Republic\\". The Daily Caller. Retrieved March 13, 2013. The allegation came five days before the 2012 New Jersey senate election. News organizations such as ABC News, which had also interviewed the women, The New York Times, and the New York Post declined to publish the allegations, viewing them as unsubstantiated and lacking credibility. Subsequently, one of the women who accused Menendez stated that she had been paid to falsely implicate the senator and had never met him. Menendez's office described the allegations as \\"manufactured\\" by a right-wing blog as a politically motivated smear. A few weeks later, police in the Dominican Republic announced that three women had claimed they were paid $300‚Äì425 each to lie about having had sex with Menendez. Dominican law enforcement also alleged that the women had been paid to lie about Menendez by an individual claiming to work for The Daily Caller. The website denied this allegation, stating: \\"At no point did any money change hands between The Daily Caller and any sources or individuals connected with this investigation\\". Describing what it saw as the unraveling of The Daily Caller \\"scoop\\", the Poynter Institute wrote: \\"The Daily Caller stands by its reports, though apparently doesn't feel the need to prove its allegations right. = Fox News controversy = In March 2015, The Daily Caller columnist Mickey Kaus quit after editor Tucker Carlson refused to run a column critical of Fox News coverage of the immigration policy debate. Carlson, who works for Fox News, reportedly did not want The Daily Caller publishing criticism of a firm that employed him.  2016 presidential election  According to a study by Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, The Daily Caller was among the most popular sites on the right during the 2016 presidential election. The study also found that The Daily Caller provided \\"amplification and legitimation\\" for \\"the most extreme conspiracy sites\\", such as Truthfeed, InfoWars, The Gateway Pundit and Conservative Treehouse during the 2016 presidential election. The Daily Caller also \\"employed anti-immigrant narratives that echoed sentiments from the alt-right and white nationalists but without the explicitly racist and pro-segregation language.\\" In one of its most frequently shared stories, The Daily Caller falsely asserted that Morocco's King Mohammed VI flew Bill Clinton on a private jet, and that this had been omitted from the Clinton Foundation's tax disclosures. The Daily Caller also made the \\"utterly unsubstantiated and unsourced claim\\" that Hillary Clinton instructed Environmental Protection Agency \\"head Lisa Jackson to try to shut down Mosaic Fertilizer, described as America's largest phosphate mining company, in exchange for a $15 million donation to the Clinton Foundation from King Mohammed VI of Morocco, ostensibly to benefit Morocco's state-owned phosphate company.\\" Trump administration Daily Caller journalist Stephanie Hamill interviewing Republican Congressmember Andy Biggs in 2020. = Encouragement of violence against protesters = In January 2017, The Daily Caller posted a video which encouraged violence against protesters. The footage showed a car plowing through demonstrators, with the headline \\"Here's A Reel Of Cars Plowing Through Protesters Trying To Block The Road\\". The video clip was set to a cover of Ludacris' \\"Move Bitch.\\" This Daily Caller stub drew attention in August 2017 when a white supremacist plowed his car through a group of counterprotesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. After the video attracted attention, The Daily Caller deleted it from its website. = Stefan Halper = The Daily Caller was the first news outlet to report on Stefan Halper, a confidential FBI source, and his interactions with Trump campaign advisors Carter Page and George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about campaign matters. Page became the subject of surveillance warrants issued by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court regarding contacts with Russian intelligence officials. Other news outlets confirmed Halper's identity but did not report his identity because US intelligence officials warned that it would endanger him and his contacts. = Alleged Chinese email hacking = In August 2018, The Daily Caller ran a story alleging that a Chinese-owned company hacked then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and successfully obtained nearly all of her emails. The Daily Caller cited ‚Äútwo sources briefed on the matter.‚Äù After publishing the story, President Trump tweeted the allegations made in The Daily Callers unsubstantiated reporting. The FBI said any evidence was absent. = Imran Awan = The Daily Caller pushed conspiracy theories about Imran Awan, an IT worker for Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Daily Caller sought to tie Awan to many alleged criminal activities, including unauthorized access to government servers. The reporter behind the coverage of Awan told Fox News that the affair was \\"straight out of James Bond.\\" An 18-month investigation by federal prosecutors found no evidence of wrongdoing in Awan's work in the House and no support for the conspiracy theories about Awan. In the announcement of the conclusion of the investigation, investigators rebuked a litany of right-wing conspiracy theories about Awan. = Democratic representatives = In January 2019, The Daily Caller published a story with the misleading headline \\"Here's The Photo Some Described As A Nude Selfie Of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\\" The photo was not of Ocasio-Cortez. Ocasio-Cortez condemned The Daily Caller's action as \\"completely disgusting behavior.\\" The Daily Caller apologized for the headline, and changed it. The Daily Caller said that the content of the story was not unlike stories published by Vice and The Huffington Post. Vice had published an article debunking that the photo belonged to Ocasio-Cortez. = Derek Hunter resignation = In June 2020, attorneys for the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that former lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his associates secretly paid writers to promote AML Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency endorsed by Abramoff. The description of one article alleged to be part of the scheme matched a piece by Derek Hunter, a writer and podcast host for The Daily Caller. Hunter resigned from The Daily Caller while denying that he had been paid illicitly for any articles. = Threatened lawsuit against Louisville Metro Police Department = During The Daily Caller's coverage of protests in Louisville, Kentucky related to the shooting of Breonna Taylor and subsequent verdict on the police involved, two of their reporters were arrested, prompting co-founder Patel to threaten a lawsuit against the Louisville Metro Police Department.  Staff, contributors and organization  Daily Caller co-founder Tucker Carlson The Daily Caller is in the White House rotating press pool and has full-time reporters on Capitol Hill. Contributors to The Daily Caller have included economist Larry Kudlow, Congressman Mark Sanford, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, former US Senate Candidate and Judge Jeanine Pirro, sculptor Robert Mihaly, diplomat Alan Keyes, Ann Coulter, and the NRA-ILA. The Daily Caller hosts The Mirror, a blog written by former FishbowlDC editor and The Hill columnist Betsy Rothstein. The Mirror covers media in Washington D.C., news related to journalism organizations, as well as political and media related gossip. The tagline is, \\"Reflections of a self-obsessed city.\\"  Allegation of non-profit abuse  According to Callum Borchers of The Washington Post, The Daily Caller has \\"a peculiar business structure that enables it to increase revenue while reducing its tax obligation.\\" The organization, a for-profit company, does this by relying on its charity arm, The Daily Caller News Foundation, to create the majority of its news content. Lisa Graves of the Center for Media and Democracy argues, \\"It's a huge rip-off for taxpayers if The Daily Caller News Foundation is receiving revenue that it doesn't pay taxes on, to produce stories that are used by the for-profit enterprise, which then makes money on the stories through ads.\\" Benjamin M. Leff of American University writes, \\"But the fact that it also provides its content to other publishers for free is evidence that it is not operated for the private benefit of the for-profit, even if the for-profit is the dominant user of its content.\\"  Political stances  When it first launched in January 2010, Mercedes Bunz, writing for The Guardian, said The Daily Caller was \\"setting itself up to be the conservative answer to The Huffington Post\\". According to Bunz, a year before the website launched, Carlson promoted it as \\"a new political website leaning more to the right than Politico and TalkingPointsMemo\\". However, at launch, he wrote a letter to readers that said it was not going to be a right-wing site. \\"We're not going to suck up to people in power, the way so many have,\\" Carlson declared. During a January 2010 interview with Politico, Carlson said The Daily Caller was not going to be tied to his personal political ideologies and that he wanted it to be \\"breaking stories of importance\\". In a Washington Post article about The Daily Callers launch, Howard Kurtz wrote, \\"[Carlson's] partner is Neil Patel, a former Dick Cheney aide. His opinion editor is Moira Bagley, who spent 2008 as the Republican National Committee's press secretary. And his $3 million in funding comes from Wyoming financier Foster Friess, a big-time GOP donor. But Carlson insists this won't be a right-wing site\\". Kurtz quoted Carlson as saying, \\"We're not enforcing any kind of ideological orthodoxy on anyone\\". In an interview with The New York Times, Carlson said that the vast majority of traditional reporting comes from a liberal point of view and called The Daily Callers reporting \\"the balance against the rest of the conventional press\\". In a 2012 Washingtonian article, Tom Bartlett said Carlson and Patel developed The Daily Caller as \\"a conservative news site in the mold of the liberal Huffington Post but with more firearms coverage and fewer nipple-slip slide shows\\". In 2019, the Columbia Journalism Review described The Daily Caller as \\"right wing,\\" a description also used by Business Insider, Snopes, and Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. According to The Guardian in April 2019, The Daily Caller is known for its pro-Trump content.  Environmental issues = Climate change denial  The Daily Caller has published articles that dispute the scientific consensus on climate change. According to Science magazine, The Daily Callers \\"climate reporting focuses on doubt and highlights data that suggests climate concerns from the world‚Äôs leading science agencies and organizations are incorrect.\\" In 2017, The Daily Caller published a story falsely claiming that a \\"peer-reviewed study\\" by \\"two scientists and a veteran statistician\\" found that recent years have not been the warmest ever. The alleged \\"study\\" was a PDF file on a WordPress blog, and was neither peer-reviewed nor published in a scientific journal. Also in 2017, The Daily Caller uncritically published a bogus Daily Mail story which claimed that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) manipulated data to make climate change appear worse; at the same time, legitimate news outlets debunked the Daily Mail story, as did Media Matters. Also in 2017, The Daily Caller published a story claiming that a study found no evidence of accelerating temperatures over a 23-year period, which climate scientists described as a misleading story. In 2016, The Daily Caller published a story claiming that climate scientist Michael Mann (director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University) had asserted that data are unnecessary to measure climate change; Mann described the story as \\"egregiously false\\". In 2015, The Daily Caller wrote that NOAA \\"fiddle[d]\\" with data when the agency published a report concluding that there was no global warming hiatus.  False EPA stories  In 2011, the Daily Caller published a false story claiming that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was going to spend $21 billion per year to hire 230,000 staff to regulate greenhouse gas emissions; at the time, the EPA had 17,000 staff and a total budget of $8.7 billion. The story went viral in right-wing media, and Republican politicians repeated the story. Other news outlets noted that the story was false, but The Daily Caller stood by the story. Adweek reported that the decision of David Martosko, executive editor at The Daily Caller, to stand by the story caused dismay among some the website's staff, who believed the decision undermined the credibility of the outlet. In 2018, after a National Climate Assessment report about the impact of climate change in the United States was released by the Trump administration (which had been in the works for several years, stretching into the Obama presidency), Trump's EPA dismissed the report's findings. Trump's EPA falsely claimed that the Obama administration had pushed the authors of the report to focus on the worst-case scenario. In doing so, the EPA cited a Daily Caller story. FactCheck.Org wrote about The Daily Caller story that there was no evidence for the claims made, the report focused both on lower and higher scenarios, and much of the report looked at climate change impacts that had already occurred. FactCheck.Org noted that the report underwent multiple reviews, both internally and externally, and that the report was available for public review for a period of three months. The Daily Caller cited as evidence for its claims a memo that allegedly showed that the Obama administration pushed the authors of the report to include worst-case scenarios; FactCheck.Org noted the memo \\"does not show that the Obama administration pushed for certain scenarios.\\"  Ties to white supremacists  In September 2018, The Atlantic reported that Scott Greer, formerly a deputy editor and contributor at The Daily Caller, had written pieces under a pseudonym \\"Michael McGregor\\" in the white supremacist publication Radix Journal from 2014 to 2015. In articles for Radix Journal, Greer expressed white nationalist views, as well as racist anti-black and antisemitic views. While in his emails and messages, he expressed anti-Christian and antisemitic theories, as well his relationship with Richard Spencer. After being confronted with his past white supremacist writings, Greer resigned from any affiliation with The Daily Caller. In 2017 it was revealed that Scott Greer had ties to members of the white nationalist movement, including friendships with Devin Saucier, assistant to Jared Taylor of American Renaissance, and anti-immigrant activist Marcus Epstein of VDare, who had pled guilty to assaulting an African American woman two years prior to the beginning of his relationship with Scott Greer.The Daily Caller has a white nationalist problem August 21, 2017, STEPHEN PIGGOTT, ALEX AMEND, Salon Greer had later deleted parts of his Facebook page, but is seen photographed with white nationalists such as Spencer, Tim Dionisopoulos, the Wolves of Vinland, and also appears wearing clothes belonging to the group Youth for Western Civilization. The Daily Caller itself subsequently stated about why he had not been fired in 2017: \\"We had two choices: Fire a young man because of some photos taken of him at metal shows in college, or take his word. We chose to trust him. Now, if what you allege is accurate, we know that trust was a mistake, we know he lied to us. We won't publish him, anyone in these circles, or anyone who thinks like them. People who associate with these losers have no business writing for our company.\\" The Daily Caller has posted articles by Jason Kessler, a white supremacist who organized a rally of hundreds of white nationalists in Charlottesville. Before Kessler posted his article, he had spoken at white supremacist gatherings. After Kessler received attention for his organizing of the Charlottesville white supremacist rally, The Daily Caller removed his articles from its website, but The Daily Caller executive editor defended Kessler's articles. The website has also published pieces by Peter Brimelow, founder of the white supremacist website VDARE. The website has also published articles by David Hilton, an anti-Semite who has pushed conspiracy theories that Israel was behind the 9/11 attacks. In his articles for The Daily Caller, Hilton promoted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about George Soros, as well as conspiracy theories about \\"Cultural Marxism.\\" The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has said The Daily Caller has a \\"white nationalist problem\\", citing contributions by Kessler, Brimelow, Greer, and Ilana Mercer, whose writing on supposed racially motivated crime in South Africa have also been published in the white nationalist website American Renaissance. The SPLC later retracted its claim that Richard Pollock, a devout Jew, was a white nationalist, saying \\"Pollock was initially included in this story\\" but \\"there is no evidence to suggest Mr. Pollock is otherwise a white nationalist.\\"  Awards  *2012 Edward R.

Julius Caesar says that as Roman proconsul he made Tasgetius king in reward for his support during the Gallic Wars.Julius Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 5.25.2. Although Tasgetius is conventionally called a \\"king,\\" Caesar uses verbal phrases in reference to his rule rather than the noun rex: his ancestors regnum obtinuerant, \\"had held the kingship,\\" and Tasgetius was in his third year of ruling at the time of his murder: tertium iam hunc annum regnantem. His reign would have begun in late 57 BC, following Caesar's campaign against the Belgic civitates in northern Gaul that year; it ended with his assassination in 54 BC. The overthrow of a king appointed by Caesar was one of the precipitating events that led to the pan-Gallic rebellion of 52 BC under the Arvernian leader Vercingetorix.Stephen L. Dyson, \\"Native Revolts in the Roman Empire,\\" Historia 20 (1971), p. 242. Caesar's account Caesar gives only a succinct account of Tasgetius's reign and death: Political background The Carnutes held territory in Celtica on both sides of the Loire River (Latin Liger) The land of the Carnutes was regarded as the sacred center of Gaul where each year the druidry held their pan-Gallic synod.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 6.13.10. The late-19th-century historian of religion Alexandre Bertrand believed that the religious institution of the druids in Gaul, described most fully among the extant Greek and Latin sources by Caesar (BG 6.13‚Äì14), had a direct influence on the reception of Christianity in Western Europe, particularly in regard to the organization of monastic communities; see La religion des Gaulois: Les druides et le druidisme (Paris, 1897), appendix 2, pp. 417‚Äì424 online. Although Bertrand's highly conjectural argument was the object of immediate and vigorous attack ‚Äî see review by Gaston Boissier, Journal des Savants (1898) 574‚Äì580, especially 578ff. online ‚Äî the 20th-century art historian Walter Horn drew on scientific methodologies to trace pre-Christian influences on medieval architecture in the regions formerly inhabited by Celts; see \\"On the Origins of the Medieval Cloister,\\" Gesta 12 (1973) 13‚Äì52, and for discussion and major works, Academic career and scholarship. At any rate, the organization of the druids, with their oversight of religious matters, had existed in Gaul, and the medieval dioceses to which modern French departments more or less correspond were formed along pre-Roman political boundaries (see also Diocese: History) ‚Äî boundary disputes (de finibus controversia) being one of the juridical functions of the druids, according to Caesar (BG 6.13.5). Like several other of the larger polities in Gaul,Elections held by the Aedui are a major part of Caesar's narrative in Book 7; see 7.32‚Äì33 in particular. The last king of the Sequani was Catamantaloedes, whose son Casticus was accused of attempting to restore the monarchy (1.3.3). The kingship of the Arverni had evidently given way to oligarchy or a proto-republic after their defeat by the Romans in the 120s BC; in BG 7.4.1, Caesar says that Celtillus, the father of Vercingetorix, had been put to death by his people for his imperial ambitions (see also Bituitos, the last known Arvernian king). the Carnutes had once been ruled by kings, but seem to have adopted an oligarchic or proto-republican form of government. Rome often found it more convenient to deal with client states through centralizing power in a king rather than a fractious council or \\"senate,\\" as Caesar often refers to such bodies on analogy with the Roman senate.Sean B. Dunham, \\"Caesar's Perception of Gallic Social Structures,\\" in Celtic Chiefdom, Celtic State: The Evolution of Complex Social Systems in Prehistoric Europe (Cambridge University Press, 1995), pp. 110‚Äì115; David C. Braund, Rome and the Friendly King: The Character of the Client Kingship (Croom Helm, 1984) passim. The ancestors of Tasgetius had held supreme power, and his ascent was presented as a restoration. The Carnutes had perhaps preferred not to live under a monarchy again, since Caesar's royal appointment was assassinated by his fellow citizens. Caesar attributes opposition to Tasgetius to an anti- Roman faction among the Carnutes, but it has been arguedSerge Lewuillon, \\"Histoire, soci√©t√© et lutte des classes en Gaule: Une f√©odalit√© √† la fin de la r√©publique et au d√©but de l'empire. Tasg√©tios et C√©sar,\\" Aufstieg under Niedergang der r√∂mische Welt (1975), pp. 463‚Äì465 online. that the normal internal politics of Gaul were at play, which Caesar chose to exploit for his own purposes and propagandize as symptoms of a brewing rebellion. Caesar saysCaesar, Bellum Gallicum 6.4. that the Carnutes were assigned to the Remi, Rome's most loyal Belgic ally, as a client state; George Long thought this was probably a consequence of Tasgetius's murder. These formal relations existed usually among contiguous polities, but the territory of the Remi (roughly modern-day Champagne) was at some remove from that of the Carnutes.George Long, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, edited by William Smith (London, 1872), vol. 1, p. 523 online. Personal characteristics Caesar acknowledged the loss of Tasgetius by taking note of the goodwill (benevolentia) he had shown the proconsul. The word benevolentia appears only twice in the Bellum Gallicum; in Book 7, Caesar insists on his own goodwill toward the Aedui, despite their having joined the opposition to Rome.BG 7.43.4. In Latin usage contemporary with Caesar, the word is common in the letters and philosophical works of Cicero, who prefers it to the benignitas (\\"kindness\\") more likely to be encountered in other sources. Beneficia are kindnesses or good deeds, favors or good works; benevolentia is a cast of mind, a voluntary state of inclination that makes friendship possible. Writing about ten years after the death of Tasgetius, Cicero defines friendship as \\"a relationship based on agreement about all human and divine matters, together with goodwill (benevolentia) and affection.\\"Cicero, De amicitia 6.20: Omnium divinarum humanarumque rerum cum benevolentia et caritate consensio. But benevolentia, as a predisposition to form social relationships, also has an inherently utilitarian side, and after noting the benevolentia of Tasgetius, Caesar immediately remarks on his usefulness (usus).Wilkie Collins, The Brothers of Romulus: Fraternal pietas in Roman Law, Literature, and Society (Princeton University Press, 1997), pp. 67‚Äì69 online; Gloria Vivenza, \\"Classical Roots of Benevolence in Economic Thought,\\" in Ancient Economic Thought (Routledge, 1997), pp. 198‚Äì199, 204‚Äì208 online; Cicero's influence on patristic views, Carolinne White, Christian Friendship in the Fourth Century (Cambridge University Press, 1992, 2002), pp. 16‚Äì17 online, 32, and 255, note 13. It is equivalent to Greek eunoia. Tasgetius is one of only six individualsThree of the possessors of virtus are the Roman officers Gaius Volusenus (BG 3.5.2), Quintus Cicero (5.48.6), and Titus Labienus (7.59.6); a fourth is the Romanized Celt Valerius Troucillus, who held Roman citizenship and acted as diplomatic envoy and interpreter for Caesar. See Myles Anthony McDonnell, Roman Manliness: virtus and the Roman Republic (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 308 online. The centurions Vorenus and Pullo dispute each other's claim to virtus at 5.44. that Caesar praises in his Gallic war commentaries for virtus, the quality of true manhood (Latin vir, \\"man\\"), usually translated as \\"virtue\\" or \\"valor.\\" The only other man from independent Gaul said to possess virtus is Commius of the Atrebates, whom Caesar also installed as king but who chose during the Gallic uprising to assert the sovereignty of his people.Commios's virtus at Bellum Gallicum 4.21.7, the only instance of the word in Book 4. Caesar uses the word frequently in other books, most often to describe Roman soldiers collectively (for instance, in Book 1 at 40.4, 51.1, 40.15) or Celtic polities as a whole (again taking Book 1 as an example, the Helvetii at 1.4, 2.2, 13.4 thrice; Boii,1.28.4; Aedui, 1.31.7). The German king Ariovistus claims virtus for himself and his Germani at 1.36.7 and 1.44.1. See further discussion at Valerius Troucillus: Humanitas, virtus and becoming Roman. Although virtus is an active and potentially aggressive quality, benevolentia belongs to a class of Roman virtues characteristic of those who are kind, generous, and humane.Edwin S. Ramage, \\"Aspects of Propaganda in the De bello gallico: Caesar‚Äôs Virtues and Attributes,\\" Athenaeum 91 (2003) 331‚Äì372. Name and Celtic badger lore The name Tasgetius derives from Gaulish tasgos, also tascos or taxos, \\"badger,\\"Taisson is a French dialectal variant for \\"badger,\\" usually blaireau; see also Italian tasso and Spanish tejon. These are often derived from late Latin taxus, but the usual word for badger in Latin is meles, maeles or melo, melonis (mil, millonis in the Gallic medical writer Marcellus Empiricus, De medicamentis 33.7), and taxus is likely a borrowing from Gaulish. The word has also been related to Basque azkoin or asku, \\"badger,\\" with loss of the initial t from a reconstructed \\"pre-Basque\\" form *(t)askone. The Gaulish is sometimes thought to have been borrowed from Germanic (modern German Dachs), but the borrowing is more likely to have gone the other way. See discussion by Victor Hehn, The Wanderings of Plants and Animals from Their First Home (John Benjamins, 1976), pp. 493‚Äì494 online. an element found in many other Celtic personal names from inscriptions, such as Tascos, Tasgillus, Tassca, and Tasciovanus (\\"Badger Killer\\"), as well as in place names.Xavier Delamarre, Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise (√âditions Errance, 2003), pp. 292‚Äì293. Moritasgus (\\"Great Badger\\" or \\"Sea Badger\\"If Moritasgus is construed as \\"Sea Badger,\\" it may be a name for another animal (cf. \\"sea lion\\" in English) such as a seal or sea otter; see John T. Koch, Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-Clio, 2006), p. 231 online.) was the name of a ruler of the Senones contemporary with Tasgetius,Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 5.54. and was also the name of a Celtic healing deity in territory within the Aeduan sphere of influence (see Moritasgus). Another Celtic word for \\"badger,\\" broccos, also yields a number of personal and place names.Delmarre, Dictionnaire pp. 90‚Äì91. The European badger, in Gaulish tasgos: source for the pharmacological ingredient taxea The substance taxeaIsidore of Seville, Etymologiae 20.2.24. or adeps taxonina,Marcellus, De medicamentis 36.5, in a multi-ingredient preparation for podagram, \\"gout,\\" to be compounded for greatest efficacy in the month of August. \\"badger fat,\\" was regarded as medically potent and traded by Germanic and Celtic peoples to the Greeks and Romans.Joshua T. Katz, \\"Hittite ta≈°ku- and the Indo-European Word for ‚ÄòBadger‚Äô,\\" Historische Sprachforschung 111 (1998) 61‚Äì82. The 4th-century medical writer Marcellus, who was from Bordeaux and whose book De medicamentis is a unique source for Gallic herbology and lore, includes badger fat as an ingredient in his pharmacological recipes.Marcellus, De med. 33.7, 36.5. A short 5th-century treatise De taxone deals with the magico-medical properties of the badger, and prescribes the correct incantations to utter when dissecting the animal.The Epistula de taxone (also Epistola or Liber) is framed as a letter from a fictional Egyptian ruler named Idpartus (or Hidpartus) to the emperor Octavianus Augustus.

Although Isidore of Seville understands the word as equivalent to Latin lardum, \\"bacon, lard,\\"Isidore, Etymologiae 20.2.24: taxea lardum est Gallice dictum, \\"'taxea' is what lard is called in Gaulish.\\" taxea is a secretion of the badger's subcaudal glands comparable in its medicinal use to the better-known castoreum, an ingredient from the scent sacs of the beaver. Only the European species of badger possesses these subcaudal glands, which produce a pale-yellow fatty substance with a gentle musky scent.The anal glands, which the European badger shares with other badger species, secrete a rank and overpowering musk; see Julie Bonner Bellquist, \\"'Badger' in Indo-European,\\" Journal of Indo-European Studies 21 (1992) 331‚Äì346. Like the beaver, the badger was regarded in the classical tradition as one of the hermaphroditic animals.Luc Brisson, Sexual Ambivalence: Androgyny and Hermaphroditism in Graeco-Roman Antiquity (University of California Press, 2002), pp. 136‚Äì137 online. Primary among the medical uses of taxea was the treatment of impotence,Catherine Rider, Magic and Impotence in the Middle Ages (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 26 online. which casts a different swagger on a phrase from the Latin comic poet Afranius: \\"The cloaked Gaul, fattened up on badger grease.\\"Gallum sagatum pingui pastum taxea, quoted by Isidore, Etymologiae 20.2.24 (Com. Fragm. v. 284 Rib.) The Gaulish word tasgos may be related to an Indo-European root meaning \\"peg, stake,\\" because of the badger's pointed nose; it has been argued that the root can also have a phallic meaning, and that the use of taxea for impotence was thus a form of sympathetic magic.Joshua T. Katz, \\"Hittite ta≈°ku- and the Indo-European Word for ‚ÄòBadger‚Äô,\\" Historische Sprachforschung 111 (1998) 61‚Äì82. Katz notes that Epiphanius of Salamis called a heretical Christian sect from Galatia the Taskodrougitai, \\"Badger-snouts\\" or \\"Peg- noses,\\" referring to their attitude at prayer, with pointed finger touching nose. Galatia was formed in the 3rd century BC by migrating Celts, who continued to speak a Celtic language in the region as late as the time of Jerome. Although its cultural significance among the Celts of Gaul is murky, the badger appears much later as a totem animal for Tadhg mac C√©in, a legendary insular Celtic king whose name contains an Old Irish form for \\"badger.\\"Alan Mac an Bhaird, \\"Tadhg mac C√©in and the Badgers,\\" √âriu 31 (1983) 150‚Äì155; Bernhard Maier, Die Religion der Kelten: G√∂tter, Mythen, Weltbid (C.H.

The name (see Tadhg) is usually thought to mean \\"bard\\" or \\"poet,\\" but even this meaning has been connected to \\"badger\\" as a characterization of the fierce Celtic satirist of legend; see Delamarre, Dictionnaire de langue gauloise, p. 293. In Welsh lore, a number of games involved \\"playing badger,\\"Koch, Celtic Culture, p. 793. including in the first book of the Mabinogion where the game Broch ygkotBroch is the Welsh derivative of broccos, the other Celtic word for \\"badger.\\" (\\"a badger in a bag\\") is explained cryptically as \\"let him who is a head be a bridge.\\"A vo penn bit pont; E. Anwyl, \\"The Value of the Mabinogion for the Study of Celtic Religion,\\" Transactions of the Third International Congress for the History of Religions 2 (1908), p. 238 online. The narrative is presented as an aetiology of the game, involving two rivals for Rhiannon, her first husband Pwyll who carelessly loses her to Gwawl, and a magic bag that is Rhiannon's gift to Pwyll. The bag cannot be filled no matter how much food is put in it, and generosity can meet only with insatiability. Gwawl thinks that he can gain some infinite quality by climbing into the bag himself; thus captured, he receives beatings instead.For the significance of the bag in Celtic mythology, see W.M. Parker's note to his edition of Mabinogion 1, and American, African, and Old European Mythologies, edited by Yves Bonneoy and Wendy Doniger (University of Chicago, 1993), p. 207 online. Numismatics Drawing of bronze coin issued by Tasgetius (Tasgiitios) Tasgiitios, with the double i representing vowel lengthening,Joachim Lelewel, √âtudes numismatiques et arch√©ologiques: Type gaulois, ou celtique (Brussels, 1841), vol. 1, p. 228. appears on numerous examples of a bronze coin assumed to be issued by Caesar's friend. The coin depicts on its obverse a crowned head of \\"Apollo\\" with a three-lobed ivy leaf, a usual symbol of Dionysus, and the name or cult title ŒïŒõŒöŒïSŒüŒüŒ•ŒôŒû (Elkesovix). A winged horse, usually called \\"Pegasus\\" in numismatic literature, appears on the reverse with the name Tasgiitios. The obverse has been seen as imitating a Roman denarius of the gens Titia. Although a winged horse appeared on Celtic coins as early as the 3rd century BC,For an example, see the gold stater of the Mediomatrici, dated 3rd‚Äì2nd century BC, at CoinArchives.com, which is more likely to be modeled after Greek staters. during the period 60‚Äì50 BC the Roman moneyer Quintus Titius issued a series of denarii with Pegasus on the reverse and various figures on the obverse, including Apollo, a winged Victory, and a bearded figure sometimes identified as the Roman phallic god Mutunus Tutunus. The Apollo denarius of Titius may have been the model for Tasgetius's issue,Robert Forrer, Keltische Numismatik der Rhein- und Donaulande (Strassburg, 1908), p. 119. and the name Elkesovix has been interpreted as an epithet of Apollo,Bunnell Lewis, \\"Roman Antiquities in South Germany,\\" Archaeological Journal 58 (1901), pp. 290‚Äì291 online. Examples of Quintus Titius's other denarii with Pegasus on the reverse may be viewed at CoinArchive.com, including the winged Victory and Mutunus Tutunus. or as that of Tasgetius's grandfather or other ancestor.Lelewel, √âtudes numismatiques, vol. 1, p. 249 online. The appearance of an Apollo on the coin of the badger-named Tasgetius, and the \\"badger\\" semantic element in the name Moritasgus for a god equated with Apollo, raises the question of whether the god of healing was associated in Celtic religion and myth with an animal used in healing. A coin of the Suessiones dated ca. 60‚Äì50 BC ‚Äî that is, roughly contemporary with that of Tasgetius ‚Äî also depicts a winged horse on the reverse, which appears with the name Cricironus. The profile of the helmeted head on the obverse faces left instead of right.This coin of the Suessiones may be viewed at CoinArchives.com, where the winged horse is described as \\"Celticized Pegasos flying left.\\" Tasgetius's series has been studied in connection with the coins of Commius, the Atrebatan king also supported by Caesar.L. de la Saussaye, \\"Attribution d'une m√©daille en bronze √† Tasget, roi des Carnutes,\\" Revue de la numismatique fran√ßoise 2 (1837), p. 1 online. A hoard discovered in 1956 at the fork of a Gallic road included coins of Tasgetius. It is estimated to have been buried in 51 BC. The coins may have been hidden by refugee Carnutes during the last campaigns of the Gallic Wars in Belgica, as narrated by Aulus Hirtius in his continuation (Book 8) of Caesar's commentaries.Jean-Mary Couderc, \\"Un pont antique sur la Loire en Aval de Tours,\\" in La Loire et les fleuves de la Gaule romaine et des r√©gions voisines (Presses Universitaires de Limoges, 2001), p. 63 online.

Her hull was constructed in Poland and she was built in Germany, to provide state-of-the-art facilities for the group's use, including advanced telecommunication equipment, specialised scientific equipment and a helicopter landing pad. The ship is also designed to be one of the \\"greenest\\" ships afloat, and to showcase this quality, it runs primarily using wind power, with a 55 m mast system which carries 1255 sq meters of sail and is backed up by a \\"state-of-the-art hybrid\\". On board the ship can store up to 59 cubic meters of greywater and blackwater, avoiding the need for disposal at sea. All materials, from the paintwork to the insulation, have been chosen with a view to sustainability, and each component has been supplied with transparent ethical sourcing. Construction and crowdfunding Inside the bridge Construction of the ship began in the summer of 2010 in Gdansk before being transported to the Fassmer Shipyard near Bremen in Germany to be fitted out before being launched in October 2011. The ship was in part funded by a crowd funding project set up by Greenpeace. Supporters were encouraged to buy parts of the ship through a specifically designed website. Supporters in turn received a certificate for their contribution and had their names etched onto a digital artwork on board the vessel. The website live- streamed names and messages, tying people directly to the part of the ship they contributed to. The multimedia site was also accompanied by a webcam allowing people to follow the ship's construction up to its launch date. The project received over 100,000 donors from around the world. First tour After its launch in Bremerhaven, Germany, the new Rainbow Warrior toured ports in Europe (Hamburg, Amsterdam, London, Stockholm and Barcelona) welcoming supporters on board the new ship and holding specific events such as onboard concerts. The ship was also visited by celebrity supporters such as Radiohead's Thom Yorke, who was part of the ship's maiden voyage, and Michelin two-starred chef Diego Guerrero in Barcelona. In January 2012, the ship travelled to the East Coast of the USA, planning to dock at New York City, Baltimore, Southport, North Carolina, Fort Lauderdale and St. Petersburg, Florida. In March 2013, the ship travelled to Australia.

French intelligence and, diplomacy at the highest level as well as the other Western intelligence agencies such as Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (SIS a.k.a. MI6) and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) were involved in the operations. Other contributors included politicians, celebrities, business people and triad members from Hong Kong‚Äîforming the \\"unlikely\\" alliance which sustained the operation for most of its duration. The operation began in late June 1989, following the issuing of an order by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau on 13 June 1989 to apprehend the leaders of the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation who were on the run. The operation continued until 1997.ÁáüÊïëÂÖ´‰πùÊ∞ëÈÅãÈ†òË¢ñ ÂâçÁ∑öÁ∏ΩÊåáÊèÆÈ¶ñÊ¨°Êä´Èú≤ Apple Daily, 28 May 2009 Yellowbird successfully helped more than 400 dissidents, who were smuggled through Hong Kong, and then onwards to Western countries. Some escapees included Wu'erkaixi, Chai Ling, Li Lu, Feng Congde, Chen Yizi, and Su Xiaokang. Three Hong Kong based activists were arrested by the Chinese authorities, but later released after intervention by the Hong Kong government. Etymology The operation obtained its name from the Chinese expression \\"The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the yellow bird behind\\" (). Reverend Chu Yiu-Ming, a core member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China during 1989, also asserted that the name originated from the Haitian folk song \\"Yellow Bird\\". In an interview with South China Morning Post, he explained that the group \\"wanted the activists to fly freely in the sky, just like the yellow birds\\". Background Days after the Chinese government suppressed the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Beijing issued a wanted list of ringleaders of the protests. In response, activists in Hong Kong, including the Hong Kong \\"Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China\\", set up Operation Yellowbird in mid- June 1989 to help wanted activists escape from China.Lee, Samson; Wong, Natalie (12 July 2011) \\"Praise for Brit agents who helped students\\" . The Standard According to The Washington Post, after the Beijing protest crackdown, this group drew up an initial list of 40 dissidents they believed could form the nucleus of \\"a Chinese democracy movement in exile\\", with the help of the western intelligence agencies, and Asia's mafia, the Triads. Financing According to the posthumously-published memoirs of veteran Hong Kong political figure and leader of the Alliance, Szeto Wah, Yellowbird was financed mainly by Hong Kong businessmen and celebrities who sympathised with the plight of the activists, but extensive assistance also came from the colonial government. The organizers of the Operation spent upwards of HK$600,000 (US$64,000) to rescue each activist and to cover other expenses to get them abroad. Amounts spent on the rescue would vary between HK$50,000 and $500,000 depending on the specific logistics taking account of the political risks, and number of attempts. More than HK$600,000 was spent and three attempts made before Wu'erkaixi managed to escape.Wong, Natalie (12 July 2011) \\"Let down by self-centered Chai Ling\\" . The Standard In addition, triad members who managed the smuggling routes inside China requested payments of about US$25,000 for every attempt, regardless of its success or failure. Assistance from boat owners, who occasionally had triad connections, cost around HK$200,000 for the transportation of four to five passengers. The operation was financed by Hong Kong businessmen, and a mobster, according to Newsweek; activists had initially collected $260,000 in donations from businessmen to fund the operation. One such businessman is Lo Hoi-sing, who was arrested during the operation.Ê∞ëÈÅã‰∫∫Â£´Ë¶ÅÂâùÂÖâË±¨È©óË≠â Ê∏ØËã±È´òÂ±§ÂäõÂã∏ÈªÉÈõÄÊ†∏ÂøÉÔºöÂà•Ëµ∞ËøëÊµ∑ÈÇä Apple Daily 22 May 2009 Other benefactors included chanteuse Anita Mui and filmmaker Alan Tang. According to Szeto, both lent significant financial and material support to help activists. Szeto said, \\"Tang had a lot of influence in Macau and got involved personally to save time but he remained low-key and never claimed his share of glory.\\"Lee, Diana and Wong, Natalie (12 July 2011) \\"Stars who played their part\\" . The Standard Within China, considerable financial backing for the operation came from a variety of sources, such as business personalities and ordinary citizens who sympathized with the activists. Diplomats in Hong Kong were also able to help by obtaining visas for the escapees' departures to various countries. Funds were used for the costs of smuggling individuals directly out of mainland China, as well as for financial assistance for other dissidents who made it to Hong Kong by themselves. Rescue money was mainly raised privately by the Operation, for fear of alerting British authorities at the time who were being careful before Hong Kong's transfer to China in 1997. There were worries about possible repercussions from Beijing if any knowledge of assistance given to the dissidents were revealed. Nonetheless, Yellow Bird managed to gather funds of around US$2,000,000 from the business community in its early beginnings. Success and details of the Operation Closely following the aftermath of the protests, 7 of the 21 most wanted students escaped China through the operation's assistance; although some had no knowledge of its existence at the time. These seven individuals were Wu‚Äôer Kaixi, Chai Ling, Feng Congde, Li Lu, Liang Qingtun, Wang Chaohua and Zhang Boli, while the remaining fourteen on the list had either turned themselves in or were subsequently captured. In its entirety, Yellowbird successfully helped more than 400 dissidents, who were smuggled through Hong Kong, and then onwards to Western countries. Some other escapees include Chen Yizi and Yan Jiaqi, senior government advisers to Zhao Ziyang at the time, along with the wanted intellectual, Su Xiaokang. In addition to pro-democracy activists, defected People's Liberation Army soldiers and police staff who provided aid to the operation were also rescued, some of whom carried weapons when they arrived in Hong Kong.ÊÄíÊµ∑Â≠§Ëàü‚Äî‚ÄîÈªÉÈõÄË°åÂãïËàáÊàë Apple Daily 28 May 2009 Escape teams from Hong Kong were sent into China with the cover of being specially formed trading companies. The rescue missions began with locating specific dissidents from the information and tips received by the Alliance about their whereabouts. Great care was taken to ensure the identities of the fugitives: code phrases or matching halves of a photograph allowed either parties to recognize and trust the other. False documents and disguises were also used once the individuals were verified, with some teams enlisting make-up artists for this purpose. After locating the dissidents, groups had to quickly facilitate their transportation to Hong Kong. The cooperation of the triads gave the Alliance access to existing smuggling networks and extensive contacts. The collaborating groups agreed to provide free assistance for the operation but demanded that their associates on either side of the border be paid. Although the triads made certain connections possible, most of the smugglers involved in the rescue operations were not triad members themselves. Escapees generally reached Guangdong, through the help of sympathizers and escape teams who hid them in houses, factories and warehouses, where they were then taken to Hong Kong. The individuals were whisked away on speedboats late at night or stowed as ship cargo to avoid being caught. Smugglers relied on their contacts within the Chinese police and coast guards to ensure successful trips, while other customs and immigration officials were occasionally bribed to turn a blind eye. According to The Washington Post, the operation had contacts within \\"government departments, local public security bureaus, border troops, the coast guards, [and] even radar operators\\". Four main routes were used to get dissidents from Guangdong to Hong Kong: Shekou to Tuen Mun's Castle Peak Power Station, Huidong to Chai Wan, Shanwei to Wong Chuk Hang and Nan‚Äôao to Sai Kung. A fifth passage, Chung Ying Street in Sha Tau Kok, was also an option for escapees since one side belonged to Hong Kong and the other to mainland China. Once arriving in Hong Kong, dissidents would be hidden in different safe houses while preparations for their final departures were being made. Shelters such as Nai Chung camp in Sai Kung housed up to 30 activists at a time during its peak. Newsweek maintains that these rescue squads made incursions into Chinese territory, while US and British intelligence operatives were involved in the extractions. However, former US Ambassador to China, James Lilley, said Americans were involved \\"almost exclusively in legal exfiltrations\\". There was cooperation from foreign embassies for the asylum- seekers. The CIA supplied materiel in the form of sophisticated equipment and other means of escape and subterfuge, and even weapons. Chan Tat-Ching, or Brother Six, also helped with the operation as he had access to different speedboats and smugglers who specialized in moving goods between mainland China and Hong Kong. He was described as a mastermind of the operation. Chan and his partners created an 18-page plan for the dissidents' escape, encompassing various details such as routes, secret signals and contact points. His one rule for working with Yellow Bird was that under no circumstance should he or his associates be known to the individuals they were rescuing. Szeto's memoirs detail how the operation was highly confidential, and known to only six members of the Alliance. However, Chan, referred to by Szeto as only a logistician commanders, allegedly compromised the operation by divulging escape routes to mainland officials after his brother was arrested, and was sacked by Szeto. British authorities allowed the operation to continue, disregarding how dissidents entered the colony so long as they left to another country quickly and quietly. Diplomats and officials worked at Kai Tak airport to secure departures that avoided usual bureaucratic channels, thus minimizing scrutiny from immigration officials and press for the fugitives. In an interview with Bloomberg, Alistair Asprey, former Secretary for Security in Hong Kong, said that officials met with staff of foreign consulates on different occasions to ask about accepting dissidents. Chu Yiu- ming, a core member of the Alliance, also sent letters to foreign governments requesting their approval of asylum applications. Some escapees were able to flee to the United States as well as to France, which was said to be the \\"most accommodating\\", according to Yellow Bird organizers.  Problems and end of the Operation  Yellow Bird encountered several complications throughout its duration. Different circumstances forced Chan Tat-Ching to withdraw from the operation, just after he had facilitated the retrieval of a total of 133 individuals. In an early instance, two of his men and an escaping student perished in a boat crash. On 13 October 1989, another two of his men were arrested after an attempt to rescue intellectuals Chen Ziming and Wang Juntao was revealed to be a sting operation. They had received false information about the two wanted intellectuals and were apprehended by Chinese police officers when they came to identify the men. Chan travelled to Beijing in 1990 and secured the release of his two operatives in exchange for terminating his involvement with any additional fugitives. Chan himself managed to 'negotiate' himself out of trouble with the PRC in 1991, having convinced certain official interlocutors that his intentions were patriotic. However, Chan was seriously injured after being attacked by unknown assailants in Hong Kong in 1996. Three Hong Kong based activists associated with the Operation were arrested by Chinese authorities on the mainland, but later released after intervention by Hong Kong's government. In 2002, Hong Kong democrat Leung Wah, who was also involved in the operation, died in mysterious circumstances in neighbouring Shenzhen. Although it was never proven one way or another, Leung's associates believe that he died at the hands of PRC security agents. The operation proceeded until 1997, when Hong Kong's sovereignty was transferred to China. Some escapees had remained in the city for years, awaiting their withdrawal, which came when diplomatic efforts were frantically made in the months before the colony's return.

The Gibson neighborhood is a community area in Omaha, Nebraska abutting the Gibson Bend.  Location  The Gibson Bend of the Missouri River is located in Omaha, Nebraska approximately where Hascall Street would intersect the river. The Gibson yards of the Burlington Northern Railroad are also located at this bend in the river on the bottoms. In 1952 the flood was contained by the dike built there from soil taken out of the hills behind Burlington's roundhouse. Interstate 80 went over the Missouri River at that point.  Indian Mounds  Located exactly ten miles above the Platte River, it was in this spot that explorers Lewis and Clark placed mounds on their maps and mentioned them in their journals. Noting a few dozen \\"Indian Mounds\\" in the area, they suggested the mounds covered a location of approximately two hundred acres. Clark drew these on his map with x's and triangles suggesting the area was the site of an ancient village of the Otoes and some of the crew swam the horses over and examined them for a day. However, in 2002, the Nebraska Department of Roads conducted an archeological survey of the Gibson area. Working in conjunction with the Nebraska State Historical Society, they concluded all archeological deposits were destroyed by previous re-grading and terracing, and there are no archeological sites there today.(2005) \\"South Omaha Veterans Memorial Bridge, Omaha, Nebraska and Council Bluffs, Iowa: Final Environmental Impact Statement.\\" US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Nebraska Department of Roads, Iowa Department of Transportation. p. 3.65.

His judgment in a case of R. (Egan) v. Macready is still influential. Background and education Born on 31 December 1854, he was the third son of Charles Andrew O'Connor, solicitor, of Roscommon.Walford (1919), p. 1008 His mother Catherine was the daughter of C. G. Smyth. O'Connor was educated at St Stanislaus College and went then to Trinity College, Dublin, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1876, and in 1877 was elected Auditor of the College Historical Society.Ball (2005), p. 383 In 1876, he was admitted to the Middle Temple and two years later he was called to the Irish Bar.Debrett (1922), p. 350 In 1890, he obtained his Master of Arts. Judicial career O'Connor was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1894 and was chosen a bencher after two years. He was appointed First Serjeant in 1907 and became Solicitor-General for Ireland two years later. In 1911, he took over as Attorney-General for Ireland, on which occasion he was sworn of the Privy Council of Ireland. In the following year, he succeeded as Master of the Rolls in Ireland, which he held until the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. O'Connor retained the position in the new state for the next two years until its abolition in 1924. Subsequently, he received an appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court of the Irish Free State, retiring after one year in 1925.Who's Who (1926), p. 2176 He was one of only two judges of the old regime who were thought worth retaining by the new Irish Government, which acted on the advice of Hugh Kennedy, the first Chief Justice of Ireland, who believed that O'Connor had demonstrated his integrity and independence of mind in the Egan case (below). Notable judgments Although his training had been in Chancery, O'Connor is best remembered for two notable judgments in the field of habeas corpus, both a product of the political turmoil of the period 1919‚Äì1923. In R. (Egan) v. Macready[1921] 1 I.R. 265 he found that the power to declare martial law imposed by the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920 did not confer a power to impose the death penalty, and ordered the release of the applicant Egan, who was under sentence of death. When Nevil Macready, the Commander in Chief refused to comply, O'Connor caused a sensation by ordering his attachment for contempt of court. Egan was then released. The judgment was extremely influential, although one crucial finding that there is no limit to the number of habeas corpus applications which can be made by a single applicant has been much debated, and in Ireland itself was modified by the Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland. His judgment in Application of ChildersIrish High Court, 21 November 1922 is a striking contrast. Erskine Childers, one of the leaders of the Anti-Treaty side during the Irish Civil War, was captured by Government forces, court-martialled and sentenced to death in November 1922. O'Connor refused to interfere, finding that the formative Irish Free State, unlike General Macready, did have power to establish military courts that could impose the death penalty. He summed up: While O'Connor was universally regarded as a man of integrity, who would never consciously bend the law, it is possible that his attitude had hardened since Egan; certainly it cannot have helped Childers that his allies had destroyed the Four Courts, a fact to which O'Connor drew attention in stressing the magnitude of the problems which the new Government faced. Childers appealed, but before this could be heard, he was executed three days later. Family In 1890, O'Connor married Blanche, the daughter of James Scully. He died in 1928.The Law Journal (1928), p. 215 Character Maurice Healy praised O'Connor as \\"the greatest gentleman at the Irish Bar\\" and an extremely popular judge, even if he did not fully live up to expectations.Healy, Maurice, The Old Munster Circuit, 1939 Mercier Press reissue, pp. 269‚Äì70 O'Connor was modest about his own abilities, noting in Egan that if he differed from colleagues with more experience of criminal law, it was not because he thought himself in any way superior to them. His main personal foible is said by Healy to have been his pride in belonging to the Clan O'Connor and a tendency to bore listeners with its history.

Early life and education Lyons was born in New Haven, Connecticut. At the age of 9, he began to study ballroom dancing.

On October 2, 1966, as winners, Lyons and Penny Sousa appeared on Season 20, episode 4 of The Ed Sullivan Show on CBS. Author Based on his clinical experience in plastic surgery, Lyons developed three central impressions: that there are different types of fat in the adult female body, including one he identified as structural brown fat; that the more brown fat a woman has, the leaner she tends to be; and that different types of fat can be moderated by lifestyle, diet, and exercise. In April 2009, the scientific community released information confirming Lyons' impressions that fat could be rejuvenated by exercise and diet.

Lyons developed a nutrition and exercise program for women designed to convert yellow fat into brown fat, with a goal of improving health and fitness without losing subcutaneous volume needed to prevent wrinkles, sagging, and other signs of aging. The plan, built on his experience as a bodybuilder and professional dancer, involved an eating cycle that alternates between days focused on proteins and carbohydrates. The exercise program focused on building a strong core to raise the metabolism and create a strong hub of lean muscle.James R.

A matriname given from a mother to a child is unchanged, as compared to a matronymic, which is a derived name given from a child's mother. The term \\"matriname\\" was introduced by Prof. Bryan Sykes in his book The Seven Daughters of Eve, stating that \\"We would then all have three names: a first name, a surname and a new one, a matriname perhaps.\\"Sykes, Bryan (2001). The Seven Daughters of Eve. W.W. Norton. ; pp. 291‚Äì2. Professor Bryan Sykes uses \\"matriname\\", only, and states that women adding their own matriname to men's patriname (or \\"surname\\" as Sykes calls it) would really help in future genealogy work and historical-record searches. This effectively suggests the double surname presented in this article. Professor Sykes also states on p. 292 that a woman's matriname will be handed down with her mtDNA, the main topic of his book. Single surname Some matrilineal cultures use surname, in which case they often would use matriname. The Minangkabau people and the Mosuo for example use matriname. Although the term \\"maternal surname\\" can be confused with \\"matriname\\", there is a difference in patrilineal cultures, where the maternal surname is the mother's patriname, or father's last name. In addition, in some cultures, women inherit a surname from their mother as well as from their father. In such patrilineal cultures, matrinames are able to co-exist with patrinames. The usual lack of matrinames to hand down in patrilineal cultures makes traditional genealogy more difficult in the mother- line case than in the normal (father-line) case. After all, father-line surnames originated partly to identify individuals clearly and were adopted partly for administrative reasons; and these patrinames help in searching for facts and documentation from centuries ago. Patrinames are stable identity- surnames, surnames which identify an individual, whether now or in the past or future; and matrinames similarly are identity-surnames for women. In the 1979 \\"Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women,\\" or CEDAW, the UN officially adopted a provision, item (g) of CEDAW's Article 16, to the effect that women and men, and specifically wife and husband, shall have the same rights to choose a \\"family name\\", as well as a \\"profession\\" and an \\"occupation\\".UN Convention, 1979. \\"Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women\\", or CEDAW. Archived at WebCite on 1 Apr 2011. These three rights are only a small part of the document's long list of rights related to gender equality meant to ensure women have equal opportunities to men. However, according to the article, the United States has not yet ratified this UN Convention or the multilateral treaty. In non-discriminating states, women may eventually gain the same right to their own matriname as men have traditionally had (within father-line cultures) to their own patriname. And similarly, within mother-line or matrilineal cultures, men may gain the right to their own patriname. In other words, the handing down of both matrinames and patrinames would co-exist within each culture to avoid discriminating against either women or men. (Note that some cultures have no surnames but if a culture has surnames then in this regard a non-discriminating culture would be a both-lines [mother-line and father-line] or ambilineal culture.) The actual use of a matriname would involve, first, invention or choice of a name by a group of women who share mtDNA (from their common matriline ancestor)Stannard, Una (1977). Mrs Man. San Francisco: Germainbooks. ; pp. 334‚Äì37. and then using it in their daughters' birth records (or birth certificates). This use of the mother's matriname would be parallel to and symmetric with the normal use of the father's patriname in each new son's birth record. Note well; this is the above-mentioned \\"handing down of both\\" the matriname and the patriname. It should be mentioned that the patriname is normally a single surname, like Smith or Jones, normally not a double surname like Smith-Jones or Smith Jones. And, just as men normally do not change their patriname, so also women would normally not change their matriname. Thus, both identity-surnames should be equally stable over the generations. Note that one's birth surname is one's legal surname, unless one changes the latter such as in some purely patrilineal cultures where women traditionally change to their husband's patriname at marriage, as described in Married and maiden names and in Name change. Here is a specific example to illustrate and summarize these concepts: the father and sons in a nuclear family have the very-familiar patriname Smith while the mother and daughters have the matriname Momline as their own (and thus equally stable) identity-surname. Double surname Some cultures use both paternal and maternal surname, such as Spanish naming customs, Portuguese name, and naming customs of Hispanic America. Again, there exist the distinction between inheriting the mother's patriname and inheriting the mother's matriname. The patrilineal surname or patriname that is received from the mother in patrilineal cultures does not qualify as a matriname. There exist variation in the ordering and whether to hyphenate the surnames. Conventions of double surnames were proposed in The Seven Daughters of Eve, and an English family with the matriname \\"Phythian\\" actually used one of them, as demonstrated and discussed in an online \\"feature\\" article.Sarah Louisa Phythian-Adams, 20 Aug. 2008. \\"In the Name of... \\", an TheFWord.org featured article by the author. (To find the family tree etc. of this pioneering matriname double-surname case, search the article for the word \\"proposal\\".) Archived at WebCite on 1 Apr 2011. As a hypothetical example of these double surnames, let the matrinames be \\"Mamaname\\" and \\"Momline\\" and the patrinames be \\"Smith\\" and \\"Jones\\". The mother, with birth double surname \\"Momline-Jones\\", and the father, with birth double surname \\"Mamaname Smith\\", both choose to retain their birth double surnames unchanged throughout their lives and agree in some wise to denominate all of their daughters and sons with the birth double surname \\"Smith Momline\\": The mother hands down her matriname and, symmetrically, the father hands down his patriname. All of their sons have the Y-DNA of and, accordingly, the patriname \\"Smith\\" of their patriline, while all of the daughters have both the mtDNA of and, accordingly, the matriname \\"Momline\\" of their matriline. (Note that most societies give all children of a family the same surname, as in this example.) Thus, each person has only one identity-surname, which in this example is either \\"Momline\\" or \\"Smith\\". The identity-surname of each is stable throughout life and always half of whatever double surname(s) he or she assumes throughout life, including at birth and marriage(s). The family in this hypothetical example could choose to adopt a convention, given its 3 co- existing surnames \\"Momline-Jones\\", \\"Mamaname Smith\\", and \\"Smith Momline\\", of all members using only one family \\"usage name\\" in daily social life. Possible samples of this family's usage name might be any one of its 3 co-existing double surnames; one of its identity-surnames \\"Momline\\" or \\"Smith\\"; or an invented surname, e. g., \\"Momith\\", which combines \\"Momline\\" and \\"Smith\\". Stannard 1977; pp. 334‚Äì37 on actual invented surnames and pp. 84‚Äì88 on double surnames. Single surname families could use such usage names also. There is some relevant discussion in this footnote. This family's 3 surnames, however, should be used in their respective members' personal legal documents, and could also be used otherwise such as in the respective members' personal profession/vocation. Rather than keeping their own birth or legal surnames, the parents in this example might prefer at marriage to change their surnames to \\"Smith Momline\\", the same as their children-to-be, so that the members of their nuclear family would all share this one surname. Of course, one's own identity-surname (here, the matriname \\"Momline\\" or the patriname \\"Smith\\") would always be available as one's own usage name, such as in one's profession/vocation. This double surname example should be compared with its single surname counterpart at the end of the preceding section. In toto, the gender-symmetric single surnames presented in the preceding section have the advantage of being simpler and briefer, but if used alone, would give different surnames for members of the different genders in a nuclear family.

The Indian River begins at the mouth of Brook Trout Lake in the West Canada Lakes region of the southwest Adirondack Mountains. The river flows into the South Branch Moose River. Course Traveling downstream from Brook Trout Lake, the Indian River picks up the Cobblestone Creek coming in on its left, just before it forms the Green Stillwater, a 1/2 mile long flatwater section at the base of Indian Mountain. Then the river forms a series of rapids for a half mile or so before it slows and forms what is locally called the Big Eddy, a deep pool where the river makes a hard left. After this, the outlet of Mountain Lake joins the Indian River from the left, only 50' below what once was the first crossing of the river, a log bridge that loggers constructed back in the 1960s, in order to bring their logs out to market from the deep woods. The bridge was destroyed by authorities in the 1970s, about when the Indian was declared a wild river by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Now the river again drops down a series of rapids, and picks up the outlet to Horn Lake and Ice Cave Creek, both from the left, as it bends around right. The rapids continue for a while, and then pass the second crossing, another logger's bridge that was destroyed. This cut off the road to Horn, and to Cahans Farm, an old homestead way back in the woods below Ice Cave Mountain, and on the way to Canachagala Mountain and Natural Hatchery Brook. Once the river passes this second crossing, it's all flatwater for over a mile, with Stink Lake Mountain to the left, as it winds its way to the South Branch Moose River. It soon is joined by the outlet of Beaver Lake, past a few short rapids in the backwoods, and past a small island before converging with the South Branch Moose River, a mile or so above Rock Dam.

Life Kurt Aepli completed his education as a silversmith at the School of Applied Arts (today, the Berufschule f√ºr Gestaltung) in Zurich between 1934 and 1939. Due to the mobilization of the Swiss military during World War II, he went straight on to four years of active duty. In 1942 he took the position of head designer in the studio of Meinrad Burch-Korrodi, and before long he developed the signature style by which both the jewelry and particularly the ecclesiastical implements he designed can be recognized. He left his mark as a trailblazer of Christian sacral art in Switzerland during the second half of the 20th century, about the same time as the church builder and designer Fritz Metzger and the painter Ferdinand Gehr, both of whom he held in high esteem. It is hardly coincidental that Kurt Aepli‚Äôs creative output peaked during the period of expectation that was associated with the Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican 1962 through 1965. There is little doubt that the economic boom following WWII had been good for the jewelry trade, because when Christoph Trudel took over the business from Meinrad Burch in 1967, Kurt Aepli was so soundly established that the creative freedom granted by Trudel Juwelier was practically without limit. Between 1946 and 1980, Kurt Aepli was a member of the Swiss Work Federation (Schweizerischer Werkbund, or SWB), an association dedicated to the debate of creative issues and the development of design. Like for so many successful creative minds of the thirties, the Zurich School of Concrete and Constructive Art made a profound impression. Artists like Johannes Itten, Max Bill and Richard P. Lohse, but also the Bauhaus were each of most apparent influence throughout Kurt Aepli‚Äôs entire career. Creative output The success of the companies Burch-Korrodi and Trudel Juwelier was due in large part to the professional-technical know-how and the creative contribution of Kurt Aepli. In the studio of Meinrad Burch the almost legendary ‚ÄûGoldsmith- triumvirate‚Äú, as it was referred to locally in the trade, would eventually develop. It consisted of Kurt Aepli (Chief Designer), Martin Bucher (Chef d‚Äôatelier) and Berger Bergersen (Master Enameler), all three of whom were professionally and technically equally adept, complemented one another's respective fields of expertise and got along famously as a team. Aepli‚Äôs style might best be described as the evolution of Modernism, the Bauhaus and Art D√©co. Using a scientific approach, compositions would methodically evolve from the basic geometric shapes, using nothing but flat, square or round stock. Yet a close observation of nature and its creations led him to conclude that there were no incorrect forms, colors or sounds in nature, which is recognizable throughout his decade-long creative activity. This dynamic was maximized by the inclusive application of high-value materials. Lines, forms and shapes were pared down to their essence in a sure-footed manner that was as consistent as it was calculating. As a consequence, these pieces required the most exacting standards of execution. Jewelry, frequently using unusual gemstones, and ecclesiastical implements were created by him, both at Burch- Korrodi, as well as later at Trudel Juwelier. Besides designing, Kurt Aepli frequently carried out the silversmithing jobs himself. Although the clientele consisted mainly of aficionados and collectors, the name of Kurt Aepli was little known to the general public. For decades, his oeuvre was shrouded under the studio of Burch-Korrodi. Although this manner of prescribed anonymity bothered him, his unmistakable style left its mark on goldsmiths and silversmiths, reaching far beyond the German-speaking part of Switzerland, particularly north of the Alps. He set new standards for the creation of jewelry and implements. Educational career 1945 Kurt Aepli was elected specialist subject teacher to the School of Arts in Zurich, which would remain under the direction of Johannes Itten until 1954. He taught goldsmiths, silversmiths, chasers, engravers, metal spinners, gemstone setters, designers and metal polishers. All student apprentices in the school district of Zurich from these professions learned their respective trade theory, gemology and rendering from him. Besides teaching compulsory trade curricula, Aepli also taught continuing education night classes at the School of Arts in Zurich, providing tradespersons with an opportunity to further their skills in silversmith techniques. Here too, the creative abilities of Kurt Aepli were greatly appreciated by students, leaving their mark on many of them. He retired from his thirty-five-year career as an educator at the School of Arts in Zurich in April 1980.

In 2010, two federal courts ruled the ban on openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual service personnel unconstitutional, and on July 6, 2011, a federal appeals court suspended the DADT policy. In December 2010, the House and Senate passed and President Barack Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, and under its provisions, restrictions on service by gay, lesbian, and bisexual personnel ended as of September 20, 2011.  History = Early years  To train the new American Army in the latest military drills and tactics, General George Washington brought in Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben (1730‚Äì94), who had been an officer on the German General staff. Von Steuben escaped Germany where he was threatened with prosecution for homosexuality. He joined Washington's army at Valley Forge in February 1778 accompanied by two young aides. Steuben became an American general, and a senior advisor to Washington. Despite rumors about his parties, there never was an investigation of Steuben and he received a Congressional pension after the war. The first evidence of antipathy to homosexuals serving in the United States military dates from March 11, 1778, when Lieutenant Frederick Gotthold Enslin was drummed out of the Continental Army following his conviction at court-martial on charges of sodomy and perjury.  1910s‚Äì1940s  The U.S. military discharged soldiers for homosexual acts throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century even in the absence of any explicit prohibition of sodomy. The Articles of War of the United States of 1916, implemented on March 1, 1917, included Article 93 stating that any person subject to military law who committed \\"assault with intent to commit sodomy\\" shall be punished as a court- martial may direct. That was modified on June 4, 1920, to make the act of sodomy itself a crime. The change went into effect on February 4, 1921. It was the first express prohibition of homosexuality or homosexual conduct in the armed forces of the United States. The several branches of the U.S. lacked a unified policy on service by homosexuals for most of their history. Before 1949, each tended to charge personnel caught engaging in homosexual conduct with sodomy, court-martial them, and issue them a dishonorable discharge. In 1940, psychiatrists Harry Stack Sullivan and Winfred Overholser formulated guidelines for psychiatric screening for military inductees. Both believed homosexuals should not be inducted, and neither proposed excluding all homosexuals from military service. Despite their recommendations, other psychiatrists and military officials made homosexuality a key component of the screening apparatus they recommended.Charles Kaiser, The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America (Houghton Mifflin, 1997), pp. ?? The United States Army Surgeon General's office issued a circular in 1941 that for the first time classified \\"homosexual proclivities\\" as disqualifying inductees from military service. The United States Navy and the Selective Service adopted similar exclusionary policies.B√©rub√©, 12 The Women's Army Corps adopted a similar policy in 1944.B√©rub√©, 32 The Women's Army Corps instituted harsh screening policies for recruits, often based on physical appearance and gender conformity, in order to exclude lesbians from service. WAC policies also condoned heterosexual relationships with servicemen in order to discourage homosexual conduct. With the mass mobilization and deployment of troops for operations in World War II, it became impractical to convene court- martial boards for homosexual conduct offenses. Commanders instead issued blue discharges ‚Äì a form of administrative military discharge ‚Äì to homosexual personnel. However, blue discharge holders faced difficulties in civilian life because the blue discharge carried with it a negative association. The Veterans Administration denied blue-discharge veterans the benefits of the G.I. Bill as a general policy.B√©rub√©, 230 In 1944, a policy directive ordered that homosexuals were to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists and discharged under Regulation 615-360, section 8.B√©rub√©, 142‚Äì3 For example, staff sergeant Allen Irvin Bernstein, who was arrested in January 1944 by military police after a failed pickup attempt with another soldier, was confined in a psychiatric ward at Camp Lee, Virginia, and discharged within a month. He subsequently appealed the discharge decision, attaching a copy of his 140-page defense of homosexuality, Millions of Queers (Our Homo America), which, however, was ignored and remained forgotten and unpublished until rediscovered in 2010 by a researcher in the National Library of Medicine. Denied all veterans benefits, Bernstein continued to refile appeals with the Army until, 37 years later, the Army accepted his appeal and retroactively converted his blue discharge to an honorable discharge in 1981. Blue discharges were discontinued in May 1947 and replaced with two new headings, \\"general\\" and \\"undesirable\\".B√©rub√©, 242 A general discharge was considered to be under honorable conditions though distinct from an \\"honorable discharge.\\" An undesirable discharge was under conditions other than honorable, yet distinct from a \\"dishonorable discharge\\".Jones, 2 The Army also changed its regulations to ensure that homosexuals would not qualify for general discharges.B√©rub√©, p. 243 Under this system, a servicemember found to be homosexual but who had not committed any homosexual acts while in service received an undesirable discharge. Those found guilty of engaging in homosexual conduct were dishonorably discharged. In 1945, four honorably discharged gay veterans formed the Veterans Benevolent Association, the first such organization.Archer, 110 It was primarily social in nature and its membership peaked at 100. The group disbanded in 1954,Katz, 635 and several of its members later formed the New York chapter of homophile advocacy group One, Inc.Humphreys, 51  Standard policy, 1949‚Äì1993  In October 1949, the newly consolidated Department of Defense standardized anti-homosexual regulations across all branches of the military: \\"Homosexual personnel, irrespective of sex, should not be permitted to serve in any branch of the Armed Forces in any capacity, and prompt separation of known homosexuals from the Armed Forces is mandatory.\\"B√©rub√©, p. 261 President Harry S. Truman signed legislation on May 6, 1950, creating the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which became effective on May 31, 1951. It established a single justice system for the armed forces. Its Article 125 forbids sodomy among all military personnel, defining an offender as \\"any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offence.\\" The success of the armed forces in pre-screening self-identified gay and bisexual people from the 1940s through 1981 remains in dispute; during the Vietnam War, some men pretended to be gay in order to avoid the draft. However, a significant number of gay and bisexual men and women did manage to pass through the screening process and serve in the military, some with special distinction. For example, in the 1950s, the Navy medical doctor Tom Dooley received national fame for his anti- Communist and humanitarian efforts in Vietnam. He was forced to resign in March 1956 when found to have participated in homosexual activities.Randy Shilts, Conduct Unbecoming: Gays & Lesbians in the U.S. Military Vietnam to the Persian Gulf (NY: St. Martin's Press, 1993), 25-6 The Navy conducted the first official study on sexual orientation and the Navy regulations and rules. In 1957, the Crittenden Report found that gay-identified people were no more likely to be a security risk than heterosexual-identified people, but nevertheless recommended that homosexuals be excluded from service because \\"Homosexuality is wrong, it is evil, and it is to be branded as such.\\"Jennifer Terry, An American Obsession: Science, Medicine, and Homosexuality in Modern Society (University of Chicago Press, 1999), 347 San Francisco politician and gay rights campaigner Harvey Milk served in the United States Navy during the Korean War. He served aboard the submarine rescue ship USS Kittiwake (ASR-13) as a diving officer, later transferring to Naval Station, San Diego to serve as a diving instructor. In 1955, he was discharged from the Navy at the rank of lieutenant, junior grade, though whether his homosexuality was an issue in his discharge is doubted by researchers.Milk said numerous times that he was dishonorably discharged and claimed it was because he was gay, but Randy Shilts was skeptical of this claim, stating: \\"The Harvey Milk of this era was no political activist, and according to available evidence, he played the more typical balancing act between discretion and his sex drive.\\" (p. 16) Scholar Karen Foss confirms his discharge from the Navy had no connection to his sexuality and states, \\"While exaggeration is a frequent campaign tactic, in Milk's case such embellishments served to demonstrate his willingness to be part of the political system while also maintain his distance from it.\\" (See Foss, Karen. \\"The Logic of Folly in the Political Campaigns of Harvey Milk\\", in Queer Words, Queer Images, Jeffrey Ringer, ed. (1994), New York University Press. , p. 21.) By the 1970s, a gay servicemember who had not committed any homosexual acts while in service generally received a general discharge, while those found to have engaged in homosexual conduct more often received undesirable discharges.Jones, p. 3 Gay servicemembers received a disproportionate percentage of undesirable discharges issued.Shilts, p. 163 During the 1970s, beginning with Leonard Matlovich, who was featured on the cover of Time magazine in 1975 (making him the first named openly gay person to appear on the cover of a U.S. newsmagazine), several high-profile court challenges to the military's regulations on homosexuality occurred, with little success, and when such successes did occur it was when the plaintiff had been open about his homosexuality from the beginning or due to the existence of the \\"queen for a day\\" rule, which stated that if a service-member was caught having sex with a person of the same gender they could avoid being discharged if the \\"member did not have a propensity of intent to engage in homosexual acts.\\"The \\"Queen For a Day Rule\\" stated that if a service-member was caught having sex with a person of the same gender they could avoid being discharged if the \\"member did not have a propensity of intent to engage in homosexual acts.\\" In 1981, the Department of Defense issued a new regulation on homosexuality that was designed to ensure withstanding a court challenge by developing uniform and clearly defined regulations and justifications that made homosexual status, whether self-applied or by the military, and conduct grounds for discharge (DOD Directive 1332.14 (Enlisted Administrative Separations), January 1981): :Homosexuality is incompatible with military service. The presence in the military environment of persons who engage in homosexual conduct or who, by their statements, demonstrate a propensity to engage in homosexual conduct, seriously impairs the accomplishment of the military mission. The presence of such members adversely affects the ability of the armed forces to maintain discipline, good order, and morale; to foster mutual trust and confidence among service members; to ensure the integrity of the system of rank and command; to facilitate assignment and worldwide deployment of service members who frequently must live and work in close conditions affording minimal privacy; to recruit and retain members of the armed forces; to maintain the public acceptability of military service; and to prevent breaches of security. The directive justified the policy and removed the \\"queen for a day\\" rule that had prompted some courts to rule against the armed forces. However, the intent of the policy had also been to treat homosexuality as being akin to a disability discharge and thus ensure that anyone found engaging in homosexual activity and/or identifying as gay, would be separated with an honorable discharge. The DOD policy has since withstood most court challenges, although the United States Supreme Court has refused to weigh in on the constitutionality of the policy, preferring to allow lower courts and the United States Congress to settle the matter. In the 1980s, many of the Democratic Party presidential candidates expressed an interest in changing the regulations concerning homosexuality in the armed forces, and, as American social mores changed, public opinion began to express more sympathy with gay people in armed forces, at least to the extent that investigations into a serviceman or -woman's sexual behaviour and/or orientation were seen as a witch-hunt. \\"Gays in the military\\" became a political issue during the 1992 Presidential campaign, when Clinton, the Democratic candidate, promised to lift the military's ban on homosexual and bisexual people. In 1992, the United States General Accounting Office published a report entitled Defense Force Management: DOD's Policy on Homosexuality, that outlined the DOD policy on homosexuality and the reasons for it. The report also included excerpts from a previously unpublished 1988 Defense Personnel Security Research and Education Center study on homosexuality that made similar conclusions as the 1957 Crittenden Report. Some LGBT military personnel sought to overturn the military's ban on service by homosexuals. Among the earliest were Leonard Matlovich, who fought to remain in the Air Force after coming out in 1975, and Perry Watkins, who was drafted in 1967 despite disclosing his homosexuality on his induction papers.Shilts, p. 63 District Court judge Gerhard Gesell ordered Matlovich's reinstatement in 1980.Shilts, p. 363 Rather than return Matlovich to duty, the Air Force offered him a cash settlement of $160,000, which Matlovich accepted.Shilts, p. 371 The Army tried to discharge Watkins several times, until the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ordered his reinstatement in 1989 and the United States Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The appellate court, however, did not rule the military policy unconstitutional in Watkins's case. Rather, it decided that simple equity mandated that the Army could not discharge Watkins for homosexuality when it knew of his sexual orientation all along. Other high-profile discharges included those of Vernon Berg, III, Keith Meinhold, and Tracy Thorne from the Navy; Joseph Steffan from the Naval Academy; Margarethe Cammermeyer from the Washington National Guard; and Miriam Ben-Shalom from the Army Reserve. At the height of the push to rescind the ban before DADT, Miriam Ben-Shalom joined with other discharged personnel to form the Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Veterans of America.  Don't ask, don't tell, 1993‚Äì2011  Image from a U.S. Army training manual, 2001, regarding homosexuality Don't ask, don't tell (DADT) is the common term for the policy restricting the United States military from efforts to discover or reveal closeted gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members or applicants, while barring those that are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from military service. Following the implementation of DADT, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network was formed to protect the rights of active duty personnel. Other organizations include Servicemembers United which formed in 2005 by veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and groups associated with West Point (Knights Out) and the Naval Academy (USNA Out). Service members discharged under DADT continued to seek redress through the courts without success. Courts often cited the Supreme Court's 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick, which upheld the constitutionality of state sodomy laws. After the Supreme Court reversed Bowers in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ruled that the Lawrence v. Texas decision applies to Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which banned all acts of sodomy. In both United States v. Stirewalt and United States v. Marcum, the court found Article 125 constitutional, but ruled that the \\"conduct falls within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court,\\"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: U.S. v. Stirewalt, September 29, 2004, accessed August 16, 2010 but also said that despite the application of Lawrence to the military, Article 125 could still be upheld in cases where there are \\"factors unique to the military environment\\" that would place the conduct \\"outside any protected liberty interest recognized in Lawrence\\",U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: U.S. v. Marcum, August 23, 2004, accessed August 16, 2010 such as fraternization, public sexual behavior, or anything that would adversely affect good order and discipline. Convictions for consensual sodomy have been overturned in military courts under the Lawrence in United States v. MenoUnited States v. Meno ARMY 20000733 and United States v. Bullock.SodomyLaws.org: US v. Bullock (2004), accessed August 16, 2010 In the course of reviewing the end of DADT, the Department of Defense's Comprehensive Review Working Group recommended repealing or amending Article 125 to eliminate any ban on consensual sodomy between adults.Department of Defense: \\"Report of the Comprehensive Review of the Issues Associated with a Repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell',\\" November 30, 2010, accessed January 30, 2012; comprehensive report Major legal challenges to the DADT policy include Witt v. Department of the Air Force and Log Cabin Republicans v. United States. The first ended in a negotiated settlement, but only after the lesbian plaintiff whom the Air Force tried to discharge won retirement with full benefits in 2011 as DADT neared its end. In the second, Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips ordered the military on October 12, 2010, to suspend and discontinue any investigation or discharge, separation, or other proceeding that began under DADT. A series of appeals and stays of her ordered followed in the fall of 2010 just as Congressional attempts to repeal DADT took shape. An attempt to repeal DADT began in May 2010 when the House approved an amendment to the 2011 National Defense Authorization Act. It failed in September, when Sen. John McCain led a successful filibuster against it. In December 2010, after a second Senate filibuster, Senators Joe Lieberman and Susan Collins introduced the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. It passed the House of Representatives on December 15. and the Senate on December 18 by a vote of 65-31. President Barack Obama signed the bill on December 22. On December 29, 2010, the Department of Justice asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to suspend proceedings in the Log Cabin case. Instead, on July 6, 2011, that court, citing progress made by military officials in preparing for an end to DADT, ordered the government to cease enforcement of DADT while dismantling the policy. Repeal was not immediate. The Department of Defense first reviewed its policies and guidelines and drafted implementation regulations. Then the President, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certified that new regulations had been drafted and that the new regulations would not damage military cohesion and readiness. That certification triggered a 60-day waiting period at the end of which, on September 20, 2011, DADT expired. = Service academies = A research report that appeared in the journal Armed Forces & Society at the end of 2011 said that military academy cadets opposed allowing homosexuals to serve openly in greater percentages than participants in ROTC did, and that both groups opposed such service to a greater degree than their civilian counterparts.Morten G. Ender, et al., \\"Civilian, ROTC, and Military Academy Undergraduate Attitudes toward Homosexuals in the U.S. Military: A Research Note,\\" Armed Forces & Society, January 2012, vol. 38, 164-172, abstract available online, accessed February 2, 2012 Some news outlets viewed this as a negative reaction to the repeal of DADT earlier in the year,Huffington Post: Max J. Rosenthal, \\"At Service Academies, Gay Cadets Find Official Support But Remain Guarded After DADT Repeal,\\" November 3, 2011, accessed January 31, 2012; U.S. News & World Report: Paul Bedard, \\"Half of New Officers Oppose Gays In Military,\\" December 27, 2011, accessed February 1, 2012 but the authors of the study said it drew on survey data collected between 2002 and 2007 and believed their research provided no information about opinions following the end of DADT. They wrote that the strong degree of anti-gay sentiment found among entering cadets declined somewhat during their time at the service academies: \\"Surprisingly, military culture appears to have made cadets more tolerant of gays and lesbians, not less.\\"Palm Center: \\"USA Today Mischaracterizes Military Attitudes about DADT Repeal,\\" December 28, 2011, accessed February 1, 2012  After DADT  Barack Obama signing the repeal of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell', a policy that forbade gay and lesbian people from openly serving in the United States armed forces. = Benefits = Despite the end of DADT on September 20, 2011, the same-sex spouses of gay and lesbian service members were not treated on a par with the different-sex spouses of military service members because of restrictions imposed by Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and certain federal statutes that contain definitions of marriage that exclude same-sex couples. Same-sex spouses are denied death benefits, identification cards, base access, access to repatriation ceremonies, and other entitlements. In December 2012, the Association of Bragg Officers Spouses (ABOS) denied membership to Ashley Broadway, the female spouse of a female Army officer. During the weeks of press coverage that ensued, Fort Bragg's commander said he lacked authority over the private organization while the U.S. Marines announced that clubs conducting business on base must admit same-sex spouses. ABOS offered Broadway a \\"special guest membership\\", which she declined. On January 26, Military Spouse magazine named Broadway Fort Bragg's 2013 \\"Military Spouse of the Year\\". That same day, ABOS invited Broadway to join and announced that its membership was open to \\"any Spouse of an active duty commissioned or warrant Officer with a valid marriage certificate from any state or district in the United States\\". On February 11, 2013, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced the Department's extension of certain military \\"additional benefits\\" to same-sex spouses which are not explicitly prohibited under the Defense of Marriage Act, in addition to \\"member-designated benefits\\" which were already available to same-sex spouses. In June 2013, the Pentagon announced plans to begin issuing identification cards to the same-sex partners of servicemembers, which will allow them to access education, survivor, commissary, travel, counseling and transportation benefits, but not health care and housing allowances. = Discharge pay = The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) brought suit in 2010 on behalf of servicemembers discharged for homosexuality who received only half the standard separation pay upon discharge. All were discharged under the DADT policy, but the ACLU said that the practice ante- dated the adoption of DADT.New York Times: James Dao, \\"Discharged Gay Service Members Sue Over 'Half-Pay' Policy,\\" September 22, 2011, accessed February 14, 2012 On January 7, 2013, the ACLU reached a settlement with the federal government in Collins v. United States that provided for the payment of full separation pay to servicemembers discharged under \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" since November 10, 2004. Some 181 were expected to receive about $13,000 each. = Veterans associations = The American Military Partner Association (AMPA) was formed in 2009 to enable the LGBT partners of servicemembers and veterans to provide support in areas where the military fails to and to advocate on behalf of equal treatment of those in same-sex relationships. = Less than honorable discharges = Following the end of DADT, approximately 114,000 servicemembers who had been separated from military service since WW II under the categories \\"other than honorable discharge\\", \\"general discharge\\", or \\"dishonorable discharge\\" became eligible to have their discharges amended. Those without an honorable discharge are often excluded from veterans benefits like health care and tuition assistance, and the lack of an honorable discharge can create a hurdle to employment in the civilian sector as well. The Armed Forces established procedures for processing such requests through the Military Department Board for Correction of Military/Naval Records or the Military Department's Discharge Review Board. In June 2013, after advocates for gay and lesbian veterans complained about the process, Representatives Mark Pocan (D-Wisconsin) and Charles Rangel (D-New York) introduced the Restore Honor to Service Members Act in the House of Representatives to codify the process and reduce inconsistencies. Pocan said the legislation represented the same policies as those currently in place, but was needed because \\"without having it in law, it could change at some date in the future with a different administration.\\" The American Bar Association endorsed the legislation on November 21, 2013. On January 30, 2014, Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) introduced the same legislation in the Senate.  After Windsor  On June 26, 2013, the Supreme Court held in United States v. Windsor that the statute under which the U.S. military was withholding benefits from servicemembers in same-sex marriages, Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, was unconstitutional. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel stated: \\"The Department of Defense welcomes the Supreme Court's decision [and] will immediately begin the process of implementing the Supreme Court's decision in consultation with the Department of Justice and other executive branch agencies. The Department of Defense intends to make the same benefits available to all military spouses‚Äîregardless of sexual orientation‚Äîas soon as possible.\\" On August 14, 2013, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced that it would provide spousal and family benefits to servicemembers in same-sex marriages on the same terms as it does to those in different-sex marriages. The benefits, which include health care coverage, housing allowances, military ID cards, and survivor benefits, can be claimed retroactive to June 26, the day of the Windsor decision. A same-sex marriage must be documented by a marriage certificate that establishes that the marriage was valid where it was celebrated. The DoD also announced that servicemembers who need to travel to a jurisdiction that allows them to marry will be afforded up to 7 days leave to do so, up to 10 days if they are stationed outside the U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said: \\"This will provide accelerated access to the full range of benefits offered to married military couples throughout the department, and help level the playing field between opposite-sex and same-sex couples seeking to be married\\". The DoD set September 3 as its target date for implementation. the servicemember's commander determines the amount of leave to be granted based on the servicemember's unit responsibilities and specific situation. Peter Sprigg of the Family Research Council, a longtime opponent of the end of \\"don't ask, don't tell\\", wrote that \\"It could well be argued that the new policy actively discriminates against opposite-sex couples, who receive no special leave for their weddings\\". DoD officials said the leave was for travel and cited Texas or South Korea as locations that pose problems for same-sex couples seeking to marry. The policy does not apply to those in same-sex legal relationships other than marriage, such as civil unions and domestic partnerships. The Veterans Administration has cited other federal statutes that define \\"spouse\\" and 'surviving spouse' The status of benefits for veterans in same-sex relationships was the subject of ongoing lawsuits. = Discrimination = In 2015, Defense Secretary Ash Carter added sexual orientation to the list of nondiscrimination protections under the military's equal opportunity program. However, LGBT service members and veterans continue to face discrimination in the Veterans Health Administration. Often healthcare systems deny them adequate services and visitation rights to same-sex couples.Sharpe, V. A., & Uchendu, U. S. (2014). Ensuring Appropriate Care for LGBT Veterans in the Veterans Health Administration. Hastings Center Report, 44S53-S55. doi:10.1002/hast.372 HIV-positive service members overseas frequently had their possessions thrown overboard when their fellow comrades found out they tested positive.Ramirez, M. H., & Sterzing, P. R. (2017). Coming out in camouflage: A queer theory perspective on the strength, resilience, and resistance of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender service members and veterans. Journal Of Gay & Lesbian Social Services, 29(1), 68-86. doi:10.1080/10538720.2016.1263983 = Lawsuits and veterans benefits = Several lawsuits on behalf of same-sex military spouses had challenged the constitutionality of DOMA and statutes that define \\"spouse\\" and \\"surviving spouse\\" as \\"a person of the opposite sex\\" when determining eligibility for veterans benefits. On October 27, 2011, the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network (SLDN) had brought suit in federal court in Massachusetts on behalf of several military servicemembers and veterans in same-sex marriages. The benefits at issue in that case, McLaughlin v. Panetta, included medical and dental benefits, basic housing and transportation allowances, family separation benefits, visitation rights in military hospitals, and survivor benefit plans. On June 27, the federal judge hearing the case asked the parties to explain by July 18 why the logic that found Windsor unconstitutional did not apply to that definition as well. On July 18, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group BLAG, which had defended DOMA and the restrictive definitions of marriage acknowledged that \\"[t]he Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3's constitutionality\\" but took no position on the other statutes except to say that the constitutionality of those definitions \\"remains open\\". The Department of Justice told the court that it would not defend those statutes. BLAG asked to withdraw from a similar lawsuit in federal court in California, Cooper-Harris v. United States, on July 22.Application to Withdraw, accessed July 23, 2013 On August 29, Judge Consuelo Marshall ruled that the provisions of Title 38 of the U.S. Code that define spouse so as to exclude those in same-sex marriages are unconstitutional. A similar case involving only veterans benefits, Cardona v. Shinseki, is awaiting resolution in the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, after being suspended while awaiting the resolution of Windsor. On July 19, 2013, Veterans Administration (VA) Secretary Eric Shinseki noted in a letter about the case that the statutory definitions of \\"spouse\\" and \\"surviving spouse\\" had yet to be invalidated by a court. The VA is waiting for guidance from the Justice Department on how Windsor applies to those statutes. Even if that statutory limitation is invalidated, the VA's rules for establishing the validity of a marriage may restrict benefits to same-sex married couples residing in a jurisdiction that recognizes their marriage or who resided in the jurisdiction where they married. The Respect for Marriage Act sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Jerrold Nadler eliminates the question of residence by establishing a rule for federal purposes that a marriage is valid if it was valid where celebrated. They reintroduced the legislation the day Windsor was decided. On September 4, Attorney General Eric Holder, as required by law, notified Speaker of the House John Boehner that the Obama administration had determined that it should not enforce the federal statutes that define spouse in a way that excludes same-sex spouses. He cited Windsor and the decision in Cooper-Harris the previous week as well as BLAG's withdrawal from litigation challenging the statutes in question. Advocates for same-sex spouses of veterans welcomed the announcement, but noted that the question of the rights of such spouses remained uncertain if they live in states that do not recognize their marriage. On September 13, 2013, VA home loan benefits were extended to include service members in same-sex marriages. In June 2014, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced that it would only provide benefits to the same-sex spouses of veterans who either (1) married in the state in which they resided or (2) live in a state that recognizes their marriage when they apply for benefits. On August 18, the American Military Partner Association filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit challenging the VA's interpretation of federal law. Their brief cited Windsor and many federal court decisions since Windsor that have held denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples unconstitutional. It said the VA's policy ruling \\"imports into federal law unconstitutional state definitions of marital status.\\"AMPA v. MacDonald, Petition for Review, August 18, 2014, accessed August 22, 2014 = National Guard = In several states that do not recognize same-sex marriages‚Äìnotably Oklahoma, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas‚ÄìNational Guard officials initially refused to comply with Department of Defense directives to allow the same-sex spouses National Guard members in their states to enroll in federal benefit programs, instead requiring such members to travel to federal facilities to do so. Guard officials in Oklahoma enrolled some same-sex couples until September 5, 2013, when Governor Mary Fallin ordered an end to the practice. Defense Secretary Hagel on October 31 said he would insist on compliance. On November 6, Fallin announced that Oklahoma guard members could have benefits requests for same- sex spouses processed at federal facilities. On November 20, after DoD officials objected to that plan, Fallin ordered that all married couples would be required to have benefits requests processed at those facilities. On November 26, Texas agreed to conform with DoD policy stating that state workers would be considered federal workers while enrolling same-sex couples for benefits. Louisiana adopted a policy like that of Texas on December 3, as did Georgia. and Mississippi the same week. On December 12, Secretary of Defense Hagel announced that all state national guard units were in compliance, though three of them‚ÄìOklahoma, Florida and South Carolina‚Äìallowed all guard members to apply for ID cards and benefits only at federal facilities. Some other states chose to place their state employees on federal status for the sake of processing such applications. = Sodomy = The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 enacted in December 2013 repealed the ban on consensual sodomy found in Article 125 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  Healthcare needs and provisions  In 2014, the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is providing healthcare services for approximately one million gay and lesbian veterans. With the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, more gay and lesbian veterans will be seeking medical care. However, as noted by Sherman and her coauthors, there are many concerns regarding the healthcare needs of the gay and lesbian veterans, and many veterans do not feel that they have adequate and equitable healthcare services from the VHA. The researchers assert that veterans who are missing quality healthcare are less likely to maintain good health and positive well- being.  Concerns from gay and lesbian veterans  In their article, Sherman and her coauthors explain that in the past, most of the gay and lesbian veterans were uncomfortable in disclosing their sexual orientations or identities because they were afraid that this information could lead to their discharge from the military. With the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, gays and lesbians are assured that their sexual orientations will not be used against them. Nonetheless, because of their previous experiences in the military, many gay and lesbian veterans are still worried that this information may jeopardize their future careers and prospects. Because of societal stereotypes and stigmas, they are also worried that they may be denied medical service, lose their benefits, or receive inferior services. Sherman and her coauthors conducted a study on the communications between the gay and lesbian veterans with their VHA providers and the experiences regarding their healthcare services. Most of them report dissatisfaction with their medical treatment. Many veterans state that they do not receive the necessary support from VHA medical providers. Moreover, they claim that their healthcare providers are not receptive to their medical needs, and they have never been asked about their sexual orientation. Most of the veterans report that they do not feel at ease with their healthcare providers. The results of the study also show that some gay and lesbian veterans are disinclined to seek medical treatment from the VHA, and some of them are having trouble in finding equitable healthcare services. Based on the study, there are some inherent problems in the healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans. Similarly, another 2011 report states that lesbians often decline routine medical tests. Gay men are not as likely to seek medical treatment when compared with heterosexual men. Hence, some medical conditions and disorders may not be treated in a timely manner. However, Sherman and her co-authors point out that the missing patient-centered communication can affect the quality of medical treatment. Sexual orientation and identity can have implications for the physical and mental health of the patient. According to the authors, since sexual identity and orientation is a contentious issue, many healthcare workers are not comfortable in approaching this topic. But if the physicians initiate the conversation, it is more likely that the veterans will provide this information. Based on their data, if the gay and lesbian veterans can divulge information about their personal medical history, values, and preferences, they may experience higher levels of patient satisfaction. It is also more likely for them to receive appropriate preventive care and diagnostic screenings for their unique health risks, such as sexually transmitted diseases. Moreover, comprehensive medical records can provide a multitude of information useful not only for medical treatments but also for evaluations, such as the fitness of the veterans for duty.  Response from Veterans' Health Administration  To alleviate the concerns from the gay and lesbian veterans about discrimination and to address healthcare disparities, in 2013, the VHA has introduced some policy changes. For instance, the VHA has established the Office of Health Equity to oversee the gay and lesbian healthcare needs and to reduce the inequities in their healthcare provisions. These new developments mark a milestone in expanding the role of the government in improving healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans. The VHA is instituting policies that focus on individualized care. They require healthcare providers to care for gay and lesbian patients in the same respectful and sensitive manner as other patients. Another policy is to redefine the meaning of \\"family\\" and allow the gay and lesbian veterans to decide who is regarded as part of their family. As of 2014, there are many discrepancies regarding this information. The information found on medical records is often inaccurate and may not clearly indicate the choice of the veterans. The VHA has also launched educational and training programs so that healthcare providers will have a better understanding of the psychological and social distresses of the gay and lesbian veterans. Since the gay and lesbian veterans are not asked to disclose information about their sexual orientation on medical forms, the healthcare providers are often unaware of this information when they consider medical treatment options. In response to these concerns, the Institute of Medicine suggested that patients disclose such information on medical records. The information will be confidential and only used to assess health. The VHA is striving to prevent this information from being shared with other organizations. Sharpe and Uchendu suggest the option of incorporating open-ended questions to encourage the veterans to supply additional written information. Healthcare services for gay and lesbian veterans are not adequate. The main purpose of the first steps of the VHA is to create a cordial culture and a welcoming environment for the gay and lesbian veterans. Fostering a better relationship among the healthcare providers and the patients and encouraging the patients to provide more personal information can improve healthcare outcomes for the gay and lesbian veterans.

Champagne dial, ‚åÄ 35mm, small seconds. The Seamaster is the longest running product line still produced by Omega. It was introduced in 1948, and was loosely based upon designs made for the British Royal Navy towards the end of World War II. The original Seamaster's key feature was an O-ring gasket used to provide its waterproof seal. This design had been developed for use in submarines during the war, and turned out to also be useful for watches, where it made them much less vulnerable to temperature and pressure changes than earlier (lead or shellac) based gasket designs. The Omega Seamaster first made a diving record in 1955, when diver Gordon McLean reached a depth of 62.5 meters (205 ft) in Australia.  James Bond  Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean 600m/2000ft diving watch Omega Seamaster 120M Analog-Digital \\"Multifunction\\" was introduced in 1998 and discontinued after few years, Fitted with Omega Cal.1665 Omega has been associated with James Bond movies since 1995. That year, Pierce Brosnan took over the role of James Bond and wore the Omega Seamaster Professional Diver 300M Quartz in the movie GoldenEye. In all later films, Brosnan wore an Omega Seamaster Professional Diver 300M Chronometer (model 2531.80.00). In most of Brosnan's 007 films, the helium release valve is transformed into improbable hidden gadgets such as a laser cutter (GoldenEye and Die Another Day) or a remote detonator (Tomorrow Never Dies and Die Another Day). Before 1995, actors portraying James Bond had usually worn the Rolex Submariner (Reference 6538), albeit for a brief period where actor Roger Moore wore a quartz watch in the late 1970s. The Bond film producers wanted to update the image of the fictional \\"super-spy\\" to a more distinctly sophisticated \\"Euro\\" look.\\"James Bond's Choice: The Omega Seamaster \\", commanderbond.net, 2004-03-29 (retrieved on 2007-02-21). The main reason for the switch to the Omega Diver 300M for the Bond franchise is because of Lindy Hemming, a British woman, in charge of costume/wardrobe for the new movies. At the time she thought the Seamaster looked the part of a rogue special operative who also needed the ability to dress up. She recognized the history of Omega Seamasters in the British military (notably the Special Boat Service, synonymous with the character of Bond) which furthered her decision.

For the 40th anniversary of James Bond (2002), a commemorative edition of the Diver 300M chronometer was made available, model 2537.80.00 (10,007 units). The watch is identical to the model 2531.80.00 except the blue watch dial had a 007 logo inscribed across it and also machined into the case-back. The band also had 007 inscribed on the clasp.Lara Magzan, \\"The business of Bond...James Bond\\", CNN/Money, 2002-11-25 (retrieved on 2007-02-21). Daniel Craig, who played Bond from Casino Royale to No Time to Die, also wears the Omega Seamaster: the Seamaster Planet Ocean and Seamaster Diver 300M in Casino Royale, and even goes so far as to mention Omega by name in the film when questioned by Vesper Lynd. In connection with the launch of the film, Omega released a 007-special of the Professional 300M, featuring the 007-gun logo on the second hand and the rifle pattern on the watch face, this being a stylized representation of the gun barrel sequence of Bond movies.Devin Zydel, \\"Omega Presents James Bond Exhibition in Geneva \\", Commanderbond.net 2007-01-06 (retrieved on 2007-02-21). Omega released a second James Bond limited edition watch in 2006. This was a Seamaster Planet Ocean model with a limited production of 5007 units. The model is similar to what Craig wears earlier on in the film; however, it has a small orange- colored 007 logo on the second hand, an engraved case-back signifying the Bond connection, and an engraved 007 on the clasp.Devin Zydel, \\"Omega Casino Royale Limited Series Planet Ocean Watch Announced \\", commanderbond.net 2006-11-05 (retrieved on 2007-02-21). In Quantum of Solace, Craig wears the Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean with a black face and steel bracelet (42 mm version). Another limited edition was released featuring the checkered \\"PPK grip\\" face with the Quantum of Solace logo over it. The Seamaster Professional Diver 300M was worn by James Bond in six movies, the Planet Ocean and Aqua Terra in three, in addition to sporting a limited edition Omega Seamaster 300 (not to be confused with the Professional Diver 300M) Master Co-Axial in Spectre. The Seamaster Professional Diver 300M that appears from GoldenEye to Casino Royale is made of stainless steel on a stainless steel bracelet, fitted with a blue dial, unidirectional rotating bezel with blue ring and a sapphire crystal. After its absence in three films, the Diver 300M returns in No Time to Die in the form of a new model, this time with a black dial, a titanium case, powered by Omega's Co-Axial Master Chronometer 8806 and is the first in the line of Seamasters to have a Milanese mesh strap and not to feature a date window.

The Swiss Lever escapement has been the standard in horology for hundreds of years. The escapement provides the release of energy from the mainspring to the going train that further controls the function of the moving parts that measure time and other complications. The Swiss lever, although the mainstay in the industry, has the capability to be strong on energy conservation but needs considerable lubrication between the impulse pallet and the escape wheel teeth due to sliding friction. This causes considerable wear on the lubrication over time and may cause wear on the pallet or escape wheel. Because of this, regular service (4‚Äì5 years) is recommended to clean, lubricate, and possibly replace parts. With the co-axial escapement, the impulse is done with a push to the jewels rather than a sliding fashion. In this design the work is divided between two major wheels of the escapement. Daniels brought his desire to industrialize his escapement to many Swiss manufacturers and he was ultimately denied. Omega in 1999 took on Daniels design with the insight of Nicolas Hayek who saw Omega as a brand of innovation and creativity who would rise to the top of the Swiss horological spectrum with the production of the co-axial escapement. He was right and Omega is one of the largest Swiss manufacturers and the second largest producer of COSC Officially Certified Chronometers, next to Rolex with Breitling being third, with every one of their movements COSC chronometers. The first co-axial movement to be brought to the public was the Omega cal. 2500, with different variations being listed as A, B, C, and D. This movement was built from the Omega \\"in-family\\" cal. 1120 (finished chronometer grade ETA 2892-A with two extra jewels) A, B, and C are similar two tier co-axial movements, but C is the first version to solve certain problems prevalent in A and B. For example, the vibrations per hour were originally 28,800 (standard for most Swiss watches with Swiss Lever Escapements) but later lowered to 25,200 (7 vs 8 v beats a second). This change was noted that it was the optimal working vibration of the movement and may contribute to lower service intervals. The Co-axial D variation was made to allow for an even more efficient 3 tier escapement. This development of technology helped the company innovate the 8400 (no date)/8500(w/date complication)/9300 (chronograph) three tier in-house movements. The co-axial D variation is still made specifically for the Omega Diver 300m co-axial. The Diver 300m, a watch produced since 1993 has a certain shape and size that is characteristic of this watch, the 2500 is slender enough to keep the case shape and size proportionate on the Diver 300m (also known as the SMP). Master Co-Axial/ Master Chronometer The next generation of watchmaking focuses on anti-magnetic movements. According to studies by the COSC, the majority of watches in for service from 4+ years are primarily suffering accuracy issues due to magnetized movements. Many Swiss watch institutions have made additional efforts to alleviate the problem of magnetization. Some of the technology and practices include iron cages around the movement, silicon hairspring (Omega) (spring in the balance wheel of the escapement), Parachrom hairspring (Rolex), induction of plastic parts, and using non- magnetic metals. Only until recently has any watch maker made a fully anti- magnetic movement. The first watch able to resist magnetic fields up to 15,000 gauss was the Omega Aqua Terra Gauss. The first full anti-magnetic movement and Master Chronometer certified by the COSC is the Omega Constellation \\"Pie- Pan\\" Globemaster. This movement is capable of having a see-through case-back (the cal. 8800 in the new Seamaster 300 M) characterized by a movement with fully anti-magnetic parts. This is the beginning of a new generation of watch movements, re-institutionalizing the mechanical movement that once was deemed obsolete by the quartz movement of the 1970s to the present day. In 2018, the 70th anniversary of the Seamaster, and the 25th anniversary of the Seamaster Diver 300 M, Omega released a new version of the Diver 300 M (also known as Seamaster Professional). It features a Zirconium dioxide bezel as well as a Zirconium dioxide watch face with laser engraved waves, paying tribute to the very first Seamaster Professional models. The watch is continued to be loved by collectors and enthusiasts as a \\"modern classic\\" with an outermost \\"go anywhere\\" attitude and elegance of a dress watch.

Biography  Berthon's father, Ren√© Th√©odore Berthon, was a court painter to Napoleon I, and likely trained his son in art. As well, his knowledge of art in Paris would have been significant: his father was a student of Jacques Louis David. As an adult he lived in England for a number of years in the household of Sir Robert Peel to teach Peel\`s daughters drawing and French. The first verifiable record of his immigration to Canada is an advertisement for his portraiture services in a Toronto newspaper in 1845. Berthon was notable in the history of Canada for his creation of formal portraits characterized by a sense of realism. He focused on defining his subjects' features and characters without idealization. The composition of his portraits remains simple with dark backgrounds. His work is important both as a historical record and as an example of the style of Canadian portraiture during that period. He was nominated as a founding member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts but failed to qualify. He was elected a life member of the Ontario Society of Artists in 1891.

Flannagan, c. 1930. Photo by Knox Hall Montgomery, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Forbes Watson Papers. John Bernard Flannagan (April 7, 1895 ‚Äì January 6, 1942) was an American sculptor. Along with Robert Laurent and William Zorach, he is known as one of the first practitioners of direct carving (also known as taille directe) in the United States. Early years Female Nude by John B. Flannagan Flannagan was born in Fargo, North Dakota, on April 7, 1895. His father died when he was only five years old, and his mother, unable to support her family, placed him in an orphanage. \\"Unrelenting poverty . . . was to plague him for the rest of his life.\\"Craven, Wayne, Sculpture in America (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co., 1968), p. 580. He also suffered from severe depression and alcoholism, which ultimately led to his suicide. Education Maverick Horse by John B. Flannagan In his youth, Flannagan was recognized as possessing artistic talents, and in 1914 he attended the Minneapolis School of Art, now the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, where he studied painting. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Flannagan quit school and joined the Merchant Marines. He remained a merchant marine until 1922.Craven, Wayne, p. 580. After his return to civilian life, he was hired by painter Arthur B. Davies to work on Davies' farm in New York State. There Davis encouraged the young man to return to painting, which he did, also taking up wood carving. A year later, in 1922, Flannagan appeared in his first exhibition, along with Davies, Walt Kuhn, Charles Sheeler, William Glackens, and Charles and Maurice Prendergast.Armstrong, Craven, et al., 200 Years of American Sculpture (New York: Whitney Museum of Art, 1976), p. 271. In 1927 Flannagan gave up painting and wood carving to concentrate on stone carving. In 1928 he produced some of the first American direct carved stone sculptures of note, one of which is entitled \\"Pelican.\\" Mature years The years between 1930 and 1933 found Flannagan, now married, in Ireland. There he mastered the technique of carving stones that he scavenged from the Irish countryside into sculptures, typically small animals. He felt that \\"there exists an image within every rock.\\"Curtis, Penelope, Sculpture 1900-1945: After Rodin (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 85. His \\"aim [was] to produce a sculpture that hardly feels carved, but rather to have always been that way.\\"Curtis, p. 89. Back in the United States by 1934, Flannagan found work with the PWAP, the Depression-era government program that sponsored American artists. He received this position, his only means of support at the time, through the influence of Juliana Force, the first director of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Force and Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney had been longtime supporters of the sculptor, recognizing that he was a profoundly troubled man but also an exceptionally talented artist.Berman, Avis, Rebels on Eighth Street: Juliana Force and the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York: Atheneum, 1990), p. 221. Flannagan's time with the PWAP did not go smoothly. \\"The artist's alcoholism was always problematic: he alternated marathon work sessions with drinking bouts. Indeed, Flannagan had put in ninety hours one week and then took the next two weeks off, as was his custom. He worked until he was utterly exhausted and then drank to blot out the fatigue.\\"Berman, p. 348. He lost his job with the PWAP. His ensuing mental breakdown and seven months' incarceration in a mental institution, followed by a divorce, did not lessen Flannagan's resolve to produce as much quality sculpture as possible, but, in 1939, after being struck by a car and sustaining a severe closed head injury, it became increasingly difficult for him to function.Craven p. 583. Last years Destitute, depressed and suffering from ill health, Flannagan committed suicide on January 6, 1942.\\"John Bernard Flannagan\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved May 23, 2015. Critical reputation Even posthumously, Flannagan has not always received the critical attention that other sculptors of his time of equivalent talent have enjoyed. Art historian Sam Hunter provided one judgement in his survey of modern American art: Hunter compared Flannagan's sensibility to \\"the visionary, romantic art of Albert Pinkham Ryder and Morris Graves,\\" adding that \\"the microscopic sensibilities of such American poets as Emily Dickinson and Marianne Moore support and confirm the native authenticity of Flannagan's touching, creatural realism.\\"Hunter, p. 166.

During his leadership CAO‚Äôs net asset worth increased from US$176,000 to US$150,000,000, an increase of 85,200%. The market cap rose to 1.1 billion US dollars, which was 5,022 times the original value. Due to these incredible accomplishments, Chen Jiulin became a business legend and was named \\"The King of Aviation Oil \\". In 2004 CAO suffered huge losses due to oil future trading. Chen Jiulin was forced to leave the company and was arrested by the Singapore police. In March 2006, the Singapore court sentenced Chen Jiulin to four years and three months imprisonment. Chen Jiulin served 1035 days in Singapore prison and was released on January 20, 2009 on bail. Early life Chen Jiulin was born in Baolong Village of Xishui County, Huanggang City, Hubei Province. His birthplace was so remote that even after obtaining high fame, he had from time to time ask for directions when driving back home from Wuhan. During his childhood he showed a strong entrepreneurial spirit and self- confidence amongst the other rural children and he realized that knowledge is the key to the future. He was eager to learn and was adored by his teachers, with whom he still maintains good relationships. In October 1981 he resigned from a bank where he had built up a stable life, in order to concentrate on the preparations for the college entrance exams and he was admitted to Peking University in 1982. In the Oriental Studies Department he attended Vietnamese classes, but learned English at the same time. After that he successfully obtained a master's degree in Private International Law from China University of Political Science and Law, a master's degree in Business Management from The National University of Singapore and a PhD in Civil and Commercial Law from Tsinghua University. Career After graduating from Peking University, Chen Jiulin was employed by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, where he served as a translator and gained experience in the aviation business. After a reform the organization was divided in five parts and Chen Jiulin was assigned to work with Air China and in 1990 joined a Sino-German joint venture named Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Co. Ltd. Beijing where he worked as an assistant to foreign experts. In 1993 he joined China Aviation Oil Supply Corporation and participated in the construction and negotiations of Hong Kong‚Äôs new airport. After that he worked as the Chinese chief negotiator for South China Bluesky Aviation Oil Co., Ltd., Tianjin International Petroleum Storage and Transportation Co., Ltd., and other large project. All of them are the large Sino and foreign Joint Venture projects. CAO‚Äôs predecessor ‚Äì China Aviation Oil Transport (Singapore) Private Ltd., was also built up by Chen Jiulin. During the Asian financial crisis in 1997, CAO‚Äôs parent seconded Chen Jiulin to take over the helm of CAO in Singapore ‚Äì CAO (Singapore) Ltd., where he served as Managing Director, and CEO. CAO was established in 1993 and after suffering from losses during the first two years, it remained dormant for another two years. When Chen Jiulin took control over the company, he only had US$219,000 and the company was quickly falling into red numbers at the end of 1997. In order to turn it around, Chen Jiulin gradually monopolized the imported aviation oil market in China, increasing the company‚Äôs purchasing and transportation power by taking the measures of participating in the tendering of China imported jet fuel, followed by bulk purchasing, centralized transportation and other methods. Besides the significant improvements at CAO under Chen Jiulin‚Äôs leadership, the company also planned and led a series of Mergers & Acquisitions. Through these actions Chen Jiulin has set up a good example for Chinese enterprises that have the intention to venture overseas. When Shanghai Pudong airport opened its doors in 2002, its future was still unknown. Chen Jiulin purchased a 33% stake in the Aviation Fuel Supply Company of Shanghai Pudong International Airport on July 23, 2002, for a consideration of RMB370 million. This company made the profit of RMB 600 million in the second year and maintained such profit every year up to now . The return on investment to this company is still the main source of profit for CAO. On July 31, 2002 CAO acquired a stake of 5% in CLH (Spain) for 100 million Singapore Dollars. As of January 24, 2007, after the divestment of this equity, CAO gained a total of 400 million Singapore Dollars in addition to sharing profit from 3 million to 10 million per year. In 2001, CAO negotiated with Keppel Corporation, the largest shareholder of Singapore Petroleum Company (SPC), to purchase SPC. But at that time, CAO was not strong enough to purchase SPC alone and therefore they asked two Chinese corporations to act in concert. Unfortunately, the neither of the Chinese companies cooperated and CAO had to purchase SPC alone, but the two Chinese corporations acted unfavorably, which finally led to a failed transaction when CAO had the chance to buy 77% of the stocks of SPC for S$1 per share. On August 18, 2004, CAO announced that they had successfully bought 88 million shares of SPC (20.6% of the total equity) for S$4.12 per share, but during a shareholder‚Äôs meeting this acquisition was vetoed by CAO‚Äôs parent company. CAO even had to pay 30 million U.S. Dollars to an Indonesian business as compensation to cancellation of the contract. On 25 June 2009, PetroChina bought over SPC at the price of S$ 6.25 per share. According to press release at that time, CAO as a China state-controlled company could have saved approximately 10.1 billion RMB for China if CAO‚Äôs first acquisition mentioned above was successful. Under the leadership of Chen Jiulin, CAO changed from a pure oil trading business to an investment company that combines industrial, engineering, and energy trading businesses. On December 6, 2001, CAO was successfully listed on the Singapore stock exchange. In September 2004 the net asset was worth more than 150 million US Dollars, which was 852 times more than the original worth, and their market cap exceeded 1.1 billion US Dollars, which was 5022 times the initial investment from China. CAO also has an excellent track record and received numerous honors, including being twice Singapore‚Äôs \\"most transparent\\" listed company. The development of CAO was summarized and applied as a case study for the MBA education of the National University of Singapore. It was also regarded as a successful case of a Chinese state corporation by \\"Qiu Shi\\" magazine, a core magazine of the Chinese Communist Party. In 2003, Chen Jiulin was selected as the \\"New Asian Leader\\" by the World Economic Forum (which is renamed \\"Young Global Leader\\" now) and in the same year he received the title of the \\"Distinguished Alumni of Peking University\\". But in the first quarter of 2004, the Company made losses trading options. Then in October 2004, in an attempt to turn the tide, CAOHC, CAO‚Äôs parent, which owned 75% of the stocks of CAO, decided to sell 15% of their stocks, to raise 111 million US Dollars to satisfy the demand for margin calls ( The action of selling the vendor‚Äôs shares was later blamed on the parent company by media and accused of concealing a public investment deficit and \\"insider‚Äôs trading\\", but this also led to the imprisonment of Chen Jiulin, since he was sentenced for four years.) However, the international oil prices kept rising and losses expanded. On October 26, 2004, because of the awful pressure from Merm (Mutsui Energy Risk Management) CAOHC ordered CAO to begin closing its options positions when the oil market price was US$55.65, the highest price of the year. At the end of November, the international oil prices fell to $46.00/barrel and the average oil price was US$43/barrel for the month of December 2004. The average price of CAO‚Äôs total options position was US$48/barrel. CAO should have the opportunity to gain by hedging when the market price fell below US$48/barrel. Unfortunately by that time all the options were already closed due to the pressures from the counterparties of CAO and the decision to cut loss made by CAOHC, the parent company of CAO. One of the major reasons for CAO‚Äôs loss was due to a shortage in capital, which CAOHC once firmly promised to support CAO but some management changed the decision at the last minute. An internationally renowned agency commented that CAO could have made profit from its options position if someone supported it for only 50 million U.S. Dollars. When CAO incident leaked out, it drew the international media‚Äôs attention. In Singapore this incident was considered the most serious financial event since the bankruptcy of Barings Bank in 1994 and once again the market debated whether the Singapore financial control authorities had a dereliction of duty. In China this incident once again exposed the management problems of Chinese state corporations. On June 7, 2005 five CAO executives, including Chen Jiulin, were charged. A few days later, Chen Jiulin was bailed out by raising 2 million Singapore Dollars (about 1.2 million U.S. Dollars) . On March 21, 2006, the subordinate court of Singapore sentenced Chen Jiulin to four years and three months imprisonment and fined him for 335,000 Singapore Dollars. Several Chinese and international business magazines and other media wrote that Chen Jiulin was an \\"abandoned soldier\\", which is a terminology in the Chinese chess and has the meaning of scapegoat. Some people believe that there must be many unknown inside facts about the CAO incident. On June 22, 2010, insiders from China Gezhouba International Engineering Co., Ltd. (Gezhouba International) said that Chen Jiulin will be assigned as the vice president of Gezhouba International. The Gezhouba International official website has add Chen Jiulin into its management team introduction. However, the public query the qualification of Chen's serving as the vice president of a state-owned enterprise again, as the \\"State-owned Assets Law\\" claims that nationalized business' directors, supervisors and senior managements may not serve as directors, supervisors and senior management perpetually if he has caused major losses of state assets before. Obviously Chen's almost leading to the bankruptcy of CAO belong to \\"heavy losses\\". Chinese law expert oppugned Singapore Court's sentence (none of this section is referenced?) Ma Junju, Chen Jiulin's PhD professor, accepted some reporter's interview in early July, 2010, and oppugned Singapore Court's sentence. Ma Junju is a professor at the School of Law, Tsinghua University, a distinguished professor of Southern University of Finance and Economics and he was professor and Dean of Law School in Wuhan University, professor of China University of Political Science and Law. Professor Ma is an expert in Civil Law, Commercial Law and Environmental Law. Prof. Ma said, as far as he knows, Chen Jiulin was not involved in economic crimes like encroachment of property, misappropriation of property or sabotage of social economic order. Chen made mistakes in the process of running CAO‚Äôs operations, but there was no personal motivation for the crime. Thus, what he did could not constitute a crime. Eventually, CAO succeeded in being restructured and it got through the adversity, becoming the largest China-based enterprise and the 4th largest listed company in Singapore. And this achievement has a vital link and relation to the foundation laid by Chen Jiulin. Furthermore, Chen‚Äôs resignation demonstrated his loyalty to the country and his responsibility to the company. However, Chen Jiulin was sentenced to four years and three months in prison by the Singaporean Court. Prof. Ma expressed his doubts on the sentence. He said, as a Chinese civil law scholar, he does not have sufficient knowledge, and he is not in a position to comment on Singaporean laws and court judgment, but he has his doubts. For instance, whether an oral presentation to Deutsche Bank can be used as evidence to identify deception? Whether the sale of shares of China National Aviation Fuel Corporation to save the company is fully considered as an act of a legal person? Similarly, the disclosure of the loss could only be made by the consensus of all Board members. In the whole process, to what extent should Chen bear the due legal responsibility?

It originally aired on Disney Channel on March 1, 2008. The episode concerns stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb fixing a time machine on display in a museum and using it to travel back to prehistoric times. Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus deals with being replaced with a panda bear as the nemesis of the mad scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. \\"It's About Time!\\" was written and directed by series co-creators Dan Povenmire, and storyboards were constructed by multiple artists in the show's production staff. The writers purposely left the time machine available to the boys at the end of the episode in order to reuse it later in the series, which they did in the season 2 episode \\"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo.\\" Critical reception was generally positive, and multiple reviewers applauded Perry and Doofenshmirtz's relationship in the episode, which they noted was portrayed with possible homosexual subtext. Plot Stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher attend a museum, where they discover a broken time machine built in the 1880s on display. Endeavoring to travel through time themselves, they begin fixing it to work properly. This catches the attention of their sister, Candace, who desires to inform their mother of their activities to get in trouble. When she finally gets their mother Linda to follow her and view the machine, Linda becomes distracted while Candace continues to walk to the boys, just as their time machine activates. The three are sent back to the Late Cretaceous Period (erroneously stated to be in 300 million B.C.), where a Tyrannosaurus rex immediately destroys the time machine. Now stranded, the three are forced to flee from the T. rex and are eventually saved by a herd of Alamosaurus lounging in a large pond. Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus arrives at Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz's hideout, where he discovers Doofenshmirtz has gained a new nemesis in the form of Peter the Panda, whom he met in Seattle, Washington. Downtrodden, Perry reminisces about previous battles with Doofenshmirtz when he was his nemesis, while Doofenshmirtz himself grows tired of Peter due to him being much less sympathetic than Perry. Perry and Doofenshmirtz decide to appear on the talk show Dr. Feelbetter, where they decide to once more become nemeses; however, Doofenshmirtz reveals that the whole situation was merely a scheme to capture the world's top agents (who are in the audience) and freeze them with a large ray. This results in a large- scale battle where the agents come out victorious. The boys and Candace return to a muddy area where the T. rex has left a massive footprint, which they recognize will eventually be on display in the museum in the present. Phineas leaves a message in the footprint for Isabella and the Fireside Girls to save them. The girls‚Äîin the present‚Äîimmediately spot the footprint and the message and follow their handbook to create a new time machine. They use the machine to travel back in time and rescue the three. Upon arrival in the present, though, they realize the T. rex returned with them, so Candace flees and tries to expose it to her parents. A stray ray from Doofenshmirtz's machine freezes the creature, so her parents merely believe it is an exhibit. Production alt=A Caucasian man in his forties, seated at a conference, with a microphone in front of him. He has a pleasant square face, deep-set eyes, dark hair and a brown beard with clean-shaved cheeks and upper-lip. He is casually dressed, relaxed and smiling. Square signs are posted on the wall behind him, bearing the name COMIC-CON in big bright yellow letters around a drawn eye and eyebrow. \\"It's About Time!\\" was conceived by the series' four major writers. At a weekly session that Monday, the concept was reviewed and deemed acceptable enough to create. Series co-founder Dan Povenmire was assigned to develop the script, and simultaneously artists Jon Barry, Mike Roth, Kent Osborne, and Aliki Theofilopoulos constructed the episode's storyboards. A walkthrough of the storyboards was presented to the production staff, whose reaction determined whether certain jokes remained in the finished product. Povenmire directed the episode, which was animated at Rough Draft Studios in South Korea. In the conclusion of the episode, Phineas and Ferb's time machine is left in positive condition and available for further use at the museum. The writing staff purposely ended it this way so that they could reutilize it later in the series. A concept was eventually conceived as a way to do so, having \\"Phineas and Ferb go into the future and actually see Candace as an adult (which) drags up all kinds of memories of not being able to bust them.\\" This idea was used for the second season episode, \\"Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo.\\" \\"It's About Time!\\" featured two different musical numbers, entitled \\"My Nemesis\\" and \\"When We Didn't Get Along.\\" During the storyboard stage, a note was simply made indicating that a song would be placed at a certain point in a sequence. As with most songs in the series, they were each written by series co-founders Povenmire and Jeff \\"Swampy\\" Marsh over the course of approximately one hour. Povenmire and Marsh proceeded by singing their draft of the song into the answering machine of the series' composer, Danny Jacob, that Friday night. Jacob performed both of the songs. The episode was originally broadcast in the United States on the Disney Channel on March 1, 2008. \\"It's About Time!\\" became available on the DVD compilation Phineas and Ferb: The Fast and the Phineas in 2008, along with fellow first season episodes, \\"One Good Scare Ought to Do It!\\", \\"The Fast and the Phineas,\\" \\"Lawn Gnome Beach Party of Terror,\\" \\"Flop Starz,\\" \\"Raging Bully,\\" \\"Lights, Candace, Action!\\" and \\"Are You My Mummy?\\" Both \\"My Nemesis\\" and \\"When We Didn't Get Along\\" became available in 2009 on the official Phineas and Ferb soundtrack. Themes Multiple critics have noted that the portrayal of Doofenshmirtz and Perry's relationship in the episode features a somewhat of a homosexual subtext. The concept behind it is a parody of stereotypical teen romance film, casting Perry and Doofenshmirtz‚Äîtwo males who are of different species‚Äîas the teenage couple who is \\"breaking up.\\" Perry's initial suspicions over Doofenshmirtz having a new nemesis are portrayed as if a person discovers their significant other is cheating on them. Perry discovers a paw print on Doofenshmirtz's face, resembling a lipstick mark on the cheek as if from a lover, and Peter the Panda emerges from Doofenshmirtz's closet. Doofenshmirtz initially tries to deny having a new nemesis, but eventually admits to the accusation, noting that he \\"didn't want [Perry] to find out this way,\\" overtly detailing a common way couples discover their partner is cheating on them. Perry is depressed about their \\"break up\\" and reminisces about their past \\"relationship\\" together, while music resembling a love song plays in the background. After feeling depressed himself, Doofenshmirtz \\"dumps\\" Peter and reunites with Perry on a talk show prone to featuring romantic confrontations. Cultural references \\"It's About Time!\\" features multiple cultural references. Aspects of the time machine are based on H.G. Wells' famous novel The Time Machine. During the \\"My Nemesis\\" musical number, caricature of The Archies, a fictional garage band in the animated television series The Archie Show, are shown and begin to sing and play instruments during the course of the sequence. The song itself parodies the style of musician Elvis Costello. The Dr. Feelbetter show incorporates elements of confrontational talk shows Dr. Phil and The Jerry Springer Show. Reception The episode was mostly well received by critics. Blogcritics reviewer Aaraon Peck applauded the Perry and Doofenshmirtz B-Plot, considering it as both the official Pret episode and an example of the series' ability to allow \\"adults [to] enjoy the humor\\" and not strictly focusing on the entertainment of younger viewers. Conversely, Ed Liu of Toon Zone was critical of the episode and other early episodes available on The Fast and the Phineas, calling them \\"way too manic for their own good, never giving a gag enough time to develop a proper laugh before ripping off to the next one, and refusing to sit still for any length of time.\\" The production staff reacted positively to the episode, and said that they \\"really liked\\" its outcome. Reaction to the episode's melodies were also positive. Wolfen Moondaughter wrote in her Sequential Tart article, \\"Five Reasons: Phineas and Ferb,\\" that both \\"My Nemesis\\" and \\"When We Didn't Get Along\\" were among her personal favorite musical pieces from the series, despite the former resembling the styles of Elvis Costello, whom Moondaughter noted she carried a distaste for. A Wired magazine review of the series' soundtrack observed that despite being drastically different from tracks that proceed and precede it, \\"When We Didn't Get Along\\" \\"fit perfectly\\" due to \\"the genius of the malleable songwriting style of Phineas and Ferb's musical brain trust.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2008 American television episodes Category:Phineas and Ferb episodes Category:Television episodes about time travel ","title":"It's About Time!

Since 1972, she has held various positions in the social, community and educational development policy sections of the federal Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. She is a member of the Mohawk Bear Clan of Kahnawake.  Biography  In the 1960s and early 1970s, Kahn-Tineta Horn became widely known for her criticisms of anti-native racism and government policy regarding First Nations peoples, and for her advocacy of native separatism. She was involved in the 1962 Conference on Indian Poverty in Washington D.C., the blocking of the International Bridge at Akwesasne in 1968, and other indigenous rights campaigns. Kahn-Tineta caught the attention of the media in 1964, when she was \\"deposed as a Director of the National Indian Council, and as Indian Princess of Canada.\\" By 1972, her separatist views had appeared in the pages of The Harvard Crimson and The New Yorker, and she had been interviewed by The Webster Reports of KVOS-TV, a Bellingham, Washington station which broadcasts to Vancouver, British Columbia. Horn and her daughters were notable participants in the 1990 Oka Crisis. Her daughter, Waneek Horn-Miller (born 1975), was stabbed in the chest by a soldier's bayonet while holding her younger sister, Kaniehtiio, then aged 4; a photograph of the incident, published on the front page of newspapers, symbolized the standoff between Mohawks and the Canadian government. Waneek became a broadcaster, and co- captain of Canada's first women's national water polo team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Kaniehtiio is now a film and television actress. Kahn- Tineta Horn has appeared in two short films, Artisans de notre histoire, Volume 2: Les Explorateurs (1995) and David Thompson: The Great Mapmaker (1964). She has served as publisher of the Mohawk Nation News. She has served as Director of the Canadian Alliance in Solidarity with Native Peoples and coordinator of the Free Wolverine Campaign. In 2002, she gave a speech at the \\"You Are on Native Land Conference\\" at McGill University titled, How Canada violated the BNA Act to Steal Native Land: The Forgotten Arguments of Deskaheh. In 2006, Kahn-Tineta Horn was one of two women who submitted a \\"notice of seizure\\" to the developers of the Melacthon Wind Farm near Shelburne, Ontario on behalf of the Haudenosaunee, and taught a history class at Concordia University in Montreal. In 2008, at age 68, she suffered a heart attack while \\"handcuffed in a police stress hold\\" at the Cornwall/Akwesasne border crossing.

In recent times, the term may also refer to non-state sponsored groups conducting large- scale targeted intrusions for specific goals. Such threat actors' motivations are typically political or economic. Every major business sector has recorded instances of cyberattacks by advanced actors with specific goals seeking to steal, spy, or disrupt. These sectors include government, defense, financial services, legal services, industrial, telecoms, consumer goods and many more. Some groups utilize traditional espionage vectors, including social engineering, human intelligence and infiltration to gain access to a physical location to enable network attacks. The purpose of these attacks is to install custom malicious software. The median \\"dwell-time\\", the time an APT attack goes undetected, differs widely between regions. FireEye reports the mean dwell-time for 2018 in the Americas is 71 days, EMEA is 177 days and APAC is 204 days. This allows attackers a significant amount of time to go through the attack cycle, propagate and achieve their objective. Definition Definitions of precisely what an APT is can vary, but can be summarized by their named requirements below: *Advanced ‚Äì Operators behind the threat have a full spectrum of intelligence-gathering techniques at their disposal. These may include commercial and open source computer intrusion technologies and techniques, but may also extend to include the intelligence apparatus of a state. While individual components of the attack may not be considered particularly \\"advanced\\" (e.g. malware components generated from commonly available do-it-yourself malware construction kits, or the use of easily procured exploit materials), their operators can typically access and develop more advanced tools as required. They often combine multiple targeting methods, tools, and techniques in order to reach and compromise their target and maintain access to it. Operators may also demonstrate a deliberate focus on operational security that differentiates them from \\"less advanced\\" threats. *Persistent ‚Äì Operators have specific objectives, rather than opportunistically seeking information for financial or other gain. This distinction implies that the attackers are guided by external entities. The targeting is conducted through continuous monitoring and interaction in order to achieve the defined objectives. It does not mean a barrage of constant attacks and malware updates. In fact, a \\"low-and-slow\\" approach is usually more successful. If the operator loses access to their target they usually will reattempt access, and most often, successfully. One of the operator's goals is to maintain long-term access to the target, in contrast to threats who only need access to execute a specific task. *Threat ‚Äì APTs are a threat because they have both capability and intent. APT attacks are executed by coordinated human actions, rather than by mindless and automated pieces of code. The operators have a specific objective and are skilled, motivated, organized and well funded. Actors are not limited to state sponsored groups.  Criteria  One of the first theories for defining criteria as a threat on the opportunistic - APT continuum as either persistent or non-persistent was first proposed in 2010. These APT criteria are now widely used in the industry and are built off of an evaluation of these following details: * Objectives ‚Äì The end goal of your threat, your adversary. * Timeliness ‚Äì The time spent probing and accessing your systems. * Resources ‚Äì The level of knowledge and tools used in the event. * Risk tolerance (by the adversary) ‚Äì The extent the threat will go to remain undetected. * Skills and methods ‚Äì The tools and techniques used throughout the event. * Actions ‚Äì The precise actions of a threat or numerous threats. * Attack origination points ‚Äì The number of points where the event originated. * Numbers involved in the attack ‚Äì How many internal and external systems were involved in the event, and how many peoples systems have different influence/importance weights. * Knowledge source ‚Äì The ability to discern any information regarding any of the specific threats through online information gathering. History and targets Warnings against targeted, socially-engineered emails dropping trojans to exfiltrate sensitive information were published by UK and US CERT organisations in 2005. This method was used throughout the early 1990s and does not in itself constitute an APT. The term \\"advanced persistent threat\\" has been cited as originating from the United States Air Force in 2006 with Colonel Greg Rattray cited as the individual who coined the term. However, the term APT was used within telecommunications carriers years previously. The Stuxnet computer worm, which targeted the computer hardware of Iran's nuclear program, is one example of an APT attack. In this case, the Iranian government might consider the Stuxnet creators to be an advanced persistent threat. Within the computer security community, and increasingly within the media, the term is almost always used in reference to a long-term pattern of sophisticated computer network exploitation aimed at governments, companies, and political activists, and by extension, also to ascribe the A, P and T attributes to the groups behind these attacks. Advanced persistent threat (APT) as a term may be shifting focus to computer-based hacking due to the rising number of occurrences. PC World reported an 81 percent increase from 2010 to 2011 of particularly advanced targeted computer attacks. Actors in many countries have used cyberspace as a means to gather intelligence on individuals and groups of individuals of interest. The United States Cyber Command is tasked with coordinating the US military's offensive and defensive cyber operations. Numerous sources have alleged that some APT groups are affiliated with, or are agents of, governments of sovereign states. Businesses holding a large quantity of personally identifiable information are at high risk of being targeted by advanced persistent threats, including: *Higher education *Financial institutions *Energy *Transportation *Technology *Health care *Telecommunications *Manufacturing *Agriculture A Bell Canada study provided deep research into the anatomy of APTs and uncovered widespread presence in Canadian government and critical infrastructure. Attribution was established to Chinese and Russian actors.  Life cycle  Diagram depicting the life cycle staged approach of an advanced persistent threat (APT) which repeats itself once complete. Actors behind advanced persistent threats create a growing and changing risk to organizations' financial assets, intellectual property, and reputation by following a continuous process or kill chain: # Target specific organizations for a singular objective # Attempt to gain a foothold in the environment (common tactics include spear phishing emails) # Use the compromised systems as access into the target network # Deploy additional tools that help fulfill the attack objective # Cover tracks to maintain access for future initiatives The global landscape of APT's from all sources is sometimes referred to in the singular as \\"the\\" APT, as are references to the actor behind a specific incident or series of incidents, but the definition of APT includes both actor and method. In 2013, Mandiant presented results of their research on alleged Chinese attacks using APT method between 2004 and 2013 that followed similar lifecycle: * Initial compromise ‚Äì performed by use of social engineering and spear phishing, over email, using zero-day viruses. Another popular infection method was planting malware on a website that the victim's employees will be likely to visit. * Establish foothold ‚Äì plant remote administration software in victim's network, create net backdoors and tunnels allowing stealth access to its infrastructure. * Escalate privileges ‚Äì use exploits and password cracking to acquire administrator privileges over victim's computer and possibly expand it to Windows domain administrator accounts. * Internal reconnaissance ‚Äì collect information on surrounding infrastructure, trust relationships, Windows domain structure. * Move laterally ‚Äì expand control to other workstations, servers and infrastructure elements and perform data harvesting on them. * Maintain presence ‚Äì ensure continued control over access channels and credentials acquired in previous steps. * Complete mission ‚Äì exfiltrate stolen data from victim's network. In incidents analysed by Mandiant, the average period over which the attackers controlled the victim's network was one year, with longest ‚Äì almost five years. The infiltrations were allegedly performed by Shanghai- based Unit 61398 of People's Liberation Army. Chinese officials have denied any involvement in these attacks. Previous reports from Secdev had previously discovered and implicated Chinese actors.  Mitigation strategies  There are tens of millions of malware variations, which makes it extremely challenging to protect organizations from APT. While APT activities are stealthy and hard to detect, the command and control network traffic associated with APT can be detected at the network layer level with sophisticated methods. Deep log analyses and log correlation from various sources is of limited usefulness in detecting APT activities. It is challenging to separate noises from legitimate traffic.

As a market run progresses, it generates its own momentum: as more people demand the item, the supply line becomes unable to keep up. This causes a local shortage, which in turn encourages further hoarding. Examples include a run on the gasoline market following hurricane Katrina in 2005, an ammunition shortage following President Obama's election in 2008, and the legendary run on toilet paper following a Johnny Carson joke on The Tonight Show in 1973.

The groups are domain-specific and focus on discussion or activity around a specific subject area. The term can sometimes refer to an interdisciplinary collaboration of researchers working on new activities that would be difficult to sustain under traditional funding mechanisms (e.g., federal agencies). The lifespan of a working group can last anywhere between a few months and several years. Such groups have the tendency to develop a quasi-permanent existence when the assigned task is accomplished; hence the need to disband (or phase out) the working group when it has achieved its goal(s). A working group's performance is made up of the individual results of all its individual members. A team's performance is made up of both individual results and collective results. In large organisations, working groups are prevalent, and the focus is always on individual goals, performance and accountabilities. Working group members do not take responsibility for results other than their own. On the other hand, teams require both individual and mutual accountability. There is more information sharing, more group discussions and debates to arrive at a group decision. Examples of common goals for working groups include: :* creation of an informational document :* creation of a standard :* resolution of problems related to a system or network :* continuous improvement :* research Working groups are also referred to as task groups, workgroups, or technical advisory groups. Characteristics The nature of the working group may depend on the group's raison d‚Äô√™tre ‚Äì which may be technical, artistic (specifically musical), or administrative in nature. Administrative working groups These working groups are established by decision makers at higher levels of the organization for the following purposes: # To elaborate, consolidate, and build on the consensus of the decision makers; and # To ensure (and improve) coordination among the various segments of the organization. A shared commitment to agreed common aims develops among the parties as they work together to clarify issues, formulate strategies, and develop action plans. For example, the Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs is a group of twelve federal agencies within the executive branch of the U.S. government, and is responsible for promoting achievement of positive results for at-risk youth. This working group was formally established by Executive Order 13459, Improving the Coordination and Effectiveness of Youth Programs, on 7 February 2008.Executive Order 13459: Improving the Coordination and Effectiveness of Youth Programs Quality circles are an alternative to the dehumanizing concept of the division of labor, where workers or individuals are treated like robots. Quality circles can help enrich the lives of workers or students and aid in creating harmony and high performance. Typical topics are improving occupational safety and health, improving product design, and improvement in the workplace and manufacturing processes. Musical working groups Although any artisan or artist can benefit from being part of a working group, it is especially of great import for session players. Musicians face a variety of challenges that can impede the formation of musical working groups, such as touring and studio recording sessions. Such activities make it that much more difficult to concentrate on the developing the cohesiveness that is required to maintain a working group. However, working groups have been shown to be rewarding to the stakeholders, as it fosters innovation. By working with the same people frequently, members become familiar with the r√©pertoire of other members, which develops trust and encourages spontaneity. Some of the more notable musical working groups include: * Abdullah Ibrahim Trio; * Alex von Schlippenbach Trio; * Dave Holland (Trio, Quartet, or Quintet); * Die Like A Dog Quartet; * Gary Bartz Quartet; * Vandermark 5; and * William Parker Quartet (Trio/Quartet). Technical working groups In many technical organizations, for example Standards organizations, the groups that meet and make decisions are called \\"working groups\\". Examples include: * IETF working groups (which are subordinate to Areas) **HTTP WG, original led by Dave Raggett *IEEE-SA working groups **IEEE WG802.3, Ethernet Working Group **IEEE WG802.11, Wireless LAN Working Group * ISO working groups (which are subordinate to an SC (subcommittee), subordinate to a TC (technical committee) * International Conference on Harmonisation * International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) * International Astronomical Union * W3C working groups **Device Description Working Group **SVG Working Group *Bioethics Council *Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) *European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS) In some cases, like the Printer Working Group, an entire consortium uses the term \\"working group\\" for itself. The rules for who can be a part of the working groups, and how a working group makes decisions, varies considerably between organizations. Mechanics It is imperative for the participants to appreciate and understand that the working group is intended to be a forum for cooperation and participation. Participants represent the interests and views of stakeholders from disparate sectors of the community which happen to have a vested interest in the results of the WG. Therefore, maintaining and strengthening communication lines with all parties involved is essential (this responsibility cuts both ways ‚Äì stakeholders are expected to share what information, knowledge and expertise they have on the issue). Programmes developed should be evaluated by encouraging community input and support; this will ensure that such programmes meet the community's vision for its future. The WG should also regularly seek community feedback on their projects. Apropos questions to be asked during such meetings include: * What were the objectives of the program? * What were the results of the project? * What effect did the results have on the identified problem? * What unexpected results ‚Äî desirable or otherwise ‚Äî were observed? * How were the results achieved? (Was it by the methods and techniques originally intended, or did these evolve with implementation?) * Was there an effective use of community resources? * Should our objective or methods be changed? Depending on the lifespan of the WG, involved parties (at the very least) convene annually. However, such meetings may happen as often as once every semester or trimester. The managers are constantly called upon to make decisions in order to solve problems. Decision making and problem solving are ongoing processes of evaluating situations or problems, considering alternatives, making choices, and following them up with the necessary actions The Decision‚ÄêMaking Process by John Wiley & Sons.. and now with this managed to reach a continuous improvement.

Professional and personal life Delatour is the widow of Leslie Delatour, the former Governor of the Banque de la R√©publique d'Ha√Øti, the country's central bank. The couple had two children together during their marriage, which lasted until Leslie Delatour's death on January 26, 2001. Delatour received an MBA from The George Washington University in 1988. She has worked as a businesswoman for a Haitian electrical utility as well as a road contractor during her career. She worked as an economic advisor to President Ren√© Pr√©val before her marriage to him in December 2009. First Lady of Haiti Elisabeth D√©brosse Delatour married Ren√© Pr√©val on Sunday, December 6, 2009, becoming First Lady of Haiti. The wedding was held at 11 a.m. at Delatour's home in Furcy, a suburb of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Delatour, who was 47 years old at the time of the wedding, wore a beige dress, while Preval wore a white suit. The ceremony was attended by approximately fifty people. This was Delatour's second marriage, while Preval had been married twice before, both of which ended in divorce.

The First Lady and President both escaped the National Palace, which collapsed in the earthquake. The couple were about to enter the private, presidential living quarters in the National Palace when the earthquake struck. Both were able to move away from the palace before the building collapsed. False rumors initially spread in Port-au-Prince that Delatour Preval had been killed in the quake. In the aftermath of the earthquake Delatour Preval told reporters, \\"I'm convinced the country will make it. Seeing the solidarity among the people, there is hope.\\" Delatour Preval also defended the Haitian government of President Preval against criticism that it was ineffective, or even non- existent, in the days following the earthquake. She reiterated that the government was still functioning, while acknowledging that there was widespread concerns about government effectiveness, especially after the collapse of major government buildings, including the National Palace.

It was a development of Pratt & Whitney's earlier R-1690 Hornet and was basically similar, but enlarged in capacity from 1,690 to .Gunston, p.163Connors, p.79 Cylinder bore was increased by 1/8\\" and the crankshaft stroke by 3/8\\". Both engines were air-cooled radial engines, with a single row of nine cylinders. Design and development The cylinder and valve design was typical for Pratt & Whitney, a simple design with two large valves driven by pushrods. The enlarged engine was designed by George Willgoos and was first available in 1929.Smithsonian The Hornet series of engines was similar to the Wasp, but larger. In both series a nine-cylinder single-row engine was later supplemented by an enlarged fourteen cylinder engine, with two rows of the same cylinders, but reduced in number to seven per row to aid cooling to the rear row (it was never made into a larger, 18 cylinder radial like the related Wasp was). Two of these engines, the enlarged single-row Hornet B described here and the R-1830 Twin Wasp, were of near-identical displacement (1860 vs. 1830), although the fourteen-cylinder Twin Wasp was more complex and costly than the nine-cylinder, single-row Hornet B. The Twin Wasp was by far the more powerful engine though, even in its early versions it produced 800 bhp to the Hornet B's 575 bhp. Having more cylinders per the same displacement also creates a smoother engine, since the individual pistons are smaller and lighter, and the stroke is shorter, which reduces the vibration of reciprocation, and therefore crew and mechanical fatigue. The reduced stroke also allows for a higher maximum RPM limit, since the mean piston speed is reduced, the distance the piston has to cover per each engine revolution being shorter. Having a shorter stroke but a higher rpm limit for the same displacement reduces the peak torque levels, but allows for a higher maximum horsepower rating. A further advantage was the reduced diameter of the Wasp: 48 inches compared to 57. This reduced drag, and the relatively large diameter of the Hornet would also have been a serious drawback for visibility if used in a small single-engined aircraft. Although a technically competent design, the enlarged Hornet B engine was not a commercial success. Customers preferred to buy the R-1830 Twin Wasp instead, which in time became the most numerous aircraft engine ever produced.

It was set in the fictitious Yorkshire town of Ravensbay, a name most probably derived from a combination of Ravenscar and Robin Hood's Bay, seaside villages near the seaside town of Scarborough, North Yorkshire where the series was filmed. The central character was PC Penrose (\\"Rosie\\"), a young and inexperienced police officer, played by Paul Greenwood. The titular character is a nod towards Charles Penrose, who famously recorded the comedy song \\"The Laughing Policeman\\". Rosie was preceded by an earlier series of seven episodes, broadcast in 1975, called The Growing Pains of PC Penrose which was set in the fictitious Yorkshire town of Slagcaster and filmed in Clarke's native South Yorkshire, with the majority of the opening scenes of series one filmed in the village of New Rossington, although the colliery shown in episode one is possibly Hatfield Colliery. The series then underwent a revamp with a new title (Rosie), setting and signature tune.

Penn, Lingwood, Penn and Nemtin released their first book as The Buried Life, \\"What Do You Want to Do Before You Die?\\" on March 27, 2012. On the week of April 15, 2012, the book climbed to #1 on The New York Times Best Seller List.. \\"The New York Times Best Sellers\\". Premise The series focuses on four friends (Ben, Duncan, Jonnie and Dave) as they travel across North America in a purple transit bus named \\"Penelope\\" to complete a list of \\"100 things to do before you die.\\" For every item they try to complete on their list, they help a stranger achieve one of their dreams and encourage others to go after their own lists. The series centered around the question: \\"What do you want to do before you die?\\" They have crossed off most of the numbers on their list. Episodes included completing tasks ranging from asking a girl out to surviving on a desert island. Background The Buried Life is a company formed by four university students from Canada.

On April 18, 2009 an article in The New York Times announced that a serial television version of their documentary titled The Buried Life was chosen by MTV for development. The show was selected as a flagship reality program that would usher in MTV's shift away from the superficial content currently dominating the network's programming, toward the production of more socially conscious media, something the Times dubbed \\"MTV for the era of Obama.\\" In an interview with Shave Magazine, Dave Lingwood revealed that MTV first found the boys on YouTube and later reached an agreement with them whereby they would film, edit and cut all the material themselves and send MTV \\"the finished product and they just air it.\\" Reception=Awards and nominations In 2012 The Buried Life's book titled \\"What Do You Want To Do Before You Die?\\" became a NYT #1 Best Seller, it remained on the list for 4 weeks.

It was built on land that formerly belonged to the Whitefriars in Dublin. It served the largest Church of Ireland parish in Dublin. The church The land of the Whitefriars, who arrived in Dublin the 12th century, took in what was probably a pre-Viking Irish monastic settlement. A small church, dedicated to St. Peter (St. Peter del Hille), was built in 1280 near present-day Stephen St. Later a hostel and church, dedicated to St. Stephen (after which St. Stephen's Green is named) and for the use of lepers, was built nearby, and its clergy also administered to the parishioners of St. Peter's. The Whitefriars were dissolved by Henry VIII in the 16th century and their lands forfeited by the Crown during the Reformation.Wright In 1625 Sir Francis Aungier obtained a grant to the Whitefriars' estates. A later Francis Aungier (created Earl of Longford) started developing the area and while building Aungier Street in 1677 also contributed to the building of the church, which was completed in 1685. The church took the place of the two older churches, both falling into ruin.Craig, p. 40 The new St Peter's was enlarged in 1773. It was rebuilt in the Gothic style in 1867, retaining only the nave walls of the original church. The architect was Edward Henry Carson, father of Edward Carson.McDonald At the time it was the largest Church of Ireland parish church in Dublin. The church was demolished in 1983. In the 19th century charity sermons were delivered in the church by guest preachers. The most famous of these at the church was the Rev. Walter Blake Kirwan (1754-1805). For a number of years he managed to raise over ¬£4,000 per annum for charity, in addition to donations of jewellery, watches and other items which parishioners overcome with emotion spontaneously threw into the collection plate.O'Donovan, Life by the Liffey. P. 41 The churchyard The churchyard of St. Peter's was the final resting place of many members of the parish, which in the 19th century grew to be the largest Church of Ireland parish in Dublin. It was also used as a burial place by the Huguenot community. The churchyard continued in use until about 1883. After the church was closed the churchyard was taken over by W & R Jacob's biscuit factory as a recreation ground for its staff. When the land was developed in the 1980s the remains of the Huguenots were transferred to Mount Jerome cemetery. In December 2000 planning permission was granted to the YMCA by Dublin Corporation to erect a hostel at the site. Among the notable people buried in St. Peter's Churchyard were the Earl of Roden and several members of his family, along with a great number of bishops and other dignitaries. Also interred there are the Dunboyne family, the judge Charles Burton,Mary Anne Holmes, and the notorious Black Jack Fitzgibbon, Earl of Clare and Lord High Chancellor of Ireland. The parish Location of St. Peter's church (in red) on an 1829 map of Dublin Due to the shortage of clergymen after the Restoration, the new parish of St. Peter in 1680 consisted of the old parish, the whole of St. Kevin's, almost all St. Stephen's and a good part of St. Bridged's. Due to the large size of the parish, several chapels-of-ease were required to administer it. These included St. Kevin's in Camden Row, St. Stephen's in Mount St. and several others. The parish corresponded to the civil parish of St. Peter's. Notable parishioners Notable parishioners associated with St. Peter's when the church was built in the 17th century were the Cuff family (after whom Cuffe St. is named), who were relatives of the Aungiers, Lord Arran (son of the Duke of Ormonde), Lady Antrim and Lord MerrionCraig, p. 43 and Lieutenant-general Archibald Hamilton, who fought at the Siege of Derry, in 1688.

Perry is an American businessman, banker, publisher, and broadcaster from Oklahoma. Perry served as the Oklahoma Secretary of Commerce from 1999 to 2000, having been appointed by governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating. Perry was the first African American to hold that position. After being nominated by Keating, Perry was never confirmed by the Oklahoma Senate. Perry's appointment became a central issue in the 2001 Oklahoma Supreme Court case Keating v. Edmondson. Corporate career Perry started the Black Chronicle in 1979, a statewide newspaper based out of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma that focuses on the African community in Oklahoma. At the same time, Perry founded and become the President of Perry Publishing and Broadcasting Company, which is a print media, cable television and radio broadcasting corporation. Perry Publishing owns radio stations KVSP in Oklahoma City, KJMM in Tulsa, and KXCA and KKRX in Lawton. Perry would later come to own the controlling interest in First Security Bank of Oklahoma City. Keating Administration=Commerce Secretary In 1999, following the resignation of Howard Barnett, Jr., Governor of Oklahoma Frank Keating appointed Perry to serve as his third Secretary of Commerce, making Perry the first African American to ever serve in that position. Perry served as Secretary in an unconfirmed basis while his Governor Keating sent his nomination to the Oklahoma Senate. Initially Perry's nomination was set to be heard by Senate Economic Development Committee, where the nominations of Dean Werries, Ron Rosenfeld and Howard Barnett, Jr. (Keating's former Secretaries of Commerce) had been heard. However, President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate Stratton Taylor (at the request of State Senator Angela Monson) transferred his nomination to the Senate Finance Committee, which Senator Monson chaired. Though 10 members of the 15 member committee favored Perry's appointment, Senator Monson blocked the nomination by never allowing it to be heard before the Finance Committee. Ultimately, the Oklahoma Senate adjourned without ever hearing Perry's nomination. Governor Keating and Perry claimed that the reason Perry's nomination was not heard was because he was a conservative Republican African American. They claimed that the move was done at the request of the Legislative Black Caucus, all member of which were Democrats. Senator Monson, however, said that Perry's salary as Commerce Secretary would cost the State too much and be duplicative. Economic Development Secretary After Perry spent a year in political limbo, in May 2000 Governor Keating issued executive order 2000‚Äì11 which abolished the position of Secretary of Commerce and established the position of Secretary of Economic Development and Special Affairs. Keating then nominated Perry to the new position, which Perry would serve in on a voluntary basis. On June 8, 2000, Senator Monson submitted a request for an official opinion to Attorney General of Oklahoma Drew Edmondson concerning Keating's actions. Edmondson issued Attorney General Opinion 2000‚Äì54 on October 26, 2000, in which Edmondson found Keating's actions against the provisions of the Executive Branch Reform Act of 1986. Governor Keating then filed a petition on October 27, 2000, in Oklahoma County District Court to overturn Edmondson's opinion. After hearing oral arguments, the trial judge upheld the Attorney General's opinion. On December 29, 2000, Keating appealed a single issue ‚Äì whether a Governor is empowered to reorganize the executive cabinet throughout the term of office. The appeal was sent to the Oklahoma Supreme Court for consideration. In May 2001, Keating withdraw Perry's nomination for consideration as Economic Development Secretary and instead appointed Perry as his Special Adviser for Economic Development, which is a non-cabinet-level post. Keating v. Edmondson The Supreme Court decided the case of Keating v. Edmondson on December 4, 2001. In a unanimous decision, the Court rejected the Governor's appeal and upheld Edmondson's opinion. Chief Justice Rudolph Hargrave authored the majority opinion and was joined by Justices Watt, Hodges, Lavender, Opala, Kauger, Summers, and Boudreau. Justice Winchester wrote a concurring opinion to the majority. Noting that the legislative intent was clear and not ambiguous, the Court rejected the Governor's position and found that state law provided the Governor no power to alter Cabinet positions at will.

Although the duo only recorded six songs (of which two were never even released), they have since acquired something of a cult reputation in the light of O'Brien's subsequent success as a performer and songwriter. Background In 1971, Richard O'Brien and his girlfriend Kimi Wong were struggling actors, performing in the English touring production of the stage musical Hair. During this time they befriended fellow cast member John Sinclair and, through him, John's childhood friend Andrew (Andy) Leighton, a budding record engineer.\\"Andrew O'Bonzo: A Talk with Richard O'Brien's music publisher, Andy Leighton\\", Crazed Imaginations, No 57 (May 2000), pp 12‚Äì15 When Sinclair left Hair after a knee injury and, he and Leighton attempted to establish their own recording studio, and then co-founded a music publishing company, Druidcrest Music. By this time, Richard O'Brien had left the cast of Hair to join the original London production of Jesus Christ Superstar, although he soon left when the management disagreed over his interpretation of Herod. He and Kimi were married on 4 December 1971.Interview with Kimi Wong O'Brien, in Scott Michaels and David Evans, Rocky Horror: From Concept to Cult, London: Sanctuary Publishing, 2002, pp 43‚Äì61. After the birth of their son the following April, Kimi re-joined the cast of Hair (playing the featured role of Chrissie) while O'Brien stayed home and looked after their son while working on the script that would eventually become The Rocky Horror Show. During that time, John Sinclair and Andy Leighton were frequent visitors to O'Brien's flat and, after initially signing him to their publishing company, subsequently made him a full partner in it. The three men duly adopted the pseudonym of Andrew O'Bonzo to describe themselves, and launched a music production company, Rich Teaboy Productions. The Singles=Merry Christmas Baby/Eddie At a time when it was still common for pop performers to approach record companies to obtain a one-off contract to release a single on their label, Andrew O'Bonzo struck up a deal with Epic Records (a division of CBS Records) for Richard O'Brien and his wife Kimi to release two songs that he had written. Produced under the auspices of Rich Teaboy Productions, the songs were arranged by London musician Robin Sylvester, later to become a prominent session guitarist and (since 2003) bass player for Ratdog. The single, released on 7 December 1973, comprised an original Christmas song, \\"Merry Christmas Baby\\" (sung by Kimi, with some harmonies and a spoken interlude by O'Brien) and, on the B side, Kimi's rendition of \\"Eddie\\" (aka \\"Eddie's Teddy\\"), one of the songs written for The Rocky Horror Show. The latter song, released the same year as the show's original London cast album, can rightly be considered as the first of innumerable cover versions of songs from the cult show. Along with general release, copies of the debut single were also sold from the foyer of the King's Road Theatre in Chelsea, where The Rocky Horror Show was being performed at the time, and were later given away to crew members when work was completed on the show's 1975 film adaptation, The Rocky Horror Picture Show. According to Kimi Wong, the single sold about 12,000 copies and not only got onto the BBC radio playlist but also scored a complimentary review from John Peel, a leading DJ of the day. In an effort to generate further Christmas airplay, the single was re-issued around the same time the following year, on 22 November 1974. I was in Love with Danny/Pseud's Corner During 1974, Rich Teaboy Productions secured a second one-off single deal from Epic Records. This time, the A-side was an original O'Brien composition with the lengthy title of \\"I was in love with Danny (but the crowd was in love with Dean)\\". Essentially a new take on the traditional teenage tragedy song, the song was performed as a duet and told the story of two competing race car drivers, one of whom was killed during the race. The B-side was \\"Pseud's Corner\\", named after a weekly column in the satirical magazine Private Eye, which featured a solo vocal by O'Brien and some complex word play in its dark and obscure lyrics. This time around, the songs were arranged by O'Brien's friend Richard Hartley, former keyboardist for The Tornados, who had also served as arranger and musical director for the original stage production of The Rocky Horror Show. The new single was released on 21 February 1975, but generated little attention or airplay. Liebestr√§ume/There's A Light Rich Teaboy Productions subsequently recorded another two songs by Kimi & Ritz for possible release; however, this time CBS Records did not take up the option. The proposed A-side was an updated version of the \\"Liebestr√§ume\\" by Franz Liszt, with new lyrics by O'Brien. The B-side was to be another selection from The Rocky Horror Show score ‚Äì a version of \\"There's a Light\\" (aka \\"Over at the Frankenstein Place\\"), albeit re-arranged for a string section and a vocal chorus that included Kimi Wong, Richard O'Brien, Belinda Sinclair and perhaps even John Sinclair and Andy Leighton themselves. Legacy During this period, Rich Teaboy Productions oversaw the recording and release of one-off singles credited to other artists including Truth & Beauty (1974), Dicky Hart and the Palpitations (1975) and Belinda Sinclair (with The Richard O'Brien Crusade) (1979). Although O'Brien himself was involved in these projects in various capacities (as a writer, co-writer and/or vocalist), he and his wife never again recorded under the name Kimi & Ritz. Kimi Wong appeared in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), and in O'Brien's follow-up stage musical, T Zee (1976) before the couple divorced in 1979. Since 1975, the three Kimi & Ritz singles have never been commercially re-issued in any format, although they were later included on a limited edition bootleg CD entitled Dark Refrains (1996), which consisted of rare Rocky Horror-related audio tracks. Both the original 7-inch vinyl releases, and the bootleg CD (of which only 35 copies were pressed) remain extremely rare and sought-after collector's items, particularly amongst fans of The Rocky Horror Show. In more recent years, the tracks (except for the still-unreleased \\"Liebestr√§ume\\" and \\"There's a Light\\" recordings) have circulated as internet downloads from various websites.

The dictionary was first proposed to the Council in 1920 by historian Frederick Jackson Turner. Janny Scott, \\"Commerce and Culture Clash: Publisher Seeks to Update a Classic, to Cries of 'Thuggery,' \\" New York Times, November 22, 1996, p. B15. The first edition was published in 20 volumes from 1928 to 1936, appearing at a rate of two or three volumes per year. These 20 volumes contained 15,000 biographies. In 1946, the 20 volumes were released as a ten-volume set, with each of the ten volumes divided into two parts (Part 1 and Part 2) corresponding to two volumes of the first edition combined into one, the page numbering of the first edition being retained. The ACLS appealed to Adolph Ochs, publisher of The New York Times, for funding. He loaned the Council $50,000 per year for 10 years. Scott, B15. Ochs exercised no editorial control. The dictionary included no biographies of the living, and some period of residence in the United States was required for inclusion. These twenty volumes had numerous quirks. For example, the entry for Mary Baker Eddy filled eight pages, the entry for Mark Twain only six and a half. Connecticut and Massachusetts were overrepresented, while Arizona had just one entry. Noticeable omissions included, among others, Sojourner Truth, Martha Washington, Scott Joplin, Charles Guiteau, and Joe Hill. In the early volumes terms such as \\"red men\\" and \\"savages\\" were occasionally used. Scott, p. B1. With the passage of time the usefulness of the series as a reference work waned. Ten supplementary volumes were issued, between 1944 and 1995, each covering people who had died after the previous supplement. The first eight supplements were produced under the auspices of the American Council of Learned Societies. The details below regarding the dispute between Macmillan and the ACLS are from Scott. By terms of an agreement signed in 1990, Macmillan was allowed to produce the final two supplements, covering people who had died through 1980, without the Council's participation. (Macmillan acquired the dictionary's publisher Charles Scribner's Sons in 1984.) When Macmillan in 1993 applied to the ACLS for permission to publish a further supplement, the Council refused. In mid 1995 Macmillan announced that it would put the old D.A.B. on CD-ROM, with updates to the existing entries as well as new biographies of people left out of the old dictionary. Professor Stanley N. Katz, then president of the Council, protested that the publisher had no legal right to do so without the Council's approval. Macmillan insisted that the terms of the 1927 licensing agreement with Scribner's gave it the right to publish the dictionary \\"in all forms.\\" In May 1996 the American Council of Learned Societies sued Macmillan in Federal District Court in Manhattan to try to block it from publishing the D.A.B. on CD-ROM and adding what it considered unauthorized supplements. \\"Our client has taken the position that we want the original work preserved in its pristine form,\\" said Lawrence S. Robbins, a lawyer representing the Council. \\"We regard it as a treasure and we don't want it to be tinkered with. The suit says, in part, we don't want it updated, missing-personed, digitized, colorized. We want it to exist the way it is.\\" Macmillan moved to have the lawsuit thrown out. The ACLS signed a contract with Oxford University Press to publish a new series to be called the American National Biography, with financial support from the National Endowment for the Humanities and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

The Orcutt field was called the \\"Santa Maria Field\\" until the discovery of the larger Santa Maria Valley Oil Field on the plain to the north, an area which is now largely covered with the urban and suburban development. Several oil companies, including Breitburn Energy and Phoenix Energy, LLC are still actively producing from the Orcutt field. p. 94 The field, mostly located on the old Careaga family ranch, also contains the remains of the ghost town of Bicknell, a company town built for oil workers in the early years of the 20th century, but abandoned in the mid-1930s.North Hills Project: history of the Orcutt Hills Setting Detail of the Orcutt field, showing adjacent highways and the town of Orcutt to the north.

PDF file available on CD from www.consrv.ca.gov. p. 367 Most of the active oilfield operations are invisible from the populated parts of the Santa Maria Valley, as the wells, tanks, and other facilities are behind the Graciosa Ridge, which rises to elevation at Mount Solomon, and the most active part of the field in 2009 was on the south slope of the range. There are no public roads entering the field. Terrain is rolling and occasionally steep, with wellpads cut into hillsides or occupying flat areas. Native vegetation is a mix of chaparral and oak woodlands (California montane chaparral and woodlands), with some stands of Bishop pine (Pinus muricata) on north-facing slopes. The region has a Mediterranean climate, with cool and rainy winters, and dry summers during which the heat is greatly diminished by fog and northwesterly winds from the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, which is about west of the field. Prevailing winds year-round are from the west- northwest. Approximately of rain falls in a typical winter, with the rainy season lasting from around November to April. Drainage on the south side of the hills is down Harris Canyon, Long Canyon, and Careaga Canyon, to San Antonio Creek, which exits to the ocean through Vandenberg Air Force Base. Drainage to the north is to Orcutt Creek, which passes Old Town Orcutt on the north on its way to its juncture with the Santa Maria River and the Pacific Ocean near Guadalupe. Geology Santa Maria Valley Oil Field Structure Map The Orcutt field is one of several along the Casmalia-Orcutt Anticline, one of several anticlinal structures in the region along which oil fields are found, with the Solomon Hills being the surface expression of this anticline. In the Orcutt field, oil has pooled in a dome-like structure bounded on the north by the Orcutt Fault and on the southwest by the Casmalia Fault, at a minimum depth of in a diatomite formation. The deepest oil-producing horizon was not discovered until 1981, and yields oil from about below ground surface.DOGGR, p. 366-369 The capping geologic units are the Sisquoc, Careaga, and Foxen formations. The Careaga and Foxen are of Pliocene age, while the thicker, diatomaceous Sisquoc is both Pliocene and Upper Miocene. Beneath these, separated by an unconformity, is the fractured shale of the Monterey Formation which has been richly productive for over 100 years. This is the same producing formation as in many other California oil fields, including the Lompoc Oil Field in the similarly anticlinal ridge of the Purisima Hills to the south, and the Zaca field to the southeast. Oil from the field is heavy in the main Monterey producing horizon, with API gravity of 14-17. The Point Sal formation, discovered in 1905 at a depth of , has lighter oil, with gravity 22-24. Some of the more recently discovered deep horizons, such as the Lospe in the Careaga Area, or the Deep Monterey in the field's Main Area, are lighter yet. These two pools were discovered in 1985 and 1981, respectively. History, operations, and production Orcutt field, looking north from the Solomon Hills. Detail of a panorama; around 1910. Prospectors long suspected the presence of oil in the Santa Maria Valley and surrounding hills, but the late 19th-century attempts to find it were either shallow or misplaced. Union Oil Co. geologist William Warren Orcutt, for whom the town is named, began exploring the area in 1901, and suggested drilling in the Solomon Hills south of the then small town of Santa Maria. Following his suggestion, the company leased around in the valley and vicinity, including the hills, and began drilling. In October 1901, their third well on the Careaga lease came in at , beginning the field's long history. The most productive well of all, and one of the most productive in the history of the industry, was the result of an accident. In 1904 a drilling crew was transporting their equipment to a pre- determined location, but a road accident on the way upended the boiler they had been carrying. Rather than putting the rig back together and continuing, they decided to make their work easier and drill on the spot. It turned out to be a good idea. \\"Old Maud\\", as the well became known, came in as a spectacular gusher, producing and flooding a canyon with oil as crews struggled to contain tens of thousands of barrels of black goo running downhill by hurriedly constructing earthen dams. This well was the largest oil producer on the continent up until this time, with Spindletop in Texas being a close second.Santa Barbara Independent: History of Orcutt It produced over in its long history, not being plugged and abandoned until 1988. The origin of the name \\"Old Maud\\" has not been definitively determined; some sources attribute it to the name of a mule, others to a favored town prostitute. Peak oil production from the Orcutt field ‚Äì or the Santa Maria field as it was known then ‚Äì occurred early, in 1908, at in that year. By this year the boom town of Orcutt, built to house the oilfield workers, already had approximately 1,000 residents, along with saloons, hotels, and restaurants. Production from the field began to slow after the peak, and in the late 1920s Union Oil, which by then owned the majority of the field, cut production in half. During the boom period, Union Oil built a small company town on the field itself. Bicknell, which still appears on USGS topographic maps, was abandoned in the 1930s, with some of the houses themselves being moved down the hill to Orcutt. At its peak it included a post office, grocery store, and school house, in addition to residences. The school house is the solitary remaining building, and is currently in use by Breitburn Energy, who operates much of the field. In 1947 the name of the field was changed officially from \\"Santa Maria\\" to \\"Orcutt\\", to differentiate it from the Santa Maria Valley field to the north, discovered in 1934. Several enhanced recovery operations have been used on the field, beginning with waterflooding in 1951 (a technique of filling a depleting reservoir with wastewater, both to dispose of produced water and to increase reservoir pressure, allowing more oil to be pumped out). Both gas injection and alkaline flood operations have been used in the Point Sal horizon in the Main Area. Unocal sold the field in the 1990s along with other assets in California. Other owners have included Nuevo Energy, who sold the field in 2003 to Energy Reserves Group LLC. This company operated the field for one year before selling to Breitburn Energy in 2004 for $46.7 million.Erg Resources LLC: history Breitburn remains the largest operator on the field.Breitburn 10-K 2006 Annual Report Another operator active as of 2010 is Pacific Resources, LLC, a division of Santa Maria Pacific.Query for operators on Orcutt Field: California Department of Conservation database See also * Lompoc Oil Field * Orcutt Ranch Horticulture Center References Category:Geography of Santa Barbara County, California Category:Oil fields in Santa Barbara County, California ","title":"Orcutt Oil Field"},{"id":"25875185","title":"Swimming at the 2001 World Aquatics Championships ‚Äì Men's 200 metre butterfly"},{"id":"25875210","text":"The Niue‚ÄìUnited States Maritime Boundary Treaty is a 1997 treaty that delimits the maritime boundary between Niue and American Samoa.

The origins of the battery began as the Darlington Guards, a local militia of Darlington, South Carolina. The Darlington Guards volunteered their service to South Carolina on January 4, 1861, for a period of six months. These men were the very first soldiers to volunteer to fight in Civil War. They became Company B, First South Carolina Volunteers, commanded by Captain F.F. Warley and Lieutenant David Gregg McIntosh. After six months on the Charleston, South Carolina, coast and a short campaign in Virginia, the unit was released. Half the unit remained with Captain Warley and served the remainder of the war as the Darlington Guards. The other half reformed in Darlington, South Carolina, under McIntosh. The unit called themselves the Pee Dee Rifles and in August 1861 rendered their service as an infantry unit to the Confederate States of America for the duration of the war. While in training in Suffolk, Virginia, in the winter of 1861-62, the unit was reorganized as Company D, First South Carolina Regiment, a light artillery battery, and became the Pee Dee Light Artillery. In 1862, the battery was assigned to General A.P. Hill‚Äôs Light Artillery Division and fought in the Seven Days Battles. During that battle, two horses were shot from beneath Captain McIntosh in a single day. Afterwards, the battery was reorganized under General Stonewall Jackson‚Äôs famous Second Corps. The battery fought with General Jackson at the Battles of Cedar Mountain, Second Manassas, Chantilly, Harpers Ferry, Sharpsburg and the Fredericksburg. In 1863, the battery fought in the Battle of Chancellorsville and the Battle of Gettysburg. In 1864, the battery did not have enough men and horses to effectively operate in battle. In June 1864, the battery exchanged service with Charles Battery serving in the Charleston Harbor. In 1864 the Pee Dee Light Artillery served around Charleston Harbor until they were utilized in an effort to slow down Sherman‚Äôs March to the Sea. In 1865, the Pee Dee Light Artillery continued as part of the Confederate forces under General Johnston. On April 26, 1865, General Johnston surrendered his forces. The battle flag of the Pee Dee Light Artillery was never surrendered. Instead, it was wrapped around the body of the battery guidon bearer, Private R.C. Nettles who returned to South Carolina. The battle flag remained in the hands of the members of the Pee Dee Light Artillery in the Darlington area until 1905, when it was turned over to the South Carolina Legislature by surviving veterans. The flag has recently been preserved and remains today in the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum in Columbia, South Carolina.

Common names include silky grevillea, Darwin silky oak, ferny-leaved silky oak, fern- leaved grevillea, golden grevillea, golden tree and golden parrot tree. It occurs in Western Australia, Northern Territory, and Queensland. Taxonomy Grevillea pteridifolia was first collected by Europeans from the vicinity of the Endeavour River sometime around 10 June and again from Lookout Point around 4 August 1770 by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, naturalists on the Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean.* However, the description of the species was not published until Joseph Knight described it in his 1809 work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae as Grevillia Pteridifolia (the \\"Pteris-leaved Grevillia\\"), The following year Robert Brown gave it the name Grevillea chrysodendron in his work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. In 1870, George Bentham used Brown's name in volume 5 of his landmark publication Flora Australiensis, however it has since been reduced to synonymy with Grevillea pteridifolia as it is not the oldest published name. Description Grevillea pteridifolia generally grows as a large shrub to small tree with pinnatisect (deeply lobed) leaves that are long, and elongated bright orange inflorescences long which are terminal (at the ends of branches). Plants from Queensland are non-lignotuberous shrubs to small trees with smooth bark and lighter inflorescences than other forms. A prostrate form which spreads up to across is found on exposed areas near Cooktown in north Queensland. Plants from Western Australia and the Northern Territory grow as a rough-barked lignotuberous shrub to small tree. A population of this last form from Kakadu National Park has all-silvery leaves. Distribution and habitat Grevillea pteridifolia is found from the Kimberleys in northern Western Australia, across the Northern Territory and into Queensland where it is found along the Great Dividing Range to the vicinity of Barcaldine. It is found in regions with wet summers, dry winters and annual rainfall. Uses and cultivation Grevillea pteridifolia grows readily in warm climates, generally preferring extra water in summer and well- drained soils. The brittle branches can break in strong winds. Several popular garden grevilleas are hybrids between Grevillea pteridifolia and other species. Grevillea 'Sandra Gordon' is the result of crossing with G. sessilis. Grevillea 'Honey Gem' is a cross with a red form of Grevillea banksii. Similar to 'Honey Gem' is G. 'Winter Sparkles', another hybrid of G. pteridifolia and G. banksii. The leaves were used as stuffing and as a herb when cooking emu by the Aborigines on Groote Eylandt, and used by early settlers to stuff pillows. A series of compounds with antibacterial activity, called the kakadumycins, have been isolated from a streptomycete recovered from G. pteridifolia.

It is one of the species of Haworthiopsis that is commonly cultivated as an ornamental. Description H. reinwardtii with its typical thin, strongly tubercled leaves It is a perennial succulent, with stems growing to in height, with a basal rosette of white-spotted fleshy leaves arranged in a spiral pattern, and racemes of tubular pinkish-white flowers in spring. The plant spreads to form a mat, by means of freely- produced offsets, also a convenient means of propagation. It is frequently confused with Haworthiopsis coarctata - a closely related species which occurs just to the west of this species' natural range and looks very similar. However H. reinwardtii has larger, flatter and whiter tubercles on its leaves (those of H. coarctata are smaller, smoother and rounder). H. reinwardtii also has thinner, narrower leaves.http://haworthia- gasteria.blogspot.com/2008/02/haworthia-reinwardtii.html Varieties This variable species has a large number of recognised varieties, some of which are depicted below: File:Haworthia reinwardtii var chalumna - Robertson RSA.jpgThe Chalumnensis variety (\\"chalumna\\") File:Haworthia reinwardtii var wesleyensis - Robertson RSA.jpgThe Wesleyensis variety File:Haworthia reinwardtii forma kaffirdriftensis Cacti.jpgThe Kaffirdriftensis variety File:Haworthia reinwardtii forma zebrina 2.jpgThe Zebrina variety File:Haworthia reinwardtii var olivacea 2.jpgThe Olivacea variety Cultivation H. reinwardtii requires very well-drained soil and some exposure to sun.

Under the name (alternative spelling ) the plant, known formerly as Euphorbia splendens, is considered to be sacred in the Bathouist religion of the Bodo people of Assam, West Bengal, Nagaland and Nepal, in which it symbolises the supreme deity, Bathoubwrai (Master of the Five Elements). This cultivation of the tree for ritual purposes was particularly strong among the Bodo people (known also as Mech) of the Goalpara region. The plant does not often set seed, but is easy to propagate vegetatively; branches broken from an established plant root readily as cuttings. Families that follow Bathouism plant a shrub at the northeast corner of their courtyard in an altar referred to as the . Bodo communities that follow Bathouism generally plant a shrub or small tree in a piece of communally-owned land, which they fence with eighteen pairs of bamboo strips with five fastenings.

The river is some long and drains of land. Course It rises at in elevation on Blue Bunch Ridge in the Sawtooth Range of south-central Idaho, close to Payette Lake. From there, it flows north, through the broad Meadows Valley past Meadows and New Meadows, where it receives Goose Creek from the right and Mud Creek from the left. The river then enters a canyon, cutting across the western edge of the Salmon River Mountains, forming the boundary between Idaho County and Adams County and also running next to U.S. Highway 95. It receives Hazard Creek and Payette Creek both from the right, then receives Boulder Creek, the Rapid River and Squaw Creek from the left, and past Pollock, before joining the Salmon River at the town of Riggins, at above sea level. Discharge A U.S. Geological Survey stream gauge at the mouth recorded an average flow of from 1952 to present. The highest flow ever recorded was on June 17, 1974. Geology and land use The Little Salmon River formed as a result of a rift valley developing between the Rocky Mountains and the Columbia Plateau section of the Intermontane Plateaus. Columbia River basalts underlie much of the western and central parts of the watershed, while other types of volcanic rock of closer origin form the foundations of the eastern mountains. The entire watershed is dissected by fault-block rifting. The water table is high and soils are generally well drained and of volcanic origin. The upper section of the watershed is a broad and low-gradient, sediment-floored valley used primarily for agriculture and ranching activities, and also has most of the basin's population. The rest of the river flows in a wild, deep, and narrow canyon mostly undeveloped with the exception of the highway. Logging has also been a past activity in the valley, and tourism and fishing are growing industries. In a rare occurrence with rivers, the Little Salmon starts out in a developed, relatively flat area and flows through mountains further downstream, bearing some resemblance to the Klamath River, which also begins in an agricultural valley before cutting through mountains to the sea. History Historically, the Nez Perce, Shoshone and Bannock Native American tribes inhabited the watershed of the Little Salmon River. Their lifestyle depended on the river for salmon and on the surrounding lands for other animals, as well as precious natural minerals and resources that provided them with items to trade. Europeans introduced horses to the Bannock, who in turn spread their use to the Shoshones, allowing them to travel further and hunt buffalo and other big game. Settlers began arriving in the 1850s and established farms, ranches and towns. Communications to the outside world was limited until the construction of roads and railroads in the early 20th century. Despite that, the region has still remained relatively isolated. The Payette National Forest and Nez Perce National Forest cover portions of the Little Salmon River watershed, but at no point does the river flow over federally protected lands. However, the river is also completely free flowing and unobstructed by dams or dikes. Most of the watershed receives about of rainfall per year. On higher mountain slopes rainfall can be up to annually, and on the highest west-facing mountains, precipitation can be much higher than that. About half of the river is inhabited by namesake salmon, but at river mile 24.7 (river kilometer 39.8) Little Salmon Falls, at the confluence with Round Valley Creek, marks the end of the limit for anadromous fish. However, this barrier may have been different at some point in the past, because Native Americans have traditionally fished on the Little Salmon well upriver of the falls. Other than salmon, steelhead, Pacific lamprey, several different species of trout and dace, and other species of fish, are also present. Cottonwood, willow, dogwood and alder grow along the banks of the river. Hydrology Irrigation is now the primary water use in the Little Salmon River watershed. Although irrigated farmland lies all along the river, most of it is in the Meadows Valley and also in the watershed of Round Valley Creek, a major western tributary. There are of irrigated farmland in the Meadows Valley and the Round Valley Creek area, and closer to the mouth of the river. Although no dams have been built on the river, there are three dams in the headwaters of Goose Creek, a major tributary of the river, to regulate flows for irrigation water. The total water usage for irrigation is per year.

The principal tributary and outlet is the North Fork Payette River. The lake receives drainage from of heavily forested, mountainous terrain. Further south, the North Fork flows into Lake Cascade, a reservoir behind Cascade Dam. History Prior to the arrival of Euro- American hunters in the 1830s, the area had been inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years. The discovery of gold in 1862 in the upper drainage of Payette Lake prompted an influx of miners to the area. The townsite of McCall was established on the lake's southern shore in the 1880s. The area became more accessible in 1914 when a railroad and roads were extended to McCall, which was becoming a tourist destination for summer and winter recreation. In 1920, the Idaho State Land Board began leasing vacation homesites around Payette Lake. Increasing recreational demands led to the establishment of Brundage Mountain Ski Area and Ponderosa State Park, both near McCall, in the 1960s. The large Payette Lakes Club was said to be significant in supporting recreation in the area; it was built 1914-15, on a knoll overlooking the lake from the west, and served as an inn, a casino, and a Chautauqua center. It was surrounded by development of many small cabin lots. With accompanying pictures In popular culture In Idaho folklore, a sea serpent much like the Loch Ness Monster is said to live in the deep waters of Payette Lake near McCall. In 1954, the creature was given the name Sharlie.

The \\"FR\\" stands for Fusil Reformado in Spanish (\\"Converted Rifle\\" in English). The FR 7 is a variant of the \\"Spanish M93 Mauser\\" bolt action while the FR 8 is based on the \\"Mauser System 98\\" bolt action. Due to their light weight, short barrel and the calibre used, their recoil and muzzle blast are relatively heavy.  History  The FR7 and FR8 were introduced in the 1950s when the Spanish military was already implementing the CETME automatic rifle, but did not yet have sufficient inventory to equip and train all troops. The rifles were made from existing stockpiles of Mauser bolt-action rifles. The FR-7 was a modification of the Model 1916 short rifle, which in turn was based on the Mauser Model 1893. These three rifles are often referred to as being \\"small ring\\" Mausers, as the receiver ring is smaller in diameter than the latter Model 1898 by .110-inch (1.410 inches vs. 1.300 inches).

History The layout for the then-proposed Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike showing Penn's Neck before the building of the church The church was built alongside the then new Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike, now Route One. The turnpike, which had opened in 1807, was designed to help provide a proper road connection between Philadelphia and New York City. The parsonage pre-dated the church and had been a public house in which, it is thought, George Washington and William Penn had stayed. At the time the area was also called Williamsburg and the church was first referred to as Williamsborough Baptist. The Rev. Peter Wilson started in ministry in central Jersey preaching in private homes, starting at that of John Flock in Pennington in 1790, and also at John Campbell's house in Princeton. In 1791 John Hight and his wife of Penn's Neck were baptized and preaching continued in their home as well as others in Princeton.

Mangere Bridge. The cycleway along a container freight depot. The Waikaraka Cycleway is an off-road cycleway in the south of Auckland City, New Zealand, running from the Wesley suburb in southern Auckland City along New Zealand State Highway 20 to Onehunga and then continuing along the shoreline of the Manukau Harbour (Mangere Inlet) beside mostly industrialised areas until it ends at Hugo Johnston Drive, in Southdown.  Construction and extensions  The initial construction of the cycleway was plagued by cost blow-outs, as the cost- estimates did not sufficiently allow for a number of extra factors during construction, such as remedial work around contaminated land, and the need to construct the path to a long-lasting quality on worse ground than initially expected, and above an underground gas pipeline route.  Along SH20  Originally running only currently 4km from Onehunga, near the Mangere Bridge to Pikes Point, the cycleway was extended in 2008 along the Southwestern Motorway (State Highway 20) as far as the motorway's western end.Two Thumbs Up For Newest Cycleway (press release of Auckland City Council, via scoop.co.nz, 14 September 2007. Accessed 2010-01-20.) As of early 2010 this extension of the link currently still had gaps near Onehunga and the Mt Roskill cone, which were closed as works on the Mangere Bridge duplication and the Mt Roskill park facilities proceeded, with this latter gap finished in July 2010. The Mt Roskill gap was particularly late in being closed, due to sensitive issues regarding building a motorway and the associated cycleway across the side of a protected environment that is also important to local Maori. An agreement was finally reached that narrowed the cycleway locally (but avoided proposals which would have created long detours around the south of the mountain) and included significant new landscaping, as well as Maori carvings such as a winged sculptural gate across the path. Other linkages  NZ Transport Agency has also improved linkages to the cycleway near Mangere Bridge,Manukau Harbour Crossing - Walking and Cycling Improvements (project website of NZ Transport Agency. Accessed 2010-01-20.) including with a new overbridge over Onehunga Harbour Road and works on the causeway / Old Mangere Bridge link to the Mangere Bridge suburb to the south.  Link to Northwestern Cycleway  In May 2011, the Board of Inquiry hearing the resource consent process for the Waterview Connection decided that NZTA was to set aside $8 million for the construction of an off-road surface cycleway between SH16 and the existing SH20 section in Hillsborough, as part of the tunneling project.

It is native to shallow coastal and estuarine waters of southeastern Australia, where it is widespread and abundant. French naturalist Christophe-Paulin de La Poix de Fr√©minville described the species in 1813, though early records confused it with its close relative, the common toadfish (T. hamiltonii). The two are the only members of the genus Tetractenos after going through several taxonomic changes since discovery. Up to long with distinctive leopard-like dark markings on its dorsal side, the smooth toadfish has a rounded front and tapers to a narrow tail at the back. Unlike most of its relatives, it does not have prominent spines on its body. Like other pufferfish, it can inflate itself with water or air. It forages for its preferred foods‚Äîmolluscs and crustaceans‚Äîin sand and mud of the bottom sediment. Often an unwanted catch by anglers, the smooth toadfish is highly poisonous because of the tetrodotoxin present in its body, and eating it may result in death. Taxonomy French naturalist Christophe- Paulin de La Poix de Fr√©minville described the smooth toadfish in 1813 as Tetrodon glaber, based on a specimen collected in Adventure Bay in southeastern Tasmania by Claude Riche. This holotype was then catalogued in the collection of French naturalist Alexandre Brongniart, but was subsequently lost; upon his death, Brongniart's collection was bequeathed to the Paris Museum and the specimen did not appear there nor at any other institution. The specific name glaber is from the Latin adjective glƒÉber, meaning \\"bald\\". Fr√©minville's description was overlooked by many subsequent authorities, resulting in the confusion of this species with the closely related common toadfish (Tetractenos hamiltoni); it is unclear with many records which species was being referred to, though those from Victoria and Tasmania belong to this species. This issue in the scientific literature was not fully resolved until 1983. French naturalist Auguste Dum√©ril erected a new genus in publishing the species as Aphanacanthe reticulatus in 1855 from a description authored by his countryman Gabriel Bibron, who had died suddenly, Later Latinised to Aphanacanthus, it was linked to a presumed type species Tetrodon reticulatus, from a manuscript by Bibron. In 1959, Yseult Le Danois equated this species name to Tetractenos hamiltoni, but New Zealand zoologist Graham Hardy later reviewed the specimens labelled as T. hamiltoni and found that they should be assigned to T. glaber. The genus name Aphanacanthe‚Äînot Aphanacanthus, as the original spelling takes priority‚Äîwould have taken precedence over the current genus name Tetractenos. However, it is a nomen nudum as it does not provide enough detail or information to diagnose or properly describe the species, since Dum√©ril had only written a (French) translation of the genus name‚ÄîŒ±œÜŒ±ŒΩŒ∑œÇ qui n–µ parait pas, ·ºÉŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ∏Œ±, √©pine (\\"with no thorns\\"). British ichthyologist Charles Tate Regan described Spheroides liosomus in 1909 from specimens collected in Melbourne, Hobart, Flinders Island and Port Phillip. He noted its lack of spines compared with specimens of Tetrodon hamiltonii, and hence argued that it was a distinct and separate species. Australian biologist Gilbert Whitley equated Regan's description with Fr√©minville's original naming and gave it the combination Spheroides glaber in 1955, and later Gastrophysus glaber in 1964. The smooth toadfish was assigned to the genera Tetrodon (now Tetraodon) and Sphaeroides, both of which became wastebasket taxa. The smooth toadfish was assigned to several other genera after it became clear that it fell outside a more restricted definition of Tetr(a)odon, including Torquigener. Recognising that the smooth and common toadfish were distinct enough from other species to warrant their own genus and that no valid genus name existed, Hardy reassigned the two species to the new genus Tetractenos in 1983. Common names include smooth toadfish, smooth toado, slimey toadfish or smooth blowie. Along with related toadfish species, the smooth toadfish is known in Australia as a \\"toadie\\". Gaguni is a Tharawal name for toadfish in the Sydney region, the word recorded by William Dawes as ca-gone in his 1791 diaries of the Sydney language. Description alt=Two fish with brown markings swim in shallow water. With a total adult length of anywhere from , the smooth toadfish has an elongate body with a rounded back and flattened belly. The body narrows posteriorly to the slender tail, and its fins are all elongate and rounded. The dorsal fin has 9 to 11 rays. The pectoral fin has 15 to 18 rays, the first of which is very short. It arises well below the level of the eye. The anal fin has 7‚Äì9 rays and caudal fin has 11. The smooth toadfish has a small mouth with thin lips at its apex and a tiny chin. The round eyes are adnate (unable to rotate), their upper border is level with the profile of the back and the lower border is well above the mouth. In a slightly depressed area just in front of the eyes are two small nipple-shaped structures (papillae) that are the nasal organs. The openings face to the rear of the fish and are closed by flaps attached to the walls closest to the fish's midline. The first pharyngobranchial gill arch is elongated and narrow with many tiny teeth. The smooth toadfish has tiny spines that are entirely within the skin layer; these run along its back from the nasal organs almost to the dorsal fin, and along its sides from the eye to the pectoral fine, and along its underparts from behind its mouth to its vent. The skin is smooth even when the fish is fully inflated. It swallows water or air via a flap in its throat to swell itself up. The base colour of the upperparts is pale tan to yellow-green, heavily marked with irregular brown spots in a reticulated pattern, and several broad dark brown bands, including ones between the eyes, between the pectoral fins and at the level of the dorsal fin. Reminiscent of a leopard's spots, the reticulated pattern continues on the upper lateral side along the body of the fish, becoming silver-white on the lower lateral parts. The chin and belly are white. The fins have a faint yellow-orange tinge, more noticeably in the tail fin. Fieldwork in Sydney waters found females to be larger and heavier than males. Smooth toadfish grow steadily larger as they grow older, with one long individual calculated to be 13 years old from examination of its otoliths. Their gonads develop when they reach a total length of about . The smooth toadfish can be distinguished from the otherwise similar common toadfish by its lack of spines and its larger- and bolder-patterned markings on its upperparts. Distribution and habitat The smooth toadfish is found along Australia's eastern and southeast coast, from Moreton Bay in southeastern Queensland to Port Lincoln in South Australia as well as Kangaroo Island and Tasmania. It is one of the most abundant fishes in the muddy areas of Port Philip Bay. It generally lives in shallow water less than 3 m (10 ft) deep, often over mudflats in estuaries. In areas of seagrass beds, smooth toadfish are more commonly found in sand areas bordering on the seagrass patches. They are more commonly found in seagrass patches in water less than 1.5 m (5 ft) deep rather than deeper water of 3.5‚Äì6 m (11‚Äì20 ft). A South Australian field study on wrack and associated fauna found that the smooth toadfish was associated with larger volumes and aggregations containing green algae. Although its movements are poorly known, tagging patterns indicate that the smooth toadfish spends most of its life cycle and reproduces in estuaries. It can venture well into freshwater past brackish areas. In 1964 a school of toadfish were found in the Lang Lang River at the South Gippsland Highway‚Äî34 km (21 mi) from Western Port Bay and well beyond tidal areas. Conservation Its large range, abundance and stable population mean the smooth toadfish is classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Although no decline in numbers has been recorded, the effects of disappearance of its habitat‚Äîmangroves and seagrass beds‚Äîis unknown. Breeding The breeding habits of estuary-dwelling pufferfish have been little researched in general. Fieldwork in the Hawkesbury River and tributaries north of Sydney found that the smooth toadfish breeds between April and July, building up fat stores in its liver from February to April beforehand. Feeding alt=A brown spotted fish swims in shallow water seen from above. The smooth toadfish has strong jaws that readily crush shellfish and crustaceans. It feeds predominantly on benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms in the substrate of the bodies of water in which it forages. Its diet includes molluscs such as black mussels, pipis, white sunset shells (Soletellina alba) and oysters (Crassostrea), crustaceans such as semaphore crabs and shrimp, and brown algae. The proportions of crustaceans to molluscs can vary widely depending on the abundance of food items; hence in a 1999 field study, the soldier crab (Mictyris longicarpus) predominated in Cowan Creek while the black mussel did so in nearby Berowra Creek. Field experiments showed it was a consumer of oysters and the gastropod Bembicium auratum, and had a major impact on their numbers. Because it is a common estuarine fish, it has been used in studies of heavy metal contamination in coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies of contamination in other fish) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements. Lead, cadmium and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken, suggesting dietary intake. The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much arsenic as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and selenium in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water. Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water. Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and gonadal tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and gonadal tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to organochlorine pesticides but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity. Toxicity Notorious for taking bait from fish hooks, the smooth toadfish is an unwanted catch for anglers as its flesh is highly poisonous and unfit for human consumption. Its lack of spines makes it easier to handle than other toadfish when it inflates itself after being caught. Its toxicity had been reported by local aborigines in Sydney to William Dawes in the late 18th century. A man named John Buff was fatally poisoned after catching and eating toadfish in Duck River in 1821 near Parramatta; his case and subsequent coroner's inquest were published in the Sydney Gazette. The smooth toadfish was responsible for the deaths of the wife and two children of Captain Bell of New Town near Hobart in a widely publicised case in March 1831. Colonial surgeon James Scott wrote, An inquest into the deaths took place on 29 March 1831. The family's three servants, one of whom appeared to have been poisoned as well and was ill, were placed in custody separately to stop them communicating with each other while the investigation proceeded. The jury replicated the effects by feeding the fish to (and poisoning) two cats. The jury learnt that the servant, Speed, had caught the 20 or so fish and taken them home to eat. A neighbour called out to him not to eat the fish as they were \\"no good\\", but he took it as a joke. The inquest concluded with a finding of accidental death, with some deliberation over whether Speed should have been charged with manslaughter or even murder after hearing the warning. Warnings about toadfish were subsequently issued. Its toxicity is due to tetrodotoxin, which is concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left where they can eat them.

Gold jacket Corfe rose to prominence in 2002 by donning a gold jacket and holding up a \\"Game Over\\" banner during games when he felt Collingwood had secured victory, usually in the fourth quarter. The jacket came from the Channel Nine wardrobe and had been previously worn by Bernard King and Tommy Hanlon Jr. When Corfe saw Eddie McGuire wear it on The Footy Show, he emailed McGuire to ask if he could use it to celebrate Collingwood victories. McGuire had the jacket drycleaned and handed it over at a Victoria Park training session. Before the 2003 AFL Grand Final, Corfe announced that he was going to discontinue use of the jacket, however after Collingwood's loss, he suggested that the jacket would make a comeback the next season. New jackets were introduced in 2005 and 2010. The last version featured the logo of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria on front and back. In 2010, Corfe said that he would retire the gold jacket \\"if the Pies win the flag.\\" He had the jacket on by the sixth minute of the final quarter of the 2010 AFL Grand Final replay, as Collingwood stormed to an easy win over St Kilda. Following a turbulent 10-year history the gold jacket was officially retiredJoffa's Front Page after the 2010 premiership win. The jacket was auctioned on eBay for $3,900, with all proceeds going to the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria. In 2011, a new version ‚Äì known as the \\"People's Jacket\\" ‚Äì was created by the Epilepsy Foundation and is worn by Collingwood supporters, usually children, after a win. Early life and family Corfe, one of four boys and three girls, came from a working-class family in Melbourne. His mother, June Murphy, suffered from alcoholism and drug addiction. His father, Robert Corfe, who also suffered from alcoholism and drug addiction, drove a truck, delivered mail and had various other \\"bum jobs\\". When he was a young child, Corfe's family moved around various suburbs in Melbourne, escaping debt and financial obligations. By the time he was 14, in the mid 1970s, Corfe had left home and was living at the Allambie Boys Home in East Burwood, where he stayed for about five years. During this time he recalls a \\"lovely couple\\" taking him to Victoria Park, where he saw his first game of football. His six siblings also lived in and out of public homes and foster care throughout their early years due to their parents' chronic instability and poverty. In his early adolescence, Corfe drifted between different jobs and different homes; his living situation alternating between public housing, his unstable family and the streets. He was homeless for four years in his late teenage years, until he got a job at a plastics factory in Hawthorn and was able to escape homelessness. Today, he is single, working and a social advocate. His daughter, Emma, was diagnosed at 13 (2003) with epilepsy and he has since become a vocal advocate for the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria. He likes to read books and spend time with his three grandchildren ‚Äì Simon, Jeffrey and Destiny-Pearl, who are indigenous. He has close connections with the indigenous community at Lake Tyers. He has not had a drink of alcohol since 2000. \\"I never had a problem with it, but I have major problems with people who are intoxicated. They just don't make sense.\\" As well as being a charity fundraiser and a supporter of disadvantaged people, Corfe appears as a guest speaker at sportsmen's nights and social and charity events. Employment Corfe is employed as a welfare worker at the Anchorage Hostel,http://www.melbourne.homeless.org.au/specialised.html a Salvation Army refuge for homeless men. He does night shift from 11 pm to 8.30 am. The hostel \\"houses 57 men, with an average age of about 50. Half have mental health issues or brain injuries, their life administered by the state trustee. Many are alcoholics or drug users. Some choose to be outsiders, some have had that forced upon them.\\" Eddie McGuire says that he is a big fan of Corfe's. \\"He's as rough as hessian undies\\", says McGuire, \\"but he has a tremendous intellect and an amazing capacity for good.\\" Corfe is so well known in Australia that The Australian newspaper used his name in an opinion piece on the National Broadband Network debate. Throughout the 2012 AFL season, Corfe, with Ben Bronx, debuted the Bronxy & Joffa show on YouTube. On the weekly show they would discuss the biggest talking points of the previous round and preview the coming week of Australian Rules football. Charity work Joffa Corfe and Joffre Pearce about to depart Murray Bridge on the final leg of their fundraising ride from Melbourne to Adelaide. Ride to Football Park From 30 July 2011 to 6 August 2011, Joffa Corfe and Joffre Pearce, father of Danyle Pearce, at the time a player with the Port Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League, completed a fundraising bicycle ride from Rockbank, outside of Melbourne, to Football Park in Adelaide.Ride to AAMI - Joffa's Front Page Along the way they met up with local football clubs, and gave and received encouragement. Olympic Gold Medalist Brett Aitken joined the riders on their final leg. The ride raised over $1,300 for the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria's Parent Epilepsy Support Network. 2011 Flood Relief Charity Match During one of the breaks in the NAB Cup three-way match at Docklands Stadium on 12 February 2011, \\"Joffa\\" turned out as a playerCeleb Match, photos for the \\"Collingwood\\" team in a charity fund-raiser against a celebrity \\"Carlton\\" team.

Controversy When Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, tried to rally voters during the 2010 Federal election by calling for a \\"unity ticket\\" of people who hated the Collingwood Football Club, Corfe reacted by saying that she had \\"lost his vote\\". When she was asked to explain her comments, Gillard said that she had no choice but to \\"stick with her footy principles\\". Joffa said, \\"For a Prime Minister to jump on the anti-Collingwood bandwagon, I reckon it‚Äôs a bit poor... We don‚Äôt need that stuff on the national political stage.\\" He added: \\"I have gone to the Greens, she‚Äôs finished.\\" In 2008 Corfe created controversy when photographs of him posing with two rifles in the manner of Melbourne criminal Chopper Read were posted on a Collingwood supporters' internet forum. His actions were criticised by gun control activists but Collingwood's president, Eddie McGuire, defended Corfe's character. After a ban on the use of the term \\"white maggot\\" in reference to umpires was introduced at the Gabba in 2007, Corfe defended the right of supporters to use the term. He compared security at the ground to Gestapo. Although Corfe has been the highest profile member of the Collingwood cheer squad, he has not always had a comfortable relationship with other fans and club staff. In 2003 leaflets criticising his behaviour and including his home address were distributed at a Collingwood match. In round 18 of the 2002 AFL season, in a match between Collingwood and their archrival Carlton, Corfe drew attention to the fact that Carlton were going to finish last that year by waving an oversized wooden spoon. The spoon was initially confiscated, though it was later put on display at the Collingwood club rooms. Collingwood won that game by 108 points.

The petroleum industry in Ohio dates from 1859. Ohio continues to produce significant quantities of oil and gas, having produced more than 1 billion barrels of oil and 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas since 1860. Unconventional resources, primarily in eastern Ohio, are likely to increase production in Ohio. In late 1859, blacksmith William Jeffrey drilled the first well in Ohio specifically intended to produce petroleum. This well is located in Mecca Township, Trumbull County, northeast of Warren. In 1860, similar activity occurred in Macksburg. The Ohio Oil Rush In 1836, gas was encountered when drilling a ten foot water well in the Findlay field. However, it wasn't until 1884, that a gas well was drilled into the Trenton Limestone, after Dr. Charles Oesterlen organized the Findlay Natural Gas Company. Known as the Pioneer Well, it reached the limestone at a depth of 314 feet, and a gas reservoir at a depth of just over 1000 feet. Then in 1886, the Karg well produced a prodigious amount of gas from a depth of 347 feet. Gas was soon discovered at Bowling Green, and oil at Lima in 1885. Oil production climbed year after year, especially after major oil and gas reserves were found in Wood County in northwest Ohio in the 1880s. From Toledo to Lima and into Indiana, the Bowling Green Fault fractured the Trenton Formation limestone, in which hydrocarbons were trapped by overlying rock. In 1891, the likely first overwater drilling operations in the world occurred in Grand Lake, where more than 100 wells were drilled in less than 10 years. Between 1895 and 1903, Ohio was the leading producer of crude oil in the country and thereafter was surpassed by Texas and Oklahoma. The Trenton limestone produced more than 380 million barrels of oil and 2 trillion cubic feet of gas, peaking in 1896 at 23.9 million barrels of oil. Large scale production of oil continued into the 1930s. Due to inefficient early drilling techniques, the oil fields rapidly lost pressure. During this period, many towns in Ohio experienced rapid boom- to-bust cycles. The usefulness of natural gas was not discovered until the 1880s. Up until then, it was considered a ‚Äúnuisance.‚Äù Findlay was ‚Äúthe gas capital of Ohio in late 1885.‚ÄùSpencer, Jeff and Mark Camp. Ohio Oil and Gas. South Carolina: Arcadia, 2008. Print. For example, in Findlay, the first commercial natural gas well began producing in 1884. In 1886, the productive Karg Well (over 10,000,000 cubic feet/day) and other wells resulted in so much gas being flared that Findlay was known as the \\"City of Light\\" and free fuel and light attracted many industries, including glass. By 1888, Findlay was one of the largest glass production centers. The gas was assumed to be \\"inexhaustible\\". By 1890, gas output began to decline. In 1883, Ohio ranked fifth among oil-producing states, behind Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York, and California; its total production of 47,000 barrels of oil that year was less than one percent of the nation's oil output. But Ohio production climbed rapidly, and in 1895 Ohio became America's leading oil-producing state. Ohio oil production peaked in 1896 at 24 million barrels, but Ohio continued as the leading oil state until 1902, when that title was taken by Oklahoma.G.R. Hopkins and A.B Coons, \\"Crude petroleum and petroleum products, in Statistical Appendix to the Minerals Yearbook, 1932-33, US Bureau of Mines, 1934, p.306. Production during mid and late 1900s In northwest Ohio, the production of oil was relatively new. The lack of knowledge about the field of industry led to poor management. In turn, it led to much waste during production, resulting in the end of the period's ‚Äúoil boom.‚Äù Although production significantly dropped with reservoir pressure, oil and gas production continued in Ohio. More than 220,000 wells have been drilled in 67 of Ohio's 88 counties, with 60,000 operating as of 2000. These wells have produced more than 1 billion barrels of oil and 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Much of the gas production has occurred in the sandstone formations of eastern Ohio. Unconventional prospects In 1814, oil was originally marketed as ‚Äúcure-all‚Äù medicine. It was dug out of salt brine wells in southeast Ohio.Talk:Ohio Oil and Gas Production#Expansion of Article Since 2005, the oil and gas industry has developed technologies for producing shale gas and tight oil from low permeability rock. These technologies include horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. This has greatly increased drilling for dry gas from the Marcellus Formation in eastern Ohio, as far south as Washington County, west to Guernsey County, and north to Lake and Ashtabula Counties. Since 2009, this interest has extended to oil and wet gas production from the Utica Shale, with a western boundary line extending from Erie County south to Pickaway County and then southeast to Meigs County on the Ohio River. Large quantities of technically recoverable oil and gas remain in the Trenton and other formations in northwest Ohio and reservoir repressuring and other new technologies may re-invigorate exploration.http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2011/04/25/Experts-explore- possibilities-of-drilling-for-oil-in-NW-Ohio-again.html  See also  * Thorla-McKee Well * Mansfield Natural Gas Field * Berea Sandstone * Pennsylvanian oil rush * Indiana Gas Boom * Texas oil boom * History of the petroleum industry in the United States * Marathon Oil Company  References  Category:History of Ohio Category:Oil booms ","title":"Petroleum industry in Ohio"},{"id":"25875880","text":"Ioan Haydn Price (1883 ‚Äì 7 March 1964) was a Welsh footballer who played at wing half or centre forward for various clubs in the period prior to World War I, before brief spells as a manager with Walsall and Grimsby Town. Playing career Price was born at Maerdy in Glamorgan and after playing for Mardy Corinthians joined Aberdare Athletic in 1902, where he played in the 1904 Welsh Cup Final against Druids, losing narrowly 3‚Äì2. Price was a schoolteacher by profession and was nicknamed \\"the Birmingham schoolmaster\\". In December 1904, Price joined Aston Villa of the English First Division; at this time, Villa had a large playing staff and Price rarely played for the reserves and never played for the first team. Nonetheless, he was selected for his first Welsh Cap while still playing for Villa's third team. His international debut came in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Scotland at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham on 4 March 1907, with the only goal coming from Grenville Morris. Described as a \\"strong sprinter with good distributive ability but faulty shooting\\", Price was an extremely versatile player who could play at wing half, left wing or as a central forward. In 1907, Price moved to Burton United where he played just one League game, in Burton's final match before they lost their League status at the end of the 1906‚Äì07 season. Price remained with Burton United for a year after they were relegated to the Birmingham & District League, before joining fellow Birmingham and District League club Wrexham at the start of the 1908‚Äì09 season. Whilst with Burton, he received his second Welsh cap, in a 1‚Äì0 defeat at the Athletic Ground, Aberdare by Ireland on 11 April 1908. Price spent one season at Wrexham, at the end of which the club won the Welsh Cup, although Price was not a member of the Cup Final eleven. Whilst with Wrexham, he picked up a further three Welsh caps, playing in all Wales' matches in the 1909 British Home Championship. In the summer of 1909, Price returned to the English Second Division with Leeds City but found it hard to force his way into the first team. After just eight Football League appearances, he left Elland Road at the end of the season to return to the Birmingham League with Shrewsbury Town. He moved on to Walsall in 1911, staying there for four years until he retired having become the club's Secretary/Manager in July 1912. During World War One, Price played for Tottenham Hotspur as a guest, making nine appearances, scoring three goals. Management career In 1919, Price became Secretary/Manager of Mid Rhondda, who were based in Tonypandy. Whilst in his first spell as Mid Rhondda's manager, Price helped rescue the career of Jimmy Seed which had stalled during the war; Seed went on to have a long career with Tottenham Hotspur and Sheffield Wednesday as well as making five appearances for England. Other players on Mid Rhondda's books at this time were former England international, Joe Bache and future Wales international, Dai Collier. The club had a successful time in the seven months that Price was manager, winning both the Southern League Division Two and the Welsh League titles. In July 1920, Price became manager at Grimsby Town; he succeeded H.N. Hickson but unlike his predecessor, he was given responsibility for signing new players and for team selection. He quickly returned to his former club, signing five players including Collier and Bache, as well as Jimmy Carmichael, Albert Irvine and Harry Moody. His spell as manager at Blundell Park was short-lived ending in acrimony in November 1920 when he resigned publicly in a letter to the Grimsby Evening Telegraph citing interference by the board in his team selections. Price returned to Mid Rhondda in 1921 where he was hit by more controversy when the club failed to pay its players and other debts and was suspended by the Football Association of Wales. Price died in Portsmouth in March 1964 in his early 80s.
