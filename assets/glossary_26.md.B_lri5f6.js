The Walls of the time of Philip IV remained intact until mid-19th century. Plan of the Walls of Philip IV, with gates and portillos, published in 1847 in the Semanario Pintoresco Espa√±ol. The Walls of Felipe IV () surrounded the city of Madrid between 1625 and 1868. Philip IV ordered their construction to replace the earlier Walls of Philip II and the Walls del Arrabal, which had already been surpassed by the growth of population of Madrid. These were not defensive walls, but essentially served fiscal and surveillance purposes: to control the access of goods to the city, ensure the collection of taxes, and to monitor who went in and out of Madrid. The materials used for construction were brick, mortar and compacted earth. It was one of five walls that surrounded the city of Madrid at different times.\\"Un Madrid con Horarios\\", Secretos de Madrid  Location  The wall began from the current Cuesta de la Vega, continuing via the Rondas of Segovia, Toledo, Valencia and Atocha, plaza del Emperador Carlos V, the avenues of Ciudad de Barcelona and Men√©ndez Pelayo, Calle de Alcal√°, plaza de la Independencia, the streets of Serrano, Jorge Juan, plaza de Col√≥n, G√©nova, Sagasta, Carranza, and then turning left in San Bernardo going by Santa Cruz de Marcenado, Serrano Jover, la Princesa, Ventura Rodr√≠guez, Ferraz, Cuesta de San Vicente, Paseo de la Virgen del Puerto and running alongside the Campo del Moro, until finally linking again with Cuesta de la Vega.  History  During the reign of Philip IV \\"the Great\\" the population of Madrid was three times that of his grandfather‚Äôs reign, and so, in 1590, construction in the city exceeded the Walls of Philip II. As a result, it was necessary to expand the boundaries of Madrid. The idea of new walls started in 1614 and the project was commissioned to Juan G√≥mez de Mora, chief architect of the king and of the City Council. G√≥mez de Mora marked the boundaries of the new walls in a report in 1617 stating that the various sections of the walls should be carried out by master architects. In 1625, Philip IV ordered the construction of other new walls using brick, mortar and earth. These fiscal and surveillance walls served to ensure that all products and foodstuffs that entered the city pay their corresponding taxes in addition to monitoring people entering Madrid. In order to finance its construction a tax on wine was levied. It was built in separate sectors of the city, in each of which a gate of certain importance was placed. Gates and portillos took their names from nearby buildings. The route of the wall was adapted to the configuration of the terrain, which made it very irregular. By 1650 it covered the Mountain del Pr√≠ncipe P√≠o, the Buen Retiro and the Hermitage of Atocha. Its biggest drawback was that it prevented the city‚Äôs growth, thereby keeping its population in overcrowded conditions for over two hundred years. J. Laurent of the Gate of Toledo in 1865. On either side of the gate the walls that still surrounded Madrid at that time can be seen. The new walls were about thirteen kilometers long and enclosed an area of 500 hectares, of which more than 150 belonged to the Buen Retiro Royal Site. This area includes all present-day Centro district plus Buen Retiro Park and the Los Jer√≥nimos neighbourhood. The walls were partially rebuilt in the 18th century and were demolished in 1868 during the Glorious Revolution, as they were considered an Isabelline symbol. The exits from Madrid were flanked by five royal gates, or gates of registration (where taxes were paid): Puerta de Segovia, Puerta de Toledo, Puerta de Atocha, Puerta de Alcal√° and Puerta de Bilbao; and fourteen minor gates or portillos, opened at different dates: Portillo de la Vega, Portillo de las Vistillas, Portillo de Gilim√≥n, Portillo de del Campillo del Mundo Nuevo, Portillo de Embajadores, Portillo de Valencia, Portillo de Campanilla, Portillo de Recoletos, Portillo de Santa B√°rbara, Portillo de Maravillas, Portillo de Santo Domingo, Portillo de del Conde Duque, Portillo de San Bernardino and Portillo de San Vicente. The main gates remained open until 10pm in winter and 11pm in summer. After this time, if necessary, passage was permitted through a checkpoint. The portillos were opened at dawn and closed at sunset, remaining closed overnight. Except for the Puerta de San Vicente ‚Äì built by Sabatini ‚Äì the portillos are not noted for their architecture.  Current status  State of one of the remains Remnants of the walls are visible in two places. One forms part of the retaining wall of the Jardines de Las Vistillas, next to the access staircase, where the Casa de Gil Im√≥n was once located. It is in a ruinous state and some sections have collapsed. The other is connected to the fire station of Ronda de Segovia by the Puerta de Toledo roundabout; it is no more than five meters in length, and carries a commemorative plaque. This section dates back to the 18th-century reconstruction. There is another fragment in the garden area of the Seminario Conciliar, which was demolished without permission by the archbishopric of Madrid. The Directorate General of Heritage of the Community of Madrid ordered the reconstruction of this section, but it was carried out without using the original materials. The interim plan for the Manzanares riverbank, approved by the city council of Madrid, will allow the archbishopric of Madrid to erect five buildings in the Cornisa park, threatening the existing remains of the Walls. These facts have led to the inclusion of the Cornisa park on the Hispania Nostra association's \\"Red List\\" of endangered heritage sites. A new section was found in 2009 during work on Calle de Serrano.

It is found in Asia, Europe, and New Zealand, where it fruits on the ground in mixed forest. Taxonomy The fungus was first described in 1873 by Miles Berkeley and Christopher Edmund Broome as Hydnum thwaitesii, from collections made in Sri Lanka. Paul Christoph Hennings moved it to the now-defunct genus Phaeodon in 1898. Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus transferred it to the genus Sarcodon in 1964, noting \\"To judge from the hyphal structure and the spore characters, this is a true Sarcodon\\". Gordon Herriot Cunningham's species Hydnum carbonarium, described from New Zealand in 1958, is a synonym of S. thwaitesii. The specific epithet thwaitesii honors English botanist and entomologist George Henry Kendrick Thwaites, who was superintendent of the botanical gardens at Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. Maas Geesteranus placed S. thwaitesii in the section Virescentes, along with S. atroviridis and S. conchyliatus. In all of these species, the flesh dries to a deep olive green color. Description The fruit bodies of Sarcodon thwaitesii have flattened, depressed, or rounded caps measuring in diameter. Initially pale pink in color, they change to pale reddish-brown, and ultimately to blackish-brown. The flesh, roughly the same color as the cap, has a bitter taste. The stipe is centrally attached to the cap, and measure long by at the top. The spines on the cap underside are at first purple or purple brown, drying to blackish brown in age, and measure 2‚Äì4 mm.

She was one of the first cheetah cubs to be raised with a puppy companion, who was named Alexa. Throughout her time at the zoo Sarah had many trainers but her favorite was the trainer who raised her, Cathryn Hiker. When it came to completing task Sarah would challenge every trainer except Cathryn and they had a relationship that every trainer would want to have. Even when Sarah was retired she kept on getting constant visits from Cathryn. As a cat ambassador she was always visiting over a thousand schools in the past decade to show awareness for the plight of the cheetah. She was featured in many print and online magazines and even a local zoo commercial. Sarah and Alexa, her puppy companion, were lifelong companions. They were in school shows, summer shows and TV appearances together until Alexa retired then Sarah continued to do this by herself.

Political Intentions  Winnemucca had been working as an advocate, diplomat, and interpreter for the Paiute people, utilizing her ability to speak English, since 1866. Her frequent interactions with and work alongside among the Anglo-Americans empowered her to act as a \\"politically savvy mediator\\" between the two cultures. In the face of marginalization by the U.S. government, violence by white settlers, and stereotypes of \\"savagery\\" that many Anglo-Americans held against her people, Winnemucca's intentions in writing Life Among the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims were candidly political. The purposes were to inform white audiences about the oppression of the Northern Paiutes, raise monetary support for her people, and defuse ethnically divisive stereotypes. The book ends with a supplication to her readers to sign a petition to the U.S. Congress requesting for the return of a piece of land to the Paiutes, uses strong pathos and detailed, emotionally-heavy imagery in describing the difficulties of reservation life, and calls for white audience responsibility with quotes such as \\"Oh my dear good Christian people, how long are you going to stand by and see us suffer at your hands?\\". For these reasons, the reliability of Life Among the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims as a purely autobiographical work has been questioned.

The son of Thomas Bradburn arid Jane Morrow, he was born in Peterborough and was educated there. Bradburn began work as a clerk in the family business; he then became manager for the branch of the business located in Lindsay. In 1877, with a partner, he purchased his father's business. In 1887, he left the partnership, returned to Peterborough and set up a real estate and insurance business. Bradburn was president of the Peterborough Electric Light and Power Company and of the Peterborough Sugar Company. He also served on Peterborough town council, was reeve of Monaghan township and was a member of the Board of Education. In 1874, Bradburn married Catherine Ormond. Bradburn paid for the construction of the Bradburn Opera House; the opera house opened in 1876. It was demolished in 1974 when the Peterborough Square mall was built. His former home, known as Bradburn House was used as an orphanage and later as a nursing home. Then, it was used as a student residence by Trent University.

Fata (, born 1965) is a Lebanese-born former hematologist/oncologist and the admitted mastermind of one of the largest health care frauds in American history. He was the owner of Michigan Hematology-Oncology (MHO), one of the largest cancer practices in Michigan. He was arrested in 2013 on charges of prescribing chemotherapy to patients who were either perfectly healthy or whose condition did not warrant chemotherapy, then submitting $34 million in fraudulent charges to Medicare and private health insurance companies over a period of at least six years. He pleaded guilty in 2014 to charges of health care fraud, conspiring to pay and receive kickbacks, and money laundering. On July 10, 2015, he was sentenced to 45 years in federal prison. Early life and career Fata was born in Lebanon in 1965, to a Melkite Catholic family. After obtaining a medical degree there in 1992, he emigrated to the United States to begin his medical career. He served a residency at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn from 1993 to 1996. From 1996 to 1999, he was a fellow in hematology-oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was an attending physician at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania from 2000 to 2003. He struck out on his own in 2003, opening Michigan Hematology-Oncology (MHO) in Rochester Hills, Michigan. Over the next decade, it grew to seven locations throughout Metro Detroit‚Äîin Rochester Hills, Bloomfield Hills, Clarkston, Sterling Heights, Troy, Lapeer and Oak Park.Sentencing memorandum for Fata submitted by U.S. Attorney for Eastern District of Michigan He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2009. Fata specialized in treating blood cancer. He owned his own lab, pharmacy and radiation treatment facility. At his height, he was treating 17,000 patients at his clinics. He acquired a sterling reputation as one of the best cancer specialists in Metro Detroit. He was known for his aggressive approach, which gave higher doses of chemo drugs more frequently‚Äîa protocol he called \\"European protocol\\". Fata's wife, Samar, helped run the business side of his practice as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of his companies. She moved back to Lebanon after her husband's arrest; they have since divorced. Fraud Concerns about Fata cropped up as early as 2007, when Maggie Dorsey sued Fata for malpractice. She had been diagnosed with cancer in 2004, and seven months of chemo had made it difficult for her to walk. She learned that she did not have cancer. The case was settled out of court in 2009. In 2010, veteran oncology nurse Angela Swantek went to MHO for an interview, but was stunned to see practices that her experience told her were \\"plain wrong\\". She believed that Fata was pumping patients with drugs specifically to bill their insurance for more money‚Äîa classic fraud scenario. She complained to state authorities, but got no response until 2011, when she got a form letter saying that there was no evidence to support an investigation. In 2013, Fata diagnosed 54-year-old Monica Flagg with multiple myeloma‚Äîa condition that required a lifetime of chemo for her to have any chance to survive. On July 1, hours after her first round of chemotherapy, she broke her leg in two places. Fata was on vacation in Lebanon at the time. One of the doctors at MHO, Soe Maunglay, saw her in the hospital that day, and was stunned to see that her readings were completely normal. As he put it, he could tell \\"just by looking at the chart\\" that Flagg's numbers were not consistent with an active cancer patient. The next day, Maunglay went to Fata's clinic and reviewed Flagg's records, and could find nothing in Flagg's test results that could justify a chemo regimen. He later told The Detroit News that myeloma can start with minor changes in blood chemistry‚Äîminor enough that a dishonest doctor can use chemotherapy to avoid detection. He estimated that if another doctor had seen Flagg within two months, she would have appeared to be in remission. He also believed that since Flagg was far healthier on paper than a typical myeloma patient, the insurance payments would continue flowing to Fata for the rest of his life. Maunglay went to see Flagg the following day, and told her she did not have cancer. He further advised her to get her records right away and find another doctor, and that she should never go back to Fata again. Maunglay was already due to leave MHO the following month after catching Fata red-handed lying about the clinic's enrollment in a professional quality program. However, after discovering that a perfectly healthy woman was being treated with chemotherapy, he felt that he needed to stop Fata. Knowing that Flagg's case, even as egregious as it was, would not be enough to shut Fata down, he needed to find more evidence of misconduct. Maunglay investigated MHO's patient records, and found numerous instances of unethical and potentially illegal behavior. For instance, Fata was treating several patients with IVIG, a drug intended to treat patients with specific immune deficiencies, when there was no apparent medical basis for it. Maunglay persuaded a nurse and a nurse practitioner to confront Fata. When Fata agreed to curb the use of IVIG, Maunglay believed that this was further evidence that Fata was a fraud. Later, he told the News that an honest doctor would never cut back on his own protocol solely because of staff and physician objections. Weeks later, the Federal Bureau of Investigation stepped in on a tip from George Karadsheh, who was the office manager for Fata's network of clinics. Karadsheh grew suspicious after clinical staff and other doctors began giving their notice without explanation and leaving the practice. When Karadsheh asked Maunglay why he was leaving, he told him that Fata kept insisting on aggressive chemotherapy regimens, even for patients who didn‚Äôt need it. Karadsheh did not believe Maunglay at first since he was aware of other clinical staff who provided care and oversight. However, Karadsheh recalled that many nurses and others had expressed concerns about Fata's aggressive regimen. Karadsheh then conducted his own investigation and interviewed several staff. The first thing he noticed was that Fata's treatment-to-consultation ratio was different from those of other doctors. Karadsheh went back to Maunglay, who suggested that Karadsheh check on Fata's use of IVIG. Karadsheh asked a nurse and she reported that she discovered that in one week, 38 out of 40 patients did not need or did not qualify for the drug. She took this information to Maunglay, who disclosed it to Karadsheh during his investigation. Karadsheh knew what health care fraud smelled like; he had exposed medical billing fraud at a Detroit area hospital in 1996. He took his findings to the Detroit office of the FBI and sued Fata, MHO and several related entities under the False Claims Act on August 5; he was thus entitled to a significant financial reward. Maunglay said that Karadsheh had done \\"a great service\\" because of his past experience detecting fraud. Fata was arrested the next day for health care fraud. Indictment Fata was originally held on $170,000 bond. However, federal authorities found evidence that Fata and his wife had assets of $9 million not yet seized, and feared that the high liquidity of these assets could make him a high flight risk. They persuaded federal judge Sean Cox to raise his bond to $9 million. He was confined to jail pending trial; had he been released, he would have been confined to his home in Oakland Township and barred from practicing medicine. Federal investigators amassed evidence that Fata had bullied or deceived 553 people into getting chemotherapy treatments they did not need, causing the patients' insurance companies and Medicare to pay $34 million in fraudulent and unnecessary claims. They also found that Fata took kickbacks from two local hospices, and poured Medicare and private insurance proceeds into his own diagnostic testing facility, where he ordered unnecessary tests. On the basis of these findings, Barbara McQuade, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, obtained a series of superseding indictments against Fata. They culminated in a 23-count indictment charging Fata with health care fraud, conspiracy to take and receive kickbacks, money laundering, and unlawfully procuring naturalization. The last charge was added because McQuade contended Fata had concealed the extent of his fraud from immigration authorities when he applied for citizenship. If he had been convicted on all charges, Fata would have faced a maximum of 175 years in prison, plus the prospect of having his naturalization revoked. Guilty plea Facing the prospect of a lifetime in prison and possible deportation to Lebanon, Fata pleaded guilty before federal judge Paul Borman on September 20, 2014. He pleaded guilty to 13 counts of health care fraud, one count of conspiracy to pay and receive kickbacks, and two counts of money laundering. In return, the immigration charges were dropped. Nonetheless, McQuade sought the maximum possible sentence of 175 years in prison. Her office argued that the egregiousness of Fata's crimes far exceeded that of Bernard Madoff, and denounced him as \\"the most egregious fraudster in the history of this country\\". Sentencing Fata's sentencing hearing began on July 3, 2015. At the hearing, dozens of Fata's victims revealed how the unnecessary chemo treatments had harmed them. For example, Robert Sobieray lost nearly all of his teeth after being falsely diagnosed with blood cancer, and still twitched uncontrollably. Patty Hester lost much of her hair after being falsely told she was terminally ill with myelodysplastic syndrome, and the stress of finding out about Fata's deceit gave her high blood pressure. Another patient, \\"C. C.\\", said that due to 177 unnecessary chemo treatments, she had problems with her bladder, bowel and kidneys so serious that she could no longer perform basic tasks. On July 10, 2015, Fata addressed the court for the first time. He said he was \\"horribly ashamed\\" at his behavior, and admitted giving in to a \\"self-destructive\\" quest for power and wealth. Borman was unmoved, and sentenced Fata to 45 years in prison, saying that Fata had committed \\"huge, horrific\\" crimes. The sentence Borman imposed is barely one- fourth of what prosecutors sought, and was deemed insufficient by many of Fata's victims. Nonetheless, at Fata's age, it is very likely that he will die in prison. McQuade publicly thanked Maunglay and Karadsheh for exposing what she described as \\"the most serious fraud case in the history of the country\\". Fata also faces myriad civil suits. Karadsheh announced in January 2016 that he had reached a $1.7 million settlement. Maunglay, who did not file a lawsuit, will not take any financial reward. Fata, Federal Bureau of Prisons inmate number 48860-039, is serving his sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Williamsburg in Salters, South Carolina. His earliest possible release will be December 11, 2051, when he will be 86 years old. Fata requested that his guilty plea be tossed in May 2018. His claim is based on the assertion that he received poor legal advice that resulted in his guilty plea and that he has always maintained his innocence, despite his admission of guilt during his sentencing hearing. He stated in the filing, \\"My guilty pleas were not the result of my actually being guilty. From day one to the present, I have steadfastly maintained my innocence.\\" Other Fata's story appeared in the crime show American Greed in September 2016 as part of season 10, episode 18.

The reserve stretches along the Azas River, and is situated in the Todzhinsky District of Tuva. Topography The reserve covers a dense network of rivers and lakes in the mountain headwaters of what eventually becomes the Yenisei River. The primary river is the Azas River, which flows into Todzha Lake (Todzha is another name for Azas), before flowing out again as the Toora-Khem River. The base rock is Proterozoic and Paleozoic (that is, older than 250 million years) sandstones, limestones and various intrusions. In most of the territory this is covered with recent (Quaternary) moraine and fluvial sediments. Located in the glacially-created Todzha Basin, the reserve itself is mid-level in altitude (850 meters to 2,000 meters), but surrounded on three sides by higher mountains (over 2,600 meters). To the west are the Western Sayan Mountains, and to the north and east are the Eastern Sayan Mountains. In the hilly moraine sections of the basic there are many lakes (30 large, and over 100 small lakes) and sphagnum bogs. Climate and ecoregion Azas is located in the Sayan alpine meadows and tundra ecoregion. Below 2400 meters, this ecoregion is characterized by galacially-carved valleys with an upland mosaic landscape of alpine meadows and stands of upland conifers. The climate of Azas is Subarctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dwc), characterized by long, very cold winters and cool summers. The average daily temperature in January is -28,7 C ¬∞, in July - +14,6 C ¬∞. There are only 52 frost-free days on average, and the average annual precipitation is 343 mm, 60% of which falls in the summer. Flora and fauna Azas lake's birds Forest areas occupy 68% of the reserve, bald mountain tundra and alpine meadows cover 16%, and the remainder is bogs, meadows, grasslands, rivers and lakes. The forests display altitude zoning, with larch-birch below 1100 meters, larch-pine-moss up to 1700 meters, and alpine pine-cedar-large above 1700 meters. The animal life in the reserve has not yet been fully studied, but is typical of the Altai-Sayan mountain country and the base steppe sections. Ecoeducation and access Azas is a protected nature reserve, but ecological tourism is permitted on marked educational routes. The most popular destination is Lake Azas, and there are 30 sites of religious pilgrimage in the territory. Most active tourism beyond hiking is forbidden - no camping, etc. - unless in an official group led by reserve guides and scientists. In the buffer zone around the reserve there are facilities for camping and recreation.

In his writing, he applies the methodology of literary criticism to the Old Testament, particularly its Wisdom Literature (the books of Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Ben Sira and the Wisdom of Solomon). Both Marxism and Deconstruction have influenced his approach. The central point in Penchansky‚Äôs writing is that texts produce meaning through dissonance and conflict, and that sacred texts in particular are a site of such conflict. He is currently a full professor at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota. His most recent research concerns the interpretation of the Qur‚Äôan. He is active in the International Qur‚Äôanic Studies Association, and participated in their conference in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, in 2015.  Early life  Penchansky was born in Brooklyn, New York on December 3, 1951. He earned a B.A. at Queens College, City University of New York in 1974, an MA in biblical languages from the Assemblies of God Theological Seminary in 1980 in and a PhD from Vanderbilt University Graduate School in Hebrew Bible in 1988. His dissertation was Dissonance in Job:The Weight of Literary and Theological Conflict.  Career  In 1980, Penchansky joined the Evangel College as an instructor. He left in 1984 and joined the Western Kentucky University in 1985 as an adjunct professor, where he taught for the next four years. In 1989, he joined the Theology Department of the University of St. Thomas. Penchansky wrote his first book entitled What Rough Beast in 1990. In it, he claimed blasphemy as an appropriate response to human suffering, using the book of Job and the Holocaust as a models. Critics suggested that Penchansky‚Äôs approach ignored the larger context of biblical passages, portraying the Bible as a mass of conflicting theological positions. His subsequent publications have considered the negative sides of God, and the polytheistic underpinnings of ancient Israelite religion. His book Twilight of the Gods: Polytheism in the Hebrew Bible claims to show how certain biblical texts portray a complex interplay of monotheistic and polytheistic ideas. In a review of the book, the Journal of Hebrew Scriptures wrote, that \\"while the author succeeds in drawing attention to important texts and issues, the flaws in the presentation would result in more misunderstanding than clarity for lay readers. He wrote Understanding Wisdom Literature: Conflict and Dissonance in the Hebrew Text in 2013. In a review of Understanding Wisdom Literature in Christian Century, Marti Steussy noted, ‚Äúthe themes of diversity and conflict dominate Penchansky‚Äôs discussion of the Hebrew Bible‚Äôs wisdom books.‚Äù However, some see this as a liability. Katherine Dell in The Journal of Theological Studies wonders if ‚ÄúPenchansky may have overstated this aspect.‚Äù Peter Hatton in Review of Biblical Literature has stated, ‚Äú. . . his determination to focus on conflict and dissonance results in a curious silence about the many beauties of this enigmatic but engaging book. . . ‚Äú He also wondered if Penchansky‚Äôs use of contemporary criteria to evaluate the ancient texts might indicate, ‚Äúthe inappropriateness of the criteria he seeks to apply.‚Äù In Christianity Today, Charles Halton observes, ‚Äúinstead of reconciling the tensions within wisdom literature he revels in them.‚Äù After publishing Understanding Wisdom Literature he turned his attention to the Qur‚Äôan. He has presented papers about the Qur‚Äôan at various academic conferences. He is a member of the Society of Biblical Literature, the International Qur‚Äôanic Studies Association, and the Catholic Biblical Association.  Personal life  He is married to Hend Al-Mansour, an artist from Saudi Arabia.  Bibliography  *Understanding Wisdom Literature : Conflict and Dissonance in the Hebrew Text.

Because Barack Obama was reelected as President, the transition did not take place. The transition plan was the first to occur under the terms of the 2010 Pre-election Presidential Transition Act. The Edward \\"Ted\\" Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 was named in Leavitt's honor and also in honor of the head of the Obama transition team. Planning the transition A draft version of his transition website was visible to the public on a server belonging to the company that designed it. Known internally as \\"The Readiness Project\\", transition planning began in April 2012, several months before the 2012 Republican National Convention. Led by Mike Leavitt, it consisted of a skeleton staff of four until August, when additional employees were retained. The staff eventually grew to almost 300 people. Other senior executives within the project included Robert Zoellick and Al Hubbard. Activities undertaken by the Readiness Project included preparing policy briefings for civil servants at federal agencies, which would be delivered by \\"parachute teams\\" following the election; creating a list of candidates to fill the several hundred political appointments made by the President; coordinating with the Obama administration for the transfer of occupancy of presidential residences, including the White House and the Number One Observatory Circle; liaising with the United States Armed Forces for the assumption of National Command Authority and launch control of nuclear weapons; and developing a post- election communications plan, which reportedly included a 1,000-word victory speech Romney would deliver. On the evening of the election, the Readiness Project's transition website, declaring Romney's victory, was accidentally pushed live, but was quickly taken down again. The site was built by a Utah- based web development company, SolutionStream. In accordance with the Pre- Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010, the project was provided with office space by the General Services Administration (GSA) beginning in September 2012, two months prior to the election. The offices of the Readiness Project were shuttered and completely cleared within three days following Romney's defeat. Total spending by the Readiness Project between its inception and dissolution was $8.9 million, with those costs paid by the U.S. government. =Contingency= The Romney team was reported as having shaken off the fear of appearing presumptuous, a fear that hampered the Obama team and hindered them from making adequate transition preparations. In contrast with the Obama presidential transition, Leavitt communicated directly with White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew, and the two coordinated a plan, putting members of the transition team in charge of various government departments in direct communication with members of the Obama administration. Leavitt described his new style of transition team as \\"essentially a federal government in miniature.\\" Impact The Edward \\"Ted\\" Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 was named in Leavitt's honor and also in honor of the head of the Obama transition team. The organization said, \\"The new law creates a federal overseer for the presidential transition and requires each agency to name a person to manage the process.\\" Leavitt agreed to work on the planning for Donald Trump's presidential transition, even though he had not endorsed Trump. According to The Washington Post, Leavitt is regarded as an \\"evangelist for how to run an effective presidential transition.\\" Leavitt stated that he was lending the Trump team his \\"unique experience\\" because \\"[c]ountries are vulnerable during transitions and I see this as a very--almost obligation--to contribute to the country. This is a very serious thing.\\" =Report by Leavitt= In 2013, Leavitt published a 138-page case study of the Readiness Project entitled Romney Readiness Project 2012: Retrospectives and Lessons Learned. In the foreword, Romney wrote, \\"My campaign was not successful but our Readiness Project team was.\\" See also * Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012 * Presidential transition of Barack Obama * Presidential transition of Donald Trump ReferencesExternal links * Romney Readiness Project: Retrospective & Lessons Learned at Amazon.com * Edward 'Ted' Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015. 5 USC 101 note., United States Congress * Mitt Romney Transition Website Draft Uncovered at HuffPost * Photos: Mitt Romney's website, if he had been elected at Vancouver Sun Romney Category:Mitt Romney 2012 presidential campaign Category:Cancelled events in the United States ","title":"Planned presidential transition of Mitt Romney"},{"id":"49195367","text":"Halwes was a Tasmanian pacer foaled in 1959 and is notable for his win in the 1968 Miracle Mile Pace, an Australian record time trial, and his dramatic late scratching at the 1968 Inter Dominion.

He is the author of Start Small, Stay Small: A Developer's Guide to Launching a Startup, which was published in 2010.http://www.startupbook.net/ Walling is the founder of email marketing software Drip that was acquired in a life- changing exit by Leadpages in July 2016.  Career  In the early 2000s, Walling tried to launch a number of software products that failed. He had his first notable success with DotNetInvoice, an invoicing software application. Subsequently, he launched other small business and formed an online community of software founders called Micropreneurs. In 2010, he started a podcast with Mike Taber, which became one of the most popular startup podcasts in iTunes, called Startups for the Rest of Us. The next year, in June, he co-founded MicroConf, a conference for self-funded startups, which is held twice a year in Las Vegas and Europe. In August 2011, Walling purchased and revamped HitTail, a web-based software as a service product that provides long tail keyword suggestions. Before purchasing HitTail, it had used a freemium business model to market the product. Walling stopped the freemium model and used traditional software marketing to bring in more paying users. He founded Drip, an email marketing tool that allows a user to send emails to their audience based on user behavior, in 2012. Walling has become known as a supporter of self-funding or bootstrapping software companies that turn a profit, instead of raising funding from venture capitalists. Much of his writing focuses on tactics for growing software as a service startups. In 2014, he wrote the foreword to Dan Norris' book, The 7-Day Startup: You Don't Learn Until You Launch. In March, 2015 Walling published one of his best-known essays titled The Stairstep Approach to Bootstrapping where he outlines a potentially safer, more structured approach to bootstrapping a startup by starting with small, simple product ideas and leveraging the revenue and experience earned from them to tackle more ambitious (and typically more financially rewarding) ideas. This approach was the focus of a chapter of the 2015 book The End of Jobs: Money, Meaning and Freedom Without the 9-to-5 by Taylor Pearson. In July 26, 2016, his company, Drip, was acquired by Leadpages for an undisclosed amount. He led the Drip product team, out of Leadpages‚Äô Minneapolis headquarters, until April 2018. In October 2018, Walling announced that he was starting the first startup accelerator designed for bootstrappers, called TinySeed.

Composition Notes on Light has a duration of roughly 28 minutes and is composed in five movements: #Translucent, secret #On fire #Awakening #Eclipse #Heart of Light =Instrumentation= The work is scored for solo cello and an orchestra comprising four flutes (3rd and 4th doubling piccolo and alto flute), two oboes, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons (2nd doubling contrabassoon), four horns, timpani, four percussionists, harp, celesta, piano, and strings. Reception Reviewing a recording of Notes on Light with Saariaho's Orion, Tim Ashley of The Guardian modestly praised the pieces as \\"securely done, though both are soft-centred works that throb and thrum appealingly, but lack the underlying toughness of Saariaho's best music.\\" David Fanning of Gramophone similarly opined that it \\"feels just a fraction long for its material\\". Reviewing a performance of Notes on Light for reduced orchestra, Allan Ulrich of the Financial Times received the work more favorably, writing, \\"...the soloist broods, rejoices, rhapsodises, laments and establishes a formal contour with a pair of recurring intervals. The descriptive movement titles provide a guide through the work. But this is music that appeals as much to the senses as the intellect.\\" Rebecca Wishnia of the San Francisco Classical Voice said it \\"develops this orchestral writing to even greater heights\\" and wrote: References Category:Compositions by Kaija Saariaho Category:2006 compositions Category:Cello concertos Category:Music commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra ","title":"Notes on Light"},{"id":"49195625","text":"Torodora activata is a moth in the family Lecithoceridae.

Later, it was argued that the differences between spiders of Cedicoides and those of other subgenera - notably the presence of a terminal apophysis and the shape of the male pedipalp - were great enough to warrant a new genus. In 2003, it was upgraded from subgenus to genus status by Marusik & Guseinov. Spiders of this genus are rare, and are often missing from spider collections taken from these regions during any time other than their mating season. Species , the World Spider Catalog accepted four species in the genus. =C. maerens= Cedicoides maerens lives in Turkmenistan in the desert foothills of Kopetdagh. It was first described in 1889 by Victor R. Fet from a single female specimen found by Eug√®ne Simon during G.I. Radde's expedition to what was then the Transcaspian Region. It was initially placed in the genus Cedicus. A male was found in the foothills of Nebit Dagh in 1982, but it was not positively identified until 1993. =C. parthus= Cedicoides parthus was first described by Fet in 1993 from a specimen found in Turkmenistan. It is distinguished from similar species by the shape of the tibial palpal apophysis in males, parts of the epiqyne and vulva in females, and the abdominal pattern in both. It is about eight millimeters long. The carapace is about 3.75 millimeters long and brown. Legs are brown and bear a pattern of light and dark stripes on the femur. =C. pavlovskyi= Cedicoides pavlovskyi lives in the deserts and foothills of Tajikistan. It was first described by Spassky in 1941. =C. simoni= Cedicoides simoni lives in the deserts and foothills of Uzbekistan. It was first described by Charitonov in 1946 when it was used as the type species for the subgenus Cedicoides.

He was an exponent of the Mid-century Modern style of ceramics, featuring simple symmetrical forms. His work has been exhibited in venues in the United States including the Smithsonian and internationally including at the Louvre in France.  Biography =Early Years= Harrison Edward McIntosh was born in Vallejo, California to Harrison McIntosh, a ragtime piano player, and Jesusita (n√©e Coronado) McIntosh. McIntosh grew up in Stockton, California, where his father worked for Sperry Flour Company. At the time, the city of Stockton was building the Haggin Museum, which first inspired McIntosh's interest in the arts and architecture. In high school, McIntosh and his younger brother, Robert, took informal painting lessons with Arthur Haddock. Both McIntosh brothers continued to pursue art after high school; Robert as a painter and Harrison as sculptor. Two years after McIntosh graduated in 1933, he became a camp artist at a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Yosemite, while his brother Robert received a scholarship to attend Art Center School, now Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. In 1937, after almost two years as a camp artist with the CCC, McIntosh moved down to Los Angeles and took classes at Art Center for six months. McIntosh began working at the Foundation of Western Art in 1938, where he would work in the mornings as a gallery attendant and assistant. He would also work on commissions for Gustav Gilbert, owner of the arts material store The Louvre, making hand-carved picture frames for his store. At Harrison's suggestion, his parents hired Richard Neutra to build their new home. McIntosh assisted Neutra with the design and building; in the process, he learned design principles and incorporated a workshop space into the garage. These years marked McIntosh's first exposure to many of the famous California painters at the time, including Millard Sheets, as well as influential early ceramicists such as Gertrud and Otto Natzler. = Education = McIntosh attended the 1939 World's Fair in San Francisco where he first saw hand-thrown pottery demonstrations in the Japanese Pavilion. This experience inspired him to take classes in the medium with Glen Lukens at the University of Southern California. After a few classes, McIntosh began to work on a turning wheel meant for carving cast works in his studio, where he would often experiment with layered glazes. These early experimental pieces typically were sold for a few dollars. In 1942, McIntosh married fellow artist Mary Stanfield. The next year, he, his brother, and ceramicist Albert Henry King put together a small gallery space on Sunset Strip called The Californians. With the United States' involvement in World War II, however, these plans came to a halt as he was drafted into the army as a medic in Northern California. During this time, McIntosh's wife became critically ill, and he was discharged to care for her. After six years of marriage, Stanfield died. In 1948, McIntosh used the GI Bill to study ceramics in the MFA program through the Claremont Graduate School directed by Millard Sheets. There, he studied ceramics under Richard Petterson at Scripps College, in addition to attending workshops with Bernard Leach at Mills College, with Sh≈çji Hamada the Japanese ceramicist during his US tour, and with Marguerite Wildenhain at Pond Farm during the summer of 1953. McIntosh met his second wife, Marguerite Loyau, in one of Petterson's classes at Scripps College. Loyau was visiting from France on a Fulbright Fellowship through the Teacher Exchange Program to teach French at Pomona College. They married in 1952 and two years later gave birth to their daughter, Catherine McIntosh. Marguerite became her husband's business manager, often collaborating with him on design projects and organizing exhibitions of his work. During his time at CGU, McIntosh became friends with fellow student and ceramicist Rupert Deese, with whom he opened a studio on Foothill Boulevard in Claremont, California. McIntosh and Deese worked together as business partners and friends for the next 50 years, first in the Foothill Boulevard space from 1950 to 1958, and then in a studio at Padua Hills until 2006. In addition to his lasting relationship with Deese, McIntosh was also close with many other Claremont artists such as Jim Hueter, Karl Benjamin, and Sam Maloof. =Career= For various intervals between 1956 and 1959, McIntosh taught at the Los Angeles Country Art Institute, now the Otis College of Art and Design, where he became friends with fellow teacher Peter Voulkos. Here he met Paul Soldner, John Mason, and Kenneth Price, who, with Voulkos, were translating the budding Abstract Expressionist movement into their work with clay. While he deeply respected their work, McIntosh found that he was not satisfied by working in this direction: \\"I was more interested in working with a medium I enjoyed and making things that other people enjoyed\\". He soon left the teaching position to pursue his studio work full-time. In the first two decades of his career, McIntosh sold his work at various home-furnishing stores such as Bullocks Wilshire, Van Kepple Green in Beverly Hills, Kurt Wagner's in Redondo Beach and Abacus in Pasadena. Although he preferred to work in his studio, McIntosh accepted a number of mass manufacturing jobs throughout his life. McIntosh was hired as an employee at Metlox Manufacturing Company designing giftware prototypes from 1955 to 1956 and at Interpace International Pipe and Ceramics Corporation designing tiles from 1964 to 1966.\\"HM100: A Century through the Life of Harrison McIntosh\\". AMOCA, 2014. Accessed April 1, 2016. From 1970 to 1980, McIntosh and his wife travelled to Japan during the summers to jointly design dinnerware and glassware collections for Mikasa. McIntosh was represented by Louis Newman Galleries in Beverly Hills through the 1980s, where he had a solo show almost every year until the gallery's close in 1992. He was then represented by Santa Monica- based Frank Lloyd Gallery in the 1990s. In 1992, McIntosh developed glaucoma and macular degeneration; nonetheless, the ceramicist continued to work in his studio until 2006, at the age of 91.Seckler, Judy (February 2008). \\"The Timeless Elegance of Harrison McIntosh\\". Ceramics Monthly: 54-57. Accessed April 4, 2016. On January 21, 2016 at the age of 101, McIntosh died. Over his more than 60-year career, McIntosh had 43 solo exhibitions. He is represented in over 40 art collections globally. Style and technique Group of hand- thrown vases, made by McIntosh in 1962. McIntosh style remained consistent throughout his career, inspired by Japanese pottery and aesthetics, as well as European modern design. Although many of his contemporaries were known for creating the large emotional works associated with Abstract Expressionism, McIntosh focused on subtlety and deliberation through the modern, functional forms of vessels. McIntosh was particularly renown for decorating his pots with \\"thin sgrafitto lines or rhythmic brush spots\\" made by placing contrasting slip onto the surface of his works with Japanese brushes and sponges. His often used the mishima technique, a process in which engobe is brushed into thin incised lines in the work. The quality of these brushstrokes and lines, however, changed over the course of his career. While the decoration of his early pieces have a regularity and rhythm, over time they gained dynamism as McIntosh explored line-work that expressed movement. =Abstract sculpture= Throughout his career, McIntosh expressed an interest in ceramic pieces that appeared weightless as if floating in space. His early vases often balanced on a small trimmed foot to create such an effect. In 1968, McIntosh began exploring abstract sculptural forms, the first of which, Blue Egg, was showcased in the 1969 traveling exhibition Objects:USA. His first abstract pieces were an elaboration on his vessel form, where spherical shapes without a base appeared to float above wooden bases. As he continued working on these sculptural pieces, he incorporated chrome-plated steel into his works as bases and angled planes. The placement of these steel walls create a mirrored surface that emphasize the appearance of the ceramic form being suspended in space, much like planets. Later works developed these ideas in subtle ways; McIntosh moved away from ovoid forms and began using more complex shapes while maintaining a reference to cosmic forms.

An American-British-Chinese co-production, it stars Jackie Chan, Pierce Brosnan, Michael McElhatton, Liu Tao, Charlie Murphy, Orla Brady and Katie Leung. The film follows a British-Nung Chinese man who seeks revenge for the death of his daughter. The Foreigner was released in China on 30 September 2017, in the United States on 13 October 2017, distributed by STXfilms, and in the United Kingdom in December 2017 on Netflix. It grossed $145 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, though the against type performances of Chan and Brosnan were praised. Plot Ngoc Minh Quan, a widowed former Vietnam War special operations forces soldier, runs a Chinese restaurant called Happy Peacock in London with his business partner Lam and his teenage daughter Fan. When Fan is killed in a terrorist bombing, he seeks revenge. An Irish republican group calling itself the \\"Authentic IRA\\" claims responsibility. Quan takes to visiting Scotland Yard daily, asking for names of the bombers, but is told by police chief Commander Bromley that his repeated visits are diverting resources away from the investigation. Bromley advises Quan to be patient and warns him against going after the IRA. Undeterred, Quan takes matters into his own hands and next focuses on the Northern Ireland deputy First Minister and Sinn F√©in politician Liam Hennessy, who speaks publicly about his status as a former Provisional IRA leader while condemning the attack. Quan purchases items to make homemade weapons and travels to Belfast, leaving the restaurant under Lam's control. Quan seeks out Hennessy at his office but Hennessy claims to have no knowledge of the bombing or its perpetrators before ejecting him from the premises. Quan does not believe him, and first sets off a homemade bomb in Hennessy's building before leaving an explosive on Hennessy's car as warnings unless he gets the bombers' names. Hennessy tells his men to find Quan and stop him. Hoping to shore-up his career and influential political position, Hennessy tries to identify the culprits with help from his contacts and orders that known IRA weapons dumps be searched for missing explosives, but the Authentic IRA catches on and outwits him. Quan observes Hennessy seeing his mistress, Maggie, and photographs them kissing in a restaurant. Hennessy's men find Quan but he fights them off and escapes. Quan then brings the fight to Hennessy, hiding in the trees outside his farmhouse and attacking it with more explosives. As Hennessy's henchmen attempt to track him in the forest, Quan uses traps to disable them but is shot in the shoulder and flees. Tending to his wounds, Quan recalls his escape from Vietnam in which his first two daughters were kidnapped and killed by pirates. Hennessy also investigates Quan's background and discovers he was a former guerrilla fighter who was recruited by US special forces in Vietnam. After Quan ambushes Hennessy in his house, the latter contacts his nephew Sean Morrison, a former Royal Irish Regiment soldier in the hope that Morrison's tracking skills can be used to stop Quan. Later Hugh McGrath, one of Hennessy's old IRA commanders during The Troubles arrives and asks Hennessy why his weapon dumps are being searched. Hennessy tells Hugh that the semtex used in the bombing came from one of his dumps. McGrath denies knowing anything and claims that everything was in order. McGrath then tells Hennessy that he believes the bombings should continue and tries to persuade Hennessy to think the same. Hennessy refuses, stating that his violent days are over and reveals that he secretly supports bombings, but only of financial targets that do not involve mass casualties. Angry, McGrath berates Hennessy, claiming that politics has made him soft and that he now only cares about his career rather than the IRA's cause. McGrath then leaves, but not before Hennessy threatens him saying if the bombers aren't caught, then he's going after him next. After a second bombing on a double-decker bus, Hennessy negotiates with British politician Katherine Davies and promises the capture of the terrorists in exchange for pardoning of several of his former IRA comrades. Meanwhile, Hennessy receives intel on the bombers and relays the information to Sean and the police. Commander Bromley finds out that Hugh McGrath is the ringleader of the Authentic IRA and notifies Hennessy of the discovery. Hennessy tortures McGrath into giving him the identities of the bombers with Maggie among them, whose real name is Sarah Mackay. Hennessy also discovers that the true mastermind of the recent Authentic IRA attacks is his own wife, Mary, who remains spiteful toward the British for the death of her brother and hates Hennessy for allowing his killers to be sent to prison rather than having them killed. In retaliation for his betrayal and for involving his wife and mistress, Hennessy shoots McGrath. He also learns that Sean leaked information to Mary while having an affair with her. Sean finds Quan's hiding place in the forest. After a knife fight, Quan captures Sean, who names the terrorists and their location in London before Quan lets him go. When Sean returns to the farmhouse, Hennessy admonishes his nephew, orders him to assassinate Mary and then to depart to America and never return. As the police and MI5 prepare to raid the bombers' London hideout, Quan enters the flat disguised as a handyman and kills everyone but Maggie. Quan leaves just before the police storm the apartment and find a severely wounded Maggie. They torture her into disclosing the location of their next bomb, which has been planted in a laptop belonging to a reporter whom Maggie seduced, and is to be detonated on a plane carrying several British dignitaries to an international conference in Rome. With only seconds to spare, British police throw the laptop into an empty jet bridge, where it detonates without casualties. With the threat resolved, Maggie is executed to prevent any \\"loose ends.\\" Hennessy gets a call from Davies, who was scheduled to be on the targeted flight. She tells him that she has learned of his involvement with the bombers, but having helped prevent the last attack, he will be allowed to retain his position as deputy First Minister, albeit under her control. Sean later executes Mary, eliminating the entire Authentic IRA cell as a result. Quan confronts Hennessy with the picture of him kissing Maggie, which is enough to throw public suspicion on Hennessy and his role in the bombings. He forces Hennessy to post the picture on the internet, thus publicly exposing his association with the Authentic IRA and destroying his political career, and returns home, reuniting with his friend Lam. Scotland Yard realizes Quan's role in the events and has him put under surveillance, but Bromley decides not to take any further action as Quan has suffered enough and as a thanks for his assistance. CastProduction On 5 June 2015 it was announced that Jackie Chan would star in the action thriller film The Foreigner, for STX Entertainment, and based on Stephen Leather's novel The Chinaman. Nick Cassavetes initially signed to direct the film, which was adapted from Leather's novel by David Marconi, while Wayne Marc Godfrey was one of the producers.

Co-stars Liu Tao and Chan attended the Shanghai Film Festival on 11 June 2016 to promote the film. Principal photography commenced in January 2016. The filming in London of a scene involving the explosion of a bus on Lambeth Bridge caused some alarm, as people were not aware that it was a stunt. Scenes were shot at the Walters & Cohen designed Regent High School in Camden and on Churton Street in Pimlico on 18 February 2016. Cliff Martinez composed the score. Release The Fyzz Facility produced, and is distributing, The Foreigner, in association with Sparkle Roll Media and Huayi Brothers, while STXfilms distributes it theatrically across the United States of America.

In the United Kingdom it was released on December 2017 on Netflix. A DVD and Blu-ray released in the United States on 9 January 2018 and 23 January in Canada and the rest of the world. =Box office= The Foreigner grossed $34.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $111 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $145.4 million, against a production budget of $35 million. In the United States and Canada, the film opened alongside Happy Death Day, Marshall and Professor Marston and the Wonder Women, and was expected to gross $10‚Äì15 million from 2,555 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $4.8 million on its first day, including $855,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to open to $15.5 million, finishing third at the box office behind Happy Death Day and Blade Runner 2049. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 65% based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 5.99/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Foreigner adheres strictly to action thriller formula, but benefits from committed‚Äîand out of character‚Äîperformances from its talented veteran stars.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported 78% of filmgoers gave it positive score. The film was viewed positively by most critics. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three out of four stars and praised Chan's performance, saying: \\"It's the most dramatic role Chan has ever tackled, and he plays it with coiled intensity and raw emotional power.\\" Clarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter also praised Chan, writing, \\"It's good to see Chan swapping his happy-go-lucky persona for two hours for some gravitas as a tragic rogue with a marked past.\\" John Berra of Screen Daily praised the action sequences, Cliff Martinez‚Äôs score and the direction, stating \\"Campbell's unfussy style works well with Chan‚Äôs choreography. The star‚Äôs willingness to look his 63 years makes the falls look like they really hurt and creates a sense of jeopardy when Quan finds himself outnumbered.\\" He also observed that the film \\"never commits the cinematic sin of suggesting that terrorism is a threat than can be readily dispatched with a few one-liners.\\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky for AV Club described the film as \\"good, lean cut of meat‚Äîin other words, a typical Martin Campbell movie, expeditious and cold- blooded in its cross-cut, cloak-and-dagger plotting and violence.\\" The Chicago Reader also commended the performances of Chan and Brosnan and called The Foreigner a \\"twisty, bracing political thriller, giving Chan room to display his dramatic ability.\\" The Times of India gave a positive review of Campbell's direction and the film's suspense, stating that it can keep viewers \\"engrossed.\\" In more mixed reviews, Peter Debruge of Variety wrote \\"The Foreigner amounts to an above-average but largely by-the-numbers action movie in which Chan does battle with generic thugs and shadowy political forces.\\" Glenn Kenny writing in The New York Times stated Chan \\"doesn‚Äôt deliver the action pizazz here that he used to,\\" criticised the plot as \\"convoluted\\" and felt that the use of the IRA as antagonists was outdated in relation to current events.

Vivian Forbes - The Echoing Valley Forbes was enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers and met Philpot at a training in Aldershot in 1915. He was involved in business in Egypt after the war, and before beginning a more serious relationship with Philpot. Like Philpot, Forbes' work was affected by concern over the rise of fascism in Europe, and he was influenced by the 19th century Aestheticism movement, and painters like Charles Ricketts and Charles Haslewood Shannon. Forbes also composed poetry, all of it dedicated to Philpot and their relationship. Forbes, Philpot, Ricketts and Shannon all had studios at some point in the Lansdown Road building of the Ladbroke Estate. Described as witty and charming, Forbes was also unstable, and his relationship with Philpot was very close. Following Philpot's sudden death on 18 December 1937, Forbes was overcome with grief, and committed suicide using sleeping pills on 23 December after Philpot's funeral.

She has also acted in the critically acclaimed short film, Scribbles on Akka (2000), directed by Madhushree Dutta, which won the IDPA Award, best script award at Shanghai International Film Festival and the National Film Award for Best Anthropological Film. She is a recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award of 1991. The Government of India awarded her the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2008, for her contributions to Manipuri theatre.  Biography  Heisnam Sabitri was born on 5 January 1946 in a Meitei family in the periphery of Mayang Imphal in the northeast Indian state of Manipur. Gouramani Devi, her aunt and a known stage actor, trained Sabitri from a young age and introduced her to theatre as a child artist, the lead role in Nimai Sanyas as 'Nimai' and as 'Queen Chintamani' in Shri Vasta-Chintamani were two of her notable early performances. Her career took a turn with her performance in Layeng Ahanba (first treatment), directed by Heisnam Kanhailal in 1961, and she married Kanhailal the next year; she was also a part of the group led by him who would found Kalakshetra Manipur in 1969. Heisnam Sabitri has made many notable performances on various stages in India and abroad, including Japan and Egypt; 'Ekhoulangbi' in Ekhoulangbi (1970), 'widow mother' in Tamnalai (1972), 'old woman' in Kabui Keioiba (1973), 'mother pebet' in Pebet (1975), 'tribal woman' in Laigi Machasinga (1978), 'Mi' in Memoirs of Africa (1985), 'Thambam' in Migi Sharang (1990) and 'Radha' in Karna (1997) are some of her major productions under Kalakshetra. Her portrayal of Draupadi, in the drama of the same name based on a short story by Mahasweta Devi, made news as the final moments of the play saw her dropping her clothes one by one and stripping naked on stage. After its first two stagings on 14 April and 20 April in the year 2000, the performance evoked public protest for deemed obscenity, but is known to have inspired a group of twelve women to stage a protest by parading naked in front of Army personnel in 2004 who were alleged to have raped and killed a woman. The role of a young boy, enacted by her while she was in her sixties, in Dakghor, a drama based on one of Rabindranath Tagore's short stories, was another performance which drew critical acclaim. Sabitri, a former government nominated member of the Sangeet Natak Akademi, also acted in Mahadevi Akka, a short film of 60 minutes duration directed by Madhusree Dutta in 1999, where she acted as the title character and the film won the National Film Award for the best anthropological film as well as IDPA Award of the Indian Documentary Producers' Association and the award for the best screenplay at the Shanghai International Film Festival. Nemi Chandra Jain, a renowned theatre personality, has documented the career of Sabitri Heisnam in his book, From the Wings, Notes on Indian Theatre, which is a prescribed academic text at Christ University. Natarang Pratishthan, a knowledge repository of Indian theatre, has compiled around 100 documents related to her performances, which include books, posters, news reports and articles, photographs and video clippings.  Awards and honours  Manipur State Kala Akademi awarded Sabitri their annual award for acting in 1988 and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award reached her in 1991. The same year, she received the Critics' Award for best actor at the III Cairo International Festival for Contemporary and Experimental Theatre for her performance in Migi Sharang (Human Cage). Her performance in the 2001 production, Death of Two Women earned her the Fellowship of Majlis Culture, Mumbai, an award-winning platform for interdisciplinary arts, which commented on her technique of breathing and its influence on performance. In 2002, Nandikar, a Kolkata-based theatre group and the Department of Child and Woman Development, Government of India awarded her the Nandikar Award and she received the Natya Ratna title in 2006. The Government of India awarded her the civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 2008.

He fought against the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh War of Liberation. Syed Kamel Bakht died at the age of 17 during the war in the month of November by a group of Mujib Bahini personnel. His elder brother Syed Didar Bakth later became the Minister of Information and Cultural Affairs of Bangladesh. Early life Syed Kamel Bakht was born in 1954 at Tentulia village of Tala Upazila which is now under Satkhira District of present Bangladesh. He was the youngest of all the sons of his father Syed Sharfuddin Hashemy. He completed his primary education in a local school. After passing the matriculation examination he joined Khulna BL College before the war broke out in 1971. Political affiliation Syed Kamel Bakht was influenced by his elder brother Syed Deedar Bakht who was a leader of Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries of East Bengal. He also joined the group before the Liberation War of Bangladesh and soon became an organizer with his talent. When the war broke out in the then East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries of East Bengal was converted into the Bangladesh National Liberation Struggle Coordination Committee. Role in Liberation War Syed Kamel Bakht, along with his brother Syed Deedar Bakht formed their own guerrilla force with the members of their party and the local youths in early May 1971. Their force was known as ‚ÄúGana Mukti Bahini‚Äù (People's Liberation Force). In the middle of June, his force captured the Tala Upazila police station on their own and collected the arms and ammunition. They had raised the flag of independent Bangladesh in the compound of the police station and declared the area as liberated. Later on, with the help of the freedom fighters of Bangladesh Force, he led an attack on the Kapilmuni police station in the next month. He had led a series of battle against the Pakistan Army on the bank of Salta River, Patkelghata, and Sagardari areas. Syed Kamel Bakht gained enormous success in the battles forcing the Pakistan Army to retreat. Soon after liberating the areas he established an administration which was led by communist ideology. He accumulated many lands from the local landlords and distributed those among the peasants. He also took an attempt to introduce new systems regarding land ownership, in other words land-reform or agrarian reforms. He was determined to punish the collaborators, Razakars as well. His followers used to slaughter the prominent Razakars of the liberated areas and hang their bodies in trees. Death In August, a section of Mujib Bahini men entered into his area and befriended with the brothers. They used to live with them in their den. But after some days they went back to India. In mid October, they came back with more people with them. In November, Syed Kamel Bakht left for Kalkata to meet his party men and held meetings with central leader of his party Haider Akbar Khan Rano. He described his struggle during the war and had asked the central leadership to visit his area. The leadership was keen to visit his area and planned to go there soon. When he returned from Kalkata to his area, he was killed with his henchman Shankar in his own den by Mujib Bahini men. They shot them from a very close distance with automatic rifles and ensured their death. His brother, Syed Deedar Bakht survived the attack as he was not his brother that night. But the Mujib Bahini men launched a fresh drive to hunt him down. This hunt continued even after the liberation war.

Description The Tahoe sucker is a large, long fish with a tapering head. It can grow up to 24 inches in larger lakes. Its rather large suckermouth is located on the bottom of the head. The caudal fin is moderately forked. There are 83 to 87 scales in the lateral line. They are very dark above, lighter below, with dusky fins. Breeding males display a bright red lateral line. Distribution and habitat These fish are native to the Lahontan Basin of southeastern Oregon, Nevada, and northeastern California, of which it is one of the most common fishes. It has also been introduced into the upper Sacramento River system. The total adult population is believed to number over 100,000, and it is considered to be common or abundant in its various habitats. They are mainly found in large lakes and reservoirs, but can also be found in ponds in lower reaches of streams. Adults occupy moderate depths. Young are found in shallow waters or tributary streams. Diet habits Tahoe suckers are largely herbivorous, but have also been found to feed on insects and mirco-crustaceans. Reproduction Tahoe suckers reach sexual maturity between 2 and 5 years of age, with males tending to mature earlier. Differences in age at which maturity is reached exist between various populations. Those in Pyramid Lake mature several years earlier than those in Lake Tahoe. Fecundity is believed to be related to size, with age being of secondary influence. Nuptial tubercles begin appear on both sexes prior to the onset of the mating season, although they are rare on females. On males they form distinct rows on the anal and caudal fins. The Tahoe sucker prefers to spawn over rock and gravel substrates. After scattering her eggs into the gravel bed, the female shakes them down into the substrate. Simultaneously, the attendant males release their sperm in order to fertilize the released eggs. Importance to humans Historically, the Tahoe sucker was largely ignored by the indigenous Paiute peoples, who preferred Cutthroat trout and Cui-ui sucker. Despite the fish's size and good taste, it continues to have no economic significance.

The song, a sequel to Macklemore's solo song \\"White Privilege\\" from his first album The Language of My World (2005), discusses white privilege and the social movement associated with Black Lives Matter. According to the duo, \\"this song is the outcome of an ongoing dialogue with musicians, activists, and teachers within our community in Seattle and beyond. Their work and engagement was essential to the creative process.\\" The song's lyrics span around nine minutes and 1,300 words. One of the project's collaborators is Chicago singer Jamila Woods, whose voice is featured on the track. \\"White Privilege II\\" was released as promotional single on January 22, 2016. Themes The song comments on the impunity with which white police in the United States are free to take black lives, with \\"a shield, a gun with gloves and hands that gives an alibi.\\" Arguing his success is \\"the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson,\\" a police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, Macklemore raps that, \\"one thing the American dream fails to mention, is that I was many steps ahead to begin with\\". The song also samples a line from a woman who dismisses the concept of white privilege, \\"you're saying that I have an advantage, why? Because I'm white? [scoffs and laughs] What? No.\\" Song structure Forrest Wickman, writing for Slate, analyzes the song as having multiple sections that often bear a different critical viewpoint (narrator) from Macklemore himself. \\"The biggest mistake early reactions to the song have made, pretty consistently, is assuming that everything Macklemore raps is in his own voice.\\" The first verse in his own voice, where Macklemore raps about his struggle to find his place in the protest movement, conscious that his commercial success in hip-hop is at least partially a product of white privilege. In the second verse, according to Wickman, the song \\"zooms out to give a larger perspective,\\" with Macklemore first delivering the case against himself, in the voice of his critics. He then turns his self-consciousness about cultural appropriation to other white performers, rapping, \\"we take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?\\" He names the performers Miley Cyrus, Iggy Azalea, and Elvis Presley as having \\"exploited and stolen the music, the moment / the magic, the passion, the fashion you toyed with / the culture was never yours to make better.\\" He seems to put especial attention on Iggy Azalea, rapping, \\"fake and so plastic, you've heisted the magic / you've taken the drums and the accent you rapped in / you're branded hip-hop; it's so fascist and backwards / That Grandmaster Flash'd go slap it\\". Wickman writes that the \\"many, many headlines\\" that construe this verse as being a \\"callout\\" or a \\"slam\\" are missing \\"the larger point, which is that his real target here is himself.\\" He observes that the line supposedly accusing Azalea of \\"heisting the magic,\\" is really a self- criticism: The Heist was Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' debut album. Meera Jagannathan of the New York Daily News noted that Iggy Azalea was blindsided, tweeting a fan, \\"he shouldn't have spent the last three years having friendly convos and taking pictures together at events, etc. if those were his feelings.\\" Wickman argues Iggy Azalea seems to have \\"missed the point,\\" echoing a protest chant sampled in the song, \\"It's not about you!\\" The third verse by Wickman's same analysis, \\"whips the camera around, to turn it on Macklemore's more ignorant fans,\\" taking on the voice of a white mom \\"who asks to take a selfie with Macklemore, praising him at the expense of the rest of hip-hop, which she backhandedly slanders.\\" In this verse, as Black Lives Matter protesters chant outside, the \\"mom\\" tells Macklemore: > You're the only hip hop I let my kids listen to, because you get it. All > that negative stuff isn't cool. Like all the guns and the drugs, the bitches > and hoes, and the gangs and the thugs, even the protest outside, so sad and > so dumb - if the cop pulls you over, it's your fault if you run! Wickman notes the \\"irony\\" with which many fans initially seemed to endorse the mom's comments literally on song interpretation site Genius, with such annotations as, \\"Macklemore makes positive hip-hop and doesn't romanticize bad behavior like most rappers do.\\" The section concludes with samples from white critics of the Black Lives Matter movement, skeptical of the concept of white privilege and believing that they live in a post-racial America. The fourth verse resumes in with Macklemore as narrator, followed by quotes from Black Lives Matter supporters, including a critique of the hashtag All Lives Matter using a metaphor: \\"if there's a subdivision and a house is on fire...the fire department wouldn't show up and put water on all the houses because all houses matter, they would show up and turn on their water on the house that was burning because that's the house that needs help the most.\\" The song then ends with Jamila Woods singing, \\"Your silence is a luxury. Hip-hop is not a luxury. What I got for me, it is for me? What we made, we made to set us free.\\" Woods' line is a reference to black feminist poet Audre Lorde's essay \\"Poetry Is Not a Luxury.\\" Critical reception Spencer Kornhaber, a reviewer for The Atlantic, called the song \\"both a statement‚Äîdon't just be aware of racism, speak up about it‚Äîand a demonstration...Macklemore is practicing what he preaches, as he preaches it. He also spotlights the voices of actual black activists. Who could attack him for that? I can't. This is a brave song.\\" However, he also criticizes the song for not using enough subtle artistry to convey his message, \\"forgoing metaphor or ambiguity or impressionism.\\" In his review, Wickman said that \\"White Privilege II\\" is not \\"a great song, but as a think piece it's not terrible...the best thing Macklemore does is giving Black Lives Matter protesters (along with up-and-coming singer Jamila Woods) the last word.\\" Kris Ex of Pitchfork Media called the song a \\"mess\\", saying that it's \\"too much to work as hit and not enough to work as a piece of agitprop.\\" Ex also noted two types of critiques about the song on social media: critiques making references to white savior syndrome, and critiques asserting that Macklemore's widespread recognition for the song was a type of recognition that rappers of color rapping about the same topic have received comparably little attention for, an ironic example of white privilege. Gyasi Ross, a Native American rapper, lawyer, activist, and author, responded to Macklemore's song by releasing a track called \\"White Privilege 3\\", in which he criticized the song for ostensibly critiquing white privilege while simultaneously not letting minority artists speak. Ross commented, \\"You're trying to help, but honestly you're not. We can speak for ourselves. Pass the mic.\\"http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/02/06/gyasi-ross-schools- mackelmore-white-privilege-white-guilt-and-role-white-allies-163328 Chart performance On the first day of its release on January 22, \\"White Privilege II\\" reached the #1 position on Billboard + Twitter Trending 140, a chart which ranks songs by how often they are mentioned on Twitter.

Gregory became the third Westerner to be hanged under Malaysia's tough anti- drugs laws. His hanging was carried out three years after the Barlow and Chambers execution. Some reports described him as being the first Briton to be hanged under Malaysia's drugs laws, but Kevin Barlow had joint Australian‚ÄìBritish nationality. Controversy surrounded Gregory's case due to evidence of his mental defect since childhood. Background A painter and decorator, Derrick Gregory was mentally subnormal as a result of childhood illness. Having spent much of his youth in special schools, it was reported that Gregory suffered from some form of brain damage and acted \\"like a robot\\". He had a previous criminal conviction for the attempted theft of a train from Charing Cross station, London. Gregory was arrested on 7 October 1982 at an airport in Penang with over a pound of heroin found in his boots and clothes. At the trial, the court in Penang was told Gregory had 14 packets of the drug in his boots and four packets in his underwear. He was attempting to board a plane for Singapore en route to Los Angeles when he was arrested. In December 1986, the British television station Channel Four broadcast a documentary on the case entitled 'No Man Wants to Die' as part of its 20/20 vision series. It was produced by the journalist Andrew Drummond. As part of the programme, a British-based psychiatrist was flown out to Malaysia to examine Gregory. Drummond said that the examination revealed that Gregory had an enlarged brain cavity and had done since he was about four years old. Gregory contested in court that he was instructed by former car salesman Paul Dye, whom he had known for several years and owed ¬£1,000 to, to meet contacts of his in Penang. Gregory stated that he believed he was sent there to help smuggle car parts and diamonds, and that he had never been involved with drugs before and did not know what heroin looked like prior to the day of his arrest. Gregory testified that was forced to smuggle the drugs after death threats from two men he met in Penang, who were members of a drug syndicate. Dye was serving a 28-year prison sentence in England for his part in a drug smuggling operation which saw him branded as \\"devious, greedy and utterly unscrupulous\\" by Judge James Rant. Trial Gregory was defended by Rasiah Rajasingham, who argued that expert evidence from psychiatrists who had examined Gregory proved that the defendant suffered from a serious personality disorder. He said experts had shown that Gregory was a vulnerable person and easily influenced. However, the judge, Mohamed Dzaiddin Abdullah, rejected this and sentenced him to death. The judge said that it was his \\"finding that you merely suffer from a personality disorder characterized by your immaturity and anti-social behavior,\\" he said, dismissing defence arguments that the Briton was mentally too unstable to be fully responsible for his actions. =Appeals for clemency= Despite her personal support for capital punishment, UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appealed to the Malaysia government to commute the sentence, to no avail. Gregory's local MP Barney Hayhoe acknowledged that drug trafficking was an evil trade, but the particular circumstances merited a more compassionate and merciful treatment. However, Hayhoe's colleague Terry Dicks said he would be writing to the Malaysian government congratulating it on its approach. = Execution = Gregory was executed by hanging on 21 July 1989 at Pudu Prison. Family Gregory married Carole Cunnington in Hounslow in 1980, with whom he had a daughter, Tara, the same year. They were separated, with Gregory not having seen his daughter (who was 8 at the time of his death) since she was an infant. It was reported that in the hours before his execution, Gregory clutched a photo of his daughter.\\"Malaysia Hangs Drug Trafficker : First Briton to Be Executed Under Stringent Law Spent Last Hours Clutching Photo of Daughter\\" 20 July 1989, Retrieved 23 January 2015 Whilst in prison, he had received visits from his parents, Kenneth and Mary Gregory and also his brother Paul.

Early career Seku≈Ça graduated from the Silesian University of Technology in 1979, where he also undertook postgraduate studies at the university's Faculty of Organization and Management. Following his graduation, Seku≈Ça was employed between 1980 and 1994 at the Institute for Chemical Processing of Coal in Zabrze, working as a manager of the institution as well as serving on its scientific council. Following the transition to democracy, Seku≈Ça was elected to the Zabrze City Council in 1990, and between 1994 and 1998, was elected as deputy mayor of the city. He was elected to the Sejm during the 1997 parliamentary election as a member of Solidarity Electoral Action, representing the Katowice constituency. While in parliament, he acted as the chairman of the Public Finance Committee and vice-chairman of the Committee on Local Government and Regional Policy. Sejm In 2001, Seku≈Ça was appointed as president of the Supreme Audit Office by the Solidarity Electoral Action and Freedom Union majority in the Sejm. He presided over the office until 2007, when he was again reelected to parliament, now as a Civic Platform candidate. In 2009, Seku≈Ça was confirmed as a member of the Sejm's special committee on investigating accusations of illicit lobbying connections between the gambling industry and members of the cabinet under Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Seku≈Ça gained controversial notoriety after declaring in 2010 there was no evidence of illegal lobbying from cabinet officials, prompting members of the opposition also serving in the same committee to declare Seku≈Ça's final report as a \\"corpse which the Law and Justice and the Democratic Left Alliance MPs tried to resuscitate with amendments.\\" The SLD's Bartosz Ar≈Çukowicz heavily criticized the report prepared by Seku≈Ça in parliament, saying, \\"I get the impression that you‚Äôre behaving like Howard Webb, you see fouls that aren‚Äôt there, goals that aren‚Äôt there and ignore the ones that are.\\" Marshal of Silesia Seku≈Ça was appointed by the government as the Undersecretary of State for Finances in 2011. In 2013, he was elected as the sixth Marshal of Silesian Voivodeship by the Silesian Regional Assembly, replacing embattled Marshal Adam Matusiewicz. Following the election of Seku≈Ça, the Silesian Autonomy Movement pulled out of the Civic Platform and Polish People's Party coalition in the executive board after the dismissal of its representative. As marshal, Seku≈Ça successfully advocated the Polish Football Association to choose Silesian Stadium as a candidate for the UEFA Euro 2020 championship. Seku≈Ça also supported finishing construction efforts for the new Silesian Museum in Katowice. During his marshalship, Seku≈Ça was commonly found commenting on the neatness of dress and organization of provincial government officials, prompting pro-cycling groups to accuse the marshal of not approving bureaucrats commuting to work by bicycle. Seku≈Ça also was an advocate for protecting children from the effects of the War in Donbass in eastern Ukraine, noting the strong connections Silesians had with the Donbas region. In September 2014, Seku≈Ça announced his resignation as marshal prior to that year's local elections. He was replaced by Wojciech Sa≈Çuga.

The current buildings were completed in 1778 and was listed in the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 17 July 1918. The manor and estate is situated in the district of H√∏jbjerg, 10 kilometers south of the city centre of Aarhus. Administratively it belongs to the M√•rslet Parish and is today owned by Moesg√•rd Museum. The museum cooperates with the School of Culture and Society from Aarhus University on the subjects of history, archaeology, anthropology and oriental studies with most teaching and lectures being held in the manor buildings. In 2013 the university took over the buildings when a new museum building was completed and most activities related to the museum moved there.  History  The courtyard The original Moesg√•rd and its owners can be traced back to the late 14th century but the area was likely farmed much earlier. The site of the current manor is believed to be different from the original farm which was likely moved and rebuilt after it burned down during wars with Sweden in the mid-17th century. In the mid 19th century traces of a courtyard was found about a kilometer south-west from the current manor and it is believed this is the location of the original farm. The name \\"Moesg√•rd\\" can be literally translated to \\"bog farm\\" which hints at a bog in the area which is consistent with archaeological evidence showing signs of wetlands in that area. In 1660 Mogens Friis owned Moesg√•rd along with the manors √òstergaard and Skrumstrup in his large land holdings south of Aarhus. In 1662 he was granted new lands north of the city as compensation for losses incurred during the Dano-Swedish War of 1658‚Äì1660 and he established the county of Frijsenborg. Mogens Friis sold his manors south of the city to Gabriel Marselis who had been granted land holdings in the area by the crown in payment for war debts. Gabriel Marselis rebuilt the newly burnt Moesg√•rd where it stands today. Upon his death in 1673 his land holdings were split between his four sons and his son Vilhelm Marselis inherited the manors Skrumstrup and Moesgaard. Vilhelm Marselis had a new barony established at Skrumstrup Manor which was renamed Vilhelmsborg while he assumed the new family-name Gyldenkrone (). Moesg√•rd became an allodial title to the new barony but remained in the Marselis family until the early 19th century. The current main building was constructed in 1780‚Äì84 by Christian Frederik Gyldenkrone but the manor was suffering economically and his son Frederik Christian Gyldenkrone became the last owner as the state assumed ownership of the manor in 1822. In 1838 Torkild Dahl bought the manor and it remained in the Dahl family until the mid-20th century. Thorkild Dahl was politically active as a member of the Folketing and was interested in history and classical studies. He compiled a large library of books and worked to establish a museum of history in Aarhus. In 1960 √Örhus County bought the manor from the estate of Torkild Dahl's daughter with the intention to redevelop the lands for public use. The lands were turned into recreational areas of forests and beaches while some of the agricultural buildings were turned into a museum from designs by C.F. M√∏ller. In 2013 the anthropological and archealogical department of Aarhus University took over the buildings as a new museum building north-west of the manor was completed in 2014.  Architecture  The manor is designed around a large courtyard, the historicist main building facing west with two curved wings extending to the sides to form the east boundary of the courtyard. On each side of the court yard stands the agricultural buildings from the 1800s symmetrically enclosing the court yard. East of the main building lies a large garden laid out in romantic style with watercourses, bridges and stone levees. Moesg√•rd is accessed by a long road lined with poplars which was established in the 1800s when the road from Aarhus to Odder was created.

Unions in Bradford and Stockport later joined, and in 1879 the Bradford and Manchester unions took the initiative in establishing a new, centralised union. This was the Amalgamated Society of Lithographic Printers and Auxiliaries, based in Manchester. The union initially had about 500 members, but it grew rapidly under the leadership of George Davy Kelley, setting up its own offices in Manchester. The Manchester branch ran the union, with it electing the entire executive until 1914. Membership grew to about 3,500 by 1900, and reached 5,168 in 1915. In 1930, it was further boosted when the Litho Music Printers merged into the ASLP. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a boom in lithographic printing, and although it led membership to increase to 11,000, the union worried that it would lose control of the trade. As a result, in 1969, it merged into the National Graphical Association. General Secretaries :1879: George Davy Kelley :1912: Thomas Sproat :1931: F. F. Boaler :1937: R. T.

He started all three of their matches in Pool B of the competition and was also the main kicker for South Africa throughout the competition. He kicked three conversions in a 33‚Äì5 win against hosts Italy in the opening match, three penalties and two conversions in a 40‚Äì8 win against Samoa and two penalties and four conversions in their final match against Australia, also scoring a try in the 55th minute of their 46‚Äì13 win. The results meant that South Africa finished top of Pool B to qualify for the semi-finals with the best record in the pool stage of all the teams in the competition. Thomson also started their semi-final match against England, kicking two conversions and two penalties, but couldn't prevent them losing the match 20‚Äì28 to be eliminated from the competition by England for the second year in succession. He started their third-place play-off match against France, with his four conversions and one penalty helping South Africa to a 31‚Äì18 win to win the bronze medal. He ended the competition as the top scorer in the tournament, with 59 points. He returned to domestic action in July 2015 to play for the side in the 2015 Under-21 Provincial Championship Group A. He started six of his side's twelve matches during the regular season of the competition, helping them finish top of the log after winning ten of their matches. He also started in their semi- final match, kicking five conversions and a penalty in a 43‚Äì20 victory over the , and the final, in which he scored a try and kicked four penalties and four conversions ‚Äì with a personal points tally of 25 points that also won him the Man of the Match award ‚Äì as Western Province beat 52‚Äì17 to win the competition. In 2016, he was named as a member of Super Rugby team the ' training squad that prepared for the 2016 Super Rugby season. =Glasgow Warriors= In February 2017, Thomson joined Scottish Pro12 club Glasgow Warriors on a two-month loan deal. He made his Pro 12 debut at fullback in their Round 15 match against Ulster, scoring a try and one conversion in a 17‚Äì37 defeat. He started their next match against Ospreys at fly-half, scoring five points with the boot, and came on as a replacement in a 47‚Äì17 win over Newport Gwent Dragons. He also featured for Stirling County in the Scottish Premiership Division One. On 4 July 2017 it was announced that Thomson would return to the Warriors, after his successful loan period at the end of the 2016-17 season. The fly-half secured a permanent two-year deal starting for the 2017‚Äì18 season. Thomson was drafted to Ayr in the Scottish Premiership for the 2017‚Äì18 season.http://www.glasgowwarriors.org/news/17/08/28/warriors-find- out-pro-draft-destinations Thomson has been drafted to Stirling County in the Scottish Premiership for the 2018‚Äì19 season.

It was erected between 1170 and 1200 in Romanesque style to serve the town's council and jurisdiction. It is the oldest extant church in Dortmund's inner city. Around 1350, a choir in Gothic architecture was built. It served as a model for the Reinoldikirche, which was built opposite of the road.

The central panel of the Berswordt-Altar dating from 1397 depicts the Swoon of the Virgin, an imagery which gradually disappeared from paintings of the Crucifixion after Molanus and other theologians of the Counter-Reformation condemned its use.Jones, Tom Devonshire; Murray, Linda; Murray, Peter (2013). The Oxford Dictionary of Christian Art and Architecture, p. 589. Oxford University Press. The Marienaltar now contains only fragments of von Soest's original masterpiece. In 1720 a new reredos was installed, and workmen took hammers and saws to the paintings to make them fit into the new frames, losing over half of the large central panel and a quarter of each of the two side panels.Parent, Thomas (2000).

Since the Reformation, it has been a Lutheran parish church of St. Marien. The church was almost completely destroyed by bombs in World War II. However, both the Marienaltar and the Berswordtaltar had been evacuated to the Cappenberg Castle at the outset of the war and thus survived.Corley, Brigitte (1996).

The surviving records on the internal history and rulers of the Emirate of Crete are very fragmentary. Shu'ayb was the son of the conqueror of Crete and founder of the Emirate of Crete, Abu Hafs Umar. Following the studies of George C.

Shu'ayb is also commonly identified with the \\"Saet\\" or \\"Sa√Øpes\\" of the Byzantine chroniclers, Theophanes Continuatus, John Skylitzes, and Genesios. The Byzantine chroniclers report that in c. 872/3, he sent the renegade Photios to raid the Byzantine Empire, leading to the two heavy defeats of the Cretans at Kardia and the Gulf of Corinth at the hands of the Byzantine admiral Niketas Ooryphas. These Byzantine victories apparently led to a temporary truce, and it appears that Shu'ayb was obliged to pay tribute to Byzantium for about a decade.

Rising at the outlet of Cedar Lake just south of Bristol, it courses roughly 11 miles through Wolcott and Waterbury before emptying into the Naugatuck River.  Indigenous history  Prior to settlement by the Connecticut Colony, the broad region encompassing the Mad River was a hunting ground frequented by native Algonquian people of the Mattabesec and Tunxis tribes. The territory was known to these inhabitants as \\"Mattatuckoke\\", believed to translate to \\"place without trees\\", and it correlated roughly to what is today referred to as the Central Naugatuck Valley. These lands were purchased and settled by individuals from the Connecticut Colony during the 1670s and 1680s.  Colonial and industrial history  An old industrial building in Waterbury. Prior to the industrialization of the Naugatuck Valley, local mills harnessed the waters of the Mad River to produce goods such as flour, cider and saw timber. The river's economic importance grew enormously as brass manufacturing rose to prominence in the region in the mid-1800s. Several large factories in Waterbury relied upon the Mad River to animate heavy machinery, even though the river's modest watershed was prone to yield insufficient waterflow during dry spells. Consequently, the Mad River and a few of its tributaries were impounded upstream in rural Wolcott, creating a system of reservoirs which could be used to supplement reduced waterflow during seasonal droughts. By the late 19th-century, the lower stretches of the Mad River were known to be tremendously polluted by industrial operations. Factory waste, as well as sewage produced by throngs of factory workers, was discharged directly into the river. One observer of the Mad River in 1887 noted that water downstream of Scovill Manufacturing Company, one of the foremost brass producers in Waterbury, \\"showed extreme contamination; it was of a dark turbid color, with a strong odor and was covered with iridescent films of oily and greasy matters\\". Strengthened environmental regulations in the 1970s forbade the release of toxic chemicals into both Mad River and the nearby Naugatuck River and tightened restrictions on the pollutants billowing from the factory smokestacks. Significant industrial pressure on the Mad River ceased by the 1980s when the brass and copper companies in Waterbury, which had been in decline since World War II, shuttered the last of their major factories.  Recreation and conservation  Although the federal and state governments do not maintain any parkland on Mad River, some municipal parks are located along the river in Waterbury and Wolcott. Scovill Reservoir, a 121-acre lake created by impounding the Mad River in central Wolcott, is a recreational reservoir which offers activities including fishing, boating, swimming and hiking. Wolcott's Peterson Park is situated along Mad River, as well. In fact, the 35-mile CFPA Blue-Blazed Mattatuck Trail begins in the park and follows the Mad River for some time through a woodland setting. Further downstream in Waterbury, the 93-acre Hamilton Park encompasses a length of the Mad River and offers swimming, ice skating and hiking (in addition to sports fields that don't directly incorporate the river).  Ecology  Free-flowing stretches of the Mad River are not generally believed to be capable of supporting significant populations of riverine gamefish. In 2015, for example, the official Connecticut Angler's Guide neglected to so much as mention the Mad River in its index of rivers and streams. Dramatic seasonal reductions in waterflow and a shortage of deep pools means that coldwater fish, such as native brook trout, are likely to have considerable difficulty flourishing in the river when water temperatures rise. Furthermore, dams along the river in both Wolcott and Waterbury obstruct the natural migration of fish. However, lakes and ponds produced by impounding the Mad River behind dams offer deeper, cooler, larger habitat areas in which fish of numerous species are able to thrive. Scovill Reservoir, which occupies roughly 120 acres along the Mad River in central Wolcott, is known to support trout, largemouth bass, sunfish, yellow perch, chain pickerel and black crappie. As of 2013, the reservoir was designated a \\"Catfish Lake\\" and is stocked regularly with channel catfish. Scovill Reservoir is also known to host a significant population of bowfin, a large \\"primitive fish\\" which is common in the Southern United States but very unusual in New England. The fish was illegally introduced to the reservoir in the 1970s and has since become naturalized.

Early life and education  Newton was born at Pensford in Somerset in 1893, the daughter of George and Melinda Batten. She attended Colston‚Äôs Girls' School, Bristol, where she was captain of school. She studied botany at the University of Bristol, where she was awarded the Vincent Stuckey Lean scholarship in botany and graduated with a first class honours degree.  Career  She became assistant lecturer in Botany at Bristol in 1919, before moving to Birkbeck College, University of London the next year. She worked as lecturer in botany until 1923, and then held a research post at the Imperial College of Science until her marriage in 1925. From then until his death in 1927 she assisted him, including visiting the British Museum on his behalf. From 1927 to 1928, she worked for the John Innes Horticultural Institute. In 1928, Newton moved to Wales, becoming lecturer in botany at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth. She was promoted to professor of botany in 1930. Under her guidance, her department achieved a considerable reputation both in Wales and beyond. There was a striking increase in the number of students, and a vigorous research programme was undertaken, closely related to local issues. She was Vice-Principal of the University of Wales 1951-52, and then, following the sudden death of Ifor L. Evans, Acting Principal 1952-53. In 1959, she was elected Emeritus Professor; she received an honorary LLD from the University of Wales in 1973. Her students were reported to remembered her as a dedicated teacher, whose lectures were always clear, well illustrated and a model of succinctness. She is described as an imposing person and a strict disciplinarian, but also as a kindly person, who would give help when it was needed. During her time, the botany department was based on the Promenade. Although the move to Penglais was made after her retirement, she made a major contribution to the design, equipping and layout of the new building. She published widely on plant distribution and seaweeds. Her A Handbook of the British Seaweeds was published in 1931. The majority of it is made up of a systematic treatment of around 750 species of algae, occurring round the coasts of the British Isles. Jones describes it as a work of outstanding scholarship, still used 50 years later. During the Second World War, the Ministry of Health was concerned about a possible shortage of agar, essential for scientific, food and medicinal purposes. This applied particularly after Pearl Harbour when Japanese supplies were cut off. Newton was asked to coordinate botanical work involving large scale production of agar from suitable British seaweeds. She served on the Vegetable Drugs Committee of the Ministries of Supply and Health. In addition, she was responsible for the field surveys in Wales and north of the Firth of Lorne, for the work on Gigartina stellata and Chondrus crispus, and for editing the published volume. Her work on river pollution commenced with an interdisciplinary project on the River Rheidol at Aberystwyth in the 1930s. Mining operations in the 19th century meant the river was polluted with lead and zinc that adversely affected plant and animal life. The river was monitored until its almost complete recovery as a major salmon river in the late 1960s. This project is said to have anticipated modern studies in this field by many years. She was consulted subsequently on the biological effects of pollution in connection with a number of major industrial projects. She acted as consultant to the Rheidol Hydro-Electric Scheme. She also lectured on fossil and flowering plants, plus playing an important role in the early work of the Nature Conservancy in Wales. Newton held the presidency of a number of societies; these included Section K of the British Association, 1949; the British Phycological Society, 1955‚Äì57, and the UK Federation for Education in Home Economics, 1957-63.  Personal life and death  She married Dr William Charles Frank Newton in 1925, a cytologist at the John Innes Horticultural Institute. She was widowed two years later. From 1927 to 1928 she helped to prepare much of her late husband‚Äôs work for publication. Newton died at Pontardawe, near Swansea on 26 March 1981. Selected publications Batten, L. 1918.

He was a member of a gifted family of English origin, which produced a celebrated doctor, three distinguished clerics, and a noted classical scholar. Life He was born in Drogheda, eldest son of John Jebb and his wife Alicia Forster. His father was an alderman of Drogheda, and also had an estate at Leixlip in County Kildare; his grandfather, the elder Richard Jebb, had emigrated to Ireland from Mansfield in Nottinghamshire. Richard's younger brother was John Jebb, Bishop of Limerick. The two brothers were very close throughout their lives, and John, who never married, lived with Richard as a young man. Their father suffered financial losses for a time, but Richard at the age of twenty-one inherited a substantial fortune from his father's cousin Sir Richard Jebb, 1st Baronet, a distinguished doctor who became physician to King George III. John Jebb, the political and religious reformer, was another cousin who belonged to the Irish branch of the family. Richard's younger brother John Jebb, Bishop of Limerick. Richard was educated at a local school in Drogheda, then at the University of Dublin, from which he graduated in 1786. He entered Lincoln's Inn and was called to the Irish Bar in 1789, becoming King's Counsel in 1806. He was a moderate opponent of the Act of Union 1800, although in his pamphlet \\"Arguments for and against the Act of Union\\" he endeavoured to be fair to both sides of the debate. Like many former opponents of Union he was prepared to accept office under the new regime, although he refused to sit in the English House of Commons. He became Third Serjeant in 1816, Second Serjeant in 1818 and a justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland) in 1818. He died suddenly at his home in Rostrevor, County Down in 1834, a victim of the first great cholera epidemic in nineteenth century Europe. Family He married in 1802 Jane Louisa Finlay, eldest daughter of John Finlay of Corkagh, MP for Dublin County. Louisa was described as a woman of exceptional strength of character; she died in 1823, after a long and painful illness. They had six children, five sons and a daughter, of whom the best known is John Jebb (1805-1886), Canon of Hereford Cathedral. Their second son Robert followed his father to the Bar, had a successful career, and was the father of the politician and classical scholar Richard Claverhouse Jebb. As a judge he has been described as firm, but also humane and impartial. Elrington Ball calls him a gifted man who like his brother Bishop Jebb was often underestimated by those who knew him, due to his modest and unassuming manner. Both had a keen sense of humour, although the Bishop usually reserved his jokes for the family circle. Richard's grandson, Richard Claverhouse Jebb References *Ball, F.

It was formed in 2010 and since then has delivered a varied programme of contemporary art including installations, sculpture, live performances, film screenings, and collaborative public works. It is one of Creative Scotland's portfolio of regularly-funded organisations.  History  ATLAS Arts was founded in 2010, partly in response to the closure of Skye's former arts centre An Tuireann, and following research conducted by the Scottish Arts Council which found that Skye and Lochalsh had the largest gap in visual arts provision in the northwest of Scotland. Initially the organisation was hosted by HI~Arts (a cultural development agency for the Highlands and Islands of Scotland) until 2012, when it became an independent organisation with charitable status. From 2013 to 2015 ATLAS Arts collaborated with the Uist- based museum and arts centre Taigh Chearsabhagh to produce a pan-island programme of exhibitions, events, performances, and new commissions. Called Broad Reach, this included hosting an exhibition of work by Vija Celmins as part of the ARTIST ROOMS series of touring exhibitions. In summer 2014 ATLAS Arts participated in the Scotland-wide exhibition programme GENERATION: 25, commissioning a two large scale out door works and public programme by artists Joanne Tatham and Tom O‚ÄôSullivan. In October 2014 it was announced that the organisation had secured three-year funding as part of Creative Scotland's portfolio of 119 regularly-funded organisations for the period 2015-2018.  Aims  ATLAS Arts' stated aims are to promote the advancement of contemporary art, and culture by promoting and enabling access, initiating projects, and providing opportunities for artists. A strong theme reflected in all the work commissioned by the organisation has been the environment, history, and culture of Isle of Skye and beyond.

Dating to the mid-4th century AD, the Roman Tomb is the best-preserved architectural monument of the Ancient Roman city of Durostorum. The tomb is considered \\"one of the most investigated and most discussed monuments of the late antique art in Bulgaria\\" and the Balkans,Atanasov, p. 447. owing in large part to the quality and extent of its interior frescoes. History Though the influence of Christianity had reached Silistra by the time, the Roman Tomb is clearly an example of pagan art commissioned by a pagan owner. Thus, it is considered likely that it predates Theodosius I's persecution of Roman paganism. Its construction also likely preceded the Gothic invasion of Durostorum of 376‚Äì378, which caused great turmoil in the city. The invasion may have caused the master's family depicted in the tomb to flee the city, explaining the lack of burials in the tomb.Atanasov, p. 451. In any case, the tomb must be stylistically ascribed to the 4th century and specifically to Theodosius I's reign. The Roman Tomb was coincidentally discovered in 1942 in the southern outskirts of Silistra, a major town in Southern Dobruja on the banks of the Lower Danube. Silistra had only recently been transferred by Romania back to Bulgaria as part of the 1940 Treaty of Craiova. Since 1984, the Roman Tomb of Silistra has been on UNESCO's Tentative List of World Heritage Sites. Architecture and frescoes A fresco portraying a female servant carrying gifts to the master's family The stone tomb features a single burial chamber and measures . It has a west-east orientation, with the entrance on the east wall and a semi-cylindrical brick vault.Atanasov, p. 448. It is located amidst the ruins of a necropolis from Late Antiquity which included other similar structures. Ceramic plates, rectangular in shape and painted using the fresco-secco technique, cover the entirety of its floor. In contrast to most other known Roman tombs from the period in the Balkans, the entire interior is covered by multi-coloured mural paintings. The northern, southern and eastern walls feature a procession of servants, whereas the frescoes of the western wall, directly opposite the entrances, depict the master and his wife.Atanasov, p. 449. A frieze running along the walls of the tomb contains 11 panels featuring the portraits of male and female slaves bringing various gifts and garments to the masters. The procession runs from either side of the central panel that portrays the masters, providing for a symmetrical composition. The tomb's decoration also includes hunting scenes, candlesticks, plants and animals, including peacocks and pigeons. Overall, the decoration's remarkable level of preservation and the quality of the mural paintings makes the tomb a \\"unique example of art and life\\" in the outer regions of the Roman Empire during the turbulent 4th century. The Roman Tomb of Silistra is situated at the intersection of the Sedmi Septemvri and Boyka Voyvoda Streets in the town. As of 2016, it can only be toured after a prior reservation at the Regional Historical Museum of Silistra.

Galilean electromagnetism is useful for describing the electric and magnetic fields in the vicinity of charged bodies moving at non-relativistic speeds relative to the frame of reference. The resulting mathematical equations are simpler than the fully relativistic forms because certain coupling terms are neglected. In electrical networks, Galilean electromagnetism provides possible tools to derive the equations used in low- frequency approximations in order to quantify the current crossing a capacitor or the voltage induced in a coil. As such, Galilean electromagnetism can be used to regroup and explain the somehow dynamic but non-relativistic quasistatic approximations of Maxwell's equations. Overview In 1905 Albert Einstein made use of the non-Galilean character of Maxwell's equations to develop his theory of special relativity. The special property embedded in Maxwell's equations is known as the Lorentz invariance. In Maxwell's equations frame, assuming that the speed of moving charges is small compared to the speed of light, it is possible to derive approximations that fulfill Galilean invariance. This approach enables the rigorous definition of two main mutually exclusive limits known as quasi-electrostatics (electrostatics with displacement currents or ohmic currents) and quasi-magnetostatics (magnetostatics with electric field caused by variation of magnetic field according to Faraday's law, or by ohmic currents). Quasi-static approximations are often poorly introduced in literature as stated for instance in Hauss & Melcher. They are often presented as a single one whereas Galilean electromagnetism shows that the two regimes are in general mutually exclusive. According to Rousseaux, the existence of these two exclusive limits explains why electromagnetism as long been thought to be incompatible with Galilean transformations. However Galilean transformations applying in both cases (magnetic limit and electric limit) were known by engineers before the topic was discussed by Levy-Leblond. These transformations are found in Woodson and Melcher's 1968 book. If the transit time of the electromagnetic wave passing through the system is much less than a typical time scale of the system, then Maxwell equations can be reduced to one of the galilean limits. For instance, for dielectrical liquids it is quasielectrostatics, and for highly conducting liquids quasimagnetostatics. History Electromagnetism followed a reverse path compared to mechanics. In mechanics, the laws were first derived by Isaac Newton in their Galilean form. They had to wait for Albert Einstein and his special relativity theory to take a relativistic form. Einstein has then allowed a generalization of Newton's laws of motion to describe the trajectories of bodies moving at relativistic speeds. In the electromagnetic frame, James Clerk Maxwell directly derived the equations in their relativistic form, although this property had to wait for Hendrik Lorentz and Einstein to be discovered. As late as 1963, Purcell offered the following low velocity transformations as suitable for calculating the electric field experienced by a jet plane travelling in the Earth's magnetic field. : E' = E + v \\\\times B . : B' = B - \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\mu_0 v \\\\times E . In 1973 Bellac and Levy-Leblond state that these equations are incorrect or misleading because they do not correspond to any consistent Galilean limit. Rousseaux gives a simple example showing that a transformation from an initial inertial frame to a second frame with a speed of v0 with respect to the first frame and then to a third frame moving with a speed v1 with respect to the second frame would give a result different from going directly from the first frame to the third frame using a relative speed of (v0 \\\\+ v1). Le Bellac and Levy-Leblond offer two transformations that do have consistent Galilean limits as follows: The electric limit applies when electric field effects are dominant such as when Faraday's law of induction was insignificant. : E' = E . : B' = B - \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\mu_0 v \\\\times E . The magnetic limit applies when the magnetic field effects are dominant. : E' = E + v \\\\times B . : B' = B . Jackson introduces a Galilean transformation for the Faraday's equation and gives an example of a quasi-electrostatic case that also fulfills a Galilean transformation. Jackson states that the wave equation is not invariant under Galilean transformations. In 2013, Rousseaux published a review and summary of Galilean electromagnetism.

Born in Hagonoy, Bulacan, he is the eleventh of 13 children of a fisherman and an ordinary housewife. He managed to finish his primary education with flying colors having graduated as valedictorian and was a consistent scholar in his secondary education. Finishing his college education was really difficult due to poverty which constrained him to take various odd jobs to support himself. More than just military achievements, Colonel Marcelino transcended the stereotypical role of a soldier in his various assignments, particularly with his work with foreign governments. A number of people who heard Marcelino‚Äôs struggle to liberate our communities from terrorism and the drug menace described him as brave, credible, and ‚Äúdead‚Äù. ‚ÄúDead‚Äù describes the numerous threats that he gets from the criminals whom he sent to jail, who will do everything to destroy if not kill him. But Marcelino is a living inspiration to our people to be upright and honest. He is convinced that ‚Äúwe can change the Philippines for the better, one Filipino at a time, and one government agency at a time, and I will start it from myself‚Äù. Indeed, Colonel Marcelino‚Äôs life story is one of dedication to the service of the country and its people.  Early Struggle  Marcelino initially planned to enroll at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila believing that it is the only school that his family can afford. But upon enrolling, he found out that the registration fee amounted to P180.00 ‚Äì money that they did not have. Determined to finish his studies, Marcelino worked at a construction site at the University of the East in Recto, Manila where he saw a poster of the DAWN, the college‚Äôs publication. Immediately, he applied to become one of its staff writers which helped him pay his tuition. He also became a police beat reporter for the then internationally circulated tabloid, Headline Manila. ‚ÄúMars‚Äù, as his peers call him, was just 16 years old then.  Military Career  As a police reporter and news editor of The Shield (the official publication of UE Citizen Military Training), Marcelino was supposed to interview a high ranking military officer when somebody handed him an application for the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) examination. He was finally hard up, so he applied to be a PMA cadet. In PMA, he was one of the editors of The Corps Board and Staff, the official publication of the Cadet Corps and also the managing editor of The Sword, the Academy‚Äôs annual publication for the graduating class. After graduating in March 1994, he joined the Philippine Marine Corps and was deployed in Mindanao wherein he spent most of his combat tour of duty. From being a Platoon Commander in the farthest and war-torn areas in Mindanao, he rose to become: a (1) Marine Company Commander; (2) Battalion Staff Officer; (3) Marine Corps Spokesperson; (4) Flag Secretary to the Marine Corps Commandant; and (5) assumed other critical positions in the Armed Forces of the Philippines hierarchy.  Young Marcelino  Marcelino was a young lieutenant assigned as Intelligence Officer of Marine Battalion Landing Team-5 who personally led the troops that arrested terrorists and recovered the speedboat in Mapun Island, Tawi-Tawi, which was used by the notorious Abu Sayyaf Group led by Commander Aldam Tilao alias Abu Sabaya in the infamous Dos Palmas kidnapping incident[1][2]. Sabaya was an Abu Sayyaf leader responsible for the kidnapping and killing of innocent Filipinos and foreigners particularly in Sulu and Basilan provinces. The U.S. State Department‚Äôs Rewards for Justice Program, in fact, offered a US$5 million reward for his arrest or conviction in 2002. Marcelino was instrumental in the successful neutralization of Abu Sabaya and several Abu Sayyaf Group Commanders and members, including the successful rescue of kidnap victims of the said kidnapping incident.  Service as a junior officer  Marcelino served with the Philippine Battalion Task Force to East Timor under the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) in 2000. As a very young lieutenant, he served as the Peacekeeping Force Commander in the Sub-district of Natarbora, Manatuto, East Timor. He played a very vital role in the attainment of an environment of peace and security in his area of responsibility and the implementation of development programs of the other pillars of UNTAET. With his managerial expertise and unselfish desire to reach out to the Timorese people despite many constraints and very limited resources, his unit has conducted medical and dental services, humanitarian aid, rehabilitation of school buildings, and repair of roads and bridges. His good relationship with the different international agencies and non-governmental organizations in the area has established a cooperative effort for the development of the sub-district. In return, he was given several commendation letters from the civilian administration of East Timor, the UNTAET leadership and the UNTAET Peace Keeping Force Deputy Force Commander, Major General Mike Smith, of the Australian Defence Force. He was a budding captain when he served as the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) liaison officer to the Joint United States Military Assistance Group (JUSMAG) and the US Defense Representative to the Republic of the Philippines. As such, he was the primary point of contact and the responsible person to the Chief, JUSMAG-Philippines, and the concurrent Commander, US Pacific Command Representatives in matters concerning the AFP and the US Armed Forces. He likewise coordinated the Joint-Combined Bilateral Exercise Programs, the second-largest US International Military Education and Training (IMET) program in the world, as well as other military to military engagement programs as prescribed by the Mutual Defense Board. For this service, he was awarded by the Secretary of the United States Army with the US Army Achievement Medal for his invaluable contributions in strengthening the bilateral relations between the US and Philippine Armed Forces during crucial times of the US Operation Enduring Freedom-Philippines.  Anti-Drug Service  Colonel Marcelino began his career in the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) when he was directed to resolve the case of theft of 21-million pesos worth of shabu from PDEA‚Äôs Laboratory Service evidence room in August 2006. Then a seasoned intelligence officer in the Philippine Marine Corps, he was tasked by then PDEA Director General Dionisio Santiago to catch the perpetrators of the crime which put the agency in a very bad light. Going undercover, then Captain Marcelino led the operation at a shopping mall in Fairview, Quezon City which led to the arrest of the perpetrators of the theft and who were all PDEA officials and personnel[1]. The arrests spearheaded the pursuit of cleansing the ranks of PDEA of drug users, coddlers, and protectors. In the early dawn of December 22, 2006, and barely four months in PDEA, Marcelino led a composite group of PDEA agents and Chinese authorities from China National Narcotics Control Commission (CNNCC) in steering the whole operations from intelligence work to the actual raid of the clandestine drug laboratory in Calumpit, Bulacan whereby they seized a 1.5 billion-peso (US$30.3 million) worth of methamphetamine hydrochloride[2]. In so doing, his team then practically dismantled one of the biggest drug syndicates in Southeast Asia as cited by the CNNCC[3]. Three members of the Chinese drug syndicate were also nabbed at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) when they were about to leave the country. CNNCC also arrested 13 other members of the syndicate in China and recovered one ton of precursors. The operation significantly strengthened the cooperation between the Filipino and Chinese anti-narcotics agencies. Marcelino then became the youngest in the Agency‚Äôs national directorial staff who simultaneously held the positions of Director of PDEA‚Äôs International Cooperation and Foreign Affairs Service, Director of the Special Enforcement Service (PDEA‚Äôs national striking force trained to conduct special investigations and operations), the Director of the Interagency Counter- narcotics Operations Network or ICON (Philippine‚Äôs inter-agency effort against the organized trafficking of illegal drugs in the country), and as the Director for Intelligence of the Presidential Task Force Drug Courier (PTFDC). PTDFC was formed through Presidential Administrative Order 279, issued on February 08, 2010, due to the rampant incidents of Filipinos used as drug couriers by international drug cartels. It aims to help protect Filipinos from being victimized by the drug syndicates. As Director of the PDEA‚Äôs Special Enforcement Service and Director for Intelligence of PTDFC, Marcelino initiated and directed several operations to neutralize the West African Drug Syndicates (WADS) operating worldwide. WADS is an international drug trafficking organization primarily responsible for victimizing Asian nationals as drug mules. Most of its leaders and members are African nationals from Nigeria and neighboring countries. It operates worldwide using the promise of love, relationship, opportunity to travel, and high paying jobs and ‚Äúeasy money‚Äù to lure potential drug mules.  Awards and Recognition Marcelino's Anti-Drug Crusade  With all his efforts, the PDEA rose from being in the list of most corrupt law enforcement agency in the country into one of the Top 10 lease corrupt agencies of the Philippine government according to Pulse Asia Review and the 2009 Global Competitiveness Survey Report as published in the World Economic Forum[1]. In 2009, Marcelino was chosen as the Most Outstanding Law Enforcer of the Year by the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) and was awarded as PDEA‚Äôs Most Outstanding National Staff Officer for his Exemplary Achievement to the Agency and to the People. He was given the Distinguished Public Servant Award by Rotary Club of Makati Urdaneta RD 3830 and was given a significant commendation by the Makati Business Club and other government and non-government institutions. He was also selected by the US Department of State to represent the Philippines in the International Visitor Leadership Program on US Foreign Policy and Counterterrorism in Washington DC and different states in the continental USA.  Service as a Senior Officer  In 2011, when the new leadership took over PDEA‚Äôs helm, Marcelino decided to go back to the Armed Forces of the Philippines where he worked as the AFP Cell Liaison Officer to the Presidential Situation Room in Malaca√±ang Palace and at the same time the Chief of the National Capital Region Command Operations Branch at the AFP Command Center. Significant international and national developments during those times prompted then Vice President and concurrent chair of the Interagency Council Against Trafficking, Jejomar Binay, to request the President for the reassignment of Marcelino to his office. However, higher authorities opted to put him with the Intelligence Service Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP) and work with the newly reactivated Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC). In PAOCC, Marcelino launched an operation that resulted in the arrest of hundreds of foreign nationals for violation of the Philippines Anti-Cybercrime Law. This operation is credited in the history of Philippine law enforcement as the largest number of single-day arrests against foreign nationals involved in criminal activities. In 2012, ISAFP leadership installed Marcelino to the helm of military intelligence group to address the escalating threats posed by insurgency in the Southern Tagalog region wherein he also assumed the vice chairmanship of the Regional Intelligence Committee for more than two years. After substantially paralyzing the insurgents‚Äô movements, Marcelino was once again tasked to work against drug trafficking organizations that have metamorphosed from a mere law enforcement problem into a national security concern. It was during this time that significant counter-intelligence operations were launched. It has resulted in the discovery and dismantling of the clandestine shabu laboratory in Camiling, Tarlac in 2014. It was considered as the largest shabu laboratory ever dismantled in the history of Philippine narcotics operations with a three billion pesos total worth of equipment and drugs seized during the raid. It also paved the way for the discovery and subsequent counteraction operations against high profile inmates in different penitentiaries who were running the drug trades in the country behind bars.  The Betrayal and Birth of 'Free Marcelino Movement  Early in 2016 and while serving as Superintendent of the Philippine Navy Officers Candidate School, the entire nation was shocked when Marcelino together with his Chinese confidential informant was framed up and unlawfully arrested after they were allegedly caught in a clandestine drug laboratory and maliciously accused of manufacturing illegal drugs. He was vilified in the media as upright law enforcer turned rogue. However, people from all walks of life came out to defend him. Peasants, religious leaders, indigenous people, military, and people from the academe mobilized and organized the Free Marcelino Movement whose objective is to seek justice and freedom from the beleaguered Marine officer. The malicious accusation was, in fact, politically motivated and initiated by high ranking government officials whose toes Marcelino had stepped in the course of performing his duties as an ‚Äúanti-drug crusader‚Äù. He was incarcerated for almost a year until the Department of Justice withdrew the criminal charges against him. The withdrawal of the case was affirmed by Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 49 saying that the case against him lacks merit. The 14th Philippine Congress in its Second Regular Session adopted Senate Resolution Number 160 commending him and saying that ‚Äú‚Ä¶Marcelino deserves the country‚Äôs recognition of his integrity, courage, and dedication to duty during these times when the people‚Äôs trust in our law enforcers once again suffered a major setback‚Äù.  Achievements and Commendations  Marcelino distinguished himself in combat, intelligence operations, and civil- military operations during his stay in Mindanao. As a true-blooded Marine, he was dauntless in facing the enemy. But more than a warrior, Marcelino displayed a rare flair for winning the hearts and minds of civilians and military alike. He was awarded by the Secretary of the United States Army with the US Army Achievement Medal for his invaluable contributions in strengthening the bilateral relations between the US and Philippine Armed Forces during crucial times of the US Operation Enduring Freedom-Philippines. He was also a recipient of two Congressional Merit Medal, two Gold Cross Medal, which was the third from the highest award that a Filipino soldier can get for gallantry in combat, United Nations Service Medal, Bronze Cross Medal for risk of life and bravery, Military Merit Medals for meritorious achievement in combat, Silver Wing Medal, Disaster Relief and Rehabilitation Ribbon, Military Civic Action Medal, Mindanao-Sulu and Luzon Campaign Medals, Marine Command Badge, Presidential Unit Citation Badge, United States Navy Parachutist Badge, EOD and Psychological Operations Badges, Philippine Army Infantry Officer‚Äôs Badge and numerous letters of commendation and recognition from local government officials, senior military officers, and non-government organizations.

The surviving records on the internal history and rulers of the Emirate of Crete are very fragmentary. Following the studies of George C. Miles with the aid of numismatic evidence, he is tentatively identified as a son of the second emir, Shu'ayb, and the grandson of the conqueror of Crete and founder of the Emirate of Crete, Abu Hafs Umar. His reign is placed from c. 880 to c. 895. According to the Byzantine chronicler Genesios, sometime in the reign of the Byzantine emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886‚Äì912) he suffered a shipwreck off the coast of the Peloponnese, and was taken captive by the local governor, Constantine Tessarakontapechys. He was apparently succeeded by his brother Muhammad ibn Shu'ayb al-Zarkun, but two of his sons, Yusuf and Ahmad, are held to have reigned later, in c. 910‚Äì915 and c. 925‚Äì940 respectively.

She was a centenarian.  Genealogy and early life  Hoyt was born in Southport, Connecticut on June 17, 1858, the only child of James Eli Hoyt and Mary Riley Hoyt. She was the tenth generation of her Hoyt family line in the United States. She is a niece of General William Tecumseh Sherman.The Abilene reflector, July 30, 1885, page 8 ‚Äì first column of eight, upper left top. Her original American ancestor, Simon Hoyt, immigrated from England in 1628 and landed in Charlestown, Massachusetts. Later, he moved to Windsor Locks, Connecticut. In 1653, he moved once more to the city of Norwalk, Connecticut, and settled there permanently. Hoyt was born in her grandmother's house as Mary Francis HoytNew Ulm weekly review. (New Ulm, Minn.), 23 June 1886; column 5 at bottom and went by her childhood nickname \\"Minnie\\". She was raised and grew up in Norwalk. After high school, she attended Vassar College in New York City, graduating in 1880. Her first job was a favorable position for a young lady, a clerk with the Census Bureau in Washington, D.C.  Career  The 19th-century US Treasury Department paid women $900/year, and men $1200/year. Hoyt was the first woman selected to a US civil service position. The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, also known as the Civil Service Act, is a federal law established in 1883 which decided that government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit and examination scores instead of political affiliation. US president Chester A. Arthur signed the act in the spring of 1883, with the first official examination taking place on July 12. Hoyt produced the highest score. On September 5, she became the second person employed based on this examination and the first woman appointed to a federal position through the new Civil Service Act. She was appointed a clerk in the Bank Redemption Agency of the Treasury Department, holding the position for five years at an annual pay of US$900.  Awards  A letter from President Dwight D. Eisenhower was delivered to Hoyt by the chairman of the United States Civil Service Commission, Harris Ellsworth. He read the letter to Hoyt at her retirement home in New York City a day before her one-hundredth birthday, Hoyt having lost her eyesight in her early nineties. Eisenhower's letter explained that a door had been opened for women's opportunities in civil service, and that she was the leader for these opportunities. Hundreds of thousand of women followed in Hoyt's footsteps. In 1958, one fourth of the United States federal service was women. Ellsworth, at the time, was preparing to celebrate the Civil Service Commission's 75th anniversary.  Later life  Hoyt met her husband, Brice J. Moses, while working at the US Census Office. She took a hiatus and discontinued her career in 1888 to marry him and start a family. They had four children: Roger (b. 9/12/1889), Truman (b. 11/4/1893), Alan (b. 10/9/1894), and Elinor (b. 2/15/1896). Moses later left the Census Office and took a position with the Washington Loan and Trust Company. He also was a treasurer of the Washington Stock Exchange. Moses died in 1928 and Hoyt moved to 350 Central Park West in Manhattan, New York City, living there for the rest of her life. Her favorite pastime was baseball and she followed the New York Yankees baseball team on the radio. She lived to be 100 years old and died on October 19, 1958. At the time of her death, her sons Roger and Alan were still living.

He was one of the founders of the newspaper Sin Po. Biography Lauw was born in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, in 1883. He undertook an education at a Hokkien school, but also learned to speak Dutch language. In 1890, Lauw's father died, and he was raised by his mother, a seamstress. By age sixteen he had entered the workforce, first at a shop in Glodok run by Khouw Lam Tjiang then for the printer van Dorp. This latter job introduced Lauw to journalism, as van Dorp printed both the daily Bintang Betawi and the monthly Java Bode. Pendidikan jang Kliroe (1922) In the early 1900s Lauw began working for Sinar Betawi; by 1907 he was working as editor for the daily Perniagaan, together with Tio Ie Soei and Thio Tjin Boen. Working with Joe Sin Gie, on 1 October 1910 he established the weekly (later daily) Sin Po; when it was incorporated in February 1912, Lauw was one of five stockholders. He is recorded as assistant editor, under JR Razoux Kohr, several months later. Lauw established another weekly, the short-lasting Penghiboer, in 1913. Ten years later he became the editor-in-chief of Sin Po, but soon sold all shares in the company and moved to Bandung, where he worked with the monthly magazine Lay Po (later Sin Bin). He returned to Batavia in 1925, and by 1928 he was a regular contributor to Keng Po (run by Hauw Tek Kong). While working with Keng Po, Lauw helped Nio Joe Lan find work at the newspaper; Nio would go on to become an editor of Sin Po. Aside from journalism, Lauw was involved in the emerging literature of the East Indies. After Lie Kim Hok's death in 1912, Lauw completed the writer's ongoing translation of Hugo Hartmann's Dolores, de Verkochte Vrouw, publishing it as Prampoean jang Terdjoewal. In 1913 he published a Malay translation of Victor Ido's Karina Adinda; at the time it was one of only a few published Malay-language stage plays. In his foreword to the translation, Lauw wrote that he wanted to improve the quality of stage plays performed by Chinese Indonesians, which were facing competition from the burgeoning film industry as well as the bangsawan and stamboel theatrical genres. He also published his own stage play, Pendidikan jang Kliroe, in 1922. He published two further books in 1924, Brillian jang Tertjoeri and Riwajat Hindia Olanda. Lauw was also involved in various social organizations. He was a money collector for the Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan in 1907, and from 1907 to 1912 he served as an administrator and secretary for the Cheng Hwa Hui. Lauw died in 1953. He was preceded by his wife, Lie On Moy.
